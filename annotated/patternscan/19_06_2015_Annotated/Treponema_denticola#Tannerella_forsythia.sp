TI  == periodontal bacteria and prediabetes prevalence in origins: the oral infections,  glucose intolerance, and insulin resistance study.
AB  == periodontitis and type 2 diabetes mellitus are known to be associated. the relationship between periodontal microbiota and early diabetes risk has not been  studied. we investigated the association between periodontal bacteria and prediabetes prevalence among diabetes-free adults. origins (the oral infections,  glucose intolerance and insulin resistance study) cross sectionally enrolled 300  diabetes-free adults aged 20 to 55 y (mean +/- sd, 34 +/- 10 y; 77% female). prediabetes was defined as follows: 1) hemoglobin a1c values ranging from 5.7% to 6.4% or 2) fasting plasma glucose ranging from 100 to 125 mg/dl. in 1,188 subgingival plaque samples, 11 bacterial species were assessed at baseline, including aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, and actinomyces naeslundii. full-mouth clinical periodontal examinations were performed, and participants were defined as having no/mild periodontitis vs. moderate/severe periodontitis per the definition of the centers for disease control and prevention / american academy of periodontology. modified poisson regression evaluated prediabetes prevalence across bacterial tertiles. prevalence ratios and 95% confidence intervals for third vs. first tertiles are presented. all analyses were adjusted for cardiometabolic risk factors. all results presented currently arise from the baseline cross section. prediabetes prevalence was 18%, and 58% of participants had moderate/severe periodontitis. prevalence ratios (95% confidence intervals) summarizing associations between bacterial levels and prediabetes were as follows: a. actinomycetemcomitans, 2.48 (1.34, 4.58), p = 0.004; p. gingivalis, 3.41 (1.78, 6.58), p = 0.0003; t. denticola, 1.99 (0.992, 4.00), p = 0.052; t. forsythia, 1.95 (1.0, 3.84), p = 0.05; a. naeslundii, 0.46 (0.25, 0.85), p = 0.01. the prevalence ratio for prediabetes among participants with moderate/severe vs. no/mild periodontitis was 1.47 (0.78, 2.74), p = 0.23. higher colonization levels of specific periodontal microbiota are associated with higher prediabetes prevalence among diabetes-free adults.

TI  == periodontal infection and its putative links with alzheimer's disease.
AB  == periodontal disease (pd) and alzheimer's disease (ad) are inflammatory conditions affecting the global adult population. in the pathogenesis of pd, subgingival complex bacterial biofilm induces inflammation that leads to connective tissue degradation and alveolar bone resorption around the teeth. in health, junctional  epithelium seals the gingiva to the tooth enamel, thus preventing bacteria from entering the gingivae. chronic pd involves major pathogens (porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia) which have an immune armoury that can circumvent host's immune surveillance to create and maintain an  inflammatory mediator rich and toxic environment to grow and survive. the neurodegenerative condition, ad, is characterised by poor memory and specific hallmark proteins; periodontal pathogens are increasingly being linked with this  dementing condition. it is therefore becoming important to understand associations of periodontitis with relevance to late-onset ad. the aim of this review is to discuss the relevance of finding the keystone periodontal pathogen p. gingivalis in ad brains and its plausible contribution to the aetiological hypothesis of this dementing condition.

TI  == evaluation of a hydrophobic gel adhering to the gingiva in comparison with a standard water-soluble 1% chlorhexidine gel after scaling and root planing in patients with moderate chronic periodontitis. a randomized clinical trial.
AB  == objectives: to evaluate the clinical, microbiological and enzymatic activity of a hydrophobic chlorhexidine-based gingiva-adhering gel containing herbal ingredients, compared with a commercially available 1% chlorhexidine water-soluble gel, during non-surgical therapy of moderate chronic periodontitis. methods: a total of 34 subjects participated in this 6-month blinded randomized parallel controlled trial (isrctn35210084). after scaling and root planing (srp), test group received the gel, by rubbing on the gingiva, once every second day, for 14 days. the control group received the control gel twice daily. clinical parameters considered were the approximal plaque index, simplified oral hygiene index, modified gingival index, bleeding on probing, probing depth and clinical attachment level (primary outcome), assessed at baseline, 3 and 6 months, together with the frequency of detection of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis (p.g.), prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola (t.d.), tannerella forsythia (t.f.), and activity of neutrophil elastase and myeloperoxidase (secondary outcomes). results: at 3 and 6 months, all clinical parameters improved significantly, without significant intergroup differences, except ohi-s, which improved at 3 months (p < 0.05). microbiological data resulted in no significant intergroup differences at baseline and 6 months. at 3 months, significant differences for p.g., t.f. and t.d. were noted. a significant reduction of neutrophil elastase after 3 and 6 months was observed (p < 0.005), without significant intergroup differences. for  myeloperoxidase, significant reductions were noted in both groups (p < 0.005 and  p < 0.05), but no significant intergroup differences. the tested product seemed to have an increased efficacy, due to longer persistence on the gingiva, with reduced application frequency. conclusions: both products had a relatively similar influence on the clinical, microbiological and enzymatic outcomes at 3 and 6 months after srp.

TI  == microbial dynamics during conversion from supragingival to subgingival biofilms in an in vitro model.
AB  == the development of dental caries and periodontal diseases result from distinct shifts in the microbiota of the tooth-associated biofilm. this in vitro study aimed to investigate changes in biofilm composition and structure, during the shift from a "supragingival" aerobic to a "subgingival" anaerobic profile. biofilms consisting of actinomyces oris, candida albicans, fusobacterium nucleatum, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mutans and veillonella dispar were aerobically grown in saliva-containing medium on hydroxyapatite discs. after 64 h, campylobacter rectus, prevotella intermedia and streptococcus anginosus were further added along with human serum, while culture conditions were shifted to microaerophilic. after 96 h, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola were finally added and the biofilm was grown anaerobically for another 64 h. at the end of each phase, biofilms were harvested for species-specific quantification and localization. apart from c. albicans, all other species gradually increased during aerobic and microaerophilic conditions,  but remained steady during anaerobic conditions. biofilm thickness was doubled during the microaerophilic phase, but remained steady throughout the anaerobic phase. extracellular polysaccharide presence was gradually reduced throughout the growth period. biofilm viability was reduced during the microaerophilic conversion, but was recovered during the anaerobic phase. this in vitro study has characterized the dynamic structural shifts occurring in an oral biofilm model during the switch from aerobic to anaerobic conditions, potentially modeling the  conversion of supragingival to subgingival biofilms. within the limitations of this experimental model, the findings may provide novel insights into the ecology of oral biofilms. this article is protected by copyright. all rights reserved.

TI  == microbiome profiles in periodontitis in relation to host and disease characteristics.
AB  == periodontitis is an inflammatory condition that affects the supporting tissues surrounding teeth. the occurrence of periodontitis is associated with shifts in the structure of the communities that inhabit the gingival sulcus. although great inter-subject variability in the subgingival microbiome has been observed in subjects with periodontitis, it is unclear whether distinct community types exist and if differences in microbial signatures correlate with host characteristics or with the variable clinical presentations of periodontitis. therefore, in this study we explored the existence of different community types in periodontitis and their relationship with host demographic, medical and disease-related clinical characteristics. clustering analyses of microbial abundance profiles suggested two types of communities (a and b) existed in the 34 subjects with periodontitis  evaluated. type b communities harbored greater proportions of certain periodontitis-associated taxa, including species historically associated with the disease, such as porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola, and taxa recently linked to periodontitis. in contrast, subjects with  type a communities had increased proportions of different periodontitis-associated species, and were also enriched for health-associated species and core taxa (those equally prevalent in health and periodontitis). periodontitis subgingival clusters were not associated with demographic, medical  or disease-specific clinical parameters other than periodontitis extent (proportion of sites affected), which positively correlated with the total proportion of cluster b signature taxa. in conclusion, two types of microbial communities were detected in subjects with periodontitis. host demographics and underlying medical conditions did not correlate with these profiles, which instead appeared to be related to periodontitis extent, with type b communities present in more widespread disease cases. the two identified periodontitis profiles may represent distinct dysbiotic processes potentially requiring community-tailored therapeutic interventions.

TI  == periodontal status and pathogenic bacteria after gastric bypass: a cohort study.
AB  == aim: the aim this study was to evaluate the influence of gastric bypass surgery (gbs) on periodontal disease and quantify the periodontopathogenic bacteria in patients undergoing this surgery. material and methods: this prospective study was composed of 50 patients who underwent bariatric surgery and the data collection was performed in three periods pre-operative, 6 (6m) and 12 months (12m) postoperative. the oral clinical examination to assess periodontal disease; gingival fluid sample collection for quantification of the periodontopathogenic bacteria porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, and prevotella intermedia using q-pcr; body mass index (bmi) and for collection of the individual's health-related data from medical files. results: there was a significant reduction in serum c-reactive protein (crp) and glucose levels after  surgery. the mean probing pocket depth (ppd) and clinical attachment level (cal)  increased significantly in the postoperative period of 6 months (p = 0.001). in the same period, the amount of p. gingivalis increased (p = 0.028) and the other  bacteria decreased slightly (p > 0.050). in the presence of p. gingivalis, t. forsythia, t. denticola and p. intermedia, a poor periodontal condition was observed. conclusion: the periodontal disease increased in severity and p. gingivalis increased after gbs. a systemic inflammation resolution due to bariatric surgery in obese subjects does not seem to affect the course of periodontal disease.

TI  == clinical, microbiological, and immunological aspects of healthy versus peri-implantitis tissue in full arch reconstruction patients: a prospective cross-sectional study.
AB  == background: due to the world-wide increase in treatments involving implant placement, the incidence of peri-implant disease is increasing. late implant failure is the result of the inability to maintain osseointegration, whose most important cause is peri-implantitis. the aim of this study was to analyze the clinical, microbiological, and immunological aspects in the peri-implant sulcus fluid (pisf) of patients with healthy dental implants and patients with peri-implantitis. methods: pisf samples were obtained from 24 peri-implantitis sites and 54 healthy peri-implant sites in this prospective cross-sectional study. the clinical parameters recorded were: modified gingival index (mgi), modified plaque index (mpi) and probing pocket depth (ppd). the periodontopathogenic bacteria tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola and porphyromonas gingivalis were evaluated, together with the total bacterial load (tbl). pisf samples were analyzed for the quantification of interleukin (il)-8, il-1beta, il-6, il-10 and tumor necrosis factor (tnf)-alpha using flow cytometry  (facs). results: the mgi and ppd scores in the peri-implantitis group were significantly higher than the healthy group (p < 0.001). a total of 61.5% of the  patients with peri-implantitis had both arches rehabilitated, compared with 22.7% of patients with healthy peri-implant tissues; there was no implant with peri-implantitis in cases that received mandibular treatment exclusively (p < 0.05). concentrations of porphyromonas gingivalis (p < 0.01), association with bacteria porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola (p < 0.05), as well as  the tbl (p < 0.05) are significantly higher in the peri-implantitis group. il-1beta (p < 0.01), il-6 (p < 0.01), il-10 (p < 0.05) and tnf-alpha (p < 0.01) are significantly higher at the sites with peri-implantitis compared to healthy peri-implant tissue, while il-8 did not increase significantly. conclusion: the results of the present study involving a limited patient sample suggest that the  peri-implant microbiota and which dental arch was rehabilitated involved could contribute to bone loss in peri-implantitis. a significant relationship is observed between the concentration of cytokines (interleukins 1beta, 6 and 10 and tnf-alpha) and the inflammatory response in peri-implantitis tissue.

TI  == occurrence of periodontal pathogens in ethnic groups from a native brazilian reservation.
AB  == objective: the present study was designed to evaluate the occurrence of periodontal pathogens in the subgingival biofilm of 100 native brazilians living  at the umutina indian reservation, mato grosso state, brazil. methods: periodontal clinical examinations were carried out prior to collection of subgingival biofilm, and the presence of 14 periodontal microorganisms was evaluated by polymerase chain reaction (pcr). the prevalence and risk analysis was performed using cochran and mantel-haenszel statistics for dichotomous variables or pearson's chi-squared test for analysis of proportions when variables had three or more categories. the interrelations between clinical and microbiological parameters were assessed using fisher's exact test and the mann-whitney u test. results: individuals with chronic periodontitis were frequently colonized by the association between porphyromonas gingivalis and campylobacter rectus, p. gingivalis and prevotella intermedia, or p. gingivalis and tannerella forsythia. patients with chronic periodontitis were also colonized by porphyromonas gulae and p. intermedia or by the association between p. gulae and t. forsythia. p. gulae was detected only in the subgingival samples from natives on a traditional diet. gingival bleeding was associated with aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, t. forsythia, p.  gingivalis, p. gulae, porphyromonas endodontalis, p. intermedia, and prevotella nigrescens. treponema denticola was uncommon. conclusions: peculiar microbiota was demonstrated to be associated with different periodontal disease statuses in  native brazilians, with modest occurrence of certain pathogens, such as t. denticola, and the presence of p. gulae in natives with gingivitis or chronic periodontitis.

TI  == microbiota at teeth and implants in partially edentulous patients. a 10-year retrospective study.
AB  == objective: to determine the microbiota at implants and adjacent teeth 10 years after placement of implants with a sandblasted and acid-etched surface. material  and methods: plaque samples obtained from the deepest sites of 504 implants and of 493 adjacent teeth were analyzed for certain bacterial species associated with periodontitis, for staphylococci, for aerobic gram-negative rods, and for yeasts  using nucleic acid-based methods. results: species known to be associated with periodontitis were detectable at 6.2-78.4% of the implants. significantly higher  counts at implants in comparison with teeth were assessed for tannerella forsythia, parvimonas micra, fusobacterium nucleatum/necrophorum, and campylobacter rectus. higher counts of periodontopathogenic species were detectable at implants of current smokers than at those of non-smokers. in addition, those species were found in higher quantities at implants of subjects with periodontitis. the prevalence of prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola, c. rectus, and moreover of staphylococcus warneri might be associated with peri-implant inflammation. selected staphylococcal species (not staphylococcus aureus), aerobic gram-negative rods, and yeasts were frequently detected, but with the exception of s. warneri, they did not show any association with periodontal or peri-implant diseases. conclusions: smoking and periodontal disease are risk factors for colonization of periodontopathic bacteria at implants. those bacterial species may play a potential role in peri-implant inflammation. the role of s. warneri needs further validation.

TI  == periodontal therapy effects on nitrite related to oral bacteria: a 6-month randomized clinical trial.
AB  == background: nitrite is a biological factor relevant to oral and systemic homeostasis. through an oral bacteria reduction process it was suggested that periodontal therapy and chlorhexidine rinse could impact nitrite levels leading to negative effects such as increase in blood pressure. this 6-month randomized clinical trial evaluated the effects of periodontal therapeutic protocols on salivary nitrite and its relation to subgingival bacteria. methods: 90 periodontitis patients were randomly allocated to debridement procedures in 4 weekly sections (quadrant scaling-qs) or within 24 hours (full-mouth scaling-fms) in conjunction with a 60-day chlorhexidine (chx) (qs+chx and fms+chx), placebo (qs+placebo and fms+placebo), or no mouth rinse (qs+none and fms+none) use. real-time pcr determined total bacterial, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans,  porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, streptococcus oralis, and actinomyces naeslundi levels. salivary nitrite concentration was determined with griess reagent. data were statistically analyzed at baseline, 3, and 6 months by anova (analysis of variance), kruskal-wallis, mann-whitney, and spearman correlation tests (p<0.05). results: nitrite concentrations did not tend to change over time. regarding chx use, there was a negative correlation between nitrite and total bacterial load at 6 months (fms+chx) and one positive correlation between p.gingivalis and nitrite at baseline (qs+chx). independently of rinse type, in the fms group nitrite negatively correlated with several microbial parameters and also with a higher percentage of deep periodontal pockets. conclusions: the relation between nitrite and bacterial levels appear weak. short-term scaling exhibited a greater influence on nitrite concentrations then the long-term chx use.

TI  == a. actinomycetemcomitans profile and red complex bacterial species of an afro-brazilian community: a comparative study.
AB  == purposes: the primary aim of this cross-sectional study was to compare the levels of red complex bacteria between afro-brazilian and non afro-brazilian cohort. the secondary aim was to compare the distribution of both aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans serotype b and its jp2 strains among participants who harboured this bacterial species. methods: a total of 84 individuals were included in this study: 42 afro-descendants (mean age 35.9 +/- 13.1 years) and 42 non-afro-descendants (mean age 36.2 +/- 13.1 years) matched (1:1) by periodontal  diagnosis, age and gender. all participants received clinical examinations of periodontal pocket depth, clinical attachment level, and plaque and gingival indices. subgingival samples were taken for microbial analysis. first, genomic dna (gdna) was extracted and purified and the quantification of total number of bacterial cells, a. actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola was carried out by qpcr. then, a. actinomycetemcomitans strains were classified according to serotype b and jp2 profiles by conventional pcr. results: clinically, mean pd, mean cal and percentage of cal >/= 3 mm differed between groups (student's t-test p<0.05). the levels of red complex bacteria between afro-brazilian and non-afro-brazilian populations were similar. the exception was verified to a. actinomycetemcomitans  showing significantly higher levels among afro-brazilian descendants in comparison to non-afro-brazilian descendants. afro-brazilian descendants were clearly infected by more virulent serotype b and jp2 strains. conclusions: despite no statistically significant differences related to the red complex species, afro-brazilian descendants harboured higher levels of a. actinomycetemcomitans. also, our findings confirm that afro-descendant populations are preferably colonised by a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b as well as jp2 strains.

TI  == p. gingivalis in periodontal disease and atherosclerosis - scenes of action for antimicrobial peptides and complement.
AB  == according to the nhs, it is estimated that over 50% of the adult population are,  to some extent, affected by gum disease and approximately 15% of uk population have been diagnosed with severe periodontitis. periodontitis, a chronic polymicrobial disease of the gums, causes inflammation in its milder form, whereas in its severe form affects the surrounding tissues and can result in tooth loss. during periodontitis, plaque accumulates and sits between the junctional epithelium and the tooth itself, resulting in inflammation and the formation of a periodontal pocket. an interface is formed directly between the subgingival bacteria and the junctional epithelial cells. bacterial pathogens commonly associated with periodontal disease are, among others, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola, together known as the  "red complex." this review will mostly concentrate on the role of p. gingivalis,  a gram-negative anaerobic bacterium and one of the major and most studied contributors of this disease. because periodontal disease is associated with the  development of atherosclerosis, it is important to understand the local immune response to p. gingivalis. innate immune players, in particular, complement and antimicrobial peptides and their effects with regard to p. gingivalis during periodontitis and in the development of atherosclerosis will be presented.

TI  == inter- and intra-test agreement of three commercially available molecular diagnostic tests for the identification of periodontal pathogens.
AB  == objective: the aim of the study was to compare the agreement and reproducibility  of three test kits (iai pado test 4[symbol: see text]5(r), micro-ident(r), and carpegen(r) perio diagnostik) regarding the detection of porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. materials and methods: periodontal plaque samples from 20  patients suffering from severe chronic or aggressive periodontitis were split into two identical batches. samples of batch 1 were evaluated immediately. samples of batch 2 were analyzed after a storage period of 2 weeks at 4 degrees c. results: the conformity of results obtained by the evaluated test kits as well as the concordant detection rate of periodontopathogens proved to be low. the agreement of the detection rate depends on the chosen test kit. the intra-test reproducibility of the qualitative analysis of identical plaque samples was perfect only for carpegen(r) perio diagnostik. the quantitative analysis of the results expressed as n-fold difference of the test results revealed an only poor  inter-test agreement between the test systems. conclusions: results of test kits  for the identification of periodontopathogens are significantly influenced by the detection technology applied. the most advanced technology tended to give the most reliable results. clinical relevance: as microbiological test results are supposed to be used for the planning of subsequent treatment strategies, clinicians should be aware of the limitations of results obtained by the different test systems and should use the results only in conjunction with clinical data for subsequent therapeutic decisions.

TI  == short-term effect of removal of fixed orthodontic appliances on gingival health and subgingival microbiota: a prospective cohort study.
AB  == abstract objective. the aim of this prospective longitudinal study was to assess  and compare the microbiological and clinical parameters of patients wearing a fixed orthodontic appliance, as opposed to 10 days after the bracket had been removed following treatment. materials and methods. in total, 122 patients participated in this study; 61 of the subjects were assessed at baseline (wearing a fixed orthodontic appliance: t1) and 10 days after bracket removal (t2). the other 61 individuals had never worn an orthodontic appliance before and these subjects served as controls (ct). subgingival plaque samples were assessed for bleeding on probing (gbi) and plaque index (vpi). pcr of 16s rdna, followed by reverse species-specific hybridization for aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola were performed. a descriptive analysis was conducted; chi-squared, student's matched and unmatched t-tests, the point biserial correlation coefficient and the mcnemar test were used to test for differences between groups (p < 0.05). results. the gbi and vpi clinical parameters showed statistical differences (p < 0.05) between t1-t2, t1-ct and t2-ct. the prevalence of t. denticola had significantly decreased (p = 0.039) 10 days after appliance removal. at t2, a significant positive correlation was found between gbi and a. actinomycetemcomitans (p < 0.01) and between clinical parameters and p. intermedia. in patients without a fixed orthodontic appliance (t2 and ct), there  was a significant positive correlation between t. forsythia and vpi. conclusion.  local factors associated with the wearing of a fixed orthodontic appliance influence changes in subgingival plaque that leads to more inflammation and bleeding.

TI  == distribution of 8 periodontal microorganisms in family members of chinese patients with aggressive periodontitis.
AB  == objective: to date, no information on the distribution of periodontal microorganisms among family members of chinese patients with aggressive peridontitis (agp) is available. the aim of the present study was to investigate  the probability of transmission of eight periodontal microorganisms between patients with aggressive periodontitis and their family members. design: saliva and pooled subgingival plaque samples were collected from 103 participants from 41 nuclear families (including 41 agp probands, 19 mothers, 22 fathers, 21 siblings). eight periodontal microorganisms, including aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema  denticola, campylobacter rectus, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and fusobacterium nucleatum were detected in these samples by the polymerase chain reaction (pcr). in addition, the distribution of fima genotypes was assessed in p. gingivalis-positive individuals by pcr. results: p. gingivalis, t. forsythia,  t. denticola, c. rectus and f. nucleatum were the most frequently detected species both in agp probands and in their relatives. kappa statistical analysis revealed that the detection of a. actinomycetemcomitans (kappa = 0.503) and f. nucleatum (kappa = 0.565) in probands was highly consistent with that in their relatives. most probands shared the identical fima genotype of p. gingivalis with their relatives. conclusions: our results suggested that the intrafamilial transmission of periodontal microorganisms may occur between chinese patients with aggressive periodontitis and their relatives.

TI  == serum igg antibody levels to periodontal microbiota are associated with incident  alzheimer disease.
AB  == background: periodontitis and alzheimer disease (ad) are associated with systemic inflammation. this research studied serum igg to periodontal microbiota as possible predictors of incident ad. methods: using a case-cohort study design, 219 subjects (110 incident ad cases and 109 controls without incident cognitive impairment at last follow-up), matched on race-ethnicity, were drawn from the washington heights-inwood columbia aging project (whicap), a cohort of longitudinally followed northern manhattan residents aged >65 years. mean follow-up was five years (sd 2.6). in baseline sera, serum igg levels were determined for bacteria known to be positively or negatively associated with periodontitis (porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans y4, treponema denticola, campylobacter rectus, eubacterium  nodatum, and actinomyces naeslundii genospecies-2). in all analyses, we used antibody threshold levels shown to correlate with presence of moderate-severe periodontitis. results: mean age was 72 years (sd 6.9) for controls, and 79 years (sd 4.6) for cases (p<0.001). non-hispanic whites comprised 26%, non-hispanic blacks 27%, and hispanics 48% of the sample. in a model adjusting for baseline age, sex, education, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, smoking, prior history of stroke, and apolipoprotein e genotype, high anti-a. naeslundii titer (>640 ng/ml, present in 10% of subjects) was associated with increased risk of ad (hr = 2.0, 95%ci: 1.1-3.8). this association was stronger after adjusting for other significant titers (hr = 3.1, 95%ci: 1.5-6.4). in this model, high anti-e. nodatum igg (>1755 ng/ml; 19% of subjects) was associated with lower risk of ad (hr = 0.5, 95%ci: 0.2-0.9). conclusions: serum igg levels to common periodontal microbiota are associated with risk for developing incident ad.

TI  == subgingival microbial profile and production of proinflammatory cytokines in chronic periodontitis.
AB  == this review examines literature data concerning the bacterial findings in chronic periodontitis depending on pocket depth, and presents the latest published information on the presence of proinflammatory factors in periodontal environment. it has been found that chronic periodontitis affects as much as 80%  of the middle-aged population; by comparison, the prevalence of aggressive periodontitis reaches up to 1-1.5%. it is accepted that this social disease is multifactorial in etiology, but the evidence in the literature suggests that the  levels of specific gram-negative organisms in subgingival plaque biofilm play a major role in the initiation and progression of the disease. of the many bacterial species inhabiting the periodontal environment, three types--porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), treponema denticola (td), tannerella forsythia (tf)--are strongly associated with the initiation and progression of periodontitis. microbiological studies suggest that porphyromonas gingivalis should be considered a major etiologic agent. currently, porphyromonas gingivalis is strongly associated with the pathogenesis of chronic periodontitis. on the other hand, the presence of aggregatibacter actinomycetemeomitans in patients with chronic periodontitis may be related to the severity of the disease and thus modify the therapeutic plan. the increased amount of periodontal pathogens in the subgingival area can activate a cascade of defense mechanisms of the body associated with the production of factors causing inflammation and destruction, which suggests a correlation between the bacterial findings and the body response implemented by enhancing the local cytokine expression. studies in the literature show that the presence of certain micro-organisms in the periodontal environment  is associated to increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines in the gingival fluid and gingival tissue. these levels have been associated with destructive tissues response. there is little evidence in the literature on the correlation of the levels of periodontal pathogens of sites with different pocket depth with  periodontal disease activity defined by the degree of the proinflammatory cytokine expression such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha) and interleukin 6 (il-6).

TI  == investigate the correlation between clinical sign and symptoms and the presence of p. gingivalis, t. denticola, and t. forsythia individually or as a "red complex" by a multiplex pcr method.
AB  == aim: the aim of this study was to investigate the correlation between endodontic  clinical signs and symptoms and the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia or their association by multiplex polymerase chain reaction assay. materials and methods: microbial samples were taken from 30 cases with necrotic pulp tissues in primary infections. dna was extracted from the samples, which were analyzed for the presence of three endodontic pathogens by using species-specific primers. results: p. gingivalis, t. denticola, t. forsythia, and red complex were present in 11, 17, 4, and 2 canals, respectively. clinical and statistically significant relationships were found between t. forsythia and mobility and between t. denticola and swelling. (p < 0.05). presence of other red complex bacteria shows clinical association with presence of signs and symptoms but no statistically significant relationship. conclusion: the high prevalence of p. gingivalis, t. denticola, and t. forsythia  in the examined samples suggests that these bacteria are related to the etiology  of symptomatic periradicular diseases.

TI  == high-resolution taxonomic profiling of the subgingival microbiome for biomarker discovery and periodontitis diagnosis.
AB  == the oral microbiome plays a key role for caries, periodontitis, and systemic diseases. a method for rapid, high-resolution, robust taxonomic profiling of subgingival bacterial communities for early detection of periodontitis biomarkers would therefore be a useful tool for individualized medicine. here, we used illumina sequencing of the v1-v2 and v5-v6 hypervariable regions of the 16s rrna  gene. a sample stratification pipeline was developed in a pilot study of 19 individuals, 9 of whom had been diagnosed with chronic periodontitis. five hundred twenty-three operational taxonomic units (otus) were obtained from the v1-v2 region and 432 from the v5-v6 region. key periodontal pathogens like porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia could be  identified at the species level with both primer sets. principal coordinate analysis identified two outliers that were consistently independent of the hypervariable region and method of dna extraction used. the linear discriminant analysis (lda) effect size algorithm (lefse) identified 80 otu-level biomarkers of periodontitis and 17 of health. health- and periodontitis-related clusters of  otus were identified using a connectivity analysis, and the results confirmed previous studies with several thousands of samples. a machine learning algorithm  was developed which was trained on all but one sample and then predicted the diagnosis of the left-out sample (jackknife method). using a combination of the 10 best biomarkers, 15 of 17 samples were correctly diagnosed. training the algorithm on time-resolved community profiles might provide a highly sensitive tool to detect the onset of periodontitis.

TI  == electrophoresis of periodontal pathogens in poly(ethyleneoxide) solutions with uncoated capillary.
AB  == periodontitis is a prevalent inflammatory disease caused by different species of  anaerobic bacteria such as porphyromonas gingivalis (p.g), treponema denticola (t.d), and tannerella forsythia (t.f). we compared the separation result of dna ladders in hydroxyethyl cellulose, poly(ethyleneoxide) (peo), and polyethylene glycol and analyzed the effect of polymer concentration, electric field, and temperature of the background electrolyte on the separation performance. results  demonstrated that there was a linear relationship (r=0.942) for 100 to 700bp of dna and its migration time. finally, the polymerase chain reaction products of p.g, t.d, and t.f were successfully identified within 8.5 min in 0.5% peo with uncoated capillary.

TI  == association between maternal periodontitis and preterm and/or low birth weight infants in normal pregnancies.
AB  == abstract objective: to relate the periodontal condition with the presence of periodontal bacteria in pregnant that had babies with preterm delivery or/and low weight at birth (ptlbw). methods: we recruited 134 pregnant women without systemic diseases attending at the gynaecology and obstetrics room, from maternal provincial hospital, cordoba, argentine. pregnant were grouped according to the international classification for a system of periodontal disease. a sample from periodontal pocket was extracted to identify porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), treponema denticola (td), tannerella forsythia (tf) prevotella intermedia (pi) and agreggatibacter actinomycemcomitans (aa). results: we identified 7 (5%) cases of children born underweight or preterm of mothers diagnosed with gingivitis, 6 (4%) in mild periodontitis and 4 (3%) in moderate periodontitis. we estimated that when pi and/or aa were not detected in the periodontal pockets of mothers, the infants had more than 129% chance of having normal birth weights (or 3.47 for pi and or and 2.29 for aa). the average age of the mothers who has ptlbw was 21 +/- 3.5. the age showed an association with ptlbw (p < 0.0008). conclusions: the  presences of periodontal pathogens in periodontal pockets from pregnant with different periodontal status would associate with ptlbw infants when the mothers  are young, and the normal term and normal birth weight infant are associated with the absence of periodonto bacteria like pi and aa.

TI  == prevalence of six periodontal pathogens in subgingival samples of italian patients with chronic periodontitis.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the subgingival prevalence of six periodontal pathogens in 352 italian patients with chronic periodontitis. possible correlations with clinical parameters, age, gender and smoking status were also investigated. at first visit a pooled subgingival plaque sample was obtained for each subject by using the paper-point method. the samples were processed and analysed according to a commercially available quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction assay (meridol(r) perio diagnostics, gaba international, switzerland). porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), treponema denticola (td), tannerella forsythia (tf), prevotella intermedia (pi), fusobacterium nucleatum (fn) and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (aa) were investigated.  fn resulted the most frequently detected (95%) while tf showed the highest load (12x105 cells/plaque sample). aa was the less represented bacteria for load and presence. bacterial load of pg, td, tf and fn showed a direct correlation to bleeding on probing (bop) and presence of suppuration (p=0.0001). the bacterial load was always directly correlated to probing pocket depth (ppd) (p=0.0001). among the investigated variables, ppd resulted the most important risk indicator  for periodontal pathogens. bop appeared as a risk indicator for td, tf, pg detection. few studies have described the microbiological pattern of chronic periodontal disease in the italian population. considering the different forms of periodontitis, similar investigations in other countries are needed to disclose any microbiological differences among populations, which may lead to more specific approaches to prevention and therapy.

TI  == occurrence of socransky red complex in pregnant women with and without periodontal disease.
AB  == purpose: to verify the presence of socransky red complex (porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola and tannerella forsythia) and p. intermedia using polymerase chain reaction (pcr) in periodontally healthy pregnant women and pregnant women with periodontal disease, as well as its relation to arterial blood pressure and capillary glycaemia. materials and methods: this case control  study included 86 pregnant women, including 50 pregnant women with healthy periodontium, 27 with gingivitis and 9 with periodontitis. arterial blood pressure and glycaemia were evaluated and recorded. clinical specimens from the gingival crevice or periodontal pockets were gathered with sterile absorbent paper cones. dna extraction was accomplished using the easy-dna kit test and the  presence of bacteria was detected by pcr with primers and specific probes for each microorganism. results: the arterial pressure of all pregnant women was found to be within normal levels and 51% presented with hyperglycaemia, these two variables were not associated with periodontal conditions and/or presence of microorganisms. socransky red complex was not present in pregnant women with healthy periodontium; however, it was present in pregnant women with gingivitis (3.7%) and in a higher percentage of pregnant women with periodontitis (33.3%). conclusion: socransky red complex was found only in cases of periodontal diseases and is not related to blood pressure and/or high levels of blood glucose.

TI  == the effect of conventional mechanical periodontal treatment on red complex microorganisms and clinical parameters in down syndrome periodontitis patients: a pilot study.
AB  == periodontal disease (pd) is induced by a complex microbiota, such as porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola (together called the red complex), which triggers intense inflammatory reaction. down syndrome (ds) individuals demonstrate a high prevalence of pd compared with those who are otherwise chromosomally normal (euploids). this pilot study aimed to evaluate the effect of non-surgical periodontal treatment in ds chronic periodontitis patients on clinical and microbiological parameters. patients with  chronic periodontitis, 23 ds and 12 euploids (control group), were submitted to non-surgical mechanical periodontal treatment, followed by maintenance for 45 days. clinical parameters after periodontal treatment were similar in diseased and healthy sites, independent of the genetic background. diseased sites of ds and control patients harbored similar levels of p. gingivalis and t. forsythia at baseline, but significantly higher levels of t. denticola were found in ds patients. increased levels of p. gingivalis at healthy sites were found in ds individuals. non-surgical periodontal therapy decreased the levels of red complex microorganisms and improved the tested clinical parameters of diseased sites in both groups. however, the levels of red complex bacteria were higher in diseased  sites of ds patients after the periodontal treatment. we conclude in this pilot study that, although the mechanical periodontal treatment seemed to be effective  in ds subjects over a short-term period, the red complex bacteria levels did not  decrease significantly in diseased sites, as occurred in controls. therefore, for ds patients, it seems that the conventional non-surgical periodontal therapy should be improved by utilizing adjuvants to reduce the presence of periodontopathogens.

TI  == role of porphyromonas gingivalis gingipains in multi-species biofilm formation.
AB  == background: periodontal diseases are polymicrobial diseases that cause the inflammatory destruction of the tooth-supporting (periodontal) tissues. their initiation is attributed to the formation of subgingival biofilms that stimulate  a cascade of chronic inflammatory reactions by the affected tissue. the gram-negative anaerobes porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola are commonly found as part of the microbiota of subgingival biofilms, and they are associated with the occurrence and severity of the disease. p. gingivalis expresses several virulence factors that may support its survival, regulate its communication with other species in the biofilm, or modulate the inflammatory response of the colonized host tissue. the most prominent of these virulence factors are the gingipains, which are a set of cysteine proteinases (either arg-specific or lys-specific). the role of gingipains in the biofilm-forming capacity of p. gingivalis is barely investigated. hence, this in vitro study employed a biofilm model consisting of 10 "subgingival" bacterial species, incorporating either a wild-type p. gingivalis strain or its derivative lys-gingipain and arg-gingipan isogenic mutants, in order to evaluate quantitative and qualitative changes in biofilm composition. results: following 64 h of biofilm growth, the levels of all 10 species were quantified by fluorescence in situ hybridization or immunofluorescence. the wild-type and the two gingipain-deficient p. gingivalis strains exhibited similar growth in their corresponding biofilms. among the remaining nine species, only the numbers of t. forsythia were significantly reduced, and only when the lys-gingipain mutant was present in the biofilm. when  evaluating the structure of the biofilm by confocal laser scanning microscopy, the most prominent observation was a shift in the spatial arrangement of t. denticola, in the presence of p. gingivalis arg-gingipain mutant. conclusions: the gingipains of p. gingivalis may qualitatively and quantitatively affect composition of polymicrobial biofilms. the present experimental model reveals interdependency between the gingipains of p. gingivalis and t. forsythia or t. denticola.

TI  == polymerase chain reaction as a prospect for the early diagnosis and prediction of periodontal diseases in adolescents.
AB  == aim: this study was to determine the markers representative of pathogenic periodontal microflora [prevotella intermedia (p.i), tannerella forsythia (t.f) [bacteroides forsythus], treponema denticola (t.d), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (a.a), porphyromonas gingivalis (p.g)] in the dental plaque of adolescents with various degrees of severity of periodontium inflammation. methods: forty-patients aged 15-16 years of age were examined using pma, cpi and  green-vermillion indices (muller 2001). the hygiene status of each patient was also determined using durr dental's vista proof intraoral camera (germany). the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) was performed using a biometra thermocycler to detect dna of pathogenic periodontal bacteria in dental plaque. results: all marker microorganisms (p.i. + t.f. + t.d. + a.a. + p.g.) were identified in patients diagnosed with periodontitis in dental plaque. a direct correlation between the level of oral hygiene and the severity of the pathological process in it was determined. it was found that the increase in the severity of the disease  was accompanied by increased pathogenic periodontal microflora in dental plaque.  conclusion: identification of periodontal pathogens in dental plaque by pcr greatly enhances the early diagnosis of cronic cattaral gingivitis (ccg) risk factors in adolescents, and allows for detailed analysis of the relation between  each factor and severity of the process. this method may be used for the diagnosis of periodontal diseases, prediction of their future course, and reasonable choice of antimicrobial therapy.

TI  == association between polycystic ovary syndrome, oral microbiota and systemic antibody responses.
AB  == polycystic ovary syndrome (pcos) is a hormonal disorder of women that not only is the leading cause of infertility but also shows a reciprocal link with oral health. this study aimed to investigate the hypothesis that the levels of putative periodontal pathogens in saliva and their antibody response in serum are elevated in pcos, compared to systemic health. a total of 125 women were included in four groups; 45 women with pcos and healthy periodontium, 35 women with pcos and gingivitis, 25 systemically and periodontally healthy women, 20 systemically  healthy women with gingivitis. salivary levels of seven putative periodontal pathogens were analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and serum antibody levels were analyzed by elisa. in women with pcos, salivary porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, streptococcus oralis and tannerella forsythia levels were higher than matched systemically healthy women,  particularly in the case of gingivitis. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and treponema denticola levels were similar among study groups. the presence of pcos  also enhanced p. gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and s. oralis serum antibody levels, when gingivitis was also present. gingival inflammation correlated positively with levels of the studied taxa in saliva, particularly in pcos. the presence of p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum in saliva also exhibited a strong positive correlation with the corresponding serum antibody levels. in conclusion, as an underlying systemic endocrine condition, pcos may quantitatively affect the composition of oral microbiota and the raised systemic response to selective members of this microbial community, exerting a confounding role in resultant gingival inflammation and periodontal health. the most consistent effect appeared to be exerted on p. gingivalis.

TI  == the presence of cariogenic and periodontal pathogens in the oral cavity of one-year-old infants delivered pre-term with very low birthweights: a case control study.
AB  == background: recently, the dental literature has focused mainly on the microbial colonization of healthy full-term infants and their mothers or caretakers. however, oral microbial acquisition by premature infants has not been adequately  investigated, and the correlation between pre-term birth and the presence of cariogenic and periodontal pathogens has not been determined. the aim of this study was to identify the presence and quantities of representative cariogenic and periodontal pathogens in the oral cavities of 12-month-old infants and compare the occurrence of these microbes between a cohort of pre-term infants with very low birthweights and a control cohort comprising full-term infants. methods: the research cohort was composed of 69 one-year-old infants, of whom 24  were born prematurely with very low birthweights and 45 of whom were carried to full term. information regarding the infants' gestational age, mode of delivery,  general health status, birthweight and antibiotic use were obtained from hospital records and through oral interviews. at 12 months of age, both groups of infants  were examined, and unstimulated saliva samples from the dorsum of the tongue and  dental plaque samples were collected. the microorganisms (streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus spp., actinomyces spp., aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, peptostreptococcus micros, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum) were identified and their quantities were evaluated using a pcr-based method. the chi-squared and fisher's factorial tests were used for the statistical evaluations. results: the infants had a high prevalence of cariogenic microbes and of fusosbacterium nucleatum and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. cariogenic microbes were detected in 91.7% of the very low birthweight infants and in all full-term infants. periodontal pathogens were present in 83% of the pre-term infants and in 96% of the full-term infants. a significant difference was found between the cohorts in terms of the presence of s. mutans. most of the  very low birthweight infants had negative values of this microbe, while the full-term infants had positive values. conclusions: this study confirms the early transmission of representative cariogenic and periodontal pathogens to the oral cavity of one-year-old infants and a higher prevalence of s. mutans in full-term  infants than in premature infants.

TI  == periodontal bacteria in human carotid atherothrombosis as a potential trigger for neutrophil activation.
AB  == objective: epidemiological, biological and clinical links between periodontal and cardiovascular diseases are now well established. several human studies have detected bacterial dna corresponding to periodontal pathogens in cardiovascular samples. intraplaque hemorrhage has been associated with a higher risk of atherosclerotic plaque rupture, potentially mediated by neutrophil activation. in this study, we hypothesized that plaque composition may be related to periodontal pathogens. methods: carotid culprit plaque samples were collected from 157 patients. macroscopic characterization was performed at the time of collection: presence of blood, lipid core, calcification and fibrosis. markers of neutrophil  activation released by carotid samples were quantified (myeloperoxidase or mpo, cell-free dna and dna-mpo complexes). pcr analysis using specific primers for porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcommitans, treponema denticola, prevotella intermedia and tannerella forsythia was used to detect dna  from periodontal pathogens in carotid tissues. in addition, bacterial lipopolysaccharide (lps) and immunoglobulins g against t. forsythia were quantified in atherosclerotic carotid conditioned medium. results: intraplaque hemorrhage was present in 73/157 carotid samples and was associated with neutrophil activation, reflected by the release of mpo, cell-free dna and mpo-dna complexes. lps levels were also linked to intraplaque hemorrhage but not with the neutrophil activation markers. seventy-three percent of the carotid samples were  positive for periodontal bacterial dna. furthermore, hemoglobin levels were associated with the detection of t. forsythia and neutrophil activation/inflammation markers. conclusion: this study suggests a potential role of periodontal microorganisms, especially t. forsythia, in neutrophil activation  within hemorrhagic atherosclerotic carotid plaques.

TI  == comparative genome analysis and identification of competitive and cooperative interactions in a polymicrobial disease.
AB  == polymicrobial diseases are caused by combinations of multiple bacteria, which can lead to not only mild but also life-threatening illnesses. periodontitis represents a polymicrobial disease; porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola and tannerella forsythia, called 'the red complex', have been recognized as the causative agents of periodontitis. although molecular interactions among the three species could be responsible for progression of periodontitis, the relevant genetic mechanisms are unknown. in this study, we uncovered novel interactions in comparative genome analysis among the red complex species. clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (crisprs) of t. forsythia might attack the  restriction modification system of p. gingivalis, and possibly work as a defense  system against dna invasion from p. gingivalis. on the other hand, gene deficiencies were mutually compensated in metabolic pathways when the genes of all the three species were taken into account, suggesting that there are cooperative relationships among the three species. this notion was supported by the observation that each of the three species had its own virulence factors, which might facilitate persistence and manifestations of virulence of the three species. here, we propose new mechanisms of bacterial symbiosis in periodontitis; these mechanisms consist of competitive and cooperative interactions. our results might shed light on the pathogenesis of periodontitis and of other polymicrobial  diseases.

TI  == dentilisin involvement in coaggregation between treponema denticola and tannerella forsythia.
AB  == periodontitis arises from a biofilm consisting of gram-negative anaerobic rods and spirochetes. porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia, termed the red complex, have been co-isolated with high frequency from chronic periodontitis lesions, and these microorganisms are thought to be major pathogens of the disease. coaggregation is an important strategy in the colonization of dental plaque biofilm by these bacteria. in the present study, we investigated the coaggregation of t. denticola strains with t. forsythia atcc 43037 by use of visual grading or spectrophotometry. t. denticola atcc 35405 coaggregated with t. forsythia, reaching a plateau at approximately 60 min. this  coaggregation was inhibited by heat treatment of t. denticola atcc 35405, but not of t. forsythia. disaccharides such as sucrose, maltose, and lactose inhibited coaggregation by approximately 50%. the coaggregation reaction varied among t. denticola strains. there was somewhat less coaggregation between t. denticola atcc 33520 and t. forsythia than between t. denticola atcc 35405 and t. forsythia, although this difference was not statistically significant; t. denticola atcc 33521 showed a trace level of coaggregation with t. forsythia. the magnitude of coaggregation among the three t. denticola strains was proportional  to their dentilisin activities. inactivation of dentilisin abolished coaggregation activity, but inactivation of the major outer sheath protein did not. in addition, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride did not affect coaggregation. these results indicate that dentilisin is involved indirectly in the coaggregation between t. denticola and t. forsythia, because its proteolytic activity is not required, possibly via ligand maturation.

TI  == periodontitis in rats induces systemic oxidative stress that is controlled by bone-targeted antiresorptives.
AB  == background: periodontitis is a chronic, polymicrobial inflammatory disease that degrades connective tissue and alveolar bone and results in tooth loss. oxidative stress has been linked to the onset of periodontal tissue breakdown and systemic  inflammation, and the success of antiresorptive treatments will rely on how effectively they can ameliorate periodontal disease-induced oxidative stress during oral infection. methods: rats were infected with polybacterial inoculum consisting of porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia, as an oral lavage every other week for 12 weeks. daily subcutaneous injections of enoxacin, bis-enoxacin, alendronate, or doxycycline were administered for 6 weeks after 6 weeks of polybacterial infection in rats. the serum levels of oxidative stress parameters and antioxidant enzymes, including glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, and catalase, were evaluated in each of the infected, treated, and sham-infected rats. results: rats infected with the periodontal pathogens displayed a five-fold increase in the oxidative stress index compared with controls as a result of increased levels of serum oxidants and decreases in total antioxidant activity. the overall decrease in antioxidant activity occurred despite increases in three important antioxidant enzymes, suggesting an imbalance between antioxidant macromolecules/small molecules production and antioxidant enzyme levels. surprisingly, the bone-targeted antiresorptives bis-enoxacin and alendronate inhibited increases in oxidative stress caused by periodontitis. bis-enoxacin, which has both antiresorptive and antibiotic activities, was more effective than alendronate, which acts only as an antiresorptive. conclusion: to the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate that the increased oxidative stress induced by periodontal infection in rats can be ameliorated by bone-targeted antiresorptives.

TI  == periodontopathogens and human beta-defensin-2 expression in gingival crevicular fluid from patients with periodontal disease in guangxi, china.
AB  == background and objective: periodontal diseases are often induced by periodontopathogens, which are always exposed to certain innate immune factors in gingival crevicular fluid, including human beta-defensin-2 (hbd-2). this study aims to investigate the relationship among periodontopathogens, clinical parameters and hbd-2 expression. material and methods: thirty-two healthy controls, 42 patients with chronic gingivitis and 95 patients with chronic periodontitis were recruited in guangxi, china. bleeding index, probing depth and clinical attachment level were measured for all teeth including mesiobuccal, buccal, disobuccal, mesiolingual, lingual, disolingual six sites of all patient.  gingival crevicular fluid samples were collected from the study sites. the prevalence and copy numbers (cn) of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola, tannerella  forsythia and total bacteria in gingival crevicular fluid were quantified by real-time pcr. the hbd-2 concentration in gingival crevicular fluid was measured  by elisa. results: both the prevalence and the cn of a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, t. denticola and t. forsythia were higher in patients with chronic periodontitis than in healthy controls and patients with chronic gingivitis; however, there was no significant difference in the prevalence of p. intermedia among the three study groups, and the highest cn was found in patients with chronic gingivitis, rather than in patients with chronic periodontitis. the loads of p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, t. denticola and total bacteria were positively  related to probing depth, bleeding index and clinical attachment level. the concentration of hbd-2 in gingival crevicular fluid was higher in patients with chronic gingivitis and in patients with chronic periodontitis than in healthy controls. in addition, the hbd-2 concentration was positively related to the cn of p. gingivalis, t. forsythia and total bacteria, as well as to bleeding index and probing depth. conclusion: the prevalence, composition and cn of periodontopathogens were closely related to the severity of periodontal disease,  and the red complex was related to the severity of clinical symptoms of periodontal diseases. the concentration of hbd-2 in gingival crevicular fluid from periodontal disease sites was higher than that in gingival crevicular fluid  from healthy sites, which suggests that hbd-2 expression might be up-regulated by periodontopathogens.

TI  == active invasion of porphyromonas gingivalis and infection-induced complement activation in apoe-/- mice brains.
AB  == periodontal disease is a polymicrobial inflammatory disease that leads to chronic systemic inflammation and direct infiltration of bacteria/bacterial components, which may contribute to the development of alzheimer's disease. apoe-/- mice were orally infected (n = 12) with porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, and fusobacterium nucleatum as mono- and polymicrobial infections. apoe-/- mice were sacrificed following 12 and 24 weeks of chronic infection. bacterial genomic dna was isolated from all brain tissues except for the f. nucleatum mono-infected group. polymerase chain reaction was performed using universal 16 s rdna primers and species-specific primer sets for each organism to determine whether the infecting pathogens accessed the brain. sequencing amplification products confirmed the invasion of bacteria into the brain during infection. the innate immune responses were detected using antibodies against complement activation products of c3 convertase stage and the  membrane attack complex. molecular methods demonstrated that 6 out of 12 apoe-/-  mice brains contained p. gingivalis genomic dna at 12 weeks (p = 0.006), and 9 out of 12 at 24 weeks of infection (p = 0.0001). microglia in both infected and control groups demonstrated strong intracellular labeling with c3 and c9, due to  on-going biosynthesis. the pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus in 4 out of 12 infected mice brains demonstrated characteristic opsonization with c3 activation  fragments (p = 0.032). these results show that the oral pathogen p. gingivalis was able to access the apoe-/- mice brain and thereby contributed to complement activation with bystander neuronal injury.

TI  == effect of repeated adjunctive antimicrobial photodynamic therapy on subgingival periodontal pathogens in the treatment of chronic periodontitis.
AB  == the aim of this study was to compare the effect of subgingival ultrasonic scaling followed by repeated (three times) antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (pdt), ultrasonic scaling alone (us), and scaling and root planing with hand instruments (srp) for initial periodontal treatment. twenty-seven non-smoking systemically healthy chronic periodontitis patients were included. residual pockets >/=4 mm deep and bleeding on probing were debrided either with srp, us alone, or us followed by a single episode of pdt during supportive periodontal treatment. probing pocket depth (ppd), bleeding on probing (bop), and clinical attachment level (cal) were monitored over 12 months. the presence of five periodontal pathogens in the pockets was determined by a commercially available micro-ident test. intergroup and intragroup statistical analysis was performed. all three treatments resulted in a significant clinical improvement. additional application of pdt to us failed to result in further improvement in terms of ppd reduction and cal gain. however, it resulted in a higher reduction of bop at 3 and 12 months comparing to us alone or srp (pdt from 25 to 13 and to 9 %, us from 23 to  16 and to 12 %, and srp from 17 to 10 and to 9 %, respectively). pdt reduced the  proportion of positive sites after 6 months for treponema denticola (td) significantly more effectively than us or srp (p < 0.0001). additionally, pdt resulted in a greater reduction of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (aa), tannerella forsythia (tf), and td in medium pockets (4-6 mm) (p < 0.02) and of td in deep pockets (>6 mm) compared to mechanical debridement alone (p < 0.05).

TI  == bioinformatic investigation of the cost management strategies of five oral microbes.
AB  == some amino acids are more energetically costly to synthesize de novo, therefore many microbes have evolved to regulate the metabolic expenditure of the cell and  reduce the energy burden of extracellular unrecyclable proteins. several oral bacterial species take up amino acids and peptides obtained from proteolysis of host proteins and hence do not rely only on de novo synthesis. the aim of this study was to investigate if five oral bacterial species implement cost management strategies to reduce the energy burden of extracellular unrecyclable proteins. since the relative de novo amino acid synthesis costs are proportional to the masses of the amino acids, the energy costs of producing proteins were assessed by calculating the mean amino acid mass for each protein. for porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, prevotella intermedia and  streptococcus sanguinis, the outer membrane/extracellular proteins are made up of a much larger percentage of lower average mass amino acids whereas cytoplasmic proteins are made up of a larger proportion of higher average mass amino acid residues. these results are consistent with the five oral bacterial species employing energy-saving mechanisms in the production of extracellular unrecyclable proteins. interestingly, the p. gingivalis and s. sanguinis genomes  exhibited significantly lower predicted mean amino acid masses compared with those of the genomes of the other three species, suggesting that this may provide them with an energy advantage with respect to protein biosynthetic cost.

TI  == quantitative analysis of classical and new putative periodontal pathogens in subgingival biofilm: a case-control study.
AB  == background and objectives: a number of species/phylotypes have been newly implicated as putative periopathogens. the objective of this study was to explore associations among classical and new pathogens in subgingival biofilm and to assess their relative importance to chronic periodontitis. material and methods:  pooled subgingival biofilm samples were obtained from 40 patients with chronic periodontitis and 40 healthy controls. taqman q-pcr assays were used to determine the absolute and relative counts of porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, parvimonas micra, filifactor alocis, oral synergistetes and oral tm7s. microbial associations were assessed using cluster analysis. different statistical models were used to explore associations between  microbial parameters and periodontitis. results: the median log and relative counts were lowest for tm7s (4.4 and 0.0016%, respectively) and highest for oral  synergistetes (7.2 and 1.4%, respectively). oral synergistetes clustered strongly with the red complex, particularly t. forsythia (100% rescaled similarity). all species/phylotypes except tm7s were significantly associated with periodontitis (mann-whitney test; p </= 0.005). however, p. gingivalis and f. alocis lost association after adjusting for confounders (ordinal regression). in receiving operator characteristic curve analysis, the log counts of oral synergistetes were the best markers of periodontitis (82.5% sensitivity and specificity), followed by those of t. forsythia, p. micra and t. denticola. in prediction analysis, however, p. micra was the only microbial predictor of periodontal parameters. conclusions: oral synergistetes are presented here as new members of the red complex, with relative importance to periodontitis exceeding that of the classical members. p. micra is shown as an important periodontal pathogen warranting more attention.

TI  == influence of the periodontal status on the initial-biofilm formation on titanium  surfaces.
AB  == background: dental implants will be exposed to a complex ecosystem once they are  placed in the oral cavity. the bacterial colonization and biofilm formation on these devices will depend not only on the physicochemical surface implant properties but also on the periodontal health conditions of the patients, as these devices are exposed. purpose: the aim of this study was to correlate the subgingival microbial profile with the composition of initial biofilm formed on different microstructured titanium (ti) surfaces. materials and methods: ten periodontitis and 10 periodontally healthy subjects were included in this study.  the subjects wore a removable acrylic device with four different fixed ti surfaces for 48 hours. microbial samples of subgingival plaque and the biofilm formed on each ti surface were individually analyzed by the checkerboard dna-dna  hybridization technique. results: despite the roughness or hydrophilicity of the  ti surfaces, a characteristic pattern of bacterial adhesion was observed on each  of the study groups. however, significant differences in the proportion of the species that colonized the ti surfaces were found between the periodontitis and periodontally healthy groups. treponema denticola, neisseria mucosa, eikenella corrodens, and tannerella forsythia were detected in higher proportions on the ti disks placed in the periodontitis subjects, while significant higher proportions  of capnocytophaga sputigena, fusobacterium periodonticum, prevotella melaninogenica, and streptococcus mitis were detected on the ti disks placed in the periodontally healthy group. conclusions: the results obtained in this study  shows that the composition and the proportion of the species that initially colonize ti surfaces are highly influenced by the periodontal status more than the surface characteristics of the ti implant.

TI  == colonisation of gingival epithelia by subgingival biofilms in vitro: role of "red complex" bacteria.
AB  == objectives: biofilm formation on tooth surface results in colonisation and invasion of the juxtaposed gingival tissue, eliciting strong inflammatory responses that lead to periodontal disease. this in vitro study investigated the  colonisation of human gingival multi-layered epithelium by multi-species subgingival biofilms, and evaluated the relative effects of the "red complex" species (porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola). methods: the grown biofilm consisted of fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, veillonella dispar, p. gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, t. forsythia, t. denticola, actinomyces oris, streptococcus anginosus and streptococcus oralis, or its variant lacking the "red complex". after 48h in co-culture with the gingival epithelia, the bacterial species in the biofilm were quantified, whereas their localisation on the cell surface was investigated by combining confocal-laser scanning microscopy (clsm) and fluorescence in situ hybridisation  (fish), as well as by scanning electron microscopy (sem). results: exclusion of the "red complex" quantitatively affected s. oralis, but not other species. the "red-complex" species were all able to colonise the gingival epithelial cells. a  co-localisation trend was observed between p. gingivalis and t. denticola, as determined by fish. however, in the absence of all three "red complex" bacteria from the biofilm, an immense colonisation of streptococci (potentially s. oralis) was observed on the gingival epithelia, as confirmed by both clsm and sem. conclusions: while the "red complex" species synergise in colonizing gingival epithelia, their absence from the biofilm enhances streptococcal colonisation. this antagonism with streptococci reveals that the "red complex" may regulate biofilm virulence, with potential implications in periodontal pathogenesis.

TI  == oral inflammation, tooth loss, risk factors, and association with progression of  alzheimer's disease.
AB  == periodontitis is a polymicrobial chronic inflammatory disease of tooth-supporting tissues with bacterial etiology affecting all age groups, becoming chronic in a subgroup of older individuals. periodontal pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola are implicated in the development of a number of inflammatory pathologies at remote organ sites, including alzheimer's disease (ad). the initial inflammatory hypothesis proposed that ad hallmark proteins were the main contributors of central nervous system (cns) inflammation. this hypothesis is expanding to include the role of infections, lifestyle, and genetic and environmental factors in the pathogenesis of ad. periodontal disease (pd) typifies a condition that encompasses all of the above factors including pathogenic bacteria. these bacteria not only are the source of  low-grade, chronic infection and inflammation that follow daily episodes of bacteremia arising from everyday tasks such as brushing, flossing teeth, chewing  food, and during dental procedures, but they also disseminate into the brain from closely related anatomical pathways. the long-term effect of inflammatory mediators, pathogens, and/or their virulence factors, reaching the brain systemically or otherwise would, over time, prime the brain's own microglia in individuals who have inherent susceptibility traits. such susceptibilities contribute to inadequate neutralization of invading agents, upon reaching the brain. this has the capacity to create a vicious cycle of sustained local inflammatory milieu resulting in the loss of cytoarchitectural integrity and vital neurons with subsequent loss of function (deterioration in memory). the possible pathways between pd and ad development are considered here, as well as environmental factors that may modulate/exacerbate ad symptoms.

TI  == expression and regulation of triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 1 in  periodontal diseases.
AB  == periodontitis is an inflammatory infectious disease that destroys the tooth-supporting tissues. it is caused by multi-species subgingival biofilms that colonize the tooth surface. porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola and tannerella forsythia (i.e. 'red complex' bacteria) are characteristic subgingival biofilm species. the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 1 (trem-1) is a cell surface receptor of the immunoglobulin superfamily, with a role in the amplification of proinflammatory cytokine production during infection. this study aimed to investigate trem-1 mrna expression in gingival tissues from patients with chronic periodontitis, generalized aggressive periodontitis and healthy subjects and its correlation with the levels of periodontal pathogens in the tissue. a further aim was to investigate the regulation of trem-1 in human monocytic cells (mm6) challenged with an in-vitro subgingival biofilm model. gingival tissue trem-1 expression was increased in both chronic and aggressive periodontitis, compared to health, and correlated with the levels of the 'red complex' species in the tissue. no significant differences were detected between  the two forms of periodontitis. biofilm-challenged mm6 cells exhibited higher trem-1 expression and secretion compared to controls, with partial involvement of the 'red complex'. engagement or inhibition of trem-1 affected the capacity of the biofilms to stimulate interleukin (il)-1beta, but not il-8, secretion by the  cells. in conclusion, this study reveals that trem-1 tissue expression is enhanced in periodontal disease, and correlates with the level of periodontal pathogens. it also provides a mechanistic insight into the regulation of trem-1 expression and the associated il-1beta production in biofilm-challenged monocytes.

TI  == internal bacterial colonization of implants: association with peri-implant bone loss.
AB  == objectives: the aim of the present longitudinal study was to investigate bacterial colonization of the internal implant cavity and to evaluate a possible  association with peri-implant bone loss. methods: a total of 264 paper point samples were harvested from the intra-implant cavity of 66 implants in 26 patients immediately following implant insertion and after 3, 4, and 12 months. samples were evaluated for aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola,  and tannerella forsythia as well as total bacterial counts by real-time pcr. bone loss was evaluated on standardized radiographs up to 25 months after implant insertion. for the statistical analysis of the data, mixed effects models were fitted. results: there was an increase in the frequency of detection as well as in the mean counts of the selected bacteria over time. the evaluation of the target bacteria revealed a significant association of pr. intermedia at 4 and 12  months with peri-implant bone loss at 25 months (4 months: p = 0.009; 12 months:  p = 0.021). conclusions: the present study could demonstrate a progressive colonization by periodontopathogenic bacteria in the internal cavities of two-piece implants. the results suggest that internal colonization with pr. intermedia was associated with peri-implant bone loss.

TI  == relationship between expression of human gingival beta-defensins and levels of periodontopathogens in subgingival plaque.
AB  == background and objective: human beta-defensins (hbds) are a group of antimicrobial peptides important in epithelial innate immunity, and their differential expression is associated with periodontal diseases. the aim of this  study was to explore relationships among hbds, total subgingival bacteria and periodontopathogens in healthy subjects and in patients with chronic periodontitis. material and methods: the periodontal clinical parameters of 29 healthy subjects and 25 patients with chronic periodontitis were recorded. the relative expression of hbd1, hbd2 and hbd3 genes in gingival biopsies was measured using real-time pcr. the numbers of total bacteria and of treponema denticola, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum and tannerella forsythia in subgingival plaque were quantified by real-time pcr. data were analyzed using the mann-whitney u-test and spearman's rank correlation test. results: no significant differences in expression of the hbd genes were found between the group of healthy subjects and  the group of patients with chronic periodontitis. total bacteria and t. denticola were detected in all participants. f. nucleatum and t. forsythia were detected in all patients with chronic periodontitis and in 86.21% and 51.72%, respectively, of healthy volunteers. p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans were detected in 24.14% and 17.24%, respectively, of the healthy group and in 84.00% and 12.00%, respectively, of the chronic periodontitis group. the prevalence of all bacteria, except a. actinomycetemcomitans, was significantly higher in the group  of patients with chronic periodontitis than in the group of healthy subjects (p < 0.05). a significant, negative correlation was observed between total bacteria and hbd-2 (r = -0.384, p = 0.011). upon analyzing the data in different groups, total bacteria and hbd-2 were significantly correlated (r = -0.492, p = 0.026) only in the group of healthy subjects. conclusion: the negative correlations between hbd-2 and total bacteria, especially in the group of healthy subjects, indicate that hbds may play an important role by limiting an increase of bacterial load at the initial stage of periodontitis.

TI  == epstein-barr virus associated peri-implantitis: a split-mouth study.
AB  == objectives: herpesviral-bacterial synergism may play a potential role in periodontitis and peri-implantitis (pi) etiopathogenesis. pi lesions can worsen depending on specific microbial challenge and host susceptibility. this cross-sectional split-mouth study aimed to substantiate herpesviral-bacterial co-infection in pi patients and assess associations with periodontopathogen salivary contamination. methods: pcr-based identification was performed on 23 patients presenting pi and contralateral healthy implants, and compared to unstimulated whole saliva. clinical evaluation included probing depths, bleeding  on probing, and suppuration. radiographs were assessed for the presence of lamina dura and bone loss. three sample sites per patient were tested: pi lesions, healthy implant sulci, and saliva. quantitative pcr evaluated epstein-barr virus  (ebv) and cytomegalovirus (cmv) copy counts. significance of group comparisons for binary-dependent variables, within-subjects designs, was determined by mcnemar's chi-square test. risk analysis was evaluated through odds ratios (or).  results: pi lesions were 14.2 (p = 0.001; 95 % confidence interval [ci], 1.6-124.1) and 3 times (p = 0.03; 95 % ci, 0.7-11.9) more likely to harbor ebv than healthy implants and saliva, respectively. ebv positive predictive value was 90 %. pi was associated with absence of lamina dura and higher periodontopathogen proportions. saliva sampling showed high agreement with pi bacterial detection (89-100 % rate) but not with ebv (44.4 %). the or of pi lesions harboring treponema denticola or tannerella forsythia was 6.79 (p = 0.007; 95 % ci, 1.8-25.0) and 3.3 (p < 0.0001; 95 % ci, 0.3-34.3) times higher than healthy implants, respectively. saliva of patients with pi was 5.6 times more likely to be contaminated with prevotella nigrescens than healthy peri-implant sulci (p = 0.002). pi lesions were 1.92 times more likely to harbor prevotella nigrescens than healthy implants (p = 0.04). conclusions: ebv is a potential candidate in peri-implantitis etiopathogenesis. saliva pcr analysis is useful in predicting peri-implantitis-specific bacterial infection but not ebv or cmv. clinical significance: herpesviral-bacterial synergism may favor ongoing microbial challenge in peri-implant disease and exacerbate its progression. ebv infection may explain non-responsive to treatment pi. peri-implantitis individuals may benefit from antiviral therapy.

TI  == porphyromonas gingivalis: major periodontopathic pathogen overview.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis is a gram-negative oral anaerobe that is involved in the pathogenesis of periodontitis and is a member of more than 500 bacterial species  that live in the oral cavity. this anaerobic bacterium is a natural member of the oral microbiome, yet it can become highly destructive (termed pathobiont) and proliferate to high cell numbers in periodontal lesions: this is attributed to its arsenal of specialized virulence factors. the purpose of this review is to provide an overview of one of the main periodontal pathogens-porphyromonas gingivalis. this bacterium, along with treponema denticola and tannerella forsythia, constitute the "red complex," a prototype polybacterial pathogenic consortium in periodontitis. this review outlines porphyromonas gingivalis structure, its metabolism, its ability to colonize the epithelial cells, and its  influence upon the host immunity.

TI  == genetic characteristics and pathogenic mechanisms of periodontal pathogens.
AB  == periodontal disease is caused by a group of bacteria that utilize a variety of strategies and molecular mechanisms to evade or overcome host defenses. recent research has uncovered new evidence illuminating interesting aspects of the virulence of these bacteria and their genomic variability. this paper summarizes  some of the strategies utilized by the major species - aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, and porphyromonas gingivalis - implicated in the pathogenesis of periodontal disease. whole-genome sequencing of 14 diverse a. actinomycetemcomitans strains has revealed variations in their genetic content (ranging between 0.4% and 19.5%) and organization. strikingly, isolates from human periodontal sites showed no genomic changes during persistent colonization. t. forsythia manipulates the cytokine responses of macrophages and monocytes through its surface glycosylation. studies have revealed that bacterial surface-expressed o-linked glycans modulate t-cell responses during periodontal inflammation. periodontal pathogens belonging to the "red complex" consortium express neuraminidases, which enables them to scavenge sialic acid from host glycoconjugates. analysis of recent data has demonstrated that the cleaved sialic acid acts as an important nutrient for bacterial growth and a molecule for the decoration of bacteria surfaces to help evade the host immune attack. in addition, bacterial entry into host cells is also an important  prerequisite for the lifestyle of periodontal pathogens such as p. gingivalis. studies have shown that, after its entry into the cell, this bacterium uses multiple sorting pathways destined for autophagy, lysosomes, or recycling pathways. in addition, p. gingivalis releases outer membrane vesicles which enter cells via endocytosis and cause cellular functional impairment.

TI  == assessment of periodontal and opportunistic flora in patients with peri-implantitis.
AB  == aim: to assess the presence of periodontal and opportunistic organisms in patients with peri-implantitis. material and methods: thirty-three partially edentulous subjects (22 women, 11 men), aged 32-90 years, who had one or more implants with peri-implantitis were included. peri-implantitis was defined as: (i) the presence of bleeding on probing and/or suppuration and (ii) radiographic  images showed marginal bone loss >1.8 mm after 1 year in function. criteria for inclusion were: (i) partially edentulous patients having at least one implant diagnosed with peri-implantitis; (ii) no antibiotic therapy for 6 months prior to clinical examination. following this definition, a total of 48 implants were diagnosed with peri-implantitis. subgingival bacterial samples were obtained with sterile paper points from infected implants and selected teeth of each individual. periodontopathogens (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola) were detected by multiplex pcr targeting 16s rdna. samples were placed in reduced transport medium and cultured for opportunistic pathogens  (staphylococcus aureus, enteric bacteria, pseudomonas and yeasts). results: twenty-two patients yielded positive results for p. gingivalis, 25 for t. forsythia, eight for p. intermedia and 13 for t. denticola. none of the patients  yielded a positive result for a. actinomycetemcomitans. non-periodontal species were found in five patients (15% of total). p. aeruginosa was found in four (12%) patients, and c. albicans (3%) and s. aureus in one patient (3%) each. in two cases of peri-implantitis, none of the periodontal or opportunistic microorganisms studied were detected in either implant or tooth samples. when results of the periodontopathic bacteria from the implant and tooth samples of the same patient were compared, 18 patients (54%) showed the same results for both samples and 15 (45%) patients different results. conclusions: the implant surface may be colonized with pathogens different from periodontal bacteria. opportunistic pathogens such as p. aeruginosa, s. aureus and c. albicans may be associated with implant failure.

AB  == background: a polymerase chain reaction (pcr)-based method has been used to identify oral anaerobic pathogens in biofilms on voice prostheses. the purpose of the present study was to determine the location of those pathogens inside the biofilms. methods: biofilms of 15 voice prostheses were sampled and used to identify the oral pathogens. fluorescence in situ hybridization was applied on smears made on glass slides and on sections of intact biofilms visualized by confocal laser scanning microscopy (clsm). results: fusobacterium nucleatum (f. nucleatum) was the most frequently detected pathogen and the only tested species  detected in microcolonies. the other microbes (parvimonas micra [p. micra], porphyromonas gingivalis [p. gingivalis], tannerella forsythia [t. forsythia], and treponema denticola [t. denticola]) were not detected or only detected as single cells. clsm analysis showed that f. nucleatum resided on the biofilm surface. conclusion: although detectable, oral anaerobic pathogens seem to be no  more than passers-by that adhere without further observed proliferation and apparently play no striking role in biofilm formation on voice prostheses.

TI  == bis-enoxacin blocks rat alveolar bone resorption from experimental periodontitis.
AB  == periodontal diseases are multifactorial, caused by polymicrobial subgingival pathogens, including porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia. chronic periodontal infection results in inflammation, destruction of connective tissues, periodontal ligament, and alveolar bone resorption, and ultimately tooth loss. enoxacin and a bisphosphonate derivative of enoxacin (bis-enoxacin) inhibit osteoclast formation and bone resorption and also contain antibiotic properties. our study proposes that enoxacin and/or bis-enoxacin may be useful in reducing alveolar bone resorption and possibly bacterial colonization. rats were infected with 10(9) cells of polymicrobial inoculum consisting of p. gingivalis, t. denticola, and t. forsythia, as an oral  lavage every other week for twelve weeks. daily subcutaneous injections of enoxacin (5 mg/kg/day), bis-enoxacin (5, 25 mg/kg/day), alendronate (1, 10 mg/kg/day), or doxycycline (5 mg/day) were administered after 6 weeks of polymicrobial infection. periodontal disease parameters, including bacterial colonization/infection, immune response, inflammation, alveolar bone resorption,  and systemic spread, were assessed post-euthanasia. all three periodontal pathogens colonized the rat oral cavity during polymicrobial infection. polymicrobial infection induced an increase in total alveolar bone resorption, intrabony defects, and gingival inflammation. treatment with bis-enoxacin significantly decreased alveolar bone resorption more effectively than either alendronate or doxycycline. histologic examination revealed that treatment with bis-enoxacin and enoxacin reduced gingival inflammation and decreased apical migration of junctional epithelium. these data support the hypothesis that bis-enoxacin and enoxacin may be useful for the treatment of periodontal disease.

TI  == subgingival plaque sampling after combined mechanical and antibiotic nonsurgical  periodontal therapy.
AB  == aim: this study aimed to make a comparison of two sampling strategies of subgingival plaque after combined mechanical-antibiotic periodontal therapy. methods: thirty patients (18 female) suffering from aggressive (n = 12) or generalised severe chronic (n = 18) periodontitis were included. aggregatibacter  actinomycetemcomitans had been detected subgingivally in all prior to anti-infective therapy (at) and combined mechanical-antibiotic at had been rendered. after at clinical examinations were performed and subgingival plaque was sampled from the same four sites as prior to at (aspre) as well as from the four deepest sites after at (deep). per patient two pooled samples (aspre/deep) were generated and analysed for a. actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola using a commercial 16s rrna test. results: aspre failed to detect a. actinomycetemcomitans, deep detected a. actinomycetemcomitans only in two patients (7 %). only for t. forsythia deep (53 %) provided higher detection frequencies than aspre (27 %; p = 0.005). detection frequencies of p. gingivalis and t. denticola ranged from 47 to 53 %. conclusion: after combined mechanical-antibiotic at sampling the deepest sites revealed higher detection rates. combined mechanical-antibiotic at suppresses a. actinomycetemcomitans to a higher extent than p. gingivalis, t. forsythia and t. denticola.

TI  == transcriptional responses of treponema denticola to other oral bacterial species.
AB  == the classic organization by socransky and coworkers categorized the oral bacteria of the subgingival plaque into different complexes. treponema denticola, porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythia are grouped into the red complex that is highly correlated with periodontal disease. socransky's work closely associates red with orange complex species such as fusobacterium nucleatum and prevotella intermedia but not with members of the other complexes.  while the relationship between species contained by these complexes is in part supported by their ability to physically attach to each other, the physiological  consequences of these interactions and associations are less clear. in this study, we employed t. denticola as a model organism to analyze contact-dependent  responses to interactions with species belonging to the same complex (p. gingivalis and t. forsythia), the closely associated orange complex (using f. nucleatum and p. intermedia as representatives) and the unconnected yellow complex (using streptococcus sanguinis and s. gordonii as representatives). rna was extracted from t. denticola alone as well as after pairwise co-incubation for 5 hrs with representatives of the different complexes, and the respective gene expression profiles were determined using microarrays. numerous genes related to  motility, metabolism, transport, outer membrane and hypothetical proteins were differentially regulated in t. denticola in the presence of the tested partner species. further analysis revealed a significant overlap in the affected genes and we identified a general response to the presence of other species, those specific to two of the three complexes as well as individual complexes. most interestingly, many predicted major antigens (e.g. flagella, msp, ctlp) were suppressed in responses that included red complex species indicating that the presence of the most closely associated species induces immune-evasive strategies. in summary, the data presented here provide an in-depth understanding of the transcriptional responses triggered by contact-dependent interactions between microorganisms inhabiting the periodontal pocket.

TI  == 16s rdna-based metagenomic analysis of dental plaque and lung bacteria in patients with severe acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
AB  == background and objective: acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (ae-copd) are leading causes of mortality in hospital intensive care units. we sought to determine whether dental plaque biofilms might harbor pathogenic bacteria that can eventually cause lung infections in patients with severe ae-copd. material and methods: paired samples of subgingival plaque biofilm and tracheal aspirate were collected from 53 patients with severe ae-copd. total bacterial dna was extracted from each sample individually for polymerase chain reaction amplification and/or generation of bacterial 16s rdna sequences and cdna libraries. we used a metagenomic approach, based on bacterial  16s rdna sequences, to compare the distribution of species present in dental plaque and lung. results: analysis of 1060 sequences (20 clones per patient) revealed a wide range of aerobic, anaerobic, pathogenic, opportunistic, novel and uncultivable bacterial species. species indistinguishable between the paired subgingival plaque and tracheal aspirate samples (97-100% similarity in 16s rdna  sequence) were dental plaque pathogens (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, capnocytophaga sputigena, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola) and lung pathogens (acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and streptococcus pneumoniae). real-time polymerase chain reaction of 16s rdna indicated lower levels of pseudomonas aeruginosa and porphyromonas gingivalis colonizing the dental plaques compared with the paired tracheal aspirate samples. conclusion: these results support the  hypothesis that dental bacteria may contribute to the pathology of severe ae-copd.

TI  == periodontal disease associated with red complex bacteria in dogs.
AB  == objective: red complex bacteria (treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia and porphyromonas gingivalis) play a major role in the aetiology of periodontal disease in humans. this study was designed to evaluate the association of such bacteria with periodontal disease in dogs. methods: seventy-three subgingival samples taken from dogs ranging from 2 months to 12 years (median age 4 years) were tested for red complex bacteria using a polymerase chain reaction assay. results: thirty-six of 73 (49 . 3%) dogs were found to be positive for t. forsythia and p. gingivalis. dogs with gingivitis or periodontitis were more likely to be infected with t. forsythia and p. gingivalis [odds ratio (or) 5 . 4  (confidence interval (ci) 1 . 9-15 . 6), p = 0 . 002] than healthy animals. only  3 (4 . 1%) of 73 samples were positive for red complex bacteria, but the association with periodontal disease was not significant. conclusion and clinical relevance: the results indicate that involvement of red complex bacteria in periodontal disease in dogs is similar to that observed in humans. only the concurrent presence of t. forsythia and p. gingivalis were correlated to periodontal disease in dogs in this study.

TI  == periodontal bacteria in the genital tract: are they related to adverse pregnancy  outcome?
AB  == one of the most important factors implicated in preterm birth (ptb) is acute genitourinary tract infection. the bacteria causing chronic periodontal inflammation include gram-negative rods and anaerobes similar to those found in women with bacterial vaginosis. the aim of this prospective study is to investigate the relationship between oral and vaginal microflora and preterm low  birth weight. real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to detect both the presence and level of six periodontitis-related species: aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (aa), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), tannerella forsythia (tf), treponema denticola (td), fusobacterium nucleatum ssp(fn), and prevotella intermedia (pi) for both oral samples of subgingival plaque and cervical samples, obtained from 80 patients, during gynaecological examinations. the more representative oral pathogen (less than 60 percent) species in oral samples of preterm and term group were tf, td, and fn. 24.4 percent of pregnant women presented periodontal pathogens in vaginal swab; the most representative species  with a percentage over 0.1 percent of total bacteria in genital tract of preterm  group were tf, td, and piwith a positive correlation (less than 0.5). the presence of the bacterium t. denticolain the vagina, regardless of the amount, adversely affects preterm delivery.

TI  == the effects of different orthodontic appliances upon microbial communities.
AB  == objectives: orthodontic appliances can promote accumulation of dental plaque, with associated enamel decalcification or gingival inflammation. the aim of this  study was to examine longer-term microbiological changes during orthodontic treatment with fixed appliances. materials and methods: twenty-four orthodontic patients aged 11-14 years undergoing fixed appliance therapy were recruited into  the study. each was randomized for cross-mouth assignment of molar bands and bonded molar tubes to contralateral quadrants of the mouth. all patients received self-ligating brackets, but again using randomization, one upper lateral incisor  bracket (left or right) also received an elastomeric ligature. plaque samples from the molars and upper lateral incisors were obtained at intervals during treatment and up to 1 year after appliance removal. denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and 16s rdna microarray were used to compare plaque microbial fingerprints. results: plaque populations changed within 3 months of commencing treatment at all sites. the greatest differences in plaque composition were seen  with self-ligating brackets with an elastomeric ligature. post-treatment plaque associated with both types of molar attachment contained increased levels of periodontal pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and eubacterium nodatum, while campylobacter rectus, parvimonas micra, and actinomyces odontolyticus were also elevated with bonds. conclusions: the results suggest that orthodontic treatment may cause sustained changes in plaque microbiotas and that molar bond-associated plaque may have raised disease potential.

TI  == impact of early colonizers on in vitro subgingival biofilm formation.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the impact of early colonizing species on the structure and the composition of the bacterial community developing in a subgingival 10-species biofilm model system. the model included streptococcus oralis, streptococcus anginosus, actinomycesoris, fusobacterium nucleatum subsp.  nucleatum, veillonella dispar, campylobacter rectus, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola. based on literature, we considered streptococcus oralis, streptococcus anginosus, and actinomyces oris as early colonizers and examined their role in the biofilms by either a delayed addition to the consortium, or by not inoculating at all the biofilms with these species. we quantitatively evaluated the resulting biofilms by real-time quantitative pcr and further compared the structures using confocal  laser scanning microscopy following fluorescence in situ hybridisation. the absence of the early colonizers did not hinder biofilm formation. the biofilms reached the same total counts and developed to normal thickness. however, quantitative shifts in the abundances of individual species were observed. in the absence of streptococci, the overall biofilm structure appeared looser and more dispersed. moreover, besides a significant increase of p. intermedia and a decrease of p. gingivalis , p. intermedia appeared to form filamented long chains that resembled streptococci. a. oris, although growing to significantly higher abundance in absence of streptococci, did not have a visible impact on the biofilms. hence, in the absence of the early colonizers, there is a pronounced effect on p. intermedia and p. gingivalis that may cause distinct shifts in the structure of the biofilm. streptococci possibly facilitate the establishment of p. gingivalis into subgingival biofilms, while in their absence p. intermedia became more dominant and forms elongated chains.

TI  == interleukin-8 responses of multi-layer gingival epithelia to subgingival biofilms: role of the "red complex" species.
AB  == periodontitis is an infectious inflammatory disease that results in the destruction of the tooth-supporting (periodontal) tissues. the gram-negative anaerobic species porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola, (also known as the "red complex" species) are highly associated with subgingival biofilms at periodontitis-affected sites. a major chemokine produced  by the gingival epithelium in response to biofilm challenge, is interleukin (il)-8. the aim of this in vitro study was to investigate the relative effect of  the "red complex" species as constituents of subgingival biofilms, on the regulation of il-8 by gingival epithelia. multi-layered organotypic human gingival epithelial cultures were challenged with a 10-species in vitro subgingival biofilm model, or its 7-species variant, excluding the "red complex". il-8 gene expression and secretion analyses were performed by qpcr and elisa, respectively. after 3 h, both biofilms up-regulated il-8 gene expression, but the presence of the "red complex" resulted in 3-fold greater response. il-8 secretion was also up-regulated by both biofilms, with no differences between them. after 24 h, the 10-species biofilm reduced il-8 secretion to 50% of the control, but this was not affected when the "red complex" was absent. in conclusion, as part of biofilms, "red complex" species differentially regulate il-8 in gingival epithelia, potentially affecting the chemotactic responses of the tissue.

TI  == biology and pathogenesis of cytomegalovirus in periodontal disease.
AB  == human periodontitis is associated with a wide range of bacteria and viruses and with complex innate and adaptive immune responses. porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, treponema denticola, cytomegalovirus and other herpesviruses are major suspected pathogens of periodontitis, and a combined herpesvirus-bacterial periodontal infection can potentially explain major clinical features of the disease. cytomegalovirus infects periodontal macrophages and t-cells and elicits a release of interleukin-1beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. these proinflammatory cytokines play an important role in the host defense against the virus, but they  also have the potential to induce alveolar bone resorption and loss of periodontal ligament. gingival fibroblasts infected with cytomegalovirus also exhibit diminished collagen production and release of an increased level of matrix metalloproteinases. this article reviews innate and adaptive immunity to cytomegalovirus and suggests that immune responses towards cytomegalovirus can play roles in controlling, as well as in exacerbating, destructive periodontal disease.

TI  == oral hygiene reinforcement in the simplified periodontal treatment of 1 hour.
AB  == aim: to compare the clinical and microbiological outcome of the 1-h ultrasonic debridement of chronic periodontitis patients (cpp) with and without frequent sessions of oral hygiene reinforcement. methods: clinical measurements and subgingival plaque were collected from 44 cpp at baseline, 3- and 6-months. the control group received a single session of 1-h full-mouth ultrasonic debridement, while oral hygiene instructions (ohi) were reiterated over four visits. in the test group, ohi were limited in the 1-h treatment session. at 3-months, both groups received additional debridement and ohi. the "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridization technique quantified porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola in plaque. results: at three months, smaller reductions in plaque and bleeding indices, and in p. gingivalis numbers were noted in the test group, while these differences disappeared at six months. after the 3-month  re-treatment visit, the test group presented with a greater probing pocket depth  (ppd) reduction. plaque negatively affected ppd in a similar manner after both treatment approaches. conclusions: lack of oral hygiene reinforcement in the 1-h  full-mouth debridement resulted in higher plaque and bleeding scores and numbers  of p. gingivalis at three months; professional removal of dental biofilm every three months is beneficial in subjects with compromised plaque control.

TI  == oxantel disrupts polymicrobial biofilm development of periodontal pathogens.
AB  == bacterial pathogens commonly associated with chronic periodontitis are the spirochete treponema denticola and the gram-negative, proteolytic species porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythia. these species rely on complex  anaerobic respiration of amino acids, and the anthelmintic drug oxantel has been  shown to inhibit fumarate reductase (frd) activity in some pathogenic bacteria and inhibit p. gingivalis homotypic biofilm formation. here, we demonstrate that  oxantel inhibited p. gingivalis frd activity with a 50% inhibitory concentration  (ic50) of 2.2 mum and planktonic growth of t. forsythia with a mic of 295 mum, but it had no effect on the growth of t. denticola. oxantel treatment caused the  downregulation of six p. gingivalis gene products and the upregulation of 22 gene products. all of these genes are part of a regulon controlled by heme availability. there was no large-scale change in the expression of genes encoding metabolic enzymes, indicating that p. gingivalis may be unable to overcome frd inhibition. oxantel disrupted the development of polymicrobial biofilms composed  of p. gingivalis, t. forsythia, and t. denticola in a concentration-dependent manner. in these biofilms, all three species were inhibited to a similar degree,  demonstrating the synergistic nature of biofilm formation by these species and the dependence of t. denticola on the other two species. in a murine alveolar bone loss model of periodontitis oxantel addition to the drinking water of p. gingivalis-infected mice reduced bone loss to the same level as the uninfected control.

TI  == microbial analysis of subgingival plaque samples compared to that of whole saliva in patients with periodontitis.
AB  == background: the detection of special bacterial species in patients with periodontitis is considered to be useful for clinical diagnosis and treatment. the collection of subgingival plaque samples is the common way for the determination of periodontopathic bacteria. however, recently, salivary analysis  has been discussed as an advantageous future diagnostic method for periodontitis  because it offers simple quantitative sampling and the possibility to assess various bacteria. the aim of this cross-sectional study is to investigate whether there is a correlation between the results of different bacterial species in saliva and subgingival plaque samples from individuals with aggressive periodontitis (agp) and chronic periodontitis (cp). methods: whole saliva and subgingival plaque samples from the deepest pocket of each quadrant were collected from 43 patients with cp and 33 patients with agp. twenty different bacterial species from both samplings were determined by the 16s ribosomal rna-based polymerase chain reaction with microarray technique. results: all bacterial species were detected in salivary and subgingival plaque samples. for aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia, as well as actinomyces viscosus, campylobacter rectus/showae, prevotella intermedia, parvimonas micra, eubacterium nodatum, and campylobacter gracilis, a significant positive correlation between salivary and subgingival plaque samples was detected in patients with both types  of periodontitis. there were no significant differences in bacteria in salivary and subgingival plaque samples between agp and cp. conclusion: salivary analysis  might be discussed as a potential alternative to subgingival plaque sampling for  microbiologic analysis in both agp and cp.

TI  == porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola synergistic polymicrobial biofilm development.
AB  == chronic periodontitis has a polymicrobial biofilm aetiology and interactions between key bacterial species are strongly implicated as contributing to disease  progression. porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola and tannerella forsythia have all been implicated as playing roles in disease progression. p. gingivalis cell-surface-located protease/adhesins, the gingipains, have been suggested to be involved in its interactions with several other bacterial species. the aims of this study were to determine polymicrobial biofilm formation by p. gingivalis, t. denticola and t. forsythia, as well as the role of p. gingivalis gingipains in biofilm formation by using a gingipain null triple mutant. to determine homotypic and polymicrobial biofilm formation a flow cell system was employed and the biofilms imaged and quantified by fluorescent in situ hybridization using dna species-specific probes and confocal scanning laser microscopy imaging. of the three species, only p. gingivalis and t. denticola formed mature, homotypic biofilms, and a strong synergy was observed between p. gingivalis and t. denticola in polymicrobial biofilm formation. this synergy was  demonstrated by significant increases in biovolume, average biofilm thickness and maximum biofilm thickness of both species. in addition there was a morphological  change of t. denticola in polymicrobial biofilms when compared with homotypic biofilms, suggesting reduced motility in homotypic biofilms. p. gingivalis gingipains were shown to play an essential role in synergistic polymicrobial biofilm formation with t. denticola.

TI  == molecular microbiological evaluation of subgingival biofilm sampling by paper point and curette.
AB  == the present clinical study aimed to investigate if there are differences in microbiological outcomes dependent on the subgingival biofilm collection method.  subgingival biofilm samples were collected from the four deepest pockets (>5 mm)  of 17 patients with aggressive periodontitis (agp) and 33 patients with chronic periodontitis (cp), first by paper point and thereafter by curette. samples obtained with the same method were pooled together from each patient and forwarded for molecular microbiological analysis by a commercially available assay (iai pado test 4.5) that estimates total bacterial load and levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. data analysis included frequency of detection, quantification and correlation of detection levels between the two sampling methods. p. gingivalis, t. forsythia and t. denticola were detected in >90% of the samples, and their detection levels exhibited a strong correlation between sampling methods. the detection consistency of a. actinomycetemcomitans was 56% between the two sampling methods. a. actinomycetemcomitans was more readily detected by paper point compared with curette collection with a stronger  correlation between the two methods in agp. subgingival biofilm sampling by curette or paper point does not yield differences in the detection of the three 'red complex' species. however, a. actinomycetemcomitans was more consistently detected by means of paper point collection, which can be crucial in the decision to administer antibiotics as an adjunctive periodontal treatment.

AB  == aim: the aim of the present study was to analyze the occurrence of porphyromonas  gingivalis (p. gingivalis), tannerella forsythia (t. forsythia), treponema denticola (t. denticola), and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (a. actinomycetemcomitans) in patients with diabetes. methods: periodontal and diabetic parameters and subgingival biofilm samples were obtained from 60 patients with diabetes and 62 patients without diabetes. by using polymerase chain reaction, the prevalence of red complex microorganisms (p. gingivalis, t. forsythia, and t. denticola) and a. actinomycetemcomitans were determined. descriptive and non-parametric statistical analyses between groups were performed (kruskal-wallis, mann-whitney u-test, and fisher's exact test). results: patients with diabetes presented significantly higher periodontal attachment loss levels compared to patients without diabetes. red complex microorganisms were detected in lower frequencies in patients with diabetes. the detection of a. actinomycetemcomitans was higher in patients with diabetes and periodontitis compared to systemically-healthy patients without periodontitis (p < 0.05). p. gingivalis was associated with periodontitis in non-diabetic patients (p < 0.05), whereas a. actinomycetemcomitans was associated with periodontitis in diabetic patients (p < 0.05). conclusions: the findings of the present study indicate that there might be differences in the subgingival microbiota between diabetic and non-diabetic patients. in addition, p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans were associated with periodontitis in patients without diabetes and patients with diabetes, respectively.

TI  == characterization of periodontal biofilm in down syndrome patients: a comparative  study.
AB  == the aim of this study was to characterize the main periodontal bacterial species  in down syndrome (ds) patients with and without periodontitis. method: this cross-sectional study involved 75 ds patients, 45 with and 30 without periodontitis. informed consent, health and dental questionnaires and periodontitis diagnosis were performed pcr and lamp assays were performed on subgingival dental plaque sample. results: tannerella forsythia was the most frequent bacteria detected in the group with and without periodontitis (95.5 and  63.3%) followed by treponema denticola (88.8 and 50%) and porphyromonas gingivalis (53.3 and 25% respectively). there were statistical differences between groups (p < 0.05). pg fima type i was the most frequent porphyromonas gingivalis genotype. two different sets of primers (aa-f/aa-r and ltx3/ltx4) were used to detect aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and different frequencies were obtained, (68% and 14.6% respectively), they had a weak correlation (cohen kappa = 0.16). after sequencing of pcr products, ltx3/ltx4 showed more specificity. jp2 clone of a. actinomycetemcomitans was not detected in any sample. conclusions: the composition of oral biofilm is fundamental for the development of periodontal disease independently of immunological alterations associated with ds. the frequency of detection of a. actinomycetemcomitans reported in the literature has a wide range, because the primers and probes applied

TI  == multilevel analysis of bacterial counts from chronic periodontitis after root planing/scaling, surgery, and systemic and local antibiotics: 2-year results.
AB  == aim: to follow changes (over 2 years) in subgingival bacterial counts of five microbial complexes including health-related actinomyces spp. in deeper pockets (>/=5 mm) after periodontal treatments. methods: eight different treatments were  studied: (1) scaling+root planing (srp); (2) periodontal surgery (surg)+systemic  amoxicillin (amox)+systemic metronidazole (met); (3) surg+locally delivered tetracycline (tet); (4) surg; (5) amox+met+tet; (6) amox+met; (7) tet; and (8) surg+amox+met+tet. antibiotics were given immediately following srp. subgingival  plaque was collected mesiobuccally from each tooth, except third molars, from 176 subjects, completing the study, at baseline, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months post-treatment and analysed for 40 different bacteria using checkerboard hybridization. a negative binomial (nb) generalized estimating equation (nb gee)  model was used to analyze count data and a logistic gee was used for proportions. results: we observed short-term beneficial changes in the composition of the red  complex of up to 3 months by treating subjects with amox+met+tet. similar short-term improvements with the same treatment were observed for tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola of the red complex. surg had also short-term beneficial effect on porphyromonas gingivalis. no periodontal treatments applied  to severely affected sites promoted the growth of actinomyces. smoking elevated counts of both the red and orange complex while bleeding on probing (bop) and gingival redness were also predictors of more red complex counts. comparatively similar findings were obtained by analyzing counts and by analyzing proportions.  conclusions: although short-term reductions in the counts of the red complex were observed in sites that were treated with amox+met+tet, long-term significant effects were not observed with any of the eight treatments. poor oral hygiene in  patients with severe chronic periodontitis diminished the beneficial effects of treatment.

TI  == quantification of key periodontal pathogens in insulin-dependent type 2 diabetic  and non-diabetic patients with generalized chronic periodontitis.
AB  == periodontitis is a common problem in patients with diabetes mellitus (dm), however, differences in the putative periodontal pathogens in subjects with dm compared to non-dm subjects are still inconclusive. the red complex, which includes porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia, encompasses the most important pathogens in adult periodontal disease. the aim of the present study was to compare cell numbers of p. gingivalis, t. denticola, t.  forsythia and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans in gingival sulcus of healthy, gingivitis and periodontitis sites of non-diabetes mellitus (ndm), controlled and poorly controlled insulin-dependent dm (cdm and pdm) patients with generalized chronic periodontitis. subgingival plaque samples were collected from 19 cdm, 19 pdm and 19 ndm patients. taqman real time-pcr was used to determine bacterial cell number. at subject level, the quantity of red complex bacteria was significantly higher in pdm than those of ndm and positively correlated with hba1c. at site level (total 342 sites), cell numbers of t. denticola and t. forsythia in healthy sites of cdm and pdm were significantly higher than those of ndm. in gingivitis sites, the numbers of p. gingivalis in cdm and pdm and t. forsythia in pdm were significantly higher than those of ndm while in periodontitis sites, higher quantity of p. gingivalis in pdm was observed. our study indicated that poor glycemic control is associated with increasing cell numbers of red complex bacteria in subgingival biofilm.

TI  == pathogen levels and clinical response to periodontal treatment in patients with interleukin 8 haplotypes.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of non-surgical treatment of  periodontitis on the levels of periodontopathogens and clinical parameters in patients with different genetic backgrounds produced by polymorphisms in the interleukin (il8) gene. thirty patients grouped according to il8 atc/ttc or agt/ttc haplotypes were submitted to non-surgical periodontal treatment. levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola were determined in 240 subgingival plaque samples by qpcr. the association between il8 haplotypes and the levels of periodontopathogens and clinical parameters was investigated by multilevel analysis accounting for the clustering of diseased sites analyzed within patients. it was observed that neither levels of periodontopathogens nor non-surgical treatment was associated with the il8 haplotype. the clinical parameters after periodontal treatment were similar in diseased and healthy sites, independently of the il8 haplotype. nonetheless, in the same period, diseased sites of agt/ttc patients harbored higher levels of p.  gingivalis, t. denticola, t. forsythia, and red complex than those of atc/ttc patients. however, the non-surgical periodontal therapy decreased the levels of these periodontopathogens and of the tested clinical parameters of diseased sites in both groups. non-surgical therapy is equally effective in improving clinical parameters and decreasing the levels of periodontopathogens, independent of the genotype groups produced by the il8 haplotype.

TI  == [detection of periodontal pathogens from saliva of type 2 diabetic patients in urban area of beijing].
AB  == objective: to investigate the prevalence of periodontal pathogens from saliva of  patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (t2dm), and to characterize the association between the glucose status and periodontal pathogens in oral cavity.  methods: all the subjects were hypertension patients under regular care at beijing hypertension prevention and management institute. whole unstimulated saliva samples were collected from 45 non-diabetic subjects (non-dm group), 80 well-controlled diabetic patients (dm-well group) and 100 poor-controlled diabetic patients (dm-poor group). dna was extracted from the salivary deposition, porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), tannerella forsythia (tf) and treponema denticola (td) were detected by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) method  based on 16srrna. prevalence and quantity of the pathogens under different glucose states were compared and logistic regression model was set to analyze the factors related to each bacterium. results: the prevalence of tf in dm-well group and dm-poor group was significantly lower than that of non-dm group [81% (65/80), 80% (80/100) vs 91% (41/45), p = 0.048], meanwhile the quantity of tf was also lower than that of non-dm group [1.9(2.6), 2.1(5.3) vs 3.4(6.4)] (p > 0.05). with the worsening of glucose control, the quantity of tf was declining (p = 0.032). however, the prevalence and the quantity of pg, td in 3 groups had no statistical differences (p > 0.05). after adjusting age, gender, number of missing teeth and  other periodontal parameters, or of having tf in saliva from dm-well group and dm-poor group was 0.58 and 0.53, respectively. conclusions: abnormal blood glucose state may affect the colonization of tf in oral cavity.

TI  == periodontopathogens levels and clinical response to periodontal therapy in individuals with the interleukin-4 haplotype associated with susceptibility to chronic periodontitis.
AB  == periodontitis is an inflammatory disease that results from an interaction between dental biofilm agents and the host immune-inflammatory response. periodontopathogenic organisms, such as porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola, as well as the host's susceptibility, represented by the host's genetic makeup, are the key factors that influence this complex disease. recently, we identified haplotypes in the il4 gene that were associated with chronic periodontitis (cp). this study aimed to evaluate whether  subjects with different il4 haplotypes (tci/cci and ttd/cti) would be differentially colonized by periodontopathogens and whether they would respond differently to non-surgical periodontal therapy. thirty-nine patients carrying the il4 haplotype of genetic susceptibility to cp (il4+) or protection against cp (il4-) were evaluated. those groups were further subdivided into individuals with cp (cp il4+ or cp il4-) and those that were periodontally healthy (h) (h il4+ or  h il4-). cp patients were submitted to non-surgical periodontal therapy. clinical and microbiological analyses were performed considering the data at baseline and  45 and 90 days after periodontal therapy. periodontopathogens levels were evaluated by absolute quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qpcr). the baseline data revealed that the total levels of periodontopathogens were higher in the cp  il4+ than in the cp il4- groups. clinical analyses revealed that the periodontal  therapy was equally effective, independent of the subject's il4 genetic load. the tci/cci il4 haplotype, previously associated with genetic susceptibility to cp, was also associated with increased levels of periodontopathogenic bacteria, but this genetic background did not influence the response to non-surgical periodontal treatment.

TI  == clinical, microbiologic, and host response characteristics in patients with peri-implant mucositis.
AB  == purpose: to analyze the clinical, microbiologic, and host response characteristics (interleukins 1beta and 6) in the peri-implant sulcus fluid (pisf) of patients with healthy dental implants and with peri-implant mucositis.  materials and methods: clinical parameters (modified gingival index [mgi], modified plaque index [mpi], probing pocket depth [ppd], and absence or presence  of radiologic bone loss) were recorded, and pisf samples were obtained from peri-implant sites showing mucositis as well as healthy sites. the periodontopathogenic bacteria tannerella forsythia (tf), treponema denticola (td), and porphyromonas gingivalis (pg) were evaluated, together with the total bacterial load (tbl) and the interleukin (il) 1beta and il-6 values. results: the study population consisted of 34 individuals, and 77 dental implants were evaluated during the study (23 mucositis and 54 healthy peri-implant sites). the  mgi, mpi, and ppd scores of the peri-implant mucositis group were significantly greater than in the healthy group. no differences in detection frequency were found for putative periodontal pathogens and tbl between the healthy peri-implant sites and mucositis sites. the mucositis group showed a significantly greater expression of il-6 than the healthy group (p < .05). although il-1beta was increased in the mucositis group, there was no statistically significant difference versus the healthy implant group. conclusions: an analysis was made of the clinical, microbiologic, and host response characteristics in implants with peri-implant mucositis, establishing comparisons with healthy implants. in the patients studied, bacterial plaque induced an inflammatory response that can lead to the development of peri-implant mucositis. adequate plaque control is therefore able to increase peri-implant health, avoiding the risk of future complications. no specific association to the studied bacterial species was established.

TI  == clinical evaluation of salivary periodontal pathogen levels by real-time polymerase chain reaction in patients before dental implant treatment.
AB  == objective: periodontal pathogens in dental plaque are the main causative agents of periodontitis and peri-implantitis. detection of the presence of such periodontal pathogens early would serve as a useful tool in the diagnosis and treatment of this disease. therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate whether the periodontal pathogen levels in saliva were correlated with the periodontal status of patients receiving implant treatment. materials and methods: a total of 291 patients visiting tokyo dental college chiba hospital were divided into four groups: a no-periodontitis (np) group, a mild-periodontitis (mip) group, a moderate-periodontitis (mop) group, and a severe-periodontitis (sp) group. the levels of the following five periodontal pathogens in saliva were evaluated using real-time polymerase chain reaction: porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, and prevotella intermedia. results: the levels of p. gingivalis and t. forsythia were significantly higher in mop group than in np  group (p < 0.05). the levels of all periodontal pathogens tested except a. actinomycetemcomitans were significantly higher in sp group than in np group (p < 0.05). conclusion: the detection levels of the periodontal pathogens targeted in  saliva samples were correlated with the periodontal status. this suggests that using saliva to screen for periodontopathic bacteria offers an easier-to-use clinical tool than the paper point method in the diagnosis and treatment of periodontitis and peri-implantitis.

TI  == periodontopathogen profile of healthy and oral lichen planus patients with gingivitis or periodontitis.
AB  == oral lichen planus (olp) is a chronic inflammatory disease that is frequently detected in oral tissues. the aim of our study was to identify the prevalence of  the detection of periodontopathogenic microorganisms (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola in olp patients and to compare with  this prevalence of periodontopathogenic microorganisms in healthy non-olp patients. our study included 27 (18 chronic periodontitis (olpp) and 9 gingivitis (olpg)) patients diagnosed with olp along with 26 (13 chronic periodontitis (hp)  and 13 gingivitis (hg)) healthy non-olp patients. the multiplex polymerase chain  reaction (pcr) with subsequent reverse hybridization method (micro-ident) was used for identifying periodontopathogenic microorganisms present in subgingival plaque samples. the percentages of detection for a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, t. forsythia and t. denticola in subgingival plaque samples taken from olp patients (olpg and olpp) were 18.5%, 85.1%, 81.4%, 88.8% and 74%, respectively. meanwhile, in the non-olp patients (hg and hp), these values were 7.6%, 50%, 46.1%, 73% and 57.7%, respectively. thus, comparing the non-olp groups with the olp groups, the periodontopathogens' percentages of detection in the olp groups were higher than those in the non-olp groups. according to our study results, olp patients have higher levels of infection with a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, t. forsythia and t. denticola than non-olp patients. we argue that the high percentages in patients with olp may help identify the importance of periodontopathogenic microorganisms  in the progress of periodontal diseases of olp.

TI  == isolation of treponema and tannerella spp. from equine odontoclastic tooth resorption and hypercementosis related periodontal disease.
AB  == reasons for performing study: red complex bacteria, i.e. porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola and tannerella forsythia, are involved in the onset and progression of periodontal disease in man, yet seldom inhabit the oral  cavity of healthy individuals. periodontal disease is also encountered in horses, with equine odontoclastic tooth resorption and hypercementosis (eotrh) constituting a particular form of disease. however, only little is known about the oral microbiome of healthy and periodontitis-affected equids. objective: we aimed to test the hypothesis that red complex bacteria are also associated with eotrh-related periodontal disease. study design: controlled cross-sectional study. methods: we screened dna purified from crevicular fluid derived from 23 eotrh-affected and 21 disease-free horses for the presence of treponema spp., tannerella spp. and porphyromonas gingivalis dna by polymerase chain reaction. subsequently, amplified dna was bidirectionally sequenced and identified via blast analysis. results: treponema and/or tannerella dna was detected in 100% of  periodontitis-related samples and in 52.2% of dna derived from healthy horses. twenty-six amplicon sequences were 98-100% homologous to published bacterial sequences, which mostly corresponded to treponema pectinovorum, oral treponema clones ju025 and omz 840, and tannerella forsythia. p. gingivalis dna was only found in 3 eotrh-related samples. forty-three amplicon sequences revealed weaker  homologies ranging between 80% and 97% to known treponema or tannerella strains,  partly because of their heterogeneity, partly because they obviously represented  so far unknown types. conclusions: this is the first report in which known and novel treponema and tannerella spp. were isolated in association with eotrh-related periodontal disease.

TI  == porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola and toll-like receptor 2 are associated with hypertensive disorders in placental tissue: a case-control study.
AB  == aim(s): to explore the associations between the presence of periodontal pathogens and the expression of toll-like receptors (tlr-2 and tlr-4) in the placental tissue of patients with hypertensive disorders compared to the placentas of healthy normotensive patients. material and methods: a case-control study was performed. from a cohort composed of 126 pregnant women, 33 normotensive healthy  pregnant women were randomly selected, and 25 cases of patients with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, including gestational hypertension and pre-eclampsia, were selected. placental biopsy was obtained after aseptic placental collection at the time of delivery. all of the samples were processed and analysed for the detection of porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, treponema denticola and tannerella forsythia using the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) technique. determination of the expressions of tlr-2 and tlr-4 was performed in samples of total purified protein isolated from  placental tissues and analysed by elisa. the data were assessed using descriptive statistics. the associations among variables were estimated through multiple logistic regression models and the mann-whitney test to evaluate the differences  between the two groups. results: a significant increase was observed in the expression of tlr-2 in the placentas of patients with hypertensive disorders (p = 0.04). additionally, the multiple logistic regression models demonstrated an association between the presence of t. denticola and p. gingivalis in placental tissues and hypertensive disorders (or: 9.39, p = 0.001, ci 95% 2.39-36.88 and or: 7.59, p = 0.019, ci 95% 1.39-41.51, respectively). conclusions: in the present study, pregnant women with periodontal disease presented an association in the placental tissue between the presence of t. denticola and p. gingivalis and hypertensive disorders. additionally, increased expression of tlr-2 was observed. however, further studies are required to determine the specific roles of periodontal pathogens and tlrs in the placental tissue of patients with pregnancy-related hypertensive disorders.

TI  == determining the presence of periodontopathic virulence factors in short-term postmortem alzheimer's disease brain tissue.

AB  == chronic periodontitis (cp) is considered to be a multifactorial disease influenced by microbial and genetic factors. the aim of the present study was to  investigate whether the genetic susceptibility to cp in individuals with the il8  atc/ttc haplotype is associated with subgingival levels of periodontopathogens. sixty-five individuals, grouped according to the presence (n = 28) or absence (n  = 37) of the il8 haplotype, were evaluated. after clinical periodontal evaluation, each group was subdivided according to the presence (cp) or absence (h) of periodontitis. four subgingival samples were obtained from cp and two samples per subject from h patients. the levels and proportions of porphyromonas  gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola were analyzed using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (q-pcr). no differences were found in the proportion of periodontopathogenic bacteria between groups with the  presence or absence of the il8 haplotype. however, in the cp groups, the levels of periodontopathogens were significantly higher in the individuals without the il8 haplotype than in the individuals with the il8 haplotype. these results suggest that periodontal destruction may occur in patients who are considered to  be genetically susceptible to cp with a lower microbial challenge because of the  presence of the il8 atc/ttc haplotype than in patients without this haplotype.

TI  == evaluation of periodontal pathogens in amniotic fluid and the role of periodontal disease in pre-term birth and low birth weight.
AB  == background: pre-term birth and/or low birth weight (ptlbw) is a serious problem in developing countries. the absence of known risk factors in approximately 50% of ptlbw cases has resulted in a continued search for other causes. the aim of this study was to examine the effect of periodontitis on pregnancy outcomes. methods: samples were taken from 50 pregnant women who underwent amniocentesis. polymerase chain reaction was performed on amniotic fluid samples obtained during amniocentesis and on subgingival plaque samples to determine the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia,  campylobacter rectus and eikenella corrodens. plaque index, gingival index, bleeding on probing, probing depth and clinical attachment level were evaluated.  medical records were obtained after birth. results: social and demographic variables were similar among the gingivitis (g), localized periodontitis (lp) and generalized periodontitis (gp) groups. four subjects gave birth to ptlbw neonates. campylobacter rectus, t. forsythia, p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum were detected in the amniotic fluid and subgingival plaque samples of three patients who gave birth to ptlbw neonates. the amniotic fluid sample from the fourth patient was not positive for any of the tested pathogens. conclusion: these findings suggest that the transmission of some periodontal pathogens from the oral cavity of the mother may cause adverse pregnancy outcomes. the results contribute to an understanding of the association between periodontal disease and ptlbw, but further studies are required to better clarify the possible relationship.

TI  == detection of oral bacterial dna in synovial fluid.
AB  == objectives: as periodontal bacteria might be involved in the aetiology of rheumatic diseases, we analysed synovial fluid obtained from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (ra) and controls for the presence of dna of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola. methods: in all, 42 patients suffering from ra (mean age 53.8 +/- 16.7 years, 40.4% females) and 114 controls  with no rheumatic diseases (mean age 56.1 +/- 15.2 years, 52.4% females) were included. dna from synovial fluid was isolated by qiaamp kit (qiagen, hilden, germany). polymerase chain reactions (pcrs) specific for the 16s rrna genes of the above specified bacteria were developed. subgingival bacterial colonization was analysed using micro-ident((r)) test (hain-diagnostik, nehren, germany). results: in patients with ra dna of p. gingivalis was detected in synovial fluid  more often than in controls (15.7% versus 3.5%, p = 0.045). more patients than controls harboured dna from p. gingivalis in both, oral plaque and synovial fluid (11.9% versus. 0.9%, p = 0.030). among the patients group the number of missing teeth was correlated with the number of joints with movement restrictions caused  by ra. conclusions: dna of periodontopathogens can be found in synovial fluid and oral bacteria may play a role in the pathogenesis of arthritis.

TI  == cluster of bacteria associated with peri-implantitis.
AB  == background: information on the microbiota in peri-implantitis is limited. we hypothesized that neither gender nor a history of periodontitis/smoking or the microbiota at implants differ by implant status. materials and methods: baseline  microbiological samples collected at one implant in each of 166 participants with peri-implantitis and from 47 individuals with a healthy implant were collected and analyzed by dna-dna checkerboard hybridization (78 species). clinical and radiographic data defined implant status. results: nineteen bacterial species were found at higher counts from implants with peri-implantitis including aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter gracilis, campylobacter rectus, campylobacter showae, helicobacter pylori, haemophilus influenzae, porphyromonas gingivalis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus anaerobius, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus mitis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, and treponema socranskii (p < .001). receiver operating characteristic curve analysis identified t. forsythia, p. gingivalis, t. socranskii, staph. aureus, staph. anaerobius, strep. intermedius, and strep. mitis in peri-implantitis comprising 30% of the total microbiota. when adjusted for gender (not significant [ns]), smoking status (ns), older age (p = .003), periodontitis  history (p < .01), and t. forsythia (likelihood ratio 3.6, 95% confidence interval 1.4, 9.1, p = .007) were associated with peri-implantitis. conclusion: a cluster of bacteria including t. forsythia and staph. aureus are associated with  peri-implantitis.

TI  == subgingival aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans associates with the risk of coronary artery disease.
AB  == aim: we investigated the association between angiographically verified coronary artery disease (cad) and subgingival aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola. materials and methods: the cross-sectional study population (n = 445) comprised 171 (38.4%) patients with stable cad, 158 (35.5%) with acute coronary syndrome (acs) and 116  (26.1%) with no significant cad (no cad). all patients participated in clinical and radiological oral health examinations. pooled subgingival bacterial samples were analysed by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization assays. results: in all study groups, the presence of p. gingivalis, t. forsythia and t. denticola indicated a  significant (p </= 0.001) linear association with the extent of alveolar bone loss (abl), but a. actinomycetemcomitans did not (p = 0.074). with a threshold level of bacterial cells 1 x 10(5) a. actinomycetemcomitans was significantly more prevalent in the stable cad group (42.1%) compared to the no cad group (30.2%) (p = 0.040). in a multi-adjusted logistic regression analysis using this  threshold, a. actinomycetemcomitans positivity associated with stable cad (or 1.83, 95% ci 1.00-3.35, p = 0.049), but its level or levels of other bacteria did not. conclusions: the presence of subgingival a. actinomycetemcomitans associates with an almost twofold risk of stable cad independently of alveolar bone loss.

TI  == polymicrobial infection with major periodontal pathogens induced periodontal disease and aortic atherosclerosis in hyperlipidemic apoe(null) mice.
AB  == periodontal disease (pd) and atherosclerosis are both polymicrobial and multifactorial and although observational studies supported the association, the  causative relationship between these two diseases is not yet established. polymicrobial infection-induced periodontal disease is postulated to accelerate atherosclerotic plaque growth by enhancing atherosclerotic risk factors of orally infected apolipoprotein e deficient (apoe(null)) mice. at 16 weeks of infection,  samples of blood, mandible, maxilla, aorta, heart, spleen, and liver were collected, analyzed for bacterial genomic dna, immune response, inflammation, alveolar bone loss, serum inflammatory marker, atherosclerosis risk factors, and  aortic atherosclerosis. pcr analysis of polymicrobial-infected (porphyromonas gingivalis [p. gingivalis], treponema denticola [t. denticola], and tannerella forsythia [t. forsythia]) mice resulted in detection of bacterial genomic dna in  oral plaque samples indicating colonization of the oral cavity by all three species. fluorescent in situ hybridization detected p. gingivalis and t. denticola within gingival tissues of infected mice and morphometric analysis showed an increase in palatal alveolar bone loss (p<0.0001) and intrabony defects suggesting development of periodontal disease in this model. polymicrobial-infected mice also showed an increase in aortic plaque area (p<0.05) with macrophage accumulation, enhanced serum amyloid a, and increased serum cholesterol and triglycerides. a systemic infection was indicated by the detection of bacterial genomic dna in the aorta and liver of infected mice and elevated levels of bacterial specific igg antibodies (p<0.0001). this study was a unique effort to understand the effects of a polymicrobial infection with p. gingivalis, t. denticola and t. forsythia on periodontal disease and associated atherosclerosis in apoe(null) mice.

TI  == clinical and microbiological results following nonsurgical periodontal therapy with or without local administration of piperacillin/tazobactam.
AB  == objectives: we assessed if adjunct administration of piperacillin/tazobactam added clinical and microbiological treatment benefits. materials and methods: thirty-six subjects (mean age 52.1 years (sd +/- 10.3)) (ns by group) with chronic periodontitis were randomly enrolled receiving subgingival debridement and the local administration of piperacillin/tazobactam (test group) or debridement alone (control group). bleeding on probing (bop), probing pocket depth (ppd), and microbiological counts of 74 species were studied by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization up to month 6 after treatment. results: mean ppd changes between baseline and month 6 in the test and control groups were 1.5  and 1.8 mm, respectively (ns between groups). bop in both groups decreased from about 80 to 40 %. at 4 and 12 weeks, lower counts of the following bacteria were  found in the test group (site level): fusobacterium species, parvimonas micra, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, and a composite load of nine pathogens (p < 0.001). at week 26, subjects receiving local antibiotics had a lower prevalence at tested sites for fusobacterium nucleatum sp. polymorphum, fusobacterium periodonticum, p. micra, and t. denticola. conclusions: at 26 weeks, treatment with or without piperacillin/tazobactam resulted in similar bop and ppd improvements. at week 26  and at the subject level, the prevalence of 4/74 pathogens was found at lower counts in the group receiving local antibiotics. clinical relevance: administration of piperacillin/tazobactam reduces the prevalence of fusobacterium, p. micra, and t. denticola to a greater extent than debridement alone but with no short-term differences in ppd or bop.

TI  == validation of a quantitative real-time pcr assay and comparison with fluorescence microscopy and selective agar plate counting for species-specific quantification  of an in vitro subgingival biofilm model.
AB  == background and objective: subgingival biofilms are the prime etiological factor of periodontal disease. owing to their complex polymicrobial nature, quantification of individual bacterial species within the biofilm for research and diagnostic purposes can be methodologically challenging. the aims of this study were to establish a quantitative real-time pcr (qpcr) assay to quantify the bacteria used in our 10-species in vitro 'subgingival' biofilm model and to compare the quantitative outcome with fluorescence microscopy and colony-forming  unit (cfu) counts on selective agar plates. material and methods: the 10 species  included in the in vitro biofilm were streptococcus oralis, streptococcus anginosus, veillonella dispar, fusobacterium nucleatum, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, actinomyces oris, campylobacter rectus, porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia. the numbers of each species were quantified at two time points using qpcr, microscopy counting following fluorescence in-situ hybridization (fish) or immunofluorescence staining, and counting of cfus after growth on selective agar plates. results: all 10 species were successfully quantified using qpcr and fish or immunofluorescence, and the eight species culturable on selective agar plates were also quantified by counting the numbers  of cfus after growth on selective agar. in early biofilm cultures, all methods showed a significant correlation, although the absolute numbers differed between  methods. in late biofilm cultures, measurements obtained using qpcr and fish or immunofluorescence, but not by cfu counts, maintained significant correlation. cfu counts yielded lower values than did measurements made using the other two methods. conclusion: quantitative pcr and epifluorescence microscopy can be easily combined with each other to determine species-specific bacterial numbers within biofilms. however, conventional bacterial cultures cannot be as efficiently combined using these molecular detection methods. this may be crucial in designing and selecting appropriate clinical diagnostic methods for subgingival biofilm samples.

AB  == numerous publications have reported the presence of periodontopathogenic bacteria in peripheral and central vascular lesions. however, it is unclear how this bacterial translocation occurs. the objective of this study was to investigate whether periodontopathic bacteria are translocated to lymph nodes proximal to the oral cavity. obtaining lymph node samples is not ethically feasible unless they are excised as part of the surgical management of patients with cancer. this study analyzed formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded lymph nodes, histologically negative for cancer cell invasion, that were excised from 66 patients with histories of head and neck cancer. real-time pcr was performed to amplify the 16s ribosomal dna fragments from porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythia, and prevotella intermedia. the relationship between bacterial detection and cancer severity, gender, and the use of anti-cancer therapy was examined by fisher's exact test. p. gingivalis, t. forsythia, and p. intermedia were present in 17%, 8%, and 8% of the samples of submandibular and submental lymph nodes, respectively. there were  no significant relationships between bacterial detection and the cancer disease status, patient gender or use of anticancer therapy. according to these data, it  appears that the translocation of periodontopathic bacteria may occur via lymphatic drainage, irrespective of the cancer disease status, gender or anticancer therapy.

TI  == boric acid irrigation as an adjunct to mechanical periodontal therapy in patients with chronic periodontitis: a randomized clinical trial.
AB  == background: the purpose of this single-masked, randomized, controlled clinical trial was to evaluate the effects of boric acid irrigation as an adjunct to scaling and root planing (srp) on clinical and microbiologic parameters and compare this method with chlorhexidine irrigation and srp alone in patients with  chronic periodontitis (cp). methods: forty-five systemically healthy patients with cp are included in this study. they were divided into three groups: 1) srp + saline irrigation (c); 2) srp + chlorhexidine irrigation (chx); and 3) srp + boric acid irrigation (b). to determine an ideal concentration of boric acid, a preclinical analysis was conducted. at baseline, 1 month, and 3 months after treatment, clinical measurements, including plaque index (pi), gingival index (gi), probing depth (pd), clinical attachment level (cal), and bleeding on probing (bop), were performed, and subgingival plaque samples were taken. quantitative analysis of porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), tannerella forsythia (tf), and treponema denticola (td) was performed using real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) procedures. results: the concentration of boric acid is 0.75% in this study. all clinical parameters showed statistically significant reduction at all time points compared to baseline in all groups (p <0.001). whole-mouth pd and cal reduction was similar in all groups at all time points after treatment (p >0.05). the pd and cal reductions for moderately deep pockets (pd >/=5 and <7) were greater in the b group compared to other groups between baseline and 1 month (p <0.05). for deep pockets (pd >/=7), reductions were similar in the b and chx groups (p >0.05). bop (percentage) was significantly lower in the b group compared with the chx and c groups in the first month after treatment (p <0.001). gi and pi scores were significantly lower in the b and chx groups compared with the c group at all time points after treatment (p <0.05). the amounts of pg, tf,  and td were significantly reduced in all treatment groups after 1 month (p <0.05). no statistically significant differences were detected among the groups for microbiologic parameters at any time points after treatment (p >0.05). conclusions: the results of this study suggest that boric acid could be an alternative to chlorhexidine, and it might be more favorable because boric acid was superior in whole-mouth bop as well as pd and cal reduction for moderate pockets in early time periods.

TI  == cleavage of igg1 in gingival crevicular fluid is associated with the presence of  porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == background and objectives: immunoglobulin (ig) g1 plays an important role in the  adaptive immune response. kgp, a lysine-specific cysteine protease from porphyromonas gingivalis, specifically hydrolyses igg1 heavy chains. the purpose  of this study was to examine whether cleavage of igg1 occurs in gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) in vivo, and whether there is any association with the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis and other periodontopathogens. material and  methods: gcf was obtained from nine patients with aggressive periodontitis, nine  with chronic periodontitis and five periodontally healthy individuals. the bacterial loads of porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, treponema denticola, prevotella intermedia and tannerella  forsythia were analysed by real-time polymerase chain reaction, and the presence  and cleavage of igg1 and igg2 were determined using western blotting. kgp levels  were measured by elisa. results: cleaved igg1 was identified in the gcf from 67%  of patients with aggressive periodontitis and in 44% of patients with chronic periodontitis. by contrast, no cleaved igg1 was detectable in healthy controls. no degradation of igg2 was detected in any of the samples, regardless of health status. porphyromonas gingivalis was found in high numbers in all samples in which cleavage of igg1 was detected (p < 0.001 compared with samples with no igg  cleavage). furthermore, high numbers of tannerella forsythia and prevotella intermedia were also present in these samples. the level of kgp in the gcf correlated with the load of porphyromonas gingivalis (r = 0.425, p < 0.01). the presence of kgp (range 0.07-10.98 ng/ml) was associated with proteolytic fragments of igg1 (p < 0.001). however, cleaved igg1 was also detected in samples with no detectable kgp. conclusion: in patients with periodontitis, cleavage of igg1 occurs in vivo and may suppress antibody-dependent antibacterial activity in subgingival biofilms especially those colonized by porphyromonas gingivalis.

TI  == prediction of periodontopathic bacteria in dental plaque of periodontal healthy subjects by measurement of volatile sulfur compounds in mouth air.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to determine whether measurements of volatile sulfur compounds (vscs) are useful to predict colonization of periodontopathic bacteria. for this purpose, we assessed the relationships among  distributions of 4 species of periodontopathic bacteria in tongue coating and dental plaque, oral conditions including vsc concentration in mouth air, and smoking habit of periodontal healthy young subjects. methods: the subjects were 108 young adults (mean age, 23.5+/-2.56 years) without clinical periodontal pockets. information regarding smoking habit was obtained by interview. after vsc concentration in mouth, air was measured with a portable sulfide monitor (halimeter((r))), non-stimulated saliva flow and dental caries status were assessed, and tongue coating and dental plaque samples were collected from the subjects. the tongue coating samples were weighed to determine the amount. the colonization of porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, prevotella intermedia, and treponema denticola in both tongue coating and plaque samples was investigated using species-specific polymerase chain reaction assays. results: significant relationships were observed between the colonization of periodontopathic bacteria in tongue coating and plaque samples, especially that of p. gingivalis. vsc concentration showed the most significant association with  colonization of p. gingivalis in both tongue coating and dental plaque. logistic  regression analysis demonstrated that the adjusted partial correlation coefficient [exp(b)] values for vsc concentration with the colonization of p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, and t. denticola in dental plaque were 135, 35.4 and 10.4, respectively. in addition, smoking habit was also shown to be a significant variable in regression models [exp(b)=6.19, 8.92 and 2.53, respectively]. therefore, receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed to predict the colonization of periodontal bacteria in dental plaque in the subjects divided by smoking habit. based on our results, we found cut-off values that indicated likelihood ratios (lr) within the efficient range for positive findings in both groups. conclusion: the present results demonstrated that measurement of vsc concentration in mouth air is a useful method to predict the presence of colonization of some periodontopathic bacteria in dental plaque.

TI  == reduction of salivary arginine catabolic activity through periodontal therapy.
AB  == objective: salivary enzymes may be used to diagnose periodontal conditions. salivary arginase activity (saa) is related to susceptibility to bacterial infection. therefore, the aim of this controlled interventional study was to determine the saa before and after non-surgical periodontal therapy. method and materials: eighty-nine subjects were selected: 31 periodontally healthy patients  (controls), 27 gingivitis patients, and 31 chronic periodontitis patients. plaque and gingival indices, probing depth, and clinical attachment level were monitored. the presence of campylobacter rectus, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema  denticola, and prevotella intermedia was evaluated by polymerase chain reaction.  salivary total protein level and saa were also established by spectrophotometry.  clinical and arginase data were analyzed using the wilcoxon, mann-withney, and kruskal-wallis tests (p < .05). for microbial data, the chi-square test was used. the pearson correlation test was also used between each parameter evaluated. results: after therapy, due to a significant reduction in saa, the values observed for the gingivitis and periodontitis groups were similar to those found  in the healthy group. interestingly, after therapy, saa followed the same positive pattern showed by the overall improvement of clinical parameters (gingivitis and periodontitis groups mean values, pre- > posttherapy) and by the  reduction of target pathogens (gingivitis group t forsythia, pre- > posttherapy;  periodontitis group p. gingivalis, t. denticola, p. intermedia, and t. forsythia, pre- > posttherapy). conclusion: based on the reduction of saa after therapy, in  accordance with the expected reduction in clinical and microbiologic parameters,  it was concluded that saa has the potential to serve as a reliable method to access to the therapeutic response of chronic periodontitis subjects treated with nonsurgical periodontal therapy.

TI  == quantification of periodontopathic bacteria in saliva using the invader assay.
AB  == when quantifying periodontopathic bacteria, it is important to use a convenient method that does not produce false negative results. the invader assay is a convenient method because it does not involve gene amplification. the purpose of  this study was to evaluate the validity of the invader assay to quantify periodontopathic bacteria. the invader technology was applied in quantifying five periodontopathic bacteria (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, prevotella intermedia, and treponema denticola). the invader assay produced a linear quantitative detection range over concentrations spanning seven exponential values, with a detection limit of 10(3.7) copies/tube and intra-day and inter-day variance of 0.1% to 4.7% and 0.1% to 3.4%, respectively, in quantifying five periodontopathic bacteria. we compared the results of the invader assay with those of real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) performed for quantifying five periodontopathic bacteria in 22 patients with periodontitis. among the invader-detectable bacterial strains of each species, significant correlations were observed in the counts of concerned bacterial species between these two methods, with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.757 to 0.996. this study validated repeatability and reproducibility of the invader assay in quantifying periodontopathic bacteria and demonstrated consistent agreement between the invader assay and real-time pcr in  quantifying periodontopathic bacteria.

TI  == do elderly edentulous patients with a history of periodontitis harbor periodontal pathogens?
AB  == objectives: the presence of periodontal pathogens in the oral cavity may impact implant survival. therefore, this study aimed to determine the prevalence of campylobacter rectus, porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, eikenella corrodens, and parvimonas micra in a specific elderly population with a history of periodontitis who have never worn dentures. material and methods: thirty dentate subjects (mean age 61.7 +/- 7.05 years) and 30 edentulous subjects (mean age 65.8 +/- 8.05 years) were included in this cross-sectional study. microbiological samples of cheek mucosa and the dorsum of  the tongue were taken from all subjects. in addition, sulcus samples were taken from the dentate group. all samples were analysed using a bacterial dna-specific  polymerase chain reaction. results: all the pathogens studied were detected in dentate and edentulous subjects. when cheek and tongue samples were combined, c.  rectus, a. actinomycetemcomitans and e. corrodens presented with a similar prevalence in both groups, whereas the other species were more prevalent specifically in the dentate group (p<0.05). in dentate subjects, p. intermedia and t. denticola were present in higher frequencies in the cheek mucosa (26.67% and 66.67%, respectively), whereas p. gingivalis and t. forsythia were more prevalent in the tongue samples (26.67% and 56.67%, respectively). conclusions: periodontal pathogens may persist in the oral cavity of edentulous subjects who have had periodontal disease, even 1 year after the extraction of all teeth and in the absence of other hard surfaces in the mouth.

TI  == long-term follow-up of turned single implants placed in periodontally healthy patients after 16 to 22 years: microbiologic outcome.
AB  == background: survival rates in implant dentistry today are high, although late failures do occur for many reasons, including peri-implant infections. the primary objective of this study is to investigate microbiota around single turned implants after 16 to 22 years. secondary objectives are to compare teeth and implants and to correlate microbiologic, radiographic, and clinical parameters. methods: a total of 46 patients with single implants were invited for a clinical  examination. clinical data were collected from implants and contralateral natural teeth. radiographic bone level was measured around implants. microbiologic samples were taken from implants, contralateral teeth, and the deepest pocket per quadrant. samples were analyzed with dna-dna hybridization including 40 species.  statistical analysis was performed using wilcoxon signed-rank tests, mcnemar tests, and spearman correlation coefficients with a 0.05 significance level. results: mean follow-up was 18.5 years (range 16 to 22 years). tannerella forsythia (1.5 x 10(5)) and veillonella parvula (1.02 x 10(5)) showed the highest concentrations around implants and teeth, respectively. porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and t. forsythia were significantly more present around implants than teeth. mean counts were significantly higher around implants than teeth for parvimonas micra, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, t. forsythia, and treponema denticola. total dna count was correlated to interproximal bleeding index (r = 0.409) and interproximal probing depth (r = 0.307). no correlations were present with plaque index or radiographic bone level. conclusions: in the present study, bacterial counts around single implants in periodontally healthy patients are rather low. although pathogenic bacteria are present, some in higher numbers around implants than teeth (five of 40), the majority of implants present with healthy peri-implant tissues without progressive bone loss.

TI  == differential proteomic analysis of a polymicrobial biofilm.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia exist in  a polymicrobial biofilm associated with chronic periodontitis. the aim of this study was to culture these three species as a polymicrobial biofilm and to determine proteins important for bacterial interactions. in a flow cell all three species attached and grew as a biofilm; however, after 90 h of culture p. gingivalis and t. denticola were closely associated and dominated the polymicrobial biofilm. for comparison, planktonic cultures of p. gingivalis and t. denticola were grown separately in continuous culture. whole cell lysates were subjected to sds-page, followed by in-gel proteolytic h(2)(1)(6)o/h(2)(1)(8)o labeling. from two replicates, 135 and 174 p. gingivalis proteins and 134 and 194 t. denticola proteins were quantified by lc-maldi tof/tof ms. the results suggest a change of strategy in iron acquisition by p. gingivalis due to large increases  in the abundance of husa and husb in the polymicrobial biofilm while hmuy and other iron/haem transport systems decreased. significant changes in the abundance of peptidases and enzymes involved in glutamate and glycine catabolism suggest syntrophy. these data indicate an intimate association between p. gingivalis and  t. denticola in a biofilm that may play a role in disease pathogenesis.

TI  == clinical and microbiological parameters in patients with self-ligating and conventional brackets during early phase of orthodontic treatment.
AB  == objective: to determine the effect of different bracket designs (conventional brackets and self-ligating brackets) on periodontal clinical parameters and periodontal pathogens in subgingival plaque. material and methods: the following  inclusion criteria were used: requirement of orthodontic treatment plan starting  with alignment and leveling, good general health, healthy periodontium, no antibiotic therapy in the previous 6 months before the beginning of the study, and no smoking. the study sample totaled 38 patients (13 male, 25 female; mean age, 14.6 +/- 2.0 years). patients were divided into two groups with random distribution of brackets. recording of clinical parameters was done before the placement of the orthodontic appliance (t0) and at 6 weeks (t1), 12 weeks (t2), and 18 weeks (t3) after full bonding of orthodontic appliances. periodontal pathogens of subgingival microflora were detected at t3 using a commercially available polymerase chain reaction test (micro-dent test) that contains probes for aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola. results: there was a statistically significant higher prevalence of a actinomycetemcomitans in patients with conventional brackets than in patients with self-ligating brackets, but there was no statistically significant difference for other putative periodontal pathogens. the two different types of brackets did not show statistically significant differences in periodontal clinical parameters. conclusion: bracket design does not seem to have a strong influence on periodontal clinical parameters and periodontal pathogens in subgingival plaque.  the correlation between some periodontal pathogens and clinical periodontal parameters was weak.

TI  == occurrence of periodontal pathogens among patients with chronic periodontitis.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to evaluate the presence of the periodontal pathogens that form the red complex (tannerella forsythia, porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola) and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans in  patients with chronic periodontitis. the sample consisted of 29 patients with a clinical and radiographic diagnosis of chronic periodontitis based on the criteria of the american academy of periodontology (3). samples for microbiological analysis were collected from the four sites of greatest probing depth in each patient, totaling 116 samples. these samples were processed using conventional polymerase chain reaction, which achieved the following positive results: 46.6% for p. gingivalis, 41.4% for t. forsythia, 33.6% for t. denticola  and 27.6% for a. actinomycetemcomitans. p. gingivalis and t. forsythia were more  prevalent (p < 0.05) in periodontal pockets >/= 8 mm. the combinations t. forsythia + p. gingivalis (23.2%) and t. forsythia + p. gingivalis + t. denticola (20.0%) were more frequent in sites with a probing depth >/= 8 mm. associations with the simultaneous presence of a. actinomycetemcomitans + p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans + t. forsythia, p. gingivalis + t. forsythia and t. forsythia + t. denticola were statistically significant (p < 0.05). it was concluded that the red complex pathogens are related to chronic periodontitis, presenting a higher occurrence in deep periodontal pockets. moreover, the simultaneous presence of these bacteria in deep sites suggests a symbiotic relationship between these virulent species, favoring, in this way, a further progression of periodontal disease.

TI  == autoinducer 2 of fusobacterium nucleatum as a target molecule to inhibit biofilm  formation of periodontopathogens.
AB  == periodontitis is initiated by bacteria in subgingival biofilms, which are composed mostly of gram-negative anaerobes. autoinducer 2 (ai-2) is a universal quorum sensing (qs) molecule that mediates intergeneric signalling in multispecies bacterial communities and may induce biofilm formation. as fusobacterium nucleatum is the major coaggregation bridge organism that links early colonising commensals and late pathogenic colonisers in dental biofilms via the accretion of periodontopathogens, we hypothesised that ai-2 of f. nucleatum contributes to this interspecies interaction, and interruption of this signalling could result in the inhibition of biofilm formation of periodontopathogens. to test this hypothesis, we evaluated the effect of partially purified f. nucleatum  ai-2 on monospecies biofilm as well as mutualistic interactions between f. nucleatum and the so-called 'red complex' (porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia). then we tested the effect of two qs inhibitors (qsis), (5z)-4-bromo-5-(bromomethylene)-2(5h)-furanone (furanone compound) and d-ribose, on ai-2-induced biofilm formation and coaggregation. f. nucleatum ai-2 remarkably induced biofilm growth of single and dual species and coaggregation between f. nucleatum and each species of the 'red complex', all of  which were inhibited by the qsis. f. nucleatum ai-2 induced the expression of the representative adhesion molecules of the periodontopathogens, which were inhibited by the qsis. our results demonstrate that f. nucleatum ai-2 plays an important role in inter- and intraspecies interactions between periodontopathogens via enhanced expression of adhesion molecules and may be a target for the inhibition of pathogenic dental biofilm formation.

AB  == objectives: this study aims to assess the effects of rinsing with zinc- and chlorhexidine-containing mouth rinse with or without adjunct tongue scraping on volatile sulfur compounds (vscs) in breath air, and the microbiota at the dorsum  of the tongue. material and methods: a randomized single-masked controlled clinical trial with a cross-over study design over 14 days including 21 subjects  was performed. bacterial samples from the dorsum of the tongue were assayed by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. results: no halitosis (identified by vsc assessments) at day 14 was identified in 12/21 subjects with active rinse alone,  in 10/21 with adjunct use of tongue scraper, in 1/21 for negative control rinse alone, and in 3/21 in the control and tongue scraping sequence. at day 14, significantly lower counts were identified only in the active rinse sequence (p < 0.001) for 15/78 species including, fusobacterium sp., porphyromonas gingivalis,  pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, and tannerella forsythia. a decrease in bacteria from baseline to day 14 was found in successfully treated subjects for 9/74 species including: p. gingivalis, prevotella melaninogenica, s. aureus, and treponema denticola. baseline vsc scores were correlated with several bacterial species. the use of a tongue scraper combined with active rinse did not change the levels of vsc compared to rinsing alone. conclusions: vsc scores were  not associated with bacterial counts in samples taken from the dorsum of the tongue. the active rinse alone containing zinc and chlorhexidine had effects on intra-oral halitosis and reduced bacterial counts of species associated with malodor. tongue scraping provided no beneficial effects on the microbiota studied. clinical relevance: periodontally healthy subjects with intra-oral halitosis benefit from daily rinsing with zinc- and chlorhexidine-containing mouth rinse.

TI  == prevalence of fima genotypes of porphyromonas gingivalis and other periodontal bacteria in a spanish population with chronic periodontitis.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of the different fima genotypes of porphyromonas gingivalis in adult spanish patients with chronic periodontitis, patients with gingivitis and periodontally healthy subjects, and the relationship between these genotypes and other periodontopathogenic bacteria. study design: samples of subgingival plaque were taken from 86 patients (33 with chronic periodontitis, 16 with gingivitis, and 37 periodontally healthy) in the course of a full periodontal examination. pcr was employed to determine the presence of the 6 fima genotypes of porphyromonas gingivalis (i-v and ib) and of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella  forsythia and treponema denticola. results: porphyromonas gingivalis fima genotypes ii and ib were present in significantly higher percentages in periodontal patients (39.4% and 12.1% respectively) than in healthy or gingivitis subjects. the prevalence of tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, and porphyromonas gingivalis fima genotype iv was significantly higher in the group that presented bleeding greater than 30%. a positive correlation was found between porphyromonas gingivalis fima genotype iv and treponema denticola. conclusions: a strong association between porphyromonas gingivalis fima genotypes ii and ib and chronic periodontitis exists in the spanish population. the most prevalent genotype in periodontal patients is ii.

TI  == serum antibodies to periodontal pathogens are a risk factor for alzheimer's disease.
AB  == background: chronic inflammation in periodontal disease has been suggested as a potential risk factor in alzheimer's disease (ad). the purpose of this study was  to examine serum antibody levels to bacteria of periodontal disease in participants who eventually converted to ad compared with the antibody levels in  control subjects. methods: serum samples from 158 participants in the biologically resilient adults in neurological studies research program at the university of kentucky were analyzed for immunoglobulin g antibody levels to seven oral bacteria associated with periodontitis, including aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, campylobacter rectus, treponema  denticola, fusobacterium nucleatum, tannerella forsythia, and prevotella intermedia. all 158 participants were cognitively intact at baseline venous blood draw. in all, 81 of the participants developed either mild cognitive impairment (mci) or ad or both, and 77 controls remained cognitively intact in the years of  follow-up. antibody levels were compared between controls and subjects with ad at baseline draw and after conversion and controls and subjects with mci at baseline draw and after conversion using the wilcoxon rank-sum test. ad and mci participants were not directly compared. linear regression models were used to adjust for potential confounding. results: antibody levels to f nucleatum and p intermedia were significantly increased (alpha = 0.05) at baseline serum draw in  the patients with ad compared with controls. these results remained significant when controlling for baseline age, mini-mental state examination score, and apolipoprotein epsilon 4 status. conclusions: this study provides initial data that demonstrate elevated antibodies to periodontal disease bacteria in subjects  years before cognitive impairment and suggests that periodontal disease could potentially contribute to the risk of ad onset/progression. additional cohort studies profiling oral clinical presentation with systemic response and ad and prospective studies to evaluate any cause-and-effect association are warranted.

TI  == oral bacteria and yeasts in relationship to oral ulcerations in hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients.
AB  == background: oral mucositis is a serious and debilitating side effect of conditioning regimens for hematopoietic stem cell transplant (hsct). through hsct, the homeostasis in the oral cavity is disrupted. the contribution of the oral microflora to mucositis remains to be clarified. the aim of our study was to investigate the relationship between yeasts, bacteria associated with periodontitis, and oral ulcerations in hsct recipients. methods: this prospective observational study included 49 adult hsct recipients. twice weekly, oral ulcerations were scored, and oral rinsing samples were obtained. samples were evaluated for the total bacterial load; the gram-negative bacteria: aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, parvimonas micra, fusobacterium nucleatum, tannerella forsythia, and  treponema denticola; and the yeasts: candida albicans, candida glabrata, candida  kefyr, candida krusei, candida parapsilosis, and candida tropicalis using real-time polymerase chain reaction with specific primers and probes. explanatory variables for oral ulcerations were calculated using the multilevel generalized estimated equations (gee) technique. results: none of the samples was positive for a. actinomycetemcomitans, while f. nucleatum was found most often (66 % of samples). c. albicans was the most isolated yeast (88 % of samples), whereas c. parapsilosis was found in only 8 % of the samples. multivariate gee analyses identified p. gingivalis, p. micra, t. denticola, f. nucleatum, c. glabrata, and  c. kefyr as significant explanatory variables of oral ulcerations. conclusions: our data indicate that p. gingivalis in particular, but also p. micra, t. denticola, f. nucleatum, c. glabrata, and c. kefyr may play a role in ulcerative  oral mucositis in patients undergoing hsct.

TI  == quantification of subgingival bacterial pathogens at different stages of periodontal diseases.
AB  == anaerobic gram-negative oral bacteria such as treponema denticola, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, campylobacter rectus, and fusobacterium nucleatum are closely associated with periodontal diseases. we measured the relative population (bacterial levels) of these oral pathogens in subgingival tissues of patients at  different stages of korean chronic periodontal diseases. we divided the individuals into those with chronic gingivitis (g), moderate periodontitis (p1),  severe periodontitis (p2), and normal individuals (n) (n = 20 for each group) and subgingival tissue samples were collected. we used real-time pcr with taqman probes to evaluate the change of periodontal pathogens among different stages of  periodontitis. bacterial levels of a. actinomycetemcomitans and c. rectus are significantly increased in individuals with chronic gingivitis and moderate periodontitis, but unchanged in severe periodontitis patients. these results suggest that analyzing certain bacterial levels among total oral pathogens may facilitate understanding of the role of periodontal bacteria in the early stages  of periodontitis.

TI  == microbial profiles of patients seeking treatment for periodontitis. influence of  origin, smoking and age?
AB  == purpose: we assessed the potential influence of the origin, the smoking status and the age on subgingival microbial profiles of subjects seeking periodontal care in switzerland today. material and methods: subgingival samples were obtained from 182 subjects originating from 44 countries (56 native swiss, 64 other european, 43 african, 19 others), seeking periodontal treatment at the school of dental medicine at the university of geneva. four periodontal microorganisms were quantified by direct hybridization with specific rna probes.  results: tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola were ubiquitous (95.6%, 93.9%), and porphyromonas gingivalis was frequently detected (89%). counts correlated with the size of the microbial sample (total load). aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans was detected in only 70 (38.4%) subjects. counts were highly variable and unrelated to total load. subjects less than 46.8 years old (median age) had a higher risk to be positive than older subjects. detection frequencies and counts of all four organisms were unrelated to the origin or the  smoking status. conclusions: based on a clinical diagnosis of untreated periodontitis, positive outcomes of tests for t. forsythia, t. denticola and p. gingivalis could be predicted with high confidence irrespective of a patient;'s origin, smoking status or age. detection of a. actinomycetemcomitans was less frequent and depended on the age of the subject.

TI  == distribution of periodontopathic bacterial species in dogs and their owners.
AB  == objective: presently, a large number of individuals consider their companion animals as family members and have close contact with them in daily life. the purpose of the present study was to analyze the distribution of periodontopathic  bacterial species in oral specimens taken from dogs and their owners. design: dental plaque specimens were collected from 66 dogs and 81 members of 64 families who came to an animal clinic or dog training school in okayama, japan, in 2011. bacterial dna was extracted from each specimen and pcr analyses using primers specific for 11 periodontopathic species, porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas gulae, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter rectus, and eikenella corrodens were performed. results: p. gulae (71.2%), t. forsythia (77.3%), and c. rectus (66.7%) were frequently found in the dogs, whereas the detection rates of  those species in humans were less frequent at 16.0%, 30.9%, and 21.0%, respectively. p. gulae was identified in 13 human subjects and each of their dogs was also positive for the species. furthermore, e. corrodens and t. denticola in  specimens obtained from dogs were correlated with their presence in specimens from owners who had close contact with them. conclusions: these results suggest that several periodontopathic species could be transmitted between humans and their companion dogs, though the distribution of periodontopathic species in both is generally different.

TI  == anaerobic and microaerophilic pathogens in the biofilm formation on voice prostheses: a pilot study.
AB  == objectives/hypothesis: voice rehabilitation with voice prostheses is a standard therapy in laryngectomized patients. biofilm formation on the surface of the voice prostheses causes device failure and requires frequent replacements. studies analyzing the biofilm of voice prostheses have mainly focused on aerobic  bacteria. anaerobic bacteria as an integral part of the biofilms on voice prostheses have not been investigated yet. study design: prospective pilot study  on the occurrence of anaerobic and microaerophilic pathogens in biofilm formation on voice prostheses. methods: biofilm samples of 15 voice prostheses were analyzed using a polymerase chain reaction-based hybridization method regarding the presence of 11 selected anaerobic and microaerophilic pathogens. results: in  80% of the voice prostheses, at least one and up to 10 of the tested bacteria could be identified. fusobacterium nucleatum was the pathogen most often present  (73%). other frequently occurring pathogens were treponema denticola (40%), tannerella forsythia (33%), and eikenella corrodens (33%). there was no correlation between the number of identified bacteria and the indwelling times (mean, 127 days; maximum, 344 days; minimum, 22 days). conclusions: for the first time, anaerobic and microaerophilic pathogens have been identified as part of the biofilm formation on the surface of voice prostheses. those pathogens might be responsible for accelerated biofilm formation and reduced lifetime of the voice prostheses.

TI  == oral microbiota in swiss adolescents.
AB  == objectives: the purpose of the study was to determine the prevalence of different oral microbes in gingival plaque samples and in samples from the dorsum of the tongue in a swiss adolescent population. materials and methods: ninety-nine adolescents between 15 and 18 years were enrolled. plaque index, bleeding on probing (bop), the periodontal screening index, and decayed missed filled tooth (dmft) index were recorded. samples from subgingival plaque and swabs from the tongue were analyzed by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method. additionally, counts of streptococus mutans and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola were determined by real-time pcr. results: periodontitis was  not diagnosed in any of the subjects but all of them presented signs of gingival  inflammation displaying a mean bop of 28%. ten (10.1%) subjects were tested positive for p. gingivalis, each 22 (22.2%) for a. actinomycetemcomitans and t. forsythia, (47.5%) for t. denticola. t. denticola and s. mutans showed a high affinity to the gingival plaque, whereas t. forsythia was often detected from the dorsum of the tongue. dmft was associated with s. mutans counts, and bop correlated with counts of p. gingivalis and t. denticola. conclusions: the present data indicate that: (a) gingivitis but not periodontitis is a common finding among swiss adolescents, and (b) bacteria associated with periodontitis were frequently detected in the subgingival dental plaque and on the dorsum of the tongue in swiss adolescents with gingivitis. clinical relevance: although gingivitis was a frequent finding in swiss adolescents, periodontitis was not detected in this population. the dorsum of the tongue appears to represent an important reservoir for periodontopathic bacteria.

TI  == molecular analysis of 16s rrna genes identifies potentially periodontal pathogenic bacteria and archaea in the plaque of partially erupted third molars.
AB  == purpose: small subunit rrna sequencing and phylogenetic analysis were used to identify cultivable and uncultivable microorganisms present in the dental plaque  of symptomatic and asymptomatic partially erupted third molars to determine the prevalence of putative periodontal pathogens in pericoronal sites. materials and  methods: template dna prepared from subgingival plaque collected from partially erupted symptomatic and asymptomatic mandibular third molars and healthy incisors was used in polymerase chain reaction with broad-range oligonucleotide primers to amplify 16s rrna bacterial and archaeal genes. amplicons were cloned, sequenced,  and compared with known nucleotide sequences in online databases to identify the  microorganisms present. results: two thousand three hundred two clones from the plaque of 12 patients carried bacterial sequences from 63 genera belonging to 11  phyla, including members of the uncultivable tm7, sr1, and chloroflexi, and difficult-to-cultivate synergistetes and spirochaetes. dialister invisus, filifactor alocis, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas endodontalis, prevotella denticola, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola, which have been associated with periodontal disease, were found in significantly greater abundance in pericoronal compared with incisor sites. dialister invisus and f nucleatum were found in greater abundance in sites exhibiting clinical symptoms.  the archaeal species, methanobrevibacter oralis, which has been associated with severe periodontitis, was found in 3 symptomatic patients. conclusions: these findings have provided new insights into the complex microbiota of pericoronitis. several bacterial and archaeal species implicated in periodontal disease were recovered in greater incidence and abundance from the plaque of partially erupted third molars compared with incisors, supporting the hypothesis that the pericoronal region may provide a favored niche for periodontal pathogens in otherwise healthy mouths.

TI  == microbial profile of patients with periodontitis compared with healthy subjects.
AB  == objective: to define and compare the microbiologic profile of subgingival plaque  in german patients with periodontitis (including aggressive and advanced chronic  periodontitis) and healthy subjects and to determine significant association between isolates and clinical status. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and tannerella forsythia are major periodontal pathogens, though it is recognized that other species may also contribute to the  pathogenesis of periodontal disease. method and materials: thirty-three patients  with clinical and radiologic proof of aggressive and advanced chronic periodontitis and 20 healthy subjects were enrolled in this study. clinical indices were recorded as six-point measurements on each tooth. samples of the subgingival plaque were taken with paper points from four teeth of each individual. the samples were divided into two parts. one part was immediately cultivated, while the other one was stored at -20 degrees c until analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. results: a total of 284 anaerobic isolates (224 isolates from patients and 60 isolates from healthy controls) were identified. forty different anaerobic species were isolated, with a mean of 6.78  species per patient and 3 species per healthy control subject. significant differences in prevalence (after adjusting for multiple comparisons, p < .001) were found for prevotella intermedia and nigrescens, fusobacterium nucleatum, t forsythia, treponema denticola, and veillonella parvula. the first four species were associated with the aggressive periodontitis group and v parvula with healthy subjects. conclusion: when compared with healthy controls, the microbial  profile of subgingival plaque from periodontitis was found to contain known periodontal pathogens with a different prevalence to that described in earlier studies. p intermedia/nigrescens, f nucleatum, t forsythia, and t denticola have  been found in lower proportions and small quantities in healthy subjects.

TI  == periodontal pathogens affect the level of protease inhibitors in gingival crevicular fluid.
AB  == in periodontitis, an effective host-response is primarily related to neutrophils  loaded with serine proteases, including elastase (ne) and protease 3 (pr3), the extracellular activity of which is tightly controlled by endogenous inhibitors. in vitro these inhibitors are degraded by gingipains, cysteine proteases produced by porphyromonas gingivalis. the purpose of this study was to determine the level of selected protease inhibitors in gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) in relation to periodontal infection. the gcf collected from 31 subjects (nine healthy controls, seven with gingivitis, five with aggressive periodontitis and 10 with chronic periodontitis) was analyzed for the levels of elafin and secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (slpi), two main tissue-derived inhibitors of neutrophil serine proteases. in parallel, activity of ne, pr3 and arginine-specific gingipains (rgps) in gcf was measured. finally loads of p. gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola were determined. the highest values of elafin were found in aggressive  periodontitis and the lowest in controls. the quantity of elafin correlated positively with the load of p. gingivalis, ta. forsythia and tr. denticola, as well as with rgps activity. in addition, ne activity was positively associated with the counts of those bacterial species, but not with the amount of elafin. in contrast, the highest concentrations of slpi were found in periodontally healthy  subjects whereas amounts of this inhibitor were significantly decreased in patients infected with p. gingivalis. periodontopathogenic bacteria stimulate the release of ne and pr3, which activities escape the control through degradation of locally produced inhibitors (slpi and elafin) by host-derived and bacteria-derived proteases.

TI  == evidence for graft colonization with periodontal pathogens in lung transplant recipients. a pilot study.
AB  == bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (bos) is a major cause of late graft dysfunction in lung transplant recipients. there is increasing evidence that beside alloimmunologic injury also non-alloimmunologic inflammatory conditions may raise the risk of acute and chronic rejection. the oral cavity represents a possible reservoir for pathogenic bacteria due to its close anatomical proximity. in this pilot study, the presence of pathogenic periodontal bacteria in the oral  cavity as well as in the lungs of lung transplant recipients was investigated for the first time. eight lung transplant recipients underwent broncho-alveolar lavage, transbronchial biopsies, and endobronchial biopsies. in addition to routinely performed examinations, pulmonary as well as plaque samples were assessed for aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (aa), tannerella forsythia (tf), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), and treponema denticola (td) with the aid of a hybridization technique. no or only one periodontal pathogen (solitarily pg) was found in the gingival plaques of five of the eight patients (group a). in three patients, two or more periodontal pathogens were detetectable in the gingival samples (group b). whereas group a also had not more than one periodontal pathogen in the lungs, group b had more than one species in the lungs. in group b, all patients suffered from bos, whereas in group a only one patient was affected. this is the first evidence for the presence of periodontal  pathogens in the lungs of lung transplant recipients. further studies with larger cohorts are required to elucidate potential links between periodontal infection,  pulmonary colonization, and rejection.

TI  == molecular detection of in-vivo microbial contamination of metallic orthodontic brackets by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization.
AB  == introduction: knowing the microbiota that colonizes orthodontic appliances is important for planning strategies and implementing specific preventive measures during treatment. the purpose of this clinical trial was to evaluate in vivo the  contamination of metallic orthodontic brackets with 40 dna probes for different bacterial species by using the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization (cddh) technique. methods: eighteen patients, 11 to 29 years of age having fixed orthodontic treatment, were enrolled in the study. each subject had 2 new metallic brackets bonded to different premolars in a randomized manner. after 30  days, the brackets were removed and processed for analysis by cddh. data on bacterial contamination were analyzed descriptively and with the kruskal-wallis and dunn post tests (alpha = 0.05). forty microbial species (cariogenic microorganisms, bacteria of the purple, yellow, green, orange complexes, "red complex +treponema socranskii," and the cluster of actinomyces) were assessed. results: most bacterial species were present in all subjects, except for streptococcus constellatus, campylobacter rectus, tannerella forsythia, t socranskii, and lactobacillus acidophillus (94.4%), propionibacterium acnes i and eubacterium nodatum (88.9%), and treponema denticola (77.8%). among the cariogenic microorganisms, streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sobrinus were found in larger numbers than l acidophillus and lactobacillus casei (p <0.001). the periodontal pathogens of the orange complex were detected in larger numbers than those of the "red complex +t socranskii" (p <0.0001). among the bacteria not associated with specific pathologies, veillonella parvula (purple complex) was the most frequently detected strain (p <0.0001). the numbers of yellow and green  complex bacteria and the cluster of actinomyces were similar (p >0.05). conclusions: metallic brackets in use for 1 month were multi-colonized by several bacterial species, including cariogenic microorganisms and periodontal pathogens, reinforcing the need for meticulous oral hygiene and additional preventive measures to maintain oral health in orthodontic patients.

TI  == symptomatic and asymptomatic apical periodontitis associated with red complex bacteria: clinical and microbiological evaluation.
AB  == in this study, the association of red complex (rc) bacteria that include treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia and porphyromonas gingivalis with acute, exacerbated or chronic apical periodontitis was evaluated. seventy-one patients with periapical disease were evaluated by clinical examination and microbiological samples obtained from the root canals were analyzed by a polymerase chain reaction assay. twenty-one (29.6%) samples were positive for rc  bacteria, with t. denticola, t. forsythia and p. gingivalis being detected in 14  (19.7%), 10 (14.1%) and 6 (8.5%) samples, respectively. rc bacteria were mainly associated with acute apical periodontitis (29.2%) and phoenix abscess (63.2%), while they were only sporadically detected (7.1%) in patients with chronic apical periodontitis. generally, rc bacteria were associated with pain and a higher frequency of intracanalar/intrasulcular pus drainage. involvement of rc bacteria  in symptomatic periapical disease should be suspected in the presence of particularly severe clinical pain and pus drainage.

TI  == treatment of residual pockets with photodynamic therapy, diode laser, or deep scaling. a randomized, split-mouth controlled clinical trial.
AB  == the objective of this work was to compare the effects of antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (pdt), diode soft laser therapy (dsl), and thorough deep scaling and root planing (srp) for treatment of residual pockets. thirty-two subjects with a history of non-surgical treatment for chronic periodontitis were  included. residual pockets >4 mm and bleeding upon probing were debrided with an  ultrasonic device and then subjected to either pdt, dsl, or srp. pocket probing depth (ppd), bleeding on probing (bop), and gingival recession were monitored over 6 months. counts of four microorganisms were determined by direct hybridization with rna probes. ppd decreased from 5.6 +/- 1.0 to 3.8 +/- 1.1 in 6 months (p < 0.001), and bop decreased from 100% to 52% (p < 0.01). the risk for a site to remain >4 mm with bop depended on initial ppd (p = 0.036) and was higher  if treated with dsl (p = 0.034). frequencies of three microorganisms were significantly lower in pdt- and srp-treated than in dsl-treated quadrants (p = 0.02) after 14 days, but not at months 2 and 6. all three treatments resulted in  a significant clinical improvement. pdt and srp suppressed porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola stronger, and resulted  in fewer persisting pockets after 6 months, than dsl application.

TI  == clinical and microbiologic evaluation, by real-time polymerase chain reaction, of non-surgical treatment of aggressive periodontitis associated with amoxicillin and metronidazole.
AB  == background: the aim of the present study is to evaluate the clinical and microbiologic changes resulting from non-surgical periodontal treatment associated with amoxicillin and metronidazole in individuals with aggressive periodontitis. methods: fifteen individuals with aggressive periodontitis received non-surgical periodontal treatment and 45 days after completion of treatment were treated with antibiotics. clinical data and samples of subgingival plaque were collected at baseline, 45 days after the non-surgical periodontal treatment, and 1 month after the use of antimicrobial agents. after 3 and 6 months, only clinical data were collected. the presence and quantification of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), tannerella  forsythia (tf), treponema denticola (td), and dialister pneumosintes were determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction. results: all clinical parameters, with the exception of clinical attachment level (cal), had significantly (p <0.05) improved at the end of the third month after non-surgical therapy associated with antibiotics. there was significant (p <0.05) reduction in the quantities of td and tf. after 1 month, there were significant (p <0.05) reductions in the frequencies of pg and tf. conclusion: non-surgical mechanical treatment associated with the use of amoxicillin and metronidazole led to an improvement in all clinical parameters studied, except for cal, and significantly reduced the amount of subgingival tf and td.

TI  == the effect of spiramycin on porphyromonas gingivalis and other "classic" periopathogens.
AB  == in clinical trials, spiramycin has shown additional benefit overscaling and root  planing on pocket depth reduction, but its effect on periodontal microbiota was evaluated only by darkfield microscopy. therefore, this study was conducted to determine the effect of spiramycin administration on porphyromonas gingivalis and other periodontopathic bacteria using 16s rarn pcr technique. thirty two non-smoker adults with untreated periodontitis and pocket depth > or = 7 mm. were evaluated to participate in this randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial. clinical measurements were performed on day -15, 15, 30 and 90 from baseline. subgingival samples were analyzed for detection of porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), tannerella forsythia (tj), treponema denticola (td) and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (aa) on days -15, 30 and 90. on day 0, 25 pg positive subjects were randomly assigned to receive either systemically administered spiramycinfor 7 days (test group sp) or identical placebo tablets (placebo group  pl). after spiramycin administration pg, tf and td were suppressed showingstatistically significant difference (p<0.05) with the placebo group. none of the groups showed changes in aa detection. these data indicate that bacteria currently associated with advanced periodontitis (pg, tf and td) are suppressed after 7 days of systemic administration of spiramycin.

TI  == salivary levels of antibacterial peptide (ll-37/hcap-18) and cotinine in patients with chronic periodontitis.
AB  == background: the purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between salivary ll-37 levels and clinical severity in patients with chronic periodontitis (cp). the presence/absence of four periodontopathic bacteria and salivary cotinine levels were also examined to assess the impact of these factors on ll-37 production. methods: unstimulated salivary samples were collected from 69 patients with cp. salivary concentrations of ll-37 and cotinine were measured  by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola in saliva were detected by polymerase chain reaction. periodontal examination included determination of probing depth (pd), clinical attachment level, bleeding on probing, and plaque control record. results: mean salivary ll-37 concentration was 225.0 +/- 227.2 ng/ml, and a high prevalence of periodontopathic bacteria was observed. the stepwise ordinal logistic regression model showed that high salivary ll-37 levels were significantly associated with the presence of t. denticola and higher percentage of teeth with pd >/=5 mm. in addition, higher salivary cotinine levels (>/=8 ng/ml) were negatively associated with salivary ll-37 levels. conclusions: salivary ll-37 level was positively correlated with severe periodontal destruction, and production was apparently associated with periodontopathic bacterial infection. the negative correlations between salivary  ll-37 and cotinine levels also suggest that smoking or long-term exposure to environmental tobacco smoke can lead to lower ll-37 levels in the oral cavity and increased risk of periodontitis.

TI  == colonisation of the oral cavity by periodontopathic bacteria in complete denture  wearers.
AB  == objective: the purpose of this study was to investigate colonisation by periodontopathic bacteria and the sites of colonisation in elderly upper and lower complete denture wearers. we also investigated the relationship between level of oral hygiene and colonisation by periodontopathic bacteria. materials and methods: forty edentulous and 37 dentate volunteers participated in this study. samples were collected from whole saliva, and levels of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia and fusobacterium nucleatum were determined by pcr invader technology. detection of these species on oral mucosal and denture surfaces was performed by pcr. fisher's exact test was used for the statistical analysis. cluster analysis was employed to investigate trends in the periodontopathic bacteria flora in each sampling area. results: detection rates of periodontopathic bacteria in whole saliva were lower under edentulous conditions than under dentulous conditions, except for a. actinomycetemcomitans and f. nucleatum (p < 0.01). detection rate of f. nucleatum was the highest in all areas. a positive correlation was observed between dna quantification of p. gingivalis and number of candida species in saliva. cluster analysis of the test  species identified two clusters. tongue-coating status was associated with the detection rate of all periodontopathic bacteria investigated, and denture plaque  status was associated with the detection rate of t. denticola and f. nucleatum. conclusion: results indicate the presence of periodontopathic bacteria under edentulous conditions and that the status of oral hygiene of the mucosal or denture surfaces affects colonisation by t. denticola and f. nucleatum.

TI  == detection of periodontal pathogens in newborns and children with mixed dentition.
AB  == we report the age-related prevalence of red complex periodontal pathogens, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia, along with four strains of orange complex pathogens. the bacteria present in samples isolated from tongue, cheek, and subgingival sulcus in edentulous newborns and children with mixed dentition were monitored by polymerase chain reaction (pcr).  p. gingivalis was not detected in any site of any subject in the two groups tested. however, t. denticola was not only found in the 6-13 years age group, but also in edentulous newborns at a relatively high prevalence, indicating non-dentition-related colonization by t. denticola. campylobacter rectus, prevotella intermedia, t. forsythia, eikenella corrodens, and parvimonas micra were found in the oral cavity of most subjects belonging to the 6-13 years age group compared to newborns. this suggested a pronounced association between these colonizing bacteria and the presence of teeth. there was also a strong relation between t. denticola and t. forsythia for their prevalence in the subgingival sulcus of the 6-13 years age group (p < 0.0001), but not in the other sites tested, suggesting that the colonization of dentition-related t. forsythia may be associated with the increased prevalence of non-dentition-related t. denticola in the subgingival sulcus. overall, these results suggest that dentition is a key determinant of bacterial colonization, especially orange complex bacteria and the red complex bacterium t. forsythia.

TI  == molecular detection of human periodontal pathogens in oral swab specimens from dogs in japan.
AB  == periodontal diseases are known to be major diseases in humans, and are also common in dogs. the purpose of the present study was to analyze the distribution  of periodontitis-related bacterial species using oral swab specimens collected from 26 pet dogs. the distribution of an animal gingival organism porphyromonas gulae, in addition to 10 human periodontitis-related bacterial species, including porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter rectus, and eikenella corrodens, were evaluated by polymerase chain reaction with species-specific sets of primers. porphyromonas gulae, tannerella forsythia and campylobacter rectus were detected in almost all dogs analyzed, all of which should be regarded as common members of oral flora in dogs. then, isolation and identification of the porphyromonas species in swab specimens were performed. there were 35 strains isolated from 22 dogs, and broad-range polymerase chain reaction and sequencing methods revealed that approximately 70% of them were porphyromonas gulae. in contrast, the frequency of porphyromonas gingivalis was extremely low. these findings indicate the presence of specific periodontitis-related pathogens in pet dogs, especially porphyromonas gulae.

TI  == microbiologic findings 1 year after partial- and full-mouth scaling in the treatment of moderate chronic periodontitis.
AB  == objective: to investigate the impact on microbiologic variables of full-mouth scaling (fms) and conventional scaling and root planing (csrp) after 12 months. method and materials: in a prospective randomized controlled clinical study, 37 volunteers with moderate chronic periodontitis were treated by fms or by csrp in  two sessions at 4-week intervals. clinical attachment level, probing depth, and bleeding on probing were recorded at baseline as well as at 6 and 12 months. four subgingival plaque samples were taken from the deepest sites in premolars and molars at baseline and after 12 months. pooled sample analysis was performed using real-time polymerase chain reaction for the identification of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola. results: at baseline, the bacterial load of a actinomycetemcomitans was significantly higher in the csrp group compared to the  fms group (p = .042). in the csrp group, this load decreased significantly (p = .011), leading to similar quantities of a actinomycetemcomitans in both groups. further, significant reductions in frequency were found in the fms group for t forsythia and p gingivalis and in the csrp group for a actinomycetemcomitans and  t denticola. conclusion: the data suggest that both therapy modalities lead to similar effects on target periodontal pathogen species. fms compared to csrp was  not favorable in reduction of periodontopathogens.

TI  == polymicrobial periodontal pathogen transcriptomes in calvarial bone and soft tissue.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia are consistently associated with adult periodontitis. this study sought to document the host transcriptome to a p. gingivalis, t. denticola, and t.forsythia challenge as a polymicrobial infection using a murine calvarial model of acute inflammation and bone resorption. mice were infected with p. gingivalis, t. denticola, and t. forsythia over the calvaria, after which the soft tissues and calvarial bones were excised. a murine genechip((r)) array analysis of transcript profiles showed that 6997 genes were differentially expressed in calvarial bones  (p < 0.05) and 1544 genes were differentially transcribed in the inflamed tissues after the polymicrobial infection. of these genes, 4476 and 1035 genes in the infected bone and tissues were differentially expressed by upregulation. biological pathways significantly impacted by the polymicrobial infection in calvarial bone included leukocyte transendothelial migration (ltm), cell adhesion molecules, adherens junction, major histocompatibility complex antigen, extracellular matrix-receptor interaction, and antigen processing and presentation resulting in inflammatory/cytokine/chemokine transcripts stimulation in bone and soft tissue. intense inflammation and increased activated osteoclasts were observed in calvarias compared with sham-infected controls. quantitative real-time rt-pcr analysis confirmed that the mrna level of selected genes corresponded with the microarray expression. the polymicrobial infection regulated several ltm and extracellular membrane pathway genes in a manner distinct from mono-infection with p. gingivalis, t. denticola, or t. forsythia. to our knowledge, this is the first definition of the polymicrobially induced transcriptome in calvarial bone and soft tissue in response to periodontal pathogens.

TI  == microbiologic changes in subgingival plaque before and during the early period of orthodontic treatment.
AB  == objective: to evaluate changes in subgingival microbiota before and during the leveling and alignment orthodontic stage using the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) method. materials and methods: thirty orthodontic patients (17 females and  13 males; aged 16.7 +/- 6.5 y) were included in this study. subgingival microbial samples were taken from the disto-buccal gingival crevice of the left upper central incisors, the left lower central incisors, the mesio-buccal gingival crevice of the left upper first molars, and the left lower first molars, at four  different times: at baseline, before placement of orthodontic appliances (t1), and 1 week (t2), 3 months (t3), and 6 months after placement of orthodontic appliances (t4). dna was extracted from the samples, and the 16s rrna-based pcr detection method was used to determine the prevalence of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythia, campylobactor rectus, eikenella corrodens, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, and treponema denticola, which are considered as putative periodontopathogens. results: the frequency of t forsythia, c rectus, and p nigrescens significantly increased after placement of orthodontic appliances. for the other species, the frequency tended to increase but no statistically significant difference was noted. the frequency of the change, representing microorganisms not existing at t1 but newly developing at t2, t3, and t4, was higher at the molars than at the incisors. conclusion: the placement of orthodontic appliances affects the subgingival microbial composition even during  the early period of orthodontic treatment, increasing the prevalence of periodontopathogens, especially in the molar region.

TI  == detection of periodontal markers in chronic periodontitis.
AB  == the aim was to compare the detection frequency of periodontopathogens by using the pado test 4.5 and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique in chronic periodontitis patients.thirty patients with chronic periodontitis were tested cross-sectionally with dna/rna oligogenomic probe method (iai pado test 4.5) and  dna/dna whole genomic probe (checkerboard) method. samples were taken by two paper points at the deepest site in each of the four quadrants and pooled into one sample for each of the two methods. the samples were sent to the two laboratories (iai, zuchwil, switzerland, and oral microbiology laboratory, university of gothenburg, sweden) and were analyzed in a routine setting for the  presence and amount of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola.while pado test 4.5 detected the four periodontal pathogens in 11 (36.7%) of the patients, the checkerboard method showed presence in all patients (100%) using the lower score  (score 1 corresponding to 10(4) bacterial cells) and 16 (53.3%) using a higher treshold (score 3 corresponding to between >10(5) and 10(6) cells).the results of the present study showed low agreement for a positive microbiological outcome using the two diagnostic methods. it was also concluded that microbiological analysis in practice should include a larger number of bacterial species to better serve as markers for a diseased associated flora in chronic periodontitis  cases.

AB  == introduction: the aim of this study was to investigate the microbiologic and immunologic factors related to orthodontic treatment-induced gingival enlargement (ge). methods: our study included 12 patients with ge undergoing fixed orthodontic treatment and 12 periodontally healthy controls. at baseline, periodontal variables, subgingival plaque samples, and gingival crevicular fluid  (gcf) samples were taken from 2 preselected sites in both the ge and the control  groups. the levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola and tannerella  forsythia were determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction. gcf interleukin (il)-1beta and transforming growth factor-beta 1 (tgf-beta1) were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (invitrogen, camarillo, calif). periodontal therapy was given to the ge group, and all parameters were reassessed after 4 weeks. results: at baseline, the ge group showed higher prevalences of the 5 periodontal pathogens than did the control group (p <0.05). il-1beta and tgf-beta1 levels at the ge sites were also significantly higher than those at the control sites (p <0.05). four weeks after periodontal therapy, the ge group showed significant improvements in the clinical parameters associated with significant reductions of p gingivalis, a actinomycetemcomitans, and t denticola. the levels of il-1beta decreased significantly compared with the baseline (p <0.05), whereas there was no significant change in tgf-beta1 levels (p >0.05). conclusions: periodontal pathogens might have a relationship with the initiation  and development of orthodontic treatment-induced ge. inflammatory cytokines (il-1beta and tgf-beta1) can also be considered as contributing factors.

AB  == background: helicobacter pylori plays a significant role in gastric disease. the  aim of the present pilot study was to evaluate the prevalence of h. pylori detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction (real-time pcr) in the sub-gingival plaque of chronic periodontitis patients and to determine periodontopathogens profile of positive sites at h. pylori. methodology: 109 subgingival samples collected from 17 subjects with chronic periodontitis were studied. the dna was extracted from the oral samples and analyzed for the presence of h. pylori by real-time pcr (lightcycler) using 16s rrna#120 primers which targeted the 16s rrna gene. dna from h. pylori dsm 4867 was used as a positive control. seven bacteria implicated in chronic periodontitis were selected to explore the presence of these periodontopathic species in the oral positive sites for h. pylori. results: 16 of 109 samples (14.7%) were positives of h. pylori. all the positives sites were also positives to fusobacterium nucleatum and eikenella corrodens, 62.5% to porphyromonas gingivalis, 31.25% to treponema denticola, 25% to prevotella intermedia, 12.5% to aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and 6.25% to tannerella forsythia. conclusions: h. pylori may be present in the subgingival plaque samples of patients with chronic periodontitis who are resident in a developing country. f. nucleatum and e. corrodens could coaggregate with h. pylori in the subgingival dental plaque.

TI  == effect of periodontopathogen lipopolysaccharides and proinflammatory cytokines on cd46, cd55, and cd59 gene/protein expression by oral epithelial cells.
AB  == membrane-anchored complement regulatory proteins (crps), including cd46, cd55, and cd59, protect host cells from complement attack. in the present study, we investigated whether periodontopathogen lipopolysaccharide and proinflammatory cytokines modulate crp gene/protein expression in human oral epithelial cells. the lipopolysaccharide of treponema denticola and tannerella forsythia were the most potent for increasing the gene expression of cd55 and cd59, and to a lesser  extent cd46, after a 48-h stimulation. an lipopolysaccharide-induced upregulation of epithelial cell-surface crp was also demonstrated. the stimulation of epithelial cells with lipopolysaccharide was associated with interleukin-6 (il-6) and il-8 secretion. although these two cytokines had no effect on cd46 and cd55 gene expression in epithelial cells, il-1beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha induced a significant upregulation. the cell-surface expression of crp was also increased by the stimulation of epithelial cells with cytokines. the cd46, cd55,  and cd59 gene/protein expression was upregulated by periodontopathogen lipopolysaccharide and proinflammatory cytokines. it can be hypothesized that, when faced with bacterial challenges and inflammatory conditions associated with  active periodontal sites, oral epithelial cells may respond by increasing crp gene/protein expression to avoid cell lysis by the complement system, which is activated during periodontitis.

TI  == inhibition of host- and bacteria-derived proteinases by natural anthocyanins.
AB  == background and objectives: host- and bacteria-derived proteinases are considered  to play critical roles in periodontitis progression. this study investigated the  ability of a blackcurrant extract and its major anthocyanins (cyanidin-3-o-glucoside, cyanidin-3-o-rutinoside and delphinidin-3-o-rutinoside)  to inhibit the activity of matrix metalloproteinases (mmps), neutrophil elastase  and periodontopathogen (porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola) proteinases. material and methods: enzyme inhibition was detected using fluorometric and colorimetric assays after incubating blackcurrant extract and its major anthocyanins (at concentrations of 6.25, 12.5, 25 and 50 mug/ml) with mmps, elastase or bacterial proteinases, along with their specific substrates. substrate degradation was recorded every hour for up to 4 h. results: the blackcurrant extract (50 mug/ml) inhibited all proteinases tested. mmp-1 and  mmp-9 were significantly inhibited by pure anthocyanins at concentrations ranging from 6.25 to 50 mug/ml. elastase activity was inhibited by cyanidin-3-o-glucoside and cyanidin-3-o-rutinoside in the range of 6.25-50 mug/ml and by delphinidin-3-o-rutinoside at 50 mug/ml. p. gingivalis, t. forsythia and t. denticola proteinases were also significantly inhibited by pure anthocyanins. in  all cases, enzyme inhibition was time-dependent. conclusion: our study showed that a blackcurrant extract and its major anthocyanins were able to inhibit the activity of host- and bacteria-derived proteinases. this suggests that such natural compounds may represent promising agents for use in adjunctive treatments for periodontitis.

TI  == viral-bacterial associations in acute apical abscesses.
AB  == objective: viral-bacterial and bacterial synergism have been suggested to contribute to the pathogenesis of several human diseases. this study sought to investigate the possible associations between 9 candidate endodontic bacterial pathogens and 9 human viruses in samples from acute apical abscesses. study design: dna extracts from purulent exudate aspirates of 33 cases of acute apical  abscess were surveyed for the presence of 9 selected bacterial species using a 16s ribosomal rna gene-based nested polymerase chain reaction (pcr) approach. single or nested pcr assays were used for detection of the human papillomavirus (hpv) and herpesviruses types 1 to 8. results: two-thirds of the abscess samples  were positive for at least one of the target viruses. specifically, the most frequently detected viruses were hhv-8 (54.5%); hpv (9%); and varicella zoster virus (vzv), epstein-barr virus (ebv), and hhv-6 (6%). bacterial dna was present  in all cases and the most prevalent bacterial species were treponema denticola (70%), tannerella forsythia (67%), porphyromonas endodontalis (67%), dialister invisus (61%), and dialister pneumosintes (57.5%). hhv-8 was positively associated with 7 of the target bacterial species and hpv with 4, but all these associations were weak. several bacterial pairs showed a moderate positive association. viral coinfection was found in 6 abscess cases, but no significant viral association could be determined. conclusions: findings demonstrated that bacterial and viral dna occurred concomitantly in two-thirds of the samples from  endodontic abscesses. although this may suggest a role for viruses in the etiology of apical abscesses, the possibility also exists that the presence of viruses in abscess samples is merely a consequence of the bacterially induced disease process. further studies are necessary to clarify the role of these viral-bacterial interactions, if any, in the pathogenesis of acute apical abscesses.

TI  == clustering of subgingival microbial species in adolescents with periodontitis.
AB  == it has become increasingly recognized that groups of microorganisms interact within the subgingival plaque of adult subjects with periodontitis. it is much less clear, however, whether the consortia of microorganisms associated with periodontitis are different in early and more advanced cases of periodontitis. to investigate this point further, subgingival plaque was collected from six sites in 87 adolescents with periodontitis and 73 controls and the samples were analyzed for the detection of 18 microbial species using the dna-dna hybridization technique. actinomyces oris accounted for the highest proportion of the flora and was more predominant among controls. prevotella nigrescens, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, and tannerella forsythia were present at higher levels among the subjects with periodontitis. factor analyses identified one factor characterized by highly positive loadings for t. forsythia, campylobacter rectus, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, p. nigrescens, parvimonas micra, and treponema denticola, and another factor characterized by highly positive loadings of a. oris, capnocytophaga ochracea, eikenella corrodens, streptococcus intermedius, selenomonas noxia, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguinis, and veillonella parvula. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and streptococcus mutans did not load on any of the two factors, while fusobacterium  nucleatum loaded on both. these findings confirm the occurrence of clustering of  subgingival bacteria according to case status also among young individuals.

TI  == association of red complex, a. actinomycetemcomitans and non-oral bacteria with periodontal diseases.
AB  == objective: pathogens related to systemic infections have been detected in the periodontal microbiota. the relationship amongst these pathogens, periodontal bacteria and periodontal clinical status is poorly understood. this study evaluated the association amongst red complex, a. actinomycetemcomitans (a.a) and non-oral pathogenic bacteria in subjects with good periodontal health (ph), gingivitis (g), chronic (cp) and aggressive (ap) periodontitis. methods: subgingival biofilm samples were obtained from 51 ph, 42 g, 219 cp and 90 ap subjects. the presence and levels of a.a, red complex (porphyromonas gingivalis,  tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola), acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia  coli, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and staphylococcus aureus were determined by dna probes and dna-dna hybridization technique. results: cp and ap subjects presented significantly higher prevalence and levels of a.a, red  complex and a. baumannii than g and ph individuals (p<0.01), whereas s. aureus was detected in lower frequency and counts in ap as compared to the other groups  (p<0.001). the predictor variables age, prevalence of red complex, and the presence of a. baumannii and p. aeruginosa were strongly associated with the frequency of sites with pd and cal >/=5 mm. increasing age (or 1.08), high frequency of red complex (or 6.10), and the presence of a.a with p. aeruginosa (or 1.90) were associated with periodontal disease (p<0.001). subjects harbouring a high prevalence of a.a, a. baumannii, and red complex with p. aeruginosa were more likely to have ap than cp (p<0.001). conclusion: putative periodontal pathogens and non-oral bacteria alone or in association were strongly associated  with periodontitis.

TI  == effect of teenage smoking on the prevalence of periodontal bacteria.
AB  == the aim of our study was to investigate how teenage smoking affects the prevalence of periodontal bacteria and periodontal health with the hypothesis that smoking increases the prevalence of the bacteria. oral health of 264 adolescents (15- to 16-year-olds) was clinically examined, and their smoking history was recorded. the participants also filled in a structured questionnaire  recording their general health and health habits. pooled subgingival plaque samples were taken for polymerase chain reaction analysis of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, and treponema denticola. the prevalence of p.  intermedia (21% vs. 4%, p = 0.01) and t. forsythia and t. denticola (23% vs. 8%,  p < 0.05, for both) was higher among female smokers than among non-smokers. t. forsythia and t. denticola were more often associated with bleeding on probing (29% vs. 12%; 25% vs. 10%, respectively) and deep pockets (25% vs. 15%; 23% vs. 10%, respectively) with smokers than non-smokers. among the girls, a significant  association was found between pack-years and the prevalence of p. nigrescens (p < 0.007). in both genders, a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis were rare in  this study. to conclude, periodontal bacteria were associated with higher periodontal index scores among all teenage smokers. smoking girls harbored more frequently certain periodontal bacteria than non-smokers, but this was not seen in boys. hence, our study hypothesis was only partly confirmed.

TI  == polymicrobial infection with periodontal pathogens specifically enhances microrna mir-146a in apoe-/- mice during experimental periodontal disease.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia are periodontal pathogens associated with the etiology of adult periodontitis as polymicrobial infections. recent studies demonstrated that oral infection with p. gingivalis induces both periodontal disease and atherosclerosis in hyperlipidemic and proatherogenic apoe(-/-) mice. in this study, we explored the expression of micrornas (mirnas) in maxillas (periodontium) and spleens isolated from apoe(-/-) mice infected with p. gingivalis, t. denticola, and t. forsythia as a polymicrobial infection. mirna expression levels, including mirna mir-146a, and associated mrna expression levels of the inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha) and interleukin-1beta (il-1beta) were measured in the maxillas and spleens from mice infected with periodontal pathogens and compared to those in the maxillas and spleens from sham-infected controls. furthermore, in response to these periodontal pathogens (as mono- and polymicrobial heat-killed and live bacteria), human thp-1 monocytes demonstrated similar mirna expression patterns, including that of mir-146a, in vitro. strikingly, mir-146a had a negative correlation with tnf-alpha secretion in vitro, reducing levels of the adaptor kinases il-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (irak-1) and tnf receptor-associated factor 6 (traf6). thus, our studies revealed a persistent association of mir-146a expression with these periodontal pathogens, suggesting that mir-146a may directly or indirectly modulate or alter the chronic periodontal pathology induced by these microorganisms.

TI  == identification of periodontal pathogens and severity of periodontitis in patients with and without chronic kidney disease.
AB  == objective: in this study of patients with chronic periodontitis (cp), the severity of the disease and the main periodontal pathogens identified in patients with chronic kidney disease (ckd) were compared with those detected in individuals without systemic disease. design: nineteen patients with cp without evidence of systemic disease (control group), 25 patients with cp and ckd who were in the pre-dialysis stages (pre-dialysis group), and 22 patients with cp and ckd who were on renal replacement therapy (rrt group) were examined. the severity of cp was based on the investigation of probing depth (pd) and clinical attachment level (cal). the definition and stage of ckd were based on the criteria proposed by the kidney disease outcomes quality initiative of the national kidney foundation. glomerular filtration rate (gfr) was estimated using  the equation of modification of diet in renal disease and the identification of microorganisms in subgingival plaque was performed using polymerase chain reaction (pcr). results: candida albicans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola were more common in patients who were on rrt and pre-dialysis than in control subjects. cp was more severe in patients with ckd. a strong association was observed between the frequency of c. albicans (p =  0.056), p.gingivalis (p = 0.008), t. denticola (p = 0.013) and cal, when ckd patients were compared with the control group. conclusion: cp is more severe and  is associated with increased frequency of c. albicans, p. gingivalis, t. forsythia, and t. denticola in patients with ckd.

TI  == effect of smoking on subgingival microflora of patients with periodontitis in japan.
AB  == background: smoking is a risk factor for periodontitis. to clarify the contribution of smoking to periodontitis, it is essential to assess the relationship between smoking and the subgingival microflora. the aim of this study was to gain an insight into the influence of smoking on the microflora of japanese patients with periodontitis. methods: sixty-seven japanese patients with chronic periodontitis (19 to 83 years old, 23 women and 44 men) were enrolled in  the present study. they consisted of 30 smokers and 37 non-smokers. periodontal parameters including probing pocket depth (ppd) and bleeding on probing (bop) and oral hygiene status were recorded. detection of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, fusobacterium nucleatum/periodonticum, treponema denticola  and campylobacter rectus in subgingival plaque samples was performed by polymerase chain reaction. association between the detection of periodontopathic  bacteria and smoking status was analyzed by multiple logistic regression analysis and chi-square test. results: a statistically significant association was found between having a ppd >/= 4 mm and detection of t. denticola, p. intermedia, t. forsythia, or c. rectus, with odds ratios ranging from 2.17 to 3.54. a significant association was noted between bop and the detection of c. rectus or p. intermedia, and smoking, with odds ratios ranging from 1.99 to 5.62. prevalence of c. rectus was higher in smokers than non-smokers, whereas that of a. actinomycetemcomitans was lower in smokers. conclusions: within limits, the analysis of the subgingival microbial flora in smokers and non-smokers with chronic periodontitis suggests a relevant association between smoking and colonization by the specific periodontal pathogens including c. rectus.

TI  == use of quantitative pcr to evaluate methods of bacteria sampling in periodontal patients.
AB  == periodontal disease is associated with specific periodontal pathogens and may persist as gingivitis or progress to more severe disease. the bacteria involved in disease initiation and progression have not been identified. we used quantitative polymerase chain reaction (pcr) to compare the levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola, and total bacteria detected by different sampling methods. on the basis of the results of clinical examinations, 57 patients were divided into 3 groups: healthy group (group a), gingivitis group (group b), and periodontitis group (group c). bacterial samples were collected from saliva, mouthwash, and by paper-point sampling of gingival crevicular fluid (gcf), and the samples were analyzed with quantitative pcr targeting 16s rrna. the numbers of total bacteria in samples of  gcf, saliva, and mouthwash were 10(5) to 10(6), 10(8), and 10(7), respectively, per milliliter. the number of p. gingivalis in gcf samples was lower than 10 in group a; however, in groups b and c, the values were 10(3) and 10(4), respectively, indicating that the number of p. gingivalis increased with worsening clinical status. findings were similar in the samples of saliva and mouthwash. the numbers of t. forsythia showed a pattern similar to that of p. gingivalis in all 3 samples. these results suggest that saliva and mouthwash samples are clinically useful for bacterial testing of periodontal diseases by quantitative pcr. in addition, mouthwash sampling is more feasible and straightforward than saliva sampling.

AB  == the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of a single application of antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (apdt) on microbiological profile and cytokine pattern in dogs. periodontal disease was induced by placing 3.0 silk ligatures around the mandibular pre-molars bilaterally during 8 weeks. the dogs were randomly treated with apdt using a dye/laser system, scaling and root planning (srp), or with the association of treatments (srp + apdt). plaque samples were collected at baseline, 1, 3, and 4 weeks, and the mean counts of 40 species were  determined using dna-dna hybridization. gingival biopsies were removed and the expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha), receptor activator of nf-kb ligand (rankl), osteoprotegerin (opg), matrix metalloproteinase (mmp-1), interleukin (il) 6, il-10 and total bacterial load by analysis of 16 s rrna gene  were evaluated through real-time pcr. the results shows that the levels of the majority of the species were reduced 1 week post-therapy for all treatments, however, an increase in counts of prevotella intermedia (p = 0.00), prevotella. nigrescens (p = 0.00) and tannerella forsythia (p = 0.00) was observed for apdt and srp + apdt. after 4 weeks, a regrowth of porphyromonas gingivalis (p = 0.00)  and treponema denticola (p = 0.00), was observed for all treatments. also, a strikingly reduction of counts on counts of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans was observed for the apdt (p = 0.00). for the cytokine pattern, the results were  similar for all treatments, and a reduction in the expression of cytokines and bacterial load was observed throughout the study. our results suggest that srp, apdt in a single application, and srp + apdt affects different bacterial species  and have similar effects on the expression of cytokines evaluated during the treatment of ligature-induced periodontitis.

AB  == periodontopathic bacteria such as porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythia, campylobacter rectus and treponema denticola play an important role in the initiation and progression of periodontitis. the aim of this investigation was to evaluate the relationship between periodontal clinical parameters and the subgingival profile of periodontopathic bacteria. twenty-six periodontitis patients (23-62 years of age; mean age, 40.2+/-13.2) with no systemic disease agreed to participate in the study. periodontal clinical parameters, including probing depth (pd) and bleeding on probing (bop) were recorded. subgingival plaque samples were obtained from deep (pd>/=4 mm) and shallow (pd</=3 mm) pockets in each patient for detection of p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, t. forsythia, c. rectus and t. denticola by polymerase chain reaction technique. the relationship between the periodontal  pathogens and clinical parameters was determined with the fisher exact test, and  a statistically significant association was found between detection of p. gingivalis, t. forsythia, c. rectus and t. denticola and pd or bop. t. denticola  was the most prevalent pathogen in both shallow pd and deep pd sites. no statistically significant association was found between detection of a. actinomycetemcomitans and the clinical parameters examined. a statistically significant association was found between detection of the red complex bacteria and the clinical parameters. these results suggest that the red complex pathogens and c. rectus play an important role in the initiation and progression of periodontitis.

TI  == relationship between oral status and prevalence of periodontopathic bacteria on the tongues of elderly individuals.
AB  == colonization of periodontopathic bacteria is associated with increased risk of systemic diseases. however, few studies have investigated the relationships between oral status factors and health-related quality of life (hr-qol) and the prevalence of such bacteria in elderly individuals. this study investigated the prevalence of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola and tannerella forsythia in 165 community-dwelling functionally independent 85-year-old japanese individuals (93 dentate, 72 edentulous) and the  relationship to oral status, including oral malodour and hr-qol. all four of the  studied periodontopathic bacteria were found more frequently in tongue coating samples from dentate than edentulous subjects, and the prevalence of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and treponema denticola was significantly related to the number of teeth with a periodontal pocket depth >/=4 mm. these results suggest the existence of a stable circulation of periodontopathic bacteria between the gingival sulcus and tongue coating over time with teeth. in addition, the presence of teeth with a deep pocket and colonization of treponema denticola were positively related to the level of ch(3)sh, whilst the number of present teeth contributed positively to hr-qol, especially with regard to mental health. in conclusion, as the dentate state can  retain colonization of periodontopathic pathogens in the oral cavity, both periodontal treatment and tongue care are important for maintaining a healthy oral status in the elderly, and possibly result in avoidance of risk for tooth loss and decline in hr-qol, as well as protecting from systemic diseases.

AB  == the association between phenytoin-induced gingival hyperplasia (pigh) and five major periodontopathic bacteria was investigated by real-time pcr in 12 subjects  (30.6 +/- 7.95 years of age) with severe motor and intellectual disabilities. the subjects had not received antibiotics or periodontal therapy within three months. a healthy gingival site or a site with the lowest gingival hyperplasia score (minimum site), and a site with the maximum score of gingival hyperplasia (maximum site) on each subject were selected for investigation. the clinical parameters were measured after microbial sampling. the following results were obtained: 1. the detection rates of both treponema denticola and porphyromonas gingivalis were 75% (9/12) at the maximum sites, and that of tannerella forsythia was 33.3% (4/12). the detection rate of prevotella intermedia was 58.3% (7/12), but no significant correlation was observed between this bacterium and the other  types of bacteria in quantitative analysis. 2. the detection rate of p. gingivalis with type ii fima was 25% (1/4) at the minimum sites, and 83.3% (5/6)  at the maximum sites. 3. the samples were divided into three groups; namely, those with no detection of p. gingivalis at either the minimum sites or the maximum sites, no detection at the minimum sites but detection at the maximum sites, and detection at both sites. in conclusion, 1) the detection rates of t. denticola and p. gingivalis were the highest at the maximum sites. in particular, the detection rate of p. gingivalis with type ii fima was high in the present study, and 2) the subgingival microflora was diverse because of the diverse severity of gingival inflammation associated with pigh.

AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate the ability of the bana test to detect different levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola and tannerella  forsythia or their combinations in subgingival samples at the initial diagnosis and after periodontal therapy. periodontal sites with probing depths between 5-7  mm and clinical attachment level between 5-10 mm, from 53 subjects with chronic periodontitis, were sampled in four periods: initial diagnosis (t0), immediately  (t1), 45 (t2) and 60 days (t3) after scaling and root planing. bana test and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization identified red complex species in the subgingival biofilm. in all experimental periods, the highest frequencies of score 2 (checkerboard dna-dna hybridization) for p. gingivalis, t. denticola and  t. forsythia were observed when strong enzymatic activity (bana) was present (p < 0.01). the best agreement was observed at initial diagnosis. the bana test sensitivity was 95.54% (t0), 65.18% (t1), 65.22% (t2) and 50.26% (t3). the specificity values were 12.24% (t0), 57.38% (t1), 46.27% (t2) and 53.48% (t3). the bana test is more effective for the detection of red complex pathogens when the bacterial levels are high, i.e. in the initial diagnosis of chronic periodontitis.

TI  == periodontitis: a polymicrobial disruption of host homeostasis.
AB  == periodontitis, or gum disease, affects millions of people each year. although it  is associated with a defined microbial composition found on the surface of the tooth and tooth root, the contribution of bacteria to disease progression is poorly understood. commensal bacteria probably induce a protective response that  prevents the host from developing disease. however, several bacterial species found in plaque (the 'red-complex' bacteria: porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola) use various mechanisms to interfere with host  defence mechanisms. furthermore, disease may result from 'community-based' attack on the host. here, i describe the interaction of the host immune system with the  oral bacteria in healthy states and in diseased states.

TI  == mixture of periodontopathogenic bacteria influences interaction with kb cells.
AB  == introduction: the purpose of this study was to investigate the adhesion and invasion of periodontopathogenic bacteria in varied mixed infections and the release of interleukins from an epithelial cell line (kb cells). methods: kb cells were co-cultured with porphyromonas gingivalis atcc 33277 and m5-1-2, tannerella forsythia atcc 43037, treponema denticola atcc 35405 and fusobacterium nucleatum atcc 25586 in single and mixed infections. the numbers of adherent and  internalized bacteria were determined up to 18 h after bacterial exposure. additionally, the mrna expression and concentrations of released interleukin (il)-6 and il-8 were measured. results: all periodontopathogenic bacteria adhered and internalized in different numbers to kb cells, but individually without any evidence of co-aggregation also to f. nucleatum. high levels of epithelial mrna of il-6 and il-8 were detectable after all bacterial challenges. after the mixed  infection of p. gingivalis atcc 33277 and f. nucleatum atcc 25586 the highest levels of released interleukins were found. no il-6 and il-8 were detectable after the mixed infection of p. gingivalis m5-1-2 and f. nucleatum atcc 25586 and the fourfold infection of p. gingivalis atcc 33277, t. denticola atcc 35405, t. forsythia atcc 43037 and f. nucleatum atcc 25586. conclusion: anaerobic periodontopathogenic bacteria promote the release of il-6 and il-8 by epithelial  cells. despite a continuous epithelial expression of il-8 mrna by all bacterial infections these effects are temporary because of the time-dependent degradation  of cytokines by bacterial proteases. mixed infections have a stronger virulence potential than single bacteria. further research is necessary to evaluate the role of mixed infections and biofilms in the pathogenesis of periodontitis.

TI  == do elderly edentulous patients with a history of periodontitis harbor periodontal pathogens?
AB  == objectives: the presence of periodontal pathogens in the oral cavity may impact implant survival. therefore, this study aimed to determine the prevalence of campylobacter rectus, porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, eikenella corrodens and parvimonas micra in a specific elderly population with a history of periodontitis who have never worn dentures. material and methods: thirty dentate subjects (mean age 61.7+/-7.05 years) and 30 edentulous subjects (mean age 65.8+/-8.05 years) were included in this cross-sectional study. microbiological samples of cheek mucosa and the dorsum of  the tongue were taken from all subjects. in addition, sulcus samples were taken from the dentate group. all samples were analysed using a bacterial dna-specific  polymerase chain reaction. results: all the pathogens studied were detected in dentate and edentulous subjects. when cheek and tongue samples were combined, c.  rectus, a. actinomycetemcomitans and e. corrodens presented with a similar prevalence in both groups, whereas the other species were more prevalent specifically in the dentate group (p<0.05). in dentate subjects, p. intermedia and t. denticola were present in higher frequencies in the cheek mucosa (26.67% and 66.67%, respectively), whereas p. gingivalis and t. forsythia were more prevalent in the tongue samples (26.67% and 56.67%, respectively). conclusions: periodontal pathogens may persist in the oral cavity of edentulous subjects who have had periodontal disease, even 1 year after the extraction of all teeth and in the absence of other hard surfaces in the mouth.

TI  == synergistic effects of lipopolysaccharides from periodontopathic bacteria on pro-inflammatory cytokine production in an ex vivo whole blood model.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia have been strongly associated with chronic periodontitis. this disease is characterized by  an accumulation of inflammatory cells in periodontal tissue and subgingival sites. the secretion of high levels of inflammatory cytokines by those cells is believed to contribute to periodontal tissue destruction. the aim of this study was to investigate the inflammatory response of whole blood from periodontitis patients following challenges with whole cells of p. gingivalis, t. denticola, and t. forsythia or their lipopolysaccharides (lps), individually and in combination. whole blood collected from seven periodontitis patients was stimulated with whole cells or lps and the production of interleukin (il)-1beta,  il-6, il-8, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha) were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. the mono and mixed challenges with whole bacterial cells or lps induced the secretion of high amounts of il-1beta, il-6, il-8, and tnf-alpha by the mixed leukocyte population from periodontitis patients. in addition, p. gingivalis lps, t. denticola lps, and t. forsythia lps  acted in synergy to induce high levels of il-1beta and tnf-alpha. this study suggests that p. gingivalis, t. denticola, and t. forsythia may contribute to the immunodestructive host response characteristic of periodontitis through synergistic effects of their lps on the inflammatory response induced by a mixed  population of leukocytes.

TI  == efficacy of amoxicillin and metronidazole combination for the management of generalized aggressive periodontitis.
AB  == background: the aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of metronidazole-amoxicillin combination on clinical and microbiologic parameters in patients with generalized aggressive periodontitis. methods: twenty-eight patients were randomly included. the test group (n = 12) received amoxicillin-metronidazole combination and scaling and root planing; the control group (n = 16) received scaling and root planing alone. in addition to the clinical examinations, subgingival plaque samples were analyzed for total cultivable bacteria and the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), treponema denticola, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, prevotella pallens, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) using polymerase chain reaction. results: all clinical parameters improved significantly compared to baseline (p <0.05) in both groups. there was a statistically significant reduction of pockets and clinical attachment gain in the combined group compared to the control group (p <0.05). total counts of bacteria also decreased significantly at 3 and 6 months in both groups (p <0.05). t. denticola and t. forsythia were the most prevalent bacteria throughout the study. t. denticola showed a continuous decrease over 6 months in the test group, whereas no change was seen in the control group beyond 3 months. p. gingivalis decreased significantly at 3 months (p <0.05), whereas t. forsythia was the only  pathogen decreased below detection limits by the combination therapy with a significant difference compared to the control group (p <0.05). conclusions: the  results from this study suggest that combined amoxicillin and metronidazole use as an adjunct to scaling and root planing leads to better clinical healing compared to mechanical treatment alone. the polypharmaceutical approach used results in a significant and substantial decrease in t. forsythia and prevents its recolonization for 6 months, suggesting that t. forsythia may determine the long-term stability of periodontal treatment outcomes.

TI  == periodontal bacterial load: a proposed new epidemiological method for periodontal disease assessment.
AB  == aim: the purpose of this study was to identify a periodontal clinical measure that correlates with red complex bacteria usually associated with periodontal disease. methods and materials: periodontal clinical parameters were recorded in  116 postpartum women at six sites per tooth for all teeth excluding third molars. two subgingival plaque samples per subject were collected and analyzed for 39 bacterial species using the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique. periodontal bacterial load (pbl) was calculated as the sum of all pocket depth measurements of 4 mm at sites with a clinical attachment level (cal) of 4 mm. the association of clinical and bacterial scores was analyzed using the spearman correlation coefficient and the kruskal-wallis test. results: the pbl was correlated with microorganisms from the red complex that included porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola, individually or grouped (p<0.05). the pbl was not associated with periodontally beneficial species from the yellow, green, purple, and blue complexes (p>0.05). the proportions and mean counts of the red complex were increased according to the quartile groups of distribution of the pbl. conclusion: pbl appears to be a reliable measure of periodontal status in postpartum women. clinical significance: pbl avoids bias in the assessment of periodontal status in studies  of periodontal disease.

AB  == background: the purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, patient acceptance, and short-term microbiologic effect of a new air-polishing device in  subjects in maintenance care with residual pockets > or =5 mm. methods: this was  an examiner-masked, randomized, split-mouth clinical trial. a new disposable nozzle, allowing the subgingival application of amino acid glycine powder at a limited pressure, was compared to scaling and root planing (srp) in 50 subjects with residual pockets during the maintenance phase. after removing supragingival  deposits, the spray was applied for 4 to 5 seconds in all sites > or =5 mm in the test quadrant, whereas srp was used in the control quadrant. microbiologic samples were taken from one treated test and one control site 2 days before and 7 days after treatment. total bacterial counts and the counts of six periodontal pathogens were determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction. results: no adverse event was noted in any subject for the test or control treatment. using a visual analog scale, the patients perceived the test treatment to be significantly less painful/uncomfortable than the hand instrumentation (p <0.001). significantly less time was used by the operator for the test procedure  (p <0.001). the reduction in bleeding on probing was significant for the treated  sites in the test and control quadrants (p = 0.019 and p <0.001, respectively), but traditional srp reduced the bleeding tendency significantly more than air polishing (p = 0.045). the differences in the total bacterial load and the counts of six periodontal pathogens between the test and control sites did not reach statistical significance. the longitudinal reduction was significant in control sites for total bacteria load (p <0.001), porphyromonas gingivalis (p = 0.01), treponema denticola (p <0.001), and tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis) (p <0.001). conclusion: subgingival air polishing with a new device was safe (no adverse events were noted), perceived to be more acceptable by the patients, and was more time-efficient than srp; however, on a microbiologic level, it was not superior to conventional srp.

TI  == microbiologic testing and outcomes of full-mouth scaling and root planing with or without amoxicillin/metronidazole in chronic periodontitis.
AB  == background: it has been suggested that use of systemic antibiotics should be limited to patients with specific microbiologic profiles. the main purpose of the present analysis was to study whether microbiologic testing before therapy was of value in predicting which patients would specifically benefit from adjunctive amoxicillin and metronidazole, given in the context of full-mouth scaling and root planing (srp) within 48 hours. methods: this was a 6-month, single-center, double-masked, placebo-controlled, randomized longitudinal study. fifty-one patients received full-mouth periodontal debridement, performed within 48 hours;  then, 25 subjects received metronidazole, 500 mg, and amoxicillin, 375 mg, three  times a day for 7 days, and 26 received a placebo (control group). pooled microbiologic samples were taken from the deepest pocket at baseline in each quadrant before and 6 months after treatment. six periodontal pathogens were quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction. results: forty-seven patients  were followed for 6 months. after treatment, test subjects had a substantially lower mean number of persisting sites with probing depth >4 mm and bleeding on probing than did control subjects (0.4 versus 3.0; p = 0.005; month 6). aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) could not be detected in the antibiotic group after treatment. however, in the placebo group, three of six subjects positive for a. actinomycetemcomitans continued to be positive. lower frequencies were also noted in the test group for porphyromonas gingivalis (p = 0.013) and tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis) (p = 0.007). however, even subjects testing negative for a. actinomycetemcomitans at baseline had a significantly better primary clinical outcome if they received the active drugs. the presence of six putative periodontal pathogens (a. actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum spp., p. gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola, and t. forsythia) quantified prior to therapy was not correlated with the outcome of full-mouth srp with or without amoxicillin and metronidazole. conclusion: excellent clinical results in the antibiotics group were obtained regardless of the presence or absence of six classic periodontal periopathogens prior to treatment.

TI  == evaluating clinical periodontal measures as surrogates for bacterial exposure: the oral infections and vascular disease epidemiology study (invest).
AB  == background: epidemiologic studies of periodontal infection as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease often use clinical periodontal measures as a surrogate for the underlying bacterial exposure of interest. there are currently no methodological studies evaluating which clinical periodontal measures best reflect the levels of subgingival bacterial colonization in population-based settings. we investigated the characteristics of clinical periodontal definitions that were most representative of exposure to bacterial species that are believed  to be either markers, or themselves etiologic, of periodontal disease. methods: 706 men and women aged >or= 55 years, residing in northern manhattan were enrolled. using dna-dna checkerboard hybridization in subgingival biofilms, standardized values for aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola and tannerella forsythia were averaged within mouth and summed to define "bacterial burden". correlations of bacterial burden with clinical periodontal constructs defined by the severity and extent of attachment loss (al), pocket depth (pd) and bleeding on probing (bop) were assessed. results: clinical periodontal constructs demonstrating the highest correlations with bacterial burden were: i) percent of sites with bop (r = 0.62); ii) percent of sites with pd >or= 3 mm (r = 0.61); and iii) number of sites with  bop (r = 0.59). increasing pd or al severity thresholds consistently attenuated correlations, i.e., the correlation of bacterial burden with the percent of sites with pd >or= 8 mm was only r = 0.16. conclusions: clinical exposure definitions of periodontal disease should incorporate relatively shallow pockets to best reflect whole mouth exposure to bacterial burden.

TI  == association of human t lymphotropic virus 1 amplification of periodontitis severity with altered cytokine expression in response to a standard periodontopathogen infection.
AB  == background: periodontal diseases (pds) are infectious diseases in which periodontopathogens trigger chronic inflammatory and immune responses that lead to tissue destruction. recently, viruses have been implicated in the pathogenesis of pds. individuals infected with human t lymphotropic virus 1 (htlv-1) present with abnormal oral health and a marked increased prevalence of periodontal disease. methods: in this study, we investigated the patterns of periodontopathogen infection and local inflammatory immune markers in htlv-1-seropositive individuals with chronic periodontitis (cp/htlv-1 group) compared with htlv-1-seronegative individuals with chronic periodontitis (cp group) and periodontally healthy, htlv-1-seronegative individuals (control group). results: patients in the cp/htlv-1 group had significantly higher values  of bleeding on probing, mean probing depth, and attachment loss than patients in  the cp group. the expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin (il)  4 was found to be similar in the cp and cp/htlv-1 groups, whereas il-12 and il-17 levels trended toward a higher expression in the cp/htlv-1 group. a significant increase was seen in the levels of il-1beta and interferon gamma in the cp/htlv-1 group compared with the cp group, whereas expression of the regulatory t cell marker foxp3 and il-10 was significantly decreased in the lesions from the cp/htlv-1 group. interestingly, similar frequency and/or load of periodontopathogens (porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans) and frequency of viruses (herpes simplex virus 1, human cytomegalovirus, and epstein-barr virus) characteristically associated with pds were found in the cp/htlv and cp groups. conclusions: htlv-1 may play a critical role in the pathogenesis of periodontal disease through the deregulation of the local cytokine network, resulting in an exacerbated response against a standard periodontopathogen infection.

TI  == transmission of periodontopathic bacteria from natural teeth to implants.
AB  == purpose: prevention of peri-implantitis is essential for the success of implant rehabilitation. infection by periodontopathic bacteria is a major cause of peri-implantitis. the aim of the present study was to identify the source of peri-implant colonization by periodontopathic bacteria. materials and methods: twenty-one patients with implants were enrolled in the study. subgingival plaque  samples from the adjacent, occluding, and contralateral natural teeth were collected prior to second-stage surgery. samples from implant sulci were then obtained 2 weeks later. detection of periodontopathic bacteria was performed by the polymerase chain reaction. results: the detection rates for aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, and fusobacterium nucleatum in all subgingival samples from natural teeth were similar to that in the peri-implant sulci. multiple logistic regression analysis revealed an association between the detection of a. actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and f. nucleatum in the gingival crevices of adjacent teeth and that of the peri-implant sulcus, but no association for tannerella forsythia. conclusions: the present findings suggest that colonization by a. actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and f. nucleatum at the implant sulcus was affected by these microorganisms in the gingival crevice of adjacent teeth rather than those on occluding and contralateral teeth.

TI  == microbiologic changes in subgingival plaque after removal of fixed orthodontic appliances.
AB  == objective: to evaluate changes that occur in the subgingival microbiota after removal of fixed orthodontic appliances using polymerase chain reaction (pcr). materials and methods: thirty orthodontic patients (11 males and 19 females; aged 20 +/- 7.3 yr) were included in this study. subgingival plaque samplings were gathered from the disto-buccal gingival crevice of the left upper central incisors and the left lower central incisors, and from the mesio-buccal gingival  crevice of the left upper first molars and the left lower first molars, at two different times: 2 weeks before appliance removal (t1), and 3 months after appliance removal (t2). dna was extracted from the samples and the 16s rrna-based pcr detection method was used to determine the prevalence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans , tannerella forsythia , campylobacter rectus , eikenella corrodens , porphyromonas gingivalis , prevotella intermedia , prevotella nigrescens , and treponema denticola , which are considered as putative periodontopathogens. results: the frequency of positive sites at t1 and t2 was 65% and 43.3% for c. rectus , and 53.3% and 30.8% for e. corrodens , respectively. for the other bacteria, the frequency tended to be reduced between  times. conclusion: periodontopathogens during orthodontic treatment were significantly reduced within 3 months of appliance removal. however, how long it  takes to return to the preorthodontic composition of the subgingival microbiota and whether it happens at all remain to be seen.

TI  == progression of chronic periodontitis can be predicted by the levels of porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola in subgingival plaque.
AB  == introduction: chronic periodontitis is an inflammatory disease of the supporting  tissues of the teeth associated with bacteria. diagnosis is achieved retrospectively by clinical observation of attachment loss. predicting disease progression would allow for targeted preventive therapy. the aim of this study was to monitor disease progression in patients on a maintenance program and determine the levels of specific bacteria in subgingival plaque samples and then  examine the ability of the clinical parameters of disease and levels of specific  bacteria in the plaque samples to predict disease progression. methods: during a  12-month longitudinal study of 41 subjects, 25 sites in 21 subjects experienced disease progression indicated by at least 2 mm of clinical attachment loss. real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to determine the levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, fusobacterium nucleatum, and prevotella intermedia in subgingival plaque samples. results: no clinical parameters were able to predict periodontal disease progression. in sites undergoing imminent periodontal disease progression within  the next 3 months, significant partial correlations were found between p. gingivalis and t. forsythia (r = 0.55, p < 0.001) and t. denticola and t. forsythia (r = 0.43, p = 0.04). the odds of a site undergoing imminent periodontal disease progression increased with increasing levels of p. gingivalis and t. denticola. conclusion: monitoring the proportions of p. gingivalis and t.  denticola in subgingival plaque has the potential to help identify sites at significant risk for progression of periodontitis, which would assist in the targeted treatment of disease.

TI  == distribution of periodontopathic bacterial species in japanese children with developmental disabilities.
AB  == background: recent developments in molecular biological techniques have enabled rapid detection of periodontopathic bacterial species in clinical specimens. accumulated evidence suggests that detection of specific bacterial species enables identification of subjects at high risk for the onset of periodontitis. we investigated the distribution of 10 selected periodontopathic bacterial species in dental plaque specimens obtained from children with disabilities who were attending daycare centers. methods: a total of 187 children (136 boys, 51 girls) aged 1-6 years old and diagnosed with such disabilities as mental retardation, cerebral palsy, and autism, participated in the study. subgingival dental plaque specimens were collected from the buccal side of the maxillary left second primary molar after a clinical examination. bacterial dna was extracted from the specimens and pcr analyses were carried out to detect 10 selected periodontopathic species using specific primers for each. in addition, statistical analyses were performed to analyze the correlations among clinical parameters and the detected species. results: the most frequently detected species was capnocytophaga sputigena (28.3%), followed by aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (20.9%) and campylobacter rectus (18.2%). eikenella corrodens, capnocytophaga ochracea, and prevotella nigrescence were detected in approximately 10% of the specimens, whereas treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, and prevotella intermedia were rarely found, and porphyromonas gingivalis was not detected in any of the subjects. the total numbers of detected species were positively correlated with the age of the subjects. there were 10 subjects with positive reactions for t. denticola and/or t. forsythia, in whom the total number of bacterial species was significantly higher as compared to the other subjects. furthermore, subjects possessing c. rectus showed significantly greater values for periodontal pocket depth, gingival index, and total number of  species. conclusion: we found that approximately one-fourth of the present subjects with disabilities who possessed at least one of t. denticola, t. forsythia, and c. rectus were at possible risk for periodontitis. follow-up examinations as well as preventive approaches should be utilized for such individuals.

TI  == quantification of periodontal pathogens by paper point sampling from the coronal  and apical aspect of periodontal lesions by real-time pcr.
AB  == the present study compared the recovery of six periodontal pathogens by paper point samples from two different aspects of periodontal lesions by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr). twenty patients with untreated chronic periodontitis were randomized into two groups. before subgingival instrumentation and after 10 weeks samples in group a were taken first with a paper point half length (hp) of the probing depth, then with a paper point full length (fp) at the same site. in group b sampling sequence was reversed. analysis by real-time pcr enabled quantification of six bacteria as well as total bacterial count (tbc). statistical analysis included t test, kappa, and spearman's correlations. higher  tbc could be harvested by use of fp than by hp (mean of differences of ln-transformed counts before therapy: -0.791, ci [-1.515, -0.068], sd 0.770, p =  0.034; after therapy: -0.563, ci [-1.151, 0.024], sd 0.625, p = 0.059). the plaque composition regarding total target pathogens was similar for both samples. both, for tbc as well as for single target bacteria a strong positive correlation was found between hp and fp (kappa, spearman correlation: aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans 0.807, 0.778; fusobacterium nucleatum 0.573, 0.772; porphyromonas gingivalis 0.733, 0.824; prevotella intermedia 0.480, 0.756; treponema denticola 0.807, 0.814; and tannerella forsythia 0.692, 0.695). the recovery of target pathogens was similar following sampling at various depths of  the periodontal lesion.

AB  == aims: our objective was to evaluate the association between the mmp1-1607 single-nucleotide polymorphism (snp), periodontopathogens and inflammatory cytokines with matrix metalloproteinase-1 (mmp-1) mrna levels in vitro and in vivo. materials and methods: this study investigated the influence of genetic (mmp1-1607 snp), microbial (porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) and inflammatory [tumour necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) and interleukin-1beta (il-1beta)] factors on the determination of mmp-1 mrna levels in periodontal tissues of non-smoker chronic periodontitis (cp, n=178) and control (c, n=190) groups. the effects of single and repeated lipopolysaccharide (lps) and inflammatory cytokine stimulation of macrophages with distinct mmp1-1607 snp genotypes were also investigated. results: in healthy tissues, the mmp1-1607 2g allele was associated with higher mmp-1 levels while in cp mmp-1 levels were associated with the presence and load of periodontopathogens, and also with tnf-alpha and il-1beta expression irrespective of the mmp1-1607 genotype. in vitro data demonstrate that in 2g macrophages low- and intermediate-dose lps and tnf-alpha+il-1beta stimulation was associated with increased mmp-1 expression, while strong and repeated stimulation resulted in higher mmp-1 levels irrespective of the mmp1-1607 genotype. conclusion: our data demonstrate a limited role for mmp1-1607 snp in periodontitis, where the extensive chronic antigenic challenge exposure overcomes the genetic control and plays a major role in the determination of mmp-1 expression.

TI  == bone microbial contamination influences autogenous grafting in sinus augmentation.
AB  == background: the oral occurrence of putative microbial pathogens in humans has been documented in health and disease. the presence of periodontopathogens in patients with a history of periodontal disease may have a negative impact on bone regeneration. this investigation was conducted to confirm the presence of periodontal pathogens in bone particles harvested intraorally for maxillary sinus augmentation and to assess the clinical and radiographic outcomes 6 to 12 months  after bone augmentation. methods: culture and polymerase chain reaction (pcr)-based identification were performed by paper-point sampling of intraorally  harvested bone particles in a group of 12 maintenance patients undergoing maxillary sinus augmentation. radiographs were taken to assess and compare bone healing and volume gain at baseline and at 6 to 12 months after augmentation. results: the presence of periodontal pathogens (porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans [previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans], prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia [previously t. forsythensis], fusobacterium nucleatum, parvimonas micra [previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros], campylobacter rectus, enteric gram-negative rods, and dialister pneumosintes) was identified in 10 of 12 patients (83%) by culture, pcr, or both and was associated with greater bone volume loss at 6 months postaugmentation. the pcr-positive triad, p. gingivalis,  a. actinomycetemcomitans, and p. intermedia, was associated with pronounced volume loss of the grafted sinus at 6 months. conclusions: to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to confirm osseous microbial contamination with major periodontopathogens in individuals undergoing maxillary sinus augmentation with a history of periodontitis. the effect on the grafting outcome  translated into bone volume loss in the grafted sinus 6 months postaugmentation.  specific microbial contamination may have an impact on osteogenesis in osseous regeneration.

TI  == microbiological risk for periodontitis of abutment teeth in patients with removable partial dentures.
AB  == tannerella forsythia, porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola are identified as the red complex which exists in high proportions in periodontally diseased patients. the aim of this study was to assess the microbiological risk for periodontitis of abutment teeth in subjects wearing removable partial dentures (rpds) by measuring the red complex using bana-zymetm test. thirty-eight subjects (mean age: 62.2 years) with kennedy class ii partially edentulous arch participated in this study. the red complex and clinical parameters, such as plaque index, gingival index, probing depth and tooth mobility were recorded at abutment teeth in contact with the direct retainer of unilaterally designed rpds  and the corresponding non-abutment teeth on the opposite side. mean scores for the red complex, plaque index, gingival index and tooth mobility of the abutment  teeth were significantly greater than those of the non-abutment teeth (p < 0.01). no significant mean difference in pocket depth was found between the abutment and non-abutment teeth. logistic regression analysis revealed that abutment teeth, high scores of plaque index and a maintenance interval longer than 6 months were  significant predictors for positive red complex scores (p < 0.05). these results  suggest that the microbiological risk for periodontitis of abutment teeth is greater than that for non-abutment teeth in rpd wearers.

TI  == microbiological profile of untreated subjects with localized aggressive periodontitis.
AB  == aim: the microbial profile of localized aggressive periodontitis (lagp) has not yet been determined. therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the subgingival microbial composition of lagp. material and methods: one hundred and  twenty subjects with lagp (n=15), generalized aggressive periodontitis (gagp, n=25), chronic periodontitis (chp, n=30) or periodontal health (ph, n=50) underwent clinical and microbiological assessment. nine subgingival plaque samples were collected from each subject and analysed for their content of 38 bacterial species using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. results: red complex  and some orange complex species are the most numerous and prevalent periodontal pathogens in lagp. the proportions of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans were  elevated in shallow and intermediate pockets of lagp subjects in comparison with  those with gagp or chp, but not in deep sites. this species also showed a negative correlation with age and with the proportions of red complex pathogens.  the host-compatible actinomyces species were reduced in lagp. conclusion: a. actinomycetemcomitans seems to be associated with the onset of lagp, and porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, campylobacter gracilis, eubacterium nodatum and prevotella intermedia play an important role in disease progression. successful treatment of lagp would involve a reduction in these pathogens and an increase in the actinomyces species.

TI  == characterizing traditionally defined periodontal disease in hiv+ adults.
AB  == background: results have varied from previous studies examining the level and extent of periodontal disease (pd) in hiv-1 infected (hiv+) adults. these studies used different methodologies to measure and define pd and examined cohorts with divergent characteristics. inconsistent methodological approaches may have resulted in the underestimation of traditionally-defined pd in hiv+ individuals.  objectives: to characterize the level, extent and predictors (i.e. immunologic, microbiologic, metabolic and behavioral) of pd in an hiv+ cohort during the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy (haart). study design: cross-sectional study. setting: hiv+ adults receiving outpatient care at three major medical clinics in cleveland, oh. subjects were seen from may, 2005 to january, 2008. measurements: full-mouth periodontal examinations included periodontal probing depth (ppd), recession (rec) and clinical attachment level (cal). subgingival plaque was assessed for dna levels of porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola by real-time dna pcr assays developed for each pathogen. rather than using categories, we evaluated pd as three continuous variables based on the percent of teeth with >or=1 site per tooth with ppd >or= 5mm, rec > 0 mm and cal >or= 4mm. results: participants included 112 hiv+ adults. each subject had an average 38% (+/-24%) of their teeth with at least one site of pd >or= 5 mm, 55% (+/-31%) of their teeth with at least one site of rec > 0 mm, and 50% (+/-32%) of their teeth with at least one site of cal >or= 4 mm. cd4+ t-cell count <200 cells/mm(3) was significantly associated with higher levels of  rec and cal, but not ppd. greater levels of pg dna were associated with ppd, rec  and cal.by regression analysis, cd4+ t-cell count <200 cells /mm3 had approximately twice thedeleterious effect on cal as did smoking (standardized beta coefficient 0.306 versus 0.164) [corrected]. annual dental visit compliance  remained an independent predictor for lower levels of pd. conclusions: the level  and extent of pd were high in this cohort even though most patients were being treated with haart. the definition of periodontal disease used and cohort characteristics examined can influence the level of periodontal disease reported  in studies of persons with hiv. traditional periodontal pathogens are associated  with pd in this cohort. those with cd4+ t-cell counts <200 cells/mm(3) are at greater risk for pd. therefore, earlier haart initiation may decrease exposure to immunosuppression and reduce pd morbidity. continuity of dental care remains important for hiv+ patients even when they are being treated with haart.

TI  == detection and quantification of five major periodontal pathogens by single copy gene-based real-time pcr.
AB  == periodontitis is a common chronic multibacterial infection in the tooth-supporting tissues. it has been shown that periodontitis patients carry higher number of disease-associated bacteria than healthy ones. the aim of this study was to generate a novel, single copy gene-based quantitative real-time pcr  (qpcr) assay for five major periodontal pathogens - aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia. the primer/probe sets were designed for conservative lipopolysaccharide-coding gene regions. they proved to be sensitive  and able to detect strains representing different serotypes of the target bacteria. the specificity of designed primers was tested using 49 selected bacterial species and no false positive or negative results were observed. we validated the assay with a case-control population, including 165 saliva samples, and proved the diagnostic accuracy by receiver operating characteristic (roc) curves. all quantified pathogens alone were able to distinguish significantly between the subjects with and without periodontitis, and provided areas under the roc curve larger than 0.5. the total pathogen burden comprising all five species  associated with periodontitis with an area of 0.821 (95% ci, 0.758-0.885, p50.001). our prominently sensitive and specific assay may have major importance  in the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of periodontitis.

TI  == clinical effectiveness of photodynamic therapy in the treatment of periodontitis.
AB  == aim: a randomized-controlled clinical pilot trial was designed to evaluate photodynamic therapy (pdt) for its bactericidal potential and clinical effect in  the treatment of periodontitis. material and methods: fifty-eight subjects with chronic periodontitis were included. each subject exhibited at least three active periodontal pockets 5mm or deeper, bleeding on probing and the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis. subjects were randomly assigned to a control group treated by subgingival ultrasound only or to a study group additionally treated by pdt. baseline clinical values of gingival index, bleeding on probing, probing  pocket depths and clinical attachment levels were recorded and re-evaluated 90 days later. pathogen screening for p. gingivalis, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola was conducted at baseline as well as 10, 42 and 90 days after treatment. results: p. gingivalis was significantly reduced in both groups (laser group: p=0.020; control group: p=0.042). no significant reductions of t. forsythia and t. denticola were observed in either group. for the microbial parameters, no significant difference was found between the laser and the control group. all clinical parameters were significantly reduced in both groups after treatment. the mean probing pocket depths decreased from 5.79 to 4.55mm in the laser group and from 5.54 to 4.51 in the control group. the intergroup difference was not significant (p=0.82). bleeding on probing was reduced from 100% evaluated at baseline to 47% in the laser group and 59% in the control group. the intergroup difference was not significant (p=0.28). no significant differences were observed in any other parameters. conclusion: application of a single cycle  of pdt was not effective as an adjunct to ultrasonic periodontal treatment. there were no extra reductions in pocket depths and bleeding on probing. with regard to eradicating bacteria, however, there are no additional effects as compared with conventional treatment alone.

TI  == major proteins and antigens of treponema denticola.
AB  == treponema denticola is a gram-negative, motile, asaccharolytic, anaerobic spirochaete which along with porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythia has been shown to form a bacterial consortium called the red complex that is strongly associated with the clinical progression of chronic periodontitis. t. denticola was grown in continuous culture in a complex medium with a mean generation time of 15.75 h. samples from two different membrane-enriched preparations and a cytoplasm-enriched preparation were separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and the proteins identified by maldi-tof/tof  mass spectrometry. in total, 219 non-redundant proteins were identified including numerous virulence factors, lipoproteins, abc transporter proteins and enzymes involved in the metabolism of nine different amino acids of which glycine seems to be of particular importance. novel findings include the identification of several abundant peptide uptake systems, and the identification of three flagellar filament outer layer proteins. two-dimensional western blot analysis using sera from mice immunized with formalin-killed t. denticola cells suggested  that msp, prca, oppa, oppa10, mglb, tmpc and several flagellar filament proteins  are antigenic.

TI  == systemic immune responses in pregnancy and periodontitis: relationship to pregnancy outcomes in the obstetrics and periodontal therapy (opt) study.
AB  == background: our previous studies reported on the obstetric, periodontal, and microbiologic outcomes of women participating in the obstetrics and periodontal therapy (opt) study. this article describes the systemic antibody responses to selected periodontal bacteria in the same patients. methods: serum samples, obtained from pregnant women at baseline (13 to 16 weeks; 6 days of gestation) and 29 to 32 weeks, were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for serum  immunoglobulin g (igg) antibody to aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), and treponema denticola. results: at baseline, women who delivered live preterm infants had significantly  lower total serum levels of igg antibody to the panel of periodontal pathogens (p = 0.0018), to p. gingivalis (p = 0.0013), and to f. nucleatum (p = 0.0200) than women who delivered at term. these differences were not significant at 29 to 32 weeks. changes in igg levels between baseline and 29 to 32 weeks were not associated with preterm birth when adjusted for treatment group, clinical center, race, or age. in addition, delivery of low birth weight infants was not associated with levels of antibody at baseline or with antibody changes during pregnancy. conclusions: live preterm birth is associated with decreased levels of igg antibody to periodontal pathogens in women with periodontitis when assessed during the second trimester. changes in igg antibody during pregnancy are not associated with birth outcomes.

TI  == the use of perioscan as a potential screening test for mothers at risk for delivery of pre-term and low birth-weight infants.
AB  == increased levels of oestrogen and progesterone during pregnancy may lead to periodontal disease. the anaerobic gram-negative bacteria classified as the "red  complex" (porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola) are frequently associated with periodontal disease. periodontopathogens produce toxins and enzymes that can enter the bloodstream and cross the placenta to harm  the foetus. the response of the mother's immune system to infection by these periodontopathogens brings about the release of inflammatory mediators which may  trigger preterm labour or result in low birth-weight infants. the purpose of this study was to examine the use of perioscan as a potential screening test for mothers at risk for pre-term delivery of low birth weight infants due to periodontal disease. subgingival plaque samples were obtained from pregnant women between the ages of 17 to 45 years attending an ante-natal clinic in the western  cape in south africa. plaque samples were analyzed by the enzymatic perioscan test for detection of the red complex in 372 sites from 66 women. results were confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) detection of the three species of the red complex. seventeen (25.75%) of the population group tested positive with  perioscan but only 27 (7.25%) of the 372 sites were positive. of the 66 mothers examined, we managed to retrieve 29 records post-delivery. in all the mothers examined, perioscan results showed an association with the indices used to diagnose periodontal disease, and could also be associated with preterm delivery  of low birth-weight infants in two of the 29 maternal records recovered.

TI  == the microbiota on different oral surfaces in healthy children.
AB  == introduction: knowledge of the early oral colonization patterns could provide a better understanding of oral biofilm development and disease initiation that in turn could be the basis for early preventive programmes. methods: microbial samples were collected from five different oral habitats from a total of 93 children (age 3-12 years), attending the dental school of the university of athens, who were split into three age groups. a total of 38 microbial species were sought out by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique. results: all of the test species, except parvimonas micra and porphyromonas gingivalis, differed significantly among sample locations providing quite distinct microbial  profiles for the different oral surfaces. supragingival and subgingival plaque had similar profiles and exhibited higher proportions of actinomyces species and  green complex while soft tissue samples were dominated by streptococci of the yellow complex. the profiles of the tongue dorsum and saliva were also similar. many of the species were in similar proportions in all three age groups for a given location. periodontal pathogens showed increases in proportions with increasing age. specifically, the red complex species (tannerella forsythia, p. gingivalis, treponema denticola) showed a significant increase in proportion with age (p < 0.05) in all sample locations. conclusions: the results showed a pattern of colonization in children similar to that previously found in adults. differences in the profile between age groups suggest a gradual maturation of the oral microbiota, with it being made up of an increasing number of orange and red  complex species.

TI  == are putative periodontal pathogens reliable diagnostic markers?
AB  == periodontitis is one of the most common chronic inflammatory diseases. a number of putative bacterial pathogens have been associated with the disease and are used as diagnostic markers. in the present study, we compared the prevalence of oral bacterial species in the subgingival biofilm of generalized aggressive periodontitis (gap) (n = 44) and chronic periodontitis (cp) (n = 46) patients with that of a periodontitis-resistant control group (pr) (n = 21). the control group consisted of subjects at least 65 years of age with only minimal or no periodontitis and no history of periodontal treatment. a total of 555 samples from 111 subjects were included in this study. the samples were analyzed by pcr of 16s rrna gene fragments and subsequent dot blot hybridization using oligonucleotide probes specific for aggregatibacter (actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, a treponema denticola-like phylogroup (treponema phylogroup ii), treponema lecithinolyticum, campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium spp., and fusobacterium nucleatum, as well as capnocytophaga ochracea. our data confirm a high prevalence of the putative periodontal pathogens p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, and t. forsythia in the periodontitis groups. however, these species  were also frequently detected in the pr group. for most of the species tested, the prevalence was more associated with increased probing depth than with the subject group. t. lecithinolyticum was the only periodontopathogenic species showing significant differences both between gap and cp patients and between gap  patients and pr subjects. c. ochracea was associated with the pr subjects, regardless of the probing depth. these results indicate that t. lecithinolyticum  may be a diagnostic marker for gap and c. ochracea for periodontal health. they also suggest that current presumptions of the association of specific bacteria with periodontal health and disease require further evaluation.

AB  == periodontal disease is a multiple factor disease caused by genetic factors, environmental factors, and periodontal bacteria (periodontal pathogens). the present study aimed to elucidate the risk factors for periodontal disease in japanese adolescents. subjects (11-16 years old) were classified into three groups: localized aggressive periodontitis (lap), periodontal attachment loss (pal), and periodontally healthy (ph) groups. genomic dna isolated from the buccal mucosa was used for single-nucleotide polymorphism analyses of the candidate genes (interleukin-1alpha-889; interleukin-1alpha +4845; interleukin-1beta +3954; an immunoglobulin g fc gamma receptor, fcgammariia-r/h131; and a human leukocyte antigen class ii allele, hla-dqb1) of aggressive periodontitis. subgingival plaque samples obtained from the same subjects were used for 16s rrnabased polymerase chain reaction analysis of five important periodontal pathogens (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia). tannerella forsythia was detected in the deepest periodontal pockets in all subjects in the lap and pal groups. the prevalence of  an atypical bamhi restriction site in hla-dqb1 of the lap group was significantly higher than that in the ph and pal groups. furthermore, all subjects who had the  atypical bamhi restriction site in hla-dqb1 had t. forsythia infection. these results suggested that t. forsythia is associated with periodontal disease in japanese adolescents and also suggested that hla-dqb1 is related to lap and is associated with t. forsythia infection.

TI  == salivary detection of periodontopathic bacteria and periodontal health status in  dental students.
AB  == objective: saliva may become a potential source of contamination through vertical and horizontal transmissions as well as cross-infections. this study aims to use  saliva as a screening tool to detect putative periodontal pathogens in a young population with fairly good oral hygiene. materials and methods: stimulated saliva samples were obtained from 134 dental students (20.5+/-1 years, range 18-22 years). among those, 77 subjects also completed a periodontal examination including attachment loss, modified dental, gingival and plaque indices (al, mdi, gi and pi). the test bacteria were identified using a 16s rrna-based pcr detection method. results: one or more of the test bacteria was found in 67% of the subjects. prevotella nigrescens was detected as single bacterium in 16% of the subjects followed by treponema denticola (4%), porphyromonas gingivalis (2%), aggregatibacter (formerly actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans (1%) and tannerella forsythia (1%). two or more pathogens were detected in 42% of the subjects. clinical examination revealed health with no attachment loss (al) in 84% of the students. in no al group, 38% of the students were pathogen free while this was 25% for students in localized al group (p>0.05). there was a statistically significant association between the detection of salivary periodontal pathogen in general and higher pi (p=0.018) and gi (p=0.043). conclusion: within the limits of this study, it is possible to detect all six periodontal pathogens in the saliva of dental students. although a correlation can be observed between the presence of salivary periodontal pathogen and clinical signs of inflammation such as plaque accumulation and gingival bleeding, detection of specific bacteria in saliva is not related to the presence of localized al based on the presented study population.

TI  == porphyromonas gingivalis with either tannerella forsythia or treponema denticola  induces synergistic il-6 production by murine macrophage-like j774.1 cells.
AB  == background: chronic periodontitis is caused by mixed bacterial infection. porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola are frequently detected in deep periodontal pockets. we demonstrate that these bacteria induce proinflammatory cytokine production by the mouse macrophage-like  cell line j774.1. materials and methods: j774.1 cells were incubated with and without bacteria for 24h in 96-well flat-bottomed plates. the culture supernatants were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for secreted mouse interleukin (il)-6, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, il-23, il-1 beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. the cytokine concentrations were determined using a standard curve prepared for each assay. results: mixed infection with p.  gingivalis and either t. forsythia or t. denticola at 10(5)cfu/ml acted synergistically to increase il-6 production, but not monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, il-23, il-1 beta or tumor necrosis factor-alpha production. gingipain  inhibitors kyt-1 and kyt-36 inhibited il-6 production by j774.1 cells incubated with 10(5)cfu/ml of mixed bacteria. conclusion: these results suggest that p. gingivalis with either t. forsythia or t. denticola directly induces synergistic  il-6 protein production and that gingipains play a role in this synergistic effect.

TI  == periodontal pathogen levels in adolescents before, during, and after fixed orthodontic appliance therapy.
AB  == introduction: this purpose of this study was to document and investigate changes  in periodontal pathogen levels before, during, and after orthodontic treatment in adolescents. methods: dna gene probe analysis was used to quantify the levels of  8 periodontal pathogens before, during, and after treatment with fixed orthodontic appliances in 190 concurrently treated adolescent orthodontic patients. the 8 pathogens examined were actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), prevotella intermedia (pi), tannerella forsythia (tf), eikenella corrodens (ec), fusobacterium nucleatum (fn), treponema denticola (td), and campylobacter rectus (cr). chi-square tests were used to determine whether the percentages of subjects with high counts significantly changed over time. logistic regression analyses were also performed to derive the relative risk of higher counts of pathogenic bacteria with fixed appliances at the various time intervals studied. results: for 6 (pi, tf, ec, fn, td, cr) of the 8 pathogens, the percentages of subjects with high pathogen counts increased  significantly after 6 months of fixed appliance treatment, but these returned to  pretreatment levels by 12 months of orthodontic treatment. no pathogen level was  significantly higher after 12 months of orthodontic treatment, and orthodontic treatment was found to be significantly protective for half of the pathogens (ec, fn, td, cr) posttreatment. conclusions: orthodontic treatment with fixed appliances does not increase the risk of high levels of these periodontal pathogens.

TI  == bacterial diversity in persistent periapical lesions on root-filled teeth.
AB  == background: the purpose of this study was to analyze the bacterial diversity in persistent apical lesions on root-filled teeth by using culture-independent molecular methods. design: twenty surgically removed apical lesions from therapy-resistant teeth were examined for the presence of bacterial dna using pcr targeting the 16s ribosomal rna gene, followed by cloning and sequencing. results: bacterial dna was detected in 17 of the 20 samples (85%). a total of 236 clones were analyzed. seven different bacterial phyla were represented and a total of 75 different bacterial taxa were identified; 36% of the species have not yet been cultivated. commonly detected bacterial species included fusobacterium spp., prevotella spp., tannerella forsythia, porphyromonas endodontalis, treponema denticola, bacteroidetes spp., peptostreptococcus spp., and streptococcus spp. conclusions: a wide range of bacteria was identified in periapical lesions on therapy-resistant teeth. these bacteria may contribute in the etiology of periapical infection and impede healing of these lesions.

TI  == tumor necrosis factor-alpha -308g/a single nucleotide polymorphism and red-complex periodontopathogens are independently associated with increased levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha in diseased periodontal tissues.
AB  == background and objective: inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha are involved in the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases. a high between-subject variation in the level of tumor necrosis factor-alpha mrna has been verified, which may be a result of genetic polymorphisms and/or the presence of periodontopathogens such as porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola (called the red complex) and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. in this study, we investigated the effect of the tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnfa) -308g/a gene polymorphism and of periodontopathogens on the tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels in the periodontal tissues of nonsmoking patients with chronic periodontitis (n = 127) and in control subjects  (n = 177). material and methods: the tnfa -308g/a single nucleotide polymorphism  was investigated using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis, whereas the tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels and the periodontopathogen load were determined using real-time polymerase chain reaction. results: no statistically significant differences were found in the frequency of the tnfa -308 single nucleotide polymorphism in control and chronic  periodontitis groups, in spite of the higher frequency of the a allele in the chronic periodontitis group. the concomitant analyses of genotypes and periodontopathogens demonstrated that tnfa -308 ga/aa genotypes and the red-complex periodontopathogens were independently associated with increased levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha in periodontal tissues, and no additive effect was seen when both factors were present. p. gingivalis, t. forsythia and t. denticola counts were positively correlated with the level of tumor necrosis factor-alpha. tnfa -308 genotypes were not associated with the periodontopathogen detection odds or with the bacterial load. conclusion: our results demonstrate that the tnfa -308 a allele and red-complex periodontopathogens are independently associated with increased levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha in diseased tissues of nonsmoking chronic periodontitis patients and consequently are potentially involved in determining the disease outcome.

TI  == [identification of periodontopathogen microorganisms by pcr technique].
AB  == introduction: periodontitis is an inflammatory disease of the supporting tissues  of teeth and is a major cause of tooth loss in adults. the onset and progression  of periodontal disease is attributed to the presence of elevated levels of a consortium of pathogenic bacteria. gram negative bacteria, mainly strict anaerobes, play the major role. objective: the present study aimed to assess the  presence of the main types of microorganisms involved in the aetiopathogenesis of periodontal disease: porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, eikenella corrodens, treponema denticola, tanerella forsythia and prevotella intermedia in different samples collected from the oral  cavity of 90 patients diagnosed with periodontitis. method: bacterial dna detection was performed in diverse biological materials, namely in dental plaque, gingival tissue and saliva, by means of multiplex pcr, a technique that allows simultaneous identification of two different bacterial genomes. results: in the dental plaque of the periodontitis patients, treponema denticola dominated. in the gingival tissue, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola were the microbiota most frequently detected, whilst in saliva treponema denticola and eikenella corrodens were found with the highest percentage. conclusion: the identification of microorganisms by multiplex pcr is specific and sensitive. rapid and precise assessment of different types of periodontopathogens is extremely important for early detection of the infection and consequently for the prevention and treatment of periodontal disease. in everyday clinical practice, for routine bacterial evaluation in patients with periodontal disease, the dental plaque is the most suitable biological material, because it is the richest in periodontal bacteria.

TI  == differences in subgingival microflora of korean and german periodontal patients.
AB  == purpose: the goal of this study was to characterize the microbiological profile in samples of subgingival plaque taken from periodontal patients with different ethnic origin. methods: 178 patients (n=90 from south korea and n=88 from germany; age: 45.4 +/- 10.4 years) were diagnosed with severe generalized periodontitis. in all patients the deepest pocket of each quadrant was sampled for subgingival plaque. the four samples per patient were pooled and subsequently analysed with a 16s-rna-gene probe test. results: prevalence of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans was significantly higher in german patients (47.7%) compared to korean patients (26.7%) (p < 0.01, chi(2)-test). for tannerella forsythia and porphyromonas gingivalis, differences between germans and koreans were not as pronounced. a statistically significant difference could also be found for treponema denticola (germans: 95.5%, koreans: 81.1%, p < 0.01, chi(2)-test). after logarithmic transformation, bacterial counts differed for all microorganisms under investigation between germans and koreans, even after using  a general linear model/analysis of covariance (glm/ancova) to adjust for gender,  age, smoking status, pocket probing depths (ppd) of sampled teeth, and gingival bleeding index (gbi). conclusion: depending on their ethnic origin, the microbiological profile of pooled subgingival plaque sample seems to differ significantly between patients of caucasian and asian ethnic origin.

TI  == persistence of extracrevicular bacterial reservoirs after treatment of aggressive periodontitis.
AB  == background: the purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that periodontal pathogens associated with aggressive periodontitis persist in extracrevicular locations following scaling and root planing, systemic antibiotics, and antimicrobial rinses. methods: eighteen patients with aggressive periodontitis received a clinical examination during which samples of subgingival plaque and buccal epithelial cells were obtained. treatment consisted of full-mouth root planing, systemic antibiotics, and chlorhexidine rinses. clinical measurements and sampling were repeated at 3 and 6 months. quantitative polymerase chain reaction determined the number of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), and  treponema denticola in the plaque. fluorescence in situ hybridization and confocal microscopy determined the extent of intracellular invasion in epithelial cells. results: clinical measurements improved significantly following treatment. all bacterial species except p. gingivalis were significantly reduced in plaque between baseline and 3 months. however, all species showed a trend to repopulate  between 3 and 6 months. this increase was statistically significant for log t. denticola counts. all species were detected intracellularly. the percentage of cells infected intracellularly was not affected by therapy. conclusions: the 6-month increasing trend in the levels of plaque bacteria suggests that subgingival recolonization was occurring. because the presence of these species within epithelial cells was not altered after treatment, it is plausible that recolonization may occur from the oral mucosa. systemic antibiotics and topical chlorhexidine did not reduce the percentage of invaded epithelial cells. these data support the hypothesis that extracrevicular reservoirs of bacteria exist, which might contribute to recurrent or refractory disease in some patients.

TI  == [relationship of putative periodontopathogenic bacteria and drug-induced gingival overgrowth].
AB  == objective: to investigate the effect of putative periodontopathogenic bacteria on the development of drug-induced gingival overgrowth (go) in renal transplant recipients. methods: a total of 57 patients undergoing cyclosporine treatment were divided into two groups according to go index: with gingival overgrowth (group a) and without gingival overgrowth (group b). demographic, pharmacologic and periodontal data were analyzed. the real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) method was used to detect and quantify five putative periodontopathogenic bacteria, including porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), prevotella intermedia (pi), treponema denticola (td)  and tannerella forsythia (tf) in subgingival samples. moreover, the relationship  between the bacterial amount and the severity of go was analyzed. results: group  a presented a significantly higher plaque index, sulcus bleeding index and probing depth than group b (p < 0.01). the occurrences of pg, td, and tf in the group a (96%, 82% and 89%) were significantly increased compared with those in the group b (69%, 55% and 66%, p < 0. 05), respectively. the prevalence of pg, td, and tf in the group a (79%) was markedly higher than that in the group b (38%, p < 0.01). the bacterial amount of pg, td, tf and pi were enhanced along with the severity of go. however, the bacterial amount of aa had no difference between two groups. conclusions: pg, td, and tf may have a significant relationship with the development of go.

TI  == free soluble receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappab ligand in gingival crevicular fluid correlates with distinct pathogens in periodontitis patients.
AB  == aim: the aim of the experiment was to investigate the levels of free soluble receptor activator of nuclear factor-kb ligand (srankl) in periodontal health and disease and their correlations to clinical parameters and important periodontal pathogens. material and methods: chronic periodontitis (n=35) and periodontally healthy (n=38) subjects participated in the present study. pocket depth, recession and bleeding index were recorded at a total of 221 sites. subgingival plaque samples from these sites were analysed for the levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola. gingival crevicular fluid samples were analysed with elisa for levels of free srankl. comparisons between groups were performed by applying  non-parametric tests (mann-whitney) and correlations among parameters were sought for with spearman's r coefficient. results: mean levels of free srankl were higher in periodontitis subjects and correlated significantly with mean counts of t. denticola on the subject level and p. gingivalis, t. denticola on the site level (spearman's r coefficient, p<0.05), but not with clinical parameters. no correlations were found between the levels of free srankl and investigated parameters in periodontally healthy individuals. no effect of smoking was found on investigated parameters and correlations (univariate analysis of variance and  pairwise comparisons). conclusions: findings from the present study suggest a correlation of levels of srankl with important pathogens in periodontitis patients.

TI  == periodontal bacterial profiles in pregnant women: response to treatment and associations with birth outcomes in the obstetrics and periodontal therapy (opt)  study.
AB  == background: a recent clinical trial (obstetrics and periodontal therapy [opt] study) demonstrated that periodontal therapy during pregnancy improved periodontal outcomes but failed to impact preterm birth. the present study evaluated seven target bacteria, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), prevotella intermedia, campylobacter rectus, and fusobacterium nucleatum, in subgingival dental plaque of pregnant women in the opt study and their association with birth outcomes. methods: pregnant women were randomly assigned to receive periodontal treatment before 21 weeks' gestation or after delivery. subgingival plaque was sampled at baseline (13 to 16 weeks; 6 days of gestation)  and at 29 to 32 weeks. we analyzed subgingival plaque samples from women who experienced fetal loss, delivered a live preterm infant (preterm women), or delivered a full-term infant (full-term women). samples were analyzed using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. associations between preterm birth and bacterial counts and percentages were tested using multiple linear regression. results: no significant differences were observed at baseline between preterm and full-term women for any measured bacterial species or group of species, after accounting for multiple comparisons. changes in bacterial counts and proportions  during pregnancy also were not associated with birth outcomes. in full-term and preterm women, periodontal therapy significantly reduced (p <0.01) counts of all  target species except for a. actinomycetemcomitans. conclusions: in pregnant women with periodontitis, non-surgical periodontal therapy significantly reduced  levels of periodontal pathogens. baseline levels of selected periodontal pathogens or changes in these bacteria resulting from therapy were not associated with preterm birth.

TI  == photodynamic therapy as an adjunct to non-surgical periodontal treatment: a randomized, controlled clinical trial.
AB  == background: recent preclinical and clinical data have suggested a potential benefit of photodynamic therapy (pdt) in the treatment of periodontitis. however, there are very limited data from controlled clinical trials evaluating the effect of pdt in the treatment of periodontitis. the aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical and microbiologic effects of the adjunctive use of pdt to non-surgical periodontal treatment. methods: twenty-four subjects with chronic periodontitis were randomly treated with scaling and root planing followed by a single episode of pdt (test) or scaling and root planing alone (control). full-mouth plaque score (fmps), full-mouth bleeding score (fmbs), probing depth (pd), gingival recession, and clinical attachment level (cal) were measured at baseline and 3 and 6 months after therapy. primary outcome variables were changes in pd and cal. microbiologic evaluation of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans  (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), treponema denticola, parvimonas micra (previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros), fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, eubacterium nodatum, eikenella corrodens, and capnocytophaga spp. was performed at baseline and 3 and 6 months following therapy by using a commercially available polymerase chain reaction test. results: at 3 and 6 months after treatment, there were no statistically significant differences between the groups with regard to cal, pd,  fmps, or microbiologic changes. at 3 and 6 months, a statistically significantly  greater improvement in fmbs was found in the test group. conclusion: the additional application of a single episode of pdt to scaling and root planing failed to result in an additional improvement in terms of pd reduction and cal gain, but it resulted in a significantly higher reduction in bleeding scores compared to scaling and root planing alone.

AB  == aim: the aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical and microbiological effects of scaling and root planing (srp) alone or combined with metronidazole (mtz) or with mtz and amoxicillin (amx) in the treatment of smokers with chronic  periodontitis. methods: a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial was conducted in 43 subjects who received srp alone (n=15) or combined with mtz (400 mg 3 x per day, n=14) or with mtz+amx (500 mg 3 x per day, n=14) for 14  days. clinical and microbiological examinations were performed at baseline and 3  months post-therapy. subgingival samples were analysed by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. results: subjects receiving mtz+amx showed the greatest improvements in mean probing depth and clinical attachment level. both antibiotic therapies led to additional clinical benefits over srp alone in initially shallow, intermediate, and deep sites. the srp+mtz+amx therapy led to the most beneficial changes in the subgingival microbial profile. these subjects showed significant reductions in the mean counts and proportions of periodontal pathogens such as tannerella forsythia, porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola, and the greatest increase in proportions of host-compatible species. conclusion: significant advantages are observed when systemic antibiotics are combined with srp in the treatment of smokers with chronic periodontitis. the greatest benefits in clinical and microbiological parameters are achieved with the use of srp+mtz+amx.

TI  == analysis of neutrophil-derived antimicrobial peptides in gingival crevicular fluid suggests importance of cathelicidin ll-37 in the innate immune response against periodontogenic bacteria.
AB  == introduction: during periodontitis, an innate immune response to bacterial challenge is primarily mediated by neutrophils. we compared neutrophilic content  and the level of neutrophil-derived antimicrobial peptides in gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) in two clinical forms of severe periodontitis. methods: gcf was collected from 14 patients with aggressive periodontitis, 17 patients with chronic periodontitis, and nine healthy subjects. samples were analyzed for periodontopathogen load using real-time polymerase chain reactions. the amounts of myeloperoxidase and alpha-defensins (hnp1-3) were determined by enzyme-linked  immunosorbent assay, and the level of cathelicidin (hcap18/ll-37) was assayed by  western blot. results: myeloperoxidase concentration was not correlated with levels of ll-37 and hnp1-3 in samples from patients, compared to controls. the amount of hnp1-3 was twofold and fourfold higher in patients with aggressive and  chronic periodontitis, respectively. those with chronic disease had significantly elevated amounts of mature ll-37. the increased concentration of both peptides in chronic periodontitis correlated with the load of porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola. conclusion: the lack of a correlation between ll-37, hnp1-3, and myeloperoxidase content suggests that neutrophils are not the sole source of these bactericidal peptides in the gcf of  patients with periodontitis; and that other cells contribute to their local production. the bacterial proteases of p. gingivalis, t. forsythia, and t. denticola might degrade hcap18/ll-37, because the 11-kda cathelicidin-derived fragment was present in gcf collected from pockets infected with these bacteria.  collectively, it appears that a local deficiency in ll-37 can be considered as a  supporting factor in the pathogenesis of severe cases of periodontitis.

TI  == rapid and simple detection of eight major periodontal pathogens by the loop-mediated isothermal amplification method.
AB  == loop-mediated isothermal amplification (lamp) was applied to develop a rapid and  simple detection system for eight periodontal pathogens: aggregatibacter (actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola and tannerella forsythia. primers were designed from the 16s ribosomal rna gene for each pathogen, and the lamp amplified the targets specifically and efficiently under isothermal condition at 64 degrees c.  to simplify the manipulation of lamp examination, boiled cells and intact cells suspended in phosphate-buffered saline (pbs) were tested as templates besides extracted dna template. the detection limits were 1-10 cells per tube using extracted dna template. however, lamp methods using boiled cells and intact cells required 10-100 and 100-1000 cells per tube, respectively. lamps for a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis and p. intermedia were then applied to clinical plaque samples, and the method demonstrated equal or higher sensitivity  compared with the conventional real-time pcr method. these findings suggest the usefulness of the lamp method for the rapid and simple microbiological diagnosis  of periodontitis, and the possibility of lamp examination without the dna extraction step.

AB  == inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1beta (il-1beta) are involved in the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases. a high individual variation in the levels of il-1beta mrna has been verified, which is possibly determined by genetic polymorphisms and/or by the presence of periodontopathogens such as porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. in this study, we investigated the role of an il-1beta promoter single-nucleotide polymorphism at position 3954 [il-1beta(3954) snp] and the presence of the periodontopathogens in the determination of the il-1beta levels in the periodontal tissues of nonsmoking chronic periodontitis (cp) patients (n = 117) and control (c) subjects (n = 175) and the possible correlations with the clinical parameters of the disease. il-1beta(3954) snp was  investigated by restriction fragment length polymorphism, while the il-1beta levels and the presence of the periodontopathogens were determined by real-time pcr. similar frequencies of il-1beta(3954) snp were found in the c and cp groups, in spite of a trend toward a higher incidence of t alleles in the cp group. the il-1beta(3954) snp ct and tt genotypes, as well as p. gingivalis, t. forsythia, and t. denticola, were associated with higher il-1beta levels and with higher values of the clinical parameters of disease severity. concomitant analyses demonstrate that il-1beta(3954) and the red complex periodontopathogens were found to independently and additively modulate the levels of il-1beta in periodontal tissues. similarly, the concurrent presence of both factors was associated with increased scores of disease severity. il-1beta(3954) genotypes and red complex periodontopathogens, individually and additively, modulate the levels of il-1beta in the diseased tissues of nonsmoking cp patients and, consequently, are potentially involved in the determination of the disease outcome.

TI  == comparative analysis of putative periodontopathic bacteria by multiplex polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == background and objective: the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) has been applied for the rapid and specific detection of periodontopathic bacteria in subgingival  plaque and is potentially of clinical benefit in the diagnosis and treatment of periodontitis subjects. however, several technical points need to be modified before the conventional pcr detection system can be used by clinicians. material  and methods: to develop a pcr-based technique more applicable for clinical use than conventional pcr, we established a multiplex pcr for five putative periodontopathic (treponema denticola, porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter  actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia and tannerella forsythia) and two nonperiodontopathic (streptococcus sanguinis and streptococcus salivarius) species of bacteria using whole-plaque suspension as templates, and detected bacteria in subgingival plaque taken from 85 subjects at the supportive periodontal therapy stage after active periodontal treatments. results: among putative periodontopathic bacteria, the detection frequency of t. denticola and p. gingivalis was elevated in parallel with higher probing pocket depth and clinical attachment loss, and had 4.2-14.1 times increasing odds of the clinical  parameters tested. detection of any of the five species of putative periodontopathic bacteria markedly increased the odds ratio of a higher probing pocket depth, clinical attachment loss and bleeding on probing. conclusion: the multiplex pcr system developed in this study enabled the detection of all the bacteria under investigation in one reaction tube in a less time- and labor-intensive manner than conventional pcr. these results support the potential clinical use of multiplex pcr for detecting periodontopathic bacteria and for evaluating therapeutic strategies and predicting the prognosis for each subject.

TI  == microbial analysis of canals of root-filled teeth with periapical lesions using polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == the objective of the present study was to investigate the presence of nine bacterial species in root-filled teeth associated with periapical lesions using a polymerase chain reaction analysis and to correlate these species with clinical features of the cases. dna was extracted from 45 canal samples of root-filled teeth with periapical lesions. a pcr assay using species-specific primers of 16s  rdna and the downstream intergenic spacer region was used for microbial detection. enterococcus faecalis was the most prevalent species, detected in 77.8% of the study teeth, followed by peptostreptococcus micros, detected in 51.1%. porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, prevotella intermedia, and prevotella nigrescens were detected in 35.6%, 22.2%, 11.1%, and 11.1% of the sampled teeth, respectively. moreover, pcr detected filifactor alocis in 26.7%, treponema denticola in 24.4%, and tannerella forsythia in 4.4% of the samples. t. denticola and p. micros were statistically associated with tenderness to percussion (p < 0.05). p. nigrescens was associated with the presence of spontaneous pain and abscess (p < 0.05). p. endodontalis and p. nigrescens were associated with purulent exudates (p < 0.05). synergistic relationship was also observed between some species. the results of this study indicated that e. faecalis was the most frequently identified test species by pcr in teeth with failing endodontic treatment.

TI  == antibody levels to single bacteria or in combination evaluated against myocardial infarction.
AB  == background: evidence is accumulating that oral bacteria are associated with myocardial infarctions (mi). we were interested in studying the differences in the association between single bacteria or bacteria in combination and the relation to c-reactive protein (crp). material and methods: we examined the levels of antibodies against four major periodontal pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (aa), tannerella forsythia (tf) and treponema denticola (td) and crp in 548 men with a self-reported history of mi to 625 controls who took part in the oslo ii study in 2000. results: the mean levels of bacterial antibodies were higher for the cases than the controls,  but not significant as standard deviations were large. the level of crp was higher in the cases than the controls (p=0.010). logistic regression analyses comparing the upper quartile value with the lower value of one of either four antibodies (anti-aa, anti-tf, anti-td and anti-pg) were significantly associated  (p=0.032) with mi. equivalent analyses of either three bacteria showed significant associations for anti-aa, anti-td and anti-pg (p=0.036) and anti-aa,  anti-pg and anti-tf (p=0.040). crp showed an increased relative risk with increasing quartile value; trend, p=0.016, but not in multivariate analysis including the oral antigens. conclusions: no single bacterium but rather combinations were related to increasing relative risk for mi independent of known cardiovascular risk factors.

TI  == bleeding on probing differentially relates to bacterial profiles: the oral infections and vascular disease epidemiology study.
AB  == aim: various bacterial species are differentially prevalent in periodontal health, gingivitis or periodontitis. we tested the independent associations between three bacterial groupings and gingival inflammation in an epidemiological study. material and methods: in 706 oral infections and vascular disease epidemiology study (invest) participants > or =55 years, bleeding on probing (bop), pocket depth (pd) and subgingival plaque samples (n=4866) were assessed in eight sites per mouth. eleven bacterial species were quantitatively assayed and grouped as follows: (i) aetiologic burden (eb, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, tannerella  forsythia); (ii) putative burden (pb, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens,  fusobacterium nucleatum, micromonas micros, prevotella intermedia); (iii) health-associated burden (hab, actinomyces naeslundii, veillonella parvula). results: after mutual adjustment for eb, pb and hab, the bop prevalence increased by 45% ( p<0.0001) across increasing quartiles of eb while bop decreased by 13% ( p<0.0001) across increasing quartiles of hab. mean pd increased 0.8 mm and decreased 0.3 mm from the first to fourth quartiles of eb (p<0.0001) and hab ( p<0.0001), respectively. among 1214 plaque samples with fourth quartile eb, 60% were collected from sites with pd < or =3 mm. conclusion: bacterial species believed to be aetiologically related to periodontitis were associated with bop in sites with minimal pd and/or attachment level (al). species presumed to be associated with periodontal health demonstrated inverse associations with bop.

TI  == occurrence of herpes simplex virus 1 and three periodontal bacteria in patients with chronic periodontitis and necrotic pulp.
AB  == viral and bacterial associations appear to be implicated in the development of periodontal infections. little information is available describing the periodontopathic agents in root canals with necrotic pulp. in this study, the occurrence and the combinations among herpes simplex virus type 1 (hsv-1) and dialister pneumosintes, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola in patients with chronic periodontitis and necrotic pulp were evaluated. clinical samples from healthy subjects and patients with periodontal or pulp infections were analyzed using a nested polymerase chain reaction pcr to detect hsv and pcr to detect the 3 periodontal bacteria. the presence of tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola was observed in healthy, periodontitis, and necrotic pulp patients. hsv was observed in periodontitis and necrotic pulp patients, and no healthy subject harbored d. pneumosintes or hsv. the occurrence of tannerella forsythia was not statistically significant in patients with necrotic pulp (p = 0.704). periodontal bacteria were observed varying from 10.3% to 20.7% in periodontitis and necrotic pulp patients. the presence of treponema denticola - hsv association was predominant in patients showing necrotic pulp (24.1%); however, hsv alone was observed in one patient with periodontitis and in another  patient with necrotic pulp. the presence of double association among bacteria or  bacteria - hsv could indicate a role in both periodontitis and necrotic pulp, and tannerella forsythia - treponema denticola - hsv and tannerella forsythia - d. pneumosintes - treponema denticola - hsv associations might be important in periodontitis.

TI  == site-specific development of periodontal disease is associated with increased levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia in subgingival plaque.
AB  == background: porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), which are regarded as the principal periodontopathogenic bacteria, exist as a consortium in subgingival biofilms. we  aimed to examine quantitative relationships between p. gingivalis, t. denticola,  and t. forsythia in subgingival biofilms and the relationship between the quantity and prevalence of these three bacteria and site-specific periodontal health. methods: this study was cross-sectional. the study population consisted of 35 adult subjects who visited the kyushu dental college hospital. plaque samples were collected from 105 periodontal pocket sites. quantitative analyses of each of the three periodontopathogenic bacteria were performed using real-time polymerase chain reaction with species-specific primers and hybridization probes. results: the plaque samples were divided into four groups based on the presence or absence of a periodontal pocket (probing depth [pd] > or =4 mm) and bleeding on probing (bop), regardless of attachment loss. the proportions of all three target bacteria detected in samples from sites of periodontal disease (with pd and bop) were markedly higher than those in the other sample groups. cell numbers of p. gingivalis, t. denticola, and t. forsythia in the subgingival plaque of each sampling site were significantly mutually correlated and were increased in the plaque of sites of periodontal disease with pd > or =4 mm and bop. conclusion: the symbiotic effects of p. gingivalis, t. denticola, and t. forsythia, which coaggregate and exist concomitantly in subgingival biofilms, may be associated with the local development of periodontitis.

TI  == microbial changes in patients with acute periodontal abscess after treatment detected by padotest.
AB  == aims: to investigate changes in bacterial counts in subgingival plaque from patients with acute periodontal abscess by iai-padotest. materials and methods: ninety-one patients were randomly allocated to either test or control groups. in  all the patients, pockets with acute periodontal abscess were irrigated with sterilized physiological saline, and in the test group, 2% minocycline hydrochloride ointment was applied once into the pocket in addition. subgingival  plaque samples were collected by paper point before treatment and 7 days after treatment. the total bacterial count was determined and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia, were detected using iai-padotest, a dna/rna probe method. results: the total bacterial count decreased in both groups, with a significant decrease in the test group. the counts and number of sites positive for p. gingivalis, t. forsythia and t. denticola significantly decreased in the test group after treatment, compared with those in the control group. pocket depth decreased in the both groups, with a statistically significant decrease in the test group. conclusion: topical treatment with minocycline in pockets with acute  periodontal abscess was effective in reducing the bacterial counts as shown by the microbiological investigation using padotest 4.5.

TI  == increased interleukin-18 in gingival crevicular fluid from periodontitis patients.
AB  == introduction: this study aimed to measure the levels of interleukin-18 (il-18) in inflamed shallow sites and inflamed deep sites in patients with periodontitis and to compare the data with results from inflamed shallow sites in patients with gingivitis. a secondary aim was to examine the composition of the subgingival microbiota in the sampled sites. methods: gingival crevicular fluid was collected from five gingivitis sites and five periodontitis sites from 18 patients with chronic periodontitis, and from five gingivitis sites from 15 patients with gingivitis. samples from each site category were pooled and il-18 levels were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. the subgingival microbiota was analyzed by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. results: all clinical parameters and gingival crevicular fluid volumes were higher in periodontitis sites compared with gingivitis sites from patients with periodontitis and gingivitis. the total amount of il-18 was higher in periodontitis sites than gingivitis sites in both periodontitis (p = 0.018) and gingivitis (p = 0.002) patients and was higher in gingivitis sites from periodontitis patients than in those from gingivitis patients (p = 0.015). there were higher levels of tannerella forsythia, porphyromonas gingivalis, and treponema denticola (red complex species) in periodontitis sites compared with gingivitis sites in both the periodontitis and gingivitis patients (p < 0.001). conclusion: levels of il-18 were higher in patients with chronic periodontitis compared with patients with gingivitis, even at sites with similar pocket depths. the presence of similar levels of red complex species in gingivitis sites from periodontitis patients and from gingivitis patients suggested that the higher levels of il-18 were not associated with a different microbial challenge.

AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the correlation between endodontic clinical signs and symptoms and the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia or their association by nested polymerase chain reaction assay. microbial samples were taken from 50 cases with  necrotic pulp tissues in primary infections. dna was extracted from the samples,  which were analyzed for the presence of three endodontic pathogens by using species-specific primers. p gingivalis, t denticola, and t forsythia were detected in 46%, 38%, and 22% of the symptomatic cases, respectively. the bacterial complex composed by t forsythia, p gingivalis, and t denticola was found in 14% of the cases with spontaneous pain, tenderness to percussion, swelling, and pain on palpation. the high prevalence of p gingivalis, t denticola, and t forsythia in the samples examined suggests that these bacteria are related to the etiology of symptomatic periradicular diseases.

TI  == implant surface analysis and microbiologic evaluation of failed implants retrieved from smokers.
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate the microbiota and surface of failed titanium dental implants from 4 manufacturers. twelve mobile dental implants were retrieved from 10 smokers after 3 to 10 years of functional loading. before implant removal, microbial samples were taken and evaluated using polymerase chain reaction. after implant removal, analyses of the failed implant surfaces were performed using scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive spectrometer x-ray. periodontal pathogens such as aggregactibacter actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola were detected in all implants in different proportions. surface analysis showed varying degrees of surface roughness between the samples  and the presence of proteinaceous material, appearing mainly as dark stains. foreign carbon, oxygen, sodium, calcium, aluminum, and silicon elements were also found. although no material-related causes of implant failure were detected, several periodontal pathogens were identified independently of the surface topography or manufacturer.

TI  == benefits of additional courses of systemic azithromycin in periodontal disease case report.
AB  == the strong association of subgingival anaerobic bacteria, such as porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola and tannerella forsythia, with destructive periodontal disease has been well documented in the literature. several double-blind studies have also shown the beneficial use of systemic antimicrobials that are active against these microorganisms in conjunction with conventional periodontal treatment, especially when periodontal abscesses and/or  suppuration upon probing are present. four cases with periodontal abscesses were  treated with scaling/root planing in conjunction with systemic azithromycin. partial improvement led to retreatment with two additional courses of azithromycin. bone formation was noted on periapical radiographs after the patients took additional courses of azithromycin. in view of the benefits of using additional courses of azithromycin in the treatment of destructive periodontal disease, we conclude that the single course of systemic antimicrobials currently used in periodontal therapy may be insufficient to reach necessary therapeutic levels in infected sites.

TI  == salivary detection of periodontopathic bacteria in periodontally healthy children.
AB  == background: salivary occurrence of periodontopathic bacteria is of interest especially in children as a risk indicator for the transmission, development and  control of periodontal disease. we assessed the prevalence of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and treponema denticola as microbial complexes  in the saliva of children with mixed dentition and healthy gingiva. materials and methods: paraffin-stimulated saliva samples were collected from 41 children (22 boys and 19 girls), aged 6-13 years old. gingival health was determined during the initial screening exam. the test bacteria were identified using a 16s rrna-based pcr analysis. results: p. nigrescens was the most frequent species (80%), followed by t. denticola (32%), a. actinomycetemcomitans (24%) and p. gingivalis (12%). p. intermedia and t. forsythia were not detected. p. nigrescens was also common species in combinations. paired and triple bacterial combinations were found in 24% and 20% of all children, respectively. there was no positive association between bacterial combinations in colonization and subject's gender (p>0.05, fisher exact test). conclusion: the salivary presence of p. nigrescens,  t. denticola, a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis but not p. intermedia and t. forsythia can occur in childhood without clinical signs of gingival disease. thus, the possible risk of bacterial transmissions through saliva and, the need to screen for periodontal pathogens should be considered before mixed dentition.

TI  == microbiologic analysis of periodontal pockets and carotid atheromatous plaques in advanced chronic periodontitis patients.
AB  == background: in recent years, many researchers have focused their attention on the ability of periodontal pathogens to colonize atheromatous plaques. nevertheless,  a clear correlation between the detection rates of periodontopathic bacterial dna in atheromas and in subgingival plaque samples has not been established. the aim  of our study was to assess the presence of five periodontal pathogens (actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia [formerly tannerella forsythensis]) in periodontal pockets and in carotid atheromas recovered from the same patients. methods: thirty-three patients with advanced chronic periodontitis scheduled for endarterectomy were enrolled in the study. dna was extracted from subgingival plaque samples and carotid atheromas. universal bacteria primers for  general detection of bacteria and species-specific primers for detection of periodontal pathogens were used to amplify part of the 16s rrna gene by polymerase chain reaction. results: all subgingival plaque samples were positive  for at least one target microorganism. the prevalence of t. forsythia, p. gingivalis, t. denticola, p. intermedia, and a. actinomycetemcomitans were 69.7%, 63.6%, 54.5%, 45.4%, and 33.3%, respectively. bacterial dna was detected in 31 out of 33 endarterectomy specimens. however, none of the samples tested positive  for dna from periodontal pathogens. conclusion: the presence of periodontal bacteria in atheromatous plaques was not confirmed by this investigation; thus, no correlation could be drawn between periodontitis bacteria and microorganisms involved in the atherosclerotic lesions.

AB  == background: the objective of this trial was to measure the antimicrobial effects  of a minocycline hcl microsphere (mm) local drug-delivery system when used as an  adjunct to scaling and root planing (srp). dna probe analysis for 40 bacteria was used to evaluate the oral bacteria of 127 subjects with moderate to advanced chronic periodontitis. methods: subjects were randomly assigned to either srp alone (n = 65) or mm + srp (n = 62). the primary endpoints of this study were changes in numbers and proportions of the red-complex bacteria (rcb) and the sum  of porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia (formally t. forsythensis), and treponema denticola relative to 40 oral bacteria at each test site from baseline  to day 30. numbers of rcb from the five test sites were averaged to provide a value for each subject. results: mm + srp reduced the proportion of rcb by 6.49%  and the numbers by 9.4 x 10(5). the reduction in rcb proportions and numbers by srp alone (5.03% and 5.1 x 10(5), respectively) was significantly less. in addition, mm + srp reduced probing depth by 1.38 mm (compared to 1.01 mm by srp alone), bleeding on probing was reduced by 25.2% (compared to 13.8% by srp alone), and a clinical attachment level gain of 1.16 mm (compared to 0.80 mm by srp alone) was achieved. conclusion: these observations support the hypothesis that rcbs are responsible for periodontal disease and that local antimicrobial therapy using mm + srp effectively reduces numbers of rcbs and their proportions  to a greater extent than srp alone.

TI  == periodontal pathogens in periodontal pockets and in carotid atheromatous plaques.
AB  == aim: in the last years the relationship between periodontitis and cardiovascular  diseases has been a subject of increasing research. the identification of periodontopathic bacteria in atheromas can contribute to our knowledge of such an association. the aim of our study was to assess the concomitant presence of 5 periodontal pathogens (actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia) in periodontal pockets and in carotid atheromas recovered from the same individuals. methods: twenty-one patients with chronic periodontitis scheduled for endarterectomy for carotid stenosis were enrolled in the study. subgingival plaque samples and carotid atheromas were examined using the polymerase chain reaction and reverse hybridization techniques by means of specific probes for periodontal bacteria. human beta-globin amplification was used as internal polymerase chain reaction efficiency control. results: three patients were excluded because the endarterectomy specimens were negative to dna  amplification. all subgingival plaque samples were positive for at least one target micro-organism. the prevalence of tannerella forsythia, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was 72.22%, 61.11%, 55.56%, 50%, and 33.33%, respectively.  no periodontal bacteria dna was detected in any endarterectomy specimen. conclusions: the presence of periodontal bacteria in atheromatous plaques was not confirmed by this investigation and, thus, no correlation between periodontitis bacteria and micro-organisms involved in the atherosclerotic lesions could be drawn.

TI  == identification of intracellular oral species within human crevicular epithelial cells from subjects with chronic periodontitis by fluorescence in situ hybridization.
AB  == background and objective: interactions between oral bacteria and gingival epithelial cells play an important role in the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases. this study used in situ hybridization with 16 rrna probes and confocal  microscopy to detect the periodontal pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola within epithelial cells from periodontal pockets, gingival crevice, and buccal mucosa collected from subjects with chronic periodontitis (n = 14) and good periodontal health (n = 8). material and methods: each green fluorescent species-specific and universal probe was hybridized with all 58 epithelial samples from the 22 patients. the samples were observed by confocal microscopy to confirm the intracellular localization of oral species of bacteria. the mean frequency of detection and number of intracellular bacteria per epithelial cell were computed for each sample. results: the frequency of cells with internalized  bacteria was higher in samples from the gingival crevice than in samples from the oral mucosa. epithelial cells from all subjects harbored intracellular bacteria;  however, patients with periodontitis presented significantly higher counts of bacteria per cell than periodontally healthy individuals (p < 0.05). periodontal  pathogens showed a trend to be detected in higher numbers in epithelial cells from periodontitis patients. in particular, t. forsythia and t. denticola were significantly more prevalent in periodontal pocket cells than healthy sulci and buccal cell samples in the periodontitis group (p < 0.05). conclusion: those findings indicate that crevicular and buccal cells present internalized bacteria, regardless of periodontal status. however, higher bacterial loads are detected in cells from subjects with periodontitis.

TI  == subgingival plaque microbiota in hiv positive patients.
AB  == aim: to describe and compare the predominant bacterial and fungal species associated with gingivitis, periodontitis, and linear gingival erythema (lge), in hiv positive subjects with different immune status. methods: viral loads and cd4  levels determined hiv disease status. from pooled subgingival plaque, 16s and 18s rdna were cloned and sequenced to determine species identity. results: one hundred and nine bacterial species were identified from 14 subjects. nearly half  of the species were not cultivable. notably, the classical putative periodontal pathogens, treponema denticola, porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythia were below the limit of detection and were not detected. species of gemella, dialister, streptococcus and veillonella were predominant. in one hiv positive subject with periodontitis and low viral load, gemella morbillorum, a known opportunistic pathogen, constituted 84% of the clones. saccharomyces cerevisiae was the only fungal species detected in an lge subject and in periodontitis subjects with high viral loads. in periodontitis patients with low viral loads, candida albicans was predominant, while s. cerevisiae was only a minor component. conclusion: these case studies suggest that other bacterial species, rather than  the classical periodontal pathogens, may be involved in periodontal diseases of subjects with hiv. these data are indicative of opportunistic infections in a highly susceptible immunocompromised host.

AB  == objectives: to study the short-term microbiological changes following full-mouth  compared with quadrant wise scaling and root planing (fmrp and qrp) as well as long-term effects. method: twenty patients with chronic periodontitis were randomized into a test group treated in two sessions with subgingival scaling and root planing within 24 h (fmrp) and a control group treated quadrant by quadrant  in four sessions at intervals of one week (qrp). microbiological samples were taken in the two deepest pockets of the maxillary right quadrant immediately before treatment and after 1 day, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 weeks. the samples were  evaluated by real-time pcr for quantification of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp., porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia as well as for total bacterial counts (tbc). results: treatment resulted in a tbc median log reduction of 0.75 (fmrp) and 0.72 (qrp). there were no differences between groups either for the short term (1 day-4 weeks) (analysis of variance: p=0.3150) or for long term (4-24 weeks) (analysis of variance: p=0.9671). likewise, no differences were detected for selected target bacteria. conclusion: the results of the present study showed similar microbiological outcomes following both treatment modalities.

AB  == one of the predominant polymicrobial infections of humans is expressed clinically as periodontal disease. porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia have been strongly implicated as members of a pathogenic consortium in the etiology of adult periodontitis. in this study we hypothesized  that p. gingivalis, t. denticola, and t. forsythia are synergistic in terms of virulence potential and induce chronic periodontal inflammation that leads to alveolar bone resorption in a polymicrobial infection in rats. groups of rats were infected with either p. gingivalis, t. denticola, or t. forsythia in monomicrobial infections or with all three species in polymicrobial oral infections with or without fusobacterium nucleatum. pcr analyses of oral microbial samples demonstrated that rats infected with one bacterium were orally  colonized by each of the bacteria during the study interval, and increased serum  immunoglobulin g (igg) antibody levels substantiated the interaction of the host  with the infecting bacteria. pcr analyses of the rats with polymicrobial infections demonstrated that most rats were infected with p. gingivalis, t. denticola, and t. forsythia as a consortium. furthermore, all rats exhibited a significant increase in the level of igg antibody to the polymicrobial consortium. radiographic measurement of alveolar bone resorption showed that rats infected with the polymicrobial consortium with or without f. nucleatum exhibited significantly increased alveolar bone resorption compared to the resorption in uninfected control rats, as well as the resorption in rats infected with one of the microbes. these results documented that p. gingivalis, t. denticola, and t. forsythia not only exist as a consortium that is associated with chronic periodontitis but also exhibit synergistic virulence resulting in the immunoinflammatory bone resorption characteristic of periodontitis.

TI  == prevalence of selected bacterial named species and uncultivated phylotypes in endodontic abscesses from two geographic locations.
AB  == evidence is mounting that the prevalence of some putative endodontic pathogens can significantly vary according to the geographic location in which samples were taken. this study aimed to provide additional knowledge on this subject by comparing the frequencies of 10 selected candidate endodontic pathogens in samples of acute apical abscesses obtained from two distinct geographic locations; portland, or, and rio de janeiro, brazil. dna was extracted from aspirates and used as template in nested pcr assays using 16s rrna gene taxon-specific oligonucleotide primers. of the target species/phylotypes, treponema denticola (73% of the cases), porphyromonas endodontalis (70%), and tannerella forsythia (57%) were the most prevalent taxa found in brazilian samples. dialister invisus (70% of the cases), p. endodontalis (63%) and dialister pneumosintes (55%) were the most frequent taxa in the portland, or samples. data analysis revealed that t. denticola and t. forsythia were significantly more detected in brazilian samples than in the portland, or samples. although d. invisus, filifactor alocis, and synergistes oral clone w090  were detected in many more samples from the portland, or patients, differences were not found to be statistically significant. these findings confirmed that some bacterial taxa can markedly differ in the frequencies they occur in samples  from different locations. it remains to be clarified whether this observation translates into relevant therapeutic implications.

TI  == carpegen real-time polymerase chain reaction vs. anaerobic culture for periodontal pathogen identification.
AB  == background/aims: the aim of this study was to compare two methods of microbiological diagnosis, anaerobic bacterial culture and real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr), for the detection of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans,  porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, fusobacterium nucleatum, and treponema denticola. methods: seventy-two samples were collected from 18 patients who were suffering from aggressive periodontitis. the data obtained were compared for the two methods. results: the results obtained with real-time pcr were different from those obtained with bacterial culture. the detection differences were 3% for a. actinomycetemcomitans, 8.33% for p. intermedia, and 12.5% for f. nucleatum. however, the differences for p. gingivalis and t. forsythia were 51.39% and 36.11%, respectively. no comparison was possible for t. denticola because it cannot be identified in culture. the variations found were the result of the better detection level (10(2) pathogens)  of the pcr probe. unlike bacterial culture, pcr allows the detection of t. denticola, which does not forming colonies and is oxygen sensitive. for f. nucleatum, t. forsythia and p. gingivalis, the real-time pcr technique was more sensitive than culture. conclusion: good results were obtained with the real-time pcr technique for the six periopathogens targeted. this method seems to be indicated for its simplicity, rapidity and reproducibility but it cannot analyze  data for an antibiotic susceptibility test. the periodontist must therefore choose one of these two methods according to his specific clinical objective: to  obtain rapid, specific detection even with weak initial concentrations (but for targeted periopathogens only) or to be non-specific and analyze the pathological  activity with an antibiogram.

TI  == [pathogenic potential of porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola and tannerella forsythia, the red bacterial complex associated with periodontitis].
AB  == periodontitis are mixed bacterial infections leading to destruction of tooth-supporting tissues, including periodontal ligament and alveolar bone. among over 500 bacterial species living in the oral cavity, a bacterial complex named "red complex" and made of porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola and tannerella forsythia has been strongly related to advanced periodontal lesions. while periodontopathogenic bacteria are the primary etiologic factor of periodontitis, tissue destruction essentially results from the host immune response to the bacterial challenge. members of the red complex are gram negative anaerobic bacteria expressing numerous virulence factors allowing bacteria to colonize the subgingival sites, to disturb the host defense system, to invade and destroy periodontal tissue as well as to promote the immunodestructive host response. this article reviews current knowledge of the pathogenic mechanisms of  bacteria of the red complex leading to tissue and alveolar bone destruction observed during periodontitis.

TI  == molecular analysis of filifactor alocis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola associated with primary endodontic infections and failed endodontic treatment.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the presence of strict anaerobes such as filifactor alocis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola in primary and secondary root-infected canals with periapical lesions by molecular analysis and  the association of these species with specific endodontic signs and symptoms. microbial samples were taken from 100 root canals, 50 with necrotic pulp tissues  (npt, primary infection), and 50 with failed endodontic treatment (fet, secondary infection). dna was extracted from the samples, which were analyzed for the presence of three endodontic pathogens using species-specific primers and pcr. f. alocis were isolated from 23 canals with npt and 12 canals with fet; t. forsythia from 12 canals with npt and three canals with fet; t. denticola from 19 canals with npt and 12 canals with tep. suggested associations were found between primary infection and the presence of f. alocis and t. forsythia (both p < 0.05). in particular, associations were found between: pain and f. alocis; swelling and  f. alocis; tenderness to percussion and t. forsythia; mobility and t. forsythia and t. denticola; wet canals and f. alocis, t. forsythia, and t. denticola; purulent exsudate and f. alocis, t. forsythia and t. denticola; abscess and f. alocis, t. forsythia, and t. denticola (all p < 0.05). the findings of this study indicated that f. alocis, t. forsythia, and t. denticola seem to be associated with endodontic signs and symptoms. additionally, f. alocis and t. forsythia were detected more frequently in teeth with necrotic pulp than in teeth with failing endodontic treatment.

TI  == levels of matrix metalloproteinases-8 and -9 with simultaneous presence of periodontal pathogens in gingival crevicular fluid as well as matrix metalloproteinase-9 and cholesterol in blood.
AB  == background and objectives: to investigate the levels of matrix metalloproteinase  (mmp) -8 and -9 with the simultaneous presence of periodontal pathogens in gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) as well as mmp-9 and cholesterol in blood. although bacterial pathogens are required to initiate the periodontal disease process, in some individuals the reaction to bacteria may lead to an excessive host response, resulting in a general inflammatory response. methods: mmp-9 and lipids were analyzed from the blood samples of 33 subjects with a 16-year history and oral health records of periodontal disease as well as from 31 periodontally healthy controls. information was obtained on education, body mass index, and family history of atherosclerosis. gcf was taken to determine mmp-8 and mmp-9 levels, and bacterial samples were simultaneously collected for polymerase chain  reaction assessment of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola. analysis of variance, chi-squared test, and multiple logistic regression analysis were used to analyze the results. results: demographic data showed significant differences between patients and controls in  smoking (p < 0.01), body mass index (p < 0.05), family history of atherosclerotic disease (p < 0.01), and education (p < 0.01). significant differences were also observed in oral health data, in the detection of p. gingivalis (p < 0.001), p. intermedia (p < 0.01), p. nigrescens (p < 0.001), and t. forsythia (p < 0.001) and in the levels of mmp-8 and mmp-9 in gcf between patients and controls. t. forsythia[odds ratio(or) 10.1; p = 0.001] and age (or 5.54; p = 0.008) appeared to be the main independent predictors for high mmp-8 in gcf. patients had significantly higher total cholesterol (p < 0.01), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (p = 0.05), and triglycerides (p < = 0.01) than controls. plasma levels of mmp-9 were significantly higher in patients than in controls (p = 0.001). conclusions: specific periodontal microorganisms appeared to induce host  response, with increased release of mmp-8 and mmp-9 in gingival pockets as well as of mmp-9 in plasma, possibly triggering its up-regulation in blood.

TI  == porphyromonas gingivalis vesicles enhance attachment, and the leucine-rich repeat bspa protein is required for invasion of epithelial cells by "tannerella forsythia".
AB  == the human oral cavity harbors more than 500 species of bacteria. periodontitis, a bacterially induced inflammatory disease that leads to tooth loss, is believed to result from infection by a select group of gram-negative periodontopathogens that includes porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and "tannerella forsythia" (opinion on name change from tannerella forsythensis pending; formerly bacteroides forsythus). epithelial cell invasion by periodontopathogens is considered to be an important virulence mechanism for evasion of the host defense responses. further, the epithelial cells with invading bacteria also serve as reservoirs important in recurrent infections. the present study was therefore undertaken to address the epithelial cell adherence and invasion properties of t. forsythia and the role of the cell surface-associated protein bspa in these processes. further, we were interested in determining if p. gingivalis, one of the pathogens frequently found associated in disease, or its outer membrane vesicles (omvs) could modulate the epithelial cell adherence and invasion abilities of t. forsythia. here we show that epithelial cell attachment and invasion by t. forsythia are dependent on the bspa protein. in addition, p. gingivalis or its omvs enhance the attachment and invasion of t. forsythia to epithelial cells. thus, interactions between these two bacteria may play important roles in virulence by promoting host cell attachment and invasion.

TI  == association of eubacterium nodatum and treponema denticola with human periodontitis lesions.
AB  == background: the purpose of the present investigation was to compare the levels, proportions and percentage of sites colonized by 40 bacterial species in subgingival plaque samples from periodontally healthy subjects and patients with  chronic periodontitis to seek possible pathogens other than the consensus pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythia. method: subgingival  plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in 635 subjects with chronic periodontitis and 189 periodontally healthy subjects. the samples were individually analyzed for their content of 40 bacterial species using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization (total samples = 21,832). mean counts, % dna probe counts and percentage of sites colonized at >10(5) were determined for each species in each subject and then averaged in each clinical group. significance of difference between groups was determined using the mann-whitney test. association between combinations of species and periodontal status was examined by stepwise logistic regression analysis. analyses were repeated using a subset of subjects from both clinical groups who had proportions of p. gingivalis plus t. forsythia  less than the median (4.42%) found in periodontally healthy subjects. all analyses were adjusted for multiple comparisons. results: for the 824 subjects the consensus pathogens p. gingivalis and t. forsythia as well as eubacterium nodatum and treponema denticola had significantly higher mean counts, proportions and percentage of sites colonized in samples from subjects with periodontitis than from periodontally healthy subjects. there were significantly more capnocytophaga gingivalis, streptococcus gordonii and veillonella parvula in periodontally healthy subjects. e. nodatum, t. denticola, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus intermedius, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. vincentii all had higher  counts and proportions in diseased than healthy subjects who had low proportions  of p. gingivalis and t. forsythia. logistic regression analysis indicated that the same species groups were associated with disease status after adjusting for the proportions of the other species. conclusions: this investigation confirmed the strong association of p. gingivalis and t. forsythia with chronic periodontitis and emphasized a strong association of e. nodatum and t. denticola  with periodontitis whether in the presence or absence of high levels of the consensus pathogens. other species, including s. oralis, eikenella corrodens, s.  intermedius and f. nucleatum ssp. vincentii, were associated with disease when p. gingivalis and t. forsythia were present in low proportions.

AB  == objectives: to assess the microbiological outcome of local administration of minocycline hydrochloride microspheres 1 mg (arestin) in cases with peri-implantitis and with a follow-up period of 12 months. material and methods:  after debridement, and local administration of chlorhexidine gel, peri-implantitis cases were treated with local administration of minocycline microspheres (arestin). the dna-dna checkerboard hybridization method was used to detect bacterial presence during the first 360 days of therapy. results: at day 10, lower bacterial loads for 6/40 individual bacteria including actinomyces gerensceriae (p<0.1), actinomyces israelii (p<0.01), actinomyces naeslundi type 1 (p<0.01) and type 2 (p<0.03), actinomyces odontolyticus (p<0.01), porphyromonas gingivalis (p<0.01) and treponema socranskii (p<0.01) were found. at day 360 only the levels of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were lower than at baseline (mean difference: 1x10(5); se difference: 0.34x10(5), 95% ci: 0.2x10(5) to 1.2x10(5); p<0.03). six implants were lost between days 90 and 270. the microbiota was successfully controlled in 48%, and with definitive failures (implant loss and major increase in bacterial levels) in 32% of subjects. conclusions: at study endpoint, the impact of arestin on a. actinomycetemcomitans was greater than the impact on other pathogens. up to day 180 reductions in levels of tannerella forsythia, p. gingivalis, and treponema denticola were also  found. failures in treatment could not be associated with the presence of specific pathogens or by the total bacterial load at baseline. statistical power  analysis suggested that a case control study would require approximately 200 subjects.

TI  == treponema denticola in disseminating endodontic infections.
AB  == treponema denticola is a consensus periodontal pathogen that has recently been associated with endodontic pathology. in this study, the effect of mono-infection of the dental pulp with t. denticola and with polymicrobial "red-complex" organisms (rc) (porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and t. denticola) in inducing disseminating infections in wild-type (wt) and severe-combined-immunodeficiency (scid) mice was analyzed. after 21 days, a high  incidence (5/10) of orofacial abscesses was observed in scid mice mono-infected with t. denticola, whereas abscesses were rare in scid mice infected with the red-complex organisms or in wild-type mice. splenomegaly was present in all groups, but only mono-infected scid mice had weight loss. t. denticola dna was detected in the spleen, heart, and brain of mono-infected scid mice and in the spleen from mono-infected wild-type mice, which also had more periapical bone resorption. the results indicate that t. denticola has high pathogenicity, including dissemination to distant organs, further substantiating its potential importance in oral and linked systemic conditions.

TI  == anti-inflammatory activity of a high-molecular-weight cranberry fraction on macrophages stimulated by lipopolysaccharides from periodontopathogens.
AB  == periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease affecting oral tissues. the continuous, high production of cytokines by host cells triggered by periodontopathogens is thought to be responsible for the destruction of tooth-supporting tissues. macrophages play a critical role in this host inflammatory response to periodontopathogens. the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of non-dialyzable material prepared from cranberry juice concentrate on the pro-inflammatory cytokine response of macrophages induced by lipopolysaccharides (lps) from actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, and escherichia coli. interleukin-1 beta (il-1beta), il-6, il-8, tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha), and regulated on activation normal t-cell expressed and secreted (rantes) production by macrophages treated with the cranberry fraction prior to stimulation by lps was evaluated by elisa. our results clearly indicate that the cranberry fraction was  a potent inhibitor of the pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine responses induced by lps. this suggests that cranberry constituents may offer perspectives  for the development of a new therapeutic approach to the prevention and treatment of periodontitis.

TI  == inhibition of periodontopathogen-derived proteolytic enzymes by a high-molecular-weight fraction isolated from cranberry.
AB  == background: porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola are three major aetiological agents of chronic periodontitis. the strong proteolytic activities of these bacteria are critical to their survival since their energy source is obtained from peptides and amino acids derived from  proteins. in addition, proteases are important factors contributing to periodontal tissue destruction by a variety of mechanisms, including direct tissue degradation and modulation of host inflammatory responses. objectives: the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of non-dialysable material (ndm)  prepared from cranberry juice concentrate on the proteolytic activities of p. gingivalis, t. forsythia and t. denticola. methods: the effect of ndm on gingipain and dipeptidyl peptidase iv (dpp iv) activities of p. gingivalis, trypsin-like activity of t. forsythia and chymotrypsin-like activity of t. denticola was evaluated using synthetic chromogenic peptides. in addition, the capacity of p. gingivalis to degrade fluorescein-labelled type i collagen and fluorescein-labelled transferrin in the presence of ndm was evaluated by fluorometry. results: ndm dose-dependently inhibited the proteinases of p. gingivalis, t. forsythia and t. denticola as well as type i collagen and transferrin degradation by p. gingivalis. conclusions: these results suggest that ndm has the potential to reduce either the proliferation of p. gingivalis, t. forsythia and t. denticola in periodontal pockets or their proteinase-mediated destructive process occurring in periodontitis.

TI  == inflammatory responses of a macrophage/epithelial cell co-culture model to mono and mixed infections with porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia.
AB  == accumulated evidence points to porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia as three major etiologic agents of chronic periodontitis. epithelial cells and macrophages play a major role in the host response to periodontopathogens, and the secretion of inflammatory mediators and matrix metalloproteinases (mmps) by these host cells is believed to contribute to periodontal tissue destruction. the aim of this study was to investigate the inflammatory response of a macrophage/epithelial cell co-culture model following  mono or mixed infections with the above three periodontopathogens. an in vitro co-culture model composed of epithelial-like transformed cells (hela cell line) and macrophage-like cells (phorbol myristic acid-differentiated u937 monocytic cell line) was challenged with whole cells or lipopolysaccharides (lps) of p. gingivalis, t. denticola, and t. forsythia, individually and in combination. following stimulation, the production of interleukin-1 beta (il-1beta), il-6, il-8, tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha), regulated on activation normal t cell expressed and secreted (rantes), prostaglandin e2 (pge2), and mmp-9 were quantified by enzyme-linked immunoassays. we observed that mono or mixed infections of the co-culture model induced the secretion of il-1beta, il-6, il-8, pge2, and mmp-9. p. gingivalis and t. forsythia induced an increase in rantes secretion, whereas t. denticola alone or in combination resulted in a significant decrease in rantes levels. all lps challenges induced an increase in chemokine, mmp-9, and pge2 production. no synergistic effect on the production of cytokines, chemokines, pge2, and mmp-9 was observed for any of the bacterial or lps mixtures tested. this study supports the view that p. gingivalis, t. denticola, and t. forsythia may induce high levels of pro-inflammatory mediators and mmp-9 in periodontal lesions, thus contributing to the progression of periodontitis.

AB  == the objective of this study was to detect and compare the presence of periodontopathogens in the subgingival plaques of gingivitis lesions in adults who wore fixed orthodontic appliances, as opposed to adults who did not wear any  orthodontic appliances. thirty-six individuals participated in this study. nineteen of these subjects did not wear any orthodontic appliances, and these subjects comprised the control group. the other 17 individuals had been wearing fixed orthodontic appliances for at least 3 months each. after a periodontal examination, we collected subgingival plaque samples from the gingivitis lesions  of each patient. using pcr based on 16s rdna, we detected the presence of 6 putative periodontopathogenic species, treponema denticola, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia (formerly bacteroides forsythus), prevotella nigrescens, prevotella intermedia, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. with regard to the presence of individual periodontopathogens, we found that t. forsythia, t. denticola, and p. nigrescens were significantly more common in the  samples obtained from the orthodontic patients than in the samples obtained from  the non-orthodontic patient controls. our results indicate that the local changes associated with the wearing of fixed orthodontic appliances may affect the prevalence of periodontopathogens in subgingival dental plaques.

AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the microbial composition of necrotic root canals using culture methods and microarray technology. twenty uniradicular  teeth with radiographic evidence of periapical bone loss and with no previous endodontic treatment were selected for this study. for molecular diagnosis a dna  chip with 20 different species-specific, 16s-rdna-directed catcher probes was used. the microorganisms most frequently detected by the dna chip were: micromonas micros, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp., tannerella forsythia, treponema  denticola, veillonella parvula, eubacterium nodatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, actinomyces odontolyticus, and streptococcus constellatus. as expected, additional important bacterial taxa were found by culture analysis, but microorganisms such as t. forsythia and t. denticola could not be identified. in  conclusion, microarrays may provide significant additional information regarding  the endodontic microbiota by detecting bacterial species that are otherwise difficult or impossible to culture.

TI  == loop-mediated isothermal amplification method for rapid detection of the periodontopathic bacteria porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola.
AB  == loop-mediated isothermal amplification (lamp), a novel nucleic acid amplification method, was developed for the rapid detection of the major periodontal pathogens  porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola. the lamp method amplifies dna with high specificity, efficiency, and rapidity under isothermal conditions using a set of four specially designed primers and a dna polymerase with strand displacement activity. in this study, we initially designed the primers for lamp assays to detect these bacteria and evaluated the specificity and sensitivity of these assays. the specificities of the primers for these bacteria were examined using various oral bacteria and various reaction times. the lower detection limits of the 60-min lamp reaction without loop primers were 1 microg/tube for p. gingivalis, 10 fg/tube for t. forsythia, and 1  ng/tube for t. denticola. addition of the loop primers for each bacterium improved the detection specificities and sensitivities by several magnitudes. furthermore, lamp assays were applied to the rapid detection of these periodontal pathogens in clinical specimens, and the results were compared with those of conventional pcr detection. the results of the lamp assays corresponded to those  of conventional pcr assays. these results indicate that the lamp assay is an extremely rapid, highly sensitive, specific method. this method is very useful for the rapid detection of periodontopathic bacteria and the diagnosis of periodontal disease.

TI  == severe periodontitis in a 5-year-old girl with hyperimmunoglobulin e syndrome.
AB  == the hyperimmunoglobulin e syndrome (hies) is a multisystem disorder that affects  the: (1) dentition; (2) skeleton; (3) connective tissues; and (4) immune system.  little is known about periodontal manifestations of the syndrome. the purpose of  this report was to describe a 5-year-old girl with suspected autosomal-recessive  hies syndrome who revealed profusely bleeding and painful gingiva and generalized aggressive periodontitis. a polymerase chain reaction (pcr)-based microbiological examination detected porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, prevotella nigrescens, treponema denticola, eikenella corrodens, and campylobacter rectus in the deep periodontitis lesions. the extraction of all deciduous teeth due to a poor prognosis and risk of systemic infection led to resolution of the oral inflammation. long-term follow-up is required to determine the periodontal prognosis of the erupting permanent teeth.

TI  == differences in prevalence of selected bacterial species in primary endodontic infections from two distinct geographic locations.
AB  == objective: this study intended to compare the prevalence of 7 putative endodontic pathogens in samples of primary endodontic infections taken from patients of 2 distant geographic locations. study design: samples from infected root canals associated with asymptomatic periradicular lesions or from pus aspirated from acute periradicular abscesses were collected from patients in rio de janeiro, brazil, and seoul, south korea. south korean samples were frozen and delivered to brazil, where all steps in the molecular analysis were performed. dna was extracted and a species-specific nested polymerase chain reaction assay was used  to detect 7 target bacterial species. results: the most prevalent species detected in brazilian samples were porphyromonas endodontalis (79% of the cases)  , treponema denticola (79%), and dialister pneumosintes (76%). the most prevalent species found in south korean samples were fusobacterium nucleatum (38% of the cases) , tannerella forsythia (26%), and treponema maltophilum (24%). overall, p  endodontalis, d pneumosintes, filifactor alocis, t denticola, and t forsythia were significantly more detected in brazilian samples than in south korean samples ( p < .05). conclusions: findings indicated that the prevalence of some species in infections of endodontic origin may significantly differ from one geographic location to another.

TI  == quantitative detection of volatile sulfur compound- producing microorganisms in oral specimens using real-time pcr.
AB  == objective: it is well-known that some periodontopathic bacteria, especially porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, tannerella forsythia (formerly bacteroides forsythus or tan. forsythensis), and treponema denticola, actively produce volatile sulfur compounds (vscs), such as h2s and ch3sh. we previously reported a qualitative relationship between periodontopathic bacteria and vscs; however, a quantitative analysis of periodontopathic bacteria in oral specimens is required for further characterization of the relationship between oral bacteria and vscs. in this study, we report a real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) method for the quantitative analysis of vsc-producing bacteria in oral specimens. subjects and methods: specimens were collected from 22 patients who visited the preventive dentistry and breath odor clinic of kyushu dental college. a real-time pcr assay using the taqman system, based on the 5'-3' exonuclease activity of taq polymerase, was employed for the quantitative analysis of periodontopathic bacteria that produce vscs. results: using real-time pcr, we performed a quantitative analysis of p. gingivalis, f. nucleatum, tan. forsythia, and t. denticola in the saliva, on the tongue coat, and in the subgingival plaque of patients with oral malodor. conclusion: real-time pcr using the taqman system  can be used for the quantitative analysis of vsc-producing oral bacteria.

TI  == impact of sample storage on detection of periodontal bacteria.
AB  == background/aims: information on the impact of sample storage prior to analysis by dna methods is limited. the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of subgingival sample storage on bacterial detection and enumeration. material and methods: subgingival plaque samples were studied by a) checkerboard dna-dna hybridization by immediate processing, b) storage at + 4 degrees c for 6 weeks, c) storage at - 20 degrees c for 6 months or d) storage at - 20 degrees c for 12  months. results: no differences in total dna were found between protocol 1 and 2, or between protocol 3 and 4. protocol 1 yielded 2.4 times more total bacterial dna than did protocol 3 (p < 0.001). actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and campylobacter gracilis were detected in 21.1% of the immediately processed samples but only in 6.6% of the samples after 12 months of storage. similar changes were noticed for treponema denticola, which was detected in 22.3% and 9.2%, respectively. streptococci spp., fusobacterium nucleatum and tannerella forsythia did not seem to be affected by storage. in contrast, the level of campylobacter rectus detection frequency changed from 2.6% if processed immediately to 15.8% if samples were stored for 12 months. conclusions: in longitudinal clinical studies including microbiological samples and processed with dna-dna hybridization methods, samples should be stored for the same period  of time before processing to avoid loss of microbiological information.

TI  == herpesviruses, the missing link between gingivitis and periodontitis?
AB  == herpesviruses appear to assume a major etiopathogenic role in various types of destructive periodontal disease. human cytomegalovirus (hcmv), epstein-barr virus (ebv) and hcmv-ebv co-infection are closely associated with disease-active periodontitis in juveniles and adults, with acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis in children, and with periodontal abscesses. in particular, hcmv reactivation in periodontitis lesions seems to be linked to advancing disease. hcmv infects periodontal monocytes/macrophages and t-lymphocytes, and ebv infects periodontal b-lymphocytes. herpesvirus-infected inflammatory cells generate a great variety of pro-inflammatory cytokines and may possess diminished ability to defend against bacterial challenge. herpesvirus-associated periodontal sites tend to harbor elevated levels of periodontopathic bacteria, including dialister pneumosintes, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, treponema denticola, campylobacter rectus and  actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. in summary, the available data suggest that periodontitis occurs more frequently and progresses more rapidly in herpesvirus-infected than in non-infected periodontal sites. an infectious disease model based on herpesvirus-bacteria-host immune response interactions is  presented to explain how a gingivitis lesion or a stable periodontal site with increased probing depth may convert into a tissue-destroying periodontitis lesion.

TI  == contribution of periodontal pathogens on tongue dorsa analyzed with real-time pcr to oral malodor.
AB  == oral malodor is considered to originate primarily from tongue microbiota populations. however, the relationship between oral malodor and tongue microbiota remains unclear. in this study, tongue periodontal pathogens were analyzed via real-time pcr, and the association between oral malodor and tongue periodontal pathogens, including porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and treponema denticola, was examined. the subject population consisted of 29 individuals with and 10 healthy persons without oral malodor. oral malodor was assessed by organoleptic test and volatile sulfur compound (vsc) levels as measured by gas chromatography. real-time pcr was conducted for anaerobes in tongue biofilm samples employing a lightcycler system; furthermore, bacterial proportion served as a quantitative parameter. among the five anaerobes, only t. forsythia displayed higher proportions in malodor subjects than corresponding values in healthy controls. proportions of p. intermedia and p. nigrescens correlated strongly with hydrogen sulfide concentration. proportions of p. gingivalis and p. nigrescens also exhibited strong correlation with methyl mercaptan concentration. the correlation coefficient between the proportion of the total of the five anaerobes and total vsc level (r = 0.88) was greater than that between bacterial proportion and organoleptic score (r = 0.29). when a linear regression analysis was performed utilizing the proportion of each of the five periodontal pathogens as an independent variable, the explanatory power of these independent variables revealed 81% for total vsc level and 16% for organoleptic score. these results suggest that these five periodontal pathogens on tongue dorsa may contribute greatly to vsc production.

TI  == quantitative detection of periodontal pathogens using real-time polymerase chain  reaction with taqman probes.
AB  == quantitative analysis, with identification of periodontopathic bacteria, is important for the diagnosis, therapeutic evaluation and risk assessment of periodontal disease. we developed a highly sensitive and specific method using real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) to detect and quantify six periodontal  bacteria: porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, treponema denticola, prevotella intermedia, and prevotella nigrescens. species-specific taqman probe/primer sets were designed according to  16s ribosomal rna gene sequences. plaque and tongue debris specimens were collected from 10 patients with advanced periodontitis and 10 periodontal healthy individuals and analyzed. all species, except for p. nigrescens, were detected in samples from diseased sites in significantly greater numbers than in those from healthy sites, whereas greater numbers of p. nigrescens were found in the controls. these results suggest that the present real-time pcr method with the designed probe/primer sets enabled sensitive detection of the six periodontal bacteria, and may also assist future microbial studies of periodontal diseases.
