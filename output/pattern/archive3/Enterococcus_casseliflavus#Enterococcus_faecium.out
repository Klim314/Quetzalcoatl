prevalence and antimicrobial resistance of enterococcus species: a hospital-based study in china.
objective: to investigate the prevalence and antimicrobial resistance of enterococcus species isolated from a university hospital, and explore the mechanisms underlying the antimicrobial resistance, so as to provide clinical evidence for the inappropriate clinical use of antimicrobial agents and the control and prevention of enterococcal infections. methods: a total of 1,157 enterococcal strains isolated from various clinical specimens from january 2010 to december 2012 in the general hospital of ningxia medical university were identified to species level with a vitek-2 compact fully automated microbiological system, and the antimicrobial susceptibility of enterococcus species was determined using the kirby-bauer disc diffusion method. the multiple-drug resistant enterococcal isolates were screened from the clinical isolates of enterococcus species from the burns department. the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) of enterococcus species to the three fluoroquinolones, including ciprofloxacin, gatifloxacin and levofloxacin was determined with the agar dilution method, and the changes in the mic of enterococcus species to the three fluoroquinolones following reserpine treatment were evaluated. the beta-lactam, aminoglycoside, tetracycline, macrolide, glycopeptide resistance genes and the efflux pump emea genes were detected in the enterococcal isolates using a polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay. results: the 1,157 clinical isolates of enterococcus species included 679 e. faecium isolates (58.7%), 382 e. faecalis isolates (33%), 26 e. casseliflavus isolates (2.2%), 24 e. avium isolates (2.1%), and 46 isolates of other enterococcus species (4%). the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance varied significantly between e. faecium and e. faecalis, and </= 1.1% of these two enterococcus species were found to be resistant to vancomycin, teicoplanin or linezolid. in addition, the enterococcus species isolated from different departments of the hospital exhibited various resistances to the same antimicrobial agent, while reserpine treatment reduced the resistance of enterococcus species to ciprofloxacin, gatifloxacin and levofloxacin. the beta-lactamase gene tem, aminoglycoside-modifying-enzyme genes aac(6')-aph(2"), aph(3')-iii, ant(6)-i and ant(2")-i, tetracycline resistance gene tetm, erythromycin resistance gene ermb, vancomycin resistance gene vana and the enterococcal multidrug resistance efflux emea gene were detected in 77%, 62%, 26%, 13%, 36%, 31%, 66%, 5% and 55% of the 100 multiple-drug resistant enterococcal isolates. conclusions: similar to previous findings, e. faecium and e. faecalis are predominant conditionally pathogenic bacteria that cause hospital-acquired infections that can cause urinary and respiratory system infections. multiple and high-level antimicrobial resistance is highly prevalent in the hospital isolates of enterococcus species. reserpine treatment inhibits the active efflux of enterococcus species to ciprofloxacin, gatifloxacin and levofloxacin in vitro and reduces the mic of enterococcus species to these three fluoroquinolones. the presence of the enterococcal multidrug resistance efflux emea gene is associated with the resistance to antibiotics in enterococcus species. the monitoring of the prevalence and antimicrobial resistance of enterococcus species is of great significance to guide the control and prevention of enterococcal infections.
assessment of safe enterococci as bioprotective cultures in low-acid fermented sausages combined with high hydrostatic pressure.
three bacteriocinogenic, non-aminogenic and non-virulent enterococcus strains (enterococcus faecium ctc8005, enterococcus devriesei ctc8006 and enterococcus casseliflavus ctc8003) were used as starter cultures in low-acid fermented sausages to assess their competitiveness and their bioprotective potential against listeria monocytogenes and staphylococcus aureus. the inoculated strains were successfully monitored by rapd-pcr. all the strains were able to grow, survive and dominate the endogenous enterococci population and avoided the growth of enterobacteriaceae. e. devriesei ctc8006 and e. faecium ctc8005 particularly inhibited the growth of l. monocytogenes during the whole ripening process. s. aureus was not affected by the inoculated bacteriocinogenic enterococci strains. the application of high hydrostatic pressure (hhp) treatment (600 mpa for 5 min) at the end of ripening (day 21) produced an immediate reduction in the counts of enterobacteriaceae to levels <1 log cfu/g and promoted a decrease of 1-log unit in the counts of s. aureus. e. faecium ctc8005, which reduced the counts of l. monocytogenes ca. 2 log cfu/g immediately after stuffing and in combination with hhp treatment promoted a further reduction of 1 log cfu/g in the pathogen counts. the combination of e. faecium ctc8005 and hhp was the most efficient antilisterial approach.
phenotypic and genotypic characterization of bacteriocins in enterococcal isolates of different sources.
a collection of 57 enterococcal isolates from different origin (including river,  treatment plant, spring and garbage water, soil, animal, and vegetables from aydin) was screened for the production of bacteriocins. enterococci were identified at species levels as enterococcus faecium (34), e. hirae (6), e. casseliflavus (4), e. durans (4), e. faecalis (4), e. mundtii (3) and e. avium (2). of the 57 isolates 40 of them inhibited the growth of at least one indicator bacterium. based on our pcr results 54 strains possesed enterocin genes. the genes of enta and entb were the most frequently detected structural genes among the pcr positive strains (54 and 53 strains, respectively) and the entb gene was always associated with enta gene. the highest combination of enterocin genes (24 of 54 strains) detected was enta, entb, entp and entl50a/b. the enterocins as-48 and cyll(ls) genes were not found. three enterococcal isolates, 2 e. faecium and 1 e. hirae were not harbour any of tested enterocin genes. no correlation between the presence of enterocin structural genes and the origin of the strain was detected, also no relationship seemed to exist between the tested enterocin genes and the activity spectra of isolates. genes encoding bacteriocins are widely disseminated among enterocci from different origin and more studies should be done for evaluate industrial potential of bacteriocins. electronic supplementary material: the online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s12088-011-0143-0) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.
first detection of the staphylococcal trimethoprim resistance gene dfrk and the dfrk-carrying transposon tn559 in enterococci.
the trimethoprim resistance gene dfrk has been recently described in staphylococcus aureus, but so far has not been found in other bacteria. a total of 166 enterococci of different species (e. faecium, e. faecalis, e. hirae, e. durans, e. gallinarum, and e. casseliflavus) and origins (food, clinical diseases in humans, healthy humans or animals, and sewage) were studied for their susceptibility to trimethoprim as determined by agar dilution (european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing) and the presence of (a) the dfrk gene and its genetic environment and (b) other dfr genes. the dfrk gene was detected in 49% of the enterococci (64% and 42% of isolates with minimum inhibitory concentrations of >/=2 mg/l or </=1 mg/l, respectively). the tet(l)-dfrk linkage was detected in 21% of dfrk-positive enterococci. the chromosomal location of the dfrk gene was identified in one e. faecium isolate in which the dfrk was not linked to tet(l) gene but was part of a tn559 element, which was integrated in the chromosomal radc gene. this tn559 element was also found in 14 additional isolates. all combinations of dfr genes were detected among the isolates tested (dfrk, dfrg, dfrf, dfrk+dfrg, dfrk+dfrf, dfrf+dfrg, and dfrf+dfrg+dfrk). the gene dfrk gene was found together with other dfr genes in 58% of the tested enterococci. this study suggested an exchange of the trimethoprim resistance gene dfrk between enterococci and staphylococci, as previously observed for the trimethoprim resistance gene dfrg.
vancomycin-resistant enterococci from portuguese wastewater treatment plants.
the objective of this study was to evaluate the incidence of vancomycin resistant enterococci in sludge and sewage of urban and poultry-slaughterhouse wastewater treatment plants. a total of 17 vancomycin resistant enterococci (eight vana -containing enterococcus faecium and nine vanc1/vanc2 -containing enterococcus gallinarum/casseliflavus) were found among 499 isolates of sewage and sludge samples of 14 urban and nine poultry-slaughterhouse wastewater treatment plants. these seventeen vre isolates showed resistance to kanamycin (n = 8), tetracycline (n = 7), erythromycin (n = 7), ciprofloxacin (n = 7), ampicillin (n = 7), streptomycin (n = 6), and gentamicin (n = 2). the tetm gene, related with tetracycline resistance, was found in six of eight van a-containing isolates, in all seven vanc-1 isolates and in one of two vanc-2 isolates. the ermb gene in seven erythromycin-resistant isolates; and the aac6 '-aph2 '' gene in the two high-level-gentamicin-resistant isolates. moreover, two vana -containing e. faecium isolates harbored the hyl virulence gene, and three isolates the enta bacteriocin gene. the purk-1 allele was detected in our urban vana -containing e. faecium isolate, and we found as well the purk-6 allele in one poultry-slaughterhouse vana -containing e. faecium isolate. this study suggests that the wastewater treatment plants might be an important source of dissemination of antibiotic-resistant enterococci in portugal.
assessment of environmental enterococci: bacterial antagonism, pathogenic capacity and antibiotic resistance.
the properties of 166 environmental strains belonging to the seven enterococcal species were studied. enterococci originated mainly from surface- and waste-waters. they were screened for the presence of enterocins, virulence factors, and antibiotic resistance. the presence of different enterocin genes (enta, entb, entp, ent31, entl50ab) was frequently observed in our enterococcal isolates, 109 strains contained at least one enterocin gene. the distribution of enterocin genes varied according to the species, the genes were present mainly in e. hirae and e. faecium. by enterocin spot assay, 10 isolates inhibited the growth of listeria strains. to evaluate the pathogenic ability of isolates, the distribution of selected virulence genes (cyla, gele and esp) was investigated, eleven strains were positive in some of these genes, five of them belonged to e. faecalis. regarding the antibiotic resistance of isolates, only two strains were multiresistant and two strains (e. hirae and e. casseliflavus) were resistant to vancomycin.
prevalence and characterization of enterococcus spp. isolated from brazilian foods.
enterococci can be used in the food industry as starter or probiotic cultures. however, enterococci are also implicated in severe multi-resistant nosocomial infections. in this study, the prevalence of enterococci in selected brazilian foodstuffs (raw and pasteurized milk, meat products, cheeses and vegetables) was evaluated. phenotypic and pcr protocols were used for species identification. tests for production of gelatinase, haemolysin, bacteriocin and bile salt hydrolysis were done with all enterococci isolates, whereas molecular determination of virulence markers (genes esp, gel, ace, as, efaa, hyl and cyla) and antibiotic resistance was checked only for enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis isolates. the antibiotic-resistant isolates were assayed for biofilm formation and adhesion to mammalian cells. from the 120 food samples analyzed, 52.5% were positive for enterococci, meat and cheese being the most contaminated. e. faecium was the predominant species, followed by e. faecalis, e. casseliflavus and enterococcus gallinarum. phenotypic tests indicated that 67.7% of isolates hydrolyzed bile salts, 15.2% produced bacteriocin, 12.0% were beta-hemolytic and 18.2% produced gelatinase. antibiotic resistance (gentamicin, tetracycline and erythromycin) and genes encoding for virulence traits were more frequent in e. faecalis than in e. faecium. three e. faecium isolates were resistant to vancomycin. among antibiotic-resistant isolates, 72.4% of e. faecalis were able to form biofilm and 13.8% to adhere to caco-2 cells. antibiotic-resistant e. faecalis and e. faecium isolates were grouped by rapd-pcr and a scattered distribution was noted, indicating that resistance was not related to a particular clone. the spread of virulence/resistance traits in isolates of the two species and different rapd-types suggest the pathogenic potential of both species. by contrast, the recovery of bacteriocinogenic e. faecium isolates with no virulence traits suggests their potential for biotechnological applications. in conclusion, our results showed that enterococci from brazilian foods present important dualist aspects for food safety.
antimicrobial susceptibility of enterococcus species isolated from slovak bryndza cheese.
three hundred and ten enterococcal isolates (178 enterococcus faecium, 68 e. durans, 49 e. faecalis, 8 e. italicus, 3 e. gallinarum, 3 e. casseliflavus, and 1 e. hirae) from slovak bryndza cheese were evaluated for susceptibility to nine antimicrobial agents (vancomycin, teicoplanin, ampicillin, streptomycin, gentamicin, erythromycin, rifampicin, nitrofurantoin, and ciprofloxacin). all enterococcal isolates from bryndza cheese were susceptible to ampicillin, streptomycin, gentamicin, vancomycin, and teicoplanin as determined by the disk diffusion method. vancomycin resistance genes vana and vanb were not detected. resistance rates of enterococcal isolates to rifampicin, erythromycin, ciprofloxacin, and nitrofurantoin were 24, 26, 2, and 1 %, respectively. thirty-six % of e. faecium isolates and 22 % of the e. faecalis isolates were resistant to erythromycin. resistance to rifampicin was similar in e. faecium (31 %) and e. faecalis (29 %). both e. faecium and e. faecalis strains showed the same resistance to ciprofloxacin (2 %). e. durans isolates showed low levels of resistance to rifampicin, erythromycin, ciprofloxacin, and nitrofurantoin (1-4 %). forty-eight (30 %) of the e. faecium isolates, two (3 %) of the e. durans isolates, and six (12 %) of the e. faecalis isolates exhibited multidrug resistance. the highest frequency of resistant enterococci was observed in bryndza produced in winter season.
molecular epidemiology and antimicrobial susceptibility of enterococci recovered  from brazilian intensive care units.
we studied the antimicrobial resistance and the molecular epidemiology of 99 enterococcal surveillance isolates from two hospitals of brasilia, brazil. conventional biochemical tests were used to identify the enterococcal species and the disk diffusion method was used to determine their resistance profiles. enterococcus faecalis (76%) and e. faecium (9%) were the most prevalent species. no enterococci showed the vana or vanb vancomycin resistance phenotypes or genotypes. only the intrinsically resistant species e. gallinarum (n=2) and e. casseliflavus (n=3) harbored the vancomycin-resistance genes vanc1 and vanc2/3, respectively. we found e. faecalis isolates with high-level resistance to gentamicin (22%) and streptomycin (8%) and both e. faecalis and e. faecium isolates with resistance to more than two antimicrobials (84% and 67%, respectively). nine e. faecalis isolates (12%) were resistant to ampicillin; the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) values were 16 microg/ml (n=6) and 32 microg/ml (n=3). among these ampicillin-resistant e. faecalis, seven were also resistant to gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, rifampin, penicillin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline and erythromycin. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis classified those isolates in three different genotypes, suggesting dissemination of genetically related ampicillin-resistant e. faecalis strains among different patients.
species distribution and antibiotic resistance patterns of enterococci isolated from food of animal origin in germany.
presently, enterococci take the third place of bacterial pathogens associated with nosocomial infections, after staphylococci and escherichia coli. especially, the resistances of enterococci to several available antibiotics are threatening. we attempted to determine which species of enterococci could be found in food of animal origin and their significance according to their antibiotic resistances for human beings. from november 2000 to may 2002 we investigated 155 samples of food of animal origin bought in retail outlets in germany: 27 samples of sausages, 19 of ham, 83 of minced meat, 26 of cheese. from these food samples we isolated 416 enterococcal strains. the most frequent species was enterococcus faecalis (299 strains); furthermore, we found enterococcus faecium (54 strains), enterococcus durans together with enterococcus hirae (24 strains), enterococcus casseliflavus (22 strains), enterococcus avium (9 strains) and enterococcus gallinarum (8 strains). we focused on the resistance patterns of 118 selected e. faecium and e. faecalis strains to 13 antimicrobial active agents (ampicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, avilamycin, chloramphenicol, enrofloxacin, erythromycin, flavomycin, gentamicin, penicillin, quinupristin/dalfopristin, teicoplanin, tetracycline and vancomycin). from the clinical point of view, the situation of antibiotic resistance to the examined antimicrobial agents seemed to be favourable. the investigated strains were sensitive to ampicillin and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. these antibiotics are, in combination with an aminoglycoside, for example gentamicin, agents of choice for the treatment of enterococcal infections in human medicine. only one e. faecium strain was resistant to penicillin, while all strains were sensitive to the glycopeptide antibiotics, vancomycin and teicoplanin. resistances found against the antibiotics, tetracycline, quinupristin/dalfopristin and erythromycin, are causes for concern.
species composition and antimicrobial resistance genes of enterococcus spp, isolated from integrated and traditional fish farms in thailand.
integrated fish farming uses the manure from animal husbandry as fertilisers in the fish ponds. a total of 410 enterococcal isolates, from integrated and traditional fish farms in thailand, were collected to assess whether the input of manure from chickens receiving feed containing growth promoters and antimicrobial treatments influenced the species composition and the bacterial antimicrobial resistance in the fish pond environment. enterococcus faecium and e. faecalis were the predominate species isolated from the integrated farms, whereas e. casseliflavus and e. mundtii isolates were most prevalent in traditional farms. enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium demonstrated the highest prevalence of resistance, whereas e. mundtii isolates were susceptible to all antimicrobials tested. all the enterococci species isolated from the integrated farms, generally demonstrated higher resistance phenotypes to the tested antimicrobials compared with the same species from traditional farms. the erm(b) and tet(m) genes, associated with resistance to erythromycin and tetracycline, respectively, were found in 87% of the erythromycin-resistant and 95% of the oxytetracycline-resistant enterococci isolates respectively. these results suggest that the species composition and antimicrobial resistance of enterococci in tropical aquatic environments are influenced by faecal and antimicrobial pollution.
[susceptibilities of enterococcus faecium, prsp and mrsa to rp59500 and their correlations with those to other drugs].
investigations on emergence of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vref) which has recently been attracting attention, especially in the western countries, have been conducted in japan. a total of 1,239 isolates of e. faecium were collected from 19 institutions during the period of april 1995 and june 1996, in the purpose of evaluating susceptibilities to variety of antimicrobial agents, including rp59500 and vancomycin (vcm), and detecting vancomycin-resistant genes (van genes). susceptibilities of penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae (prsp) and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) were also studied. as a result, 2 isolates of e. faecium were found to be moderately resistant to vcm showing mic of 8 micrograms/ml though the final identification in species level and the detection of van genes by pcr method have not been completed. on the other hand there detected no mrsa nor prsp showing moderately resistant or resistant to vcm. it was concluded that rp59500 and vcm possessed favorable activity against clinically isolated e. faecium, prsp and mrsa. among other species of enterococci, moderately resistant strains to vcm showing mic of 8 micrograms/ml were detected; 10 isolates of e. gallinarum, 4 of e. casseliflavus and 2 of e. flavescens. in those isolates, vanc1 and vanc2 were detected by pcr, and vanb was also detected in a isolates of e. gallinarum simultaneously.
the effect of ph on the inhibition of bacterial growth by physiological concentrations of butyric acid: implications for neonates fed on suckled milk.
butyric acid is released from milk by pre-intestinal lipases during suckling. it  is also known to inhibit bacterial growth. to investigate whether butyric acid may be a significant factor in controlling bacterial growth in the stomach of pre-weaned animals, the ability of butyric acid to inhibit growth of selected bacteria was tested over physiological ranges of ph and butyric acid concentrations. six enteric and environmental strains of bacteria were used: two strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, and enterococcus casseliflavus. at ph 4.5 and 5.0, the growth of all organisms was significantly inhibited in the presence of butyrate, and in some cases growth was completely arrested. at ph 6.0, butyric acid did not affect bacterial growth until the concentration reached 40 mm. the maximum concentration of butyric acid available in cow's milk after incubation with pre-gastric lipase is approximately 16 mm, which would be sufficient to prevent growth of the organisms tested at ph values occurring in the stomach. therefore, butyric acid inhibition of bacterial growth may explain in part, the role of pre-intestinal lipases in young animals' natural defenses against bacteria in ingested food prior to weaning.
effects of different test conditions on mics of food animal growth-promoting antibacterial agents for enterococci.
the influence of the addition of sheep blood to mueller-hinton ii agar and the effects of aerobic incubation with or without co2 and of anaerobic incubation were tested with bacitracin, tylosin, avoparcin, virginiamycin, avilamycin, narasin, and flavomycin on enterococci. the antibacterial activity of bambermycin (flavomycin) was strongly inhibited by the addition of blood, except with the species enterococcus faecium, enterococcus mundtii, enterococcus hirae, enterococcus casseliflavus, and enterococcus gallinarum, which were not susceptible to this antibiotic on blood-free medium. with all other antimicrobials except avoparcin and tylosin, the presence of blood resulted in mic increases of 1 to 3 log2 differences. incubation in aerobic or anaerobic atmospheres enriched with co2 lowered the susceptibility of enterococci to tylosin and increased their susceptibility to avilamycin, narasin, and avoparcin. this effect was most pronounced in tests on blood-free media. results of susceptibility tests incubated under anaerobiosis and in a co2-enriched atmosphere did not differ. for all enterococcal species, the preferred conditions for testing the susceptibility are mueller-hinton ii medium supplemented with blood and incubation in a co2-enriched atmosphere. however, when only e. faecium and enterococcus faecalis are being tested, mueller-hinton ii medium without blood incubated aerobically gives satisfactory results.
effect of vancomycin on intestinal flora of patients who previously received antimicrobial therapy.
to evaluate the ecological disturbances of peroral vancomycin administration following cephalosporin administration, 20 healthy volunteers received cefuroxime axetil tablets (250 mg) perorally twice a day for 1 week, and 10 of these volunteers subsequently received vancomycin capsules (125 mg) perorally four times daily for 7 days. the concentration of vancomycin in feces after 1 week of vancomycin administration was high (mean +/- sd, 520 +/- 197 mg/kg), which correlated with the ecological disturbances noted in the vancomycin recipients. vancomycin administration resulted in a rapid decrease in the numbers of intestinal enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, and enterococcus durans (p < or = .05), while there was a significant emergence of motile enterococci with decreased susceptibility to vancomycin (enterococcus gallinarum and enterococcus casseliflavus; minimum inhibitory concentration, 4-16 mg/l) (p < or = .01). because of vancomycin administration, there was also a significant overgrowth of vancomycin-resistant pediococcus species and lactobacilli as well as of klebsiella species, citrobacter species, and enterobacter species (p < or = .01). the numbers of bifidobacteria and bacteroides species were significantly reduced during vancomycin administration. none of the enterococcal strains carried vana or vanb. twenty-two of the 27 motile enterococci carried the vanc-1 gene specific for e. gallinarum, whereas five strains carried the vanc-2(c-3) gene, thus implicating that they were e. casseliflavus or enterococcus flavescens.
distribution and characterization of enterococcus species in municipal sewages.
the occurrence, distribution and characterization of enterococci in municipal sewages from two geographically different regional sewage treatment plants in east slovakia was studied. the total counts of enterococci in samples varied from 10(4) to 10(6) cfu/ml. the vast majority of the strains identified were enterococcus faecium (50%), with e. gallinarum (25.5%) and e. casseliflavus (10.1%). the species which accounted for 14.4% of the cultures were not specified. lactic acid production from twenty isolates ranged from 0.085 mol l-1 to 0.914 mol l-1. urease activity ranged from 1.21 nkat ml-1 to 10.49 nkat ml-1. the strains were resistant to at least one (except for vancomycin) and at most to six antibiotics tested. the majority of isolates were biresistant. although nine strains were without bacteriocin production, the other strains inhibited the growth of enterococcal as well as staphylococcal isolates. e. faecium al 40 produced bacteriocin which inhibited the growth of all indicators reaching 12 mm zones of inhibition. e. faecium was the most prevalent species in all samples, but the source position of isolates as well as the sewage composition did not affect enterococcal distribution. the ability of isolates to produce bacteriocin indicates their possible use in biotechnological environmental processes.
semisynthetic glycopeptide antibiotics derived from ly264826 active against vancomycin-resistant enterococci.
certain derivatives of the glycopeptide antibiotic ly264826 with n-alkyl-linked substitutions on the epivancosamine sugar are active against glycopeptide-resistant enterococci. six compounds representing our most active series were evaluated for activity against antibiotic-resistant, gram-positive pathogens. for enterococcus faecium and e. faecalis resistant to both vancomycin and teicoplanin, the mics of the six semisynthetic compounds for 90% of the strains tested were 1 to 4 micrograms/ml, compared with 2,048 micrograms/ml for vancomycin and 256 micrograms/ml for ly264826. for e. faecium and e. faecalis resistant to vancomycin but not teicoplanin, the mics were 0.016 to 1 micrograms/ml, compared with 64 to 1,024 micrograms/ml for vancomycin. the compounds were highly active against vancomycin-susceptible enterococci and against e. gallinarum and e. casseliflavus and showed some activity against isolates of highly vancomycin-resistant leuconostocs and pediococci. the mics for 90% of the strains of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus tested were typically 0.25 to 1 micrograms/ml, compared with 1 microgram/ml for vancomycin. against methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis mics ranged from 0.25 to 2 micrograms/ml, compared with 1 to 4 micrograms/ml for vancomycin and 4 to 16 micrograms/ml for teicoplanin. the spectrum of these new compounds included activity against teicoplanin-resistant, coagulase-negative staphylococci. the compounds exhibited exceptional potency against pathogenic streptococci, with mics of < or = 0.008 microgram/ml against streptococcus pneumoniae, including penicillin-resistant isolates. in in vivo studies with a mouse infection model, the median effective doses against a challenge by s. aureus, s. pneumoniae, or s. pyogenes were typically 4 to 20 times lower than those of vancomycin. overall, these new glycopeptides, such as ly307599 and ly333328, show promise for use as agents against resistant enterococci, methicillin-resistant s. aureus, and penicillin-resistant pneumococci.
unorthodox antibiotic combinations including ciprofloxacin against high-level gentamicin resistant enterococci.
development of high-level gentamicin resistance among enterococci represents a serious therapeutic problem as it precludes synergy between aminoglycosides and cell-wall active agents. as part of a search for active antibiotic combinations against enterococci with high-level gentamicin resistance, we tested by the time kill curve method the efficacy of ciprofloxacin combined with ampicillin, trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole, vancomycin or teicoplanin against ten isolates of enterococcus faecium, three of enterococcus casseliflavus and 13 of enterococcus faecalis that exhibited a mic of gentamicin > or = 2000 mg/l. most of the e. faecium were also resistant to ampicillin and to ciprofloxacin. the combination of ciprofloxacin with ampicillin was bactericidal against five of seven e. faecium strains that exhibited a ciprofloxacin mic < or = 4 mg/l, but was inactive against the three e. faecium that were highly resistant to ciprofloxacin. this combination was also bactericidal against the e. casseliflavus and all the e. faecalis strains. the combination of ciprofloxacin with trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole was bactericidal against five of the seven e. faecium and seven of the nine e. faecalis strains with a ciprofloxacin mic < or = 4 mg/l. no bactericidal activity of this combination was seen against the enterococci that were highly resistant to either ciprofloxacin or to trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole. the combination of ciprofloxacin with glycopeptides was inactive against e. faecium and e. casseliflavus and against e. faecalis, it was either ineffective or antagonistic; in only one case it was bactericidal. five strains of e. faecium were resistant to all antibiotic combinations tested.
characterization of bacteriocins from enterococcus faecium with activity against  listeria monocytogenes.
laboratory cultures and environmental isolates of bacteria were screened for antagonism towards listeria monocytogenes using an agar spot test. seven of the 163 strains that were tested, one streptococcus bovis, one enterococcus casseliflavus, two e. avium and three e. faecium, consistently displayed antilisterial activity. cell-free, ph-neutralized supernatants prepared from the three e. faecium strains (jbl1061, jbl1083 and jbl1351) exhibited strong antilisterial activity against l. monocytogenes, and were subjected to more detailed analyses. the antagonistic factors produced by these three strains were sensitive to chloroform and several proteolytic enzymes, resistant to heat (121 degrees c, 20 min), and stable over a wide ph range (3.0-10.0). moreover, they were listericidal without causing cell lysis. these data suggest that a bacteriocin(s) is involved in the inhibition of l. monocytogenes by e. faecium jbl1061, jbl1083 and jbl1351.
