TI  == a decrease of the butyrate-producing species roseburia hominis and faecalibacterium prausnitzii defines dysbiosis in patients with ulcerative colitis.
AB  == objective: bacteria play an important role in the onset and perpetuation of intestinal inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease (ibd). unlike in crohn's disease (cd), in which dysbiosis has been better characterised, in ulcerative colitis (uc), only small cohorts have been studied and showed conflicting data. therefore, we evaluated in a large cohort if the microbial signature described in cd is also present in uc, and if we could characterise predominant dysbiosis in uc. to assess the functional impact of dysbiosis, we quantified the bacterial metabolites. design: the predominant microbiota from 127 uc patients and 87 age and sex-matched controls was analysed using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) analysis. differences were quantitatively validated using  real-time pcr. metabolites were quantified using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. results: based on dgge analysis, the microbial signature previously described in cd was not present in uc. real-time pcr analysis revealed a lower abundance of roseburia hominis (p<0.0001) and faecalibacterium prausnitzii (p<0.0001) in uc patients compared to controls. both species showed an inverse correlation with disease activity. short-chain fatty acids (scfa) were reduced in uc patients (p=0.014), but no direct correlation between scfa and the identified  bacteria was found. conclusions: the composition of the fecal microbiota of uc patients differs from that of healthy individuals: we found a reduction in r hominis and f prausnitzii, both well-known butyrate-producing bacteria of the firmicutes phylum. these results underscore the importance of dysbiosis in ibd but suggest that different bacterial species contribute to the pathogenesis of uc and cd.

TI  == in vitro kinetics of prebiotic inulin-type fructan fermentation by butyrate-producing colon bacteria: implementation of online gas chromatography for quantitative analysis of carbon dioxide and hydrogen gas production.
AB  == kinetic analyses of bacterial growth, carbohydrate consumption, and metabolite production of five butyrate-producing clostridial cluster xiva colon bacteria grown on acetate plus fructose, oligofructose, inulin, or lactate were performed. a gas chromatography method was set up to assess h2 and co2 production online and to ensure complete coverage of all metabolites produced. method accuracy was confirmed through the calculation of electron and carbon recoveries. fermentations with anaerostipes caccae dsm 14662(t), roseburia faecis dsm 16840(t), roseburia hominis dsm 16839(t), and roseburia intestinalis dsm 14610(t) revealed similar patterns of metabolite production with butyrate, co2, and h2 as  the main metabolites. r. faecis dsm 16840(t) and r. intestinalis dsm 14610(t) were able to degrade oligofructose, displaying a nonpreferential breakdown mechanism. lactate consumption was only observed with a. caccae dsm 14662(t). roseburia inulinivorans dsm 16841(t) was the only strain included in the present  study that was able to grow on fructose, oligofructose, and inulin. the metabolites produced were lactate, butyrate, and co2, without h2 production, indicating an energy metabolism distinct from that of other roseburia species. oligofructose degradation was nonpreferential. in a coculture of r. inulinivorans dsm 16841(t) with the highly competitive strain bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum lmg 11047 on inulin, hardly any production of butyrate and co2 was detected, indicating a lack of competitiveness of the butyrate producer. complete recovery of metabolites during fermentations of clostridial cluster xiva butyrate-producing colon bacteria allowed stoichiometric balancing of the metabolic pathway for butyrate production, including h2 formation.
