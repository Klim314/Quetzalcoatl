TI  == comparison of oral microbiota in tumor and non-tumor tissues of patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma.
AB  == background: bacterial infections have been linked to malignancies due to their ability to induce chronic inflammation. we investigated the association of oral bacteria in oral squamous cell carcinoma (oscc/tumor) tissues and compared with adjacent non-tumor mucosa sampled 5 cm distant from the same patient (n = 10). by using culture-independent 16s rrna approaches, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) and cloning and sequencing, we assessed the total bacterial diversity in these clinical samples. results: dgge fingerprints showed  variations in the band intensity profiles within non-tumor and tumor tissues of the same patient and among the two groups. the clonal analysis indicated that from a total of 1200 sequences characterized, 80 bacterial species/phylotypes were detected representing six phyla, firmicutes, bacteroidetes, proteobacteria,  fusobacteria, actinobacteria and uncultivated tm7 in non-tumor and tumor libraries. in combined library, 12 classes, 16 order, 26 families and 40 genera were observed. bacterial species, streptococcus sp. oral taxon 058, peptostreptococcus stomatis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus gordonii, gemella haemolysans, gemella morbillorum, johnsonella ignava and streptococcus parasanguinis i were highly associated with tumor site where as granulicatella adiacens was prevalent at non-tumor site. streptococcus intermedius was present in 70% of both non-tumor and tumor sites. conclusions: the underlying changes in  the bacterial diversity in the oral mucosal tissues from non-tumor and tumor sites of oscc subjects indicated a shift in bacterial colonization. these most prevalent or unique bacterial species/phylotypes present in tumor tissues may be  associated with oscc and needs to be further investigated with a larger sample size.

TI  == prospective study of bacteremia and complications with eus fna of rectal and perirectal lesions.
AB  == background & aims: recent studies showed that endoscopic ultrasound (eus)-guided  fine-needle aspiration (fna) is a low-risk procedure for causing bacteremia and infectious complications when sampling solid lesions of the upper gastrointestinal (gi) tract. as a result, antibiotics are not recommended for prophylaxis against endocarditis. our aim was to prospectively evaluate the risk  of bacteremia and other infectious complications in patients undergoing eus fna of lower gi tract lesions. methods: patients referred for eus fna of lower gi tract lesions were considered for enrollment. patients were excluded if there was an indication for preprocedure antibiotic administration based on american society for gastrointestinal endoscopy guidelines, had taken antibiotics within the prior 7 days, or if they had a cystic lesion. blood cultures were obtained immediately before the procedure, after flexible sigmoidoscopy/radial eus, and 15 minutes after eus fna. results: one hundred patients underwent a total of 471 fnas (mean, 4.7 fnas/patient; range, 1-10 fnas/patient). blood cultures were positive in 6 patients. cultures from 4 patients (4.0%, 95% confidence interval,  1.6%-9.8%) grew coagulase-negative staphylococcus (n = 2), peptostreptococcus stomatis (n = 1), or moraxella (n = 1), which were considered contaminants. two patients (2.0%, 95% confidence interval, 0.6%-7%) developed bacteremia: bacteroides fragilis (n = 1) and gemella morbillorum (n = 1). no signs or symptoms of infection developed in any patient. conclusions: eus fna of solid lesions in the lower gi tract should be considered a low-risk procedure for infectious complications that does not warrant prophylactic administration of antibiotics for the prevention of bacterial endocarditis.
