TI  == a pilot study on the effect of lactobacillus casei zhang on intestinal microbiota parameters in chinese subjects of different age.
AB  == ageing of the population is an imminent global problem. lactobacillus casei zhang (lcz) was isolated from inner mongolian fermented milk, koumiss. lcz possesses numerous probiotic properties in in vitro tests and in animal models. however, it has never been tested in any human trial. in the current study, the impact of oral consumption of lcz on different age groups was tested. chinese subjects, including 10 young, 7 middle-aged and 7 elderly volunteers (with mean age of 24.3, 47.6 and 64.7, respectively), were recruited. each subject took 10.6 log10  cfu lcz daily for a continuous period of 28 days. several parameters, including the amounts of lcz and four selected groups of bacteria, change of bacterial diversity, short chain fatty acids (scfa) and total bile acids (tba), were monitored in faecal samples collected from the subjects before starting, during and after stopping oral lcz consumption. the consumption of lcz exhibited beneficial effects to the subjects by modulating faecal microbiota in a temporal  manner with a prolonged elevation of scfa and reduction of tba. the potentially harmful pseudomonas and acinetobacter genera were suppressed by the probiotic administration. furthermore, a moderately divergent response was observed in the  indigenous gut populations of bifidobacterium and bacteroides fragilis group in different age subjects. taken together, the current study has provided proof on the positive effect of probiotic consumption and crucial insights into the design and application of probiotic-based products to users of different age segments.

TI  == antibacterial action of chlorhexidine/thymol containing varnishes in vitro and in vivo.
AB  == objectives: the antibacterial activity of two different formulations of a chlorhexidine/thymol varnish should be elucidated in vitro and in vivo. methods:  the agar diffusion assay with cervitec((r)) and cervitecplus((r)) and three reference strains each of streptococci, lactobacilli, actinomyces and periodontal pathogens was performed. in a split-mouth study, 40 volunteers applied the test (cervitecplus((r)), solvent water and ethanol) and control (cervitec((r)), solvent ethyl acetate) varnish at buccal recessions of premolar teeth at baseline as well as after two, four and seven days. supra- and subgingival plaques were collected 2 weeks before baseline and at the screening appointments. supragingival plaque was analysed for mutans streptococci and lactobacilli and subgingival samples for aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis and porphyromonas intermedia. friedman/wilcoxon tests and u-test were used for statistical analysis (p < 0.05). results: most reference strains were susceptible with inhibition zones (mm) as follows: cervitec((r))/cervitecplus((r)) streptococci 27 +/- 1.7/21.3 +/- 2.5, lactobacilli 26 +/- 9.2/23.7 +/- 4.9, actinomyces 36.3 +/- 6.6/27.3 +/- 1.5, periodontal pathogens 18.7 +/- 7.6/18 +/- 1.7. both varnishes reduced significantly the counts of mutans streptococci and lactobacilli in the patients. however, no significant differences were found between test and control sides at  any time. the total counts of periodontal pathogens were low. a tendency to higher counts of a. actinomycetemcomitans at the control side could be shown; the test side did not harbour significantly higher counts. conclusion: both varnishes may influence the plaque formation and reduce mutans streptococci in supragingival plaque.

TI  == microbial colonization in orthodontic mini-implants.
AB  == peri-implant inflammation contributes for loss of secondary stability of orthodontic mini-implants. the investigation of microbial colonization in this area would benefit its control, and consequently favor the long-term success of mini-implants. therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the establishment and the evolution of microbial colonization process in orthodontic  mini-implants for 3 months, since the time of their installation. one-hundred and fifty samples collected from 15 mini-implants were investigated from baseline up  to 3 months. the biological material was obtained from peri-implant area using paper points. nonspecific, streptococcus spp, lactobacillus casei and candida spp colonizations were analyzed by cell growth methods. porphyromonas gingivalis colonization was observed by 16s rdna-directed polymerase chain reaction. data from cell growth were submitted to the wilcoxon sign rank test and results from molecular analysis were presented in a descriptive way. there was no significant  difference in the microbial colonization among the examined time intervals, except for streptococcus spp, between baseline and 24 h, which characterized the  initial colonization in this time interval. lactobacillus casei and candida spp colonizations were insignificant. no porphyromonas gingivalis was detected among  the analyzed samples. the microbial colonization of mini-implants did not significantly change during the study. however, it should be monitored by orthodontists, since it is an important factor for mini-implants success.

TI  == bacterial antagonism against periodontopathogens.
AB  == background: the aim of the current study is to compare the prevalence of commensal bacteria, with beneficial properties, for healthy and diseased individuals and additionally to examine the inhibitory effect of some commercial  dietary probiotics on periodontopathogens, comparing this inhibitory effect to that of orally derived beneficial bacteria. methods: subgingival plaque samples from 35 patients (healthy and periodontitis patients) were analyzed. growth inhibition of the periodontal pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans was examined using the agar overlay technique and agar well diffusion method. the quantification of the inhibitory effect was checked with the agar well diffusion  method. results: using the agar overlay technique, the prevalence of strains antagonistic toward p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, and f. nucleatum was found to be higher in healthy individuals than in individuals with periodontitis, but this could not be validated by the agar well diffusion assay. compared with the antagonistic activity of the isolated strains, the probiotic strains overall  showed a stronger inhibition of the periodontal pathogens. conclusion: it was shown that some oral bacteria can cause antagonism toward periodontopathogens, and these observations underline the therapeutic potential of applications that stimulate oral health by the application of beneficial effector strains.

TI  == using high throughput sequencing to explore the biodiversity in oral bacterial communities.
AB  == high throughput sequencing of 16s ribosomal rna gene amplicons is a cost-effective method for characterization of oral bacterial communities. however, before undertaking large-scale studies, it is necessary to understand the technique-associated limitations and intrinsic variability of the oral ecosystem. in this work we evaluated bias in species representation using an in vitro-assembled mock community of oral bacteria. we then characterized the bacterial communities in saliva and buccal mucosa of five healthy subjects to investigate the power of high throughput sequencing in revealing their diversity  and biogeography patterns. mock community analysis showed primer and dna isolation biases and an overestimation of diversity that was reduced after eliminating singleton operational taxonomic units (otus). sequencing of salivary  and mucosal communities found a total of 455 otus (0.3% dissimilarity) with only  78 of these present in all subjects. we demonstrate that this variability was partly the result of incomplete richness coverage even at great sequencing depths, and so comparing communities by their structure was more effective than comparisons based solely on membership. with respect to oral biogeography, we found inter-subject variability in community structure was lower than site differences between salivary and mucosal communities within subjects. these differences were evident at very low sequencing depths and were mostly caused by  the abundance of streptococcus mitis and gemella haemolysans in mucosa. in summary, we present an experimental and data analysis framework that will facilitate design and interpretation of pyrosequencing-based studies. despite challenges associated with this technique, we demonstrate its power for evaluation of oral diversity and biogeography patterns.

TI  == community-based interference against integration of pseudomonas aeruginosa into human salivary microbial biofilm.
AB  == as part of the human gastrointestinal tract, the oral cavity represents a complex biological system and harbors diverse bacterial species. unlike the gut microbiota, which is often considered a health asset, studies of the oral commensal microbiota have been largely limited to their implication in oral conditions such as dental caries and periodontal disease. less emphasis has been  given to their potential beneficial roles, especially the protective effects against oral colonization by foreign or pathogenic bacteria. in this study, we used salivary microbiota derived from healthy human subjects to investigate protective effects against colonization and integration of pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic bacterial pathogen, into developing or pre-formed salivary biofilms. when co-cultivated in saliva medium, p. aeruginosa persisted in the planktonic phase, but failed to integrate into the salivary microbial community during biofilm formation. furthermore, in saliva medium supplemented with sucrose, the oral microbiota inhibited the growth of p. aeruginosa by producing lactic acid. more interestingly, while pre-formed salivary biofilms were able to prevent p. aeruginosa colonization, the same biofilms recovered from mild chlorhexidine gluconate treatment displayed a shift in microbial composition and showed a drastic reduction in protection. our study indicates that normal oral communities with balanced microbial compositions could be important in effectively preventing the integration of foreign or pathogenic bacterial species, such as p. aeruginosa.

TI  == does strontium play a role in the cariostatic activity of glass ionomer? strontium diffusion and antibacterial activity.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this work was to evaluate the activity of strontium ions on the main pathogens of the oral flora. the leaching of strontium from resin modified glass ionomer cements (rmgic) was evaluated together with its uptake by  superficial dental enamel. methods: the antibacterial activity was measured by the growth inhibition method following exposure of supra- and sub-gingival bacteria to a range of strontium concentrations (0.19 moll(-1), 0.37 moll(-1), 0.74 moll(-1) and 1.11 moll(-1)). strontium concentrations were analyzed chemically and migration at 5 microm and 15 microm depths was quantified by microprobe following fuji ortho lc application on the vestibular enamel of extracted teeth. results: strontium was found in appreciable amounts (0.8 wt.%) in superficial enamel, but in insignificant concentrations deeper in. at the same time, 8% fluoroapatite was formed in the enamel. under our experimental conditions, strontium had no significant antibacterial activity; only one log reduction of activity was observed at the highest concentrations tested. conclusions: rmgic releases strontium ions which are rapidly exchanged for calcium ions in the superficial enamel. no significant antibacterial activity was observed for strontium ions alone at the concentrations considered. however synergistic effects with fluoride could promote antibacterial activity.

TI  == effects of sonicated prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum and lactobacillus casei extracts on interleukin-8 production by human dental pulp cells.
AB  == the objective of this study was to determine the effects of prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum and lactobacillus casei on the production of  il-8 by human dental pulp cells. human dental pulp cells from teeth of young patients (aged 18-25 years) were cultured and tested with sonicated p. intermedia atcc 25611, f. nucleatum atcc 25586 and l. casei atcc 4646 extracts. il-8 secreted into the culture supernatants were measured at 6, 12 and 24 hours using  a quantitative sandwich enzyme immunoassay technique. cell viability was evaluated using trypan blue exclusion technique. il-8 production by human dental  pulp cells increased significantly at 12 and 24 hours after exposure to p. intermedia and f. nucleatum, whereas l. casei extract exhibited low il-8 production. the sonicated bacterial extracts did not significantly affect viability or total number of dental pulp cells.

TI  == potentiation of the bactericidal activity of harungana madagascariensis lam. ex poir. (hypericaceae) leaf extract against oral bacteria using poly (d, l-lactide-co-glycolide) nanoparticles: in vitro study.
AB  == harungana madagascariensis lam. ex poir. (hypericaceae) is known to have biological properties with mainly antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral effects. the objective of this study was to investigate the in vitro bactericidal activity of the ethyl acetate h. madagascariensis leaf extract (hle) on the main  oral bacterial strains largely implicated in dental caries and gingivitis infections, and the possibility of potentialization of hle antibacterial effects  using the poly (d,l-lactide-co-glycolide) nanoparticles (plg-np). the microdilution technique and the interfacial polymer deposition following the solvent diffusion method were used to investigate the in vitro bactericidal activity of ethyl acetate hle and to prepare nanoparticles, respectively. hle showed significant bactericidal effects against the bacterial strains tested, with minimal bactericidal concentration (mbc) to 5 x 10(2) mg/l or less, except for lactobacillus casei with 7.5 x 10(2) mg/l. with the hle incorporated into plg nanoparticles (hle-plg-np), we observed diminution of the bactericidal concentration compared to hle, the upper mbc being of 1.875 x 10(2) mg/l. incorporation of the hle into a colloidal carrier optimized its antibacterial performance.

TI  == oral lactobacilli in chronic periodontitis and periodontal health: species composition and antimicrobial activity.
AB  == background/aims: lactobacilli are known to play an important role in the maintenance of health by stimulating natural immunity and contributing to the balance of microflora. however, their role in chronic periodontitis is unclear. we aimed to identify oral lactobacilli in chronic periodontitis and periodontally healthy subjects, and to determine their antimicrobial activity against putative  oral pathogens. methods: a total of 238 lactobacillus isolates from the saliva and subgingival sites of 20 chronic periodontitis and 15 healthy subjects were collected. in all, 115 strains were identified using rapid amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis. antimicrobial activity against streptococcus mutans, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia was assessed. results: lactobacilli belonging to 10 species were identified. the most prevalent strains in healthy persons were lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus fermentum and in chronic periodontitis patients, lactobacillus plantarum. obligately homofermentatives, particularly l. gasseri, were less prevalent in chronic periodontitis patients compared with healthy subjects (8% vs. 64% for l. gasseri, p < 0.01). sixty-nine percent of tested lactobacilli inhibited s. mutans, 88% a. actinomycetemcomitans, 82% p. gingivalis and 65% p. intermedia. the strongest antimicrobial activity was associated with lactobacillus paracasei, l. plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, and lactobacillus salivarius. the strains from periodontally healthy patients showed a lower antimicrobial activity against s. mutans than the strains from chronic periodontitis patients. conclusion: the composition of oral lactoflora in chronic periodontitis and healthy subjects differs, with a higher prevalence of homofermentative lactobacilli, particularly l. gasseri, in the latter group. both homo- and heterofermentative oral lactobacilli suppress the growth of periodontal pathogens, but the antimicrobial properties are strain, species and origin specific.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of croton cajucara benth linalool-rich essential oil on artificial biofilms and planktonic microorganisms.
AB  == we have previously demonstrated that a linalool-rich essential oil from croton cajucara benth presents leishmanicidal activity. in the present study, we demonstrate that this essential oil inhibits the growth of reference samples of candida albicans, lactobacillus casei, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus sobrinus, porphyromonas gingivalis and streptococcus mutans cell suspensions, all of them associated with oral cavity disease. the purified linalool fraction was only inhibitory for c. albicans. microbes of saliva specimens from human individuals with fixed orthodontic appliances, as well as the reference strains,  were used to construct an artificial biofilm which was exposed to linalool or to  the essential oil. as in microbial suspensions, the essential oil was toxic for all the microorganisms, while the purified linalool fraction mainly inhibited the growth of c. albicans. the compounds of the essential oil were separated by thin  layer chromatography and exposed to the above-cited microorganisms. in this analysis, the proliferation of the bacterial cells was inhibited by still uncharacterized molecules, and linalool was confirmed as the antifungal component of the essential oil. the effects of linalool on the cell biology of c. albicans  were evaluated by electron microscopy, which showed that linalool induced a reduction in cell size and abnormal germination. neither the crude essential oil  nor the purified linalool fraction is toxic to mammalian cells, which suggests that the essential oil or its purified components may be useful to control the microbial population in patients with fixed orthodontic appliances.

TI  == effectiveness of a triclosan/copolymer dentifrice on microbiological and inflammatory parameters.
AB  == according to the us surgeon general's report, "oral health in america," published in 2000, most adults in the united states show some degree of periodontal pathology, with severe periodontal diseases affecting about 14% of middle-aged adults. periodontal diseases are polymicrobial-induced inflammatory diseases, and they vary from mild gingival inflammation to severe deterioration of the periodontium, ie, loss of periodontal supportive tissues and, ultimately, tooth loss. new evidence shows that periodontal diseases may impact systemic health. for this reason, the maintenance of a healthy mouth is becoming increasingly important for the overall health of the body. this article summarizes laboratory  research conducted during the development of a novel, multibenefit, oral-care technology based on triclosan--a broad-spectrum antibacterial agent--and a polyvinylmethylether/maleic acid copolymer. this unique combination of agents is  found in colgate total, a clinically proven efficacious dentifrice for control of dental plaque and gingivitis. data are presented that demonstrate the unique antibacterial properties of this dentifrice: (1) a broad-spectrum antimicrobial profile; (2) the long-lasting retention of triclosan on hydroxyapatite and epithelial cells; and (3) molecular evidence of antibacterial activity against specific pathogens in clinical dental plaque. in addition, data are presented that demonstrate the anti-inflammatory effects of triclosan on specific cytokines, the interruption of inflammatory pathways, and the inhibition of bone  resorption. overall, these data support the multibenefit clinical effects of colgate total and suggest a plurality of mechanisms of action.

TI  == comparison of type 1 and type 2 cytokine production by mononuclear cells cultured with streptococcus mutans and selected other caries bacteria.
AB  == a feature of pulpal immune responses is the predominance of type 1 cytokine mrna  under shallow caries and a mixed (type 1/type 2) profile under deep caries. these results prompted an examination of the cytokine profiles induced by bacteria in shallow caries (streptococcus mutans and actinomyces viscosus) and deep caries (lactobacillus casei, pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, and prevotella intermedia). all isolates induced interferon-gamma and interleukin-10, whereas interleukin-4 and interleukin-2 titers were low to undetectable. s. mutans was the most potent  and persistent interferon-gamma inducer. differences in interleukin-10 were apparent at low doses but were less dramatic, with l. casei the dominant producer. s. mutans induced substantially more interferon-gamma than interleukin-10 over all doses and time points, suggesting strong type 1 polarization. p. alactolyticus induced significantly more interleukin-10 than interferon-gamma at higher concentrations, suggesting polarization toward type 2. a similar amount of interferon-gamma and interleukin-10 induced by l. casei, a. viscosus, and p. intermedia reflected a mixed profile. a better understanding of  pulpal immune response to caries bacteria may enable us to develop an immune system-based pulp therapy in the future.

TI  == antagonistic interactions among fusobacterium nucleatum and prevotella intermedia with oral lactobacilli.
AB  == microbiota residing in oral ecosystems show great complexity because of the mutual interdependence of certain microorganisms that might influence their presence or absence at a given site. the aim of this work was to evaluate possible antagonistic interactions among fusobacterium nucleatum and prevotella intermedia, isolated from periodontal pockets, and lactobacillus casei, l. salivarius, l. rhamnosus and l. plantarum isolated from saliva. different tests were carried out using each strain as an effector as well as a sensitive strain,  alternatively: (1) agar diffusion with paper disks embedded with supernatants and pellets in different culture media; (b) the well diffusion assay; (c) the double  layer method; and (d) od(560) measurements of the kinetic growth of lactobacillus strains in laptg broth with different volumes of f. nucleatum supernatant. p. intermedia supernatant did not have an inhibitory effect on lactobacillus growth, except for l. casei, when the double plaque method was used. f. nucleatum supernatant inhibited growth of all lactobacillus strains when the well diffusion method was used. f. nucleatum inhibited l. casei growth whatever the method used. the substance responsible for inhibition was a thermoresistant extracellular protein which was hydrolyzed by trypsin-like proteases. none of the species of lactobacilli studied inhibited the growth of p. intermedia or f. nucleatum.

TI  == an immunohistological study of the localization of bacteria invading root pulpal  walls of teeth with periapical lesions.
AB  == we immunohistologically examined the prevalence and localization of bacteria invading dentinal tubules of the roots of teeth with infected canals. forty extracted teeth with apical lesions were selected and divided into two groups: a  group of untreated teeth and a group of canal-enlarged teeth. the bacteria in the specimens were detected by brown-brenn stain and the labeled-streptavidin-biotin  method with specific antisera for 16-bacteria. seventy percent of the examined teeth showed bacteria invading the dentinal tubules of the roots. fusobacterium nucleatum, eubacterium alactolyticum, e. nodatum, lactobacillus casei, and peptostreptococcus micros were abundant. even in the canal-enlarged group, invasion of bacteria was observed in 65% of teeth. this study revealed the actual condition of bacteria in infected root dentin and suggested that the canal-enlargement procedure could not completely remove all the bacteria in the infected dentinal tubules of the root.

TI  == the effect of oral bacteria on candida albicans germ-tube formation.
AB  == a total of eight bacterial isolates belonging to six species, and a select group  of 12 oral candida albicans isolates, were used to study the effect of bacteria on germ-tube formation. briefly, each bacterial suspension (10(5-6) cells/ml) was mixed with a c. albicans suspension (10(7) cells/ml) and incubated at 37 degrees  c for 90 min with bovine serum, and the percentage germ-tube-positive candida cells was quantified using a haemocytometer, under light microscopy. in general,  out of eight bacteria, streptococcus sanguis sk21a, streptococcus salivarius sk56, escherichia coli atcc 25922, and s. salivarius obu3 suppressed germ-tube formation to varying degrees, with different c albicans isolates. porphyromonas gingivalis pg 50, lactobacillus casei atcc 7469 and prevotella intermedia obu4 elicited significant enhancement of germ-tube formation, whereas s. sanguis obu 2 had no effect. e. coli atcc 25922 was the only organism to show statistically significant suppression of germ-tube formation (p=0.0312). a significant increase in the germ tube production of c. albicans isolated from hiv-infected compared with hiv-free individuals was also noted. the current results tend to suggest that commensal and transient oral bacterial populations may selectively influence the differential expression of germ-tube-forming ability of c. albicans isolates.

TI  == antimicrobial activity and flow rate of newer and established root canal sealers.
AB  == endodontic sealers that possess both optimum flow ability and antimicrobial properties may theoretically assist in the elimination of microorganisms located  in confined areas of the root canal system. the antimicrobial effects and the flow rate of the following sealers were investigated and compared: kerr pulp canal sealer ewt, grossman's sealer, thermaseal, sealer 26, ah plus, and sealer plus. the agar diffusion test was used to assess the antimicrobial activity of the sealers. in the flow assay, the sealers were placed between two glass slabs and a weight of 500 g was placed on the top of the glass. the diameters of the formed discs were recorded. all root canal sealers tested showed some antimicrobial activity against most of the microorganisms. there were no significant differences between the materials tested (p > 0.05). all root canal sealers also flowed under the conditions of this study. statistical analysis of the results revealed that ah plus and kerr pulp canal sealer ewt had flow values  significantly superior to the other sealers tested (p > 0.05). taken together, these findings suggest that these sealers have the potential to help in the microbial control in the root canal system.

TI  == changes in the cultivable flora in deep carious lesions following a stepwise excavation procedure.
AB  == this study examined the cultivable microflora before and after stepwise excavation procedures in deep carious lesions in 9 permanent teeth, categorized according to degrees of proximal surface destruction. the final excavation was performed 4-6 months after the initial treatment, which included peripheral dentine excavation and removal of the central cariogenic biomass and the superficial necrotic dentine. dentine colour and consistency were assessed by means of standardized scales before the application of a ca(oh)(2) compound and temporary sealing. reassessments were performed before and after the final excavation. microbiological samples of the central demineralized dentine were obtained with a sterile bur before and after the first excavation, as well as before and after the final excavation. after anaerobic cultivation on enriched non-selective tryptic soy agar, 30 colonies from a representative area were identified by standardized biochemical and physiological tests. before temporary  restoration, a yellowish and light brown demineralized soft dentine was typically observed, and gram-positive rods accounted for 70% and lactobacilli for 50% of the total colony-forming units. lactobacillus casei subsp. rhamnosus and actinomyces naeslundii dominated the lactobacilli and the other gram-positive rods, respectively. gram-negative rods were the next most frequent isolates, followed by streptococci, each group accounting for about 20% of the colony-forming units in positive samples. before the final excavation, which did  not cause exposure of the pulp in any of the cases, the retained demineralized dentine had changed into a darker and harder tissue, and the total colony-forming units, as well as the frequency and proportions of lactobacilli were substantially reduced. gram-negative rods also declined, and the flora was dominated by a. naeslundii and various streptococci. in conclusion, the cultivable flora detected following the treatment interval had declined substantially, and the distribution of bacterial species did not represent a typical cariogenic microbiota of deep lesions, confirming the clinical findings of arrested caries progression.

TI  == the formation of mixed culture biofilms of oral species along a gradient of shear stress.
AB  == a chemostat mixed culture system was used to produce two distinct ecological states, state-1 (caries-like microcosm) and state-2 (periodontal-like microcosm). eleven bacterial species (streptococcus gordonii, strep. mitis i, strep. mutans,  strep. oralis, actinomyces naeslundii, lactobacillus casei, neisseria subflava, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella nigrescens, veillonella dispar) were used to inoculate the planktonic system. a flow cell, designed to produce convergent flow with increasing shear stress, was attached to the chemostat system, and the resultant biofilms developed from the state-1 and state-2 microcosms along the shear stress gradient were examined and compared using image analysis and viable counts. the biofilm produced from state-1 showed  a lower shear stress tolerance (0.146 pa) than the state-2 biofilm (0.236 pa). the biofilm compositions did not vary along the gradient of shear stress and were dependent on the initial inoculum conditions. gram-positive species were predominant in the state-1 biofilm, while gram-negative species were predominant  in state-2.

TI  == comparative antimicrobial activity of an essential oil and an amine fluoride/stannous fluoride mouthrinse in vitro.
AB  == although laboratory studies are not necessarily predictive of clinical activity;  they can help to elucidate mechanisms underlying clinical activity when the latter has been established. in a recent clinical study, an essential oil mouthrinse (listerine antiseptic) was shown to be significantly more effective than an amine fluoride/stannous fluoride mouthrinse (meridol) in inhibiting supragingival plaque formation. this paper reports the results of laboratory studies comparing the antimicrobial effectiveness of these 2 mouthrinses using a  kill kinetics assay and a plaque biofilm kill assay. in both assays, the essential oil mouthrinse was considerably more effective than the amine fluoride/stannous fluoride mouthrinse. these findings are consistent with the results of the clinical trial and may help to explain the observed differences in clinical activity.

TI  == acid tolerance response and survival by oral bacteria.
AB  == using 21 species of oral bacteria, representing six acidogenic genera, we undertook to determine whether the ph-limiting exponential growth is related to the ability of the organisms to generate an acid-tolerance response that results  in enhanced survival at low ph. the lower ph limit of exponential growth varied by more than two units with that of neisseria a182 at ph 6.34; growth of lactobacillus casei rb1014 stopped at ph 3.81, with species of actinomyces, enterococcus, prevotella and streptococcus falling between these limits. the working hypothesis was that the organisms with the higher ph limits for growth are unable to respond to acidic environments in order to survive, whereas the more aciduric organisms would possess or acquire acid tolerance. adaptation to acid tolerance was tested by determining whether the prior exposure of exponential-phase cells to a low, sub-lethal ph would trigger the induction of a  mechanism that would enhance survival at a ph killing ph 7.5 control cells. the killing ph varied from ph 4.5 for prevotella intermedia atcc 25611 to ph 2.3 for  the three lactobacillus casei strains in the study, with the three streptococcus  mutans strains killed at ph 3.0 for 3 h. the adaptation experiments revealed three groups of organisms: non-acid-responders, generally representing strains with the highest terminal ph values; weak acid-responders in the middle of the ph list, generating low numbers of survivors at one or two ph values, and the aciduric, strong responders generating a high number of survivors at ph values in the range 6.0 to 3.5, but not at ph 7.5. predominant among the latter group were  the s. mutans and lactobacilli casei strains, with the most significant adaptive  response exhibited by s. mutans lt11 and s. mutans ingbritt, involving a process  that required protein synthesis. time course experiments with the latter organisms indicated that 90-120 min was required after exposure to the triggering ph before the acid response was fully functional. these results indicate that the sudden exposure of strains of oral streptococci and lactobacilli, as well as enterococcus faecalis, to ph values between 6.0 and 3.5 results in the induction  of an acid tolerance response that enhances the survival of these strains at or below ph 3.5.

TI  == the effects of triclosan and zinc citrate, alone and in combination, on a community of oral bacteria grown in vitro.
AB  == a mixed-culture chemostat system has been used as a more stringent laboratory system for evaluation of the antimicrobial effects of triclosan and zinc citrate. the inhibitors were added alone, and in combination, as a pulse (a high initial inhibitor concentration which decreased with time) or as a dose (concentration of inhibitor increased with time) to give maximum concentrations of 34.5 mumol/l triclosan and 39.8 mumol/l zinc citrate. when dosed, triclosan inhibited a. viscosus and all five gram-negative species, whereas zinc citrate had less effect, probably due to complexation by media components. similar effects were seen when triclosan was pulsed, except that s. mutans was the most sensitive gram-positive species and v. dispar was unaffected. however, when the inhibitors  were dosed or pulsed in combination, marked complementary and additive inhibitory effects were observed, particularly against gram-negative species, although s. gordonii and s. oralis were relatively unaffected. the data confirm that increased effects can be obtained with suitable combinations of antimicrobial agents and suggest that, under certain conditions, apparently broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents may be acting more selectively than hitherto suspected.

AB  == mutans streptococci have been strongly implicated in the initiation of dental caries on coronal surfaces. their role in development of root-surface caries is less clear. the etiologic agents of both types of dental caries are likely to elicit systemic immune responses. the objective of the present study, therefore,  was to study the association of clinical variables of disease with humoral igg antibodies to nine oral micro-organisms in 314 adult subjects, aged 45-65 years,  who were at risk for root-surface caries. antibody activity to streptococcus mutans strain ingbritt, s. mutans/s. sobrinus gtfs, s. faecalis strain 19433, actinomyces viscosus strain wvu 626, actinomyces naeslundii strain 12, lactobacillus casei, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans strain y4, porphyromonas gingivalis strain 381, eikenella corrodens strain 1073, and wolinella recta strain 371 was measured by elisa. pearson correlation coefficients among log10 antibody levels within subjects revealed marked positive correlations among subgingival bacteria, generally weak positive correlations among supragingival micro-organisms, and no correlations between elements of the  supragingival battery with the subgingival battery. igg antibody levels to mutans streptococcal antigens were significantly correlated with subject dmf scores (r = 0.23; p less than 0.0001). no significant correlation was seen between dmf scores and antibody to any other supragingival micro-organism tested. further relationships between levels of s. mutans antibody and individual clinical variables were analyzed by step-wise multiple linear regression, resulting in a model that was highly significant (p = 0.0001), with an r2 = 0.14. numbers of missing teeth, coronal caries, root-surface caries, and root-surface restorations were each positively associated with antibody levels to mutans streptococci.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == modulation of human neutrophil adherence by oral bacteria.
AB  == polymorphonuclear neutrophils (pmns) comprise over 90 per cent of leukocytes in the oral cavity. although these phagocytic cells have primary defence roles in the gingiva, their stimulation by micro-organisms may also cause substantial tissue damage due to the release of lysosomal enzymes and oxygen radicals. adherence of pmns to the endothelium and their subsequent diapedesis and egress to areas of infection are considered early vital events in the inflammatory process. in this study, oral bacteria were screened to determine their direct effects on pmn activation using an in vitro method of measuring pmn adherence to  dacron fibres. most of the bacteria investigated increased pmn adherence, indicating their potential to cause tissue damage through the release of pmn lysosomal enzymes and other products. in contrast, bacteroides species suppressed pmns, indicating their ability to circumvent the phagocytic cells, thus gaining a potential advantage in dental colonization. the modulatory effects of oral bacteria on pmn activation may have significant roles in the immunopathogenesis of oral disease.

TI  == antibodies in normal and diseased pulps reactive with microorganisms isolated from deep caries.
AB  == immunoglobulin molecules in the supernatant fluids (sf) from pulpal explant cultures have been observed to react with microorganisms implicated in infections of root canals. in this study, the reactivity of immunoglobulin molecules in the  sf from normal and irreversible pulpitis pulps to six strains of predominant microorganisms isolated from the immediate layer of carious lesions above the pulps used for explant cultures was investigated using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. two atcc strains of eubacterium were also included in this assay. specific antibodies to lactobacillus casei subsp. casei, lactobacillus casei subsp. rhamnosus, lactobacillus acidophilus (i), (ii), streptococcus mutans, bacteroides intermedius, eubacterium brachy, and eubacterium alactolyticum in the sf from the normal and irreversible pulpitis tissues were observed with a large variation of antibody levels in both groups. immunodiffusion assays of the sf revealed that igg was the major class of immunoglobulin in the normal as well as the irreversible groups. the presence of  natural antibodies in the normal pulps suggested a possible protective role of antibodies during the invasive process of caries.

TI  == antimicrobial effect of a dental varnish, in vitro.
AB  == the effects of a polymer based antimicrobial releasing varnish cervitec were investigated against different gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains  as well as a yeast using the agar diffusion inhibitory test (adt-test in vitro).  as positive controls a 1% chlorhexidine gel and 1% aqueous solution of thymol and a placebo polymer varnish without active agents were employed. the test experimental varnish containing 1% chlorhexidine and 1% thymol showed antimicrobial activity against all gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms tested including one candida strain. the positive controls were similar in effect compared to the test varnish. no antimicrobial effect was observed with the placebo varnish without active ingredients. toothpicks and dental floss treated with the test varnish showed an antimicrobial effect against s. mutans even after storing in room temperature up to 12 months. the results from this study support  earlier laboratory studies that chlorhexidine and thymol diffuse out of the experimental varnish and that the varnish is active against various of oral pathogens. the possibility to use toothpicks or dental floss impregnated with the varnish with the aim to become chemotherapeutically active against periodontal diseases as well as against dental caries, is promising and should be tested in vivo.

TI  == a mixed-culture chemostat system to predict the effect of anti-microbial agents on the oral flora: preliminary studies using chlorhexidine.
AB  == a mixed-culture chemostat system, composed of nine bacterial species representative of plaque in health and disease, has been assessed as an improved  laboratory method of evaluating the likely in vivo effects of antimicrobial agents used in dentistry. the advantages of the system include reproducibility, the long-term stable cultivation of bacteria under controllable conditions, and repeated sampling, for bacteriological and biochemical studies, without disrupting the stability of the community. the effects of (i) the continuous provision of chlorhexidine (chx) and (ii) three pulses of chx (final concentration in both experiments = 0.24 mmol/l) on the composition of the chemostat communities were monitored. only l. casei survived the continuous provision of chx; the other bacteria were killed and were lost at different rates which generally corresponded to their known sensitivities to chx. after each chx  pulse, the numbers of bacteria fell markedly. again, l. casei was least affected, while a. viscosus, b. intermedius, and f. nucleatum were temporarily undetectable but returned to their original levels within 2-4 generation times. counts of s. mutans were affected more by chx than those of s. sanguis or s. mitior. the effect of successive pulses of chx on the viability of some bacteria and on acid  production (as measured by ph-fall experiments) decreased, suggesting that adaptation to chx had occurred. the fact that the in vitro observations paralleled previous clinical findings suggests that the mixed-culture system could be used as a predictive model of the probable effect on the oral flora of new anti-microbial agents prior to expensive trials in animals or human volunteers.

TI  == the effect of lowering the ph on the composition and metabolism of a community of nine oral bacteria grown in a chemostat.
AB  == nine oral bacteria, associated with both healthy and diseased sites in the mouth, were grown at d = 0.05 h-1 (mean generation time 13.9 h) in a glucose-limited chemostat. after an initial period of steady-state growth at ph 7.0, ph control was discontinued. the ph then decreased until it stabilized at ph 4.1 after 9 d (16 generations), while the eh rose from -165 mv to +160 mv. the lowering in ph resulted in the composition and metabolism of the flora being altered and in increased bacterial aggregation. at ph 7.0, 'streptococcus mitior', veillonella alcalescens and s. sanguis were most numerous while at ph 4.1 the counts of all bacteria fell except for lactobacillus casei, which became predominant. the proportions of s. mutans within the community also increased while s. sanguis was recovered only occasionally and bacteroides intermedius was not detected below ph 4.6. the survival at ph 4.1 of several other species would not have been predicted from earlier pure culture studies. relative to ph 7.0, the community growing at ph 4.1 produced more lactic acid, washed cells had a greater glycolytic activity over a wider ph range but amino acid metabolism decreased. in general, when ph control was restored, so were the original patterns of metabolism and bacterial counts, except for b. intermedius, which was still not detected. the inverse relationship between s. sanguis and s. mutans, and the increase in proportions of l. casei and s. mutans during growth in a low ph environment parallel observations made in vivo and suggest that the chemostat can be used as a model for microbial behaviour in dental plaque.

TI  == the establishment of reproducible, complex communities of oral bacteria in the chemostat using defined inocula.
AB  == nine commonly isolated oral bacterial populations were inoculated into a glucose-limited and a glucose-excess (amino acid-limited) chemostat maintained at a constant ph 7.0 and a mean community generation time of 13.9 h. the bacterial populations were streptococcus mutans atcc 2-27351, strep. sanguis nctc 7865, strep. mitior ef 186, actinomyces viscosus wvu 627, lactobacillus casei ac 413, neisseria sp. a1078, veillonella alkalescens atcc 17745, bacteroides intermedius  t 588 and fusobacterium nucleatum nctc 10593. all nine populations became established in the glucose-limited chemostat although strep. sanguis and neisseria sp. were present only after a second and third inoculation, respectively. in contrast, even following repeated inoculations, strep. mutans, b. intermedius and neisseria sp. could not be maintained under glucose-excess conditions. a more extensive pattern of fermentation products and amino acid catabolism occurred under glucose-limited growth; this simultaneous utilization of mixed substrates also contributed to the higher yields (y molar glucose) and greater species diversity of these communities. microscopic and biochemical evidence suggested that cell-to-cell interactions and food chains were occurring  among community members. to compare the reproductibility of this system, communities were established on three occasions under glucose-limitation and twice under glucose-excess conditions. the bacterial composition of the steady-state communities and their metabolic behaviour were similar when grown under identical conditions but varied in a consistent manner according to the nutrient responsible for limiting growth. although a direct simulation of the oral cavity was not attempted, the results show that the chemostat could be used  as an environmentally-related model to grow complex but reproducible communities  of oral bacteria for long periods from a defined inoculum.

TI  == dental pulp response to bacterial cell wall material.
AB  == lipopolysaccharides (lps) from bacteroides oralis and veillonella parvula and cell wall material from lactobacillus casei were studied for their capacity to induce leukocyte migration in the dental pulp and in an implanted wound chamber.  three adult monkeys were challenged using lyophilized material sealed into buccal class v cavities prepared in dentin. pulp tissue responses were observed histologically eight and 72 hours after initiation of the experiment. subjacent to cut dentinal tubules, bacterial materials induced polymorphonuclear leukocyte  (pmn's) infiltration in the pulp tissue of the majority of test teeth examined. responses were similar for the three bacterial test materials at both time periods. topical applications of bovine serum albumin (bsa), used as a control, induced significantly less accumulation of pmn's. assessments of induced exudate  volumes and leukocyte densities in chambers implanted in rats showed comparable rankings with pulpal experiment between test (i.e., bacterial) and control (bsa)  materials. analysis of the data indicates that high-molecular-weight complexes of bacterial cell walls may adversely affect pulpal tissue across freshly exposed dentin.
