TI  == an antibacterial ortho-quinone diterpenoid and its derivatives from caryopteris mongolica.
AB  == to identify antibacterial components in traditional mongolian medicinal plant caryopteris mongolica, an ortho-quinone abietane caryopteron a (1) and three its  derivatives caryopteron b-d (2-4) were isolated from the roots of the plant together with three known abietanes demethylcryptojaponol (5), 6alpha-hydroxydemethyl cryptojaponol (6), and 14-deoxycoleon u (7). the chemical  structures of these abietane derivatives were elucidated on the basis of spectroscopic data. compounds 1-4 had c-13 methylcyclopropane substructures, and  2-4 had a hexanedioic anhydride ring c instead of ortho-quinone in 1. the stereochemistry of these compound was assumed from noe spectra and ecd cotton effects. compounds 1 and 5-7 showed antibacterial activities against the gram-positive bacteria staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, and micrococcus luteus, being 1 the more potent.

TI  == antimicrobial peptides expressed in medicinal maggots of the blow fly lucilia sericata show combinatorial activity against bacteria.
AB  == the larvae of the common green bottle fly (lucilia sericata) produce antibacterial secretions that have a therapeutic effect on chronic and nonhealing wounds. recent developments in insect biotechnology have made it possible to use  these larvae as a source of novel anti-infectives. here, we report the application of next-generation rna sequencing (rna-seq) to characterize the transcriptomes of the larval glands, crop, and gut, which contribute to the synthesis of antimicrobial peptides (amps) and proteins secreted into wounds. our data confirm that l. sericata larvae have adapted in order to colonize microbially contaminated habitats, such as carrion and necrotic wounds, and are protected against infection by a diverse spectrum of amps. l. sericata amps include not only lucifensin and lucimycin but also novel attacins, cecropins, diptericins, proline-rich peptides, and sarcotoxins. we identified 47 genes encoding putative amps and produced 23 as synthetic analogs, among which some displayed activities against a broad spectrum of microbial pathogens, including pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus vulgaris, and enterococcus faecalis. against escherichia coli (gram negative) and micrococcus luteus (gram positive), we found mostly additive effects but also synergistic activity when selected amps were tested in combination. the amps that are easy to synthesize are currently being produced in bulk to allow their evaluation as novel anti-infectives that can be formulated in hydrogels to produce therapeutic wound dressings and adhesive bandages.

TI  == isolation and identification of symbiotic bacteria from the skin, mouth, and rectum of wild and captive tree shrews.
AB  == endosymbionts influence many aspects of their hosts' health conditions, including physiology, development, immunity, metabolism, etc. tree shrews (tupaia belangeri chinensis) have attracted increasing attention in modeling human diseases and therapeutic responses due to their close relationship with primates. to clarify the situation of symbiotic bacteria from their body surface, oral cavity, and anus, 12 wild and 12 the third generation of captive tree shrews were examined. based on morphological and cultural characteristics, physiological and biochemical tests, as well as the 16s rdna full sequence analysis, 12 bacteria strains were isolated and identified from the wild tree shrews: body surface: bacillus subtilis (detection rate 42%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (25%), staphlococcus aureus (33%), s. epidermidis (75%), micrococcus luteus (25%), kurthia gibsonii (17%); oral cavity: neisseria mucosa (58%), streptococcus pneumonia (17%); anus: enterococcus faecalis (17%), lactococus lactis (33%), escherichia coli (92%), salmonella typhosa (17%); whereas, four were indentified  from the third generation captive tree shrews: body surface: s. epidermidis (75%); oral cavity: n.mucosa (67%); anus: l. lactis (33%), e. coli (100%). these  results indicate that s. epidermidis, n. mucosa, l. lactis and e. coli were major bacteria in tree shrews, whereas, s. aureus, m. luteus, k. gibsonii, e. faecalis  and s. typhosa were species-specific flora. this study facilitates the future use of tree shrews as a standard experimental animal and improves our understanding of the relationship between endosymbionts and their hosts.

TI  == nitric oxide levels regulate the immune response of drosophila melanogaster reference laboratory strains to bacterial infections.
AB  == studies on the innate immune response against microbial infections in drosophila  melanogaster involve mutant strains and their reference strains that act as experimental controls. we used five standard d. melanogaster laboratory reference strains (oregon r, w1118, canton-s, cinnabar brown, and yellow white [yw]) and investigated their response against two pathogenic bacteria (photorhabdus luminescens and enterococcus faecalis) and two nonpathogenic bacteria (escherichia coli and micrococcus luteus). we detected high sensitivity among yw  flies to bacterial infections and increased bacterial growth compared to the other strains. we also found variation in the transcription of certain antimicrobial peptide genes among strains, with oregon and yw infected flies showing the highest and lowest gene transcription levels in most cases. we show that oregon and w1118 flies possess more circulating hemocytes and higher levels  of phenoloxidase activity than the other strains upon infection with the nonpathogenic bacteria. we further observed reduced fat accumulation in yw flies  infected with the pathogenic bacteria, which suggests a possible decline in physiological condition. finally, we found that nitrite levels are significantly  lower in infected and uninfected yw flies compared to w1118 flies and that nitric oxide synthase mutant flies in yw background are more susceptible to bacterial infection compared to mutants in w1118 background. therefore, increased sensitivity of yw flies to bacterial infections can be partly attributed to lower levels of nitric oxide. such studies will significantly contribute toward a better understanding of the genetic variation between d. melanogaster reference strains.

TI  == influence of acetylation degree and molecular weight of homogeneous chitosans on  antibacterial and antifungal activities.
AB  == the results given in the literature are conflicting when considering the relationship between antimicrobial activity and chitosan characteristics. to be able to clarify, we prepared fifteen homogeneous chitosans with different acetylation degrees (da) and molecular weights (mw) by reacetylation of a fully deacetylated chitin under homogeneous conditions. they were tested at different ph values for their antimicrobial activities against four gram-negative bacteria  (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae and salmonella typhi), four gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis and micrococcus luteus) and three fungi (aspergillus niger, fusarium oxysporum and alternaria solani). chitosans markedly inhibited growth of most bacteria and fungi tested, although the inhibitory effect depends on the type of microorganism and on the chitosan characteristics (da and mw) with minimum inhibitory concentrations in the range of 0.001 to 0.1 w%. considering chitosan efficiency on bacteria, our series of data clearly show that the lower da and the lower ph give the larger efficiency. antibacterial activity was further enhanced for gram-negative bacteria with decreasing mw, whereas, opposite effect was observed with the gram-positive. concerning the antifungal activity, the influence of chitosan characteristics was dependent on the particular type of fungus. fungal growth decreased with increasing mw for f. oxysporum and decreasing da for a. solani, but no mw or da dependences were observed with a. niger.

TI  == antibacterial activity of resin rich plant extracts.
AB  == background: the in vitro antibacterial activity of resin rich methanolic extracts (rrmes) of commiphora myrrha, operculina turpethum, and pinus roxburghii. materials and methods: different concentration were studied by agar-well diffusion method against gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, micrococcus luteus, enterococcus faecalis) and gram-negative bacterial strains (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhi, shigella dysenteriae). results: among all the bacterial strains tested, e. faecalis was most sensitive and s. typhi was resistant to c. myrrha and p. roxburghii. the extracts of o. turpethum were active against all tested strains in which b. subtilis and s. aureus were the most sensitive. conclusion: this suggested that the antibacterial activity of rrmes of o. turpethum was more than c. myrrha and p. roxburghii. this probably explains the potential of these plants against a number of infections caused by bacterial strains tested.

TI  == chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of essential oil of different parts of seseli rigidum.
AB  == the chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oil of the balkan endemic species seseli rigidum waldst. & kit. (apiaceae) was investigated. the monoterpene alpha-pinene was predominant in the volatile oil from aerial parts (57.4%) and fruit (23.3%). in the essential oil of the aerial parts limonene (6.7%), camphene (5.8%) and sabinene (5.5%) were also present in high amounts, and in the fruit oil, beta-phellandrene (17.4%) and sabinene (12.9%). on the contrary, the root essential oil was composed almost entirely of the polyacetylene falcarinol (88.8%). the antimicrobial activity of the root essential oil was significant against staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, micrococcus luteus and enterococcus faecalis (mics 6.25-25.00 microg/ml). volatile constituents from the root strongly inhibited the growth of methicillin-resistant strains of s. aureus (mics 6.25-50.00 microg/ml). anti-staphylococcal activity can be attributed to the main volatile constituent ofs. rigidum root, falcarinol.

TI  == antibacterial effect of phosphates and polyphosphates with different chain length.
AB  == the aim of this study was to monitor the antibacterial effect of seven phosphate  salts on selected strains of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, which could be considered responsible for food-borne diseases (bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, enterococcus faecalis, micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus, citrobacter freundii, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, salmonella enterica ser. enteritidis and pseudomonas aeruginosa). for these purposes, phosphates differing in chain length were used. the tested concentrations were in the range of 0.1-2.0% (wt v(-1)) applied at the model conditions. in the majority of cases the visible inhibitory effect on the growth of observed microorganisms could be seen. due to the chemical structure of salts and their dissociation both the ph values of cultivation broth and similarly the growth characteristics of bacterial strains were affected. the inhibition of above mentioned bacteria was apparently supported by this dissociation. phosphates obviously made the development of most gram-positive bacteria impossible. especially micrococcus luteus was extremely sensitive to the presence of these substances. on the other  hand, gram-negative bacteria seemed to be resistant to the phosphate incidence. the exemption clause from the tested salts was represented by a high alkaline trisodium phosphate. it should be pointed out that generally the most significant antibacterial effects were shown by polyphosphates hexa68 and hexa70, trisodium phosphate undecahydrate, tetrasodium pyrophosphate and finally trisodium phosphate. by comparing the inhibitory effects of various phosphate salts can be  concluded that the antibacterial activity was not determined only by the condensation degree but there was also proved the dependence on ph values.

TI  == relative roles of the cellular and humoral responses in the drosophila host defense against three gram-positive bacterial infections.
AB  == background: two nf-kappab signaling pathways, toll and immune deficiency (imd), are required for survival to bacterial infections in drosophila. in response to septic injury, these pathways mediate rapid transcriptional activation of distinct sets of effector molecules, including antimicrobial peptides, which are  important components of a humoral defense response. however, it is less clear to  what extent macrophage-like hemocytes contribute to host defense. methodology/principal findings: in order to dissect the relative importance of humoral and cellular defenses after septic injury with three different gram-positive bacteria (micrococcus luteus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus), we used latex bead pre-injection to ablate macrophage function in flies  wildtype or mutant for various toll and imd pathway components. we found that in  all three infection models a compromised phagocytic system impaired fly survival--independently of concomitant toll or imd pathway activation. our data failed to confirm a role of the pgrp-sa and gnbp1 pattern recognition receptors for phagocytosis of s. aureus. the drosophila scavenger receptor eater mediates the phagocytosis by hemocytes or s2 cells of e. faecalis and s. aureus, but not of m. luteus. in the case of m. luteus and e. faecalis, but not s. aureus, decreased survival due to defective phagocytosis could be compensated for by genetically enhancing the humoral immune response. conclusions/significance: our  results underscore the fundamental importance of both cellular and humoral mechanisms in drosophila immunity and shed light on the balance between these two arms of host defense depending on the invading pathogen.

TI  == lycopersicon esculentum seeds: an industrial byproduct as an antimicrobial agent.
AB  == lycopersicon esculentum (tomato) fruit is a widely studied matrix. however, only  few works focus their attention on its seeds, which constitute a major byproduct  of the tomato processing industry. in this study the antimicrobial potential of ten different tomato seed extracts from "bull's heart" and "cherry" varieties were analyzed against gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, micrococcus luteus, enterococcus faecalis and bacillus cereus) and gram-negative (proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella typhimurium) bacteria and fungi (candida albicans, aspergillus fumigatus and trichophyton rubrum). regarding antibacterial capacity, the different extracts were revealed to be active only against gram-positive bacteria, e. faecalis being the most susceptible one (mic: 2.5-10 mg/ml). concerning antifungal activity, "bull's heart" extracts were the most active. in  a general way c. albicans was the most susceptible species (mic: 5-10 mg/ml). the chemical composition of the extracts was also pursued, concerning organic acids,  phenolics and fatty acids, in order to establish a possible relationship with the observed antimicrobial effect.

TI  == survival of campylobacter jejuni under conditions of atmospheric oxygen tension with the support of pseudomonas spp.
AB  == campylobacter jejuni is a major food-borne pathogen. despite causing enteritis in humans, it is a well-adapted intestinal microorganism in animals, hardly ever generating disease symptoms. nevertheless, as a true microaerophilic microorganism it is still puzzling how campylobacter cells can survive on chicken meat, the main source of human infection. in this study, we demonstrate that c. jejuni is able to withstand conditions of atmospheric oxygen tension when cocultured with pseudomonas species, major food-spoiling bacteria that are frequently found on chicken meat in rather high numbers. using an in vitro survival assay, interactions of 145 c. jejuni wild-type strains and field isolates from chicken meat, broiler feces, and human clinical samples with type strains and food isolates of pseudomonas spp., proteus mirabilis, citrobacter freundii, micrococcus luteus, and enterococcus faecalis were studied. when inoculated alone or in coculture with proteus mirabilis, citrobacter freundii, micrococcus luteus, or enterococcus faecalis type strains, campylobacter cells were able to survive ambient oxygen levels for no more than 18 h. in contrast, campylobacter bacteria inoculated with type strains or wild-type isolates of pseudomonas showed a prolonged aerobic survival of up to >48 h. this microbial commensalism was diverse in c. jejuni isolates from different sources; isolates from chicken meat and humans in coculture with pseudomonas putida were able to use this survival support better than fecal isolates from broilers. scanning electron microscopy revealed the development of fiberlike structures braiding p.  putida and c. jejuni cells. hence, it seems that microaerophilic c. jejuni is able to survive ambient atmospheric oxygen tension by metabolic commensalism with pseudomonas spp. this bacterium-bacterium interaction might set the basis for survival of c. jejuni on chicken meat and thus be the prerequisite step in the pathway toward human infection.

TI  == linum usitatissimum (linseed/flaxseed) fixed oil: antimicrobial activity and efficacy in bovine mastitis.
AB  == purpose: in vitro antimicrobial activity and in vivo therapeutic efficacy of l. usitatissimum (linseed/flaxseed) fixed oil in bovine mastitis were investigated.  method: in vitro antimicrobial activity of l. usitatissimum fixed oil was evaluated against a number of microorganisms by disc diffusion method and mic determination. the in vivo efficacy of the oil was evaluated in nine mastitis-affected cows divided into three groups (three in each group), following once-a-day intramammary infusion of oil, cefoperazone or an oil-cefoperazone combination for 7 days and by monitoring the california mastitis test score, somatic cell count and microbial count in milk samples. results: the in vitro antimicrobial activity of the oil against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae and escherichia coli was comparable to that of cefoperazone while the  antimicrobial activity against enterococcus faecalis, micrococcus luteus and candida albicans, was greater than that of cefoperazone. in the in vivo study, the oil exhibited significant reduction in the california mastitis test score and somatic cell count in milk samples from infected udders following 7 days of intramammary administration suggesting its anti-inflammatory effect. the microbial count in milk samples was also reduced significantly following oil treatment. the effects were comparable to the treatment by cefoperazone (mastiwock) alone or in combination with the oil. apparently, the anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties of the oil contribute to its therapeutic efficacy in mastitis; the oil could be used as an alternative treatment for bovine mastitis conclusion: the results suggest possible therapeutic potential of l. usitatissimum fixed oil in bovine mastitis.

TI  == leptoglycin: a new glycine/leucine-rich antimicrobial peptide isolated from the skin secretion of the south american frog leptodactylus pentadactylus (leptodactylidae).
AB  == antimicrobial peptides are components of innate immunity that is the first-line defense against invading pathogens for a wide range of organisms. here, we describe the isolation, biological characterization and amino acid sequencing of  a novel neutral glycine/leucine-rich antimicrobial peptide from skin secretion of leptodactylus pentadactylus named leptoglycin. the amino acid sequence of the peptide purified by rp-hplc (c(18) column) was deduced by mass spectrometric de novo sequencing and confirmed by edman degradation: gllggllgpllgggggggggll. leptoglycin was able to inhibit the growth of gram-negative bacteria pseudomonas  aeruginosa, escherichia coli and citrobacter freundii with minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of 8 microm, 50 microm, and 75 microm respectively, but it  did not show antimicrobial activity against gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, micrococcus luteus and enterococcus faecalis), yeasts (candida albicans and candida tropicalis) and dermatophytes fungi (microsporum canis and trichophyton rubrum). no hemolytic activity was observed at the 2-200 microm range concentration. the amino acid sequence of leptoglycin with high level of glycine (59.1%) and leucine (36.4%) containing an unusual central proline suggests the existence of a new class of gly/leu-rich antimicrobial peptides. taken together, these results suggest that this natural antimicrobial peptide could be a tool to develop new antibiotics.

TI  == compound-specific nitrogen isotope analysis of d-alanine, l-alanine, and valine:  application of diastereomer separation to delta15n and microbial peptidoglycan studies.
AB  == we have developed an analytical method to determine the compound-specific nitrogen isotope compositions of individual amino acid enantiomers using gas chromatography/combustion/isotope ratio mass spectrometry. a novel derivatization of amino acid diastereomers by optically active (r)-(-)-2-butanol or (s)-(+)-2-butanol offers two advantages for nitrogen isotope analysis. first, chromatographic chiral separation can be achieved without the use of chiral stationary-phase columns. second, the elution order of these compounds on the chromatogram can be switched by a designated esterification reaction. we applied  the method to the compound-specific nitrogen isotope analysis of d- and l-alanine in a peptidoglycan derived from the cell walls of cultured bacteria (firmicutes and actinobacteria; enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus  staphylolyticus, lactobacillus acidophilus, bacillus subtilis, micrococcus luteus, and streptomyces sp.), natural whole bacterial cells (bacillus subtilis var. natto), (pseudo)-peptidoglycan from archaea (methanobacterium sp.), and cell wall from eukaryota (saccharomyces cerevisiae). we observed statistically significant differences in nitrogen isotopic compositions; e.g., delta15n ( per thousand vs air) in staphylococcus staphylolyticus for d-alanine (19.2 +/- 0.5 per thousand, n = 4) and l-alanine (21.3 +/- 0.8 per thousand, n = 4) and in bacillus subtilis for d-alanine (6.2 +/- 0.2 per thousand, n = 3) and l-alanine (8.2 +/- 0.4 per thousand, n = 3). these results suggest that enzymatic reaction  pathways, including the alanine racemase reaction, produce a nitrogen isotopic difference in amino acid enantiomers, resulting in 15n-depleted d-alanine. this method is expected to facilitate compound-specific nitrogen isotope studies of amino acid stereoisomers.

TI  == drosophila immunity: a large-scale in vivo rnai screen identifies five serine proteases required for toll activation.
AB  == unlike mammalian toll-like receptors, the drosophila toll receptor does not interact directly with microbial determinants but is rather activated upon binding a cleaved form of the cytokine-like molecule spatzle (spz). during the immune response, spz is thought to be processed by secreted serine proteases (sps) present in the hemolymph that are activated by the recognition of gram-positive bacteria or fungi . in the present study, we have used an in vivo rnai strategy to inactivate 75 distinct drosophila sp genes. we then screened this collection for sps regulating the activation of the toll pathway by gram-positive bacteria. here, we report the identification of five novel sps that function in an extracellular pathway linking the recognition proteins gnbp1 and pgrp-sa to spz. interestingly, four of these genes are also required for toll activation by fungi, while one is specifically associated with signaling in response to gram-positive bacterial infections. these results demonstrate the existence of a common cascade of sps upstream of spz, integrating signals sent by various secreted recognition molecules via more specialized sps.

TI  == chemical compositions and antimicrobial activities of four different anatolian propolis samples.
AB  == propolis means a gum that is gathered by bees from various plants. it is known for its biological properties, having antibacterial, antifungal and healing properties. the aims of this study were to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of four different anatolian propolis samples on different groups of microorganisms including some oral pathogens and comparison between their chemical compositions. ethanol extracts of propolis (eep) were prepared from four different anatolian propolis samples and examined whether eep inhibit the growth of the test microorganisms or not. for the antimicrobial activity assays, minimum inhibitory  concentrations (mic) were determined by using macrodilution method. the mic values of the most effective propolis (tb) were 2 microg/ml for streptococcus sobrinus and enterococcus faecalis, 4 microg/ml for micrococcus luteus, candida albicans and c. krusei, 8 microg/ml for streptococcus mutans, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and enterobacter aerogenes, 16 microg/ml for escherichia coli and c. tropicalis and 32 microg/ml for salmonella typhimurium and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the chemical compositions of eep's were determined by high-temperature high-resolution gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. the main compounds of four anatolian propolis samples were flavonoids such as pinocembrin, pinostropin, isalpinin, pinobanksin, quercetin, naringenin, galangine and chrysin. although propolis samples were collected from different regions of anatolia all showed significant antimicrobial activity against the gram positive bacteria and yeasts. propolis can prevent dental caries since it demonstrated significant antimicrobial activity against the microorganisms such as streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus and c. albicans, which involves in oral diseases.

TI  == cyclic dipeptides exhibit synergistic, broad spectrum antimicrobial effects and have anti-mutagenic properties.
AB  == cyclic dipeptides are known to have antiviral, antibiotic and antitumour properties. the aim of this study was to determine the combined effects of cyclo(l-leucyl-l-prolyl) and cyclo(l-phenylalanyl-l-prolyl) on the growth of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) and pathogenic yeasts, as well as determining their anti-mutagenic effects. this drug combination was especially effective against five vre strains: enterococcus faecium (k-99-38), e. faecalis (k-99-17), e. faecalis (k-99-258), e. faecium (k-01-312) and e. faecalis (k-01-511) with mic values of 0.25-1 mg/l. it was also effective against escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, micrococcus luteus, candida albicans and cryptococcus neoformans with mic values of 0.25-0.5 mg/l. in addition, the cyclic dipeptides exerted anti-mutagenic activity against salmonella typhimurium ta98 and ta100 strains in a salmonella mutation assay. the number of mutant colonies of s. typhimurium strains ta98 and ta100 induced by exposure to af-2 (0.2 microg/plate) decreased in a concentration-dependent manner in the presence of the two cyclic dipeptides (correlation 0.72 and 0.78, respectively). here, for the first time, we report synergistic effects of the cyclic dipeptides [cyclo(l-leu-l-pro) and cyclo(l-phe-l-pro)] in inhibiting the growth of pathogenic microorganisms, as well as their anti-mutagenic effects in salmonella  strains.

TI  == biological activity of five antibacterial flavonoids from combretum erythrophyllum (combretaceae).
AB  == preliminary studies with combretum erythrophyllum showed antimicrobial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. seven antibacterial flavonoids  were subsequently isolated by bioassay-guided fractionation, i.e. apigenin; genkwanin; 5-hydroxy-7,4'-dimethoxyflavone, rhamnocitrin; kaempferol; quercetin-5,3'-dimethylether; rhamnazin. all compounds had good activity against  vibrio cholerae and enterococcus faecalis, with mic values in the range of 25-50  microg/ml. rhamnocitrin and quercetin-5,3'-dimethylether also inhibited micrococcus luteus and shigella sonei at 25 microg/ml. with the exception of 5-hydroxy-7,4'-dimethoxy-flavone the flavonoids were not toxic towards human lymphocytes. this compound is potentially toxic to human cells and exhibited the  poorest antioxidant activity whereas rhamnocitrin and rhamnazin exhibited strong  antioxidant activity. genkwanin; rhamnocitrin; quercetin-5,3'-dimethylether; rhamnazin had a higher anti-inflammatory activity than the positive control mefenamic acid. although these flavonoids are known, this is the first report of  biological activity with several of these compounds.

TI  == antibacterial activity and mechanism of action of tick defensin against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == defensins are a major group of antimicrobial peptides and are found widely in vertebrates, invertebrates and plants. invertebrate defensins have been identified from insects, scorpions, mussels and ticks. in this study, chemically  synthesized tick defensin was used to further investigate the activity spectrum and mode of action of natural tick defensin. synthetic tick defensin showed antibacterial activity against many gram-positive bacteria but not gram-negative  bacteria and low hemolytic activity, characteristic of invertebrate defensins. furthermore, bactericidal activity against pathogenic gram-positive bacteria including bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus was observed. however, more than 30 min was necessary for tick defensin to completely kill bacteria. the interaction of tick defensin with  the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane and its ability to disrupt the membrane potential was analyzed. tick defensin was able to disrupt the membrane potential  over a period of 30-60 min consistent with its relatively slow killing. transmission electron microscopy of micrococcus luteus treated with tick defensin showed lysis of the cytoplasmic membrane and leakage of cellular cytoplasmic contents. these findings suggest that the primary mechanism of action of tick defensin is bacterial cytoplasmic membrane lysis. in addition, incomplete cell division with multiple cross-wall formation was occasionally seen in tick defensin-treated bacteria showing pleiotropic secondary effects of tick defensin.

TI  == the antibacterial activity of topical retinoids: the case of retinaldehyde.
AB  == background: retinoids such as retinoic acid (ra), retinol (rol) and retinaldehyde (ral) are currently used in many formulations and indications ranging form acne to skin aging. most if not all their pharmacological activities occur through binding to nuclear receptors with subsequent modulation of the activities of several genes. little attention has been given to the many other potential actions on the surface of the skin. aim: to analyse the potential anti-infective  activities of topical rol, ral and ra. methods: microbial minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) of rol, ral and ra were determined by a microdilution method on reference strains including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, micrococcus flavus, propionibacterium acnes, micrococcus luteus, enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus hominis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans and 133 clinical strains including methicillin-resistant s. aureus, methicillin-sensitive s. aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococcus, streptococcus group b, enterococcus faecalis, vancomycin-resistant e. faecalis, vancomycin-resistant e. faecium and pseudomonas/klebsiella. in two clinical trials in healthy human volunteers, skin bacterial densities were evaluated in samples obtained with the cylinder scrub method: (1). 2 and 5 h after a single application of 0.05% ral or vehicle on the forearm and (2). in a single-blind randomized study where 0.05% ral or vehicle were applied daily for 2 weeks on the forehead of 22 volunteers. paired results from treated (or vehicle) and untreated areas were analysed. results: of the three retinoids tested, only ral showed a significant in vitro antibacterial activity; this activity was found against reference strains of gram-positive bacteria like s. aeureus, micrococcus spp. or  p. acnes. no activity was found against gram-negative bacteria. these results on  reference strains were confirmed on 133 clinical isolates. mic(50) and mic(90) values for ral were 8 and 16 mg/l, respectively, for methicillin-sensitive s. aureus and 4 and 8 mg/l for methicillin-resistant s. aureus. the two in vivo studies showed that areas treated with ral had a significant decrease in the bacterial counts. in the forehead study, the median decrease was 10(2) log/cm(2)  for p. acnes and 10(1.8) log/cm(2) for staphylococci. no resistant bacteria were  found after 2 weeks of topical use. preliminary results suggest that the antibacterial effect of ral is due, in part, to the aldehyde group in the lateral chain, since non-retinoid pseudo-analogues of the chain, like citral and hexenal, showed a similar antibacterial activity. conclusion: we have shown that ral differs from parent natural retinoids such as rol and ra in demonstrating significant antibacterial activities upon topical use. this activity is likely due to the aldehyde group in the isoprenoic lateral chain, which illustrates the  potential bifunctional properties of some retinoids.

TI  == drosophila myd88 is required for the response to fungal and gram-positive bacterial infections.
AB  == we report here the identification and functional characterization of dmmyd88, a gene encoding the drosophila homolog of mammalian myd88. dmmyd88 combines a toll-il-1r homology (tir) domain and a death domain. overexpression of dmmyd88 was sufficient to induce expression of the antifungal peptide drosomycin, and induction of drosomycin was markedly reduced in dmmyd88-mutant flies. dmmyd88 interacted with toll through its tir domain and required the death domain proteins tube and pelle to activate expression of drs, which encodes drosomycin.  dmmyd88-mutant flies were highly susceptible to infection by fungi and gram-positive bacteria, but resisted gram-negative bacterial infection much as did wild-type flies. phenotypic comparison of dmmyd88-mutant flies and myd88-deficient mice showed essential differences in the control of gram-negative infection in insects and mammals.

TI  == drosophila toll is activated by gram-positive bacteria through a circulating peptidoglycan recognition protein.
AB  == microbial infection activates two distinct intracellular signalling cascades in the immune-responsive fat body of drosophila. gram-positive bacteria and fungi predominantly induce the toll signalling pathway, whereas gram-negative bacteria  activate the imd pathway. loss-of-function mutants in either pathway reduce the resistance to corresponding infections. genetic screens have identified a range of genes involved in these intracellular signalling cascades, but how they are activated by microbial infection is largely unknown. activation of the transmembrane receptor toll requires a proteolytically cleaved form of an extracellular cytokine-like polypeptide, spatzle, suggesting that toll does not itself function as a bona fide recognition receptor of microbial patterns. this is in apparent contrast with the mammalian toll-like receptors and raises the question of which host molecules actually recognize microbial patterns to activate toll through spatzle. here we present a mutation that blocks toll activation by gram-positive bacteria and significantly decreases resistance to this type of infection. the mutation semmelweis (seml) inactivates the gene encoding a peptidoglycan recognition protein (pgrp-sa). interestingly, seml does  not affect toll activation by fungal infection, indicating the existence of a distinct recognition system for fungi to activate the toll pathway.

TI  == formation and structure of mixed bacterial communities.
AB  == mixed bacterial communities are formed by unrelated bacteria on solid media. mixed bacterial communities on solid media are similar to "classical" colonies and are formed after the growth of a large number of unrelated bacteria simultaneously plated onto a limited area of agar. the morphology of the mixed bacterial communities was similar for different combinations of bacteria and did  not change when the bacteria were plated on different media. different bacterial  strains form zones of individual and mixed growth in the structure of mixed bacterial communities. the results of electron microscopic examination indicate that mixed bacterial communities are isolated from their external environment by  a surface film. the basic part of this film is formed by an elementary membrane.  the membrane of the surface film of mixed bacterial communities is a stable structure occupying a large surface area. the results of this investigation seem  to indicate the existence of a special type of co-operation between different species of bacteria. this type of co-operation may be very important in the regulation of interactions between different bacteria and between bacteria and the environment.

AB  == lipoteichoic acids (ltas) from various bacterial species, including staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, and listeria monocytogenes, were examined for the ability  to induce secretory and cellular responses in a pure population of bone marrow-derived mononuclear phagocytes. some of the highly purified ltas, in particular ltas from bacillus subtilis, s. pyogenes, e. faecalis, and enterococcus hirae, were able to affect each of the macrophage parameters measured, i.e., reductive capacity, secretion of tumor necrosis factor and nitrite, and tumoricidal activity. as after stimulation with whole organisms or other bacterial products, secretion of tumor necrosis factor induced by these ltas reached its maximum within the first few hours of the interaction, while secretion of nitrite and tumoricidal activity required 24 to 36 h for full expression. other purified ltas, i.e., ltas from streptococcus sanguis, s. pneumoniae, and l. monocytogenes, as well as lipomannan from micrococcus luteus affected only some of these parameters, while native lta from s. aureus was inactive. there was no obvious correlation between biological activity and chain  length, kind of glycosyl substituents, glycolipid structures, or fatty acid composition of ltas. deacylation of ltas resulted in a complete loss of activity, and deacylated ltas did not impair the activity of their acylated counterparts, suggesting that acyl chains may be essential for binding of lta to the cell surface. the results demonstrate that some lta species are potent inducers of macrophage secretory and cellular activities.

AB  == about 10% of 100 clinical isolates of enterococcus faecalis were resistant to greater than or equal to 25 micrograms of norfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin,  and temafloxacin per ml. in this study, the dna gyrase of e. faecalis was purified from a fluoroquinolone-susceptible strain (atcc 19433) and two resistant isolates, ms16968 and ms16996. strains ms16968 and ms16996 were 64- to 128-fold and 16- to 32-fold less susceptible, respectively, to fluoroquinolones than was atcc 19433; mics of nonquinolone antibacterial agents for these strains were almost equal. the dna gyrase from atcc 19433 had two subunits, designated a and b, with properties similar to those of dna gyrase from other gram-positive bacteria such as bacillus subtilis and micrococcus luteus. inhibition of the supercoiling activity of the enzyme from atcc 19433 by the fluoroquinolones correlated with their antibacterial activities. in contrast, preparations of dna  gyrase from ms16968 and ms16996 were at least 30-fold less sensitive to inhibition of supercoiling by the fluoroquinolones than the gyrase from atcc 19433 was. experiments that combined heterologous gyrase subunits showed that the a subunit from either of the resistant isolates conferred resistance to fluoroquinolones. these findings indicate that an alteration in the gyrase a subunit is the major contributor to fluoroquinolone resistance in e. faecalis clinical isolates. a difference in drug uptake may also contribute to the level of fluoroquinolone resistance in these isolates.

TI  == paradoxical response of enterococcus faecalis to the bactericidal activity of penicillin is associated with reduced activity of one autolysin.
AB  == ten clinical isolates of enterococcus faecalis were examined for susceptibility to the bactericidal activity of penicillin. four of these had mbcs of penicillin  equal to 2 to 4 x the mic, and six exhibited a paradoxical response to penicillin, i.e., the bactericidal activity of the antibiotic had a concentration optimum at 2 to 4 x the mic and decreased significantly at concentrations above this. we found that the paradoxical response to penicillin was an intrinsic and stable property of a strain, but that its phenotypic expression was not homogeneous; only a fraction of the cell population that died at low concentrations was able to survive at high penicillin concentrations. the size of this fraction increased with increasing antibiotic concentration and reached a maximum in the late-log phase of growth. all 10 strains produced a lytic enzyme that was active on micrococcus luteus heat-killed cells, whereas only some strains lysed e. faecalis heat-killed cells. strains producing large amounts of the latter enzyme did not show the paradoxical response to penicillin, whereas mutants of these strains that lacked this enzymatic activity paradoxically responded to the antibiotic activity. in addition, from strains that showed paradoxical response to penicillin and produced only the enzyme that was active on m. luteus, it was possible to isolate mutants that were also capable of lysing e. faecalis cells and that were killed with similar efficiency by all concentrations above the mbc. on the basis of these findings, the paradoxical response to penicillin is explained as a property of certain strains of e. faecalis; this property is genetically characterized by alterations in synthesis  or activity of one autolysin but phenotypically expressed only by a few cells that are in a particular physiological condition when exposed to high concentrations of antibiotics.

TI  == [antibacterial activity of cervical mucus in pregnant or non-pregnant women].
AB  == antibacterial activities of human cervical mucus obtained from non-pregnant and pregnant women were tested using standard blood agar plates. the combined effect  of cervical mucus with cefmetazole (cmz) was also investigated. obtained results  are summarized as follows. 1. cervical mucus specimens obtained from 6 subjects at 9 to 36 weeks of pregnancy showed antibacterial activity to only one strain of bacillus subtilis among organisms tested. the cervical mucus enhanced the activity of cmz against 1 strain of streptococcus pyogenes and 2 strains of micrococcus luteus, but no effect was observed against other organisms tested. 2. cervical mucus specimens obtained from non-pregnant women showed antibacterial activities to 8 of 11 strains (72.7%) of b. subtilis tested. the cervical mucus enhanced the activities of cmz against 1 strain of s. pyogenes and 3 strains of b. subtilis. the tested organisms included staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, bacteroides fragilis, s. pyogenes, b. subtilis, m. luteus, streptococcus agalactiae, enterococcus faecalis, and candida albicans, but, as described above, cervical mucus samples showed antimicrobial activities only against b. subtilis (9/17, 52.9%), and specimens obtained only from non-pregnant women or pregnant women with less than 11 weeks of pregnancy showed any antimicrobial activities.

TI  == biosynthesis of ribothymidine in the transfer rna of streptococcus faecalis and bacillus subtilis. a methylation of rna involving 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate.
AB  == the methyl moiety of ribothymidine in the trna of streptococcus faecalis, bacillus subtilis, and probably bacillus cereus is dervied from a 1-carbon folate derivative and not s-adenosylmethionine. micrococcus luteus (m. lysodeikticus) trna appears to be almost devoid of ribothymidine. s. faecalis trna lacking ribothymidine can be methylated in vitro with formation of ribothymidine. 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate has been identified as the 1-carbon donor involved in ribothymidine formation in s. faecalis and implicated in the analogous reaction in b. subtilis. the reaction requires fadh2 and/or another reducing agent present in cell extracts for the reduction of the methylene moiety.
