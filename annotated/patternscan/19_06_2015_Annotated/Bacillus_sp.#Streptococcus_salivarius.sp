TI  == poultry farm hygiene: microbiological quality assessment of drinking water used in layer chickens managed under the battery cage and deep litter systems at three poultry farms in southwestern nigeria.
AB  == water troughs from deep litter and caged chicken water troughs (drinkers) fixed to each of the different 3-tier cages containing layer chickens in farms a, b and c were subjected to a 7-day study which involved the monitoring of poultry farm hygiene. drinkers were washed before filling with water on day 1. for days 3, 5 and 7 water was served without prior washing. the occurrence and characterization of the bacteria isolates were investigated and data obtained were analyzed and compared. for the bacterial count on day 1, for layer chickens on cage system, no significant differences (p > 0.05) among the farms and between the farms tier interactions. on day 3, no significant difference (p > 0.05) among the parameters. on day 5, there was significant difference (p<0.05) among the farms and on day 7, there was high significant difference (p < 0.01) among the farms. on days 5 and 7, there were no significant differences (p>0.05) among the tiers nor between the interactions of the farms and tiers. the bacterial count in water troughs of layer chickens in deep litter system, on day 1, had no significant differences (p > 0.05) between the farms, water troughs and their interactions. on day 3, no significant difference (p > 0.05) among the parameters. on days 5 and 7, there were significant difference (p<0.05) and a high significant difference (p < 0.01) between the farms respectively. on days 5 and 7, no significant differences between the water troughs and between the interaction of  the farms and the water troughs. farm a isolates contained staphylococcus aureus, proteus vulgaris, streptococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, staphylococcus epidermis, klebsiella sp., salmonella sp., bacillus subtilis, lactobacillus salivarius and corynebacterium sp. farm b had staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermis, bacillus subtilis, corynebacterium sp., escherichia coli, streptococcus faecalis and klebsiella sp. while for farm c, apart from the prevalent bacteria isolates obtained in farms a and b, additional 2 bacterial isolates, lactobacillus salivarius and pseudomonas aeuriginosa were found. in conclusion, water troughs when cleaned on daily basis carry minimum bacterial load. those left for 3, 5 and 7 days uncleaned had progressively high bacterial loads, suggesting that the flock of birds and the consumers of the eggs and meat  from the chickens are at risk of bacterial infection unless strict farm hygiene is ensured through regular monitoring.

TI  == low surface tension calcium hydroxide solution is an effective antiseptic.
AB  == the antimicrobial effects of a saturated calcium hydroxide solution, and in combination with 10% and 20% detergent, were evaluated on streptococcus faecalis, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, neisseria  sp., diphtheroid, staphylococcus aureus, lactobacillus sp., staphylococcus epidermidis, bacillus subtilis and candida albicans. the saturated calcium hydroxide solution was effective against only four of the 11 microorganisms studied over a 60-min exposure time. the calcium hydroxide solutions containing detergent killed all 11 test organisms over a 30-min exposure time. this difference was statistically significant (p < 0.01). no statistically significant difference in antimicrobial action was found between the 10% and 20% detergent calcium hydroxide solutions (p > 0.01). however, the low surface tension (46.5 x  10(-3) nm-1) and high ph (10.8) of the calcium hydroxide solution with 20% detergent establish it as the more effective solution.
