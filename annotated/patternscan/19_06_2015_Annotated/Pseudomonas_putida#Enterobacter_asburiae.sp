TI  == 2-ketogluconic acid secretion by incorporation of pseudomonas putida kt 2440 gluconate dehydrogenase (gad) operon in enterobacter asburiae psi3 improves mineral phosphate solubilization.
AB  == enterobacter asburiae psi3 is known to efficiently solubilize rock phosphate by secretion of approximately 50 mm gluconic acid in tris-buffered medium in the presence of 75 mm glucose and in a mixture of seven aldosugars each at 15 mm concentration, mimicking alkaline vertisol soils. efficacy of this bacterium in the rhizosphere requires p release in the presence of low amount of sugars. to achieve this, e. asburiae psi3 has been manipulated to express gluconate dehydrogenase (gad) operon of pseudomonas putida kt 2440 to produce 2-ketogluconic acid. e. asburiae psi3 harboring gad operon had 438 u of gad activity, secreted 11.63 mm 2-ketogluconic and 21.65 mm gluconic acids in tris-rock phosphate-buffered medium containing 45 mm glucose. e. asburiae psi3 gad transformant solubilized 0.84 mm p from rock phosphate in trp-buffered liquid medium. in the presence of a mixture of seven sugars each at 12 mm, the transformant brought about a drop in ph to 4.1 and released 0.53 mm p.

TI  == transfer of antibiotic multiresistant plasmid rp4 from escherichia coli to activated sludge bacteria.
AB  == in situ transfer of a self-transmissible, antibiotic-multiresistant plasmid rp4 from a laboratory escherichia coli strain c600 to indigenous activated sludge bacteria was investigated using filter mating. the transfer frequency of rp4 from the donor e. coli to the bacteria that was sampled from two wastewater treatment  plants was 5.1x10(-2) to 7.5x10(-1) and 4.6x10(-3) to 1.3x10(-2)/potential recipient. the isolated transconjugants showed resistance to ap, km, and tc and the presence of a plasmid with a similar size to rp4. the trag gene on rp4 was also detected from all transconjugants. reverse-transfer experiments from the transconjugants to e. coli hb101 indicated that rp4 maintained self-transmissibility in the transconjugants. the transconjugant strains were dominant bacteria in activated sludge including pseudomonas fluorescens, p. putida, and ochrobactrum anthropi and minor populations of enteric bacterial strains including citrobacter freundii, e. coli, enterobacter cloacae, e. asburiae, and klebsiella pneumoniae ssp. pneumoniae. the transconjugant strains k. pneumoniae ssp. pneumonia, e. cloacae, and e. asburiae had several naturally occurring plasmids. these results suggest that in situ transfer of plasmids and the exchange of antibiotic-resistant genes can occur between released and indigenous bacteria in activated sludge.
