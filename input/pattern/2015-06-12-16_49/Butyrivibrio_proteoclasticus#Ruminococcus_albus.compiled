TI  - The effect of lipid supplements on ruminal bacteria in continuous culture fermenters varies with the fatty acid composition.
AB  - A single flow continuous culture fermenter system was used in this study to investigate the influence of dietary lipid supplements varying in their fatty acid content on the DNA concentration of selected rumen bacteria. Four continuous culture fermenters were used in a 4 x 4 Latin square design with four periods of 10 d each. Treatment diets were fed at 45 g/d (DM basis) in three equal portions during the day. The diets were: 1) control (CON), 2) control with animal fat source (SAT), 3) control with soybean oil (SBO), and 4) control with fish oil (FO). Lipid supplements were added at 3% of diet DM. The concentrations of total volatile fatty acids and acetate were not affected (P>0.05) by lipid supplements. Concentrations of propionate, iso-butyrate, valerate and iso-valerate were highest (P<0.05) with the FO diet compared with the other treatment diets. The concentration of til C18:l (vaccenic acid, VA) in effluents increased (P<0.05) with SBO and FO diets and was highest with the SBO diet. The concentrations of C18:0 in effluents were lowest (P<0.05) for the FO diet compared with the other treatment diets. Concentrations of DNA for Anaerovibrio lipolytica, and Butyrivibrio proteoclasticus in fermenters were similar (P>0.05) for all diets. The DNA concentrations of Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens and Ruminococcus albus in fermenters were lowest (P<0.05) with the FO diet but were similar (P>0.05) among the other treatment diets. Selenomonas ruminantium DNA concentration in fermenters was highest (P<0.05) with the FO diet. In conclusion, SBO had no effect on bacterial DNA concentrations tested in this study and the VA accumulation in the rumen observed on the FO diet may be due in part to FO influence on B. fibrisolvens, R. albus, and S. ruminantium.
TI  - Forage type and fish oil cause shifts in rumen bacterial diversity.
AB  - Despite evidence supporting improved incorporation of beneficial polyunsaturated  fatty acids (PUFA) into ruminant products, such as meat and milk, following red clover and fish oil (FO) inclusion in the ruminant diet, little is known regarding the concomitant bacterial diversity. We evaluated the effects of feeding grass vs. red clover silage with incremental FO inclusion on known lipolytic, biohydrogenating, cellulolytic and proteolytic rumen bacterial communities of steers. Following 14 days of dietary adaptation, liquid-associated (LAB) and solid-associated (SAB) bacterial communities were harvested, DNA extracted and bacterial denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and specific-bacterial quantitative PCR (QPCR) were undertaken. DGGE-derived dendrograms showed that diet caused the greatest change in LAB and SAB bacterial diversity, with FO inclusion at the 2% and 3% dry matter intake also causing some changes. QPCR revealed that diet resulted in changes in the DNA concentration of Anaerovibrio lipolytica, the Butyrivibrio proteoclasticus group, Fibrobacter succinogenes, Ruminococcus albus and Ruminococcus flavefaciens. FO inclusion caused changes in A. lipolytica, F. succinogenes and R. flavefaciens DNA concentration only. In the B. proteoclasticus group, which are the only known bacteria with the capacity to biohydrogenate PUFA to 18:0, DNA concentration did not correlate to 18:0 flow to the duodenum, however, suggesting that other bacteria may play a role in biohydrogenation. A greater understanding of microbial changes that accompany beneficial dietary changes will lead to novel strategies to improve ruminant product quality.
