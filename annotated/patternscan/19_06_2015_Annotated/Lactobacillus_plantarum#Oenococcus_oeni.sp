TI  == genetic and technological characterisation of vineyard- and winery-associated lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == vineyard- and winery-associated lactic acid bacteria (lab) from two major pdo regions in greece, peza and nemea, were surveyed. lab were isolated from grapes,  fermenting musts, and winery tanks performing spontaneous malolactic fermentations (mlf). higher population density and species richness were detected in nemea than in peza vineyards and on grapes than in fermenting musts. pediococcus pentosaceus and lactobacillus graminis were the most abundant lab on  grapes, while lactobacillus plantarum dominated in fermenting musts from both regions. no particular structure of lactobacillus plantarum populations according to the region of origin was observed, and strain distribution seems random. lab species diversity in winery tanks differed significantly from that in vineyard samples, consisting principally of oenococcus oeni. different strains were analysed as per their enological characteristics and the ability to produce biogenic amines (bas). winery-associated species showed higher resistance to low  ph, ethanol, so2, and cuso4 than vineyard-associated isolates. the frequency of ba-producing strains was relatively low but not negligible, considering that certain winery-associated lactobacillus hilgardii strains were able to produce bas. present results show the necessity of controlling the mlf by selected starters in order to avoid ba accumulation in wine.

TI  == the use of the replication region of plasmid prs7 from oenococcus oeni as a putative tool to generate cloning vectors for lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == a chimeric plasmid, prs7rep (6.1 kb), was constructed using the replication region of prs7, a large plasmid from oenococcus oeni, and pem64, a plasmid derived from pij2925 and containing a gene for resistance to chloramphenicol. prs7rep is a shuttle vector that replicates in escherichia coli using its pij2925 component and in lactic acid bacteria (lab) using the replication region of prs7. high levels of transformants per microg of dna were obtained by electroporation of prs7rep into pediococcus acidilactici (1.5 x 10(7)), lactobacillus plantarum (5.7 x 10(5)), lactobacillus casei (2.3 x 10(5)), leuconostoc citreum (2.7 x 10(5)), and enterococcus faecalis (2.4 x 10(5)). a preliminary optimisation of the technical conditions of electrotransformation showed that p. acidilactici and l. plantarum are better transformed at a later exponential phase of growth, whereas l. casei requires the early exponential phase for better electrotransformation efficiency. prs7rep contains single restriction sites useful for cloning purposes, bamhi, xbai, sali, hincii, sphi and psti, and was maintained at an acceptable rate (>50%) over 100 generations without selective pressure in l. plantarum, but was less stable in l. casei and p. acidilactici. the ability of prs7rep to accept and express other genes was assessed. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the replication region of a plasmid from o. oeni has been used to generate a cloning vector.

TI  == assessment of probiotic properties in lactic acid bacteria isolated from wine.
AB  == probiotic properties are highly strain-dependent but rarely studied in enological lactic acid bacteria (lab). in this study, the probiotic features of 11 strains of lactobacillus spp., pediococcus spp., and oenococcus oeni, including saliva and acid resistance, bile tolerance and exopolysaccharides' production, were investigated. the assays included two probiotic reference strains (lactobacillus  plantarum clc 17 and lactobacillus fermentum cect5716). the lactobacillus and pediococcus strains showed high resistance to lysozyme (>80% resistance to 100 mg/l of lysozyme under conditions simulating the in vivo dilution by saliva) and  were capable of surviving at low ph values (ph 1.8) and bile salts, suggesting good adaptation of the wine strains to gastrointestinal conditions. the ability of the strains to adhere to the intestinal mucosa and the inhibition of the adhesion of escherichia coli to human intestinal cells were also evaluated. adhesion levels of enological lab to caco-2 cells varied from 0.37% to 12.2%, depending on the strain. in particular, pediococcus pentosaceus cial-86 showed a  high percentage of adhesion to intestinal cells (>12%), even higher than that shown by the probiotic reference strains, and a high anti-adhesion activity against e. coli cial-153 (>30%), all of which support this wine lab strain as a potential probiotic.

TI  == patagonian red wines: selection of lactobacillus plantarum isolates as potential  starter cultures for malolactic fermentation.
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate fifty-three lactobacillus plantarum isolates obtained from a patagonian red wine, molecularly identified and typified using rapd analysis, in order to select starter cultures for malolactic fermentation (mlf). the results obtained suggest a considerable genetic diversity, taking into account that all l. plantarum isolates were obtained from  one cellar and one vintage. based on the capacity to tolerate a concentration of  14 % ethanol in mrs broth for 2 days, eight isolates were selected for the subsequent analysis. the incidence of various wine stress factors (ethanol, acid  ph, lysozyme and sulfur dioxide) on isolates growth was studied. besides, glucosidase and tannase activities were evaluated, and the presence of genes involved in the synthesis of biogenic amines was examined by pcr. a previously characterized indigenous oenococcus oeni strain was included with comparative purposes. differences in technologically relevant characteristics were observed among the eight l. plantarum selected isolates, revealing an isolate-dependent behavior. detectable glucosidase and tannase activities were found in all isolates. the presence of genes encoding histidine and tyrosine descarboxylases and putrescine carbamoyltransferase was not detected. the ability of l. plantarum isolates to grow and consume l-malic acid in simulated laboratory-scale vinifications revealed that two of them could be considered as possible mlf starter cultures for patagonian red wines. these isolates will be subjected to further analysis, for a final winery technological characterization.

TI  == biodiversity, dynamics and ecology of bacterial community during grape marc storage for the production of grappa.
AB  == the italian spirit obtained from grape marc, grappa, is produced by an extended storage of the marc which allows alcoholic fermentation. bacterial populations can develop and are associated with off-flavour production. grape marc acidification before storage is a common practice in distilleries to control bacterial proliferation. few studies have been published on the microbial biodiversity in grape marc and no information exists about microbiology of acidified marcs and physiological properties needed for colonizing such an environment. the aim of this study was to investigate the composition and dynamics of grape marc bacterial populations during the long-period storage by microbiological analyses of acidified and untreated marcs. eight bacterial species were identified by ardra - 16s rrna sequencing at the beginning of the fermentation. among them the bacterial species of tatumella terrea, acetobacter ghanensis and tatumella ptyseos were identified for the first time in a wine environment. in later stages oenococcus oeni and members of the lactobacillus plantarum group became dominant in acidified and non-acidified grape marc, respectively. further molecular typing of l. plantarum isolates yielded 39 strains. to explain the prevalence of l. plantarum in untreated samples, all strains were tested for potential antimicrobial activity and for biofilm formation ability. although no antimicrobial activity was found, many strains exhibited the ability to form a biofilm, which may confer an ecological advantage to these strains and their dominance during marc storage.

TI  == synthesis of fruity ethyl esters by acyl coenzyme a: alcohol acyltransferase and  reverse esterase activities in oenococcus oeni and lactobacillus plantarum.
AB  == aims: to assess the abilities of commercial wine lactic acid bacteria (lab) to synthesize potentially flavour active fatty acid ethyl esters and determine mechanisms involved in their production. methods and results: oenococcus oeni awri b551 produced significant levels of ethyl hexanoate and ethyl octanoate following growth in an ethanolic test medium, and ester formation generally increased with increasing ph (4.5 > 3.5), anaerobiosis and precursor supplementation. cell-free extracts of commercial o. oeni strains and lactobacillus plantarum awri b740 were also tested for ester-synthesizing capabilities in a phosphate buffer via: (i) acyl coenzyme a: alcohol acyltransferase (acoaaat) activity and (ii) reverse esterase activity. for both ester-synthesizing activities, strain-dependent variation was observed, with acoaaat activity generally greater than reverse esterase. reverse esterase in o.  oeni awri b551 also esterified 1-propanol to produce propyl octanoate, and deuterated substrates ([(2)h(6)]ethanol and [(2)h(15)]octanoic acid) to produce the fully deuterated ester, [(2)h(5)]ethyl [(2)h(15)]octanoate. conclusions: wine lab exhibit ethyl ester-synthesizing capability and possess two different ester-synthesizing activities, one of which is associated with an acyl coenzyme a: alcohol acyltransferase. significance and impact of the study: this study demonstrates that wine lab exhibit enzyme activities that can augment the ethyl ester content of wine. this knowledge will facilitate greater control over the impacts of malolactic fermentation on the fruity sensory properties and quality of wine.

TI  == fast identification of wine related lactic acid bacteria by multiplex pcr.
AB  == the microflora of must and wine consists of yeasts, acetic acid bacteria and lactic acid bacteria (lab). the latter group plays an important role for wine quality. the malolactic fermentation carried out by lab leads to deacidification  and stabilisation of wines. nevertheless, lab are often associated with wine spoilage. they are mainly responsible for the formation of biogenic amines. furthermore, some strains produce exopolysaccharide slimes, acetic acid, diacetyl and other off-flavours. in this context a better monitoring of the vinification process is crucial to improve wine quality. moreover, a lot of biodiversity studies would also profit from a fast and reliable identification method. in this study, we propose a species-specific multiplex pcr system for a rapid and simultaneous detection of 13 lab species, frequently occurring in must or wine: lactobacillus brevis, lb. buchneri, lb. curvatus, lb. hilgardii, lb. plantarum, leuconostoc mesenteroides, oenococcus oeni, pediococcus acidilactici, p. damnosus, p. inopinatus, p. parvulus, p. pentosaceus and weissella paramesenteroides.

TI  == basic characterization and partial purification of beta-glucosidase from cell-free extracts of oenococcus oeni st81.
AB  == aims: this study was designed to characterize a beta-glucosidase of oenococcus oeni st81, a strain isolated from a spanish wine of the origin appellation ribeira sacra. methods and results: the beta-glucosidase of o. oeni st81 seems to have a periplasmic localization into the cells. this activity was strongly inhibited by gluconic acid, partially inhibited by glucose and not inhibited by fructose, lactate, malate, mannitol or sorbitol. ethanol increased the activity of this enzyme up to 147%. among the several metal ions assayed, only fe(2)(+) (10 mmol l(-)(1)) and cu(2)(+) (5 mmol l(-)(1)) exhibited a partial inhibitory effect (40%). this enzyme was partially purified using a combination of ammonium  sulfate precipitation and chromatographic methods. the single peak because of beta-glucosidase in all chromatographic columns indicates the presence of a single enzyme with an estimated molecular mass of 140 kda. the calculated k(m) and v(max) values for 4-nitrophenyl-beta-d-glucopyranoside were 0.38 mmol l(-)(1) and 5.21 nmol min(-)(1), respectively. the enzyme was stable at ph 5.0 with a value of t(1/2) = 50 days for the crude extract. conclusions: the beta-glucosidase of o. oeni st81 is substantially different from those characterized from other wine-related lactic acid bacteria (lab), such as lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus brevis; however, it appears to be closely related to a beta-glucosidase from o. oeni atcc baa-1163 cloned into escherichia coli. the periplasmic localization of the enzyme together with its high tolerance to ethanol and fructose, the low inhibitory effect of some wine-related compounds on the enzymatic activity and long-term stability of the enzyme could be of interest for winemaking. significance and impact of the study: information regarding a beta-glucosidase from o. oeni st81 is presented. although the release of aroma compounds by lab has been demonstrated, little information exists concerning the responsible enzymes. to our knowledge, this study contains  the first characterization of a native beta-glucosidase purified from crude extracts of o. oeni st81.

TI  == heterologous expression of oenococcus oeni malolactic enzyme in lactobacillus plantarum for improved malolactic fermentation.
AB  == lactobacillus plantarum is involved in a multitude of food related industrial fermentation processes including the malolactic fermentation (mlf) of wine. this  work is the first report on a recombinant l. plantarum strain successfully conducting mlf. the malolactic enzyme (mle) from oenococcus oeni was cloned into  the lactobacillal expression vector psip409 which is based on the sakacin p operon of lactobacillus sakei and expressed in the host strain l. plantarum wcfs1. both recombinant and wild-type l. plantarum strains were tested for mlf using a buffered malic acid solution in absence of glucose. under the conditions  with l-malic acid as the only energy source and in presence of mn2+ and nad+, the recombinant l. plantarum and the wild-type strain converted 85% (2.5 g/l) and 51% (1.5 g/l), respectively, of l-malic acid in 3.5 days. furthermore, the recombinant l. plantarum cells converted in a modified wine 15% (0.4 g/l) of initial l-malic acid concentration in 2 days. in conclusion, recombinant l. plantarum cells expressing mle accelerate the malolactic fermentation.

TI  == construction of theta-type shuttle vector for leuconostoc and other lactic acid bacteria using pcb42 isolated from kimchi.
AB  == the pcb42 plasmid from leuconostoc citreum cb2567, a strain isolated from kimchi, was characterized, and a shuttle vector for escherichia coli and lactic acid bacteria (lab) was constructed. the pcb42 plasmid has a circular structure of 4312bp, a low g+c content, and no single-stranded dna intermediates during replication, which indicates that pcb42 replicates via the theta-type replication mechanism. in silico analysis of this plasmid revealed 6 open reading frames: 1 transposase gene, 1 dna-binding gene, 2 putative replication genes, and 2 unknown genes. the fragment encompassing orf5 contains a functional plasmid replicon. this plasmid was capable of replicating in various lab, including l. citreum, l.  mesenteroides, lactobacillus plantarum, lb. reuteri, lactococcus lactis, streptococcus thermophilus, weissella confusa, and oenococcus oeni. the lab-e. coli shuttle vector was constructed by ligating pcb42 and pek104, and the resulting shuttle vector, pleucm42, showed a high segregational stability in l. citreum cb2567 after 100 generations of cell division. by using this shuttle vector, the beta-gal gene from lb. plantarum was successfully expressed in the host strain, l. citreum cb2567. the pleucm42 shuttle vector can serve as a useful gene-delivery and expression tool for the genetic study or metabolic engineering  of various strains of lab.

TI  == dynamics of indigenous lactic acid bacteria populations in wine fermentations from la rioja (spain) during three vintages.
AB  == diversity of lactic acid bacteria (lab) species has been analyzed for three consecutive years (2006, 2007, and 2008) during alcoholic and malolactic fermentations of tempranillo wine in a winery at la rioja. the results showed differences in malolactic fermentation duration, and in both diversity of lab species and diversity of oenococcus oeni genotypes. o. oeni was shown to be the predominant species (73% of total isolates). monitoring the different strains of  o. oeni using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of chromosomal dna digested with sfii and apai allowed detection of a total of 37 distinct genotypes, most of them comprised at least two isolates. six appeared in more than one vintage, one of them being present in the three studied years. moreover, four genotypes were indistinct of the strains isolated from the air of this same winery in 2007 vintage. the frequency of participation of each genotype varied from year to year, thus dominant genotypes at one year were minority or not present at another year. this suggests that distinct indigenous o. oeni strains are better adapted to the different winery conditions every year. predominant genotypes that appeared in more than one vintage and lead to quality wines with low histamine contents could be considered as interesting for selecting of new malolactic starter cultures.

TI  == characterization of lactic acid bacteria from musts and wines of three consecutive vintages of ribeira sacra.
AB  == aims: this study was designed to isolate and characterize the lactic acid microbiota of the musts and wines of a young denomination of origin area, ribeira sacra in north-west spain. methods and results: over three consecutive years (2007, 2008 and 2009), we examined musts and wines from four cellars in different zones of the region. through biochemical and genetic tests, 459 isolates of lactic acid bacteria (lab) were identified as the following species: lactobacillus alvei (0.7%), lactobacillus brevis (1.7%), lactobacillus frumenti (0.9%), lactobacillus kunkeei (12%), lactobacillus plantarum (6.5%), lactobacillus pentosus (0.9%), lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis (3%), leuconostoc citreum (0.7%), leuconostoc fructosum (synon. lactobacillus fructosum) (3.7%), leuconostoc mesenteroides ssp. mesenteroides (2.8%), leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides (0.2%), oenococcus oeni (59%), pediococcus parvulus (7%) and  weisella paramesenteroides (synon. leuconostoc paramesenteroides) (0.9%). of these species, o. oeni was the main one responsible for malolactic fermentation (mlf) in all cellars and years with the exception of lact. plantarum, predominant in 2007, in one cellar, and lact. brevis, lact. frumenti and ped. parvulus coexisting with o. oeni in one cellar in 2009. different strains (84) of lab species (14) were identified by biochemical techniques (api strips, the presence  of plasmids, enzyme activities and mlf performance) and molecular techniques (pcr). all assays were carried out with every one of the 459 isolates. to select  candidates for use as culture starters, we assessed malolactic, beta-glucosidase  and tannase activities, the presence of genes involved in biogenic amine production and plasmid content. conclusions: a high diversity of lab is present in the grape musts of ribeira sacra but few species are responsible for mlf; however, different strains of such species are involved in the process. as far as we are aware, this is the first report of lact. frumenti thriving in wine. significance and impact of the study: information on lab populations in must and  wine is presented. a large collection of well-characterized strains of lab are available as starter cultures to winemakers.

TI  == metabolomics reveals alterations in both primary and secondary metabolites by wine bacteria.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) were isolated from korean meoru (vitis coigneties) wine and identified as lactobacillus plantarum meoru0711 (kacc 91436c). the fermentative behavior and metabolic effects of l. plantarum during malolactic fermentation (mlf) were compared with those of the commercial oenococcus oeni strain through 1h nmr- and gc-based metabolic profiling. twenty-two primary metabolites of amino acids, carbohydrates, and organic acids, and 55 secondary metabolites of volatile compounds were identified in wines by 1h nuclear magnetic resonance (nmr) spectroscopy and gas chromatography (gc), respectively. principal component analysis (pca) revealed that malolactic (ml)-fermented and non-ml-fermented wines, and wines ml-fermented with o. oeni and l. plantarum were clearly differentiated. both the primary and secondary metabolites were responsible for these differentiations. compared to non-mlf wines, mlf wines were characterized by increased levels of primary metabolites such as lactic acid, phenylalanine, uracil, ornithine, alanine, threonine, leucine, isoleucine, and valine with decreased levels of monosaccharides, glycerol, malic, and citric acids. in addition, higher levels of secondary metabolites such as butanal, ethyl isobutylate, isobutanol, isoamyl acetate, 2-butanoate ethyl ester, isoamyl alcohol, ethyl hexanoate, glycine, acetic acid, and benzaldehyde characterized the mlf wine. higher levels of primary metabolites such as tyrosine, monosaccharides, glycerol, alanine, 2,3-butanediol, valine, and leucine, and of secondary metabolites such as propyl acetate, isobutanol, isoamyl acetate, 1-butanol, ethyl hexanoate, prenyl alcohol, glycine, 2-hexen-1-ol, ethyl octanoate, acetic acid, benzaldehyde, and butyric, together with lower levels of  lactic acid, were observed in the wines fermented by l. plantarum compared with those by o. oeni. this present study demonstrates that different genera of lab affect both the primary and second metabolites in wine. moreover, metabolomics with multivariate statistical analysis provide insight into wine fermentation.

TI  == detection of arc genes related with the ethyl carbamate precursors in wine lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == trace amounts of the carcinogen ethyl carbamate can appear in wine by the reaction of ethanol with compounds such as citrulline and carbamyl phosphate, which are produced from arginine degradation by some wine lactic acid bacteria (lab). in this work, the presence of arc genes for the arginine-deiminase pathway was studied in several strains of different species of lab. their ability to degrade arginine was also studied. to detect the presence of arc genes, degenerate primers were designed from the alignment of protein sequences in already sequenced lab. the usefulness of these degenerate primers has been proven by sequencing some of the amplified pcr fragments and searching for homologies with published sequences of the same species and related ones. correlation was found between the presence of genes and the ability to degrade arginine. degrading strains included all heterofermentative lactobacilli, oenococcus oeni , pediococcus pentosaceus , and some strains of leuconostoc mesenteroides and lactobacillus plantarum .

TI  == molecular screening of wine lactic acid bacteria degrading hydroxycinnamic acids.
AB  == the potential to produce volatile phenols from hydroxycinnamic acids was investigated for lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from spanish grape must and  wine. a pcr assay was developed for the detection of lab that potentially produce volatile phenols. synthetic degenerate oligonucleotides for the specific detection of the pdc gene encoding a phenolic acid decarboxylase were designed. the pdc pcr assay amplifies a 321 bp dna fragment from phenolic acid decarboxylase. the pdc pcr method was applied to 85 strains belonging to the 6 main wine lab species. lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus brevis, and pediococcus pentosaceus strains produce a positive response in the pdc pcr assay, whereas oenococcus oeni, lactobacillus hilgardii, and leuconostoc mesenteroides strains did not produce the expected pcr product. the production of vinyl and ethyl derivatives from hydroxycinnamic acids in culture media was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. a relationship was found between pdc pcr  amplification and volatile phenol production, so that the lab strains that gave a positive pdc pcr response produce volatile phenols, whereas strains that did not  produce a pcr amplicon did not produce volatile phenols. the proposed method could be useful for a preliminary identification of lab strains able to produce volatile phenols in wine.

TI  == contribution of malolactic fermentation by oenococcus oeni and lactobacillus plantarum to the changes in the nonanthocyanin polyphenolic composition of red wine.
AB  == the changes in the nonanthocyanin phenolic composition during red wine malolactic fermentation carried out spontaneously and by four different starter cultures of  the species oenococcus oeni and lactobacillus plantarum were examined to determine whether differences in nonanthocyanin polyphenolic compounds could be attributed to the lactic acid bacteria (lab) strain that performs this important  step of the wine-making process. the polyphenolic compounds were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography with photodiode array detection and hplc with electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry detection. the malolactic cultures selected for this study were indigenous wine lab strains from the a.o.c. rioja (spain). results showed different malolactic behaviors in relation to wine phenolic compositions for o. oeni and l. plantarum, and also, a diversity was found within each group. the hydroxycinnamic acids and their derivatives, the flavonols and their glycosides, the flavanol monomers and oligomers, and trans-resveratrol and its glucoside were the main compounds modified by the different lab. the wild lab population exerted a greater impact in the wine content of some of these phenolic compounds than the inoculated selected monocultures of this study.

TI  == coculture-inducible bacteriocin activity of lactobacillus plantarum strain j23 isolated from grape must.
AB  == detection and characterization of bacteriocin production by lactobacillus plantarum strain j23, recovered from a grape must sample in spain, have been carried out. bacteriocin activity was degraded by proteolytic enzymes (trypsin, alfa-chymotrypsin, papaine, protease, proteinase k and acid proteases), and it was stable at high temperatures (121 degrees c, 20min), in a wide range of ph (1-12), and after treatment with organic solvents. l. plantarum j23 showed antimicrobial activity against oenococcus oeni, and a range of lactobacillus and  pediococcus species. bacteriocin production was detected in liquid media only when j23 was cocultivated with some inducing bacteria, and induction took place when intact cells or 55 degrees c heated cells of the inducer were cocultivated with j23, but not with their autoclaved cells. bacteriocin activity of j23 was not induced by high initial j23 inocula, and it was detected in cocultures during the exponential phase. the presence of ethanol or acidic ph in the media reduced  bacteriocin production in the cocultures of j23 with the inducing bacteria. the presence of plantaricin-related plnef and plnj genes was detected by pcr and sequencing. nevertheless, negative results were obtained for plna, plnk, plnc8, pls and plw genes.

TI  == tolerance to high osmolality of the lactic acid bacterium oenococcus oeni and identification of potential osmoprotectants.
AB  == growth of the lactic acid bacterium oenococcus oeni under hyperosmotic constraint was investigated in a chemically defined medium. the bacterium could grow on media with an elevated osmolality, preferably below 1.5 osm kg(-)(1) h(2)o. at osmolalities comprised between 0.6 and 1.5 osm kg(-)(1) h(2)o, the growth deficit elicited by the sugars glucose and fructose was slightly more severe than with salts (nacl or kcl). in contrast to what was observed in other lactic acid bacteria, proline, glycine betaine and related molecules were unable to relieve inhibition of growth of o. oeni under osmotic constraint. this was correlated to  the absence of sequences homologous to the genes coding for glycine betaine and/or proline transporters described in lactococcus lactis and lactobacillus plantarum. the amino acid aspartate proved to be osmoprotective under electrolyte and non-electrolyte stress. examination of the role of peptides during osmoregulation showed that proline- and glutamate-containing peptides were protective under salt-induced stress, and not under sugar-induced stress. under high salt, pepq a cytoplasmic prolidase that specifically liberated proline from  di-peptides increased activity, while pepx (x-prolyl-dipeptidyl aminopeptidase) and pepi (iminopeptidase) activities were unaffected. our data suggest that proline- and glutamate-containing peptides may contribute to the adaptation of o. oeni to high salt through their intracellular hydrolysis and/or direct accumulation.

TI  == use of lemon extract to inhibit the growth of malolactic bacteria.
AB  == the potential use of lemon extract as a natural preservative to inhibit the growth of oenococcus oeni and lactobacillus plantarum, microorganisms involved in the malotactic fermentation of wine, was studied. growth tests were run at 30 degrees c using laboratory media. carbon dioxide concentration in the vial headspace was used as metabolic activity index of the investigated microorganisms. the mic and the noninhibiting concentration (nic) were calculated for each microorganism. results suggest that lemon extract was active on each phase of the growth cycle for the tested microorganisms. it was also shown that lemon extract exhibits a nonlinear dose-related inhibitory effect on microbial growth. in particular, the active compound could be added at concentrations slightly higher than the nic levels in order to appreciably slow down the microbial growth rate as well as to reduce the maximum microbial growth level.

AB  == in order to monitor lactobacillus plantarum and oenococcus oeni in red wine produced with italian grape (variety "primitivo di puglia"), a polymerase chain reaction- denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge) approach using the rpob as gene target was established. wine was treated or not with potassium metabisulphite and supplemented with a commercial bacterial starter of o. oeni to encourage malolactic fermentation. samples were taken from the vinification tanks at 4, 10, 16, 22, and 28 days after the start of alcoholic fermentation. genomic  dna was directly isolated from wine and identification of lactic acid bacteria was performed using primers rpob1, rpob1o, and rpob2 able to amplify a region of  336 bp corresponding to the rpob gene. amplified fragments were separated in a 30-60% dgge gradient, and the ability of the pcr-dgge analysis to distinguish l.  plantarum and o. oeni was assessed. the results reported suggest that the pcr-dgge method, based on the rpob gene as molecular marker, is a reproducible and suitable tool and may be of great value for wine makers in order to monitor spoilage microorganisms during wine fermentation.

AB  == susceptibility to 12 antibiotics was tested in 75 unrelated lactic acid bacteria  strains of wine origin of the following species: 38 lactobacillus plantarum, 3 lactobacillus hilgardii, 2 lactobacillus paracasei, 1 lactobacillus sp, 21 oenococcus oeni, 4 pediococcus pentosaceus, 2 pediococcus parvulus, 1 pediococcus acidilactici, and 3 leuconostoc mesenteroides. the minimal inhibitory concentrations of the different antibiotics that inhibited 50% of the strains of  the lactobacillus, leuconostoc and pediococcus genera were, respectively, the following ones: penicillin (2, < or =0.5, and < or =0.5 microg/ml), erythromycin  (< or =0.5 microg/ml), chloramphenicol (4 microg/ml), ciprofloxacin (64, 8, and 128 microg/ml), vancomycin (> or =128 microg/ml), tetracycline (8, 2, and 8 microg/ml), streptomycin (256, 32, and 512 microg/ml), gentamicin (64, 4, and 128 microg/ml), kanamycin (256, 64, and 512 microg/ml), sulfamethoxazole (> or =1024  microg/ml), and trimethoprim (16 microg/ml). all 21 o. oeni showed susceptibility to erythromycin, tetracycline, rifampicin and chloramphenicol, and exhibited resistance to aminoglycosides, vancomycin, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim, that could represent intrinsic resistance. differences were observed among the o. oeni strains with respect to penicillin or ciprofloxacin susceptibility. antibiotic resistance genes were studied by pcr and sequencing, and the following genes were detected: erm(b) (one p. acidilactici), tet(m) (one l. plantarum), tet(l) (one p. parvulus), aac(6')-aph(2") (four l. plantarum, one p. parvulus, one p. pentosaceus and two o. oeni), ant(6) (one l. plantarum, and two p. parvulus), and aph(3')-iiia (one l. plantarum and one o. oeni). this is the first time, to our knowledge, that ant(6), aph(3')-iiia and tet(l) genes are found in lactobacillus and pediococcus strains and antimicrobial resistance genes are reported in o. oeni strains.

TI  == lactobacillus plantarum gene clusters encoding putative cell-surface protein complexes for carbohydrate utilization are conserved in specific gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == background: genomes of gram-positive bacteria encode many putative cell-surface proteins, of which the majority has no known function. from the rapidly increasing number of available genome sequences it has become apparent that many  cell-surface proteins are conserved, and frequently encoded in gene clusters or operons, suggesting common functions, and interactions of multiple components. results: a novel gene cluster encoding exclusively cell-surface proteins was identified, which is conserved in a subgroup of gram-positive bacteria. each gene cluster generally has one copy of four new gene families called csca, cscb, cscc  and cscd. clusters encoding these cell-surface proteins were found only in complete genomes of lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus sakei, enterococcus faecalis, listeria innocua, listeria monocytogenes, lactococcus lactis ssp lactis and bacillus cereus and in incomplete genomes of l. lactis ssp cremoris, lactobacillus casei, enterococcus faecium, pediococcus pentosaceus, lactobacillius brevis, oenococcus oeni, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and bacillus thuringiensis. these genes are neither present in the genomes of streptococci, staphylococci and clostridia, nor in the lactobacillus acidophilus group, suggesting a niche-specific distribution, possibly relating to association with plants. all encoded proteins have a signal peptide for secretion by the sec-dependent pathway, while some have cell-surface anchors, novel wxl domains, and putative domains for sugar binding and degradation. transcriptome analysis in l. plantarum shows that the csca-d genes are co-expressed, supporting their operon organization. many gene clusters are significantly up-regulated in a glucose-grown, ccpa-mutant derivative of l. plantarum, suggesting catabolite control. this is supported by the presence of predicted cre-sites upstream or inside the up-regulated csca-d gene clusters. conclusion: we propose that the csca, cscb, cscc and cscd proteins form cell-surface protein complexes and play a role in carbon source acquisition. primary occurrence in plant-associated gram-positive bacteria suggests a possible role in degradation and utilization of plant oligo- or poly-saccharides.

TI  == characterization of islpl4, a functional insertion sequence in lactobacillus plantarum.
AB  == a lactobacillus plantarum strain, cect 4645, was found to have insertions of a sequence (985 bp in length) at least in eight loci in its genome. the prototype copy (lp1) of this insertion sequence (named islpl4) has one open reading frame encoding a putative protein that is 292 amino acids in length with significant levels of similarity with is982 family transposases. perfect 16-bp inverted repeats were found at its termini. upon transposition, generates 8-bp direct repeats of the target sequence, but no consensus sequences could be identified at either insertion site. the islpl4 pattern changed over many generations on the cect 4645 strain. this finding strongly supports our hypothesis that islpl4 is a  functional element in l. plantarum. some of these elements may be cryptic, since  point mutation or 1-nucleotide deletions were found in their transposase encoding genes. islpl4 copies have been detected in leuconostoc mesenteroides, oenococcus  oeni, and lactobacillus sakei. an islpl4 copy of o. oeni contained a +1 nucleotide insertion on its transposase encoding gene and, by using an experimental system, we were able to demonstrate that this specific sequence originates a +1 programmed translational frameshifting. although the frameshifting process reported here operates at a low rate, this description might represent the first case of a functional +1 frameshifting among is.

TI  == wine volatile and amino acid composition after malolactic fermentation: effect of oenococcus oeni and lactobacillus plantarum starter cultures.
AB  == red wine amino acids and volatile compounds were analyzed before and after malolactic fermentation carried out by four different starter cultures of the species oenococcus oeni and lactobacillus plantarum. the purpose of this study was to determine whether differences can be attributed to the lactic acid bacteria strain used in this important step of the wine-making process. the malolactic cultures selected for this study were indigenous wine lactic acid bacteria strains. the data were evaluated using different multivariate analysis techniques. results showed different malolactic behaviors for o. oeni and l. plantarum and significant metabolic differences between both species. a degree of diversity was found within each lactic acid bacteria group, since wines presented specific characteristics depending on the lactic acid bacteria strain used. in all cases, malolactic fermentation seemed to modify the amino acid and volatile composition of the wine.

TI  == a beta-glucosidase gene isolated from wine lactobacillus plantarum is regulated by abiotic stresses.
AB  == aims: little genetic information exists on the ability of wine lactic acid bacteria (lab) to hydrolyse glycoconjugates during malolactic fermentation. we tried to fill this important gap by characterizing a gene codifying for a putative beta-glucosidase enzyme from wine lactobacillus plantarum and from a commercial strain of oenococcus oeni. methods and results: the coding region of the putative beta-glucosidase gene is 1400 nucleotides long and started with an atg codon. the gene is widespread among lab and the highest identity was observed between the nucleotide of l. plantarum, lactobacillus pentosus, lactobacillus paraplantarum and o. oenibeta-glucosidase gene. the protein sequence deduced from the isolated genes has a calculated molecular mass of 61.19 kda. furthermore, the expression of the beta-glucosidase gene in l. plantarum strain was analysed, under several stress, by reverse transcriptase (rt)-pcr and northern-blot analysis. the gene was apparently regulated by abiotic stresses such as temperature, ethanol and ph. conclusions: the beta-glucosidase gene is widespread among lab and its expression is probably regulated by a wide range of abiotic stresses. significance and impact of the study: the inhibitory effect of temperature and ethanol on the l. plantarumbeta-glucosidase gene may be useful to explain the differences found in beta-glucosidase activity reported in wines by several authors.

TI  == identification of lactic acid bacteria isolated from south african brandy base wines.
AB  == in brandy base wines, no sulphur dioxide is used and it therefore is ideal for the proliferation of lactic acid bacteria. as part of an extensive taxonomic survey within the ecological framework of south african vineyards and wineries, and the influence of naturally occurring lactic acid bacteria on the quality of wine and brandy, a total of 54 strains were isolated from grape juice and at different stages of brandy base wine production. the strains were identified using numerical analysis of total soluble cell protein patterns, 16s rrna sequence analyses and polymerase chain reaction (pcr) using species-specific primers. the predominant species was oenococcus oeni (22 strains), but lactobacillus brevis (8 strains), lactobacillus paracasei (8 strains) and lactobacillus plantarum (6 strains) were also isolated frequently. many of the o. oeni strains were isolated from brandy base wines after completion of spontaneous malolactic fermentation (mlf). the lactobacillus spp. were isolated from all the  different stages of brandy base wine production. lb. plantarum was the dominant species in the juice, but disappeared during the later stages of production. however, lactobacillus hilgardii, lb. brevis and lb. paracasei were also isolated from base wine after spontaneous mlf. strains identified as lactobacillus vermiforme were isolated during the alcoholic fermentation and after mlf have been completed. total soluble cell protein patterns grouped o. oeni strains into  two phenotypic groups. two phenotypic clusters have also been identified for the  lb. brevis isolates. the lb. paracasei isolates all grouped in one cluster. this  is the first report of the presence of lb. paracasei and lb. vermiforme in brandy base wines. the presence of the lactobacillus spp. could be correlated to the decrease in quality of the base wine and distillate, while o. oeni strains were found to have a more favourable influence on the quality of base wine and distillates. these results shed some light on the ecology and oenological influence of lactic acid bacteria (lab) on the quality of south african brandy.

TI  == molecular characterization of lactic acid populations associated with wine spoilage.
AB  == we have investigated the prevalence of spoilage lactic acid bacteria (lab) in table wines produced in the apulia region. the occurrence of lab was evaluated in wines produced with low sulphur dioxide doses and not supplemented with selected  malolactic starters such as oenococcus oeni. about 150 strains were isolated from wine must and a molecular characterization was performed using pcr-based techniques. most of the strains analysed belonged to lactobacillus plantarum species. however, some of the strains were identified as pediococcus damnosus and leuconostoc sp. the amplified fragments of pediococcus damnosus were cloned and sequenced. the coding sequence was highly homologous to that of the ropy plasmid  confirming that the isolated strain was a ropy(+) pediococcus damnosus. in all the samples analysed, the final must ph value reached was relatively high (from 3.78 to 3.90). the high ph values had probably negatively influenced (counteracted) the activity of sulphur dioxide added, allowing proliferation of spoilage wine microorganisms.

TI  == high tolerance of wild lactobacillus plantarum and oenococcus oeni strains to lyophilisation and stress environmental conditions of acid ph and ethanol.
AB  == a total of 76 lactobacillus plantarum and oenococcus oeni wild strains were recovered from traditionally elaborated spanish red wines and were investigated with respect to their response to acid ph, lyophilisation, temperature and ethanol concentrations which are normally lethal to lactic acid bacteria. both l. plantarum and o. oeni strains were able to grow at ph 3.2, were highly resistant  to lyophilisation treatment and proliferated in the presence of up to 13% ethanol at 18 degrees c. therefore, it is shown that both species are highly tolerant to  stress conditions and that similarly to o. oeni strains, l. plantarum strains are of interest in beverage biotechnology.

TI  == molecular analysis of the lysis protein lys encoded by lactobacillus plantarum phage phig1e.
AB  == the putative cell-lysis gene lys of lactobacillus plantarum g1e phage phig1e encodes for a 442 amino-acids protein lys. the n-terminal region (about 80 amino  acids) of lys consists of two discrete regions (the signal-peptide-like domain and the de domain containing putative active sites of endolysin). to elucidate functions of the regions of lys, mutational (random, site-directed, and/or fusion) analysis was performed. the plasmid pndehl, expressing the wild type lys  protein under promoter of lacz' gene in escherichia coli, was constructed. two molecular species (44 kda; referred to as pre-lys, and 42 kda; mature-lys) from the protein extract of xl1-blue/pndehl were detected on a sodium dodecyl sulfate  gel and zymogram with l. plantarum g1e cells. based on the n-terminal amino acid  sequences, the two molecules were determined as; pre-lys (the amino acid position deduced from lys gene, 1-7) mklknkl, mature-lys (27-33) qtlssqs. the mature lys was hardly detected in the cells treated with sodium azide. these results suggested that the n-terminal 26 amino acids region of lys precursor form is possibly processed posttranslationally, by a seca-dependent manner at least in e. coli. analysis of the point mutants (pld36a, ple39a, ple55a, ple67a and pld71a),  indicated that the acidic residues (aspartic acids at position 36, 71 and glutamic acids at position 39, 55) of n-terminal region and the serine at the position 48 of phig1e lys are essential for the lytic activity.

TI  == isolation, purification and partial characterization of plantaricin 423, a bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus plantarum.
AB  == lactobacillus plantarum 423, isolated from sorghum beer, produces a bacteriocin (plantaricin 423) which is inhibitory to several food spoilage bacteria and food-borne pathogens, including bacillus cereus, clostridium sporogenes, enterococcus faecalis, listeria spp. and staphylococcus spp. plantaricin 423 is resistant to treatment at 80 degrees c, but loses 50% of its activity after 60 min at 100 degrees c and 75% of its activity after autoclaving (121 degrees c, 15 min). plantaricin 423 remains active after incubation at ph 1-10 and is inactivated when treated with pepsin, papain, alpha-chymotrypsin, trypsin and proteinase k. plantaricin 423 was partially purified and its size estimated at 3.5 kda, as determined by tricine-sds-page. the mechanism of activity of plantaricin 423 is weakly bactericidal, as determined against oenococcus oeni (previously leuconostoc oenos). high dna homology was obtained between the plasmid dna of strain 423 and the pediocin pa-1 operon of pediococcus acidilactici pac 1.0, suggesting that plantaricin 423 is plasmid-encoded and related to the pediocin gene cluster.
