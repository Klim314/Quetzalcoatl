TI  == [growth and morphological characteristics of industrial strains of bifidobacterium and lactobacillus cultivated in hydrolysate-milk and hydrolysate-soybean media].
AB  == growth features of industrial strains of bifidobacterium adolescentis mc-42, b. bifidum 1, b. longum b-379, lactobacillus acidophilus, l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus 8-79 and l. plantarum 8pa3 cultivated in hydrolysate-milk or hydrolysate-soybean media (hmm and hsm respectively) were analysed comparatively. the bacterial cells were investigated morphometrically with atom strength microscopy. it was shown that hsm vs hmm provided a higher growth rate of the strains (shortened growth phases and higher growth rates) that was more evident for the bifidobacteria as compared to the lactobacilli. at the same time, the morphological features of the bacterial cells slightly depended on the medium composition and were mainly defined by the genus.

TI  == note: evaluation of selective media for the enumeration of bifidobacterium sp. in milk.
AB  == pure cultures of three species of bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium longum, bif. adolescentis and bif. bifidum), lactobacillus acidophilus and a mixed culture of  lact. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus were each enumerated on two differential media and six selective media for the enumeration of bifidobacteria. the appearance of the colonies on the differential media was as expected but when mixed cultures were present, it proved extremely difficult to distinguish one species from another. of the selective media, amc, rms, npnl and bl-og performed well in that they gave good recoveries of bifidobacteria and were inhibitory to the growth of lact. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, strep. salivarius subsp. thermophilus and lact. acidophilus. however, of these four media, amc was most convenient as it is based on a commercially available medium, whereas the others must be made up from individual constituents. the amc agar is thus a good choice for the routine enumeration of bifidobacteria from mixed cultures.
