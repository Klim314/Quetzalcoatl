oxantel disrupts polymicrobial biofilm development of periodontal pathogens.
bacterial pathogens commonly associated with chronic periodontitis are the spirochete treponema denticola and the gram-negative, proteolytic species porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythia. these species rely on complex anaerobic respiration of amino acids, and the anthelmintic drug oxantel has been shown to inhibit fumarate reductase (frd) activity in some pathogenic bacteria and inhibit p. gingivalis homotypic biofilm formation. here, we demonstrate that oxantel inhibited p. gingivalis frd activity with a 50% inhibitory concentration (ic50) of 2.2 mum and planktonic growth of t. forsythia with a mic of 295 mum, but it had no effect on the growth of t. denticola. oxantel treatment caused the downregulation of six p. gingivalis gene products and the upregulation of 22 gene products. all of these genes are part of a regulon controlled by heme availability. there was no large-scale change in the expression of genes encoding metabolic enzymes, indicating that p. gingivalis may be unable to overcome frd inhibition. oxantel disrupted the development of polymicrobial biofilms composed of p. gingivalis, t. forsythia, and t. denticola in a concentration-dependent manner. in these biofilms, all three species were inhibited to a similar degree, demonstrating the synergistic nature of biofilm formation by these species and the dependence of t. denticola on the other two species. in a murine alveolar bone loss model of periodontitis oxantel addition to the drinking water of p. gingivalis-infected mice reduced bone loss to the same level as the uninfected control.
differential proteomic analysis of a polymicrobial biofilm.
porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia exist in  a polymicrobial biofilm associated with chronic periodontitis. the aim of this study was to culture these three species as a polymicrobial biofilm and to determine proteins important for bacterial interactions. in a flow cell all three species attached and grew as a biofilm; however, after 90 h of culture p. gingivalis and t. denticola were closely associated and dominated the polymicrobial biofilm. for comparison, planktonic cultures of p. gingivalis and t. denticola were grown separately in continuous culture. whole cell lysates were subjected to sds-page, followed by in-gel proteolytic h(2)(1)(6)o/h(2)(1)(8)o labeling. from two replicates, 135 and 174 p. gingivalis proteins and 134 and 194 t. denticola proteins were quantified by lc-maldi tof/tof ms. the results suggest a change of strategy in iron acquisition by p. gingivalis due to large increases in the abundance of husa and husb in the polymicrobial biofilm while hmuy and other iron/haem transport systems decreased. significant changes in the abundance of peptidases and enzymes involved in glutamate and glycine catabolism suggest syntrophy. these data indicate an intimate association between p. gingivalis and t. denticola in a biofilm that may play a role in disease pathogenesis.
periodontal pathogens interfere with quorum-sensing-dependent virulence properties in streptococcus mutans.
background and objective: the mechanism by which periodontal pathogens dominate at disease sites is not yet understood. one possibility is that these late colonizers antagonize the quorum-sensing systems of early colonizers and render those early colonizers less resistant to environmental factors. in this study, we utilized streptococcus mutans, a well-documented oral streptococcus with many quorum-sensing-dependent properties, as an example of an earlier colonizer antagonized by periodontal pathogens. material and methods: in this study, s. mutans ng8 and s. mutans lt11 were used in experiments assessing transformation, and s. mutans bm71 was used in experiments investigating bacteriocin production. the effects of the periodontal pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola on these competence-stimulating peptide-dependent properties were evaluated in mixed-broth assays. results: both p. gingivalis (either live bacteria or membrane vesicles) and t. denticola antagonized transformation in s. mutans ng8 and lt11. the production of bacteriocin by s. mutans bm71 was also inhibited by p. gingivalis and t. denticola. boiling of these late colonizers before addition to the broth cultures abolished their ability to inhibit s. mutans transformation and bacteriocin production. p. gingivalis and t. denticola inactivated s. mutans exogenous competence-stimulating peptide, whereas the boiled bacteria did not. conclusions: this study demonstrated that periodontal pathogens antagonize s. mutans quorum-sensing properties. this may render s. mutans less virulent and less resistant to environmental antibacterial factors.
microbial changes in patients with acute periodontal abscess after treatment detected by padotest.
aims: to investigate changes in bacterial counts in subgingival plaque from patients with acute periodontal abscess by iai-padotest. materials and methods: ninety-one patients were randomly allocated to either test or control groups. in all the patients, pockets with acute periodontal abscess were irrigated with sterilized physiological saline, and in the test group, 2% minocycline hydrochloride ointment was applied once into the pocket in addition. subgingival plaque samples were collected by paper point before treatment and 7 days after treatment. the total bacterial count was determined and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia, were detected using iai-padotest, a dna/rna probe method. results: the total bacterial count decreased in both groups, with a significant decrease in the test group. the counts and number of sites positive for p. gingivalis, t. forsythia and t. denticola significantly decreased in the test group after treatment, compared with those in the control group. pocket depth decreased in the both groups, with a statistically significant decrease in the test group. conclusion: topical treatment with minocycline in pockets with acute periodontal abscess was effective in reducing the bacterial counts as shown by the microbiological investigation using padotest 4.5.
inhibitory effects of macrocarpals on the biological activity of porphyromonas gingivalis and other periodontopathic bacteria.
background/aims: macrocarpals, which are phloroglucinol derivatives contained in  eucalyptus leaves, exhibit antimicrobial activity against a variety of bacteria including oral bacteria. this study examined effects of macrocarpals a, b, and c on periodontopathic bacteria, especially porphyromonas gingivalis. methods: macrocarpals a, b, and c were purified from a 60% ethanol-extract of eucalyptus globules leaves. to investigate antibacterial activity, representative periodontopathic bacteria were cultured in media with or without various amounts of macrocarpals; subsequently, the optical density at 660 nm was measured. macrocarpal inhibition of p. gingivalis arg- and lys-specific proteinases was assessed by spectrofluorophotometric assay and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis. the effect of macrocarpals on p. gingivalis binding to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite beads was examined with (3)h-labeled p. gingivalis. results: growth of p. gingivalis was inhibited more strongly than growth of prevotella intermedia or prevotella nigrescens and treponema denticola by macrocarpals, however, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and fusobacterium nucleatum were much more resistant. macrocarpals inhibited p. gingivalis arg- and lys-specific proteinases in a dose-dependent manner. the enzyme-inhibitory effect of macrocarpals was confirmed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis in which hemoglobin degradation by p. gingivalis proteinase was inhibited by macrocarpals. p. gingivalis binding to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite beads was also strongly attenuated by macrocarpals. conclusions: macrocarpals a, b and c demonstrated antibacterial activity against periodontopathic bacteria. among tested bacteria, p. gingivalis displayed the greatest sensitivity to macrocarpals; additionally, its trypsin-like proteinase activity and binding to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite beads were inhibited by macrocarpals. these results indicate that eucalyptus leaf extracts may be useful as a potent preventative of periodontal disease.
debridement and local application of tetracycline-loaded fibres in the management of persistent periodontitis: results after 12 months.
backgrounds/aims: the aim of our study was to evaluate the clinical, radiological and microbiological response to the local delivery of tetracycline (te) of sites with persistent periodontal lesions. materials and methods: the study was conducted in a split-mouth design. nineteen patients with at least four bilateral pockets 4-5 mm and bleeding on probing (bop) were treated with scaling and root planing (srp) plus te fibres (test sites) or with srp alone (control sites). clinical and radiological measurements were taken at baseline, 6 months and 12 months post-operatively. subgingival plaque samples were collected at baseline, at fibres removal, 6 and 12 months following treatment and analysed by polymerase chain reaction. results: both treatments yielded a statistically significant (p<0.05) reduction of probing depth (2.05 and 1.21 mm), gain of clinical attachment level (1.71 and 0.53 mm) and reduction of bop scores (23.68% and 57.89%) for te and srp groups, respectively, when comparing 12-month data with baseline. the differences between two groups were significant. the prevalence of treponema denticola and bacteroides forsythus decreased after therapy in both groups but only in the test sites actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and prevotella intermedia were not yield detected. the pathogens could be eliminated from five periodontal pockets by srp alone, while 21 te sites were not recolonized at 12 months. conclusions: srp plus te fibres gave the greatest advantage in the treatment of periodontal persistent lesions at least 12 months following treatment.
the effects of extracts from periodontopathic bacteria on human periodontal fibroblasts stimulated with mineralization supplements.
bacterial effects on in vitro mineralization of human periodontal fibroblasts (hpf) have not yet been examined in great detail. in our study, we investigated the effects of soluble extracts of the periodontopathic bacteria porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus and, treponema denticola on cell proliferation, mineralization, as well as on osteoblastic markers present in hpf cultured in vitro, such as alkaline phosphatase (alp) activity and collagen content. periodontal fibroblasts stimulated by b-glycerophosphate, ascorbic acid and dexamethasone (bad) or by dexamethasone and ascorbic acid (da) were compared to unstimulated cells. during the cultivation period, the stimulation of hpf by combined dexamethasone and ascorbic acid (da) had a strong inductive effect on proliferation, alp activity and collagen formation. the extracts obtained from the periodontal pathogens had a suppressing effect on the proliferation rate of hpf. the extracts from p. gingivalis, b. forsythus and t. denticola caused a decrease in alp activity within 24 h of application. while extracts obtained from p. gingivalis and b. forsythus induced a reduction in collagen content in bad- and da-stimulated hpf cells, t. denticola extracts led to an increase in collagen. our data suggest that specific periodontopathic bacteria may suppress tissue regeneration in vivo not only by activating host defense mechanisms but also directly via a suppression of growth and differentiation of hpf and a reduction in the extracellular collagen matrix. for the process of pocket formation, not even the direct influence of viable bacteria seems to be necessary. additionally, long-distance effects of bacteria harboured in periodontal pockets or in root canals may be of importance.
role for recombinant gamma-glutamyltransferase from treponema denticola in glutathione metabolism.
volatile sulfur compounds, including hydrogen sulfide (h(2)s), have been implicated in the development of periodontal disease. glutathione is an important thiol source for h(2)s production in periodontal pockets. our recent studies have delineated a pathway of glutathione metabolism in treponema denticola that releases h(2)s. in this pathway, gamma-glutamyltransferase (ggt) has been proposed to catalyze the first step of glutathione degradation. we have cloned the gene of ggt from t. denticola, which contains an open reading frame of 726 bp encoding a protein of 241 amino acids. transformation of this gene into escherichia coli led to the expression of a recombinant protein. after purification by chromatography, the recombinant protein showed enzymatic activity typical of ggt, catalyzing the degradation of na-gamma-glutamyl-4-nitroaniline (gna) and the hydrolysis of glutathione, releasing glutamic acid or glutamine and cysteinylglycine. l-cysteine is not a substrate of ggt. importantly, gna, when added to t. denticola, was able to compete with glutathione and inhibit the production of h(2)s, ammonia, and pyruvate. this was accompanied by the suppression of hemoxidative and hemolytic activities of the bacteria. purified ggt was inactivated by tlck (nalpha-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone) and proteinase k treatment. however, higher enzymatic activity was demonstrated in the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol and dithiothreitol. our further experiments showed that the addition of recombinant ggt to porphyromonas gingivalis, a bacterium without significant glutathione-metabolizing capacity, drastically increased the utilization of glutathione by the bacterium, producing h(2)s, ammonia, and pyruvate. this was again accompanied by enhanced bacterial hemoxidative and hemolytic activities. together, the results suggest an important role for ggt in glutathione metabolism in oral bacteria.
the effect of srp on the clinical and microbiological parameters of periodontal diseases.
the purpose of the present investigation was to examine the effect of srp on clinical and microbiological parameters in 57 subjects with adult periodontitis (mean age 47 +/- 11 years). subjects were monitored clinically and microbiologically prior to and 3, 6 and 9 months after full-mouth srp under local anaesthesia. clinical assessments of plaque, redness, suppuration, bop, pocket depth and attachment level were made at 6 sites per tooth. the means of duplicate attachment level measurements taken at each visit were used to assess change between visits. clinical data were averaged within each subject and then averaged across subjects for each visit. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth and the presence and levels of 40 subgingival taxa were determined using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. the mean levels and % of sites colonized by each species (prevalence) was computed for each subject at each visit. differences in clinical and microbiological parameters before and after srp were sought using the wilcoxon signed ranks test or the quade test for more than 2 visits. overall, there was a mean gain in attachment level of 0.11 +/- 0.23 mm (range -0.53 to 0.64 mm) 3 months post-therapy. there was a significant decrease in the % of sites exhibiting gingival redness (68 to 57%) and bop (58 to 52%) as well as a mean (+/-sem) pocket depth (3.3 +/- 0.06 to 3.1 +/- 0.05 mm). sites with pre-therapy pocket depths of < 4 mm showed a non-significant increase in pocket depth and attachment level, 4.6 mm pockets showed a significant decrease in pocket depth and a non-significant gain in attachment post-therapy, while > 6 mm pockets showed a significant decrease in pocket depth and attachment level measurements post-therapy. significant clinical improvements were seen in subjects who had never smoked or were past smokers but not in current smokers. mean prevalences and levels of p. gingivalis, t. denticola and b. forsythus were significantly reduced after srp, while a. viscosus showed a significant increase in mean levels. the mean decrease in prevalence of p. gingivalis was similar at all pocket depth categories, while b. forsythus decreased more at shallow and intermediate pockets and a. viscosus increased most at deep sites. p. gingivalis. b. forsythus and t. denticola were equally prevalent among current, past and never smokers pre-therapy, decreased significantly post-srp in never and past smokers but increased in current smokers. clinical improvement post-srp was accompanied by a modest change in the subgingival microbiota, primarily a reduction in p. gingivalis, b. forsythus and t. denticola, suggesting potential targets for therapy and indicating that radical alterations in the subgingival microbiota may not be necessary or desirable in many patients.
coaggregation between porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola.
to elucidate an ecological profile of several periodontopathogens, the authors examined the coaggregation between cells of porphyromonas gingivalis and oral bacterial strains including treponema denticola in vitro. coaggregation between cells of plaque bacteria was examined by visual assay and phase-contrast microscope. p. gingivalis cells coaggregated with strains of t. denticola and treponema socranskii subspecies socranskii, but did not coaggregate with t. socranskii subspecies buccale, t. socranskii subspecies paredis, treponema vincentii, or treponema pectinovorum. the extracted hemagglutinin from p. gingivalis was active agglutinating t. denticola cells. addition of serum and saliva somewhat affected the coaggregation, but no effects of tested sugars or amino acids were found. heat treatment of t. denticola cells did not reduce the coagregation: heat treatment of p. gingivalis cells eliminated it. growth inhibitory activity among these bacterial species was examined by the stab culture method. strains of t. denticola atcc 35404 and 35405 and t. vincentii inhibited the growth of some p. gingivalis strains, but not others. no strain of treponema was inhibited by black-pigmented anaerobic rods. the coaggregation observed between p. gingivalis and t. denticola indicates the potential importance of their simultaneous existence in human periodontal pockets and development of the disease.
detection of porphyromonas gingivalis in gingival exudate by a dipeptide-enhanced trypsin-like activity.
porphyromonas gingivalis in subgingival plaque is an important risk factor for future periodontal attachment loss in susceptible adults. the elimination of p. gingivalis is usually concomitant with a healing process. therefore, it should be valuable to have an easy chairside method to follow the effect of periodontal treatment on p. gingivalis detection as well as on its eventual reappearance during the maintenance period. we have previously reported the stimulation of amidolytic activity of p. gingivalis by the addition of glycyl-glycine to the assay buffer. in this study we determined the proportions of p. gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, capnocytophaga spp, campylobacter rectus, and eikenella corrodens by cultivation technique and the amidolytic activity, using n-benzoyl-l-arginine-p-nitroanilide (bapna) as substrate, in gingival exudate before and during a 3-year treatment and maintenance period. p. gingivalis was the only species yielding a high and persistent correlation to stimulated amidolytic activity (p values < or = 0.0001) on both site (r = 0.5) and subject (r = 0.8) level. testing pure cultures of suggested periodontal pathogens for effect of glycyl-glycine on amidolytic activity, we found that of p. gingivalis to be 5.9-fold increased. the amidolytic activity of treponema denticola was only slightly stimulated (ratio with/without glycyl-glycine = 1.2) and that of capnocytophaga slightly inhibited (ratio with/without glycyl-glycine = 0.8). the outcome of this study has the potential to be used for the development of a simple, rapid, and inexpensive assay for a qualitative and quantitative determination of p. gingivalis in gingival crevicular fluid.
inhibition of peptidase and glycosidase activities of porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides intermedius and treponema denticola by plant extracts.
aqueous extracts from 5 plants used widely in kenya as chewing sticks (mswaki) for the control of oral hygiene were tested for their ability to inhibit extracellular peptidase and glycosidase enzyme activities produced by the periodontopathic bacteria porphyromonas gingivalis (formerly bacteroides gingivalis), bacteroides intermedius and treponema denticola. the plants studied were rhus natalensis, cupressus hisitanica, sida cordifolia, olea africana and euclea divinorum. protease activities, including glycylprolyl dipeptidase and trypsin-like activities of p. gingivalis, chymotrypsin-like and glycylprolyl dipeptidase activities of b. intermedius and the trypsin-like activity of t. denticola, were particularly affected by extracts from rhus natalensis and euclea divinorum. glycosidase activities were generally less affected with the notable exceptions of the inhibition of beta-mannosidase activity of p. gingivalis by all extracts and the inhibition of neuraminidase activity of t. denticola by rhus natalensis and euclea divinorum. generally, these same proteolytic and glycosidic activities were inhibited by tannic acid and to lesser extents by gallic acid and gallic acid methyl ester. an inhibitory component, present in all extracts, exhibited physical and chemical properties identical to those of tannic acid. the inhibition of these enzyme activities is likely to reduce the virulence of these periodontophathic bacteria and to reduce the rate of dental plaque formation.
treponema denticola and porphyromonas gingivalis as prognostic markers following  periodontal treatment.
subgingival plaque samples were collected from individuals with advanced periodontitis before and 3 to 11 weeks after scaling and root planing periodontal treatment. the plaque levels of treponema denticola and porphyromonas gingivalis antigens were measured before and after treatment by a quantitative immunoassay procedure using monoclonal antibodies specific for these oral bacteria. a decrease in mean levels of t. denticola (p less than .05) and p. gingivalis antigens (p less than .09) were observed following periodontal therapy. improved health, as measured by a decrease in probing depth, was associated with a decrease in t. denticola antigen (p less than .05). these results suggest that the t. denticola levels of successfully treated sites decreased, while non-responding sites had levels of this microbial marker which were equal to or greater than the pre-treatment levels. these results provide additional evidence that t. denticola is associated with human adult severe periodontal disease, and can serve as a prognostic marker for disease recurrence.
