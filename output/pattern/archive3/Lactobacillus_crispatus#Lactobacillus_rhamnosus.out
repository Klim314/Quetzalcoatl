inhibition of hiv and hsv infection by vaginal lactobacilli in vitro and in vivo.
background and the purpose of the study: the cervico-vaginal mucosa which is populated with microflora (mostly includes lactobacilli) is the portal of entry for sexually transmitted pathogens. methods: the in vitro anti-viral effect of vaginal and non-vaginal lactobacillus was evaluated using single cycle hiv-1 replication and hsv-2 plaque reduction assays. the xtt proliferation assay was used to monitor the cellular toxicity. the in vivo anti-hsv-1 activity was evaluated in balb/c mouse model by monitoring skin lesion and immune response development. results and major conclusion: dmem culture supernatant of l. gasseri and l. fermentum (ph 7.3) did not show toxic effect but inhibited 50% of hiv replication at 12 and 31% concentrations, respectively. co-culture of l. gasseri (1000 cfu/ target cell) showed mild cytotoxicity but inhibited 68% of hiv replication. the supernatant of l. crispatus inhibited 50% of hsv replication at 4% and also co-culture of l. gasseri, l. rhamnosus and l. crispatus revokes almost all of the hsv multiplication. culture supernatants of l. gasseri and l. crispatus had significant virucidal effect against the hiv and hsv and inhibited hsv infection in a stage before viral entry to the target cells. alive l. gasseri cells showed high potential for inhibiting hsv-1 infection in vivo condition. current data indicates that lactobacilli supernatant encompasses components with neutralizing activity against hiv and hsv and it would be a determinant factor for viral diseases transmission and promising lead for anti-viral probiotic design.
glutamine synthetase and glucose-6-phosphate isomerase are adhesive moonlighting  proteins of lactobacillus crispatus released by epithelial cathelicidin ll-37.
glutamine synthetase (gs) and glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (gpi) were identified as novel adhesive moonlighting proteins of lactobacillus crispatus st1. both proteins were bound onto the bacterial surface at acidic phs, whereas a suspension of the cells to ph 8 caused their release into the buffer, a pattern previously observed with surface-bound enolase and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh) of l. crispatus. the ph shift was associated with a rapid and transient increase in cell wall permeability, as measured by cell staining with propidium iodide. a gradual increase in the release of the four moonlighting proteins was also observed after the treatment of l. crispatus st1 cells with increasing concentrations of the antimicrobial cationic peptide ll-37, which kills bacteria by disturbing membrane integrity and was here observed to increase the cell wall permeability of l. crispatus st1. at ph 4, the fusion proteins his(6)-gs, his(6)-gpi, his(6)-enolase, and his(6)-gapdh showed localized binding to cell division septa and poles of l. crispatus st1 cells, whereas no binding to lactobacillus rhamnosus gg was detected. strain st1 showed a ph-dependent adherence to the basement membrane preparation matrigel. purified his(6)-gs and his(6)-gpi proteins bound to type i collagen, and his(6)-gs also bound to laminin, and their level of binding was higher at ph 5.5 than at ph 6.5. his(6)-gs also expressed a plasminogen receptor function. the results show the strain-dependent surface association of moonlighting proteins in lactobacilli and that these proteins are released from the l. crispatus surface after cell trauma, under conditions of alkaline stress, or in the presence of the antimicrobial peptide ll-37 produced by human cells.
