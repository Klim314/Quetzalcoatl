oral administration of bifidobacterium longum prevents gut-derived pseudomonas aeruginosa sepsis in mice.
aims: the aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of probiotics on gut-derived sepsis caused by pseudomonas aeruginosa in immunocompromised mice. methods and results: after oral inoculation of p. aeruginosa, mice were treated with cyclophosphamide to induce leucopenia and translocation of the intestinal p. aeruginosa into blood, thereby producing gut-derived sepsis. in this model, administration of 1 x 10(9) cfu of bifidobacterium longum strain bb536 for 10 days significantly (p < 0.01) increased the survival rate compared with groups of mice administered either with bifidobacterium breve strain atcc 15700 or excipients contained in the probiotic bacterial powder. administration of b. longum significantly decreased viable counts of p. aeruginosa in the liver and blood compared with other groups. culture of intestinal contents revealed a significantly lower viable count of p. aeruginosa in the jejunum of b. longum-treated mice compared with other groups of mice. furthermore, in vitro data demonstrated that b. longum possessed apparently higher adherent activity to caco-2 cell monolayers and significantly suppressed the adherence of p. aeruginosa to the monolayers of cells compared with other groups. conclusion: oral administration of b. longum protects mice against gut-derived sepsis caused by p. aeruginosa, and the effect may be due to interference of p. aeruginosa adherence to intestinal epithelial cells. significance and impact of this study: this study demonstrated that oral administration of b. longum bb536 is effective to protect against opportunistic infection with drug-resistant bacteria such as p. aeruginosa. the results suggest that probiotics may play an important role even in the immunocompromised patients.
[the primary screening of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli strains to develop effective probiotic preparations based on them].
10 bifidobacterium strains and 10 lactobacillus strains were studied for their antagonistic activity with respect to escherichia coli, klebsiella ozaenae, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and for their sensitivity to antibiotics, widely used in clinical practice. l. acidophilus strain 5/4, l. acidophilus strain 18/4, b. adolescentis strain ux, b. longum strain 44 exhibited the highest antagonistic activity and the highest degree of antibiotic resistance. the restriction analysis of the chromosomal dna of these strains was then made and their plasmid content was studied, making it possible to recognize these strains in future in the course of in vivo experiments.
[the vaginal bifidobacterium flora in women of reproductive age].
the composition of vaginal bifidoflora in 56 clinically healthy women of reproductive age was studied. the study revealed that four species of bifidobacteria, viz. bifidobacterium bifidum, b. breve, b. adolescentis 2 and b. longum, dominated in the composition of this bifidobacterial population. nine out of 11 isolated strains were found to be capable of inhibiting indicator microorganisms staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis when tested in vitro; in addition, strains b. adolescentis 2 f1, b. bifidum g1, b. breve p2 and b. longum z4 inhibited klebsiella ozaenae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli and were also active acid producers. three of these 4 bifidobacterial strains were capable of adhesion to vaginal epitheliocytes, while b. bifidum g1 was practically incapable of adherence to these cells, similarly to b. bifidum strain 791 of intestinal origin. in addition, the spectra of antibiotic susceptibility varied from strain to strain, but all bifidobacterial strains were susceptible to benzylpenicillin and resistant to lomefloxacin, most of them being also resistant to cyprofloxacin and gentamicin. thus the data presented in this work are indicative of the possibility and advantages of using bifidobacterial strains belonging to this ecological niche as probiotics for the correction of the microflora of the urogenital tract in females.
