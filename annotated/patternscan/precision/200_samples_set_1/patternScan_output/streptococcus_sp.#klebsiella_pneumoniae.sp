TI  == biological activities of schefflera leucantha.
AB  == this study investigated various biological activities of the ethanolic extract of dried ground leaves of schefflera leucantha viguier (araliaceae). the extract possessed very low cytotoxicity to brine-shrimp with the lc(50) of 4,111.15 microg/ml; the significant antioxidant activity on dpph with the ec(50) of 71.90  microg/ml; the inhibitory activity on mushroom tyrosinase with the ic(50) of 10.53 mg/ml using the dopachrome microplate-assay. the extract of 5-20 mg/ml range in the agar dilution assay were active against various pathogenic microbial (11 species, 11 strains), with the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of 5 mg/ml against clostridium spp.; mic=10 mg/ml against enteropathogens as bacteroides spp., enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212, lactobacillus spp., peptococcus spp. and streptococcus mutans; mic=10 mg/ml against a pneumonia causing bacteria klebsiella pneumoniae and a dermatopathogen as propionibacterium acnes; mic=20 mg/ml against dermatopathogens as staphylococcus aureus atcc 6538,  streptococcus spp. and candida albicans atcc 90028. tlc fingerprints of the specific extracts from the leaf powder exhibited zones of steroids-terpenes and flavonoids. hplc fingerprint of the flavonoid extract was performed.
