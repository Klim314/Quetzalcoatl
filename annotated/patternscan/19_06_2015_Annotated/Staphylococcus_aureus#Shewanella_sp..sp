TI  == purification of a secreted lectin from andrias davidianus skin and its antibacterial activity.
AB  == a lectin secreted from andrias davidianus skin (adl) was purified by affinity chromatography on porcine stomach mucin (type iii) (psm)-crosslinked albumin, followed by gel filtration on sephadex g-100 and hplc on tsk gel g3000pwxl. the purified lectin was found to be a dimeric protein, as revealed by sds-page and maldi-tof analysis. sds-page showed that the adl protein had a molecular mass of  17 kda. adl produced an 8.5 kda band when examined using sds-page under reducing  conditions. adl agglutinated native and trypsinized human b erythrocytes. the hemagglutination activity was inhibited by glycoproteins, such as psm and asialo-psm, but not by any of the monosaccharides tested. the activity was stable between 4 degrees c and 50 degrees c. significant adl activity was observed between ph 4-5. the lectin reaction did not depend on the presence of the divalent cation ca2+ or mg2+. the n-terminal adl sequence was determined to be vgytvgatpm. the lectin exhibited antibacterial activity, involving growth and respiration inhibition in escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis and shewanella sp. furthermore, adl showed inhibition activity against the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae. these findings suggest that adl plays an important role in the innate immunity of a. davidianus on the body surface.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial analysis of phenoloxidase reaction products from the sea cucumber apostichopus japonicus.
AB  == three phenoloxidases (pos) of apostichopus japonicus, ajpos (ajpo1, ajpo2 and ajpo3), were partially purified from the coelomocytes with an electrophoretic method, and then employed for the in vitro antibacterial analysis. using l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (l-dopa) as a substrate, ajpo1 and ajpo2-derived compounds inhibited the growth of vibrio splendidus and staphylococcus aureus, while ajpo3-derived compounds only inhibited the growth of v. splendidus. when dopamine was used as a substrate, ajpo1 and ajpo3-derived compounds inhibited the growth of v. splendidus and vibrio harveyi, while ajpo2-derived compounds only inhibited the growth of v. splendidus. moreover, ajpo1-derived compounds showed stronger inhibition in v. harveyi than ajpo3-derived compounds did. however, all  of the three ajpo reaction products showed no inhibitions on the growth of pseudoalteromonas nigrifaciens, shewanella baltica, micrococcus lysodeikticus, streptococcus dysgalactiae and nocardiopsis sp. with l-dopa or dopamine as a substrate. scanning electron microscope (sem) observation of v. harveyi treated by ajpos and dopamine showed that ajpo1-derived compounds resulted in massive bacteriolysis, ajpo2-derived compounds caused no obvious alteration on bacterial  morphology, and ajpo3-derived compounds increased the ratio of spheroidal bacteria. all these results suggested that ajpo reaction products derived by l-dopa and dopamine had different but limited antibacterial spectrum, and the different antibacterial effects observed among three ajpos resulted from the different reaction products generated by ajpos with the same substrate.

TI  == antioxidant and antimicrobial potential of the bifurcaria bifurcata epiphytic bacteria.
AB  == surface-associated marine bacteria are an interesting source of new secondary metabolites. the aim of this study was the isolation and identification of epiphytic bacteria from the marine brown alga, bifurcaria bifurcata, and the evaluation of the antioxidant and antimicrobial activity of bacteria extracts. the identification of epiphytic bacteria was determined by 16s rrna gene sequencing. bacteria extracts were obtained with methanol and dichloromethane (1:1) extraction. the antioxidant activity of extracts was performed by quantification of total phenolic content (tpc), 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (dpph) radical scavenging activity and oxygen radical absorbance capacity (orac). antimicrobial activities were evaluated against escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacillus subtilis, salmonella enteritidis, staphylococcus aureus, saccharomyces cerevisiae and candida albicans. a total of 39 bifurcaria bifurcata-associated bacteria were isolated and 33 were identified as vibrio sp.  (48.72%), alteromonas sp. (12.82%), shewanella sp. (12.26%), serratia sp. (2.56%), citricoccus sp. (2.56%), cellulophaga sp. (2.56%), ruegeria sp. (2.56%)  and staphylococcus sp. (2.56%). six (15.38%) of the 39 bacteria bifurcaria bifurcata-associated bacteria presented less than a 90% basic local alignment search tool (blast) match, and some of those could be new. the highest antioxidant activity and antimicrobial activity (against b. subtilis) was exhibited by strain 16 (shewanella sp.). several strains also presented high antimicrobial activity against s. aureus, mainly belonging to alteromonas sp. and vibrio sp. there were no positive results against fungi and gram-negative bacteria. bifurcaria bifurcata epiphytic bacteria were revealed to be excellent sources of natural antioxidant and antimicrobial compounds.

TI  == synthesis, structures and antibacterial activities of benzoylthiourea derivatives and their complexes with cobalt.
AB  == four new thiocarbonyl fluorobenzamides and their complexes with cobalt have been  synthesized and characterized by elemental analysis, ftir, and (1)h nmr. five crystal structures of the thioylbenzamides complexes of co(ptcb)(3), co(2fptcb)(3), co(4fptcb)(3), co(2fmtcb)(2) and co(4fmtcb)(3) have been determined by x-ray diffraction. the antibacterial properties of these compounds  against the bacteria, e. coli, staphylococcus aureus, b. subtilis, p. aeruginosa, and shewanella sp. were investigated. the experiments showed that both compounds  and the complexes had the antibacterial activities against all of the studied bacteria. the thioylbenzamides had stronger controls for the bacteria of e. coli, s. aureus, b. subtilis and p. aeruginosa than their corresponding cobalt complexes. there was the contrary result against the bacteria of shewanella sp. the para-substitution of fluorine atom increased antibacterial activities, while  fluorine atom was substituted on ortho-benzoyl, the antibacterial activity weakened. the thioylbenzamides linked to piperidine instead of a morpholine group may increase the antibacterial activities.

TI  == defensin of the zebra mussel (dreissena polymorpha): molecular structure, in vitro expression, antimicrobial activity, and potential functions.
AB  == a 409 bp full length defensin gene was cloned and sequenced based on an expressed sequence tag (est) obtained from a normalized zebra mussel (dreissena polymorpha) foot cdna library developed in our laboratory. the d. polymorpha defensin (dpd) gene encoded a peptide with 76 amino acid residues. the mature dpd contains 54 amino acids with a fully functional insect defensin a domain. homologue searching against genbank database suggested that this dpd was phylogenetically close to defensins from a group of insects with six conserved cysteine residues. predicted with homology-modeling method, the three-dimensional structure of dpd also demonstrated a significant similarity with insect defensin a. the recombinant dpd was in vitro expressed through an escherichia coli expression system. the antimicrobial activities of the refolded recombinant dpd were found against the growth of morganella sp., plesiomonas shigelloides, edwardsiella tarda, e. coli and staphylococcus aureus aureus (atcc12598) with the minimal inhibition concentration (mic) 0.35, 0.43, 1.16, 6.46, and 30.39 microm, respectively. however, with less than 50 microm no detectable inhibition activities were observed against the other four gram-negative bacteria (aeromonas salmonicida salmonicida, motile aeromonas, flavobacterium sp., pseudomonas fluorescens, shewanella putrifaciens), as well as the other gram-positive bacteria (bacillus megaterium atcc14581, carnobacterium maltaromaticum atcc27865, enterococcus faecalis atcc19433, and micrococcus leteus atcc4698), and the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae. the rna fluorescent in situ hybridization (fish) of dpd in the zebra  mussel suggested that the dpd was expressed in a variety of tissues, such as foot, retractor muscle, ctenidium, mantle, hemocytes, gonad, digestive gland, and intestine. by using the quantitative pcr, the expression level of dpd in the zebra mussel foot was the highest, followed by the muscle. by comparing the amount of dpd transcripts in the zebra mussel foot under two different byssogenesis conditions (byssogenesis and non-byssogenesis) with qpcr, we found that the higher expression levels of dpd were always associated with the byssogenesis status from 2 to 4 days after the start of byssogenesis. findings of this study suggest that the expression of the dpd gene was upregulated in vivo by byssogeneis, and by hemocytes in vitro upon stimulation with microbial antigens.
