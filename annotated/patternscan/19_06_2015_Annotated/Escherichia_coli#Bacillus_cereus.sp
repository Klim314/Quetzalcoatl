TI  == cleanliness of linen and clothing items professionally laundered or dry-cleaned.
AB  == we asked 14 professional cleaners (laundry services) to clean various unused (new) linen and clothing items with a microbial contamination level of < 1 colony-forming units (cfu)/cm2 and then evaluated the bacterial/fungal contamination of the laundered or dry-cleaned items. after laundering, 6 (21.4%)  of 28 samples from 4 of the 14 cleaners (28.5%) were contaminated (1-1,200 cfu/cm2). after dry-cleaning, 2 (7.1%) of 28 samples from 2 (14.3%) of the 14 cleaners were contaminated (7-10 cfu/cm2). the main contaminant was bacillus cereus. no sample of the laundered or dry-cleaned items showed staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, or pseudomonas aeruginosa contamination. all 14 cleaners investigated in this study used batch-type washing machines. therefore,  batch-type washing machines can cause the contamination of linens and clothing items with b. cereus.

TI  == correlations between cyanobacterial density and bacterial transformation to the viable but nonculturable (vbnc) state in four freshwater water bodies.
AB  == nutrient concentrations, phytoplankton density and community composition, and the viable but nonculturable (vbnc) state of heterotrophic bacteria were investigated in three connected reservoirs and a small isolated lake in south china to study the relationship between biotic and abiotic factors and the vbnc state in bacteria. nutrient concentrations in the reservoirs increased in the direction of water flow, whereas wenshan lake was more eutrophic. cyanobacterial blooms occurred in all four water bodies, with differing seasonal trends and dominant species. in xili and tiegang reservoirs, the vbnc ratio (percent of vbnc state bacteria over total viable bacteria) was high for most of the year and negatively correlated with cyanobacterial density. laboratory co-culture experiments were performed with four heterotrophic bacterial species isolated from wenshan lake (escherichia coli, klebsiella peneumoniae, bacillus megaterium and bacillus cereus) and the dominant cyanobacterial species (microcystis aeruginosa). for the first three bacterial species, the presence of m. aeruginosa induced the vbnc state and the vbnc ratio was positively correlated with m. aeruginosa density. however, b. cereus inhibited m. aeruginosa growth. these results demonstrate that cyanobacteria could potentially regulate the transformation to the vbnc state of  waterborne bacteria, and suggest a role for bacteria in cyanobacterial bloom initiation and termination.

TI  == kinetics of bacterial inactivation by 405nm and 520nm light emitting diodes and the role of endogenous coproporphyrin on bacterial susceptibility.
AB  == photodynamic inactivation studies of microbial pathogens have focused on the use  of an external photosensitizer or a precursor compound to eliminate bacteria. the present study investigated the inactivation kinetics of six bacterial pathogens by a 405nm light emitting diode (led) without the addition of any external compound. the role of endogenous coproporphyrin on the bacterial susceptibility to leds was also examined. pathogens were illuminated with leds at 25, 10 and 4 degrees c for 9h and the inactivation curves were modeled using six different equations. endogenous coproporphyrin was quantified using an hplc system equipped with a fluorescence detector. at a dose of 306j/cm2, the 405nm led brought about  4.0, 2.1 and 1.9 log reductions in the populations of staphylococcus aureus at 25, 10 and 4 degrees c, respectively. at all three temperatures, the population of bacillus cereus and listeria monocytogenes reduced by approximately 2.3 and 1.9 log respectively. salmonella typhimurium and escherichia coli o157:h7 showed  moderate susceptibility to 405nm led while pseudomonas aeruginosa was most resistant. of the six models tested, hom model proved most suitable. this study demonstrated that 405nm leds can be useful in the inactivation of bacterial pathogens with the aid of endogenous coproporphyrin alone.

TI  == sonodynamic action of curcumin on foodborne bacteria bacillus cereus and escherichia coli.
AB  == bacterial contamination is an important cause of foodborne diseases. the present  study aimed to investigate sonodynamic action of curcumin on foodborne bacteria bacillus cereus (b. cereus) and escherichia coli (e. coli). the uptake of curcumin was measured for optimizing the concentration incubation time before ultrasound sonication, and colony forming units (cfu) were counted after ultrasound treatment. the chromosomal dna fragmentation of bacteria was analyzed  and the effect of hypoxic condition on the antibacterial efficacy of sonodynamic  action of curcumin was also assessed in this study. the results showed that the maximum uptake of curcumin in b. cereus and e. coli occurred in 50min after curcumin incubation. curcumin had sonodynamic bactericidal activity in a curcumin dose-dependent manner, and 5.6-log reduction in cfu of b. cereus was observed after curcumin treatment (2.0mum), however, only 2-log reduction in cfu of e. coli after 40mum curcumin treatment. no significant change in chromosomal dna was found after the combined treatment of curcumin and ultrasound. the survival of b. cereus and e. coli after sonodynamic treatment in hypoxic group was significantly higher than that in normal oxygen group. these findings indicated that sonodynamic action of curcumin had significant inactivation effect on foodborne bacteria, and b. cereus was more sensitive to sonodynamic treatment of curcumin than e. coli. sonodynamic antibacterial activity of curcumin might be dependent on the oxygen environment.

TI  == effect of uv-c light on the microbial and sensory quality of seasoned dried seafood.
AB  == this study investigated the effects of different doses of uv-c light at 253.7 nm  (0-18 kj/m2) on the reduction of escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus and bacillus cereus in contaminated seasoned dried filefish (thamnaconus modestus) and sliced squid (todarodes pacificus) surfaces and sensory quality. the counts of all three bacteria were significantly (p < 0.05) reduced by the increase of uv-c dosage. e. coli, s. aureus and b. cereus on filefish with 18 kj/m2 of uv-c maximally reduced by 2.70, 2.55 and 2.57 log cfu/g, respectively; however, on the sliced squid using the same uv dose reduced the same bacteria by 1.35, 0.54 and 1.05 log cfu/g, respectively. however, the results suggest that 6 to 9 kj/m2 of uv-c could be used for the inactivation of e. coli and b. cereus in these dried fishery products without any changes in sensory quality. however, s. aureus levels on sliced squid will require a combination of uv-c light and chemical treatment.

TI  == challenge study of the pathogen reduction capacity of the theraflex mb-plasma technology.
AB  == background and objectives: although most pathogen reduction systems for plasma primarily target viruses, bacterial contamination may also occur. this study aimed to investigate the bacterial reduction capacity of a methylene blue (mb) treatment process and its virus inactivation capacity in lipaemic plasma. materials and methods: bacterial concentrations in plasma units spiked with different bacterial strains were measured before and after the following steps of the theraflex mb-plasma procedure: leucocyte filtration, mb/light treatment and mb filtration. virus inactivation was investigated for three virus types in non-lipaemic, borderline lipaemic and highly lipaemic plasma. results: leucocyte  filtration alone efficiently eliminated most of the tested bacteria by more than  4 logs (staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus aureus) or to the limit of  detection (lod) (>/= 4.8 logs; escherichia coli, bacillus cereus and klebsiella pneumoniae). mb/light and mb filtration further reduced staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus aureus to below the lod. the small bacterium brevundimonas diminuta was reduced by 1.7 logs by leucocyte filtration alone, and to below the lod by additional mb/light treatment and mb filtration (>/= 3.7 logs). suid herpesvirus 1, bovine viral diarrhoea virus and human immunodeficiency virus 1 were efficiently inactivated by theraflex mb-plasma, independent of the degree of lipaemia. conclusion: theraflex mb-plasma efficiently reduces bacteria, mainly via the integrated filtration system. its virus inactivation capacity is sufficient to compensate for reduced light transparency due to lipaemia.

TI  == development of intestinal microflora and occurrence of diarrhoea in sucking foals: effects of bacillus cereus var. toyoi supplementation.
AB  == background: almost all foals develop transient diarrhoea within the first weeks of life. studies indicated different viral, bacterial, and parasitic causes, such as rotavirus, clostridium perfringens, escherichia coli, and cryptosporidium are  discussed. but little is known about the development of intestinal microflora in  foals. the present study investigated whether the supplementation with bacillus cereus var. toyoi would modify the developing intestinal microflora and consequently reduce diarrhoea in foals. from birth, the foals were randomly assigned to three treatment groups: placebo (10 ml isotonic nacl, n = 8), low dosage (ld; 5 x 10(8) cfu b. cereus var. toyoi, n = 7) and high dosage (hd; 2 x 10(9) cfu b. cereus var. toyoi, n = 10). treatment groups were supplemented orally once a day for 58 days. faeces scoring and sampling were performed within  the first 24 h after birth and on day 9, 16, 23, 30, 44, 58 of the foal's life and also on the first day of diarrhoea. culture-plate methods were used to analyse the bacterial microflora. results: eighty-eight per cent of the foals developed diarrhoea (placebo 7/8, ld 5/7, hd 10/10) during the first 58 days of life. bacillus cereus var. toyoi supplementation had no effect on bacterial microflora. clostridium perfringens and enterobacteria were equally prevalent in  foals with diarrhoea and those who were not afflicted. conclusions: we conclude that the supplementation of b. cereus var. toyoi had no effect on the occurrence  of diarrhoea and health status in the foals.

TI  == antimicrobial evaluation of plants used for the treatment of diarrhoea in a rural community in northern maputaland, kwazulu-natal, south africa.
AB  == background: zulu people living in the rural area of maputaland (kwazulu-natal, south africa) rely heavily on medicinal plants for the treatment of diarrhoea. abundant availability of medicinal plants in the study area offers low cost health care, but scientific validation is needed in order to lend credibility to  the traditional use against many ailments including diarrhoeal infections. with this in mind a study was designed to test the in vitro antimicrobial efficacy of  23 plant species which are used for the treatment of diarrhoea in rural maputaland. four 1:1 plant combinations were also evaluated to determine their interactive effects against seven diarrhoea-related bacterial pathogens. methods: minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) assays were undertaken on dichloromethane-methanol (ch2cl2: meoh) and aqueous crude extracts. the following micro-organisms were selected for this study and were tested based on their association with stomach ailments and diarrhoea; bacillus cereus (atcc 11778), enterococcus faecalis (atcc 29212), escherichia coli (atcc 8739), proteus vulgaris (atcc 33420), salmonella typhimurium (atcc 14028), shigella flexneri (atcc 25875) and staphylococcus aureus (atcc 12600). the fractional inhibitory concentration index (sigmafic) was determined for plants traditionally used in combination. results: shigella flexneri proved to be the most susceptible pathogen, where the organic extract of terminalia sericea showed the most prominent noteworthy antibacterial activity (mean mic value of 0.04 mg/ml). the aqueous extracts generally showed poorer antimicrobial activity with some exceptions i.e. acacia burkei, brachylaena transvaalensis against b. cereus and b. transvaalensis against s. flexneri. in the combination studies, synergy was predominant with mean (across all pathogens) sigmafic values of 0.30 for acanthospermum glabratum with krauseola mosambicina; sigmafic values of 0.46 for  a. glabratum with psidium guajava; sigmafic values of 0.39 for b. transvaalensis  with p. guajava and sigmafic values of 0.88 (additive) for the combination of b.  transvaalensis with sclerocarya birrea. conclusion: this study provided some insight into the bacterial in vitro efficacies of plants traditionally used to treat diarrhoea by the people of northern maputaland. very little connection was  observed between frequency of use and efficacy. plant combinations demonstrated favourable efficacy with mostly synergistic effects noted, lending some credibility to their use in combination.

TI  == purification and characterization of a novel plantaricin, kl-1y, from lactobacillus plantarum kl-1.
AB  == three bacteriocins from lactobacillus plantarum kl-1 were successfully purified using ammonium sulfate precipitation, cation-exchange chromatography and reverse-phase hplc. the bacteriocin peptides kl-1x, -1y and -1z had molecular masses of 3053.82, 3498.16 and 3533.16 da, respectively. all three peptides were  stable at ph 2-12 and 25 degrees c and at high temperatures of 80 and 100 degrees c for 30 min and 121 degrees c for 15 min. however, they differed in their susceptibility to proteolytic enzymes and their inhibition spectra. kl-1y showed  broad inhibitory activities against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis dmst 17368, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 15442, p. aeruginosa atcc 9027, escherichia coli o157:h7 and e. coli atcc 8739. kl-1x and -1z inhibited only gram-positive bacteria. kl-1x, kl-1y and kl-1z exhibited synergistic activity. the successful amino acid sequencing of kl-1y had a hydrophobicity of approximately 30 % and no cysteine residues suggested its novelty, and it was designated "plantaricin kl-1y". plantaricin kl-1y exhibited bactericidal activity against bacillus cereus jcm 2152(t). compared to nisin, kl-1y displayed broad inhibitory activities of 200, 800, 1600, 800, 400 and 400 au/ml against the growth of bacillus coagulans jcm 2257(t), b. cereus jcm 2152(t), listeria innocua atcc 33090(t), staphylococcus aureus tistr 118, e. coli o157:h7 and e. coli atcc 8739, respectively, whereas nisin had similar activities against only b. coagulans jcm 2257(t) and b. cereus jcm 2152(t). therefore, the novel plantaricin kl-1y is a promising antimicrobial substance for food safety uses in the future.

TI  == antibiotic-resistant bacteria: prevalence in food and inactivation by food-compatible compounds and plant extracts.
AB  == foodborne antibiotic-resistant pathogenic bacteria such as campylobacter jejuni,  bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens, escherichia coli, salmonella enterica,  staphylococcus aureus, vibrio cholerae, and vibrio parahemolyticus can adversely  affect animal and human health, but a better understanding of the factors involved in their pathogenesis is needed. to help meet this need, this overview surveys and interprets much of our current knowledge of antibiotic (multidrug)-resistant bacteria in the food chain and the implications for microbial food safety and animal and human health. topics covered include the origin and prevalence of resistant bacteria in the food chain (dairy, meat, poultry, seafood, and herbal products, produce, and eggs), their inactivation by  different classes of compounds and plant extracts and by the use of chlorine and  physicochemical methods (heat, uv light, pulsed electric fields, and high pressure), the synergistic antimicrobial effects of combinations of natural antimicrobials with medicinal antibiotics, and mechanisms of antimicrobial activities and resistant effects. possible areas for future research are suggested. plant-derived and other safe natural antimicrobial compounds have the  potential to control the prevalence of both susceptible and resistant pathogens in various environments. the collated information and suggested research will hopefully contribute to a better understanding of approaches that could be used to minimize the presence of resistant pathogens in animal feed and human food, thus reducing adverse effects, improving microbial food safety, and helping to prevent or treat animal and human infections.

TI  == biosynthesis, characterization, and antimicrobial applications of silver nanoparticles.
AB  == in the present study, the strain brevibacterium frigoritolerans dc2 was explored  for the efficient and extracellular synthesis of silver nanoparticles. these biosynthesized silver nanoparticles were characterized by ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometry, which detected the formation of silver nanoparticles in the reaction mixture and showed a maximum absorbance at 420 nm. in addition, field emission transmission electron microscopy revealed the spherical shape of the nanoparticles. the dynamic light scattering results indicated the average particle size of the product was 97 nm with a 0.191 polydispersity index. furthermore, the product was analyzed by energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, x-ray diffraction, and elemental mapping, which displayed the presence of elemental silver in the product. moreover, on a medical platform, the product was checked against pathogenic microorganisms including vibrio parahaemolyticus, salmonella enterica, bacillus anthracis, bacillus cereus, escherichia coli, and candida albicans. the nanoparticles demonstrated antimicrobial activity against all of these pathogenic microorganisms. additionally, the silver nanoparticles were evaluated for their combined effects with the commercial antibiotics lincomycin, oleandomycin, vancomycin, novobiocin, penicillin g, and rifampicin against these pathogenic microorganisms. these results indicated that the combination of antibiotics with biosynthesized silver nanoparticles enhanced the  antimicrobial effects of antibiotics. therefore, the current study is a demonstration of an efficient biological synthesis of silver nanoparticles by b.  frigoritolerans dc2 and its effect on the enhancement of the antimicrobial efficacy of well-known commercial antibiotics.

TI  == a rapid and miniaturized method for the selection of microbial phenol degraders using colourimetric microtitration.
AB  == a high-throughput method is described, consisting of a colourimetric microtitration for screening phenol-degrading microorganisms, using a mixture of  4-aminoantipyrine and potassium ferricyanide as the colour indicator. this contemporary study summarizes a new method to determine phenol-degrading bacteria isolated from different areas. the method was used for testing a total of 72 bacteria collected from the natural environment and five known strains obtained from diagnostic and research laboratories employing 200 mg/l phenol (the linear range saturation concentration). depending on the change in colour indicator, the degradation profiles of 11 strains of bacteria are shown, of which seven strains  were able to degrade more than 80 % of phenol within 6-8 h, while the other four  strains took 12-24 h. two of the environmentally isolated strains showed high efficiency of phenol degradation and were confirmed by the high-performance liquid chromatography analysis. these strains were identified by 16s rrna sequencing as unique (escherichia coli moh1 and bacillus cereus moh2) and were deposited in the genbank of ncbi. two pathogenic strains (uropathogenic e. coli and salmonella sp.) were found to be the fast degraders of phenol, which is of medical concern, as phenol is generally used as a disinfectant in hospitals. this method can be used for the estimation and screening of phenol degraders in a single step, for its application in bioremediation as well as in hospitals for screening the phenol resistance of pathogens.

TI  == characterization of films based on chitosan lactate and its blends with oxidized  starch and gelatin.
AB  == minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) of chitosan lactate (chl) was tested against bacteria and phytopathogenic fungi. then, the structural, physicochemical and antimicrobial properties of films based on chl, oxidized potato starch (ops), and gelatin (gel) were investigated. with the exception of rhizopus nigricans, chl was effective against the target organisms. gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus and bacillus cereus) were more sensitive to chl than gram-negative bacteria (pectobacterium carotovorum and escherichia coli). cryo-sem images showed total miscibility between the polymers in the blends and the atr-ftir spectra revealed that there was an interaction among the polymeric components. pure chl films displayed the highest moisture content (25.51%), water vapor permeability (48.78gmmm(-2)d(-1)kpa(-1)), and the lowest tensile and puncture strength (2.00 and 1.45mpa, respectively) among the studied films. chl50/gel50 films had lower permeability, higher mechanical strength, and lower elongation compared to chl50/ops50 films. films obtained from chl and chl50/gel50 were completely water-soluble and did not show sorbitol recrystallization. the incorporation of chl into ops and gel films did not affect their transparency and improved uv-blocking capacity. chl films were the only ones that exhibited antibacterial efficiency. antifungal activities against alternaria alternata and  monilinia fructigena were detected for chl and chl50/gel50 films.

TI  == microbiological diversity and prevalence of spoilage and pathogenic bacteria in commercial fermented alcoholic beverages (beer, fruit wine, refined rice wine, and yakju).
AB  == the present study examined 469 commercially available fermented alcoholic beverages (fabs), including beer (draft, microbrewed, and pasteurized), fruit wine (grape and others), refined rice wine, and yakju (raw and pasteurized). samples were screened for escherichia coli and eight foodborne pathogens (bacillus cereus, campylobacter jejuni, clostridium perfringens, escherichia coli o157:h7, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella spp., staphylococcus aureus, and yersinia enterocolitica), and the aerobic plate count, lactic acid bacteria, acetic acid bacteria, fungi, and total coliforms were also enumerated. microbrewed beer contained the highest number of microorganisms (average aerobic  plate count, 3.5; lactic acid bacteria, 2.1; acetic acid bacteria, 2.0; and fungi, 3.6 log cfu/ml), followed by draft beer and yakju (p < 0.05), whereas the  other fabs contained , 25 cfu/25 ml microorganisms. unexpectedly, neither microbial diversity nor microbial count correlated with the alcohol content (4.7  to 14.1%) or ph (3.4 to 4.2) of the product. despite the harsh conditions, coliforms (detected in 23.8% of microbrewed beer samples) and b. cereus (detected in all fabs) were present in some products. b. cereus was detected most frequently in microbrewed beer (54.8% of samples) and nonpasteurized yakju (50.0%), followed by pasteurized yakju (28.8%), refined rice wine (25.0%), other  fruit wines (12.3%), grape wine (8.6%), draft beer (5.6%), and pasteurized beer (2.2%) (p < 0.05). the finding that spore-forming b. cereus and coliform bacteria can survive the harsh conditions present in alcoholic beverages should be taken into account (alongside traditional quality indicators such as the presence of lactic acid-producing bacteria, acetic acid-producing bacteria, or both) when developing manufacturing systems and methods to prolong the shelf life of high-quality fab products. new strategic quality management plans for various fabs are needed.

TI  == expert elicitation as a means to attribute 28 enteric pathogens to foodborne, waterborne, animal contact, and person-to-person transmission routes in canada.
AB  == enteric illness contributes to a significant burden of illness in canada and globally. understanding its sources is a critical step in identifying and preventing health risks. expert elicitation is a powerful tool, used previously,  to obtain information about enteric illness source attribution where information  is difficult or expensive to obtain. thirty-one experts estimated transmission of 28 pathogens via major transmission routes (foodborne, waterborne, animal contact, person-to-person, and other) at the point of consumption. the elicitation consisted of a (snowball) recruitment phase; administration of a pre-survey to collect background information, an introductory webinar, an elicitation survey, a 1-day discussion, survey readministration, and a feedback exercise, and surveys were administered online. experts were prompted to quantify changes in contamination at the point of entry into the kitchen versus point of consumption. estimates were combined via triangular probability distributions, and medians and 90% credible-interval estimates were produced. transmission was attributed primarily to food for bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens, cyclospora cayetanensis, trichinella spp., all three vibrio spp. categories explored, and yersinia enterocolitica. multisource pathogens (e.g., transmitted commonly through both water and food) such as campylobacter spp., four escherichia coli categories, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella spp., and staphylococcus aureus were also estimated as mostly foodborne. water was the primary pathway for giardia spp. and cryptosporidium spp., and person-to-person transmission dominated for six enteric viruses and shigella spp. consideration of the point of attribution highlighted the importance of food handling and cross-contamination in the transmission pathway. this study provides source attribution estimates of enteric illness for canada, considering all possible transmission routes. further research is necessary to improve our understanding of poorly characterized pathogens such as sapovirus and e. coli subgroups in canada.

TI  == bacillus halodurans strain c125 encodes and synthesizes enzymes from both known pathways to form dump directly from cytosine deoxyribonucleotides.
AB  == analysis of the genome of bacillus halodurans strain c125 indicated that two pathways leading from a cytosine deoxyribonucleotide to dump, used for dtmp synthesis, were encoded by the genome of the bacterium. the genes that were responsible, the comeb gene and the dcdb gene, encoding dcmp deaminase and the bifunctional dctp deaminase:dutpase (dcd:dut), respectively, were both shown to be expressed in b. halodurans, and both genes were subject to repression by the nucleosides thymidine and deoxycytidine. the latter nucleoside presumably exerts  its repression after deamination by cytidine deaminase. both comeb and dcdb were  cloned, overexpressed in escherichia coli, and purified to homogeneity. both enzymes were active and displayed the expected regulatory properties: activation  by dctp for dcmp deaminase and dttp inhibition for both enzymes. structurally, the b. halodurans enzyme resembled the mycobacterium tuberculosis enzyme the most. an investigation of sequenced genomes from other species of the genus bacillus revealed that not only the genome of b. halodurans but also the genomes  of bacillus pseudofirmus, bacillus thuringiensis, bacillus hemicellulosilyticus,  bacillus marmarensis, bacillus cereus, and bacillus megaterium encode both the dcmp deaminase and the dcd:dut enzymes. in addition, eight dcdb homologs from bacillus species within the genus for which the whole genome has not yet been sequenced were registered in the ncbi entrez database.

TI  == improved in vitro assay for determining the mucin adherence of bacteria sensitive to triton x-100 treatment.
AB  == mucin-associated microbiota are in relatively close contact with the intestinal epithelium and may thus have a more pronounced effect on host health. we have previously developed a simple mucin agar assay to simulate initial mucus colonization by intestinal microbial communities. adherence of microbiota was estimated using flow cytometry after detachment with triton x-100. in this study, the effect of this detergent on the cultivability of both virulent and commensal  strains was investigated. mucin attachment of selected strains was evaluated using the mucin adhesion assay. bacteria were dislodged from the mucin surface by incubation with triton or from the whole mucin agar layer using a stomacher. mechanical extraction resulted in 1.24 +/- 0.42, 2.69 +/- 0.44, and 1.56 +/- 0.85 log cfu/ml higher plate counts of lactobacillus rhamnosus, bacillus cereus, and escherichia coli strains, respectively, than the chemical method. the sensitivity of bacteria to triton varied among microbial species and strains. among others, triton inhibited the growth of salmonella enterica lmg 10396 and pseudomonas aeruginosa lmg 8029 on laboratory media, although these bacteria maintained their viability during this treatment. only gram-positive strains, enterococcus hirae lmg 6399 and l. rhamnosus gg, were not affected by this detergent. therefore, the mechanical method is recommended for the extraction of mucin-adhered bacteria that are sensitive to triton, especially when followed by traditional cultivation techniques. however, this approach can also be recommended for strains that are not affected by this detergent, because it resulted in higher recovery of adhered l. rhamnosus gg compared to the chemical extraction.

TI  == polydiacetylene nanovesicles as carriers of natural phenylpropanoids for creating antimicrobial food-contact surfaces.
AB  == the ultimate goal of this study was developing antimicrobial food-contact materials based on natural phenolic compounds using nanotechnological approaches. among the methyl-beta-cyclodextrin-encapsulated phenolics tested, curcumin showed by far the highest activity toward escherichia coli with a minimum inhibitory concentration of 0.4 mm. curcumin was enclosed in liposome-type polydiacetylene/phosholipid nanovesicles supplemented with n-hydroxysuccinimide and glucose. the fluorescence spectrum of the nanovesicles suggested that curcumin was located in their bilayer region. free-suspended nanovesicles tended  to bind to the bacterial surface and demonstrated bactericidal activity toward gram-negative (e. coli) and vegetative cells of gram-positive (bacillus cereus) bacteria reducing their counts from 5 log cfu ml(-1) to an undetectable level within 8 h. the nanovesicles were covalently bound to silanized glass. incubation of e. coli and b. cereus with nanovesicle-coated glass resulted in a 2.5 log reduction in their counts. after optimization this approach can be used for controlling microbial growth, cross-contamination, and biofilm formation on food-contacting surfaces.

TI  == effects of climate change on the persistence and dispersal of foodborne bacterial pathogens in the outdoor environment: a review.
AB  == abstract according to the intergovernmental panel on climate change (ipcc), warming of the climate system is unequivocal. over the coming century, warming trends such as increased duration and frequency of heat waves and hot extremes are expected in some areas, as well as increased intensity of some storm systems. climate-induced trends will impact the persistence and dispersal of foodborne pathogens in myriad ways, especially for environmentally ubiquitous and/or zoonotic microorganisms. animal hosts of foodborne pathogens are also expected to be impacted by climate change through the introduction of increased physiological stress and, in some cases, altered geographic ranges and seasonality. this review article examines the effects of climatic factors, such as temperature, rainfall,  drought and wind, on the environmental dispersal and persistence of bacterial foodborne pathogens, namely, bacillus cereus, brucella, campylobacter, clostridium, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella, staphylococcus aureus, vibrio and yersinia enterocolitica. these relationships are then used to  predict how future climatic changes will impact the activity of these microorganisms in the outdoor environment and associated food safety issues. the  development of predictive models that quantify these complex relationships will also be discussed, as well as the potential impacts of climate change on transmission of foodborne disease from animal hosts.

TI  == antimicrobial potential of cauliflower, broccoli, and okara byproducts against foodborne bacteria.
AB  == the antimicrobial potential of cauliflower, broccoli, and okara byproducts was assessed against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, escherichia coli o157:h7, bacillus cereus, and listeria monocytogenes serovar 4b growth behavior was assessed under exposure to 5% vegetable byproducts added to the reference medium, buffered peptone water (0.1%  [wt/vol]), at 37 degrees c. although the byproducts were not effective against l. monocytogenes, they were bactericidal against salmonella typhimurium, e. coli o157:h7, and b. cereus. the most promising results were achieved with the cauliflower-salmonella typhimurium combination, because the bacterial population  was reduced by 3.11 log10 cycles after 10 h of incubation at 37 degrees c as a result of 5% cauliflower addition. further studies were carried out for this combination, at different cauliflower concentrations (0, 0.5, 1, 5, 10, and 15%)  and at temperatures in the range of 5-37 degrees c. the greatest inactivation level (6.11 log10 cycles) was achieved at refrigeration temperature (5 degrees c) using 15% cauliflower addition. both temperature and cauliflower concentration significantly (p</=0.05) influenced the salmonella typhimurium inactivation level. the kinetic parameters were adjusted to mathematical models. the modified  gompertz mathematical model provided an accurate fit (root-mean-square error (rmse) [0.00009-0.21] and adjusted-r(2) [0.81-0.99]) to experimental salmonella typhimurium survival curves describing inactivation kinetics of the pathogen to the antimicrobial effect of cauliflower byproduct.

TI  == microbiological and physicochemical analysis of yatei (tetragonisca angustula) honey for assessing quality standards and commercialization.
AB  == due to the interest in the production and trading of yatei (tetragonisca angustula) honey in the province of misiones, argentina, in this work we assessed microbiological and physicochemical parameters in order to contribute to the elaboration of standards for quality control and promote commercialization. results showed that yatei honey samples had significantly different microbiological and physicochemical characteristics in comparison to established  quality standards for apis mellifera honey. thus, we observed that values for ph  (3.72), glucose (19.01 g/100g) and fructose (23.74 g/100g) were lower than a. mellifera quality standards, while acidity (79.42 meq/kg), moisture (24%), and mould and yeast count (my) (3.02 log cfu/g) were higher. the acid content was correlated with glucose (r2=0.75) and fructose (r2=0.68) content, and also with mould and yeast counts (r2=0.45) to a lesser extent. the incidence of microorganisms in yatei honey samples reached 42.85% and 39% for clostridium sulfite-reducers and bacillus spp., respectively. no c. botulinum or b. cereus cells were detected. enterococcus spp. and staphylococcus spp. incidence was similar (ca. 7.14%), whereas escherichia coli and salmonella spp. were not detected. we conclude that the microbiological and physicochemical properties of  yatei honey are different from those of a. mellifera honey; hence, different quality standards could be implemented to promote its commercialization.

TI  == chemical composition and biological activity of pulicaria vulgaris essential oil  from iran.
AB  == the present study investigated the chemical composition of the essential oil (eo) from aerial parts (flowering stage) of pulicaria vulgaris gaertn. by gc-ms. also, the antimicrobial activity of the eo against gram-positive bacteria (bacillus cereus and staphylococcus aureus), gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa) and fungi (aspergillus niger and candida albicans) was tested. in total, 23 compounds were recognized, accounting for 98.08% of the eo.  the main compounds in the eo were thymol (50.22%), p-menth-6-en-2-one (carvotanacetone, 20.2%), thymol isobutyrate (16.88%), menthan-2-one (4.31%), 1-methyl-1,2-propanedione (4.13%), 2,5-dimethoxy-p-cymene (4.01%), myrtenol (1.22%), linalool (1.1%), and beta-myrcene (1.9%). results of antibacterial test  of p. vulgaris essential oil showed that all assayed concentrations significantly inhibited the growth of b. cereus, s. aureus, e. coli, and p. aeruginosa at p < 0.05. mic for b. cereus, s. aureus, e. coli, p. aeruginosa was 17.5, 25.2, 19.4 and 33.2 mug/ml respectively; antifungal screening of the essential oil of p. vulgaris showed that the oil significantly inhibited the growth of a. niger and c. albicans (mic = 15.5 and 9.9 mug/ml, respectively). results of cytotoxicity assay showed that the essential oil exhibited a significant cytotoxic activity against both cell lines. in case of mcf-7 and hep-g2 cell lines, ic50 of the essential oil were 5.36 and 7.16 mug/ml, respectively. the potent antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities of the eo may be attributed to its high contents of thymol, carvotanacetone and thymol isobutyrate. antimicrobial and antitumor chemotherapies are showing diminishing effectiveness because of emergence of drug-resistance. hence, using efficient natural chemotherapeutic agents such as pulicaria vulgaris essential oil with fewer side effects is an encouraging approach to fight cancer and infectious diseases in medicine, agriculture, food science and related fields.

TI  == characteristics and phylogeny of bacillus cereus strains isolated from maari, a traditional west african food condiment.
AB  == maari is a spontaneously fermented food condiment made from baobab tree seeds in  west african countries. this type of product is considered to be safe, being consumed by millions of people on a daily basis. however, due to the spontaneous  nature of the fermentation the human pathogen bacillus cereus occasionally occurs in maari. this study characterizes succession patterns and pathogenic potential of b. cereus isolated from the raw materials (ash, water from a drilled well (dw) and potash), seed mash throughout fermentation (0-96h), after steam cooking and sun drying (final product) from two production sites of maari. aerobic mesophilic bacterial (amb) counts in raw materials were of 10(5)cfu/ml in dw, and ranged between 6.5x10(3) and 1.2x10(4)cfu/g in potash, 10(9)-10(10)cfu/g in seed mash during fermentation and 10(7) - 10(9) after sun drying. fifty three out of total  290 amb isolates were identified as b. cereus sensu lato by use of its-pcr and grouped into 3 groups using pcr fingerprinting based on escherichia coli phage-m13 primer (m13-pcr). as determined by panc gene sequencing, the isolates of b. cereus belonged to panc types iii and iv with potential for high cytotoxicity. phylogenetic analysis of concatenated sequences of glpf, gmk, ilvd, pta, pur, pyca and tpi revealed that the m13-pcr group 1 isolates were related to b. cereus biovar anthracis ci, while the m13-pcr group 2 isolates were identical  to cereulide (emetic toxin) producing b. cereus strains. the m13-pcr group 1 isolates harboured poly-gamma-d-glutamic acid capsule biosynthesis genes capa, capb and capc showing 99-100% identity with the environmental b. cereus isolate 03bb108. presence of cesb of the cereulide synthetase gene cluster was confirmed  by pcr in m13-pcr group 2 isolates. the b. cereus harbouring the cap genes were found in potash, dw, cooking water and at 8h fermentation. the "emetic" type b. cereus were present in dw, the seed mash at 48-72h of fermentation and in the final product, while the remaining isolates (panc type iv) were detected in ash,  at 48-72h fermentation and in the final product. this work sheds light on the succession and pathogenic potential of b. cereus species in traditional west african food condiment and clarifies their phylogenetic relatedness to b. cereus  biovar anthracis. future implementation of gmp and haccp and development of starter cultures for controlled maari fermentations will help to ensure a safe product.

TI  == the cyclic antibacterial peptide enterocin as-48: isolation, mode of action, and  possible food applications.
AB  == enterocin as-48 is a circular bacteriocin produced by enterococcus. it contains a 70 amino acid-residue chain circularized by a head-to-tail peptide bond. the conformation of enterocin as-48 is arranged into five alpha-helices with a compact globular structure. enterocin as-48 has a wide inhibitory spectrum on gram-positive bacteria. sensitivity of gram-negative bacteria increases in combination with outer-membrane permeabilizing treatments. eukaryotic cells are bacteriocin-resistant. this cationic peptide inserts into bacterial membranes and causes membrane permeabilization, leading ultimately to cell death. microarray analysis revealed sets of up-regulated and down-regulated genes in bacillus cereus cells treated with sublethal bacteriocin concentration. enterocin as-48 can be purified in two steps or prepared as lyophilized powder from cultures in whey-based substrates. the potential applications of enterocin as-48 as a food biopreservative have been corroborated against foodborne pathogens and/or toxigenic bacteria (listeria monocytogenes, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, salmonella enterica) and spoilage bacteria (alicyclobacillus acidoterrestris, bacillus spp., paenibacillus spp., geobacillus stearothermophilus, brochothrix thermosphacta, staphylococcus carnosus, lactobacillus sakei and other spoilage lactic acid bacteria). the efficacy of enterocin as-48 in food systems increases greatly in combination with chemical preservatives, essential oils, phenolic compounds, and physico-chemical treatments such as sublethal heat, high-intensity pulsed-electric fields or high  hydrostatic pressure.

TI  == effect of white mustard essential oil on the growth of foodborne pathogens and spoilage microorganisms and the effect of food components on its efficacy.
AB  == antimicrobial preservative compounds are added to foods to target specific pathogens and spoilage organisms. white mustard essential oil (wmeo) is an extract that contains 4-hydroxybenzyl isothiocyanate, a compound which has been demonstrated to have antimicrobial activity in limited studies. the objective of  this research was to determine the in vitro antimicrobial activity of wmeo against gram-positive and gram-negative spoilage and pathogenic bacteria and determine the effect of food components on the antimicrobial activity. the bacteria escherichia coli, salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis, enterobacter  aerogenes, staphylococcus aureus, listeria monocytogenes, bacillus cereus, and lactobacillus fermentum, as well as the acid- and preservative-resistant yeast schizosaccharomyces pombe, were evaluated. all microorganisms were inhibited by wmeo at 8.3 g/liter (equivalent to 1,000 mg/liter 4-hydroxybenzyl isothiocyanate). in general, wmeo was more effective against gram-negative than against gram-positive bacteria. salmonella enteritidis and s. pombe were the most sensitive, with inhibition at as low as 2.1 g/liter. the effects on growth profiles varied but included increased lag phases and lethality, indicating both  bacteriostatic and bactericidal activity. soybean oil had a negative effect on the efficacy of wmeo against l. monocytogenes, and at 5% soybean oil, the antimicrobial activity against salmonella enteritidis was eliminated after 48 h.  sodium caseinate at 1% also negated the antimicrobial effect of wmeo against salmonella enteritidis and decreased its effectiveness against l. monocytogenes.  the presence of starch had no significant effect on the antimicrobial activity of wmeo against l. monocytogenes and salmonella enteritidis. thus, wmeo is effective against a wide range of microorganisms and has potential to be used in foods, depending upon the target microorganism and food components present.

TI  == antibacterial and cytotoxic potential of silver nanoparticles synthesized using latex of calotropis gigantea l.
AB  == the present study aimed to synthesis silver nanoparticles (agnps) in a greener route using aqueous latex extract of calotropis gigantea l. toward biomedical applications. initially, synthesis of agnps was confirmed through uv-vis spectroscopy which shows the surface plasmonic resonance peak (spr) at 420 nm. fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ftir) analysis provides clear evidence that protein fractions present in the latex extract act as reducing and stabilizing bio agents. energy dispersive x-ray (edax) spectroscopy confirms the  presence of silver as a major constituent element. x-ray diffractograms displays  that the synthesized agnps were biphasic crystalline nature. electron microscopic studies such as field emission scanning electron microscopic (fe-sem) and transmission electron microscope (tem) reveals that synthesized agnps are spherical in shape with the size range between 5 and 30 nm. further, crude latex  aqueous extract and synthesized agnps were evaluated against different bacterial  pathogens such as bacillus cereus, enterococci sp, shigella sp, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumonia, staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli. compared to the crude latex aqueous extract, biosynthesized agnps exhibits a remarkable antimicrobial activity. likewise in vitro anticancer study manifests the cytotoxicity value of synthesized agnps against tested hela cells. the output of this study clearly suggesting that biosynthesized agnps using latex of c. gigantea can be used as promising nanomaterial for therapeutic application in context with nanodrug formulation.

TI  == pharmacological basis for the medicinal use of linum usitatissimum (flaxseed) in  infectious and non-infectious diarrhea.
AB  == ethnopharmacological relevance: linum usitatissimum, commonly known as flaxseed has traditionally been used for the management of diarrhea and gastrointestinal infections. this study was planned to assess pharmacological basis for the medicinal use of flaxseed in infectious and non-infectious diarrhea. materials and methods: the crude aqueous-methanolic extract of flaxseed was studied using the in vivo castor oil-induced diarrhea, gut motility and enteropooling assays. mechanistic basis was further elucidated by testing the inhibitory effect on spontaneously contracting isolated rabbit jejunum preparations, suspended in a 10ml tissue bath containing tyrode solution, maintained at 37 degrees c and aerated with carbogen. antibacterial efficacy of the flaxseed extract was tested  against different enteric and non-enteric pathogenic bacteria using in vitro antibacterial assays. results: flaxseed extract reduced the diarrheal score in mice, by 39%, 63.90% and 68.34% at the respective doses of 100, 300 and 500mg/kg. intestinal secretions were reduced by 24.12%, 28.09% and 38.80%, whereas the intestinal motility was reduced by 31.66%, 46.98% and 56.20% at respective doses  of 100, 300 and 500mg/kg. when tested on isolated rabbit jejunum preparations, flaxseed extract produced a dose-dependent inhibition of both spontaneous and high k(+) (80mm)-induced contractions, and shifted the concentration-response curves of ca(++) to the right with suppression of the maximum response, similar to that caused by verapamil. flaxseed extract was found to possess bactericidal activity at the tested concentrations of 12.5mg/ml, against vancomycin-resistant  enterococcus faecalis (100%), escherichia coli k1 (88.88%), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (98.76%), bacillus cereus (92.64%), pseudomonas aeruginosa  (76.83%) and salmonella typhi (26.91+/-3.35%). the concentration of 10mg/ml showed bactericidal effects against all the aforementioned pathogens except escherichia coli k1, whereas for pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella typhi, it  was bacteriostatic at this concentration. conclusions: our results indicate that  linum usitatissimum (flaxseed) extract exhibits antidiarrheal and antispasmodic activities by virtue of its antimotility and antisecretory effects which are mediated possibly through inhibition of ca(++) channels, though additional mechanism(s) cannot be ruled out. flaxseed extract proved effective against both  enteric and non-enteric pathogens causing diarrhea, thus ensuring wide coverage and rationalizing its medicinal use in both the infectious and non-infectious diarrhea.

TI  == the biosynthesis of udp-d-fucnac-4n-(2)-oxoglutarate (udp-yelosamine) in bacillus cereus atcc 14579: pat and pyl, an aminotransferase and an atp-dependent grasp protein that ligates 2-oxoglutarate to udp-4-amino-sugars.
AB  == surface glycan switching is often observed when micro-organisms transition between different biotic and abiotic niches, including biofilms, although the advantages of this switching to the organism are not well understood. bacillus cereus grown in a biofilm-inducing medium has been shown to synthesize an unusual cell wall polysaccharide composed of the repeating subunit -->6)gal(alpha1-2)(2-r-hydroxyglutar-5-ylamido)fuc2nac4n(alpha1-6)glcnac(beta1--> , where galactose is linked to the hydroxyglutarate moiety of fucnac-4-amido-(2)-hydroxyglutarate. the molecular mechanism involved in attaching 2-hydroxyglutarate to 4-amino-fucnac has not been determined. here, we  show two genes in b. cereus atcc 14579 encoding enzymes involved in the synthesis of udp-fucnac-4-amido-(2)-oxoglutarate (udp-yelosamine), a modified udp-sugar not previously reported to exist. using mass spectrometry and real time nmr spectroscopy, we show that bc5273 encodes a c4''-aminotransferase (herein referred to as pat) that, in the presence of pyridoxal phosphate, transfers the primary amino group of l-glu to c-4'' of udp-4-keto-6-deoxy-d-glcnac to form udp-4-amino-fucnac and 2-oxoglutarate. pat also converts 4-keto-xylose, 4-keto-glucose, and 4-keto-2-acetamido-altrose to their corresponding udp-4-amino-sugars. bc5272 encodes a carboxylate-amine ligase (herein referred as pyl) that, in the presence of atp and mg(ii), adds 2-oxoglutarate to the 4-amino  moiety of udp-4-amino-fucnac to form udp-yelosamine and adp. pyl is also able to  ligate 2-oxoglutarate to other 4-amino-sugar derivatives to form udp-yelose, udp-solosamine, and udp-aravonose. characterizing the metabolic pathways involved in the formation of modified nucleotide sugars provides a basis for understanding some of the mechanisms used by bacteria to modify or alter their cell surface polysaccharides in response to changing growth and environmental challenges.

TI  == synthesis, characterization and antibacterial activity of biodegradable films prepared from schiff bases of zein.
AB  == pure zein is known to be very hydrophobic, but is still inappropriate for coating and film applications because of their brittle nature. in an attempt to improve the flexibility and the antimicrobial activity of these coatings and films, chemical modification of zein through forming schiff bases with different phenolic aldhydes was tried. influence of this modifications on mechanical, topographical, wetting properties and antimicrobial activity of zein films were evaluated. the chemical structure of the schiff bases films were characterized by atr-ftir spectroscopy. the results indicate an improvement in mechanical properties with chemically modification of zein to form schiff bases leading to a reduction in the elastic modulus. an increase in the elongation at break has been observed, but with slight influence on tensile strength. plasticized zein films have similar initial contact angle ( approximately 40 degrees ). an increase in reaction temperature and time increases film's affinity towards water. as shown by contact angle measurements, a noticeable relation was found between film composition and the hydrophilicity. surface topography also varied by forming schiff bases, becoming rougher than zein-based films. the antibacterial activities of zein and schiff bases of zein-based films were investigated against gram-positive bacteria (listeria innocua, listeria monocytogenes, bacillus cereus and clostridium sporogenes) and gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, yersinia enterocolitica and salmonella enterica). it was found that the antibacterial activity of the schiff bases-based films was more effective than that of zein-based films.

TI  == immunomodulatory effect of non-viable components of probiotic culture stimulated  with heat-inactivated escherichia coli and bacillus cereus on holoxenic mice.
AB  == background: competition of probiotic bacteria with other species from the intestinal microbiota involves different mechanisms that occur regardless of probiotics' viability. the objective of this paper was to assess the cytokine serum levels in holoxenic mice after oral administration of non-viable components (nvc) of enterococcus faecium probiotic culture stimulated with heat-inactivated  escherichia coli and bacillus cereus in comparison to nvc of unstimulated e. faecium probiotic culture. methods: probiotic e. faecium cmgb 16 culture, grown in the presence of heat-inactivated cultures of e. coli and b. cereus cmgb 102, was subsequently separated into supernatant (sn) and heat-inactivated cellular sediment (cs) fractions by centrifugation. each nvc was orally administered to holoxenic mice (balb c mouse strain), in three doses, given at 24 hours. blood samples were collected from the retinal artery, at 7, 14, and 21 days after the first administration of the nvc. the serum concentrations of il-12 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) interleukins were assessed by elisa method. results: after the oral administration of sn component obtained from the probiotic culture stimulated with heat-inactivated cultures of b. cereus cmgb 102 and e. coli o28, the serum concentrations of il-12 were maintained higher in the  samples collected at 7 and 14 days post-administration. no specific tnf-alpha profile could be established, depending on stimulated or non-stimulated probiotic culture, nvc fraction, or harvesting time. conclusion: the obtained results demonstrate that non-viable fractions of probiotic bacteria, stimulated by other  bacterial species, could induce immunostimulatory effects mediated by cytokines and act, therefore, as immunological adjuvants.

TI  == prevalence and characterization of foodborne pathogens from australian dairy farm environments.
AB  == the ability of foodborne pathogens to gain entry into food supply systems remains an ongoing concern. in dairy products, raw milk acts as a major vehicle for this  transfer; however, the sources of pathogenic bacteria that contaminate raw milk are often not clear, and environmental sources of contamination or the animals themselves may contribute to the transfer. this survey examined the occurrence of 9 foodborne pathogens in raw milk and environments of 7 dairy farms (3 bovine, 3  caprine, and 1 ovine farm) in summer and autumn, in victoria, australia. a total  of 120 samples were taken from sampling points common to dairy farms, including pasture, soil, feed, water sources, animal feces, raw milk, and milk filters. the prevalence of the bacillus cereus group, campylobacter, clostridium perfringens,  cronobacter, shiga-toxigenic escherichia coli, listeria, salmonella, coagulase-positive staphylococci (cps), and yersinia enterocolitica across the farms was investigated. the 2 most prevalent bacteria, which were detected on all farms, were the b. cereus group, isolated from 41% of samples, followed by cl. perfringens, which was isolated from 38% of samples. the highest occurrence of any pathogen was the b. cereus group in soil, present in 93% of samples tested. fecal samples showed the highest diversity of pathogens, containing 7 of the 9 pathogens tested. salmonella was isolated from 1 bovine farm, although it was found in multiple samples on both visits. out of the 14 occurrences where any pathogen was detected in milk filters, only 5 (36%) of the corresponding raw milk samples collected at the same time were positive for the same pathogen. all of the cps were staphylococcus aureus, and were found in raw milk or milk filter samples from 6 of the 7 farms, but not in other sample types. pathogenic listeria species were detected on 3 of the 7 farms, and included 4 l. ivanovii-positive samples, and 1 l. monocytogenes-positive water sample. shiga-toxigenic escherichia coli were identified in fecal samples from 3 of the 7 farms and in a  single raw milk sample. cronobacter species were identified on 4 of the 7 farms,  predominantly in feed samples. no y. enterocolitica was detected. results of this study demonstrate high standards of pathogen safety across the 7 farms, with a low incidence of pathogens detected in raw milk samples. monitoring feed contamination levels may help control the spread of bacterial species such as cl. perfringens and b. cereus through the farm environment, which is a natural reservoir for these organisms.

TI  == development of biopolymer nanocomposite for silver nanoparticles and ciprofloxacin controlled release.
AB  == screening of biopolymeric gel beads containing silver nanoparticles (ag-nps) stabilized in guar gum alkyl amine (ggaa) and ciprofloxacin (cip) was carried out in order to obtain a novel nanocomposite with controlled release profile of both  antimicrobians. the selected matrix composed of alginate/high methoxyl pectin (hmp)/ggaa (4:4:1) was able to co-incorporate ag-nps and cip with encapsulation efficiency higher than 70%. sem images revealed good cohesivity and compatibility between the biopolymers and the cargos. beads provided protection against ag-nps  degradation at acidic phs and hmp would played a key role providing hydrophobic regions. while cip release profile showed a ph independent diffusional process, ag-nps release was restricted to matrix erodability. calcium quelating agents and/or alginate degrading enzymes could modulate the release profile. the bactericidal activity of beads was tested in liquid medium, showing cooperative effects between the antimicrobials against pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, bacillus cereus and staphylococcus aureus. tem images confirmed interaction of ag-nps with bacterial surfaces followed by membrane damage. results suggested  the nanocomposite matrix as a promising system for oral treatment of intestinal infectious diseases caused by multidrug resistant and unknown microorganisms, since both cip and ag-nps would be able to reach intestine in the active form.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of antarctic bryozoans: an ecological perspective with potential for clinical applications.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of antarctic bryozoans and the ecological functions of the chemical compounds involved remain largely unknown. to determine the significant ecological and applied antimicrobial effects, 16 ether and 16 butanol extracts obtained from 13 different bryozoan species were tested against six antarctic (including psychrobacter luti, shewanella livingstonensis and 4 new isolated strains) and two bacterial strains from culture collections (escherichia coli and bacillus cereus). results from the bioassays reveal that all ether extracts exhibited antimicrobial activity against some bacteria. only one butanol extract produced inhibition, indicating that antimicrobial compounds are mainly lipophilic. ether extracts of the genus camptoplites inhibited the majority of bacterial strains, thus indicating a broad-spectrum of antimicrobial activity. moreover, most ether extracts presented activities against bacterial strains from culture collections, suggesting the potential use of these extracts as antimicrobial drugs against pathogenic bacteria.

TI  == bacteriological quality of vegetables from organic and conventional production in different areas of korea.
AB  == foods grown in organic production systems have been described as representing an  increased risk to public health compared with foods from conventional production. leafy vegetables (spinach, romaine lettuce, and green sesame leaves) grown in organic and conventional systems were collected from various areas in korea and examined using standard culture methods to compare the microbiological quality of the produce grown in the two agricultural systems. the 354 samples of these leafy vegetables were analyzed for levels of indicator bacteria (aerobic bacteria, coliforms, and escherichia coli) and the prevalence of the pathogens staphylococcus aureus, e. coli o157:h7, listeria monocytogenes, bacillus cereus,  and salmonella. aerobic bacteria and coliforms were detected in all vegetable types, but nonpathogenic e. coli was below the limit of detection in all samples. b. cereus was the most prevalent pathogen, found on 7 (11.1%) of the 63 organic spinach samples. the prevalence of s. aureus was highest in organic sesame leaves; it was found on 5 (8.0%) of the 63 samples. the prevalence of l. monocytogenes was highest on organic romaine lettuce and spinach; it was found in 4 (6.4%) of 63 samples of each type of vegetable. e. coli o157:h7 found on only 1 (1.58%) of 55 conventional spinach samples. these results suggest that farming type at most only slightly affects the hygienic quality of leafy vegetables, and  no effect was found for sample collection area. salmonella was not isolated from  any of the conventional or organic leafy vegetables. these results do not support the hypothesis that organic produce poses a substantially greater risk of pathogen contamination than does conventional produce.

TI  == behavior of transition state regulator abrb in batch cultures of bacillus thuringiensis.
AB  == the transition state regulator abrb is involved in the regulation of various cellular functions such as exponential growth, transition state and sporulation onset, due to its ability to activate, suppress or prevent the inappropriate expression of various genes in bacillus subtilis. in order to understand combined behavior in batch cultures of abrb in bacillus thuringiensis, we cloned and expressed the abrb gene of b. thuringiensis in escherichia coli. the deduced sequence of abrb gene coded for a protein consisting of 94 amino acids with ~10.5 kda protein that shares 100 and 85 % identity with those from bacillus cereus and bacillus subtilis. the recombinant abrb protein was used as antigen for the production of rabbit polyclonal antibodies anti-abrb. two media cultures with carbon: nitrogen ratios of 7.0, but varying access to nutrients were tested in batch cultures. in the case of both media, abrb accumulation occurred from the beginning of the process and was maximal during early exponential growth. thereafter, the level of abrb decreased when there were no nutrient limitations and coincided with a decreased value in specific growth rate, although growth continued exponentially. nonetheless, sporulation onset was determined 3 h and 4  h later, in media with highly metabolizable nutrients clean medium and farrera medium, respectively. hence, the maximal level of abrb accumulation in batch cultures of b. thuringiensis is not influenced by limiting nutrients; however, nutrient availability affects the required time lapse for transition state regulator accumulation.

AB  == ceftiofur is a highly effective veterinary cephalosporin, yet it is rapidly degraded by bacteria in the gut. the goal of this work was to directly determine  the mechanism of ceftiofur degradation by the bovine intestinal isolate bacillus  cereus p41. b. cereus p41 was isolated from the feces of a cow that had not been  treated with cephalosporins, and was found to rapidly degrade ceftiofur in culture. analysis of spent culture media by hplc/uv and hplc/ms revealed one major metabolite of ceftiofur, with a negative ion m/z of 127. comparison of ceftiofur, ceftriaxone, and cefpodoxime degradation suggested that the major stable ceftiofur metabolite was the thiofuroic acid group eliminated from the c-3 position of the drug after hydrolysis by beta-lactamase. genomic dna from b. cereus p41 was cloned into escherichia coli, and the transformants were screened  for growth in the presence of ceftiofur. dna sequencing of the plasmid phsg299-bc-3 insert revealed the presence of a gene encoding a metallo-beta-lactamase. incubation of ceftiofur with either the e. coli transformant or a commercial b. cereus metallo-beta-lactamase showed degradation  of the drug and formation of the same major metabolite produced by b. cereus p41. these data demonstrate that a metallo-beta-lactamase plays a major role in the degradation of ceftiofur by the bovine intestinal bacterium b. cereus p41.

TI  == characterization of a novel manduca sexta beta-1, 3-glucan recognition protein (betagrp3) with multiple functions.
AB  == recognition of pathogens by insect pattern recognition receptors is critical to mount effective immune responses. in this study, we reported a new member (betagrp3) of the beta-1, 3-glucan recognition protein (betagrp) family from the  tobacco hornworm manduca sexta. unlike other members of the m. sexta betagrp family proteins, which contain an n-terminal small glucan binding domain and a c-terminal large glucanase-like domain, betagrp3 is 40-45 residues shorter at the n-terminus and lacks the small glucan binding domain. the glucanase-like domain of betagrp3 is most similar to that of m. sexta microbe binding protein (mbp) with 78% identity. betagrp3 transcript was mainly expressed in the fat body, and  both its mrna and protein levels were not induced by microorganisms in larvae. recombinant betagrp3 purified from drosophila s2 cells could bind to several gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria and yeast, as well as to laminarin (beta-1, 3-glucan), mannan, lipopolysaccharide (lps), lipoteichoic acid (lta), and meso-diaminopimelic acid (dap)-type peptidoglycan (pg), but did not bind to lysine-type pg. binding of betagrp3 to laminarin could be competed well by free laminarin, mannan, lps and lta, but almost not competed by free pgs. recombinant  betagrp3 could agglutinate bacillus cereus and escherichia coli in a calcium-dependent manner and showed antibacterial (bacteriostatic) activity against b. cereus, novel functions that have not been reported for the betagrp family proteins before. m. sexta betagrp3 may serve as an immune surveillance receptor with multiple functions.

TI  == antibacterial, antiviral, and antifungal properties of wines and winery byproducts in relation to their flavonoid content.
AB  == grapes produce organic compounds that may be involved in the defense of the plants against invading phytopathogens. these metabolites include numerous phenolic compounds that are also active against human pathogens. grapes are used  to produce a variety of wines, grape juices, and raisins. grape pomace, seeds, and skins, the remains of the grapes that are a byproduct of winemaking, also contain numerous bioactive compounds that differ from those found in grapes and wines. this overview surveys and interprets our present knowledge of the activities of wines and winery byproducts and some of their bioactive components  against foodborne (bacillus cereus, campylobacter jejuni, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella enterica, staphylococcus aureus, yersinia enterocolitica, vibrio cholerae, vibrio vulnificus), medical (helicobacter pylori, klebsiella pneumoniae), and oral pathogenic bacteria, viruses (adeno, cytomegalo, hepatitis, noro, rota), fungi (candida albicans, botrytis cinerea), parasites (eimeria tenella, trichomonas vaginalis), and microbial toxins (ochratoxin a, shiga toxin) in culture, in vivo, and in/on food (beef, chicken, frankfurters, hot dogs, lettuce, oysters, peppers, pork, sausages, soup, spinach) in relation to composition and sensory properties. also covered are antimicrobial wine marinades, antioxidative and immunostimulating aspects, and adverse effects  associated with wine consumption. the collated information and suggested research needs might facilitate and guide further studies needed to optimize the use of wines and byproducts to help improve microbial food safety and prevent or treat animal and human infections.

TI  == influence of acetylation degree and molecular weight of homogeneous chitosans on  antibacterial and antifungal activities.
AB  == the results given in the literature are conflicting when considering the relationship between antimicrobial activity and chitosan characteristics. to be able to clarify, we prepared fifteen homogeneous chitosans with different acetylation degrees (da) and molecular weights (mw) by reacetylation of a fully deacetylated chitin under homogeneous conditions. they were tested at different ph values for their antimicrobial activities against four gram-negative bacteria  (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae and salmonella typhi), four gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis and micrococcus luteus) and three fungi (aspergillus niger, fusarium oxysporum and alternaria solani). chitosans markedly inhibited growth of most bacteria and fungi tested, although the inhibitory effect depends on the type of microorganism and on the chitosan characteristics (da and mw) with minimum inhibitory concentrations in the range of 0.001 to 0.1 w%. considering chitosan efficiency on bacteria, our series of data clearly show that the lower da and the lower ph give the larger efficiency. antibacterial activity was further enhanced for gram-negative bacteria with decreasing mw, whereas, opposite effect was observed with the gram-positive. concerning the antifungal activity, the influence of chitosan characteristics was dependent on the particular type of fungus. fungal growth decreased with increasing mw for f. oxysporum and decreasing da for a. solani, but no mw or da dependences were observed with a. niger.

TI  == the genetic diversity of cereulide biosynthesis gene cluster indicates a composite transposon tnces in emetic bacillus weihenstephanensis.
AB  == background: cereulide is a cyclic dodecadepsipeptide ionophore, produced via non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (nrps), which in rare cases can lead to human death. early studies had shown that emetic toxin formation belongs to a homogeneous group of bacillus cereus sensu stricto and the genetic determinants of cereulide (a 24-kb gene cluster of ceshptabcd) are located on a 270-kb plasmid related to the bacillus anthracis virulence plasmid pxo1. results: the whole genome sequences from seven emetic isolates, including two b. cereus sensu stricto and five bacillus weihenstephanensis strains, were compared, and their inside and adjacent dna sequences of the cereulide biosynthesis gene clusters were analyzed. the sequence diversity was observed, which classified the seven emetic isolates into three clades. different genomic locations of the cereulide biosynthesis gene clusters, plasmid-borne and chromosome-borne, were also found.  potential mobile genetic elements (mges) were identified in the flanking sequences of the ces gene cluster in all three types. the most striking observation was the identification of a putative composite transposon, tnces, consisting of two copies of isces element (belonging to is6 family) in opposite orientations flanking the ces gene cluster in emetic b. weihenstephanensis. the mobility of this element was tested by replacing the ces gene cluster by a kmr gene marker and performing mating-out transposition assays in escherichia coli. the results showed that tnces::km transposes efficiently (1.04 x 10(-3) t/r) and  produces 8-bp direct repeat (dr) at the insertion sites. conclusions: cereulide biosynthesis gene clusters display sequence diversity, different genomic locations and association with mges, in which the transposition capacity of a resistant derivative of the composite transposon tnces in e. coli was demonstrated. further study is needed to look for appropriate genetic tools to analysis the transposition of tnces in bacillus spp. and the dynamics of other mges flanking the ces gene clusters.

TI  == characterization of the cell surface properties of drinking water pathogens by microbial adhesion to hydrocarbon and electrophoretic mobility measurements.
AB  == the surface characteristics of microbial cells directly influence their mobility  and behavior within aqueous environments. the cell surface hydrophobicity (csh) and electrophoretic mobility (epm) of microbial cells impact a number of interactions and processes including aggregation, adhesion to surfaces, and stability of the cells within the aqueous environments. these cell characteristics are unique to the bacterial species and are a reflection of the large diversity of surface structures, proteins, and appendages of microorganisms. csh and epm of bacterial cells contribute substantially to the effectiveness of drinking water treatment to remove them, and therefore an investigation of these properties will be useful in predicting their removal through drinking water treatment processes and transport through drinking water distribution systems. epm and csh measurements of six microbiological pathogen or surrogate species suspended in phosphate-buffered water are reported in this work. two strains of vibrio cholerae were hydrophobic, while three strains of escherichia coli were hydrophilic. bacillus cereus was categorized as moderately  hydrophobic. the strains of e. coli had the highest (most negative) epm. based on the measurements, e. coli species is predicted to be most difficult to remove from water while v. cholerae will be the easiest to remove.

TI  == expression of ciona intestinalis variable region-containing chitin-binding proteins during development of the gastrointestinal tract and their role in host-microbe interactions.
AB  == variable region-containing chitin-binding proteins (vcbps) are secreted, immune-type molecules that have been described in both amphioxus, a cephalochordate, and sea squirt, ciona intestinalis, a urochordate. in adult ciona, vcbp-a, -b and -c are expressed in hemocytes and the cells of the gastrointestinal tract. vcbp-c binds bacteria in the stomach lumen and functions  as an opsonin in vitro. in the present paper the expression of vcbps has been characterized during development using in situ hybridization, immunohistochemical staining and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qpcr) technologies. the expression of vcbp-a and -c is detected first in discrete areas of larva endoderm and becomes progressively localized during differentiation in the stomach and intestine, marking the development of gut tracts. in "small adults" (1-2 cm juveniles) expression of vcbp-c persists and vcbp-a gradually diminishes, ultimately replaced by expression of vcbp-b. the expression of vcbp-a and -c in stage 7-8 juveniles, at which point animals have already started feeding, is influenced significantly by challenge with either gram-positive or -negative bacteria. a potential role for vcbps in gut-microbiota interactions and homeostasis is indicated.

AB  == water-based chitosans in the forms of oligochitosan (oligocs) and nanowhisker chitosan (cswk) are proposed as a novel food preservative based on a minced pork  model study. the high surface area with a positive charge over the neutral ph range (ph 5-8) of oligocs and cswk lead to an inhibition against gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, listeria monocytogenes, and bacillus cereus) and gram-negative microbes (salmonella enteritidis and escherichia coli o157:h7). in  the minced pork model, oligocs effectively performs a food preservative for shelf-life extension as clarified from the retardation of microbial growth, biogenic amine formation and lipid oxidation during the storage. oligocs maintains almost all myosin heavy chain protein degradation as observed in the electrophoresis. the present work points out that water-based chitosan with its unique morphology not only significantly inhibits antimicrobial activity but also maintains the meat quality with an extension of shelf-life, and thus has the potential to be used as a food preservative.

TI  == antibacterial activities and in vitro anti-inflammatory (membrane stability) properties of methanolic extracts of gardenia coronaria leaves.
AB  == this work is carried out with gardenia coronaria leaves that belong to the family rubiaceae, which is a small-to-medium-sized but tall, deciduous tree, 7.6-9 m high on an average. leaves are used for the treatment of rheumatic pain and bronchitis. the leaf of the plant consists of coronalolide, coronalolic acid, coronalolide methyl ester, ethyl coronalolate acetate triterpenes (secocycloartanes), and so forth. methanol extract from the leaves of gardenia coronaria was completely screened for membrane stability and antibacterial activity. the lower concentrations of methanolic leaf extract of gardenia coronaria gave good antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activity, but higher concentrations gave relatively more projecting antibacterial activity in vitro as compared with kanamycin. the crude drug's anti-inflammatory effects were compared with those of aspirin as positive control. the methanolic extracts of gardenia coronaria leaves possessed a broad spectrum antibacterial activity against a variety of both gram-negative and gram-positive organisms like streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacillus cereus, shigella sonnei, shigella boydii, and proteus mirabilis, with a zone of inhibition from 10 to 16 mm. the extract also showed good membrane stability to be considered as having significant anti-inflammatory action.

TI  == survival of foodborne pathogenic bacteria (bacillus cereus, escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, staphylococcus aureus, and listeria monocytogenes) and bacillus cereus spores in fermented alcoholic beverages (beer and refined rice wine).
AB  == only limited information is available on the microbiological safety of fermented  alcoholic beverages because it is still a common belief that such beverages do not provide a favorable environment for bacterial growth and survival. thus, in this study, we examined the survival of major foodborne pathogens and spores in fermented alcoholic beverages. foodborne pathogens (bacillus cereus, escherichia  coli o157:h7, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, and staphylococcus aureus) and b. cereus spores (initial population, 3 to 4 log cfu/ml) were inoculated separately into three types of beer and refined rice wine, which were then stored at 5 and 22 degrees c. bacterial counts were assayed periodically for up to 28 days. vegetative b. cereus counts decreased rapidly, whereas b. cereus spore counts remained constant (p > 0.05) for a long period of  time in all beverages. vegetative b. cereus cells formed spores in beer at 5 and  22 degrees c, and the spores survived for long periods. among vegetative cells, e. coli o157:h7 had the highest survival (only 1.49 to 1.56 log reduction during  28 days in beer at 5 degrees c). beer and refined rice wine supported microbial survival from several days to several weeks. our results appear to contradict the common belief that pathogens cannot survive in alcoholic beverages. long-term survival of pathogens (especially b. cereus and e. coli o157:h7) in beer and refined rice wine should be taken into consideration by the manufacturers of these beverages. this study provides basic information that should help further research into microbial survival in alcoholic beverages and increase the microbiological safety regulation of fermented alcoholic beverages.

TI  == evaluation of a rapid colorimetric assay for detection of bacterial contamination in apheresis and pooled random-donor platelet units.
AB  == background: despite existing strategies, bacterial contamination of platelets (plts) remains a problem, and reliable testing near the time of use is needed. we evaluated the bactx assay (immunetics, inc.), a rapid colorimetric assay for detection of bacterial peptidoglycan, for this purpose. study design and methods: apheresis- and whole blood-derived plt units, the latter tested in 6-unit pools,  inoculated with 10 representative bacterial species (eight aerobic, two anaerobic), were tested with the bactx assay at two sites to determine analytic sensitivity and time to detection. specificity on sterile plts and reproducibility across different plt units and assay kit lots was also determined. results: analytical sensitivity for the 10 bacterial species ranged from 6.3 x 10(2) to 7.6 x 10(4) colony-forming units (cfus)/ml. in time-to-detection studies after inoculation of plts with 0.7 to 5.3 cfus/ml, 10 replicates of all eight aerobic species were positive when bacterial titers were  above the analytic sensitivity detection limit, which occurred at 48 hours for 60 plt units and at 72 hours for the remaining 4 units, as well as at 7 days for all units. specificity was 99.8% and reproducibility was 100%. conclusions: the bactx assay had an analytical sensitivity below the 10(5) cfus/ml threshold of clinical significance, detected all eight aerobic bacterial species 48 to 72 hours after inoculation as well as at 7 days, and had high specificity and reproducibility. these findings suggest that the bactx assay will be a valuable test for detection of clinically relevant levels of bacterial contaminants in plt units and pools near time of use.

TI  == crystal and solution structure analysis of fhud2 from staphylococcus aureus in multiple unliganded conformations and bound to ferrioxamine-b.
AB  == iron acquisition is a central process for virtually all organisms. in staphylococcus aureus, fhud2 is a lipoprotein that is a high-affinity receptor for iron-bound hydroxamate siderophores. in this study, fhud2 was crystallized bound to ferrioxamine-b (fxb), and also in its ligand-free state; the latter structures are the first for hydroxamate-binding receptors within this protein family. the structure of the fhud2-fxb conformation shows that residues w197 and  r199 from the c-terminal domain donate hydrogen bonds to the hydroxamate oxygens, and a ring of aromatic residues cradles the aliphatic arms connecting the hydroxamate moieties of the siderophore. the available ligand-bound structures of fhud from escherichia coli and yfiy from bacillus cereus show that, despite a high degree of structural conservation, three protein families have evolved with  critical siderophore binding residues on either the c-terminal domain (s. aureus), the n-terminal domain (e. coli), or both (b. cereus). unliganded fhud2 was crystallized in five conformations related by rigid body movements of the n-  and c-terminal domains. small-angle x-ray scattering (saxs) indicates that the solution conformation of unliganded fhud2 is more compact than the conformations  observed in crystals. the ligand-induced conformational changes for fhud2 in solution are relatively modest and depend on the identity of the siderophore. the crystallographic and saxs results are used to discuss roles for the liganded and  unliganded forms of fhud2 in the siderophore transport mechanism.

TI  == colloidal polyaniline dispersions: antibacterial activity, cytotoxicity and neutrophil oxidative burst.
AB  == polyaniline colloids rank among promising application forms of this conducting polymer. cytotoxicity, antibacterial activity, and neutrophil oxidative burst tests were performed on cells treated with colloidal polyaniline dispersions. the antibacterial effect of colloidal polyaniline against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria was most pronounced for bacillus cereus and escherichia coli, with a minimum inhibitory concentration of 3,500 mug ml(-1). the data recorded on human keratinocyte (hacat) and a mouse embryonic fibroblast (nih/3t3) cell lines using an mtt assay and flow cytometry indicated a concentration-dependent cytotoxicity of colloid, with the absence of cytotoxic effect at around 150 mug ml(-1). the neutrophil oxidative burst test then showed  that colloidal polyaniline, in concentrations <150 mug ml(-1), was not able to stimulate the production of reactive oxygen species in neutrophils and whole human blood. however, it worked efficiently as a scavenger of those already formed.

TI  == cerecidins, novel lantibiotics from bacillus cereus with potent antimicrobial activity.
AB  == lantibiotics are ribosomally synthesized and posttranslationally modified antimicrobial peptides that are widely produced by gram-positive bacteria, including many species of the bacillus group. in the present study, one novel gene cluster coding lantibiotic cerecidins was unveiled in bacillus cereus strain as 1.1846 through genomic mining and pcr screening. the designated cer locus is different from that of conventional class ii lantibiotics in that it included seven tandem precursor cera genes, one modification gene (cerm), two processing genes (cert and cerp), one orphan regulator gene (cerr), and two immunity genes (cerf and cere). in addition, one unprecedented quorum sensing component, comqxpa, was inserted between cerm and cerr. the expression of cerecidins was not detected in this strain of b. cereus, which might be due to repressed transcription of cerm. we constitutively coexpressed cera genes and cerm in escherichia coli, and purified precerecidins were proteolytically processed with  the endoproteinase gluc and a truncated version of putative serine protease cerp. thus, two natural variants of cerecidins a1 and a7 were obtained which contained  two terminal nonoverlapping thioether rings rarely found in lantibiotics. both cerecidins a1 and a7 were active against a broad spectrum of gram-positive bacteria. cerecidin a7, especially its mutant dhb13a, showed remarkable efficacy  against multidrug-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mdrsa), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis (vre), and even streptomyces.

TI  == antimicrobial and physical-mechanical properties of agar-based films incorporated with grapefruit seed extract.
AB  == the use of synthetic petroleum based packaging films caused serious environmental problems due to their difficulty in recycling and poor biodegradability. therefore, present study was aimed to develop natural biopolymer-based antimicrobial packaging films as an alternative for the synthetic packaging films. as a natural antimicrobial agent, grapefruit seed extract (gse) has been incorporated into agar to prepare antimicrobial packaging film. the films with different concentrations of gse were prepared by a solvent casting method and the resulting composite films were examined physically and mechanically. in addition, the films were characterized by fe-sem, xrd, ft-ir and tga. the incorporation of  gse caused increase in color, uv barrier, moisture content, water solubility and  water vapor permeability, while decrease in surface hydrophobicity, tensile strength and elastic modulus of the films. as the concentration of gse increased  from 0.6 to 13.3 mug/ml, the physical and mechanical properties of the films were affected significantly. the addition of gse changed film microstructure of the film, but did not influence the crystallinity of agar and thermal stability of the agar-based films. the agar/gse films exhibited distinctive antimicrobial activity against three test food pathogens, such as listeria monocytogenes, bacillus cereus and escherichia coli. these results suggest that agar/gse films have potential to be used in an active food packaging systems for maintaining food safety and extending the shelf-life of the packaged food.

TI  == food-borne pathogens of animal origin-diagnosis, prevention, control and their zoonotic significance: a review.
AB  == the term food borne diseases or food-borne illnesses or more commonly food poisoning are used to denote gastrointestinal complications that occur following  recent consumption of a particular food or drink. millions of people suffer worldwide every year and the situation is quiet grave in developing nations creating social and economic strain. the food borne pathogens include various bacteria viz., salmonella, campylobacter, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, yersinia enterocolitica, staphylococcus, arcobacter, clostridium perfringens, cl. botulinum and bacillus cereus and helminths viz., taenia. they also include protozoa viz., trichinella, sarcocystis, toxoplasma gondii and cryptosporidium parvum. the zoonotic potential and the ability to elaborate toxins by many of the microbes causing fatal intoxication are sufficient to understand the seriousness of the situation. the viral agents being host specific their transmission to humans through food of animal origin is not yet confirmed although these animal viruses are similar to that of viruses infecting human. food-borne bacteria; protozoa and helminthes have complex distribution pattern in the environment and inside the host system. this along with complexity of the maintenance chain and life cycle (of parasites) has made it difficult for epidemiologist and diagnostician to undertake any immediate safety measures against them. serological and molecular diagnostic tests viz. elisa, latex agglutination test, lateral flow assays, immunomagnetic separation assays, molecular assays viz. polymerase chain reaction (pcr), multiplex pcr, immuno-pcr, realtime pcr, random amplified polymorphic dna (rapd)-pcr, dna microarrays and probes are widely used. along with these lamp assays, capillary electrophoresis-single strand confirmation polymorphism (ce-sscp); flow cytometry, fish, biosensors, direct epifluorescent filter technique, nanotechnology based methods and sophisticated tools (ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging and chlonangio-pancreatography) have aided in the diagnosis greatly. most of the food-borne illnesses are self-limiting but in many instances antibiotics are recommended. with the increased drug resistance however use of chicken immunoglobulin, bacteriophage therapy, probiotics and herbs are gaining much importance these days. adoption of proper prevention and control measures (including cooking procedures; hygiene, strict adherence to haccp principles, public awareness and disease surveillance and monitoring) are the need of hour. all these have been discussed vividly in this review to help epidemiologists, diagnosticians, clinicians and above all common people so as to enable them avoid negligence regarding such serious issue.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of traditional medicinal plants from ankober district, north shewa zone, amhara region, ethiopia.
AB  == context: traditional medicinal plants have long been used in ethiopia to treat human and livestock ailments. despite a well-documented rich tradition of medicinal plant use in the country, their direct antimicrobial effects are still  poorly known. objective: to investigate the antimicrobial activity of 19 medicinal plant species that were selected based on the ethnobotanical information on their traditional use to treat infectious diseases in ankober district. methods: about 23 different ethanol extracts of plants obtained by maceration of various parts of 19 medicinal plant species were studied for potential antimicrobial activity using a broth microdilution method against bacillus cereus, bacteroides fragilis, candida albicans, clostridium perfringens, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella enteritidis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and streptococcus pyogenes. results: plant extracts from embelia schimperi vatke (myrsinaceae) showed the strongest antibacterial activity with a  minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) value of 64 microg/ml against b. cereus, l. monocytogenes, and s. pyogenes. growth inhibitory activities were also observed for extracts of ocimum lamiifolium hochst. (lamiaceae) against s. pyogenes, and those of rubus steudneri schweinf. (rosaceae) against s. epidermidis at an mic value of 128 microg/ml. generally, 74% of ethanol extracts  (17 extracts) showed antimicrobial activity against one or more of the microbial  strains tested at an mic value of 512 microg/ml or below. discussion and conclusions: results confirm the antimicrobial role of traditional medicinal plants of ankober and warrant further investigations on promising medicinal plant species so as to isolate and characterise chemicals responsible for the observed  strong antimicrobial activities.

TI  == antibacterial activity of different natural honeys from transylvania, romania.
AB  == honey is used in food industry and medicine due to its nutritive, therapeutic and dietetic qualities. the microbiological characteristics of 10 unpasteurized honey samples of known origin, collected from transylvania beekeepers (romania) were determined. the antibacterial activity of these types of honey against escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, salmonella enteritidis, salmonella anatum, salmonella choleraesuis, bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis subsp. spizizenii and listeria monocytogenes strains was studied. the most sensitive to the antibacterial activity were the two staphylococus strains (the largest diameter of inhibition zone was 18 mm) and b.  subtilis strains (13.5 mm). the strains of b. cereus, e. coli, l. monocytogenes and salmonella spp. were found to present resistance to some of the honey samples. manna, sunflower and polyfloral honeys presented high antibacterial activity while acacia and linden honeys had a lower activity in terms of the number of sensible strains. statistical analysis shows that the type of strains and the type of honey have influence on the diameter of inhibition.

TI  == psp: rapid identification of orthologous coding genes under positive selection across multiple closely related prokaryotic genomes.
AB  == background: with genomic sequences of many closely related bacterial strains made available by deep sequencing, it is now possible to investigate trends in prokaryotic microevolution. positive selection is a sub-process of microevolution, in which a particular mutation is favored, causing the allele frequency to continuously shift in one direction. wide scanning of prokaryotic genomes has shown that positive selection at the molecular level is much more frequent than expected. genes with significant positive selection may play key roles in bacterial adaption to different environmental pressures. however, selection pressure analyses are computationally intensive and awkward to configure. results: here we describe an open access web server, which is designated as psp (positive selection analysis for prokaryotic genomes) for performing evolutionary analysis on orthologous coding genes, specially designed  for rapid comparison of dozens of closely related prokaryotic genomes. remarkably, psp facilitates functional exploration at the multiple levels by assignments and enrichments of ko, go or cog terms. to illustrate this user-friendly tool, we analyzed escherichia coli and bacillus cereus genomes and  found that several genes, which play key roles in human infection and antibiotic  resistance, show significant evidence of positive selection. psp is freely available to all users without any login requirement at: http://db-mml.sjtu.edu.cn/psp/. conclusions: psp ultimately allows researchers to do genome-scale analysis for evolutionary selection across multiple prokaryotic genomes rapidly and easily, and identify the genes undergoing positive selection, which may play key roles in the interactions of host-pathogen and/or environmental adaptation.

TI  == alcoholytic cleavage of polyhydroxyalkanoate chains by class iv synthases induced by endogenous and exogenous ethanol.
AB  == polyhydroxyalkanoate (pha)-producing bacillus strains express class iv pha synthase, which is composed of the subunits phar and phac. recombinant escherichia coli expressing pha synthase from bacillus cereus strain yb-4 (pharcyb-4) showed an unusual reduction of the molecular weight of pha produced during the stationary phase of growth. nuclear magnetic resonance analysis of the low-molecular-weight pha revealed that its carboxy end structure was capped by ethanol, suggesting that the molecular weight reduction was the result of alcoholytic cleavage of pha chains by pharcyb-4 induced by endogenous ethanol. this scission reaction was also induced by exogenous ethanol in both in vivo and  in vitro assays. in addition, pharcyb-4 was observed to have alcoholysis activity for pha chains synthesized by other synthases. the pha synthase from bacillus megaterium (pharcbm) from another subgroup of class iv synthases was also assayed and was shown to have weak alcoholysis activity for pha chains. these results suggest that class iv synthases may commonly share alcoholysis activity as an inherent feature.

TI  == a one-pot system for production of l-2-aminobutyric acid from l-threonine by l-threonine deaminase and a nadh-regeneration system based on l-leucine dehydrogenase and formate dehydrogenase.
AB  == l-2-aminobutyric acid (l-aba) is an unnatural amino acid that is a key intermediate for the synthesis of several important drugs. it can be produced by  transaminase or dehydrogenase from alpha-ketobutyric acid, which can be synthesized enzymatically from the bulk amino acid, l-threonine. deamination of l-threonine followed by a hydrogenation reaction gave almost the theoretical yield and was estimated to be more cost-effective than the established chemical process. l-threonine deaminase from escherichia coli, l-leucine dehydrogenase from bacillus cereus, and formate dehydrogenase from pseudomonas sp. were over-expressed in e. coli and used for one-pot production of l-aba with formate as a co-substrate for nadh regeneration. 30 mol l-threonine were converted to 29.2 mol l-aba at 97.3 % of theoretical yield and with productivity of 6.37 g l(-1) h(-1) at 50 l. this process offers a promising approach to fulfil industrial requirements for l-aba.

TI  == the long-term effects of phage concentration on the inhibition of planktonic bacterial cultures.
AB  == since the early 1920s there has been an interest in using bacteriophages (phages) for the control of bacterial pathogens. while there are many factors that have limited the success of phage bio-control, one particular problem is the variability of outcomes between phages and bacteria. specifically, there is a significant need for a better understanding of how initial phage concentrations affect long-term bacterial inhibition. in work reported herein three phages were  isolated for escherichia coli k12, pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1, as well as bacillus cereus and bio-control experiments were performed with phage concentrations ranging from 10(5) to 10(8) plaque forming units per ml over the course of 72 h. for four of the nine phages isolated there was a linear relationship between inhibition and phage concentration, suggesting the effect of phage concentration is important at longer time scales. for three of the isolated phages, phage concentrations had no effect on bacterial inhibition suggesting that even at the lowest concentration the method of action was saturated and lower concentrations might still be effective. additionally, a cocktail was created and was compared to the previously isolated phages. there was no statistical difference between the cocktail and the best performing phage highlighting the importance of selecting the appropriate phages for treatment. these results suggest that, for certain phages, there is a strong relationship between phage concentration and long-term bacterial growth inhibition and the initial phage concentration is an important indicator of the long-term outcome.

AB  == class ib ribonucleotide reductases (rnrs) use a dimetal-tyrosyl radical (y*) cofactor in their nrdf (beta2) subunit to initiate ribonucleotide reduction in the nrde (alpha2) subunit. contrary to the diferric tyrosyl radical (fe(iii)2-y*) cofactor, which can self-assemble from fe(ii)2-nrdf and o2, generation of the mn(iii)2-y* cofactor requires the reduced form of a flavoprotein, nrdihq, and o2  for its assembly. here we report the 1.8 a resolution crystal structure of bacillus cereus fe2-nrdf in complex with nrdi. compared to the previously solved  escherichia coli nrdi-mn(ii)2-nrdf structure, nrdi and nrdf binds similarly in bacillus cereus through conserved core interactions. this protein-protein association seems to be unaffected by metal ion type bound in the nrdf subunit. the bacillus cereus mn(ii)2-nrdf and fe2-nrdf structures, also presented here, show conformational flexibility of residues surrounding the nrdf metal ion site.  the movement of one of the metal-coordinating carboxylates is linked to the metal type present at the dimetal site and not associated with nrdi-nrdf binding. this  carboxylate conformation seems to be vital for the water network connecting the nrdf dimetal site and the flavin in nrdi. from these observations, we suggest that metal-dependent variations in carboxylate coordination geometries are important for active y* cofactor generation in class ib rnrs. additionally, we show that binding of nrdi to nrdf would structurally interfere with the suggested alpha2beta2 (nrde-nrdf) holoenzyme formation, suggesting the potential requirement for nrdi dissociation before nrde-nrdf assembly after nrdi-activation. the mode of interactions between the proteins involved in the class ib rnr system is, however, not fully resolved.

TI  == sodium and potassium competition in potassium-selective and non-selective channels.
AB  == potassium channels selectively conduct k(+), primarily to the exclusion of na(+), despite the fact that both ions can bind within the selectivity filter. here we perform crystallographic titration and single-channel electrophysiology to examine the competition of na(+) and k(+) binding within the filter of two nak channel mutants; one is the potassium-selective nak2k mutant and the other is the non-selective nak2cng, a cng channel pore mimic. with high-resolution structures  of these engineered nak channel constructs, we explicitly describe the changes in k(+) occupancy within the filter upon na(+) competition by anomalous diffraction. our results demonstrate that the non-selective nak2cng still retains a k(+)-selective site at equilibrium, whereas the nak2k channel filter maintains two high-affinity k(+) sites. a double-barrier mechanism is proposed to explain k(+) channel selectivity at low k(+) concentrations.

AB  == in the present study, the effect of different in vitro cultures (callus, in vitro shoots) and commercially available peppercorn extract was investigated for its activity against toxic metabolite-producing strains (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeroginosa, salmonella typhi, bacillus subtilis, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, and candida albicans). these in vitro cultures were extracted with ethanol, hexane, and chloroform, and the antipathogenic activity was determined by well-diffusion method. hexane extract of callus showed 22 mm zone of inhibition against b. cereus, 23 mm against s. aureus, while regenerated  shoots and seeds have shown 24.3 and 26 mm zones of inhibition. the ethanolic extracts of regenerated piper shoots have shown 25 mm activity against s. aureus, 21 mm against b. cereus, and 16 mm in the case of c. albicans in comparison with  standard antibiotics. peppercorn extracts in chloroform and ethanol had shown activities against b. cereus (23.6 mm) and b. subtilis (23.5 mm). during in vitro organogenesis and morphogenesis, cells and tissues produced a comparable phytochemicals profile like mother plant. morphogenesis is critically controlled  by the application of exogenous plant-growth regulators. such addition alters the hormonal transduction pathways, and cells under in vitro conditions regenerate tissues, which are dependant on the physiological state of cells, and finally enhance the production of secondary metabolites. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to compare the antimicrobial potential of in vitro regenerated tissues and peppercorn with standard antibiotics. in conclusion, most of the extracts showed pronounced activities against all the pathogenic microbes. this is a preliminary work, and the minimum inhibitory concentration values needs to be further explored. regenerated tissues of p. nigrum are a good source of biologically active metabolites for antimicrobial activities, and callus culture  presented itself as a good candidate for such activities.

TI  == development of new active packaging film made from a soluble soybean polysaccharide incorporated zataria multiflora boiss and mentha pulegium essential oils.
AB  == an active edible film from soluble soybean polysaccharide (ssps) incorporated with different concentrations of zataria multiflora boiss (zeo) and mentha pulegium (meo) essential oils was developed, and the film's optical, wettability, thermal, total phenol and antioxidant characteristics were investigated, along with their antimicrobial effectiveness against staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, escherichia coli o157:h7, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella typhimurium. the film's colour became darker and more yellowish and had a lower gloss as the levels of zeo or meo were increased. antioxidant activity of the films was determined using 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (dpph), and ferric-reducing antioxidant power assays. dpph was reduced in the range of 19.84-74.12% depending on the essential oil type and concentration. film incorporated with 3% (v/v) zeo showed the highest dpph radical scavenging activity and ferric reducing antioxidant power (ic50=4188.60+/-21.73mg/l and ec50=8.86+/-0.09mg/ml, respectively), compared with the control and meo added film. films containing zeo were more effective against the tested bacteria than those containing meo. s. aureus was found to be the most sensitive bacterium to both zeo or meo, followed by b. cereus and e. coli. a highest inhibition zone of  387.05mm(2) was observed for s. aureus around the films incorporated with 3% (v/v) zeo. the total inhibitory zone of 3% (v/v) meo formulated films was 21.98 for s. typhimurium and 10.15mm(2) for p. aeruginosa. differential scanning calorimetry (dsc) analysis revealed a single glass transition temperature (tg) between 16 and 31 degrees c. the contact angle increased up to 175% and 38% as 3% (v/v) of zeo or meo used: it clearly shows that films with zeo were more hydrophobic than those with meo. the results showed that these two essential oils could be incorporated into ssps films for food packaging.

TI  == potential cellular targets and antibacterial efficacy of atmospheric pressure non-thermal plasma.
AB  == atmospheric pressure non-thermal plasma (apntp) has been gaining increasing interest as a new alternative antibacterial approach. although this approach has  demonstrated promising antibacterial activity, its exact mechanism of action remains unclear. mechanistic elucidation of the antimicrobial activity will facilitate development and rational optimisation of this approach for potential medical applications. in this study, the antibacterial efficacy of an in-house-built apntp jet was evaluated alongside an investigation of the interactions between apntp and major cellular components in order to identify the potential cellular targets involved in plasma-mediated bacterial destruction mechanisms. the investigated plasma jet exhibited excellent, rapid antibacterial  activity against a selected panel of clinically significant bacterial species including bacillus cereus, meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa, all of which were completely inactivated within 2 min of plasma exposure. plasma-mediated damaging effects were observed, to varying degrees, on all of the investigated cellular components including dna, a model protein enzyme, and lipid membrane integrity and permeability. the antibacterial efficacy of apntp appears to involve a multiple-target mechanism, which potentially reduces the likelihood of emergence  of microbial resistance towards this promising antimicrobial approach. however, cellular membrane damage and resulting permeability perturbation was found to be  the most likely rate-determining step in this mechanism.

TI  == functional role of the mrpa- and mrpd-homologous protein subunits in enzyme complexes evolutionary related to respiratory chain complex i.
AB  == nadh:quinone oxidoreductase or complex i is a large membrane bound enzyme complex that has evolved from the combination of smaller functional building blocks. intermediate size enzyme complexes exist in nature that comprise some, but not all of the protein subunits in full size 14-subunit complex i. the membrane spanning complex i subunits nuol, nuom and nuon are homologous to each other and  to two proteins from one particular class of na(+)/h(+) antiporters, denoted mrpa and mrpd. in complex i, these ion transporter protein subunits are prime candidates for harboring important parts of the proton pumping machinery. using a model system, consisting of bacillus subtilis mrpa and mrpd deletion strains and  a low copy expression plasmid, it was recently demonstrated that nuon can rescue  the strain deleted for mrpd but not that deleted for mrpa, whereas the opposite tendency was seen for nuol. this demonstrated that the mrpa-type and mrpd-type proteins have unique functional specializations. in this work, the corresponding  antiporter-like protein subunits from the smaller enzymes evolutionarily related  to complex i were tested in the same model system. the subunits from 11-subunit complex i from bacillus cereus behaved essentially as those from full size complex i, corroborating that this enzyme should be regarded as a bona fide complex i. the hydrogenase-3 and hydrogenase-4 antiporter-like proteins on the other hand, could substitute equally well for mrpa or mrpd at ph7.4, suggesting that these enzymes have intermediate forms of the antiporter-like proteins, which seemingly lack the functional specificity.

AB  == pgiak1 is a 38-kb plasmid originating from the obligate alkaliphilic and halotolerant bacillaceae strain jmak1. the strain was originally isolated from the confined environments of the antarctic concordia station. analysis of the pgiak1 38,362-bp sequence revealed that, in addition to its replication region, this plasmid contains the genetic determinants for cadmium and arsenic resistances, putative methyltransferase, tyrosine recombinase, spore coat protein and potassium transport protein, as well as several hypothetical proteins. cloning the pgiak1 cad operon in bacillus cereus h3081.97 and its ars operon in bacillus subtilis 1a280 conferred to these hosts cadmium and arsenic resistances, respectively, therefore confirming their bona fide activities. the pgiak1 replicon region was also shown to be functional in bacillus thuringiensis, bacillus subtilis and staphylococcus aureus, but was only stably maintained in b. subtilis. finally, using an escherichia coli - b. thuringiensis shuttle bac vector, pgiak1 was shown to display conjugative properties since it was able to transfer the bac plasmid among b. thuringiensis strains.

TI  == yaxab, a yersinia enterocolitica pore-forming toxin regulated by rova.
AB  == the transcriptional regulator rova positively regulates transcription of the yersinia enterocolitica virulence gene inv. invasin, encoded by inv, is important for establishment of y. enterocolitica infection. however, a rova mutant is more  attenuated for virulence than an inv mutant, implying that rova regulates additional virulence genes. when the y. enterocolitica rova regulon was defined by microarray analysis, ye1984 and ye1985 were among the genes identified as being upregulated by rova. since these genes are homologous to xenorhabdus nematophila cytotoxin genes xaxa and xaxb, we named them yaxa and yaxb, respectively. in this work, we demonstrate the effects of yaxab on the course of  infection in the murine model. while a yaxab mutant (deltayaxab) is capable of colonizing mice at the same level as the wild type, it slightly delays the course of infection and results in differing pathology in the spleen. further, we found  that yaxab encode a probable cytotoxin capable of lysing mammalian cells, that both yaxa and yaxb are required for cytotoxic activity, and that the two proteins associate. yaxab-mediated cell death occurs via osmotic lysis through the formation of distinct membrane pores. in silico tertiary structural analysis identified predicted structural homology between yaxa and proteins in pore-forming toxin complexes from bacillus cereus (hbl-b) and escherichia coli (hlye). thus, it appears that yaxab function as virulence factors by inducing cell lysis through the formation of pores in the host cell membrane. this characterization of yaxab supports the hypothesis that rova regulates expression  of multiple virulence factors in y. enterocolitica.

TI  == metal based pharmacologically active agents: synthesis, structural characterization, molecular modeling, ct-dna binding studies and in vitro antimicrobial screening of iron(ii) bromosalicylidene amino acid chelates.
AB  == in recent years, great interest has been focused on fe(ii) schiff base amino acid complexes as cytotoxic and antitumor drugs. thus a series of new iron(ii) complexes based on schiff bases amino acids ligands have been designed and synthesized from condensation of 5-bromosalicylaldehyde (bs) and alpha-amino acids (l-alanine (ala), l-phenylalanine (phala), l-aspartic acid (aspa), l-histidine (his) and l-arginine (arg)). the structure of the investigated iron(ii) complexes was elucidated using elemental analyses, infrared, ultraviolet-visible, thermogravimetric analysis, as well as conductivity and magnetic susceptibility measurements. moreover, the stoichiometry and the stability constants of the prepared complexes have been determined spectrophotometrically. the results suggest that 5-bromosalicylaldehyde amino acid schiff bases (bs:aa) behave as dibasic tridentate ono ligands and coordinate to fe(ii) in octahedral geometry according to the general formula [fe(bs:aa)2].nh2o. the conductivity values between 37 and 64 ohm(-1) mol(-1) cm(2) in ethanol imply the presence of nonelectrolyte species. the structure of the complexes was validated using quantum mechanics calculations based on accurate dft methods. geometry optimization of the fe-schiff base amino acid complexes showed that all complexes had octahedral coordination. in addition, the interaction of these complexes with (ct-dna) was investigated at ph=7.2, by using uv-vis absorption, viscosity and agarose gel electrophoresis measurements. results indicated that the investigated complexes strongly bind to calf thymus dna via intercalative mode and showed a different dna binding according to the sequence: bsari>bshi>bsali>bsasi>bsphali. moreover, the prepared compounds are screened for their in vitro antibacterial and antifungal activity against three types of bacteria, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and bacillus cereus and three types of anti fungal cultures, penicillium purpurogenium, aspergillus flavus and trichotheium rosium. the results of these studies indicated that the metal complexes exhibit a stronger antibacterial and antifungal efficiency than their corresponding schiff base amino acid ligands.

AB  == the cell free culture filtrate of bacillus cereus associated with an entomopathogenic nematode, rhabditis (oscheius) sp. exhibited strong antimicrobial activity. the ethyl acetate extract of the bacterial culture filtrate was purified by silica gel column chromatography to obtain four bioactive compounds. the structure and absolute stereochemistry of these compounds were determined based on extensive spectroscopic analyses (fabms, (1)h  nmr, (13)c nmr, (1)h-(1)h cosy, (1)h-(13)c hmbc) and marfey's method. the compounds were identified as cyclic dipeptides (cdps): cyclo(l-pro-l-trp), cyclo(l-leu-l-val), cyclo(d-pro-d-met), and cyclo(d-pro-d-phe), respectively. compounds recorded significant antibacterial activity against all the test bacteria (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin-resistant s. aureus) except cyclo(l-leu-l-val). cyclo(l-leu-l-val) recorded activity only against gram positive bacteria. best antibacterial activity was recorded by cyclo(l-pro-l-trp) against s. aureus (4 mug/ml). the four compounds were active against all the five fungi tested (trichophyton rubrum, aspergillus flavus, candida albicans, candida tropicalis and cryptococcus neoformans) and the activity was compared with amphotericin b, the standard fungicide. the highest activity of 1 mug/ml by cyclo(l-pro-l-trp) was recorded against t. rubrum, a human pathogen responsible for causing athlete's foot, jock itch, and ringworm. the activity of cyclo(l-pro-l-trp) against t. rubrum, c. neoformans and c. albicans were better than amphotericin b, the standard antifungal agent. to our knowledge, this is the first report of antifungal activity of cdps against the human pathogenic fungi t. rubrum and c. neoformans. the four cdps are nontoxic to healthy human cell line up to 200 mug/ml. we conclude that the bacterium associated with entomopathogenic nematode is promising sources of natural antimicrobial secondary metabolites, which may receive greater benefit as potential sources of new drugs in the pharmaceutical industry.

TI  == a product of heme catabolism modulates bacterial function and survival.
AB  == bilirubin is the terminal metabolite in heme catabolism in mammals. after deposition into bile, bilirubin is released in large quantities into the mammalian gastrointestinal (gi) tract. we hypothesized that intestinal bilirubin  may modulate the function of enteric bacteria. to test this hypothesis, we investigated the effect of bilirubin on two enteric pathogens; enterohemorrhagic  e. coli (ehec), a gram-negative that causes life-threatening intestinal infections, and e. faecalis, a gram-positive human commensal bacterium known to be an opportunistic pathogen with broad-spectrum antibiotic resistance. we demonstrate that bilirubin can protect ehec from exogenous and host-generated reactive oxygen species (ros) through the absorption of free radicals. in contrast, e. faecalis was highly susceptible to bilirubin, which causes significant membrane disruption and uncoupling of respiratory metabolism in this  bacterium. interestingly, similar results were observed for other gram-positive bacteria, including b. cereus and s. aureus. a model is proposed whereby bilirubin places distinct selective pressure on enteric bacteria, with gram-negative bacteria being protected from ros (positive outcome) and gram-positive bacteria being susceptible to membrane disruption (negative outcome). this work suggests bilirubin has differential but biologically relevant effects on bacteria and justifies additional efforts to determine the role of this neglected waste catabolite in disease processes, including animal models.

TI  == enhanced antimicrobial activity of peptide-cocktails against common bacterial contaminants of ex vivo stored platelets.
AB  == bacterial contamination of blood components such as ex vivo-stored platelets is a major safety risk in transfusion medicine. we have recently shown that synthetic  antimicrobial peptides named pd1-pd4 derived from the thrombin-induced human platelet-derived antimicrobial proteins, and repeats of arg-trp (rw1-rw5) demonstrate microbicidal activity against selected bacteria and viruses. in the present study, we selected pd3, pd4, rw2, rw3 and rw4 and evaluated each individual peptide and their various combinations to see whether the cocktail regimen enhances the antimicrobial activity above and over the individual peptides. stored platelet or plasma samples spiked with known titres of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas  aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae and bacillus cereus were treated with either individual peptides or with peptides in various combinations. analyses revealed that individual peptides show moderate microbicidal activity (10- to 100-fold reduction) against the tested bacteria relative to their combined regimen. the peptide combinations (rw2 + rw4, rw2 + rw3 + rw4 and pd4 + rw3 + rw4) on the other hand enhanced the microbicidal activity (c.10 000-fold reduction) and revealed a minimal inhibitory concentration of 5 mum. time-kill kinetics indicated that these three peptide combinations exhibited enhanced antimicrobial  activity bringing about a 100-fold reduction of bacterial titres within 20 min of incubation. the present study therefore demonstrates the synergistic effect of antimicrobial peptides when used in combinations and provides a proof-of-concept  of its potential application as a molecular tool towards pathogen reduction and further extends the possibility of using peptide combinatorial therapeutics as broad-spectrum antibiotics or as alternatives to combat drug-resistant bacteria.

TI  == antimicrobial activity and phytochemical constituents of leaf extracts of cassia  auriculata.
AB  == plants produce a wide variety of phytochemical constituents, which are secondary  metabolites and are used either directly or indirectly in the pharmaceutical industry. 'for centuries, man has effectively used various components of plants or their extracts for the treatment of many diseases, including bacterial infections. in the present study methanol, chloroform and aqueous extracts of cassia auriculata leaf were subjected for antimicrobial activity by well-diffusion method against six bacterial strains namely bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and proteus mirabilis. the results revealed that the methanol and chloroform extracts exhibited strong inhibitory activity against all the tested organisms (zone of inhibition of 12-20 mm), except pseudomonas aeruginosa (zone of inhibition 10 mm or nil). the aqueous extracts showed moderate activity by 'zone of inhibition </=12 or nil). the extracts were screened for their phytochemical constituents by standard protocols' and were shown to contain carbohydrates, proteins, alkaloids, flavonoids, steroids, saponins and tannins. the antibacterial activity of these extracts is possibly linked to the presence of flavonoids, steroid, saponins and/or tannins. further studies are needed to determine the precise active principles from cassia auriculata.

TI  == growth-inhibitory activity of natural and synthetic isothiocyanates against representative human microbial pathogens.
AB  == aims: the aim of this study was to test the growth inhibition activity of isothiocyanates (itcs), defence compounds of plants, against common human microbial pathogens. methods and results: in this study, we have tested the growth-inhibitory activity of a diverse collection of new and previously known representative itcs of various structural classes against pathogenic bacteria, fungi and moulds by a serial dilution method. generally, the compounds were more  active against gram-positive bacteria and fungi exhibiting species-specific bacteriostatic or bactericidal effect. the most active compounds inhibited the growth of both drug-susceptible and multi-drug-resistant (mdr) pathogens at micromolar concentrations. in the case of mycobacterium tuberculosis, some compounds were more active against mdr, rather than against susceptible strains.  the average antimicrobial activity for some of the new derivatives was significantly higher than that previously reported for the most active itc compounds. the structure-activity relationship (sar) established for various classes of itc with bacillus cereus (model organism for b. anthracis) followed a  distinct pattern, thereby enabling prediction of new more efficient inhibitors. remarkably, tested bacteria failed to develop resistance to itc. while effectively inhibiting microbial growth, itcs displayed moderate toxicity towards eukaryotic cells. conclusions: high antimicrobial activity coupled with moderate  toxicity grants further thorough studies of the itc compounds aimed at elucidation of their cellular targets and inhibitory mechanism. significance and  impact of the study: this systematic study identified new itc compounds highly active against common human microbial pathogens at the concentrations comparable  with those for currently used antimicrobial drugs (e.g. rifampicin and fluconazole). tested representative pathogens do not develop resistance to the inhibitors. these properties justify further evaluation of itc compounds as potential antimicrobial agents for medicinal use and for industrial applications.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of schinus lentiscifolius (anacardiaceae).
AB  == ethnopharmacological relevance: schinus lentiscifolius marchand (syn. schinus weinmannifolius engl) is a plant native to rio grande do sul (southern brazil) and has been used in brazilian traditional medicine as antiseptic and antimicrobial for the treatment of many different health problems as well as to treat leucorrhea and to assist in ulcer and wound healing. although it is a plant widely used by the population, there are no studies proving this popular use. material and methods: the crude aqueous extract, the crude neutral methanol extract, fractions prepared from this extract (n-hexane, ethyl acetate, and n-butanol), pure compounds isolated from these fractions, and derivatives were investigated in vitro for antimicrobial activities against five gram positive bacteria: bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus saprophyticus, streptococcus pyogenes, three gram negative bacteria: escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and shigella sonnei, and four yeasts: candida albicans, candida tropicalis, cryptococcus neoformans, and saccharomyces cerevisiae. the isolated compound moronic acid, which is the most active, was tested against a range of other bacteria such as two gram positive bacteria, namely, bacillus cereus, enterococcus spp, and six gram negative bacteria, namely, burkholderia cepacia, providencia stuartii, morganella morganii, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, and proteus mirabilis. results: the leaf aqueous extract (decoction) of schinus lentiscifolius showed a  broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, ranging from 125 to 250 mug/ml (mic) against the tested bacteria and fungi. the n-hexane extract, despite being very little active against bacteria, showed an excellent antifungal activity, especially against candida albicans (mic=25 mug/ml), candida tropicalis (mic=15.5 mug/ml), and cryptococcus neoformans, (mic=15.5 mug/ml). from the acetate fraction (the most active against bacteria), compounds 1-6 were isolated: nonadecanol (1), moronic acid (2), gallic acid methyl ester (3), gallic acid (4), quercetin (5) and quercitrin (6). the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) of moronic acid between 1.5 and 3 mug/ml against most of the tested bacteria shows that it is one of the metabolites responsible for the antibacterial activity of schinus lentiscifolius. conclusion: the antimicrobial activity and some constituents of schinus lentiscifolius are reported for the first time. the results of the present study provide scientific basis for the popular use of schinus lentiscifolius for a number of different health problems.

TI  == two rep genes in small cryptic plasmid pkst21 of escherichia coli.
AB  == the complete nucleotide sequence of a small cryptic plasmid pkst21 from escherichia coli was determined. this plasmid is 1,460 bp long with an overall gc content of 51 %. based on sequence analysis, the presence of two segments with different average gc density was observed. the segment with higher gc content revealed 98-90 % similarity to several small plasmids of e. coli and to pcr1 from gram-positive corynebacterium renale. plasmid pkst21 possesses two conversely oriented open reading frames encoding proteins with a high degree of amino acid identity to rep proteins involved in replication. orf1 encodes replication protein similar to repa protein of bartonella tribocorum or bacillus cereus plasmids or to the putative plasmid rep protein from ecologically close selenomonas ruminantium. orf2 similarly encodes a replication protein, which shares 97 % homology with rep protein from c. renale. genetic diversity observed  in plasmid pkst21 indicates a mosaic structure of the plasmid with different segments acquired from different sources. deletion analysis showed that both fragments carrying the repa and repb genes are necessary for the replication of pkst21 in e. coli. the presence of plasmid with the same gene composition was revealed in 14 % of tested e. coli isolates from the rumen of sheep. all these strains produced identical eric-pcr profiles indicating isogenic origin of the strain and lack of horizontal gene transfer of pkst21 plasmid.

AB  == biopolymers and biopreservatives produced by microorganisms play an essential role in food technology. polyhydroxyalkanoates and bacteriocins produced by bacteria are promising components to safeguard the environment and for food preservation applications. polyhydroxybutyrate (phb)-based antimicrobial films were prepared incorporating eugenol, from 10 to 200 mug/g of phb. the films were  evaluated for antimicrobial activity against foodborne pathogens, spoilage bacteria, and fungi such as staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, bacillus cereus, aspergillus flavus, aspergillus niger, penicillium  sp., and rhizopus sp. the synergistic antimicrobial activity of the films in the  presence of crude pediocin was also investigated. the broth system containing pediocin (soluble form) as well as antimicrobial phb film demonstrated an extended lag phase and a significant growth reduction at the end of 24 h against  the bacteria. crude pediocin alone could not elicit antifungal activity, while inhibition of growth and sporulation were observed in the presence of antimicrobial phb film containing eugenol (80 mug/g) until 7 days in the case of  molds, i.e., a. niger, a. flavus, penicillium sp., and rhizopus sp. in potato dextrose broth. in the present study, we identified that use of pediocin containing broth in conjunction with eugenol incorporated phb film could function in synergized form, providing effective hurdle toward food contaminating microorganisms. furthermore, tensile strength, percent crystallinity, melting point, percent elongation to break, glass transition temperature, and seal strength of the phb film with and without eugenol incorporation were investigated. the migration of eugenol on exposure to different liquid food simulants was also analyzed using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. the study is expected to provide applications for pediocin in conjunction with eugenol containing phb film to enhance the shelf life of foods in the food industry.

TI  == a new family of proteins related to the heat-like repeat dna glycosylases with affinity for branched dna structures.
AB  == the recently discovered heat-like repeat (hlr) dna glycosylase superfamily is widely distributed in all domains of life. the present bioinformatics and phylogenetic analysis shows that hlr dna glycosylase superfamily members in the genus bacillus form three subfamilies: alkc, alkd and alkf/alkg. the crystal structure of alkf shows structural similarity with the dna glycosylases alkc and  alkd, however neither alkf nor alkg display any dna glycosylase activity. instead, both proteins have affinity to branched dna structures such as three-way and holliday junctions. a unique beta-hairpin in the alkf/alkg subfamily is most  likely inserted into the dna major groove, and could be a structural determinant  regulating dna substrate affinity. we conclude that alkf and alkg represent a new family of hlr proteins with affinity for branched dna structures.

TI  == identification of tet45, a tetracycline efflux pump, from a poultry-litter-exposed soil isolate and persistence of tet(45) in the soil.
AB  == objectives: to characterize a tetracycline resistance (tc(r)) determinant, closely related to the tetl efflux pump, in a bhargavaea cecembensis strain previously isolated from a poultry-litter-impacted soil. methods: genomic dna of  b. cecembensis dmv42a was shotgun cloned and expressed in escherichia coli. antimicrobial susceptibility testing and a [(3)h]tetracycline uptake assay were used to confirm the function of the target gene. transferability of the gene was  examined using filter matings and confirmed by pcr and sequencing. real-time quantitative pcr was performed on soil metagenomic dna to evaluate the prevalence of the gene in the soil from which b. cecembensis dmv42a was isolated and in more pristine local soils. results: the tc(r) determinant from b. cecembensis dmv42a,  designated tet45, was identified as a tetracycline efflux pump sharing 78% amino  acid identity with certain tetl proteins. in b. cecembensis dmv42a, tet(45) was adjacent to truncated and non-functional arsenic resistance genes with high sequence similarities to genes from staphylococcal plasmids. after filter matings, the tet(45) gene could be found in e. coli transconjugants, although the transfer mechanism was unknown. tet45 homologues are also present in the genomes  of several bacillus cereus strains and a bacillus thuringiensis strain. tet(45) was detected in the poultry-litter-impacted soil, and persisted at a similar level 2 years after removal of the chicken waste, although it was not detected in several more pristine soils. conclusions: tet45 is a tetracycline efflux pump closely related to tetl. horizontal gene transfer may have contributed to the dissemination and persistence of tet(45) in a poultry-litter-impacted soil.

TI  == evaluation of the haccp system in a university canteen: microbiological monitoring and internal auditing as verification tools.
AB  == food safety is essential in mass catering. in europe, regulation (ec) no. 852/2004 requires food business operators to put in place, implement and maintain permanent procedures based on hazard analysis and critical control point (haccp)  principles. each haccp plan is specifically implemented for the processing plant  and processing methods and requires a systematic collection of data on the incidence, elimination, prevention, and reduction of risks. in this five-year-study, the effectiveness of the haccp plan of a university canteen was  verified through periodic internal auditing and microbiological monitoring of meals, small equipment, cooking tools, working surfaces, as well as hands and white coats of the canteen staff. the data obtained revealed no safety risks for  the consumers, since escherichia coli, salmonella spp. and listeria monocytogenes were never detected; however, a quite discontinuous microbiological quality of meals was revealed. the fluctuations in the microbial loads of mesophilic aerobes, coliforms, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, and sulphite-reducing clostridia were mainly ascribed to inadequate handling or processing procedures,  thus suggesting the need for an enhancement of staff training activities and for  a reorganization of tasks. due to the wide variety of the fields covered by internal auditing, the full conformance to all the requirements was never achieved, though high scores, determined by assigning one point to each answer which matched with the requirements, were achieved in all the years.

TI  == biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles using actinobacterium streptomyces albogriseolus and its antibacterial activity.
AB  == an eco-friendly approach to the synthesis of silver nanoparticles (agnps) by extracellular components of streptomyces albogriseolus has been reported. the isolated actinobacteria were genotypically identified by 16s rrna sequencing analysis, and the morphology was observed by high-resolution scanning electron microscopy. the preliminary characterization of synthesized nanoparticles was carried out using ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometer. the maximum absorption spectra were found to be 409 nm at the 48th hour of incubation. the yield of agnps was found to be 72.64% as quantified by an atomic absorption spectrophotometer. the average size of agnps determined by the dynamic light scattering technique was 16.25 +/- 1.6 nm. the results from transmission electron microscopy and x-ray diffraction confirmed the formation of spherical shaped and  crystalline agnps. the interaction of protein with agnps was confirmed by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis. the biosynthesized agnps inhibited the  growth of food pathogens (bacillus cereus, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus). hence, the synthesis of agnps by s. albogriseolus could be employed as a probable antimicrobial agent to eliminate pathogenic microorganisms. this approach employed for the synthesis of nanoparticles paves a path for new biomaterial interfaces, which could be applied in different biomedical fields.

TI  == application of asian pumpkin (cucurbita ficifolia) serine proteinase for production of biologically active peptides from casein.
AB  == the main objective of this study was to determine potential application of a serine proteinase derived from asian pumpkin for obtaining biologically active peptides from casein. the course of casein hydrolysis by three doses of the enzyme (50, 150, 300 u/mg of protein) was monitored for 24 hours by the determinations of: hydrolysis degree dh (%), free amino group content (mumole gly/g), rp hplc peptide profiles and by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. in all hydrolyzates analyzed antioxidant activities were determined using three tests: the ability to reduce iron ions in frap test, the ability to scavenge free radicals in dpph test, and fe(2+) chelating activity. the antimicrobial activity  of obtained peptide fractions was determined as the ability to inhibit the growth of escherichia coli, bacillus cereus and pseudomonas fluorescens in a diffusion plate test. the deepest degradation, expressed as the dh [%] and the free amino group content (67% and 7528 micromole gly/mg, respectively), was noted in samples hydrolyzed with 300 u/ml of enzyme for 24 hours, while in other samples the determined values were about three and two times lower. the results were in agreement with the peptide profiles obtained by rp hplc. the highest antioxidative activities determined in all tests were seen for the casein hydrolysate obtained with 300 u/mg protein of serine proteinase after 24 h of reaction (2.15 microm trolox/mg, 96.15 microg fe(3+)/mg, 814.97 microg fe(2+)/mg). antimicrobial activity was presented in three preparations. in other  samples no antimicrobial activity was detected.

TI  == selection of dna aptamers for capture and detection of salmonella typhimurium using a whole-cell selex approach in conjunction with cell sorting.
AB  == alternative ligands such as nucleic acid aptamers can be used for pathogen capture and detection and offer advantages over antibodies, including reduced cost, ease of production and modification, and improved stability. dna aptamers demonstrating binding specificity to salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium were identified by whole-cell-systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (selex) beginning with a combinatorial library of biotin-labeled single stranded dna molecules. aptamer specificity was achieved using whole-cell  counter-selex against select non-salmonella genera. aptamers binding to salmonella were sorted, cloned, sequenced, and characterized for binding efficiency. out of 18 candidate aptamers screened, aptamer s8-7 showed relatively high binding affinity with an apparent dissociation constant (k d value) of 1.73  +/- 0.54 mum and was selected for further characterization. binding exclusivity analysis of s8-7 showed low apparent cross-reactivity with other foodborne bacteria including escherichia coli o157: h7 and citrobacter braakii and moderate cross-reactivity with bacillus cereus. aptamer s8-7 was successfully used as a ligand for magnetic capture of serially diluted salmonella typhimurium cells, followed by downstream detection using qpcr. the lower limit of detection of the  aptamer magnetic capture-qpcr assay was 10(2)-10(3) cfu equivalents of salmonella typhimurium in a 290-mul sample volume. mean capture efficiency ranged from 3.6 to 12.6 %. unique aspects of the study included (a) the use of selex targeting whole cells; (b) the application of flow cytometry for aptamer pool selection, thereby favoring purification of ligands with both high binding affinity and targeting abundant cell surface moieties; and (c) the use of pre-labeled primers  that circumvented the need for post-selection ligand labeling. taken together, this study provides proof-of-concept that biotinylated aptamers selected by whole-cell selex can be used in a qpcr-based capture-detection platform for salmonella typhimurium.

AB  == we introduce a nanoporous membrane based impedimetric immunosensor for the label-free detection of bacterial pathogens in whole milk. a simple and rapid method to modify a commercially available alumina nanoporous membrane with hyaluronic acid (ha) effectively reduced the non-specific binding of biomolecules and other cells, and permitted successful immobilization of antibodies. escherichia coli o157:h7, one of the most harmful food-borne pathogenic bacteria, was tested as a model pathogen in this study. the ionic impedance of electrolytes through nanopores, due to antibody-pathogen interactions, was monitored by impedance spectra and analyzed by normalized impedance change (nic). the regression equation for the nic at 1 khz versus concentration of e. coli o157:h7  (10-10(5)cfu/ml) was obtained, and the detection limit found to be as low as 10 cfu/ml. in addition, the proposed immunosensor was successfully used for the detection of e. coli o157:h7 in whole milk samples with the detection limit as low as 83.7 cfu/ml with 95% probability. the specificity of the immunosensor was  also demonstrated using non-target bacteria, including staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, and non pathogenic e. coli dh5alpha. this study shows that a ha-functionalized nanoporous membrane-based impedimetric sensor is capable of detecting pathogenic bacteria in whole milk without any pretreatment. this is a significant step for evaluating the safety of food and environmental samples and  other medical diagnostics.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of a new preservative for multiuse ophthalmic solutions.
AB  == purpose: the aim of this study was to examine the antimicrobial activity and the  preservative efficacy of a novel preservative solution containing sodium hydroxymethyl glycinate (shmg) and edetate disodium (edta), which is used for preservation of some commercial ophthalmic formulations. methods: in vitro susceptibility assays were performed against several gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and bacillus cereus) and gram-negative (escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa) bacteria representative of the microbial flora of epithelial surfaces or colonizing the conjunctiva, as well as against candida albicans and aspergillus niger. using different concentrations of shmg alone or in combination with edta, the minimal inhibitory and microbicidal concentrations against these organisms were assessed. in addition, 8 brands of multidose eye drops containing 0.002% shmg and 0.1% edta as preservative were tested for antimicrobial activity using the antimicrobial effectiveness test recommended by the international pharmacopoeias. results: the  minimal inhibitory and bactericidal/fungicidal concentration values of shmg ranged from 0.0025% to 0.0125% for bacteria and from 0.125% to 0.50% for mold and yeast. susceptibility testing demonstrated that the addition of edta substantially increased the shmg activity against all bacterial and fungal strains. the preservative effectiveness test was applied to commercial eye drops. all the drop solutions met the criteria reported by the u.s. pharmacopeia for parenteral and ophthalmic preparations. all products also satisfied the major acceptance criteria of the european pharmacopeia with respect to the antifungal activity. with regard to the antibacterial activity, the less-stringent criteria  of the european pharmacopeia were fulfilled. conclusions: the present study demonstrates the efficacy of a novel preservative for ophthalmic solutions (shmg/edta) and its activity in protecting selected commercial artificial tears against microbial contamination.

TI  == copper(ii) triflate promoted multicomponent catalytic clubbing of piperazinyl-thiazoloquinolines and thiazolocoumarins as antimicrobials.
AB  == step economical, multicomponent construction of two series based on quinoline and coumarin ring systems was carried out. annulation towards the 2-piperazinylthiazole system was established in satisfactory yields, using copper(ii) triflate. these multicomponent reaction products were examined for their potential inhibitory effect against two gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus and bacillus cereus), three gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and klebsiella pneumoniae) and two fungal species (aspergillus niger and candida albicans). in vitro pharmacological screening data demonstrated that the majority of the compounds were found to possess a significant broad-spectrum antimicrobial (25-50 microg/ml of mic) potential and the results were comparable to control drugs. the structural assignments of final products were done on the basis of ir, 1h nmr, 13c nmr spectroscopy, and elemental analysis. the structure-activity relationship (sar) was explored to facilitate further development of this class of compounds.

TI  == characterization of an atmospheric pressure plasma jet and its applications for disinfection and cancer treatment.
AB  == in this work an atmospheric pressure non-thermal resistive barrier (rb) plasma jet was constructed, characterized and was applied for biomedical applications. the rb plasma source can operate in both dc (battery) as well as in standard 60/50 hz low frequency ac excitation, and it functions effectively in both direct and indirect plasma exposure configurations. the characteristics of the rb plasma jet such as electrical properties, plasma gas temperature and nitric oxides concentration were determined using voltage-current characterization, optical emission spectroscopy and gas analyzer diagnostic techniques. plasma discharge power of 26.33 w was calculated from voltage-current characterization. an optical emission spectroscopy was applied and the gas temperature which is equivalent to  the nitrogen rotational (t<inf>rot</inf>) temperatures was measured. the concentrations of the reactive oxygen species at different spatial distances from the tip of the plasma jet were measured and the ppm concentration of no is at the preferred level for a wide range of standard biomedical treatment applications. the ppm values of nitric oxides after the cooling unit are observed to be of the  same order of magnitude as compared to plasma jet. the portable rb plasma source  was tested to be very effective for decontamination and disinfection of a wide range of foodborne and opportunistic nosocomial pathogens such as escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and bacillus cereus and the preliminary results are presented. the effects of indirect exposure of the portable rbp source on monocytic leukemia cancer cells (thp-1) were also tested and the results demonstrate that a preference for apoptosis in plasma treated thp-1 cells under particular plasma parameters and dosage levels.

TI  == pathogenic bacteria in finnish bulk tank milk.
AB  == while the quality of raw cow milk in finland is known for its high hygienic standard, with the national average total bacterial count being below 10(4) cfu/ml annually, the prevalence of pathogenic bacteria in finnish raw milk is underreported. the aim of this study was to determine the occurrence of listeria  monocytogenes, thermophilic campylobacter spp., salmonella spp., stx-positive escherichia coli (stec), coagulase-positive staphylococci, yersinia spp., and bacillus cereus group in raw cow milk samples collected from bulk tanks at 183 finnish farms. additionally, the hygienic quality of the milk was studied by determining the total bacterial and e. coli counts. l. monocytogenes was detected in 5.5% of the milk samples, with concentrations varying from <1 to 30 cfu/ml. thermophilic campylobacter spp. or salmonella spp. were not detected in any of the samples. stec with shiga toxin-encoding stx2 was detected in 2.7% of the samples. yersinia enterocolitica was detected in 7.7% of the samples; however, all isolates were negative for ail, suggesting that they were non-pathogenic. coagulase-positive staphylococci were detected in 34.4% of the samples, with an average concentration of 25 cfu/ml in the positive samples. members of the b. cereus group were detected in 20.8% of the samples, with an average concentration of 1 cfu/ml in the positive samples. no relationship was detected between e. coli or the total bacterial count and the presence of pathogenic bacteria, which suggests that pathogens can be present also in farms with excellent production hygiene. although the concentration of pathogenic bacteria in fresh raw milk was  mainly relatively low, it should be borne in mind that some of the pathogenic bacteria can survive and multiply at refrigeration temperatures and may cause a disease with a very low infectious dose. thus, consumption of raw milk and related products poses a potential risk for food poisoning.

TI  == biofilm inhibitors that target amyloid proteins.
AB  == bacteria establish stable communities, known as biofilms, that are resistant to antimicrobials. biofilm robustness is due to the presence of an extracellular matrix, which for several species-among them bacillus subtilis-includes amyloid-like protein fibers. in this work, we show that b. subtilis biofilms can  be a simple and reliable tool for screening of molecules with antiamyloid activity. we identified two molecules, aa-861 and parthenolide, which efficiently inhibited biofilms by preventing the formation of amyloid-like fibers. parthenolide also disrupted pre-established biofilms. these molecules also impeded the formation of biofilms of other bacterial species that secrete amyloid proteins, such as bacillus cereus and escherichia coli. furthermore, the identified molecules decreased the conversion of the yeast protein new1 to the prion state in a heterologous host, indicating the broad range of activity of the molecules.

TI  == inhibitory effect of cinnamon powder on pathogen growth in laboratory media and oriental-style rice cakes (sulgidduk).
AB  == there has been an increasing interest in the use of natural plant materials as alternative food preservatives. we examined the antimicrobial effects of natural  plant materials used as additives against foodborne pathogens in laboratory media and sulgidduk, oriental-style rice cakes. cinnamon, mugwort, and garlic powder solutions (3%) were tested for their antimicrobial activities against pathogens in laboratory media. sulgidduk prepared with different amounts of cinnamon powder (1, 3, and 6%) was inoculated with a staphylococcus aureus or bacillus cereus cocktail. the samples were air or vacuum packaged and stored at 22 +/- 1 degrees  c for 72 h, and microbial growth was determined. cinnamon powder showed more inhibitory properties against pathogens such as salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, escherichia coli o157:h7, listeria monocytogenes, s. aureus, and b.  cereus than did mugwort or garlic powder. the populations of s. aureus and b. cereus in sulgidduk containing cinnamon powder were significantly lower than in the control during storage time. different packaging methods did not result in a  significant difference in pathogen growth. in a sensory evaluation, sulgidduk containing 1 and 3% cinnamon powder did not significantly differ from the control sample in any of the attributes tested other than flavor. these results indicate  that natural plant materials such as cinnamon powder could be used as food additives to improve the microbiological stability of rice cakes.

TI  == inactivation of foodborne pathogens in ground beef by cooking with highly controlled radio frequency energy.
AB  == the consumer demand for fresh tasting, high quality, low salt, preservative-free  meals which require minimal preparation time magnifies the safety concern and emphasizes the need to use innovative technologies for food processing. a modern  technique to uniformly heat and cook foods is based on a combination of convection and controlled radio frequency (rf) energy. however any advantage conferred on meat cooked by this method would be lost if application of the technology results in decreased safety. our main goal was to study the inactivation efficacy of this method of cooking against pathogens in ground meat  in comparison to standard convection cooking. meat balls were artificially inoculated with gfp expressing escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium and listeria monocytogenes as well as spores of bacillus cereus and bacillus thuringiensis and cooked by convection heating (220 degrees c, 40 min), by using  energy generated from frequencies in the rf bandwidth (rf cooking, 7.5 min) or by combined heating (5.5 min), until the center temperature of each sample reached 73 degrees c. the mean reductions in total indigenous bacteria obtained by rf and convection were 2.8 and 2.5 log cfu/g, respectively. cooking of meat balls with convection reduced the e. coli population (8 log cfu/g) by 5.5 log cfu/g, whilst  treatment with rf reduced e. coli population to undetectable levels. the mean reductions of s. typhimurium obtained by rf and convection were 5.7 and 6.5 log cfu/g, respectively. the combined treatment reduced the salmonella population to  undetectable levels. in contrast, l. monocytogenes was poorly affected by rf cooking. the mean reduction of l. monocytogenes obtained by rf energy was 0.4 log cfu/g, while convection cooking resulted in undetectable levels. interestingly, the combined treatment also resulted with undetectable levels of listeria although time of cooking was reduced by 86%. one-step cooking had negligible effects on the bacillus spores and therefore a 2-step treatment of rf or convection was applied. this 2-step treatment proved to be efficient with 4.5 log cfu/g reduction for both rf and convection. in conclusion, here we show that combination of rf with convection cooking resulted in similar or even better effects on selected foodborne pathogens compared to convection only, while the time required for safe cooking is cut down by up to 86%. the equal or better results in the levels of all investigated pathogens using rf with convection compared with convection only suggest that this technology looks promising and safe for ground beef cooking.

TI  == heterologous expression of cyp102a5 variant from bacillus cereus cyppb-1: validation of model for predicting drug metabolism of human p450 probe substrates.
AB  == cyp102a5 variant (adl27534) from isolated bacillus cereus cyppb-1 was heterologously expressed in escherichia coli top 10 cells. comparative sequence analysis of purified cyp102a5 variant with respect to reported cyp102a5 (aap10153) from bacillus cereus atcc 14579 revealed amino acid sequence changes at positions p245s and m318i of heme domain. the binding affinities of 15 selected human p450 probe substrates towards isolated cyp102a5 were analyzed in silico using a homology model together with molecular docking techniques to predict the human drug metabolism. in vitro analysis suggested that the purified  cyp102a5 metabolizes typical substrates of human cyp2c9, cyp2d6, cyp2e1, and cyp3a4, such as coumarin, propranolol, aniline, chlorzoxazone, p-nitrophenol, and nifedipine. the calculated k m values for propranolol, chloroxazone, coumarin, aniline, and 4-nitrophenol were calculated to be 0.962 +/- 0.041, 1.254 +/- 0.057, 2.859 +/- 0.083, 2.732 +/- 0.106, and 2.528 +/- 0.11 mm, respectively. importantly, taking a chemscore cutoff value of -31 kj/mol, substrate binding at  active site and in vitro activity as the distinguishing lines between "substrates" and "nonsubstrates" revealed one false-positive and one false-negative results out of the 15 compounds examined. this is the first report on validation of cyp102a family homology model for in silico prediction of human  drug metabolism.

TI  == changes in microbial contamination levels of porcine carcasses and fresh pork in  slaughterhouses, processing lines, retail outlets, and local markets by commercial distribution.
AB  == the objective of this study was to evaluate the changes in microbial contamination levels of each porcine carcass and fresh pork in a general distribution process. a total of 100 commercial pigs were sampled (six sampling sites per individual, total 600 samples) at four sequential stages: slaughterhouse (after carcass grading and boning), processing line, retail outlet, and local market. no significant differences were observed in the contaminant percentages among sampling sites and sample collection years (p>0.05) with the exception of bacillus cereus. the contaminant percentage of b. cereus at 1st collection year was higher than these of 2nd collection year (28.31% vs. 12.26%, p<0.05). b. cereus and listeria monocytogenes were the most frequently detected pathogenic bacteria in the slaughterhouse and markets, respectively. on  the other hand, escherichia coli o157:h7 and yersinia enterocolitica were not detected in carcasses or pork collected from any carcass sites and pork samples.  however, the frequency of pathogenic bacteria in end-products at local markets was not highly related to the initial contamination of porcine carcasses in the slaughterhouse. thus, the improvement of microbial safety for pork end-products requires hygienic control of porcine carcasses and meat cutting during all operations in the slaughterhouse, processing line, retail outlet, and local market.

TI  == dna extract characterization process for microbial detection methods development  and validation.
AB  == background: quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qpcr) assays used in pathogen detection require rigorous methods development including characterizing dna extraction products. a dna extract characterization process is demonstrated using dna extracted from five different cells types (two gram-negatives: escherichia coli, and burkholderia thailandensis, spores and vegetative cells from the gram-positive bacillus cereus, and yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae) with six different methods. results: dna extract quantity (concentration and extraction efficiency) and quality (purity and intactness) varied by cell type and extraction method enabling the demonstration of different dna characterization methods. dna purity was measured using uv spectroscopy, where the a260/a280 and a260/a230 ratios are indicators of different contaminants. reproducibility of uv  spectroscopy measurements decreased for dna concentrations less than 17.5 ng/mul. forty-seven extracts had concentrations greater than 17.5 ng/mul, 25 had a260/a280 above 2.0, and 28 had a260/a230 ratios below 1.8 indicating rna and polysaccharide contamination respectively. based on a qpcr inhibition assay the contaminants did not inhibit pcr. extract intactness was evaluated using microfluidic gel electrophoresis. thirty-five samples had concentrations above the limit of quantification (loq, roughly 11 ng/ mul), 93.5% of the dna was larger than 1kb and 1% was smaller than 300 bp. extract concentrations ranged from 1502.2 ng/mul to below the loq when uv spectroscopy, fluorometry, and qpcr were used. loq for uv spectroscopic and fluorometric measurements were 3.5 ng/mul and 0.25 ng/mul respectively. the qpcr loq varied by cell type (5.72 x 10-3 ng/mul for e. coli, 2.66 x 10-3 ng/mul, for b. cereus, 3.78 x 10-3 ng/mul for b.  thailandensis, and 7.67 x 10-4 ng/mul for s. cerevisiae). a number of samples were below the uv spectroscopy (n = 27), flurometry (n = 15), and qpcr (n = 3) loq. conclusion: the presented dna extract characterization process provides measures of dna quantity and quality applicable to microbial detection methods development and validation studies. evaluating dna quality and quantity results in a better understanding of process lod and contributing factors to suboptimal assay performance. the samples used demonstrated the use of different dna characterization methods presented but did not encompass the full range of dna extract characteristics.

TI  == changes in microbial contamination levels and prevalence of foodborne pathogens in alfalfa (medicago sativa) and rapeseed (brassica napus) during sprout production in manufacturing plants.
AB  == samples were taken from three sprout processing plants at five different stages of production (a total of 20 investigations). quantitative analyses comprised aerobic plate counts (apcs) and the measurement of coliforms and bacillus cereus  levels, whereas qualitative analyses involved assessing the levels of escherichia coli and major foodborne pathogens (e. coli o157:h7, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella spp., and staphylococcus aureus). the apc for alfalfa seeds (3.71-4.61 log cfu g(-1)) and rapeseed (4.25-5.11 log cfu g(-1)) increased by approximately  3 log cfu g(-1) during sprouting, reaching 7.17-7.61 and 7.33-8.28 log cfu g(-1), respectively, by the final stage of production. similarly, increasing trends were noted in the level of coliforms (0.58-4.03 log cfu g(-1) at the seed stage, increasing to 5.52-6.99 log cfu g(-1) by the sprout stage). bacillus cereus was detected in eight alfalfa (40%) and 14 rapeseed (70%) sprouts, and l. monocytogenes was isolated from one pregermination soaked alfalfa seed. a slight  reduction in the level of bacterial contamination was noted after washing the sprouts with water prior to storage, indicating that improvements to the current  washing protocol, or other efficient intervention methods, may be needed. taken together, these results suggest that improved hygiene control during production and processing and a more sanitary environment are needed. the present study provides comprehensive information regarding the microbiological safety of seeds  and sprouts during manufacturing. significance and impact of study: the present study investigated the levels of microbial contamination present in alfalfa and rapeseed sprouts by examining the samples taken at different stages of the manufacturing process in three actual plants. the results provide detailed information regarding the levels of seed and sprout contamination during production. the results may be useful to those involved in the sprout industry and/or academic research in terms of developing hygienic control measures, efficient intervention methods and appropriate guidelines.

TI  == antimicrobial activity and composition profile of grape (vitis vinifera) pomace extracts obtained by supercritical fluids.
AB  == the possibility of increasing the aggregated value of the huge amount of residues generated by wineries around the world foment studies using the grape pomace - the residue from the wine production, composed by seed, skin and stems - to obtain functional ingredients. nowadays, consumers in general prefer natural and  safe products mainly for food and cosmetic fields, where the supercritical fluid  extraction is of great importance due to the purity of the extracts provided. therefore, the objective of this work is to evaluate the global extraction yield, the antimicrobial activity and the composition profile of merlot and syrah grape  pomace extracts obtained by supercritical co2 (sc-co2) and co2 added with co-solvent at pressures up to 300 bar and temperatures of 50 and 60 degrees c. the results were compared with the ones obtained by soxhlet and by ultrasound-assisted leaching extraction methods. the main components from the extracts, identified by hplc, were gallic acid, p-oh-benzoic acid, vanillic acid  and epicatechin. the antibacterial and antifungal activities of the extracts were evaluated using four strains of bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa) and three fungi strains (candida albicans, candida parapsilosis, candida krusei). despite lower extraction yield results, the supercritical fluid extracts presented the highest antimicrobial effectiveness compared to the other grape pomace extracts due to the presence of  antimicrobial active compounds. syrah extracts were less efficient against the microorganisms tested and merlot extracts were more active against gram-positive  bacteria.

TI  == a mimicking-of-dna-methylation-patterns pipeline for overcoming the restriction barrier of bacteria.
AB  == genetic transformation of bacteria harboring multiple restriction-modification (r-m) systems is often difficult using conventional methods. here, we describe a  mimicking-of-dna-methylation-patterns (modmp) pipeline to address this problem in three difficult-to-transform bacterial strains. twenty-four putative dna methyltransferases (mtases) from these difficult-to-transform strains were cloned and expressed in an escherichia coli strain lacking all of the known r-m systems  and orphan mtases. thirteen of these mtases exhibited dna modification activity in southwestern dot blot or liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (lc-ms) assays. the active mtase genes were assembled into three operons using the saccharomyces cerevisiae dna assembler and were co-expressed in the e. coli strain lacking known r-m systems and orphan mtases. thereafter, results from the  dot blot and restriction enzyme digestion assays indicated that the dna methylation patterns of the difficult-to-transform strains are mimicked in these  e. coli hosts. the transformation of the gram-positive bacillus amyloliquefaciens ta208 and b. cereus atcc 10987 strains with the shuttle plasmids prepared from modmp hosts showed increased efficiencies (up to four orders of magnitude) compared to those using the plasmids prepared from the e. coli strain lacking known r-m systems and orphan mtases or its parental strain. additionally, the gene coding for uracil phosphoribosyltransferase (upp) was directly inactivated using non-replicative plasmids prepared from the modmp host in b. amyloliquefaciens ta208. moreover, the gram-negative chemoautotrophic nitrobacter hamburgensis strain x14 was transformed and expressed green fluorescent protein (gfp). finally, the sequence specificities of active mtases were identified by restriction enzyme digestion, making the modmp system potentially useful for other strains. the effectiveness of the modmp pipeline in different bacterial groups suggests a universal potential. this pipeline could facilitate the functional genomics of the strains that are difficult to transform.

TI  == bacillus cereus iron uptake protein fishes out an unstable ferric citrate trimer.
AB  == citrate is a common biomolecule that chelates fe(iii). many bacteria and plants use ferric citrate to fulfill their nutritional requirement for iron. only the escherichia coli ferric citrate outer-membrane transport protein feca has been characterized; little is known about other ferric citrate-binding proteins. here  we report a unique siderophore-binding protein from the gram-positive pathogenic  bacterium bacillus cereus that binds multinuclear ferric citrate complexes. we have demonstrated that b. cereus atcc 14579 takes up (55)fe radiolabeled ferric citrate and that a protein, bc_3466 [renamed fctc (ferric citrate-binding protein c)], binds ferric citrate. the dissociation constant (k(d)) of fctc at ph 7.4 with ferric citrate (molar ratio 1:50) is 2.6 nm. this is the tightest binding observed of any b. cereus siderophore-binding protein. nano electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (nano esi-ms) analysis of fctc and ferric citrate complexes or citrate alone show that fctc binds diferric di-citrate, and triferric tricitrate, but does not bind ferric di-citrate, ferric monocitrate, or citrate alone. significantly, the protein selectively binds triferric tricitrate  even though this species is naturally present at very low equilibrium concentrations.

TI  == a piscidin-like antimicrobial peptide from the icefish chionodraco hamatus (perciformes: channichthyidae): molecular characterization, localization and bactericidal activity.
AB  == antimicrobial peptides (amps) are considered one of the most ancient components of the innate immune system. they are able to exert their protection activity against a variety of microorganisms, and are widely distributed in both vertebrates and invertebrates. in this paper we focused on an amp identified in the antarctic teleost chionodraco hamatus, an icefish species. the cdna sequence  of the amp, named chionodracine, is comprised of 515 bp and translates for a putative protein precursor of 80 amino acids, with a signal peptide of 22 amino acids. the structural features evidenced in the primary sequence of chionodracine lead to the inclusion of the peptide in the antimicrobial family of piscidins. the analysis by real-time pcr of the basal gene transcripts of chionodracine in different icefish tissues showed that the highest expression was found in gills,  followed by head kidney. the chionodracine expression levels in head kidney leukocytes were up-regulated in vitro both by lps and poly i:c, and in vivo by lps. a putative chionodracine mature peptide was synthesized and employed to obtain a polyclonal antiserum, which was used in immunohistochemistry of gills sections and revealed a significant positivity associated with mast cells. the bactericidal activity of the peptide was investigated and found significant against antarctic psychrophilic bacteria strains (psychrobacter sp. tad1 and ta144), the gram-positive bacillus cereus, and at a lesser extent against the gram-negative escherichia coli. interestingly, the haemolytic activity of chionodracine was tested in vitro on human erythrocytes and no significant lysis  occurred until peptide concentration of 50 mum.

TI  == comparison of sample preparation methods for the recovery of foodborne pathogens  from fresh produce.
AB  == sample preparation methods (pummeling, pulsifying, sonication, and shaking by hand) were compared for achieving maximum recovery of foodborne pathogens from iceberg lettuce, perilla leaves, cucumber, green pepper, and cherry tomato. antimicrobial and dehydration effects also were examined to investigate causes of poor recovery of pathogens. each produce type was inoculated with escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella typhimurium, listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, and bacillus cereus at 6.0 log cfu/cm(2), and samples were prepared using the four methods. bacterial populations recovered from the five types of produce  were significantly different (p < 0.05) according to sample preparation methods and produce type. the bacterial populations recovered from pummeled and pulsified samples were higher (p < 0.05) than those recovered from sonicated and hand-shaken samples, except for cherry tomato. the number of bacteria recovered from produce was reduced (p < 0.05) from that of the inoculum by 0.16 to 2.69 log cfu/cm(2). although extracts of iceberg lettuce, perilla leaves, cucumber, and green pepper had no antimicrobial activity, the populations of e. coli o157:h7, salmonella typhimurium, b. cereus, and l. monocytogenes in cherry tomato extract  were slightly reduced after these treatments (p < 0.05). the pathogen populations on perilla leaves and cherry tomatoes decreased by >2 log cfu/cm(2) after exposure to 40% relative humidity for 1 h. no reduction was observed when the five pathogens were exposed to 90% relative humidity. these data suggest that pummeling and pulsifying are optimal sample preparation methods for detection of  microorganisms. acidic produce such as cherry tomato should be treated with a method that does not cause sample breakdown so that acid stress on the bacteria can be minimized. dehydration stress also affects recovery of pathogens from produce.

TI  == the bioc o-methyltransferase catalyzes methyl esterification of malonyl-acyl carrier protein, an essential step in biotin synthesis.

(2010) nat. chem. biol. 6, 682-688). bioc was believed to be an o-methyltransferase that methylated the free carboxyl of either malonyl-coa or malonyl-acyl carrier protein based on the ability of o-methylated (but not unmethylated) precursors to bypass the bioc requirement for biotin synthesis both in vivo and in vitro. however, only indirect proof of the hypothesized enzymatic  activity was obtained because the activities of the available bioc preparations were too low for direct enzymatic assay. because e. coli bioc protein was extremely recalcitrant to purification in an active form, bioc homologues of other bacteria were tested. we report that the native form of bacillus cereus atcc10987 bioc functionally replaced e. coli bioc in vivo, and the protein could  be expressed in soluble form and purified to homogeneity. in disagreement with prior scenarios that favored malonyl-coa as the methyl acceptor, malonyl-acyl carrier protein was a far better acceptor of methyl groups from s-adenosyl-l-methionine than was malonyl-coa. bioc was specific for the malonyl moiety and was inhibited by s-adenosyl-l-homocysteine and sinefungin. high level  expression of b. cereus bioc in e. coli blocked cell growth and fatty acid synthesis.

AB  == the aim of this study was to monitor the antibacterial effect of seven phosphate  salts on selected strains of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, which could be considered responsible for food-borne diseases (bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, enterococcus faecalis, micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus, citrobacter freundii, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, salmonella enterica ser. enteritidis and pseudomonas aeruginosa). for these purposes, phosphates differing in chain length were used. the tested concentrations were in the range of 0.1-2.0% (wt v(-1)) applied at the model conditions. in the majority of cases the visible inhibitory effect on the growth of observed microorganisms could be seen. due to the chemical structure of salts and their dissociation both the ph values of cultivation broth and similarly the growth characteristics of bacterial strains were affected. the inhibition of above mentioned bacteria was apparently supported by this dissociation. phosphates obviously made the development of most gram-positive bacteria impossible. especially micrococcus luteus was extremely sensitive to the presence of these substances. on the other  hand, gram-negative bacteria seemed to be resistant to the phosphate incidence. the exemption clause from the tested salts was represented by a high alkaline trisodium phosphate. it should be pointed out that generally the most significant antibacterial effects were shown by polyphosphates hexa68 and hexa70, trisodium phosphate undecahydrate, tetrasodium pyrophosphate and finally trisodium phosphate. by comparing the inhibitory effects of various phosphate salts can be  concluded that the antibacterial activity was not determined only by the condensation degree but there was also proved the dependence on ph values.

TI  == exposure to anacardiaceae volatile oils and their constituents induces lipid peroxidation within food-borne bacteria cells.
AB  == the chemical composition of the volatile oils from five anacardiaceae species and their activities against gram positive and negative bacteria were assessed. the peroxidative damage within bacterial cell membranes was determined through the breakdown product malondialdehyde (mda). the major constituents in anacardium humile leaves oil were (e)-caryophyllene (31.0%) and alpha-pinene (22.0%), and in anacardium occidentale oil they were (e)-caryophyllene (15.4%) and germacrene-d (11.5%). volatile oil from astronium fraxinifolium leaves were dominated by (e)-beta-ocimene (44.1%) and alpha-terpinolene (15.2%), whilst the oil from myracrodruon urundeuva contained an abundance of delta-3-carene (78.8%). however, schinus terebinthifolius leaves oil collected in march and july presented different chemical compositions. the oils from all species, except the one from a. occidentale, exhibited varying levels of antibacterial activity against staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus and escherichia coli. oil extracted in july from s. terebinthifolius was more active against all bacterial strains than  the corresponding oil extracted in march. the high antibacterial activity of the  m. urundeuva oil could be ascribed to its high delta-3-carene content. the amounts of mda generated within bacterial cells indicate that the volatile oils induce lipid peroxidation. the results suggest that one putative mechanism of antibacterial action of these volatile oils is pro-oxidant damage within bacterial cell membrane explaining in part their preservative properties.

TI  == preparation, stability and antimicrobial activity of cationic cross-linked starch-iodine complexes.
AB  == cationic cross-linked starch (ccs)-iodine complexes containing different amounts  of quaternary ammonium groups (different degrees of substitution (ds)) and iodine have been obtained by iodine adsorption on ccs from aqueous iodine potassium iodide solution. equilibrium adsorption studies showed that with an increase of ds the amount of iodine adsorbed on ccs and the affinity of iodine to ccs increased linearly. the influences of the ds of ccs and the amount of adsorbed iodine on the stability of ccs-iodine complexes in a solution of 0.02m sodium acetate and reactivity toward l-tyrosine have been investigated. at the same ds,  the stability of ccs-iodine complexes decreased with an increase of the amount of adsorbed iodine. with increasing the ds, the stability of ccs-iodine complexes increased. the iodine consumption in the reaction with l-tyrosine increased significantly with an increase of the amount of adsorbed iodine. the influence of ds on iodine consumption was lower and depended on the amount of adsorbed iodine. the antibacterial activity of ccs-iodine complexes against bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli was determined by the broth-dilution and spread-plate methods. the obtained results have demonstrated that an appropriate selection of the ccs-iodine complex composition  (the ds of ccs and the amount of adsorbed iodine) could ensure good antimicrobial properties by keeping a low concentration of free iodine in the system. the main  advantage of using ccs-iodine complexes as antimicrobial agents is the biodegradability of the polymeric matrix.

AB  == a nationwide survey was conducted to obtain qualitative and quantitative data on  bacterial contamination of raw commingled silo milk intended for pasteurization.  the levels of total aerobic bacteria, total coliforms, enterobacteriaceae, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus were determined using the tempo system. the prevalence rates and levels of presumptive bacillus cereus, e. coli o157:h7, listeria monocytogenes, and salmonella spp. were determined in 214 samples. b. cereus was detected in 8.91% of samples, at 3.0 to 93 cfu/ml. e. coli o157:h7 was detected in 3.79 to 9.05% of samples, at <0.0055 to 1.1 cfu/ml, depending on the assay utilized. salmonella spp. were recovered from 21.96 to 57.94% of samples, at <0.0055 to 60 cfu/ml. l. monocytogenes was detected in 50.00% of samples, at <0.0055 to 30 cfu/ml. the average log-transformed counts of total viable bacteria were slightly lower in samples containing no pathogens. no  correlation was observed between the levels of organisms detected with the tempo  system and the presence or levels of any pathogen except e. coli o157:h7. a higher average log-transformed count of total viable bacteria was observed in samples positive for this organism. the high prevalence rates of target pathogens may be attributed to a variety of factors, including detection methods, sample size, and commingling of the milk in the silo. the effects of commingling likely  contributed to the high prevalence rates and low levels of target pathogens because of the inclusion of milk from multiple bulk tanks. the high prevalence rates also may be the result of analysis of larger sample volumes using more sensitive detection methods. these quantitative data could be utilized to perform more accurate risk assessments and to better estimate the appropriate level of protection for dairy products and processing technologies.

TI  == gegenees: fragmented alignment of multiple genomes for determining phylogenomic distances and genetic signatures unique for specified target groups.
AB  == the rapid development of next generation sequencing technologies leads to the accumulation of huge amounts of sequencing data. the scientific community faces an enormous challenge in how to deal with this explosion. here we present a software tool, 'gegenees', that uses a fragmented alignment approach to facilitate the comparative analysis of hundreds of microbial genomes. the genomes are fragmented and compared, all against all, by a multithreaded blast control engine. ready-made alignments can be complemented with new genomes without recalculating the existing data points. gegenees gives a phylogenomic overview of the genomes and the alignment can then be mined for genomic regions with conservation patterns matching a defined target group and absent from a background group. the genomic regions are given biomarker scores forming a uniqueness signature that can be viewed and explored, graphically and in tabular  form. a primer/probe alignment tool is also included for specificity verification of currently used or new primers. we exemplify the use of gegenees on the bacillus cereus group, on foot and mouth disease viruses, and on strains from the 2011 escherichia coli o104:h4 outbreak. gegenees contributes towards an increased capacity of fast and efficient data mining as more and more genomes become sequenced.

AB  == environmental sampling for microbiological contaminants is a key component of hygiene monitoring and risk characterization practices utilized across diverse fields of application. however, confidence in surface sampling results, both in the field and in controlled laboratory studies, has been undermined by large variation in sampling performance results. sources of variation include controlled parameters, such as sampling materials and processing methods, which often differ among studies, as well as random and systematic errors; however, the relative contributions of these factors remain unclear. the objective of this study was to determine the relative impacts of sample processing methods, including extraction solution and physical dissociation method (vortexing and sonication), on recovery of gram-positive (bacillus cereus) and gram-negative (burkholderia thailandensis and escherichia coli) bacteria from directly inoculated wipes. this work showed that target organism had the largest impact on extraction efficiency and recovery precision, as measured by traditional colony counts. the physical dissociation method (pdm) had negligible impact, while the effect of the extraction solution was organism dependent. overall, however, extraction of organisms from wipes using phosphate-buffered saline with 0.04% tween 80 (pbst) resulted in the highest mean recovery across all three organisms. the results from this study contribute to a better understanding of the factors that influence sampling performance, which is critical to the development of efficient and reliable sampling methodologies relevant to public health and biodefense.

TI  == detection of foodborne pathogens and analysis of aflatoxin levels in home-made doenjang samples.
AB  == doenjang is a traditional korean fermented soybean product that provides a major  source of protein. in this study, a total of 18 different home-made doenjang samples were examined for the presence of foodborne pathogens and the total aflatoxin levels. using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to assess microbial  quality and potential public health risk, we showed that total coliform levels in the doenjang samples ranged from 0 to 4.43+/-2.32 x10(6) cfu/g, and the maximum limit of bacillus cereus was 4.67+/-2.0x10(5) cfu/g. however, other foodborne pathogens, such as staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli o157:h7 and salmonella spp., were not detected among the tested samples. one of the samples (s3) showed  a maximum limit of 42.2+/-9.1 mug/kg for aflatoxin levels, which was above the safety limit allowed by the codex alimentarius commission (cac) regulatory agency. further research is necessary to determine whether and how doenjang safety can be improved via elimination/reduction of microbial contamination during fermentation and storage or using microbial starter cultures for its fermentation.

TI  == bc4707 is a major facilitator superfamily multidrug resistance transport protein  from bacillus cereus implicated in fluoroquinolone tolerance.
AB  == transcriptional profiling highlighted a subset of genes encoding putative multidrug transporters in the pathogen bacillus cereus that were up-regulated during stress produced by bile salts. one of these multidrug transporters (bc4707) was selected for investigation. functional characterization of the bc4707 protein in escherichia coli revealed a role in the energized efflux of xenobiotics. phenotypic analyses after inactivation of the gene bc4707 in bacillus cereus atcc14579 suggested a more specific, but modest role in the efflux of norfloxacin. in addition to this, transcriptional analyses showed that  bc4707 is also expressed during growth of b. cereus under non-stressful conditions where it may have a role in the normal physiology of the bacteria. altogether, the results indicate that bc4707, which is part of the core genome of the b. cereus group of bacteria, encodes a multidrug resistance efflux protein that is likely involved in maintaining intracellular homeostasis during growth of the bacteria.

TI  == rapid detection of bacterial contamination of platelet-rich plasma-derived platelet concentrates using flow cytometry.
AB  == flow cytometry can be used to detect bacterial contamination of platelet products. in this study, we investigated whether the incubation of a minimal volume of platelet-rich plasma (prp)-derived platelet concentrates (pcs) with growth medium improved the analytical sensitivity of flow cytometry. five bacterial strains (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, bacillus cereus, klebsiella pneumoniae, and escherichia coli) were used. platelets were inoculated with 10, 10(2), and 10(3) cfus per ml; 0.5 ml, 1.0 ml, and 2.0 ml aliquots of spiked platelets were incubated with growth medium at 37 degrees c for 24 hours. during the incubation period, the numbers of events were analyzed every 4 hours by flow cytometry. we could detect a low concentration (10 cfus per ml) of bacteria in a small volume (minimum 0.5 ml) of pcs. irrespective of spiking concentrations and incubation volumes, the detection times of s. aureus and s. epidermidis were 24 hours or less, while those of b. cereus, k. pneumoniae, and e. coli were 16 hours or less. a higher spiking concentration made it possible to shorten the detection time. the numbers of detected bacteria  increased during the incubation. however, the graphs corresponding to k. pneumoniae and e. coli showed peak levels and decreasing patterns during the incubation period. the incubation of small volumes of pc with growth medium increased the analytical sensitivity of flow cytometry for bacterial detection. therefore, flow cytometry can serve as a useful method for sterility testing using prp-derived pcs with only low levels of consequent platelet loss.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of platelet (plt)-poor plasma, plt-rich plasma, plt gel, and solvent/detergent-treated plt lysate biomaterials against wound bacteria.
AB  == background: platelet (plt) gels exhibit antimicrobial activity useful for wound healing. the nature of the antibacterial component(s) is unknown. study design and methods: plt-poor plasma (ppp), plt-rich plasma (prp), plt gel (pg), and solvent/detergent-treated plt lysate (s/d-pl) from two donors were evaluated either native or after complement heat inactivation. materials were spiked at a 10% ratio (vol/vol) with approximately 10(7-8) colony-forming units/ml with four  gram-positive and four gram-negative bacteria of the wound flora. bacterial count was determined by plate assays at time of spiking and after 3 and 48 hours at 31  degrees c. bacteria growth inhibition tests were also performed. results: there was no viable escherichia coli colony for 48 hours after spiking to the plasma and plt materials from both donors, corresponding to greater than 7.51 to greater than 9.05 log inactivation. pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, and staphylococcus aureus were inactivated (approx. 4.7, 7, and 2 log, respectively)  3 hours after spiking to prp, ppp, or s/d-pl from the first donor but less (1.1,  4.6, and 0.2 log, respectively) in pg, before a regrowth at 48 hours in all materials. similar data were obtained with the second donor. no plasma and plt material had antimicrobial activity against enterobacter cloacae, bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, and staphylococcus epidermidis. complement-inactivated samples had no antimicrobial activity. conclusion: plasma complement is mostly responsible for the activity of plasma and plt biomaterials against e. coli, p. aeruginosa, k. pneumoniae, and s. aureus. activation of the coagulation to prepare pg may reduce antimicrobial activity. these findings may help optimize the control of wound infections by blood biomaterials.

TI  == invariant gly residue is important for alpha-defensin folding, dimerization, and  function: a case study of the human neutrophil alpha-defensin hnp1.
AB  == the human alpha-defensins (hnp) are synthesized in vivo as inactive prodefensins, and contain a conserved glycine, gly(17), which is part of a beta-bulge structure. it had previously been shown that the glycine main chain torsion angles are in a d-configuration, and that d-amino acids but not l-alanine could be substituted at that position to yield correctly folded peptides without the help of a prodomain. in this study, the glycine to l-alanine mutant defensin was  synthesized in the form of a prodefensin using native chemical ligation. the ligation product folded correctly and yielded an active peptide upon cnbr cleavage. the l-ala(17)-hnp1 crystal structure depicted a beta-bulge identical to wild-type hnp1. however, dimerization was perturbed, causing one monomer to tilt  with respect to the other in a dimerization model. inhibitory activity against the anthrax lethal factor showed a 2-fold reduction relative to wild-type hnp1 as measured by the inhibitory concentration ic(50). self-association was slightly reduced, as detected by surface plasmon resonance measurements. according to the  results of the virtual colony count assay, the antibacterial activity against escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, and bacillus cereus exhibited a less than 2-fold reduction in virtual lethal dose values. prodefensins with two other  l-amino acid substitutions, arg and phe, at the same position did not fold, indicating that only small side chains are tolerable. these results further elucidate the factors governing the region of the beta-bulge structure that includes gly(17), illuminating why glycine is conserved in all mammalian alpha-defensins.

TI  == antimicrobial effects of silver nanoparticles against bacterial cells adhered to  stainless steel surfaces.
AB  == given the increasing number of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and the need to synthesize new antimicrobials, silver has attracted interest in the scientific community because of its recognized antimicrobial activity. this study aimed to evaluate the antimicrobial effects of silver nanoparticles (np) obtained by a new method and tested at concentrations of 6 mug/ml and 60 mug/ml against the species staphylococcus aureus, listeria innocua, salmonella choleraesuis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, and bacillus cereus. the ability of these nanoparticles to remove or kill vegetative cells adhered to stainless steel surfaces was also evaluated. we observed that the np obtained with the new method, concentrated silver nanoparticles (cnp), and silver nanoparticles with added sodium chloride (npnacl) had high antimicrobial activities (p < 0.05). we also verified that the most effective condition for the removal of p. aeruginosa  cells on stainless steel coupons (10 by 10 mm) was immersion of the surfaces in cnp. the cnp treatment produced a 5-log reduction of the microbial population after 30 to 60 min of immersion. the cnp treatment also performed better than water and sodium carbonate, a compound commonly applied in clean-in-place procedures in the food industry, in removing adherent b. cereus cells from stainless steel cylinders. therefore, these results suggest that np synthesized by a new procedure may be used as antimicrobials in the food industry, for example, for the sanitization of utensils that come into contact with foods.

AB  == six derivatives of guttiferone-a (lfqm-79, 80, 81, 82, 113 and 114) were synthesized and evaluated for their antimicrobial activity against the opportunistic or pathogenic fungi candida albicans (atcc 09548), candida glabrata (atcc 90030), candida krusei (atcc 6258), candida parapsilosis (atcc 69548), candida tropicalis (atcc 750), cryptococcus neoformans (atcc 90012), trichophyton tonsurans, microsporum gypseum and also against the opportunistic and pathogenic  gram-positive bacteria staphylococcus aureus (atcc 6538), staphylococcus epidermidis (atcc 12228), bacillus cereus (atcc 11778) and gram-negative escherichia coli (atcc 25922), pseudomonas aeruginosa (atcc 9027), salmonella typhimurium (atcc 14028), proteus mirabilis (atcc 25933). the antimicrobial activities of derivatives were compared with guttiferone-a and they presented to  be more potent than the original molecule and sometimes greater than standard drugs established in therapeutics. the current study showed that derivatives of guttiferone-a possess potent antimicrobial activity and are relatively non-cytotoxic, which reveal these new molecules as promising new drug prototype candidates, with innovative structural pattern.

TI  == antimicrobial and safety properties of lactobacilli isolated from two cameroonian traditional fermented foods.
AB  == twenty-one lactobacillus isolates from "sha'a" (a maize - based fermented beverage) and "kossam" (traditionally fermented cow milk) were selected in accordance with their antagonistic activities and tested for their bacteriocinogenic potential as well as safety properties. these isolates were preliminarily identified as lactobacillus plantarum (62%), lactobacillus rhamnosus (24%), lactobacillus fermentum (10%) and lactobacillus coprophilus (4%) based on phenotypic characteristics and rep-pcr genomic fingerprinting. twelve (57.1%) out of the 21 strains tested were found to be bacteriocin producers, as revealed by the sensitivity of their antimicrobial substances to proteolytic enzymes (trypsin, proteinase k) and inhibition of other lactobacillus spp. these  bacteriocinogenic strains showed no positive haemolytic and gelatinase activities and proved to be sensitive to penicillin g, ampicillin, tetracycline, erythromycin, amoxicillin, chloramphenicol, co-trimoxazole and doxycyclin, but resistant to ciprofloxacin and gentamicin. the bacteriocins showed a broad inhibitory activity against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogenic bacteria,  several of which are classified as especially dangerous by the world health organization, as well as multidrug-resistant strains. these include staphylococcus aureus, salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovare typhi, bacillus cereus, streptococcus mutans, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa,  klebsiella pneumoniae and shigella flexneri. these lactobacillus strains are promising candidates for use as protective cultures in food fermentation.

TI  == inhibition of cytotoxicity by the nhe cytotoxin of bacillus cereus through the interaction of dodecyl maltoside with the nheb component.
AB  == nhe ('nonhaemolytic enterotoxin') is a three-component cytotoxin implicated in the pathogenesis of diarrhoea by bacillus cereus. nhe forms pores in pure lipid bilayers, but the function of the individual components (nhea, nheb and nhec) remains unclear. nheb and nhec are structural homologues of clya, a pore-forming  cytotoxin of escherichia coli. the non-ionic detergent dodecyl maltoside (ddm) has been shown to inhibit haemolysis of clya. we used ddm as a probe to examine the response of the nhe proteins to ddm micelles. at its critical micellar concentration (0.2 mm), ddm inhibited propidium uptake by the native nhe complex  in vero and ht29 cell suspensions. pre-incubation of nhec with ddm did not inhibit cytotoxicity. nheb exhibited marked changes in 1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulphonic acid (ans) fluorescence after pre-exposure to ddm. pre-incubation of nheb with ddm resulted in large molecular weight complexes as detected by size exclusion chromatography and diffusion through sized dialysis membranes and prevented binding of nheb to vero cell monolayers. these data support a model in which conformational changes and oligomerization of nheb are prerequisite events in the process of pore formation.

TI  == [investigation of ampicillin effect on morphological and mechanical properties of escherichia coli and bacillus cereus cells with atomic force microscopy].
AB  == the effect of subbacteriostatic concentrations of ampicillin on morphological and mechanical properties of gramnegative and grampositive cells of escherichia coli  k12 tg1 and bacillus cereus ip 5832 respectively was studied with atomic force microscopy. significant heterogeneity of the bacterial populations was shown by the character of the response to the antibiotic effect. the common feature was increase of the cell size likely due to the effect of the inner osmotic pressure  on the lowered cell wall strength. in the e. coli population there were besides observed anomalous elongated cells with signs of septation disorder, as well as their structurs, lacking the cytoplasmic liquid fraction. in the b. cereus the inner osmotic pressure mainly enlarged the cell cross section, changing the cell  shape from rod to sphere, that was accompanied by significant impairment of the surface structure with liberation of the peptidoglycane fragments to the medium.  the particular features of the e. coli k12 tg1 and b. cereus ip 5832 respond to the ampicillin effect were attributed to the differences in the structure of their cell wall, also due to specific properties of the peptidoglycane synthesis  and three-dimensional organization.

TI  == substituted salicylaldehydes as potential antimicrobial drugs: minimal inhibitory and microbicidal concentrations.
AB  == substituted salicylaldehydes are potent antibacterial and antifungal agents and may have chemotherapeutic potential. in the clinical setting, the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) as well as the minimal bactericidal and fungicidal concentrations (mbc and mfc, respectively) are of fundamental interest. therefore, we have now, using a panel of five microbial species (bacillus cereus, candida albicans, escherichia coli, saccharomyces cerevisiae, and staphylococcus  aureus), determined the mic and mbc/mfc values of a total of 22 aromatic aldehydes, including 19 substituted salicylaldehydes and the unsubstituted parent compounds benzaldehyde and salicylaldehyde (2-hydroxybenzaldehyde). the results clearly indicate that both of the yeasts studied are remarkably sensitive to various salicylaldehydes and, especially, to halogenated ones. some congeners clearly merit consideration as potential therapeutic agents for candida infections. the mic values of the most potent congeners are of roughly the same magnitude as that of amphotericin b, and the results of the mfc measurements indicate that the compounds are fungicidal. all of the bacteria studied are also  sensitive to at least some of the compounds tested but, clearly, this class of antimicrobials has superior activity against yeasts. structure-activity relationships are discussed for each microbial species and compared with each other. the comparison of the results of mic and mbc/mfc measurements with those of agar diffusion tests revealed aspects that are of interest concerning the methodology of antimicrobial activity screening. unexpectedly, it was found that  some compounds that are completely devoid of activity in agar diffusion tests had potent activity in mic tests, indicating that if only agar diffusion methodology  is used in drug discovery, some highly active compounds may be missed.

AB  == gc and ms were used for the analysis of croatian centaurium erythraea rafn essential oil (obtained by hydrodistillation) and headspace (applying headspace solid-phase microextraction). the headspace contained numerous monoterpene hydrocarbons (the major ones were terpinene-4-ol, methone, p-cymene, gamma-terpinene and limonene). oxygenated monoterpenes were present in the headspace and oil, while 1,8-cineole, bornyl acetate and verbenone were present only in the headspace. high headspace percentages of toluene and naphthalene were found, followed by hemimellitene. lot of similarities were observed with serbian  c. erythraea oil [neophytadiene (1.4%), thymol (2.6%), carvacrol (6.1%) and hexadecanoic acid (5.7%)], but different features were also noted such as the presence of menthol, menthone and phytone. the oil fractionation enabled identification of other minor compounds not found in total oil such as norisoprenoides, alk-1-enes or chromolaenin. the essential oil showed antimicrobial potential on escherichia coli, salmonella enteritidis, staphylococcus aureus and bacillus cereus. on the other hand, no antibacterial activity of the oil was observed on pseudomonas fluorescens and lysteria monocytogenes.

TI  == structural basis of the substrate specificity of bacillus cereus adenosine phosphorylase.
AB  == purine nucleoside phosphorylases catalyze the phosphorolytic cleavage of the glycosidic bond of purine (2'-deoxy)nucleosides, generating the corresponding free base and (2'-deoxy)-ribose 1-phosphate. two classes of pnps have been identified: homotrimers specific for 6-oxopurines and homohexamers that accept both 6-oxopurines and 6-aminopurines. bacillus cereus adenosine phosphorylase (adop) is a hexameric pnp; however, it is highly specific for 6-aminopurines. to  investigate the structural basis for the unique substrate specificity of adop, the active-site mutant d204n was prepared and kinetically characterized and the structures of the wild-type protein and the d204n mutant complexed with adenosine and sulfate or with inosine and sulfate were determined at high resolution (1.2-1.4 a). adop interacts directly with the preferred substrate through a hydrogen-bond donation from the catalytically important residue asp204 to n7 of the purine base. comparison with escherichia coli pnp revealed a more optimal orientation of asp204 towards n7 of adenosine and a more closed active site. when inosine is bound, two water molecules are interposed between asp204 and the n7 and o6 atoms of the nucleoside, thus allowing the enzyme to find alternative but  less efficient ways to stabilize the transition state. the mutation of asp204 to  asparagine led to a significant decrease in catalytic efficiency for adenosine without affecting the efficiency of inosine cleavage.

TI  == seasonal variations of phenolic compounds and biological properties in sage (salvia officinalis l.).
AB  == the aim was to investigate the phenolic content, antioxidant capacity, and antibacterial activity of dalmatian sage (salvia officinalis l.) leaves collected during different vegetation periods. separation and quantification of the individual phenols were performed by reversed-phase (rp)-hplc coupled with a pda  (photodiode array) detector and using an internal standard, while the contents of total phenols, flavonoids, flavones, and flavonols were determined spectrophotometrically. the antioxidant properties of the sage leaf extracts were evaluated using five different antioxidant assays (frap, dpph, abts, briggs-rauscher reaction, and beta-carotene bleaching). the antimicrobial activity of the extracts was tested against two gram-positive (bacillus cereus and staphylococcus aureus) and two gram-negative (salmonella infantis and escherichia coli) bacterial reference strains. all extracts were extremely rich in phenolic compounds, and provided good antioxidant and antibacterial properties, but the phenophase in which the leaves were collected affected the phenolic composition of the sage extracts and consequently their biological activity. the may extract, the richest in total flavonoids, showed the best antioxidant properties and the highest antimicrobial activity. thus, collection of the plants during may seems the best choice for further use of them in the pharmaceutical and food industry.

TI  == application of atmospheric pressure nonthermal plasma for the in vitro eradication of bacterial biofilms.
AB  == the use of atmospheric pressure nonthermal plasma represents an interesting and novel approach for the decontamination of surfaces colonized with microbial biofilms that exhibit enhanced tolerance to antimicrobial challenge. in this study, the influence of an atmospheric pressure nonthermal plasma jet, operated in a helium and oxygen gas mixture under ambient pressure, was evaluated against  biofilms of bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa. within < 4 min of plasma exposure, complete eradication of the two gram-positive bacterial biofilms was achieved. although gram-negative  biofilms required longer treatment time, their complete eradication was still possible with 10 min of exposure. whilst this study provides useful proof of concept data on the use of atmospheric pressure plasmas for the eradication of bacterial biofilms in vitro, it also demonstrates the critical need for improved  understanding of the mechanisms and kinetics related to such a potentially significant approach.

TI  == mechanism and diversity of the erythromycin esterase family of enzymes.
AB  == macrolide antibiotics such as azithromycin and erythromycin are mainstays of modern antibacterial chemotherapy, and like all antibiotics, they are vulnerable  to resistance. one mechanism of macrolide resistance is via drug inactivation: enzymatic hydrolysis of the macrolactone ring catalyzed by erythromycin esterases, erea and ereb. a genomic enzymology approach was taken to gain insight into the catalytic mechanisms and origins of ere enzymes. our analysis reveals that erythromycin esterases comprise a separate group in the hydrolase superfamily, which includes homologues of uncharacterized function found on the chromosome of bacillus cereus, bcr135 and bcr136, whose three-dimensional structures have been determined. biochemical characterization of bcr136 confirms  that it is an esterase that is, however, unable to inactivate macrolides. using steady-state kinetics, homology-based structure modeling, site-directed mutagenesis, solvent isotope effect studies, ph, and inhibitor profiling performed in various combinations for erea, ereb, and bcr136 enzymes, we identified the active site and gained insight into some catalytic features of this novel enzyme superfamily. we rule out the possibility of a ser/thr nucleophile and show that one histidine, h46 (ereb numbering), is essential for catalytic function. this residue is proposed to serve as a general base in activation of a water molecule as the reaction nucleophile. furthermore, we show  that erea, ereb, and bcr136 are distinct, with only erea inhibited by chelating agents and hypothesized to contain a noncatalytic metal. detailed characterization of these esterases allows for a direct comparison of the resistance determinants, erea and ereb, with their prototype, bcr136, and for the discussion of their potential connections.

TI  == iodine-stabilized cu nanoparticle chitosan composite for antibacterial applications.
AB  == we report herein the synthesis of a new composite consisting of cu nanoparticles  (nps) and chitosan (cs), which has been found to be stable in the presence of molecular iodine and has also high antimicrobial activities. the composite could  be obtained when aqueous cuso(4) was treated with hydrazine in the presence of cs. the spherical cu nps present in the composite were of average diameters 8+/-4 nm. the nps were unstable in atmospheric conditions leading to the formation of oxides of cu. on the other hand, when molecular iodine was added to the medium following synthesis the nps were rather stable. studies of antibacterial property were carried out on gram-negative green fluorescent expressing escherichia coli bacteria & gram-positive bacillus cereus bacteria. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of the iodinated composite on escherichia coli was found to be 130.8 mug/ml, which contained 21.5 mug/ml cu nps. this determined value of mic for cu nps was much lower than those reported in the literature. zeta potential (zeta) measurements supported an attractive interaction between iodinated cs-cu np composite and bacteria which was further supported by electron microscopic images. electron microscopic and flow cytometric studies revealed that the iodinated cs-cu np composite was attached to the bacterial cell wall, which caused irreversible damage to the membrane, eventually leading to cell death. mechanism of bactericidal action of the iodinated composite is discussed in light of our findings.

TI  == electrochemical biosensor for rapid and sensitive detection of magnetically extracted bacterial pathogens.

TI  == using a multi-faceted approach to determine the changes in bacterial cell surface properties influenced by a biofilm lifestyle.
AB  == biofilm formation is a developmental process in which initial reversible adhesion is governed by physico-chemical forces, whilst irreversible adhesion is mediated  by biological changes within a cell, such as the production of extracellular polymeric substances. using two bacteria, e. coli mg1655 and b. cereus atcc 10987, this study establishes that the surface of the bacterial cell also undergoes specific modifications, which result in biofilm formation and maintenance. using various surface characterisation techniques and proteomics, an increase in the surface exposed proteins on e. coli cells during biofilm formation was demonstrated, along with an increase in hydrophobicity and a decrease in surface charge. for b. cereus, an increase in the surface polysaccharides during biofilm formation was found as well as a decrease in hydrophobicity and surface charge. this work therefore shows that surface modifications during biofilm formation occur and understanding these specific changes may lead to the formulation of effective biofilm control strategies in the future.

TI  == rapid detection of vip1-type genes from bacillus cereus and characterization of a novel vip binary toxin gene.
AB  == a pcr-restriction fragment length polymorphism (pcr-rflp) method for identifying  vegetative insecticidal protein (vip) 1-type genes from bacillus cereus was developed by designing specific primers based on the conserved regions of the genes to amplify vip1-type gene fragments. pcr products were digested with endonuclease acii, and four known vip1-type genes were identified. vip1ac and vip1aa-type genes appeared in 17 of 26 b. cereus strains. a novel vip1-type gene, vip1ac1, was identified from b. cereus strain hl12. the vip1ac1 and vip2ae3 genes were co-expressed in escherichia coli strain bl21 by vector pcoladuet-1. the binary toxin showed activity only against aphis gossypii (homoptera), but not for coleptera (tenebrio molitor, holotrichia oblita), lepidoptera (spodoptera exigua, helicoverpa armigera, and chilo suppressalis), diptera (culex quinquefasciatus).  the lc(50) of this binary toxin for a. gossypii is 87.5 (34.2-145.3) ng ml(-1) .  this is probably only the second report that vip1 and vip2 binary toxin shows toxicity against homopteran pests. the pcr-rflp method developed could be very useful for identifying novel vip1-vip2-type binary toxins, and the novel binary toxins, vip1ac1 and vip2ae3, identified in this study may have applications in biological control of insects, thus avoiding potential problems of resistance.

TI  == impact of solvent/detergent treatment of plasma on transfusion-relevant bacteria.
AB  == background: a solvent/detergent (s/d) treatment in a medical device has been developed for pathogen reduction of plasma for transfusion. impact of s/d on bacterial growth and on the capacity of complement to kill bacteria has been investigated in this study. study design and methods: a pool of apheresis plasma  from four donors was spiked with eight transfusion-relevant bacteria. plasma was  treated with 1% tri(n-butyl) phosphate and 1% triton x-45 at 31 degrees c for 90  min and then extracted by oil at 31 degrees c for 70 min. decomplemented plasma and phosphate buffer saline were used as controls. bacterial count was determined in samples taken immediately after spiking, or after s/d and oil treatment. similar experiments were conducted using three individual recovered plasma donations. bacteria growth inhibition tests were performed using discs soaked with plasma samples whether containing the s/d agents or not. results: the mean reduction factors of escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and klebsiella pneumoniae due to complement during s/d treatment were >8.75, 4.71, and 4.18 log  in pooled plasma and >7.42, 2.24 and >6.08 log in individual plasmas, respectively. bacillus cereus and bacillus subtilis were inactivated by s/d (>7.04 and 1.60 log in pooled, and >6.06 and 2.39 in individual plasmas, respectively). staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and enterobacter cloacae did not multiply during s/d treatment of plasma. growth inhibition tests  revealed an inhibition of three gram-negative bacteria by complement and all gram-positive by s/d. conclusion: the s/d treatment of plasma does not alter the  bactericidal activity of complement, and inactivates some gram-positive bacteria.

TI  == salt sensitivity of minimal twin arginine translocases.
AB  == bacterial twin arginine translocation (tat) pathways have evolved to facilitate transport of folded proteins across membranes. gram-negative bacteria contain a tatabc translocase composed of three subunits named tata, tatb, and tatc. in contrast, the tat translocases of most gram-positive bacteria consist of only tata and tatc subunits. in these minimal tatac translocases, a bifunctional tata  subunit fulfils the roles of both tata and tatb. here we have probed the importance of conserved residues in the bifunctional tatay subunit of bacillus subtilis by site-specific mutagenesis. a set of engineered tatay proteins with mutations in the cytoplasmic hinge and amphipathic helix regions were found to be inactive in protein translocation under standard growth conditions for b. subtilis or when heterologously expressed in escherichia coli. nevertheless, these mutated tatay proteins did assemble into tatay and tataycy complexes, and they facilitated membrane association of twin arginine precursor proteins in e. coli. interestingly, most of the mutated tataycy translocases were salt-sensitive in b. subtilis. similarly, the tatac translocases of bacillus cereus and staphylococcus aureus were salt-sensitive when expressed in b. subtilis. taken together, our present observations imply that salt-sensitive electrostatic interactions have critical roles in the preprotein translocation activity of certain tatac type translocases from gram-positive bacteria.

AB  == in vertebrates, the globular "head" of complement component c1q receptor (gc1qr)  is a versatile, multiligand binding protein. however, research on its function in invertebrates is limited. in the present study, a full-length cdna sequence of a  novel gc1qr homolog, fcgc1qr, from the chinese white shrimp fenneropenaeus chinensis was cloned. semi-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (pcr) detected  fcgc1qr in all examined tissues, with the highest level detected in the intestine. western blot assay further revealed that the fcgc1qr protein was distributed in all tested tissues except the cell-free hemolymph of normal chinese white shrimp. in the expression pattern study, quantitative real-time pcr demonstrated that the transcripts of fcgc1qr were up-regulated when challenged with bacteria (vibrio anguillarum or staphylococcus aureus) and white spot syndrome virus. subsequently, fcgc1qr was over-expressed in escherichia coli, and the polyclonal antibody was prepared with the purified recombinant protein. microorganism binding was examined using western blot assay, and revealed that fcgc1qr could bind to bacillus cereus, bacillus thuringiensis, s. aureus, v. anguillarum, vibrioharveyi, and candida albicans. fcgc1qr was also proven able to bind to s. aureus in a concentration-dependent manner, and this binding activity  was partly inhibited by the polyclonal antibody. these results suggest that fcgc1qr may be involved in defending against bacterial infections in the chinese  white shrimp.

TI  == the potential for reductive mobilization of arsenic [as(v) to as(iii)] by osbh(2) (pseudomonas stutzeri) and osbh(5) (bacillus cereus) in an oil-contaminated site.
AB  == microbial reduction of arsenate [as(v)] plays an important role in arsenic (as) mobilization in aqueous environments. in this study, we investigated reduction of arsenate by different bacterial isolates such as osbh(1) (gu329913), osbh(2) (gu329914), osbh(3) (gu329915), osbh(4) (gu329916) and osbh(5) (gu329917), isolated from the oil sludge of a sewage treatment plant operated by the china petroleum refinery company in kaohsiung, southern taiwan. bacterial strains of pure culture were identified by 16s rrna analysis (>/=99 % nucleotide similarity). morphological and 16s rrna analysis show that the isolate osbh(1) is similar to e. coli, osbh(2) is similar to p. stutzeri, osbh(3) is similar to p. putida, osbh(4) is similar to p. aeruginosa, and osbh(5) is similar to b. cereus. the as(v) was transformed to as(iii) in the presence of isolates osbh(2) and osbh(5) by a detoxification process. the potential reduction rates of as(v) were  higher in the presence of isolate osbh(5) compared to the isolate osbh(2). the microbial growth (cell/ml) of isolate osbh(5) was significantly higher in culture medium compared to osbh(2). the bacterial isolates such as osbh(1), osbh(3) and osbh(4) were found to be incapable of transforming the as(v). it is concluded that the activity of the oil-degrading bacterial isolates described in this work  contributes to the mobilization of as in the more toxic as(iii) form that affects biotic life.

TI  == chemical and microbiological hazards associated with recycling of anaerobic digested residue intended for agricultural use.
AB  == in the present study, three full-scale biogas plants (bgp) were investigated for  the concentration of heavy metals, organic pollutants, pesticides and the pathogenic bacteria bacillus cereus and escherichia coli in the anaerobically digested residues (adr). the bgps mainly utilize source-separated organic wastes  and industrial food waste as energy sources and separate the adr into an adr-liquid and an adr-solid fraction by centrifugation at the bgp. according to the norwegian standard for organic fertilizers, the adr were classified as quality 1 mainly because of high zinc (132-422 mg kg(-1) dm) and copper (23-93 mg kg(-1) dm) concentrations, but also because of high cadmium (0.21-0.60 mg kg(-1)  dm) concentrations in the liquid-adr. in the screening of organic pollutants, only dehp (9.7-62.1 mg kg(-1)) and summation operator pah 16 (0.2-1.98 mg kg(-1)  dm) were detected in high concentrations according to international regulations.  of the 250 pesticides analyzed, 11 were detected, but only imazalil (<0.30-5.77 mg kg(-1) dm) and thiabendazol (<0.14-0.73 mg kg(-1) dm) were frequently detected in the adr-fiber. concentrations of imazalil and thiabendazol were highest during the winter months, due to a high consumption of citrus fruits in norway in this period. ten percent of the adr-liquid samples contained cereulide-producing b. cereus, whereas no verotoxigenic e. coli was detected. the authors conclude that  the risk of chemical and bacterial contamination of the food chain or the environment from agricultural use of adr seems low.

TI  == antibacterial properties of a glycolipid-rich extract and active principle from nunavik collections of the macroalgae fucus evanescens c. agardh (fucaceae).
AB  == this study investigated the antibacterial activity of glycolipid-rich extracts of the brown macroalga fucus evanescens in cell culture. accessions were collected on the arctic coast of ungava bay, nunavik, quebec. the crude ethyl acetate extract of these accessions showed strong antibacterial activity (>/=4 log(10) cfu) against hemophilus influenzae , legionella pneumophila , propionibacterium acnes (atcc and clinical isolate), and streptococcus pyogenes at 100 microg/ml. this algal extract inhibited by 3 log(10) clostridium difficile and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus , whereas bacillus cereus , escherichia coli , klebsiella pneumoniae , and pseudomonas aeruginosa were not significantly affected. further investigations of the activity of a glycolipid-rich fraction, extracted with dichloromethane, against propionibacterium acnes showed an mic(100) of 50 microg/ml, with an inhibition of more than 99% at only 7.8 microg/ml. the main active compound, a beta-d-galactosyl o-linked glycolipid, was synthesized for the bioassay and showed an mic(100) of 50 microg/ml but lost its activity more quickly with only 50% of inhibition at 12.5 microg/ml. therefore, the semipurified f. evanescens extract could be a good choice for future research into the development of alternative treatments for acne therapy.

TI  == exponential atp amplification through simultaneous regeneration from amp and pyrophosphate for luminescence detection of bacteria.
AB  == bacteria monitoring is essential for many industrial manufacturing processes, particularly those involving in food, biopharmaceuticals, and semiconductor production. firefly luciferase atp luminescence assay is a rapid and simple bacteria detection method. however, the detection limit of this assay for escherichia coli is approximately 10(4) colony-forming units (cfu), which is insufficient for many applications. this study aims to improve the assay sensitivity by simultaneous conversion of pp(i) and amp, two products of the luciferase reaction, back to atp to form two chain-reaction loops. because each consumed atp continuously produces two new atp molecules, this approach can achieve exponential amplification of atp. two consecutive enzyme reactions were employed to regenerate amp into atp: adenylate kinase converting amp into adp using utp as the energy source, and acetate kinase catalyzing acetyl phosphate and adp into atp. the pp(i)-recycling loop was completed using atp sulfurylase and adenosine 5' phosphosulfate. the modification maintains good quantification linearity in the atp luminescence assay and greatly increases its bacteria detection sensitivity. this improved method can detect bacteria concentrations of fewer than 10 cfu. this exponential atp amplification assay will benefit bacteria monitoring in public health and manufacturing processes that require high-quality water.

TI  == survival and growth of foodborne bacterial pathogens in fermenting dough of wadi, a legume-based indigenous food.
AB  == wadi is a hollow, brittle, ball- or cone-shaped popular traditional legume-based  product of many countries in the indian subcontinent. to prepare wadi, blackgram  (phaseolus mungo l.) dhal (dehusked split seeds) was soaked, ground to a soft dough, fermented for 10 h in a closed container, moulded into balls or cones and  dried for ~60 h (repeating a cycle of 8 h sun-drying at 29-33 degrees c and then  16 h shade-drying at 28-30 degrees c). this study aims at understanding the fate  of some selected foodborne bacterial pathogens during a chance contamination of blackgram dough at the time of preparing wadi. uninoculated dough, during the course of its processing to wadi, remained free from staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli, but got contained by bacillus cereus during the first 10 h of fermentation and also the next 24 h of drying wadi. b. cereus, when spiked into freshly prepared dough at a load of 5.2 log cfu/g, also diminished after 24 h of  drying (detection limit (dl), 100 cfu/g). s. aureus (dl, 100 cfu/g) and e. coli (dl, 10 cfu/g) reached below the dl after 36 h of drying. after 10 h of fermentation and 36 h of drying, the moisture content decreased from initial 61.9 to 33.5%, and the ph declined from 6.0 to 4.8.

AB  == fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (fbp) aldolase has been used as biocatalyst in the synthesis of several pharmaceutical compounds such as monosaccharides and analogs. is has been suggested that microbial metal-dependant class ii aldolases  could be better industrial catalysts than mammalian class i enzyme because of their greater stability. the class ii aldolases from four microbes were subcloned into the escherichia coli vector pt7-7, expressed and purified to near homogeneity. the kinetic parameters, temperature stability, ph profile, and tolerance to organic solvents of the class ii enzymes were determined, and compared with the properties of the class i aldolase from rabbit muscle. contrary to results obtained previously with the e. coli class ii aldolase, which was reported to be more stable than the mammalian enzyme, other recombinant class ii  aldolases were found to be generally less stable than the class i enzyme, especially in the presence of organic solvents. class ii aldolase from bacillus cereus showed higher temperature stability than the other enzymes tested, but only the mycobacterium tuberculosis class ii aldolase had a stability comparable  to the class i mammalian enzyme under assay conditions. the turnover number of the recombinant m. tuberculosis and magnaporthe grisea class ii type a aldolases  was comparable or higher than that of the class i enzyme. the recombinant b. cereus and pseudomonas aeruginosa class ii type b aldolases had very low turnover numbers and low metal content, indicating that the e. coli overexpression system  may not be suitable for the class ii type b aldolases from these microorganisms.

TI  == modulation of virulence and antibiotic susceptibility of enteropathogenic escherichia coli strains by enterococcus faecium probiotic strain culture fractions.
AB  == the increasing rate of antimicrobial resistance drastically reduced the efficiency of conventional antibiotics and led to the reconsideration of the interspecies interactions in influencing bacterial virulence and response to therapy. the aim of the study was the investigation of the influence of the soluble and cellular fractions of enterococcus (e.) faecium cmgb16 probiotic culture on the virulence and antibiotic resistance markers expression in clinical enteropathogenic escherichia (e.) coli strains. the 7 clinical enteropathogenic e. coli strains, one standard e. coli atcc 25,922 and one bacillus (b.) cereus strains were cultivated in nutrient broth, aerobically at 37 degrees c, for 24 h. the e. faecium cmgb16 probiotic strain was cultivated in anaerobic conditions, at 37 degrees c in mrs (man rogosa sharpe) broth, and co-cultivated with two pathogenic strains (b. cereus and e. coli o28) culture fractions (supernatant, washed sediment and heat-inactivated culture) for 6 h, at 37 degrees c. after co-cultivation, the soluble and cellular fractions of the probiotic strain cultivated in the presence of two pathogenic strains were separated by centrifugation (6000 rpm, 10 min), heat-inactivated (15 min, 100 degrees c) and co-cultivated with the clinical enteropathogenic e. coli strains in mcconkey broth, for 24 h, at 37 degrees c, in order to investigate the influence of the probiotic fractions on the adherence capacity and antibiotic susceptibility. all  tested probiotic combinations influenced the adherence pattern of e. coli tested  strains. the enteropathogenic e. coli strains susceptibility to aminoglycosides,  beta-lactams and quinolones was increased by all probiotic combinations and decreased for amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. this study demonstrates that the plurifactorial anti-infective action of probiotics is also due to the modulation  of virulence factors and antibiotic susceptibility expression in e. coli pathogenic strains.

AB  == aim: in pediococcus acidilactici atcc 8042, two activities of peptidoglycan hydrolase (pgh) with lytic effect against micrococcus lysodeikticus and staphylococcus aureus have been detected. this work intends to elucidate the growth phase of maximum lytic activity, the localization and the effectiveness of the activity against pathogenic gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. methods and results: cells were grown in mrs medium and collected at different growth stages, and the proteins were extracted. the highest pgh activity was found during the logarithmic growth phase in the protein fraction bound to the cell membrane. from this fraction, two distinct proteins bands (110- and 99-kda) in sds-page were partially purified with a three-step procedure. both bands showed lytic activity against m. lysodeikticus. mass spectrometry analysis (lc/esi-ms/ms) indicated that the 110-kda band corresponded to a protein of unknown function. the 99-kda band corresponded to a n-acetylmuramidase that harboured catalytic sites with n-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidase and n-acetylglucosaminidase activities. both proteins are reported in the ped. acidilactici 7_4 genome. the fraction containing the concentrated proteins (110 and 99 kda) inhibited the growth of several pathogenic strains as: bacillus cereus, listeria monocytogenes and salmonella typhimurium. the growth of s. aureus was diminished by 3 logarithmic units as early as 0.5 h of growth, while inhibition of escherichia coli and ped. acidilactici was observed after 18 and 8  h, respectively (both in one logarithmic unit). the minimum inhibitory concentration against s. aureus was 10 mug ml(-1). conclusion: pediococcus acidilactici harbours at least two lytic enzymes, one of them recognized as pgh for the first time, which exert antibacterial activity against several bacterial  strains. significance and impact of the study: both pgh activities have a broad growth inhibition spectrum and could be used to control pathogenic bacteria. because this activity comes from a lactic acid bacterium, it could be safely used in manufacturing processes of fermented foods.

AB  == formamidases (ec 3.5.1.49) are poorly characterized proteins. in spite of this scarce knowledge, ammonia has been described as playing a central role in the pathogenesis of human pathogens such as helicobacter pylori, for which formamidase has been shown to participate in the nitrogen metabolic pathway. sequence analysis has revealed that at least two different groups of formamidases are classified as ec 3.5.1.49: on the one hand, the derivatives of the fmda-amda  superfamily, which are the best studied to date, and on the other hand, the derivatives of helicobacter pylori amif. here we present the cloning, purification, and characterization of a recombinant formamidase from bacillus cereus cect 5050t (bceamif), the second member of the amif subfamily to be characterized, showing new features of the enzyme further supporting its relationship with aliphatic amidases. we also present homology modeling-based mutational studies confirming the importance of the glu140 and tyr191 residues in the enzymatic activities of the amif family. moreover, we can conclude that a second glutamate residue is critical in several members of the nitrilase superfamily, meaning that what has consistently been identified as a c-e-k triad  is in fact a c-e-e-k tetrad.

AB  == a local herb, kacip fatimah, is famous amongst malay women for its uses in parturition; however, its phytochemical contents have not been fully documented.  therefore, a study was performed to evaluate the phenolics, flavonoids, and total saponin contents, and antibacterial and antifungal properties of the leaf, stem and root of three varieties of labisia pumila benth. total saponins were found to be higher in the leaves of all three varieties, compared to the roots and stems.  leaves of var. pumila exhibited significantly higher total saponin content than var. alata and lanceolata, with values of 56.4, 43.6 and 42.3 mg diosgenin equivalent/g dry weight, respectively. hplc analyses of phenolics and flavonoids  in all three varieties revealed the presence of gallic acid, caffeic acid, rutin, and myricetin in all plant parts. higher levels of flavonoids (rutin, quercitin,  kaempferol) were observed in var. pumila compared with alata and lanceolata, whereas higher accumulation of phenolics (gallic acid, pyrogallol) was recorded in var. alata, followed by pumila and lanceolata. antibacterial activities of leaf, stem and root extracts of all varieties determined against both gram positive (micrococcus luteus, bacillus subtilis b145, bacillus cereus b43, staphylococcus aureus s1431) and gram negative (enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella pneumonia k36, escherichia coli e256, pseudomonas aeruginosa pi96) pathogens showed that crude methanolic extracts are active against these bacteria at low concentrations, albeit with lower antibacterial activity compared to kanamycin used as the control. antifungal activity of methanolic extracts of all  plant parts against fusarium sp., candida sp. and mucor using the agar diffusion  disc exhibited moderate to appreciable antifungal activities compared to streptomycin used as positive control.

TI  == molecular weight change of polyhydroxyalkanoate (pha) caused by the phac subunit  of pha synthase from bacillus cereus yb-4 in recombinant escherichia coli.
AB  == polyhydroxyalkanoate (pha)-producing bacillus strains possess class iv pha synthases composed of two subunit types, namely, phar and phac. in the present study, pha synthases from bacillus megaterium nbrc15308(t) (pharc(bm)), b. cereus yb-4 (pharc(yb4)), and hybrids (phar(bm)c(yb4) and phar(yb4)c(bm)) were expressed in escherichia coli jm109 to characterize the molecular weight of the synthesized poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) [p(3hb)]. pharc(bm) synthesized p(3hb) with a relatively  high molecular weight (m(n) = 890 x 10(3)) during 72 h of cultivation, whereas pharc(yb4) synthesized low-molecular-weight p(3hb) (m(n) = 20 x 10(3)). the molecular weight of p(3hb) synthesized by pharc(yb4) decreased with increasing culture time and temperature. this time-dependent behavior was observed for hybrid synthase phar(bm)c(yb4), but not for phar(yb4)c(bm). these results suggest that the molecular weight change is caused by the phac(yb4) subunit. the homology between phacs from b. megaterium and b. cereus yb-4 is 71% (amino acid identity); however, phac(yb4) was found to have a previously unknown effect on the molecular weight of the p(3hb) synthesized in e. coli.

TI  == preparation of mucoadhesive oral patches containing tetracycline hydrochloride and carvacrol for treatment of local mouth bacterial infections and candidiasis.
AB  == the specific aim of this work was to prepare mucoadhesive patches containing tetracycline hydrochloride and carvacrol in an attempt to develop a novel oral drug delivery system for the treatment of mouth infections. the bilayered patches were prepared using ethyl cellulose as a backing layer and carbopol 934 as a matrix mucoadhesive layer. patches were prepared with different loading amounts of tetracycline hydrochloride and carvacrol. the antimicrobial activity was assessed for the prepared patches using the disc-diffusion method against the yeast candida albicans and five bacterial strains, including pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, and bacillus bronchispti. in this work, we highlighted the possibility of occurrence  of a synergistic action between carvacrol and tetracycline. the best formulation  was selected based on microbiological tests, drug release, ex-vivo mucoadhesive performance, and swelling index. physical characteristics of the selected formulations were determined. these included ph, patch thickness, weight uniformity, content uniformity, folding endurance, and patch stability.

TI  == natural resistance of rose petals to microbial attack.
AB  == petals of red, yellow and white roses (rosa damascene mill.) of the family rosaceae were extracted with (1:1) methylene chloride/methanol and tested for their antimicrobial activities against four species of gram-positive bacteria (bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, micrococcus luteus and staphylococcus aureus), five species of gram-negative bacteria (enterobacter aerogenes, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumonia, pseudomonas aeruginosa and serratia marcescens) and five species of fungi (penicillium notatum, aspergillus niger, rhizopus stolonifer, saccharomyces cerevisiae and fusarium oxysporum). all of the crude extracts showed a wide range of antimicrobial activities according to the tested organism and rose's type. micrococcus luteus was found to be the most susceptible bacteria to all crude extracts. red and yellow petal extracts showed  much higher antibacterial activity than the white petals extract. bacillus subtilis was found to be the least susceptible to all extracts. the fungus, penicillium notatum was found to be the most susceptible with white petal extract being the most effective. saccharomyces cerevisiae and fusarium oxysporum were the least susceptible to all extracts. white roses extract showed much higher antifungal activities against penicillium notatum than red or yellow roses, therefore, it was subjected to several bioassay guided chromatographic fractionations and purification to isolate the active chemical(s) responsible for the antifungal activity. chemical structure of the isolated antifungal compounds  were identified by spectroscopy techniques and found to be a gamma-sitosterol and (z,z)-9,12-octadecadienoic acid. antibacterial activity of the various types of rose extracts were due to complex mixtures of organic compounds which are still under chemical investigation and will be published later.

TI  == antibacterial activity of chemically defined chitosans: influence of molecular weight, degree of acetylation and test organism.
AB  == chitosans, polysaccharides obtained from the exoskeleton of crustaceans, have been shown to exert antibacterial activity in vitro and their use as a food preservative is of growing interest. however, beyond a consensus that chitosan appears to disrupt the bacterial cell membrane, published data are inconsistent on the chemical characteristics that confer the antibacterial activity of chitosan. while most authors agree that the net charge density of the polymer (reflected in the fraction of positively charged amino groups at the c-2 position of the glucosamine unit) is an important factor in antibacterial activity, conflicting data have been reported on the effect of molecular weight and on the  susceptibility among different bacterial species to chitosan. therefore, we prepared batches of water-soluble hydrochloride salts of chitosans with weight average molecular weights (m(w)) of 2-224kda and degree of acetylation of 0.16 and 0.48. their antibacterial activity was evaluated using tube inhibition assays and membrane integrity assays (n-phenyl-1-naphthylamine fluorescence and potassium release) against bacillus cereus, escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium and three lipopolysaccharide mutants of e. coli and s. typhimurium. chitosans with lower degree of acetylation (f(a)=0.16) were more active than the  more acetylated chitosans (f(a)=0.48). no trends in antibacterial action related  to increasing or decreasing m(w) were observed although one of the chitosans (m(w) 28.4kda, f(a)=0.16) was more active than the other chitosans, inhibiting growth and permeabilizing the membrane of all the test strains included. the test strains varied in their susceptibility to the different chitosans with wild type  s. typhimurium more resistant than the wild type e. coli. salmonellae lipopolysaccharide mutants were more susceptible than the matched wild type strain. our results show that the chitosan preparation details are critically important in identifying the antibacterial features that target different test organisms.

TI  == screening of australian plants for antimicrobial activity against campylobacter jejuni.
AB  == campylobacter jejuni is the most common cause of acute enteritis in humans, with  symptoms such as diarrhoea, fever and abdominal cramps. in this study, 115 extracts from 109 australian plant species were investigated for their antimicrobial activities against two c. jejuni strains using an in vitro broth microdilution assay. among the plants tested, 107 (93%) extracts showed activity  at a concentration between 32 and 1024 microg/ml against at least one c. jejuni strain. seventeen plant extracts were selected for further testing against another six c. jejuni strains, as well as campylobacter coli, escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, bacillus cereus, proteus mirabilis and enterococcus faecalis. the extract from eucalyptus occidentalis demonstrated the highest antimicrobial activity, with an inhibitory concentration of 32 microg/ml against  c. jejuni and b. cereus. this study has shown that extracts of selected australian plants possess antimicrobial activity against c. jejuni and thus may have application in the control of this organism in live poultry and retail poultry products.

TI  == antibacterial peptides derived from caprine whey proteins, by digestion with human gastrointestinal juice.
AB  == peptides in caprine whey were identified after in vitro digestion with human gastrointestinal enzymes in order to determine their antibacterial effect. the digestion was performed in two continuing steps using human gastric juice (ph 2.5) and human duodenal juice (ph 8) at 37 degrees c. after digestion the hydrolysate was fractionated and 106 peptides were identified. from these results, twenty-two peptides, located in the protein molecules, were synthesised  and antibacterial activity examined. strong activity of the hydrolysates was detected against escherichia coli k12, bacillus cereus rt inf01 and listeria monocytogenes, less activity against staphylococcus aureus atcc 25 923 and no effect on lactobacillus rhamnosus gg. the pure peptides showed less antibacterial effect than the hydrolysates. when comparing the peptide sequences from human gastrointestinal enzymes with previously identified peptides from non-human enzymes, only two peptides, beta-lactoglobulin f(92-100) and beta-casein f(191-205) matched. no peptides corresponded to the antibacterial caprine lactoferricin f(14-42) or lactoferrampin c f(268-284). human gastrointestinal enzymes seem to be more complex and have different cleavage points in their protein chains compared with purified non-human enzymes. multiple sequence alignment of nineteen peptides showed proline-rich sequences, neighbouring leucines, resulting in a consensus sequence ltpvpelk. in such a way proline and leucine may restrict further proteolytic processing. the present study showed that human gastrointestinal enzymes generated different peptides from caprine whey compared with non-human enzymes and a stronger antibacterial effect of the hydrolysates than the pure peptides was shown. antimicrobial activity against pathogens but not against probiotics indicate a possible host-protective activity of whey.

TI  == identification and safety evaluation of bacillus species occurring in high numbers during spontaneous fermentations to produce gergoush, a traditional sudanese bread snack.
AB  == gergoush is a naturally fermented sudanese bread snack produced in three fermentation steps (primary starter, adapted starter and final dough), followed by three baking steps for a half to one hour at above 200 degrees c. this study examines the microbiota of two sets of fermentations performed at a traditional production site in khartoum, sudan in 2006 and 2009, respectively. in 2006 four different milk/legume based primary starters (faba bean, chick pea, lentil and white bean) were sampled in order to enumerate and identify the bacillus at species or group level. in 2009 specific focus was on the enumeration and safety  evaluation of the dominant bacillus cereus group species occurring during various gergoush productions (including the three fermentations steps and after baking).  in 2006, the primary starters contained bacillus spp. in the order of between 7.7 and 8.1 log(10) cfu/g. species identifications were performed by m13-pcr typing using the escherichia coli phage m13 derived primer pm13 combined with internally transcribed 16-23s rrna pcr, 16s rrna gene and gyra or gyrb gene sequencing, and  selected phenotypic tests. depending on the legume used, 40-68% of the isolates were identified as b. cereus sensu lato, 16-27% as bacillus licheniformis, 8-32%  as bacillus subtilis and 4-20% as bacillus sonorensis. during the second set of fermentation trials performed in 2009, the bacillus spp. and b. cereus occurred in numbers of between 7.7-9.9 and 6.1-7.8 log(10) cfu/g, respectively, while no bacteria were detected after baking. a total of 180 b. cereus sensu lato isolates from four different primary starters, adapted starters and final doughs were further identified as b. cereus sensu stricto (118 isolates) and bacillus thuringiensis (62 isolates). the safety of gergoush was evaluated based on the counts and toxin gene profiles of the dominant b. cereus species. considering that no bacteria survived the baking process, and that the cereulide synthetase gene cesb involved in the production of the heat stable emetic toxin cereulide was not detected in any of the investigated b. cereus isolates, the results indicate, that gergoush produced at the traditional production site is safe for human consumption. this study is the first to identify the bacillus of gergoush to species level, and it is the first to perform a safety evaluation of the product, based on the dominant b. cereus species.

TI  == substrate specificity of spoiiga, a signal-transducing aspartic protease in bacilli.
AB  == spoiiga is a novel type of membrane-associated aspartic protease that responds to a signal from the forespore by cleaving pro-sigma(e) in the mother cell during sporulation of bacillus subtilis. very little is known about how spoiiga recognizes pro-sigma(e). by co-expressing proteins in escherichia coli, it was shown that charge reversal substitutions for acidic residues 24 and 25 of pro-sigma(e), and for basic residues 245 and 284 of spoiiga, impaired cleavage. these results are consistent with a model predicting possible electrostatic interactions between these residues; however, no charge reversal substitution for residue 245 or residue 284 of spoiiga restored cleavage of pro-sigma(e) with a charge reversal substitution for residue 24 or residue 25. bacillus subtilis spoiiga cleaved pro-sigma(e) orthologs from bacillus licheniformis and bacillus halodurans, but not from bacillus cereus. a triple substitution in the pro-sequence of b. cereus pro-sigma(e) allowed cleavage by b. subtilis spoiiga, indicating that residues distal from the cleavage site contribute to substrate specificity. co-expression of spoiiga and pro-sigma(e) orthologs in different combinations suggested that b. licheniformis spoiiga has a relatively narrow substrate specificity as compared with b. subtilis spoiiga, whereas b. cereus spoiiga and b. halodurans spoiiga appear to have broader substrate specificity.

TI  == hot water surface pasteurisation of lamb carcasses: microbial effects and cost-benefit considerations.
AB  == although hot water pasteurisation of carcasses is accepted as a general intervention in usa, this is not the case in europe. the aims of this study were  (i) to evaluate the microbiological effects of hot water pasteurisation of lamb carcasses, both after slaughtering and dressing and following subsequent chilling and storage; (ii) to discuss hot water pasteurisation from a public health and cost-benefit perspective; (iii) to discuss the benefits of hot water pasteurisation compared with use of separate meat processing streams for high-risk carcasses; (iv) to evaluate the use of recycled hot water in a hygienic context and in relation to eu regulations; and (v) to consider the technological  and sensory aspects of hot water pasteurisation of lamb carcasses. samples were collected from 420 naturally contaminated lamb carcasses, with 50% of the carcasses (n=210) subject to hot water pasteurisation at 82 degrees c for 8s immediately after slaughter. surface swab samples from 4500 cm(2) areas on carcasses were collected at slaughter, after chilling for 24 h, and after chilling for five days. the microbial analyses included escherichia coli, enterobacteriaceae, bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens and aerobic plate count (apc). a resuscitation step using tryptone soya agar was included in the microbiological analyses. hot water pasteurisation significantly reduced the levels of e. coli, enterobacteriaceae, b. cereus and apc (all p<0.001). e. coli colony forming unit (cfu) reduction was 99.5%, corresponding to a reduction of 1.85 log cfu per carcass. e. coli was isolated from 66% of control carcasses and  from 26% of pasteurised carcasses. after 24h storage, the reduction in e. coli was increased to 2.02 log, and after five days e. coli could not be isolated from the pasteurised carcasses. these results suggest that surface pasteurisation could be an important and efficient procedure (critical control point) for reducing generic e. coli and thereby shiga toxin-producing e. coli on carcasses,  and thus the risk for disease among consumers. the recycled water had acceptable  physical and chemical parameters and no spore-forming bacteria were detected. although some carcass discolouration was observed, after 24h the colour was acceptable. our data provide relevant input for some of the data gaps regarding hot water pasteurisation and indicate that replacing the expensive system of separate processing of high-risk carcasses with hot water surface pasteurisation  should be considered as a serious option.

TI  == a flagellin-producing lactococcus strain: interactions with mucin and enteropathogens.
AB  == bacillus cereus ch is a probiotic strain used in human nutrition whose adhesion to mucin is dependent on its surface-associated flagellin. flagellins from the surface of several probiotic bacillus strains were efficiently extracted with 5 m licl and identified by peptide fingerprinting. based on the proteomic analysis, cloning of the gene coding for the flagellin of b. cereus ch was performed in the lactococcal vector pnz8110 under the control of a nisin-inducible promoter. the resulting strain, lactococcus lactis ch, produced a surface-associated flagellin  after 6 h of induction with nisin. the recombinant lactococcus strain adhered strongly to mucin-coated polystyrene plates, whilst inhibiting competitively the  adhesion of the pathogens escherichia coli lmg2092 and salmonella enterica ssp. enterica lmg15860 to the same molecule. strain ch could be used in further experimentation for the characterization of the molecular mechanism of action of  this probiotic b. cereus ch flagellin.

TI  == isolation and characterization of cold-active family viii esterases from an arctic soil metagenome.
AB  == functional screening for lipolytic enzymes at low temperatures resulted in the isolation of the novel cold-active esterases, estm-n1 and estm-n2, from a metagenomic dna library of arctic soil samples. estm-n1 and estm-n2 were 395 and  407 amino acids in length, respectively, and showed the highest similarity to class c beta-lactamases. however, they shared a relatively low level of sequence  similarity (30%) with each other. phylogenetic analysis of bacterial lipolytic enzymes confirmed that estm-n1 and estm-n2 belonged to family viii of bacterial esterases/lipases. the (his)(6)-tagged esterases were purified to about 99% homogeneity from the soluble fraction of recombinant escherichia coli cultures. the purified estm-n1 and estm-n2 retained more than 50% of maximal activity in the temperature range of 0-35 degrees c, with optimal temperatures of 20 degrees  c and 30 degrees c, respectively. both enzymes preferred the short acyl chains of p-nitrophenyl esters and exhibited very narrow substrate specificity, indicating  that they are typical esterases. the beta-lactamase activity of estm-n1 and estm-n2 was also detected and reached about 31% and 13% of the positive control enzyme, bacillus cereus beta-lactamase, respectively. these first cold-active esterases belonging to family viii are expected to be useful for potential biotechnological applications as interesting biocatalysts.

TI  == inhibitory spectra and modes of antimicrobial action of gallotannins from mango kernels (mangifera indica l.).
AB  == this study investigated the antimicrobial activities and modes of action of penta-, hexa-, hepta-, octa-, nona-, and deca-o-galloylglucose (gallotannins) isolated from mango kernels. the mics and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) against food-borne bacteria and fungi were determined using a critical dilution assay. gram-positive bacteria were generally more susceptible to gallotannins than were gram-negative bacteria. the mics of gallotannins against bacillus subtilis, bacillus cereus, clostridium botulinum, campylobacter jejuni,  listeria monocytogenes, and staphylococcus aureus were 0.2 g liter(-1) or less; enterotoxigenic escherichia coli and salmonella enterica were inhibited by 0.5 to 1 g liter(-1), and lactic acid bacteria were resistant. the use of lipopolysaccharide mutants of s. enterica indicated that the outer membrane confers resistance toward gallotannins. supplementation of lb medium with iron eliminated the inhibitory activity of gallotannins against staphylococcus aureus, and siderophore-deficient mutants of s. enterica were less resistant toward gallotannins than was the wild-type strain. hepta-o-galloylglucose sensitized lactobacillus plantarum tmw1.460 to hop extract, indicating inactivation of hop resistance mechanisms, e.g., the multidrug resistance (mdr) transporter hora. carbohydrate metabolism of lactococcus lactis mg1363, a conditionally respiring organism, was influenced by hepta-o-galloylglucose when grown under aerobic conditions and in the presence of heme but not under anaerobic conditions, indicating that gallotannins influence the respiratory chain. in conclusion, the  inhibitory activities of gallotannins are attributable to their strong affinity for iron and likely additionally relate to the inactivation of membrane-bound proteins.

TI  == the effect of lemongrass oil and its major components on clinical isolate mastitis pathogens and their mechanisms of action on staphylococcus aureus dmst 4745.
AB  == the aims of this study were to investigate the antibacterial activity of lemongrass oil (lg) and its major components which were citral, geraniol and myrcene, against four strains of clinically isolated bovine mastitis pathogens, including staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, bacillus cereus and escherichia coli by the broth microdilution method, as well as their activity on  s. aureus biofilm formation. attempts to clarify their mechanisms of action by investigation of the effects on intracellular material leakage and morphological  changes of s. aureus dmst 4745 were also made. the results demonstrate that s. agalactiae and b. cereus are more susceptible to lg, citral and geraniol than s.  aureus and e. coli. moreover, they also inhibit s. aureus biofilm formation and exhibit effective killing activities on preformed biofilms. the lg appears to have multiple targets in the bacterial cell, depending on concentration used as well as the amount of its components.

AB  == this study was performed to evaluate the effects of korean propolis against foodborne pathogens and spores of bacillus cereus and to investigate the antimicrobial activity against b. cereus structure by transmission electron microscopy (tem). the antimicrobial effects of the korean propolis were tested against foodborne pathogens including gram-positive (b. cereus, listeria monocytogenes and staphylococcus aureus) and gram-negative (salmonella typhimurium, escherichia coli and pseudomonas fluorescence) bacteria by agar diffusion assay. gram-positive bacteria were more sensitive than were gram-negative bacteria. the vegetative cells of b. cereus were the most sensitive among the pathogens tested with minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of 0.036 mg/mul of propolis on agar medium. based on mic, sensitivity of vegetative cells  of b. cereus and its spores was tested in a nutrient broth with different concentrations of propolis at 37 degrees c. in liquid broth, treatment with 1.8 mg/ml propolis showed bactericidal effect against b. cereus. b. cereus vegetative cells exposed to 7.2mg/ml of propolis lost their viability within 20 min. against spores of b. cereus, propolis inhibited germination of spores up to 30 hours, compared to control at higher concentration than vegetative cells yet acted sporostatically. the bactericidal and sporostatic action of propolis were dependent on the concentration of propolis used and treatment time. electron microscopic investigation of propolis-treated b. cereus revealed substantial structural damage at the cellular level and irreversible cell membrane rupture at a number of locations with the apparent leakage of intracellular contents. the antimicrobial effect of propolis in this study suggests potential use of propolis in foods.

TI  == isolation and identification of soil bacteria growing at the expense of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi.
AB  == soil-microorganism symbioses are of fundamental importance for plant adaptation to the environment. research in microbial ecology has revealed that some soil bacteria are associated with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (amf). however, these interactions may be much more complex than originally thought. to assess the type of bacteria associated with amf, we initially isolated spores of glomus irregulare from an agrostis stolonifera rhizosphere. the spores were washed with  sterile water and plated onto g. irregulare mycelium growing in vitro in a root-free compartment of bicompartmented petri dishes. we hypothesized that this  system should select for bacteria closely associated with the fungus because the  only nutrients available to the bacteria were those derived from the hyphae. twenty-nine bacterial colonies growing on the amf hyphae were subcultured and identified using 16s rrna gene sequences. all bacterial isolates showed high sequence identity to bacillus cereus, bacillus megaterium, bacillus simplex, kocuria rhizophila, microbacterium ginsengisoli, sphingomonas sp. and variovorax  paradoxus. we also assessed bacterial diversity on the surface of spores by pcr-denaturating gradient gel electrophoresis. finally, we used live cellular imaging to show that the bacteria isolated can grow on the surface of hyphae with different growing patterns in contrast to escherichia coli as a control.

TI  == synergistic effects of sodium hypochlorite and ultraviolet radiation in reducing  the levels of selected foodborne pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to determine whether combined treatment would produce synergistic effects to facilitate the sterilization of food products during production relative to single treatment. to assess this hypothesis, we investigated the bactericidal effects of ultraviolet (uv) irradiation and a commercial chemical disinfectant, sodium hypochlorite (naclo), on bacillus cereus f4810/72, cronobacter sakazakii kctc 2949, staphylococcus aureus atcc 35556, escherichia coli atcc 10536, and salmonella typhimurium novobiocin/nalidixic acid in vitro. various concentrations of naclo (20, 60, 100, and 200 ppm naclo) were tested along with exposure to uv radiation at various doses (6, 96, 216, 360, and 504 mw s/cm(2)). the combined naclo/uv treatments resulted in greater reductions  in bacterial counts than either treatment alone. the synergy values against b. cereus, c. sakazakii, s. aureus, salmonella typhimurium, and e. coli were 0.25-1.17, 0.33-1.97, 0.42-1.72, 0.02-1.44, and 0.01-0.85 log(10) cfu/ml, respectively. the results of this study suggest that a significant synergistic benefit results from combined naclo/uv processing against food-borne pathogenic bacteria in vitro.

TI  == bacteria adsorption on hydrophilic surfaces for the sensitive detection of pathogenic bacteria using a single tube chamber system.
AB  == here, we developed a simple and effective bacterial isolation method that can be  directly used for the detection of pathogenic bacteria. this approach only requires a single plastic tube chamber that can performing serial processes such  as cell gathering, cell lysis, nucleic acid amplification, and signaling without  the need to transfer samples from one chamber to another. a teos (tetraethoxysilane) surface was selected for this application because of its superior performance in the amplification process as well as the ability of bacteria to adsorb to its surface, which is necessary for all processes to be performed in single chamber. the optimal aquatic buffer conditions for bacteria adsorption on the hydrophilic surface were determined to be 1% polyethylene glycerol (peg) and 10 mm mgcl(2) in 100 mm phosphate at ph 4 for the gram negative bacteria, escherichia coli o157:h7 (e. coli o157:h7) and 10 mm na(2)so(4) in 100 mm phosphate in 100 mm phosphate at ph 4 for the gram positive  bacteria, bacillus cereus (b. cereus). when these divalent cation and anion (mgso(4)) containing acidic solutions were used, 40% of both bacteria adsorbed onto the hydrophilic surface at a loading rate of 2 ml/min after introduction of  low concentrations of bacteria. this method was directly employed to detect e. coli o157:h7 in beef using a single plastic tube chamber that was partially filled with nickel micro beads coated with teos. in this system, e. coli o157:h7  were lysed by induction heating of the nickel micro beads. the extracted mrna was readily amplified and detected by adding an isothermal amplification mixture (nasba, nucleic acid sequence based amplification) containing a hair-loop type reporting probe with fam and dabcyl. as a result, this highly sensitive sensing tool could detect very low concentrations of e. coli [10(0) cfu/1 g of beef].

TI  == antimicrobial activities of 1,4-benzoquinones and wheat germ extract.
AB  == we evaluated the antibacterial activities of selected edible korean plant seeds against the food-borne pathogens staphylococcus aureus kctc1927, escherichia coli kctc2593, salmonella typhimurium kctc2054, and bacillus cereus kctc1014. while screening for antibacterial agents, we discovered that wheat germ extract contains 2,6-dimethoxy-1,4-benzoquinone (dmbq) and is highly inhibitory to s. aureus and b. cereus. this is the first report of the antibacterial activity of wheat germ extract. we also investigated the antibacterial activities of the 1,4- benzoquinone standards 1,4-benzoquinone (bq), hydroquinone (hq), methoxybenzoquinone (mbq), and 2,6-dimethoxy- 1,4-benzoquinone (dmbq). dmbq and bq were the most highly inhibitory to s. aureus and s. typhimurium, followed by mbq and hq. mics for dmbq and bq ranged between 8 and 64 microgram/ml against the four foodborne pathogens tested. dmbq and bq showed significant antibacterial activity; the most sensitive organism was s. aureus with an mic of 8 microgram/ml. bq exhibited good activity against s. typhimurium (32 microgram/ml) and b. cereus (32 microgram/ml). the results suggest that wheat germ extract has  potential for the development of natural antimicrobials and food preservatives for controlling foodborne pathogens.

TI  == hindering biofilm formation with zosteric acid.
AB  == the antifoulant, zosteric acid, was synthesized using a non-patented process. zosteric acid at 500 mg l(-1) caused a reduction of bacterial (escherichia coli,  bacillus cereus) and fungal (aspergillus niger, penicillium citrinum) coverage by 90% and 57%, respectively. calculated models allowed its antifouling activity to  be predicted at different concentrations. zosteric acid counteracted the effects  of some colonization-promoting factors. bacterial and fungal wettability was not  affected, but the agent increased bacterial motility by 40%. a capillary accumulation test showed that zosteric acid did not act as a chemoeffector for e. coli, but stimulated a chemotactic response. along with enhanced swimming migration of e. coli in the presence of zosteric acid, staining showed an increased production of flagella. reverse transcriptase-pcr revealed an increased transcriptional level of the flic gene and isolation and quantification of flagellar proteins demonstrated a higher flagellin amount. biofilm experiments confirmed that zosteric acid caused a significant decrease in biomass (-92%) and  thickness (-54%).

TI  == lycopersicon esculentum seeds: an industrial byproduct as an antimicrobial agent.
AB  == lycopersicon esculentum (tomato) fruit is a widely studied matrix. however, only  few works focus their attention on its seeds, which constitute a major byproduct  of the tomato processing industry. in this study the antimicrobial potential of ten different tomato seed extracts from "bull's heart" and "cherry" varieties were analyzed against gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, micrococcus luteus, enterococcus faecalis and bacillus cereus) and gram-negative (proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella typhimurium) bacteria and fungi (candida albicans, aspergillus fumigatus and trichophyton rubrum). regarding antibacterial capacity, the different extracts were revealed to be active only against gram-positive bacteria, e. faecalis being the most susceptible one (mic: 2.5-10 mg/ml). concerning antifungal activity, "bull's heart" extracts were the most active. in  a general way c. albicans was the most susceptible species (mic: 5-10 mg/ml). the chemical composition of the extracts was also pursued, concerning organic acids,  phenolics and fatty acids, in order to establish a possible relationship with the observed antimicrobial effect.

TI  == antibacterial & antiplasmid activities of helicteres isora l.
AB  == background & objectives: the multiple drug resistance (mdr) is a serious health problem and major challenge to the global drug discovery programmes. most of the  genetic determinants that confer resistance to antibiotics are located on r-plasmids in bacteria. the present investigation was undertaken to investigate the ability of organic extract of the fruits of helicteres isora to cure r-plasmids from certain clinical isolates. methods: active fractions demonstrating antibacterial and antiplasmid activities were isolated from the acetone extracts of shade dried fruits of h. isora by bioassay guided fractionation. minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) of antibiotics and organic  extracts was determined by agar dilution method. plasmid curing activity of organic fractions was determined by evaluating the ability of bacterial colonies  (pre treated with organic fraction for 18 h) to grow in the presence of antibiotics. the physical loss of plasmid dna in the cured derivatives was further confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis. results: the active fraction did not inhibit the growth of either the clinical isolates or the strains harbouring reference plasmids even at a concentration of 400 microg/ml. however,  the same fraction could cure plasmids from enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, bacillus cereus and e. coli (rp4) at curing efficiencies of 14, 26, 22 and  2 per cent respectively. the active fraction mediated plasmid curing resulted in  the subsequent loss of antibiotic resistance encoded in the plasmids as revealed  by antibiotic resistance profile of cured strains. the physical loss of plasmid was also confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis. interpretation & conclusions:  the active fraction of acetone extract of h. isora fruits cured r-plasmids from gram-positive and gram-negative clinical isolates as well as reference strains. such plasmid loss reversed the multiple antibiotic resistance in cured derivatives making them sensitive to low concentrations of antibiotics. acetone fractions of h. isora may be a source to develop antiplasmid agents of natural origin to contain the development and spread of plasmid borne multiple antibiotic resistance.

TI  == on-line separation of bacterial cells by carbon-electrode dielectrophoresis.
AB  == dielectrophoresis (dep) represents a powerful approach to manipulate and study living cells. hitherto, several approaches have used 2-d dep chips. with the aim  to increase sample volume, in this study we used a 3-d carbon-electrode dep chip  to trap and release bacterial cells. a continuous flow was used to plug an escherichia coli cell suspension first, to retain cells by positive dep, and thereafter to recover them by washing with peptone water washing solution. this approach allows one not only to analyze dep behavior of living cells within the chip, but also to further recover fractions containing dep-trapped cells. bacterial concentration and flow rate appeared as critical parameters influencing the separation capacity of the chip. evidence is presented demonstrating that the setup developed in this study can be used to separate different types of bacterial cells.

TI  == inactivation of food-borne spoilage and pathogenic micro-organisms on the surface of a photoactive polymer.
AB  == the photodynamic action of a novel photoactive polymer comprising covalently bound anthraquinone (aq) moieties was evaluated after developing a methodology to reliably immobilize viable micro-organisms onto polymer film surfaces. the survival of escherichia coli, bacillus cereus (vegetative cells and spores), fusarium oxysporum and saccharomyces cerevisiae microbes inoculated on the surface of inert polymeric substrates was assessed to determine the effect of inoculum composition, drying rate and exposure to ultraviolet (uv-a) radiation. their survival was highly dependent on microbial genus, with e. coli consistently displaying markedly shorter survival times than the other microbes, and b. cereus spores being the most resistant. inoculation of the microbes onto the surface of  the photoactive polymer films, followed by exposure to uv-a radiation, dramatically accelerated the inactivation of all microbial types studied compared with their survival on the surface of inert polymer substrates. simultaneous exposure to both oxygen and uv-a radiation is required to affect cell survival, which is consistent with this effect most likely originating from the photoinduced production of singlet oxygen by the photoactive polymer. these results provide further compelling evidence that singlet oxygen produced exogenously by this photoactive polymeric substrate can successfully inactivate a broad spectrum of microbes on the substrate's surface.

AB  == the antibacterial potential of essential oils and methanol extracts of sweet basil ocimum basilicum l. (lamiaceae) was evaluated for controlling the growth range of food-borne pathogenic bacteria. essential oils extracted by hydrodistillation from the leaves and stems were analyzed by gc-ms. fifty-seven compounds representing 94.9 and 96.1% of the total leaf and stem oils, respectively, were identified, of which methyl chavicol (36.7 and 29.9%), gitoxigenin (9.3 and 10.2%), trimethoquinol (10.3 and 8.4%), beta-guaiene (3.7 and 4.1%), aciphyllene (3.4 and 3.0%), alizarin (3.2 and 4.4%), naphthaline (2.2  and 3.8%), (-)-caryophyllene (2.0 and 1.9%), and mequinol (1.6 and 1.8%) were the major compounds. the essential oils (10 microl/disc of 1:5, v/v dilution with methanol) and methanol extracts (300 microg/disc) of o. basilicum displayed a great potential of antibacterial activity against bacillius cereus, b. subtilis,  b. megaterium, staphylococcus aureus, listeria monocytogenes, escherichia coli, shigella boydii, s. dysenteriae, vibrio parahaemolyticus, v. mimicus, and salmonella typhi with their respective zones of inhibition of 11.2-21.1 mm and mic values of 62.5-500 microg/ml. the results of this study suggest that the natural products derived from o. basilicum may have potential use in the food and/or pharmaceutical industries as antimicrobial agents.

TI  == specific and reversible immobilization of nadh oxidase on functionalized carbon nanotubes.
AB  == nanotechnology-inspired biocatalyst systems have attracted a lot of attention in  enzyme immobilization recently. theoretically, nanomaterials are ideal supporting materials because they can provide the upper limits on enzyme-efficiency-determining factors such as surface area/volume ratio, enzyme loading capacity and mass transfer resistance. however, common immobilization methods have limited the applicability of these biocatalysts owing to enzyme leaching, 3d structure loss, and strong diffusion resistance. expensive enzyme purification step is also required for these methods before immobilization. in this work, we show an efficient immobilization method based on specific interaction between his-tagged nadh oxidase and functionalized single-walled carbon nanotubes without requiring enzyme purification for immobilization. we cloned the annotated nadh oxidase gene from bacillus cereus genome and overexpressed with pet30 vector encoding n-terminal 6x his-tag. the his-tagged nadh oxidase was then immobilized onto single-walled carbon nanotubes functionalized with n(alpha),n(alpha)-bis(carboxymethyl)-l-lysine hydrate. the resulting nanoscale biocatalyst has overcome the foresaid limitations, and demonstrates good loading capacity and stability while maintaining 92% maximum activity of the native enzyme. we further demonstrate that the immobilization is  reversible and can retain ca. 92% activity for a couple of loading cycles.

TI  == lmbe proteins from bacillus cereus are de-n-acetylases with broad substrate specificity and are highly similar to proteins in bacillus anthracis.
AB  == the genomes of bacillus cereus and its closest relative bacillus anthracis each contain two lmbe protein family homologs: bc1534 (ba1557) and bc3461 (ba3524). only a few members of this family have been biochemically characterized including n-acetylglucosaminylphosphatidyl inositol (glcnac-pi), 1-d-myo-inosityl-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-alpha-d-glucopyranoside (glcnac-ins), n,n'-diacetylchitobiose (glcnac(2)) and lipoglycopeptide antibiotic de-n-acetylases. all these enzymes share a common feature in that they de-n-acetylate the n-acetyl-d-glucosamine (glcnac) moiety of their substrates. the bc1534 gene has previously been cloned and expressed in escherichia coli. the recombinant enzyme was purified and its 3d structure determined. in this study, the bc3461 gene from b. cereus atcc14579 was cloned and expressed in e. coli. the recombinant enzymes bc1534 (ec 3.5.1.-) and bc3461 were biochemically characterized. the enzymes have different molecular masses, ph and temperature optima and broad substrate specificity, de-n-acetylating glcnac and n-acetylchito-oligomers (glcnac(2), glcnac(3) and glcnac(4)), as well as glcnac-1p, n-acetyl-d-glucosamine-1 phosphate; glcnac-6p, n-acetyl-d-glucosamine-6 phosphate; galnac, n-acetyl-d-galactosamine; mannac, n-acetyl-d-mannosamine; udp-glcnac, uridine 5'-diphosphate n-acetyl-d-glucosamine. however, the enzymes were not active on radiolabeled glycol chitin, peptidoglycan from b. cereus, n-acetyl-d-glucosaminyl-(beta-1,4)-n-acetylmuramyl-l-alanyl-d-isoglutamine (gmdp) or n-acetyl-d-glcn-nalpha1-6-d-myo-inositol-1-hpo(4)-octadecyl (glcnac-i-p-c(18)). kinetic analysis of the activity of bc1534 and bc3461 on glcnac and glcnac(2) revealed that glcnac(2) is the favored substrate for both native enzymes. based on the recently determined crystal structure of bc1534, a mutational analysis identified functional key residues, highlighting their importance for the catalytic mechanism and the substrate specificity of the enzyme. the catalytic efficiencies of bc1534 variants were significantly decreased compared to the native enzyme. an alignment-based tree places both de-n-acetylases in functional categories that are different from those of other lmbe proteins.

TI  == cadmium chloride exhibits a profound toxic effect on bacterial microflora of the  mice gastrointestinal tract.
AB  == cadmium (cd(2)(+)), a naturally occurring heavy metal, is an important environmental pollutant and a potent toxicant to bacteria. the gastrointestinal (gi) tract microflora has a marked capacity to cope with the increased load of ingested metals. however, heavy metals may have harmful effects on git microflora. under the conditions of experimental exposure to cadmium, changes in  the population of intestinal microflora in healthy mice were examined. five experimental groups received 23 to 50 mg kg(-)(1) cadmium in drinking water and control group was given water free from cadmium for 45 days. intestinal contents  and biopsy samples were aseptically collected and bacterial counts were performed. the microflora of the intestine in control group was represented by bacteria of the genera bacillus cereus, lactobacillus spp., clostridium spp., escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., pseudomonas spp., enterococcus spp. and proteus spp. as the result of dysbiosis induced by the introduction of cadmium, a sharp decrease in the population of all microbial species in the intestine was observed. the deleterious effect of cadmium appeared to be less in the large intestine and rectum than that of small intestine, suggesting a site-specific influence of cadmium. the gram-negative bacteria tested were less sensitive to cadmium compared to the gram-positive bacteria because of their possible different ability to uptake the metal ions.

(family: meliaceae) is a well-known multi-purpose medicinal plant, and has been employed for a wide range of disease conditions without documented scientific data. in the current study, four pure isolated compounds, 3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl beta-d-glucopyranoside (1), turpinionoside a (2), (+)-lyoniresinol 3alpha-o-beta-d-glucopyranoside (3) and (-)-lyoniresinol 3alpha-o-beta-d-glucopyranoside (4), were isolated from the leaves and twigs of w. robusta. biological evaluation for free radical scavenging, antibacterial and  antigiardial activities was performed. we investigated antioxidant effects of the crude extracts as well as the isolated compounds using 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical (dpph), hydroxyl radical (oh), and superoxide anion (o(2)) scavenging assays. three phenolic glucosides (1, 3 and 4) were found to possess strong antioxidant activity. they scavenged dpph(*) with ic(50) values in the range of 51.5-86.6 microm. we also detected the superoxide dismutase-like activities in compounds 3 and 4 which are lignan glucosides, demonstrating potent superoxide scavenging activity with ic(50) values in the range of 0.8 and 0.7 microm, respectively. other biological activities including  antibacterial and antigiardial assays were carried out. preliminary results demonstrated that most extracts, except the diethyl ether extract, exhibited inhibition zones against all gram-positive bacteria including bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus mutans, and s. pyogenes. aqueous extracts of this plant species could inhibit gram-positive and some gram-negative bacteria such as escherichia coli, salmonella typhi and shigella sonnei. however, the determination of minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) of w. robusta on all tested bacterial strains  showed only weak activity, and their mbcs were greater than 25 mg ml(-1). for antigiardial activity, incubation with 2 x 10(5) trophozoites ml(-1) of the culture medium with the crude extracts at concentration ranged from 31.25 to 1000 microg ml(-1) demonstrated no activity (mic > 1000 microg ml(-1)).

TI  == novel 6,8-dibromo-4(3h)quinazolinone derivatives of anti-bacterial and anti-fungal activities.
AB  == starting from 4-(6,8-dibromo-2-phenyl-4-oxo-(4h)-quinazolin-3-yl)-benzoic acid ethyl ester (ii) and its acid hydrazide iii, a new series of schiff bases iv and  their cyclized products, thiazolidinones v, oxadiazole viii, pyrazoles x-xii, pyrroles xiii-xv and other related products were synthesized. these compounds were screened for their anti-bacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, legionella monocytogenes and bacillus cereus) and gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella typhimurium) and anti-fungal activity (candida albicans and aspergillus flavus) using paper disc diffusion technique. the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of the compounds were also determined by agar streak dilution method. among the synthesized compounds 2-(4-(2-phenyl-6,8-dibromo-4-oxo-(4h)quinazolin-3-yl)-n-ethylamido benzoic acid hydrazide viia was found to exhibits the most potent in vitro anti-microbial activity with the mics of 1.56, 3.125, 1.56, 25, 25 and 25 microg/ml against e. coli, s. typhimurium, l. monocytogenes, s. aureus, p. aeruginosa, and b. cereus respectively. compound 2-(4-(2-phenyl-6,8-dibromo-4-oxo-(4h)quinazolin-3-yl)-n-methyl thioamido benzoic  acid hydrazide viic was found to exhibit the most potent in vitro anti-fungal activity with mics 0.78 and 0.097 microg/ml against c. albicans and a. flavus.

TI  == phytochemical and biological investigations of elaeodendron schlechteranum.
AB  == aim of the study: elaeodendron schlechteranum (loes.) loes. is a shrub or tree belonging to the family celastraceae. in tanzania, in addition to ethnopharmacological claims in treating various non-infectious diseases, the root and stem bark powder is applied on septic wounds, and the leaf paste is used for  treatment of boils and carbuncles. the aim of this study was to identify the putative active constituents of the plant. materials and methods: dried and powdered root bark was extracted and subjected to bioassay-guided fractionation,  based on antibacterial, antiparasitic and anti-hiv activity. isolated compounds were identified by spectroscopic methods, and evaluated for biological activity.  results and conclusions: bioassay-guided isolation led to the identification of tingenin b (22beta-hydroxytingenone) as the main antibacterial constituent. it was active against bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli (ic(50)<0.25 microg/ml). furthermore, antiparasitic activity was observed against trypanosoma cruzi (ic(50)<0.25 microg/ml), trypanosoma brucei (<0.25 microg/ml),  leishmania infantum (0.51 microg/ml), and plasmodium falciparum (0.36 microg/ml). tingenin b was highly cytotoxic to mrc-5 cells (cc(50) 0.45 microg/ml), indicating a poor selectivity. two inactive triterpenes, 3beta,29-dihydroxyglutin-5-ene and cangoronine methyl ester were also obtained. phytochemical investigation of the anti-hiv active fractions led to the isolation and identification of three phenolic compounds, namely 4'-o-methylepigallocatechin, 4'-o-methylgallocatechin, and a new procyanidin dimer, i.e. 4',4'''-di-o-methyl-prodelphinidin b(4) or 4'-o-methylgallocatechin-(4alpha-->8)-4'-o-methylepigallocatechin. however, none  of these showed anti-hiv activity.

TI  == insertional mutagenesis reveals genes involved in bacillus cereus atcc 14579 growth at low temperature.
AB  == transposon mutagenesis of bacillus cereus atcc 14579 yielded cold-sensitive mutants. mutants of genes encoding enzymes of the central metabolism were affected by cold, but also by other stresses, such as ph or salt, whereas a mutant with transposon insertion in the promoter region of bc0259 gene, encoding  a putative dead-box rna helicase displaying homology with escherichia coli csda and bacillus subtilis csha rna helicases, was only cold-sensitive. expression of  the bc0259 gene at 10 degrees c is reduced in the mutant. analysis of the 5' untranslated region revealed the transcriptional start and putative cold shock-responsive elements. the role of this rna helicase in the cold-adaptive response of b. cereus is discussed.

TI  == [preparation of a 96-microwell plate dna diagnostic chip for detection of foodborne bacteria and its application in an incident of food poisoning].
AB  == objective: to develop a 96-microwell plate dna diagnostic chip for simultaneous detection of 9 major foodborne bacteria. methods: type-specific pcr primers labeled with biotin and oligonucleotide probes were designed according to the conservative genes of 9 major foodborne bacteria staphylococcus aureus, salmonella spp., escherichia coli o157:h7 (stx1 and stx2), shigella spp., listeria monocytogenes, bacillus cereus, yersinia enterocolitica, vibrio cholerae and vibrio parahaemolyticus. a one-tube multiplex pcr system for simultaneous amplification of these bacteria was established, and the dna probes were spotted  and immobilized in the wells of the plate in 5x5 array format. stable hybridization system between pcr products and oligonucleotide probes in the microwell was established after condition optimization. alkaline phosphatase-conjugated streptavidin and nbt/bcip were used to detect the hybridized pcr products. results: twenty standard bacteria strains were used to validate the 96 microwell plate dna diagnostic chip and highly specific and stable experiment results were obtained. using this chip assay, the causal pathogen staphylococcus aureus was identified within 12 h after the sampling from an incident of food poisoning, and the result was consistent with that obtained using conventional bacterial culture and biochemical identification. conclusion:  the novel 96 microwell plate dna diagnostic chip allows rapid, accurate, automated and high-throughput bacterial detection and is especially valuable for  quick response to such public health emergencies as food poisoning.

TI  == an assessment of the antibacterial activity in larval excretion/secretion of four species of insects recorded in association with corpses, using lucilia sericata meigen as the marker species.
AB  == the relative antibacterial activities of excretion/secretion (es) from two carrion-feeding insects, calliphora vicina robineau-desvoidy and dermestes maculatus degeer, and a detritivore, tenebrio molitor linnaeus, were compared to  that of lucilia sericata meigen, a species with es of known antibacterial capacity, in order to explore the antimicrobial potential of other carrion and detritivore species. viable counts were used to assess time-kill of es against five bacterial species, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, bacillus cereus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and proteus mirabilis. antibacterial activity was recorded in all four insect species although t. molitor and d. maculatus were the most effective in controlling growth of p. mirabilis. the blowflies were more effective in controlling a wider range of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. the larval es from all species was shown to reduce bacterial growth rate although differences in antibacterial spectrum were noted and the degree of  potency varied between the four species. these differences may be explained ecologically by the different colonisation times of each insect species on the corpse. overall, this study demonstrates that research into other carrion-feeding insect species has potential to provide an increased source of antimicrobial chemicals to broaden the range of bacterial species beyond that currently controlled using l. sericata.

TI  == synergistic effects of ethanol and uv radiation to reduce levels of selected foodborne pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to determine whether combined treatments would produce synergistic disinfection effects on food products during food processing  compared with single treatments. we investigated the bactericidal effects of a commercial chemical disinfectant (ethanol) and of uv radiation on bacillus cereus f4810/72, cronobacter sakazakii kctc 2949, staphylococcus aureus atcc 35556, escherichia coli atcc 10536, and salmonella enterica typhimurium no/na in vitro.  various concentrations of ethanol (10, 30, 40, and 50%) were tested with various  exposure doses of uv radiation (6, 96, 216, 360, and 504 mws/cm(2)) with a uv lamp. the combined ethanol-uv treatments resulted in greater reductions in bacterial counts than did either treatment alone. the synergistic effect values for b. cereus, c. sakazakii, s. aureus, s. enterica typhimurium no/na, and e. coli were 0.40 to 1.52, 0.52 to 1.74, 0.20 to 2.32, 0.07 to 1.14, and 0.02 to 1.75 log cfu/ml, respectively. the results of this study suggest that a significant synergistic benefit results from combining ethanol and uv treatments  against foodborne pathogens in vitro.

TI  == bacterial deoxyribonucleoside kinases are poor suicide genes in mammalian cells.
AB  == transfer of deoxyribonucleoside kinases (dnks) into cancer cells increases the activity of cytotoxic nucleoside analogues. it has been shown that bacterial dnks, when introduced into escherichia coli, sensitize this bacterium toward nucleoside analogues. we studied the possibility of using bacterial dnks, for example deoxyadenosine kinases (daks), to sensitize human cancer cells to gemcitabine. stable and transient transfections of bacterial dnks into human cells showed that these were much less active than human and fruitfly dnks. the fusion of dak from bacillus cereus to the green fluorescent protein induced a modest sensitization. apparently, bacterial dnks did not get properly expressed or are unstable in the mammalian cell.

TI  == evaluation of diffusion and dilution methods to determine the antibacterial activity of plant extracts.
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate diffusion and dilution methods for determining the antibacterial activity of plant extracts and their mixtures. several methods for measurement of the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) of  a plant extract are available, but there is no standard procedure as there is for antibiotics. we tested different plant extracts, their mixtures and phenolic acids on selected gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, and listeria monocytogenes) and gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella infantis, campylobacter jejuni, campylobacter coli) with the disk diffusion, agar dilution, broth microdilution and macrodilution methods. the disk diffusion method was appropriate only as a preliminary screening test prior to quantitative mic determination with dilution methods. a comparison of the results for mic obtained by agar dilution and broth microdilution was possible only for gram-positive bacteria, and indicated the latter as the most accurate way of assessing the antimicrobial effect. the microdilution method with ttc (2,3,5-triphenyl tetrazolium chloride) or int (2-p-iodophenyl-3-p-nitrophenyl-5-phenyl tetrazolium chloride) to indicate the viability of aerobic bacteria was found to be the best alternative approach, while only atp determination was appropriate for microaerophilic campylobacter spp. using survival curves the kinetics of bacterial inactivation on plant extract exposure was followed for 24h and in this way the mic values determined by the microdilution method were confirmed as the concentrations of extracts that inhibited bacterial growth. we suggest evaluation of the antibacterial activity of plant extracts using the broth microdilution method as a fast screening method for mic determination and the macrodilution method at selected mic values to confirm bacterial inactivation. campylobacter spp. showed a similar sensitivity to plant extracts as the tested gram-positive bacteria, but s. infantis and e. coli o157:h7 were more resistant.

TI  == the swaposin-like domain of potato aspartic protease (stasp-psi) exerts antimicrobial activity on plant and human pathogens.
AB  == plant-specific insert domain (psi) is a region of approximately 100 amino acid residues present in most plant aspartic protease (ap) precursors. psi is not a true saposin domain; it is the exchange of the n- and c-terminal portions of the  saposin like domain. hence, psi is called a swaposin domain. here, we report the  cloned, heterologous expression and purification of psi from stasp 1 (solanum tuberosum aspartic protease 1), called stasp-psi. results obtained here show that stasp-psi is able to kill spores of two potato pathogens in a dose-dependent manner without any deleterious effect on plant cells. as reported for staps (s. tuberosum aspartic proteases), the stasp-psi ability to kill microbial pathogens  is dependent on the direct interaction of the protein with the microbial cell wall/or membrane, leading to increased permeability and lysis. additionally, we demonstrated that, like proteins of the saplip family, stasp-psi and staps are cytotoxic to gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria in a dose dependent manner. the amino acid residues conserved in sp_b (pulmonary surfactant protein b) and stasp-psi could explain the cytotoxic activity exerted by stasp-psi and staps against gram-positive bacteria. these results and data previously reported suggest that the presence of the psi domain in mature staps could be related to their antimicrobial activity.

TI  == antibacterial activity of carvacrol and 2-nitro-1-propanol against single and mixed populations of foodborne pathogenic bacteria in corn flour dough.
AB  == cereal doughs are an important part of human diet, but at the same time can act as vehicles for the transmission of human pathogenic bacteria. in the present study, four pathogenic or toxinogenic bacteria (escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis, bacillus cereus and staphylococcus aureus) were inoculated in a dough made from corn flour in combination with the single antimicrobial compounds carvacrol and 2-nitro-1-propanol (2npoh). survival of single and mixed populations in the treated doughs incubated at 37 degrees c was followed by culture-dependent and independent methods (ttge). all strains were completely inactivated within 24 h by the tested compounds at 5% final concentration, but showed variable inhibition at lower concentrations of 0.5% and 2%. sensitivity to antimicrobial compounds was in general modified when strains were tested in cocultures compared with single cultures. b. cereus was more sensitive to carvacrol (minimum bactericidal concentration, mbc, 0.5%) in coculture with s. aureus. it was also more sensitive to 2npoh in cocultures with  s. aureus and with s. enterica (mbc, 2% in both cases). s. aureus was more resistant to carvacrol (mbc, 5%) in cocultures with b. cereus, e. coli, as well as s. enterica. however, sensitivity to 2npoh was not modified in any of the coculture experiments (mbc, 2%). e. coli was more resistant to carvacrol (mbc, 5%) in cocultures with s. aureus and with s. enterica. resistance of e. coli to 2npoh also increased in cocultures with b. cereus (mbc, 5%) and with s. aureus (mbc, 2%), but not with s. enterica (mbc, 0.5%). s. enterica was more resistant to carvacrol (mbc, 5%) in cocultures with e. coli, but it was more sensitive to 2npoh in cocultures with b. cereus as well as with s. aureus (mbc, 2% in both cases). ttge analysis of survivors from cocultures treated with 2npoh or carvacrol allowed a good estimation of the identity of survivors according to their dna band patterns. results from this study indicate that the efficacy of antimicrobials such as carvacrol and 2npoh is greatly influenced by the complexity of the microbial populations under target and the relationships between individual populations.

AB  == the antimicrobial activities of edible coatings based on a tapioca starch/decolorized hsian-tsao leaf gum (dhg) matrix with various green tea extracts (gtes) were evaluated. its effect on the shelf-life extension of fruit-based salads, romaine hearts, and pork slices were investigated as well. three types of gtes from hot water (80 degrees c) (w), 40% (e4) and 80% (e8) ethanol were prepared. it was found that all gtes showed pronounced inhibition on gram positive bacteria in agar media, including staphylococcus aureus bcrc 10781, bacillus cereus bcrc 11778 and listeria monocytogenes bcrc 14848, but not on gram negative bacteria, such as escherichia coli dh10beta and salmonella enteria bcrc  10747. the antimicrobial activities increased with increasing gtes concentration  (1, 2 and 5%), but did not differentiate significantly in terms of the effect of  extraction solvents. when various gtes (1%) were added to an edible coating formulation based on 1.35% tapioca starch +0.15% dhg +0.225% glycerol, pronounced antimicrobial activity on gram positive bacteria was also observed as evaluated by using cylinder diffusion and antimicrobial migration tests. it was believed that the active compounds in green tea extracts could leave the coating matrix and migrate to increase the non-growth area. when being sprayed on various real food models, all tapioca starch/dhg coatings containing gtes could successfully reduce the aerobic counting and growth of yeasts/molds by 1 to 2 log cycles in fruit-based salads, as compared to the control sample. furthermore, during refrigerated storage of romaine hearts and pork slices for 48h, tapioca starch/dhg coatings with e4 extracts demonstrated pronounced antimicrobial activity against gram positive bacteria (4-6 log cycles reduction), followed by w extracts and e8 extracts in a decreasing order. such results implied the high efficacy of antimicrobial migration of tapioca starch/dhg coatings containing gtes and their application potentials on foods.

TI  == designed low amphipathic peptides with alpha-helical propensity exhibiting antimicrobial activity via a lipid domain formation mechanism.
AB  == although several low amphipathic peptides have been known to exhibit antimicrobial activity, their mode of action has not been completely elucidated.  in this study, using designed low amphipathic peptides that retain different alpha-helical content and hydrophobicity, we attempted to investigate the mechanism of these properties. calorimetric and thermodynamic analyses demonstrated that the peptides induce formation of two lipid domains in an anionic liposome at a high peptide-to-lipid ratio. on the other hand, even at a low peptide-to-lipid ratio, they caused minimal membrane damage, such as flip-flop of membrane lipids or leakage of calcein molecules from liposomes, and  never translocated across membranes. interaction energies between the peptides and anionic liposomes showed good correlation with antimicrobial activity for both escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis. we thus propose that the domain formation mechanism in which antimicrobial peptides exhibit activity solely by forming lipid domains without membrane damage is a major determinant of the antimicrobial activity of low amphipathic peptides. these peptides appear to stiffen the membrane such that it is deprived of the fluidity necessary for biological functions. we also showed that to construct the lipid domains, peptides need not form stable and cooperative structures. rather, it is essential for peptides to only interact tightly with the membrane interface via strong electrostatic interactions, and slight differences in binding strength are invoked by differences in hydrophobicity. the peptides thus designed might pave the way for "clean" antimicrobial reagents that never cause release of membrane elements and efflux of their inner components.

TI  == single chain variable fragment antibodies selected by phage display against the sporozoite surface antigen s16 of cryptosporidium parvum.
AB  == two human single chain variable fragment (scfv) libraries were used to select clones that bound to the surface glycoprotein s16 of cryptosporidium parvum. panning of the tomlinson libraries i and j resulted in the isolation of nine distinct clones. of the four clones which had full-length scfv, three contained stop codons. the remaining five clones were truncated, with four missing the heavy chain, and one missing most of the light chain. the full-length clones exhibited better binding to native c. parvum proteins and recombinant s16 than the truncated clones, with the exception of one truncated clone. none of the selected clones cross-reacted with giardia lamblia, escherichia coli, streptococcus pyogenes, listeria monocytogenes, bacillus cereus or another immunogenic target of c. parvum, p23. clones expressed as the soluble scfv-giiip  construct were able to detect c. parvum native proteins and sporozoites. panning  from naive libraries was an useful method for isolation and identification of recombinant antibodies that have the potential for use in pathogen detection and  immunotherapy.

TI  == analysis of the antimicrobial activity of propolis and lysozyme in semisolid emulsion systems.
AB  == propolis as an active natural substance is attractive due to its antimicrobial and antimycotic properties. lysozyme was added to semisolid dermatological preparations as a complementary substance capable of potentiating their antimicrobial and antimycotic effect; this substance has been used for several decades as a preservative in food industry. the aim of this study was to model a  semisolid emulsion system (o/w) for cutaneous use with moisturizing and antimicrobial properties, where the active substances would be propolis and/or lysozyme. the microbiological examination was performed under aseptic conditions. the microbiological examination was aimed at determining the antimicrobial efficacy of the studied preparation in the solid growth media using the wells technique. the results of the antimicrobial assay showed that the effectiveness of propolis against the growth of s. aureus was intensified by the lysozyme introduced into the emulsion systems. in addition to that, the results of examinations showed that the active substance propolis in emulsion systems more efficiently inhibited spore bacteria (bacillus cereus) than lysozyme did, yet lysozyme had a more pronounced antimycotic (against candida albicans) effect, compared to propolis. all studied cream samples inhibited the growth of gram-negative microorganisms (escherichia coli). the results of this study suggest that the application of propolis and lysozyme as the active substances may increase the antimycotic and antibacterial effect of the studied preparations.

TI  == enhancing atp-based bacteria and biofilm detection by enzymatic pyrophosphate regeneration.
AB  == the manufacturing processes of many electronic and medical products demand the use of high-quality water. hence the water supply systems for these processes are required to be examined regularly for the presence of microorganisms and microbial biofilms. among commonly used bacteria detection approaches, the atp luminescence assay is a rapid, sensitive, and easy to perform method. the aim of  this study is to investigate whether atp regeneration from inorganic pyrophosphate, a product of the atp luminescence assay, can stabilize the bioluminescence signals in atp detection. adpglc pyrophosphorylase (agppase), which catalyzes the synthesis of atp from pp(i) in the presence of adpglc, was selected because the system yields much lower luminescence background than the commercially available atp sulfurylase/adenosine 5'-phosphosulfate (aps) system which was broadly used in pyrosequencing technology. the agppase-based assay could be used to measure both pp(i) and atp quantitatively and shows 1.5- to 4.0-fold slight increases in a 10-min assay. the method could also be used to stabilize the luminescence signals in detection of escherichia coli, pseudomonas  aeruginosa, and bacillus cereus in either broth or biofilm. these findings suggest that the agppase-based atp regeneration system will find many practical applications such as detection of bacterial biofilm in water pipelines.

TI  == photodynamic antimicrobial activity of avian eggshell pigments.
AB  == pigmentation in avian eggshells appears to be associated with shell strength, temperature regulation, and camouflage. the pigments found in eggshells are mainly porphyrins, which have been utilized therapeutically as photosensitizers.  here, we examined the photoinactivation of gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus,  bacillus cereus) and gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, salmonella enteritidis) by hen eggshells and their pigments. the results indicated that eggshells have a light-dependent antimicrobial activity against gram-positive, but not gram-negative, bacteria. our results indicate the possibility that the natural pigments used therapeutically have evolved in nature as a defence system.

TI  == a pilot study of the microbiological quality of culturally diverse, ready-to-eat  foods from selected retail establishments in melbourne, australia.
AB  == in recent years, there has been an increasing number of foodborne outbreaks linked to the consumption of culturally diverse foods. this appears to be because of the increasing quantity of culturally diverse foods available and a preference to store these foods, some of which are considered potentially hazardous, at ambient temperature. this practice may contravene temperature requirements defined by the food standards code. a lack of understanding of the hazardous nature of some culturally prepared foods also poses difficulties in applying the  australian food safety legislation by regulators. this pilot study examined the normal microbiota of four culturally diverse foods: nem chua, che dau trang, kueh talam, and banh tet nhan man, which are traditionally stored and consumed at ambient temperature. challenge testing was conducted to investigate the ability of these foods to support the growth of foodborne bacterial pathogens. two of the products (kueh talam and che dau) were found to be microbiologically unsatisfactory because of the high standard plate counts. challenge testing indicated that kueh talam, che dau, and banh tet nhan man were able to support the growth of bacillus cereus, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, and salmonella (1-2 log increases over 6 hours at 25 degrees c), suggesting that these foods may require temperature control during storage. however, nem chua was unable to support the growth of test bacteria, probably because of its acidic nature (ph 4.5), suggesting that ambient storage of this food may be safe. this study provided some preliminary evidence to support the need for further sampling and challenge testing of these products.

TI  == examination of genome homogeneity in prokaryotes using genomic signatures.
AB  == background: dna word frequencies, normalized for genomic at content, are remarkably stable within prokaryotic genomes and are therefore said to reflect a  "genomic signature." the genomic signatures can be used to phylogenetically classify organisms from arbitrary sampled dna. genomic signatures can also be used to search for horizontally transferred dna or dna regions subjected to special selection forces. thus, the stability of the genomic signature can be used as a measure of genomic homogeneity. the factors associated with the stability of the genomic signatures are not known, and this motivated us to investigate further. we analyzed the intra-genomic variance of genomic signatures based on at content normalization (0(th) order markov model) as well as genomic signatures normalized by smaller dna words (1(st) and 2(nd) order markov models)  for 636 sequenced prokaryotic genomes. regression models were fitted, with intra-genomic signature variance as the response variable, to a set of factors representing genomic properties such as genomic at content, genome size, habitat, phylum, oxygen requirement, optimal growth temperature and oligonucleotide usage  variance (ouv, a measure of oligonucleotide usage bias), measured as the variance between genomic tetranucleotide frequencies and markov chain approximated tetranucleotide frequencies, as predictors. principal findings: regression analysis revealed that ouv was the most important factor (p<0.001) determining intra-genomic homogeneity as measured using genomic signatures. this means that the less random the oligonucleotide usage is in the sense of higher ouv, the more homogeneous the genome is in terms of the genomic signature. the other factors influencing variance in the genomic signature (p<0.001) were genomic at content,  phylum and oxygen requirement. conclusions: genomic homogeneity in prokaryotes is intimately linked to genomic gc content, oligonucleotide usage bias (ouv) and aerobiosis, while oligonucleotide usage bias (ouv) is associated with genomic gc  content, aerobiosis and habitat.

TI  == analysis of the involvement of chitin-binding domain of chicw in antifungal activity, and engineering a novel chimeric chitinase with high enzyme and antifungal activities.
AB  == an antifungal chitinase, chicw, produced by bacillus cereus 28-9 is effective against conidial germination of botrytis elliptica, the causal agent of lily leaf blight. chicw as a modular enzyme consists of a signal peptide, a catalytic domain, a fibronectin type-iii-like domain, and a chitin-binding domain. when two c-terminal domains of chicw were truncated, chicwdeltafc (lacking the chitin-binding domain and fibronectin type iii-like domain) lost its antifungal activity. since chicwdeltaac (lacking the chitin-binding domain) could not be expressed in escherichia coli as chicwdeltafc did, a different strategy based on  protein engineering technology was designed to investigate the involvement of the chitin-binding domain of chicw (chbd(chicw)) in antifungal activity in this study. because chia1 of bacillus circulans wl-12 is a modular enzyme with a higher hydrolytic activity than chicw but not inhibitory to conidial germination  of bo. elliptica and the similar domain composition of chia1 and chicw, the c-terminal truncated derivatives of chia1 were generated and used to construct chimeric chitinases with chbd(chicw). when the chitin-binding domain of chia1 was replaced with chbd(chicw), the chimeric chitinase named chiaaaw exhibited both high enzyme activity and antifungal activity. the results indicate that chbd(chicw) may play an important role in the antifungual activity of chicw.

TI  == assessment of microbiological quality of sachet-packaged drinking water in western nigeria and its public health significance.
AB  == objective: to assess the microbiological quality of sachet-packaged drinking water in western nigeria and its impact on public health. study design: cross-sectional microbiological testing. methods: ninety-two sachet-packaged water samples were analysed for microbiological and metal qualities. total bacterial and coliform counts were determined, and the presence of escherichia coli, an important water quality indicator, was tested. the level of conformity of the water processors with the guidelines of nigeria's quality regulatory agency was also determined. results: varying levels of microbial contamination were recorded in samples from the different sampling locations. the total bacteria count ranged between 2.86 and 3.45log colony-forming units (cfu)/ml. the highest coliform count recorded was 1.62log cfu/ml. faecal coliform e. coli was detected in one sample from oke-iho and one sample from okaka, representing 2.2%  of total samples. lead and manganese were not found in any of the samples. however, iron was detected and the highest iron concentration (0.10mg/l) was detected in samples from ikorodu. the bacteria that were identified from the water samples included e. coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella sp., proteus vulgaris, alcaligenes faecalis, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus lactis, aeromonas sp. and micrococcus luteum. many of the water processors did not comply with the guidelines of the quality regulatory agency. conclusions: some of the sachet-packaged samples of drinking water were of poor quality. the results indicate a need for nigeria's quality regulatory agency to take appropriate measures in safeguarding public health.

TI  == structure and regulation of the gab gene cluster, involved in the gamma-aminobutyric acid shunt, are controlled by a sigma54 factor in bacillus thuringiensis.
AB  == the structure and regulation of the gab gene cluster, involved in gamma-aminobutyric acid (gaba) shunt, were studied by characterizing gabt and gabd genes cloned from bacillus thuringiensis. deletions of the gabt and gabd genes in b. thuringiensis strain hd-73 did not affect the growth of mutant strains in rich culture media, but the growth of a gabt deletion mutant strain was reduced in basic media (containing 0.2% gaba). genome analysis indicates that the structure of the gab gene cluster in b. thuringiensis hd-73 is different from that in escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis but is common in strains of the bacillus cereus group. this suggests that the gene cluster involved in gaba shunt is specific to the b. cereus group. based on reverse transcription-pcr and transcriptional fusion analysis, we confirmed that the gabt and gabd genes belong to different transcriptional units, while the gabd and gabr genes form an operon. we also demonstrated that the gabr gene plays a positive regulatory role in gabd  and gabt expression. the gabr protein may be a sigma(54)-dependent transcriptional activator, according to a conserved domain search in the ncbi database, and it is highly conserved in the b. cereus group. the -24/-12 consensus sequence of a promoter upstream from gabt suggests that the promoter can be recognized by a sigma(54) factor. further analysis of the genetic complementation studies also suggests that the expression of the gabt gene is controlled by a sigma(54) factor. thus, the expression of the gab cluster is regulated by a sigma(54) factor by way of the transcription activator gabr.

TI  == identification and characterization of a novel antibacterial peptide, avian beta-defensin 2 from ducks.
AB  == in this study, a novel avian beta-defensin (avbd) was isolated from duck pancreas. the complete nucleotide sequence of the gene contained an 195 bp open reading frame encoding 64 amino acids. homology, characterization and comparison  of the gene with avbd from other avian species confirmed that it was duck avbd2.  the mrna expression of the gene was analyzed in 17 tissues from 21-day-old ducks. avbd2 was highly expressed in the trachea, crop, heart, bone marrow, and pancreas; moderately expressed in the muscular stomach, small intestine, kidney,  spleen, thymus, and bursa of fabricius; and weakly expressed in skin. we produced and purified recombinant avbd2 by expressing the gene in escherichia coli. as expected, the recombinant peptide exhibited strong bactericidal properties against bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, and pasteurella multocida, and weak bactericidal properties against e. coli and salmonella choleraesuis. in addition, the recombinant protein retained antimicrobial activity against s. aureus under different temperatures (range, -20 degrees c to 100 degrees c) and ph values (range, 3 to 12).

AB  == curcumin as an edible natural pigment has several biological activities but its use as a food colorant and preservative is restricted due to low stability and insolubility in water. stabilizing it with microencapsulation to obtain microcapsule curcumin can improve its stability and solubility. the microcapsule  curcumin was studied for their antibacterial and antifungal activities against some foodborne pathogens and spoilage microbe such as escherichia coli, yersinia  enterocolitica, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, bacillus cereus, aspergillus niger, penicllium notatum, and saccharomyces cerevisiae. it exhibited broad spectrum inhibitory effect against all organisms by oxford cup methods, and its minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) were determined by agar dilution method and ranged from 15.7 to 250 microg/ml. for the selected microorganisms, its antibacterial activity was more pronounced against gram-positive bacteria than gram-negative bacteria. furthermore, its antifungal activity is much better  than antibacterial activity. microcapsule curcumin remains in antibacterial and antifungal activities after microencapsulation, which can be potential colorant and preservative in food industry.

TI  == effect of mixed antimicrobial agents and flavors in active packaging films.
AB  == active packaging is an emerging food technology to improve the quality and safety of food products. many works have been developed to study the antimicrobial activity of essential oils. essential oils have been traditionally used as flavorings in food, so they have an important odor impact but they have as well antimicrobial properties that could be used to protect the food. recent developments in antimicrobial active packaging showed the efficiency of essential oils versus bread and bakery products among other applications. however, one of the main problems to face is the odor and taste they could provide to the packaged food. using some aromas to mask the odor could be a good approach. that  is why the main objective of this paper is to develop an antimicrobial packaging  material based on the combination of the most active compounds of essential oils  (hydrocinnamaldehyde, oregano essential oil, cinnamaldehyde, thymol, and carvacrol) together with some aromas commonly used in the food industry. a study  of the concentration required to get the antimicrobial properties, the organoleptic compatibility with typical aroma present in many food systems (vanilla, banana, and strawberry), and the right combination of both systems has  been carried out. antimicrobial tests of both the mentioned aromas, the main components of some essential oils, and the combination of both groups were carried out against bacteria (enterococcus faecalis, listeria monocytogenes, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella choleraesuis, yersinia enterocolitica, escherichia coli), yeasts (candida albicans, debaryomyces hansenii, zygosaccharomyces rouxii), and molds (botrytis cinerae, aspergillus flavus, penicillium roqueforti, eurotium repens, penicillium islandicum, penicillium commune, penicillium nalgiovensis). the sensory properties of the combinations were evaluated with a triangular test and classification was by an order test; the odor threshold of the aroma compounds was also studied. the results reveal that none of the aromas had antimicrobial properties. the most antimicrobial compounds are thymol, carvacrol, and cinnamaldehyde, but none of them could be combined with banana aroma, whereas only thymol with strawberry aroma gave the right combined organoleptic profile. all of the antimicrobials under study could be combined with vanilla aroma, providing both antimicrobial property and the odor expected.

TI  == growth and gaseous emissions of pure and mixed small intestinal bacterial cultures: effects of bile and vancomycin.
AB  == simultaneous cultivations in anaerobiosis, aerobiosis and with microaerobic gas mixture were used to clarify the bile (oxgall) effects on the pure and mixed cultures of enterobacterial strains in simulations in portable microbe enrichment unit (pmeu) linked with chempro100i((r)) gas detector. the effects of vancomycin  were evaluated in aerobic cultures. growth and metabolic activity of cultures were also followed by measuring sugar consumption, ph alterations, and colony counts on bd chromagar orientation plates. results showed that the two fermentatively different strains of facultative anaerobes, escherichia coli e 17  and klebsiella mobilis atcc 13048 grew in balance regardless of oxygen level, bile acid concentration or other components of the mixed cultures, bacillus cereus or staphylococcus aureus. when the evaporations of the mixed cultures of e. coli, k. mobilis and s. aureus were compared with the emissions of the corresponding pure cultures by chempro100i((r)) gas sensing detector, the pure cultures of bile resistant e. coli and k. mobilis produced more gaseous components than the mixed culture indicating that these organisms cooperate and use the substrate more effectively together than separately. a survey of the aseptic bacterial isolations from the bile tract in a big university hospital, (salzburg, austria) during 3 years, showed that these bacterial groups dominated. only 13.24% of the 287 patient samples were sterile, and around 180 strains of both e. coli and klebsiella/enterobacter groups were found amongst 973 isolates from 249 patients (together 35.57%). enterococcus sp. accounted for 246 isolates  being the largest group of strains (24.25% of all the isolates). in anaerobiosis  it was shown that klebsiella neutralized the acids produced in the mixed acid fermentation of the e. coli. the ethanol produced from both groups evaporated in  the gas stream of the pmeu culturing step and its formation also removes excess acidity from the cultures. the synergistic behaviour and symbiotic function between e. coli and klebsiella/enterobacter strains is suggested.

(3) and unidentified bacteria (1). conclusions: recycled paperboard contained high populations of bacteria, and a positive correlation was found between recycle content and bacterial populations. escherichia coli, salmonella, shigella or confirmed coliform bacteria were not found in any product. significance and impact of the study: populations of bacteria did not differ significantly from original counts  over a 4-month period of dry storage, indicating that bacteria persist in paperboard over long periods and may re-enter the recycling process. the predominance of heat-tolerant endospore-forming bacteria explains the high bacteria counts found in paperboard made from recycled materials.

AB  == pathogen detection is critical to the process of generating and testing powdered  infant formula (pif). an obstacle associated with pif microbial surveillance is that most current procedures are time-consuming and labor-intensive. we have developed a rapid, dna microarray-based detection technique to identify 10 different pathogenic bacteria associated with pif contamination based on the 16s-23s rrna gene internal transcribed spacer (its) sequences and wzy (o antigen  polymerase) gene. using this procedure, enterobacter sakazakii, salmonella enterica, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, serratia marcescens, acinetobacter baumannii, bacillus cereus, listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus  aureus, and escherichia coli o157 were identified. one hundred eighty-five strains were used to validate the microarray assay (including 134 target pathogen strains and 51 closely related bacteria). twenty-seven probes reproducibly detected multiple pathogens with high specificity and sensitivity (0.100 ng genomic dna or 10(4) cfu/ml). twenty-one real pif samples were tested by the microarray with 100% accuracy. the data presented reveal that the designed oligonucleotide microarray is a promising method for basic microbiology, clinical diagnosis, food safety, and epidemiological surveillance.

AB  == giardia lamblia arginine deiminase (glad), the topic of this paper, belongs to the hydrolase branch of the guanidine-modifying enzyme superfamily, whose members employ cys-mediated nucleophilic catalysis to promote deimination of l-arginine and its naturally occurring derivatives. g. lamblia is the causative agent in the human disease giardiasis. the results of rnai/antisense rna gene-silencing studies reported herein indicate that glad is essential for g. lamblia trophozoite survival and thus, a potential target for the development of therapeutic agents for the treatment of giardiasis. the homodimeric recombinant protein was prepared in escherichia coli for in-depth biochemical characterization. the 2-domain glad monomer consists of a n-terminal domain that  shares an active site structure (depicted by an insilico model) and kinetic properties (determined by steady-state and transient state kinetic analysis) with its bacterial ad counterparts, and a c-terminal domain of unknown fold and function. glad was found to be active over a wide ph range and to accept l-arginine, l-arginine ethyl ester, n(alpha)-benzoyl-l-arginine, and n(omega)-amino-l-arginine as substrates but not agmatine, l-homoarginine, n(alpha)-benzoyl-l-arginine ethyl ester or a variety of arginine-containing peptides. the intermediacy of a cys424-alkylthiouronium ion covalent enzyme adduct was demonstrated and the rate constants for formation (k(1)=80s(-1)) and hydrolysis (k(2)=35s(-1)) of the intermediate were determined. the comparatively  lower value of the steady-state rate constant (k(cat)=2.6s(-1)), suggests that a  step following citrulline formation is rate-limiting. inhibition of glad using cys directed agents was briefly explored. s-nitroso-l-homocysteine was shown to be an active site directed, irreversible inhibitor whereas n(omega)-cyano-l-arginine did not inhibit glad but instead proved to be an active site directed, irreversible inhibitor of the bacillus cereus ad.

TI  == differentiation of whole bacterial cells based on high-throughput microarray chip printing and infrared microspectroscopic readout.
AB  == using robotic automation, a microarray printing protocol for whole bacterial cells was developed for subsequent label-free and nondestructive infrared microspectroscopic detection. using this contact microspotting system, 24 microorganisms were printed on zinc selenide slides; these were 6 species of listeria, 10 species of vibrio, 2 strains of photobacterium damselae, yersinia enterocolitica 289, bacillus cereus atcc 14529, staphylococcus aureus, atcc 19075 (serotype 104 b), shigella sonnei 20143, klebsiella pneumoniae kp73, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii 200, and escherichia coli. microarrays consisting of separate spots of bacterial deposits gave consistent and reproducible infrared spectra, which were differentiated by unsupervised pattern recognition algorithms. two multivariate analysis algorithms, principal component analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis, successfully separated most, but not all, the  bacteria investigated down to the species level.

TI  == antimicrobial, mechanical, and barrier properties of cassava starch-chitosan films incorporated with oregano essential oil.
AB  == the physicochemical and antimicrobial properties of starch-chitosan films incorporated with oregano essential oil (oeo) have been investigated. the antimicrobial effects of starch-chitosan-oeo films against bacillus cereus, escherichia coli, salmonella enteritidis, and staphylococcus aureus were determined by the disk inhibition zone method. the film mechanical properties, water vapor permeability (wvp), fourier transform infrared spectra (ftir), and thermograms (tga) were also determined. films added with oeo effectively inhibited the four microorganisms tested and demonstrated improved barrier properties. the presence of oeo in starch-chitosan films led to the formation of  more flexible films. chitosan was not effective against the tested organisms, but it decreased film rigidity and wvp. tga analysis demonstrated that the addition of chitosan and oeo did not affect the thermal stability of the films.

TI  == simultaneous identification of seven foodborne pathogens and escherichia coli (pathogenic and nonpathogenic) using capillary electrophoresis-based single-strand conformation polymorphism coupled with multiplex pcr.
AB  == the objective of this study was to develop a novel technique for parallel analysis of eight important foodborne microbes using capillary electrophoresis-based single-strand conformation polymorphism (ce-sscp) coupled with multiplex pcr. specific primers for multiplex pcr amplification of the 16s rrna gene were designed, corresponding to eight species of bacteria, including escherichia coli, clostridium perfringens, campylobacter jejuni, salmonella enterica, listeria monocytogenes, vibrio parahaemolyticus, staphylococcus aureus, and bacillus cereus, for the species-specific identification and optimal separation of their pcr products in subsequent analysis by ce-sscp. multiplex pcr conditions including annealing temperature, extension time, the number of pcr cycles, and primer concentrations were then optimized for simultaneous detection  of all target foodborne bacteria. the diagnostic system using ce-sscp combined with multiplex pcr developed here can be used for rapid investigation of causative agents of foodborne illness. the simplicity and high sensitivity of the method may lead to improved management of safety and illness related to food.

TI  == broad range evaluation of the matrix solubilization (matrix lysis) strategy for direct enumeration of foodborne pathogens by nucleic acids technologies.
AB  == a previously published rapid (<5 h) proof-of-concept protocol for the concentration of the foodborne pathogen listeria monocytogenes from milk, based on the solubilization of the food matrix, was further evaluated. the original protocol was modified to detect gram-negative and other gram-positive bacteria and to broaden the range of food matrices by using lutensol instead of sodium dodecyl sulfate as the main detergent in the buffer. a new protocol using a protease and sucrose buffer was established for the analysis of meat and fish. matrix lysis was used for dairy products, ice cream, milk, fish, meat, eggs, and  blood. solubilization of the foodstuffs resulted in bacterial pellets of reasonable size for further quantification. using l. monocytogenes, staphylococccus aureus, bacillus cereus, escherichia coli, and salmonella typhimurium as model organisms, microscopic analysis of the remaining bacterial pellets revealed that the recovered bacteria remained physically intact, albeit their viability was compromised. in model experiments using free dna, the free target dna was reduced by 5 log units. the compatibility of matrix lysis with subsequent real-time pcr analysis has been demonstrated with salmon, chicken, egg, ice cream, cheese, and blood samples that were artificially contaminated with l. monocytogenes, s. aureus, and salmonella typhimurium. these experiments resulted in an average recovery of 48.7% (relative standard error, 83.4%) of the  inoculated bacterial cells with the real-time pcr assay. the average detection limit of the method was 7.3 cfu/ml for all examined foodstuffs and bacterial target organisms.

AB  == cytochrome p450 (p450) open reading frames (orfs) identified in genome sequences  of bacillus species are potential resources for new oxidation biocatalysts. phylogenetic analysis of 29 bacillus p450 orfs revealed that the p450s consist of a limited number of p450 families, cyp102, cyp106, cyp107, cyp109, cyp134, cyp152, and cyp197. previously, we identified the catalytic activities of three p450s of bacillus subtilis towards steroids by rapid substrate screening using fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (ft-icr/ms). here, we further applied this method to evaluate the activity of bacillus cereus p450s towards steroids. five p450 genes were cloned from b. cereus atcc 10987 based on  its genomic sequence and were expressed in escherichia coli. these p450s were reacted with a mixture of 30 compounds that mainly included steroids, and the reaction mixtures were analyzed using ft-icr/ms. we found that bce_2659 (cyp106)  catalyzed the monooxygenation of methyltestosterone, progesterone, 11-ketoprogesterone, medroxyprogesterone acetate, and chlormadinone acetate. bce_2654 (cyp107) monooxygenated testosterone enanthate, and bce_3250 (cyp109) monooxygenated testosterone and compactin. based on the phylogenetic relationship and the known substrate specificities including ones identified in this study, we discuss the catalytic potential of bacillus p450s towards steroids.

TI  == infections in patients with aplastic anemia.
AB  == infection is a major cause of death in patients with aplastic anemia (aa). there  are differences between the immunocompromised state of a patient with aa and the  patient who is neutropenic due to chemotherapy and this leads to a difference in  the infections that they incur. prolonged neutropenia is one of the largest risk  factors for the development of infections with the invasive mycoses and bacteria. recovery from neutropenia is directly related to survival, and supportive care plays a large role in protection while the patient is in a neutropenic state. the most common invasive mycoses include the aspergillus species, zygomycetes, candida spp., and fusarium spp. bacterial infections that are seen in patients with aa include gram-positive coagulase-negative staphylococcus species, enterococcus, staphylococus aureus, clostridium spp., micrococcus, alpha-hemolytic streptococci, listeria monocytogenes, and bacillus cereus. gram-negative infections including gram-negative bacilli, escherichia coli, salmonella, bacteroides fragilis, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumonia, aeromonas hydrophilia, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and vibrio vulnificus. viral infections are much less common but include those that belong to the herpesviridae family, community-acquired respiratory viral infection, and the viral hepatitides a, b, and c. evidence of the parasite strongyloides stercoralis has also been documented. this review discusses the major invasive fungal infections, bacterial pathogens, parasites, and viral infections that are found in patients with aa who are treated with immunosuppressive therapy. the specific  immune impairment and current treatment parameters for each of these classes of infection will also be discussed.

TI  == a new minimal replicon of bacillus anthracis plasmid pxo1.
AB  == an 8,883-bp mini-pxo1 plasmid containing a replicon from bacillus anthracis pxo1  (181.6 kb) was identified by making large deletions in the original plasmid using a newly developed cre-loxp system. portions of the truncated mini-pxo1 were cloned into an escherichia coli vector unable to replicate in b. anthracis. a 5.95-kb region encompassing three putative genes was identified as the minimal pxo1 fragment required for replication of the resulting recombinant shuttle plasmid (named pmr) in b. anthracis. deletion analysis showed that the only genes essential for replication were the pxo1-14 and pxo1-16 genes, which are transcribed in opposite directions and encode predicted proteins of 66.5 and 67.1 kda, respectively. the orf14 protein contains a helix-turn-helix motif, while the orf16 upstream region contains attributes of a theta-replicating plasmid origin of replication (ori), namely, an exclusively a+t-containing segment, five 9-bp direct repeats, an inverted repeat, and a sigma(a)-dependent promoter for the putative replication initiator rep protein (orf16). spontaneous mutations generated in the orf14, orf16, and ori regions of pmr during pcr amplification produced a temperature-sensitive plasmid that is unable to replicate in b. anthracis at 37 degrees c. the efficacy of transformation of plasmid-free b. anthracis ames and sterne strains by the original pmr was approximately 10(3) cfu/microg, while bacillus cereus strains 569 and atcc 10987 were transformed with efficiencies of 10(4) and 10(2) cfu/microg, respectively. around 95% of b. anthracis cells retained pmr after one round of sporulation and germination.

TI  == formation of flavone di-o-glucosides using a glycosyltransferase from bacillus cereus.
AB  == microbial udp-glycosyltransferases can convert many small lipophilic compounds into glycons using uridinediphosphate- activated sugars. the glycosylation of flavonoids affects solubility, stability, and bioavailability. the gene encoding  the udp-glycosyltransferase from bacillus cereus, bcgt-3, was cloned by pcr and sequenced. bcgt-3 was expressed in escherichia coli bl21 (de3) with a glutathione s-transferase tag and purified using a glutathione stransferase affinity column.  bcgt-3 was tested for activity on several substrates including genistein, kaempferol, luteolin, naringenin, and quercetin. flavonols were the best substrates for bcgt-3. the enzyme dominantly glycosylated the 3-hydroxyl group, but the 7-hydroxyl group was glycosylated when the 3-hydroxyl group was not available. the kaempferol reaction products were identified as kaempferol-3-o-glucoside and kaempferol- 3,7-o-diglucoside. kaempferol was the most effective substrate tested. based on hplc, lc/ms, and nmr analyses of the reaction products, we conclude that bcgt-3 can be used for the synthesis of kaempferol 3,7-o-diglucose.

AB  == a macrocyclic hydrazone schiff base was synthesized by reacting 1,4-dicarbonyl phenyl dihydrazide with 2,6-diformyl-4-methyl phenol and a series of metal complexes with this new schiff base were synthesized by reaction with co(ii), ni(ii) and cu(ii) metal salts. the schiff base and its complexes have been characterized by elemental analyses, ir, (1)h nmr, uv-vis, fab mass, esr spectra, fluorescence, thermal, magnetic and molar conductance data. the analytical data reveal that the co(ii), ni(ii) and cu(ii) complexes possess 2:1 metal-ligand ratios. all the complexes are non-electrolytes in dmf and dmso due to their low molar conductance values. infrared spectral data suggest that the hydrazone schiff base behaves as a hexadentate ligand with non non donor sequence towards the metal ions. the esr spectral data shows that the metal-ligand bond has considerable covalent character. the electrochemical behavior of the copper(ii) complex was investigated by cyclic voltammetry. the schiff base and its complexes have also been screened for their antibacterial (escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, shigella dysentery, micrococcus, bacillus subtilis, bacillus cereus and pseudomonas aeruginosa) and antifungal activities (aspergillus niger, penicillium and candida albicans) by mic method. the brine shrimp bioassay was also carried out to study their in-vitro cytotoxic properties.

TI  == microbial co-habitation and lateral gene transfer: what transposases can tell us.
AB  == background: determining the habitat range for various microbes is not a simple, straightforward matter, as habitats interlace, microbes move between habitats, and microbial communities change over time. in this study, we explore an approach using the history of lateral gene transfer recorded in microbial genomes to begin to answer two key questions: where have you been and who have you been with? results: all currently sequenced microbial genomes were surveyed to identify pairs of taxa that share a transposase that is likely to have been acquired through lateral gene transfer. a microbial interaction network including almost 800 organisms was then derived from these connections. although the majority of the connections are between closely related organisms with the same or overlapping habitat assignments, numerous examples were found of cross-habitat and cross-phylum connections. conclusions: we present a large-scale study of the  distributions of transposases across phylogeny and habitat, and find a significant correlation between habitat and transposase connections. we observed  cases where phylogenetic boundaries are traversed, especially when organisms share habitats; this suggests that the potential exists for genetic material to move laterally between diverse groups via bridging connections. the results presented here also suggest that the complex dynamics of microbial ecology may be traceable in the microbial genomes.

TI  == cloning of feather-degrading minor extracellular protease from bacillus cereus dcuw: dissection of the structural domains.
AB  == bacterial extracellular proteases play an important role in cell survival and cell-cell communication. a high-molecular-mass minor extracellular protease (vpr) from a feather-degrading bacterium, bacillus cereus dcuw, has been reported by our laboratory. in the present study, we cloned and expressed vpr in escherichia  coli. complete nucleotide sequencing of this gene predicted that the protease is  a member of the serine protease family, and smart domain analysis revealed that the protease consists of an n-terminal signal sequence for secretion, a subtilisin_n sequence that is a signature for n-terminal processing, a catalytic  s_8 peptidase domain, and finally a long c-terminal protease-associated (pa) region containing nine intrinsically disordered subdomains. four truncated constructs of the vpr protease were cloned and expressed in e. coli. we found that the catalytic domain (amino acid residues 172-583) is sufficient for protease activity. maturation of the vpr protease needed both n-terminal and c-terminal processing. we have demonstrated that the oligomerization property is  associated with the c-terminal protease-associated domain and also shown that the substrate-binding specificity to raw feather resides in this domain.

TI  == construction of a recombinant intergenus multidomain chimeric protein for simultaneous expression of haemolysin bl of bacillus cereus, listeriolysin o of listeria monocytogenes and enterotoxin b of staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == haemolysin bl (hbl) of bacillus cereus, listeriolysin o (llo) of listeria monocytogenes and enterotoxin b (seb) of staphylococcus aureus are among the major toxin components contributing to the pathogenicity of these organisms in foodborne illnesses. in this study, an intergenus non-toxic multidomain fusion protein (r-hle) was generated with specificity for hbl, llo and seb. the fusion gene (r-hle) comprising the conserved regions of hbld and the hly and entb genes  was codon-optimized for expression in escherichia coli and encoded a 50 kda recombinant multidomain chimeric protein (r-hle). hyperimmune antiserum raised against r-hle specifically reacted with the l1 (38 kda) component of the hbl complex of b. cereus, llo (58 kda) of l. monocytogenes and seb (28 kda) of s. aureus during western blot analysis when tested on standard strains. during testing on isolates, the antiserum again identified the appropriate toxin molecules and was highly specific to the relevant bacterial species. the antigenicity of the seb component of the r-hle protein was also confirmed using a commercially available tecra kit. the described procedure of creating a single antigenic molecule carrying components of three different toxins whilst still retaining the original antigenic determinants of individual toxins will be highly advantageous in the development of rapid, reliable and cost-effective immunoassays.

TI  == engineered sers substrates with multiscale signal enhancement: nanoparticle cluster arrays.
AB  == defined nanoparticle cluster arrays (ncas) with total lateral dimensions of up to 25.4 microm x 25.4 microm have been fabricated on top of a 10 nm thin gold film using template-guided self-assembly. this approach provides precise control of the structural parameters in the arrays, allowing a systematic variation of the average number of nanoparticles in the clusters (n) and the edge-to-edge separation (lambda) between 1 < n < 20 and 50 nm < or = lambda < or = 1000 nm, respectively. investigations of the rayleigh scattering spectra and surface-enhanced raman scattering (sers) signal intensities as a function of n and lambda reveal direct near-field coupling between the particles within individual clusters, whose strength increases with the cluster size (n) until it  saturates at around n = 4. our analysis shows that strong near-field interactions between individual clusters significantly affect the sers signal enhancement for  edge-to-edge separations lambda < 200 nm. the observed dependencies of the raman  signals on n and lambda indicate that ncas support a multiscale signal enhancement which originates from simultaneous inter- and intracluster coupling and |e|-field enhancement. the ncas provide strong and reproducible sers signals  not only from small molecules but also from whole bacterial cells, which enabled  a rapid spectral discrimination between three tested bacteria species: escherichia coli, bacillus cereus, and staphylococcus aureus.

TI  == the tubulin-like repx protein encoded by the pxo1 plasmid forms polymers in vivo  in bacillus anthracis.
AB  == bacillus anthracis contains two megaplasmids, pxo1 and pxo2, that are critical for its pathogenesis. stable inheritance of pxo1 in b. anthracis is dependent upon the tubulin/ftsz-like repx protein encoded by this plasmid. previously, we have shown that repx undergoes gtp-dependent polymerization in vitro. however, the polymerization properties and localization pattern of repx in vivo are not known. here, we utilize a repx-green fluorescent protein (gfp) fusion to show that repx forms foci and three distinct forms of polymeric structures in b. anthracis in vivo, namely straight, curved, and helical filaments. polymerization of repx-gfp as well as the nature of polymers formed were dependent upon concentration of the protein inside the b. anthracis cells. repx predominantly localized as polymers that were parallel to the length of the cell. repx also formed polymers in escherichia coli in the absence of other pxo1-encoded products, showing that in vivo polymerization is an inherent property of the protein and does not require either the pxo1 plasmid or proteins unique to b. anthracis. overexpression of repx did not affect the cell morphology of b. anthracis cells, whereas it drastically distorted the cell morphology of e. coli  host cells. we discuss the significance of our observations in view of the plasmid-specific functions that have been proposed for repx and related proteins  encoded by several megaplasmids found in members of the bacillus cereus group of  bacteria.

TI  == the science of salsa: antimicrobial properties of salsa components to learn scientific methodology.
AB  == most ethnic foods and cooking practices have incorporated the use of spices and other food additives. many common spices have crossed cultural boundaries and appear in multiple ethnic cuisines. recent studies have demonstrated that many of these ingredients possess antimicrobial properties against common food spoilage microorganisms. we developed a laboratory exercise that promotes the use of scientific methodology to evaluate the effectiveness of salsa components at inhibiting the growth of undesirable microorganisms. tomato, onion, garlic, cilantro, and jalapeno were tested for antimicrobial properties against a representative fungus, saccharomyces cerevisiae, and the common food spoilage bacteria staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, and escherichia coli. each component was ethanol extracted and a modification of the kirby-bauer method of antimicrobial sensitivity was employed. garlic demonstrated the greatest inhibitory effects against all organisms tested. onion demonstrated a slight inhibition of all four organisms, while cilantro showed some inhibition of all three bacteria but no effect against the fungus. jalapeno may have slightly inhibited e. coli and s. aureus, as evidenced by a consistently measured increase in the zone of inhibition that was not statistically significant when compared to that of the control. following the initial exercise, students were given the opportunity to repeat the exercise using other spices such as cinnamon, clove, nutmeg, and coriander. student learning outcomes were evaluated using preliminary and secondary surveys, mainly focusing on definitions of science and hypothesis as well as the process of science. students enjoyed this exercise and met the learning goals of understanding the process and methodology of science, as well as the interdisciplinarity inherent in the sciences. student learning was evidenced by an increase in the number of correct responses on the secondary survey in comparison to the preliminary.

TI  == evaluation of a microbiological multi-residue system on the detection of antibacterial substances in ewe milk.
AB  == to protect both, public health and the dairy industry, from the presence of antibiotic residues in milk, control programmes have been established, which include the needed screening tests. this work focuses on the application of a microbiological multi-residue system in ewe milk, a method based on the use of six different plates, each seeded with one of the following bacteria: geobacillus stearothermophilus var. calidolactis (beta-lactams), bacillus subtilis at ph 8.0  (aminoglycosides), kocuria rhizophila (macrolides), escherichia coli (quinolones), b. cereus (tetracyclines) and b. subtilis at ph 7.0 (sulphonamides), respectively. twenty-three antimicrobial substances were analysed and a logistic regression was established for each substance assayed to  relate the antibiotic concentration and the zone of microbial growth inhibition.  great linearity in the response was observed (regression coefficients of over 0.97). this fact suggests the possibility of establishing a decision level of antibiotic concentrations near to the maximum residue limits (mrl). zones of inhibition were suggested as proposed action levels for the different antimicrobial groups (diameters of inhibition of 18 mm for the aminoglycoside, beta-lactam and sulphonamide plates; 19 mm for the tetracycline plate, 21 mm for  the macrolide plate, and 24 mm for the quinolone plate). specificity and cross-reactivity were also assayed.

TI  == antibacterial effects of roselle calyx extracts and protocatechuic acid in ground beef and apple juice.
AB  == the antibacterial effects of roselle calyx aqueous and ethanol extracts and protocatechuic acid against food spoilage bacteria salmonella typhimurium dt104,  escherichia coli o157:h7, listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, and bacillus cereus were examined. minimal inhibitory concentrations of roselle calyx aqueous and ethanol extracts and protocatechuic acid against these bacteria were  in the range of 112-144, 72-96, and 24-44 microg/ml, respectively. protocatechuic acid content in roselle calyx aqueous and ethanol extracts was 2.8 +/- 0.7 and 11.9 +/- 1.2 mg/g, respectively. antibacterial activity of roselle calyx ethanol  extract and protocatechuic acid was not affected by heat treatments from 25 degrees to 75 degrees c and 25 degrees to 100 degrees c, respectively. after 3 days storage at 25 degrees c, the addition of roselle calyx extracts and protocatechuic acid exhibited dose-dependent inhibitory effects against test bacteria in ground beef and apple juice, in which the roselle calyx ethanol extract showed greater antibacterial effects than the aqueous extract. these data suggest that roselle calyx ethanol extract and protocatechuic acid might be potent agents as food additives to prevent contamination from these bacteria.

TI  == fluorescent-box-pcr for resolving bacterial genetic diversity, endemism and biogeography.
AB  == background: box-a1r-based repetitive extragenic palindromic-pcr (box-pcr) is one  of the most used techniques in biogeography studies of microbial isolates. however the traditional separation of box-pcr patterns by agarose gel electrophoresis suffers many limitations. the aim of this research was to set up  a fluorescent box-pcr (f-box-pcr) assay in which separation of pcr products is automated in a capillary electrophoresis system. f-box-pcr was compared with the  traditional box-pcr using bacterial strains with different g+c content (bacillus  cereus; escherichia coli; isolates of the family geodermatophilaceae). resolution, discriminatory power and reproducibility were evaluated by assaying different electrophoretic runs, pcr reactions and independent dna extractions. box-pcr and f-box-pcr were compared for the analysis of 29 strains of modestobacter multiseptatus isolated from three different microsites in an altered carbonatic wall from cagliari, italy, and 45 strains of streptococcus thermophilus isolated from 34 samples of the hand-made, yogurt-like product matsoni, collected in different locations in georgia. results: fluorophore 6-fam  proved more informative than hex and box-pcr both in agarose gel electrophoresis  (p < 0.004 and p < 0.00003) and in capillary electrophoresis (compared only with  hex, p < 2 x 10(-7)). 6-fam- and hex-based f-box-pcr respectively detected up to  12.0 and 11.3 times more fragments than box-pcr. replicate separations of f-box-pcr showed an accuracy of the size calling of +/- 0.5 bp until 500 bp, constantly decreasing to +/- 10 bp at 2000 bp. cluster analysis of f-box-pcr profiles grouped m. multiseptatus strains according to the microsite of isolation and s. thermophilus strains according to the geographical origin of matsoni, but  resulted intermixed when a box-pcr dataset was used. conclusion: f-box-pcr represents an improved method for addressing bacterial biogeography studies both  in term of sensitivity, reproducibility and data analysis.

TI  == using shotgun sequence data to find active restriction enzyme genes.
AB  == whole genome shotgun sequence analysis has become the standard method for beginning to determine a genome sequence. the preparation of the shotgun sequence clones is, in fact, a biological experiment. it determines which segments of the  genome can be cloned into escherichia coli and which cannot. by analyzing the complete set of sequences from such an experiment, it is possible to identify genes lethal to e. coli. among this set are genes encoding restriction enzymes which, when active in e. coli, lead to cell death by cleaving the e. coli genome  at the restriction enzyme recognition sites. by analyzing shotgun sequence data sets we show that this is a reliable method to detect active restriction enzyme genes in newly sequenced genomes, thereby facilitating functional annotation. active restriction enzyme genes have been identified, and their activity demonstrated biochemically, in the sequenced genomes of methanocaldococcus jannaschii, bacillus cereus atcc 10987 and methylococcus capsulatus.

TI  == rechargeable antimicrobial surface modification of polyethylene.
AB  == polyethylene films were surface modified, to incorporate amine and amide functionalities, and subsequently were evaluated for their ability to recharge the antimicrobial n-halamine structures after contact with sodium hypochlorite, a common food-approved sanitizer. surfaces were tested for chlorine retention and release, as well as antimicrobial activity against microorganisms relevant to food quality and food safety, including escherichia coli k-12, pseudomonas fluorescens, bacillus cereus, and listeria monocytogenes. n-halamine functionalized polyethylene exhibited chlorine rechargeability, maintaining 5 to  7 nmol/cm2 n-halamine structures for six successive charges. the n-halamine functionalized films achieved a 4-log reduction for all organisms tested and maintained a greater than 3-log reduction for four successive uses, suggesting that the modified polyethylene films are capable of providing rechargeable antimicrobial activity. the modified films exhibited antimicrobial activity in aqueous suspensions (p < 0.05) and reduced microbial growth in diluted broth (p < 0.05), suggesting the potential for biocidal action even in the presence of organic matter. such a rechargeable antimicrobial surface could supplement existing cleaning and sanitation programs in food processing environments to reduce the adhesion, growth, and subsequent cross-contamination of food pathogens, as well as food spoilage organisms.

TI  == construction of a non toxic chimeric protein (l1-l2-b) of haemolysin bl from bacillus cereus and its application in hbl toxin detection.
AB  == among the many potential virulence factors of b. cereus, haemolysin bl is a unique and potent three component pore forming toxin composed of a binding component, b, and two lytic components, l(1) and l(2). heterogeneity in nucleic acid and protein sequences of hbl components and problems during expression of l(1) and l(2) proteins in recombinant host due to their toxicity causes problems  for development of specific detection systems based on pcr and immunoassay, respectively. commercially available kit (bcet rpla, oxoid) is useful for detection of l(2) component of hbl, but detection of only one component is insufficient to give comprehensive view on hbl toxin producing strains as some strains produced only one or two of the three hbl components. to address above mentioned problems, in this study, we cloned conserved domains of b, l(1) and l(2) components together as single fusion gene and expressed as recombinant multidomain chimeric protein in e. coli. the resultant protein having l(1), b and l(2) components in the form of single protein had no toxicity towards e. coli as  we followed truncated protein approach. the hyperimmune antisera raised in mice against r-chimeric protein reacted with all the three components of hbl toxin of  b. cereus (atcc 14579) and provided three reaction bands at ~40 kda to ~50 kda regions during western blot analysis. the hyperimmune sera of r-chimeric protein  also notably neutralized the hemolytic activity of native hbl toxin. these results demonstrated that the obtained chimeric protein is correct and retained the antigenicity of native hbl toxin components. therefore, it has better application in the development of a comprehensive hbl detection immunoassay and may also be a potential candidate molecule for vaccine studies.

AB  == the crude extract and the hexane, ch(2)cl(2), etoac, n-buoh, and hydromethanolic  fractions of the aerial parts of mitracarpus frigidus were evaluated against promastigote forms of two species of leishmania (l. chagasi and l. amazonensis),  11 strains of bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella enterica sorovar tythimurium, shigella sonnei, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, micrococcus luteus, enterococcus faecalis, enterobacter cloacae, streptococcus pyogenes and bacillus cereus) and two yeasts (candida albicans and  cryptococcus neoformans). the antioxidant activity (dpph radical scavenging activity and reducing power), cytotoxicity against mammalian cells, and the contents of phenolics and flavonoids were determined. phytochemical analysis of the major groups of phytoconstituents is also reported. all samples showed antioxidant activity which was positively correlated to the content of phenolic compounds. s. sonnei, b. cereus and c. neoformans were susceptible to all extracts tested, except for the n-buoh and hydromethanolic fractions, which demonstrated no antimicrobial activity. the lowest mic was recorded for the ch(2)cl(2) fraction against c. neoformans (mic of 10 microg/ml), followed by b. cereus, s. sonnei, and e. cloacae (mic of 20, 39 and 39 microg/ml, respectively). the ch(2)cl(2) fraction was the most effective against l. chagasi (ic(50) of 6.7  microg/ml), and the hydromethanolic fraction exhibited the best activity against  l. amazonensis (ic(50) of 9 microg/ml). a cytotoxic effect on mammalian cells was observed only for the crude extract and ch(2)cl(2) fraction at the concentrations of 130 and 31 microg/ml, respectively. these results suggest that m. frigidus has interesting antimicrobial, antileishmanial and antioxidant activities.

TI  == bacteriocin-producing lactobacillus strains isolated from poto poto, a congolese  fermented maize product, and genetic fingerprinting of their plantaricin operons.
AB  == thirty one bacteriocin-producing lactobacillus isolates were identified among 135 lactobacilli isolated from the congolese fermented maize product poto poto, during the preparation and from the finished product. using species-specific pcr  and 16s rrna gene sequencing, 28 and 3 isolates were identified as l. plantarum and l. fermentum, respectively. cluster analysis of rapd-pcr fingerprints revealed two main groups (g1 and g2) plus the l. fermentum isolate c4-13. group g1 contained 23 isolates with a similarity coefficient > 74.5%, and could be divided in two subgroups (g1-1, g1-2) each with several branches, plus the l. plantarum isolate c11. group g2 contained 8 isolates with a similarity coefficient > 86%, with two main branches. using pcr amplification with specific  primers, several genes of the plantaricin cluster found in l. plantarum c11 were  identified in the isolates. the number of genes that were detected varied between the strains. the l. fermentum isolate ec11 also contained the plndefg genes. pcr  amplification of dna from isolates with primers directed to the upstream and downstream region of the plantaricin cluster generated an amplicon identical to that obtained with dna from the control strain l. plantarum wcfs1. amplification  products from the positive strains were used for restriction analysis with hindiii, ecori and kpni in separate reactions. cluster analysis of restriction profiles revealed high similarities for ecori and hindii digest profiles, and an  identical profile for all kpni digests. the l. fermentum ec11 isolate clustered with l. plantarum strains in a group with a high correlation coefficient. the results suggest a low degree of diversity in the plantarincin gene cluster. however, other strains that tested positive for individual plantaricin genes may  present great heterogeneity in the plantaricin operons. because of their broad spectra of inhibition (including escherichia coli, salmonella enterica, enterobacter aerogenes, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, listeria monocytogenes, and enterococcus faecalis), isolates from the present study could  be used to improve the safety and storage stability of poto poto.

TI  == risk profiles of pork and poultry meat and risk ratings of various pathogen/product combinations.
AB  == risk profiles of pork and poultry meat were carried out using an excel-based software program, risk ranger. it is a semi-quantitative risk estimator answering various questions relating to the probability of exposure to a hazard, susceptibility of the population of interest, severity of the illness caused by the hazard if present and probability of food containing an infectious dose. therefore, qualitative and quantitative inputs were used to estimate and rank the risk of various hazards/food combinations. risk scores provided by the tool were  characterized as low, medium and high. also, health risk was estimated separately, where needed, for low and high risk populations. low risk scores were obtained for salmonella spp., listeria monocytogenes and enterohaemorrhagic escherichia coli (ehec) for low risk population. high risk scores were obtained for hepatitis e virus (hev) in raw pork products (both low and high risk populations). moderate risk scores for salmonella spp. and l. monocytogenes in processed pork or poultry-meat products (ready-to-eat or to be reheated) and partially cooked pork products were also obtained (low risk population). scores for staphylococcus aureus, clostridium perfringens and bacillus cereus and various product types were mostly in the "medium" risk category, except for s. aureus/ready-to-eat pork products able to support growth of the organism, which fell into the high risk category. campylobacter spp. gave moderate risk scores with one exception (raw poultry products), whereas y. enterocolitica showed combinations of low risk and few of medium risk. high risk pathogen/product combinations identified were: 1) temperature abused, ready-to-eat pork and/or poultry-meat products with extended shelf life and cross-contaminated by l. monocytogenes (high risk population), ehec (high risk population) or s. aureus (all population), 2) partially cooked or processed intended to be reheated pork products cross-contaminated by l. monocytogenes, served undercooked and receiving improper cooling or reheating (high risk population), and 3) all people consuming undercooked meals cross-contaminated with campylobacter spp. (e.g. from raw poultry and raw poultry-meat products) and hev (e.g. from raw pork and raw pork-meat products). salmonellae gave high risk scores in all food categories (except preserved meat products) for high risk population. preserved meats (mainly pork) such as dry fermented sausages gave low risk scores. only salmonella spp., l. monocytogenes and e. coli ehec gave moderate risk ratings in  case of ingredients likely to be contaminated at an early stage of processing (e.g. animal at slaughter) and inadequate fermentation process. these results may constitute a source of information for hazard assessment during application of a  food safety management system.

TI  == method for evaluation of the efficacy of antimicrobial preservatives in cosmetic  wet wipes.
AB  == many cosmetic formulations are now available in the form of wet wipes packaged in sealed sachets or packets. like the majority of cosmetic products having an aqueous phase, wipes are susceptible to microbial contamination and require the addition of preservatives. the efficacy of such preservatives can be evaluated using a standard challenge test performed on the wetting liquid but this test cannot be regarded as representative for this new type of formulation. the method presented here evaluates the efficacy of preservatives used in wet wipes kept in  their original packaging. dried inoculums were prepared by membrane filtration followed by drying in an incubator. the method is applicable to bacteria (pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis), bacillus cereus spores and fungi (candida albicans and aspergillus niger). these inoculated carriers were inserted between two wipes in the original package, which was then re-sealed immediately. the test requires one dry inoculum per packet and one packet for each control or test. after incubation at 22.5 degrees c for 1, 2, 7, 14 or 28 days and, for the control, immediately after insertion of the membrane (time 0), microorganism counts were performed on the germ-carrier membranes as well as on adjacent wipes, after transfer into a suitable neutralizing agent. the membranes were shaken in the presence of glass beads and microorganisms were dissociated from the wipes by means of a stomacher. the supernatants recovered after being left to stand for 20 min are counted by pour plate method or membrane filtration. the feasibility of the method was demonstrated for each of the seven above-mentioned strains. the repeatability and reproducibility of the results obtained is similar to that obtained for preservative efficacy tests in the pharmacopoeias. the lethal rate of microorganisms during the preparation of dry inoculums ranges from 50 to 90% depending on the strain and the test (generally, a spontaneous reduction of about 1 log up to a maximum of 2 log). the recovery rate for microorganisms from dry inoculums (on membranes) at time 0 (control = t(0)) is around 90%, regardless of  the strain or the test. the number of microorganisms recovered from the wipes (w(0)) is between 2 and 10% of the number recovered from membranes (t(0)) and may be considered negligible. application of this method to different types of wipes  demonstrates that the efficacy of preservatives, expressed as the logarithmic reduction in the number of microorganisms at each time point, depends on the type of wipe and on the strain tested. the results obtained are considerably different from those found with the standard challenge tests applied to wetting liquids for wipes. the differences found confirm the need for a specific method applicable to wipes.

TI  == biosynthesis of enantiopure (s)-3-hydroxybutyric acid in metabolically engineered escherichia coli.
AB  == a biosynthetic pathway for the production of (s)-3-hydroxybutyric acid (s3hb) from glucose was established in recombinant escherichia coli by introducing the beta-ketothiolase gene from ralstonia eutropha h16, the (s)-3-hydroxybutyryl-coa  dehydrogenase gene from r. eutropha h16, or clostridium acetobutylicum atcc824, and the 3-hydroxyisobutyryl-coa hydrolase gene from bacillus cereus atcc14579. artificial operon consisting of these genes was constructed and was expressed in  e. coli bl21 (de3) codon plus under t7 promoter by isopropyl beta-d: -thiogalactoside (iptg) induction. recombinant e. coli bl21 (de3) codon plus expressing the beta-ketothiolase gene, the (s)-3-hydroxybutyryl-coa dehydrogenase gene, and the 3-hydroxyisobutyryl-coa hydrolase gene could synthesize enantiomerically pure s3hb to the concentration of 0.61 g l(-1) from 20 g l(-1) of glucose in luria-bertani medium. fed-batch cultures of recombinant e. coli bl21 (de3) codon plus were carried out to achieve higher titer of s3hb with varying induction time and glucose concentration during fermentation. protein expression was induced by addition of 1 mm iptg when cell concentration reached 10 and 20 g l(-1) (od(600) = 30 and 60), respectively. when protein expression was induced at 60 of od(600) and glucose was fed to the concentration of 15 g l(-1), 10.3 g l(-1) of s3hb was obtained in 38 h with the s3hb productivity of 0.21 g l(-1)h(-1). lowering glucose concentration to 5 g l(-1) and induction of protein expression at 30 of od(600) significantly reduced final s3hb concentration to 3.7 g l(-1), which also resulted in the decrease of the s3hb productivity to 0.05 g l(-1)h(-1).

TI  == from soil to gut: bacillus cereus and its food poisoning toxins.
AB  == bacillus cereus is widespread in nature and frequently isolated from soil and growing plants, but it is also well adapted for growth in the intestinal tract of insects and mammals. from these habitats it is easily spread to foods, where it may cause an emetic or a diarrhoeal type of food-associated illness that is becoming increasingly important in the industrialized world. the emetic disease is a food intoxication caused by cereulide, a small ring-formed dodecadepsipeptide. similar to the virulence determinants that distinguish bacillus thuringiensis and bacillus anthracis from b. cereus, the genetic determinants of cereulide are plasmid-borne. the diarrhoeal syndrome of b. cereus is an infection caused by vegetative cells, ingested as viable cells or spores, thought to produce protein enterotoxins in the small intestine. three pore-forming cytotoxins have been associated with diarrhoeal disease: haemolysin  bl (hbl), nonhaemolytic enterotoxin (nhe) and cytotoxin k. hbl and nhe are homologous three-component toxins, which appear to be related to the monooligomeric toxin cytolysin a found in escherichia coli. this review will focus on the toxins associated with foodborne diseases frequently caused by b. cereus. the disease characteristics are described, and recent findings regarding  the associated toxins are discussed, as well as the present knowledge on virulence regulation.

AB  == potential sources of microbial contamination of satsuma mandarin fruit were investigated from production through the packing shed in the 2005 season. microbial counts in the peel and flesh during the fruit development stage were below 2.4 log cfu/g for bacteria and 3 log cfu/g for fungi, except for the peel in august and september. in the field environment, the highest microbial counts were found in fallen leaves on the ground, followed by soil, organic fertilizer,  and agricultural water. only the pesticide solution collected in july was positive for salmonella, while no verotoxin-producing escherichia coli was detected from any of the samples. the bacterial and mold flora in the peel comprised phytopathogenic organisms such as bacteria genus pantoea and mold genus mycosphaerella and soilborne organisms such as bacteria genus bacillus and mold genus cladosporium, which were found in soil, fallen leaves, agricultural water,  and cloth mulch throughout the production season. after fruit harvest and sorting, microbial counts of the peel increased, while those of the flesh remained below the lower limit of detection. although some of the preharvest sources could also be postharvest sources, some packing shed equipment was assumed to be postharvest sources, because bacillus cereus was not identified from the fruit in the production field but was detected on the peel after sorting and on equipment such as gloves, plastic harvest basket, and size sorter. these results suggest that using sanitizers for agricultural water and packing sheds to prevent cross-contamination would be useful in a good agricultural practices program of the satsuma mandarin in japan.

TI  == the antimicrobial efficacy of plant essential oil combinations and interactions with food ingredients.
AB  == the objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of plant essential oils  (eos) in combination and to investigate the effect of food ingredients on their efficacy. the eos assessed in combination included basil, lemon balm, marjoram, oregano, rosemary, sage and thyme. combinations of eos were initially screened against bacillus cereus, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes and pseudomonas aeruginosa using the spot-on-agar test. the influence of varying concentrations of eo combinations on efficacy was also monitored using e. coli. these preliminary studies showed promising results for oregano in combination with basil, thyme or marjoram. the checkerboard method was then used to quantify the efficacy of oregano, marjoram or thyme in combination with the remainder of selected eos. fractional inhibitory concentrations (fic) were calculated and interpreted as synergy, addition, indifference or antagonism. all the oregano combinations showed additive efficacy against b. cereus, and oregano combined with marjoram, thyme or basil also had an additive effect against e. coli and p.  aeruginosa. the mixtures of marjoram or thyme also displayed additive effects in  combination with basil, rosemary or sage against l. monocytogenes. the effect of  food ingredients and ph on the antimicrobial efficacy of oregano and thyme was assessed by monitoring the lag phase and the maximum specific growth rate of l. monocytogenes grown in model media. the model media included potato starch (0, 1, 5 or 10%), beef extract (1.5, 3, 6 or 12%), sunflower oil (0, 1, 5 or 10%) and tsb at ph levels of 4, 5, 6 or 7. the antimicrobial efficacy of eos was found to  be a function of ingredient manipulation. starch and oils concentrations of 5% and 10% had a negative impact on the eo efficacy. on the contrary, the eos were more effective at high concentrations of protein, and at ph 5, by comparison with ph 6 or 7. this study suggests that combinations of eos could minimize application concentrations and consequently reduce any adverse sensory impact in  food. however, their application for microbial control might be affected by food  composition, therefore, careful selection of eos appropriate to the sensory and compositional status of the food system is required. this work shows that eos might be more effective against food-borne pathogens and spoilage bacteria when applied to ready to use foods containing a high protein level at acidic ph, as well as lower levels of fats or carbohydrates.

TI  == qnr-like pentapeptide repeat proteins in gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == objectives: to study the role of qnr-like pentapeptide repeat proteins (prps) from several gram-positive species with quinolone resistance in vitro. methods: a pcr-based strategy was used to clone and express genes coding for qnr-like prps in enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, listeria monocytogenes, clostridium perfringens, c. difficile, bacillus cereus and b. subtilis in escherichia coli dh10b. mic values of nalidixic acid and fluoroquinolones were determined for reference strains and e. coli dh10b harbouring recombinant plasmids containing genes coding for prps. results: amino acid identity of qnr-like prps in gram-positive strains compared with that of the plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance determinants qnra1, qnrb1 and qnrs1 was in the range of 16%  to 22%. recombinant plasmids coding for qnr-like prps conferred reduced susceptibility to fluoroquinolones (in the range of 0.016 to 0.064 mg/l for ciprofloxacin) and nalidixic acid (from 6 to 12 mg/l), depending on the antimicrobial agent and prp. the prp from b. subtilis showed no protective effect. conclusions: the prps analysed conferred a reduced susceptibility phenotype in e. coli; the data provide further evidence of the possible roles in  quinolone resistance of prps from different gram-positive species. these gram-positive species may constitute a reservoir for qnr-like quinolone resistance proteins.

AB  == escherichia coli hosts able to over-express metal-binding proteins (merp) originating from gram-positive (bacillus cereus rc607) and gram-negative (pseudomonas sp. k-62) bacterial strains were used to adsorb ni(2+), zn(2+) and cr(3+) in aqueous solutions. the initial adsorption rate and adsorption capacity  were determined to evaluate the performance of the biosorbents. with the expression of merp protein, the metal adsorption capacity of the recombinant strains for ni(2+), zn(2+) and cr(3+) significantly improved. the cells carrying  gram-positive merp gene (gb) adsorbed zn(2+) and cr(3+) at a capacity of 22.3 and 0.98 mmol/g biomass, which is 121% and 72% higher, respectively, over that of the merp-free host cells. adsorption capacity of the cells carrying gram-negative merp gene (gp) also increased 144% and 126% for zn(2+) and cr(3+), respectively.  both recombinant strains also exhibited 24% and 5% enhancement in adsorption of ni(2+) for gb and gp, respectively. the initial adsorption rate of the recombinant biosorbents was also higher than that of the merp-free host, suggesting an increased metal-binding affinity with merp expression. severe cell  damage on gb biosorbent was observed after cr(3+) adsorption, probably due to the metal toxicity effect on the cells.

TI  == a single amino acid change is responsible for evolution of acyltransferase specificity in bacterial methionine biosynthesis.
AB  == bacteria and yeast rely on either homoserine transsuccinylase (hts, meta) or homoserine transacetylase (hta; met2) for the biosynthesis of methionine. although hts and hta catalyze similar chemical reactions, these proteins are typically unrelated in both sequence and three-dimensional structure. here we present the 2.0 a resolution x-ray crystal structure of the bacillus cereus meta  protein in complex with homoserine, which provides the first view of a ligand bound to either hta or hts. surprisingly, functional analysis of the b. cereus meta protein shows that it does not use succinyl-coa as a substrate. instead, the protein catalyzes the transacetylation of homoserine using acetyl-coa. therefore, the b. cereus meta protein functions as an hta despite greater than 50% sequence  identity with bona fide hts proteins. this result emphasizes the need for functional confirmation of annotations of enzyme function based on either sequence or structural comparisons. kinetic analysis of site-directed mutants reveals that the b. cereus meta protein and the e. coli hts share a common catalytic mechanism. structural and functional examination of the b. cereus meta  protein reveals that a single amino acid in the active site determines acetyl-coa (glu-111) versus succinyl-coa (gly-111) specificity in the meta-like of acyltransferases. switching of this residue provides a mechanism for evolving substrate specificity in bacterial methionine biosynthesis. within this enzyme family, hts and hta activity likely arises from divergent evolution in a common structural scaffold with conserved catalytic machinery and homoserine binding sites.

TI  == succession of dominant and antagonistic lactic acid bacteria in fermented cucumber: insights from a pcr-based approach.
AB  == the goal of the investigation was to study the succession of major groups of lactic acid bacteria (lab) and their antagonism in salt-fermented cucumber using  pcr. in a direct detection method as well as a short enrichment process, pcr enabled detection of leuconostoc and lactobacillus during early hours of fermentation. subsequently, lactobacillus and pediococcus emerged as the dominant genera. nucleic acid sequence of culture-independent clones confirmed the detection of pediococcus as a dominant genera emerging during late stages of fermentation. pcr also revealed time-dependent emergence of mesentericin, pediocin and plantaricin a producers and accounted for the lab succession in the  fermenting samples. a total of 328 lab isolates were obtained collectively from 30 cucumber samples, of which pcr could identify an overwhelming 186 lactobacillus isolates followed by 113 pediococcus and 29 leuconostoc isolates, respectively. based on antimicrobial assay against target strain leuconostoc mesenteroides nrrl b640, 28% of the lab were bacteriocin producers, of which pediocin producers were substantial, followed by plantaricin a and mesentericin producers. the bacteriocins elaborated by the isolates were active against a large number of gram-positive target lab strains and pathogenic bacteria including bacillus cereus, enterobacter aerogenes, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes and staphylococcus aureus.

TI  == inactivation of microbial arginine deiminases by l-canavanine.
AB  == arginine deiminase (adi) catalyzes the hydrolytic conversion of l-arginine to ammonia and l-citrulline as part of the energy-producing l-arginine degradation pathway. the chemical mechanism for adi catalysis involves initial formation and  subsequent hydrolysis of a cys-alkylthiouronium ion intermediate. the structure of the pseudomonas aeruginosa adi-(l-arginine) complex guided the design of arginine analogs that might react with the adis to form inactive covalent adducts during catalytic turnover. one such candidate is l-canavanine, in which an n-methylene of l-arginine is replaced by an n-o. this substance was shown to be a slow substrate-producing o-ureido-l-homoserine. an in depth kinetic and mass spectrometric analysis of p. aeruginosa adi inhibition by l-canavanine showed that two competing pathways are followed that branch at the cys-alkylthiouronium  ion intermediate. one pathway leads to direct formation of o-ureido-l-homoserine  via a reactive thiouronium intermediate. the other pathway leads to an inactive form of the enzyme, which was shown by chemical model and mass spectrometric studies to be a cys-alkylisothiourea adduct. this adduct undergoes slow hydrolysis to form o-ureido-l-homoserine and regenerated enzyme. in contrast, kinetic and mass spectrometric investigations demonstrate that the cys-alkylthiouronium ion intermediate formed in the reaction of l-canavanine with bacillus cereus adi partitions between the product forming pathway (o-ureido-l-homoserine and free enzyme) and an inactivation pathway that leads to a stable cys-alkylthiocarbamate adduct. the adis from escherichia coli, burkholderia mallei, and giardia intestinalis were examined in order to demonstrate the generality of the l-canavanine slow substrate inhibition and to distinguish the kinetic behavior that defines the irreversible inhibition observed with the b. cereus adi from the time controlled inhibition observed with the p. aeruginosa, e. coli, b. mallei, and g. intestinalis adis.

TI  == expression of functional bacillus spoiisab toxin-antitoxin modules in escherichia coli.
AB  == spoiisa and spoiisb proteins from bacillus subtilis belong to a recently described bacterial programmed-cell death system. the current work demonstrates that the toxin-antitoxin module is also functional in escherichia coli cells, where the expression of spoiisa toxin leads to transient growth arrest coupled with cell lysis, and spoiisa-induced death can be prevented by coexpression of its cognate antitoxin, spoiisb. escherichia coli cells appear to be able to escape the spoiisa killing by activation of a specific, as yet unidentified protease that cleaves out the cytosolic part of the protein. analysis of the toxic effects of the transmembrane and cytosolic portions of spoiisa showed that  neither of them separately can function as a toxin; therefore, both parts of the  protein have to act in concert to exert the killing. this work also identifies genes encoding putative homologues of spoiisa and spoiisb proteins on chromosomes of other bacilli species. the spoiisa-like proteins from bacillus anthracis and bacillus cereus were shown to manifest the same effect on the viability of e. coli as their homologue from b. subtilis. moreover, expression of the proposed spoiisb-like gene rescues e. coli cells from death induced by the spoiisa homologue.

TI  == genetic and biochemical characterization of cad-1, a chromosomally encoded new class a penicillinase from carnobacterium divergens.
AB  == carnobacterium divergens clinical isolates bm4489 and bm4490 were resistant to penicillins but remained susceptible to combinations of amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and piperacillin-tazobactam. cloning and sequencing of the responsible determinant from bm4489 revealed a coding sequence of 912 bp encoding a class a beta-lactamase named cad-1. the bla(cad-1) gene was assigned to a chromosomal location in the two strains that had distinct pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns. cad-1 shared 53% and 42% identity with beta-lactamases from bacillus cereus and staphylococcus aureus, respectively. alignment of cad-1 with other class a beta-lactamases indicated the presence of 25 out of the 26 isofunctional  amino acids in class a beta-lactamases. escherichia coli harboring bla(cad-1) exhibited resistance to penams (benzylpenicillin and amoxicillin) and remained susceptible to amoxicillin in combination with clavulanic acid. mature cad-1 consisted of a 34.4-kda polypeptide. kinetic analysis indicated that cad-1 exhibited a narrow substrate profile, hydrolyzing benzylpenicillin, ampicillin, and piperacillin with catalytic efficiencies of 6,600, 3,200, and 2,900 mm(-1) s(-1), respectively. the enzyme did not interact with oxyiminocephalosporins, imipenem, or aztreonam. cad-1 was inhibited by tazobactam (50% inhibitory concentration [ic(50)] = 0.27 microm), clavulanic acid (ic(50) = 4.7 microm), and sulbactam (ic(50) = 43.5 microm). the bla(cad-1) gene is likely to have been acquired by bm4489 and bm4490 as part of a mobile genetic element, since it was not found in the susceptible type strain cip 101029 and was adjacent to a gene for a resolvase.

TI  == human chitotriosidase is expressed in the eye and lacrimal gland and has an antimicrobial spectrum different from lysozyme.
AB  == chitotriosidase is a chitinolytic enzyme expressed by maturing macrophages and preformed in neutrophil granules, suggesting a role in antimicrobial defence. although available evidence supports a role in anti-fungal immunity, there is a lack of an obvious phenotype in humans homozygous for a mutation which renders chitotriosidase inactive. this may be explained by compensatory effects of enzymes co-expressed with chitotriosidase, such as lysozyme. we have found that chitinase is highly expressed in mouse and human eye, particularly in lacrimal glands. chitotriosidase is the only member of the chitinase/chilectin gene cluster expressed in the murine eye. as lacrimal glands also produce lysozyme, we have asked whether chitotriosidase, in addition to its documented anti-fungal effects, has synergistic anti-bacterial properties with lysozyme. the effect of recombinant chitotriosidase on the growth of five gram-positive (bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, listeria innocua, staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus aureus oata(+/-)) and two gram-negative strains (escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa), were tested in a luminometric assay. recombinant chitotriosidase did not inhibit bacterial growth and did not synergize with lysozyme. though the expression of chitotriosidase in the eye supports a role in innate immunity, the  antimicrobial spectrum appears to be complementary to lysozyme and may indeed be  limited to fungi.

TI  == biological activity of phenylpropionic acid isolated from a terrestrial streptomycetes.
AB  == the strain anu 6277 was isolated from laterite soil and identified as streptomyces sp. closely related to streptomyces albidoflavus cluster by 16s rrna analysis. the cultural, morphological and physiological characters of the strain  were recorded. the strain exhibited resistance to chloramphenicol, penicillin and streptomycin. it had the ability to produce enzymes such as amylase and chitinase. a bioactive compound was isolated from the strain at stationary phase  of culture and identified as 3-phenylpropionic acid (3-ppa) by ft-ir, ei-ms, 1h nmr and 13c nmr spectral studies. it exhibited antimicrobial activity against different bacteria like bacillus cereus, b. subtilis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris, pseudomonas aeruginosa, p. flourescens,  staphylococcus aureus and some fungi including aspergillus flavus, a. niger, candida albicans, fusarium oxysporum, f. udum and penicillium citrinum. the antifungal activity of 3-ppa of the strain was evaluated in in vivo and in vitro  conditions against fusarium udum causing wilt disease in pigeon pea. the compound 3-ppa is an effective antifungal agent when compared to tricyclozole (fungicide)  to control wilt caused by f. udum, but it exhibited less antifungal activity than carbendazim.

TI  == antibacterial activity of guava (psidium guajava l.) and neem (azadirachta indica a. juss.) extracts against foodborne pathogens and spoilage bacteria.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of guava (psidium guajava) and neem (azadirachta indica) extracts against 21 strains of foodborne pathogens were determined--listeria monocytogenes (five strains), staphylococcus aureus (four strains), escherichia coli o157:h7 (six strains), salmonella enteritidis (four strains), vibrio parahaemolyticus, and bacillus cereus, and five food spoilage bacteria: pseudomonas aeroginosa, p. putida, alcaligenes faecalis, and aeromonas  hydrophila (two strains). guava and neem extracts showed higher antimicrobial activity against gram-positive bacteria compared to gram-negative bacteria except for v. parahaemolyticus, p. aeroginosa, and a. hydrophila. none of the extracts showed antimicrobial activity against e. coli o157:h7 and salmonella enteritidis. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of ethanol extracts of guava showed the highest inhibition for l. monocytogenes jcm 7676 (0.1 mg/ml), s. aureus jcm 2151 (0.1 mg/ml), s. aureus jcm 2179 (0.1 mg/ml), and v. parahaemolyticus ifo 12711 (0.1 mg/ml) and the lowest inhibition for alcaligenes faecalis ifo 12669, aeromonas hydrophila nfri 8282 (4.0 mg/ml), and a. hydrophila nfri 8283 (4.0 mg/ml). the mic of chloroform extracts of neem showed similar inhibition for l. monocytogenes atcc 43256 (4.0 mg/ml) and l. monocytogenes atcc 49594 (5.0 mg/ml). however, ethanol extracts of neem showed higher inhibition for s. aureus jcm 2151 (4.5 mg/ml) and s. aureus ifo 13276 (4.5 mg/ml) and the lower inhibition for other microorganisms (6.5 mg/ml). no significant effects of temperature and ph were found on guava and neem extracts against cocktails of l. monocytogenes and s. aureus. the results of the present study suggest that guava and neem extracts  possess compounds containing antibacterial properties that can potentially be useful to control foodborne pathogens and spoilage organisms.

TI  == identification and expression of gh-8 family chitosanases from several bacillus thuringiensis subspecies.
AB  == the gram-positive spore-forming bacterium, bacillus thuringiensis, a member of the bacillus cereus group, produces chitosanases that catalyze the hydrolysis of  chitosan to chitosan-oligosaccharides (cos). although fungal and bacterial chitosanases belonging to other glycoside hydrolase (gh) families have been characterized in a variety of microorganisms, knowledge on the genetics and phylogeny of the gh-8 chitosanases remains limited. nine genes encoding chitosanases were cloned from 29 different serovar strains of b. thuringiensis and they were expressed in escherichia coli. the orfs of the chitosanases contained 1,359 nucleotides and the protein products had high levels of sequence  identity (>96%) to other bacillus species gh-8 chitosanases. thin-layer chromatography and hplc analyses demonstrated that these enzymes hydrolyzed chitosan to a chitosan-trimer and a chitosan-tetramer as major products, and this could be useful in the production of cos. in addition, a simple plate assay was developed, involving a soluble chitosan, for high-throughput screening of chitosanases. this system allowed screening for mutant enzymes with higher enzyme activity generated by error-prone pcr, indicating that it can be used for directed chitosanase evolution.

TI  == potential and limitation of uvc irradiation for the inactivation of pathogens in  platelet concentrates.
AB  == background: pathogen contamination, causing transfusion-transmitted diseases, is  an ongoing concern in transfusion of cellular blood products. in this explorative study, the pathogen-inactivating capacity of uvc irradiation in platelet (plt) concentrates was investigated. the dose dependencies of inactivation of several viruses and bacteria were compared with the effect on plt quality. study design and methods: the potential of uvc irradiation was studied with a range of lipid-enveloped (le) and non-lipid-enveloped viruses (nle) and bacteria. le viruses were bovine viral diarrhea virus (bvdv), human immunodeficiency virus (hiv), pseudorabies virus (prv), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (tgev), and  vesicular stomatitis virus (vsv). nle viruses were canine parvovirus (cpv) and simian virus 40 (sv40). bacteria were staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus  aureus, escherichia coli, and bacillus cereus. after spiking and irradiation, samples were tested for residual infectivity and reduction factors (rfs) were calculated. furthermore, the effect of uvc irradiation on plt quality was determined by measuring in vitro quality variables. results: a uvc dose of 500 j  per m(2) resulted in acceptable plt quality (as measured by ph, lactate production, cd62p expression, and exposure of phosphatidylserine) and high rfs (>4 log) for cpv, tgev, vsv, s. epidermidis, s. aureus, and e. coli. intermediate rfs (approx. 3 log) were observed for bvdv, prv, and b. cereus. low rfs (approx.  1 log) were found for hiv and sv40. no differences in virus reduction were observed between cell-free and cell-associated virus. conclusion: uvc irradiation is a promising pathogen-reducing technique in plt concentrates, inactivating bacteria, and a broad range of viruses (with the exception of hiv) under conditions that have limited effects on plt quality. further optimization of the  uvc procedure, however, is necessary to deal with blood-borne viruses like hiv.

TI  == [investigation of a foodborne intoxication in a high-density penitentiary center].
AB  == background: on september 25 2005, more than 100 inmates (almost 5% of the 1,800 prison population) experienced sudden onset gastroenteritis. this outbreak was the largest foodborne outbreak described in a prison population in spain. our objective was to confirm the outbreak, identify risk factors, implement control measures, and provide recommendations. methods: we conducted a cohort analysis of a stratified random sample of all the inmates, a cohort analysis of the one of the prison blocks, and an environmental investigation. results: a total of 221 inmates were selected, of which 196 were interviewed. twenty-eight percent had gastroenteritis and the main symptoms were abdominal pain (85%) and diarrhea (71%). all foods consumed caused similar attack rates. factors associated with the risk of illness were eating the entire portion of seafood cocktail at lunch or all of the fried shrimp at dinner on september 24 (rr = 2; 95% ci, 1.1-3.8, and rr = 1.8; 95% ci, 1.1-3.1). analysis of one of the prison blocks yielded results similar to those of the random sample. clostridium perfringens, bacillus  cereus and escherichia coli were isolated from a sample of the seafood cocktail.  conclusion: a gastroenteritis outbreak caused by several pa-thogens was confirmed. both the reported symptoms and the calculated incubation periods corresponded to the pathogens isolated. preparation of food in prison facilities  should meet minimum safety standards, including refrigeration and training of food handlers.

TI  == recipes for antimicrobial wine marinades against bacillus cereus, escherichia coli o157:h7, listeria monocytogenes, and salmonella enterica.
AB  == we have evaluated bactericidal activities against bacillus cereus, escherichia coli o157:h7, listeria monocytogenes, and salmonella enterica of several antimicrobial wine recipes, each consisting of red or white wine extracts of oregano leaves with added garlic juice and oregano oil. dose-response plots were  used to determine the percentage of the recipes that resulted in a 50% decrease in colony-forming units (cfu) at 60 min (ba(50)). studies designed to optimize antibacterial activities of the recipes demonstrated that several combinations of the naturally occurring plant-derived ingredients rapidly inactivated the above mentioned 4 foodborne pathogens. we also showed that (a) incubation temperature affected activities in the following order: 37 degrees c > 21 degrees c > 4 degrees c; (b) varying the initial bacterial concentrations from 10(3) to 10(4) to 10(5) cfu/well did not significantly affect ba(50) values; (c) storage of 3 marinades up to 2 mo did not change their effectiveness against salmonella enterica; and (d) polyphenolic compounds isolated by chromatography from red wine exhibited exceptional activity at nanogram levels against 2 strains of bacillus cereus. these observations suggest that antimicrobial wine formulations have the  potential to improve the microbiological safety of foods.

TI  == effects of low electric current (lec) treatment on pure bacterial cultures.
AB  == aims: this research focused on the effects of low electric current (lec) on the cell viability and metabolic activity of escherichia coli and bacillus cereus. methods and results: different lec intensities at fixed amperage were applied, employing either graphite or copper electrode pairs, and the effects were determined by conventional cultural methods and bioindicators. on e. coli, the lec with graphite electrodes at 5 and 10 ma led to no significant variation, but  at 20 and 40 ma there was increasing inhibition of both the enzymatic activities  and growth, and a reduction in atp content. on b. cereus, similar experiments at  the lower amperages did not have any inhibitor effects, however, the 40 ma current stimulated growth, atp content and some enzymatic activities. the lec treatment using copper electrodes caused, already at 5 ma, inhibition of bacterial growth and metabolic and enzymatic activities in both e. coli and b. cereus. conclusions: on the basis of the obtained results using different amperages and electrodes, we can conclude that e. coli seem to be more sensitive  compared with b. cereus. significance and impact of the study: the study increases the knowledge on lec treatment effects on the pure bacterial cultures.

TI  == cloning, expression and characterization of a fast self-sufficient p450: cyp102a5 from bacillus cereus.
AB  == cyp102s represent a family of natural self-sufficient fusions of cytochrome p450  and cytochrome p450 reductase found in some bacteria. one member of this family,  named cyp102a1 or more traditionally p450bm-3, has been widely studied as a model of human p450 cytochromes. remarkable detail of p450 structure and function has been revealed using this highly efficient enzyme. the recent rapid expansion of microbial genome sequences has revealed many relatives of cyp102a1, but to date only two from bacillus subtilis have been characterized. we report here the cloning and expression of cyp102a5, a new member of this family that is very closely related to cyp102a4 from bacillus anthracis. characterization of the substrate specificity of cyp102a5 shows that it, like the other cyp102s, will metabolize saturated and unsaturated fatty acids as well as n-acylamino acids. cyp102a5 catalyzes very fast substrate oxidation, showing one of the highest turnover rates for any p450 monooxygenase studied so far. it does so with more specificity than other cyp102s, yielding primarily omega-1 and omega-2 hydroxylated products. measurement of the rate of electron transfer through the reductase domain reveals that it is significantly faster in cyp102a5 than in cyp102a1, providing a likely explanation for the increased monooxygenation rate.  the availability of this new, very fast fusion p450 will provide a great tool for comparative structure-function studies between cyp102a5 and the other characterized cyp102s.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of two antitumour agents and ribonucleotide reductase inhibitors, pyridine-2-carboxaldehyde thiosemicarbazone and the acetate form of its copper(ii) chelate.
AB  == some copper chelates have potent antitumour activity, and in some cases also the  free ligands have activity in vivo. yet, little is known about their antimicrobial properties. copper(ii) chelates of the thiosemicarbazones of a-n-heterocyclic carboxaldehydes constitute one important group of such agents, also their ligands having marked antitumour activity. both the ligands and chelates inhibit ribonucleotide reductase. some ligands have been or are under clinical trials as antineoplastic agents. i report here a study on the antimicrobial properties of the prototype compounds of this group, pyridine-2-carboxaldehyde thiosemicarbazone and its copper(ii) chelate. they were tested against nine microbes, including bacteria (bacillus cereus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and streptococcus lactis), yeasts (candida albicans and saccharomyces cerevisiae) and one mold (aspergillus niger). two clinical isolates of bacillus sp. and one reference strain were also studied. both the ligand and the chelate had marked activity. the ligand displayed considerable activity against all bacteria except  for s. lactis, and its activity against e. coli and p. aeruginosa was that high that practical applications might be considued. it was highly active against a. niger and moderately active against c. albicans. the chelate was highly active against s. epidermidis and s. cerevisiae. both compounds inhibited the clinical isolates markedly. since some related ligands have been or are in clinical trials on humans or are entering them, their route to clinical use, also as antimicrobials, might be much more straightforward than that of substances, whose toxicity in humans is wholly unexplored.

TI  == antimicrobial properties of substituted salicylaldehydes and related compounds.
AB  == a systematic survey of the antimicrobial properties of substituted salicylaldehydes and some related aromatic aldehydes is reported. a total of 23 different compounds, each at four different concentrations, were studied using a  panel of seven microbes (aspergillus niger, bacillus cereus, candida albicans, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, saccharomyces cerevisiae and staphylococcus epidermidis) and employing the paper disc agar diffusion method. several aldehydes, most notably halogenated, nitro-substituted and hydroxylated salicylaldehydes, displayed highly potent activity against the microbes studied,  giving inhibitory zones up to 49 mm in diameter (paper disc diameter 6 mm), while unsubstituted benzaldehyde and salicylaldehyde had minimal activity. further, 4,6-dimethoxysalicylaldehyde had considerable activity against c albicans and slight activity against s. cerevisiae, while displaying minimal activity against  bacteria. also two aromatic dialdehydes had interesting activity. in general, p.  aeruginosa was the least sensitive microbe, a result that is in line with observations from a large screening project, in which this microbe was the one against which the least number of active substances was found. interestingly, the structure-activity relationships of the aldehydes studied were clearly different  for different microbes. many of the aldehydes tested had such high antimicrobial  activity that they are noteworthy candidates for practical applications as well as interesting lead compounds for the development of novel antimicrobial drugs and disinfectants. the structure-activity relationships are discussed in detail.  for high activity, substituents are required in benzaldehyde as well as in its 2-hydroxy derivative salicylaldehyde. one hydroxy group alone (at the 2-position) is not enough, but further hydroxylation may produce high activity. the effects of substituents are in some cases dramatic. halogenation, hydroxylation and nitro substitution may produce highly active compounds, but the effects are not easily  predicted nor can they be extrapolated from one microbe to another.

TI  == carbohydrazones of substituted salicylaldehydes as potential lead compounds for the development of narrow-spectrum antimicrobials.
AB  == certain substituted salicylaldehydes are known to have highly potent antimicrobial activity against bacteria and fungi, but the mechanism underlying this remarkable activity is not known, and almost nothing has been reported on the effects of further modification of the structures, such as the formation of hydrazone-type derivatives. we report now a study on the antimicrobial properties of the carbohydrazone derivatives of several substituted salicylaldehydes. the compounds studied were synthesized from ring-substituted salicylaldehydes and carbohydrazide in the mole ratio 2:1. they were tested against aspergillus niger, bacillus cereus, candida albicans, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, saccharomyces cerevisiae and staphylococcus epidermidis using the agar diffusion  method. the carbohydrazone derived from 2,3,4-trihydroxybenzaldehyde had distinctly higher activity than the parent aldehyde in the same molar concentration. this activity was limited to one test organism (s. epidermidis), while the free aldehyde had at least some (in some cases even high) activity against all of the microbes studied. all other ones of the effective carbohydrazone compounds were distinctly less active than the parent salicylaldehydes as such. the hydrazones studied had in general a narrower antimicrobial spectrum than the free aldehydes and are thus of interest as potential lead compounds for the development of narrow-spectrum anti-microbial drugs. the mechanism of action of the aldehydes as well as that of the carbohydrazones is discussed.

AB  == the effects of dipping treatments (15 min) in potable water or in solutions (wt/vol) of 12% trisodium phosphate (tsp), 1,200 ppm acidified sodium chlorite (asc), 2% citric acid (ca), and 220 ppm peroxyacids (pa) on inoculated pathogenic bacteria (listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, salmonella enteritidis, escherichia coli, and yersinia enterocolitica) and skin ph were investigated throughout storage of chicken legs (days 0, 1, 3, and 5) at  3 +/- 1 degrees c. all chemical solutions reduced microbial populations (p < 0.001) as compared with the control (untreated) samples. similar bacterial loads  (p > 0.05) were observed on water-dipped and control legs. type of treatment, microbial group, and sampling day influenced microbial counts (p < 0.001). average reductions with regard to control samples were 0.28 to 2.41 log cfu/g with tsp, 0.33 to 3.15 log cfu/g with asc, 0.82 to 1.97 log cfu/g with ca, and 0.07 to 0.96 log cfu/g with pa. average reductions were lower (p < 0.001) for gram-positive (0.96 log cfu/g) than for gram-negative (1.33 log cfu/g) bacteria.  ca and asc were the most effective antimicrobial compounds against gram-positive  and gram-negative bacteria, respectively. tsp was the second most effective compound for both bacterial groups. average microbial reductions per gram of skin were 0.87 log cfu/g with tsp, 0.86 log cfu/g with asc, 1.39 log cfu/g with ca, and 0.74 log cfu/g with pa for gram-positive bacteria, and 1.28 log cfu/g with tsp, 2.03 log cfu/g with asc, 1.23 log cfu/g with ca, and 0.78 log cfu/g with pa  for gram-negative bacteria. with only a few exceptions, microbial reductions in tsp- and asc-treated samples decreased and those in samples treated with ca increased throughout storage. samples treated with tsp and samples dipped in ca and asc had the highest and lowest ph values, respectively, after treatment. the  ph of the treated legs tended to return to normal (6.3 to 6.6) during storage. however, at the end of storage, the ph of legs treated with tsp remained higher and that of legs treated with ca remained lower than normal.

TI  == development of flexible antimicrobial films using essential oils as active agents.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity in the vapor-phase of laboratory-made flexible films of polypropylene (pp) and polyethylene/ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer (pe/evoh) incorporating essential oil of cinnamon ( cinnamomum zeylanicum), oregano ( origanum vulgare), clove ( syzygium aromaticum), or cinnamon fortified with cinnamaldehyde was evaluated against a wide range of microorganisms: the gram-negative bacteria escherichia coli, yersinia enterocolitica, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and salmonella choleraesuis; the gram-positive bacteria listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, and enterococcus faecalis; the molds penicillium islandicum, penicillium roqueforti, penicillium nalgiovense, eurotium repens, and a spergillus flavus and the yeasts candida albicans, debaryomyces hansenii, and zigosaccharomyces rouxii. films with a nominal concentration of 4% (w/w) of fortified cinnamon or oregano essential oil  completely inhibited the growth of the fungi; higher concentrations were required to inhibit the gram-positive bacteria (8 and 10%, respectively), and higher concentrations still were necessary to inhibit the gram-negative bacteria. pp films were more effective than pe/evoh films. the atmospheres generated by the antimicrobial films inside petri dishes were quantitatively analyzed using headspace-single drop microextraction (hs-sdme) in combination with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (gc-ms). the analyses showed that the oregano-fortified pp films released higher levels of carvacrol and thymol, and the cinnamon-fortified pp films released higher levels of cinnamaldehyde, during  the first 3-6 h of incubation, than the corresponding pe/evoh films. shelf-life tests were also performed, demonstrating that the antifungal activities of the films persisted for more than two months after their manufacture. in addition, migration tests (overall and specific) were performed, using both aqueous and fatty simulants, to ensure that the films meet eu regulations regarding food contact materials. following contact with the tested films, the substances that had migrated into the aqueous simulants were recovered by direct immersion-single drop extraction (di-sdme) and then analyzed by gc-ms. the fatty stimulant (isooctane) was directly injected into the chromatographic system.

TI  == construction, crystal structure and application of a recombinant protein that lacks the collagen-like region of bcla from bacillus anthracis spores.
AB  == spores of bacillus anthracis, the causative agent of anthrax, are enclosed by an  exosporium, which consists of a basal layer surrounded by a nap of hair-like filaments. the major structural component of the filaments is called bcla, which  comprises a central collagen-like region (clr) and a globular c-terminal domain.  here, the entire clr coding sequence of bcla was removed, and the resulting protein (tbcla) produced in escherichia coli. the crystallographic structure of tbcla was determined to 1.35 a resolution, and consists of an all-beta structure  with a tnf-like jelly fold topology (12 beta-strands which form 2 beta-sheets of  five strands each) consistent with previous studies on wild-type bcla. these globular domains are tightly packed into trimeric structures (surface shape complementarity; s (c) = 0.83), demonstrating that formation of the core structure of bcla is independent of the anchoring collagen-like region. a polyclonal antibody raised against tbcla recognized b. anthracis spores directly, and showed little cross-reactivity (<10%) with the spores of the closely related  species bacillus cereus and bacillus thuringiensis, when compared to two other polyclonal antibodies raised against b. anthracis spore extracts and inactivated  spores. the tbcla protein was used to purify a pool of specific antibodies from bovine colostrum whey samples from cows inoculated with the sterne strain anthrax vaccine, which also showed reactivity with b. anthracis spores. together, these results demonstrate that tbcla provides a safer and more effective way to the production and purification of antibodies with high binding affinity for b. anthracis spores. biotechnol. bioeng. 2008;99: 774-782.

TI  == phenolic compounds and antimicrobial activity of olive (olea europaea l. cv. cobrancosa) leaves.
AB  == we report the determination of phenolic compounds in olive leaves by reversed-phase hplc/dad, and the evaluation of their in vitro activity against several microorganisms that may be causal agents of human intestinal and respiratory tract infections, namely gram positive (bacillus cereus, b. subtilis  and staphylococcus aureus), gram negative bacteria (pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae) and fungi (candida albicans and cryptococcus neoformans). seven phenolic compounds were identified and quantified: caffeic acid, verbascoside, oleuropein, luteolin 7-o-glucoside, rutin, apigenin 7-o-glucoside and luteolin 4'-o-glucoside. at low concentrations  olive leaves extracts showed an unusual combined antibacterial and antifungal action, which suggest their great potential as nutraceuticals, particularly as a  source of phenolic compounds.

TI  == structure and biological activities of beta toxin from staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == beta toxin is a neutral sphingomyelinase secreted by certain strains of staphylococcus aureus. this virulence factor lyses erythrocytes in order to evade the host immune system as well as scavenge nutrients. the structure of beta toxin was determined at 2.4-a resolution using crystals that were merohedrally twinned. this structure is similar to that of the sphingomyelinases of listeria ivanovii and bacillus cereus. beta toxin belongs to the dnase i folding superfamily; in addition to sphingomyelinases, the proteins most structurally related to beta toxin include human endonuclease hap1, escherichia coli endonuclease iii, bovine  pancreatic dnase i, and the endonuclease domain of tras1 from bombyx mori. our biological assays demonstrated for the first time that beta toxin kills proliferating human lymphocytes. structure-directed active site mutations show that biological activities, including hemolysis and lymphotoxicity, are due to the sphingomyelinase activity of the enzyme.

TI  == food-poisoning and commercial air travel.
AB  == with the introduction of budget airlines and greater competitiveness amongst all  airlines, air travel has now become an extremely popular form of travel, presenting its own unique set of risks from food poisoning. foodborne illness associated with air travel is quite uncommon in the modern era. however, when it  occurs, it may have serious implications for passengers and when crew are affected, has the potential to threaten safety. quality, safe, in-flight catering relies on high standards of food preparation and storage; this applies at the airport kitchens (or at subcontractors' facilities), on the aircraft and in the transportation vehicles which carry the food from the ground source to the aircraft. this is especially challenging in certain countries. several foodborne  outbreaks have been recorded by the airline industry as a result of a number of different failures of these systems. these have provided an opportunity to learn  from past mistakes and current practice has, therefore, reached such a standard so as to minimise risk of failures of this kind. this review examines: (i) the origin of food safety in modern commercial aviation; (ii) outbreaks which have occurred previously relating to aviation travel; (iii) the microbiological quality of food and water on board commercial aircraft; and (iv) how hazard analysis critical control points may be employed to maintain food safety in aviation travel.

TI  == influence of the probiotic bacillus cereus var. toyoi on the intestinal immunity  of piglets.
AB  == in a feeding trial, sows and piglets were fed with the probiotic bacterium bacillus cereus var. toyoi as a feed additive, and the effects on immune cell populations were examined. the development of the gut immune system was determined for piglets at the ages of 14, 28, 35 and 56 days post partum. tissue  samples of the jejunum and the continuous peyer's patch were used for enumeration of intraepithelial lymphocyte populations by fluorescence activated flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy. both independent methods of investigation  led to similar results: the population of intraepithelial cd8+ t cells was significantly enhanced in the probiotic group piglets (p< or =0.05), and the numbers of gammadelta t cells tended to be higher in the intestinal epithelium (p<0.1) at the time of weaning (day 28). lamina propria lymphocytes were also influenced by the treatment. application of b. cereus var. toyoi resulted in significantly more cd25+ lymphocytes and gammadelta t cells in the probiotic group post-weaning. the occurrence of pathogenic escherichia coli serogroups was  also less frequent in the feces of piglets from the probiotic group. the finding  that the cd8+ t cell population in the intestinal mucosa showed changes on day 28 indicated that the influence of b. cereus var. toyoi supplementation on the intestinal immune system started before weaning, an observation supported by changes in the intestinal microflora observed during the suckling-period. the results suggest that feeding of b. cereus var. toyoi to sows may result in beneficial effects on piglet health status independent of their feed supplementation.

TI  == maintenance of sterility in 1-ml polypropylene syringes.
AB  == purpose: the sterility of syringes filled with a growth-promoting broth when stored under various temperature conditions was studied. methods: samples of tryptic soy broth (tsb) were injected into 150 1-ml polypropylene syringes and incubated at 33-37 degrees c for 14 days, after which time they were visually inspected for microbial contamination. in addition to visual inspection, the sterility of all syringes was tested by inoculating samples into 10-ml tubes of thioglycollate broth, incubating at 35 degrees c, and observing for growth for 5  days. after the 14-day incubation period, 30 syringes were removed for sterility  validation and microbial growth promotion. tsb from 15 syringes was transferred into sterile culture tubes and challenged with staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, bacillus cereus, candida albicans, and aspergillus niger. the remaining 120 syringes were repackaged and stored at room temperature (22 degrees c), in a refrigerator (5 degrees c), or in a freezer (-20 degrees c). the sterility of the samples was evaluated at 30 days, 45 days, three months, and six months. results: no microbial growth was detected by visual inspection in any of the 15 syringes examined for turbidity during validation testing. all study syringes (n = 120) remained sterile throughout the respective evaluation periods, regardless of storage condition. conclusion: growth-promoting broth stored in 1-ml polypropylene syringes remained sterile when stored at room temperature, in a refrigerator, or in a freezer for six months.

TI  == a systematic review of the clinical, public health and cost-effectiveness of rapid diagnostic tests for the detection and identification of bacterial intestinal pathogens in faeces and food.
AB  == objectives: to determine the diagnostic accuracy of tests for the rapid diagnosis of bacterial food poisoning in clinical and public health practice and to estimate the cost-effectiveness of these assays in a hypothetical population in order to inform policy on the use of these tests. data sources: studies evaluating diagnostic accuracy of rapid tests were retrieved using electronic databases and handsearching reference lists and key journals. hospital laboratories and test manufacturers were contacted for cost data, and clinicians  involved in the care of patients with food poisoning were invited to discuss the  conclusions of this review using the nominal group technique. review methods: a systematic review of the current medical literature on assays used for the rapid  diagnosis of bacterial food poisoning was carried out. specific organisms under review were salmonella, campylobacter, escherichia coli o157, staphylococcus aureus, clostridium perfringens and bacillus cereus. data extraction was undertaken using standardised data extraction forms. where a sufficient number of studies evaluating comparable tests were identified, meta-analysis was performed. a decision analytic model was developed, using effectiveness data from the review and cost data from hospitals and manufacturers, which contributed to an assessment of the cost-effectiveness of rapid tests in a hypothetical uk population. finally, diagnostic accuracy and cost-effectiveness results were presented to a focus group of gps, microbiologists and consultants in communicable disease control, to assess professional opinion on the use of rapid  tests in the diagnosis of food poisoning. results: good test performance levels were observed with rapid test methods, especially for polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assays. the estimated levels of diagnostic accuracy using the area under the curve of the summary receiver operating characteristic curve was very high. indeed, although traditional culture is the natural reference test to use for comparative statistical analysis, on many occasions the rapid test outperforms culture, detecting additional 'truly' positive cases of food-borne illness. the significance of these additional positives requires further investigation. economic modelling suggests that adoption of rapid tests in combination with routine culture is unlikely to be cost-effective, however, as the cost of rapid technologies decreases; total replacement with rapid technologies may be feasible. conclusions: despite the relatively poor quality of reporting of studies evaluating rapid detection methods, the reviewed evidence shows that pcr  for campylobacter, salmonella and e. coli o157 is potentially very successful in  identifying pathogens, possibly detecting more than the number currently reported using culture. less is known about the benefits of testing for b. cereus, c. perfringens and s. aureus. further investigation is needed on how clinical outcomes may be altered if test results are available more quickly and at a greater precision than in the current practice of bacterial culture.

TI  == broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity of the reactive compounds generated in vitro by manduca sexta phenoloxidase.
AB  == although quinone production and melanin formation are widely recognized as an integral part of the insect defense system, experimental evidence is lacking that the proteolytic activation of prophenoloxidase participates in the direct killing of invading microbes-active phenoloxidase generates quinones that polymerize to form melanin. here, we report the antimicrobial effect of reactive intermediates  produced in phenoloxidase-catalyzed reactions. after being treated with manduca sexta phenoloxidase and dopamine, escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis ceased to grow, whereas the growth of pichia pastoris was slightly affected. microscopic analysis showed melanin deposition on cell surface, aggregation of bacteria, and  loss of cell mobility. viability tests revealed major decreases in the bacterial  colony counts and, since the decrease remained significant after dispersion of the cell clumps, the reactive compounds were surmised to have aggregated and killed e. coli and b. subtilis cells. under the experimental conditions, 60-94% of the gram-negative bacteria (e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and salmonella typhimurium) and 52-99% of the gram-positive bacteria  (bacillus cereus, b. subtilis, micrococcus luteus, and staphylococcus aureus) were killed. in the presence of phenoloxidase, dopamine or 5,6-dihydroxyindole (dhi) exhibited much higher antibacterial activity than l-dopa, n-acetyldopamine  (nada) or n-beta-alanyldopamine (nbad) did, suggesting that dhi and its oxidation products were cytotoxic. the antifungal activity of dhi was detected using p. pastoris, saccharomyces cerevisiae, candida albicans, and beauveria bassiana. these results established that prophenoloxidase activation is an integral component of the insect defense system involving a multitude of enzymes (e.g. proteinases, oxidases, and dopachrome conversion enzyme (dce)), which immobilizes and kills invading microorganisms.

TI  == inhibition of bacterial cell division protein ftsz by cinnamaldehyde.
AB  == cinnamaldehyde is a natural product from spices that inhibits cell separation in  bacillus cereus. cell division is regulated by ftsz, a prokaryotic homolog of tubulin. ftsz assembles into the z-ring at the site of cell division. here, we report the effect of cinnamaldehyde on ftsz and hence on the cell division apparatus. cinnamaldehyde decreases the in vitro assembly reaction and bundling of ftsz. it is found that cinnamaldehyde perturbs the z-ring morphology in vivo and reduces the frequency of the z ring per unit cell length of escherichia coli. in addition, gtp dependent ftsz polymerization is inhibited by cinnamaldehyde. cinnamaldehyde inhibits the rate of gtp hydrolysis and binds ftsz with an affinity constant of 1.0+/-0.2 microm(-1). isothermal titration calorimetry reveals that binding of cinnamaldehyde to ftsz is driven by favorable enthalpic interactions. further, we map the cinnamaldehyde binding region of ftsz, using the saturation transfer difference-nuclear magnetic resonance and an in silico docking model. both predict the cinnamaldehyde binding pocket at the c terminal region involving the t7 loop of ftsz. our results show that cinnamaldehyde binds  ftsz, perturbs the cytokinetic z-ring formation and inhibits its assembly dynamics. this suggests that cinnamaldehyde, a small molecule of plant origin, is a potential lead compound that can be developed as an anti-ftsz agent towards drug design.

TI  == substrate analysis of homoserine acyltransferase from bacillus cereus.
AB  == substrate specificity within the family of enzymes designated as homoserine transsuccinylases is variable, with some organisms utilizing succinyl-coa and other organisms utilizing acetyl-coa. in this study it is shown that the enzyme from bacillus cereus uses acetyl-coa as its acyl donor, but its catalytic rate is significantly lower than other hts family members. bchts is inactivated by both iodoacetamide and diethyl pyrocarbonate and the enzyme can be partially protected from inactivation by the presence of succinyl-coa. this leads to the conclusion that bchts can bind both acetyl-coa and succinyl-coa and suggests that it may represent an intermediate between the succinate-transferring hts family members and the acetate-transferring hts family members. the b. cereus enzyme was unable  to rescue growth of an escherichia coli strain lacking a functional transsuccinylase, however.

TI  == prediction and assignment of function for a divergent n-succinyl amino acid racemase.
AB  == the protein databases contain many proteins with unknown function. a computational approach for predicting ligand specificity that requires only the sequence of the unknown protein would be valuable for directing experiment-based  assignment of function. we focused on a family of unknown proteins in the mechanistically diverse enolase superfamily and used two approaches to assign function: (i) enzymatic assays using libraries of potential substrates, and (ii)  in silico docking of the same libraries using a homology model based on the most  similar (35% sequence identity) characterized protein. the results matched closely; an experimentally determined structure confirmed the predicted structure of the substrate-liganded complex. we assigned the n-succinyl arginine/lysine racemase function to the family, correcting the annotation (l-ala-d/l-glu epimerase) based on the function of the most similar characterized homolog. these studies establish that ligand docking to a homology model can facilitate functional assignment of unknown proteins by restricting the identities of the possible substrates that must be experimentally tested.

TI  == flagellin (flic) protein sequence diversity among bacillus thuringiensis does not correlate with h serotype diversity.
AB  == in escherichia coli, the flic gene encodes flagellin, the protein responsible for eliciting the immunological reaction in h serotyping. here, the presence of the flagellin flic gene was studied in 86 bacillus thuringiensis strains encompassing 67 h serotypes. nineteen strains from four additional species in the b. cereus sensu lato group, b. cereus, b. anthracis, b. mycoides, and b. weihenstephanensis, were added for comparison purposes. the flic genes were amplified, cloned and their nucleotide sequences determined and translated into amino acid sequences. a bootstrapped neighbor-joining tree was generated from the alignment of the translated amino acid sequences of the amplicons. although most  b. thuringiensis h serotypes had different flagellin amino acid sequences, some different b. thuringiensis serovars shared identical flagellin amino acid sequences. in addition, although serovars from the same h serotype were sometimes found clustered together, several serovars from the same h serotype carried flagellins with sufficiently different amino acid sequences as to be located on distant clusters. no correlations could be established between flagellin (flic) protein sequence diversity among b. thuringiensis h serotypes and h serotype diversity. these suggest that the b. thuringiensis flic gene does not code for the flagellin copy responsible for eliciting the immunological reaction in h serotyping. in a previous study, the authors have shown that the b. thuringiensis hag gene codes for the flagellin copy responsible for eliciting the immunological reaction in h serotyping. it is proposed that the b. thuringiensis flic gene studied here be renamed and that the so-called hag gene studied before be renamed flic, both in accordance with the e. coli nomenclature.

TI  == antibacterial properties and major bioactive components of cinnamon stick (cinnamomum burmannii): activity against foodborne pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == cinnamomum burmannii blume (cinnamon stick) from indonesia is a little-investigated spice. in this study, the antibacterial activity, minimum inhibitory concentration (mic), and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) of cinnamon stick extract were evaluated against five common foodborne pathogenic bacteria (bacillus cereus, listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, and salmonella anatum). cinnamon stick extract exhibited significant antibacterial properties. major compounds in cinnamon stick were tentatively identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (gc-ms) and liquid chromatography (lc-ms) as a predominant volatile oil component ((e)-cinnamaldehyde) and several polyphenols (mainly proanthocyanidins and (epi)catechins). both (e)-cinnamaldehyde and proanthocyanidins significantly contributed to the antibacterial properties. additionally, scanning electron microscopy was used to observe morphological changes of bacteria treated with the crude extract of cinnamon stick and its major components. this study suggests that cinnamon stick and its bioactive components have potential for application as natural food preservatives.

TI  == synthesis and antibacterial activity of tert-butyl [1-benzyl-2[(4-aryl-2-thiazolyl)hydrazono]ethyl]carbamate derivatives.
AB  == the increasing clinical importance of drug-resistant fungal and bacterial pathogens has lent additional urgency to microbiological research and new antibacterial compound development. for this purpose, new tert-butyl[1-benzyl-2[(4-aryl-2-thiazolyl)hydrazono]ethyl]carbamate derivatives were synthesized and evaluated for antibacterial activity. the reaction of boc-l-phenylalaninal with thiosemicarbazide gave the thiosemicarbazone which furnished the title compounds by reaction with phenacyl bromides. the newly synthesized compounds were screened for antibacterial activity and toxicity. while microdilution broth susceptibility assay was used for the antibacterial activity evaluation of the compounds against the strains e. coli (nrrl b-3704), m. luteus (nrrl b-4375), b. cereus (nrrl b-3711), p. aeruginosa (nrrl b-23), and  s. fecalis (nrrl b-14617), the artemia salina 96-well assay was used to determine cytotoxicities of the compounds. observations obtained from the bioassays showed  that some of the compounds are highly active against e. coli, m. luteus, and b. cereus when compared with the control agent and showed low toxicity.

TI  == a functional homing endonuclease in the bacillus anthracis nrde group i intron.
AB  == the essential bacillus anthracis nrde gene carries a self-splicing group i intron with a putative homing endonuclease belonging to the giy-yig family. here, we show that the nrde pre-mrna is spliced and that the homing endonuclease cleaves an intronless nrde gene 5 nucleotides (nt) upstream of the intron insertion site, producing 2-nt 3' extensions. we also show that the sequence required for efficient cleavage spans at least 4 bp upstream and 31 bp downstream of the cleaved coding strand. the position of the recognition sequence in relation to the cleavage position is as expected for a giy-yig homing endonuclease. interestingly, nrde genes from several other bacillaceae were also susceptible to cleavage, with those of bacillus cereus, staphylococcus epidermidis (nrde1), b. anthracis, and bacillus thuringiensis serovar konkukian being better substrates than those of bacillus subtilis, bacillus lichenformis, and s. epidermidis (nrde2). on the other hand, nrde genes from lactococcus lactis, escherichia coli, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, and corynebacterium ammoniagenes were not cleaved. intervening sequences (ivss) residing in protein-coding genes are often found in enzymes involved in dna metabolism, and the ribonucleotide reductase nrde gene is a frequent target for self-splicing ivss. a comparison of  nrde genes from seven gram-positive low-g+c bacteria, two bacteriophages, and nocardia farcinica showed five different insertion sites for self-splicing ivss within the coding region of the nrde gene.

TI  == vapor-phase activities of cinnamon, thyme, and oregano essential oils and key constituents against foodborne microorganisms.
AB  == the aim of the study presented here was to gain knowledge about the vapor-phase antimicrobial activity of selected essential oils and their major putatively active constituents against a range of foodborne bacterial and fungal strains. in a first step, the vapor-phase antimicrobial activities of three commercially available essential oils (eos)-cinnamon (cinnamomum zeylanicum), thyme (thymus vulgaris), and oregano (origanum vulgare)-were evaluated against a wide range of  microorganisms, including gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, yersinia enterocolitica, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and salmonella choleraesuis), gram-positive bacteria (listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, and enterococcus faecalis), molds (penicillium islandicum and aspergillus flavus), and a yeast (candida albicans). the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were generally lower for oregano eo than for the thyme and cinnamon eos, especially against the relatively resistant gram-negative. the persistence of the eos' antimicrobial activities over time was assessed, and changes in the composition of the atmosphere they generated over time were determined using single-drop microextraction (sdme) in combination with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (gc-ms) and subsequent analysis of the data by principal component analysis (pca). more relevant chemicals were selected. in addition, the vapor-phase activities of putatively key constituents of the oils were screened against representative gram-positive (l. monocytogenes) and gram-negative (s. choleraesuis) bacteria, a mold (a. flavus), and a yeast (c. albicans). of the tested compounds, cinnamaldehyde, thymol, and carvacrol showed the strongest antimicrobial effectiveness, so their mics, defined as the minimum vapor concentrations that completely inhibited detectable growth of the microorganisms, were calculated. to check for possible interactions between components present in the eos, cinnamon eo was fortified with cinnamaldehyde and thyme eo with thymol,  and then the antimicrobial activities of the fortified oils were compared to those of the respective unfortified eos using fractional inhibitory concentration (fic) indices and by plotting inhibition curves as functions of the vapor-phase concentrations. synergistic effects were detected for cinnamaldehyde on a. flavus and for thymol on l. monocytogenes, s. choleraesuis, and a. flavus. in all other  cases the fortification had additive effects, except for cinnamaldehyde's activity against s. choleraesuis, for which the effect was antagonistic. finally, various microorganisms were found to cause slight changes over time to the atmospheres generated by all of the eos (fortified and unfortified) except the fortified cinnamon eo.

TI  == asp-120 locates zn2 for optimal metallo-beta-lactamase activity.
AB  == metallo-beta-lactamases are zinc-dependent hydrolases that inactivate beta-lactam antibiotics, rendering bacteria resistant to them. asp-120 is fully conserved in  all metallo-beta-lactamases and is central to catalysis. several roles have been  proposed for asp-120, but so far there is no agreed consensus. we generated four  site-specifically substituted variants of the enzyme bcii from bacillus cereus as follows: d120n, d120e, d120q, and d120s. replacement of asp-120 by other residues with very different metal ligating capabilities severely impairs the lactamase activity without abolishing metal binding to the mutated site. a kinetic study of these mutants indicates that asp-120 is not the proton donor, nor does it play an essential role in nucleophilic activation. spectroscopic and crystallographic analysis of d120s bcii, the least active mutant bearing the weakest metal ligand  in the series, reveals that this enzyme is able to accommodate a dinuclear center and that perturbations in the active site are limited to the zn2 site. it is proposed that the role of asp-120 is to act as a strong zn2 ligand, locating this ion optimally for substrate binding, stabilization of the development of a partial negative charge in the beta-lactam nitrogen, and protonation of this atom by a zinc-bound water molecule.

AB  == this study was conducted to determine the efficacy of a one atmosphere uniform glow discharge plasma (oaugdp) for inactivation of foodborne pathogens and to evaluate the influence of growth temperature, ph, and culture age on their inactivation. escherichia coli o157:h7, listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, salmonella enteritidis, vibrio parahaemolyticus, yersinia enterocolitica, and shigella flexneri were evaluated. three-strain mixtures of each bacterium were inoculated (6-7 log cfu/cm(2)) onto microscope slides containing nonselective agar media adjusted to ph 5 or 7. samples were exposed to plasma for 0-240 sec immediately, or after incubation for 24 h at 10 degrees c or 35 degrees c. after exposure, the agar was removed from the slides and pummeled in 0.1% peptone water with a stomacher, serially diluted, surface plated onto nonselective media, and incubated at 35 degrees c. exposure time, ph, incubation temperature, and culture age affected survival of all pathogens exposed to plasma (p < 0.05). the greatest reduction of pathogens generally occurred during the initial exposure time of 30 or 90 sec. pathogens incubated for 24 h before exposure were more resistant than those exposed immediately after inoculation. incubation at 35 degrees c before exposure resulted in greater resistance to plasma inactivation than incubation at 10 degrees c. no appreciable differences between gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens were observed, although the spore-forming b. cereus was more resistant to plasma than non-spore-formers. these findings support the potential for plasma treatment of foods or surfaces for pathogen reduction. increased sensitivity of pathogens to plasma at reduced ph and temperature is encouraging, since these conditions are applicable to many foods during processing, handling, and storage.

TI  == titanium dioxide/uv photocatalytic disinfection in fresh carrots.
AB  == increased occurrences of fresh produce-related outbreaks of foodborne illness have focused attention on effective washing processes for fruits and vegetables.  a titanium dioxide (tio2) photocatalytic reaction under uv radiation provides a high rate of disinfection. the photo-killing effects of tio2 on bacteria in liquid cultures under experimental conditions have been widely studied. however,  the disinfection effects of the tio2 photocatalytic reaction on fresh vegetables  during a washing process have not been evaluated. our objectives were to design a pilot-scale tio2/uv photocatalytic reactor for fresh carrots and to compare the bactericidal effects of the tio2/uv reaction against bacteria in liquid media and on carrots. tio2/uv photocatalytic reactions for 40, 60, and 30 s were required for the complete killing of escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, and bacillus cereus (initial counts of approximately 6.7 log cfu/ml), respectively. the counts of total aerobic bacteria in fresh carrots and foodborne pathogenic bacteria in inoculated carrots were also measured. counts of total aerobic bacteria were reduced by 1.8 log cfu/g after tio2/uv photocatalytic disinfection  for 20 min compared with a 1.1-log cfu/g reduction by uv alone. e. coli, salmonella typhimurium, and b. cereus (8 log cfu/ml) were inoculated onto carrots, and the number of surviving bacteria in carrots was determined after treatment. the tio2/uv treatment exhibited 2.1-, 2.3-, and 1.8-log cfu/g reductions in the counts of e. coli, salmonella typhimurium, and b. cereus, respectively, compared with 1.3-, 1.2-, and 1.2-log cfu/g reductions by uv alone. the tio2/uv photocatalyst reaction showed significant bactericidal effects, indicating that this process is applicable to nonthermal disinfection of fresh vegetables.

AB  == pepsin (ec 3.4.4.1) from porcine stomach mucosa caused depolymerization of a chitosan sample (a copolymer of glucosamine and n-acetylglucosamine linked by beta-1-4-glycosidic bonds). n-terminal sequence and zymogram analyses confirmed dual (proteolytic and chitosanolytic) activities of pepsin. optimum depolymerization occurred at ph 5.0 and 45 degrees c with an activity of 4.98 u.  low molecular weight chitosan (lmwc), the major depolymerization product, was obtained in a yield of 75-82%, the degree of polymerization of which depended on  reaction time. the lmwc showed a nearly 10-14-fold decrease in the molecular mass as compared to native chitosan, which was also confirmed by gpc and hplc analyses. ir and 13c nmr spectra indicated a decrease in the degree of acetylation (da, approximately 13.4-18.8%) as compared to native chitosan (approximately 25.7%), which was in accordance with the cd analysis. native chitosan had a crystallinity index (cri) of approximately 70%, whereas there was  a decrease in the cri of lmwc (approximately 61%). the latter showed a better bactericidal activity toward both bacillus cereus and escherichia coli, which was more toward the former. the bactericidal activity was essentially due to the lytic and not static effect of lmwc, as evidenced by the pore formation on the bacterial cell surface when observed under sem. this study suggests the possible  use of pepsin in place of chitosanase, which is expensive and unavailable in bulk quantities for the production of lmwc of desired molecular mass that has diversified applications in various fields.

AB  == the genotypic and phenotypic variability of 40 lactococcus lactis isolates obtained from three cheese-making trials of batzos cheese made one in each, winter, spring and summer was investigated. rapd-pcr, plasmid profiling and pfge  were used to study the genetic variability and distinguish closely related isolates. results showed a high degree of heterogeneity among strains. according  to pfge data, all strains except one were clustered together (at a similarity level of approximately 50%) with the l. lactis subsp. lactis reference strain and eleven groups of isolates consisting of 2-8 strains each were distinguished. plasmid profiling results revealed that there were eight isolates lacking plasmids and nine having unique plasmids. twenty-three isolates were allocated into six groups. there was an interesting similarity between the plasmid profiling groups and those formed according to pfge. clustering of strains according to rapd-pcr was in agreement with results obtained by both plasmid profiling and pfge for the majority of the strains. in addition, results obtained by molecular methods indicate a grouping of most of the strains according to the  season of cheese production. all strains inhibited the growth of escherichia coli o157:h7. their ability to affect the growth of yersinia enterocolitica, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, listeria monocytogenes and enterococcus faecalis was strain dependent. in 42.5% of the isolates high acidifying ability in milk after 24 h was recorded and these were isolates, mainly, from fresh cheese. the 75% of the isolates from winter cheese exhibited higher lys- than leu-aminopeptidase activity while the approximately 67% of the isolates from summer cheese showed higher leu- than lys-aminopeptidase activity. their caseinolytic activity after growth in milk for 24 h was significant with preference for alpha(s)-casein degradation. the majority (90%) of the strains formed methanethiol from methionine and this ability was strain dependent. these  results suggest that among the wild lactococcal population from batzos cheese there are interesting strains appropriate to be used as starters for the dairy industry.

TI  == low molecular weight chitosans--preparation with the aid of pronase, characterization and their bactericidal activity towards bacillus cereus and escherichia coli.
AB  == the homogeneous low molecular weight chitosans (lmwc) of molecular weight 9.5-8.5 kda, obtained by pronase catalyzed non-specific depolymerization (at ph 3.5, 37 degrees c) of chitosan showed lyses of bacillus cereus and escherichia coli more  efficiently (100%) than native chitosan (<50%). ir and (1)h-nmr data showed decrease in the degree of acetylation (14-19%) in lmwc compared to native chitosan ( approximately 26%). minimum inhibitory concentration of lmwc towards 10(6) cfu ml(-1) of b. cereus was 0.01% (w/v) compared to 0.03% for 10(4) cfu ml(-1) of e. coli. sem revealed pore formation as well as permeabilization of the bacterial cells, as also evidenced by increased carbohydrate and protein contents as well as the cytoplasmic enzymes in the cell-free supernatants. n-terminal sequence analyses of the released proteins revealed them to be cytoplasmic/membrane proteins. upon glc, the supernatant showed characteristic fatty acid profiles in e. coli, thus subscribing to detachment of lipopolysaccharides into the medium, whereas that of b. cereus indicated release  of surface lipids. the mechanism for the observed bactericidal activity of lmwc towards both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria has been discussed.

TI  == detection of vibrio cholerae by real-time nucleic acid sequence-based amplification.
AB  == a multitarget molecular beacon-based real-time nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (nasba) assay for the specific detection of vibrio cholerae has been developed. the genes encoding the cholera toxin (ctxa), the toxin-coregulated pilus (tcpa; colonization factor), the ctxa toxin regulator (toxr), hemolysin (hlya), and the 60-kda chaperonin product (groel) were selected as target sequences for detection. the beacons for the five different genetic targets were evaluated by serial dilution of rna from v. cholerae cells. rnase treatment of the nucleic acids eliminated all nasba, whereas dnase treatment had  no effect, showing that rna and not dna was amplified. the specificity of the assay was investigated by testing several isolates of v. cholerae, other vibrio species, and bacillus cereus, salmonella enterica, and escherichia coli strains.  the toxr, groel, and hlya beacons identified all v. cholerae isolates, whereas the ctxa and tcpa beacons identified the o1 toxigenic clinical isolates. the nasba assay detected v. cholerae at 50 cfu/ml by using the general marker groel and tcpa that specifically indicates toxigenic strains. a correlation between cell viability and nasba was demonstrated for the ctxa, toxr, and hlya targets. rna isolated from different environmental water samples spiked with v. cholerae was specifically detected by nasba. these results indicate that nasba can be used in the rapid detection of v. cholerae from various environmental water samples. this method has a strong potential for detecting toxigenic strains by using the tcpa and ctxa markers. the entire assay including rna extraction and nasba was completed within 3 h.

TI  == antimicrobial and cytotoxic knotwood extracts and related pure compounds and their effects on food-associated microorganisms.
AB  == knotwood or bark extracts prepared from 30 species of hard and soft wood trees as well as selected pure compounds (lignans, stilbenes and flavonoids) were assayed  for their antimicrobial activity against a battery of both gram positive and negative bacteria, yeasts, and filamentous fungi (bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, listeria monocytogenes, lactobacillus plantarum, escherichia coli, salmonella infantis, pseudomonas fluorescens, candida albicans, saccharomyces cerevisiae, aspergillus fumigatus and penicillium brevicompactum). by far the most consistent antibacterial and antifungal properties were associated with extracts of pinus species. these extracts showed also cytotoxicity against a mouse hepatoma cell line. both antimicrobial and cytotoxic properties correlated  with the stilbene content of the extracts. purified stilbenes showed the most consistent antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities, while purified lignans had marginal effects, only. the results suggest that stilbenes account both for the antimicrobial and cytotoxic properties of pinus knotwood extracts.

TI  == survival and growth of foodborne pathogens during cooking and storage of oriental-style rice cakes.
AB  == fresh cooked rice cakes for retail sale are typically held at room temperature because refrigeration dramatically reduces their quality. room temperature, high  water activity, and a ph of > 4.6 provided an environment conducive to pathogen growth. to date, no studies have been published regarding survival and growth of  foodborne pathogens in fresh cooked rice cakes. this study was undertaken to investigate the effect of steam cooking on foodborne pathogens and their subsequent growth in five varieties of rice cakes made from flours of regular rice, sweet rice, white rice, tapioca, and mung bean. bacillus cereus spores were detected in white rice, tapioca, and mung bean samples. the rice cake flours were inoculated with non-spore-forming foodborne pathogens (escherichia coli o157:h7,  salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, listeria monocytogenes, and staphylococcus aureus) or spore-forming bacteria (bacillus cereus) and steam cooked (100 degrees c) for 30 min. steam cooking significantly reduced (> 6 log cfu/g) non-spore-forming foodborne pathogens in all samples and inactivated spores of b. cereus by 1 to 2 log cfu/g. although spores of b. cereus survived steam cooking and germinated during 3 days of storage at room temperature, populations in most rice cakes remained below 106 cfu/g, which is the threshold for producing toxin. rice cakes made from mung bean flour supported growth and germination of b. cereus spores above that critical level. in mung bean rice cakes, enterotoxin production was detected by the second day, when b cereus cell  populations reached about 6.9 log cfu/g. the toxin concentration increased with storage time. however, our results suggest that rapid growth of total mesophilic  microorganisms by more than 7 to 8 log cfu/ml during the first day of storage produced off flavors and spoilage before b. cereus was able to grow enough to produce toxins. therefore, steam-cooked rice cakes made from a variety of flours  including mung bean flour are safe for sale for up to 1 day after storage at room temperature and are free of b. cereus toxins.

TI  == the microbiological quality of hot water-washed broccoli florets and cut green beans.
AB  == aims: to determine the effect of hot water washing on the microbiological quality of cut broccoli florets and trimmed green beans. methods and results: broccoli florets and trimmed beans were washed for 90 s in tap water at either 20 degrees  c or 52 degrees c and stored at 7 and 10 degrees c. the numbers of naturally occurring aerobic mesophilic organisms, pseudomonas spp., enterobacteriaceae, yeast and moulds and lactobacilli or lactic acid bacteria were enumerated at intervals for up to 2 weeks. the ability of listeria monocytogenes, bacillus cereus and escherichia coli o157:h7 inoculated onto the tissue post heat treatment to survive or grow was also measured to mimic the effect of postprocess contamination. using a hot wash treatment improved the initial appearance of the  vegetables and resulted in a small, but significant, reduction in populations of  all groups of endogenous flora measured. the number of yeast and moulds on the vegetables washed at 52 degrees c remained below the levels observed on the 20 degrees c washed vegetables throughout the observation period, but pseudomonas spp., lactobacilli and enterobacteriaceae were better able to grow on the hot-washed vegetables such that the counts at the end of storage were greater on  hot-washed than ambient-washed vegetables. all three of the pathogens tested were better able to grow on hot-washed broccoli and beans than on equivalent product washed at 20 degrees c. conclusions: hot water washing can be used to control enzymic browning or yeast and moulds growth but it can also allow more rapid and  extensive growth by pathogens and spoilage organisms. significance and impact of  the study: reduced protection against growth by pathogens means that the hot wash treatment of vegetables should be used with caution and requires careful assessment of risk.

TI  == microflora of minimally processed frozen vegetables sold in gaborone, botswana.
AB  == two hundred samples of minimally processed, frozen, and prepacked potato chips, peas, corn, and a variety of combined vegetables from supermarkets in gaborone, botswana, were examined microbiologically. determination of aerobic mesophilic plate count, aerobic psychrotrophic plate count, lactic acid bacteria, yeasts and molds, coliforms, listeria spp., and staphylococcus aureus were done. chips had the lowest mean log values for all of the microorganisms enumerated except yeasts and molds. the mean log values for single vegetables ranged from 3.6 to 9.1, 3.4  to 8.9, 2.9 to 5.6, and 2.1 to 6.5 log cfu/ g aerobic mesophilic plate count, aerobic psychrotrophic plate count, lactic acid bacteria, and yeasts and molds, respectively. the microbial profiles of peas and corn were almost similar (p < 0.001). the mean values for combined vegetables were clustered within 4.6 and 5.4 and 4.2 and 5.2 log cfu/g aerobic mesophilic plate count and aerobic psychrotrophic plate count, respectively. all of the vegetables had a coliform population distribution ranging from 0 to < 10(4) most probable number per g. the predominant gram-negative bacteria isolated included members of enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonaceae (86.2%). escherichia coli was not detected  in all of the samples. the organisms isolated included those responsible for spoilage in frozen vegetables, namely pseudomonas, klebsiella, corynebacterium, lactic acid bacteria, and flavobacterium. the predominant lactic acid bacteria were lactobacillus spp. (55.9%). other spoilage organisms were yeasts, and cryptococcus spp. (55.4%) was predominant. pathogens, namely listeria monocytogenes, were also isolated at a rate of 2 to 10%, of which 4% was from corn, 2% each from peas and country crop, and 10% from stir-fry. bacillus cereus  was also isolated and accounted for 7.7% of the microorganisms from corn. s. aureus was isolated from all of the vegetables. enterotoxigenic strains were from corn, peas, mixed vegetables, and stir-fry, and all of them produced enterotoxin  a. in addition, the isolates from stir-fry vegetables also produced enterotoxins  b and c. the study reveals the presence of pathogens and emerging opportunistic pathogens in the ready-to-use or ready-to-eat vegetables. if e. coli is the only  indicator for safety and acceptability, consumers may be exposed to foodborne diseases. inclusion of other groups as indicator organisms is suggested. retailers are urged to invest in standby generators to maintain the cold chain.

TI  == involvement of cytoplasmic membrane damage in the copper (ii)-dependent cytotoxicity of a novel naturally occurring tripyrrole.
AB  == in the presence of a nonlethal concentration of cu(ii), washed escherichia coli atcc8739 cells were killed by a novel tripyrrole 1, isolated as a red pigment from the serratia sp. cell killing was accompanied by a depletion in the potassium pools of the cells due to the damage to the cytoplasmic membrane, without any detectable dna damage as revealed by the transformed plasmid dna and  phage induction assay. this revealed that the bactericidal activity of compound 1 in the presence of cu(ii) results from membrane damage. induction of endogenous catalase in the e. coli cells increased their resistance against the combination  of compound 1 and cu(ii). although compound 1 alone generated large amount of reactive oxygen species (ros), it did not show any cell killing against e. coli in the absence of cu(ii). the cu(ii)-dependent bactericidal activity of compound  1 was suppressed by ethylenediaminetetraacetate, bathocuproine, catalase and superoxide disumutase (sod), but not by dimethyl sulfoxide. these findings suggest that recycling redox reactions between cu(ii) and cu(i), involving compound 1 and hydrogen peroxide on the cell surface, must be important in the mechanism of the killing. compound 1 alone showed selective bactericidal activity against the gram positive bacterium, bacillus cereus atcc 6630, possibly due to its differential cellular transport.

AB  == aims: to investigate the effectiveness of oils and vapours of lemon (citrus limon), sweet orange (citrus sinensis) and bergamot (citrus bergamia) and their components against a number of common foodborne pathogens. methods and results: the disc diffusion method was used to screen the oils and vapours against listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, escherichia coli  o157 and campylobacter jejuni. the survival of each species, demonstrated to be susceptible in the in vitro studies, was tested on cabbage leaf for 60 s by direct contact and on chicken skin for 10 min by direct contact and 24 h by vapour. the results indicate that bergamot was the most inhibitory essential oil  (eo) and citral and linalool mimicked its effect (p > 0.001). citral and linalool vapours produced 6 log reductions in l. monocytogenes, staph. aureus and b. cereus populations on cabbage leaf after 8-10 h exposure but bergamot vapour exposure, while producing a similar reduction in l. monocytogenes and b. cereus populations, had no effect on staph. aureus. conclusions: bergamot was the most effective of the oils tested and linalool the most effective anti-bacterial component. gram-positive bacteria were more susceptible than gram-negative bacteria in vitro, although camp. jejuni and e. coli o157 were inhibited by bergamot and linalool oils and by linalool vapour. all bacteria tested were less  susceptible in food systems than in vitro. of the gram-positive bacteria tested staph. aureus was the least susceptible to both the oils and the components tested. significance and impact of the study: results suggest the possibility that citrus eos, particularly bergamot, could be used as a way of combating the growth of common causes of food poisoning.

AB  == buoyant density gradient centrifugation has been used to separate bacteria from complex food matrices, as well as to remove compounds that inhibit rapid detection methods, such as pcr, and to prevent false-positive results due to dna  originating from dead cells. applying a principle of buoyant density gradient centrifugation, we developed a method for rapid separation and concentration following filtration and low- and high-speed centrifugation, as well as flotation and sedimentation buoyant density centrifugation, for 12 food-borne pathogens (salmonella enterica, escherichia coli, yersinia enterocolitica, campylobacter jejuni, vibrio cholerae o139, vibrio parahaemolyticus o3k6, vibrio vulnificus, providencia alcalifaciens, aeromonas hydrophila, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus  aureus, and clostridium perfringens) in 13 different food homogenates. this method can be used prior to real-time quantitative pcr (rti-qpcr) and viable-cell counting. using this combined method, the target organisms in the food samples theoretically could be concentrated 250-fold and detected at cell concentrations  as low as 10(1) to 10(3) cfu/g using the rti-qpcr assay, and amounts as small as  10(0) to 10(1) cfu/g could be isolated using plate counting. the combined separation and concentration methods and rti-qpcr confirmed within 3 h the presence of 10(1) to 10(2) cfu/g of salmonella and c. jejuni directly in naturally contaminated chicken and the presence of s. aureus directly in remaining food items in a poisoning outbreak. these results illustrated the feasibility of using these assays for rapid inspection of bacterial food contamination during a real-world outbreak.

AB  == the presence of one of the anthrax virulence plasmid pxo1 conserved fragments was analyzed in 24 bacillus cereus and b. thuringiensis strains, including 6 b. thuringiensis subspecies, by polymerase chain reactions. twelve out of 24 strains showed pcr-positive for an orf101 homologous sequence. two pxo1-orf101-like fragments from a b. cereus b-4ac and a commercial b. thuringiensis kurstaki hd1 were cloned, sequenced and expressed in escherichia coli. toxicity assays revealed that the product encoded by the pxo1-orf101-like fragment had no impact  on either vero cells or chinese hamster ovary cells, suggesting that this fragment probably not contribute to enterotoxic activity. sequence alignment of the pxo1-orf101 from three bacillus anthracis and orf101-like fragments from other 12 b. cereus group isolates indicated high identity (more than 90%) and the presence of subgroup- and strain-specific snps among these fragments.

TI  == identification of the critical role of tyr-194 in the catalytic activity of a novel n-acyl-homoserine lactonase from marine bacillus cereus strain y2.
AB  == enzymatic disruption of quorum-sensing (qs) pathways in pathogenic organisms is a promising anti-infection therapeutic strategy. ahl-lactonase, a potent tool for biocontrol, can hydrolyze qs signal molecule n-acyl-homoserine lactones (ahls) into inactive products, thereby blocking the qs systems. a marine bacterial isolate y2, identified as a bacillus cereus subsp., was found capable of inactivating ahls. the aiia gene encoding the ahl-degrading enzyme from bacterial strain y2 was cloned and expressed in escherichia coli. the 28-kda recombinant y2-aiia protein was purified and showed strong ahl-degrading activity. sequence comparisons of y2-aiia with known ahl-lactonases revealed high identities in the  deduced amino-acid sequences. functional determination of a potential catalytic residue tyr-194 of ahl-lactonases was performed by site-directed mutagenesis. as  judged by ahl-degrading bioassay, substitution of tyr-194 with ala resulted in a  dramatic decrease of activity compared with wild-type (wt) recombinant y2-aiia, although the expression level of the mutated y2-aiia protein was equivalent to that of wt y2-aiia. these results suggested that the conserved residue tyr-194 is critical for catalytic function of the novel ahl-lactonase.

TI  == phenolics and antimicrobial activity of traditional stoned table olives 'alcaparra'.
AB  == in the present work, we report the determination of phenolic compounds in 'alcaparra' table olives by reversed-phase hplc/dad, and the evaluation of their  extract in vitro activity against several microorganisms that may be causal agents of human intestinal and respiratory tract infections, namely gram positive (bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, and staphylococcus aureus), gram negative bacteria (pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, and klebsiella pneumoniae) and fungi (candida albicans and cryptococcus neoformans). three flavonoidic compounds were identified and quantified: luteolin 7-o-glucoside, apigenin 7-o-glucoside, and luteolin. at low concentrations (0.05mg/ml) 'alcaparra' extract revealed significant inhibition of both gram positive and gram negative bacteria growth, with exception of p. aeruginosa. nevertheless, no antifungal activity was observed at the tested concentrations.

TI  == a comparison of three rapid bacterial detection methods under simulated real-life conditions.
AB  == background: bacterial screening of all produced platelet concentrates (pcs) is implemented in many countries to reduce the risk of transfusion-transmitted sepsis. this study compares three rapid bacterial detection methods by imitating  real-life conditions. study design and methods: the sensitivity of a solid-phase  scanning cytometer (optimized scansystem, hemosystem), fluorescence-activated cell sorting (facs) analysis, and 16s rna in-house nucleic acid testing (nat) was evaluated by spiking pcs with four transfusion relevant bacteria (staphylococcus  aureus, bacillus cereus, klebsiella pneumoniae, and escherichia coli ). two different inocula (10 colony-forming units [cfus]/ml and 10 cfus/bag) were used to simulate real-life conditions. samples were taken at 12, 16, 20, and 24 hours  after spiking. results: with the high inoculum, nat had a 100 percent rate of positive testing for all four types of bacteria (10/10 replicates) at each time point. with the exception of e. coli, the sensitivity of facs and optimized scansystem was comparable for the high inoculum. with the low inoculum, 60 percent of e. coli, 80 percent of b. cereus, 90 percent of k. pneumoniae, and 100 percent of s. aureus were nat-positive 12 hours after spiking. in contrast, only  20 percent of e. coli, 10 percent of b. cereus, and 70 percent of k. pneumoniae were facs-positive with the low inoculum 12 hours after spiking. conclusions: in  summary, the preliminary data revealed a higher sensitivity for nat in comparison to facs and optimized scansystem under the defined study conditions. to imitate real-life conditions, further spiking studies with a low inoculum (10 cfus/bag) and slower growing organisms should be conducted to examine the sensitivity of available detection systems.

TI  == in vitro studies of the digestion of caprine whey proteins by human gastric and duodenal juice and the effects on selected microorganisms.
AB  == the in vitro digestion of caprine whey proteins was investigated by a two-step degradation assay, using human gastric juice (hgj) at ph 2.5 and human duodenal juice (hdj) at ph 7.5. different protein and peptide profiles were observed after the first (hgj) and second (hdj) enzymatic degradation. the minor whey proteins serum albumin, lactoferrin and ig were rapidly degraded by hgj, while alpha-lactalbumin (alpha-la) and beta-lactoglobulin (beta-lg) were more resistant and survived both 30 and 45 min of the enzymatic treatment. further digestion with hdj still showed intact beta-lg, and the main part of alpha-la also remained unchanged. the protein degradation by hgj and hdj was also compared with treatment by commercial enzymes, by using pepsin at ph 2.5, and a mixture of trypsin and chymotrypsin at ph 7.5. the two methods resulted in different caprine protein and peptide profiles. the digests after treatment with hgj and hdj were screened for antibacterial effects on some selected microorganisms, escherichia coli, bacillus cereus, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg and streptococcus mutans. active growing cells of e. coli were inhibited by the digestion products from caprine whey obtained after treatment with hgj and hdj. cells of b. cereus were inhibited only by whey proteins obtained after reaction with hgj, while the products after further degradation with hdj demonstrated no significant effect. screenings performed on cells of lb. rhamnosus gg and s. mutans all showed no signs of inhibition.

TI  == bacillus spp. among hospitalized patients with haematological malignancies: clinical features, epidemics and outcomes.
AB  == between april 2000 and may 2005, 350 bacteraemic episodes occurred among patients treated in our haematology unit. two hundred and twenty-eight of these episodes were caused by gram-positive pathogens, most commonly coagulase-negative staphylococci and staphylococcus aureus. one hundred and twenty-two episodes were due to gram-negative pathogens, with a predominance of escherichia coli, acinetobacter baumannii and pseudomonas aeruginosa. bacillus bacteraemias constituted 12 of these episodes occurring in 12 patients, and accounted for 3.4% of all bacteraemic episodes. of the 12 strains evaluated, seven were bacillus licheniformis, three were bacillus cereus and two were bacillus pumilus. seven episodes presented with bloodstream infection, three with pneumonia, one with severe abdominal pain and deterioration of liver function, and one with a catheter-related bloodstream infection. b. licheniformis was isolated from five patients who had been hospitalized at the same time. this outbreak was related to non-sterile cotton wool used during skin disinfection. b. cereus and b. licheniformis isolates were susceptible to cefepime, carbapenems, aminoglycosides and vancomycin, but b. pumilus isolates were resistant to all antibiotics except  for quinolones and vancomycin. two deaths were observed. in conclusion, bacillus  spp. may cause serious infections, diagnostic and therapeutic dilemmas, and high  morbidity and mortality in patients with haematological malignancies. both b. cereus and b. licheniformis may be among the 'new' gram-positive pathogens to cause serious infection in patients with neutropenia.

TI  == berry phenolics: antimicrobial properties and mechanisms of action against severe human pathogens.
AB  == antimicrobial activity and mechanisms of phenolic extracts of 12 nordic berries were studied against selected human pathogenic microbes. the most sensitive bacteria on berry phenolics were helicobacter pylori and bacillus cereus. campylobacter jejuni and candida albicans were inhibited only with phenolic extracts of cloudberry, raspberry, and strawberry, which all were rich in ellagitannins. cloudberry extract gave strong microbicidic effects on the basis of plate count with all studied strains. however, fluorescence staining of liquid cultures of virulent salmonella showed viable cells not detectable by plate count adhering to cloudberry extract, whereas staphylococcus aureus cells adhered to berry extracts were dead on the basis of their fluorescence and plate count. phenolic extracts of cloudberry and raspberry disintegrated the outer membrane of examined salmonella strains as indicated by 1-n-phenylnaphthylamine (npn) uptake  increase and analysis of liberation of [14c]galactose- lipopolysaccharide. gallic acid effectively permeabilized the tested salmonella strains, and significant increase in the npn uptake was recorded. the stability of berry phenolics and their antimicrobial activity in berries stored frozen for a year were examined using escherichia coli and nonvirulent salmonella enterica sv. typhimurium. the amount of phenolic compounds decreased in all berries, but their antimicrobial activity was not influenced accordingly. cloudberry, in particular, showed constantly strong antimicrobial activity during the storage.

AB  == in previous studies we characterized the burkholderia cenocepacia zmpa zinc metalloprotease. in this study, we determined that b. cenocepacia has an additional metalloprotease, which we designated zmpb. the zmpb gene is present in the same species as zmpa and was detected in b. cepacia, b. cenocepacia, b. stabilis, b. ambifaria, and b. pyrrocinia but was absent from b. multivorans, b.  vietnamiensis, b. dolosa, and b. anthina. the zmpb gene was expressed, and zmpb was purified from escherichia coli by using the pproexhta his(6) tag expression system. zmpb has a predicted preproenzyme structure typical of thermolysin-like proteases and is distantly related to bacillus cereus bacillolysin. zmpb was expressed as a 63-kda preproenzyme precursor that was autocatalytically cleaved into mature zmpb (35 kda) and a 27-kda prepropeptide. edta, 1,10-phenanthroline,  and zn(2+) cations inhibited zmpb enzyme activity, indicating that it is a metalloprotease. zmpb had proteolytic activity against alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor, alpha(2)-macrogobulin, type iv collagen, fibronectin, lactoferrin, transferrin, and immunoglobulins. b. cenocepacia zmpb and zmpa zmpb mutants had no proteolytic activity against casein and were less virulent in a rat agar bead  chronic infection model, indicating that zmpb is involved in b. cenocepacia virulence. expression of zmpb was regulated by both the cepir and cciir quorum-sensing systems.

TI  == glycosylation of flavonoids with a glycosyltransferase from bacillus cereus.
AB  == microbial glycosyltransferases can convert many small lipophilic compounds such as phenolics, terpenoids, cyanohydrins and alkaloids into glycons using uridine-diphosphate-activated sugars. the main chemical functions of glycosylation processes are stabilization, detoxification and solubilization of the substrates. the gene encoding the udp-glycosyltransferase from bacillus cereus, bcgt-1, was cloned by pcr and sequenced. bcgt-1 was expressed in escherichia coli bl21 (de3) with a his-tag and purified using a his-tag affinity  column. bcgt-1 could use apigenin, genistein, kaempferol, luteolin, naringenin and quercetin as substrates and gave two reaction products. the enzyme preferentially glycosylated at the 3-hydroxyl group, but it could transfer a glucose group onto the 7-hydroxyl group when the 3-hydroxyl group was not available. the reaction products made by biotransformation of flavonoids with e.  coli expressing bcgt-1 are similar to those produced with the purified recombinant enzyme. thus, this work provides a method that might be useful for the biosynthesis of flavonoid glucosides and for the glycosylation of related compounds.

AB  == the influence of the two most commonly used ionic liquids (1-butyl-3-methyl imidazolium tetrafluoroborate, [bmim][bf(4)], 1-butyl-3-methyl imidazolium hexafluorophosphate, [bmim][pf(6)]) and three selected organic solvents (dimethylsulfoxide, ethanol, methanol) on the growth of escherichia coli, pichia  pastoris and bacillus cereus was investigated. [bmim][bf(4)] was toxic at 1% (v/v) on all three microorganisms. the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) of  [bmim][bf(4)] on e. coli growth was between 0.7 and 1% (v/v). in contrast, [bmim][pf(6)] was less toxic for p. pastoris and b. cereus, whereas e. coli was not able to tolerate [bmim][pf(6)] (mic value: 0.3-0.7% v/v). growth of p. pastoris was unaffected by [bmim][pf(6)] at 10% (v/v). similar results were found for dimethylsulfoxide. thus, ionic liquids (ils) can have substantial inhibitory  effects on the growth of microorganisms, which should be taken into account for environmental reasons as well as for the use of ils as co-solvents in biotransformations.

TI  == antimicrobial, wound healing and antioxidant activity of plagiochasma appendiculatum lehm. et lind.
AB  == plagiochasma appendiculatum (aytoniaceae) of the order marchantiales is widely used in the form of paste ethnomedicinally by gaddi tribe in kangra valley for treating skin diseases. in this context, antimicrobical potential of plagiochasma appendiculatum against a wide range of microorganisms was studied. to validate the ethnotherapeutic claims of the plant in skin diseases, wound healing activity was studied, besides antioxidant activity to understand the mechanism of wound healing activity. the plant (alchoholic and aqueous extract) showed significant antibacterial and antifungal activity against almost all the organisms: micrococcus luteus, bacillus subtilis, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhimurium, and eight fungi candida albicans and cryptococcus albidus-dimorphic fungi, trichophyton rubrum-dermatophyte fungi, aspergillus niger, aspergillus flavus, aspergillus spinulosus, aspergillus terreus and aspergillus nidulans-systemic fungi, with especially good activity against the dermatophyte (trichophyton rubrum) and some infectious bacteria (escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis and salmonella typhimurium) with an mic of 2.5 microg/disc. the results show that plagiochasma appendiculatum extract has potent wound healing capacity as evident  from the wound contraction and increased tensile strength. the results also indicated that plagiochasma appendiculatum extract possesses potent antioxidant activity by inhibiting lipid peroxidation and increase in the superoxide dismutase (sod) and catalase activity.

TI  == a novel ftsz-like protein is involved in replication of the anthrax toxin-encoding pxo1 plasmid in bacillus anthracis.
AB  == plasmid pxo1 encodes the tripartite anthrax toxin, which is the major virulence factor of bacillus anthracis. in spite of the important role of pxo1 in anthrax pathogenesis, very little is known about its replication and maintenance in b. anthracis. we cloned a 5-kb region of the pxo1 plasmid into an escherichia coli vector and showed that this plasmid can replicate when introduced into b. anthracis. mutational analysis showed that open reading frame 45 (repx) of pxo1 was required for the replication of the miniplasmid in b. anthracis. interestingly, repx showed limited homology to bacterial ftsz proteins that are involved in cell division. a mutation in the predicted gtp binding domain of repx abolished its replication activity. genes almost identical to repx are contained  on several megaplasmids in members of the bacillus cereus group, including a b. cereus strain that causes an anthrax-like disease. our results identify a novel group of ftsz-related initiator proteins that are required for the replication of virulence plasmids in b. anthracis and possibly in related organisms. such replication proteins may provide novel drug targets for the elimination of plasmids encoding the anthrax toxin and other virulence factors.

TI  == characterization of a unique type ia topoisomerase in bacillus cereus.
AB  == bacillus cereus topoisomerase iiibeta (bctopo iiibeta) has been cloned, overexpressed and biochemically characterized. this enzyme exhibits 64% and 33% sequence identity to bacillus subtilis topoisomerase iii (bstopo iii) and escherichia coli topoisomerase iii (ectopo iii) respectively. the enzymatic properties of bctopo iiibeta differ substantially from other bacterial type ia topoisomerases, including e. coli type ia topoisomerases and b. cereus topoisomerase i (bctopo i) and iiialpha (bctopo iiialpha). bctopo iiibeta only partially relaxes negatively supercoiled dna and appears incapable of generating  fully relaxed topoisomers. in contrast to ectopo iii and bctopo iiialpha, bctopo  iiibeta is not a decatenase. bctopo iiibeta is unable to compensate the loss of ectopo iii in vivo. therefore, bctopo iiibeta is a unique prokaryotic type ia topoisomerase that is different from previously characterized topoisomerases.

TI  == a newly developed assay to study the minimum inhibitory concentration of satureja spinosa essential oil.
AB  == aims: the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of satureja spinosa essential oil against staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli o157:h7, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella enterica, salmonella serovar enteritidis pt4 and bacillus cereus was comparatively assessed with an established optical density method as well as a novel impedimetric method. methods and results: the impedimetric analysis takes into account information of microbial growth, such as detection time, maximum conductance, and slope of the conductance curve. for each pathogen two levels of inoculation were studied, a high (10(5) cfu ml(-1)) and a  low level (10(2) cfu ml(-1)). non-linear regression analysis was used to fit the  data using a modification of a previously published model, from which a more exact value can be obtained for the mic. both methods gave similar mics as shown  by t-test statistical analysis. salm. enteritidis seems to be the least sensitive to the action of s. spinosa essential oil followed by l. monocytogenes, e. coli,  b.cereus and staph. aureus. the mics of low inoculum were lower than that of high inoculum. conclusions: the new impedimetric assay of mic of essential oils can be considered a reliable rapid method for screening antimicrobial effectiveness of natural additives. significance and impact of the study: determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration of an essential oil with the simple conductance  technique and further study of the mode of action of its components is a good combination for obtaining additional knowledge for industrial application of such natural additives.

TI  == a new protein superfamily includes two novel 3-methyladenine dna glycosylases from bacillus cereus, alkc and alkd.
AB  == soil bacteria are heavily exposed to environmental methylating agents such as methylchloride and may have special requirements for repair of alkylation damage  on dna. we have used functional complementation of an escherichia coli tag alka mutant to screen for 3-methyladenine dna glycosylase genes in genomic libraries of the soil bacterium bacillus cereus. three genes were recovered: alkc, alkd and alke. the amino acid sequence of alke is homologous to the e. coli alka sequence. alkc and alkd represent novel proteins without sequence similarity to any protein of known function. however, iterative and indirect sequence similarity searches revealed that alkc and alkd are distant homologues of each other within a new protein superfamily that is ubiquitous in the prokaryotic kingdom. homologues of  alkc and alkd were also identified in the amoebas entamoeba histolytica and dictyostelium discoideum, but no other eukaryotic counterparts of the superfamily were found. the alkc and alkd genes were expressed in e. coli and the proteins were purified to homogeneity. both proteins were found to be specific for removal of n-alkylated bases, and showed no activity on oxidized or deaminated base lesions in dna. b. cereus alkc and alkd thus define novel families of alkylbase dna glycosylases within a new protein superfamily.

TI  == exchange of glutamine-217 to glutamate of clostridium limosum exoenzyme c3 turns  the asparagine-specific adp-ribosyltransferase into an arginine-modifying enzyme.
AB  == c3-like adp-ribosyltransferaseses are produced by clostridium species, bacillus cereus, and various staphylococcus aureus strains. the exoenzymes modify the low-molecular-mass gtpases rhoa, b, and c. in structural studies of c3-like exoenzymes, an artt-motif (adp-ribosylating turn-turn motif) was identified that  appears to be involved in substrate specificity and recognition (han, s., arvai,  a. s., clancy, s. b., tainer, j. a. (2001) j. mol. biol. 305, 95-107). exchange of gln217, which is a key residue of the artt-motif, to glu in c3 from clostridium limosum results in inhibition of adp-ribosyltransferase activity toward rhoa. the mutant protein is still capable of nad-binding and possesses nad+ glycohydrolase activity. whereas recombinant wild-type c3 modifies rho proteins specifically at an asparagine residue (asn41), gln217glu-c3 is capable of adp-ribosylation of poly-arginine but not poly-asparagine. soybean trypsin inhibitor, a model substrate for many arginine-specific adp-ribosyltransferases,  is modified by the gln217glu-c3 transferase. also in c3 adp-ribosyltransferases from clostridium botulinum and b. cereus, the exchange of the equivalent gln residue to glu blocked asparagine modification of rhoa but elicited arginine-specific adp-ribosylation. moreover, the gln217glu-c3lim transferase was able to adp-ribosylate recombinant wild-type c3lim at arg86, resulting in decrease in adp-ribosyltransferase activity of the wild-type enzyme. the data indicate that the exchange of one amino acid residue in the artt-motif turns the  asparagine-modifying adp-ribosyltransferases of the c3 family into arginine-adp-ribosylating transferases.

AB  == background: flow cytometry (facs) is a common technique in blood banking. it is used, for example, for the enumeration of residual white blood cells in plasma and in cellular blood products. it was investigated whether it can also be applied for sterility testing of buffy coat-derived platelet concentrates (pcs).  study design and methods: plasma-reduced pcs were spiked with bacteria and stored at 20 to 24 or 37 degrees c for various times. the following 10 species were used: bacillus cereus, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, propionibacterium acnes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, serratia marcescens, and yersinia enterocolitica. bacterial dna was stained with thiazole orange. after the platelets were lysed, bacteria were enumerated by facs. results: all bacteria species used were detectable by facs. the lower detection limit was approximately 100 bacteria per microl, that is, 10(5) per ml. in general, the titers measured were 1.2- to 3-fold higher than those determined by colony forming assay. in one  case (k. pneumoniae) in which the dot plot of the bacteria cloud overlapped with  that of bacteria debris, they were consistently lower. when pc samples were inoculated with approximately 1 colony-forming unit per ml of bacteria and kept at 37 degrees c, most species were detected within 21 hours or less. exceptions were e. cloacae and p. acnes, which were detected after 24 to 40 and 64 hours, respectively. at 20 to 24 degrees c, the detection times were strongly prolonged. conclusion: sterility testing of pcs by facs is a feasible approach. the present  data suggest incubating pc samples for 20 to 24 hours at 37 degrees c before testing. for slow-growing bacteria, the incubation period must be prolonged by 1  to 2 days.

AB  == bacillus thuringiensis and bacillus cereus are closely related. b. thuringiensis  is well known for its entomopathogenic properties, principally due to the synthesis of plasmid-encoded crystal toxins. b. cereus appears to be an emerging  opportunistic human pathogen. b. thuringiensis and b. cereus produce many putative virulence factors which are positively controlled by the pleiotropic transcriptional regulator plcr. the inactivation of plcr decreases but does not abolish virulence, indicating that additional factors like flagella may contribute to pathogenicity. therefore, we further analyzed a mutant (b. thuringiensis 407 cry(-) deltaflha) previously described as being defective in flagellar apparatus assembly and in motility as well as in the production of hemolysin bl and phospholipases. a large picture of secreted proteins was obtained by two-dimensional electrophoresis analysis, which revealed that flagellar proteins are not secreted and that production of several virulence-associated factors is reduced in the flha mutant. moreover, we quantified the effect of flha on plca and hblc gene transcription. the results show that the flha mutation results in a significant reduction of plca and hblc transcription. these results indicate that the transcription of several plcr-regulated virulence factors is coordinated with the flagellar apparatus. consistently, the flha mutant also shows a strong decrease in cytotoxicity towards hela cells and in virulence against galleria mellonella larvae following  oral and intrahemocoelic inoculation. the decrease in virulence may be due to both a lack of flagella and a lower production of secreted factors. hence, flha appears to be an essential virulence factor with a pleiotropic role.

TI  == efficient growth inhibition of bacillus anthracis by knocking out the ribonucleotide reductase tyrosyl radical.
AB  == bacillus anthracis, the causative agent of anthrax, is a worldwide problem because of the need for effective treatment of respiratory infections shortly after exposure. one potential key enzyme of b. anthracis to be targeted by antiproliferative drugs is ribonucleotide reductase. it provides deoxyribonucleotides for dna synthesis needed for spore germination and growth of the pathogen. we have cloned, purified, and characterized the tyrosyl radical-carrying nrdf component of b. anthracis class ib ribonucleotide reductase. its epr spectrum points to a hitherto unknown three-dimensional geometry of the radical side chain with a 60 degrees rotational angle of c(alpha)-(c(beta)-c(1))-plane of the aromatic ring. the unusual relaxation behavior of the radical signal and its apparent lack of line broadening at room temperature suggest a weak interaction with the nearby diiron site and the presence of a water molecule plausibly bridging the phenolic oxygen of the radical to a ligand of the diiron site. we show that b. anthracis cells are surprisingly resistant to the radical scavenger hydroxyurea in current use as an  antiproliferative drug, even though its nrdf radical is efficiently scavenged in  vitro. importantly, the antioxidants hydroxylamine and n-methyl hydroxylamine scavenge the radical several orders of magnitude faster and prevent b. anthracis  growth at several hundred-fold lower concentrations compared with hydroxyurea. phylogenetically, the b. anthracis nrdf protein clusters together with nrdfs from the pathogens bacillus cereus, bacillus thuringiensis, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis. we suggest the potential use of n-hydroxylamines in combination therapies against infections by b. anthracis and closely related pathogens.

TI  == antibacterial activity of coumarins.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of coumarin per se and other 45 coumarin derivatives was tested against strains of bacillus cereus mip 96016, escherichia coli atcc 25922, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853, and staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923. the inhibitory effects of coumarins were affected by their substitution patterns. osthenol (44) showed the most effective antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria with mic values ranging between 125 and 62.5 microg/ml. these results suggested that the prenyl chain of 44 at position 8 and the presence of oh at position 7 of the benzenic ring are required for the antibacterial activity against these strains.

TI  == differential activity of a lectin from solieria filiformis against human pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == a lectin isolated from the red alga solieria filiformis was evaluated for its effect on the growth of 8 gram-negative and 3 gram-positive bacteria cultivated in liquid medium (three independent experiments/bacterium). the lectin (500 microg/ml) stimulated the growth of the gram-positive species bacillus cereus and inhibited the growth of the gram-negative species serratia marcescens, salmonella typhi, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, proteus sp, and pseudomonas aeruginosa at 1000 microg/ml but the lectin (10-1000 microg/ml) had no effect on  the growth of the gram-positive bacteria staphylococcus aureus and b. subtilis, or on the gram-negative bacteria escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium. the purified lectin significantly reduced the cell density of gram-negative bacteria, although no changes in growth phases (log, exponential and of decline) were observed. it is possible that the interaction of s. filiformis lectin with the cell surface receptors of gram-negative bacteria promotes alterations in the flow of nutrients, which would explain the bacteriostatic effect. growth stimulation of the gram-positive bacterium b. cereus was more marked in the presence of the lectin at a concentration of 1000 microg/ml. the stimulation of the growth of b.  cereus was not observed when the lectin was previously incubated with mannan (125 microg/ml), its hapten. thus, we suggest the involvement of the binding site of the lectin in this effect. the present study reports the first data on the inhibition and stimulation of pathogenic bacterial cells by marine alga lectins.

TI  == use of oligonucleotide array for identification of six foodborne pathogens and pseudomonas aeruginosa grown on selective media.
AB  == identification of presumptive foodborne pathogens grown on selective media may take one to several days and requires a different battery of biochemical tests for each microorganism. a molecular identification method was developed in which  universal primers were used to amplify the 16s to 23s rdna intergenic spacer of target microorganisms, and pcr products were hybridized to a panel of species-specific oligonucleotides that were immobilized on a nylon membrane. the  seven target microorganisms were bacillus cereus, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella, staphylococcus aureus, and vibrio parahaemolyticus. after testing a large collection of target bacteria (29  to 51 strains) and nontarget bacteria (> 500 strains), the performances (sensitivity and specificity) of the oligonucleotide array were as follows: b. cereus (100 and 77%), e. coli (100 and 100%), l. monocytogenes (100 and 90%), p.  aeruginosa (100 and 100%), salmonella (100 and 100%), s. aureus (100 and 100%), and v. parahaemolyticus (100 and 94.2%). other species in the b. cereus group cross-hybridized to the probes used for identification of b. cereus, and positive results should be confirmed by additional morphological observation of colonies.  listeria innocua cross-reacted with probes used to identify l. monocytogenes, but a simple hemolysis test was used to differentiate the two species. some strains of vibrio harveyi and vibrio mimicus cross-hybridized with probes used for identification of v. parahaemolyticus and caused false-positive reactions. the advantage of the array is that a common protocol was used to identify the seven target microorganisms and multiple different microorganisms could be simultaneously identified on a single array.

TI  == optimal sampling time after preparation of platelet concentrates for detection of bacterial contamination by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == background and objectives: a universal quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr), based on bacterial 16s rdna, to detect bacterial contamination of platelet concentrates (pcs), was developed previously and compared with automated culturing. in the present study, this real-time pcr method was evaluated to determine the optimal sampling time for screening of bacterial contamination in pcs. materials and methods: routinely prepared pcs were spiked with suspensions of escherichia coli, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus epidermidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and propionibacterium acnes to 1, 10 and 100 colony-forming units (cfu)/ml and stored at room temperature for 7 days. the presence of bacteria in these pcs was monitored by quantitative real-time pcr. as a reference method (additional control), bact/alert automated culturing was used. for pcr, 1-ml aliquots were drawn from all (spiked) pcs on days 0, 1, 2, 3, 6 and 7 of storage. as a control, triplicate samples (10 ml) were inoculated into aerobic and anaerobic bact/alert culture bottles immediately after spiking (day 0) and after  storage for 1, 2, 3, 6 or 7 days. results: with quantitative real-time pcr, all bacterial species tested were reproducibly detected on day 1 after spiking at original concentrations of 10 and 100 cfu/ml. bacteria were also detected on day  1 from pcs spiked with an initial concentration of 1 cfu/ml, except for e. coli,  which was detected in only one of the three samples and p. aeruginosa, for which  analysis was not performed on day 1. with the reference method, bacteria were detected in culture bottles (inoculated on day 0) within a mean time of 20.1 h, with the exception of p. acnes which was detected at a mean time of 102.3 and 49.3 h (for original spiking concentrations of 10 and 100 cfu/ml respectively). conclusions: pcr enables the rapid detection of low initial numbers of bacteria in pcs. for reliable detection, our results support that sampling of pcs for real-time pcr screening should not be carried out earlier than 1 day after preparation (48 h after blood collection). importantly, the real-time pcr approach has the potential to be used before the release of pcs from the blood centre or shortly before they are transfused in the hospital.

TI  == isolation of bacterial strains colonizable in mosquito larval guts as novel host  cells for mosquito control.
AB  == we screened for microorganisms that can be utilized as new host cells for mosquito larvicides. as long persistence in the environment is required of host cells, we examined the bacterial populations in the guts of mosquito larvae collected from natural breeding habitats. larvae of aedes aegypti and culex quinquefasciatus were examined, and bacillus species, particularly bacillus cereus, were found to be the dominant bacterial species in their guts. to investigate the relationship between these bacillus strains and the mosquito larvae, we re-introduced the bacteria into larvae of aedes aegypti, c. quinquefasciatus and another common mosquito strain, anopheles dirus. the cell numbers of bacillus cereus strains ae10 and cx5 in the guts were consistent throughout a 7-d period without food supplementation, suggesting that these strains were able to colonize in the guts of the larvae. to confirm this, we introduced a plasmid containing a kanamycin resistance marker into ae10 and cx5 and fed these recombinant strains to c. quinquefasciatus larvae. even when food was supplemented for 7 d, the recombinant strains, particularly ae10, were still  found in the guts. under similar conditions, b. thuringiensis serovar israelensis c4q2-72 was hardly detectable after 2 d, while escherichia coli could not be detected at all. their stable retention in mosquito larvae guts and the feasibility of genetic manipulation indicates these strains possess high potential as novel host cells for application in mosquito control.

TI  == fluorescein-labeled beta-lactamase mutant for high-throughput screening of bacterial beta-lactamases against beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  == the increasing emergence of new bacterial beta-lactamases that can efficiently hydrolyze beta-lactam antibiotics to clinically inactive carboxylic acids has created an intractable problem in the treatment of bacterial infections, and it is highly desirable to develop a useful tool that can rapidly screen bacteria for beta-lactamases against a variety of antibiotic candidates in a high-throughput manner. this paper describes the use of a fluorescein-labeled beta-lactamase mutant (e166cf) as a convenient fluorescent tool to screen beta-lactamases, including the bacillus cereus beta-lactamase i (penpc), b. cereus beta-lactamase  ii, bacillus licheniformis penp, escherichia coli tem-1, and enterobacter cloacae p99 against various beta-lactam antibiotics (penicillin g, penicillin v, ampicillin, cefuroxime, cefoxitin, moxalactam, cephaloridine), using a 96-well microplate reader. the e166cf mutant was constructed by replacing glu166 on the flexible omega-loop, which is close to the enzyme's active site, with a cysteine  residue on a class a beta-lactamase (b. cereus penpc) and subsequently labeling the mutant with thiol-reactive fluorescein-5-maleimide. such modifications significantly impaired the hydrolytic activity of the e166cf mutant compared to that of the wild-type enzyme. the fluorescence intensity of the e166cf mutant increases in the presence of beta-lactam antibiotics. for antibiotics that are resistant to hydrolysis by the e166cf mutant (cefuroxime, cefoxitin, moxalactam), the fluorescence signal slowly increases until it reaches a plateau. for antibiotics that can be slowly hydrolyzed by the e166cf mutant (penicillin g, penicillin v, ampicillin), the fluorescence signal rapidly increases to the plateau and then declines after a prolonged incubation. the e166cf mutant retains its characteristic pattern of fluorescence signals in the presence of both bacterial beta-lactamases and beta-lactamase-resistant antibiotics. in contrast,  in the presence of both bacterial beta-lactamases and beta-lactamase-sensitive antibiotics, the fluorescence signals of the e166cf mutant were decreased. the fluorescence signals from the e166cf mutant allow an unambiguous differentiation  of beta-lactamase-resistant antibiotics from beta-lactamase-sensitive ones in the screening of bacterial beta-lactamases against a panel of antibiotic candidates.  this simple method may provide an alternative tool in choosing potent beta-lactam antibiotics for treatment of bacterial infections.

TI  == microbiological quality of ready-to-eat foods: results from a long-term surveillance program (1995 through 2003).
AB  == the coordination of food sampling activities across wales, a part of the united kingdom with a population of approximately 3 million, led to the establishment in 1995 of a coordinated food-sampling program designed to monitor on a long-term basis the microbiological quality and safety of specific ready-to-eat products. this surveillance system has been ongoing for 9 years and has generated a database of microbiological and associated demographic results for 15,228 ready-to-eat food samples. the food types that had the poorest overall results were sliced meats, unsliced poultry, sandwiches made without salad, and cakes made without dairy cream. for all food types, the overall unsatisfactory rate was 17% for aerobic colony counts, 1.6% for escherichia coli, and 0.5% for listeria spp. overall unsatisfactory or unacceptable rates for pathogens such as clostridium perfringens, listeria monocytogenes, bacillus cereus, and staphylococcus aureus were all below 0.5%. no campylobacter-positive samples and  only one salmonella-positive sample were found. the analysis of the results show  that the ready-to-eat food types sampled over the 9 years of the program were generally of good microbiological quality when compared with current united kingdom guidelines. the information contained in the database provides a baseline measurement of the microbial quality of a variety of ready-to-eat foods and allows environmental health officers and food microbiologists to generate hypotheses for targeted surveys or research work.

TI  == microbial profiles of on-line--procured sprouting seeds and potential hazards associated with enterotoxigenic bacillus spp. in homegrown sprouts.
AB  == we examined the microbiological quality of sprouting seeds sold through the internet. overall, five types of seeds each from six organic and six conventional sources were evaluated. the growth and toxin production of naturally occurring bacillus spp. in sprouts produced using home-scale sprouting devices also were investigated. for alfalfa, broccoli, lentil, mungbean, and radish seeds, the average microbial counts were 3.3, 4.0, 2.8, 3.5, and 3.6 log cfu/g, presumptive  b. cereus counts were 0.7, 1.0, 0.8, 1.0, and 0.9 log cfu/g, and total coliform counts were -0.3, -0.4, -0.5, 0.0, and -0.4 log of the most probable number per gram, respectively. no salmonella, escherichia coli o157, other fecal coliforms,  or staphylococcus aureus was found on seeds. compared with conventional seeds, the organic seeds had lower or equivalent counts for total microorganisms, presumptive b. cereus, and total coliforms. when seeds were sprouting using a glass jar, the growth of presumptive b. cereus was significant for radish and broccoli but not for alfalfa, lentil, and mungbean sprouts; the counts exceeded 5.0 log cfu/g in radish sprouts. when sprouts were grown using an automatic sprouting device, presumptive b. cereus showed slight growth (< 3.0 log cycles) in radish, broccoli, and mungbean sprouts but no growth in alfalfa and lentil sprouts. although the presumptive b. cereus isolates were enterotoxigenic, they did not produce or accumulate detectable levels of diarrheal toxins in freshly produced sprouts.

TI  == antibacterial activity of cerein 8a, a bacteriocin-like peptide produced by bacillus cereus.
AB  == the mode of action of cerein 8a, a bacteriocin produced by the soil bacterium bacillus cereus 8a, was investigated. the effect of cerein 8a was tested against  listeria monocytogenes and a bactericidal effect at 400 arbitrary units (au)/ml was observed. in addition, cerein 8a was bactericidal against bacillus cereus at  200 au/ml, and inhibited the growth of escherichia coli and salmonella enteritidis. stronger inhibition of these gram-negative bacteria was achieved when the chelating agent edta was added together with bacteriocin. the effect of  cerein 8a on b. cereus and l. monocytogenes was also investigated by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ftir). treated cells had an important frequency  increase at 2920 cm-1 and a decrease at 1400 cm-1, corresponding to assignments of fatty acids. transmission electron microscopy showed damaged cell walls and loss of protoplasmic material. these results suggest that the mode of action of cerein 8a is to interfere with cell membranes and the cell wall.

TI  == systematic determination of the mosaic structure of bacterial genomes: species backbone versus strain-specific loops.
AB  == background: public databases now contain multitude of complete bacterial genomes, including several genomes of the same species. the available data offers new opportunities to address questions about bacterial genome evolution, a task that  requires reliable fine comparison data of closely related genomes. recent analyses have shown, using pairwise whole genome alignments, that it is possible  to segment bacterial genomes into a common conserved backbone and strain-specific sequences called loops. results: here, we generalize this approach and propose a  strategy that allows systematic and non-biased genome segmentation based on multiple genome alignments. segmentation analyses, as applied to 13 different bacterial species, confirmed the feasibility of our approach to discern the 'mosaic' organization of bacterial genomes. segmentation results are available through a web interface permitting functional analysis, extraction and visualization of the backbone/loops structure of documented genomes. to illustrate the potential of this approach, we performed a precise analysis of the mosaic organization of three e. coli strains and functional characterization of the loops. conclusion: the segmentation results including the backbone/loops structure of 13 bacterial species genomes are new and available for use by the scientific community at the url: http://genome.jouy.inra.fr/mosaic.

TI  == in-house validation of the bactec 9240 blood culture system for detection of bacterial contamination in platelet concentrates.
AB  == background: at present, only two commercially available automated culture systems are cleared by the fda for the purpose of quality control (qc) testing for bacterial contamination of platelet (plt) concentrates: the bact/alert blood culture system (biomerieux) and the pall ebds (pall corporation), both of which allow testing of leukoreduced apheresis as well as whole blood-derived plts. after the decision of the aabb to institute universal qc testing of plt concentrates for evidence of bacterial contamination, in-house validation of the  performance of our current blood culture system, the bactec 9240, was carried out for this purpose. study design and methods: serial dilutions of nine species of bacteria commonly associated with plt contamination were prepared in one single-donor apheresis plt unit per organism. four ml of dilutions containing less than 1 to greater than 10(3) colony-forming units (cfus) per ml was inoculated into blood culture bottles (standard 10 aerobic/f, becton-dickinson diagnostic systems) and incubated in a bactec 9240 continuously monitored blood culture system. positive bottles were removed from the system and subcultured to  insure the identity of bacterial growth. results: with the exception of streptococcus mitis, the bactec system provided a detection sensitivity of less than 10 cfus per ml for staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, serratia marcescens, klebsiella pneumoniae, bacillus cereus, enterobacter cloacae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the limit of detection for the  s. mitis test strain was 61 cfus per ml. detection of positive bottles ranged from 6.5 to 17.6 hours depending on the species tested and the cell density of the inoculum. ongoing use of this system for bacterial detection yielded two true-positive samples from 3879 apheresis plt products collected at our hospital-based donor center over 9 months. conclusion: this study validates the use of the bactec 9240 continuously monitored blood culture system for the detection of low-level bacterial contamination in single donor apheresis plts in  less than 24 hours.

TI  == peptidoglycan n-acetylglucosamine deacetylases from bacillus cereus, highly conserved proteins in bacillus anthracis.
AB  == the genomes of bacillus cereus and its closest relative bacillus anthracis contain 10 polysaccharide deacetylase homologues. six of these homologues have been proposed to be peptidoglycan n-acetylglucosamine deacetylases. two of these  genes, namely bc1960 and bc3618, have been cloned and expressed in escherichia coli, and the recombinant enzymes have been purified to homogeneity and further characterized. both enzymes were effective in deacetylating cell wall peptidoglycan from the gram(+) bacillus cereus and bacillus subtilis and the gram(-) helicobacter pylori as well as soluble chitin substrates and n-acetylchitooligomers. however, the enzymes were not active on acetylated xylan. these results provide insight into the substrate specificity of carbohydrate esterase family 4 enzymes. it was revealed that both enzymes deacetylated only the glcnac residue of the synthetic muropeptide n-acetyl-d-glucosamine-(beta-1,4)-n-acetylmuramyl-l-alanine-d-isoglutamine. analysis of the constituent muropeptides of peptidoglycan from b. subtilis and h. pylori resulting from incubation of the enzymes bc1960 and bc3618 with these polymers and subsequent hydrolysis by cellosyl and mutanolysin, respectively, similarly revealed that both enzymes deacetylate glcnac residues of peptidoglycan. kinetic analysis toward glcnac(2-6) revealed that glcnac4 was the  favorable substrate for both enzymes. identification of the sequence of n-acetychitooligosaccharides (glcnac(2-4)) following enzymatic deacetylation by using 1h nmr revealed that both enzymes deacetylate all glcnac residues of the oligomers except the reducing end ones. enzymatic deacetylation of chemically acetylated vegetative peptidoglycan from b. cereus by bc1960 and bc3618 resulted  in increased resistance to lysozyme digestion. this is the first biochemical study of bacterial peptidoglycan n-acetylglucosamine deacetylases.

TI  == expanding the bactericidal action of the food color additive phloxine b to gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == phloxine b (d&c red no. 28) is a color additive for food, drugs, and cosmetics. it has been previously shown to have anti-staphylococcus aureus activities. in this work, the effect of phloxine b on various gram-negative bacteria and other gram-positive bacteria including bacillus cereus, bacillus thuringiensis, bacillus mycoides, bacillus subtilis, bacillus aureus, salmonella, escherichia coli and shigella was studied, along with the mechanism of anti-microbial activity. in the presence of fluorescent light, the viable count for gram-positive bacteria, (bacillus spp. and s. aureus) decreased in a dose and time dependent manner when incubated with phloxine b. the viability of gram-positive bacteria was reduced by 99.99% in 40 min, while there was no effect on gram-negative bacteria (salmonella choleraesuis, e. coli and shigella flexneri). however, the use of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (edta) expands the spectrum of activity for phloxine b to include gram-negative bacteria. edta increased membrane-permeability by releasing lipopolysaccharide. overall, in an agar diffusion test the light-dependent bactericidal activity of 1 microg of phloxine b had a potency of 0.64 units of chloramphenicol and 0.5 units of tetracycline when tested on b. cereus, and had a potency of 0.7 units of chloramphenicol and 0.2 units of tetracycline when tested on s. aureus. the data  suggest that the dye may have some potential anti-microbial applications.

AB  == papain (from papaya latex; ec 3.4.22.2) and pronase (from streptomyces griseus; ec 3.4.24.31) caused optimum depolymerization of chitosan at ph 3.5 and 37 degrees c, resulting in lmmc (low molecular mass chitosan) and chito-oligomeric-monomeric mixture. the yield of the latter was 14-16% and 14-19% respectively for papain- and pronase-catalysed reactions, depending on the reaction time (1-5 h). hplc revealed the presence of monomer(s) and oligomers of  dp (degree of polymerization) 2-6, which was also confirmed by matrix-assisted laser-desorption ionization-time-of-flight ms. along with the chito-oligomers, the appearance of only glcnac (n-acetylglucosamine) in pronase-catalysed chitosanolysis was indicative of its different action pattern compared with papain. fourier-transform infrared, liquid-state 13c-nmr spectra and cd analyses  of chito-oligomeric-monomeric mixture indicated the release of glcnac/glcnac-rich oligomers. the monomeric sequence at the non-reducing ends of chito-oligomers was elucidated using n-acetylglucosaminidase. the chito-oligomeric-monomeric mixture  showed better growth inhibitory activity towards bacillus cereus and escherichia  coli compared with native chitosan. optimum growth inhibition was observed with chito-oligomers of higher dp having low degree of acetylation. the latter caused  pore formation and permeabilization of the cell wall of b. cereus, whereas blockage of nutrient flow due to the aggregation of chito-oligomers-monomers was  responsible for the growth inhibition and lysis of e. coli, which were evidenced  by scanning electron microscopy analysis. the spillage of cytoplasmic enzymes and native page of the cell-free supernatant of b. cereus treated with chito-oligomeric-monomeric mixture further confirmed bactericidal activity of the latter. use of papain and pronase, which are inexpensive and easily available, for chitosanolysis, is of commercial importance, as the products released are of  considerable biomedical value.

AB  == temperature effect on growth rates of listeria monocytogenes, salmonella, escherichia coli, clostridium perfringens and bacillus cereus, was studied. growth rates were obtained in laboratory medium by using a binary dilutions method in which 15 optical density curves were generated to determine one mu value. the temperature was in the range from 2 to 48 degrees c, depending on the  bacterial species. data were analysed after a square root transformation. no large difference between the strains of a same species was observed, and therefore all the strains of a same species were analysed together with the same  secondary model. the variability of the residual error, including both measurements errors and biological strain difference, was homogenous for sub-optimal temperature values. to represent this variability in bacterial kinetic simulation, the 95% confidence interval based on an asymptotic normal distribution, around the growth rate value was determined. with this modelling approach, the behaviour of bacterial species on food, irrespective of the strain  or the laboratory, was described. this growth simulation with confidence limits has several applications, such as to facilitate comparisons between a challenge-test and simulation results, and, to appreciate if the temperature change has or has not a significant effect on a bacterial growth profile, with regard to the uncontrolled factors. the integration of this piece of work in the  sym'previus software is now in process. results obtained in five french laboratories will be extended by working on new food and new microbial species and improved by further work on variability estimation.

AB  == a homologue of the bacillus subtilis fur gene was identified in bacillus cereus and characterized. the predicted amino acid sequence of the cloned gene was found to be highly similar to other members of the fur family of transcriptional regulators. the b. cereus fur gene was shown to partially complement an escherichia coli fur mutant. purified b. cereus fur bound specifically to a 19 bp dna sequence homologous to the b. subtilis fur box in a metal-dependent manner. analysis of the available b. cereus genome data identified a number of genes which contain predicted fur box sequences in the promoter region. many of these genes are predicted to play a role in bacterial iron uptake and metabolism, but several have also been implicated as having a role in virulence. fur and iron regulation of a siderophore biosynthesis operon was confirmed in a beta-galactosidase assay. a b. cereus fur null strain was constructed by allelic  replacement of the chromosomal gene with a copy disrupted with a kanamycin resistance cassette. the deltafur mutant was found to constitutively express siderophores, to accumulate iron intracellularly to a level approximately threefold greater than the wild-type, and to be hypersensitive to hydrogen peroxide. in an insect infection model, the virulence of the fur null strain was  found to be significantly attenuated, highlighting the essential role played by fur in the virulence of this pathogen.

TI  == behavior of escherichia coli cells and bacillus cereus spores on poplar wood crates by impedance measurements.
AB  == dry poplar wood crates and glass surfaces (bottoms of pyrex flasks) were contaminated with aqueous suspensions of escherichia coli collection de l'institut pasteur (cip) 54.8 cells or bacillus cereus cip 78.3 spores. after different periods of storage at 25 degrees c, the number of cells still present on both surfaces was determined by impedance microbiology. the physical and chemical properties of the wood greatly and rapidly decreased the number of cells. after 4 h of contact time, b. cereus residual metabolic activity corresponded to less than 10% of the initial inoculum level. with a low inoculum  level of 2.4 x 10(2) e. coli cells, sterility of the wood was obtained after a contact time of 24 h. with a higher inoculum level of 10(6) e. coli cells, only a few viable bacteria, corresponding to the metabolic activity of four cells, could be recovered after a prolonged contact time of 145 h. conversely, under the same  conditions of storage, when bacteria were deposited on inert and nonporous materials such as glass surfaces, growth occurred. after 24 h of contact time at  25 degrees c, bacterial populations were about 10(9) cells for e. coli and 10(7)  cells for b. cereus. under our experimental conditions after a prolonged contact  time, wood exhibited growth-inhibiting properties and cells were no longer metabolically active. these results indicate that the potential for cross-contamination of foods stored directly in contact with previously contaminated poplar wood crates is low under our experimental conditions.

TI  == high-level expression and characterization of two chitinases, chich and chicw, of bacillus cereus 28-9 in escherichia coli.
AB  == many chitinase genes have been cloned and sequenced from prokaryotes and eukaryotes but overexpression of chitinases in escherichia coli cells was less reported. chich and chicw of bacillus cereus 28-9 belong to two distinct groups based on their amino acid sequences of catalytic domains, and in addition, domain structures of two enzymes are different. in this study, we established an ideal method for high-level expression of chitinases in e. coli as glutathione-s-transferase fusion proteins using pgex-6p-1 vector. both chich and  chicw were successfully highly expressed in e. coli cells as soluble gst-chitinase fusion proteins, and recombinant native chich and chicw could be purified after cleavage with prescission protease to remove gst tag. purified chitinases were used for biochemical characterization of kinetics, hydrolysis products, and binding activities. the results indicate that chicw is an endo-chitinase and effectively hydrolyzes chitin and chito-multimers to chito-oligomers and the end product chitobiose, and chich is an exo-chitinase and degrades chito-oligomers to produce chitobiose. furthermore, due to higher affinity of chicw toward colloidal chitin than avicel, c-terminal domain of chicw should be classified as a chitin-binding domain not a cellulose-binding domain although that was revealed as a cellulose-binding domain by conserved domain analysis. therefore, the method of high-level expression of chitinases is helpful to studies and applications of chitinases.

TI  == antibacterial activity and specificity of the six human {alpha}-defensins.
AB  == we developed a kinetic, 96-well turbidimetric procedure that is capable of testing the antimicrobial properties of six human alpha-defensins concurrently on a single microplate. the defensins were prepared by solid-phase peptide synthesis and tested against gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus and bacillus cereus) and gram-negative bacteria (enterobacter aerogenes and escherichia coli). analysis of the growth curves provided virtual lethal doses (vlds) equivalent to  conventional 50% lethal doses (ld(50)s), ld(90)s, ld(99)s, and ld(99.9)s obtained from colony counts. on the basis of their respective vld(90)s and vld(99)s, the relative potencies of human myeloid alpha-defensins against s. aureus were hnp2 > hnp1 > hnp3 > hnp4. in contrast, their relative potencies against e. coli and e.  aerogenes were hnp4 > hnp2 > hnp1 = hnp3. hd5 was as effective as hnp2 against s. aureus and as effective as hnp4 against the gram-negative bacteria in our panel.  hd6 showed little or no activity against any of the bacteria in our panel, including b. cereus, which was highly susceptible to the other five alpha-defensins. the assay described provides a quantitative, precise, and economical way to study the antimicrobial activities of host-defense peptides. its use has clarified the relative potencies of human alpha-defensins and raised  intriguing questions about the in vivo function(s) of hd6.

TI  == characterization of the bacillus cereus nhe enterotoxin.
AB  == the non-haemolytic enterotoxin (nhe) is one of two three-component enterotoxins responsible for the diarrhoeal food-poisoning syndrome caused by bacillus cereus. nhe is composed of nhea, nheb and nhec. the three genes encoding the nhe components constitute an operon, and the transcriptional start site is located 61 bp upstream of the nhea translational start site. the nhe genes were cloned separately, and expressed in either bacillus subtilis or escherichia coli. separate expression showed that all three components were required for biological activity. in addition, nhea and nheb were purified from b. cereus culture supernatants. as nhec seems to be expressed in only small amounts by b. cereus, nhec was expressed and purified as a histidine-tagged fusion protein. the maximum cytotoxic activity was obtained when the molar ratio between nhea : nheb : his6-nhec was 10 : 10 : 1, and it was shown that nheb was the binding component of the enterotoxin complex.

TI  == detection and identification of bacteria in a juice matrix with fourier transform-near infrared spectroscopy and multivariiate analysis.
AB  == the use of fourier transform-near infrared (ft-nir) spectroscopy combined with multivariate pattern recognition techniques was evaluated to address the need for a fast and senisitive method for the detection of bacterial contamination in liquids. the complex cellular composition of bacteria produces ft-nir vibrational transitions (overtone and combination bands), forming the basis for identification and subtyping. a database including strains of escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacillus subtilis, bacillus cereus, and bacillus thuringiensis was built, with special care taken to optimize sample preparation.  the bacterial cells were treated with 70% (vol/vol) ethanolto enhance safe handling of pathogenic strains and then concentrated on an aluminum oxide membrane to obtain a thin bacterial film. this simple membrane filtration procedure generated reproducible ft-nir spectra that allowed for the rapid discrimination among closely related strains. principal component analysis and soft independent modeling of class analogy of transformed spectra in the region 5,100 to 4,400 cm(-1) were able to discriminate between bacterial species. spectroscopic analysis of apple juices inoculated with different strains of e. coli at approximately 10(5) cfu/ml showed that ft-nir spectralfeatures are consistent with bacterial contamination and soft independent modeling of class analogy correctly predicted the identity of the contaminant as strains of e. coli. ft-nir in conjunction with multivariate techniques can be used for the rapid and accurate evaluation of potential bacterial contamination in liquids with minimal sample manipulation, and hence limited exposure of the laboratory worker to the agents.

TI  == [interaction of neomycin with other antibiotics on selected bacterial strains].
AB  == antimicrobial combinations are used most frequently to provide broad-spectrum empirical coverage in the treatment of bacterial infections. however, combination of two antibiotics may not influence their activity, may lead to synergy or antagonism in the activity. neomycin may be combined with one of the following antibiotics: ampicillin, procaine penicillin, gramicidin, bacitracin, polymyxin b, lincomycin, oxytetracycline, and erythromycin in some human and veterinary multiantibiotic drugs distributed in poland. the checkerboard method has been one of the traditional assays for the measurement of antibiotic interactions. the aim of this study was to analyse the activity interaction of neomycin with second antibiotic in multiantibiotic drugs distributed in poland on standards and clinical bacterial strains. checkerboard results for all strains demonstrated synergism for 2.5% of combinations, only for standards strains. in one case salmonella enteritidis, in combination of neomycin with bacitracin, inhibition effect was observed. additive effects were predominant--49%. in 18% neutral effects were shown, but in 26% of combinations fic indexes were not possible to calculate, because of the resistance of clinical strains to the highest concentration of at least one antibiotic. in combination of aminoglycoside (neomycin) with beta-lactams antibiotics (ampicillin, procaine penicillin) in vitro, no synergy was observed for all examined strains. the best results were achieved for combinations of neomycin with peptide antibiotics (polymyxin, gramicidin and bacitracin)--5 for all 6 synergy effect observed.

AB  == haemolysin ii, hlyii, is one of several cytotoxic proteins produced by bacillus cereus, an opportunistic human pathogen that causes food poisoning. the hlyii gene confers haemolytic activity to escherichia coli cells. here a new b. cereus  gene, hlyiir, which is located immediately downstream of hlyii and regulates hlyii expression, is reported. the deduced amino acid sequence of hlyiir is similar to prokaryotic dna-binding transcriptional regulators of the tetr/acra family. measurements of haemolytic activity levels and of hlyii promoter activity levels using gene fusions and primer-extension assays demonstrated that, in e. coli, hlyii transcription decreased in the presence of hlyiir. recombinant hlyiir binds to a 22 bp inverted dna repeat centred 48 bp upstream of the hlyii promoter transcription initiation point. in vitro transcription studies showed that hlyiir inhibits transcription from the hlyii promoter by binding to the 22 bp repeat and rna polymerase, and by decreasing the formation of the catalytically competent open promoter complex.

TI  == a rapid bioassay for single bacterial cell quantitation using bioconjugated nanoparticles.
AB  == the rapid and sensitive determination of pathogenic bacteria is extremely important in biotechnology, medical diagnosis, and the current fight against bioterrorism. current methods either lack ultrasensitivity or take a long time for analysis. here, we report a bioconjugated nanoparticle-based bioassay for in  situ pathogen quantification down to single bacterium within 20 min. the bioconjugated nanoparticle provides an extremely high fluorescent signal for bioanalysis and can be easily incorporated with biorecognition molecules, such as antibody. the antibody-conjugated nanoparticles can readily and specifically identify a variety of bacterium, such as escherichia coli o157:h7, through antibody-antigen interaction and recognition. the single-bacterium-detection capability within 20 min has been confirmed by the plate-counting method and realized by using two independent optical techniques. the two detection methods correlated extremely well. furthermore, we were able to detect multiple bacterial samples with high throughput by using a 384-well microplate format. to show the usefulness of this assay, we have accurately detected 1-400 e. coli o157 bacterial cells in spiked ground beef samples. our results demonstrate the potential for a broad application of bioconjugated nanoparticles in practical biotechnological and medical applications in various biodetection systems. the ultimate power of integrating bionanotechnology into complex biological systems will emerge as a revolutionary tool for ultrasensitive detection of disease markers and infectious agents.

AB  == background: bacterial contamination of platelet (plt) concentrates can result in  transfusion-transmitted sepsis. a photochemical treatment (pct) process with amotosalen hcl and long-wavelength ultraviolet light (uva), which cross-links nucleic acids, was developed to inactivate bacteria and other pathogens in plt concentrates. study design and methods: high titers of pathogenic aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive bacteria (10 species), aerobic gram-negative bacteria (7  species), and spirochetes (2 species) were added to single-donor plt concentrates containing 3.0 x 10(11) to 6.0 x 10(11) plts in approximately 300 ml of 35 percent plasma and 65 percent plt additive solution (intersol, baxter healthcare) or saline. after pct with 150 micro mol per l amotosalen and 3 j per cm(2) uva, residual bacterial levels were detected by sensitive microbiologic methods. results: the level of inactivation of viable bacteria was expressed as log reduction. log reduction of gram-positive bacteria for staphylococcus epidermidis was > 6.6; for staphylococcus aureus, 6.6; for streptococcus pyogenes, > 6.8; for listeria monocytogenes, > 6.3; for corynebacterium minutissimum, > 6.3; for bacillus cereus (vegetative), > 5.5; for lactobacillus sp., > 6.4; for bifidobacterium adolescentis, > 6.0; for propionibacterium acnes, > 6.2; and for  clostridium perfringens, > 6.5. log reduction of gram-negative bacteria for escherichia coli was > 6.4; for serratia marcescens, > 6.7; for klebsiella pneumoniae, > 5.6; for pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4.5; for salmonella choleraesuis,  > 6.2; for yersinia enterocolitica, > 5.9; and for enterobacter cloacae, 5.9. log reduction of spirochetes for treponema pallidum was 6.8 to 7.0, and for borrelia  burgdorferi, > 6.9. conclusion: pct inactivates high levels of a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria. the inactivation of bacteria in plt concentrates offers the potential to prospectively prevent plt-transfusion-associated bacteremia.

TI  == glycopeptide derived from hen egg ovomucin has the ability to bind enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli o157:h7.
AB  == ovomucin glycopeptide (ogp) was prepared by size exclusion chromatography after pronase digestion of hen egg ovomucin, and the binding of ogp to foodborne pathogens (bacillus cereus,clostridium perfringens, escherichia coli o157:h7, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella enteritidis, salmonella typhimurium, and staphylococcus aureus) was investigaed. binding assays with biotinylated bacteria as probes in microtiter plates showed that ogp bound to only e. coli o157:h7 among these foodborne pathogens. periodate treatment markedly reduced the binding ability, indicating that e. coli o157:h7 bound to carbohydrate moieties of ogp. lectin blot analysis with maackia amurensis (maa) and sambucus nigra (sna), which are specific for oligosaccharides containing sialic acid, revealed their binding  sites in ogp were similar to the e. coli o157:h7 binding sites that were probed with biotinylated e. coli o157:h7 after western blotting of ogp. sialydase treatment of ogp abolished its ability to bind e. coli o157:h7, demonstrating that sialic acid played an important role in the binding. these results suggest that ogp has e. coli o157:h7-specific binding sites that consist of sialic acid.  on the basis of these properties, ogp has the potential to be an ingredient with  a protective effect against e. coli o157:h7 infection and to be a novel probe for the detection of e. coli o157:h7 in the food hygiene field.

TI  == anaerobic growth of bacillus mojavensis and bacillus subtilis requires deoxyribonucleosides or dna.
AB  == bacillus mojavensis strains jf-2 (atcc 39307), rob2, and abo21191(t) and bacillus subtilis strains 168 (atcc 23857) and atcc 12332 required four deoxyribonucleosides or dna for growth under strict anaerobic conditions. bacillus licheniformis strains l89-11 and l87-11, bacillus sonorensis strain tg8-8, and bacillus cereus (atcc 14579) did not require dna for anaerobic growth. the requirement for the deoxyribonucleosides or dna did not occur under aerobic growth conditions. the addition of a mixture of five nucleic acid bases, four ribonucleotides, or four ribonucleosides to the basal medium did not replace the  requirement of b. mojavensis jf-2 for the four deoxyribonucleosides. however, the addition of salmon sperm dna, herring sperm dna, escherichia coli dna, or synthetic dna (single or double stranded) to the basal medium supported anaerobic growth. the addition of four deoxyribonucleosides to the basal medium allowed aerobic growth of b. mojavensis jf-2 in the presence of hydroxyurea. b. mojavensis did not grow in dna-supplemented basal medium that lacked sucrose as the energy source. these data provide strong evidence that externally supplied deoxyribonucleosides can be used to maintain a balanced deoxyribonucleotide pool  for dna synthesis and suggest that ribonucleotide reductases may not be essential to the bacterial cell cycle nor are they necessarily part of a minimal bacterial  genome.

TI  == antibacterial activities of naturally occurring compounds against antibiotic-resistant bacillus cereus vegetative cells and spores, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == after demonstrating the lack of effectiveness of standard antibiotics against the acquired antibiotic resistance of bacillus cereus (nctc 10989), escherichia coli  (nctc 1186), and staphylococcus aureus (atcc 12715), we showed that the following natural substances were antibacterial against these resistant pathogens: cinnamon oil, oregano oil, thyme oil, carvacrol, (s)-perillaldehyde, 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic  acid (beta-resorcylic acid), and 3,4-dihydroxyphenethylamine (dopamine). exposure of the three pathogens to a dilution series of the test compounds showed that oregano oil was the most active substance. the oils and pure compounds exhibited  exceptional activity against b. cereus vegetative cells, with oregano oil being active at nanogram per milliliter levels. in contrast, activities against b. cereus spores were very low. activities of the test compounds were in the following approximate order: oregano oil > thyme oil approximately carvacrol > cinnamon oil > perillaldehyde > dopamine > beta-resorcylic acid. the order of susceptibilities of the pathogens to inactivation was as follows: b. cereus (vegetative) >> s. aureus approximately e. coli >> b. cereus (spores). some of the test substances may be effective against antibiotic-resistant bacteria in foods and feeds.

TI  == use of a fluorescent viability stain to assess lethal and sublethal injury in food-borne bacteria exposed to high-intensity pulsed electric fields.
AB  == aims: to apply scanning electron microscopy, image analysis and a fluorescent viability stain to assess lethal and sublethal in food-borne bacteria exposed to  high-intensity pulsed electric fields (pef). methods and results: a rapid cellular staining method using the fluorescent redox probes 5-cyano-2,3-ditolyl tetrazolium chloride (ctc) and 4',6-diamidino-2-phylindole was used for enumerating actively respiring cells of listeria mononcytogenes, bacillus cereus  and escherichia coli. this respiratory staining (rs) approach provided good agreement with the conventional plate count agar method for enumerating untreated and high-intensity pef-treated bacteria suspended in 0.1% (w/v) peptone water. however, test organisms subjected to similar levels of lethality by heating at 56 degrees c resulted in ca 3-log-unit difference in surviving cell numbers ml(-1) when enumerated by these different viability indicators. pef-treated bacteria were markedly altered at the cellular level when examined by scanning electron microscopy. conclusions: while pef-treatment did not produce sublethally injured  cells (p < 0.05), substantial subpopulations of test bacteria rendered incapable  of forming colonies by heating may remain metabolically active. significance and  impact of the study: the fluorescent staining method offers interesting perspectives on assessing established and novel microbial inactivation methods. use of this approach may also provide a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in microbial inactivation induced by pef.

TI  == application of oligonucleotide array technology for the rapid detection of pathogenic bacteria of foodborne infections.
AB  == a rapid and accurate method for detection for common pathogenic bacteria in foodborne infections was established by using oligonucleotide array technology. nylon membrane was used as the array support. a mutation region of the 23s rrna gene was selected as the discrimination target from 14 species (genera) of bacteria causing foodborne infections and two unrelated bacterial species. a pair of universal primers was designed for pcr amplification of the 23s rrna gene. twenty-one species (genera)-specific oligonucleotide detection probes were synthesized and spotted onto the nylon membranes. the 23s rrna gene amplification products of 14 species of pathogenic bacteria were hybridized to the oligonucleotide array. hybridization results were analyzed with digoxigenin-linked enzyme reaction. results indicated that nine species of pathogenic bacteria (escherichia coli, campylobacter jejuni, shigella dysenteriae, vibrio cholerae, vibrio parahaemolyticus, proteus vulgaris, bacillus cereus, listeria monocytogenes and clostridium botulinum) showed high sensitivity and specificity for the oligonucleotide array. two other species (salmonella enterica and yersinia enterocolitica) gave weak cross-reaction with e. coli, but  the reaction did not affect their detection. after redesigning the probes, positive hybridization results were obtained with staphylococcus aureus, but not  with clostridium perfringens and streptococcus pyogenes. the oligonucleotide array can also be applied to samples collected in clinical settings of foodborne  infections. the superiority of oligonucleotide array over other tests lies on its rapidity, accuracy and efficiency in the diagnosis, treatment and control of foodborne infections.

AB  == background: bacterial detection of platelet (plt)-rich-plasma (prp)-derived plts  presents unique challenges for countries that do not allow pooling before storage. this study validated the bact/alert for use in testing pooled prp-derived plts with nine contaminating organisms. study design and methods: isolates of bacillus cereus, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, serratia marcescens, streptococcus viridans, and propionibacterium acnes were inoculated into two prp-derived plt pools (target, 10 and 100 colony-forming units [cfus]/ml; actual recovered concentrations, 5 and 90 cfus/ml). four milliliters of each postbacterial inoculation sample was inoculated into both plastic aerobic and anaerobic bottles and 0.5 ml was plated onto blood agar. results: all organisms (excluding p. acnes) were detected in 8.2 to 22.0 and 7.6 to 20.3 hours (10 and 100 cfus/ml, respectively) and the mean time to detection was 15.0 and 13.1 hours (10 and 100 cfus/ml, respective). p. acnes was detected with the anaerobic bottles in a mean of 74.9 and 64.3 hours (10 and 100 cfus/ml, respectively). with e. cloacae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, s. marcescens, and s. viridans detection with the anaerobic bottles was faster or equivalent to the detection with the aerobic bottles. this was most notable with s. viridans where  the anaerobic bottle was reactive on average 21.6 and 10.8 hours (10 and 100 cfus/ml, respectively) faster than the aerobic bottle. conclusions: this study validates the use of the bact/alert system for the detection of bacteria in prp-derived plts in a pooled format. overall, the use of the bact/alert system allowed the detection of pooled prp-derived plts inoculated with nine bacteria at 10 and 100 cfus per ml in 7.6 to 22.0 hours (excluding p. acnes).

TI  == essential oils: their antibacterial properties and potential applications in foods--a review.
AB  == in vitro studies have demonstrated antibacterial activity of essential oils (eos) against listeria monocytogenes, salmonella typhimurium, escherichia coli o157:h7, shigella dysenteria, bacillus cereus and staphylococcus aureus at levels between  0.2 and 10 microl ml(-1). gram-negative organisms are slightly less susceptible than gram-positive bacteria. a number of eo components has been identified as effective antibacterials, e.g. carvacrol, thymol, eugenol, perillaldehyde, cinnamaldehyde and cinnamic acid, having minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of 0.05-5 microl ml(-1) in vitro. a higher concentration is needed to achieve the same effect in foods. studies with fresh meat, meat products, fish, milk, dairy products, vegetables, fruit and cooked rice have shown that the concentration needed to achieve a significant antibacterial effect is around 0.5-20 microl g(-1) in foods and about 0.1-10 microl ml(-1) in solutions for washing fruit and  vegetables. eos comprise a large number of components and it is likely that their mode of action involves several targets in the bacterial cell. the hydrophobicity of eos enables them to partition in the lipids of the cell membrane and mitochondria, rendering them permeable and leading to leakage of cell contents. physical conditions that improve the action of eos are low ph, low temperature and low oxygen levels. synergism has been observed between carvacrol and its precursor p-cymene and between cinnamaldehyde and eugenol. synergy between eo components and mild preservation methods has also been observed. some eo components are legally registered flavourings in the eu and the usa. undesirable  organoleptic effects can be limited by careful selection of eos according to the  type of food.

TI  == validation of a microbiological method: the star protocol, a five-plate test, for the screening of antibiotic residues in milk.
AB  == the results of an in-house laboratory validation of a microbiological method for  the screening of antibiotic residues in milk are presented. the sensitivity of this five-plate test, called screening test for antibiotic residues (star), was established by the analysis of milk samples spiked with 66 antibiotics at eight different concentrations. ten different groups of antibiotics were studied: macrolides, aminoglycosides, cephalosporins, penicillins, quinolones, tetracyclines, sulphonamides, lincosamides, phenicolated and miscellaneous drugs. it was shown that 21 antibiotics were detected by the star protocol at or below the maximum residue limit (mrl), and that a further 27 drugs could be detected at levels from the mrl up to four times the mrl. the sensitivity of the star protocol was at or below the mrl for three macrolides, one tetracycline, two aminoglycosides, some sulphonamides, half of the beta-lactams, quinolones, lincosamides, trimethoprim and baquiloprim. moreover, the star protocol was at least twice as sensitive as conventional methods for macrolides, quinolones and tetracyclines. the other antibiotics had limits of detection between four and 150 times the mrl. each plate was preferentially sensitive for one or two families of antibacterials: the plate bacillus cereus for tetracyclines, the plate escherichia coli for quinolones, the plate basillus subtilis for aminoglycosides, the plate kocuria varians for macrolides, and the plate bacillus stearothermophilus for sulphonamides and beta-lactams. this method has been used  routinely on a day-to-day basis to direct the physicochemical confirmation towards one or two families of antibiotics. considering the high cost of liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry detection analyses, the reduction of the range of antibiotics to test for confirmation is a significant gain in time and money.

TI  == influence of the cell wall on ciprofloxacin susceptibility in selected wild-type  gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == the susceptibility of several wild-type bacteria to ciprofloxacin and accumulation of the drug in these bacteria were evaluated. species studied included escherichia coli, serratia marcescens, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis and bacillus cereus. ciprofloxacin susceptibility was measured for each strain using two different methods: the minimal inhibitory concentration and the bactericidal index. significant differences were observed between the results derived from these two methods. whereas the minimal inhibitory concentration was low in all strains tested, ciprofloxacin's bactericidal activity, as indicated by the bactericidal index, varied with the species studied. to determine whether this finding was due to variations in cell envelope permeability to ciprofloxacin (i.e. to combined cell  uptake and efflux), we studied ciprofloxacin accumulation using spectrofluorometry. in gram-negative bacteria, differences in permeability can lead to altered susceptibility to antibiotics. in fact, the combination of slow uptake and efficient efflux seems to be crucial to the characteristic poor susceptibility of p. aeruginosa to ciprofloxacin. however, the low level of activity of ciprofloxacin against s. aureus and two bacillus species may have resulted from the drug's interaction with its target enzymes (i.e. topoisomerase  iv in s. aureus and dna gyrase in bacillus spp.) rather than diminished permeability.

AB  == insulator-based dielectrophoresis (idep) was utilized to separate and concentrate selectively mixtures of two species of live bacteria simultaneously. four species of bacteria were studied: the gram-negative escherichia coli and the gram-positive bacillus subtilis, b. cereus, and b. megaterium. under an applied direct current (dc) electric field all the bacterial species exhibited negative dielectrophoretic behavior. the dielectrophoretic separations were carried out in a glass microchannel containing an array of insulating posts. the insulating posts in the microchannel produced nonuniformities in the electric field applied  along the channel. mixtures of two species of bacteria were introduced into the microchannel and the electric field was applied. the bacterial species exhibited  different dielectrophoretic mobilities under the influence of the nonuniform field. from these experiments a trapping order was established with e. coli trapping at the weakest applied electric field, while the bacillus species were trapped at different characteristic threshold fields. at stronger applied electric fields, the two different species of bacteria in the microchannel were dielectrophoretically trapped into two spatially distinct bands. the results showed that idep has the potential to selectively concentrate and separate different species of bacteria.

AB  == the ability of numerous diverse compounds and ions to cross the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane by diffusion and active transport is highly dependent on cytoplasmic membrane fluidity, which can be measured using fluorescent probes to  estimate membrane polarization values. however, membrane polarization data are lacking for most bacterial species. the cytoplasmic membrane polarization values  for arthrobacter sp. atcc 21908, bacillus cereus nrc 3045, pseudomonas fluorescens r2f, pseudomonas putida nrc 2986 and escherichia coli c600 bacterial  cells were spectrofluorometrically measured over a temperature range from 10 to 50 degrees c, and in the absence and presence of 1 microg/ml tetracycline, using  the fluorescent probe 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (dph) to obtain new information on their membrane fluidity. at an assay temperature of 10 degrees c,  e. coli cells grown in the absence of tetracycline exhibited the highest cytoplasmic membrane polarization value (least fluid membrane) of 0.446, followed by values of 0.392, 0.371, 0.344 and 0.293, respectively, for b. cereus, arthrobacter sp., p. fluorescens and p. putida. at an assay temperature of 30 degrees c, the polarization values ranged from 0.357 to 0.288 for cells grown in  the absence of tetracycline, regardless of the species. b. cereus grown in the presence of 1 microg/ml tetracycline had lower polarization values than when grown in the absence of this antibiotic at all assay temperatures. regardless of  the absence or presence of 1 microg/ml tetracycline in the growth medium, all bacterial species generally exhibited a more fluid membrane as the assay temperature increased from 10 to 50 degrees c. to our knowledge, these are some of the first cytoplasmic membrane polarization values reported for these gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria over a broad temperature range and also  for cells grown in the presence of tetracycline.

TI  == sensitization of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria to jenseniin g by sublethal injury.
AB  == jenseniin g, a bacteriocin produced by propionibacterium thoenii p126, is active  against related propionibacteria and some lactic acid bacteria and is sporostatic to botulinal spores. the objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of sublethal stress on jenseniin g activity. bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella typhimurium, shigella flexneri, staphylococcus aureus, and yersinia enterocolitica were subjected to temperature, acid, and osmotic stresses in the presence of jenseniin g. the bacteriocin reduced the viability of sublethally injured cultures, although the extent of reduction varied with strain and treatment. e. faecalis was the most sensitive to temperature stress; no reduction of viable counts occurred in the absence of jenseniin g, and a 1.5-log reduction occurred in the presence of jenseniin g. b. cereus, l. monocytogenes, and s. aureus were more sensitive to jenseniin g when exposed to heat stress than when exposed to cold stress, whereas e. coli, salmonella typhimurium, and s. flexneri were more sensitive to jenseniin g when exposed to cold stress than when exposed to heat stress. when comparing an acid stress test alone to a combination of acid stress and jenseniin g, e. faecalis and l. monocytogenes showed the greatest sensitivities with 4.87- and 2.82-log reductions, respectively, after 7 days. all cultures except for s. aureus were adversely affected by the combination of salt stress and jenseniin g. salmonella typhimurium showed the greatest sensitivity to salt stress with jenseniin g (a 1.54-log reduction at day 7) when compared to salt stress alone (a 0.55-log reduction at day 7). jenseniin g, like bacteriocins produced by other gram-positive species, has broader activity against stressed organisms.

AB  == previous mosquito studies showed that the hemocyte-mediated innate immune response against gram- escherichia coli is phagocytosis, but against gram+ micrococcus sp., is melanization. we examined the immune responses mounted by aedes aegypti towards gram- enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and salmonella typhimurium, and gram+ bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis. using light microscopy, electron microscopy, and survival analysis, this investigation conclusively shows that the factors governing phagocytic vs. melanization responses are complex and independent of bacterial gram type and pathogenicity. these data provide further evidence that hemocytes are central to  the immune response against prokaryotes.

AB  == a minireplicon of plasmid pxo2 of bacillus anthracis was isolated by molecular cloning in escherichia coli and shown to replicate in b. anthracis, bacillus cereus, and bacillus subtilis. the pxo2 replicon included (i) an open reading frame encoding the putative reps replication initiation protein and (ii) the putative origin of replication. the reps protein was expressed as a fusion with the maltose binding protein (mbp) at its amino-terminal end and purified by affinity chromatography. electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that the purified mbp-reps protein bound specifically to a 60-bp region corresponding to the putative origin of replication of pxo2 located immediately downstream of the  reps open reading frame. competition dna binding experiments showed that the 5' and central regions of the putative origin were important for reps binding. mbp-reps also bound nonspecifically to single-stranded dna with a lower affinity.

TI  == antibacterial effects of carica papaya fruit on common wound organisms.
AB  == the purpose of the study was to investigate antibacterial activity of ripe and unripe carica papaya on selected micro-organisms. cultures of micro-organisms were routinely maintained in nutrient agar slants at 4 degrees c. extracts of immature, mature and ripe carica papaya fruit were obtained by separately grinding factions of the epicarp, endocarp and seeds and filtering them through gauze. sensitivity tests were conducted by adding 0.06 ml of extract to agar wells (6 mm diameter) prepared from 20 ml agar seeded with 10(6) cells/ml suspension of one of the eight organisms per plate. the inoculated plates were allowed to equilibrate at 4 degrees c for 1 hour, incubated at 37 degrees c for 24 hours, and zones of inhibition measured in millimetres. anti-bacterial activity was expressed in terms of the radius of zone of inhibition. seed extracts from the fruit showed inhibition in the following order: b cereus > e coli > s faecalis > s aureus > p vulgaris > s flexneri. no significant difference was found in bacterial sensitivity between immature, mature and ripe fruits. no inhibition zone was produced by epicarp and endocarp extracts. carica papaya seeds contain anti-bacterial activity that inhibits growth of gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. observed activity was independent of stage of fruit maturity. carica papaya has antibacterial effects that could be useful in treating chronic skin ulcers to promote healing.

TI  == bacterial populations associated with meat from the deboning room of a high throughput red meat abattoir.
AB  == developing countries are faced with high incidences of food poisoning outbreaks,  with obvious economic consequences. in highly perishable foodstuffs such as fresh red meat the threat of food poisoning is particularly intense. in this study, red meat samples were collected from a deboning room of a high throughput abattoir. the samples were analysed for the presence of bacillus cereus., staphylococcus aureus., pseudomonas spp., listeria monocytogenes., escherichia coli and salmonella spp. the aerobic plate counts as well as enterobacteriaceae were also  enumerated. almost without exception the counts exceeded the microbiological guidelines for raw meat as proposed by the south african department of health. the average b. cereus count over the sampling period was 8.32 x 10(3) cfu, g (-1), for s. aureus and pseudomonas spp. 1.72 x 10(5) and 1.7 x 10(5) cfu g(-1) respectively and for e. coli 3.4 x 10(5) cfu g(-1). sixty percent of the samples  were positive for presumptive salmonella spp. while 52% of the samples tested positive for the presence of l. monocytogenes. the aerobic plate and enterobacteriaceae counts were 1.7 x 10(7) and 4.6 x 10(6) cfu g(-1), respectively. the data highlighted the need for a more systematic approach to ensuring safe food through implementing quality control methods to prevent the entry and proliferation of pathogens in meat and meat products, especially during processes with a high degree of handling, such as deboning.

AB  == a water-soluble chitosan hydrolysate with high activity against escherichia coli  was obtained during cellulase digestion of chitosan for 18 h. this 18-h hydrolysate is composed of low-molecular-weight chitosan (lmwc), with a molecular weight of 12.0 kda, and chitooligosaccharides, which are composed of sugars with  a degree of polymerization of 1 to 8. lmwc has a strong activity at 100 ppm against many pathogens and yeast species, including bacillus cereus, e. coli, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella enterica serovar typhi, and saccharomyces cerevisiae, while the chitooligosaccharides have much weaker antimicrobial activity than does lmwc. accordingly, the antimicrobial activity against e. coli in the 18-h hydrolysate proved to come mainly from the presence of lmwc.

AB  == an experimental protocol to validate secondary-model application to foods was suggested. escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens, and salmonella were observed in various food categories, such as meat, dairy, egg, or seafood products. the secondary model validated in this study was based on the gamma concept, in which the environmental factors temperature, ph, and water activity (aw) were introduced as individual terms with microbe-dependent parameters, and the effect of foodstuffs on the growth rates of these species was described with a food- and microbe-dependent parameter. this food-oriented approach was carried out by challenge testing, generally at 15 and  10 degrees c for l. monocytogenes, e. coli, b. cereus, and salmonella and at 25 and 20 degrees c for c. perfringens. about 222 kinetics in foods were generated.  the results were compared to simulations generated by existing software, such as  pmp. the bias factor was also calculated. the methodology to obtain a food-dependent parameter (fitting step) and therefore to compare results given by models with new independent data (validation step) is discussed in regard to its  food safety application. the proposed methods were used within the french national program of predictive microbiology, sym'previus, to include challenge test results in the database and to obtain predictive models designed for microbial growth in food products.

TI  == the role of bacterial and non-bacterial toxins in the induction of changes in membrane transport: implications for diarrhea.
AB  == bacterial toxins induce changes in membrane transport which underlie the loss of  electrolyte homeostasis associated with diarrhea. bacterial- and their secreted toxin-types which have been linked with diarrhea include: (a) vibrio cholerae (cholera toxin, e1 tor hemolysin and accessory cholera enterotoxin); (b) escherichia coli (heat stable enterotoxin, heat-labile enterotoxin and colicins); (c) shigella dysenteriae (shiga-toxin); (d) clostridium perfringens (c. perfringens enterotoxin, alpha-toxin, beta-toxin and theta-toxin); (e) clostridium difficile (toxins a and b); (f) staphylococcus aureus (alpha-haemolysin); (g) bacillus cereus (cytotoxin k and haemolysin bl); and (h)  aeromonas hydrophila (aerolysin, heat labile cytotoxins and heat stable cytotoxins). the mechanisms of toxin-induced diarrhea include: (a) direct effects on ion transport in intestinal epithelial cells, i.e. direct toxin interaction with intrinsic ion channels in the membrane and (b) indirect interaction with ion transport in intestinal epithelial cells mediated by toxin binding to a membrane  receptor. these effects consequently cause the release of second messengers, e.g. the release of adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate/guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate, ip(3), ca2+ and/or changes in second messengers that are the result of toxin-formed ca2+ and k+ permeable channels, which increase ca2+ flux and augment changes in ca2+ homeostasis and cause depolarisation of the membrane  potential. consequently, many voltage-dependent ion transport systems, e.g. voltage-dependent ca2+ influx, are affected. the toxin-formed ion channels may act as a pathway for loss of fluid and electrolytes. although most of the diarrhea-causing toxins have been reported to act via cation and anion channel formation, the properties of these channels have not been well studied, and the available biophysical properties that are needed for the characterization of these channels are inadequate.

TI  == phytoestrogen genistein as an anti-staphylococcal agent.
AB  == the soybean-derived isoflavone genistein has been shown to exert beneficial effects on many disorders, including cancer and cardiovascular diseases. the effects of genistein on mammalian cells are mediated by its abilities to inhibit  topoisomerase ii and protein tyrosine kinase. in order to examine the potential antibacterial activities of genistein, we incubated the bacteria with various concentrations of this compound for different periods of time and assessed the viable counts. exposure to genistein exhibited an inhibitory effect on all staphylococcal strains tested, including methicillin-resistant strains. furthermore, the growth of streptococcus pasteurianus, bacillus cereus, and helicobacter pylori was clearly inhibited by genistein, whereas escherichia coli  growth was not suppressed. daidzein, which is structurally similar to genistein,  but deficient in topoisomerase ii inhibitory activity, also inhibited the growth  of staphylococcus aureus, albeit with lower potency than genistein. our results indicate that genistein exerts potent antibacterial properties in vitro, which are possibly mediated by the stabilization of the covalent topoisomerase ii-dna cleavage complex.

TI  == x-ray crystallographic and site-directed mutagenesis analysis of the mechanism of schiff-base formation in phosphonoacetaldehyde hydrolase catalysis.
AB  == phosphonoacetaldehyde hydrolase (phosphonatase) catalyzes the hydrolytic p-c bond cleavage of phosphonoacetaldehyde (pald) to form orthophosphate and acetaldehyde. the reaction proceeds via a schiff-base intermediate formed between lys-53 and the pald carbonyl. the x-ray crystal structures of the wild-type phosphonatase complexed with mg(ii) alone or with mg(ii) plus vinylsulfonate (a phosphonoethylenamine analog) were determined to 2.8 and 2.4 a, respectively. these structures were used to determine the identity and positions of active site residues surrounding the lys-53 ammonium group and the pald carbonyl. these include cys-22, his-56, tyr-128, and met-49. site-directed mutagenesis was then employed to determine whether or not these groups participate in catalysis. based on rate contributions, tyr-128 and cys-22 were eliminated as potential catalytic  groups. the lys-53 epsilon-amino group, positioned for reaction with the pald carbonyl, forms a hydrogen bond with water 120. water 120 is also within hydrogen bond distance of an imidazole nitrogen of his-56 and the sulfur atom of met-49. kinetic constants for mutants indicated that his-56 (1000-fold reduction in k(cat)/k(m) upon ala substitution) and met-49 (17,000-fold reduction in k(cat)/k(m) upon leu substitution) function in catalysis of schiff-base formation. based on these results, it is proposed that a network of hydrogen bonds among lys-53, water 120, his-56, and met-49 facilitate proton transfer from lys-53 to the carbinolamine intermediate. comparison of the vinylsulfonate complex versus unliganded structures indicated that association of the cap and core domains is essential for the positioning of the lys-53 for attack at the pald carbonyl and that substrate binding at the core domain stabilizes cap domain binding.

AB  == kwamegi (semidried raw pacific saury) is traditional seafood available in korea.  it has water activity in the range of 0.90 to 0.95. spoilage and the growth of most pathogenic bacteria is retarded because of low water activity, low temperature, and packaging. however, it is contaminated with bacteria of public health significance and poses a hazard to the consumer because it is consumed raw without any cooking. the effectiveness of these hurdles in preventing the growth  of staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, salmonella typhimurium, and escherichia coli and the efficacy of irradiation treatment in eliminating these bacteria from kwamegi using inoculated pack studies was examined. radiation sensitivity of s. aureus, b. cereus, salmonella typhimurium, and e. coli in kwamegi was investigated. d10-values of these organisms in kwamegi were 590 +/- 13.6, 640 +/- 14.9, 560 +/- 45.4, and 550 +/- 8.6 gy, respectively. the growth of all four test organisms inoculated into these foods during 4 weeks of storage at  an ambient winter temperature (ranging from -5 degrees c to +5 degrees c) was recorded. all four pathogens (inoculated at 10(6) cfu/g) were eliminated by irradiation at 4 kgy. these studies unequivocally demonstrate that irradiation, with a combination of low water activity and low temperature, results in microbiologically safe kwamegi.

TI  == identification of foodborne bacteria by infrared spectroscopy using cellular fatty acid methyl esters.
AB  == identification of bacterial species by profiling fatty acid methyl esters (fames) has commonly been carried out by using a 20-min capillary gas chromatographic procedure followed by library matching of fame profiles using commercial midi databases and proprietary pattern recognition software. fast gc (5 min) fame procedures and mass spectrometric methodologies that require no lipid separation  have also been reported. in this study, bacterial identification based on the rapid (2 min) infrared measurement of fame mixtures was demonstrated. the microorganisms investigated included gram positive bacteria staphylococcus aureus, listeria monocytogenes, bacillus anthracis, and bacillus cereus, and gram negative bacteria from the family enterobacteriacae: yersinia enterocolitica, salmonella typhimurium, shigella sonnei, and escherichia coli (four strains of e. coli), and non-enterobacteriacae: vibrio cholerae, vibrio vulnificus, and vibrio  parahemolyticus. foodborne bacterial mixtures of fames were measured by using an  attenuated total reflection (atr)-fourier transform infrared (ftir) spectroscopic procedure and discriminated by multivariate analysis. results showed that the enterobacteriacae could be discriminated from the vibrios. the identification was at the level of species (for the bacillus and vibrio genera) or strains (for the  e. coli species). a series of bacterial fame test samples were prepared and analyzed for accuracy of identification, and all were correctly identified. our results suggest that this infrared strategy could be used to identify foodborne pathogens.

TI  == microbial and copper adsorption by smectitic clay--an experimental study.
AB  == the objective of this study was to quantify copper-, bacteria- and bacteriophage-binding capacities of natural clay with the aim of predicting the adsorption of heavy metals, human pathogenic bacteria and viruses by a clayey landfill liner. x-ray diffraction analysis of six natural clays showed that the dominant phase in all deposits consists of smectites together with illite, kaolin and, sometimes, palygorskite and sepiolite. the specific surface areas of different clay substrates were very high ranging from 293 to 351 m2 g(-1), and indicating a high proportion of phyllosilicates, consisting especially of smectites. the physico-chemical identification of separated smectites showed a high potential adsorbent character indicative of a large industrial use. the kb12 smectite substrate chosen arbitrarily among six separated substrates, appeared as an excellent copper adsorbent. copper was adsorbed to clay in a proportion ranging from 94.6 to 96.0% with an average of 95.1% and its adsorption occurred rapidly in less than 30 min. organic contents of the clay substrate, evaluated as 17% of dry mass, may contribute and enhance copper adsorption. different elution  protocols using distilled water, 2 and/or 5% nitric acid revealed that while nitric acid resulted in the removal of more than 59% of the metal at the lower concentration and its complete depletion with a further elution at the higher concentration, distilled water alone was unable to remove more than 1% of adsorbed copper. this finding suggested that copper ions form high-energy bonds with layer-silicate surfaces. interestingly, the use of a regenerated substrate as copper adsorbent subsequent to abundant washings of the used substrate consecutively, with 0.1 n hno3 and distilled water, reduced copper adsorption by  approximately 14%, suggesting a slight disturbance of clay initial structure. batch adsorption experiments with phage t7 and raw clay kb12 showed that the tested clay substrate appeared as a relatively moderate phage adsorbent since the quantity of adsorbed phage averaged 98.2 +/- 0.88% (2 log10 retention) as measured by infectivity for escherichia coli atcc 11303. as shown by two types of separating procedures, natural sedimentation and a low speed centrifugation, bacteriophage particles were bound essentially to fine and not to relatively coarse particles of the clay suspension. the retention capacity of purified clay  kb12 appeared low, with average values lower than 60 and 50%, for pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 15442 and bacillus cereus atcc 1135, respectively. a significant  increase of retention, in the order of 30%, was found for both bacteria when the  mixture clay-bacteria was incubated at laboratory temperature for 6 hours.

AB  == the shopping basket approach to food sampling, in which ready-to-eat food items from a shopping list were sampled at premises chosen at random, was adopted by 15 environmental health departments in the wessex region. a total of 2037 samples were analysed over a 30-month period. the microbiological quality varied considerably between food categories, with gravy and stock samples giving the highest proportion of satisfactory results. sliced meats, cooked rice and sandwiches gave the poorest overall results. whilst the majority of unsatisfactory results were due to elevated levels of indicator organisms (aerobic colony count, enterobacteriaceae and escherichia coli), unsatisfactory or potentially hazardous levels of pathogens (staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens or listeria monocytogenes) were detected in 1% of samples. salmonella was not detected in any sample. the shopping basket survey was considered to be a useful way of structuring local sampling, and the random selection of premises was found to be a considerable advantage over previous sampling plans. in addition, the survey drew attention to a number of microbiological problems with specific food types, leading to more detailed investigations.

TI  == aerobic tryptophan degradation pathway in bacteria: novel kynurenine formamidase.
AB  == while a variety of chemical transformations related to the aerobic degradation of l-tryptophan (kynurenine pathway), and most of the genes and corresponding enzymes involved therein have been predominantly characterized in eukaryotes, relatively little was known about this pathway in bacteria. using genome comparative analysis techniques we have predicted the existence of the three-step pathway of aerobic l-tryptophan degradation to anthranilate (anthranilate pathway) in several bacteria. based on the chromosomal gene clustering analysis,  we have identified a previously unknown gene encoding for kynurenine formamidase  (ec 3.5.1.19) involved with the second step of the anthranilate pathway. this functional prediction was experimentally verified by cloning, expression and enzymatic characterization of recombinant kynurenine formamidase orthologs from bacillus cereus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and ralstonia metallidurans. experimental verification of the inferred anthranilate pathway was achieved by functional expression in escherichia coli of the r. metallidurans putative kynbau operon encoding three required enzymes: tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (gene kyna), kynurenine formamidase (gene kynb), and kynureninase (gene kynu). our data provide the first experimental evidence of the connection between these genes (only one of which, kynu, was previously characterized) and l-tryptophan aerobic  degradation pathway in bacteria.

TI  == consumer food-handling behaviors associated with prevention of 13 foodborne illnesses.
AB  == to be effective in reducing the incidence of foodborne illness, consumers and food safety educators need information about behaviors that will decrease exposure to foodborne pathogens. a four-round delphi technique was used to survey nationally recognized experts in food microbiology, epidemiology, food safety education, and food safety policy with the aim of identifying and ranking food-handling and consumption behaviors associated with 13 major foodborne pathogens. the food safety experts ranked behaviors related to keeping foods at safe temperatures as of primary importance in preventing illness caused by bacillus cereus and clostridium perfringens and of secondary importance in preventing illness caused by staphylococcus aureus. the use of a thermometer to cook foods adequately was ranked as of primary importance for the prevention of illness caused by campylobacter jejuni, salmonella species, escherichia coli o157:h7, toxoplasma gondii, and yersinia enterocolitica, with the avoidance of cross-contamination being ranked as of secondary importance for most of these pathogens. hand washing was the top-ranked behavior for the prevention of shigellosis. the avoidance of certain foods that are likely to be contaminated was the top-ranked behavior for the prevention of illnesses caused by listeria monocytogenes, noroviruses, and vibrio species. the expert panel's ranking of behaviors for the reduction of the risk of illness caused by major foodborne pathogens can enable consumers to make informed choices about food consumption and handling behaviors and can guide food safety educators in prioritizing their  educational efforts.

TI  == bactericidal effects of konjac fluid on several food-poisoning bacteria.
AB  == in this study, the bactericidal effects of japanese alkaline foods on food-poisoning bacteria were evaluated. konjac is an alkaline food soaked in calcinated calcium (the ph of konjac fluid ranges from 11.42 to 12.53). konjac fluids completely inactivated escherichia coli, enterohemorrhagic e. coli o157:h7 and e. coil o26:h9, salmonella enteritidis, vibrio parahemolyticus. and staphylococcus aureus. the initial level of 6 log cfu/ml dramatically decreased after incubation with konjac fluid, and no viable gram-negative bacterium cells could be detected within 1 to 2 days and no viable s. aureus cells could be detected within 3 to 5 days. on the other hand, treatment with konjac fluid was also effective in reducing levels of spore-forming bacteria (bacillus subtilis, bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens, and clostridium botulinum type e and type a). at least a 4-log reduction of spore-forming bacteria was obtained in konjac fluid within 7 to 14 days. vegetative cells were more susceptible to konjac fluid than spores were. when the initial cell count was 6 log cfu/ml, a few surviving spores remained for 60 to 90 days, but no spores could be detected  after 120 days. when the initial count of spore-forming bacteria was 3 to 4 log cfu/ml, the cells considered vegetative were completely inactivated within i to 3 days. repeated treatment with konjac fluid caused complete inactivation of spores in less than 1 to 3 days. our studies indicate that konjac fluid, which has a long history of use in food, will control food-poisoning bacterial contamination  during the production or preservation of konjac and other foods and has a preventive effect on bacteria that can cause severe disease at uniquely low levels.

TI  == antibacterial and proteolytic activity in venom from the endoparasitic wasp pimpla hypochondriaca (hymenoptera: ichneumonidae).
AB  == venom from the endoparasitic wasp, pimpla hypochondriaca, is composed of a mixture of high and low molecular weight proteins, possesses phenoloxidase activity, has immunosuppressive properties, and induces paralysis in several insect species. in the present study we demonstrate that p. hypochondriaca venom  also contains antibacterial and proteolytic activity. antibacterial activity was  detected against the gram-negative bacteria escherichia coli and xanthamonas campestris but not against pseudomonas syringae nor against two gram-positive bacteria, bacillus cereus and bacillus subtilis. endopeptidase and aminopeptidase activity in venom was detected using the synthetic fluorogenic substrates n-t-boc-phe-ser-arg-amc, arg-amc and leu-arg. the aminopeptidase activity towards arg-amc was sensitive to amastatin (70% inhibition), an aminopeptidase inhibitor. angiotensin-converting enzyme (ace)-like enzyme activity was detected, by reverse-phase hplc using the synthetic tripeptide hip-his-leu as a substrate. this activity was sensitive to captopril, an ace inhibitor (ic(50) 3.8 x 10(-8) m). using an antiserum raised against recombinant drosophila melanogaster ace-like enzyme, (rance), western blot analysis revealed an immunoreactive protein, with a molecular weight estimate of 74 kda, in p. hypochondriaca venom.  the possibility that the endopeptidase, aminopeptidase and ace are involved in the processing of peptide precursors in the venom sac is discussed.

TI  == interaction of a free-living soil nematode, caenorhabditis elegans, with surrogates of foodborne pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == free-living nematodes may harbor, protect, and disperse bacteria, including those ingested and passed in viable form in feces. these nematodes are potential vectors for human pathogens and may play a role in foodborne diseases associated  with fruits and vegetables eaten raw. in this study, we evaluated the associations between a free-living soil nematode, caenorhabditis elegans, and escherichia coli, an avirulent strain of salmonella typhimurium, listeria welshimeri, and bacillus cereus. on an agar medium, young adult worms quickly moved toward colonies of all four bacteria; over 90% of 3-day-old adult worms entered colonies within 16 min after inoculation. after 48 h, worms moved in and  out of colonies of l. welshimeri and b. cereus but remained associated with e. coli and salmonella typhimurium colonies for at least 96 h. young adult worms fed on cells of the four bacteria suspended in k medium. worms survived and reproduced with the use of nutrients derived from all test bacteria, as determined for eggs laid by second-generation worms after culturing for 96 h. development was slightly slower for worms fed gram-positive bacteria than for worms fed gram-negative bacteria. worms that fed for 24 h on bacterial lawns formed on tryptic soy agar dispersed bacteria over a 3-h period when they were transferred to a bacteria-free agar surface. the results of this study suggest that c. elegans and perhaps other free-living nematodes are potential vectors for both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including foodborne pathogens in soil.

TI  == application of sonication to release dna from bacillus cereus for quantitative detection by real-time pcr.
AB  == a rapid sonication method for lysis of gram-positive bacteria was evaluated for use in combination with quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) analyses for detection. other criteria used for evaluation of lysis were microscopic cell count, colony forming units (cfu), optical density at 600 nm and total yield of dna measured by picogreen fluorescence. the aim of this study was  complete disruption of cellular structures and release of dna without the need for lysing reagents and time-consuming sample preparation. the gram-positive bacterium bacillus cereus was used as a model organism for gram-positive bacteria. it was demonstrated by real-time pcr that maximum yield of dna was obtained after 3 to 5 min of sonication. the yield of dna was affected by culture age and the cells from a 4-h-old culture in the exponential phase of growth gave  a higher yield of dna after 5 min of sonication than a 24-h-old culture in the stationary phase of growth. the 4-h-old culture was also more sensitive for lysis caused by heating. the maximum yield of dna, evaluated by real-time pcr, from a culture of the gram-negative bacterium escherichia coli, was obtained after 20 s  of sonication. however, the yield of target dna from e. coli rapidly decreased after 50 s of sonication due to degradation of dna. plate counting (cfu), microscopic counting and absorbance at 600 nm showed that the number of viable and structurally intact b. cereus cells decreased rapidly with sonication time, whereas the yield of dna increased as shown by picogreen fluorescence and real-time pcr. the present results indicate that 3-5 min of sonication is sufficient for lysis and release of dna from samples of gram-positive bacteria.

TI  == antiplasmid effect of promethazine in mixed bacterial cultures.
AB  == promethazine has been recognised as an effective antiplasmid agent in cultures containing a single bacterial species such as escherichia coli, yersinia enterocolitica, staphylococcus aureus and agrobacterium tumefaciens. the objective of this study was to examine the effect of heterogenity of the microbial flora on plasmid elimination by promethazine in a laboratory based model system of mixed bacterial infection. f'lac plasmid elimination of e. coli k12 le140 was studied in the presence of a numerically predominant gram-positive  species (bacillus cereus, staphylococcus epidermidis) by promethazine (0-120 mg/l) at 23, 37 and 39 degrees c. growth kinetics of different bacterial species  were studied at various temperatures without drug treatment in mixed bacterial cultures and it was found that the small number of added bacteria overgrew the pre-existing flora during the incubation period. we observed that bacterial-bacterial interactions modified the growth rate of individual bacterial species and gave selective advantages to some bacterial species of the microbial  community. some interactions between coexisting bacterial species enhanced the frequency of plasmid curing by promethazine in mixed cultures with s. epidermidis. in our experiments the plasmid curing action of promethazine was more effective at elevated temperature than at lower temperatures.

TI  == screening of bifidobacterium strains isolated from human faeces for antagonistic  activities against potentially bacterial pathogens.
AB  == as probiotic bacteria, strains belonging to the genus bifidobacterium colonise the gastro-intestinal tract of humans and animals at the time of birth, and they  are found in young as well as in adult individuals in great numbers. moreover, they can interact with the development of enteric infections by the production of antimicrobial metabolites. in this work 281 strains of bifidobacteria were anaerobically isolated from human faecal samples, supplied by volunteers of different ages (youngs, adults, elders), and preliminarly described by microscopic observation. all strains were screened by the fructose 6-phosphate phosphoketolase (f6ppk) test in order to confirm their classification within the  genus bifidobacterium. selected strains were used to evaluate their antagonistic  activities against escherichia coli, salmonella thyphimurium, staphylococcus lentus, enterococcus faecalis, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, sphingomonas paucimobilis, listeria monocytogenes, yersinia enterocolitica, bacillus cereus, clostridium sporogenes. experiments were performed in vitro by different methods  based on the observation of growth inhibition in petri dishes. the strains that showed the highest inhibiting activities were compared by sds-page for total cell proteins, using type strains of human origin as references. representative isolates were metabolically characterised by the biolog system; a specific database was created with strains obtained from our collection and a statistical  evaluation for metabolic patterns was carried out.

TI  == rebeccamycin analogues bearing amine substituents or other groups on the sugar moiety.
AB  == in the course of structure-activity relationship studies on rebeccamycin analogues, a series of compounds bearing an amino function on the sugar moiety were synthesized with the aim of improving the solubility and interaction with the macromolecular target(s). the syntheses of amino derivatives and the corresponding chloro, iodo and azido intermediates are described. their interaction with dna and effects on human dna topoisomerases i and ii were investigated. their antimicrobial activities against two gram-positive bacteria,  bacillus cereus and streptomyces chartreusis, a gram-negative bacterium escherichia coli and a yeast candida albicans were also determined. 6'-amino compound 7 and 6'-n-methylamino 14 very efficiently inhibit the growth of e. coli. the introduction of an amino group at the 6'-position strongly enhances the capacity of the drugs to interact with dna but almost abolishes their poisoning effect on topoisomerase i. unlike the vast majority of rebeccamycin analogues previously studied, the newly designed compounds do not stimulate dna cleavage by topoisomerase i. the enhanced capacity of the 6'-amino glycosyl rebeccamycin derivatives to bind to dna likely account for the improved biological profiles. dna and topoisomerase i represent two independent targets which can both be used  for the development of antitumor rebeccamycin derivatives.

AB  == a 36 kda chitinase was purified by ion exchange and gel filtration chromatography from the culture supernatant of bacillus thuringiensis hd-1. the chitinase production was independent of the presence of chitin in the growth medium and was produced even in the presence of glucose. the purified chitinase was active at acidic ph, had an optimal activity at ph 6.5, and showed maximum activity at 65 degrees c. of the various substrates, the enzyme catalyzed the hydrolysis of the  disaccharide 4-mu(glnac)(2) most efficiently and was therefore classified as an exochitinase. the sequence of the tryptic peptides showed extensive homology with bacillus cereus 36 kda exochitinase. the 1083 bp open reading frame encoding 36 kda chitinase was amplified with primers based on the gene sequence of b. cereus  36 kda exochitinase. the deduced amino-acid sequence showed that the protein contained an n-terminal signal peptide and consisted of a single catalytic domain. the two conserved signature sequences characteristic of family 18 chitinases were mapped at positions 105-109 and 138-145 of chi36. the recombinant chitinase was expressed in a catalytically active form in escherichia coli in the vector pqe-32. the expressed 36 kda chitinase potentiated the insecticidal effect of the vegetative insecticidal protein (vip) when used against neonate larvae of  spodoptera litura.

TI  == diverse effects of ascorbic acid and palmitoyl ascorbate on helicobacter pylori survival and growth.
AB  == among many antioxidants used in the food, pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries, ascorbic acid (aa) is one of the most important. aa has been suggested to decrease the risk of gastric disease (gastritis, duodenal ulcer, and carcinoma) by direct action on helicobacter pylori. however, there are limited studies on the possible role of aa and its derivatives such as palmitoyl ascorbate (pa) on the growth and survival of h. pylori. in the present study it was demonstrated in vitro that aa in the concentration range 10-20 mg x ml(-1) (50-100 mm) inhibited  h. pylori growth in liquid medium under microaerophilic conditions. in contrast,  under aerobic conditions aa in the concentration range 2-20 mg x ml(-1) (10-100 mm) significantly increased the survival of h. pylori presumably eliminating the  toxic effect of reactive oxygen species on bacterial cells. the hydrophobic derivative of aa, pa (a food antioxidant), demonstrated a strong antibacterial effect, under both aerobic and microaerophilic conditions in the concentration range 0.04-0.4 mg x ml(-1) (0.1-1.0 mm). this effect was also tested on other bacterial strains: escherichia coli, proteus vulgaris, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, clostridium sporogenes and campylobacter jejuni. among these bacterial strains, pa showed a similar inhibitory effect on b. cereus and b. subtilis as observed with h. pylori. the results suggest that pa may be considered an important aa derivative  in eradication of h. pylori in vitro and in vivo and to decrease the risk for gastric diseases.

TI  == cloning, sequencing, and expression of the chitinase gene chia74 from bacillus thuringiensis.
AB  == the endochitinase gene chia74 from bacillus thuringiensis serovar kenyae strain lbit-82 was cloned in escherichia coli dh5 alpha f'. a sequence of 676 amino acids was deduced when the gene was completely sequenced. a molecular mass of 74  kda was estimated for the preprotein, which includes a putative 4-kda signal sequence located at the n terminus. the deduced amino acid sequence showed high degree of identity with other chitinases such as chib from bacillus cereus (98%)  and chia71 from bacillus thuringiensis serovar pakistani (70%). additionally, chia74 showed a modular structure comprised of three domains: a catalytic domain, a fibronectin-like domain, and a chitin-binding domain. all three domains showed  conserved sequences when compared to other bacterial chitinase sequences. a ca. 70-kda mature protein expressed by the cloned gene was detected in zymograms, comigrating with a chitinase produced by the lbit-82 wild-type strain. chia74 is  active within a wide ph range (4 to 9), although a bimodal activity was shown at  ph 4.79 and 6.34. the optimal temperature was estimated at 57.2 degrees c when tested at ph 6. the potential use of chia74 as a synergistic agent, along with the b. thuringiensis insecticidal cry proteins, is discussed.

TI  == inactivation of bacteria and spores by pulse electric field and high pressure co2 at low temperature.
AB  == the common methods for inactivation of bacteria involve heating or exposure to toxic chemicals. these methods are not suitable for heat-sensitive materials, food, and pharmaceutical products. recently, a complete inactivation of many microorganisms was achieved with high-pressure carbon dioxide at ambient temperature and in the absence of organic solvent and irradiation. the inactivation of spores with co(2) required long residence time and high temperatures, such as 60 degrees c. in this study the synergistic effect of pulsed electric field (pef) in combination with high-pressure co(2) for inactivation was investigated. the bacteria escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, and bacillus cereus were suspended in glycerol solution and treated in the first step with pef (up to 25 kv/cm) and then with high-pressure co(2) not higher than 40 degrees c and 200 bar. the inactivation efficiency was determined  by counting the colony formation units of control and sample. samples of the cells subjected to pef treatment alone and in combination with co(2) treatment were examined by scanning electron microscopy to determine the effect of the processes on the cell wall. experimental results indicate that the viability decreased with increasing electrical field strength and number of pulses. a further batch treatment with supercritical co(2) lead to complete inactivation of bacterial species and decreased the count of the spores by at least three orders  of magnitude, the inactivation being enhanced by an increase of contact time between co(2) and the sample. a synergistic effect between the pulsed electric field and the high-pressure co(2) was evident in all the species treated. the new low temperature process is an alternative for pasteurization of thermally labile  compounds such as protein and plasma and minimizes denaturation of important nutrient compounds in the liquid media.

TI  == [observations of characteristics of the mechanisms of biological oxidation of cell wall-deficient bacteria].
AB  == the l-forms were induced from staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli and bacillus cereus by beta-lactam antibiotics and then observations on the properties of oxygen requirement, sugar fermentation and sensitive to cyanide of  the l-forms were done. the results were shown that the l-forms derived from the obligate aerobe or the facultative anaerobe did not ferment sugars and were highly oxygen-dependent and more sensitive to cyanide than their parent bacteria. the metabolic activities which were same as the parent bacteria of the l-forms would return after the l-forms reverted to the typical bacteria forms. it was possible that the changes of biological oxidation mechanism were due to the deficiency of the cell wall which led to loss of the periplasmic space or the membrane-wall interlayer so that the enzymes for fermentation existed in the space could not be hold.

AB  == bacillus ctc strain was identified as bacillus thuringiensis subsp. finitimus (serotype h2) and pasteur institute confirmed this identification. the parasporal body formed by ctc strain is oval shaped, and consists of 100 kd protein. the determination of the n-terminal amino acid sequence showed this protein shares 93% similarity to that of b. anthracis s-layer proteins. the restriction map covering the related protein gene (ctc) was deduced according to southern hybridization. the dna fragments containing the 5' and 3' end of ctc gene with 0.6 kb overlap were isolated, respectively. full length ctc gene was then constructed. b. thuringiensis is a species similar to b. cereus and b. anthracis, and only can be distinguished by forming parasporal bodies. the growth of e. coli maintaining ctc gene is similar to that of e. coli expressing s-layer protein gene. the above preliminary results showed that the parasporal body protein in ctc strain is a cell surface-like protein. so identifying ctc strain as a species of b. thuringiensis and the unique criterion for the identification of b. thuringiensis by forming parasporal body should be reconsidered.

TI  == beta-lactamase genes of the penicillin-susceptible bacillus anthracis sterne strain.
AB  == susceptibility to penicillin and other beta-lactam-containing compounds is a common trait of bacillus anthracis. beta-lactam agents, particularly penicillin,  have been used worldwide to treat anthrax in humans. nonetheless, surveys of clinical and soil-derived strains reveal penicillin g resistance in 2 to 16% of isolates tested. bacterial resistance to beta-lactam agents is often mediated by  production of one or more types of beta-lactamases that hydrolyze the beta-lactam ring, inactivating the antimicrobial agent. here, we report the presence of two beta-lactamase (bla) genes in the penicillin-susceptible sterne strain of b. anthracis. we identified bla1 by functional cloning with escherichia coli. bla1 is a 927-nucleotide (nt) gene predicted to encode a protein with 93.8% identity to the type i beta-lactamase gene of bacillus cereus. a second gene, bla2, was identified by searching the unfinished b. anthracis chromosome sequence database  of the institute for genome research for open reading frames (orfs) predicted to  encode beta-lactamases. we found a partial orf predicted to encode a protein with significant similarity to the carboxy-terminal end of the type ii beta-lactamase  of b. cereus. dna adjacent to the 5' end of the partial orf was cloned using inverse pcr. bla2 is a 768-nt gene predicted to encode a protein with 92% identity to the b. cereus type ii enzyme. the bla1 and bla2 genes confer ampicillin resistance to e. coli and bacillus subtilis when cloned individually in these species. the mics of various antimicrobial agents for the e. coli clones indicate that the two beta-lactamase genes confer different susceptibility profiles to e. coli; bla1 is a penicillinase, while bla2 appears to be a cephalosporinase. the beta-galactosidase activities of b. cereus group species harboring bla promoter-lacz transcriptional fusions indicate that bla1 is poorly  transcribed in b. anthracis, b. cereus, and b. thuringiensis. the bla2 gene is strongly expressed in b. cereus and b. thuringiensis and weakly expressed in b. anthracis. taken together, these data indicate that the bla1 and bla2 genes of the b. anthracis sterne strain encode functional beta-lactamases of different types, but gene expression is usually not sufficient to confer resistance to beta-lactam agents.

TI  == eggshell matrix proteins as defense mechanism of avian eggs.
AB  == this study focused on the role of eggshell matrix proteins as a function of potential natural antimicrobial defenses of avian eggs. the electrophoretic profile of sds-page showed that the soluble eggshell matrix proteins had three major bands of 15 000, 36 000, and 66 000 and several minor bands comprising 17 000, 25 000, 30 000, and 75 000, while insoluble matrix proteins were consisting  of various bands comprising at least 16 distinct migration bands between 10 000 and 200 000. three bacteria species, pseudomonas aureginosa, bacillus cereus, and staphylococcus aureus, were found to be inhibited in the presence of soluble eggshell matrix proteins (100 microg/ml). on the other hand, escherichia coli and salmonella enteritidis were weakly inhibited at only an early stage of incubation time (up to 4 h). scanning electron microscopy revealed that eggshell matrix proteins might interact and disrupt the membrane integrity of bacteria. the present study clearly indicated that avian eggshell matrix proteins possess a potential of novel antimicrobial defensin mechanism.

TI  == application of a real-time biosensor to detect bacteria in platelet concentrates.
AB  == a spore-based biosensor for detecting low levels of bacteria in real-time has been recently developed. the system (termed lexsas, label-free exponential signal-amplification system) exploits spore's ability to produce fluorescence when sensing neighboring bacterial cells. we studied the lexsas as a possible approach for identifying bacterially contaminated platelet concentrates prior to  transfusion because the system offers rapid analysis, high sensitivity, and low cost. if successful, this approach could reduce the risk of morbidity and mortality from transfusion-related bacteremia and sepsis. in this study, we used  the lexsas for detecting bacteria in platelet concentrates spiked with bacillus cereus, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, or streptococcus pyogenes. bacteria were separated from platelets using a 2-min procedure based on bacterial resistance to detergents and osmotic shock. the results indicate that the lexsas could be used to design a practical biosensor for identifying bacterially contaminated platelets in real-time.

AB  == a polymerase chain reaction (pcr) fragment from strain nvh 38 (containing bcet) was cloned, sequenced and expressed in escherichia coli. this sequence showed 50-60% identity to the original. when this bcet clone was expressed in e. coli no biological activity was found in either supernatants or cell extracts. cell extracts from the bacillus cereus strains (nvh 38 and b-4ac) were also negative on vero cells. neutralisation of supernatant from b. cereus b-4ac using a monoclonal antibody (reacting with nheb and hbld) abolished the activity. a test  for cytotoxic enterotoxins was negative for both cell extracts and supernatants.  our data suggest that bcet either has an unknown type enterotoxic action or non at all.

TI  == colony shape as a genetic trait in the pattern-forming bacillus mycoides.
AB  == background: bacillus mycoides flugge, a gram-positive, non-motile soil bacterium  assigned to bacillus cereus group, grows on agar as chains of cells linked end to end, forming radial filaments curving clock- or counter-clockwise (sin or dx morphotypes). the molecular mechanism causing asymmetric curving is not known: our working hypothesis considers regulation of filamentous growth as the prerequisite for these morphotypes. results: sin and dx strains isolated from the environment were classified as b. mycoides by biochemical and molecular biology tests. growth on agar of different hardness and nutrient concentration did not abolish colony patterns, nor was conversion between sin and dx morphotypes ever noticed. a number of morphotype mutants, all originating from one sin strain, were obtained. some lost turn direction becoming fluffy, others became round and  compact. all mutants lost wild type tight aggregation in liquid culture. growth on agar was followed by microscopy, exploring the process of colony formation and details of cell divisions. a region of the dcw (division cell wall) cluster, including ftsq, ftsa, ftsz and murc, was sequenced in dx and sin strains as a basis for studying cell division. this confirmed the relatedness of dx and sin strains to the b. cereus group. conclusions: dx and sin asymmetric morphotypes stem from a close but not identical genomic context. asymmetry is established early during growth on agar. wild type bacilli construct mostly uninterrupted filaments with cells dividing at the free ends: they "walk" longer distances compared to mutants, where enhanced frequency of cell separation produces new growing edges resulting in round compact colonies.

TI  == adhesion of bacillus spores and escherichia coli cells to inert surfaces: role of surface hydrophobicity.
AB  == the ability of bacterial spores and vegetative cells to adhere to inert surfaces  was investigated by means of the number of adherent spores (bacillus cereus and bacillus subtilis spores) and escherichia coli cells and their resistance to cleaning or rinsing procedures (adhesion strength). six materials (glass, stainless steel, polyethylene high density (pehd), polyamide-6, polyvinyl chloride, and teflon) were tested. slight differences in the number of adherent spores (less than 1 log unit) were observed between materials, but a higher number of adherent e. coli cells was found on the hydrophobic materials pehd and  teflon. conversely, the resistance of both b. cereus and b. subtilis spores to a  cleaning procedure was significantly affected by the material. hydrophobic materials were harder to clean. the topography parameter derived from the abbott-firestone curve, rvk, and, to a lesser extent, the widely used roughness parameters ra (average roughness) and rz (maximal roughness), were related to the number of adherent cells. lastly, the soiling level as well as the adhesion strength were shown to depend largely on the microorganism. the number of adhering b. cereus hydrophobic spores and their resistance to a cleaning procedure were found to be 10 times greater than those of the b. subtilis hydrophilic spores. escherichia coli was loosely bound to all the materials tested, even after 24 h biofilm formation.

TI  == development of a laser-induced cell lysis system.
AB  == a novel cell lysis system was developed that is based on laser-induced disruption of bacterial and yeast cells. it will find application as a rapid, efficient and  clean sample preparation step in bioanalytical detection systems. using e. coli as our model analyte, we optimized cell lysis with respect to optimal laser wavelength, lowest energy input requirements, rna release from the cells, and potential protein damage. the optimized system was finally applied to the lysis of four additional microorganisms. all experiments were carried out with about 2000 cells per sample or less. initially, lysis was determined by the detection of cell survival after laser treatment using standard microbiological techniques, (i.e., cells were grown on nutrient agar plates). then, actual release of mrna from the cells was proven. wavelengths investigated ranged from 500 nm to 1550 nm. an average power of 100 mw for the lasers was shown to be sufficient to obtain cell lysis at wavelengths above 1000 nm, with optimal wavelengths between  1250 nm and 1550 nm. since water absorbs energy at those wavelengths, it is assumed that laser exposure results in an instantaneous increase of the cell temperature, which causes rupture of the cell membrane. second, damage to protein solutions treated under optimized laser-lysis conditions was also studied. using  a pure solution of horseradish peroxidase as a model protein, no loss in enzyme activity was observed. thus, it was concluded that damage to intracellular proteins is unlikely. third, rna release was tested using an e. coli specific rna biosensor. release of rna was not detected from untreated cells, but laser-treated e. coli cells displayed significant rna release due to laser-induced cell lysis. finally, lysis of m. luteus, b. subtilis, b. cereus, and s. cerevisiae were investigated under optimized conditions. in all cases, laser-induced lysis of the cells was confirmed by determination of cell survival. hence, laser-induced cell lysis is an efficient procedure that can be used for sample preparation, without damage to macromolecules, in bioanalytical detection  systems for microorganisms. miniaturized lasers and miniaturized cell-lysis chambers will create a simple, field-usable cell lysis system and allow the application of laser-induced cell lysis in micro total analysis systems.

AB  == isolation and identification of (s(s)r(c))-s-n-butylcysteine sulfoxide (1) from the bulbs of allium siculum is reported. this compound was found in all parts of  the plant (bulbs, stem, leaves, and flowers) along with known compounds (s(s)r(c))-s-methyl- and (r(s)r(c))-(e)-s-(1-propenyl)cysteine sulfoxides (2 and  3, respectively). in addition, six n-butyl-containing thiosulfinates (4-9) have been found in a ch2cl2 extract of the bulbs. structures were determined by a combination of spectral methods (primarily nmr and ms) and by comparison with authentic compounds obtained by synthesis. antimicrobial activities of 4-7 and 9  are reported.

AB  == the prevalence of strains of staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative (cn) staphylococci, listeria monocytogenes, escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium and bacillus cereus, was investigated in 111 bulk milk samples. staphylococcus aureus was isolated from 38 samples, cn staphylococci from 63 samples, e. coli from 49 samples, e. faecalis or e. faecium from 107 samples, and l. monocytogenes from two samples. bacillus cereus was not found in any of the samples and three samples were free of any of the selected species. sensitivity to the anti-microbial drugs amikacin, ampicillin, ampicillin + sulbactam, cephalothin (clt), cephotaxime, clindamycin, chloramphenicol (cmp), co-trimoxazole, erythromycin (ery), gentamicin, neomycin, norfloxacin, oxacillin, penicillin, streptomycin (str), tetracycline (ttc) and vancomycin was tested using the standard dilution technique. minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) characteristics (mic50, mic90, mic range) were determined for each microbial species. resistance against one or more anti-microbial drugs was found in 93% of  s. aureus, 40% of cn staphylococci, 73% of e. coli, 88% of e.faecalis, 55% of e.faecium, and one l. monocytogenes strain. most of the strains, particularly enterococci, were resistant to str, ttc, and ery (mic50 4 microg/ml). a high percentage of staphylococci were resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics. high resistance to clt was found in 11 strains of e. coli (mic 256 microg/ml) and strains resistant to cmp (mic90 16 microg/ml) were detected. the highest numbers  of resistance phenotypes were found in e. coil (16) and cn staphylococci (12). eighteen identical resistance phenotypes were demonstrated in indicator bacteria  (e. coli, e. faecalis, e. faecium) and pathogens (s. aureus, cn staphylococci) isolated from the same bulk milk sample. the obtained resistance data were matched against the herd owners' information on therapeutic use of the drugs. this confrontation could not explain the findings of strains resistant to ery or  cmp. our findings are evidence of selection of resistant strains among not only pathogenic agents, but also among indicator bacteria which can become significant carriers of transmissible resistance genes.

TI  == purification, characterization and cloning of a chitinase from bacillus sp. nctu2.
AB  == a chitin-degrading bacillus strain, designated as nctu2, was screened from soil and identified. an extracellular chitinase was purified to >90% homogeneity from  the culture filtrate. the purification involved hydrophobic-interaction and gel-filtration chromatographic separations with a yield of 58%. the purified enzyme (chinctu2) is a monomeric protein with an estimated molecular mass of 36.5 kda and a pi of 6.3. it is thermally stable at 60 degrees c and ph 6-8 for more than 3 h. the optimal activity is in the range of 50-60 degrees c at ph 7.0. chitobiose is the predominant product throughout the enzymic hydrolysis of the colloidal chitin, indicating that the purified chitinase is an exo-chitinase. chito-oligosaccharides [with degree of polymerization (dp) values of 4-6] are good substrates of the purified enzyme, whereas a dp3 oligomer was slowly hydrolysed to form dp1 and dp2 sugars. the first 15 n-terminal amino acids of the enzyme were determined to be annlgskllvgywhn, which is highly homologous to that  of chia from bacillus cereus. a pcr cloning technique was employed to obtain the  corresponding gene from bacillus nctu2. the gene sequence was determined to be 1080 bp, encoding a polypeptide of 360 amino acids with the first 27 amino acids  as the signal peptide.

TI  == essential oil constituents and in vitro antimicrobial activity of decalepis hamiltonii roots against foodborne pathogens.

TI  == mutational analysis of the two zinc-binding sites of the bacillus cereus 569/h/9  metallo-beta-lactamase.
AB  == the metallo-beta-lactamase bcii from bacillus cereus 569/h/9 possesses a binuclear zinc centre. the mono-zinc form of the enzyme displays an appreciably high activity, although full efficiency is observed for the di-zinc enzyme. in an attempt to assign the involvement of the different zinc ligands in the catalytic  properties of bcii, individual substitutions of selected amino acids were generated. with the exception of his(116)-->ser (h116s), c221a and c221s, the mono- and di-zinc forms of all the other mutants were poorly active. the activity of h116s decreases by a factor of 10 when compared with the wild type. the catalytic efficiency of c221a and c221s was zinc-dependent. the mono-zinc forms of these mutants exhibited a low activity, whereas the catalytic efficiency of their respective di-zinc forms was comparable with that of the wild type. surprisingly, the zinc contents of the mutants and the wild-type bcii were similar. these data suggest that the affinity of the beta-lactamase for the metal was not affected by the substitution of the ligand. the ph-dependence of the h196s catalytic efficiency indicates that the zinc ions participate in the hydrolysis of the beta-lactam ring by acting as a lewis acid. the zinc ions activate the catalytic water molecule, but also polarize the carbonyl bond of the beta-lactam ring and stabilize the development of a negative charge on the carbonyl oxygen of the tetrahedral reaction intermediate. our studies also demonstrate that asn(233) is not directly involved in the interaction with the substrates.

AB  == the purpose of this study was to evaluate the microbiological and sensory quality as well as the safety of ready-to-eat (rte) cooked foods prepared in and distributed from a centralized kitchen to schools in argentina. a total of 101 cooked food samples delivered as hot rte cooked foods (group a) and as rte cooked foods at room temperature (group b) and 140 surface swab environment samples were collected from february to november 1999. petrifilm plates were used for aerobic  (pac), coliform (pcc), and escherichia coli (pec) counts. standard methods were used to determine enterobacteriaceae (entc) and thermotolerant coliform counts (tcc). samples were also tested for the presence of salmonella spp., staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, and clostridium perfringens. food temperatures just before samples were put into containers ranged from 80 to 98 degrees c and from 28 to 32 degrees c for group a and group b, respectively. for  group a food samples, pac ranged from 1.04 to 3.50 log cfu/g, and pcc, pec, tcc,  and entc were not detected. for group b food samples, pac ranged from 3.63 to 6.48 log cfu/g, pcc ranged from 1.90 to 5.36 log cfu/g, tcc ranged from 1.30 to 3.95 log cfu/g, and entc ranged from 3.60 to 5.46 log cfu/g. of the foodborne pathogens, only b. cereus was isolated (63.4% of samples) in both food groups (<4 log cfu/g). the microbiological and sensory quality and the safety of group a foods were satisfactory. large numbers of pac and entc detected in group b foods  show that better control is needed to avoid potential foodborne diseases.

TI  == antimicrobial synergistic effect of linolenic acid and monoglyceride against bacillus cereus and staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == the antimicrobial effect of linolenic acid with or without monoglyceride (glycerol laurate or glycerol myristate) against six food-borne microorganisms was determined in broth medium. minimum inhibitory concentration of linolenic acid on bacillus cereus and staphylococcus aureus was 20 and 50 ppm, respectively. the growth of b. cereus treated with linolenic acid at 10 ppm with  10 ppm monoglyceride was more inhibitory than that of linolenic acid alone, and the viable cell population was reduced 2-4 log cycles compared to that of the control. when linolenic acid was added at that level, the adenosine triphosphate  (atp) concentration of extracellular fluid was drastically increased compared with that of the control, and the combined effect with monoglyceride was higher than that with linolenic acid alone. however, the intracellular atp concentration decreased compared with that of the control. from these results, we concluded that linolenic acid has a strong antimicrobial activity against b. cereus and s.  aureus, and that linolenic acid combined with monoglyceride showed stronger antimicrobial activity than using linolenic acid alone.

TI  == the incompatibility between the plcr- and atxa-controlled regulons may have selected a nonsense mutation in bacillus anthracis.
AB  == bacillus anthracis, bacillus thuringiensis and bacillus cereus are members of the bacillus cereus group. these bacteria express virulence in diverse ways in mammals and insects. the pathogenic properties of b. cereus and b. thuringiensis  in mammals results largely from the secretion of non-specific toxins, including haemolysins, the production of which depends upon a pleiotropic activator plcr. in b. anthracis, plcr is inactive because of a nonsense mutation in the plcr gene. this suggests that the phenotypic differences between b. anthracis on the one hand and b. thuringiensis and b. cereus on the other could result at least partly from loss of the plcr regulon. we expressed a functional plcr in b. anthracis. this resulted in the transcriptional activation of genes weakly expressed in the absence of plcr. the transcriptional activation correlated with  the induction of enzymatic activities and toxins including haemolysins. the toxicity of a b. anthracis plcr+ strain was assayed in the mouse subcutaneous and nasal models of infection. it was no greater than that of the parental strain, suggesting that the plcr regulon has no influence on b. anthracis virulence. the  plcr regulon had dramatic effects on the sporulation of a b. anthracis strain containing the virulence plasmid pxo1. this resulted from incompatible interactions with the major atxa-controlled virulence regulon. we propose that the plcr-controlled regulon in b. anthracis has been counterselected on account of its disadvantageous effects.

TI  == enumeration of total bacteria and bacteria with genes for proteolytic activity in pure cultures and in environmental samples by quantitative pcr mediated amplification.
AB  == real-time quantitative pcr assays were developed for the absolute quantification  of different groups of bacteria in pure cultures and in environmental samples. 16s rrna genes were used as markers for eubacteria, and genes for extracellular peptidases were used as markers for potentially proteolytic bacteria. for the designed 16s rdna taqman assay, specificity of the designed primer-probe combination for eubacteria, a high amplification efficiency over a wide range of  starting copy numbers and a high reproducibility is demonstrated. cell concentrations of bacillus cereus, b. subtilis and pseudomonas fluorescens in liquid culture were monitored by taqman-pcr using the 16s rdna target sequence of escherichia coli as external standard for quantification. results agree with plate counts and microscopic counts of dapi stained cells. the significance of 16s rrna operon multiplicity to the quantification of bacteria is discussed.furthermore, three sets of primer pair together with probe previously designed for targeting different classes of bacterial extracellular peptidases were tested for their suitability for taqman-pcr based quantification of proteolytic bacteria. since high degeneracy of the probes did not allow accurate  quantification, sybrgreen was used instead of molecular probes to visualize and quantify pcr products during pcr. the correlation between fluorescence and starting copy number was of the same high quality as for the 16s rdna taqman assay for all the three peptidase gene classes. the detected amount of genes for  neutral metallopeptidase of b. cereus, for subtilisin of b. subtilis and for alkaline metallopeptidase of p. fluorescens corresponded exactly to the numbers of bacteria investigated by the 16s rdna targeting assay. the developed assays were applied for the quantification of bacteria in soil samples.

AB  == fish chromatophores from betta splendens are used as the cytosensor element in the development of a portable microscale device capable of detecting certain environmental toxins and bacterial pathogens by monitoring changes in pigment granule distribution. the adaptation of chromatophores to a microscale environment has required the development of enabling technologies to produce miniaturized culture chambers, to integrate microfluidics for sample delivery, to miniaturize image capture, and to design new statistical methods for image analyses. betta splendens chromatophores were selected as the cytosensor element  because of their moderate size, their toleration of close contact, and most importantly, for their responses to a broad range of chemicals and pathogenic bacteria. a miniaturized culture chamber has been designed that supports chromatophore viability for as long as 3 months, and that can be easily transported without damage to the cells. new statistical methods for image analyses have been developed that increase sensitivity and also decrease the time required for detection of significant changes in pigment granule distribution. betta chromatophores have been tested for their responses to selected pathogenic  bacteria and chemical agents. we discuss in detail the aggregation of pigment granules seen when chromatophores are incubated with bacillus cereus, a common cause of food poisoning. also described are the more subtle responses of chromatophores to a class of environmental chemical toxins, polynuclear aromatic  hydrocarbons. we show that the chromatophores are able to detect the presence of  certain polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons at concentrations lower than the environment protection agency (epa) 550.1 standards.

AB  == the diketone compound, benzil is reduced to (s)-benzoin with living bacillus cereus cells. recently, we isolated a gene responsible for benzil reduction, and  escherichia coli cells in which this gene was overexpressed transformed benzil to (s)-benzoin. although this benzil reductase showed high identity to the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (sdr) family, enzymological features were unknown. here, we demonstrated that many b. cereus strains had benzil reductase activity in vivo, and that the benzil reductases shared 94-100% amino acid identities. recombinant b. cereus benzil reductase produced optically pure (s)-benzoin with nadph in vitro, and the ketone group distal to a benzene ring was asymmetrically reduced. b. cereus benzil reductase showed 31% amino acid identity to the yeast open reading frame yir036c protein and 28-30% to mammalian  sepiapterin reductases, sharing the seven residues consensus for the sdr family.  we isolated the genes encoding yeast yir036c protein and gerbil sepiapterin reductase, and both recombinant proteins also reduced benzil to (s)-benzoin in vitro. green fluorescent protein-tagged b. cereus benzil reductase distributed in the bipolar cytoplasm in b. cereus cells. asymmetric reduction with b. cereus benzil reductase, yeast yir036c protein and gerbil sepiapterin reductase will be  utilized to produce important chiral compounds.

AB  == the objective was to evaluate foodborne outbreaks of undetermined aetiology by comparing them to pathogen-specific epidemiologic profiles of laboratory-confirmed foodborne outbreaks. national foodborne outbreak data reported to cdc during 1982-9 were categorized by clinico-epidemiologic profiles  based on incubation, duration, percent vomiting, fever and vomiting to fever ratio. from the pathogen-specific profiles, five syndromes were developed: a vomiting-toxin syndrome resembling bacillus cereus and staphylococcus aureus; a diarrhoea-toxin syndrome characteristic of clostridium perfringens, a diarrhaeogenic escherichia coli syndrome, a norwalk-like virus syndrome, and a salmonella like syndrome. of 712 outbreaks, 624 (87.6%) matched one of five syndromes; 340 (47.8%) matched the norwalk-like syndrome and 83 (11.7%) matched the salmonella-like syndrome. after combining information on known pathogens and  epidemiologic profiles, only 88 (12.4%) outbreaks remained unclassified. norwalk-like virus outbreaks appear as common as salmonella-like outbreaks. we conclude that profiling can help classify outbreaks, guide investigations and direct laboratory testing to help detect new and emerging pathogens.

TI  == effects of antibacterial dishwashing liquid on foodborne pathogens and competitive microorganisms in kitchen sponges.
AB  == in response to increasing concern about home hygiene, the use of antibacterial products to reduce microorganisms in kitchen sponges and cleaning cloths is strongly promoted by some producers of detergent for domestic use. the effects of an antibacterial dishwashing liquid on escherichia coli, salmonella enteritidis,  staphylococcus aureus, and bacillus cereus were investigated in a modified suspension test and in used sponges with and without food residues under laboratory conditions. a limited study was conducted in households to assess the  efficacy of antibacterial dishwashing liquid as used by the consumer. in the suspension tests, s. aureus and b. cereus were shown to be susceptible to low concentrations of antibacterial dishwashing liquid (0.5%), whereas e. coli and salmonella enteritidis maintained their initial numbers for at least 24 h at 25 degrees c. at higher concentrations (2 to 4%), all test organisms decreased to below the detection limit after 24 h. over a 24-h period, the antibacterial dishwashing liquid did not significantly reduce these organisms in used sponges in which food residues were present. the antibacterial product did not reduce the competitive microorganisms either. similar results were found for sponges involved in daily household use. the results of this study demonstrate that the antibacterial dishwashing liquid was effective in reducing pathogens in the suspension test but not in the used sponges. this finding indicates that to determine the efficacy of antibacterial products, their use in a household setting must be considered.

AB  == certain formulations of nanoscale powders possess antimicrobial properties. these formulations are made of simple, nontoxic metal oxides such as magnesium oxide (mgo) and calcium oxide (cao, lime) in nanocrystalline form, carrying active forms of halogens, for example, mgo. cl2 and mgo. br2. when these ultrafine powders contact vegetative cells of escherichia coli, bacillus cereus, or bacillus globigii, over 90% are killed within a few minutes. likewise, spore forms of the bacillus species are decontaminated within several hours. dry contact with aflatoxins and contact with ms2 bacteriophage (surrogate of human enterovirus) in water also causes decontamination in minutes.

TI  == cloning and sequencing of two genes encoding chitinases a and b from bacillus cereus ch.
AB  == two genes encoding chitinases a and b (chia and chib) from bacillus cereus ch were cloned into escherichia coli xl1-blue mrf', by using pbluescript ii sk+, and their nucleotide sequences were determined. open reading frames of the chia and chib genes encoded distinct polypeptide chains consisting of 360 and 674 amino acid residues, respectively, with calculated molecular sizes of 39,470 and 74,261 da, respectively. comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences with those of other bacterial chitinases revealed that chitinase a consisted of a catalytic domain, while chitinase b consisted of three functional domains, a catalytic domain, a fibronectin type iii-like domain, and a cellulose-binding domain. the primary structures of these two proteins were not similar to each other.

TI  == evaluation of the bact/alert automated blood culture system for detecting bacteria and measuring their growth kinetics in leucodepleted and non-leucodepleted platelet concentrates.
AB  == background and objective: to evaluate the bact/alert automated blood culture system for the detection of bacteria in platelet concentrates, and to determine bacterial growth kinetics in leucodepleted and non-leucodepleted units. materials and methods: apheresis (cobe leucocyte reduction system [lrs]) and pooled buffy coat-derived (optipress) platelet concentrates (pcs) were tested. six organisms were used for spiking the pcs: clostridium perfringens, bacillus cereus, group b  streptococcus, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus and escherichia  coli. units were inoculated to give a final concentration of approximately equal  to 1 and 50 colony-forming units (cfu)/ml. on days 0, 2 and 5, bact/alert standard aerobic and anaerobic bottles were inoculated with a 5-ml fill volume and bacteria were enumerated. results: the bact/alert automated blood culture system gave rapid determination times of spiked units, with all positives detected within 48 h and 98.1% detected within 24 h. in general, as the inoculum  concentration increased, the detection time decreased. rapid growth was obtained  with all organisms tested except for b. cereus, which failed to grow on four occasions. bacterial numbers on day 2 ranged from 10(5) to 10(11) cfu/ml and on day 5 ranged from 10(4) to 10(12) cfu/ml. growth was not significantly greater in leucodepleted units. conclusions: the study confirmed that pcs are an excellent growth medium for bacteria. rapid and substantial growth was obtained with all organisms under test. leucodepletion does not appear to enhance bacterial proliferation. the bact/alert automated blood culture system could rapidly detect contamination of units. bacterial screening using an automated blood culture system is therefore a potential option.

TI  == inhibitory activity of honey against foodborne pathogens as influenced by the presence of hydrogen peroxide and level of antioxidant power.
AB  == antimicrobial activity of honey has been attributed to hydrogen peroxide, which is produced by naturally occurring glucose oxidase, and phenolic compounds, although lethality of and inhibition by these and other components against microorganisms vary greatly, depending on the floral source of nectar. this study was undertaken to compare honeys from six floral sources for their inhibitory activity against escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella typhimurium, shigella sonnei, listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, and bacillus cereus. a disc assay revealed that development of zones of inhibition of growth depends on  the type and concentration of honey, as well as the test pathogen. growth of b. cereus was least affected. the inhibition of growth of s. sonnei, l. monocytogenes, and s. aureus in 25% solutions of honeys was reduced by treating solutions with catalase, indicating that hydrogen peroxide contributes to antimicrobial activity. darker colored honeys were generally more inhibitory than light colored honeys. darker honeys also contained higher antioxidant power. since antimicrobial activity of the darker colored test honeys was not eliminated by catalase treatment, non-peroxide components such as antioxidants may contribute to controlling the growth of some foodborne pathogens. the antibacterial properties of honeys containing hydrogen peroxide and characterized by a range of antioxidant power need to be validated using model food systems.

TI  == novel immuno-fret assay method for bacillus spores and escherichia coli o157:h7.
AB  == novel immunofluorescence resonance energy transfer (immuno-fret) assays for both  bacillus cereus spores and escherichia coli o157:h7 are reported. both assays involve the use of dual (qsy-7 and oregon green 514-antibody)-labeled spores or vegetative bacteria, such that oregon green 514-labeled antibodies are quenched by proximal qsy-7 molecules that are covalently bound to the dual (oregon green 514 and qsy-7)-labeled cells. upon introduction of unlabeled bacteria or spores,  in the respective assays, an increase in fluorescence is observed in proportion to the numbers of unlabeled cells. this is due to migration of oregon green 514-labeled antibody from the dual-labeled cells to the unlabeled target cells as verified by fluorescence microscopy. optimization of the qsy-7 surface density led to a b. cereus spore detection sensitivity of approximately 1.0 x 10(5) to 2.5 x 10(5) spores per milliliter and 3.5 x 10(5) cells per milliliter for e. coli using a conventional cuvette-based spectrofluorometer.

AB  == gern, a bacillus cereus spore germination protein, exhibits homology to a widely  distributed group of putative cation transporters or channel proteins. gern complemented the na(+)-sensitive phenotype of an escherichia coli mutant that is  deficient in na(+)/h(+) antiport activity (strain knabc). gern also reduced the concentration of k(+) required to support growth of an e. coli mutant deficient in k(+) uptake (strain tk2420). in a fluorescence-based assay of everted e. coli  knabc membrane vesicles, gern exhibited robust na(+)/h(+) antiport activity, with a k(m) for na(+) estimated at 1.5 mm at ph 8.0 and 25 mm at ph 7.0. li(+), but not k(+), served as a substrate. gern-mediated na(+)/h(+) antiport was further demonstrated in everted vesicles as energy-dependent accumulation of (22)na(+). gern also used k(+) as a coupling ion without completely replacing h(+), as indicated by partial inhibition by k(+) of h(+) uptake into right-side-out vesicles loaded with na(+). k(+) translocation as part of the antiport was supported by the stimulatory effect of intravesicular k(+) on (22)na(+) uptake by everted vesicles and the dependence of gern-mediated (86)rb(+) efflux on the presence of na(+) in trans. the inhibitory patterns of protonophore and thiocyanate were most consistent with an electrogenic na(+)/h(+)-k(+) antiport. gern-mediated na(+)/h(+)-k(+) antiport was much more rapid than gern-mediated na(+)/h(+) antiport.

AB  == the in vitro antiviral activity of the essential oil from minthostachys verticillata was investigated against herpes simplex virus type 1 (hsv-1) and pseudorabies virus (prv). the viral inhibition was assayed employing viral plaque reduction assay. the antiviral activity of the essential oil specifically affects prv and hsv-1 multiplication, since it was found that non toxic effects on cells  were observed at the concentrations assayed. the therapeutic index values were 10.0 and 9.5 for hsv-1 and prv, respectively. the antibacterial activity was studied using a diffusion assay and the broth tube dilution method. gram-positive bacteria were more sensitive to inhibition by plant essential oil than the gram-negative bacteria. the essential oil of m. verticillata was analyzed by gas  chromatography (gc) technique. of the six components identified in the volatile oil, pulegone (44.56%) and menthone (39.51%) were the major constituents. the antimicrobial activity can be explained to some extent by the presence of pulegone. results suggest that further investigations concerning the isolation of the substance responsible for the antimicrobial activity and an effort to define  the mechanisms of action are warranted.

TI  == class ii broad-spectrum mercury resistance transposons in gram-positive bacteria  from natural environments.
AB  == we have studied the mechanisms of the horizontal dissemination of a broad-spectrum mercury resistance determinant among bacillus and related species. this mer determinant was first described in bacillus cereus rc607 from boston harbor, usa, and was then found in various bacillus and related species in japan, russia and england. we have shown that the mer determinant can either be located  at the chromosome, or on a plasmid in the bacillus species, and is carried by class ii mercury resistance transposons: tn5084 from b. cereus rc607 and b. cereus vkm684 (atcc10702) and tn5085 from exiguobacterium sp. tc38-2b. tn5085 is  identical in nucleotide sequence to tnmeri1, the only other known mer transposon  from bacillus species, but it does not contain an intron like tnmeri1. tn5085 is  functionally active in escherichia coli. tn5083, which we have isolated from b. megaterium mk64-1, contains an rc607-like mer determinant, that has lost some mercury resistance genes and possesses a mera gene which is a novel sequence variant that has not been previously described. tn5083 and tn5084 are recombinants, and are comprised of fragments from several transposons including tn5085, and a relative of a putative transposon from b. firmus (which contains similar genes to the cadmium resistance operon of staphylococcus aureus), as well as others. the sequence data showed evidence for recombination both between transposition genes and between mer determinants.

TI  == an enzymatic assay for quantifying sphingomyelin in tissues and plasma from humans and mice with niemann-pick disease.
AB  == sphingomyelin is an important lipid component of cell membranes and lipoproteins  which can be hydrolyzed by sphingomyelinases into ceramide and phosphorylcholine. the type a and b forms of niemann-pick disease (npd) are lipid storage disorders  due to the deficient activity of the enzyme acid sphingomyelinase, and the resultant accumulation of sphingomyelin in cells and tissues. in this paper we report a new, enzyme-based method to quantify the levels of sphingomyelin in tissues and plasma of normal individuals and npd patients. the method utilizes sphingomyelinase from bacillus cereus to completely hydrolyze the sphingomyelin into ceramide. quantification of the sphingomyelin-derived ceramide is accomplished using escherichia coli diacylglycerol (dag) kinase and [gamma-(32)p]atp. the resulting [(32)p]ceramide is quantified using a phosphor-imager system following tlc separation. this procedure allowed quantification of sphingomyelin over a broad range from 10 pmol to 1 nmol. to validate this assay we quantified sphingomyelin in plasma and tissues obtained from normal and npd mice and humans. the sphingomyelin content in adult homozygous (-/-) or heterozygous (+/-) npd mouse plasma was significantly elevated compared to that of normal mice (up to twofold). moreover, the accumulated sphingomyelin in the tissues of npd mice was 4 to 40 times higher than that in normal mice depending on the tissue analyzed. the sphingomyelin levels in plasma from several type b npd patients also were significantly elevated compared to normal individuals of the same age. based on these results we propose that this new, enzyme-based procedure can provide sensitive and reproducible sphingomyelin quantification in tissues and fluids from normal individuals and npd patients. it could be a useful tool for the diagnosis of npd  and the evaluation of npd treatment protocols, as well as for the study of ceramide-mediated apoptosis since the method provides the simultaneous determination of sphingomyelin and ceramide in the same lipid extract.

TI  == inhibition tests for detection and presumptive identification of tetracyclines, beta-lactam antibiotics and quinolones in poultry meat.
AB  == a combination of three plates, seeded with strains of micrococcus luteus, bacillus cereus or escherichia coli, can be used for detection of residues of beta-lactam antibiotics, tetracyclines and fluoroquinolones. the sensitivity of each plate is optimal for only one of these groups, resulting in detection limits (lod) lower than the corresponding maximum residue limits (mrl) and in distinct inhibition patterns typical for each antibiotic family. beta-lactam antibiotics such as penicillin g, ampicillin and amoxicillin give only inhibition zones on the plate with m. luteus. tetracyclines are detected up to the mrl level with b.  cereus, and fluoroquinolones with e. coli. the lods of the antibiotics tested were as follows: penicillin g (peng) 0.9 ng, ampicillin (ampi) 0.6 ng and amoxicillin (amox) 1.0 ng on the plate with m. luteus; tetracycline (tet) 4 ng, oxytetracycline (oxy) 3 ng, doxycycline (dox) 0.6 ng, and chlortetracycline (chl) 0.3 ng on the plate with b. cereus; enrofloxacin (enrx) 1.5 ng, ciprofloxacin (cipx) 0.5 ng and flumequine (flum) 1.5 ng on the plate with e. coli. the combination of plates enables the laboratory to select appropriate chromatographic techniques for identification and quantification of the residues. on the other hand, the three groups can also be detected on one plate seeded with bacillus subtilis, although the limits of detection are higher: peng 0.4 ng, ampi and amox 3 ng, tet 5 ng, oxy 8 ng, dox 1 ng, chl 0.5 ng, enrx 4 ng, cipx 10 ng and flum 4 ng. the test was applied to 228 broiler fillets and to 27 turkey thighs, originating from different poultry slaughterhouses. nineteen broiler fillets contained inhibiting substances. the positive results of the inhibition tests were confirmed with a chromatographic technique. doxycycline residues were  found in 16 samples and amoxicillin in two.

AB  == background: approximately 1 in 2000 platelet components are bacterially contaminated. the time to detection of 15 seeded organisms in platelets recovered from an automated culture system was studied. study design and methods: isolates  of bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, candida albicans, clostridium perfringens, corynebacterium species, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, propionibacterium acnes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus,  staphylococcus epidermidis, serratia marcescens, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus viridans were inoculated into day 2 apheresis platelet components to obtain a final concentration of approximately 10 and 100 cfu per ml (2 units/organism). each bag was sampled 10 times (20 ml/sample). four ml of each sample was inoculated into standard aerobic and anaerobic bottles and into aerobic and anaerobic bottles containing charcoal; 2 ml was inoculated into pediatric aerobic bottles (so as to maintain a 1:10 ratio of sample to media) and 1 ml into thioglycollate broth. results: with the exception of p. acnes, all organisms were detected in a mean of 9.2 to 25.6 hours. a range of 10 serial dilutions in inoculating concentrations was associated with an overall 10.1-percent difference in detection time. a mean of 74.4 and 86.2 hours (100 and 10 cfu/ml inocula, respectively) was required for the detection of p. acnes in anaerobic bottles. conclusion: bacteria thought to be clinically significant platelet contaminants can be detected in 9.2 to 25.6 hours when the starting concentration is approximately 10 to 100 cfu per ml. p. acnes required considerably longer incubation times for detection (in either aerobic or anaerobic bottles). however, p. acnes is of questionable clinical significance. such a detection system could be used in either a blood collection center or a transfusion service to screen platelet concentrates for bacterial contamination.  such testing (with sterile sampling performed so as to maintain a closed-bag system) would be expected to save lives and might allow an extension of platelet  storage.

AB  == one hundred and thirty-two samples of beef, chicken, salad and gravy were collected from two street vendors over eleven replicate surveys to assess microbiological safety and quality. for each food type samples were collected during preparation and holding. dish water was also collected and food preparation surfaces swabbed during preparation and display. standard methods were used to determine aerobic plate counts, enterobacteriaceae counts, coliform  counts and spore counts. six hundred and seventy-five predominant colonies were isolated from aerobic plate counts of all samples and characterised. the incidence of selected foodborne bacterial pathogens and non-pathogenic e. coli 1  was also determined. in most cases mean bacterial counts of the raw materials were significantly higher (p < 0.05) than those of corresponding cooked foods. no significant differences (p > 0.05) in all count types were observed between food  samples collected during cooking and those collected during holding. in addition, no significant differences (p > 0.05) in all count types were observed between prepared salads and their raw materials. mean bacterial counts of water and swab  samples collected from vendor 1 were lower than those of water and swab samples collected from vendor 2.the predominant populations isolated from the aerobic plate counts were bacillus spp., staphylococcus spp., enterobacteriaceae and alcaligenes spp. bacillus cereus was detected in 17%, clostridium perfringens in  1%, staphylococcus aureus in 3% and vibrio metchnikovii in 2% of the food samples. campylobacter jejuni, listeria monocytogenes, and escherichia coli o157:h7 were not detected. non-pathogenic e. coli 1 was detected in 13% of food samples, in 86 and 36% of dish water samples collected from vendors 1 and 2, respectively, and in 36% of surface swab samples from vendor 2.

TI  == human cell exposure assays of bacillus thuringiensis commercial insecticides: production of bacillus cereus-like cytolytic effects from outgrowth of spores.
AB  == most contemporary bioinsecticides are derived from scaled-up cultures of bacillus thuringiensis subspecies israelensis (bti) and kurstaki (btk), whose particulate  fractions contain mostly b. thuringiensis spores (> 10(12)/l) and proteinaceous aggregates, including crystal-like parasporal inclusion bodies (pib). based on concerns over relatedness to b. cereus-group pathogens, we conducted extensive testing of b. thuringiensis (bt) products and their subfractions using seven human cell types. the bti/btk products generated nonspecific cytotoxicities involving loss in bioreduction, cell rounding, blebbing and detachment, degradation of immunodetectable proteins, and cytolysis. their threshold dose (dt approximately equal.5 times 10(-14)% bt product/target cell) equated to a single  spore and a target cell half-life (tld(50)) of approximately 16 hr. at dts > 10(4), the tld(50) rapidly shifted to < 4 hr; with antibiotic present, no component, including pib-related [delta]-endotoxins, was cytolytic up to an equivalent of approximately 10(9 )dt. the cytolytic agent(s) within the bti/btk-vegetative cell exoprotein (vcp) pool is an early spore outgrowth product identical to that of b. cereus and acting possibly by arresting protein synthesis. no cytolytic effects were seen with vcp from b. subtilis and escherichia coli. these data, including recent epidemiologic work indicate that spore-containing bt products have an inherent capacity to lyse human cells in free and interactive forms and may also act as immune sensitizers. to critically  impact at the whole body level, the exposure outcome would have to be an uncontrolled infection arising from intake of btk/bti spores. for humans, such a  condition would be rare, arising possibly in equally rare exposure scenarios involving large doses of spores and individuals with weak or impaired microbe-clearance capacities and/or immune response systems.

TI  == antimicrobial effect of rosemary extracts.
AB  == a rosemary extract commercially exploited (oxy'less) as an antioxidant of lipids  in foods was dissolved in ethanol (100 mg/ml), and the solution was tested against foodborne microorganisms. for gram-positive bacteria, the mic of the ethanolic solution was 1% for leuconostoc mesenteroides, 0.5% for listeria monocytogenes, 0.5% for staphylococcus aureus, 0.13% for streptococcus mutans, and 0.06% for bacillus cereus. it slowed the growth of penicillium roquefortii and botrytis cinerea. up to 1% of the ethanolic solution had no activity on the gram-negative bacteria escherichia coli, salmonella enteritidis, and erwinia carotovora and on the yeasts rhodotorula glutinis and cryptococcus laurentii. antibacterial activity of the rosemary extract was strongly influenced by the composition of the media. the mic was reduced by low ph, high nacl contents, and  low temperatures. low ph and high nacl concentration had a synergistic effect on  the mic of the rosemary extract for s. aureus. lipids, surface-active agents, and some proteins decreased its antibacterial activity, whereas pectin had no effect. the inhibitory effect was little modified by heat treatment (100 degrees c). the  natural microflora of pasteurized zucchini broth was inhibited by 0.5% of the rosemary extract. the antibacterial activity was linked to the compounds extracted with hexane, which are presumably phenolic diterpenoids.

TI  == structural model requirements to describe microbial inactivation during a mild heat treatment.
AB  == the classical concept of d and z values, established for sterilisation processes, is unable to deal with the typical non-loglinear behaviour of survivor curves occurring during the mild heat treatment of sous vide or cook-chill food products. structural model requirements are formulated, eliminating immediately some candidate model types. promising modelling approaches are thoroughly analysed and, if applicable, adapted to the specific needs: two models developed  by casolari (1988), the inactivation model of sapru et al. (1992), the model of whiting (1993), the baranyi and roberts growth model (1994), the model of chiruta et al. (1997), the model of daughtry et al. (1997) and the model of xiong et al.  (1999). a range of experimental data of bacillus cereus, yersinia enterocolitica, escherichia coli o157:h7, listeria monocytogenes and lactobacillus sake are used  to illustrate the different models' performances. moreover, a novel modelling approach is developed, fulfilling all formulated structural model requirements, and based on a careful analysis of literature knowledge of the shoulder and tailing phenomenon. although a thorough insight in the occurrence of shoulders and tails is still lacking from a biochemical point of view, this newly developed model incorporates the possibility of a straightforward interpretation within this framework.

TI  == new developments in chromogenic and fluorogenic culture media.
AB  == this review describes some recent developments in chromogenic and fluorogenic culture media in microbiological diagnostic. the detection of beta-d-glucuronidase (gud) activity for enumeration of escherichia coli is well known. e. coli o157:h7 strains are usually gud-negative and do not ferment sorbitol. these characteristics are used in selective media for these organisms and new chromogenic media are available. some of the new chromogenic media make the salmonella diagnostic easier and faster. the use of chromogenic and fluorogenic substrates for detection of beta-d-glucosidase (beta-glu) activity to differentiate enterococci has received considerable attention and new media are described. rapid detection of clostridium perfringens, listeria monocytogenes, bacillus cereus and staphylococcus aureus are other application of enzyme detection methods in food and water microbiology.

TI  == characterization of reutericyclin produced by lactobacillus reuteri lth2584.
AB  == lactobacillus reuteri lth2584 exhibits antimicrobial activity that can be attributed neither to bacteriocins nor to the production of reuterin or organic acids. we have purified the active compound, named reutericyclin, to homogeneity  and characterized its antimicrobial activity. reutericyclin exhibited a broad inhibitory spectrum including lactobacillus spp., bacillus subtilis, b. cereus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, and listeria innocua. it did not affect the growth of gram-negative bacteria; however, the growth of lipopolysaccharide mutant strains of escherichia coli was inhibited. reutericyclin exhibited a bactericidal mode of action against lactobacillus sanfranciscensis, staphylococcus aureus, and b. subtilis and triggered the lysis  of cells of l. sanfranciscensis in a dose-dependent manner. germination of spores of b. subtilis was inhibited, but the spores remained unaffected under conditions that do not permit germination. the fatty acid supply of the growth media had a strong effect on reutericyclin production and its distribution between producer cells and the culture supernatant. reutericyclin was purified from cell extracts  and culture supernatant of l. reuteri lth2584 cultures grown in mmrs by solvent extraction, gel filtration, rp-c(8) chromatography, and anion-exchange chromatography, followed by rechromatography by reversed-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography. reutericyclin was characterized as a negatively charged, highly hydrophobic molecule with a molecular mass of 349 da. structural characterization (a. holtzel, m. g. ganzle, g. j. nicholson, w. p. hammes, and g. jung, angew. chem. int. ed. 39:2766-2768, 2000) revealed that reutericyclin is a  novel tetramic acid derivative. the inhibitory activity of culture supernatant of l. reuteri lth2584 corresponded to that of purified as well as synthetic reutericyclin.

AB  == pseudomonas aeruginosa col-1 was identified in a blood culture of a 39-year-old-woman treated with imipenem in marseilles, france, in 1996. this strain was resistant to beta-lactams, including ureidopenicillins, ticarcillin-clavulanic acid, cefepime, ceftazidime, imipenem, and meropenem, but  remained susceptible to the monobactam aztreonam. the carbapenem-hydrolyzing beta-lactamase gene of p. aeruginosa col-1 was cloned, sequenced, and expressed in escherichia coli dh10b. the deduced 266-amino-acid protein was an ambler class b beta-lactamase, with amino acid identities of 32% with b-ii from bacillus cereus; 31% with imp-1 from several gram-negative rods in japan, including p. aeruginosa; 27% with ccra from bacteroides fragilis; 24% with blab from chryseobacterium meningosepticum; 24% with ind-1 from chryseobacterium indologenes; 21% with cpha-1 from aeromonas hydrophila; and 11% with l-1 from stenotrophomonas maltophilia. it was most closely related to vim-1 beta-lactamase recently reported from italian p. aeruginosa clinical isolates (90% amino acid identity). purified vim-2 beta-lactamase had a pi of 5.6, a relative molecular mass of 29.7 kda, and a broad substrate hydrolysis range, including penicillins,  cephalosporins, cephamycins, oxacephamycins, and carbapenems, but not monobactams. as a metallo-beta-lactamase, its activity was zinc dependent and inhibited by edta (50% inhibitory concentration, 50 microm). vim-2 conferred a resistance pattern to beta-lactams in e. coli dh10b that paralleled its in vitro  hydrolytic properties, except for susceptibility to ureidopenicillins, carbapenems, and cefepime. bla(vim-2) was located on a ca. 45-kb plasmid that in  addition conferred resistance to sulfamides and that was not self-transmissible either from p. aeruginosa to e. coli or from e. coli to e. coli. bla(vim-2) was the only gene cassette located within the variable region of a novel class 1 integron, in56, that was weakly related to the bla(vim-1)-containing integron. vim-2 is the second carbapenem-hydrolyzing metalloenzyme characterized from a p.  aeruginosa isolate outside japan.

TI  == a novel spore peptidoglycan hydrolase of bacillus cereus: biochemical characterization and nucleotide sequence of the corresponding gene, slel.
AB  == the exudate of germinated spores of b. cereus ifo 13597 in 0.15 m kcl-50 mm potassium phosphate (ph 7.0) contained a spore-lytic enzyme which has substrate specificity for fragmented spore cortex from wild-type organisms (cortical-fragment-lytic enzyme [cfle]), in addition to a previously characterized germination-specific hydrolase which acts on intact spore cortex (spore cortex-lytic enzyme [scle]) (r. moriyama, s. kudoh, s. miyata, s. nonobe,  a. hattori, and s. makino, j. bacteriol. 178:5330-5332, 1996). cfle was not capable of degrading isolated cortical fragments from spores of bacillus subtilis add1, which lacks muramic acid delta-lactam. this suggests that cfle cooperates with scle in cortex hydrolysis during germination. cfle was purified in an active form and identified as a 48-kda protein which functions as an n-acetylglucosaminidase. immunochemical studies suggested that the mature enzyme  is localized on a rather peripheral region of the dormant spore, probably the exterior of the cortex layer. a gene encoding the enzyme, slel, was cloned in escherichia coli, and the nucleotide sequence was determined. the gene encodes a  protein of 430 amino acids with a deduced molecular weight of 48,136. the n-terminal region contains a repeated motif common to several peptidoglycan binding proteins. inspection of the data banks showed no similarity of cfle with  n-acetylglucosaminidases found so far, suggesting that cfle is a novel type of n-acetylglucosaminidase. the b. subtilis genome sequence contains genes, yaah and ydhd, which encode putative proteins showing similarity to slel.

AB  == phosphonoacetaldehyde hydrolase, a c-p bond-cleaving enzyme which utilizes an unusual bicovalent catalytic strategy, has been crystallized by the hanging-drop  vapor-diffusion method using peg 4000 as the precipitant. the crystals belong to  the monoclinic system and belong to space group c2, with unit-cell parameters a = 210.5, b = 45.5, c = 64.7 a, beta = 105.0 degrees. the asymmetric unit contains a dimer related by a non-crystallographic dyad. in addition to a 2.7 a native data  set, the following data sets have been collected: a 2.4 a data set from crystals  complexed with the intermediate analog vinyl sulfonate, a 3.0 a three-wavelength  mad data set from crystals complexed with the product analog wo(4)(2-), as well as several heavy-atom data sets to 3.0 a or better, of which only three have proven useful for mir calculations. examination of the native patterson map revealed ncs that made previously uninterpretable derivative data useful. independent phase sets were first calculated and refined for the mad and mir experiments separately and were then combined. the combined phase set was further improved by solvent flattening, histogram matching and ncs averaging. interpretation of the resulting electron-density map is currently under way.

TI  == effect of l-glucose and d-tagatose on bacterial growth in media and a cooked cured ham product.
AB  == cured meats such as ham can undergo premature spoilage on account of the proliferation of lactic acid bacteria. this spoilage is generally evident from a  milkiness in the purge of vacuum-packaged sliced ham. although cured, most hams are at more risk of spoilage than other types of processed meat products because  they contain considerably higher concentrations of carbohydrates, approximately 2 to 7%, usually in the form of dextrose and corn syrup solids. unfortunately, the  meat industry is restricted with respect to the choice of preservatives and bactericidal agents. an alternative approach from these chemical compounds would  be to use novel carbohydrate sources that are unrecognizable to spoilage bacteria. l-glucose and d-tagatose are two such potential sugars, and in a series of tests in vitro, the ability of bacteria to utilize each as an energy source was compared to that of d-glucose. results showed that both l-glucose and d-tagatose are not easily catabolized by a variety of lactic bacteria and not at  all by pathogenic bacteria such as escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella typhimurium, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, and yersinia enterocolitica. in a separate study, d-glucose, l-glucose, and d-tagatose were added to a chopped and formed ham formulation and the rate of bacterial growth was monitored. analysis of data by a general linear model revealed that the growth rates of total aerobic and lactic acid bacteria were significantly (p < 0.05) slower for the formulation containing d-tagatose than those containing l- or d-glucose. levels of enterobacteriaceae were initially low and these bacteria did not significantly (p < 0.20) change in the presence of any of the sugars used in the  meat formulations. compared to the control sample containing d-glucose, the shelf life of the chopped and formed ham containing d-tagatose at 10 degrees c was extended by 7 to 10 days. these results indicate that d-tagatose could deter the  growth of microorganisms and inhibit the rate of spoilage in a meat product containing carbohydrates.

TI  == rt-pcr: characterization of long multi-gene operons and multiple transcript gene  clusters in bacteria.
AB  == reverse transcription (rt)-pcr is a valuable tool widely used for analysis of gene expression. in bacteria, rt-pcr is helpful beyond standard protocols of northern blot rna/dna hybridization (to identify transcripts) and primer extension (to locate their start points), as these methods have been difficult with transcripts that are low in abundance or unstable, similar to long multi-gene operons. in this report, rt-pcr is adapted to analyze transcripts that form long multi-gene operons--where they start and where they stop. the transcripts can also be semiquantitated to follow the expression of genes under different growth conditions. examples using rt-pcr are presented with two different multi-gene systems for metal cation resistance to silver and mercury ions. the silver resistance system [9 open reading frames (orfs); 12.5 kb] is shown by rt-pcr to synthesize three nonoverlapping messenger rnas that are transcribed divergently. in the mercury resistance system (8 orfs; 6.3 kb), all the genes are transcribed in the same orientation, and two promoter sites produce overlapping transcripts. for rt-pcr, reverse transcriptase enzyme is used to synthesize first-strand cdna that is used as a template for pcr amplification of  single-gene products, from the beginning, middle or end of long multi-gene, multi-transcript gene clusters.

TI  == changing epidemiology of infections in patients with neutropenia and cancer: emphasis on gram-positive and resistant bacteria.
AB  == over the past 3 decades, considerable changes have occurred in the types of bacteria causing infection in febrile patients with neutropenia and cancer. twenty years ago, gram-negative bacteria caused approximately 70% of bloodstream  infections. as a probable consequence of long-dwelling intravascular devices, fluoroquinolone prophylaxis, and high-dose chemotherapy-induced mucositis, there  has been a shift toward gram-positive coccal bacteremia. in most centers today, approximately 70% of bacteremic isolates are gram-positive cocci. of potential concern is that antimicrobial-resistant gram-positive organisms are becoming increasingly frequent in patients with neutropenia. fluoroquinolone-resistant escherichia coli are being isolated from several cancer centers. several "new" organisms, such as stomatococcus mucilaginosus, bacillus cereus, leuconostoc species, corynebacterium jeikeium, rhodococcus species, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, moraxella catarrhalis, burkholderia cepacia, and bartonella species, now cause infections in these patients. careful application of infection-control  principles, judicious prophylaxis, appropriate evaluation of new antibiotics, and prompt effective therapy will maximize benefits for these patients.

AB  == bacillus cereus strain pym1 is a mutant unable to synthesize haem a or spectrally detectable cytochromes aa3 or caa3. the nature of the remaining oxidase(s) catalysing oxygen uptake has been studied. respiratory oxidase activities and the levels of cytochromes b and c increased 2.6- to 4.2-fold on transition from exponential growth, in either of two media, to sporulation stage iii, as previously observed for the parent wild-type strain. nadh oxidase activity at both stages of culture was several-fold higher than ascorbate plus tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine (tmpd) oxidase activity, consistent with the tmpd- phenotype of strain pym1. oxidase activity with ascorbate as substrate was significant even in the absence of tmpd as electron mediator, suggesting that the terminal oxidase receives electrons from a cytochrome c. carbon monoxide (co) difference spectra of membranes were obtained using various reductants (ascorbate +/- tmpd, nadh, dithionite) and revealed a haemoprotein resembling cytochrome o'. the co complex of this cytochrome was photodissociable: the photodissociation spectrum (photolysed minus co-ligated) exhibited a trough at 416 nm and a peak at 436 nm, together with minor features in the alpha/beta region of the spectrum, consistent with the presence of a cytochrome o'-like pigment. co recombination occurred at -85 to -95 degrees c. no other haemoproteins showing photoreversible  co binding under these conditions were detected. evidence that this pigment was the oxidase responsible for substrate oxidation was obtained by photodissociating the co complex at subzero temperatures in the presence of oxygen; this resulted in faster ligand recombination, attributed to oxygen binding, and extensive oxidation of cytochromes c and b. the oxygen affinity of the oxidase was determined by using the deoxygenation of oxyleghaemoglobin as a sensitive reporter of dissociated oxygen concentration. a single oxidase was revealed with  a k(m) for oxygen of about 8 nm; this is one of the highest affinities yet reported for a terminal oxidase.

TI  == a quantitative approach for studying the effect of heat treatment conditions on resistance and recovery of bacillus cereus spores.
AB  == when a bacterial population undergoes an unfavourable transient increase in temperature, a death phase followed by a lag and growth phase are observed for the surviving and cultivable population. the lag phase is of great interest in regard to food safety, but for bacterial spores, very few studies have been carried out on the evolution of lag time versus heat treatment duration. the experiments monitored on spores of two strains of bacillus cereus showed a biphasic evolution of the lag time for germination of stressed spores with increase in heat treatment duration, at 90 degrees c, 95 degrees c and 100 degrees c and for different recovery conditions in laboratory medium. initially,  the lag time increased with the duration of the thermal stress up to an optimum.  subsequently, the lag time decreased, with increasing stress duration, to a threshold. the evolution of the lag time to germination of surviving spores, under the range of temperature tested, was similar to the evolution of the lag time to growth after mild-temperature treatments observed with vegetative cells of escherichia coli and listeria monocytogenes by breand et al. (1997) [breand, s., fardel, g., flandrois, j.-p., rosso, l., tomassone, r., 1997. a model describing the relationship between lag time and mild temperature increase duration. int. j. food microbiol. 38, 157-167]. the mathematical model established from these investigations could also be applied in the case of heat-stressed spores. moreover, it was observed that there was a significant linear relationship between the d-value and the treatment duration that gave the  maximum lag time.

AB  == a unique transposon was found in the chromosome of bacillus megaterium mb1, a gram-positive bacterium isolated from mercury-polluted sediments of minamata bay, japan. the transposon region of a 14.5kb dna fragment was amplified by pcr using  a single pcr primer designed from the nucleotide sequence of an inverted repeat of class ii transposons. the molecular analysis revealed that the pcr-amplified dna fragment encodes a transposition module similar to that of tn21. the transposon also encodes a broad-spectrum mercury resistance region having a restriction endonuclease map identical to that of bacillus cereus rc607, a strain isolated from boston harbor, usa. the result of a phylogenetic analysis of the amino acid sequence of putative resolvase of the transposon showed that the transposon is phylogenetically closer to the transposons of gram-positive bacteria than those of gram-negative bacteria. besides the transposition module and mer operon, the transposon encodes a mobile genetic element of bacterial group ii introns between the resolvase gene and mer operon. the intron, however,  does not intervene in any exon gene. the discovery of this newly found combination of the complex mobile elements may offer a clue to understanding the  horizontal dissemination of broad-spectrum mercury resistance among microbes.

TI  == cloning and characterization of blavim, a new integron-borne metallo-beta-lactamase gene from a pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolate.
AB  == production of a metallo-beta-lactamase activity was detected in a carbapenem-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolate (isolate vr-143/97)  from an italian inpatient at the verona university hospital (northern italy). the metallo-beta-lactamase determinant was isolated from a genomic library of vr-143/97, constructed in an escherichia coli plasmid vector, by screening for clones with reduced susceptibility to imipenem. sequencing of the cloned gene revealed that it encoded a new class b beta-lactamase that was named vim-1. at the sequence level vim-1 was rather divergent from the other class b enzymes (16.4 to 38.7% identity), overall being more similar to members of subclass b1 including the beta-lactamase ii of bacillus cereus (bc-ii), the bacteroides fragilis ccra, the chryseobacterium meningosepticum blab, and the cassette-encoded imp-1 enzymes. among these, vim-1 showed the highest degree of similarity to bc-ii. similarly to blaimp, blavim was also found to be carried on  a gene cassette inserted into a class 1 integron. the blavim-containing integron  was located on the chromosome of p. aeruginosa vr-143/97, and the metallo-beta-lactamase-encoding determinant was not transferable to e. coli by conjugation. expression of the integron-borne blavim gene in e. coli resulted in  a significant decrease in susceptibility to a broad array of beta-lactams (ampicillin, carbenicillin, piperacillin, mezlocillin, cefotaxime, cefoxitin, ceftazidime, cefoperazone, cefepime, and carbapenems), revealing a very broad substrate specificity of the vim-1 enzyme.

TI  == bacterial contamination of ready-to-eat foods and fresh products in retail shops  and food factories.
AB  == raw vegetables cut for salad, cooked salad, cooked rice, boiled noodles, bean curd, and cooked japanese foods were purchased in 27 retail shops in tokyo. intact vegetables before being processed and ready-to-eat fresh salad products were obtained from two food factories located in the suburbs of tokyo. two hundred thirty-eight retail samples, 137 samples of intact vegetables, and 159 samples of fresh products were examined for aerobic plate count (apc), coliforms, escherichia coli, listeria spp., staphylococcus aureus, and bacillus cereus. the  apc of retail foods were 2.1 to 5.7 log cfu/g, and the range for the coliforms was 0.1 to 2.3 log cfu/g. the apc and coliform values showed that the raw vegetables cut for salad were the most heavily contaminated among the six kinds of ready-to-eat foods examined. although l. monocytogenes was not detected, two samples of raw vegetables and five kinds of cooked foods yielded listeria spp. s. aureus was detected in one sample of japanese cooked food. the apc of the intact  vegetables were 2.9 to 7.3 log cfu/g upon arrival and 2.2 to 7.2 log cfu/g after  3 days storage at 10 degrees c. the apc of the fresh products were 3.4 to 7.6 log cfu/g upon arrival and 4.7 to 8.7 log cfu/g after 3 days storage at 10 degrees c. the isolation rates for coliforms were 6.1 to 50% for intact vegetables and 50 to 66.7% for fresh products. e. coli was detected only in the fresh products. b. cereus was isolated from 20.1% (17 of 81) of the intact vegetables and 9.2% (8 of 87) of the fresh products.

TI  == modeling the inhibitory effects of organic acids on bacteria.
AB  == the inhibitory effect of acids on microbial growth has long been used to preserve foods from spoilage. while much of the effect can be accounted for by ph, it is well known that different organic acids vary considerably in their inhibitory effects. because organic acids are not members of a homologous series, but vary in the numbers of carboxy groups, hydroxy groups and carbon-carbon double bonds in the molecule, it has typically not been possible to predict the magnitude, or  in some cases even the direction, of the change in inhibitory effect upon substituting one acid for another or to predict the net result in food systems containing more than one acid. the objective of this investigation was to attempt to construct a mathematical model that would enable such prediction as a function of the physical and chemical properties of organic acids. principal components analysis (pca) was applied to 11 properties for each of 17 acids commonly found in food systems; this resulted in four significant principal components (pcs), presumably representing fundamental properties of the acids and indicating each acid's location along each of these four scales. these properties correspond to polar groups, the number of double bonds, molecular size, and solubility in non-polar solvents. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) for each of eight acids for six test microorganisms were determined at ph 5.25. the mics for each organism were modeled as a function of the four pcs using partial least squares (pls) regression. this produced models with high correlations for five of the bacteria (r2 = 0.856, 0.941, 0.968, 0.968 and 0.970) and one with a slightly lower value (r2 = 0.785). acid susceptible organisms (bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, and alicyclobacillus) exhibited a similar response pattern. there appeared to be two separate response patterns for acid resistant organisms; one was exhibited by the two lactobacilli studied and the other by e. coli. predicting the inhibitory effects of the organic acids as a function of their chemical and physical properties is clearly possible.

TI  == toward functional genomics in bacteria: analysis of gene expression in escherichia coli from a bacterial artificial chromosome library of bacillus cereus.
AB  == as the study of microbes moves into the era of functional genomics, there is an increasing need for molecular tools for analysis of a wide diversity of microorganisms. currently, biological study of many prokaryotes of agricultural,  medical, and fundamental scientific interest is limited by the lack of adequate genetic tools. we report the application of the bacterial artificial chromosome (bac) vector to prokaryotic biology as a powerful approach to address this need.  we constructed a bac library in escherichia coli from genomic dna of the gram-positive bacterium bacillus cereus. this library provides 5.75-fold coverage of the b. cereus genome, with an average insert size of 98 kb. to determine the extent of heterologous expression of b. cereus genes in the library, we screened  it for expression of several b. cereus activities in the e. coli host. clones expressing 6 of 10 activities tested were identified in the library, namely, ampicillin resistance, zwittermicin a resistance, esculin hydrolysis, hemolysis,  orange pigment production, and lecithinase activity. we analyzed selected bac clones genetically to identify rapidly specific b. cereus loci. these results suggest that bac libraries will provide a powerful approach for studying gene expression from diverse prokaryotes.

TI  == mic231, a naturally occurring mobile insertion cassette from bacillus cereus.
AB  == recent dissection of numerous plasmids and transposable elements has given more credence to the modular organization of these genetic and genomic entities. although many variations on each theme exist, the number of basic functional cassettes is thought to be relatively limited. in this paper, a novel type of mobile cassette is described. a naturally occurring assemblage consisting of two  left is231 ends flanking a d-stereospecific endopeptidase (adp) gene was found in several natural isolates of bacillus cereus. this 1.9 kb genetic entity was shown to transpose in the presence of is231a transposase, not only in escherichia coli  but also in bacillus. the acronym mic231 is proposed for this mobile insertion cassette trans-activated (teletransposed) by is231. using (d-phe)4 tetrapeptide as substrate, the endopeptidase activity of the mic231 adp gene could be demonstrated in e. coli and b. subtilis. interestingly, this d-stereospecific endopeptidase activity was not limited to the original b. cereus isolates but was also detected in all but one of the 69 b. cereus sensu lato strains tested, indicating its important, yet dispensable, biological function. however, inactivation of the mic231 adp gene in two b. cereus strains did not result in any detectable variation of their activity on (d-phe)4, suggesting the presence of other distantly related adp gene(s). thus, although the exact role of mic231 adp remains elusive, its presence inside a mobile cassette represents the archetype of a novel insertion sequence modular organization.

AB  == a cdna encoding achacin, an antimicrobial glycoprotein from the body surface mucus of giant african snail achacina fulica ferussac, was expressed in a methylotrophic yeast, pichia pastoris, and recombinant achacin (rach) was secreted in yeast minimal medium in a polyglycosylated form with 80 kda. carbohydrate analysis revealed that the glycosylated moiety of rach was composed  of 50 mol mannose and 2 mol n-acetylglucosamine residues. antimicrobial activity  using escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus showed that the rach had a behavior similar to its native counterpart. the rach showed so wide an antimicrobial spectrum that 0.1 mg/ml rach inhibited the growth of pseudomonas fluorescens, staphylococcus epidermidis, and streptococcus faecalis in addition to e. coli and s. aureus, whereas it did not appreciably affect the growth of proteus mirabilis, bacillus cereus and micrococcus luteus. the rach was also effective in preventing growth of vibrio anguillarum and vibrio parahaemolyticus. the results suggested that the rach had great potential of using as an antimicrobial agent.

AB  == three dipeptide complexes of the form k[pt(iv) (dipep) cl(oh)2] and four dipeptide complexes of the form k[pt(iv)-(hdipep)cl2(oh)2] were newly prepared. the 195 pt nmr peak of the k[pt(iv) (dipep)cl(oh)2] complexes appeared at about 1200 ppm and these chemical shifts were about 3150 ppm downfield compared with those of the k[pt(ii) (dipep) cl] complexes. the chemical shifts of the k[pt(iv)  (hdipep) cl2 (oh)2] complexes were at about 900 ppm, i.e., about 3050 ppm downfield compared with those of the k[pt(ii) (hdipep)cl] complexes. the h[pt(iv) (hdigly) cl2(oh)2] and k[pt(iv) (hdigly) cl2(oh)2] complexes inhibited the growth of c. albicans at a more diluted concentration than cisplatin at 1 microgram/ml,  but the platinum complexes only weakly inhibited the growth of these cells compared with the cisplatin-inhibited growth of meth-a and hep-2 cells at 10 micrograms/ml. these results suggested that the platinum complexes selectively inhibited the growth of fungal cells.

AB  == the role of the non-conserved amino acid residue at position 104 of the class a beta-lactamases, which comprises a highly conserved sequence of amino acids at the active sites of these enzymes, in both the hydrolysis of beta-lactam substrates and inactivation by mechanism-based inhibitors was investigated. site-directed mutagenesis was performed on the penpc gene encoding the bacillus cereus 569/h beta-lactamase i to replace asp104 with the corresponding staphylococcus aureus pc1 residue ala104. kinetic data obtained with the purified asp104ala b. cereus 569/h beta-lactamase i was compared to that obtained from the wild-type b. cereus and s. aureus enzymes. replacement of amino acid residue 104  had little effect on the michaelis parameters for the hydrolysis of both s- and a-type penicillins. relative to wild-type enzyme, the asp104ala beta-lactamase i  had 2-fold higher km values for benzylpenicillin and methicillin, but negligible  difference in km for ampicillin and oxacillin. however, kcat values were also slightly increased resulting in little change in catalytic efficiency, kcat/km. in contrast, the asp104ala beta-lactamase i became more like the s. aureus enzyme in its response to the mechanism-based inhibitors clavulanic acid and 6-beta-(trifluoromethane sulfonyl)amido-penicillanic acid sulfone with respect to both response to the inhibitors and subsequent enzymatic properties. based on the known three-dimensional structures of the bacillus licheniformis 749/c, escherichia coli tem and s. aureus pc1 beta-lactamases, a model for the role of the non-conserved residue at position 104 in the process of inactivation by mechanism-based inhibitors is proposed.

TI  == evaluation of accuracy and repeatability of identification of food-borne pathogens by automated bacterial identification systems.
AB  == the performances of five automated microbial identification systems, relative to  that of a reference identification system, for their ability to accurately and repeatedly identify six common food-borne pathogens were assessed. the systems assessed were the microlog system (biolog inc., hayward, calif.), the microbial identification system (mis; midi inc., newark, del.), the vitek system (biomerieux vitek, hazelwood, mo.), the microscan walkaway 40 system (dade-microscan international, west sacramento, calif.), and the replianalyzer system (oxoid inc., nepean, ontario, canada). the sensitivities and specificities of these systems for the identification of food-borne isolates of bacillus cereus, campylobacter jejuni, listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella spp., and verotoxigenic escherichia coli were determined with 40 reference positive isolates and 40 reference negative isolates for each pathogen. the sensitivities of these systems for the identification of these pathogens ranged from 42.5 to 100%, and the specificities of these systems for the identification of these pathogens ranged from 32.5 to 100%. some of the systems had difficulty correctly identifying the reference isolates when the results were compared to those from the reference identification tests. the sensitivity of mis for the identification of s. aureus, b. cereus, e. coli, and c. jejuni, for example, ranged from 47.5 to 72. 5%. the sensitivity of the microlog system for the identification of e. coli was 72.5%, and the sensitivity of the vitek system  for the identification of b. cereus was 42.5%. the specificities of four of the five systems for the identification of all of the species tested with the available databases were greater than or equal to 97.5%; the exception was mis for the identification of c. jejuni, which displayed a specificity of 32.5% when  it was tested with reference negative isolates including campylobacter coli and other campylobacter species. all systems had >80% sensitivities for the identification of salmonella species and listeria species at the genus level. the repeatability of these systems for the identification of test isolates ranged from 30 to 100%. not all systems included all six pathogens in their databases; thus, some species could not be tested with all systems. the choice of automated  microbial identification system for the identification of a food-borne pathogen would depend on the availability of identification libraries within the systems and the performance of the systems for the identification of the pathogen.

AB  == in the course of structure-activity relationships on rebeccamycin analogues, a series of compounds bearing a halogenoacetyl substituent were synthesized with the expectation of increasing the interaction with dna, possibly via covalent reaction with the double helix. two rebeccamycin analogues bearing an acetyl instead of a bromoacetyl substituent were prepared to gain an insight into the role of the halogen atom. the new compounds show very little effect on protein kinase c and no covalent reaction with dna was detected. however, the drugs behave as typical topoisomerase i poisons, and they are significantly more toxic  toward p388 leukemia cells than to p388/cpt5 cells resistant to camptothecin. the introduction of a bromo- or chloro-acetyl substituent does not affect the capacity of the drug to interfere with topoisomerase i either in vitro or in cells. one of the bromoacetyl derivatives, compound 8, is the most cytotoxic rebeccamycin derivative among the hundred of derivatives we have synthesized to date. in addition, we determined the antimicrobial activities against two gram-positive bacteria, bacillus cereus and streptomyces chartreusis, and against the gram-negative bacterium escherichia coli. the effect of the drugs on candida  albicans yeast growth and their anti-hiv-1 activities were also measured.

TI  == innate immunity in insects: the role of multiple, endogenous serum lectins in the recognition of foreign invaders in the cockroach, blaberus discoidalis.
AB  == unlike vertebrates, insects do not have an ab-based nonself recognition system, and must rely totally on innate immunity to defend themselves from microbial invaders. the most likely candidates for recognizing foreign material in insects  are the lectins, which have already been shown to be important in mammalian innate immunity. the hemolymph of the cockroach, blaberus discoidalis, contains multiple lectins, designated bdl1, bdl2, bdl3, and gsl (beta-1,3-glucan-specific  lectin), two of which, namely bdl1 and gsl, have close similarities to acute phase reactants. these endogenous molecules, as well as con a, wheat germ agglutinin, and helix pomatia agglutinin, have been shown to induce an enhanced phagocytic response by b. discoidalis plasmatocytes. this effect is related to the carbohydrates presented on the surface of the microorganism and to the sugar  specificities of the lectins. thus, the mannose-specific lectins, bdl1 and con a, both increase the phagocytosis of baker's yeast and escherichia coli, whereas the n-acetyl-d-glucosamine/n-acetyl-d-galactosamine-specific lectins, bdl2, wheat germ agglutinin, and h. pomatia agglutinin, induce the phagocytosis of bacillus cereus and e. coli. gsl, specific for beta-1,3-glucan, and the n-acetyl-d-galactosamine-specific bdl3, only enhance the phagocytosis of yeast and b. cereus, respectively. phenylthiourea, an inhibitor of the prophenoloxidase system, caused either total, partial, or no inhibition of the lectin-induced increase in phagocytosis, indicating that this immune enhancement results, in some cases, from at least two closely linked mechanisms. these results show that  the endogenous lectins in the cockroach hemolymph are capable of acting as nonself recognition molecules for a wide range of microorganisms, and thus obviate the necessity of abs in these animals.

AB  == resistance of bacteria to antibiotics is an increasing problem in many countries. accurate locally relevant information is essential for detection and control of emerging resistance and to facilitate choice of empirical antibiotic therapy in the immediate management of seriously ill patients. we have determined the minimum inhibitory concentration of piperacillin/tazobactam for 97 strains of bacteria (55 enterobacteriaceae, 13 non-fermentative gram-negative bacilli, 22 staphylococcus aureus, 6 enterococcus faecalis and 1 bacillus cereus) isolated from blood cultures and compared its activity to that of amoxycillin, co-amoxiclav, cephalothin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, piperacillin, cefotaxime. the strains were consecutive non-fastidious isolates with the following qualifications: coagulase negative staphylococci and diphtheroids were excluded and the number of staphylococcus aureus isolates was limited to 12 methicillin-resistant and 10 methicillin-sensitive strains. multiple isolates of the same species from individual patients were not included. the minimum inhibition concentrations of methicillin, penicillin, teichoplanin and vancomycin were also determined for specific groups of organisms. mics were determined by the etest method (ab biodisk, solna, sweden) on mueller hinton agar. the mics of appropriate american type culture collection control strains were determined. based on the interpretative criteria of the national committee for clinical laboratory standards (usa), 87 per cent of gram-negative bacilli were susceptible to piperacillin/tazobactam compared with amoxycillin 26 per cent, cephalothin 35 per cent, co-amoxiclav 54 per cent, piperacillin 56 per cent, cefotaxime 69 per cent, ceftazidime 84 per cent, gentamicin 85 per cent and ciprofloxacin 91 per cent. of all isolates 75 per cent were sensitive to piperacillin/tazobactam, compared with amoxycillin 22 per cent, cephalothin 35 per cent, piperacillin 41 per cent, co-amoxiclav 52 per cent, cefotaxime 59 per cent, ceftazidime 60 per cent, gentamicin 74 per cent and ciprofloxacin 77 per cent. two isolates (1 e. coli and 1 klebsiella pneumoniae) with antibiograms consistent with the relatively new resistance phenomenon of extended spectrum beta-lactamase production were identified. the spectrum of activity of piperacillin-tazobactam for empirical antibiotic therapy is significantly greater than that of piperacillin alone and is similar to that of ciprofloxacin and gentamicin.

AB  == the microbiological quality of 1,012 hot meals served on aircraft was studied in  1991 to 1994. the material included dishes prepared in 33 countries all over the  world. the geometric means of aerobic colony counts and escherichia coli were significantly lower in breakfasts (p < 0.05) than in main dishes. pathogenic bacteria were found in 30 samples (3.0%), bacillus cereus being the most common pathogen. the frequencies of b. cereus and staphylococcus aureus did not differ between breakfasts and main dishes. many of the samples exceeded the minimum acceptable microbiological standards recommended by the association of european airlines (aea) for e. coli, s. aureus, b. cereus, clostridium perfringens, and salmonella; i.e., 8.2%, 0.6%, 0.7%, 0.7% and 0.3%, respectively. there were considerable differences in aerobic colony counts and e. coli counts between countries where the food was prepared.

TI  == biologically active polymers: synthesis and antimicrobial activity of modified glycidyl methacrylate polymers having a quaternary ammonium and phosphonium groups.
AB  == polymers with antibacterial activity have been synthesized by chemical modification of poly(glycidyl methacrylate). the glycidyl methacrylate was polymerized by the free radical polymerization technique. the poly(glycidyl methacrylate) was hydrolyzed and was chloroacetylated using chloroacetyl chloride. the chloroacetylated product was modified to yield polymers with either quaternary ammonium or phosphonium salts. the antimicrobial activity of the modified glycidyl methacrylate polymers has been examined against a variety of test microorganisms by the cut plug and the viable cell counting methods using shake flask of ten times diluted nutrient broth medium. all three polymers obtained were inhibitory to the growth of gram negative bacteria (escherichia coli, pseudomones aeruginosa, shigella sp. and salmonella typhae) and gram positive bacteria (bacillus subtilis and b. cereus) as well as the fungus (trichophytun rubrum). it was found that the growth inhibitory effect varied according to the structure of the polymer and the composition of the active group and increased with increasing the concentration of the polymer. the tested polymers showed more antimicrobial activity against gram negative bacteria and the fungus, whereas were less active against gram positive bacteria.

TI  == spectroscopic characterization of a binuclear metal site in bacillus cereus beta-lactamase ii.
AB  == the zinc metalloenzyme beta-lactamase ii (betalii) from bacillus cereus has been  overexpressed in escherichia coli as a fusion protein with glutathione-s-transferase, and the metal binding properties of recombinant betalii toward zn(ii) and co(ii) have been studied by fluorescence and activity measurements. the apoenzyme is able to bind two metal ion equivalents, which confer on betalii its maximum enzymatic efficiency. the enzyme is partially active with one metal ion equivalent. the dico(ii) and a mixed zn(ii)co(ii) derivative of betalii were obtained and probed by electronic and paramagnetic nmr spectroscopy. in the high-affinity site, the metal is bound to three his residues and a solvent molecule, adopting a tetrahedral geometry. a cys, a his, and an asp residue are coordinated to the low-affinity metal site, together with two or three solvent molecules. this coordination polyhedron resembles the binuclear metal site of the bacteroides fragilis beta-lactamase [concha, n., rasmussen, b.  a., bush, k., and herzberg, o. (1996) structure 4, 823-836; carfi, a., duee, e.,  paul-soto, r., galleni, m., frere, j. m., and dideberg, o.

(1995) embo j. 14, 4914-4921]. these results suggest that this binuclear metal site may be a general feature of metallo-beta-lactamases.

TI  == insights into the mechanism of catalysis by the p-c bond-cleaving enzyme phosphonoacetaldehyde hydrolase derived from gene sequence analysis and mutagenesis.
AB  == phosphonoacetaldehyde hydrolase (phosphonatase) catalyzes the hydrolysis of phosphonoacetaldehyde to acetaldehyde and inorganic phosphate. in this study, the genes encoding phosphonatase in bacillus cereus and in salmonella typhimurium were cloned for high-level expression in escherichia coli. the kinetic properties of the purified, recombinant phosphonatases were determined. the schiff base mechanism known to operate in the b. cereus enzyme was verified for the s. typhimurium enzyme by phosphonoacetaldehyde-sodium borohydride-induced inactivation and by site-directed mutagenesis of the catalytic lysine 53. the protein sequence inferred from the b. cereus phosphonatase gene was determined, and this sequence was used along with that from the s. typhimurium phosphonatase  gene sequence to search the primary sequence databases for possible structural homologues. we found that phosphonatase belongs to a novel family of hydrolases which appear to use a highly conserved active site aspartate residue in covalent  catalysis. on the basis of this finding and the known stereochemical course of phosphonatase-catalyzed hydrolysis at phosphorus (retention), we propose a mechanism which involves schiff base formation with lysine 53 followed by phosphoryl transfer to aspartate (at position 11 in the s. typhimurium enzyme and position 12 in the b. cereusphosphonatase) and last hydrolysis at the imine c(1)  and acyl phosphate phosphorus.

TI  == development of a streptavidin-conjugated single-chain antibody that binds bacillus cereus spores.
AB  == control of microorganisms such as bacillus cereus spores is critical to ensure the safety and a long shelf life of foods. a bifunctional single chain antibody has been developed for detection and binding of b. cereus t spores. the genes that encode b. cereus t spore single-chain antibody and streptavidin were connected for use in immunoassays and immobilization of the recombinant antibodies. a truncated streptavidin, which is smaller than but has biotin binding ability similar to that of streptavidin, was used as the affinity domain  because of its high and specific affinity with biotin. the fusion protein gene was expressed in escherichia coli bl21 (de3) with the t7 rna polymerase-t7 promoter expression system. immunoblotting revealed an antigen specificity similar to that of its parent native monoclonal antibody. the single-chain antibody-streptavidin fusion protein can be used in an immunoassay of b. cereus spores by applying a biotinylated enzyme detection system. the recombinant antibodies were immobilized on biotinylated magnetic beads by taking advantage of the strong biotin-streptavidin affinity. various liquids were artificially contaminated with 5 x 10(4) b. cereus spores per ml. greater than 90% of the b. cereus spores in phosphate buffer or 37% of the spores in whole milk were tightly bound and removed from the liquid phase by the immunomagnetic beads.

AB  == the variable-region genes of monoclonal antibody against bacillus cereus spores were cloned from mouse hybridoma cells by reverse transcription-pcr. the heavy- and light-chain variable-region genes were connected by a 45-base linker dna to allow folding of the fusion protein into a functional tertiary structure. for detection of protein expression, a 10-amino-acid strep tag (biotin-like peptide)  was attached to the c terminus of recombinant antibody as the reporter peptide. the single-chain antibody construct was inserted into the expression vector and expressed in escherichia coli under the control of the t7 rna polymerase-t7 promoter expression system. the expressed single-chain antibody was detected on western blots by using a streptavidin-conjugated enzyme system. this small recombinant antibody fragment (ca. 28,000 da by calculation) had b. cereus spore  binding ability and antigen specificity similar to those of its parent native monoclonal antibody.

TI  == target range of zwittermicin a, an aminopolyol antibiotic from bacillus cereus.
AB  == zwittermicin a is a novel antibiotic produced by bacillus cereus uw85, which suppresses certain plant diseases in the laboratory and in the field. we developed a rapid method for large-scale purification of zwittermicin a and then  studied the in vitro activity of zwittermicin a against bacteria, fungi, and protists. zwittermicin a was highly active against the oomycetes and their relatives, the algal protists, and had moderate activity against diverse gram-negative bacteria and certain gram-positive bacteria as well as against a wide range of plant pathogenic fungi. zwittermicin a was more active against bacteria and fungi at ph 7-8 than at ph 5-6. when zwittermicin a was combined with kanosamine, another antibiotic produced by b. cereus, the two acted synergistically against escherichia coli and additively against phytophthora medicaginis, an oomycete. the results indicate that there are diverse potential applications of this new class of antibiotic.

TI  == studying the effect of temperature on microbial growth using multiplicative model.
AB  == the specific growth rates of brochothrix thermosphacta, listeria monocytogenes, yersinia enterocolitica, bacillus cereus, escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella spp., staphylococcus aureus and clostridium perfringens at various temperatures were taken from the food micromodel database, and the data sets of specific growth rate versus temperature were fitted using the multiplicative model (r = a  td, r = specific growth rate; t = temperature; a, d = regression parameters). the exponential d-value derived from microbial growth at suboptimum temperatures reflected the effectiveness of temperature in enhancing growth. a microorganism with a large d-value exhibited a large increment of growth rate as temperature increased. the d-value of a microorganism was related to the temperature range for growth. the temperature range for the growth of psychrotrophs was usually narrow for b. thermosphacta and y. enterocolitica; hence the d-values of these two psychrotrophs were close to 1 whereas d-values of mesophiles, such as b. cereus, e. coli o157:h7, salmonella spp., and s. aureus, were 2.31-2.90, and the  d-value of c. perfringens, a thermophile, was 3.29. the values of parameter a of  the model were affected by extra salt added into cultures. for all the strains mentioned above, the a-values decreased when the cultures contained higher levels of salt. the lowering of the a-value implied that the influence of temperature on the growth rate in the model was reduced. the change of the d-value was dependent on the capability of the microorganism to overcome the obstacle to growth and was affected by the composition of the nutrients and by inhibitory factors in the culture. the influence of environmental factors on the d-value was also found in  chinese sausages. the d-value of a dominant spoilage strain of enterococcus sp. derived from sausages was 0.833 whereas the d-value derived from mrs cultures was 2.36. in refrigerated foods which usually contained some preservatives and were stored at low temperature, the d-value of psychrotrophic spoilage bacteria was around 1. in this case, the linear model could be a reasonable choice for predicting the proliferation of spoilage bacteria.

AB  == a series of 10 indolocarbazole derivatives, analogues to the antitumor antibiotic rebeccamycin, bearing modifications at the imide heterocycle were synthesized. they bear an n-methyl imide, n-methyl amide, or anhydride function instead of the original imide. their inhibitory potencies toward topoisomerase i were examined using a dna relaxation assay and by analyzing the drug-induced cleavage of 32p-labeled dna. protein kinase c (pkc) inhibition and interaction with dna were  also studied together with the in vitro antiproliferative activities against b16  melanoma and p388 leukemia cells. the antimicrobial activities against two gram-positive bacteria (bacillus cereus and streptomyces chartreusis), a gram-negative bacterium (escherichia coli), and a yeast (candida albicans) were tested as well as their antiviral activities toward hiv-1. the efficiency of the  anhydride compounds was compared to that of the parent compound rebeccamycin and  its dechlorinated analogue. all the compounds studied were inactive against pkc.  the structural requirements for pkc and topoisomerase i inhibition are markedly different. in sharp contrast with the structure-pkc inhibition relationships, we  found that an anhydride function does not affect topoisomerase i inhibition, whereas a methyl group on the indole nitrogen prevents the poisoning of topoisomerase i. the compounds exhibiting a marked toxicity to p388 leukemia cells had little or no effect on the growth of p388cpt5 cells which are resistant to the topoisomerase i inhibitor camptothecin. this study reinforces the conclusion that the dna-topoisomerase i cleavable complex is the primary cellular target of the indolocarbazoles and significantly contributes to their cytotoxicity and possibly to their weak but noticeable anti-hiv-1 activities. the structure-activity relationships are also discussed.

TI  == general base catalysis by the phosphatidylcholine-preferring phospholipase c from bacillus cereus: the role of glu4 and asp55.
AB  == to assess what roles the active site residues glu4 and asp55 of the phosphatidylcholine-preferring phospholipase c of bacillus cereus (plcbc) might play in binding and catalysis, selected mutants were prepared through site-directed mutagenesis of the plc gene. the mutants were then expressed in escherichia coli and purified as fusion proteins with the maltose binding protein (mbp). kinetic analysis showed that mutations at glu4 had only modest effects on  the catalytic activity, whereas those at asp55 led to proteins whose values for kcat/km were 10(4)-10(6) times less than that of the wild-type enzyme. the modest decrease in catalytic activity and the ph-dependent profile of the e4l mutant strongly suggest that glutamic acid at position 4 is not the general base in the  plcbc-catalyzed reaction. rather, the results support the hypothesis that glu4 is primarily involved in substrate binding, perhaps by electrostatic stabilization of the positive charge of the choline moiety of the phosphatidylcholine substrate. examination of x-ray crystallographic data of plcbc and its various complexes reveals that the carboxylate side chain of asp55 is positioned such that it could activate a water for nucleophilic attack on the substrate or serve  as a ligand for zn1. however, the involvement of the side chain of asp55 as an important zn1 ligand is not consistent with the atomic absorption and thermostability data obtained for the d55l mutant, which are virtually identical  with that of the wild-type enzyme. the large reduction in the measured kcat/km of the d55e, d55n, and d55l mutants of plcbc indicates that asp55 plays a critical role in catalysis and likely serves as the general base in the hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine by plcbc.

TI  == a cysteine-dependent serine protease associated with the dormant spores of bacillus cereus: purification of the protein and cloning of the corresponding gene.
AB  == subtilisin-like serine protease, which is associated with the dormant spores of bacillus cereus, was solubilized by washing the spores with 2 m kcl and purified  to homogeneity by carbobenzoxy-d-phenylalanine-liganded affinity column chromatography and hydrophobic interaction column chromatography. enzyme activity was completely inhibited by reagents for sulfhydryl groups such as hgcl2 as well  as by conventional subtilisin inhibitors, suggesting the enzyme to be cysteine-dependent. the enzyme retained activity in 5 m urea at 4 degrees c for at least 2 months, and the specific activity was 50 times that of subtilisin bpn  when measured for a common chromogenic substrate, carbobenzoxy-glycyl-glycyl-l-leucine p-nitroanilide. the gene encoding this protease was cloned in escherichia coli, and its nucleotide sequence was analyzed. the deduced amino acid sequence suggested that the protease is produced as a precursor comprising three portions; a signal sequence (28 amino acid residues), a prosequence (80 amino acid residues) and a mature enzyme (289 amino  acid residues). the mature region of the enzyme had high similarity with a thermitase from thermoactinomyces vulgaris (72% identity) and a thermostable alkaline protease from thermoactinomyces sp. e79 (66% identity), which have the n-terminal sequence showing scarcely noticeable similarity with corresponding stretches of subtilisins and mercuric ion-sensitive free cysteine in the equivalent position of the primary structure.

TI  == crystal structure of the phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase c from the human pathogen listeria monocytogenes.
AB  == the x-ray crystal structure of the phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase c  (pi-plc) from the human pathogen listeria monocytogenes has been determined both  in free form at 2.0 a resolution, and in complex with the competitive inhibitor myo-inositol at 2.6 a resolution. the structure was solved by a combination of molecular replacement using the structure of bacillus cereus pi-plc and single isomorphous replacement. the enzyme consists of a single (beta alpha)8-barrel domain with the active site located at the c-terminal side of the beta-barrel. unlike other (beta alpha)8-barrels, the barrel in pi-plc is open because it lacks hydrogen bonding interactions between beta-strands v and vi. myo-inositol binds to the active site pocket by making specific hydrogen bonding interactions with a number of charged amino acid side-chains as well as a coplanar stacking interaction with a tyrosine residue. despite a relatively low sequence identity of approximately 24%, the structure is highly homologous to that of b.cereus pi-plc with an r.m.s. deviation for 228 common c alpha positions of 1.46 a. larger differences are found for loop regions that accommodate most of the numerous amino acid insertions and deletions. the active site pocket is also well conserved with only two amino acid replacements directly implicated in inositol binding.

AB  == in the past decade, outbreaks of human illness associated with the consumption of raw vegetables and fruits (or unpasteurized products produced from them) have increased in the united states. changes in agronomic, harvesting, distribution, processing, and consumption patterns and practices have undoubtedly contributed to this increase. pathogens such as listeria monocytogenes, clostridium botulinum, and bacillus cereus are naturally present in some soil, and their presence on fresh produce is not rare. salmonella, escherichia coli o157:h7, campylobacter jejuni, vibrio cholerae, parasites, and viruses are more likely to  contaminate fresh produce through vehicles such as raw or improperly composted manure, irrigation water containing untreated sewage, or contaminated wash water. contact with mammals, reptiles, fowl, insects, and unpasteurized products of animal origin offers another avenue through which pathogens can access produce. surfaces, including human hands, which come in contact with whole or cut produce  represent potential points of contamination throughout the total system of growing, harvesting, packing, processing, shipping, and preparing produce for consumption. treatment of produce with chlorinated water reduces populations of pathogenic and other microorganisms on fresh produce but cannot eliminate them. reduction of risk for human illness associated with raw produce can be better achieved through controlling points of potential contamination in the field; during harvesting; during processing or distribution; or in retail markets, food-service facilities, or the home.

AB  == for many of the enzymes that utilize or produce diacylglycerols, detergent mixed  micelles are often used in assay systems to solubilize the lipophilic substrates  or products. the assumption is often made that the diacylglycerol (dag) is solubilized and well mixed throughout the population of micelles during the time  course of the assay. in the present work the partitioning and exchange dynamics of diacylglycerols (from dihexanoyl-dag to didecanoyl-dag) in a variety of detergent micelles have been studied by nmr and fluorescence methods. in all detergents, the longer the dag chain lengths, the more detergent is required for  solubilization. however, efficiency of solubilization varies tremendously with triton x-100 the most efficient (i.e. the least detergent is required), and deoxycholate the least efficient in solubilizing dag. the mixing and exchange dynamics of pyrene-labeled dag molecules in these micelles (measured by stopped-flow fluorescence) were fastest for triton x-100 and slowest with charged bile salt micelles. of the detergent systems characterized, triton x-100 appears  to be the optimal detergent for use in assays of enzymes that interact with dag (beta-octylglucoside and diheptanoylphosphatidylcholine have good exchange dynamics, but higher amounts of these detergents are needed to solubilize dag). bile salt micelles provide the least solubilization and the slowest exchange kinetics (so slow that this could be a significant problem in some enzyme assays). this information on dag behavior in micelles is discussed with respect to assays of an enzyme that generates dag as product (phospholipase c) and one that uses dag as substrate (dag kinase). although slow exchange of dag occurs in  some micelle systems, this does not appear to be a rate-limiting step in the kinetics for either of these enzymes.

TI  == a xanthanolide with potent antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == this study was conducted to find constituents of an annual herb, xanthium sibiricum patr er widd, with effective antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa). by monitoring antibacterial activity against mrsa strains, it was shown that a sesquiterpene lactone, identified as [3ar-(3a alpha, 7 beta,8a beta)]-3,3a,4,7,8,8a-hexahydro-7- methyl-3-methylene-6-(3-oxo-1-butenyl)-2h-cyclohepta[b]furan-2-one, or xanthatin, isolated from leaves of the herb, had outstandingly potent activity against s. aureus species, including mrsa; its activity against mrsa and mssa strains was similar. other bacteria, e.g. staphylococcus epidermidis, klebsiella pneumoniae,  bacillus cereus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella typhi, were also susceptible at the concentrations tested but the compound had no inhibitory effect on some other bacteria, including escherichia coli. the results show that  xanthatin has outstandingly potent activity against strains of s. aureus but that the activity of the compound is highly species-specific.

TI  == syntheses and biological activities (topoisomerase inhibition and antitumor and antimicrobial properties) of rebeccamycin analogues bearing modified sugar moieties and substituted on the imide nitrogen with a methyl group.
AB  == as a part of studies on structure-activity relationships, several potential topoisomerase i inhibitors were prepared. different analogues of the antitumor antibiotic rebeccamycin substituted on the imide nitrogen with a methyl group were synthesized. these compounds bore either the sugar residue of rebeccamycin,  with or without the chlorine atoms on the indole moieties, or modified sugar residues (galactopyranosyl, glucopyranosyl, or fucopyranosyl) linked to the aglycone via a beta- or alpha-n-glycosidic bond. their inhibitory properties toward protein kinase c, topoisomerase i, and topoisomerase ii were examined, and their dna-binding properties were investigated. their in vitro antitumor activities against murine b16 melanoma and p388 leukemia cells were determined. their antimicrobial activities were tested against gram-positive bacteria bacillus cereus and streptomyces chartreusis, gram-negative bacterium escherichia coli, and yeast candida albicans. these compounds are inactive toward topoisomerase ii but inhibit topoisomerase i. a substitution with a methyl group  on the imide nitrogen led to a loss of proteine kinase c inhibition in the maleimide indolocarbazole series but did not prevent topoisomerase i inhibition.  compounds possessing a beta-n-glycosidic bond, which fully intercalated into dna, were more efficient at inhibiting topoisomerase i than their analogues with an alpha-n-glycosidic bond; however, both were equally toxic toward p388 leukemia cells. dechlorinated rebeccamycin possessing a methyl group on the imide nitrogen was about 10 times more efficient in terms of cytotoxicity and inhibition of topoisomerase i than the natural metabolite.

TI  == meat from dairy cows: possible microbiological hazards and risks.
AB  == the authors provide an overview of the circumstances associated with culling of dairy cattle in the united states of america (usa) and focus on the possible significant microbiological hazards associated with meat from cull dairy cows. cull dairy cows are an important source of food in the usa, accounting for at least approximately 17% of ground beef. the potential microbiological hazards for foodborne illness from cull dairy cows discussed here include salmonella (with special attention to s. typhimurium dt104), escherichia coli o157:h7, campylobacter jejuni, listeria monocytogenes, clostridium perfringens and staphylococcus aureus. possible sources and means of contamination are pointed out, as are the potential foodborne risks from bacillus cereus and aeromonas spp. in conclusion, widespread microbiological studies are needed to determine the prevalence and risk of foodborne pathogens in cull dairy cattle.

TI  == comparative sensitivity of 13 species of pathogenic bacteria to seven chemical germicides.
AB  == background: the relative resistance of diverse human bacterial pathogens to commonly used germicidal agents has not been established. methods: we measured by titration the survival of thirteen different bacteria after exposure to glutaraldehyde, formaldehyde, hydrogen peroxide, peracetic acid, cupric ascorbate, sodium hypochlorite, or phenol. results: our comparative experiments allowed classification of the organisms' survival into four groups: (a) pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus showed the most resistance, (b)  clostridium perfringens, salmonella typhimurium, staphylococcus epidermidis, and  escherichia coli o157:h7 showed intermediate resistance, (c) listeria monocytogenes, shigella sonnei, and vibrio parahaemolyticus survived some treatments with chemical agents only in the presence of protecting protein (serum albumin), and (d) vibrio cholerae, vibrio vulnificus, bacillus cereus, and yersinia enterocolitica did not survive any of the treatments applied. conclusion: we found species that more frequently survived exposure to germicidal agents were also those most commonly reported in association with hospital infections. our findings suggest that resistance to disinfectants may be more important than pathogenicity in determining the relative prominence of an organism as an agent responsible for nosocomial infections.

TI  == cloning, overexpression, refolding, and purification of the nonspecific phospholipase c from bacillus cereus.
AB  == bacillus cereus secretes a nonspecific phospholipase c (plc) that catalyzes the hydrolysis of phospholipids to yield diacylglycerol and a phosphate monoester. b. cereus plc has been overexpressed with its signal sequence in escherichia coli using a t7 expression system. the expressed enzyme formed intracellular inclusion bodies which were solubilized in the presence of 8 m urea. renaturation was initiated by gradual removal of urea and addition of zinc ions. the signal peptide was specifically cleaved by a protease, clostripain, added when the urea  concentration was 1.5 m. factors that led to protein reaggregation included rapid removal of urea, use of tris instead of barbital buffer, and presence of the signal peptide when the urea concentration was below 1.5 m. the folded protein was purified by q-sepharose fast flow chromatography to yield a preparation > 99% pure. the final yield of active enzyme was 30-40 mg per liter of culture. the recombinant plc exhibited biochemical and kinetic properties identical to those of extracellularly produced plc from b. cereus. site-specific mutagenesis of asn-134 was carried out as a test of the general effectiveness of the refolding procedure.

TI  == nucleotide sequence and characterization of the cryptic bacillus thuringiensis plasmid pgi3 reveal a new family of rolling circle replicons.
AB  == the complete nucleotide sequence of plasmid pgi3 from bacillus thuringiensis subsp. thuringiensis h1.1. was obtained. although this 11,365-bp molecule contained at least 11 putative open reading frames (orfs), extensive database searches did not reveal any homologous sequences with the exception of orf6, which displayed similarity to the largest orf of pstk1, a 1,883-bp cryptic plasmid isolated from bacillus stearothermophilus. deletion analysis to determine the pgi3 minimal replicon revealed that orf6 is the rep gene. replication occurred via a single-stranded dna (ssdna) intermediate, as demonstrated by s1 treatment and southern hybridization in nondenaturating conditions. interestingly, however, no homology was found between the pgi3 (orf6) and pstk1 (orf3) rep genes and those from other single-stranded dna plasmids, nor was there any dna similarity to the double-strand origins of replication characterized so far, indicating that pgi3 and pstk1 form another, new family of ssdna plasmids. pcr analysis revealed that the pgi3 rep gene is largely distributed among b. thuringiensis strains but can also be found in b. cereus and b. mycoides strains, albeit at a lower frequency. finally, segregation experiments performed with b. subtilis and b. thuringiensis showed that the pgi3 derivatives, including the minimal replicon, were segregationally stable at temperatures suitable for b. thuringiensis growth (<43 degrees c).

TI  == neutralization of hemolytic and mouse lethal activities of c. perfringens alpha-toxin need simultaneous blockade of two epitopes by monoclonal antibodies.
AB  == three murine monoclonal antibodies (mabs 3b4, 1e8, 1f9) were produced by fusion of x63-ag8.653 myeloma cells and splenocytes of mice immunized with glutaraldehyde-inactivated alpha-toxin of clostridium perfringens. all mabs belonged to the immunoglobulin g (igg) class and possessed a kappa light chain. all the mabs were specific for alpha-toxin of c. perfringens as demonstrated by immunoblotting experiments performed with culture supernatants of c. perfringens, c. bifermentans, c. sordellii, and bacillus cereus. competition analysis in an elisa revealed that the mabs recognized different epitopes on the alpha-toxin molecule. in an immunoblot assay based on a recombinant protein expressed in escherichia coli, the binding site of mab 1e8 but not those of mabs 3b4 and 1 f9  were mapped to the cooh-terminal fragment of alpha-toxin (aa 248-370). to prove the neutralizing potential of the mabs, alpha-toxin was preincubated with mabs and subsequently tested for its lecithinase activity in an egg yolk diffusion turbidity (eydt) assay, its hemolytic activity in a hemolysis test, and its lethal effect on mice after intraperitoneally administration. when the mabs were  tested individually, neutralization was only seen in the eydt assay, where mab 3b4 completely abolished the lecithinase activity of alpha toxin. however, when mabs 3b4 and 1 e8 were used in combination, they acted synergistically and inhibited the lysis of rabbit erythrocytes in vitro. the same mixture of mabs was also able to completely neutralize the lethal effect of three ld50 of alpha-toxin on balb/c mice. our results suggest that the alpha-toxin molecule contains several domains which are differently involved in the various activities of the toxin. we conclude that the hemolytic domain(s) of alpha-toxin is (are) identical with or very closely located to the domain(s) that cause the mouse lethal effect. the lecithinase activity may be involved in the mechanisms of hemolysis and mouse lethality but appears not to be the only determinant.

TI  == bacterial viability and antibiotic susceptibility testing with sytox green nucleic acid stain.
AB  == a fluorescent nucleic acid stain that does not penetrate living cells was used to assess the integrity of the plasma membranes of bacteria. sytox green nucleic acid stain is an unsymmetrical cyanine dye with three positive charges that is completely excluded from live eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells. binding of sytox  green stain to nucleic acids resulted in a > 500-fold enhancement in fluorescence emission (absorption and emission maxima at 502 and 523 nm, respectively), rendering bacteria with compromised plasma membranes brightly green fluorescent.  sytox green stain is readily excited by the 488-nm line of the argon ion laser. the fluorescence signal from membrane-compromised bacteria labeled with sytox green stain was typically > 10-fold brighter than that from intact organisms. bacterial suspensions labeled with sytox green stain emitted green fluorescence in proportion to the fraction of permeabilized cells in the population, which was quantified by microscopy, fluorometry, or flow cytometry. flow cytometric and fluorometric approaches were used to quantify the effect of beta-lactam antibiotics on the cell membrane integrity of escherichia coli. detection and discrimination of live and permeabilized cells labeled with sytox green stain by  flow cytometry were markedly improved over those by propidium iodide-based tests. these studies showed that bacterial labeling with sytox green stain is an effective alternative to conventional methods for measuring bacterial viability and antibiotic susceptibility.

TI  == three bacillus cereus bacteriophage endolysins are unrelated but reveal high homology to cell wall hydrolases from different bacilli.
AB  == the ply genes encoding the endolysin proteins from bacillus cereus phages bastille, tp21, and 12826 were identified, cloned, and sequenced. the endolysins  could be overproduced in escherichia coli (up to 20% of total cellular protein),  and the recombinant proteins were purified by a two-step chromatographical procedure. all three enzymes induced rapid and specific lysis of viable cells of  several bacillus species, with highest activity on b. cereus and b. thuringiensis. ply12 and ply21 were experimentally shown to be n-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidases (ec 3.5.1.28). no apparent holin genes were found adjacent to the ply genes. however, ply21 may be endowed with a signal peptide which could play a role in timing of cell lysis by the cytoplasmic phage  endolysin. the individual lytic enzymes (plyba, 41.1 kda; ply21, 29.5 kda, ply12, 27.7 kda) show remarkable heterogeneity, i.e., their amino acid sequences reveal  only little homology. the n-terminal part of ply21 was found to be almost identical to the catalytic domains of a bacillus sp. cell wall hydrolase (cwlsp)  and an autolysin of b. subtilis (cwla). the c terminus of plyba contains a 77-amino-acid sequence repeat which is also homologous to the binding domain of cwlsp. ply12 shows homology to the major autolysins from b. subtilis and e. coli. comparison with database sequences indicated a modular organization of the phage  lysis proteins where the enzymatic activity is located in the n-terminal region and the c-termini are responsible for specific recognition and binding of bacillus peptidoglycan. we speculate that the close relationship of the phage enzymes and cell wall autolysins is based upon horizontal gene transfer among different bacillus phages and their hosts.

TI  == intracellular transport and processing of protein toxins produced by enteric bacteria.
AB  == bacterial toxins are associated with disease in humans and animals. toxins can either be preformed in food or produced by bacteria in the intestine. there are two types of toxins: heat-labile protein toxins and heat stabile toxins. heat labile toxins are produced by bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens, escherichia coli, and vibrio cholerae, and heat-stabile enterotoxins consisting of relatively few amino acids are produced by escherichia coli and acts by activation of guanylate cyclase. similarly, heat-stabile entero-toxins are also produced by staphylococcus aureus, a common cause of food poisoning in the united states, and yersenia enterocolitica. protein toxins produced by enteric bacteria  can intoxicate intestinal cells and can also be taken up from the gut and reach other cells in the body. for example the shiga-like toxins (vero-toxins) can intoxicate endothelial cells in the kidney and cause kidney failure. intracellular transport and processing of a few of the protein toxins produced by enteric bacteria, namely clostridium difficile toxin a and b, cholera toxin and the related heat-labile toxin produced by escherichia coli, and shiga toxin and shiga-like toxins are presented.

AB  == in a spontaneous mutant (pym1) of bacillus cereus impaired in the synthesis of haem a, no haem-a-containing cytochromes were detected spectroscopically. the haem a deficiency was compensated by high levels of haem o and a co-reactive cytochrome o in membranes; no other oxidases were detected. in contrast, the wild-type strain had considerable amounts of haem a and negligible levels of haem o. the mutant pym1 exhibited normal colony morphology, growth, and sporulation in nonfermentable media, whereas on fermentable media, the mutant overproduced acid, which led to poor growth and inhibition of sporulation. external control of the ph of the medium in fermentable media allowed close-to-normal growth and massive  sporulation of the mutant. the presence of membrane-bound cytochrome caa3-oii and aa3-ii subunits in strain pym1 was confirmed by western blots and haem c staining (coii subunit). western blotting also revealed that in contrast to the wild-type  - strain pym1 contained the membrane-bound subunits caa3-coi and aa3-i, but in low amounts. the effect of several respiratory inhibitors on the respiratory system of strain pym1 suggested that the terminal oxidase is highly resistant to  kcn and co and that a c-type cytochrome might be involved in the electron transfer sequence to the putative cytochrome bo.

TI  == evaluation of swirling, ph, and glucose tests for the detection of bacterial contamination in platelet concentrates.
AB  == background: although infrequent, episodes of transfusion-associated bacterial sepsis may lead to serious outcomes or death and therefore are of concern. this study evaluates the sensitivity of three surrogate tests for the presence of bacteria in platelet concentrates: cessation of swirling, low extracellular ph, and low plasma glucose levels. study design and methods: day 0 platelet concentrates were inoculated with low levels of one of seven bacterial strains and stored with agitation at 20 to 24 degrees c for up to 5 days. in the morning  and afternoon of each day of storage, bacterial levels were ascertained by quantitative plate culture, and platelet concentrates were tested for platelet ph, plasma glucose, and swirling. quantitative and semiquantitative dipstick techniques were used to determine ph and glucose levels. results: platelet concentrates had attained stationary phase growth of streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, bacillus cereus, enterobacter cloacae, streptococcus mitis, or staphylococcus epidermidis (> or = 10(7) -10(8) colony-forming units [cfu]/ml) before either the swirling or dipstick methods suggested the presence of bacteria. the sensitivity of swirling and glucose tests for detecting bacterial contamination in platelet concentrates was generally comparable. although the sensitivity of the ph test was generally similar to that of swirling and glucose tests for most bacteria, platelet concentrates contaminated with e. cloacae had normal ph despite the presence of high levels of bacteria (> or = 10(7)-10(8) cfu/ml). conclusion: the sensitivity in detection of bacteria in platelet concentrates by the swirling technique or by measuring extracellular ph or plasma glucose is less than the sensitivity reported for microscopy with gram stain (10(5)-10(6) cfu/ml), fluorescence microscopy with acridine orange stain (10(4)-10(5) cfu/ml), chemiluminescence detection of ribosomal rna (10(3)-10(4) cfu/ml), and automated bacterial culture (1 cfu/sample volume).

AB  == bacteria respond to an abrupt decrease in temperature with a specific response, in which cold-induced proteins (cips) are transiently expressed at a higher level. employing two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, several cips have been identified. in spite of this, the overall function of the cold shock response is  unclear. recently, the main attention has focused on a group of conserved cold shock proteins (csps) that have been shown to have the highest induction after cold shock and to play a major regulatory role in the physiology of adaptation to low temperatures. csps, of which escherichia coli, bacillus subtilis, and b. cereus possess a family comprising at least 3-7 proteins, are small acidic proteins that share over 45% of sequence identity. recent evidence suggests that  members of this wide-spread protein family can function both at the transcriptional and translational level in vitro. however, the exact mode of action has yet to be established. in addition, post-transcriptional regulation seems to play a major role in the induction of csps, a process in which the ribosome may be involved. this is in accordance with a model in which the ribosome has been proposed to be the sensor of temperature in bacteria.

TI  == inhibition of microbial growth by ajoene, a sulfur-containing compound derived from garlic.
AB  == ajoene, a garlic-derived sulfur-containing compound that prevents platelet aggregation, exhibited broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. growth of gram-positive bacteria, such as bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, mycobacterium smegmatis, and streptomyces griseus, was inhibited at 5 micrograms of ajoene per  ml. staphylococcus aureus and lactobacillus plantarum also were inhibited below 20 micrograms of ajoene per ml. for gram-negative bacteria, such as escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and xanthomonas maltophilia, mics were between 100 and 160 micrograms/ml. ajoene also inhibited yeast growth at concentrations below 20 micrograms/ml. the microbicidal effect of ajoene on growing cells was observed at slightly higher concentrations than the corresponding mics. b. cereus and saccharomyces cerevisiae were killed at 30 micrograms of ajoene per ml after 24 h of cultivation when cultivation was started at 10(5) cells per ml. however, the minimal microbicidal concentrations for resting cells were at 10 to 100 times higher concentrations than the corresponding mics. the disulfide bond in ajoene appears to be necessary for the antimicrobial activity of ajoene, since reduction by cysteine, which reacts with disulfide bonds, abolished its antimicrobial activity.

TI  == methods for increasing survivability during storage of exponentially growing bacteria.
AB  == a protocol has been developed for storing gram (-) bacterial cells at 0 degrees c, which allows greater than 90% of stored cells to retain colony-forming ability for up to 60 days. the protocol, which yields essentially identical results when  used with escherichia coli or pseudomonas aeruginosa, does not enhance survivability of bacillus cereus. the greatest and longest survival is enjoyed when exponentially growing cells in minimal-glucose medium are deprived of carbon for about 9 h, supplemented with 750 microg/ml chloramphenicol, and immediately placed at 0 degrees c. by decreasing the period of carbon starvation from 9 to 5  h, or increasing the period of carbon starvation from 9 to 12 h, both the ultimate survival rate and kinetics of loss of culturability are affected. survival enhancement induced by chloramphenicol is not similarly induced by kanamycin.

TI  == structure-activity relationships in a series of substituted indolocarbazoles: topoisomerase i and protein kinase c inhibition and antitumoral and antimicrobial properties.
AB  == a series of compounds structurally related to staurosporine, rebeccamycin, and corresponding aglycones was synthesized, and their activities toward protein kinase c and topoisomerases i and ii were tested together with their in vitro antitumor efficiency against murine b16 melanoma and p388 leukemia cells. their antimicrobial activities were also examined against a gram-negative bacterium (escherichia coli), a yeast (candida albicans), and three gram-positive bacteria  (bacillus cereus, streptomyces chartreusis, and streptomyces griseus). to avoid side effects expected with protein kinase c inhibitors, we introduced substitution on the maleimide nitrogen and/or a sugar moiety linked to one of the indole nitrogens to obtain specific inhibitors of topoisomerase i with minimal activities on protein kinase c. as expected, these structures were inefficient on topoisomerase ii, and some of them exhibited a strong activity against topoisomerase i. generally, dechlorinated compounds were found to be more active  than chlorinated analogues against both purified topoisomerase i and protein kinase c. on the other hand, opposite results were obtained in the cell antiproliferative assays. these results suggest lack of cell membrane permeability in the absence of the chlorine residue or cleavage of carbon-chlorine bonds inside the cell.

TI  == expression and site-directed mutagenesis of the phosphatidylcholine-preferring phospholipase c of bacillus cereus: probing the role of the active site glu146.
AB  == a series of site-specific mutants of the phosphatidylcholine-preferring phospholipase c from bacillus cereus (plcbc) was prepared in which the glutamic acid residue at position 146 was replaced with glutamine, aspartic acid, histidine, and leucine to elucidate what role glu146 might play in catalysis. an  expression system for the native enzyme in escherichia coli was first developed to provide plcbc that was fused via an intervening factor xa protease recognition sequence at its n-terminus to maltose binding protein (mbp). this mbp-plcbc fusion protein was isolated at levels of 50-70 mg/l of culture; selective trypsin digestion of the mbp-plcbc fusion protein followed by chromatographic purification yielded recombinant plcbc at levels of ca. 10 mg/l. polymerase chain reaction (pcr) mutagenesis on the plcbc gene (plc) was then used to replace the glu146 codon with those for glutamine (e146q), aspartic acid (e146d), histidine (e146h), and leucine (e146l). the catalytic efficiency of the e146q mutant was 1.6% that of native plcbc, while the other mutants each possessed activities of 0.2-0.3% of the wild type. the kcat/km vs ph profiles for both e146q and native plcbc have ascending acidic limbs, suggesting that glu146 does not serve as the general base in the hydrolysis reaction. as measured by circular dichroism, all of the mutant proteins contained less helical structure and underwent denaturation at lower temperatures than the wild type in the order: wild type > e146q > e146d approximately e146h approximately e146l. atomic absorption analyses indicated that the mutant proteins also exhibited lower zn2+ content than the wild type. thus, the glu146 residue in plcbc stabilizes the secondary and tertiary structure of the enzyme and serves as a critical ligand for zn2, but it  does not appear to have any specific catalytic role.

TI  == increased accommodation of nascent rna in a product site on rna polymerase ii during arrest.
AB  == rna polymerases encounter specific dna sites at which rna chain elongation takes  place in the absence of enzyme translocation in a process called discontinuous elongation. for rna polymerase ii, at least some of these sequences also provoke  transcriptional arrest where renewed rna polymerization requires elongation factor sii. recent elongation models suggest the occupancy of a site within rna polymerase that accommodates nascent rna during discontinuous elongation. here we have probed the extent of nascent rna extruded from rna polymerase ii as it approaches, encounters, and departs an arrest site. just upstream of an arrest site, 17-19 nucleotides of the rna 3'-end are protected from exhaustive digestion by exogenous ribonuclease probes. as rna is elongated to the arrest site, the enzyme does not translocate and the protected rna becomes correspondingly larger, up to 27 nucleotides in length. after the enzyme passes the arrest site, the protected rna is again the 18-nucleotide species typical of an elongation-competent complex. these findings identify an extended rna product groove in arrested rna polymerase ii that is probably identical to that emptied during sii-activated rna cleavage, a process required for the resumption of elongation. unlike escherichia coli rna polymerase at a terminator, arrested rna  polymerase ii does not release its rna but can reestablish the normal elongation  mode downstream of an arrest site. discontinuous elongation probably represents a structural change that precedes, but may not be sufficient for, arrest by rna polymerase ii.

AB  == lethal effects of pulsed electric fields (pef) on suspensions of various bacteria, yeast, and spores in buffer solutions and liquid foodstuffs were examined. living-cell counts of vegetative cell types were reduced by pef treatment by up to more than four orders of magnitude (> 99.99%). on the other hand, endo- and ascospores were not inactivated or killed to any great extent. the killing of vegetative cell types depends on the electrical field strength of  the pulses and on the treatment time (the product of the pulse number and the decay time constant of the pulses). for each cell type, a specific critical electric field strength (ec) and a specific critical treatment time (tc) were determined. above these critical values, the fractions of surviving cells were reduced drastically. the "limits" ec and tc depend on the cell characteristics as well as on the type of medium in which the cells are suspended. especially in acid media living-cell counts were sufficiently decreased at very low energy inputs. in addition to the inactivation of microorganisms, the effect of pef on food components such as whey proteins, enzymes and vitamins, and on the taste of  foodstuffs was studied. the degree of destruction of these food components by pef was very low or negligible. moreover, no significant deterioration of the taste of foodstuffs was detected after pef treatment. disintegration of cells by pef treatment in order to harvest intracellular products was also studied. yeast cells, suspended in buffer solution, were not disintegrated by electric pulses. hence, pef treatment is an excellent process for inactivation of microorganisms in acid and in thermosensive media, but not for complete disintegration of microbial cells.

TI  == diverse capacities for the adaptive response to dna alkylation in bacillus species and strains.
AB  == our previous studies of bacillus subtilis showed that the genes responsible for the adaptive response to dna alkylation were organized as a divergent regulon, in contrast to scattered operons in escherichia coli ada regulon. to study the generality and diversity of gene organization, several species and strains of bacillus were examined for the responsiveness to dna alkylation. b. cereus cells  exhibited the highest resistance to mnng treatment. when the cells were grown in  the presence of mnng, 3-methyladenine dna glycosylase and two species of dna methyltransferase were induced as in b. subtilis 168 cells. b. licheniformis 749  and b. amyloliquefaciens h cells exhibited a partial response that manifested itself as the induction of one species of dna methyltransferase. on the other hand, b. thuringiensis var. tohokuensis, b. megaterium kmt, and b. subtilis w23 cells were totally deficient in this response, and were hypersensitive to alkylating agents. to determine the cause of this deficiency in strain w23, we examined the genomic structure of the corresponding region where three genes (alka, adaa, and adab) were located in 168. no homologues for the three genes were detected in w23 dna by southern hybridization. two genes (glms and ndhf) flanking the adaptive response regulon in 168 were also present in w23. a sequence of about 2750 bp that carried the entire regulon in 168 was replaced with a sequence of about 250 bp that was unique to w23. at the ends of the conserved segments, palindromic sequences corresponding to the transcriptional termination sites of the adab and glms genes were observed. the regulon in 168 could be artificially replaced by the w23 sequence, and be regained through dna-mediated transformation.

AB  == a gene with substantial sequence similarity to the mreb morphogene of bacillus subtilis has been identified at 302 degrees on the chromosomal map by a. decatur, b. kunkel, and r. losick (harvard university; personal communication). our characterization has revealed that the protein product of this determinant (termed mbl for mreb-like) is 55 and 53% identical in sequence to the mreb proteins of b. subtilis and escherichia coli, respectively. the protein is 86% identical to a protein identified as mreb from bacillus cereus, suggesting that the b. cereus protein is actually mbl. insertional inactivation of mbl indicated  that this gene is not essential for cell viability or sporulation. cells bearing  mutant mbl alleles display a decreased growth rate and an altered cellular morphology. the cells appear bloated and are frequently twisted. intergenic suppressor mutations which restore the growth rate to an approximately normal level arise within the mutant population. a second site mutation, designated som-1, was mapped to the hisa-mbl region of the chromosome by transduction.

TI  == antimicrobial mode of action of secretions from the metapleural gland of myrmecia gulosa (australian bull ant).
AB  == secretions from exocrine metapleural glands of myrmecia gulosa (australian bull ant) exhibit broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. treatment of the yeast candida albicans with metapleural secretion resulted in the rapid and total leakage of k+ ions from cells within 10 min. ultrastructural analysis of the bacteria bacillus cereus, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa, and cells and protoplasts of candida albicans demonstrated gross damage of the cell membrane and aggregation of the cytoplasmic matrix of treated cells. degradation  of membrane-bound organelles was also observed in candida albicans. the antimicrobially active components of metapleural secretions were nonpolar and interacted with the phospholipid bilayer, causing damage to the structural integrity of liposomes and the release of carboxyfluorescein. the data suggest that the antimicrobial agents in metapleural secretion act primarily by disrupting the structure and function of the phospholipid bilayer of the cytoplasmic membrane.

TI  == microbial counts and characteristics of streptoverticillium strains isolated from soils in the jordan valley.
AB  == a microbial survey of total bacterial count, agrobacteria, streptomycetes, and fungi was carried out in six locations in the jordan valley. the highest microbial counts for the four populations were in spring, the lowest mostly in autumn. no significant differences at p < 0.05 were observed either in the counts between the six locations, or in the seasonal counts of agrobacteria and streptomycetes between the six locations as well as within each location. the total bacterial counts (at p < 0.01) and fungi (at p < 0.05) differed significantly in the six locations. microbial counts and the studied environmental conditions showed no significant regression. of 552 streptomycetes  strains isolated from soils collected from these locations, 58 belonged to the genus streptoverticillium. they were distributed in five colour series grey (41%), red (31%), green (17%), blue (7%) and white (3%). forty-eight strains had  biverticillium spore bearing hyphae while only 10 had monoverticillium. while 28  strains produced distinctive reverse side pigment, only 8 and 6 strains produced  soluble pigment and melanin pigment, respectively. most strains utilized arabinose followed by fructose, mannitol, rhamnose, xylose, sucrose, inositol, and raffinose. sixty-nine per cent of the strains exhibited activity in vitro test against pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 45, 41, 28, and 7% against staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, agrobacterium tumefaciens and escherichia coli, respectively.

TI  == interactions between saturated acyl chains confer detergent resistance on lipids  and glycosylphosphatidylinositol (gpi)-anchored proteins: gpi-anchored proteins in liposomes and cells show similar behavior.
AB  == proteins anchored by gpi are poorly solubilized from cell membranes by cold nonionic detergents because they associate with detergent-resistant membranes rich in cholesterol and sphingolipids. in this study, we demonstrated that cholesterol and sphingolipid-rich liposomes were incompletely solubilized by triton x-100. gpi-anchored placental alkaline phosphatase incorporated in these liposomes was also not solubilized by cold triton x-100. as sphingolipids have much higher melting temperatures (tm) than cellular phospholipids, a property correlated with tm might cause detergent inextractability. in support of this idea, we found that the low-tm lipid dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine (dopc) was efficiently extracted from detergent-resistant liposomes by triton x-100, whereas the high-tm lipid dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (dppc) was not. the fluorescence polarization of liposome-incorporated diphenylhexatriene was measured to determine the "fluidity" of the detergent-resistant liposomes. we found that these liposomes were about as fluid as dppc/cholesterol liposomes, which were present in the liquid-ordered phase, and much less fluid than dopc or  dopc/cholesterol liposomes. these findings may explain the behavior of gpi-anchored proteins, which often have saturated fatty acyl chains and should prefer a less-fluid membrane. therefore, we propose that acyl chain interactions  can influence the association of gpi-anchored proteins with detergent-resistant membrane lipids. the affinity of gpi-anchored proteins for a sphingolipid-rich membrane phase that is not in the liquid crystalline state may be important in determining their cellular localization.

TI  == a device to measure the oxygen uptake rate of attached cells: importance in bioartificial organ design.
AB  == quantification of the dependence of cellular oxygen uptake rate (our) on oxygen partial pressure is useful for the design and testing of bioartificial devices which utilize cells. thus far, this information has only been obtained from suspended cells and from cells attached to microcarriers. in this work, a device  was developed to obtain the dependence of our on oxygen partial pressure for anchorage-dependent cells cultured in standard culture dishes. the device is placed and sealed on the top of the culture dish, and holds a clark polarographic mini-electrode flush with the bottom surface of the device. it also houses a motor to spin a magnetic stir bar within the cell chamber to insure that the medium is well-mixed. several characteristics of the device--such as oxygen leakage into the device chamber, electrode-lag time, and linearity of the electrode at low oxygen partial pressures--were quantified and their potential effect on the values of vm (maximal our) and k0.5 (oxygen partial pressure at which our is half-maximal) were evaluated. comparison of vm and k0.5 values obtained with this device with previously published values for suspended rat hepatocytes, bacillus cereus, and e. coli indicated that the technique provides values accurate within 30% as long as the cell under study has a k0.5 greater than approximately 1.0 mmhg. for hepatocytes cultured on 0.05 mm thickness collagen gel for 1 day (n = 4) and 3 days (n = 6), vm was found to be 0.38 +/- 0.12 and 0.25 +/- 0.09 nmol o2/s/10(6) cells, respectively, and k0.5 was found to be 5.6 +/- 0.5 and 3.3 +/- 0.6 mmhg, respectively. this technique should aid in predicting bioreactor conditions such as flow rate, cell density, distance of cell from flow, and gas phase oxygen partial pressure which can lead to oxygen limitations. in addition, further studies of the effect of factors such as extracellular matrix composition, metabolic substrate, and drugs on the dependence of our on oxygen partial pressure for many anchorage-dependent cell types can be pursued with this technique.

TI  == glutamine synthetase of mycobacterium tuberculosis: extracellular release and characterization of its enzymatic activity.
AB  == we have investigated the activity and extracellular release of glutamine synthetase [l-glutamate:ammonia ligase (adp-forming), ec 6.3.1.2] of mycobacterium tuberculosis. the purified, homogeneous m. tuberculosis glutamine synthetase appears to consist of 12 most likely identical subunits of m(r) 58,000, arranged in two superimpose hexagons. in the catalysis of l-glutamine, the enzyme has an apparent km for l-glutamate of approximately 3 mm at the ph optimum of 7.5. m. tuberculosis releases a large proportion (approximately 30%) of its total measurable enzyme activity into the culture medium, a feature that is highly specific for pathogenic mycobacteria. immunogold electron microscopy revealed that m. tuberculosis also releases the enzyme into its phagosome in infected human monocytes. two potentially important roles for glutamine synthase  in the pathogenesis of m. tuberculosis infection are (i) the synthesis of l-glutamine, a major component of the cell wall of pathogenic but not nonpathogenic mycobacteria, and (ii) the modulation of the ammonia level in the m. tuberculosis phagosome, which may in turn influence phagosomal ph and phagosomelysosome fusion.

TI  == modes of inhibition of foodborne non-salmonella bacteria by selenite cystine selective broth.
AB  == various cell densities of six common foodborne non-salmonella bacteria were exposed to selenite cystine (sc) salmonella selective medium. the insensitivity of pseudomonas aeruginosa and proteus vulgaris to sc was confirmed. selenite cystine selective medium was effective against the sensitive bacteria up to certain cell densities, beyond which the bacteria survived. as judged from the minimum cell number required for survival in sc, staphylococcus aureus was the most sensitive to sc, followed by bacillus cereus, escherichia coli and citrobacter freundii. when sensitive bacteria were grown in sc, they enriched resistant variants which exhibited no or reduced sensitivity to sc. the change in density of sensitive cells after exposure to sc suggested that bacterial sensitivity to sc depended on the efficiency of killing and growth inhibition by  sc as well as the fraction of resistant variants in the bacterial population. since salmonella samples generally contain unknown numbers and types of sensitive bacteria, it is difficult to predict the effectiveness of their selective inhibition by sc.

AB  == to investigate the distribution of the hemolysin ii determinant among strains of  bacillus cereus and bacillus thuringiensis, thirteen strains of b. cereus and fourteen strains of b. thuringiensis strains were tested for hybridization of their chromosomal dnas with a dna probe containing the b. cereus hemolysin ii gene. in addition, the production of hemolysin ii, whose activity is not inhibited by cholesterol, was tested. the presence (absence) of the hydridization response in the microorganisms's genome correlated with the presence (absence) of cholesterol-unaffected hemolysin production. only four out of thirteen b. cereus  strains were found to give a positive response in hybridization experiments, whereas thirteen out of fourteen b. thuringiensis strains responded positively. dnas from ten b. thuringiensis strains contained a 3.5 kb ecorv fragment, which hybridized with the b. cereus hemolysin ii gene probe. the 3.5 kb ecorv dna fragment from one of these strains (b. thuringiensis vkm-b1555) was cloned and expressed in escherichia coli cells. the hemolysin encoded by the cloned dna fragment was not inhibited by cholesterol and possessed all other properties of b. cereus hemolysin ii. the obtained data clearly show limited distribution of hemolysin ii among b. cereus strains and demonstrate that hemolysin ii is more characteristic of b. thuringiensis than b. cereus.

AB  == aspergillus terreus produces a unique enzyme, blasticidin s deaminase, which catalyzes the deamination of blasticidin s (bs), and in consequence confers high  resistance to the antibiotic. a cdna clone derived from the structural gene for bs deaminase (bsd) was isolated by transforming escherichia coli with an aspergillus cdna expression library and directly selecting for the ability to grow in the presence of the antibiotic. the complete nucleotide sequence of bsd was determined and proved to contain an open reading frame of 393 bp, encoding a  polypeptide of 130 amino acids. comparison of its nucleotide sequence with that of bsr, the bs deaminase gene isolated from bacillus cereus, indicated no homology and a large difference in codon usage. the activity of bsd expressed in  e. coli was easily quantified by an assay based on spectrophotometric recording.  the bsd gene was placed in a shuttle vector for schizosaccharomyces pombe, downstream of the sv40 early region promoter, and this allowed direct selection with bs at high frequency, following transformation into the yeast. the bsd gene  was also employed as a selectable marker for pyricularia oryzae, which could not  be transformed to bs resistance by bsr. these result promise that the bsd gene will be useful as a new dominant selectable marker for eukaryotes.

TI  == molecular characterization of an enterobacterial metallo beta-lactamase found in  a clinical isolate of serratia marcescens that shows imipenem resistance.
AB  == a clinical isolate of serratia marcescens (tn9106) produced a metallo beta-lactamase (imp-1) which conferred resistance to imipenem and broad-spectrum  beta-lactams. the blaimp gene providing imipenem resistance was cloned and expressed in escherichia coli hb101. the imp-1 was purified from e. coli hb101 that harbors psmbnu24 carrying blaimp, and its apparent molecular mass was calculated to be about 30 kda by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. kinetic studies of imp-1 against various beta-lactams revealed that this enzyme hydrolyzes not only various broad-spectrum beta-lactams but also carbapenems. however, aztreonam was relatively stable against imp-1. although clavulanate or cloxacillin failed to inhibit imp-1, hg2+, fe2+, or cu2+ blocked the enzyme's activity. moreover, the presence of edta in the reaction buffer resulted in a decrease in the enzyme's activity. carbapenem resistance was not transferred from s. marcescens tn9106 to e. coli csh2 by conjugation. a hybridization study confirmed that blaimp was encoded on the chromosome of s. marcescens tn9106. by nucleotide sequencing analysis, blaimp was found to encode  a protein of 246 amino acid residues and was shown to have considerable homology  to the metallo beta-lactamase genes of bacillus cereus, bacteroides fragilis, and aeromonas hydrophila. the g+c content of blaimp was 39.4%. four consensus amino acid residues, his-95, his-97, cys-176, and his-215, which form putative zinc ligands, were conserved in the deduced amino acid sequence of imp-1. by determination of the amino acid sequence at the n terminus of purified mature imp-1, 18 amino acid residues were found to be processed from the n terminus of the premature enzyme as a signal peptide. these results clearly show that imp-1 is an enterobacterial metallo beta-lactamase, of which the primary structure has  been completely determined, that confers resistance to carbapenems and other broad-spectrum beta-lactams.

AB  == previous evidence suggests that hemolysin bl, which consists of a binding component, b, and two lytic components, l1 and l2, is the enterotoxin responsible for the diarrheal form of gastroenteritis caused by food-borne strains of bacillus cereus. to prove that hemolysin bl and the enterotoxin are the same requires large amounts of these components free of other b. cereus proteins. for  this purpose, we sought to clone the gene encoding the b component and to express it in escherichia coli. a partial genomic library was constructed and a 29-base,  1,152-fold-degenerate oligonucleotide probe, designed from the n-terminal amino acid sequence of the b component, was used to identify recombinant clones containing the gene. detection of gene products reactive with a monoclonal antibody specific for the b component and analysis of the nucleotide sequence confirmed that isolated clones, reactive with the oligonucleotide probe, did contain the gene encoding the b component. the protein, expressed in e. coli, apparently from the b. cereus promoter, produces a ring-shaped zone of hemolysis  when combined with purified l components from b. cereus, a reaction typical of hemolysin bl. northern (rna) blot analysis of b. cereus rna showed a large (5.1-kb) transcript which hybridized with a 500-bp probe internal to the b-component-coding sequence, suggesting that the hbla gene encoding the b component may be transcribed as part of a polycistronic message, possibly including the structural genes for the two lytic components. higher levels of expression and disruption of the hbla gene are being pursued to resolve whether hemolysin bl is indeed the enterotoxin.

TI  == antitumor activities of a cephalosporin prodrug in combination with monoclonal antibody-beta-lactamase conjugates.
AB  == 7-(phenylacetamido)cephalosporin mustard (cm) and 7-(4-carboxybutanamido)cephalosporin mustard (ccm) were developed as anticancer prodrugs that could be activated site selectively by monoclonal antibody-beta-lactamase conjugates targeted to antigens present on tumor cell surfaces. both cm and ccm were hydrolyzed by purified beta-lactamases from escherichia coli (ec beta l), bacillus cereus (bc beta l), and enterobacter cloacae (ecl beta l). this resulted in the release of phenylenediamine mustard (pdm), a potent cytotoxic drug. the km and kcat values of the reactions were determined, and it was found that ecl beta l effected the hydrolysis of cm and ccm more rapidly than the other enzymes. conjugates of ecl beta l were prepared by reacting maleimide-substituted f(ab')2 fragments of the monoclonal antibodies  l6 and p1.17 to ecl beta l that had been modified with sulfhydryl groups. in vitro experiments indicated that ccm (ic50 = 25-45 microm) was less toxic than pdm (ic50 = 1.5 microm) to h2981 lung adenocarcinoma cells (l6 antigen positive,  p1.17 antigen negative) and that immunologically specific prodrug activation took place when the cells were treated with l6-ecl beta l. in vivo experiments in nude mice demonstrated that ccm was less toxic than cm, and that both prodrugs were much less toxic than pdm. neither ccm nor pdm exerted antitumor activity on subcutaneous h2981 tumors in vivo. however, a significant antitumor effect was obtained in mice that received l6-ecl beta l 96 h prior to the administration of  ccm. the effect was immunologically specific (p < 0.05), since a smaller degree of antitumor activity was obtained in mice that received the nonbinding control conjugate p1.17-ecl beta l prior to ccm.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == production of a cloned xylanase in bacillus cereus and its performance in kraft pulp prebleaching.
AB  == xylanase production from a bacillus subtilis gene cloned into a strain of escherichia coli was monitored. although this gene was expressed in e. coli at several temperatures, efficient xylanase secretion did not occur; the observed protein release apparently depended on cell leakage or lysis. screening for a better microbial protein secretor free of cellulase selected bacillus cereus no.  518. a bidirectional vector plasmid (pmk3) was employed to carry the cloned gene  into this b. cereus strain. transformation was carried out by electroporation. total xylanase production by the new pmk3-borne gene in b. cereus was similar to  that from e. coli but the xylanase was shown to be normally secreted. the xylanase gene products from the e. coli and b. cereus hosts were shown to function identically. both xylanases improved the delignification of unbleached softwood and hardwood kraft pulps, thus reducing the cl2 required to achieve a given degree of bleaching, without altering the physical properties of the fibers. using a target kappa number (lignin content) of 5, xylanase pretreatment  of aspen kraft (chemical) pulp led to a 22% savings of chlorine. adsorbable organic halogens in the bleachery effluent were also lowered by more than 50%.

AB  == extracts of nine mosses, collected in switzerland, were screened for antimicrobial, antioxidative, and 15-lipoxygenase (15-lpo) inhibitory activities. the ch2cl2 extract of dicranum scoparium was found to possess pronounced antimicrobial activity against bacillus cereus, bacillus stearothermophilus, bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, and escherichia coli. in addition, inhibition of soybean 15-lpo occurred at very low concentration. phytochemical investigation of this extract afforded z,z,z-octadeca-6-yne-9,12,15-trienoic acid [1] by a combination of chromatographic techniques. this compound, named dicranin [1], was found to be responsible for most of the biological activity. the strongest antimicrobial effect was observed against streptococcus faecalis (disc  diffusion assay). in contrast to the ch2cl2 extract of d. scoparium, dicranin was inactive against e. coli. dicranin was identified by ir, ms, and nmr spectroscopy. a 2d inadequate experiment confirmed the structure and yielded the  assignment of all 13c-nmr signals.

TI  == nonspecific phospholipase c of listeria monocytogenes: activity on phospholipids  in triton x-100-mixed micelles and in biological membranes.
AB  == listeria monocytogenes secretes a phospholipase c (plc) which has 39% amino acid  sequence identity with the broad-specificity plc from bacillus cereus. recent work indicates that the l. monocytogenes enzyme plays a role during infections of mammalian cells (j.-a. vazquez-boland, c. kocks, s. dramsi, h. ohayon, c. geoffroy, j. mengaud, and p. cossart, infect. immun. 60:219-230, 1992). the homogeneous enzyme has a specific activity of 230 mumol/min/mg when phosphatidylcholine (pc) is dispersed in sodium deoxycholate. with phospholipid-triton x-100 mixed micelles, the enzyme had a broad ph optimum between 5.5 and 8.0, and the rates of lipid hydrolysis were in the following order: pc > phosphatidylethanolamine (pe) > phosphatidylserine > sphingomyelin >> phosphatidylinositol (pi). activity on pc was stimulated 35% by 0.5 m nacl and 60% by 0.05 mm znso4. when escherichia coli phospholipids were dispersed in triton x-100, pe and phosphatidylglycerol, but not cardiolipin, were hydrolyzed.  the enzyme was active on all phospholipids of vesiculated human erythrocytes including pi, which was rapidly hydrolyzed at ph 7.0. pi was also hydrolyzed in pi-pc-cholesterol liposomes by the nonspecific plc from l. monocytogenes and by the homologous enzyme from b. cereus. the water-soluble hydrolysis product was identified as inositol-1-phosphate. for the hydrolysis of human erythrocyte ghost phospholipids, a broad ph optimum was also observed. 32p-labelled clostridium butyricum protoplasts, which are rich in ether lipids, were treated with plc. the enzyme hydrolyzed the plasmalogen form of pe, its glycerol acetal, and cardiolipin, in addition to pe. i-, cl- and f- stimulated activity on either pc-  triton x-100 mixed micelles or human erythrocyte ghosts, unlike the enzyme from b. cereus which is strongly inhibited by halides. tris-hcl, phosphate, and calcium nitrate had similar inhibitory effects on the enzyme on the enzymes from  l. monocytogenes and b. cereus.

TI  == biochemical properties of a carbapenem-hydrolyzing beta-lactamase from enterobacter cloacae and cloning of the gene into escherichia coli.
AB  == a clinical isolate of enterobacter cloacae, strain nor-1, exhibited resistance to imipenem and remained susceptible to extended-spectrum cephalosporins. clavulanic acid partially restored the susceptibility of the strain to imipenem. two beta-lactamases with isoelectric points (pi) of 6.9 and > 9.2 were detected in strain e. cloacae nor-1; the higher pi corresponded to ampc cephalosporinase. plasmid dna was not detected in e. cloacae nor-1 and imipenem resistance could not be transferred into escherichia coli jm109. the carbapenem-hydrolyzing beta-lactamase gene was cloned into plasmid pacyc184. one recombinant plasmid, pptn1, harbored a 5.3-kb sau3a fragment from e. cloacae nor-1 expressing the carbapenem-hydrolyzing beta-lactamase. this enzyme (pi 6.9) hydrolyzed ampicillin, cephalothin, and imipenem more rapidly than it did meropenem and aztreonam, but it hydrolyzed extended-spectrum cephalosporins only weakly and did not hydrolyze cefoxitin. hydrolytic activity was partially inhibited by clavulanic acid, sulbactam, and tazobactam, was nonsusceptible to chelating agents such as edta and 1,10-o-phenanthroline, and was independent of the presence of zncl2. its relative molecular mass was 30,000 da. induction experiments concluded that the carbapenem-hydrolyzing beta-lactamase biosynthesis was inducible by cefoxitin and imipenem. subcloning experiments with hindiii partial digests of pptn1 resulted in a recombinant plasmid, designated pptn2, which contained a 1.3-kb insert from pptn1 and which conferred resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics. hybridization studies performed with a 1.2-kb hindiii fragment from pptn2 failed to determine any homology with ampc of e. cloacae, with other known beta-lactamase genes commonly found in members of the family enterobacteriaceae (bla(tem-1)) and bla(shv-3) derivatives), and with previously  described carbapenemase genes such as those from xanthomonas maltophilia, bacillus cereus, bacteroides fragilis (cfia), and aeromonas hydrophila (cpha). this work describing the biochemical properties of a novel chromosome-encoded beta-lactamase from e. cloacae indicates that this enzyme differs from all the previously described carbapenemases. this is the first reported cloning of a carbapenem-hydrolyzing gene from a member of the family enterobacteriaceae.

TI  == genetic construction, expression, and characterization of a single chain anti-carcinoma antibody fused to beta-lactamase.
AB  == we report the genetic construction and expression of a fusion protein between an  antibody single chain-linked variable domain fragment specific for human carcinomas and beta-lactamase ii from bacillus cereus. sequences encoding the variable regions of the l6 monoclonal antibody were assembled so as to be separated from each other by an 18-amino acid linker and from the mature form of  beta-lactamase by a 6-amino acid linker. the construct was placed under the transcriptional regulation of the lac promoter, and the pelb signal sequence was  used to direct export of the fusion protein to the periplasmic space of escherichia coli. after induction, biologically active material was recovered from both culture supernatants and cell lysates. affinity chromatography yielded  about 2.5 micrograms of protein/ml of initial culture volume. the fusion protein  was shown to bind to tumor cells at least as well as chemically prepared f(ab') and to maintain beta-lactamase activity at a level similar to that of the native  enzyme. tumor cells coated with the fusion protein were sensitive to a cephalosporin mustard prodrug in a dose-dependent fashion comparable to that of enzyme chemically conjugated to f(ab'). this article demonstrates the feasibility of using single chain-linked variable domain-enzyme fusion proteins for the activation of anticancer prodrugs.

AB  == formycin b (fb), a moderate inhibitor (ki approximately 100 microm) of mammalian  purine nucleoside phosphorylase (pnp), and formycin a (fa), which is totally inactive vs. the mammalian enzyme, are both effective inhibitors of the bacterial (escherichia coli) enzyme (ki approximately 5 microm). examination of a series of n-methyl analogues of fa and fb led to the finding that n(6)-methyl-fa, virtually inactive vs. the mammalian enzyme, is the most potent inhibitor of e. coli purine nucleoside phosphorylase (ki approximately 0.3 um) at neutral ph. inhibition is competitive not only with respect to ino, but also relative to 7-methyl-guo and 7-methyl-ado, as substrates. both oxoformycins a and b are relatively poor inhibitors. for the most potent inhibitor, n(6)-methyl-fa, it was shown that the  enzyme preferentially binds the neutral, and not the cationic, form. in accordance with this the neutral, but not the cationic form, of the structurally  related n(1)-methyl-ado was found to be an excellent substrate. reported data on  tautomerism of formycins were profited from, and extended, to infer which tautomeric species and ionic forms are the active inhibitors. a commercially available (sigma) bacterial pnp, of unknown origin, was shown to differ from the  e. coli enzyme by its inability to phosphorylase ado; this enzyme was also resistant to fa and fb. these findings have been extended to provide a detailed comparison of the substrate/inhibitor properties of pnp from various microorganisms.

AB  == cephalosporin mustard (cm) was designed as an anticancer prodrug that could be activated in a site-specific manner by monoclonal antibody-beta-lactamase conjugates targeted to antigens present on tumor cell surfaces. purified beta-lactamases from bacillus cereus (bc beta l) and escherichia coli (ec beta l) catalyzed the release of phenylenediamine mustard (pdm) from cm through a fragmentation reaction which occurs after the beta-lactam ring of cm is hydrolyzed. the km and vmax values were 5.7 microm and 201 mumol/min per mg for bc beta l and 43 microm and 29 mumol/min per mg for ec beta l, respectively. conjugates of bc beta l were prepared by combining the f(ab')2 fragments of the maleimide-substituted monoclonal antibodies l6 and 1f5 with thiolated bc beta l.  the conjugates showed little loss in enzymatic activity and bound nearly as well  as the unmodified f(ab')2 monoclonal antibodies to antigens expressed on the h2981 human lung adenocarcinoma cell line (l6 positive, 1f5 negative). pdm was approximately 50-fold more cytotoxic than cm to h2981 cells. treatment of the cells with l6-bc beta l followed by cm resulted in a level of cytotoxic activity  that was comparable to that of pdm. this was most likely due to activation of cm  by conjugate that bound to cell-surface antigens, since pretreatment of h2981 cells with bc beta l or 1f5-bc beta l enhanced the activity of cm to a lesser extent. thus, we have shown that cm is a prodrug, and that it can be activated with immunological specificity by a monoclonal antibody-beta-lactamase conjugate.

TI  == relationship between selected bacteria and the growth of immature house flies, musca domestica, in an axenic test system.
AB  == to investigate the relationship between immature (maggot) house flies, musca domestica, and bacteria, we compared the development of sterile first-instar maggots in each of 10 pure blood agar cultures of bacteria with growth on sterile blood agar (negative control) and on standard house fly rearing medium (positive  control). nine species of bacteria representing gram-negative and gram-positive rods, coccoid, and micrococcoid cell types supported house fly growth on blood agar. one bacterium, a strain of bacillus cereus, inhibited maggot growth. the percent pupation for maggots that developed in the presence of eight of nine bacteria (range, 41-69%), was significantly greater than in sterile blood agar (0-5%), and did not differ significantly from maggot growth in the rearing medium (50-90%). average pupal weight for maggots that developed on blood agar with bacteria ranged from 19 to 21 mg, a reflection of favorable growth conditions. average pupal weight in the presence of three bacteria (19.9, 19.4, and 19.4 mg)  was significantly less than respective pupal weights in house fly rearing medium  (24.0, 22.3, and 22.1 mg), but there was no difference in average pupal weight with six bacteria and the house fly rearing medium. these findings illustrate that bacteria or their metabolic products are essential as nutrients for house fly maggot growth in blood agar; a wide variety of adventitious bacteria can contribute to the suitability of an organic substrate for maggot growth; and a naturally occurring isolate of b. cereus limits house fly maggot growth in blood  agar, a relationship that has not been reported previously.

TI  == critical micelle concentration and hemolytic activity--a correlation suggested by the marine sterol, halistanol trisulfate.
AB  == the marine natural product, halistanol trisulfate, has a relatively low critical  micelle concentration of 0.001% m/v (14.5 microm) and strong hemolytic potency with an ec50 of 0.00046% m/v (6.67 microm). as expected of a detergent, it inhibits the growth of gram-positive but not gram-negative bacteria. the hemolytic activity of halistanol trisulfate and other detergents has been shown to correlate with critical micelle concentration. this correlation may have important implications in the mechanism of membranolytic bioactivity.

TI  == structure and mechanism of alkaline phosphatase.
AB  == alkaline phosphatase was the first zinc enzyme to be discovered in which three closely spaced metal ions (two zn ions and one mg ion) are present at the active  center. zn ions at all three sites also produce a maximally active enzyme. these  metal ions have center-to-center distances of 3.9 a (zn1-zn2), 4.9 a (zn2-mg3), and 7.1 a (zn1-mg3). despite the close packing of these metal centers, only one bridging ligand, the carboxyl of asp51, bridges zn2 and mg3. a crystal structure  at 2.0-a resolution of the noncovalent phosphate complex, e.p, formed with the active center shows that two phosphate oxygens form a phosphate bridge between zn1 and zn2, while the two other phosphate oxygens form hydrogen bonds with the guanidium group of arg166. this places ser102, the residue known to be phosphorylated during phosphate hydrolysis, in the required apical position to initiate a nucleophilic attack on the phosphorous. extrapolation of the e.p structure to the enzyme-substrate complex, e.ropo4(2-), leads to the conclusion that zn1 must coordinate the ester oxygen, thus activating the leaving group in the phosphorylation of ser102. likewise, zn2 appears to coordinate the ester oxygen of the seryl phosphate and activate the leaving group during the hydrolysis of the phosphoseryl intermediate. both of these findings suggest that  there may be a significant dissociative character to each of the two displacements at phosphorous catalyzed by alkaline phosphatase. a water molecule  (or hydroxide) coordinated to zn1 following formation of the phosphoseryl intermediate appears to be the nucleophile in the second step of the mechanism. dissociation of the product phosphate from the e.p intermediate is the slowest, 35 s-1, and therefore the rate-limiting, step of the mechanism at alkaline ph. since the determination of the initial crystal structure of alkaline phosphatase, two other crystal structures of enzymes involved in phosphate ester hydrolysis have been completed that show a triad of closely spaced zinc ions present at their active centers. these enzymes are phospholipase c from bacillus cereus (structure at 1.5-a resolution) (43) and p1 nuclease from penicillium citrinum (structure at 2.8-a resolution) (74). both enzymes hydrolyze phosphodiesters. substrates for phospholipase c are phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylcholine,  while p1 nuclease is an endonuclease hydrolyzing single stranded ribo- and deoxyribonucleotides. p1 nuclease also has activity as a phosphomonoesterase against 3'-terminal phosphates of nucleotides. the zn ions in both enzymes form almost identical trinuclear sites.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == [microbial contamination of twenty drugs of plant origin].
AB  == twenty drugs of plant origin were analysed in order to determine the microbial contamination level. a light homogenizing method was used to avoid an increase in the antimicrobial capacity of certain drugs, which would falsify the analytical results. the total viable aerobic count (tvc) varied from 10(1) to 10(7) cfu/g and in 11 samples out of 21 was equal to or higher than 10(5) cfu/g. the number of fungi varied from one drug to another, but was generally lower than the aerobic tvc to the power of 10. no cases containing aspergillus flavus were found. the total viable anaerobic count consisted mainly of facultative anaerobic germs. aerobic spores and facultative anaerobic bacteria were abundant. they often represented more than 50% of the aerobic tvc and among them, bacillus cereus was found. concerning specified micro-organisms, escherichia coli was found 3 times, staphylococcus aureus 2 times and pseudomonas (not aeruginosa) a few times. salmonella was never found. the enterobacteriaceae, on the other hand, were often found and in some cases their number can be greater than 10(4) cfu/g.  the typed bacteria corresponded to enterobacter spp. some drug samples in bags were analysed. the level of contamination was identical to that found in the bulk drugs. the analysis in parallel of a black tea sample showed an aerobic tvc of 4.10(3) cfu/g. specified micro-organisms were not found in the infusions. in comparison with non-boiled drugs, the survivors can represent up to 30% of the aerobic tvc.

TI  == nucleotide sequence of the lecithinase operon of listeria monocytogenes and possible role of lecithinase in cell-to-cell spread.
AB  == the lecithinase gene of the intracellular pathogen listeria monocytogenes, plcb,  was identified in a 5,648-bp dna fragment which expressed lecithinase activity when cloned into escherichia coli. this fragment is located immediately downstream of the previously identified gene mpl (prta). it contains five open reading frames, named acta, plcb, and orfx, -y, and -z, which, together with mpl, form an operon, since a 5.7-kb-long transcript originates from a promoter located upstream of mpl (j. mengaud, c. geoffroy, and p. cossart, infect. immun. 59:1043-1049, 1991). a second promoter was detected in front of acta which encodes a putative membrane protein containing a region of internal repeats. plcb encodes the lecithinase, a predicted 289-amino-acid protein homologous to the phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipases c of bacillus cereus and clostridium  perfringens (alpha-toxin). plcb mutants produce only small plaques on fibroblast  monolayers, and an electron microscopic analysis of infected macrophages suggests that lecithinase is involved in the lysis of the two-membrane vacuoles that surround the bacteria after cell-to-cell spread. on the opposite dna strand, downstream of the operon, three more open reading frames, ldh, orfa, and orfb, were found. the deduced amino acid sequence of the first one is homologous to lactate dehydrogenases. low-stringency southern hybridization experiments suggest that these three open reading frames lie outside of the l. monocytogenes virulence region: mpl and acta were specific for l. monocytogenes, sequences hybridizing to plcb were detected in l. ivanovii and l. seeligeri, and sequences  hybridizing to orfx, -y, and -z were found in l. innocua. in contrast to this, sequences hybridizing to ldh or orfb were detected in all listeria species (including the nonpathogenic ones).

TI  == a fluorescent substrate for the continuous assay of phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase c: synthesis and application of 2-naphthyl myo-inositol-1-phosphate.
AB  == a fluorescent water-soluble substrate for phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase c was synthesized. the diacylglycerol moiety of the natural substrate, phosphatidylinositol, was replaced by the fluorescent moiety, 2-naphthol, resulting in the synthetic substrate, racemic 2-naphthyl myo-inositol-1-phosphate. the synthetic substrate provided a continuous fluorometric assay for the phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase c from bacillus cereus. initial rates of the cleavage of the 2-naphthyl substrate by the phospholipase measured by fluorometry were linear with time and the amount of enzyme added. the specific enzyme activity at ph 8.5 and 25 degrees c was about 0.04 mumol/min mg protein at an initial substrate concentration of 0.8 mm. 31p nmr experiments suggest that, as with phosphatidylinositol itself, cleavage of the fluorescent substrate proceeds in two steps via a myo-inositol-1,2-cyclic phosphate intermediate, and that only the d-isomer is a substrate for the b. cereus phospholipase. the synthetic substrate was stable during long-term storage as a solid in the dark at -20 degrees c. it was also stable for several weeks when stored in the dark frozen in aqueous solution near neutral ph.

TI  == the aeromonas hydrophila cpha gene: molecular heterogeneity among class b metallo-beta-lactamases.
AB  == an aeromonas hydrophila gene, named cpha, coding for a carbapenem-hydrolyzing metallo-beta-lactamase, was cloned in escherichia coli by screening an aeromonas  genomic library for clones able to grow on imipenem-containing medium. from sequencing data, the cloned cpha gene appeared able to code for a polypeptide of  254 amino acids whose sequence includes a potential n-terminal leader sequence for targeting the protein to the periplasmic space. these data were in agreement  with the molecular mass of the original aeromonas enzyme and of the recombinant enzyme produced in e. coli, evaluated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of crude beta-lactamase preparations followed by renaturation treatment for proteins separated in the gel and localization of protein bands showing carbapenem-hydrolyzing beta-lactamase activity by a modified iodometric technique. the deduced amino acid sequence of the cpha enzyme showed regions of partial homology with both the beta-lactamase ii of bacillus cereus and the cfia  beta-lactamase of bacteroides fragilis. sequence homologies were more pronounced  in the regions encompassing the amino acid residues known in the enzyme of b. cereus to function as ligand-binding residues for the metal cofactor. the cpha enzyme, however, appeared to share a lower degree of similarity with the two other enzymes, which, in turn, seemed more closely related to each other. these results, therefore, suggest the existence of at least two molecular subclasses within molecular class b metallo-beta-lactamases.

TI  == site-directed mutagenesis of dicarboxylic acids near the active site of bacillus  cereus 5/b/6 beta-lactamase ii.
AB  == an amino acid residue functioning as a general base has been proposed to assist in the hydrolysis of beta-lactam antibiotics by the zinc-containing bacillus cereus beta-lactamase ii [bicknell & waley (1985) biochemistry 24, 6876-6887]. oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis of cloned bacillus cereus 5/b/6 beta-lactamase ii was used in an 'in vivo' study to investigate the role of carboxy-group-containing amino acids near the active site of the enzyme. substitution of asparagine for the wild-type aspartic acid residue at position 81 resulted in fully functional enzyme. an aspartic acid residue at position 90 is essential for beta-lactamase ii to confer any detectable ampicillin and cephalosporin c resistance to escherichia coli. conversion of asp90 into asn90 or glu90 lead to the synthesis of inactive enzyme, suggesting that the spatial position of the beta-carboxy group of asp90 is critical for enzyme function.

AB  == two single mutants and the corresponding double mutant of beta-lactamase i from bacillus cereus 569/h were constructed and their kinetics investigated. the mutants have lys-73 replaced by arginine (k73r), or glu-166 replaced by aspartic  acid (e166d), or both (k73r + e166d). all four rate constants in the acyl-enzyme  mechanism were determined for the e166d mutant by the methods described by christensen, martin & waley [(1990) biochem. j. 266, 853-861]. both the rate constants for acylation and deacylation for the hydrolysis of benzylpenicillin were decreased about 2000-fold in this mutant. in the k73r mutant, and in the double mutant, the rate constants for acylation were decreased about 100-fold and 10,000-fold respectively. all three mutants also had lowered values for the rate  constants for the formation and dissociation of the non-covalent enzyme-substrate complex. the specificities of the mutants did not differ greatly from those of wild-type beta-lactamase, but the hydrolysis of cephalosporin c by the k73r mutant gave 'burst' kinetics.

AB  == the in vitro activity of sparfloxacin, a new quinolone, was compared with those of ciprofloxacin and fleroxacin against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, greater than 90% of which were isolated from blood culture specimens of cancer patients. sparfloxacin was extremely active against acinetobacter species, aeromonas hydrophila, citrobacter diversus, enterobacter species, escherichia coli, klebsiella species, proteus vulgaris, and serratia marcescens (inhibiting greater than 90% of these isolates at a concentration of 0.5 microgram/ml) and moderately active against pseudomonas species, other proteus species, and citrobacter freundii. sparfloxacin inhibited greater than 90% of staphylococci (including methicillin-resistant and coagulase-negative strains) at a concentration of 0.12 microgram/ml and greater than 90% of streptococci (including streptococcus pneumoniae) at a concentration of 1.0 microgram/ml. it was also active against bacillus cereus, enterococcus species, and corynebacterium jeikeium, organisms that have become fairly common in cancer patients.

TI  == primary structure of the oligo-1,6-glucosidase of bacillus cereus atcc7064 deduced from the nucleotide sequence of the cloned gene.
AB  == the gene coding for bacillus cereus atcc7064 (mesophile) oligo-1,6-glucosidase was cloned within a 2.8-kb sali-ecori fragment of dna, using the plasmid puc19 as a vector and escherichia coli c600 as a host. e. coli c600 bearing the hybrid plasmid pbce4 accumulated oligo-1,6-glucosidase in the cytoplasm. the cloned enzyme coincided absolutely with b. cereus oligo-1,6-glucosidase in its mr (65,000), in its electrophoretic behavior on a polyacrylamide gel with or without sodium dodecyl sulfate, in its isoelectric point (4.5), in the temperature dependence of its stability and activity, and in its antigenic determinants. the  nucleotide sequence of b. cereus oligo-1,6-glucosidase gene and its flanking regions was determined with both complementary strands of dna (each 2838 nucleotides). the gene consisted of an open reading frame of 1674 bp commencing with a atg start codon and followed by a taa stop codon. the amino acid sequence  deduced from the nucleotide sequence predicted a protein of 558 amino acid residues with a mr of 66,010. the amino acid composition and mr were comparable with those of b. cereus oligo-1,6-glucosidase. the predicted n-terminal sequence  of 10 amino acid residues agreed completely with that of the cloned ligo-1,6-glucosidase. the deduced amino acid sequence of b. cereus oligo-1,6-glucosidase was 72% and 42% similar to those from bacillus thermoglucosidasius kp1006 (dsm2542, obligate thermophile) oligo-1,6-glucosidase  and from saccharomyces carlsbergensis cb11 alpha-glucosidase, respectively. predictions of protein secondary structures along with amino acid sequence alignments demonstrated that b. cereus oligo-1,6-glucosidase may take the similar (alpha/beta)8-barrel super-secondary structure, a barrel of eight parallel beta-strands surrounded by eight alpha-helices, in its n-terminal active site domain as s. carlsbergensis alpha-glucosidase and aspergillus oryzae alpha-amylase.

TI  == isolation and characterization of a beta-lactamase-inhibitory protein from streptomyces clavuligerus and cloning and analysis of the corresponding gene.
AB  == culture filtrates of streptomyces clavuligerus contain a proteinaceous beta-lactamase inhibitor (blip) in addition to a variety of beta-lactam compounds. blip was first detected by its ability to inhibit bactopenase, a penicillinase derived from bacillus cereus, but it has also been shown to inhibit the plasmid puc- and chromosomally mediated beta-lactamases of escherichia coli.  blip showed no inhibitory effect against enterobacter cloacae beta-lactamase, and it also showed no activity against an alternative source of b. cereus penicillinase. blip was purified to homogeneity, and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gave a size estimate for blip of 16,900 to 18,000. the interaction between purified blip and the e. coli(puc) beta-lactamase was investigated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and determined to be noncovalent, with an estimated 1:1 molar stoichiometry. the blip gene was isolated on a 13.5-kilobase fragment of s. clavuligerus chromosomal dna which did not overlap a 40-kilobase region of dna known to contain genes for beta-lactam antibiotic biosynthesis. the gene encoded  a mature protein with a deduced amino acid sequence of 165 residues (calculated molecular weight of 17,523) and also encoded a 36-amino-acid signal sequence. no  significant sequence similarity to blip was found by pairwise comparisons using various protein and nucleotide sequence data banks or by hybridization experiments, and no blip activity was detected in the culture supernatants of other streptomyces spp.

TI  == selection and application of antibodies modifying the function of beta-lactamase.
AB  == nine monoclonal antibodies directed against class a beta-lactamases were detected and selected by a novel screening procedure based on assaying the modifications in the catalytic and stability properties of beta-lactamase in solution. unlike conventional screening, e.g., elisa or immunoprecipitation, the present method does not depend on firm binding and thus favors detection of low affinity antibodies. individual antibodies were found to affect the enzymatic activity in  various ways including stimulation, neutralization, protection and stabilization. class a beta-lactamases show only 20% among members of this class. in contrast, two of our monoclonal antibodies cross-reacted with different beta-lactamases and thus demonstrate the presence of shared structural epitopes in this class of enzymes. one of the cross-reacting antibodies was elicited by sequential immunization with two different beta-lactamases. taken together, our findings stress the importance of the screening method in antibody selection and illustrate the use of 'functional' monoclonal antibodies in the study of the structure-function relationship in an enzyme.

AB  == purification to homogeneity of the n-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidase (mucopeptide amidohydrolase, ec 3.5.1.28) from human serum has been achieved with a high yield. by molecular sieving chromatography, a molecular weight of 120,000-130,000 has been found for the native enzyme. polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under native conditions gave a unique band of mr = 125,000. the same technique performed under denaturing conditions revealed that the protein is a dimer composed of one subunit of mr = 57,000 and another of mr = 70,000. in isoelectrofocalization assays, the amidase behaved as an acidic protein. ethylenediaminetetraacetate inhibited the enzyme activity; the mg2+ requirement was confirmed. the simultaneous presence of sulfhydryl groups and disulfide bonds in the protein was evidenced by the inhibitions produced by different thiol-blocking reagents and by several thiol-bearing substances. direct measurements established the presence of two accessible thiol groups and the occurrence of nine disulfide bonds per protein molecule. studies of substrate hydrolyzing capacities showed a marked preference for the muramoyl tripeptide derived from the escherichia coli or bacillus cereus mureins, the disaccharide tetrapeptide and the bis disaccharide tetra-tetrapeptide from e. coli were also good substrates. activities on small muropeptides of other composition are also reported. whole (insoluble) peptidoglycans representing the main bacterial chemotypes were submitted to the enzyme action; although with weak specific activities, the human amidase was nevertheless able to release soluble peptides from some of them. a bacteriolytic capacity on some microorganisms cannot be excluded. results are discussed and the human enzyme is compared to presently known microbial muramoyl amidases.

AB  == a thermolabile hemolysin from leptospira interrogans serovar hardjo, strain sponselee, was shown to specifically degrade sphingomyelin. nucleotide sequence determination revealed that sphingomyelinase activity was encoded by an open reading frame of 1,668 nucleotides. although a putative signal sequence could be  identified, no evidence for protein export in either l. interrogans or escherichia coli was obtained. the apparent molecular mass of the expression product in e. coli minicells was 41.2 kilodaltons, whereas open reading frame 1 encoded a protein of 63,268 daltons. the observed difference may be explained by  processing at the carboxy-terminal part of the hemolysin in e. coli. a high degree of similarity on the dna and protein levels with staphylococcus aureus beta-hemolysin and sphingomyelinase c from three bacillus cereus strains was observed. the presence of various sphingomyelinase genes within the l. interrogans species is demonstrated.

TI  == sequencing the gene for an imipenem-cefoxitin-hydrolyzing enzyme (cfia) from bacteroides fragilis tal2480 reveals strong similarity between cfia and bacillus  cereus beta-lactamase ii.
AB  == using a newly constructed bacteroides fragilis-escherichia coli cloning shuttle vector, pjst61, we have cloned the cefoxitin (fox)-imipenem (imp) resistance determinant from b. fragilis tal2480. fox-imp resistance in this strain results from the production of a periplasmic, zn2(+)-containing beta-lactamase which hydrolyzes carbapenems and cephamycins and whose activity is resistant to clavulanic acid but sensitive to zn2(+)-binding reagents, including edta. the pjst61 vector permits efficient library construction in e. coli and allows for the transfer of the library to b. fragilis recipients for the screening or selection of specific phenotypes. the library clone containing the fox-imp resistance gene was detected after transfer to b. fragilis tm4000 (fox-imps) selecting for foxr. one of the isolates carrying plasmid pjst241 is resistant to  fox and imp and synthesizes a periplasmic protein with substrate and inhibitor properties identical to those of strain tal2480. on the basis of deletion analysis, tn1000 insertion mutations, and dna sequencing, we have defined the 747-base cfia (fox-imp resistance) gene within the 3.6-kilobase cloned insert in  pjst241. the cfia gene contains an open reading frame that could code for a precursor protein of 249 amino acids and with a molecular mass of 27,260 daltons. a potential signal sequence has been identified at the n terminus of this protein; cleavage within this sequence would result in a protein of 231 amino acids with a molecular mass of 25,249 daltons. the cfia protein shows remarkable  similarities to the exported, zn2(+)-requiring, type ii beta-lactamase blm proteins from bacillus cereus 569/h and 5/b/6. although overall amino acid identity is only 32%, the zn ligand-binding his and cys residues are precisely conserved and the amino acids in the vicinity of these sites show strong similarities (greater than 80%) when the cfia and blm proteins are compared.

AB  == the rate constants for both acylation and deacylation of beta-lactamase pc1 from  staphylococcus aureus and the rtem beta-lactamase from escherichia coli were determined by the acid-quench method [martin & waley (1988) biochem. j. 254, 923-925] with several good substrates, and, for a wider range of substrates, of beta-lactamase i from bacillus cereus. the values of the acylation and deacylation rate constants for benzylpenicillin were approximately the same (i.e. differing by no more than 2-fold) for each enzyme. the variation of kcat./km for  benzylpenicillin with the viscosity of the medium was used to obtain values for all four rate constants in the acyl-enzyme mechanism for all three enzymes. the reaction is partly diffusion-controlled, and the rate constant for the dissociation of the enzyme-substrate complex has approximately the same value as  the rate constants for acylation and deacylation. thus all three first-order rate constants have comparable values. here there is no single rate-determining step for beta-lactamase action. this is taken to be a sign of a fully efficient enzyme.

TI  == asymmetric distribution of the phosphatidylinositol-linked phospho-oligosaccharide that mimics insulin action in the plasma membrane.
AB  == we have investigated the topography of a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol implicated in insulin action by a combination of two complementary methods: (a) chemical labelling with a non-permeable (isethionyl acetimidate) and a permeable (ethyl acetimidate) probe; and (b) enzymatic modifications with beta-galactosidase (ec 3.2.1.23) or phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase c (ec 3.1.4.3). using the first approach the majority of the glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol is found in  the outer surface of intact hepatocytes, adipocytes, fibroblasts and lymphocytes, but not in erythrocytes which presented only a 20% of the total labelled glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol to the exterior. upon insulin addition (10 nm), about 60% of the total glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol was hydrolysed in both hepatocytes and adipocytes but not in erythrocytes. in agreement with the extracellular localization in hepatocytes and with the proposed role of this glycolipid in insulin action, treatment of rat hepatocytes with beta-galactosidase from escherichia coli, an enzyme that hydrolyses the oligosaccharide moiety of the glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol, cleaved 65% of the total glycophospholipid and blocked the effect of insulin (but not of glucagon) on pyruvate kinase (ec 2.7.1.40). similar treatment with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase c from bacillus cereus hydrolysed 62% of the total glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol. from the various approaches used it is concluded that the majority of this glycophospholipid is at the outer surface  in a variety of insulin-sensitive cells.

TI  == reactivation of peptidoglycan synthesis in ether-permeabilized escherichia coli after inhibition by beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  == the recovery of peptidoglycan-synthesizing activity after inhibition by beta-lactam antibiotics was investigated in ether-permeabilized cells of escherichia coli b. such cells synthesize sodium dodecyl sulfate-insoluble peptidoglycan when provided with udp-linked precursors and mg2+. the ability of beta-lactam antibiotics to inhibit the synthesis of peptidoglycan was correlated  with their affinity for penicillin-binding proteins 1a and 1bs. penicillin-binding protein 1bs is thought to be the major peptidoglycan synthetase in e. coli and is a major lethal target for beta-lactam antibiotics. ether-treated bacteria were preincubated with concentrations of beta-lactams sufficient to completely inhibit peptidoglycan synthesis and then treated with beta-lactamases to inactivate free antibiotic prior to measurement of peptidoglycan synthesis. at 40 min after beta-lactamase treatment, the rate of peptidoglycan synthesis was about 74% of the control rate in cells pretreated with ampicillin, but only 15% of the control in cells pretreated with penicillin  g or azlocillin. reversal of inhibition by several other antibiotics fell between these extremes. when cross-linking of peptidoglycan was measured specifically, reversal of inhibition by ampicillin also occurred more readily than that by penicillin g. reactivation of peptidoglycan synthesis was not due to de novo synthesis of penicillin-binding proteins since it occurred under conditions that  did not allow incorporation of [14c]leucine. we conclude that there is considerable variation in the stability of the inactive acyl enzymes formed between various beta-lactams and penicillin-binding protein 1bs, with those formed by penicillin g being relatively long-lived.

TI  == specificity of bacillus thuringiensis for lepidopteran larvae: factors involved in vivo and in the structure of a purified protoxin.
AB  == the relative ld50 values in two test lepidoptera of bacillus thuringiensis subspecies kurstaki hd1, which contains three cryla protoxin genes, was the same  as a plasmid-cured derivative or a bacillus cereus transcipient containing only one of the three genes. differential rates of transcription of these genes in the original strain could account, at least partly, for this result. strains containing only the single protoxin gene (cryla(b] produced inclusions when grown at 25 degrees c but not 32 degrees c, despite transcription of this gene at both  temperatures. the instability of the cryla(b) protoxin was not found in the parental b. thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki hd1 strain grown at either temperature, however, so kurstaki hd1 strains with multiple protoxin genes must produce some stabilizing factor, perhaps another protoxin. the cryl protoxins contain a highly conserved carboxyl half which is proteolytically removed upon conversion to toxin. all of the protoxin cysteines are present in protease-sensitive regions and they are oxidized in inclusions. most of the disulphides appear to be essential for specificity since their reduction in the cryla(b) protoxin resulted in loss of selectivity for one of the test insects. this lack of specificity was  also found for this protoxin produced by an escherichia coli clone, probably because of the reducing conditions in these cells. specificity was restored by reoxidation of the pure protoxin, by removal of the carboxyl half of oxidized protoxin with trypsin, or by subcloning of the toxin portion. the oxidized form of protoxins must be important for specificity, for the formation of crystalline  inclusions, and probably for interactions required for the stabilization of some  protoxins.

AB  == following inoculation into cottage cheese varieties with and without sorbic acid, obtained directly from the manufacturer, strains of enteropathogenic escherichia  coli and other e. coli survived but failed to multiply during storage at 7, 10 or 25 degrees c. in the absence of sorbic acid spoilage due to pseudomonas fluorescens occurred after storage for 5-13 days at 7 or 10 degrees c and 1-2 days at 25 degrees c. salmonella enteritidis, s. hadar, s. saint-paul, s. typhimurium and s. virchow survived but failed to multiply at 10 degrees c and, in the case of most strains, at 20 or 25 degrees c. s. typhimurium multiplied 100-fold in one batch of cottage cheese with peppers and onion in the absence of  sorbic acid during storage at 25 degrees c for 2 days; spoilage of this batch occurred due to yeasts or yeasts and moulds after storage for 4-8 days at 10 degrees c and 0-2 days at 20 or 25 degrees c. following inoculation into cottage  cheese varieties, prepared in the laboratory and which did not contain sorbic acid, as contaminants of the added protein or vegetable ingredients the numbers of staphylococcus aureus declined during storage at 10 and 20 degrees c, the numbers of bacillus cereus and s. typhimurium increased at both temperatures, and the numbers of yersinia enterocolitica increased at 10 degrees c, but declined at 20 degrees c. spoilage occurred due to the growth of moulds and p. fluorescens after storage for 5-14 days at 10 degrees c, and due to p. fluorescens after storage for up to 2 days at 20 degrees c. in products inoculated in a similar way but which contained sorbic acid (500-530 mg/kg), the numbers of s. aureus and b.  cereus declined and in most products the numbers of s. typhimurium and y. enterocolitica remained constant. in cottage cheese with chicken, however, the numbers of y. enterocolitica increased 100-fold during storage of the product for 14 days at 10 degrees and the numbers of s. typhimurium increased 100-fold during storage for 2 days at 20 degrees c. spoilage of this product due to p. fluorescens occurred after storage for 8-14 days at 10 degrees c, but was not evident at 20 degrees c after 2 days.

TI  == phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase c of bacillus cereus: cloning, sequencing, and relationship to other phospholipases.
AB  == the phosphatidylinositol (pi)-specific phospholipase c (plc) of bacillus cereus was cloned into escherichia coli by using monoclonal antibody probes raised against the purified protein. the enzyme is specific for hydrolysis of the membrane lipid pi and pi-glycan-containing membrane anchors, which are important  structural components of one class of membrane proteins. the protein expressed in e. coli comigrated with b. cereus pi-plc in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, as detected by immunoblotting, and conferred pi-plc activity on the host. this enzyme activity was inhibited by pi-plc-specific monoclonal antibodies. the nucleotide sequence of the pi-plc gene suggests that this secreted bacterial protein is synthesized as a larger precursor with a 31-amino-acid n-terminal extension to the mature enzyme of 298 amino acids. from  analysis of coding and flanking sequences of the gene, we conclude that the pi-plc gene does not reside next to the gene cluster of the other two secreted phospholipases c on the bacterial chromosome. the deduced amino acid sequence of  the b. cereus pi-plc contains a stretch of significant similarity to the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-specific plc of trypanosoma brucei. the conserved peptide is proposed to play a role in the function of these enzymes.

TI  == studies on the cellular defense reactions of the madeira cockroach, leucophaea maderae: nodule formation in response to injected bacteria.
AB  == nodules were formed in the madeira cockroach, leucophaea maderae, in response to  injections of low doses (3 x 10(4) bacteria/insect) of three strains of bacillus  cereus and escherichia coli k12 d31. the most pathogenic strain of bacteria used, b. cereus b1, produced the greatest cellular response, while the least pathogenic, e. coli k12 d31, injected at the same dose, caused little nodule formation. similarly, nodules were generally found to be larger following injection of pathogenic bacteria such as b. cereus b1 than to the weak pathogen,  e. coli k12 d31. there was, however, no difference in the extent of nodule formation with the four bacterial strains/species if they were heat killed prior  to injection. histologically, the nodules formed in response to all bacterial species employed were similar, with a central necrotic core enclosing cell debris and occasional bacteria, and an outer, thin sheath of plasmatocyte-like hemocytes. possible reasons for the enhanced cellular reactivity observed in l. maderae to pathogenic bacteria are discussed.

TI  == nucleotide sequence of the glutamine synthetase gene (glna) and its upstream region from bacillus cereus.
AB  == we have determined the complete nucleotide sequence of a 2.4 kb chromosomal ecot22i-nspv fragment, containing the bacillus cereus glna gene (structural gene  of glutamine synthetase). the deduced amino acid sequence indicates that the glutamine synthetase subunit consists of 444 amino acid residues (50,063 da). comparisons are made with reported amino acid sequences of glutamine synthetases  from other bacteria. upstrem of glna we found an open reading frame of 129 codons (orf129) preceded by the consensus sequence for a typical promoter. maxicell experiments showed two polypeptide bands, with molecular weights in good agreement with that of glutamine synthetase and that of orf129, in addition to vector-coded protein. it is possible that the product of this open reading frame  upstream of glna has a regulatory role in glutamine synthetase expression.

AB  == random in vitro mutagenesis of a cloned bacillus cereus 5/b/6 beta-lactamase ii gene was used to select defective genes unable to confer ampicillin or cephalosporin c resistance to escherichia coli. dna sequencing of mutant genes identified histidine at position 28 as important to beta-lactamase ii function. in addition, the isolation of six identical frameshift mutants established that the carboxyl-terminal end of beta-lactamase ii is critical for enzyme function. random mutagenesis also revealed that his88 (implicated previously as one of 4 residues acting as a zinc ligand) is crucial to enzymatic activity and that a glycine to glutamic acid substitution at position 148 produced a defective beta-lactamase. oligonucleotide mutagenesis directed at glu37 and glu212 suggests that these residues are inconsequential to enzyme function but that histidine at  position 28 may be involved in substrate binding or recognition.

TI  == efficient transformation of bacillus thuringiensis and b. cereus via electroporation: transformation of acrystalliferous strains with a cloned delta-endotoxin gene.
AB  == electroporation was used as a method to transform intact cells of bacillus thuringiensis and b. cereus. with our optimized method a range of plasmid vectors could be transformed into strains of b. thuringiensis at frequencies of up to 10(7) transformants/micrograms dna. this high frequency allows cloning experiments to be done directly in b. thuringiensis. a bifunctional vector capable of replicating in escherichia coli and in bacillus spp. was constructed.  the kurhd1 protoxin gene was cloned into this shuttle vector to produce plasmid px193, then transformed into b. thuringiensis hd1 cryb and b. cereus 569k. the cloned protoxin gene was expressed in sporulating cultures of both strain hd1 cryb (px193) and 569k (pxi93), producing crystal protein active in biotests against larvae of heliothis virescens. this demonstrates the usefulness of the electroporation method for the introduction of cloned toxin genes, in either their native or modified form, into a variety of host strains.

TI  == phospholipase c and haemolytic activities of clostridium perfringens alpha-toxin  cloned in escherichia coli: sequence and homology with a bacillus cereus phospholipase c.
AB  == the clostridium perfringens alpha-toxin (phospholipase c) gene (cpa) has been cloned and expressed in escherichia coli. the biological activities of the cloned gene product have been analysed and the complete nucleotide sequence of the cpa gene has been determined. the cloned cpa gene product, which is exported to the periplasm in e. coli, possesses both phospholipase c and haemolytic activities. haemolysis is not apparent when cell extracts are incubated with isotonic suspensions of sheep erythrocytes, but can be detected and quantified readily when dilutions of the same extracts are placed in wells in sheep-blood agar plates. like other sequenced clostridial genes, the cpa gene has a high at content (66.4%), exhibits a strong bias for using codons with a or t in the wobble position, and the 350 base pairs upstream from the gene have a significantly higher at content (79.5%) than the coding region. the cpa gene encodes a 398 amino acid polypeptide with a deduced molecular weight of 45,481 d. this is very similar to the estimated molecular weight (mr) of the cpa primary gene product expressed in an in vitro transcription-translation system (mr 46,000), but larger than the cpa gene product detected in e. coli minicells, e. coli whole cells or in c. perfringens cells (mr 43,000), suggesting post-translational processing. the 28 n-terminal residues of the deduced alpha-toxin sequence possess the consensus features of a signal peptide and may be removed during secretion. the deduced alpha-toxin sequence shares significant  structural homology with the phosphatidylcholine-preferring phospholipase c of bacillus cereus.

AB  == a fragment of dna containing the gene coding for the phospholipase c (alpha-toxin) of clostridium perfringens was cloned into escherichia coli. the cloned dna appeared to code only for the alpha-toxin and contained both the coding region and its associated gene promoter. the nucleotide sequence of the cloned dna was determined, and an open reading frame was identified which encoded a protein with a molecular weight of 42,528. by comparison of the gene sequence with the n-terminal amino acid sequence of the protein, a 28-amino-acid signal sequence was identified. the gene promoter showed considerable homology with the  e. coli sigma 55 consensus promoter sequences, and this may explain why the gene  was expressed by e. coli. the cloned gene product appeared to be virtually identical to the native protein. a 77-amino-acid stretch that was close to the n  terminus of the alpha-toxin showed considerable homology with similarly located regions of the bacillus cereus phosphatidylcholine, preferring phospholipase c and weaker homology with the phospholipase c from pseudomonas aeruginosa.

AB  == the capability of potassium clavulanate to protect amoxycillin from destruction by three partially purified beta-lactamases (from e. cloacae, b. cereus 569/h9 and e. coli r-tem) was evaluated. the enzymatic inhibition was determined spectrophotometrically by assessing the ability of either amoxycillin or potassium clavulanate or their combination (at a 7:1 ratio by weight) to prevent  the hydrolysis of a chromogenic substrate (nitrocefin) after different pre-incubation times, thus determining the ic50 and ki values. potassium clavulanate significantly reduced the ic50 values of amoxycillin for b. cereus and tem enzymes by a factor ranging from 500 to 1200, by inhibiting these beta-lactamases at concentrations ranging from 4 to 0.008 microm. however, clavulanic acid was quite ineffective against type i enzymes (from e. cloacae), while amoxycillin was found to be sufficiently stable (ic50 of 0.8-1.4 microm).

AB  == the work was aimed at studying the effect of cationic, anionic and non-ionogenic  surfactants on the frequency dependence of the electroorientation effect (eoe) and on the electrophoretic mobility (epm) of rod-like bacteria. the character of  concentration dependences was found to differ for eoe and epm at a low frequency  of the electric field (20 to 10(4) hz). analysis of eoe changes at a high frequency (4 x 10(5) to 3 x 10(7) hz) showed that anionic and non-ionogenic surfactants at a concentration up to 10(-3) m did not damage escherichia coli, a  gram-negative bacterium, in contrast to bacillus cereus, a gram-positive bacterium. cationic surfactants affected the cells of the both species. the optical properties of bacterial cells were found to change under the action of cationic surfactants.

TI  == lethal effect of butylated hydroxyanisole as related to bacterial fatty acid composition.
AB  == bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas fluorescens, pseudomonas fragi, escherichia coli, and salmonella "anatum" were challenged with butylated hydroxyanisole (bha). susceptibility was measured as the concentration of bha required to cause a 90% reduction in bacterial survivors. staphylococcus aureus lp and p. fragi were two of the most resistant species examined; c. perfringens and p. fluorescens were the most susceptible. gram stain reaction was found not to be a strict indicator of bacterial susceptibility to bha. there was no obvious relationship between individual fatty acids and susceptibility. the ratio of saturated to unsaturated fatty acids in the total lipid fraction of only the gram-positive species was related to susceptibility. the ratios of saturated to unsaturated fatty acids of other fractions were not related to susceptibility.

TI  == differential scanning calorimetry of bacteria.
AB  == thermograms obtained by differential scanning calorimetry of a range of bacteria  of different heat resistances were compared. equations were derived to calculate  the rate at which the numbers of viable organisms in a calorimeter decline as the temperature is raised at a constant rate. vegetative bacteria scanned at 10 degrees c min-1 showed multi-peaked thermograms with four major peaks (denoted m, n, p and q) occurring in the regions 68-73, 77-84, 89-99 and 105-110 degrees c respectively. exceptions were that peak m (the largest peak) occurred at 79-82 degrees c in bacillus stearothermophilus and an additional peak, r, was detected  in escherichia coli at 119 degrees c. at temperatures below the main peak m there were major differences in thermograms between species. there was a direct relationship between the onset of thermal denaturation and the thermoresistance of different organisms. heat-sensitive organisms displayed thermogram features which were absent in the more heat-resistant types. when samples were cooled to 5 degrees c and re-heated, a small endothermic peak, pr, was observed at the same temperature as p. peaks p and pr were identified as the melting endotherms of dna. in all vegetative organisms examined, maximum death rates, computed from published d and z values, occurred at temperatures above the onset of thermal denaturation, i.e. cell death and irreversible denaturation of cell components occurred within the same temperature range.

TI  == intestinal carriage of bacillus cereus: faecal isolation studies in three population groups.
AB  == the results of examinations of stools for bacillus cereus among three unrelated groups of individuals are presented. the groups consisted of (1) healthy school-children aged 6-11 years in a rural region of south africa examined during each of the four seasons of the year; (2) 15 healthy volunteers comprising staff  of a london microbiology laboratory and their families examined on each of 3 consecutive weeks; (3) 75 unrelated young children, 2 months to 5 years of age, in a second rural region of south africa examined during a pilot study of 1 week's duration on the aetiology of rural gastroenteritis. the stools of the last group were submitted as being related to present or recent diarrhoea in the respective children. in group 1, b. cereus isolation rates ranged from 24.3% at the autumn visit to 43% at the summer visit with a significantly higher rate of isolation in the summer than at other seasons of the year (p less than 0.05). b.  cereus was isolated from 40% of group 2 volunteers on week 1, none on week 2 and  20% on week 3. the organism was detected in the 12 positive specimens at levels of approximately 10(2)/g and constituted 2.5-30% of the total aerobic spore-forming bacillus population in the stools. in group 3, b. cereus was recovered from 18.7% of the stool samples and was isolated consecutively with other pathogens (enteropathogenic escherichia coli and rotavirus) on only five occasions. in groups 1 and 3, less than 5% of the stools had '3+' levels of b. cereus (greater than 10 colonies per direct plate culture). b. cereus was readily isolated from all of 10 food samples, representative of the typical diet of the group 1 individuals, and was present in substantial numbers (10(4) to 5.5 x 10(6)/g) in half of them. the isolation results, supported by serotyping, indicated that carriage of b. cereus in stools is transient and its presence at any one time reflects solely its intake with foods.

TI  == cloning and sequencing of the metallothioprotein beta-lactamase ii gene of bacillus cereus 569/h in escherichia coli.
AB  == the structural gene for beta-lactamase ii (ec 3.5.2.6), a metallothioenzyme, from bacillus cereus 569/h (constitutive for high production of the enzyme) was cloned in escherichia coli, and the nucleotide sequence was determined. this is the first class b beta-lactamase whose primary structure has been reported. the amino acid sequence of the exoenzyme form, deduced from the dna, indicates that beta-lactamase ii, like other secreted proteins, is synthesized as a precursor with a 30-amino acid n-terminal signal peptide. the pre-beta-lactamase ii (mr, 28,060) is processed in e. coli and in b. cereus to a single mature protein (mr,  24,932) which is totally secreted by b. cereus but in e. coli remains intracellular, probably in the periplasm. the expression of the gene in e. coli rr1 on the multicopy plasmid prwho12 was comparable to that in b. cereus, where it is presumably present as a single copy. the three histidine residues that are  involved (along with the sole cysteine of the mature protein) in zn(ii) binding and hence in enzymatic activity against beta-lactams were identified. these findings will help to define the secondary structure, mechanism of action, and evolutionary lineage of b. cereus beta-lactamase ii and other class b beta-lactamases.

AB  == a 75-kilobase plasmid from bacillus thuringiensis var. kurstaki (hd-244) was associated with the k-73 type insecticidal crystal protein production by mating into b. cereus and subsequent curing of excess plasmids. this plasmid was partially digested with endonuclease r . sau3a and the fragments were cloned into escherichia coli (hb101) on vector pbr322. candidate clones were screened for plasmid vectors which contained the expected insert size (at least 3 kilobases) and then with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, using antisera prepared against electrophoretically purified, solubilized insecticidal crystal protein of 130,000 daltons. several positive clones were isolated and were analyzed for expression, toxicity, and genetic content by restriction enzyme analysis. electrophoretic transfer blots of proteins from a candidate e. coli clone, analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, demonstrated a predominant cross-reacting protein of about 140,000 daltons. ouchterlony analysis also showed a single precipitin band. extensive bioassays with manduca sexta larvae revealed  that the e. coli clones make toxin with a specific activity (50% lethal dose per  microgram of cross-reacting protein) equivalent to that of the parental b. thuringiensis strain or a b. cereus trancipient carrying the toxin-encoding, 75-kilobase plasmid.

TI  == murine monoclonal anti-dna autoantibodies bind to endogenous bacteria.
AB  == several bacterial species (including streptococcus faecalis, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, and escherichia coli) were tested for their ability to react with monoclonal anti-dna antibodies that were derived from mrl-lpr/lpr mice. s. faecalis reacted with 8/15 of such antibodies. the binding was unaffected by dnase, but it was competitively inhibited by dna. f(ab')2 fragments of the monoclonal antibodies reacted with the bacteria, but fc fragments did not. phospholipids extracted from the bacterial cells were able to bind to three representative anti-dna antibodies that also bound to whole bacteria. the results suggest that bacterial phospholipids might provide an immunogenic stimulus for the production of antibodies that cross-react with dna. we propose that some anti-dna auto-antibodies and anti-bacterial antibodies evolve from a restricted group of antibodies with high avidity for the phosphodiester groups that occur in dna and bacterial cells walls.

TI  == cloning and sequencing of the beta-lactamase i gene of bacillus cereus 5/b and its expression in bacillus subtilis.
AB  == the beta-lactamases of bacillus cereus have attracted interest because they are secreted efficiently, because multiple enzymes are frequently present, and because their regulation has unusual features. beta-lactamase i of strain 5/b is  produced constitutively at a high level, and the exoenzyme appears to be several  thousand daltons larger than the corresponding product of strain 569/h. we have cloned the gene for 5/b beta-lactamase i in escherichia coli and b. subtilis and  have sequenced the structural portion and the regulatory regions. the 5/b enzyme  is produced at a low level in e. coli rr1(prwy200) and remains cellbound. in b. subtilis it is formed in large amounts, and over 90% of it is released into the medium. there is a large degree of homology between the promoter and leader peptide regions of the 5/b and 569/h genes; both utilize uug as the translation initiation codon (p. s. f. mezes, r. w. blacher, and j. o. lampen, (j. biol. chem. 260:1218-1223, 1985). although there are significant differences in the peptide segment where processing would be expected to occur, the nh2 terminus of  the major 5/b product from b. subtilis bd170(prwy215) is his-44, which is the same as the nh2 terminus of the major 569/h product from b. subtilis bd170(prwm5).

AB  == in a 12-month survey (june 1982-may 1983) 41 laboratories examined 2493 samples of goat's milk for colony counts and the presence of pathogens. the statutory tests for cow's milk were also applied. surface counts of less than 10(5) organisms per ml of raw milk were given by 79% of samples at 37 degrees c and by  76% at 22 degrees c. there were less than 100 coliforms per ml in 71% of samples, less than 10 escherichia coli per ml in 91%. staphylococcus aureus was not detected in countable numbers in 96% of samples. only one isolation of campylobacter was made and two of yersinia enterocolitica. salmonella was not detected in 2462 samples. the methylene blue test was carried out on 2368 samples and 86.7% were deemed satisfactory. no sample was brucella ring-test-positive. experiments on the survival and growth of six food poisoning organisms in stored  goat's milk showed that bacillus cereus, staph. aureus, salmonella typhimurium and y. enterocolitica survived quite well and multiplied at the higher storage temperature of 30 degrees c. clostridium perfringens only increased 10- to 100-fold while campylobacter jejuni did not grow. the results of the survey indicate that any problems with goat's milk relate to poor hygiene during production rather than transmission of organisms from the goat herself.

TI  == processing of bacillus cereus 569/h beta-lactamase i in escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis.
AB  == the gene for bacillus cereus 569/h beta-lactamase i, penpc, has recently been cloned and sequenced (mezes, p. s. f., yang, y. q., hussain, m., and lampen, j. o. (1983) febs lett. 161, 195-200). a typical prokaryotic signal peptide but with no lipoprotein modification site, as present in the bacillus licheniformis 749/c  beta-lactamase, was indicated by the dna sequence for this secretory protein. we  have here purified the beta-lactamase i products found in escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis carrying penpc and have determined the first 20 nh2-terminal amino acids of each of the forms. processing of the beta-lactamase i in e. coli occurs at a single site which is characteristic for cleavage by a signal peptidase. b. subtilis secreted two distinct products to the culture medium which were both smaller than the single product formed in e. coli. sequencing of [35s]met-labeled pre-beta-lactamase i from phenylethyl alcohol-treated cells of b. cereus 569/h indicated that uug is being utilized as the initiation codon for  penpc. the same result was obtained for the pre-beta-lactamase i from similarly treated cells of the closely related b. cereus 5/b strain.

TI  == comparative study of the nature and biological activities of bacterial enterotoxins.
AB  == it is apparent that there are considerable similarities between many of the enterotoxins produced by enteric pathogens. although the effect of most of these  toxins is restricted to the intestine in vivo, many cells are also sensitive to intoxication in vitro. the resultant in-vitro biochemical changes may have no pathological significance but serve to underline the central role of cyclic nucleotides in cellular fluid regulation. the biological activity of these enterotoxins is the result of interaction with membrane-bound adenylate cyclase,  leading to persistent elevation of intracellular levels of camp. stimulation of adenylate cyclase occurs consistently after a characteristic lag phase which varies somewhat between toxins. the duration and degree of stimulation of adenylate cyclase by the various toxins may point to possible differences in affinity, dissociation and mechanism of activation of the cyclase molecule. subtle events at, or within, the cell membrane must occur during intoxication and may include complex associations of toxin with membrane lipid and protein components. the heat-labile toxins of v. cholerae, e. coli, salmonella spp., a. hydrophila and y. enterocolitica have much in common in their structures, membrane receptors and biochemical modes of action. similarly the heat-stable toxins of e. coli and y. enterocolitica, match each other in their biological activities. classified along with the enterotoxin of c. perfringens, the enterotoxin produced by sh. dysenteriae (and possibly some strains of e. coli) appears to differ from the other enterotoxins by acting on protein biosynthesis primarily and not on the nucleotide cyclase activation systems. in another category must be placed the various enterotoxins produced by staph. aureus until  more is known. surprisingly little research has been directed towards the elucidation of their mode of action, although much is known of their serological  and structural differences. evidence to date suggests that staphylococcal enterotoxins differ from the other diarrhoeagenic agents discussed in this review. the structural and immunological similarities between the various heat-labile enterotoxins suggest a common genetic origin with gene transfer between the different bacterial species being responsible for the spread of enterotoxigenicity. it is possible that many of the "newer" enterotoxins owe their origin to genetic recombination with the "older" enteropathogens like v. cholerae.

TI  == beta-lactamase-catalyzed hydrolysis of acyclic depsipeptides and acyl transfer to specific amino acid acceptors.
AB  == beta-lactamases from all three classes, a, b, and c, catalyze the hydrolysis of specific acyclic depsipeptide (phch2conhcr1r2co2chr3co2h) analogs of acyl-d-alanyl-d-alanine peptides. the depsipeptides investigated, which are chemically as reactive toward nucleophiles as penicillins, are in general poor substrates, although differences between the classes of beta-lactamases have been observed: the order of effectiveness seems to be c greater than b greater than a. certain class a and c beta-lactamases also catalyze phenylacetylglycyl transfer between phenylacetylglycyl depsipeptides and specific amino acid acceptors, a type of reaction hitherto identified more closely with d-alanyl-d-alanine transpeptidases than with beta-lactamases. preliminary indications of an acyl-enzyme intermediate in these reactions have been obtained. these results support the suggestion [tipper, d.j. and strominger, j.l. (1965) proc. natl. acad. sci. usa 54, 1133-1141] that beta-lactamases are evolutionary descendants of bacterial cell wall d-alanyl-d-alanine transpeptidases.

AB  == from a cosmid gene bank of bacillus cereus gp4 in escherichia coli we isolated clones which, after several days of incubation, formed hemolysis zones on erythrocyte agar plates. these clones contained recombinant cosmids with b. cereus dna insertions of varying lengths which shared some common restriction fragments. the smallest insertion was recloned as a psti fragment into pjkk3-1, a shuttle vector which replicates in bacillus subtilis and e. coli. when this recombinant plasmid (pjkk3-1 hly-1) was transformed into e. coli, it caused hemolysis on erythrocyte agar plates, but in liquid assays no external or internal hemolytic activity could be detected with the e. coli transformants. b.  subtilis carrying the same plasmid exhibited hemolytic activity at levels comparable to those of the b. cereus donor strain. the hemolysin produced in b. subtilis seemed to be indistinguishable from cereolysin in its sensitivity to cholesterol, activation by dithiothreitol, and inactivation by antibodies raised  against cereolysin. when the recombinant dna carrying the cereolysin gene was used as a probe in hybridization experiments with chromosomal dna from a streptolysin o-producing strain of streptococcus pyogenes or from listeriolysin-producing strains of listeria monocytogenes, no positive hybridization signals were obtained. these data suggest that the genes for these  three sh-activated cytolysins do not have extended sequence homology.

AB  == the minimum inhibitory concentration of sorbic acid has been determined for bacillus subtilis, bacillus cereus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus and candida albicans. the inhibition was shown to be due to both undissociated and dissociated acid, and the effect of each has been calculated in accordance with a proposed mathematical model. although the inhibitory action of undissociated acid was 10-600 times greater than that of dissociated acid, the latter caused more than 50% of the growth inhibition at ph  levels above 6 for most of the organisms tested.

TI  == recent advances in management of bacterial diarrhea.
AB  == the number of recognized infectious causes of diarrhea potentially treatable with specific antibiotics has markedly increased within the past ten years. laboratories are developing and expanding their abilities to deal with these new  pathogens. neither prophylaxis nor specific treatment of diarrhea in travelers is simple, practical, and safe. although enterotoxigenic escherichia coli is the most important cause of diarrhea in u.s. travelers to tropical areas, campylobacter jejuni causes acute diarrhea in persons in the united states about  as often as do salmonella and shigella. vibrio parahemolyticus is an important cause of outbreaks of gastroenteritis following ingestion of improperly cooked shellfish; bacillus cereus is important in outbreaks of diarrhea after ingestion  of improperly cooked and stored rice in chinese restaurants. although yersinia enterocolitica is probably an important cause of severe enteritis in the united states, imperfect techniques for its isolation and lack of good serologic tests have hampered recognition of its importance. practical means for diagnosing antibiotic-associated colitis and the role of clostridium difficile toxins in this disease are now available. vancomycin, metronidazole, bacitracin, and cholestyramine are useful in treatment of antibiotic-associated colitis.

TI  == evaluation of the direct epifluorescent filter technique for assessing the hygienic condition of milking equipment.
AB  == the hygienic condition of 6 milking installations, 3 sanitized by circulation cleaning (cc) with chlorine-based chemicals and 3 by flushing with acidified boiling water (abw), was tested using rinses of quarter strength ringer's solution. the bacterial content of the rinses was determined using both colony counts and the direct epifluorescent filter technique (deft). a comparison of testing methods gave correlation coefficients between colony count and deft of 0.82 for plants using cc and 0.46 for plants using abw. five strains of bacteria  belonging to different genera and commonly found on milking equipment were exposed to various degrees of heat and to various concentrations of chlorine. the effects of such treatments on the staining characteristics of the organisms were  studied. it was observed that staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus lactis, although killed by heat treatment, stained a bright orange when treated with acridine orange dye. pseudomonas fluorescens, escherichia coli and vegetative cells of bacillus cereus did not take up the orange stain after heat treatment, nor did any of the 5 strains stain orange after treatment with naocl. it is suggested that the deft is a useful and rapid means of counting bacteria in rinses of equipment where sterilization is due primarily to chlorination, but in  the absence of a stain which can differentiate more accurately between dead and living organisms its use is limited where sterilization is carried out solely by  heat.

TI  == what do beta-lactamases mean for clinical efficacy?
AB  == beta-lactamases have proved to be extremely important in influencing therapy with penicillins and cephalosporins against gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic species. both plasmid mediated beta-lactamases which are primarily  of a constitutive penicillinase type and the inducible chromosomal enzymes which  are primarily cephalosporinases are important. the use of penicillins to treat haemophilus, neisseria gonorrhoeae, escherichia coli, klebsiella, salmonella, shigella and pseudomonas infections must be based upon the relative incidence of  beta-lactamase producing strains. in the same manner cephalosporins can be used to treat infections due to enterobacter, serratia and bacteroides only if the compounds are beta-lactamase stable and not good inducers of beta-lactamase activity. although altered permeability is important in the resistance of some pseudomonas and enterobacter to beta-lactams, the resistance really is due to a combination of reduced entry of molecules and strategically placed beta-lactamases. it is only in some streptococcus pneumoniae, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus faecalis strains that altered penicillin-binding proteins make a significant contribution to the resistance to beta-lactams. beta-lactamases will continue to be the most important factor in clinically significant resistance of bacteria to both penicillins and cephalosporins.

TI  == glyceride-cysteine lipoproteins and secretion by gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == the membrane penicillinases of bacillus licheniformis and bacillus cereus are lipoproteins with n-terminal glyceride thioether modification identical to that of the escherichia coli outer membrane lipoprotein. they are readily labeled with [3h]palmitate present during exponential growth. at the same time, a few other proteins in each organism become labeled and can be detected by fluorography after sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of total membrane proteins. we distinguish these proteins from the o-acyl proteolipids by demonstrating the formation of glyceryl cysteine sulfone after performic acid oxidation and hydrolysis of the protein. by this criterion, b. licheniformis and  b. cereus contain sets of lipoproteins larger in average molecular weight than that of e. coli. members of the sets probably are under a variety of physiological controls, as indicated by widely differing relative labeling intensity in different media. the set in b. licheniformis shares with membrane penicillinase a sensitivity to release from protoplasts by mild trypsin treatment, which suggests similar orientation on the outside of the membrane. at  least one protein is the membrane-bound partner of an extracellular hydrophilic protein, the pair being related as membrane and exopenicillinases are. we propose that the lipoproteins of gram-positive organisms are the functional equivalent of periplasmic proteins in e. coli and other gram-negative bacteria, prevented from  release by anchorage to the membrane rather than by a selectively impermeable outer membrane.

TI  == membrane-bound penicillinases in gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == the penicillinases of bacillus licheniformis, bacillus cereus, and staphylococcus aureus are related in structure and cellular localization to one another more closely than they are to penicillinases from gram-negative organisms. in the latter, penicillinases are almost exclusively found in the periplasm, while the gram-positive bacteria retain a substantial proportion as hydrophobic membrane-bound forms. we recently showed (nielsen, j. b. k., caulfield, m. p., and lampen, j. o. (1981) proc. natl. acad. sci. u. s. a. 78, 3511-3515) that b. licheniformis membrane attachment was achieved through a glyceride thioether modification identical to that in several gram-negative outer membrane proteins.  we now report that the membrane penicillinases of s. aureus and b. cereus also possess the modification. we do this by demonstrating isotopic labeling of these  forms of [3h]palmitate, by showing that they exhibit the same response to the antibiotic globomycin which appears to inhibit processing steps specifically involving the glyceride thioether in escherichia coli outer membrane proteins, and lastly by isolating glyceryl cysteine sulfone, the oxidation product of the modified cysteine residue. by comparing the modification-susceptible signal sequences of gram-positive penicillinases and of gram-negative outer membrane proteins with those of nonmodified gram-negative penicillinases, we describe in increased detail the structural features within the signal sequence that allow modification and cleavage resulting in membrane anchorage.

AB  == a simple method is described for measuring the profile of bacterial colonies. profiles were determined for colonies of bacillus cereus, escherichia coli and staphylococcus albus of different ages. in spite of differences in cell morphology, the colony profiles had a common basic structure consisting of steeply rising leading edge connected by a ridge to an interior region where height also rose, though less steeply, to a flat or domed centre. the colony mass increased exponentially through part of the growth phase. it is suggested that net colony growth consists of a combination of leading edge growth, which is unrestricted and approaches the maximum specific growth rate of the organism, and diffusion-limited growth in the colony interior. common elements of profiles from each species may be a consequence of such differences in growth rate.

TI  == septicemia in children with cancer.
AB  == because of the persistently high mortality from sepsis in cancer patients, a retrospective study was designed to identify the causative organisms and to determine the factors affecting the outcome of sepsis. a total of 84 episodes of  septicemia in 61 children with cancer were studied. the more frequently isolated  organisms were: staphylococcus aureus (21.4%); escherichia coli (18%); klebsiella (7.1%); pseudomonas (6%); and bacteroides fragilis (6%). other isolates included  proteus, serratia, acinetobacter, hemolytic streptococcus, and bacillus cereus. in 10.7% of septic episodes, mixed bacterial infections were documented. twenty-four (28.6%) resulted in death; in 13 (54%) death occurred within 24 hours after admission. the fatality rate was high in cases associated with absolute polymorphonuclear leukocyte counts of less than 100/cu mm, in neoplastic relapse, and when infection with gram-negative, anaerobic and mixed bacterial flora occurred.

AB  == hundred twenty three samples of bull semen fluid frozen at 196 degrees c including 83 plastic ampules, 20 granules and 20 plastic straws obtained from the containers of the insemination stations of 10 farms from the sofia district were  investigated. two hundred twelve strains were isolated and identified as: escherichia coli--25 strains, hafnia--16 strains, citrobacter, enterobacter and proteus mirabilis--9 strains of each. the remaining gram-negative genera and species were more rarely encountered. gram positive bacteria: micrococcus--19 strains, staphylococcus aureus--17 strains, staph. epidermidis--15 strains, bacillus cereus--15 strains, b. subtilis--12 strains. other representatives of gram-positive bacteria were also found but in lower percentages. least bacteria were observed in semen fluid frozen in plastic straws and most--in plastic ampules which were mainly used until recently for cow insemination. it was established that the same bacteria isolated by other authors from fresh sperm were encountered in semen fluid stored at minus temperatures. the conclusion is made that semen fluid stored at low temperature is contaminated with bacteria. it is only natural that these bacteria are introduced in cow genitals by insemination.

TI  == infant foods as a potential source of diarrhoeal illness in rural west africa.
AB  == it is common practice in rural areas of the gambia to prepare infant foods in quantities which are sufficient to meet the needs of the day rather than one meal. these are then stored at ambient temperatures for periods up to 12 hours for feeding to the child on demand. the total viable counts and levels of bacillus cereus, clostridium welchii, staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli  were determined in 294 infant foods samples from nought to eight hours after preparation. the presence of salmonella was determined in 10 g samples of food. in the first hour after preparation the proportion of foods dangerously contaminated was high during the rainsy season, significantly more so than during the dry season. foods not consumed fresh were very often hazardous and almost always so after 8 hours. this problem may be a causal factor in weanling diarrhoea which also shows marked seasonal variation in prevalence.

AB  == fluorescence and circular dichroism spectral measurements, thermal denaturation studies and binding competition experiments with netropsin and actinomycin d were carried out in systems containing phenosafranine bound to dna's differing in base composition. the investigated properties exhibit a heterogeneity related to the content of a.t and g.c pairs in dna and to the nature of phenosafranine binding modes. at low level of saturation of binding sites (r less than 0.1) phenosafranine does not show strong preference for any of the dna base pairs in the overall binding. however, the strong monomer non-cooperative binding outside  the helix (mode i1) occurs predominantly, even though not exclusively in g.c rich regions. the strong binding modes involving intercalated dye molecules (mode i2 and eventually mode ii1) prevail in a.t rich regions. these binding modes become  the principal types of strong phenosafranine interaction with dna when the level  of saturation of binding sites increases, i.e. at r greater than 0.1.20

TI  == toxicity of zinc to fungi, bacteria, and coliphages: influence of chloride ions.
AB  == a 10 mm concentration of zn2+ decreased the survival of escherichia coli; enhanced the survival of bacillus cereus; did not significantly affect the survival of pseudomonas aeruginosa, norcardia corallina, and t1, t7, p1, and phi80 coliphages; completely inhibited mycelial growth of rhizoctonia solani; and reduced mycelial growth of fusarium solani, cunninghamella echinulata, aspergillus niger, and trichoderma viride. the toxicity of zinc to the fungi, bacteria, and coliphages was unaffected, lessened, or increased by the addition of high concentrations of nacl. the increased toxicity of zinc in the presence of high concentrations of nacl was not a result of a synergistic interaction between zn2+ and elevated osmotic pressures but of the formation of complex anionic zncl  species that exerted greater toxicities than did cationic zn2+. conversely, the decrease in zinc toxicity with increasing concentrations of nacl probably reflected the decrease in the levels of zn2+ due to the formation of zn-cl species, which was less inhibitory to these microbes than was zn2+. a. niger tolerated higher concentrations of zinc in the presence of nacl at 37 than at 25  degrees c.

AB  == substrate specificities of phospholipases c[ec 3.1.4.3] from clostridium novyi, clostridium perfringens, bacillus cereus, and pseudomonas aureofaciens were studied under the same conditions. phospholipases c from clostridium novyi and bacillus cereus show wide substrate specificities while those of clostridium perfringens and pseudomonas aureofaciens show relatively narrow specificities. on the basis of these results, the hydrolytic actions of these phospholipases on membrane lipids of escherichia coli, bacillus cereus, and clostridium novyi were  examined under the same conditions. the enzymes of clostridium novyi and bacillus cereus attacked all the membranes and their lipid extracts, hydrolyzing phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, lyso-phosphatidylethanolamine, and o-aminoacylphosphatidylglycerol. phospholipase c from pseudomonas aureofaciens attacked these three membranes and their lipid extracts, hydrolyzing phosphatidylethanolamine. phospholipase c from clostridium perfringens hardly attacked the phospholipids of these bacterial membranes. however, phospholipase c from clostridium perfringens hydrolyzed phosphatidylethanolamine in a mixture containing lipid extract from escherichia coli membrane and purified phosphatidylcholine from egg yolk.

AB  == the postomortem invasion of muscle and other tissues by bacteria from the intestinal tract was studied with the use of radioactive tracers. the injection of 14c-labeled bacteria or spores into the intestines of guinea pig carcasses within 24 h of death resulted in the rapid spread of 14c throughout carcasses. when live bacteria were injected along with the labeled cells, it was not possible to isolate viable organisms from the body tissues if the living animal had been exposed to the bacteria. it appears that animals are immune to their normal intestinal flora and that this immunity persists after death; thus passage of these bacteria into the lymphatic system does not necessarily result in the presence of live bacteria in carcass tissues. it therefore seems that a delay of  up to 24 h before evisceration would not lead to deep tissue contamination of the carcass by organisms usually present in the intestines. further evidence for this hypothesis was obtained by showing that muscle and lymph nodes from uneviscerated lamb carcasses hung for 24 h at 20 c remained sterile.

AB  == the pyruvate oxidase system of escherichia coli is composed of a soluble flavoprotein, pyruvate oxidase (ec 1.2.2.2, pyruvate:ferricytochrome b1 oxidoreductase), and an electron transport system associated with the cell envelope-membrane fraction. the membrane particles contain 15% lipid by weight. fractionation of the lipids revealed that abut one-third are neutral lipids and two-thirds are phospholipids. the relative ratio of ubiquinone to menaquinone within the neutral lipid fraction is 15:1 on a molar basis. removal of the lipids from the membrane particles by extraction with aqueous acetone or hydrolysis of the phospholipids by treatment with bacillus cereus phospholipase c results in a  complete loss of electron transport activity. analysis of the particles extracted with aqueous acetone revealed that practically all the neutral lipids and 65% of  the phospholipids are removed by this treatment. phospholipase treatment results  in a loss of 75% of the membrane phospholipid phosphorus; however, the diglycerides and the neutral lipids produced by phospholipase hydrolysis remain associated with the particles. addition of neutral lipid and a detergent, hepta-dl-alanyl dodecylamide to the acetone-extracted material results in a restoration of 37% of the original particle activity. addition of neutral lipid and hepta-dl-alanyl dodecylamide to phospholipase-treated particles completely restores the original electron transport activity. furthermore, addition of ubiquinone from either yeast (uq6) or e. coli (uq8) will restore pyruvate oxidase activity when the quinones are supplemented with photoinactivated neutral lipid.  no restoration of activity to phospholipase-treated particles is noted upon the addition of either menaquinone 6 or menaquinone 8 to the reconstitution system. in fact, these compounds appear to suppress restoration of activity when they are added to reaction mixtures containing neutral lipid and phospholipase-treated particles.

TI  == microflora of maize prepared as tortillas.
AB  == very little is known of the microflora in tortillas, the major component in the diet of many guatemalans and other central americans. based in a guatemalan highland indian village, this study examined the types and amounts of bacteria, yeasts, and molds in tortillas and in their maize precursors. coliforms, bacillus cereus, two species of staphylococcus, and many types of yeast were the main contaminants, but low concentrations of alpha-hemolytic streptococcus, facultative clostridium, and other bacterial types were also found. when tortillas were first cooked, the bacterial counts dropped to 1,000 or fewer organisms per g, a safe level for consumption. under village conditions, bacterial counts regained precooking levels (about 10(8) organisms/g) within 24 h and rose even higher after 48 h. reheating caused very little change; hence, bacterial levels remained very high in old tortillas kept for later consumption.  a search for the sources of contamination showed that most came from water used in preparation and from the soiled hands of women preparing the tortillas. as an  attempt to correct certain nutritional needs of the population, the institute of  nutrition for central america and panama initiated a tortilla fortification project in the guatemalan village. the bacterial counts in fortified tortillas did not differ significantly from those in oridinary tortillas. furthermore, the  level of contamination was constant among tortillas of different sizes and among  tortillas made from different types of maize.

TI  == analysis of bacterial biotin-proteins.
AB  == the biotin-protein populations in several bacterial strains were analyzed by solubilization of [3h]biotin-labeled cells with sodium dodecylsulfate followed by electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gels containing the detergent. a variety of patterns of biotin-labeled polypeptide chains was seen, ranging from a single biotin-protein in escherichia coli, corresponding to the biotin carboxyl carrier  protein component of acetyl-coa carboxylase, to multiple species in enterobacter  aerogenes, pseudomonas citronellolis, bacillus cereus, propionibacterium shermanii, lactobacillus plantarum, and mycobacterium phlei, which probably represent subunits of multiple biotin-dependent enzymes present in these organisms. in the case of pseudomonas citronellolis two major biotin-containing polypeptides with approximate molecular weights of 65 000 and 25 000 were shown to correspond to the biotin carboxyl carrier components of pyruvate carboxylase and acetyl-coa carboxylase, respectively. thus in the case of pseudomonas citronellolis two different biotin-dependent enzymes in the same cell do not share common biotin carboxyl carrier subunits.

TI  == determination of bacterial cell concentrations by electrical measurements.
AB  == an instrument was developed to measure the concentration of bacterial suspensions by their electrical characteristics. it employed a square-wave signal generator,  a tetra-polar electrode probe, and a voltage detector in the form of an oscilloscope. when electrical measurements were made on washed bacteria obtained  from cultures or urine specimens, there was a direct relationship between the concentration of the cells and the electrical characteristics of the system as reflected by voltage changes. as little as 10(3) organisms per ml could be detected. the resolution between readings taken on samples containing 10(3) to 10(9) cells per ml was found to be a function of the input frequency. the maximal resolution between concentration readings was obtained at a input frequency of 10 hz. thus, with relatively simple instrumentation, bacterial concentrations could  be determined within a few minutes. this technique, therefore, eliminates the more lengthy laboratory procedures as plate counts or the accumulation of measurable metabolic changes (such as the utilization of radioactive or other substrates). this method can efficiently monitor clinical urine specimens when a  bacteriuria is suspected.

TI  == occurrence of lysophosphatides in bacteriophage t4rii-infected escherichia coli s-6.
AB  == hydrolysis of phospholipids was observed to start about 15 min after escherichia  coli s/6 cells were infected with t4rii bacteriophage mutants. hydrolysis continued through the latent period and well past the time when cell lysis occurs. the hydrolytic products that accumulated were free fatty acids, 2-acyl lysophosphatidylethanolamine, and various lysocardiolipins. these products indicated the action of phospholipase a(1). from 15 to 22 min after infection, there were equivalent amounts of fatty acids and lysophosphatides in extracts of  cellular lipids. thereafter, free fatty acids were produced in excess. this suggests that lysophospholipase was active at the later time. we also observed a  stoichiometric relation between loss of phosphatidylglycerol and increase of cardiolipin plus lysocardiolipins. this continued well past the normal lysis time (25 min). the appearance of lipase activities during the latent period seems to be specific to infection with rii mutants. neither the wild-type bacteriophage nor ri mutants produced similar activities by 22 min after infection.

TI  == in vivo and in vitro action of new antibiotics interfering with the utilization of n-acetyl-glucosamine-n-acetyl-muramyl-pentapeptide.
AB  == recent literature on the antibiotics enduracidin, moenomycin, prasinomycin, and 11.837 rp suggested an interaction with murein synthesis. incubation of sensitive strains from bacillus cereus and staphylococcus aureus in a "wall medium" containing labeled l-alanine showed that all four antibiotics inhibited the incorporation of alanine into murein and gave rise to accumulation of radioactive uridine diphosphate-n-acetyl-muramyl (udp-murnac)-pentapeptide. peptidoglycan was synthesized when the particulate enzyme of b. stearothermophilus was incubated with the murein precursors udp-n-acetyl-glucosamine (udp-glcnac) and udp-murnac-pentapeptide. the newly formed polymer was less accessible for lysozyme and more strongly bound to the acceptor than the same product from the escherichia coli particulate enzyme. after incubation in the presence of penicillin, a greater part of the peptidoglycan was lysozyme sensitive and more loosely bound to the acceptor. the antibiotics enduracidin, moenomycin, prasinomycin, and 11.837 rp inhibited peptidoglycan synthesis by the b. stearothermophilus particulate enzyme. the rate of synthesis of glcnac-murnac(-pentapeptide)-p-p-phospholipid was independent from the addition of these antibiotics, but its utilization was strongly inhibited. with the present results, it is not possible to distinguish the mechanisms of action of enduracidin, moenomycin, prasinomycin, and 11.837 rp from the mechanisms of action of vancomycin and ristocetin.

TI  == evidence for a magnesium pump in bacillus cereus t.
AB  == unlike escherichia coli, bacillus cereus t appears to accumulate mg(2+) in its cell sap against a concentration gradient. over a range of mg(2+) in the growth medium from 5 x 10(-5) to 1.35 x 10(-2)m, the concentration of mg(2+) in the cell sap of b. cereus t was maintained at about 6 x 10(-3)m, and ribosome-bound mg(2+) and spermidine, as well as the spermidine concentration in the cell sap, appear to be unaffected by the concentration of mg(2+) in the growth medium. inhibition  of growth of e. coli by streptomycin is progressively reversed by increasing the  concentration of mg(2+) in the growth medium above 5 mm. the finding that similar increases of mg(2+) in the growth medium did not reverse the inhibition of b. cereus t is also consistent with the conclusion that b. cereus t, unlike e. coli, accumulates mg(2+) to a constant concentration in its cell sap.

TI  == differential light scattering: a physical method for identifying living bacterial cells.
AB  == differential light scattering techniques appear to represent an attractive physical method for the rapid identification of various microorganisms. certain general results of inverse scattering theory suggest strongly that characteristic of each distinct microorganism that scatters light is an essentially unique scattering pattern, i.e., unique differential scattered intensity and polarization. although a mathematically rigorous inversion procedure seems impractical at this time, the use of detailed differential scattered intensity data as an identification fingerprint shows considerable. promise. published measurements on nonbiological scatterers confirm this possibility. a variety of calculations are presented that contrast the expected scattering characteristics  of certain microorganisms such as bacillus subtilis, b. anthracis, staphylococcus epidermidis, s. aureus, escherichia coli, and the spores of b. mcgaterium and b.  cereus. experimental and instrumentation difficulties and possible procedures are discussed. a review and laboration of some applicable features of rayleigh-gans scattering are included as an appendix.

TI  == biosynthesis of biotin in microorganisms. v. control of vitamer production.
AB  == use of a yeast-lactobacillus differential microbiological assay permitted investigation into the synthesis of biotin vitamers by a variety of bacteria. a major portion of the biotin activity was found extracellularly. the level of total biotin (assayable with yeast) greatly exceeded the level of true biotin (assayed with lactobacillus). values for intracellular biotin generally showed good agreement between the assays, suggesting the presence of only true biotin within the cells. bioautographic analysis of the medium after growth of each organism revealed the presence of large amounts of a vitamer which corresponded to dl-desthiobiotin on the basis of rf value and biological activity. biotin, when detected at all, was at very low concentrations. also, an avidin-uncombinable vitamer was synthesized by a majority of the bacteria. addition of d-biotin to the growth medium prevented completely the synthesis of both vitamers of biotin. d-biotin-d-sulfoxide had no effect on the synthesis of desthiobiotin or the avidin-uncombinable vitamer. addition of dl-desthiobiotin did not prevent its own synthesis nor that of the other vitamer. control of vitamer synthesis is therefore highly specific for d-biotin. the avidin-uncombinable vitamer was produced only at repressed levels in the presence of high concentrations of both d-biotin and dl-desthiobiotin, which suggested that it is not a degradation product of these substances. a possible mechanism for the overproduction of the biosynthetic precursors of biotin is presented.

AB  == a permeaseless mutant of escherichia coli, which produces beta-galactosidase constitutively, was treated briefly with ethylenediaminetetraacetate and then with the phospholipases of bacillus cereus. cell lysis occurred, as indicated by  an increase in beta-galactosidase activity and a decrease in absorbancy of the cell suspension. the susceptibility of the cells to attack by ethylenediaminetetraacetate and the phospholipases was markedly affected by the age of the cells when harvested. the results suggest that permeability changes may be associated with the activity of a phospholipase that specifically degrades phosphatidyl ethanolamine. a sonic-treatment method for determining the total beta-galactosidase content of e. coli cells, which is independent of their age when harvested, is described.

TI  == ultraviolet irradiation of dna in vitro and in vivo produces a 3d thymine-derived product.
AB  == a new thymine-derived product was separated from dna irradiated with utlraviolet  light in vitro and in vivo. this compound was mistaken to be thymine homodiner (t=t) by other workers because it is chromatographically indistinguishable from t=t in most eluents. it has absorbancy maximums at 312, 312, and 300 millimicrons in neutral, ph 2, and ph 11 aqueous solutions, respectively. when it is irradiated in aqueous solution with wavelengths of 360 and 313 millimicrons its spectrum reverts to one similar to that of thymine. therefore, at least three thymine-derived products can be detected in ultraviolet irradiated dna, namely the homodimer, a material with absorbancy maximum at 312 millimicrons, and a "minor" product suggested by others to be a dimer of cytosine and thymine. in cells, the latter two are formed in aboult equal amounts. while these three products were shown to exist in the acid hydrolyzates of ultraviolet irradiated dna, a material with absorbancy maximum at about 310 millimicrons was demonstrated to form in ultraviolet irradiated dna without further treatment. the magnitude of this spectral increase varied directly with the incrcase in the adenine-thymine contents in the dna as shlown by differential transmittance spectra of the irradiated micrococcus lysodeikticus, calf thymus, bacillus cereus, and hemophilus influenzae dna.

AB  == 1. the penicillinase (beta-lactamase) from escherichia coli strain tem has been purified and its activity against a range of penicillin and cephalosporin derivatives measured. 2. the enzyme shows little resemblance to penicillinases from bacillus cereus, bacillus licheniformis and staphylococcus aureus. 3. the molecular weight of the enzyme is 16700+/-5%, which is about half the value obtained for other penicillinases. 4. the enzyme is most similar in properties to a crude preparation of a penicillinase from klebsiella (aerobacter) aerogenes, but clearly different from crude enzyme preparations from other strains of e. coli. 5. since penicillinase synthesis in e. coli strain tem is mediated by an r-factor known to infect many other species of enterobacteriaceae, the appearance of similar enzymes in other gramnegative species is not surprising.

(washington state university, pullman). spectrochemical analysis of inorganic elements in bacteria. j. bacteriol. 88:1545-1549. 1964.-quantitative spectrochemical analyses of inorganic elements in the vegetative cells of escherichia coli, sphaerotilus natans, micrococcus roseus, bacillus cereus, and the spores of b. cereus were made. the following elements were found to be present in the ash samples: b, na, mg, al, si, p, k, ca, ti, cr, mn, fe, ni, cu,  zn, sr, s, ag, sn, ba, pb, v, and mo. these could be divided into major, minor, and trace elements, depending on the relative amounts in the cells. mg, p, k, and s were considered as the major elements; ca, fe, zn, and, perhaps, cu and mn as the minor elements, and the rest as trace elements. mg concentrations were higher in the cells of the gram-positive m. roseus and b. cereus than in the gram-negative e. coli and s. natans. the latter organism contained 2.6% fe(2)o(3) (dry weight basis). the vegetative cells of b. cereus were higher in mg, p, k, na, ag, and lower in si, ca, zn, mn, and cu than were its spores.

TI  == endogenous factor in sporogenesis in bacteria. ii. growth and sporulation in bacillus subtilis.
AB  == kerravala, zarrine j. (university of illinois, urbana), v. r. srinivasan, and h.  orin halvorson. endogenous factor in sporogenesis in bacteria. ii. growth and sporulation of bacillus subtilis. j. bacteriol. 88:374-380. 1964.-the presence of an endogenous factor in bacillus subtilis which could initiate sporogenesis in suspensions of washed vegetative cells was demonstrated. the inability to obtain  a culture of vegetative cells, relatively free from spores, by the "active culture" technique necessitated the use of the "continuous culture" method. the investigations on the continuous cultivation of this organism, to obtain a steady-state population of actively growing vegetative cells, resulted in certain observations which gave an insight into the nature of sporogenesis. growth studies of the organism under these conditions showed that there was a rise in viable cell numbers, until a maximal population was reached. this was maintained  at a steady-state level for sometime; on further incubation, there was a reduction in cell numbers, and consequently the steady state could not be maintained any longer. spore counts showed that the spore fraction of the total population increased on prolonged incubation. the commitment to sporulation appeared to have caused a reduction in the growth rate of the population, which was experimentally demonstrated by a decline in cell numbers. in contrast, when b. cereus strain t. was grown as a continuous culture, it could be maintained as  a steady-state population of vegetative cells, for longer periods, like a nonsporeformer (e.g., escherichia coli). this difference in behavior could be attributed to the fact that whereas b. subtilis can sporulate in the presence of  nutrients, b. cereus strain t. cannot do so until the medium has been depleted of nutrients.

TI  == tetracycline fluorescence in permeability studies of membranes around intracellular parasites.
AB  == certain protozoa, bacteria, and viruses when phagocytosed by host cells become surrounded by an intracytoplasmic boundary. this membrane prevents the fluorescent antibiotic tetracycline from entering the parasites when it is added  to the medium, since they show no fluorescence, whereas extracellular parasites are immediately visible. as soon as the host cell dies, the intracellular parasites also become visible. this indicates that the boundary probably is of host origin. this phenomenon provides a means for selective permeability studies  of such boundaries. a similar exclusion of tetracycline from certain extracellular parasites is seen in the presence of whole serum.

AB  == brock, thomas d. (indiana university, bloomington), barbara peacher, and deborah  pierson. a survey of the bacteriocines of enterococci. j. bacteriol. 86:702-707.  1963.-a survey has been made of bacteriocine production by a wide variety of well-characterized strains of group d streptococci. on the basis of spectrums and sensitivity to chloroform, heat, and proteolytic enzymes, five distinct bacteriocines can be defined. type 1 is produced by all streptococcus zymogenes (s. faecalis var. zymogenes) strains, is active against a wide variety of gram-positive bacteria, and is also a hemolysin. type 2 is produced by some s. liquefaciens (s. faecalis var. liquefaciens) strains, and acts on many enterococci as well as on certain other lactic acid bacteria. type 3 is produced  by certain strains of both s. faecalis and s. faecium, and inhibits a wide variety of group d streptococci, but is inactive against all other lactic acid bacteria tested except leuconostoc citrovorum. type 4 is produced by certain s. faecium strains and resembles in certain ways the type 3 activity, but differs from it in other ways. type 5 has been found to be produced by only one proteolytic strain of s. zymogenes, and this bacteriocine has a very narrow spectrum. the strain that produces this bacteriocine also produces type 1 activity. no strain is sensitive to a bacteriocine of the type it produces.

TI  == repression of staphylococcus aureus by food bacteria. ii. causes of inhibition.
AB  == two food bacteria, serratia marcescens and pseudomonas sp. cs-1, inhibited an enterotoxigenic strain of staphylococcus aureus, apparently by out-competing it for nutrients. five others, bacillus cereus, proteus vulgaris, escherichia coli h-52, aerobacter aerogenes, and achromobacter sp., inhibited by means of antibiotic substances which were seitz-filterable, dialyzable, and stable at 90 c for 10 min. inhibition was not caused by changes in ph, oxidation-reduction potential, or production of peroxide or fatty acids. the concentrated antibiotic  material from e. coli h-52 contained amino acids but not peptides and was especially effective against staphylococci and micrococci.

TI  == survival of bacteria in lyophilized plasma.
AB  == although lyophilization reduces the bacterial population in plasma, some species  survive for several months. sensitivity or resistance to lyophilization in plasma is a characteristic of each morphological type, with gram-negative species being  more sensitive to destruction than cocci or sporulating gram-positive species. reconstituted preparations of lyophilized plasma must be incubated for 24 hr to prevent false-negative sterility tests. the killing process in lyophilized plasma continues with time if the preparations are stored at room temperature. strict asepsis must be realized during processing of plasma because lyophilization alone does not destroy the microorganisms present.

TI  == repression of staphylococcus aureus by food bacteria. i. effect of environmental  factors on inhibition.
AB  == the effects of environmental factors on the inhibition of an enterotoxin-producing strain of staphylococcus aureus by food bacteria were investigated. type of medium and temperature of incubation were important factors in determining the amount of inhibition. the ph range of maximal inhibition was found to be 7.4 to 6.2. availability of oxygen was not a factor. as the ratios of inhibitor to staphylococcus were increased from 1:1 to 10:1 and 100:1, the amount of inhibition was markedly increased. inhibition occurred in custard, where it increased with increasing ratios of effector to staphylococcus. the repression of the staphylococcus in all media usually was sufficient to be of practical significance.
