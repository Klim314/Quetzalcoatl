TI  == diverse mechanisms regulate sporulation sigma factor activity in the firmicutes.
AB  == sporulation allows bacteria to survive adverse conditions and is essential to the lifecycle of some obligate anaerobes. in bacillus subtilis, the sporulation-specific sigma factors, sigma(f), sigma(e), sigma(g), and sigma(k), activate compartment-specific transcriptional programs that drive sporulation through its morphological stages. the regulation of these sigma factors was predicted to be conserved across the firmicutes, since the regulatory proteins controlling their activation are largely conserved. however, recent studies in (pepto)clostridium difficile, clostridium acetobutylicum, clostridium perfringens, and clostridium botulinum have revealed striking differences in the  order, activation, and function of sporulation sigma factors. these studies indicate that gene conservation does not necessarily predict gene function and that new mechanisms for controlling cell fate determination remain to be discovered in the anaerobic clostridia.

TI  == the clostridium sporulation programs: diversity and preservation of endospore differentiation.
AB  == summary: bacillus and clostridium organisms initiate the sporulation process when unfavorable conditions are detected. the sporulation process is a carefully orchestrated cascade of events at both the transcriptional and posttranslational  levels involving a multitude of sigma factors, transcription factors, proteases,  and phosphatases. like bacillus genomes, sequenced clostridium genomes contain genes for all major sporulation-specific transcription and sigma factors (spo0a,  sigh, sigf, sige, sigg, and sigk) that orchestrate the sporulation program. however, recent studies have shown that there are substantial differences in the  sporulation programs between the two genera as well as among different clostridium species. first, in the absence of a bacillus-like phosphorelay system, activation of spo0a in clostridium organisms is carried out by a number of orphan histidine kinases. second, downstream of spo0a, the transcriptional and posttranslational regulation of the canonical set of four sporulation-specific sigma factors (sigma(f), sigma(e), sigma(g), and sigma(k)) display different patterns, not only compared to bacillus but also among clostridium organisms. finally, recent studies demonstrated that sigma(k), the last sigma factor to be activated according to the bacillus subtilis model, is involved in the very early stages of sporulation in clostridium acetobutylicum, c. perfringens, and c. botulinum as well as in the very late stages of spore maturation in c. acetobutylicum. despite profound differences in initiation, propagation, and orchestration of expression of spore morphogenetic components, these findings demonstrate not only the robustness of the endospore sporulation program but also the plasticity of the program to generate different complex phenotypes, some apparently regulated at the epigenetic level.

TI  == a functional rect gene for recombineering of clostridium.
AB  == recombineering is an efficient genetic manipulation method employing the mechanism of phagenic rect-mediated homologous recombination. to develop a recombineering method for clostridium, a putative rect gene (cpf0939) from clostridium perfringens genome was functionally verified in a clostridial host clostridium acetobutylicum. we show that a short synthetic oligonucleotide can be introduced into the target site for specific point mutation. this functional rect gene would therefore contribute to development of recombineering tools for clostridium.

TI  == novel system for efficient isolation of clostridium double-crossover allelic exchange mutants enabling markerless chromosomal gene deletions and dna integration.
AB  == isolation of clostridium mutants based on gene replacement via allelic exchange remains a major limitation for this important genus. use of a heterologous counterselection marker can facilitate the identification of the generally rare allelic exchange events. we report on the development of an inducible counterselection marker and describe its utility and broad potential in quickly and efficiently generating markerless dna deletions and integrations at any genomic locus without the need for auxotrophic mutants or the use of the mobile group ii introns. this system is based on a codon-optimized mazf toxin gene from  escherichia coli under the control of a lactose-inducible promoter from clostridium perfringens. this system is potentially applicable to almost all members of the genus clostridium due to their similarly low genomic gc content and comparable codon usage. we isolated all allelic-exchange-based gene deletions (ca_p0167, sigf, and sigk) or disruptions (ca_p0157 and sigf) we attempted and integrated a 3.6-kb heterologous dna sequence (made up of a clostridium ljungdahlii 2.1-kb formate dehydrogenase [fdh] gene plus a flp recombination target [frt]-flanked thiamphenicol resistance marker) into the clostridium acetobutylicum chromosome. furthermore, we report on the development of a plasmid system with inducible segregational instability, thus enabling efficient deployment of the flp-frt system to generate markerless deletion or integration mutants. this enabled expeditious deletion of the thiamphenicol resistance marker from the fdh integrant strain as well as the sigk deletion strain. more generally, our system can potentially be applied to other organisms with underdeveloped genetic tools.

TI  == clostron-mediated engineering of clostridium.
AB  == the genus clostridium is a diverse assemblage of gram positive, anaerobic, endospore-forming bacteria. whilst certain species have achieved notoriety as important animal and human pathogens (e.g. clostridium difficile, clostridium botulinum, clostridium tetani, and clostridium perfringens), the vast majority of the genus are entirely benign, and are able to undertake all manner of useful biotransformations. prominent amongst them are those species able to produce the  biofuels, butanol and ethanol from biomass-derived residues, such as clostridium  acetobutylicum, clostridium beijerinkii, clostridium thermocellum, and clostridium phytofermentans. the prominence of the genus in disease and biotechnology has led to the need for more effective means of genetic modification. the historical absence of methods based on conventional strategies  for "knock-in" and "knock-out" in clostridium has led to the adoption of recombination-independent procedures, typified by clostron technology. the clostron uses a retargeted group ii intron and a retro-transposition-activated marker to selectively insert dna into defined sites within the genome, to bring about gene inactivation and/or cargo dna delivery. the procedure is extremely efficient, rapid, and requires minimal effort by the operator.

TI  == small rnas in the genus clostridium.
AB  == the genus clostridium includes major human pathogens and species important to cellulose degradation, the carbon cycle, and biotechnology. small rnas (srnas) are emerging as crucial regulatory molecules in all organisms, but they have not  been investigated in clostridia. research on srnas in clostridia is hindered by the absence of a systematic method to identify srna candidates, thus delegating clostridial srna research to a hit-and-miss process. thus, we wanted to develop a method to identify potential srnas in the clostridium genus to open up the field  of srna research in clostridia. using comparative genomics analyses combined with predictions of rho-independent terminators and promoters, we predicted srnas in 21 clostridial genomes: clostridium acetobutylicum, c. beijerinckii, c. botulinum (eight strains), c. cellulolyticum, c. difficile, c. kluyveri (two strains), c. novyi, c. perfringens (three strains), c. phytofermentans, c. tetani, and c. thermocellum. although more than one-third of predicted srnas have shine-dalgarno (sd) sequences, only one-sixth have a start codon downstream of sd sequences; thus, most of the predicted srnas are noncoding rnas. quantitative reverse transcription-pcr (q-rt-pcr) and northern analysis were employed to test the presence of a randomly chosen set of srnas in c. acetobutylicum and several c. botulinum strains, leading to the confirmation of a large fraction of the tested  srnas. we identified a conserved, novel srna which, together with the downstream  gene coding for an atp-binding cassette (abc) transporter gene, responds to the antibiotic clindamycin. the number of predicted srnas correlated with the physiological function of the species (high for pathogens, low for cellulolytic,  and intermediate for solventogenic), but not with 16s rrna-based phylogeny.

TI  == sporulation and enterotoxin (cpe) synthesis are controlled by the sporulation-specific sigma factors sige and sigk in clostridium perfringens.
AB  == clostridium perfringens is the third most frequent cause of bacterial food poisoning annually in the united states. ingested c. perfringens vegetative cells sporulate in the intestinal tract and produce an enterotoxin (cpe) that is responsible for the symptoms of acute food poisoning. studies of bacillus subtilis have shown that gene expression during sporulation is compartmentalized, with different genes expressed in the mother cell and the forespore. the cell-specific rna polymerase sigma factors sigma(f), sigma(e), sigma(g), and sigma(k) coordinate much of the developmental process. the c. perfringens cpe gene, encoding cpe, is transcribed from three promoters, where p1 was proposed to be sigma(k) dependent, while p2 and p3 were proposed to be sigma(e) dependent based on consensus promoter recognition sequences. in this study, mutations were  introduced into the sige and sigk genes of c. perfringens. with the sige and sigk mutants, gusa fusion assays indicated that there was no expression of cpe in either mutant. results from gusa fusion assays and immunoblotting experiments indicate that sigma(e)-associated rna polymerase and sigma(k)-associated rna polymerase coregulate each other's expression. transcription and translation of the spoiiid gene in c. perfringens were not affected by mutations in sige and sigk, which differs from b. subtilis, in which spoiiid transcription requires sigma(e)-associated rna polymerase. the results presented here show that the regulation of developmental events in the mother cell compartment of c. perfringens is not the same as that in b. subtilis and clostridium acetobutylicum.

TI  == complementation of a clostridium perfringens spo0a mutant with wild-type spo0a from other clostridium species.
AB  == to evaluate whether c. perfringens can be used as a model organism for studying the sporulation process in other clostridia, c. perfringens spo0a mutant ih101 was complemented with wild-type spo0a from four different clostridium species. wild-type spo0a from c. acetobutylicum or c. tetani, but not from c. botulinum or c. difficile, restored sporulation and enterotoxin production in ih101. the ability of spo0a from c. botulinum or c. difficile to complement the lack of spore formation in ih101 might be due, at least in part, to the low levels of spo0a transcription and spo0a production.

TI  == insights in metabolism and toxin production from the complete genome sequence of  clostridium tetani.
AB  == the decryption of prokaryotic genome sequences progresses rapidly and provides the scientific community with an enormous amount of information. clostridial genome sequencing projects have been finished only recently, starting with the genome of the solvent-producing clostridium acetobutylicum in 2001. a lot of attention has been devoted to the genomes of pathogenic clostridia. in 2002, the  genome sequence of c. perfringens, the causative agent of gas gangrene, has been  released. currently in the finishing stage and prior to publication are the genomes of the foodborne botulism-causing c. botulinum and of c. difficile, the causative agent of a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations such as antibiotic-associated diarrhea. our team sequenced the genome of neuropathogenic  c. tetani, a gram-positive spore-forming bacterium predominantly found in the soil. in deep wound infections it occasionally causes spastic paralysis in humans and vertebrate animals, known as tetanus disease, by the secretion of potent neurotoxin, designated tetanus toxin. the toxin blocks the release of neurotransmitters from presynaptic membranes of interneurons of the spinal cord and the brainstem, thus preventing muscle relaxation. fortunately, this disease is successfully controlled through immunization with tetanus toxoid, a formaldehyde-treated tetanus toxin, but nevertheless, an estimated 400,000 cases  still occur each year, mainly of neonatal tetanus. the world health organization  has stated that neonatal tetanus is the second leading cause of death from vaccine preventable diseases among children worldwide. this minireview focuses on an analysis of the genome sequence of c. tetani e88, a vaccine production strain, which is a toxigenic non-sporulating variant of strain massachusetts. the genome  consists of a 2,799,250 bp chromosome encoding 2618 open reading frames. the tetanus toxin is encoded on a 74,082 kb plasmid, containing 61 genes. additional  virulence-related factors as well as an insight into the metabolic strategy of c. tetani with regard to its pathogenic phenotype will be presented. the information from other clostridial genomes by means of comparative analysis will also be explored.

TI  == regulation of toxin and bacteriocin gene expression in clostridium by interchangeable rna polymerase sigma factors.
AB  == the production of major extracellular toxins by pathogenic strains of clostridium botulinum, clostridium tetani and clostridium difficile, and a bacteriocin by clostridium perfringens is dependent on a related group of rna polymerase sigma-factors. these sigma-factors (botr, tetr, tcdr and uvia) were shown to be sufficiently similar that they could substitute for one another in in vitro dna binding and run-off transcription experiments. in cells, however, the sigma-factors fell into two subclasses. botr and tetr were able to direct transcription of their target genes in a fully reciprocal manner. similarly, uvia and tcdr were fully interchangeable. neither botr nor tetr could substitute for uvia or tcdr, however, and neither uvia nor tcdr could direct transcription of the natural targets of botr or tetr. the extent of functional interchangeability  of the sigma-factors was attributed to the strong conservation of their subregion 4.2 sequences and the conserved -35 sequences of their target promoters, while restrictions on interchangeability were attributed to variations in their subregion 2.4 sequences and the target site -10 sequences. the four sigma-factors have been assigned to group 5 of the sigma(70) family and seem to have arisen from a common ancestral protein that may have co-evolved with the genes whose transcription they direct. a fifth clostridiumsigma-factor, sigma(y) of clostridium acetobutylicum, resembles the tcdr family, but was not functionally interchangeable with members of this family.

TI  == genetic characterization of the beta-glucuronidase enzyme from a human intestinal bacterium, ruminococcus gnavus.
AB  == beta-glucuronidase activity (encoded by the gus gene) has been characterized for  the first time from ruminococcus gnavus e1, an anaerobic bacterium belonging to the dominant human gut microbiota. beta-glucuronidase activity plays a major role in the generation of toxic and carcinogenic metabolites in the large intestine, as well as in the absorption and enterohepatic circulation of many aglycone residues with protective effects, such as lignans, flavonoids, ceramide and glycyrrhetinic acid, that are liberated by the hydrolysis of the corresponding glucuronides. the complete nucleotide sequence of a 4537 bp dna fragment containing the beta-glucuronidase locus from r. gnavus e1 was determined. five orfs were detected on this fragment: three complete orfs (orf2, gus and orf3) and two partial orfs (orf4 and orf5). the products of orf2 and orf3 show strong similarities with many beta-glucoside permeases of the phosphoenolpyruvate : beta-glucoside phosphotransferase systems (ptss), such as escherichia coli bglc,  bacillus subtilis bglp and bacillus halodurans pts enzyme ii. the product of orf5 presents strong similarities with the amino-terminal domain of clostridium acetobutylicum beta-glucosidase (bgla). the gus gene product presents similarities with several known beta-glucuronidase enzymes, including those of lactobacillus gasseri (69%), e. coli (61%), clostridium perfringens (59%) and staphylococcus aureus (58%). by complementing an e. coli strain in which the uida gene encoding the enzyme was deleted, it was confirmed that the r. gnavus gus gene encodes the beta-glucuronidase enzyme. moreover, it was found that the gus gene was transcribed as part of an operon that includes orf2, orf3 and orf5.

TI  == comparative analysis of gene expression among low g+c gram-positive genomes.
AB  == we present a comparative analysis of predicted highly expressed (phx) genes in the low g+c gram-positive genomes of bacillus subtilis, bacillus halodurans, listeria monocytogenes, listeria innocua, lactococcus lactis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, clostridium acetobutylicum, and clostridium perfringens. most enzymes acting in glycolysis and fermentation pathways are phx in these genomes, but not those involved in the tca cycle and respiration, suggesting that these organisms have predominantly adapted to grow rapidly in an anaerobic environment. only b. subtilis and b. halodurans have several tca cycle phx genes, whereas the tca pathway is entirely  missing from the metabolic repertoire of the two streptococcus species and is incomplete in listeria, lactococcus, and clostridium. pyruvate-formate lyase, an  enzyme critical in mixed acid fermentation, is among the highest phx genes in all these genomes except for c. acetobutylicum (not phx), and b. subtilis, and b. halodurans (missing). pyruvate-formate lyase is also prominently phx in enteric gamma-proteobacteria, but not in other prokaryotes. phosphotransferase system genes are generally phx with selection of different substrates in different genomes. the various substrate specificities among phosphotransferase systems in  different genomes apparently reflect on differences in habitat, lifestyle, and nutrient sources.

TI  == translational selection is operative for synonymous codon usage in clostridium perfringens and clostridium acetobutylicum.
AB  == here, the codon usage patterns of two clostridium species (clostridium perfringens and clostridium acetobutylicum) are reported. these prokaryotes are characterized by a strong mutational bias towards a+t, a striking excess of coding sequences and purine-rich leading strands of replication, strong gc-skews  and a high frequency of genomic rearrangements. as expected, it was found that the mutational bias dominates codon usage but there is some variation of synonymous codon choices among genes in the two species. this variation was investigated using a multivariate statistical approach. in the two species, two major trends were detected. one was related to the location of the sequences in the leading or lagging strand of replication, and the other was associated with the preferential use of putatively translational optimal codons in heavily expressed genes. analyses of the estimated number of synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions among orthologous genes permit us to postulate that  optimal codons might be selected not only for speed but also for accuracy during  translation.

TI  == the genome sequence of clostridium tetani, the causative agent of tetanus disease.
AB  == tetanus disease is one of the most dramatic and globally prevalent diseases of humans and vertebrate animals, and has been reported for over 24 centuries. the manifestation of the disease, spastic paralysis, is caused by the second most poisonous substance known, the tetanus toxin, with a human lethal dose of approximately 1 ng/kg. fortunately, this disease is successfully controlled through immunization with tetanus toxoid; nevertheless, according to the world health organization, an estimated 400,000 cases still occur each year, mainly of  neonatal tetanus. the causative agent of tetanus disease is clostridium tetani, an anaerobic spore-forming bacterium, whose natural habitat is soil, dust, and intestinal tracts of various animals. here we report the complete genome sequence of toxigenic c. tetani e88, a variant of strain massachusetts. the genome consists of a 2,799,250-bp chromosome encoding 2,372 orfs. the tetanus toxin and  a collagenase are encoded on a 74,082-bp plasmid, containing 61 orfs. additional  virulence-related factors could be identified, such as an array of surface-layer  and adhesion proteins (35 orfs), some of them unique to c. tetani. comparative genomics with the genomes of clostridium perfringens, the causative agent of gas  gangrene, and clostridium acetobutylicum, a nonpathogenic solvent producer, revealed a remarkable capacity of c. tetani: the organism can rely on an extensive sodium ion bioenergetics. additional candidate genes involved in the establishment and maintenance of a pathogenic lifestyle of c. tetani are presented.

TI  == physical and genetic map of the clostridium saccharobutylicum (formerly clostridium acetobutylicum) ncp 262 chromosome.
AB  == a physical and genetic map of the clostridium saccharobutylicum ncp 262 chromosome was constructed. the order of macrorestriction fragments was determined by analysing fragments generated after single and double digestion with the restriction enzymes bsshii, i-ceui, sse8387i, rsrii and sfii and separation by pfge. the i-ceui backbone of c. saccharobutylicum was constructed by indirect end-labelling with rrs- and 3' rrl-specific probes located on either  side of the i-ceui site in the rrn operon, and reciprocal separation of bsshii and i-ceui digestion products by two-dimensional pfge. the positions of bsshii fragments on the physical map were determined using a library of linking clones containing bsshii cleavage sites. the size of the circular genome was estimated to be 5.3 mb with a mean resolution of approximately 140 kb. the chromosome of c. saccharobutylicum contains 12 rrn operons, located on 46% of the chromosome, which are transcribed divergently from the deduced origin of replication. the genetic map was constructed by determining the location of 28 genes involved in house-keeping, heat-shock response, sporulation, electron transfer and acid- and  solvent-formation. comparison of the c. saccharobutylicum genetic map with those  of the spore-forming bacteria bacillus subtilis, clostridium acetobutylicum, clostridium perfringens and clostridium beijerinckii indicated c. saccharobutylicum to be most similar to the latter two clostridium species, with  the order of the genes within the gyrab and reca loci being conserved.

TI  == identification of two genes encoding putative new members of the ecf subfamily of eubacterial rna polymerase sigma factors in clostridium acetobutylicum.
AB  == two genes from clostridium acetobutylicum dsm 792 were identified which are predicted to encode new members of the ecf subfamily of eubacterial rna polymerase sigma factors. the sigx gene has the potential to encode a 184-amino acid protein with a molecular mass of 21,870 da and with the highest overall similarity to fecl of escherichia coli (27 % identical residues). the second gene, which is predicted to encode an alternative sigma factor of the ecf subfamily, is the previously described orf2 gene (gerischer and durre, 1990) located in the adc gene region of c. acetobutylicum. the deduced protein of orf2  has significant similarity to sigx of c. acetobutylicum (22 % identical residues) and shares structural features with other alternative sigma factors. therefore, it is proposed to rename orf2 as sigy. analysis of the phylogenetic relationship  revealed that sigx from c. acetobutylicum, together with sigmae from streptomyces coelicolor and sigx from bacillus subtilis, form a gram-positive cluster within the ecf subfamily and that sigy from c. acetobutylicum together with uvia from clostridium perfringens, form a separate cluster located between the gram-positive cluster and the sporulation sigma factor sigmah from b. subtilis.

TI  == physical and genetic map of the clostridium acetobutylicum atcc 824 chromosome.
AB  == a physical and genetic map of the clostridium acetobutylicum atcc 824 chromosome  was constructed. the macrorestriction map for ceui, eagi, and sstii was created by ordering the 38 restriction sites by one- and two-dimensional pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) and by using an original strategy based on the ceui enzyme and indirect end labelling by hybridization on both sides of the ceui sites with  rrs (16s rna) and 3' rrl (23s rna) probes. the circular chromosome was estimated  to be 4.15 mb in size, and the average resolution of the physical map is 110 kb.  the chromosome contains 11 rrn loci, which are localized on 44% of the chromosome in a divergent transcriptional orientation regarding the presumed location of the replication origin. in addition to these 11 rrn operons, a total of 40 identified genes were mapped by hybridization experiments with genes from c. acetobutylicum  and from various other clostridia as probes. the genetic map of c. acetobutylicum was compared to that of the three other endospore-forming bacteria characterized  so far: bacillus subtilis, clostridium beijerinckii, and clostridium perfringens. parodoxically, the chromosomal backbone of c. acetobutylicum showed more similarity to that of b. subtilis than to those of the clostridia.

AB  == a bacteriophage-plasmid hybrid (phagemid) designated pcak1 was constructed by ligating 5-kbp escherichia coli plasmid pak102 (apremr) and the 6.6-kbp haeiii-linearized replicative form of the cak1 viruslike particle from clostridium acetobutylicum ncib 6444. phagemid pcak1 (11.6 kbp) replicated via the cole1 replication origin derived from pak102 in e. coli. single-stranded dna  (ssdna) molecules complexed with protein in a manner which protected ssdna from nucleases were recovered from the supernatant of e. coli dh11s transformants containing pcak1 in the absence of cell lysis. this suggests that the viral-strand dna synthesis replication origin of cak1 and associated gene expression are functional in e. coli dh11s. the single-stranded form of pcak1 isolated from e. coli supernatant was transformed into e. coli dh5 alpha' or dh11s by electroporation. isolation of ampicillin-resistant e. coli transformants following transformation suggests that the complementary-strand dna synthesis replication origin of cak1 is also functional in e. coli. the coat proteins associated with ssdna of pcak1 demonstrated sensitivity to proteinase k and various solvents (i.e., phenol and chloroform), similar to the results obtained previously with cak1. following phagemid construction in e. coli, pcak1 was transformed into c. acetobutylicum atcc 824 and c. perfringens 13 by intact cell  electroporation. restriction enzyme analysis of pcak1 isolated from erythromycin-resistant transformants of both c. acetobutylicum and c. perfringens suggested that it was identical to that present in e. coli transformants.

TI  == antagonistic effect on clostridium botulinum type e by organisms resembling it.
AB  == a bacteriocin-like substance, active against strains of clostridium botulinum type e, is produced by certain nontoxic organisms whose biochemical properties and morphological characteristics are similar to type e. the substance, for which the name "boticin e" is proposed, is bacteriolytic for vegetative cells and bacteriostatic for spores of type e. its spectrum of activity is somewhat strain-specific. of the clostridial species tested, only c. botulinum type e and, to a lesser extent, c. perfringens and c. acetobutylicum, but not c. botulinum types a, b, or f, are sensitive. irreversibly resistant variants originating from both vegetative cells and spores of certain strains were obtained. the active substance is heat-stable and dialyzable, and is not inactivated by chloroform but is digested by trypsin. ethyl alcohol and acetone precipitates are fully active,  whereas trichloroacetic acid precipitates are only partially active. other nontoxic organisms producing similar antagonistic substances are discussed.
