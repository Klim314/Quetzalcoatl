TI  == mechanism of conjugated linoleic acid and vaccenic acid formation in human faecal suspensions and pure cultures of intestinal bacteria.
AB  == faecal bacteria from four human donors and six species of human intestinal bacteria known to metabolize linoleic acid (la) were incubated with la in deuterium oxide-enriched medium to investigate the mechanisms of conjugated linoleic acid (cla) and vaccenic acid (va) formation. the main cla products in faecal suspensions, rumenic acid (cis-9,trans-11-cla; ra) and trans-9,trans-11-cla, were labelled at c-13, as were other 9,11 geometric isomers. traces of trans-10,cis-12-cla formed were labelled to a much lower extent. in pure culture, bifidobacterium breve ncfb 2258 formed labelled ra and trans-9,trans-11-cla, while butyrivibrio fibrisolvens 16.4, roseburia hominis a2-183t, roseburia inulinivorans a2-192t and ruminococcus obeum-like strain a2-162 converted la to va, labelled in a manner indicating that va was formed via c-13-labelled ra. propionibacterium freudenreichii subsp. shermanii dsm 4902t, a  possible probiotic, formed mainly ra with smaller amounts of trans-10,cis-12-cla  and trans-9,trans-11-cla, labelled the same as in the mixed microbiota. ricinoleic acid (12-oh-cis-9-18 : 1) did not form cla in the mixed microbiota, in contrast to cla formation described for lactobacillus plantarum. these results were similar to those reported for the mixed microbiota of the rumen. thus, although the bacterial genera and species responsible for biohydrogenation in the rumen and the human intestine differ, and a second route of ra formation via a 10-oh-18 : 1 is present in the intestine, the overall labelling patterns of different cla isomers formation are common to both gut ecosystems. a hydrogen-abstraction enzymic mechanism is proposed that may explain the role of a 10-oh-18 : 1 intermediate in 9,11-cla formation in pure and mixed cultures.

TI  == sequence analysis and characterization of pom1, a small cryptic plasmid from butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, and its use in construction of a new family of cloning vectors for butyrivibrios.
AB  == as a preliminary step in the development of vector systems, we have isolated and  begun to characterize small, cryptic plasmids from several strains of the rumen bacterium butyrivibrio fibrisolvens. we present here the complete nucleotide sequence of butyrivibrio plasmid pom1, which was isolated from b. fibrisolvens bu49. while it is very similar in size to the previously characterized butyrivibrio plasmids prjf1 and prjf2, pom1 exhibits a restriction pattern which  is quite distinct. analysis of sequence data reveals that pom1 contains only two  open reading frames of significant length (orf1 and orf2), both of which are required for self-replication and maintenance. the protein encoded in orf1 shows  homologies with pre (plasmid recombination enzyme) proteins encoded in plasmids from gram-positive organisms such as staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, lactobacillus plantarum, and bacillus thuringiensis. the putative translation product of orf2, on the other hand, resembles rep (replication) proteins of a different group of gram-positive plasmids, for which the staphylococcus plasmid psn2 is a prototype. unlike the other characterized-butyrivibrio plasmids, pom1 appears to replicate via a rolling-circle mechanism. experimental evidence showing the presence of a single-stranded replication intermediate consistent with this mechanism is presented. pom1 has been used in the construction of a new escherichia coli-b. fibrisolvens shuttle vector, psmerm1, which has been successfully used to introduce a cloned gene into b. fibrisolvens harboring the prjf1 plasmid.
