TI  - Intestinal microbiota and allergic diseases: A systematic review.
AB  - Evidence suggests that possible imbalances in intestinal microbiota composition may be implicated in the occurrence of allergic diseases. Although several studies published until 2006 indicated a correlation between microbiota composition and allergic symptoms, it has not been possible to distinguish protective microorganisms from those associated with increased risk of allergic diseases. Therefore, the objective of this study was to review the studies published since 2007 that address the intestinal microbiota in allergic diseases. Twenty-one studies were identified after excluding those that performed a clinical intervention before stool collection. In the early microbiota of children who later developed allergies, lower bacterial diversity was observed, with a predominance of Firmicutes; a higher count of Bacteroidaceae; a higher prevalence of the anaerobic bacteria Bacteroides fragilis, Escherichia coli, Clostridium difficile, Bifidobacterium catenulatum, Bifidobacterium bifidum, and Bifidobacterium longum; and a lower prevalence of Bifidobacterium adolescentis, B. bifidum, and Lactobacillus. In the microbiota of allergic children whose intestinal microbiota was assessed at the onset of allergic symptoms, there was a higher count of Bacteroides; a lower count of Akkermansia muciniphila, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, and Clostridium; a higher prevalence of B. adolescentis; a lower prevalence of B. catenulatum and Staphylococcus aureus; and a lower bacterial diversity.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and its susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents - Special references to bacteria isolated between April 2011 and March 2012].
AB  - Bacteria isolated from surgical infections during the period from April 2011 to March 2012 were investigated in a multicenter study in Japan, and the following results were obtained. In this series, 785 strains including 31 strains of Candida spp. were isolated from 204 (78.8%) of 259 patients with surgical infections. Five hundred and twenty three strains were isolated from primary infections, and 231 strains were isolated from surgical site infection. From primary infections, anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria were predominant, followed by aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, while from surgical site infection aerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant, followed by anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria. Among aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Enterococcus spp. was highest, followed by Streptococcus spp. and Staphylococcus spp., in this order, from primary infections, while Enterococcus spp. was highest, followed by Staphylococcus spp. from surgical site infection. Among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter cloacae, in this order, and from surgical site infection, E. coli was most predominantly isolated, followed by P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae, and E. cloacae. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Eggerthella lenta was the highest from primary infections, followed by Parvimonas micra, Collinsella aerofaciens, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Finegoldia magna, and from surgical site infection, E. lenta was most predominantly isolated, followed by P micra and L. acidophilus, in this order. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of Bacteroidesfragilis was the highest from primary infections, followed by Bilophila wadsworthia, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides uniformis and Bacteroides vulgatus, and from surgical site infection, B. fragilis was most predominantly isolated, followed by Bacteroides caccae, B. thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides ovatus and B. wadsworthia, in this order. In this series, vancomycin-resistant MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp. and multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa were not observed. We should carefully follow up B. wadsworthia which was resistant to various antimicrobial agents, and also Bacteroides spp. which was resistant to many beta-lactams.
TI  - Validation of sterility testing of cord blood: Challenges and results.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sterility testing for cord blood (CB) products is mandatory to prevent transplantation-transmitted microbial infections. Here, the automated BacT/ALERT (bioMerieux) culture system was validated to detect microbial contamination in CB units processed at the Canadian National Public Cord Blood Bank. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A three-phase validation was developed. CB units were prepared with pentastarch (Phases 1 and 2) or hetastarch (Phase 3). In Phase 1, CB was spiked with approximately 100 colony-forming units/mL of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacteroides fragilis, and Candida albicans. Plasma (8 mL) and buffy coat (BC; 0.5 and 8 mL) were inoculated into culture bottles. In Phases 2 and 3, a mix of red blood cells (RBCs) and plasma (4 mL each) was used as the inoculant. In Phase 3, Aspergillus brasiliensis was added as a test organism and microbial concentrations in the by-product RBCs and plasma were determined. The BC fractions were cryopreserved and tested 3 months later. RESULTS: In Phase 1, bacteria failed to grow in CB units containing antibiotics. Thus, antibiotic-free units were used for the other phases. C. albicans was not always captured in plasma, but using a mix of RBCs and plasma, all organisms were detected. The use of pentastarch or hetastarch did not affect microbial recovery. C. albicans and A. brasiliensis were preferentially recovered in RBCs and BC. Cryopreservation did not affect microbial survival during CB processing. CONCLUSIONS: A mix of plasma and RBCs is appropriate for CB sterility testing. Interestingly, fungi preferentially segregate to cellular fractions. The clinical significance of the bactericidal /or bacteriostatic effect of antibiotics in CB merits further investigation.
TI  - Bacterial etiology and antibiotic susceptibility pattern of diabetic foot infections in Tabriz, Iran.
AB  - AIM: The aim of this study was to investigate anaerobic and aerobic bacteria profile and determination of antibiotic susceptibility pattern in aerobic bacteria. METHOD: Specimens were cultured using optimal aerobic and anaerobic microbiological techniques. Identification of bacterial isolates was performed by standard microbiological methods and antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed according to the guidelines of Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI). RESULT: 92 bacterial strains were isolated from 60 samples of diabetic foot ulcers. Predominant aerobic bacteria isolated from these infections were S. aureus (28%) followed by Enterobacteriaceae family (24%) including Escherichia coli (15%), Citrobacter spp. (4%), Enterobacter spp. (4%), and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp. (17%), Enterococcus spp. (15%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7%) and Acinetobacter spp. (4%). No Clostridium spp. were isolated and 4% Bacteroides fragilis obtained from anaerobic culture. All Gram-positive isolates were susceptible to linezolid while all Enterobacteriaceae showed sensitivity to imipenem. CONCLUSION: Most of DFIs specimens were poly microbial infection and predominant bacteria were S. aureus and B. fragilis. These wounds may require use of combined antimicrobial therapy for initial management.
TI  - Microbiology of Pelvic Lymphocyst Infection after Lymphadenectomy for Malignant Gynecologic Tumors.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pelvic lymphocyst infection is a rare complication after lymphadenectomy for malignant gynecologic tumors. Although medical therapy is a useful addition to surgical drainage, the appropriate antibiotic regimen is unknown because few studies have examined the causative organisms. The purpose of this case series was to identify the micro-organisms infecting pelvic lymphocysts. METHODS: This was a single-center, retrospective, case-series review conducted at a tertiary-care cancer center between October 2002 and March 2013. The participants included all patients who experienced their first pelvic lymphocyst infection after undergoing pelvic lymphadenectomy for cervical, endometrial, or ovarian cancer and exhibited positive lymphocyst fluid culture. Computed tomography- or sonography-guided percutaneous aspiration procedures were performed to obtain lymphocyst fluid for culture. RESULTS: During the study period, 878 patients underwent lymphadenectomy for gynecologic malignant tumors, and 13 developed a pelvic lymphocyst infection documented microbiologically. Cultures identified Staphylococcus aureus (three patients), S. epidermidis (one patient), Streptococcus agalactiae (three patients), Enterococcus (two patients), Escherichia coli (one patient), and anaerobic bacteria (three patients). They were all monomicrobial infections. CONCLUSIONS: Our study and other smaller ones suggest that lymphocyst infections following pelvic lymphadenectomy for malignant gynecologic tumors usually are monomicrobial and caused by gram-positive cocci, including Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, and Enterococcus, and anaerobes such as Bacteroides fragilis. These bacteria should be considered when selecting empiric antibiotic therapy.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and its susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents--special references to bacteria isolated between April 2010 and March 2011].
AB  - Bacteria isolated from surgical infections during the period from April 2010 to March 2011 were investigated in a multicenter study in Japan, and the following results were obtained. In this series, 631 strains including 25 strains of Candida spp. were isolated from 170 (81.7%) of 208 patients with surgical infections. Four hundred and twenty two strains were isolated from primary infections, and 184 strains were isolated from surgical site infection. From primary infections, anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria were predominant, followed by aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, while from surgical site infection aerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant, followed by anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria. Among aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Enterococcus spp. such as Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, and Enterococcus avium was highest, followed by Streptococcus spp. such as Streptococcus anginosus and Staphylococcus spp. such as Staphylococcus aureus, in this order, from primary infections, while Enterococcus spp. such as E. faecalis and E. faecium was highest, followed by Staphylococcus spp. such as S. aureus from surgical site infection. Among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in this order, and from surgical site infection, E. coli and R aeruginosa were most predominantly isolated, followed by E. cloacae and K. pneumoniae. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rates of Parvimonas micra, Eggerthella lenta, Streptococcus constellatus, Gemella morbillorum, and Collinsella aerofaciens were the highest from primary infections, and the isolation rate from surgical site infection was generally low. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of Bilophila wadsworthia was the highest from primary infections, followed by, Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides ovatus, and from surgical site infection, B. fragilis was most predominantly isolated, followed by Bacteroides thetaiotaomnicron, in this order. In this series, vancomycin-resistant MRSA (methicillin-resistant S. aureus), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp. and multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa were not observed.
TI  - Biofilm removal and antimicrobial activity of two different air-polishing powders: an in vitro study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Biofilm removal plays a central role in the prevention of periodontal and peri-implant diseases associated with microbial infections. Plaque debridement may be accomplished by air polishing using abrasive powders. In this study, a new formulation consisting of erythritol and chlorhexidine is compared with the standard glycine powder used in air-polishing devices. Their in vitro antimicrobial and antibiofilm effects on Staphylococcus aureus, Bacteroides fragilis, and Candida albicans are investigated. METHODS: Biofilm was allowed to grow on sandblasted titanium disks and air polished with glycine or erythritol-chlorhexidine powders. A semiquantitative analysis of biofilm by spectrophotometric assay was performed. A qualitative analysis was also carried out by confocal laser scanning microscopy. Minimum inhibitory concentrations and minimum microbicidal concentrations were evaluated, together with the microbial recovery from the residual biofilm after air-polishing treatment. RESULTS: The combination of erythritol and chlorhexidine displayed stronger antimicrobial and antibiofilm activity than glycine against all microbial strains tested. CONCLUSION: Air polishing with erythritol-chlorhexidine seems to be a viable alternative to the traditional glycine treatment for biofilm removal.
TI  - Distinct cytokine pattern in response to different bacterial pathogens in human brain abscess.
AB  - Brain abscess is a focal suppurative process. Host inflammatory response in Gram  type and specific bacteria has not been studied in brain abscess. A total of 57 brain abscess patients with monomicrobial infections were studied for Th1 (TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, IL1-beta), Th2 (IL-4, IL-10) and Th17 (IL-17, IL-23) cytokine response by reverse-transcriptase PCR and ELISA. Th1 and Th17 cytokines were significantly elevated in Gram positive (Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus intermedius) and Th2 cytokine (IL-10) in Gram negative (Bacteroides fragilis and Escherichia coli) infections (p<0.05). Cytokine levels were significantly higher in abscess than blood (p<0.001). Elevated levels of several inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, IL1-beta, IL-17 and IL-23) were associated with the duration of symptoms; predisposing factors also influenced the levels of several cytokines. The expression of inflammatory cytokines in abscess was influenced by the bacterial pathogen, duration of symptoms and predisposing factors. Local milieu of brain plays significant role in secretion of various cytokines.
TI  - Distinct polymicrobial populations in a chronic foot ulcer with implications for  diagnostics and anti-infective therapy.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Polymicrobial infections caused by combinations of different bacteria are being detected with an increasing frequency. The evidence of such complex infections is being revealed through the use of novel molecular and culture-independent methods. Considerable progress has been made in the last decade regarding the diagnostic application of such molecular techniques. In particular, 16S rDNA-based sequencing and even metagenomic analyses have been successfully used to study the microbial diversity in ecosystems and human microbiota. Here, we utilized denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) as a diagnostic tool for identifying different bacterial species in complex clinical samples of a patient with a chronic foot ulcer. CASE PRESENTATION: A 45-year-old female suffered from a chronic 5x5cm large plantar ulcer located in the posterior calcaneal area with subcutaneous tissue infection and osteomyelitis. The chronic ulcer developed over a period of 8 years. Culture and DHPLC revealed a distinct and location-dependent polymicrobial infection of the ulcer. The analysis of a superficial biopsy revealed a mixture of Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus vulgaris, and Fusobacterium nucleatum, whereas the tissue-deep biopsy harbored a mixture of four different bacterial species, namely Gemella morbillorum, Porphyromonas asaccharolytica, Bacteroides fragilis, and Arcanobacterium haemolyticum. CONCLUSIONS: This clinical case highlights the difficulties in assessing polymicrobial infections where a mixture of fastidious, rapid and slow growing bacteria as well as anaerobes exists as structured communities within the tissue architecture of chronic wound infections. The diagnosis of this multilayered polymicrobial infection led to a microbe-adapted antibiotic therapy, targeting the polymicrobial nature of this infection in addition to a standard local wound treatment. However, a complete wound closure could not be achieved due to the long-lasting extensive destruction of tissue.
TI  - Intraoperative vancomycin use in spinal surgery: single institution experience and microbial trends.
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case series. OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate the microbial  trends of spinal surgical site infections in patients who had previously received crystallized vancomycin in the operative bed. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Prior large, case control series demonstrate the significant decrease in surgical site infection with the administration of vancomycin in the wound bed. METHODS: A single institution, electronic database search was conducted for all patients who underwent spinal surgery who had received prophylactic crystalline vancomycin powder in the wound bed. Patients with a prior history of wound infection, intrathecal pumps, or spinal stimulators were excluded. RESULTS: A total of 981 consecutive patients (494 males, 487 females; mean age, 59.4 yr; range, 16-95 yr) were identified from January 2011 to June 2013. The average dose of vancomycin powder was 1.13 g (range, 1-6 g). Sixty-six patients (6.71%) were diagnosed with a surgical site infection, of which 51 patients had positive wound cultures (5.2%). Of the 51 positive cultures, the most common organism was Staphylococcus aureus. The average dose of vancomycin was 1.3 g in the 38 cases where a gram-positive organism was cultured. A number of gram-negative infections were encountered such as Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter aerogenes, Bacteroides fragilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter koseri, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The average dose of vancomycin was 1.2 g in 23 cases where a gram-negative infection was cultured. Fifteen of the 51 positive cultures (29.4%) were polymicrobial. Eight (53%) of these 15 polymicrobial cultures contained 3 or more distinct organisms. CONCLUSION: Prophylactic intraoperative vancomycin use in the wound bed in spinal surgery may increase the incidence of gram-negative or polymicrobial spinal infections. The use of intraoperative vancomycin may correlate with postoperative seromas, due to the high incidence of nonpositive cultures. Large, randomized, prospective trials are needed to demonstrate causation and dose-response relationship.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of traditional medicinal plants from Ankober District, North Shewa Zone, Amhara Region, Ethiopia.
AB  - CONTEXT: Traditional medicinal plants have long been used in Ethiopia to treat human and livestock ailments. Despite a well-documented rich tradition of medicinal plant use in the country, their direct antimicrobial effects are still poorly known. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the antimicrobial activity of 19 medicinal plant species that were selected based on the ethnobotanical information on their traditional use to treat infectious diseases in Ankober District. METHODS: About 23 different ethanol extracts of plants obtained by maceration of various parts of 19 medicinal plant species were studied for potential antimicrobial activity using a broth microdilution method against Bacillus cereus, Bacteroides fragilis, Candida albicans, Clostridium perfringens, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enteritidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus pyogenes. RESULTS: Plant extracts from Embelia schimperi Vatke (Myrsinaceae) showed the strongest antibacterial activity with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) value of 64 microg/ml against B. cereus, L. monocytogenes, and S. pyogenes. Growth inhibitory activities were also observed for extracts of Ocimum lamiifolium Hochst. (Lamiaceae) against S. pyogenes, and those of Rubus steudneri Schweinf. (Rosaceae) against S. epidermidis at an MIC value of 128 microg/ml. Generally, 74% of ethanol extracts (17 extracts) showed antimicrobial activity against one or more of the microbial strains tested at an MIC value of 512 microg/ml or below. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Results confirm the antimicrobial role of traditional medicinal plants of Ankober and warrant further investigations on promising medicinal plant species so as to isolate and characterise chemicals responsible for the observed strong antimicrobial activities.
TI  - ArdA proteins from different mobile genetic elements can bind to the EcoKI Type I DNA methyltransferase of E. coli K12.
AB  - Anti-restriction and anti-modification (anti-RM) is the ability to prevent cleavage by DNA restriction-modification (RM) systems of foreign DNA entering a new bacterial host. The evolutionary consequence of anti-RM is the enhanced dissemination of mobile genetic elements. Homologues of ArdA anti-RM proteins are encoded by genes present in many mobile genetic elements such as conjugative plasmids and transposons within bacterial genomes. The ArdA proteins cause anti-RM by mimicking the DNA structure bound by Type I RM enzymes. We have investigated ArdA proteins from the genomes of Enterococcus faecalis V583, Staphylococcus aureus Mu50 and Bacteroides fragilis NCTC 9343, and compared them to the ArdA protein expressed by the conjugative transposon Tn916. We find that despite having very different structural stability and secondary structure content, they can all bind to the EcoKI methyltransferase, a core component of the EcoKI Type I RM system. This finding indicates that the less structured ArdA proteins become fully folded upon binding. The ability of ArdA from diverse mobile elements to inhibit Type I RM systems from other bacteria suggests that they are an advantage for transfer not only between closely-related bacteria but also between more distantly related bacterial species.
TI  - Ceftaroline plus avibactam demonstrates bactericidal activity against pathogenic  anaerobic bacteria in a one-compartment in vitro pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model.
AB  - Anaerobic pathogens are often associated with polymicrobial infections, such as diabetic foot infections. Patients with these infections are often treated with broad-spectrum, multidrug therapies targeting resistant Gram-positive bacteria, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, as well as Gram-negative bacteria and anaerobes. The broad-spectrum, non-beta-lactam, beta-lactamase inhibitor avibactam has been combined with ceftaroline and may provide a single-product alternative for complicated polymicrobial infections. We compared the activity of ceftaroline-avibactam (CPA) to that of ertapenem (ERT) against common anaerobic pathogens in an in vitro pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) model. Simulations of doses of ceftaroline-fosamil at 600 mg every 8 h (q8h) (maximum free drug concentration [fCmax], 17.04 mg/liter, and half-life [t1/2], 2.66 h) plus avibactam at 600 mg q8h (fCmax, 11.72 mg/liter, and t1/2, 1.8 h) and of ertapenem at 1 g q24h (fCmax, 13 mg/liter, and t1/2, 4 h) were evaluated against two strains of Bacteroides fragilis, one strain of Prevotella bivia, and one strain of Finegoldia magna in an anaerobic one-compartment in vitro PK/PD model over 72 h with a starting inoculum of approximately 8 log10 CFU/ml. Bactericidal activity was defined as a reduction of >/=3 log10 CFU/ml from the starting inoculum. Both CPA and ERT were bactericidal against all four strains. CPA demonstrated improved activity against Bacteroides strains compared to that of ERT but had similar activity against Finegoldia magna and P. bivia, although modest regrowth was observed with CPA against P. bivia. No resistance emerged from any of the models. The pharmacokinetics achieved were 92 to 105% of the targets. CPA has potent in vitro activity against common anaerobic pathogens at clinically relevant drug exposures and may be a suitable single product for the management of complicated polymicrobial infections.
TI  - Growth-Inhibiting and morphostructural effects of constituents identified in Asarum heterotropoides root on human intestinal bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The growth-inhibiting and morphostructural effects of seven constituents identified in Asarum heterotropoides root on 14 intestinal bacteria were compared with those of the fluoroquinolone antibiotic ciprofloxacin. METHOD: A microtiter plate-based bioassay in sterile 96-well plates was used to evaluate the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the test materials against the organisms. RESULTS: delta-3-Carene (5) exhibited the most potent growth inhibition of Gram-positive bacteria (Clostridium difficile ATCC 9689, Clostridium paraputrificum ATCC 25780, Clostridium perfringens ATCC 13124, and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 12600) and Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli ATCC 11775 and Bacteroides fragilis ATCC 25285) (minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC), 0.18-0.70 mg/mL) except for Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium ATCC 13311 (MIC, 2.94 mg/mL). The MIC of methyleugenol (2), 1,8-cineole (3), alpha-asarone (4), (-)-asarinin (6), and pellitorine (7) was between 1.47 and 2.94 mg/mL against all test bacteria (except for compound 2 against C. difficile (0.70 mg/mL); compounds 1 (23.50 mg/mL) and 4 (5.80 mg/mL) against C. paraputricum; compounds 2 (5.80 mg/mL), 4 (12.0 mg/mL), and 7 (0.70 mg/mL) against C. perfringens); compound 1 against E. coli (7.20 mg/mL) and S. enterica serovar Typhimurium (12.0 mg/mL). Overall, all of the constituents were less potent at inhibiting microbial growth than ciprofloxacin (MIC, 0.063-0.25 mg/ mL). The lactic acid-producing bacteria (four bifidobacteria and two lactobacilli) and one acidulating bacterium Clostridium butyricum ATCC 25779 were less sensitive and more susceptible than the five harmful bacteria and two nonpathogenic bacteria (B. fragilis and E. coli) to the constituents and to ciprofloxacin, respectively. Beneficial Gram-positive bacteria and harmful and nonpathogenic Gram-negative bacteria were observed to have different degrees of antimicrobial susceptibility to the constituents, although the antimicrobial susceptibility of the harmful Gram-positive bacteria and the harmful and nonpathogenic Gram-negative bacteria was not observed. Scanning electron microscopy observations showed different degrees of physical damage and morphological alteration to both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria treated with alpha-asarone, delta-3-carene, pellitorine, or ciprofloxacin, indicating that they do not share a common mode of action. CONCLUSION: A. heterotropoides root-derived materials described merit further study as potential antibacterial products or lead molecules for the prevention or eradication from humans from diseases caused by harmful intestinal bacteria.
TI  - In vivo efficacy of humanized ceftaroline fosamil-avibactam exposures in a polymicrobial infection model.
AB  - Although Gram-positive cocci are the most common pathogens in diabetic foot infections, these infections often are polymicrobial. The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy of a simulated human dose of 600 mg ceftaroline fosamil-600 mg avibactam every 8 h as a 1-h infusion in a polymicrobial in vivo murine model. Seven isolates were used (3 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [MRSA] isolates, 1 methicillin-susceptible S. aureus [MSSA] isolate, 1 Escherichia coli isolate, 1 Enterobacter cloacae isolate, and 1 Bacteroides fragilis isolate) in various combinations in an immunocompromised polymicrobial tissue infection to assess the efficacy of the simulated regimen. Each infection was comprised of at least one S. aureus isolate with a MIC of 0.25 to 1 mug/ml and one Enterobacteriaceae isolate with a MIC of 1 or 4 mug/ml. Eight of 16 infections also included B. fragilis, with a MIC of 0.5 mug/ml, as a third organism. Efficacy was evaluated after 24 h as the change in log10 CFU from the level of 0-h controls. Efficacy was seen against all isolate combinations, with at least a 1-log kill against Enterobacteriaceae and a minimum of a 2-log kill against S. aureus and B. fragilis isolates. These bacterial reductions correlate with free drug concentration above the MIC (fT>MIC) produced by the humanized regimen of 100, 86, and 56% at MICs of 1, 2, and 4 mug/ml, respectively. The humanized regimen of 600 mg ceftaroline fosamil-600 mg avibactam every 8 h as a 1-h infusion showed predictable efficacy against all infections tested in this model. These data support further clinical investigation of ceftaroline fosamil-avibactam for the treatment of polymicrobial tissue infections.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activities of SMT19969, a new antimicrobial agent, against Clostridium difficile and 350 gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic intestinal flora isolates.
AB  - The comparative in vitro activity of SMT19969, a novel, narrow-spectrum, nonabsorbable agent, was studied against 50 ribotype-defined Clostridium difficile strains, 174 Gram-positive and 136 Gram-negative intestinal anaerobes, and 40 Gram-positive aerobes. SMT19969 was one dilution more active against C. difficile isolates (MIC range, 0.125 to 0.5 mug/ml; MIC90, 0.25 mug/ml), including ribotype 027 strains, than fidaxomicin (range, 0.06 to 1 mug/ml; MIC90, 0.5 mug/ml) and two to six dilutions lower than either vancomycin or metronidazole. SMT19969 and fidaxomicin were generally less active against Gram-negative anaerobes, especially the Bacteroides fragilis group species, than vancomycin and metronidazole, suggesting that SMT19969 has a lesser impact on the normal intestinal microbiota that maintain colonization resistance. SMT19969 showed limited activity against other Gram-positive anaerobes, including Bifidobacteria species, Eggerthella lenta, Finegoldia magna, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, with MIC90s of >512, >512, 64, and 64 mug/ml, respectively. Clostridium species showed various levels of susceptibility, with C. innocuum being susceptible (MIC90, 1 mug/ml) and C. ramosum and C. perfringens being nonsusceptible (MIC90, >512 mug/ml). Activity against Lactobacillus spp. (range, 0.06 to >512 mug/ml; MIC90, >512 mug/ml) was comparable to that of fidaxomicin and varied by species and strain. Gram-positive aerobic cocci (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, E. faecium, and streptococci) showed high SMT19969 MIC90 values (128 to >512 mug/ml).
TI  - Human colonic mucus is a reservoir for antimicrobial peptides.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: To prevent bacterial adherence and translocation, the colonic mucosa is covered by a protecting mucus layer and the epithelium synthesizes antimicrobial peptides. The present qualitative study investigated the contents and interaction of these peptides in and with rectal mucus. METHODS: Rectal mucus extracts were analyzed for antimicrobial activity and screened with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, Dot blot and immunohistochemistry for antimicrobial peptides. In addition, binding of AMPs to mucins was investigated by Western blot and enzyme-linked lectin assays. RESULTS: In functional tests the mucus layer exhibited a strong antimicrobial activity. We detected 11 antimicrobial peptides in mucus extracts from healthy persons including the defensins HBD-1 and -3, the cathelicidin LL-37, ubiquitin, lysozyme, histones, high mobility group nucleosome-binding domain-containing protein 2, ubiquicidin and other ribosomal proteins. AMPs were bound by mucins but this was demonstrated to be reversible and inhibition of antibacterial activity was limited. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that epithelial antimicrobial peptides are retained in the intestinal mucus layer without losing their efficacy. Thus, the mucus layer and its composition provide an attractive drug target to restore antimicrobial barrier function in intestinal diseases.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of ceftaroline, ceftaroline-avibactam, and other antimicrobial agents against aerobic and anaerobic bacteria cultured from infected diabetic foot wounds.
AB  - Foot infections are the most common infectious complication of diabetes. Moderate to severe diabetic foot infections (DFI) are typically polymicrobial with both aerobic and anaerobic organisms. The role of MRSA in these wounds has become an increasing concern. To determine if the addition of avibactam, a novel non-beta-lactam beta-lactamase inhibitor, to ceftaroline would be more active than ceftaroline alone, we tested 316 aerobic pathogens and 154 anaerobic recovered from patients with moderate to severe DFI, and compared ceftaroline with and without avibactam to other agents. Testing on aerobes was done by broth microdilution and by agar dilution for anaerobes, according to CLSI M11-A8, and M7-A8 standards. Ceftaroline-avibactam MIC90 for all Staphylococcus spp. including MRSA was 0.5 mug/mL, and for enterococci was 1 mug/mL. The MIC90s for enteric Gram-negative rods was 0.125 mug/mL. The addition of avibactam to ceftaroline reduced the ceftaroline MICs for 2 strains of resistant Enterobacter spp. and for 1 strain of Morganella. Against anaerobic Gram-positive cocci ceftaroline-avibactam had an MIC90 0.125 mug/mL and for clostridia 1 mug/mL. Avibactam improved ceftaroline's MIC90s for Bacteroides fragilis from >32 to 2 mug/mL and for Prevotella spp. from >32 to 1 mug/mL. Ceftaroline alone demonstrates excellent in vitro activity against most of the aerobes found in moderate to severe DFI. The addition of avibactam provides an increased spectrum of activity including the beta-lactamase producing Prevotella, Bacteroides fragilis and ceftaroline resistant gram-negative enteric organisms.
TI  - Candida albicans primes TLR cytokine responses through a Dectin-1/Raf-1-mediated  pathway.
AB  - The immune system is essential to maintain homeostasis with resident microbial populations, ensuring that the symbiotic host-microbial relationship is maintained. In parallel, commensal microbes significantly shape mammalian immunity at the host mucosal surface, as well as systemically. Candida albicans is an opportunistic pathogen that lives as a commensal on skin and mucosa of healthy individuals. Little is known about its capacity to modulate responses toward other microorganisms, such as colonizing bacteria (e.g., intestinal microorganisms). The aim of this study was to assess the cytokine production of PBMCs induced by commensal bacteria when these cells were primed by C. albicans. We show that C. albicans and beta-1,3-glucan induce priming of human primary mononuclear cells and this leads to enhanced cytokine production upon in vitro stimulation with TLR ligands and bacterial commensals. This priming requires the beta-1,3-glucan receptor dectin-1 and the noncanonical Raf-1 pathway. In addition, although purified mannans cannot solely mediate the priming, the presence of mannosyl residues in the cell wall of C. albicans is nevertheless required. In conclusion, C. albicans is able to modify cytokine responses to TLR ligands and colonizing bacteria, which is likely to impact the inflammatory reaction during mucosal diseases.
TI  - Sterility testing of apheresis hematopoietic progenitor cell products using an automated blood culture system.
AB  - BACKGROUND: AABB Standards require monitoring of hematopoietic progenitor cell (HPC) products for microbial contamination. To date, there is no automated blood culture system cleared by the Food and Drug Administration for this application. Our objective was to validate the VersaTREK system (TREK Diagnostic Systems) for sterility testing of apheresis HPC products. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Four aerobic bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus mitis, and Bacillus cereus), five anaerobic bacteria (Fusobacterium necrophorum, Clostridium perfringens, Bacteroides fragilis, Prevotella loescheii, and Propionibacterium acnes), and one fungus (Candida albicans) were spiked into apheresis HPC products at concentrations of 10, 10(2) , 10(3) , and 10(4) colony-forming units (CFUs)/mL. Aerobic and anaerobic bottles were incubated until positive or for up to 5 days. DNA was simultaneously extracted for polymerase chain reaction amplification of 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene. RESULTS: All aerobic bacteria grew in both bottles at all concentrations tested within 24 hours, and the time to positivity (TTP) was significantly shorter with aerobic bottles. C. albicans grew in the aerobic media at all concentrations within 30 hours. Anaerobes grew in the anaerobic bottle at all concentrations within 5 days. No bacteria were detected by using 16S rRNA gene amplification at 10(4) CFUs/mL. CONCLUSION: Compared to culture, 16S rRNA gene amplification of HPCs does not improve sensitivity or turnaround time for HPC sterility testing. The VersaTREK system is a reliable tool for detecting microbial contamination of apheresis HPC products with a limit of detection of less than or equal to 10 CFUs/mL. Inclusion of both the aerobic and the anaerobic culture bottles achieves the shortest TTP for all species tested.
TI  - Pharmacodynamic modelling of intravenous antibiotic prophylaxis in elective colorectal surgery.
AB  - Surgical-site infections are the leading cause of post-operative morbidity and mortality as well as increased costs following colorectal surgery. The purpose of this study was to evaluate different beta-lactam antimicrobial dosing regimens currently used for prophylaxis in elective colorectal procedures with the aim of identifying optimal antibiotics and dosing regimens. Serum pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters specific to each drug for use in pharmacodynamic (PD) modelling were obtained from the published literature. Susceptibility data for Escherichia coli, Bacteroides fragilis and Staphylococcus aureus for use in modelling simulations were obtained from the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST). Monte Carlo simulation was used to evaluate the influence of dose and dosing frequency of tested antibiotics to achieve a prophylaxis target fT>MIC (time during which the free drug concentration exceeds the pathogen minimum inhibitory concentration) of 100% for up to 4h. Ertapenem 1g, cefuroxime 1.5 g and cefazolin 2 g were the only antibiotic regimens that consistently yielded target fT>MIC of 100% for the entire 4-h post-dose interval and against all targeted organisms more than 90% of the time. In contrast, cefoxitin, cefotetan and ampicillin/sulbactam yielded very poor predicted PK/PD performances. In conclusion, this study demonstrates the value of, and need for, applied PD research in the area of surgical prophylaxis. Whether cefoxitin, cefotetan or ampicillin/sulbactam should continue to be advocated as first-line agents for prophylaxis during elective colorectal surgery, particularly at the standard doses currently being used, is debatable.
TI  - Microbiology of explanted suture segments from infected and noninfected surgical  patients.
AB  - Sutures under selective host/environmental factors can potentiate postoperative surgical site infection (SSI). The present investigation characterized microbial recovery and biofilm formation from explanted absorbable (AB) and nonabsorbable (NAB) sutures from infected and noninfected sites. AB and NAB sutures were harvested from noninfected (70.9%) and infected (29.1%) sites in 158 patients. At explantation, devices were sonicated and processed for qualitative/quantitative bacteriology; selective sutures were processed for scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Bacteria were recovered from 85 (53.8%) explanted sites; 39 sites were noninfected, and 46 were infected. Suture recovery ranged from 11.1 to 574.6 days postinsertion. A significant difference in mean microbial recovery between noninfected (1.2 isolates) and infected (2.7 isolates) devices (P < 0.05) was noted. Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), Peptostreptococcus spp., Bacteroides fragilis, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Serratia spp. were recovered from infected devices, while commensal skin flora was recovered from noninfected devices. No significant difference in quantitative microbial recovery between infected monofilament and multifilament sutures was noted. Biofilm was present in 100% and 66.6% of infected and noninfected devices, respectively (P < 0.042). We conclude that both monofilament and braided sutures provide a hospitable surface for microbial adherence: (i) a significant difference in microbial recovery from infected and noninfected sutures was noted, (ii) infected sutures harbored a mixed flora, including multidrug-resistant health care-associated pathogens, and (iii) a significant difference in the presence or absence of a biofilm in infected versus noninfected explanted devices was noted. Further studies to document the benefit of focused risk reduction strategies to minimize suture contamination and biofilm formation postimplantation are warranted.
TI  - Nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of pathogens isolated from surgical site infections (SSI) in Japan.
AB  - To investigate the trends of antimicrobial resistance in pathogens isolated from  surgical site infections (SSI), a Japanese surveillance committee conducted the first nationwide survey. Seven main organisms were collected from SSI at 27 medical centers in 2010 and were shipped to a central laboratory for antimicrobial susceptibility testing. A total of 702 isolates from 586 patients with SSI were included. Staphylococcus aureus (20.4 %) and Enterococcus faecalis (19.5 %) were the most common isolates, followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (15.4 %) and Bacteroides fragilis group (15.4 %). Methicillin-resistant S. aureus among S. aureus was 72.0 %. Vancomycin MIC 2 mug/ml strains accounted for 9.7 %. In Escherichia coli, 11 of 95 strains produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (Klebsiella pneumoniae, 0/53 strains). Of E. coli strains, 8.4 % were resistant to ceftazidime (CAZ) and 26.3 % to ciprofloxacin (CPFX). No P. aeruginosa strains produced metallo-beta-lactamase. In P. aeruginosa, the resistance rates were 7.4 % to tazobactam/piperacillin (TAZ/PIPC), 10.2 % to imipenem (IPM), 2.8 % to meropenem, cefepime, and CPFX, and 0 % to gentamicin. In the B. fragilis group, the rates were 28.6 % to clindamycin, 5.7 % to cefmetazole, 2.9 % to TAZ/PIPC and IPM, and 0 % to metronidazole (Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron; 59.1, 36.4, 0, 0, 0 %). MIC(9)(0) of P. aeruginosa isolated 15 days or later after surgery rose in TAZ/PIPC, CAZ, IPM, and CPFX. In patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score >/=3, the resistance rates of P. aeruginosa to TAZ/PIPC and CAZ were higher than in patients with ASA </=2. The data obtained in this study revealed the trend of the spread of resistance among common species that cause SSI. Timing of isolation from surgery and the patient's physical status affected the selection of resistant organisms.
TI  - Proteolytic activity by multiple bacterial species isolated from chronic venous leg ulcers degrades matrix substrates.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A major feature of chronic wounds is the loss of tissue, with the exposure of dermal components preventing primary closure and leading to bacterial colonization. Bacterial colonization has been proposed as one of the common underlying pathologies present in chronic wounds. The objective of this exploratory study was to identify bacteria cultured from chronic venous leg ulcers and test for proteolytic activity that degrades matrix substrates. METHOD: Bacteria were isolated, cultured, and identified from six subjects (average age = 62.8 years) over 2-10 months under an approved protocol using swabs and microbiological culture media. Proteolytic activity against (a) gelatin, (b) an elastin substrate, and (c) a serine/trypsin-sensitive substrate was determined using a colorimetric plate assay with an ELISA plate reader and zymography. RESULTS: We identified 13 bacteria that expressed proteolytic activity against one or more of the tested substrates. Of these, six were Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus agalactiae, Corynebacterium, and Streptococcus bovis) and seven were Gram-negative (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Bacteroides fragilis, and Serratia marcescens) organisms. Two of these, S. aureus and P. aeruginosa, are recognized wound pathogens. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple bacteria species isolated from colonized venous leg ulcers have the capacity to secrete proteases capable of degrading components of the extracellular matrix important for wound healing. Matrix degradation by bacteria may contribute to delays in tissue deposition and repair, suggesting that treatment of chronic wounds should include appropriate management of colonizing bacteria.
TI  - Synthesis and biological activity of a novel series of 17-azapentacyclo [6.6.5.0(2.7).0(9.14).0(15,19)]nonadeca-2,4,6,9,11,13-hexaen-16,18-dione derivatives.
AB  - In the search for novel antimicrobial agents, a series of new derivatives - N-substituted imides were prepared. All of the compounds were characterized by 'H NMR and ESI MS spectra. These derivatives were tested for antimicrobial activity. Microorganisms used in this study included aerobic and facultative anaerobic bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and obligatory anaerobes such as Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and Propionibacterium acnes. Moreover, Candida albicans yeast was used. For representatives of all species the MICs of the investigated compounds were determined. Most of investigated derivatives had no antimicrobial activity (MIC > 512 mg/L) except the derivative 22 which showed slight activity against Gram-positive aerobes and anaerobes.
TI  - The effect of environmental conditions on expression of Bacteroides fragilis and  Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron C10 protease genes.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron are members of  the normal human intestinal microbiota. However, both organisms are capable of causing opportunistic infections, during which the environmental conditions to which the bacteria are exposed change dramatically. To further explore their potential for contributing to infection, we have characterized the expression in B. thetaiotaomicron of four homologues of the gene encoding the C10 cysteine protease SpeB, a potent extracellular virulence factor produced by Streptococcus pyogenes. RESULTS: We identified a paralogous set of genes (btp genes) in the B. thetaiotaomicron genome, that were related to C10 protease genes we recently identified in B. fragilis. Similar to C10 proteases found in B. fragilis, three of the B. thetaiotaomicron homologues were transcriptionally coupled to genes encoding small proteins that are similar in structural architecture to Staphostatins, protease inhibitors associated with Staphopains in Staphylococcus aureus. The expression of genes for these C10 proteases in both B. fragilis and B. thetaiotaomicron was found to be regulated by environmental stimuli, in particular by exposure to oxygen, which may be important for their contribution to the development of opportunistic infections. CONCLUSIONS: Genes encoding C10 proteases are increasingly identified in operons which also contain genes encoding proteins homologous to protease inhibitors. The Bacteroides C10 protease gene expression levels are responsive to different environmental stimuli suggesting they may have distinct roles in the bacterial-host interaction.
TI  - [Antimicrobial susceptibility of clinical isolates of aerobic gram-positive cocci and anaerobic bacteria in 2008].
AB  - The activity of antibacterial agents against aerobic Gram-positive cocci (25 genus or species, 1029 strains) and anaerobic bacteria (21 genus or species, 187 strains) isolated from clinical specimens in 2008 at 16 clinical facilities in Japan were studied using either broth microdilution or agar dilution method. The ratio of methicillin-resistant strains among Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis was 59.6% and 81.2%, suggesting that resistant strains were isolated at high frequency. Vancomycin (VCM), linezolid (LZD) and quinupristin/dalfopristin (QPR/DPR) had good antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant S. aureus and methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis, with MIC90s of < or = 2 microg/mL. The ratio of penicillin (PC) intermediate and resistant strains classified by mutations of PC-binding proteins among Streptococcus pneumoniae was 92.0% that was highest among our previous reports. Cefpirome, carbapenems, VCM, teicoplanin (TEIC), LZD and QPR/DPR had MIC90s of < or = 1 microg/mL against PC-intermediate and resistant S. pneumoniae strains. Against all strains of Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium, the MICs of VCM and TEIC were under 2 microg/mL, and no resistant strain was detected, suggesting that these agents had excellent activities against these species. 15.9% of E. faecalis strains and 1.2% of E. faecium strains showed intermediate to LZD. 17.1% of E. faecium strains showed intermediate or resistant to QPR/DPR. Against all strains of Clostridium difficile, the MIC of VCM was under 1 microg/mL, suggesting that VCM had excellent activity. Carbapenems showed good activity against Clostridiales, Bacteroides spp., and Prevotella spp., but one strain of Bacteroides fragilis showed resistant to carbapenems. And so, the susceptibility of this species should be well-focused in the future at detecting continuously.
TI  - Ceftaroline fosamil in the treatment of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia and acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections.
AB  - Ceftaroline fosamil is a cephalosporin antibacterial approved by the US Food and  Drug Administration (FDA) for use in the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) and community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP). After intravenous administration, ceftaroline fosamil is rapidly converted to its bioactive metabolite, ceftaroline. Ceftaroline has broad-spectrum in vitro activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including contemporary resistant Gram-positive phenotypes, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and multidrug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. Because of its unique spectrum of activity, the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) designated ceftaroline as a member of a new subclass of beta-lactam antimicrobials, cephalosporins with anti-MRSA activity. The activity of ceftaroline against S. aureus extends to heteroresistant vancomycin-intermediate, vancomycin-intermediate, vancomycin-resistant and daptomycin-nonsusceptible isolates. Ceftaroline has low minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for all tested species of streptococci, and has potent activity against S. pneumoniae isolates with varying degrees of penicillin resistance. The activity of ceftaroline is limited against Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium and against anaerobes such as Bacteroides fragilis. The in vitro activity of ceftaroline includes many Gram-negative pathogens, but does not extend to bacteria that produce extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, class B metallo-beta-lactamases or AmpC cephalosporinases, or to most nonfermentative Gram-negative bacilli. Ceftaroline fosamil has been studied for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSI) and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in phase III randomized, double-blind, international, multicentre noninferiority clinical trials. Two identical trials (CANVAS 1 and CANVAS 2) compared the efficacy of ceftaroline fosamil with that of vancomycin plus aztreonam in 1378 adults with cSSSI. Results demonstrated that ceftaroline was noninferior to vancomycin plus aztreonam, with 91.6% in the ceftaroline fosamil group (pooled analysis) achieving clinical response compared with 92.7% in the vancomycin plus aztreonam group (difference -1.1%, 95% CI -4.2, 2.0). An additional analysis evaluated clinical cure in a subgroup of patients who met the FDA guidance definition of ABSSSI at treatment day 3. Clinical response, defined as cessation of lesion spread and absence of fever, was 74.0% in the ceftaroline fosamil group compared with 66.2% in the vancomycin plus aztreonam group (treatment difference 7.8%, 95% CI 1.3, 14.0). Clinical efficacy of ceftaroline fosamil in 1240 hospitalized adults with CAP was compared with that of ceftriaxone in two additional phase III trials (FOCUS 1 and FOCUS 2). Of note, because ceftriaxone does not have activity against MRSA, patients with confirmed or suspected MRSA CAP were excluded from the FOCUS trials. Results demonstrated that ceftaroline was noninferior to ceftriaxone, with 84.3% in the ceftaroline fosamil group achieving clinical cure compared with 77.7% in the ceftriaxone group (difference 6.7%, 95% CI 1.6, 11.8). An additional analysis of the trials was conducted in patients with moderate to severe CAP and at least one proven typical bacterial pathogen at baseline (i.e. CABP). Day 4 clinical response rates were 69.5% for ceftaroline and 59.4% for ceftriaxone (difference 10.1%, 95% CI -0.6, 20.6). In the phase III trials, adverse event rates were similar between groups. Overall, ceftaroline is well tolerated, which is consistent with the good safety and tolerability profile of the cephalosporin class. In summary, ceftaroline fosamil is a broad-spectrum parenteral cephalosporin with excellent in vitro activity against resistant Gram-positive pathogens, including MRSA, as well as many common Gram-negative organisms. It is a welcome treatment option for ABSSSI and CABP.
TI  - Nosocomial diarrhea: evaluation and treatment of causes other than Clostridium difficile.
AB  - Diarrhea is common among hospitalized patients but the causes are distinct from those of diarrhea in the community. We review existing data about the epidemiology of nosocomial diarrhea and summarize recent progress in understanding the mechanisms of diarrhea. Clinicians should recognize that most cases of nosocomial diarrhea have a noninfectious etiology, including medications, underlying illness, and enteral feeding. Apart from Clostridium difficile, the frequency of infectious causes such as norovirus and toxigenic strains of Clostridium perfringens, Klebsiella oxytoca, Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacteroides fragilis remains largely undefined and test availability is limited. Here we provide a practical approach to the evaluation and management of nosocomial diarrhea when tests for C. difficile are negative.
TI  - Bacterial pathogens related to chronic suppurative otitis media in individuals with cleft palate: bacteriological culture and polymerase chain reaction.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To characterize the microbial etiology of chronic suppurative otitis media comparing the methods of classical bacteriological culture and polymerase chain reaction. DESIGN/SETTING/PATIENTS: Bacteriological analysis by classical culture and by molecular polymerase chain reaction of 35 effusion otitis samples from patients with cleft lip and palate attending the Hospital for Rehabilitation of Craniofacial Anomalies of the University of Sao Paulo, Bauru, Brazil. INTERVENTIONS: Collection of clinical samples of otitis by effusion through the external auditory tube. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Otolaryngologic diagnosis of chronic suppurative otitis media. RESULTS: Positive cultures were obtained from 83% of patients. Among the 31 bacterial lineages the following were isolated. In order of decreasing frequency: Pseudomonas aeruginosa (54.9%), Staphylococcus aureus (25.9%), and Enterococcus faecalis (19.2%). No anaerobes were isolated by culture. The polymerase chain reaction was positive for one or more bacteria investigated in 97.1% of samples. Anaerobe lineages were detected by the polymerase chain reaction method, such as Fusobacterium nucleatum , Bacteroides fragilis , and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius . CONCLUSIONS: Patients with cleft lip and palate with chronic suppurative otitis media presented high frequency of bacterial infection in the middle ear. The classical bacteriological culture did not detect strict anaerobes, whose presence was identified by the polymerase chain reaction method.
TI  - Therapeutic equivalence requires pharmaceutical, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic identities: true bioequivalence of a generic product of intravenous metronidazole.
AB  - Animal models of infection have been used to demonstrate the therapeutic failure  of "bioequivalent" generic products, but their applicability for this purpose requires the accurate identification of those products that are truly bioequivalent. Here, we present data comparing one intravenous generic product of metronidazole with the innovator product in a neutropenic mouse thigh anaerobic infection model. Simultaneous experiments allowed comparisons (generic versus innovator) of potency and the concentration of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API), analytical chemistry (liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry [LC/MS]), in vitro susceptibility testing, single-dose serum pharmacokinetics (PK) in infected mice, and in vivo pharmacodynamics (PD) against Bacteroides fragilis ATCC 25825 in synergy with Escherichia coli SIG-1 in the neutropenic mouse thigh anaerobic infection model. The Hill dose-response model followed by curve-fitting analysis was used to calculate and compare primary and secondary PD parameters. The generic and the innovator products were identical in terms of the concentration and potency of the API, chromatographic and spectrographic profiles, MIC and minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBC) (2.0 mg/liter), and mouse PK. We found no differences between products in bacteriostatic doses (BD) (15 to 22 mg/kg of body weight per day) or the doses needed to kill 1 log (1LKD) (21 to 29 mg/kg per day) or 2 logs (2LKD) (28 to 54 mg/kg per day) of B. fragilis under dosing schedules of every 12 h (q12h), q8h, or q6h. The area under the concentration-time curve over 24 h in the steady state divided by the MIC (AUC/MIC ratio) was the best PD index to predict the antibacterial efficacy of metronidazole (adjusted coefficient of determination [AdjR(2)] = 84.6%), and its magnitude to reach bacteriostasis in vivo (56.6 +/- 5.17 h) or to kill the first (90.8 +/- 9.78 h) and second (155.5 +/- 22.2 h) logs was the same for both products. Animal models of infection allow a thorough demonstration of the therapeutic equivalence of generic antimicrobials.
TI  - Microbiology of acute and chronic maxillary sinusitis in smokers and nonsmokers.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the microbiology of sinus aspirates of smokers and nonsmokers with acute and chronic maxillary sinusitis. METHODS: Cultures were obtained from 458 patients, 244 (87 smokers and 157 nonsmokers) of whom had acute maxillary sinusitis and 214 (84 smokers and 130 nonsmokers) of whom had chronic maxillary sinusitis, between 2001 and 2007. RESULTS: A greater number of Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S aureus (MRSA), and beta-lactamase-producing bacteria (BLPB) were found in the 87 smokers with acute sinusitis than in the nonsmokers with acute sinusitis (p < 0.005, p < 0.025, and p < 0.05, respectively). A greater number of these organisms were found in the 84 smokers with chronic sinusitis than in the nonsmokers (p < 0.01, p < 0.025, and p < 0.001, respectively). Eighty-five BLPB isolates were recovered from 73 patients (30%) with acute sinusitis. These included Moraxella catarrhalis, S aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Prevotella spp, and Fusobacterium spp; 40 BLPB isolates were found in smokers, and 45 in nonsmokers (p < 0.05). One hundred twenty-five BLPB isolates were recovered from 91 patients (43%) with chronic sinusitis, including M catarrhalis, Bacteroides fragilis group, S aureus, H influenzae, Prevotella spp, and Fusobacterium spp; 69 BLPB isolates were found in smokers, and 56 in nonsmokers (p < 0.001). Antimicrobial therapy had been administered in the past month to 130 patients (28%; 60 smokers and 70 nonsmokers; p <0.025). Both MRSA and BLPB were isolated more often from these individuals (p < 0.025). However, the higher isolation rates of MRSA and BLPB in smokers were independent of previous antimicrobial therapy. CONCLUSIONS: These data illustrate a greater frequency of isolation of S aureus, MRSA, and BLPB in patients with acute and chronic sinusitis who smoke.
TI  - [Microbiology of surgical site infections in abdominal tract surgery patients].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Knowledge of the microbiology of surgical infections after abdominal surgery can be of use when prescribing effective empirical antibiotic treatments. METHOD: Analysis of surgical infections after abdominal surgery in patients enrolled in the Prevalence of Infections in Spanish Hospitals (EPINE) corresponding to the years 1999-2006. RESULTS: During the period of the study, 2,280 patients who were subjected to upper or lower abdominal tract surgery were diagnosed with an infection at the surgical site (SSI). Eight hundred and eighty three patients (37%) had an operation of the upper abdominal tract (gastric, hepatobiliary, and pancreatic surgery) and 1,447 patients (63%) lower abdominal tract surgery (appendectomy and colon surgery). A total of 2,617 bacterial species were isolated in the 2,280 patients included in the analysis. The most frequent microorganisms isolated were, Escherichia coli (28%), Enterococcus spp. (15%), Streptococcus spp. (8%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7%), and Staphylococcus aureus (5%, resistant to methicillin 2%). In the surgical infections after upper abdominal tract procedures, there were a higher proportion of isolations of staphylococci, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter spp., Acinetobacter spp. and Candida albicans and less Escherichia coli, Bacteroides fragilis and Clostridium spp. CONCLUSION: The microbiology of SSI produced after upper abdominal tract surgery did not show any significant differences compared to those of the lower tract. However, more cases of SSI were detected due to staphylococci, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter spp., Acinetobacter spp. and Candida albicans and less caused by Escherichia coli, Bacteroides fragilis and Clostridium spp.
TI  - Recovery of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in sinus fungal ball.
AB  - This case study with chart review describes the aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of specimens obtained from 47 patients with Aspergillus spp fungus ball. Bacteria were recovered from 32 of the 47 (68%) patients. Eighty-six isolates, 29 aerobic and facultatives and 57 anaerobic, were recovered. Aerobic and facultatives only were recovered in 6 instances (19% of culture-positive specimens), anaerobes only in 11 (34%), and mixed aerobes and anaerobes in 15 (47%). The predominant aerobes were Staphylococcus aureus (6 isolates), alpha-hemolytic streptococci (5 isolates), Enterobacteriacae (4 isolates), and microaerophilic streptococci (4 isolates). The predominant anaerobes were Gram-negative bacilli (26), Peptostreptococcus spp (14), and Fusobacterium spp. (10). Twenty-two beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were recovered from 15 patients. These included all 6 S aureus and 2 Bacteroides fragilis group isolates, 4 of 10 of Fusobacteria, and 7 of 19 Prevotella and Porphyromonas. This study demonstrates the recovery of polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic flora in the sinuses of patients with fungus ball.
TI  - A study of the microbiology of breast abscess in a teaching hospital in Kuwait.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the microbiological profile of breast abscess and assess the antibiotic susceptibility of the causative agents. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data obtained from cases of breast abscess over a period of 3.5 years, June 2006 to December 2009, were retrospectively analyzed. Specimens were cultured using optimal aerobic and anaerobic microbiological techniques. The antibiotic susceptibility test was carried out using the methods recommended by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. One specimen per patient was analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 114 patients, 107 (93.8%) non-lactating and 7 (6.1%) lactating women were diagnosed with breast abscess during this period. Of the 114 specimens, 83 (73%) yielded bacterial growth. Of these, 115 pathogens were isolated with an average of 1.4 pathogens per abscess. Eighteen (22%) of the 83 specimens yielded mixed bacterial growth. There were more Gram-positive pathogens (60, 52%) than anaerobes (32, 28%) and Gram-negative pathogens (22, 19%). The predominant organisms were methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (37, 32%), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA; 11, 10%), Bacteroides spp. (16, 14%), anaerobic streptococci (14, 12%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (9, 8%). Of the 48 S. aureus, MRSA accounted for 11 (23%). All MRSA isolates were susceptible to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and vancomycin. CONCLUSION: S. aureus was the most common pathogenic organism isolated in breast abscesses at Al-Amiri Hospital, Kuwait, of which 23% were MRSA. Nearly a third of the cases were caused by anaerobes, particularly B. fragilis. The data present a basis for the formation of empirical antimicrobial therapeutic policy in the management of breast abscess.
TI  - [Nationwide surveillance of parenteral antibiotics containing meropenem activities against clinically isolated strains in 2009].
AB  - The antibacterial activity of meropenem (MEPM) and other parenteral antibiotics against clinical isolates of 2655 strains including 810 strains of Gram-positive bacteria, 1635 strains of Gram-negative bacteria, and 210 strains of anaerobic bacteria obtained from 30 medical institutions during 2009 was examined. The results were as follows; (1) MEPM was more active than the other carbapenem antibiotics tested against Gram-negative bacteria, especially against enterobacteriaceae and Haemophilus influenzae. MEPM was also active against most of the species tested in Gram-positive and anaerobic bacteria, except for multidrug resistant strains including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). (2) MEPM maintained potent and stable antibacterial activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The proportion of MEPM-resistant strains to ciprofloxacin-resistant strains or imipenem-resistant strains were 53.1% and 58.0% respectively. (3) The proportion of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) strains was 3.1% (26 strains) in enterobacteriaceae. And the proportion of metallo-beta-lactamase strains was 2.0% (6 strains) in P. aeruginosa. (4) Of all species tested, there were no species except for Bacteroides fragilis group, which MIC90 of MEPM was more than 4-fold higher than those in our previous study. Therefore, there is almost no significant decrease in susceptibility of clinical isolates to meropenem. In conclusion, the results from this surveillance study suggest that MEPM retains its potent and broad antibacterial activity and therefore is a clinically useful carbapenem for serious infections treatment at present, 14 years passed after available for commercial use in Japan.
TI  - [Antimicrobial susceptibility of clinical isolates of aerobic Gram-positive cocci and anaerobic bacteria in 2006].
AB  - The activity of antibacterial agents against aerobic Gram-positive cocci (26 species, 1022 strains) and anaerobic bacteria (23 species, 184 strains) isolated from clinical specimens in 2006 at 16 clinical facilities in Japan were studied using either broth microdilution or agar dilution method. The ratio of methicillin-resistant strains among Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis was 53.0% and 65.8%, suggesting that resistant strains were isolated at high frequency. Vancomycin (VCM) and quinupristin/dalfopristin (QPR/DPR) had good antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant S. aureus and methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis, with MIC90s of < or = 2 micrcog/mL. The ratio of penicillin (PC) intermediate and resistant strains classified by mutations of PC-binding proteins among Streptococcus pneumoniae was 87.6%. Ceftriaxone, cefpirome, cefepime, carbapenem antibiotics, VCM, teicoplanin, linezolid(LZD) and QPR/DPR had MIC90s of < or = 1 microg/mL against PC-intermediate and resistant S. pneumoniae strains. Against all strains of Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium, the MICs of VCM and TEIC were under 2 microg/mL, and no resistant strain was detected, suggesting that these agents had excellent activities against these species. 10.9% of E. faecalis strains or 3.5% of E. faecium strains showed intermediate or resistant to LZD. 24.4% of E. faecium strains showed intermediate or resistant to QPR/DPR. Against all strains of Clostridium difficile, the MIC of VCM were under 1 microg/mL, suggesting that VCM had excellent activity against C. difficile. Carbapenems showed good activity against Peptococcaceae, Bacteroides spp., and Prevotella spp. However since several strains of Bacteroides fragilis showed resistant to carbapenems and the susceptibility of this species should be well-focused in the future.
TI  - Predictive factors for lower extremity amputations in diabetic foot infections.
AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the epidemiology of diabetic foot infections (DFIs) and its predictive factors for lower extremity amputations. A prospective study of 100 patients with DFIs treated at the National University Hospital of Singapore were recruited in the study during the period of January 2005-June 2005. A protocol was designed to document patient's demographics, type of DFI, presence of neuropathy and/or vasculopathy and its final outcome. Predictive factors for limb loss were determined using univariate and stepwise logistic regression analysis. The mean age of the study population was 59.8 years with a male to female ratio of about 1:1 and with a mean follow-up duration of about 24 months. All patients had type 2 diabetes mellitus. Common DFIs included abscess (32%), wet gangrene (29%), infected ulcers (19%), osteomyelitis (13%), necrotizing fasciitis (4%) and cellulitis (3%). Thirteen patients were treated conservatively, while surgical debridement or distal amputation was performed in 59 patients. Twenty-eight patients had major amputations (below or above knee) performed. Forty-eight percent had monomicrobial infections compared with 52% with polymicrobial infections. The most common pathogens found in all infections (both monomicrobial and polymicrobial) were Staphylococcus aureus (39.7%), Bacteroides fragilis (30.3%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (26.0%) and Streptococcus agalactiae (21.0%). Significant univariate predictive factors for limb loss included age above 60 years, gangrene, ankle-brachial index (ABI) <0.8, monomicrobial infections, white blood cell (WBC) count >/= 15.0x10(9)/L, erythrocyte sedimentation rate >/=100 mm/hr, C-reactive protein >/=15.0 mg/dL, hemoglobin (Hb) </=10.0g/dL and creatinine >/=150 micromol/L. Upon stepwise logistic regression, only gangrene, ABI <0.8, WBC >/= 15.0x10(9)/L and Hb </=10.0g/dL were significant.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents --special references to bacteria isolated between April 2008 and March 2009].
AB  - Bacteria isolated from infections in abdominal surgery during the period from April 2008 to March 2009 were investigated in a multicenter study in Japan, and the following results were obtained. In this series, 712 strains including 18 strains of Candida spp. were isolated from 173 (80.5%) of 215 patients with surgical infections. Three hundred and sixty-six strains were isolated from primary infections, and 346 strains were isolated from postoperative infections. From primary infections, anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria were predominant, followed by aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, while from postoperative infections aerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant, followed by anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria. Among aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Enterococcus spp. was highest, followed by Streptococcus spp., and Staphylococcus spp. in this order, from primary infections, while Enterococcus spp. was highest, followed by Staphylococcus spp. from postoperative infections. Among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, in this order, and from postoperative infections, P aeruginosa was most predominantly isolated, followed by E. coli, Enterobacter cloacae, and K. pneumoniae. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Eggerthella lenta was the highest from primary infections, followed by Parvimonas micra, Streptococcus constellatus and Gemella morbillorum, and from postoperative infections, E. lenta was most predominantly isolated. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of Bacteroides fragilis was the highest from primary infections, followed by Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides ovatus and Bilophila wadsworthia, and from postoperative infections, B. fragilis was most predominantly isolated, followed by B. thetaiotaomicron, B. wadsworthia and B. ovatus, in this order. In this series, we noticed no vancomycin-resistant methicillin-resistant S. aureus, and Enterococcus spp., nor multidrug-resistant P aeruginosa. We should carefully follow up B. wadsworthia which was resistant to various antibiotics, and also Bacteroides spp. which was resistant to many beta-lactam antibiotics.
TI  - In vitro activity of tigecycline against patient isolates collected during phase  3 clinical trials for diabetic foot infections.
AB  - The in vitro activity of tigecycline and comparative antimicrobial agents was evaluated against 1828 primary baseline pathogens isolated from 844 patients enrolled in the phase 3 clinical trials investigating the efficacy of tigecycline in diabetic foot infection (DFI). The trials were global, enrolling patients in 30 countries. Tigecycline was active against the most prevalent pathogens in DFI, including Gram-positive and Gram-negative isolates of both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria with 95% of MICs < or =2 microg/mL for the entire collection. The spectrum of activity of tigecycline included important pathogens for DFI, such as Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Bacteroides fragilis. As reported previously, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and several pathogens in the Proteeae group were generally less susceptible to tigecycline by comparison to other Gram-negative pathogens. The excellent in vitro expanded broad-spectrum activity of tigecycline in the clinical isolates confirmed the potential utility of tigecycline for pathogens associated with DFIs.
TI  - Susceptibility to tigecycline of isolates from samples collected in hospitalized  patients with secondary peritonitis undergoing surgery.
AB  - Activity of tigecycline against nosocomial secondary peritonitis isolates collected along 18 months in 29 Spanish hospitals was tested by Etest in a central laboratory, considering Food and Drug Administration (FDA)/British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy (BSAC)/European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) breakpoints. A total of 600 facultative/aerobic isolates (392 Gram negative, 208 Gram positive) and 100 anaerobes were tested. None of the 220 Escherichia coli isolates was resistant to tigecycline (MIC(50)/MIC(90) = 0.25/0.5 microg/mL), with 0.5% (FDA breakpoint) and 3.6% (BSAC/EUCAST breakpoint) intermediate strains. All Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing E. coli isolates (15 strains), all Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Klebsiella oxytoca isolates (42 strains) were susceptible to tigecycline. No isolates resistant to tigecycline were found among Streptococcus viridans, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecium, but 18.9% of Enterococcus faecalis strains were intermediate following BSAC/EUCAST breakpoints. All (but 1) isolates of the Bacteroides fragilis group (n = 45) were tigecycline susceptible, as well as Gram-positive anaerobes. Tigecycline offers an adequate activity profile against isolates from secondary peritonitis when tested by Etest regardless of the breakpoints used for categorization.
TI  - Intra-abdominal infections: etiology, epidemiology, microbiological diagnosis and antibiotic resistance.
AB  - Intra-abdominal infections (IAIs) are commonly encountered in clinical practice.  The etiology of these infections, often polymicrobial in nature, can be variable and usually includes organisms derived from the gut microbiota. in community-acquired IAIs enterobacteria predominate (mostly Escherichia coli) in combination with anaerobes (mostly Bacteroides fragilis). In nosocomial IAIs, which can complicate abdominal surgery, other pathogens can also play a role, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus spp. and Candida spp. Diagnostic microbiology of IAIs is complex and plays a relevant role, especially in some situations (e.g. presence of foreign bodies, potential presence of resistant or uncommon pathogens, nosocomial infections in subjects with risk factors). Antibiotic resistance issues are currently encountered in most pathogenic species causing IAIs. Resistance affects all major classes of antimicrobial agents, often involving multiple classes and resulting in complex resistance phenotypes for which only a very limited number of drugs remain active.
TI  - Infections in patients with aplastic anemia.
AB  - Infection is a major cause of death in patients with aplastic anemia (AA). There  are differences between the immunocompromised state of a patient with AA and the patient who is neutropenic due to chemotherapy and this leads to a difference in the infections that they incur. Prolonged neutropenia is one of the largest risk factors for the development of infections with the invasive mycoses and bacteria. Recovery from neutropenia is directly related to survival, and supportive care plays a large role in protection while the patient is in a neutropenic state. The most common invasive mycoses include the Aspergillus species, Zygomycetes, Candida spp., and Fusarium spp. Bacterial infections that are seen in patients with AA include gram-positive coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species, Enterococcus, Staphylococus aureus, Clostridium spp., Micrococcus, alpha-hemolytic streptococci, Listeria monocytogenes, and Bacillus cereus. Gram-negative infections including gram-negative bacilli, Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Bacteroides fragilis, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumonia, Aeromonas hydrophilia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Vibrio vulnificus. Viral infections are much less common but include those that belong to the Herpesviridae family, community-acquired respiratory viral infection, and the viral hepatitides A, B, and C. Evidence of the parasite Strongyloides stercoralis has also been documented. This review discusses the major invasive fungal infections, bacterial pathogens, parasites, and viral infections that are found in patients with AA who are treated with immunosuppressive therapy. The specific immune impairment and current treatment parameters for each of these classes of infection will also be discussed.
TI  - Doripenem.
AB  - Carbapenems play a significant role in the current antibiotic armamentarium. Doripenem is the newest carbapenem to be commercially released. Its antimicrobial spectrum more closely resembles those of meropenem and imipenem than that of ertapenem. Thus, it has significant in vitro activity against streptococci, methicillin-susceptible staphylococci, Enterobacteriaceae (including extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strains), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter species, and Bacteroides fragilis. Doripenem does not have clinically useful activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, and the majority of gram-negative bacilli that are resistant to meropenem or imipenem. In vitro, resistant P. aeruginosa mutants appear to be harder to select with doripenem than with other carbapenems. Doripenem has been approved for use in treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infection and complicated urinary tract infection. Studies of hospital-acquired pneumonia have also been completed, including one that used a 4-h infusion to enhance the pharmacodynamic profile. In vitro, doripenem lacks the propensity to cause seizures, and a low risk of seizures has been demonstrated in clinical studies. Currently unanswered questions regarding doripenem include the utility and dosing in neonatal, pediatric, and cystic fibrosis populations and specific dosage recommendations for patients receiving hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, or continuous renal replacement therapies. The longevity of doripenem will depend on our ability to curtail the spread of carbapenem-resistant organisms, which are already a significant problem at some institutions.
TI  - Ceftaroline: a novel broad-spectrum cephalosporin with activity against meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Ceftaroline is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin currently under clinical investigation for the treatment of complicated skin and skin-structure infections (cSSSI), including those caused by meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Ceftaroline has the ability to bind to penicillin-binding protein (PBP)2a, an MRSA-specific PBP that has low affinity for most other beta-lactam antibacterials. The high binding affinity of ceftaroline to PBP2a (median inhibitory concentration 0.90 microg/mL) correlates well with its low minimum inhibitory concentration for MRSA. Ceftaroline is active in vitro against Gram-positive cocci, including MRSA, meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis, penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (not E. faecium). The broad-spectrum activity of ceftaroline includes many Gram-negative pathogens but does not extend to extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing or AmpC-derepressed Enterobacteriaceae or most nonfermentative Gram-negative bacilli. Ceftaroline demonstrates limited activity against anaerobes such as Bacteroides fragilis and non-fragilis Bacteroides spp. Limited data show that ceftaroline has a low propensity to select for resistant subpopulations. Ceftaroline fosamil (prodrug) is rapidly converted by plasma phosphatases to active ceftaroline. For multiple intravenous doses of 600 mg given over 1 h every 12 hours for 14 days, the maximum plasma concentration was 19.0 microg/mL and 21.0 microg/mL for first and last dose, respectively. Ceftaroline has a volume of distribution of 0.37 L/kg (28.3 L), low protein binding (<20%) and a serum half-life of 2.6 hours. No drug accumulation occurs with multiple doses and elimination occurs primarily through renal excretion (49.6%). Based on Monte Carlo simulations, dosage adjustment is recommended for patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30-50 mL/min); no adjustment is needed for mild renal impairment. Currently, limited clinical trial data are available for ceftaroline. A phase II study randomized 100 patients with cSSSI to intravenous ceftaroline 600 mg every 12 hours or intravenous vancomycin 1 g every 12 hours with or without intravenous aztreonam 1 g every 8 hours (standard therapy) for 7-14 days. Clinical cure rates were 96.7% for ceftaroline compared with 88.9% for standard therapy. Adverse events were similar between groups and generally mild in nature. In a phase III trial, 702 patients with cSSSI were randomized to ceftaroline 600 mg or vancomycin 1 g plus aztreonam 1 g, each administered intravenously every 12 hours for 5-14 days. Ceftaroline was noninferior to vancomycin plus aztreonam in treating cSSSI caused by both Gram-positive and -negative pathogens. Adverse event rates were similar between groups. Ceftaroline is well tolerated, which is consistent with the good safety and tolerability profile of the cephalosporin class. In summary, ceftaroline is a promising treatment for cSSSI and CAP, and has potential to be used as monotherapy for polymicrobial infections because of its broad-spectrum activity. Further clinical studies are needed to determine the efficacy and safety of ceftaroline, and to define its role in patient care.
TI  - Clinical features and prognostic factors of anaerobic infections: a 7-year retrospective study.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Risk factors for mortality resulting from anaerobic infection are incompletely defined. The clinical significance of a broad range of pathogenic obligate anaerobic organisms was examined, and factors independently associated with mortality were identified in patients with clinically significant anaerobic infections. METHODS: The medical records of 1,050 patients with anaerobic infections were retrospectively reviewed at Severance Hospital in Seoul, Korea. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 54.1+/-16.8 years, and 57.7% were men. Overall, 320 (30.5%) patients with case-defined illness experienced pain at the affected site, and 230 (21.9%) experienced pus flow from lesions. Ten (1.4%) patients presented with shock, and 80.3% of the clinically significant cases were polymicrobial anaerobic infections. The mean number of pathogens, including aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, was 3.7+/-1.0 (minimum 1, maximum 5), and the number of anaerobic organisms was 1.0+/-0.3 in each specimen. The major pathogens by rank were the Bacteroides fragilis group, which accounted for 41.8% of anaerobic infections, followed by Clostridium spp. (11.8%), Prevotella spp. (9.4%), and Peptostreptococcus spp. (8.4%). Escherichia coli (17.5%), Staphylococcus aureus (7.5%), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (7.5%) were common concomitant aerobic organisms. The overall crude mortality rate resulting from anaerobic infection was 29.7%. Among the determining factors associated with mortality, liver disease (p=0.003) and old age (p=0.005) were significant in multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Anaerobic infection is polymicrobial and has a significant role in morbidity and mortality. Underlying liver disease was associated with poor prognosis in anaerobic infection.
TI  - Management of severe abdominal infections.
AB  - Abdominal infections are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Nearly all bacteria causing abdominal infections are derived from the endogenous flora of the alimentary tract. The resulting infection is typically polymicrobial and comprised of both aerobic and anaerobic microbes. They can be classified by their severity as uncomplicated and complicated or by their origin as community or hospital acquired. Escherichia coli and Bacteroides fragilis are the most frequently isolated bacteria in community-acquired abdominal infections. Nosocomial infections typically involve a more resistant flora (e.g. Pseudomonas spp., Acinetobacter spp., Gram-negative bacilli producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases [ESBL], vancomycin-resistant enterococci [VRE] and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [MRSA]). Antimicrobial therapy should be guided by microbiological testing and frequently requires other interventions as well. In uncomplicated infections antimicrobial prophylaxis for < 24h may be considered. Patients with underlying or acquired immunodeficiency, i.e. organ transplant recipients and other patients on complex immunosuppressant regimens require special attention and antimicrobial coverage. We discuss the relevant microbiota, a rational diagnostic and therapeutic approach including strategies to handle challenging infections. The application of novel compounds and/or drug classes for abdominal infections such as glycylcyclines (i.e. tigecycline), glycopeptides (i.e. dalbavancin, telavancin, oritavancin), carbapenems (i.e. doripenem), and forth generation cephalosporins (i.e. ceftaroline, ceftobiprole) as well as patents on metalloproteinase and caspase inhibitors, interleukin antagonists, fusion proteins and nitric oxide donators is critically reviewed. The information is summarized in flow charts and algorithms for use in daily clinical practice and the review article also shows the useful information of the patents for the treatment of abdominal infections.
TI  - Review of the guidelines for complicated skin and soft tissue infections and intra-abdominal infections--are they applicable today?
AB  - Difficult-to-treat infections in surgical patients, such as serious skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) and complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAIs), are the cause of significant morbidity and mortality, and carry an economic burden. These surgical site infections are typically polymicrobial infections caused by a plethora of pathogens, which include difficult-to-treat organisms and multiresistant Gram-positive and Gram-negative strains. Optimal management of SSTIs and cIAIs must take into account the presence of resistant pathogens, and depends on the administration of appropriate antimicrobial therapy (i.e. the correct spectrum, route and dose in a timely fashion for a sufficient duration as well as the timely implementation of source control measures). Treatment recommendations from the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the Surgical Infection Society are available for guidance in the management of both of these infections, yet the increased global prevalence of multidrug-resistant pathogens has complicated the antibiotic selection process. Several pathogens of concern include methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, responsible for problematic postoperative infections, especially in patients with SSTIs, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Gram-negative bacteria, including CTX-M-type-producing Escherichia coli strains, and multidrug-resistant strains of Bacteroides fragilis. New empirical regimens, taking advantage of potent broad-spectrum antibiotic options, may be needed for the treatment of certain high-risk patients with surgical site infections.
TI  - [Antibacterial therapy of patients with complicated diabetic foot].
AB  - The main reason for hospitalization and lethality of patients with diabetes mellitus are the infectious complications of the lower limbs. In the period 2000-2005, 147 were treated for complications with the diabetic foot in the Surgical Clinic at the Ministry of Interior Medical Institute. 105 of them were men and 42 - women. The average age of the patients was 67 +/- 8.2. Different number of microorganisms, from 2 to 8, was identified in testing the material from the wound secret. Mixed (anaerobic-aerobic) infection was found in 135 patients (91.8%), and only aerobic infection - in 12 patients (8.2%). Staphylococcus aureus (61%) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (21%) were the most often found ones from the facultative-anaerobic microorganisms in the associations. Bacteroides fragilis (23%), Peptococcus spp. (19%) and Fusobacterium spp. (11%) were the most often found ones from the sporogenic anaerobic microorganisms. The empirical and etiotropic antibacterial therapy, the different combinations of antibacterial preparations and the results of their application were discussed.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and its susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents--special references to bacteria isolated between April 2006 and March 2007].
AB  - Tendency of isolated bacteria from infections in abdominal surgery during the period from April 2006 to March 2007 were investigated in a multicenter study in Japan, and the following results were obtained. In this series, 474 strains including 23 strains of Candida spp. were isolated from 170 (75.2%) of 226 patients with surgical infections. Two hundred and twenty-six strains were isolated from primary infections, and 224 strains were isolated from postoperative infections. From primary infections, anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria were predominant, followed by aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, while from postoperative infections aerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant, followed by anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria. Among aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Staphylococcus spp. was higher from postoperative infections, while Enterococcus spp. was higher from primary infections. Among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, in this order, and from postoperative infections, P. aeruginosa was the most predominantly isolated, followed by E. coli and E. cloacae. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of Bilophila wadsworthia was the highest from primary infections, followed by Bacteroides fragilis and from postoperative infections, B. fragilis was most predominately isolated, followed by Bacteroides caccae, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and B. wadsworthia in this order. In this series, we noticed no methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, nor multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa. There were three strains of methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative Staphylococcus aureus, but all of them had good susceptibilities against various anti-MRSA antibiotics. We should carefully follow up B. wadsworthia.
TI  - [Etiology, epidemiology and microbiological diagnosis of intra-abdominal infections].
AB  - Intra-abdominal infections (IAIs) are commonly encountered in clinical practice.  The etiology of these infections, often polymicrobial in nature, can be variable and usually includes organisms derived from the gut microbiota. In community-acquired IAIs enterobacteria predominate (mostly Escherichia coli) in combination with anaerobes (mostly Bacteroides fragilis). In nosocomial IAIs, which can complicate abdominal surgery, other pathogens can also play a role, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus spp. e Candida spp. Diagnostic microbiology of IAIs is complex and plays a relevant role especially in some situations (e. g. presence of foreign bodies, potential presence of resistant or uncommon pathogens, nosocomial infections in subjects with risk factors). Antibiotic resistance issues are currently encountered in most pathogenic species causing IAIs. Resistance affects all major classes of antimicrobial agents, often involving multiple classes and resulting in complex resistance phenotypes for which only a very limited number of drugs remain active.
TI  - Microbial contamination of the Tzu-Chi Cord Blood Bank from 2005 to 2006.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In total, 4502 units of cord blood (CB) were collected during a 2-year period from 2005 to 2006 by the Buddhist Tzu-Chi Stem Cells Center. The aim of this study was to analyze the incidence of microbial contamination and type of organism present in the cord blood. The clinical impact of microbial contamination on hematopoietic progenitor cell (HPC) grafts used for HPC transplantation is also discussed. METHODS: First and second specimens were obtained for microbial assessment. These were collected in laboratory after cord blood collection and after cord blood unit manipulation, respectively. The samples were cultured and the results reviewed. RESULTS: The overall incidence of microbiological contamination was 1.8% (82/4502). Three CB units were contaminated with two different organisms. Infectious organisms comprised 9.4% (8/85) of total isolated microbes. These infectious microorganisms were beta-Streptococci group B, Candida tropicalis and Staphylococcus aureus which were isolated in 6, 1 and 1 of CB units respectively. Escherichia coli, Bacteroides fragilis, Lactobacillus spp., Enterococcus, beta-Streptococcus Group B, Bacteroides valgatus, Corynebacterium spp., Klebsiella pneumonia and Peptococcus spp. were the most frequently encountered microorganisms. A higher contamination rate of the CB units was noted after vaginal delivery (2.16%) compared to caesarian section (0.85%) (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Extensive training in CB collection, good procedures and good protocols can decrease the rate of microbial contamination. The use of a closed collecting system and an ex utero method have the advantage of a lower contamination rate. In our cord blood bank, we use a closed system but an in utero method. Similar to other studies, most of microorganisms reported here as contaminants are non-pathogenic.
TI  - Ceftobiprole: a review of a broad-spectrum and anti-MRSA cephalosporin.
AB  - Ceftobiprole, an investigational cephalosporin, is currently in phase III clinical development. Ceftobiprole is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin with demonstrated in vitro activity against Gram-positive cocci, including meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and meticillin-resistant S. epidermidis, penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Gram-negative bacilli including AmpC-producing Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but excluding extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strains. Like cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, and cefepime, ceftobiprole demonstrates limited activity against anaerobes such as Bacteroides fragilis and non-fragilis Bacteroides spp. In single-step and serial passage in vitro resistance development studies, ceftobiprole demonstrated a low propensity to select for resistant subpopulations. Ceftobiprole, like cefepime, is a weak inducer and a poor substrate for AmpC beta-lactamases.Ceftobiprole medocaril, the prodrug of ceftobiprole, is converted by plasma esterases to ceftobiprole in <30 minutes. Peak serum concentrations of ceftobiprole observed at the end of a single 30-minute infusion were 35.5 mug/mL for a 500-mg dose and 59.6 mug/mL for a 750-mg dose. The volume of distribution of ceftobiprole is 0.26 L/kg ( approximately 18 L), protein binding is 16%, and its serum half-life is approximately 3.5 hours. Ceftobiprole is renally excreted ( approximately 70% in the active form) and systemic clearance correlates with creatinine clearance, meaning that dosage adjustment is required in patients with renal dysfunction. Ceftobiprole has a modest post-antibiotic effect (PAE) of approximately 0.5 hours for MRSA and a longer PAE of approximately 2 hours for penicillin-resistant pneumococci. Ceftobiprole, when administered intravenously at 500 mg once every 8 hours (2-hour infusion), has a >90% probability of achieving f T(>MIC) (free drug concentration exceeds the minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC]) for 40% and 60%, respectively, of the dosing interval for isolates with ceftobiprole MIC < or =4 and < or =2 mg/L, respectively.Currently, only limited clinical trial data are published for ceftobiprole. In a phase III trial, 784 patients with Gram-positive skin infections were randomized to treatment with either ceftobiprole 500 mg or vancomycin 1 g, each administered twice daily for 7-14 days; 93.3% of patients were clinically cured with ceftobiprole compared with 93.5% receiving vancomycin, and the eradication rate for MRSA infections was 91.8% for ceftobiprole compared with 90% for vancomycin. A phase III, randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial compared ceftobiprole 500 mg every 8 hours with vancomycin 1 g every 12 hours plus ceftazidime 1 g every 8 hours in patients with complicated skin and skin structure infections. Of the 828 patients enrolled, 31% had diabetic foot infections, 30% had abscesses, and 22% had wounds. No difference in clinical cure was reported in the clinically evaluable, intent-to-treat and microbiologically evaluable populations with cure rates of 90.5%, 81.9%, and 90.8%, respectively, in the ceftobiprole-treated patients and 90.2%, 80.8%, and 90.5%, respectively, in the vancomycin plus ceftazidime-treated group. Microbiologic eradication of Gram-positive cocci meticillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) [ceftobiprole 91% vs vancomycin plus ceftazidime 92%] and MRSA (ceftobiprole 87% vs vancomycin plus ceftazidime 80%), as well as Gram-negative bacilli, E. coli (ceftobiprole 89% vs vancomycin plus ceftazidime 92%), and P. aeruginosa (ceftobiprole 87% vs vancomycin plus ceftazidime 100%), was not significantly different between groups. Similar cures rates in the microbiologically evaluable population occurred in both groups for Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL)-positive MSSA and PVL-positive MRSA.Currently, ceftobiprole has completed phase III trials for complicated skin and skin structure infections due to MRSA and nosocomial pneumonia due to suspected or proven MRSA; phase III trials are also ongoing in community-acquired pneumonia. Ceftobiprole has so far demonstrated a good safety profile in preliminary studies with similar tolerability to comparators. The broad-spectrum activity of ceftobiprole may allow it to be used as monotherapy in situations where a combination of antibacterials might be required. Further clinical studies are needed to determine the efficacy and safety of ceftobiprole and to define its role in patient care.
TI  - Assessment of antimicrobial microspheres as a prospective novel treatment targeted towards the repair of perianal fistulae.
AB  - BACKGROUND: None of the proposed materials tested for the management of perianal  fistulae has proven to be a definitive treatment. AIM: To assess a new repair scaffold and drug delivery device conceived to target perianal fistula repair. METHODS: Poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) porous microspheres containing either antibacterial silver-releasing degradable phosphate glass or metronidazole were prepared using thermally induced phase separation. RESULTS: Ion- and drug-release profiling of the microspheres revealed continued release of silver ions from microspheres filled with silver-doped phosphate glass and high encapsulation efficiency for metronidazole [78% and 82% for microspheres loaded with 2.5% and 1.3% (w/w), respectively]. Microbicidal activity was confirmed by growth inhibition of bacterial species (Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Bacteroides fragilis), which characteristically dominate the colonization of perianal fistula tracts. Microspheres containing >3 mol% silver or metronidazole resulted in strong bacterial inhibition/kill against B. fragilis; the presence of one sphere containing >3 mol% silver had a potent inhibitory effect against all the microbes studied. Microspheres became rapidly integrated with host tissue following subcutaneous implantation into a rodent wound model. CONCLUSION: The study demonstrates a novel scaffold for guided tissue regeneration providing local release of antimicrobial agents sufficient to counter bacterial colonization and warrants further investigation.
TI  - Studies of photokilling of bacteria using titanium dioxide nanoparticles.
AB  - Metal pins used to apply skeletal traction or external fixation devices protruding through skin are susceptible to the increased incidence of pin site infection. In this work, we tried to establish the photokilling effects of titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanoparticles on an orthopedic implant with an in vitro study. In these photocatalytic experiments, aqueous TiO2 was added to the tested microorganism. The time effect of TiO2 photoactivation was evaluated, and the loss of viability of five different bacteria suspensions (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus hirae, and Bacteroides fragilis) was examined by the viable count procedure. The bactericidal effect of TiO2 nanoparticle-coated metal plates was also tested. The ultraviolet (UV) dosage used in this experiment did not affect the viability of bacteria, and all bacteria survived well in the absence of TiO2 nanoparticles. The survival curve of microorganisms in the presence of TiO2 nanoparticles showed that nearly complete killing was achieved after 50 min of UV illumination. The formation of bacterial colonies above the TiO2 nanoparticle-coated metal plates also decreased significantly. In this study, we clearly demonstrated the bactericidal effects of titanium dioxide nanoparticles. In the presence of UV light, the titanium dioxide nanoparticles can be applicable to medical facilities where the potential for infection should be controlled.
TI  - [Psoas abscess of the adult: study of 38 cases].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Our aim is to report the clinical aspects, the etiologies, the treatment and the evolution of the psoas abscess in the adult. METHODS: Our retrospective study concerns 38 cases of psoas abscesses collected in the Department of Infectious Diseases of Sfax (Tunisia), over a period of 16 years (January 1990 - December 2005). RESULTS: The average age is 44 years (extremes: 16-76 years). The sex-ratio is 1.4. Six patients were diabetics and one had a chronic renal injury at the stage of hemodialysis. The clinical manifestations were: a fever (76.4%), an abdomino-pelvic ache (84.2%) and a psoitis (34.2%). All patients had a biologic inflammatory syndrome with a hyperleucocytosis in 28 cases. The abscess was one-sided in 29 cases and bilateral in 9 cases. After microbiological study and/or histological study, pathogens were identified in 31 patients, they were Staphylococcus aureus (10 cases), Staphylococcus lugdunensis (1 case), Streptococci (3 cases), Escherichia coli (2 cases), Bacteroides fragilis (1 case), Actinomyces (2 cases), Brucella (3 cases), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (8 cases) and Candida glabrata (1 case). The psoas abscess was primary in 10 cases and secondary in 28 cases. All the patients received an antibiotherapy or an antifungal therapy adapted to the micro-organism in cause, with a drainage of the abscess in 25 cases (surgical in 9 cases and percutaneous in 16 cases). The evolution was favourable in 36 cases. One patient presented recurrences and one patient died. CONCLUSION: The psoas abscess of the adult is characterized by a polymorphe clinical presentation. Germs in cause are very variable.
TI  - [Abscess of the posterior cranial fossa. Report of 4 cases].
AB  - The posterior cerebral fossa is an uncommon location for cerebral abscess. In most cases diagnosis is made at the encapsulation stage with the risk of life-threatening tonsillar herniation. The purpose of this retrospective study was to describe our experience in the management of four cases of abscess located in the posterior cerebral fossa between January 2000 and December 2004. All patients benefited from clinical examination and radiological study (CT-scan). Surgical treatment performed in all cases consisted of trepano-puncture of the abscess. The minimum duration of post-operative follow-up was 6 months. Mean patient age was 38.75 years. All patients presented infectious syndrome and intracranial hypertension. The male:female sex ratio was 3:1. A history of chronic middle ear otitis was noted in two patients. Diagnosis of abscess in the posterior cerebral fossa was confirmed by CT-scan in 2 cases. Cholesteatoma and triventricular hydrocephaly were noted in 2 cases. All patients benefited from trepano-puncture of the abscess. Bacteriologic study of pus was positive for Staphylococcus aureus in 1 case, and Providencia Sp associated with Bacteroides fragilis in another. Second-stage radical mastoidectomy was performed in 2 cases. One patient died. The outcome was favorable in 3 cases. Because of the small size of the posterior cerebral fossa, abscess in that location requires emergency treatment. Delay can be life-threatening due to the risk of obstructive hydrocephaly and tonsillar herniation.
TI  - Determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration of four medicaments used as intracanal medication.
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of iodoform, calcium hydroxide, IKI (iodine potassium iodine) and CFC (ciprofloxacin, Flagyl (metronidazole) and calcium hydroxide) required to kill S. aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis and B. fragilis. In the experiment, medicaments were added to bacterial species into test tubes, in 10 different concentrations. The MIC was the lowest concentration of the drug at which bacterial growth could not be observed. In this investigation, CFC was the most effective medicament against all bacteria. All drugs were able to eliminate E. faecalis and B. fragilis, while IKI was not effective against S. aureus. IKI and calcium hydroxide were not able to eliminate P. aeruginosa as well.
TI  - In vitro activities of doripenem and six comparator drugs against 423 aerobic and anaerobic bacterial isolates from infected diabetic foot wounds.
AB  - Against 182 anaerobe and 241 aerobe strains obtained from diabetic foot infections, doripenem was the most active carbapenem against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC(90), 2 microg/ml), more active than imipenem against Proteus mirabilis, and ertapenem was more active against Escherichia coli and Klebsiella spp. The MIC(50) and MIC(90) values were < or =0.125 microg/ml for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus and all streptococci and 0.25/1 for Bacteroides fragilis.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of DC-159a, a new fluoroquinolone.
AB  - DC-159a is a new 8-methoxy fluoroquinolone that possesses a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, with extended activity against gram-positive pathogens, especially streptococci and staphylococci from patients with community-acquired infections. DC-159a showed activity against Streptococcus spp. (MIC(90), 0.12 microg/ml) and inhibited the growth of 90% of levofloxacin-intermediate and -resistant strains at 1 microg/ml. The MIC 90s of DC-159a against Staphylococcus spp. were 0.5 microg/ml or less. Against quinolone- and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains, however, the MIC 90 of DC-159a was 8 microg/ml. DC-159a was the most active against Enterococcus spp. (MIC 90, 4 to 8 microg/ml) and was more active than the marketed fluoroquinolones, such as levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and moxifloxacin. The MIC 90s of DC-159a against Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Klebsiella pneumoniae were 0.015, 0.06, and 0.25 microg/ml, respectively. The activity of DC-159a against Mycoplasma pneumoniae was eightfold more potent than that of levofloxacin. The MICs of DC-159a against Chlamydophila pneumoniae were comparable to those of moxifloxacin, and DC-159a was more potent than levofloxacin. The MIC 90s of DC-159a against Peptostreptococcus spp., Clostridium difficile, and Bacteroides fragilis were 0.5, 4, and 2 microg/ml, respectively; and among the quinolones tested it showed the highest level of activity against anaerobic organisms. DC-159a demonstrated rapid bactericidal activity against quinolone-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae strains both in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, DC-159a showed faster killing than moxifloxacin and garenoxacin. The bactericidal activity of DC-159a in a murine muscle infection model was revealed to be superior to that of moxifloxacin. These activities carried over to the in vivo efficacy in the murine pneumonia model, in which treatment with DC-159a led to bactericidal activity superior to those of the other agents tested.
TI  - Role of anaerobes in acute pelvic inflammatory disease.
AB  - Pouch of Douglas aspirates were collected from 50 women with history and examination suggestive of acute pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and 20 healthy women admitted for tubal ligation served as control. A total of 57 microorganisms were isolated from 37 patients out of 50 in study group. Of 37 positive cultures 21(56.7%) were monomicrobial and 16(43.2%) were polymicrobial. Most common symptom in study group was lower abdominal pain (90%), vaginal discharge (70%) and irregular bleeding (40%) and 30% patients had history of intrauterine contraceptive device (IUCD) implantation. The predominant aerobic isolates were Escherichia coli, Coagulase Negative Staphylococcus (CONS), Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae while common anaerobes were Bacteroides fragilis, Prevotella melaninogenica, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Peptostreptococcus spp. Our study shows that cefotaxime, cefuroxime and gentamicin may be used for gram negative aerobic bacilli; cloxacillin, cephaloridine and erythromycin for aerobic gram positive cocci and amikacin and ceftazidime for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Thus for optimum therapy of acute PID it is beneficial to keep in mind major conceptual changes and therapeutic realities that have influenced current understanding of acute PID and have affected the choice of therapy.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and its susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents--special references to bacteria isolated between april 2003 and march 2004].
AB  - Tendency of isolated bacteria from infections in abdominal surgery during the period from April 2005 to March 2006 were investigated in a multicenter study in Japan, and the following results were obtained. In this series, 384 strains including 18 strains of Candida spp. were isolated from 161 (70.3%) of 229 patients with surgical infections. One hundred and ninty-five strains were isolated from primary infections, and 171 strains were isolated from postoperative infections. From primary infections, aerobic Gram-negative bacteria and aerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant, while aerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant from postoperative infections. The isolation rate of aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, such as Enterococcus spp. and Staphylococcus aureus were higher from both types of infections. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Peptostreptococcus spp. was the highest from both types of infections. Among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella spp. in this order, and from postoperative infections, E. coli was the most predominantly isolated, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of Bacteroides fragilis group was the highest from both primary and postoperative infections. In this series, we noticed no vancomycin-resistant Gram-positive cocci, nor multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa. But cefazolin-resistant E. coli producing extended spectrum fl-lactamase was seen in 5.0 per cents. We should be carefully followed up the facts that the increasing isolation rates of B. fragilis group and Bilophila wadsworthia which were resistant to both penicillins and cephems.
TI  - Bacteriology of moderate-to-severe diabetic foot infections and in vitro activity of antimicrobial agents.
AB  - As part of a United States-based multicenter clinical trial, conducted from 2001  to 2004, that compared ertapenem to piperacillin-tazobactam for the treatment of moderate-to-severe diabetic foot infections (DFIs), we obtained 454 pretreatment specimens from 433 patients. After debridement, the investigators collected wound specimens, mostly by curettage or biopsy, and sent them to the R. M. Alden Research Laboratory for aerobic and anaerobic culture. Among the 427 positive cultures, 83.8% were polymicrobial, 48% grew only aerobes, 43.7% had both aerobes and anaerobes, and 1.3% had only anaerobes. Cultures yielded a total of 1,145 aerobic strains and 462 anaerobic strains, with an average of 2.7 organisms per culture (range, 1 to 8) for aerobes and 2.3 organisms per culture (range, 1 to 9) for anaerobes. The predominant aerobic organisms were oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (14.3%), oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (4.4%), coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species (15.3%), Streptococcus species (15.5%), Enterococcus species (13.5%), Corynebacterium species (10.1%), members of the family Enterobacteriaceae (12.8%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (3.5%). The predominant anaerobes were gram-positive cocci (45.2%), Prevotella species (13.6%), Porphyromonas species (11.3%), and the Bacteroides fragilis group (10.2%). Pure cultures were noted for 20% of oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus cultures, 9.2% of Staphylococcus epidermidis cultures, and 2.5% of P. aeruginosa cultures. Two or more species of Staphylococcus were present in 13.1% of the patients. Ertapenem and piperacillin-tazobactam were each active against >98% of the enteric gram-negative rods, methicillin-sensitive S. aureus, and anaerobes. Among the fluoroquinolones, 24% of anaerobes, especially the gram-positive cocci, were resistant to moxifloxacin; 27% of the gram-positive aerobes but only 6% of the members of the family Enterobacteriaceae were resistant to levofloxacin. Moderate-to-severe DFIs are typically polymicrobial, and almost half include anaerobes. Our antibiotic susceptibility results can help to inform therapeutic choices.
TI  - Infections related to coils used for embolization of arteries: review of the published evidence.
AB  - The embolization of arteries with the use of coils has been an advance in the management of patients such as those at risk for aneurysm rupture. However, this procedure is not without complications. A systematic review was undertaken to evaluate the available evidence regarding infectious complications directly related to endovascular coil embolization. Seven case reports of patients who experienced infection related to coils used for embolization of arteries were discovered. Arteries embolized with coils in these patients were intracranial, intraabdominal, and intrathoracic, respectively, in four, two, and one case. Abscess formation in the area of coil placement (n = 6; 85.7%) was the most common infectious complication directly related to endovascular coil embolization. Staphylococcus aureus was the predominant isolated pathogen (n = 3; 42.9%). Other isolated pathogens included Salmonella species type D (n = 1; 14.3%), S. epidermidis (n = 1; 14.3%), Escherichia coli (n = 1; 14.3%), and Bacteroides fragilis (n = 1; 14.3%). Surgical procedures were performed in four of the seven patients described (57.1%), and three patients were treated with only the administration of antimicrobial agents. All reviewed patients were cured. Even though it may partially be a result of reporting bias, the scarcity of reports describing infections directly related to endovascular coils despite the increasing number of patients who received this treatment in various parts of the world suggests that infectious complications associated with this foreign endovascular material are very rare. However, the existence of the identified case reports suggests that clinicians should include coil-related infection in the differential diagnosis of patients with fever after this procedure.
TI  - Soluble CD14 and CD83 from human neonatal antigen-presenting cells are inducible  by commensal bacteria and suppress allergen-induced human neonatal Th2 differentiation.
AB  - CD14 is expressed on the cell surface of various antigen-presenting cells, and CD83 is a maturation marker for dendritic cells (DC). CD14 and CD83 are also present as soluble proteins, and both have immunoregulatory functions. We examined whether neonatal cord blood monocytes or DC released soluble CD14 (sCD14) or sCD83 when exposed to the commensal intestinal bacteria Clostridium perfringens, Staphylococcus aureus, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Escherichia coli, and Bacteroides fragilis. We found that the gram-positive bacteria C. perfringens and S. aureus, but not gram-negative bacteria, induced the release of sCD14 from monocytes. DC, on the other hand, released sCD14 in response to both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Moreover, the expression of the virulence factor staphylococcal protein A seemed to be important for S. aureus-induced sCD14 production from both monocytes and DC. Soluble CD83 was released from DC, but not from monocytes, when exposed to both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Finally, to investigate whether sCD14 or sCD83 could modulate neonatal allergen-induced T-cell differentiation, DC were exposed to birch allergen alone or in the presence of sCD14 or sCD83 and then cocultured with autologous T cells. We demonstrate that sCD14 and sCD83 inhibited the birch allergen-induced Th2 differentiation by suppressing interleukin 13 production. Together, these results suggest that the commensal intestinal flora may be an important stimulus for the developing immune system by inducing the immunoregulatory proteins sCD14 and sCD83, which may be involved in preventing T-cell sensitization to allergens in infants.
TI  - Multiplexed identification of blood-borne bacterial pathogens by use of a novel 16S rRNA gene PCR-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis assay.
AB  - We have developed a novel high-throughput PCR-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis (PCR-LDR-CE) assay for the multiplexed identification of 20 blood-borne pathogens (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Neisseria meningitidis, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacillus anthracis, Yersinia pestis, Francisella tularensis, and Brucella abortus), the last four of which are biothreat agents. The method relies on the amplification of two regions within the bacterial 16S rRNA gene, using universal PCR primers and querying the identity of specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms within the amplified regions in a subsequent LDR. The ligation products vary in color and size and are separated by CE. Each organism generates a specific pattern of ligation products, which can be used to distinguish the pathogens using an automated software program we developed for that purpose. The assay has been verified on 315 clinical isolates and demonstrated a detection sensitivity of 98%. Additionally, 484 seeded blood cultures were tested, with a detection sensitivity of 97.7%. The ability to identify geographically variant strains of the organisms was determined by testing 132 isolates obtained from across the United States. In summary, the PCR-LDR-CE assay can successfully identify, in a multiplexed fashion, a panel of 20 blood-borne pathogens with high sensitivity and specificity.
TI  - Bacterial pathogens associated with secondary peritonitis in Lagos University Teaching Hospital (LUTH).
AB  - Secondary peritonitis is a common and serious form of intra-abdominal infection,  often associated with high morbidity and mortality. The overall patient outcome has not markedly improved in spite of advances in patient management. There is therefore need to study the pattern of bacterial pathogens associated with secondary peritonitis in Lagos University Teaching Hospital (LUTH) and the antibiotic susceptibility pattern as that would help in formulation of empiric antibiotic policy on peritonitis and improve the outcome/prognosis of the patients. A prospective study of 35 patients with suspected peritonitis at LUTH between February, 2002 and June 2003 was done. Peritoneal fluids of these patients were collected intra-operatively under aseptic conditions. The specimens were subjected to aerobic and anaerobic studies. Twenty-seven isolates were identified aerobically with Escherichia coli being the most predominant organism 11 (31.4%) followed by Staphylococcus aureus 6 (17.1%) then Klebsiella spp 4 (11.4%). Anaerobic culture showed Prevotella species as the most predominant 14 (40%) followed by Bacteroides fragilis group 8 (22.9%). Overall, Prevotella species were the most predominant organisms isolated in LUTH patients with secondary peritonitis.
TI  - Activities of four frog skin-derived antimicrobial peptides (temporin-1DRa, temporin-1Va and the melittin-related peptides AR-23 and RV-23) against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The activities of two antimicrobial peptides belonging to the temporin family (temporin-1DRa from Rana draytonii and temporin-1Va from Rana virgatipes) and two peptides with structural similarity to the bee venom peptide melittin (AR-23 from Rana tagoi and RV-23 from R. draytonii) were evaluated against a range of reference strains and clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria. These peptides were selected because they show broad-spectrum growth inhibitory activity against reference strains of several medically important aerobic microorganisms and against clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. All peptides showed relatively high potency (minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) </=25 microM) against the Gram-positive bacilli Propionibacterium acnes and Clostridium tertium and the Gram-positive cocci Peptostreptococcus anaerobius. Activity was lower and more variable against Clostridium septicum, Clostridium perfringens and Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus. Growth of the Gram-negative bacilli Bacteroides fragilis and Fusobacterium spp. was poorly inhibited, but all the peptides were active (MIC</=25 microM) against Prevotella melaninogenica. The clinical utility of the melittin-related peptides is limited by their toxicities, but temporin-1DRa and temporin-1Va have relatively low haemolytic activity against human erythrocytes and so represent candidates for drug development, particularly for topical therapy of infected surface lesions.
TI  - A Review of New Fluoroquinolones : Focus on their Use in Respiratory Tract Infections.
AB  - The new respiratory fluoroquinolones (gatifloxacin, gemifloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, and on the horizon, garenoxacin) offer many improved qualities over older agents such as ciprofloxacin. These include retaining excellent activity against Gram-negative bacilli, with improved Gram-positive activity (including Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus). In addition, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin and garenoxacin all demonstrate increased anaerobic activity (including activity against Bacteroides fragilis). The new fluoroquinolones possess greater bioavailability and longer serum half-lives compared with ciprofloxacin. The new fluoroquinolones allow for once-daily administration, which may improve patient adherence. The high bioavailability allows for rapid step down from intravenous administration to oral therapy, minimizing unnecessary hospitalization, which may decrease costs and improve quality of life of patients. Clinical trials involving the treatment of community-acquired respiratory infections (acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, acute sinusitis, and community-acquired pneumonia) demonstrate high bacterial eradication rates and clinical cure rates. In the treatment of community-acquired respiratory tract infections, the various new fluoroquinolones appear to be comparable to each other, but may be more effective than macrolide or cephalosporin-based regimens. However, additional data are required before it can be emphatically stated that the new fluoroquinolones as a class are responsible for better outcomes than comparators in community-acquired respiratory infections. Gemifloxacin (except for higher rates of hypersensitivity), levofloxacin, and moxifloxacin have relatively mild adverse effects that are more or less comparable to ciprofloxacin. In our opinion, gatifloxacin should not be used, due to glucose alterations which may be serious. Although all new fluoroquinolones react with metal ion-containing drugs (antacids), other drug interactions are relatively mild compared with ciprofloxacin. The new fluoroquinolones gatifloxacin, gemifloxacin, levofloxacin, and moxifloxacin have much to offer in terms of bacterial eradication, including activity against resistant respiratory pathogens such as penicillin-resistant, macrolide-resistant, and multidrug-resistant S. pneumoniae. However, ciprofloxacin-resistant organisms, including ciprofloxacin-resistant S. pneumoniae, are becoming more prevalent, thus prudent use must be exercised when prescribing these valuable agents.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of ertapenem against major intra-abdominal pathogens.
AB  - Treatment of intra-abdominal infections remains a challenge owing to their polymicrobial nature and associated mortality risk. Treatment regimens must provide broad-spectrum coverage, including Gram-positive and Gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria of gastrointestinal origin. Ertapenem is a long-acting 1-beta-methyl parenteral group 1 carbapenem antibiotic that has a broad antibacterial spectrum and once-daily dosing supported by clinical studies. It is active against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including Enterobacteriaceae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and most species of anaerobic bacteria. The aim of this study was to measure the killing effects of ertapenem against a selected group of strains responsible for intra-abdominal infections. Gram-negative isolates comprised the following species: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella ozaenae, Enterobacter cloacae and Proteus mirabilis (extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producers and non-producers). Gram-positive isolates comprised methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), Enterococcus faecalis and anaerobic Bacteroides fragilis. Ertapenem activity was tested by determination of minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBCs). Killing curves were performed in monocultures and co-cultures at selected antibiotic concentrations. Ertapenem showed a rapid and potent bactericidal activity in the first few hours of the kinetic curves against E. coli (6 log(10) colony-forming unit (CFU) reduction in the first 2h), B. fragilis (4 log(10) CFU reduction in 4h), MSSA (3 log(10) CFU reduction in 4-6h), K. ozaenae (ESBL+), K. pneumoniae (ESBL+ and -), E. cloacae (ESBL-) in 1h and P. mirabilis (ESBL+) in the first 2h. The potent bactericidal activity of ertapenem compared with ceftriaxone and piperacillin/tazobactam was well demonstrated in the co-cultures of E. coli-B. fragilis and E. coli-B. fragilis-E. faecalis, whilst ertapenem was shown to be bactericidal at 24h in the mixed culture of S. aureus-P. mirabilis. These results support the potent in vitro bactericidal activity of ertapenem against all multiresistant strains selected in this study and the use of this drug in the treatment of intra-abdominal infections.
TI  - Identification of Bacteroides fragilis by co-agglutination, using a specific monoclonal antibody.
AB  - A monoclonal antibody, mAbC3 (IgG(2b)), specific for the Bacteroides fragilis lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was produced and found to react with a common epitope in most strains within the species. mAbC3 was adsorbed to Staphylococcus aureus Cowan I strain and used in a co-agglutination assay for identification of B. fragilis. Almost 98% of the B. fragilis strains were positive in co-agglutination. Among the 283 non-B. fragilis only two strains showed false positive reaction. These results show that the mAbC3 has a high specificity and can be used for the rapid identification of the B. fragilis species.
TI  - An in vitro study of antimicrobial activity and efficacy of iodine-generating hydrogel dressings.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the antimicrobial activity and efficacy of different formulations of novel bioxygenating hydrogel dressings (which deliver both iodine and oxygen into the wound) against various target organisms by means of an in vitro test system that more effectively mimics the conditions encountered when dressings are in contact with wounds. METHOD: Three bioxygenating hydrogels were tested: Oxyzyme, which releases low levels of iodine into the wound, and Iodozyme 402 and Iodozyme 401, which release higher levels of iodine, with Iodozyme 402 releasing twice the amount of 401. Cellulose filter disks (n = 32) were inoculated with indicator species and placed equidistant from each other as a matrix onto agar test beds. Cut squares of control or test dressings were placed on top of each disk. Kill curves were constructed from determinations of the numbers of survivors (log cfu per disk) over time by removing disk samples at various time points. RESULTS: Significant differences (p < 0.05) were observed between the controls and test samples. The order of sensitivity for Oxyzyme was Fusobacterium nucleatum, Bacteroides fragilis, Propionibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Candida albicans and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The order of efficacy of the three hydrogel dressings (Iodozyme 402, followed by Iodozyme 401 and then Oxyzyme) was the same regardless of the target species. CONCLUSION: The novel hydrogel skin surface wound dressings are broad-spectrum in activity, encompassing antibiotic-resistant organisms, anaerobes and yeasts; their antimicrobial function appears to be rapidly effective.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and its susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents--special references to bacteria isolated between April 2003 and March 2004].
AB  - Tendency of isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery during the period from April 2004 to March 2005 were investigated in a multicenter study in Japan, and the following results were obtained. In this series, 645 strains including 17 strains of Candida spp. were isolated from 226 (79.0%) of 286 patients with surgical infections. Three hundred and seventeen strains were isolated from primary infections, and 345 strains were isolated from postoperative infections. From primary infections, anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria and anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria were predominant, while aerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant from postoperative infections. The isolation rate of aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, such as Enterococcus spp. and Staphylococcus aureus were higher from both types of infections. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Peptostreptococcus spp. was the highest from both types of infections. Among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Citrobacter freundii in this order, and from postoperative infections, P. aeruginosa was the most predominantly isolated, followed by E. coli, E. cloacae, and K. pneumoniae. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of Bacteroides fragilis group was the highest from both primary infections followed by Bilophila wadsworthia. While the isolation rate of B. fragilis group was also the highest from postoperative infections, the following bacteria were Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and B. wadsworthia in this order. In this series, we noticed no vancomycin-resistant Gram-positive cocci, but a few strains of moderately arbekacin-resistant MRSA. Carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa but not multidrug-resistant was seen in 13.3 per cents. Also cefazolin-resistant E. coli probably producing extended spectrum beta-lactamase was seen in 7.0 per cents. We should be carefully followed up the facts that an increasing isolation rates of B. fragilis group and B. wadsworthia which were resistant to both penicillins and cephems.
TI  - [Psoas abscesses. An up-dated perspective].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the characteristics of abscesses of the psoas muscle and assess the differences between pyogenic and tuberculous abscesses. METHODS: Retrospective descriptive study of all patients with psoas abscess in our hospital over the period 1994 to 2004. RESULTS: Fourteen patients were studied (10 males), with a mean age of 42 years. Half of them had had an underlying disease. The most frequent clinical manifestations were abdominal pain (64%), fever (57%), and back pain (43%). All the abscesses were secondary. In 7 patients the origin was gastrointestinal, in 6 osteoarticular, and 1 was related with infection of an aortobifemoral bypass. Computed tomography was the diagnostic imaging method in all patients. Culture of drainage specimens was positive in 92% of patients undergoing this procedure. Causal microorganisms included Mycobacterium tuberculosis (5), Streptococcus intermedius (4), Staphylococcus aureus (3), Escherichia coli (3) and Bacteroides fragilis (2). Tuberculous abscesses originated in spondylitis and the clinical presentation was longer prior to diagnosis. Drainage was performed in 12 patients (8 percutaneous and 4 surgical). Mean duration of antimicrobial therapy was 4 weeks. The infection resolved in all patients. CONCLUSIONS: Psoas abscess commonly had a gastrointestinal and osteoarticular origin. We underscore the high percentage of tuberculous etiology, which had a more insidious clinical and analytical presentation and was usually secondary to spondylitis. Prolonged antimicrobial treatment associated with drainage was effective therapy.
TI  - Antimicrobial activities of clove and thyme extracts.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: It has been postulated that geographical locations of the herbs affect the constituents of their essential oils and thus the degree of their antimicrobial action. This study examine two samples of clove obtained from Sri Lanka and Zanzibar and two samples of thyme from Iran and Oman to determine the antimicrobial potential of their extracted oils. METHOD: The active agents in each plant were extracted by steam distillation and by boiling. The antimicrobial activities of the extracts were determined at neat and by two-fold dilutions in well agar diffusion technique using Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus pyogenes, Corynebacterium species, Salmonella species, Bacteroides fragilis and Candida albicans. RESULTS: All oil extracts possessed antimicrobial activity against all bacteria and yeast tested. Their water extracts exhibited lower antimicrobial activity, though thyme aqueous extract was active only against S. aureus. The lowest concentration of antimicrobial activity (0.1% i.e., 1:1024) was obtained with thyme oil extract using Candida albicans. There was no significant difference in antimicrobial activity between clove obtained from Sri Lanka or Zanzibar or thyme obtained from Iran or Oman. CONCLUSION: Our experiment showed that the country of origin of the herbs has no effect on their antimicrobial activity. However, further work is necessary to ascertain why Candida albicans displayed remarkable degree of sensitivity with the extracts than all the other organisms test.
TI  - DNA microarray for detection of macrolide resistance genes.
AB  - A DNA microarray was developed to detect bacterial genes conferring resistance to macrolides and related antibiotics. A database containing 65 nonredundant genes selected from publicly available DNA sequences was constructed and used to design 100 oligonucleotide probes that could specifically detect and discriminate all 65 genes. Probes were spotted on a glass slide, and the array was reacted with DNA templates extracted from 20 reference strains of eight different bacterial species (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Escherichia coli, and Bacteroides fragilis) known to harbor 29 different macrolide resistance genes. Hybridization results showed that probes reacted with, and only with, the expected DNA templates and allowed discovery of three unexpected genes, including msr(SA) in B. fragilis, an efflux gene that has not yet been described for gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Bacteroides species produce Vibrio harveyi autoinducer 2-related molecules.
AB  - Quorum sensing is a density-dependent gene regulation mechanism that has been described in many bacterial species in the last decades. Bacteria that use quorum sensing as part of their gene regulation circuits produce molecules called autoinducers that accumulate in the environment and activate target genes in a quorum-dependent way. Some specific clues led us to hypothesize that Bacteroides species can produce autoinducers and possess a quorum sensing system. First, Bacteroides are anaerobic bacteria that are frequently involved in polymicrobial infections. These infections often involve Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus, two of the best understood examples of bacteria that employ quorum sensing systems as part of their pathogenesis. Also, studies have detected the presence of a quorum sensing gene involved in the production of autoinducers in Porphyromonas gingivalis, a species closely related to the Bacteroides genus. These and other evidences prompted us to investigate if Bacteroides strains could produce autoinducer molecules that could be detected by a Vibrio harveyi reporter system. In this paper, we show that supernatants of B. fragilis, B. vulgatus and B. distasonis strains are able to stimulate the V. harveyi quorum sensing system 2. Also, we were able to demonstrate that the stimulation detected is due to the production of autoinducer molecules and not the growth of reporter strains after addition of supernatant. Moreover, the phenomenon observed does not seem to represent the degradation of repressors possibly present in the culture medium used. We could also amplify bands from some of the strains tested using primers designed to the luxS gene of Escherichia coli. Altogether, our results show that B. fragilis, B. vulgatus and B. distasonis (but possibly some other species) can produce V. harveyi autoinducer 2-related molecules. However, the role of such molecules in the biology of these organisms remains unknown.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial efficacy of a new chlorhexidine slow-release device.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the antibacterial effect of chlorhexidine and calcium hydroxide slow-release devices on oral bacteria. METHOD AND MATERIALS: The agar diffusion test was used to evaluate the antibacterial effect of the slow-release devices Activ Point (chlorhexidine; Roeko) and Calcium Hydroxide Plus Point (Roeko) on 8 anaerobic and 2 facultative oral bacterial strains, as well as 2 bacterial cultures randomly sampled from necrotic root canals and incubated in anaerobic and aerobic broth for 48 hours. The efficiency of the medicaments against the various strains was evaluated using a nonparametric test (Friedman type) and a second nonparametric test (Wilcoxon's signed rank test). RESULTS: Activ Point produced significantly larger inhibition zones (P < .001) than the calcium hydroxide slow-release device around all tested bacterial strains. CONCLUSION: The chlorhexidine slow-release device (Activ Point) exhibited significant antibacterial activity in the agar diffusion test and merits study as an intracanal medicament.
TI  - Neutropenia induced in outbred mice by a simplified low-dose cyclophosphamide regimen: characterization and applicability to diverse experimental models of infectious diseases.
AB  - BACKGROUND: For its low cost and ease of handling, the mouse remains the preferred experimental animal for preclinical tests. To avoid the interaction of the animal immune system, in vivo antibiotic pharmacodynamic studies often employ cyclophosphamide (CPM) to induce neutropenia. Although high doses (350-450 mg/kg) are still used and their effects on mouse leukocytes have been described, a lower dose (250 mg/kg) is widely preferred today, but the characteristics and applicability of this approach in outbred mice have not been determined. METHODS: Fifteen female ICR mice were injected intraperitoneally with 150 and 100 mg/kg of CPM on days 1 and 4, respectively. Blood samples (approximately 160 microL) were drawn from the retro-orbital sinus of each mouse on days 1, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 11. Leukocytes were counted manually and the number of granulocytes was based on microscopic examination of Wright-stained smears. The impact of neutropenia induced by this method was then determined with a variety of pathogens in three different murine models of human infections: pneumonia (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus), meningoencephalitis (S. pneumoniae), and the thigh model (S. aureus, Escherichia coli, Bacteroides fragilis). RESULTS: The basal count of leukocytes was within the normal range for outbred mice. On day 4, there was an 84% reduction in total white blood cells, and by day 5 the leukopenia reached its nadir (370 +/- 84 cells/mm3). Profound neutropenia (< or =10 neutrophils/mm3) was demonstrated at day 4 and persisted through days 5 and 6. Lymphocytes and monocytes had a 92% and 96% decline between days 1 and 5, respectively. Leukocytes recovered completely by day 11. Mice immunosupressed under this protocol displayed clinical and microbiological patterns of progressive and lethal infectious diseases after inoculation in different organs with diverse human pathogens. CONCLUSION: A CPM total dose of 250 mg/kg is sufficient to induce profound and sustained neutropenia (<10 neutrophils/mm3) at least during 3 days in outbred mice, is simpler than previously described methods, and allows successful induction of infection in a variety of experimental models.
TI  - Analysis of microbial etiology and mortality in patients with brain abscess.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Despite the technological advancements in diagnostic and neurosurgical procedures, brain abscess continues to remain a potentially fatal central nervous system infection. In a prospective study we determined the predisposing factors and the microbiological profile of brain abscess. We also analyzed the mortality in patients with the type of infections identified. METHODS: Over a period of 8 years (1997-2004), aspirated pus from 118 patients with brain abscess was directly inoculated into BACTEC PLUS+ aerobic and BACTEC PLUS+ anaerobic media immediately after collection and subcultured on solid media as appropriate. Predisposing factors, if any, were recorded in all patients. Mortality of patients during hospital stay was correlated with the type of infections identified. RESULTS: Predisposing factors were identified in 94 (79.7%) patients, otogenic infection being the most common (37/118; 31.4%). Microorganisms were demonstrated in 96 (81.4%) patients, by culture in 89 (75.4%) patients and by Gram stain in 7 (5.9%) additional cases. A total of 105 organisms were isolated - 67 (63.8%) aerobes, 32 (30.5%) anaerobes, 5 (4.8%) mycobacteria and 1 (0.9%) fungus. Viridans streptococci (23.8%), Staphylococcus aureus (14.3%), Bacteroides fragilis group/species and Peptostreptococcus species (10.5% each) were the common isolates. Overall mortality was 14.4%; patients with Gram-negative infections had higher mortality than Gram-positive infections (6/20; 30% vs. 6/63; 9.5%; P=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Culture of pus immediately after aspiration in an automated system yields good results. Gram stain coupled with culture can guide the neurosurgeons better to treat their patients more rationally. Patients with Gram-negative infections need special attention in terms of management because of high mortality rate.
TI  - [Rapid diagnosis of donor infection and renal allograft contamination using a polymerase chain reaction technique and rapid shaking culture].
AB  - Post transplant infection is one of the serious complications of the organ recipients. We detected the donor infections and allograft contaminations in a limited period of time by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and rapid shaking culture (RSC). The pre-procurement blood from 86 possible renal donors as well as the preservation solution (PS) and renal pelvic urine (PU) from 158 grafts were examined in order to detect highly virulent organisms such as methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and fungi. The average age of donors was 48.8 years old. The average period between the admission and brain death was 4.9 days, and the average period between the brain death and cardiac arrest was 3.6 days. The inflammatory indices such as body temperature, white blood cell count and C-reactive protein increased to 37.9 +/- 1.1 degree C, 12,600 +/- 6300/microl, and 20.2 +/- 11.6 mg/dl, respectively. Following PCR and RSC, procurement operations of the three possible donors were cancelled because of systemic bacterial infections by MRSA or Bacteroides fragilis. Six out of 158 grafts were discarded due to the diagnoses of MRSA or Candida albicans in PS and/or PU. All the other 148 grafts were transplanted. Following transplant, no single infectious complication transmitted by the graft was noted. We conclude that PCR combined with RSC is very accurate and useful for detecting donor infections and allograft contaminations, which may cause severe complications in the recipients.
TI  - In vitro activities of tigecycline, ertapenem, isepamicin, and other antimicrobial agents against clinically isolated organisms in Taiwan.
AB  - This study evaluated the in vitro activities of tigecycline, ertapenem, isepamicin, and other comparators against 861 bacterial isolates recovered from patients treated in three major teaching hospitals in 2003. MICs to antimicrobial agents were determined by the agar dilution method. High rates of oxacillin resistance (58%) in Staphylococcus aureus (60 isolates), and vancomycin resistance (21%) and quinupristin-dalfopristin non-susceptibility (39%) in Enterococcus faecium (34 isolates) were found. Carbapenems had excellent in vitro activities (>or=98% susceptibility) against the 419 isolates of Enterobacteriaceae, with the MIC(50) and MIC(90) of imipenem, meropenem, and ertapenem being 0.25 and 4 mg/L, 0.03 and 0.12 mg/L, and 0.03 and 0.5 mg/L, respectively. For, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (74 isolates) and Burkholderia cepacia (21 isolates), meropenem (MIC(90), 0.25, 2, and 4 mg/L, respectively) had better in vitro activities than imipenem (MIC(90), 8, 4, and 32 mg/L, respectively) and ertapenem (MIC(90), 0.5, >32, and 32 mg/L, respectively). Isepamicin had a similar activity with amikacin against all Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, B. cepacia, and Acinetobacter baumannii, except for C. freundii isolates in which isepamicin had an eight-fold activity better than amikacin. Tigecycline had excellent in vitro activities against all isolates tested (MIC(90), <or=1 mg/L) including 14 pandrugresistant A. baumannii isolates (MICs, 1-4 mg/L), except for Proteus mirabilis (59 isolates; MIC(90), 8 mg/L), Bacteroides fragilis (60 isolates; MIC(90), 8 mg/L), P. aeruginosa (MIC(90), 16 mg/L), and B. cepacia (21 isolates; MIC(90), 16 mg/L). Tigecycline, carbapenems, and isepamicin exhibited better or comparable in vitro activities against a wide spectrum of commonly encountered bacteria than other comparator antimicrobials and may represent therapeutic options for infections due to multidrug-resistant pathogens.
TI  - Identification and antimicrobial susceptibility of micro-organisms recovered from cutaneous lesions of human American tegumentary leishmaniasis in Minas Gerais, Brazil.
AB  - An evaluation of the microbiota present in cutaneous ulcers from 31 patients with a clinical and parasitological diagnosis of American tegumentary leishmaniasis (ATL) was carried out by the standard filter paper disc technique, including antimicrobial susceptibility of the bacterial isolates. Microbial examination indicated that 21 patients (67.7%) were contaminated with one to four bacteria and some of them also with yeast. A total of 142 micro-organisms were isolated. Staphylococcus aureus was the most frequently recovered bacterium (95.2% of positive patients) and was found to produce type B (70% of the staphylococcal isolates) and type C (50%) enterotoxins as well as toxic shock syndrome toxin (60%). Proteus mirabilis (33.3% of the positive patients), Streptococcus pyogenes (19.0 %), H(2)S-negative Proteus species (19.0%), Klebsiella oxytoca (14.3%), Enterobacter species (9.5%), Peptostreptococcus species (9.5%), Pseudomonas species (4.8%), Prevotella bivia (4.8%), Escherichia coli (4.8%), Streptococcus agalactiae (4.8%), Bacteroides fragilis (4.8%), Candida albicans (9.5%) and Candida tropicalis (4.8%) were also isolated. Surprisingly, Staph. aureus isolates were susceptible to almost all tested drugs, although some of them were resistant to penicillin (69%) and ampicillin + sulbactam (68%). Concerning obligate anaerobes, all the Gram-negative isolates (25% of the total) were resistant to metronidazole. The results of the present study show that microbial secondary contaminants, particularly Staph. aureus, should be considered in the diagnosis and treatment of ATL lesions.
TI  - [Surveillance of susceptibility of clinical isolates to cefmetazole between 2000  and 2003].
AB  - For the post-marketing surveillance of cefmetazole (CMZ, Cefmetazon), MICs of injectable beta-lactam antibacterials including CMZ against clinical isolates from 15 medical institutions all over Japan are measured yearly and the incidence rates of resistance in various species are also evaluated. In the first surveillance from June 2000 to March 2001, 574 isolates of 13 species were tested, 548 isolates of the same 13 species were tested in the second surveillance from April 2001 to March 2002, and 654 isolates of the same 13 species were tested in the third surveillance from April 2002 to March 2003. No remarkable changes in the activity of CMZ were observed in these surveillances spanning three years. The activity of CMZ in this study was comparable to that in the studies conducted before Cefmetazon was launched. This result suggests that CMZ still maintains potent activity. Changes in percent resistance of each species to CMZ (MIC of CMZ > or = 32 microg/ml) were as follows: methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA, 0.0% --> 0.0% --> 0.0%), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA, 72.9% --> 87.2% --> 88.7%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (18.5% --> 31.6% --> 14.3%), coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp. (CNS, 13.3% --> 18.2% --> 21.4%), Escherichia coli (3.6% --> 0.8% --> 2.1%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (3.4% --> 3.8% --> 2.1%), Klebsiella oxytoca (0.0% --> 0.0% --> 0.0%), Proteus mirabilis (2.3% --> 2.1% --> 0.0%), Proteus vulgaris (13.6% --> 6.7% --> 0.0%), Morganella morganii (7.3% --> 0.0% --> 14.0%), Providencia spp. (12.5% --> 0.0% --> 18.2%), Peptostreptococcus spp. (0.0% --> 0.0% --> 0.0%), Bacteroides fragilis (10.3% --> 10.8% --> 17.1%), Bacteroides spp. (78.6% --> 87.5% --> 62.5%). The Change in percent resistance of MRSA, other CNS, and B. flagiris tended to increase. It is necessary to pay much attention to trends observed in these species. Compared to other drugs tested, against MSSA, the activity of CMZ was inferior to that of CEZ, CTM, and FMOX and superior to that SBT/CPZ. Against MRSA, S. epidermidis, and CNS, the tested drugs exhibited little activity. Against Gram-negative bacteria, the activity of CMZ was almost superior to that of CEZ and CTM, and inferior to that of FMOX. Against B. flagiris and other Bacteroides spp., the activity of CMZ was almost superior to that of CEZ and CTM, and comparable to or inferior to that of SBT/CPZ and FMOX.
TI  - In vitro activity of tigecycline against isolates from patients enrolled in phase 3 clinical trials of treatment for complicated skin and skin-structure infections and complicated intra-abdominal infections.
AB  - The in vitro activity of tigecycline was evaluated against 4913 baseline pathogens isolated from 1986 patients enrolled in 4 pivotal phase 3 clinical trials. The trials, which were conducted in 38 countries worldwide, involved patients with complicated skin and skin-structure infections or complicated intra-abdominal infections. Tigecycline was active against the most prevalent pathogens for each infection type, including gram-positive and gram-negative strains of both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria (MICs, < or =2 microg/mL for most pathogens). The spectrum of activity of tigecycline included important pathogens, such as Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant S. aureus), Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Bacteroides fragilis. A few genera, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and members of the tribe Proteeae, were generally less susceptible to tigecycline than were other gram-negative pathogens. The susceptibility of the pathogens to tigecycline was similar for isolates obtained from patients enrolled in the studies of complicated skin and skin-structure infection or of complicated intra-abdominal infection. For most pathogens, the susceptibility to tigecycline was similar across all geographic regions. The excellent expanded broad-spectrum activity of tigecycline demonstrated in vitro against clinical isolates confirmed its potential utility for pathogens associated with complicated skin and skin-structure infections or complicated intra-abdominal infections.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and its susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents--special references to bacteria isolated between April 2003 and March 2004].
AB  - Tendency of isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery during the period from April 2003 to March 2004 were investigated in a multicenter study in Japan, and the following results were obtained. In this series, 455 strains including 14 strains of Candida spp. were isolated from 191(75.2%) of 254 patients with surgical infections. Two hundred and thirty-nine strains were isolated from primary infections, and 216 strains were isolated from postoperative infections. From primary infections, anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria and aerobic Gram-negative bacteria were predominant, while aerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant from postoperative infections. The isolation rate of aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, such as Enterococcus spp. and Staphylococcus aureus were higher from both types of infections. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Peptostreptococcus spp. was the highest from both types of infections. Among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in this order, and from postoperative infections, E. coli was the most predominantly isolated, followed by P. aeruginosa, E. cloacae, and K. pneumoniae. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of Bacteroides fragilis group was the highest from both types of infections. The isolation rate of anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria from primary infections and that of aerobic Gram-positive bacteria from postoperative infections were high in the last several years. In this series, we noticed no vancomycin-resistant Gram-positive cocci, but a few strains of moderately arbekacin-resistant MRSA. Carbapenm-resistant P. aeruginosa was seen in less than 10 per cents. Last year we noticed that there were cefazolin-resistant E. coli producing extended spectrum beta-lactamase, but there was no highly cefazolin-resistant E. coli in this year. In the next series, increase of both anaerobic bacteria and Enterococcus spp. should be carefully followed up.
TI  - Phenatic acids A and B, new potentiators of antifungal miconazole activity produced by Streptomyces sp. K03-0132.
AB  - Two new phenols, designated phenatic acids A and B, were isolated along with known actiphenol, from the culture of Streptomyces sp. K03-0132 by solvent extraction, silica gel column chromatography and HPLC. Their structures were elucidated by spectroscopic analyses including mainly various NMR experiments. They have a common 1-hydroxy 2, 4-dimethyl benzene ring. These compounds potentiate miconazole activity against Candida albicans. Phenatic acid B also showed moderate antimicrobial activity against Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacteroides fragilis and Acholeplasma laidlawii.
TI  - [Pyogenic splenic abscesses. A review of 8 cases].
AB  - PURPOSE: Pyogenic splenic abscess is un uncommon and potentially life-threatening disease. Due to inconspicuous and nonspecific clinical picture, it remains a diagnostic challenge. Medical imaging progresses are helpful for diagnosis and treatment. METHODS: We tried to establish epidemiologic and clinical features and therapeutic possibilities of 8 cases of splenic abscesses occurred between 1993 and 2002. RESULTS: There were 5 male patients and 3 female patients. Aged ranged from 17 to 53 years, with a median of 34 years. One patient was immunocompromised (colonic carcinoma). Common clinical presentations included fever (n=8) and left upper quadrant abdominal pain (n=7). Positive blood cultures were found in only four patients (50%) : Staphylococcus aureus (3) and coagulase negative Staphylococcus (1). Staphylococcus aureus and Bacteroides fragilis were isolated in one abscess pus respectively. The diagnosis was obtained by ultrasonography in all 8 cases. Antibiotics were prescribed in all cases for a mean length of 60 days (30 - 110 days). Splenectomy and percutaneous CT-guided drainage were performed in one case respectively. Evolution was good in all cases. CONCLUSION: Splenic abscesses are increasingly recognized. The combination of clinical features and imaging findings, early diagnosis and treatment can be made.
TI  - Infected neonatal cephalohematomas caused by anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To present the microbiological and clinical features of six children with infected cephalohematomas (IC) caused by anaerobic bacteria. DESIGN: Presentation of a case series. RESULTS: Polymicrobial infection was present in all instances, where the number of isolates varied from two to four. Two patients had anaerobes only and the other four had mixed flora of strict anaerobes and facultatives. There were 16 bacterial isolates (12 anaerobic, 4 aerobic). The anaerobic isolates were Peptostreptococcus spp. (5 isolates), Prevotella spp. (4), Bacteroides fragilis group (2), and Propionibacterium acnes (1). The aerobic isolates were E. coli (2), Staphylococcus aureus (1) and group B streptococci (1). Blood cultures were positive for three patients. The most common predisposing conditions were vacuum extraction and amnionitis (4 instances of each), instrumental delivery (3), electronic fetal monitoring (2), prolonged delivery (1), and premature rupture of membranes (1). All patients underwent drainage, and four also had surgical incision and drainage of the IC. Osteomyelitis developed in one instance and scalp abscess developed in two patients, both of whom had electronic fetal monitoring. All patients eventually recovered from infection after receiving parenteral and subsequent oral antibiotic therapy for a total of 14-38 days. CONCLUSION: This study highlights the polymicrobial nature and potential importance of anaerobic bacteria in IC in newborns.
TI  - Bacteriological study of diabetic foot infections.
AB  - AIMS: The polymicrobial nature of diabetic foot infection has been well documented in the literature. Patients with diabetic foot infection not exposed to antibiotics are not well studied before. The relative frequency of bacterial isolates cultured from community-acquired foot infections that are not exposed to antimicrobial agents for 30 days is studied. In addition, the bacterial comparative in vitro susceptibility to the commonly used antibacterial agents is assessed. METHODS: This is a prospective study in which the infected wounds of 86 consecutive diabetic patients seen in the diabetic foot clinic in Adan Teaching Hospital were cultured when visiting the clinic. The patients did not receive antimicrobial therapy 30 days prior to taking the cultures. The specimen was cultured using aerobic and anaerobic microbiological techniques. Isolates were tested for susceptibility to commonly used antimicrobial therapy. RESULT: Staphylococcus aureus was the most common isolate, being recovered from 38.4% of cases. Other organisms were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (17.5%) and Proteus mirabilis (18%), anaerobic gram-negative organisms (10.5%), mainly Bacteroides fragilis. Imipenem, meropenem, and cefepime were the most effective agents against gram-negative organisms. Vancomycin was the most effective against gram-positive organisms. CONCLUSION: S. aureus and P. aeruginosa were the most common causes of diabetic foot infections. Anaerobic organisms are still a common cause for infection, although the prevalence is less. These wounds may require use of combined antimicrobial therapy for initial management.
TI  - [The study of the pro-nucleating activity of bacteria identified in cholesterol gallstones in model bile systems].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the relationship of bacteria identified in cholesterol gallstones and gallstone formation. METHODS: Observe the bacteria activity in model bile and the influence of bacteria on the cholesterol nucleation time (NT). RESULTS: (1) Model bile were suitable for the growth of E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, clostridium difficile and Clostridium. Propionibacterium acne grew weakly and the growth of Bacteroides fragilis was restrained in model bile. (2) Only pseudomonas aeruginosa and enTerococcus faecalis could ly shorten the cholesterol nucleation time. (3) With pseudomonas aeruginosa or enTerococcus faecalis added in model bile, the formation of cholesterol crystals presented a progressive course of evolution. CONCLUSIONS: Pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus faecalis, not propionibacterium acne, have pro-nucleating ability in model bile.
TI  - Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of linezolid in obese patients with cellulitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Linezolid is an oxazolidinone antimicrobial with excellent oral bioavailability and tissue penetration and is active against multidrug-resistant skin/soft tissue pathogens. OBJECTIVE: To study the pharmacokinetics and antibacterial activity of linezolid against selective skin/soft tissue pathogens in obese patients. METHODS: We obtained multiple serum samples from 7 obese patients (>50% over their calculated ideal body weight) receiving oral linezolid 600 mg every 12 hours for treatment of cellulitis. Following a minimum of 3 doses, serum concentrations of linezolid were measured in each subject prior to (trough) and 1 and 6 hours after a dose. These samples were then tested against clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (linezolid minimum inhibitory concentrations [MICs] 1.0, 2.0, 4.0 microg/mL) and one strain each of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE) (MIC 2.0 microg/mL), Bacteroides fragilis (MIC 2.0 microg/mL), and Peptostreptococcus magnus (MIC 1.0 microg/mL). Serum inhibitory titers (SITs) and bactericidal titers (SBTs) were measured at each time point, and the median activity for these 7 patients was calculated. RESULTS: Mean linezolid serum concentrations were 4.2, 12.3, and 7.2 microg/mL at these respective time points. Median SITs for 12 hours (100% of the dosing interval) were observed against each organism with the exception of the least susceptible strain of MRSA (MIC 4.0 microg/mL); serum inhibitory activity was observed only at the one-hour time point against this isolate. Furthermore, prolonged (> or =6 h) median SBTs were observed against one isolate of MRSA (MIC 1.0 microg/mL) as well as the strain of VRE and P. magnus. CONCLUSIONS: Serum concentrations of oral linezolid in this patient population were diminished compared with those of healthy volunteers, but still provided prolonged serum inhibitory activity against common pathogens associated with skin/soft tissue infections. One treatment concern would be an obese patient receiving oral linezolid who was infected with a less susceptible (MIC > or =4.0 microg/mL) strain of S. aureus. Bactericidal activity was also observed against selective pathogens.
TI  - Drug susceptibility of isolates from severe postoperative intraperitoneal infections causing multiple organ failure.
AB  - PURPOSE: To select the most appropriate antibiotic regimens for life-threatening  postoperative infections, we obtained isolates from patients with severe postoperative infections over a 12-year-period, and examined their drug susceptibility. METHODS: The subjects of this study were 55 patients with multiple organ failure (MOF) caused by postoperative infection. RESULTS: All strains of Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) were susceptible to Vancomycin (VCM) and Teicoplanin (TEIC). Only 0.3% of all the Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were resistant to Imipenem (IPM), but 53.6% of the strains from the severe infections were resistant to IPM. On the other hand, there were few P. aeruginosa strains resistant to Meropenem (MEPM), Ceftazidime (CAZ), Ciprofloxacin (CPFX), and Pazufloxacin (PZFX), even among strains isolated from severe infections. The resistant rate of Bacteroides fragilis to Clindamycin (CLDM) was 35.9%, but there were strains resistant to IPM and Panipenem. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that VCM or TEIC are most appropriate for severe abdominal abscess caused by MRSA, whereas MEPM, CAZ, CPFX, and PZFX are more effective against P. aeruginosa infections. The only antibiotic effective against B. fragilis infections in this study was IPM.
TI  - New antibiotic agents: problems and prospects.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Surgical site infections are the third most common healthcare-associated infection, often leading to prolonged hospital stay and excessive expenditures. Management of these infections has become more challenging due to rising rates of multi-drug-resistant organisms and few new antibiotic options. METHODS: This paper reviews the literature, summarizes the epidemiology of surgical site infections and the threat of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and provides an insight into new treatment options for this condition. RESULTS: Patients with surgical site infections are at greater risk of acquiring healthcare-associated antibiotic-resistant pathogens, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) sp., and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-(ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Multi-drug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bacteroides fragilis are also a growing problem. Several useful drugs have recently become available for the management of serious, gram-positive infections (e.g., daptomycin, linezolid, telithromycin). Tigecycline, the first-in-class glycylcycline, has broad-spectrum in vitro activity, including against MRSA, VRE, resistant enteric gram-negative bacilli (e.g., Acinetobacter sp.), "atypical" pathogens, and anaerobes. Phase 3 clinical trials suggest that tigecycline will be an excellent option for antibiotic monotherapy for complicated skin and soft tissue infections (cSSSI) and intra-abdominal infections. Oritavancin and dalbavacin, two novel glycopeptide antibiotics that are also in late-stage clinical development, appear that they, too, will be useful for cSSSI due to resistant, gram-positive bacteria. CONCLUSIONS: Multi-drug-resistant pathogens are threatening the success of available antibiotic therapy. Many new options are useful for infections due to multi-drug-resistant, gram-positive bacteria. Tigecycline is a promising new agent that provides coverage against a broad spectrum of gram-positive and gram-negative, aerobic, facultative, and anaerobic strains, including resistant isolates, and may make broad-spectrum, single-agent therapy possible.
TI  - Inhibitory effects of various micro-organisms on the growth of Helicobacter pylori.
AB  - AIMS: To examine the in vitro influence of various bacteria species on Helicobacter pylori (Hp) growth. METHODS AND RESULTS: The effects of 29 micro-organisms on 31 Hp strains were determined using two modified 'cross streak' methods. Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Morganella morganii, Serratia marcescens, Bacteroides fragilis, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Clostridium difficile showed the strongest inhibition. The inhibitory effects varied, depending on the bacteria spp. and Hp strains, and were method dependent. The cagA status of Hp strains did not correlate with the extent of inhibition. CONCLUSIONS: Helicobacter pylori is inhibited by a significant number of commensal bacteria species as well as opportunistic human pathogens. The success and progress of Hp infection may be influenced by the bacterial flora present, while the difficulty in cultivating Hp from the oral mucosa and faeces may be the result of antagonistic bacterial interaction. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study provides valuable data on the sensitivity of Hp to a variety of intestinal and oral commensals as well as opportunistic human pathogens. Hp's varying pathogenicity and the specific localization of infection may be the result of these sensitivities. These results can also serve as a basis for further studies to identify the inhibitory substances and make them available for therapeutic use.
TI  - [Rapid diagnosis of neonatal sepsis by 16SrRNA genes PCR amplification and genechip hybridization].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore a method for rapid diagnosis of sepsis in newborn infants.  METHODS: (1) The primers and oligonucleotide probes were designed and synthesized based on the sequences of bacterial 16SrRNA gene. The gene chip was prepared through the probes printed onto special glass slides. The gene chip included 18 special probes: universal probe 1, universal probe 2, Gram positive bacterial probe, Gram negative bacterial probe 1, Gram negative bacterial probe 2, Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococcus (CoNS) 1, CoNS 2, Escherichia coli, Hemophilus influenzae, Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacillus, Meningococcus, Corynebacterium, Propionibacterium; (2) Blood specimens from 285 cases of suspected septicemia were cultured and bacterial 16S rRNA gene was detected separately; DNA isolated from blood specimens and cerebrospinal fluid was amplified by PCR, and PCR products were hybridized with the probes on the gene chips. Hybridization results were scanned and read by laser-scanner. RESULTS: (1) Of the 285 cases, 17 were positive by PCR and the positive rate (5.96%) was significantly higher than that of blood culture (2.81%) (P < 0.01). When blood culture was taken as control, the sensitivity of PCR was 100% and Specificity was 96.75%, the index of accurate diagnosis was 0.968. (2) The 17 specimens which showed positive results by PCR were further hybridized on the gene chip. All were positive by universal probes. Among all of them, 5 were positive by E. coli probe; 4 were positive by Staphylococcus epidermidis; two were positive by Bacillus and Propionibacterium probes, separately; 4 were positive by CoNS. The 8 specimens which showed positive results by both PCR and blood culture, the result of gene chip hybridization coincided with the result of blood culture. CONCLUSION: Detection of the bacterial 16SrRNA genes in clinical specimens by gene chip hybridization technology can diagnose neonatal septicemia rapidly. This method has higher sensitivity and specificity than blood culture or other methods and can provide a rapid way for the etiological diagnosis of neonatal septicemia. Therefore the genechip method may be valuable and practical in early diagnosis of neonatal septicemia.
TI  - Controlled clinical comparison of the BacT/ALERT FN and the standard anaerobic SN blood culture medium.
AB  - To determine the optimal anaerobic companion bottle to pair with the BacT/ALERT (bioMerieux, Durham, N.C.) nonvented aerobic FA (FA) medium for recovery of pathogenic microorganisms from adult patients with bacteremia and fungemia, we compared the BacT/ALERT FN (FN) anaerobic bottle with the standard BacT/ALERT SN (SN) anaerobic bottle. Each bottle, FA, FN, and SN, was filled with 8 to 12 ml of blood. Of 11,498 blood culture sets received in the clinical microbiology laboratories at two university medical centers, 7,945 sets had all three bottles filled adequately and 8,569 had both anaerobic bottles filled adequately. Of 686 clinically important (based on previously published criteria) isolates detected in one or both adequately filled anaerobic bottles, more staphylococci (P < 0.001), including Staphylococcus aureus (P < 0.001); members of the family Enterobacteriaceae (P < 0.001); and all microorganisms combined (P < 0.001) were detected in FN bottles. In contrast, more Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates (P < 0.01) and yeasts (P < 0.001) were detected in SN bottles. More Bacteroides fragilis group bacteremias were detected only in the FN (six) than in the SN (one) anaerobic bottle (P = not significant). Overall, the mean time to detection was shorter with FN (16.8 h) than with SN (18.2 h). This difference in time to detection was greatest for the B. fragilis group: FN, 28 h, versus SN, 60.0 h. Many of the facultative microorganisms recovered in either FN or SN were also found in the companion FA. When microorganisms found in the companion FA bottle were omitted from the analysis, significantly more staphylococci (P < 0.001), including S. aureus (P < 0.001), and Enterobacteriaceae (P < 0.005) still were detected in FN bottles, whereas there were no significant differences for P. aeruginosa and yeasts, which were found as expected in FA bottles. We conclude that the companion anaerobic FN bottle detects more microorganisms than does the anaerobic SN bottle when used in conjunction with the nonvented aerobic FA bottle in the BacT/ALERT blood culture system.
TI  - Surgical infections: a microbiological study.
AB  - Surgical infections are mostly polymicrobial, involving both aerobes and anaerobes. One hundred seventeen cases comprised of abscesses (n=51), secondary peritonitis (n=25), necrotizing fascitis (n=22) and wounds with devitalized tissues (n=19) were studied. The number of microorganisms isolated per lesion was highest in secondary peritonitis (2.32). The aerobe/ anaerobe ratio was 0.81 in secondary peritonitis and 1.8 in necrotizing fascitis. Most secondary peritonitis (80%), necrotizing fascitis (75%) and wounds with devitalized tissues (66.7%) were polymicrobial. Common microorganisms isolated in our study were E. coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacteroides fragilis and Peptostreptococcus spp. The most effective antibiotics for S. aureus were clindamycin (79.1%) and cefuroxime (70.8%). For Gram-negatives (Klebsiella spp., E. coli and Proteus spp.), the most effective antibiotics were cefotaxime, ceftizoxime, amikacin and ciprofloxacin. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was maximally sensitive to amikacin (35.2%) and ciprofloxacin (35.2%). The greatest degree of multidrug resistance to all the drugs was found in P. aeruginosa (52.9%), followed by Klebsiella spp. (33.3%), Proteus spp. (33.3%), E. coli (22.2%), and S. aureus (12.5%). All the anaerobes that we isolated were 100% sensitive to metronidazole and chloramphenicol, followed by clindamycin (95% to 100%). Apart from antibiotic therapy, non-antimicrobial methods, such as hyperbaric oxygen therapy and debridement also play an important role in the treatment of surgical infections.
TI  - Intra-abdominal, retroperitoneal, and visceral abscesses in children.
AB  - This review describes the microbiology, diagnosis, and management of intra-abdominal abscesses (including subphrenic, hepatic, splenic, and retroperitoneal abscesses) in children. They often occur as a complication of local or generalized peritonitis, commonly secondary to appendicitis, necrotizing enterocolitis, pelvic inflammatory disease, and tubo-ovarian infection, surgery or trauma. The original infection generally occurs because of the entry of enteric microorganisms into the peritoneal cavity through a defect in the wall of the intestine or other viscus as a result of obstruction, infarction, or direct trauma. Mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora can be recovered from most abscesses. The predominant aerobic isolates are Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus spp. and the main anaerobic bacteria are Bacteroides fragilis group Peptostreptococcus spp., Fusobacterium spp., and Clostridium spp. The treatment of intraabdominal abscesses includes drainage, surgical correction of pathology, and administration of antimicrobials effective against both aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms.
TI  - In vitro activity of ertapenem: review of recent studies.
AB  - Ertapenem is a long-acting, 1beta-methyl parenteral Group 1 carbapenem antibiotic that has a broad antibacterial spectrum and once-a-day dosing supported by clinical studies. Ertapenem is active against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including Enterobacteriaceae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and most species of anaerobic bacteria. Isolates from a variety of infections (intra-abdominal infections, skin/soft-tissue infections, community-acquired pneumonia, pelvic infections and urinary tract infections) are inhibited by ertapenem. It has restricted activity against nosocomial pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter species, methicillin-resistant staphylococci and enterococci. Ertapenem has potent activity against the majority of anaerobic isolates from intra-abdominal infections, and against most of the aerobes isolated from these infections, with the exceptions of the nosocomial pathogens mentioned above. MIC(90)s for most species of Enterobacteriaceae were <1 mg/L, significantly lower than those of imipenem. MIC(90)s for most Bacteroides fragilis group isolates ranged from 1 to 4 mg/L, and MIC(90)s were species specific for Clostridium, ranging from 0.06 mg/L for Clostridium perfringens to 4 mg/L for Clostridium clostridioforme. Ertapenem was equivalent to or better than piperacillin-tazobactam in activity against most anaerobic species isolated from these infections, and was more potent than piperacillin-tazobactam and ceftriaxone against the most common skin pathogens (e.g. methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus). Ertapenem was highly active against most of the pathogens isolated from patients with community-acquired pneumonia, except for isolates of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (which are infrequent causes of community-acquired infection); these isolates were also resistant to ceftriaxone. Resistance to ertapenem is most commonly attributable to a variety of mechanisms including alterations in penicillin-binding proteins in Gram-positive organisms, and combinations of potent metallo-beta-lactamase enzymes, porin protein defects and efflux pumps in Gram-negative organisms.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and its susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents--special references to bacteria isolated between April 2002 and March 2003].
AB  - Tendency of isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery during the period from April 2002 to March 2003 were investigated in a multicenter study in Japan, and the following results were obtained. In this series, 334 strains were isolated from 131 (75.3%) of 174 patients with surgical infections. One hundred and seventy-one strains were isolated from primary infections, and 163 strains were isolated from post-operative infections. From primary infections, anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant, while aerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant from postoperative infections. Among aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, although the isolation rate of Staphylococcus aureus was the highest, followed by that of Enterococcus faecalis from primary infections, the isolation rate of E. faecalis was the highest from postoperative infections. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Peptostreptococcus spp. was the highest from both types of infections. Among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in this order, and from postoperative infections, E. coli was the most predominantly isolated, followed by P. aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, and Citobacter freundii. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of Bacteroides fragilis group was the highest from both types of infections. The isolation rate of aerobic Gram-negative bacteria from primary infections and that of aerobic Gram-positive bacteria from postoperative infections were high in the last several years. We noticed no vancomycin-resistant Gram-positive cocci nor P. aeruginosa producing metallo-beta-lactamase. But we noticed cefazolin-resistant E. coli probably producing extended spectrum beta-lactamase.
TI  - [Surveillance of susceptibility of clinical isolates to cefmetazole between 2000  and 2002].
AB  - The antibacterial activity of cefmetazole (CMZ) against clinical isolates from 15 medical institutions all over Japan was evaluated yearly for two years from June 2000 to March 2002 and compared with that of other parenteral beta-lactams, cefazolin (CEZ), cefotiam (CTM), sulbactam/cefoperazone (SBT/CPZ), and flomoxef (FMOX). In the first surveillance from June 2000 to March 2001, 575 isolates of 13 species were tested, and 548 isolates of the same 13 species were tested in the second surveillance from April 2001 to March 2002. In these surveillances spanning two years, the MIC90s of CMZ against the bacterial species tested hardly differed. Changes in percent resistance of each species to CMZ (MIC of CMZ > or = 32 micrograms/mL) were as follows: methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA, 0%-->0%), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA, 73%-->87%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (19%-->32%), other coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp. (other CNS, 13%-->18%), Escherichia coli (4%-->1%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (3%-->4%), Klebsiella oxytoca (0%-->0%), Proteus mirabilis (2%-->2%), Proteus vulgaris (14%-->7%), Morganella morganii (7%-->0%), Providencia spp. (17%-->0%), Peptostreptococcus spp. (0%-->0%), Bacteroides fragilis (10%-->11%), and other Bacteroides spp. (79%-->88%). The change in percent resistance of MRSA, S. epidermidis, other CNS, and other Bacteroides spp. tended to increase. In addition, the percent resistance of B. fragilis was 10%. It is necessary to pay much attention to the trends observed in these species. Compared to other drugs tested, against MSSA, the activity of CMZ was inferior to that of CEZ, CTM, and FMOX and superior to that of SBT/CPZ. Against MRSA, S. epidermidis, and CNS, the tested drugs exhibited little activity. Against Gram-negative bacteria, the activity of CMZ was almost superior to that of CEZ and CTM, and inferior to that of FMOX. Against B. fragilis and other Bacteroides spp., the activity of CMZ was almost superior to that of CEZ and CTM, and comparable to or inferior to that of SBT/CPZ and FMOX. No remarkable changes in the activity of CMZ were observed in this study compared with studies conducted before CMZ was launched. This result suggests that CMZ still maintains potent activity.
TI  - Beta-lactamase stability of faropenem.
AB  - Faropenem (FAR) is an orally available member of the penem class unique among carbapenems and other available beta-lactams. This study compared FAR to cephalosporins and imipenem with respect to beta-lactamase (BLA) stability and emergence of resistance to Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. BLA stability was studied using enzyme preparations from sonicated/centrifuged 24-hour cultures of E. coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus vulgaris, Providencia rettgeri, Klebsiella pneumoniae, S. aureus, and Bacteroides fragilis grown in the presence of 20 mg/l ampicillin or cephaloridine to induce penicillinase or cephalosporinase, respectively. Substrate hydrolysis was quantitated spectrophotometrically. Multistep acquisition of resistance was promoted by growing bacteria in broth containing 2-fold dilutions of antibiotic over 10 cycles. Aliquots from test tubes with visible growth provided the inoculum for the next series of dilutions. FAR as well as other cephalosporins tested were highly stable to penicillinase derived from S. aureus and E. coli. However, E. coli- and P. vulgaris-derived cephalosporinase hydrolyzed cephaloridine, cefaclor and cefotiam considerably, whereas FAR was highly stable. FAR was highly stable against hydrolysis by various BLAs prepared from four B. fragilis strains and the rate of FAR hydrolysis by metallo-BLA was 5 times lower than that for imipenem. Additionally, the acquisition of resistant S. aureus strains was less pronounced for FAR compared to other agents tested. MICs rose 8-fold after the 10th sub-MIC exposure, while MICs rose 16-, 31- and 512-fold for cefixime, cefazolin and cefaclor, respectively. E. coli shifts in MICs were moderate for all the agents tested. In conclusion, FAR is characterized by pronounced BLA stability compared to other cephalosporins and imipenem. Furthermore, a lower propensity for resistance development with FAR as compared to cephalosporins was observed.
TI  - [Comparative in vitro activity of ertapenem against aerobic and anaerobic bacteria].
AB  - The in vitro activity of ertapenem (MK-0826), a new carbapenem, was studied against 389 aerobic microorganisms (187 Enterobacteriaceae, 15 Aeromonas spp., 42 Staphylococcus spp., 43 Streptococcus spp., 15 Enterococcus spp., 30 Haemophilus spp., 15 Moraxella catarrhalis, 12 Neisseria gonorrhoeae, 15 Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 15 Acinetobacter spp.) and 54 anaerobic isolates (15 Clostridium spp., 12 Peptostreptococcus spp. and 27 fragilis group Bacteroides recovered from four Spanish hospitals. Ertapenem activity was compared with that of imipenem, piperacillin-tazobactam, cefoxitin, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, cefepime, and norfloxacin. Ertapenem was the most active antibiotic against Enterobacteriaceae (MIC(90) < or =0.5 mg/l) particularly in the case of broad-spectrum, extended-spectrum and chromosomally encoded AmpC betalactamase-producing strains. Ertapenem exhibited less activity, even lower than that of imipenem, against P. aeruginosa, Acinetobacter spp. and enterococci (MIC(90) > or =16 mg/l). Ertapenem was active against methicillin-susceptible S. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci, beta-haemolytic streptococci, and Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC(90) < or =1 mg/l). In the case of Haemophilus spp., M. catarrhalis and N. gonorrhoeae, ertapenem, with a MIC(90) < or =0.06 mg/l resulted the most active antibiotic tested. When considering the anaerobes, ertapenem displayed a broad spectrum of activity, similar to that of imipenem, against Clostridium spp. (MIC(90) 2 mg/l) and was slightly less active against Bacteroides fragilis (MIC(90) 0.5 mg/l). Both carbapenems were the most active among the tested compounds. Due to its activity against almost all pathogens studied, ertapenem appears to be an option for the treatment of mixed bacterial infections.
TI  - [Effect of a polyoxydonium immunoregulator on the biological properties of microorganisms].
AB  - The effect of the synthetic immunomodulator polyoxydonium (PO) on some biological properties of pathogenic bacteria (Shigella flexneri, Salmonella enteritidis), opportunistic bacteria (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacteroides fragilis, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Prevotella melaninogenica, Propionibacterium propionicum, Clostridium difficile) and fungi (Candida albicans), isolated during enteric infections, enteric dysbiosis, pyoinflammatory diseases, was evaluated in a number of in vitro experiments. The study revealed that the recommended therapeutic concentration of PO decreased antilysozyme activity (ALA) and the anticomplement activity in Klebsiella, Shigella, Propionibacterium, Clostridium, bacteroids, fungi of the genus Candida, but increased ALA in nonhemolytic Escherichia. Under the action of PO an increased sensitivity of the microorganisms under study to definite antibiotics of the lincosamide, fluoroquinolon, carbapenem and cephalosporin groups was noted. The data obtained in this study reveal one of the possible mechanisms of the corrective action of PO on the microbiocenosis of the intestine in dysbiosis, enteric infections and pyoinflammatory diseases.
TI  - Bacterial reduction by cell salvage washing and leukocyte depletion filtration.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Blood conservation techniques are being increasingly used because of  the increased cost and lack of availability of allogeneic blood. Cell salvage offers great blood savings opportunities but is thought to be contraindicated in a number of areas (e.g., blood contaminated with bacteria). Several outcome studies have suggested the safety of this technique in trauma and colorectal surgery, but many practitioners are still hesitant to apply cell salvage in the face of frank bacterial contamination. This study was undertaken to assess the efficacy of bacterial removal when cell salvage was combined with leukocyte depletion filtration. METHODS: Expired packed erythrocytes were obtained and inoculated with a fixed amount of a stock bacteria (Escherichia coli American Type Culture Collections [ATCC] 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213, or Bacteroides fragilis ATCC 25285) in amounts ranging from 2,000 to 4,000 colony forming units/ml. The blood was processed via a cell salvage machine. The washed blood was then filtered using a leukocyte reduction filter. The results for blood taken during each step of processing were compared using a repeated-measures design. RESULTS: Fifteen units of blood were contaminated with each of the stock bacteria. From the prewash sample to the postfiltration sample, 99.0%, 99.6%, 100%, and 97.6% of E. coli, S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, and B. fragilis were removed, respectively. DISCUSSION: Significant but not complete removal of contaminating bacteria was seen. An increased level of patient safety may be added to cell salvage by including a leukocyte depletion filter when salvaging blood that might be grossly contaminated with bacteria.
TI  - Activity of faropenem and imipenem for ciprofloxacin-resistant bacteria.
AB  - AIM: To determine whether an association exists between ciprofloxacin and faropenem resistance in bacteria including multiply drug-resistant isolates. METHODS: The MICs were determined for 150 fluoroquinolone-resistant bacteria, plus 20 nalidixic acid-resistant strains of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. RESULTS: Faropenem was very active against Escherichia coli and Streptococcus pneumoniae, but 5/31 Staphylococcus aureus and 2/26 Bacteroides fragilis required > or =16 mg/L for inhibition. Of 30 multiply drug-resistant isolates with a phenotype suggestive of enhanced efflux, only for one strain (a Bacteroides fragilis) was the faropenem MIC higher than that associated with the other isolates of the same species. CONCLUSIONS: Faropenem was in general as active as imipenem. There was no association between resistance to ciprofloxacin and faropenem or imipenem resistance.
TI  - [Psoas abscesses. Genesis, diagnosis, and therapy].
AB  - BACKGROUND: A psoas abscess is a rarely encountered entity with various etiologies and nonspecific clinical presentation, frequently resulting in delayed diagnosis, increased morbidity, and prolonged or recurrent hospitalization. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between January 1996 and January 2002 we treated ten patients (approximately 54.8, 5 males,5 females). These cases were analyzed retrospectively relative to a review of the literature. RESULTS: CT scanning was decisive in the final diagnosis of psoas abscess. Primary psoas abscess occurred in four cases and six patients had secondary abscesses. In all except one case, the psoas abscess was located on the right side. The causes of primary abscesses were retroperitoneal perforated appendicitis, paravertebral injections for lumboischialgia, Pott's disease, and repeated intravenous drug application in the groin. Five patients underwent retroperitoneal open drainage and four patients CT-guided drainage. One patient with retroperitoneal perforated appendicitis was treated by laparotomy. Staphylococcus aureus, Bacteroides fragilis, and Escherichia coli were the most common infective agents. There was no postoperative mortality and no cases of abscess recurred. CONCLUSIONS: CT scan is a diagnostic "gold standard" for psoas abscess. CT-guided drainage is the method of first choice, but is not possible in all cases. Open retroperitoneal drainage is a standard method of treatment. Postoperative antibiotic therapy is obligatory and should be adapted individually.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo activities of novel 2-(thiazol-2-ylthio)-1beta-methylcarbapenems with potent activities against multiresistant gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - SM-197436, SM-232721, and SM-232724 are new 1beta-methylcarbapenems with a unique 4-substituted thiazol-2-ylthio moiety at the C-2 side chain. In agar dilution susceptibility testing these novel carbapenems were active against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) with a MIC(90) of </=4 micro g/ml. Furthermore, SM-232724 showed strong bactericidal activity against MRSA, in contrast to linezolid, which was bacteriostatic up to four times the MIC. SM-232724 showed good therapeutic efficacy comparable to those of vancomycin and linezolid against systemic infections of MRSA in cyclophosphamide-treated mice. The MICs of SM-197436, SM-232721, and SM-232724 for streptococci, including penicillin-intermediate and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae strains, ranged from </=0.063 to 0.5 micro g/ml. These drugs were the most active beta-lactams tested against Enterococcus faecium, and the MIC(90) s for ampicillin-resistant E. faecium ranged between 8 and 16 micro g/ml, which were slightly higher than the value for linezolid. However, time-kill assays revealed the superior bactericidal activity of SM-232724 compared to those of quinupristin-dalfopristin and linezolid against an E. faecium strain with a 4-log reduction in CFU at four times the MIC after 24 h of exposure to antibiotics. In addition, SM-232724 significantly reduced the numbers of bacteria in a murine abscess model with the E. faecium strain: its efficacy was superior to that of linezolid, although the MICs (2 micro g/ml) of these two agents are the same. Among gram-negative bacteria, these three carbapenems were highly active against Haemophilus influenzae (including ampicillin-resistant strains), Moraxella catarrhalis, and Bacteroides fragilis, and showed antibacterial activity equivalent to that of imipenem for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus spp. Thus, these new carbapenems are promising candidates for agents to treat nosocomial bacterial infections by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, especially multiresistant gram-positive cocci, including MRSA and vancomycin-resistant enterococci.
TI  - Antiviral activity of N-benzoylphenylisoserinates of Lactarius sesquiterpenoid alcohols in vitro.
AB  - Cytotoxic, antiviral, antibacterial and antifungal properties of a new, originally synthesised group of compounds: the N-benzoylphenylisoserinates of sesquiterpenoid alcohols - derivatives of taxol and various sesquiterpenes of Lactarius origin were evaluated in vitro. Among 16 compounds tested, 6 decreased HSV-1 titres. Selectivity indices ranged from 13.9 to 31.7. No activity against RNA viruses (parainfluenza 3, Coxsackie B3, vesicular stomatitis virus, and encephalomyocarditis virus), bacteria: Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecium and Bacteroides fragilis and fungal strain of Candida albicans was detected.
TI  - Bacterial translocation after cirrhotic liver resection: a clinical investigation of 181 patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cirrhotic patients are usually associated with a high susceptibility  to infection. Although bacterial translocation from gut mucosa to mesenteric lymph node (MLN) and systemic circulation is a well-known phenomenon after hepatectomy, its role in cirrhotic patients remains unclear. MATERIALS AND METHODS: MLN was harvested for bacterial culture before and after liver resection in 181 cirrhotic patients. The characteristics and postoperative courses of patients with positive and negative bacterial culture for MLN after hepatectomy were compared. Postoperative systemic antibiotics were administered if infectious complications occurred. RESULTS: No bacteria were cultured in MLN before hepatectomy. Bacterial translocation (BT) to MLN after hepatectomy occurred in 36 patients (BT group). After multivariate analysis, intraoperative blood transfusion was the only independent factor that influenced bacterial translocation rates after cirrhotic liver resection. BT group patients also had higher infectious and overall complication rates, with a longer postoperative hospital stay. Among the cultured bacteriae from infected sites in BT group patients with infectious complications, only 2 patients (12.5%) had totally different bacterial species to those cultured from MLNs. CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial translocation more often occurred after liver resection in cirrhotic patients who received intraoperative blood transfusion. Such patients had higher postoperative infectious and overall complication rates. Thus, avoidance of intraoperative blood transfusion is mandatory for cirrhotic liver resection.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and its susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents--special references to bacteria isolated between April 2001 and March 2002].
AB  - Isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery during the period from April 2001 to March 2002 were investigated in a multicenter study in Japan, and the following results were obtained. In this series, four hundred and twenty strains were isolated from 175 (79.2%) of 221 patients with surgical infections. One hundred and eighty-six strains were isolated from primary infections, and 234 strains were isolated from postoperative infections. From primary infections, anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant, while from postoperative infections, aerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant. Among aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, although the isolation rate of Staphylococcus aureus was the highest, followed by that of Enterococcus faecalis from primary infections, the isolation rate of E. faecalis was the highest from postoperative infections. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Peptostreptococcus spp. was the highest from both types of infections. Among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in this order, and from postoperative infections, P. aeruginosa was the most predominantly isolated, followed by Enterobacter spp., E. coli and Klebsiella spp. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of Bacteroides fragilis group was the highest from both types of infections. The isolation rate of aerobic Gram-negative bacteria from primary infections and that of aerobic Gram-positive bacteria from postoperative infections were high in the last several years. We noticed no vancomycin-resistant Gram-positive cocci.
TI  - Growth-inhibiting effects of seco-tanapartholides identified in Artemisia princeps var. orientalis whole plant on human intestinal bacteria.
AB  - AIMS: The present work aimed at isolating antibacterial constituents from the whole plant of Artemisia princeps var. orientalis active towards nine human intestinal bacteria. METHODS AND RESULTS: The growth-inhibiting activities of materials derived from the Artemisia whole plant towards test bacteria were examined using an impregnated paper disc method. The biologically active constituents of the Artemisia whole plant were characterized as the sesquiterpene lactones seco-tanapartholides A and B by spectroscopic analysis. In a test using 1 mg per disc, seco-tanapartholides A and B produced a clear inhibitory effect against Clostridium perfringens, Bacteroides fragilis and Staphylococcus aureus. These compounds did not affect the growth of test lactic acid-producing bacteria (Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Bif. breve, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lact. casei) and Escherichia coli, whereas weak growth inhibition towards Bif. bifidum was observed. At 0.5 mg per disc, seco-tanapartholides A and B exhibited moderate growth inhibition towards Cl. perfringens but weak growth inhibition towards Bact. fragilis and Staph. aureus. CONCLUSIONS: Inhibitory action of seco-tanapartholides A and B towards specific bacteria without any adverse effects on lactic acid-producing bacteria may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of A. princeps var. orientalis whole plant. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: These naturally occurring Artemisia whole plant-derived materials could be useful as a new preventive agent against various diseases caused by harmful intestinal bacteria such as clostridia.
TI  - Antibiotic prophylaxis in the surgical patient.
AB  - Antimicrobial selection for prophylaxis in surgery is based on the site of surgery, likely pathogen involved in addition to the in vitro efficacy, pharmacokinetics and the cost of the drugs used. For example, prophylactic agent in cardiovascular or orthopedic and skin and soft tissue surgery must cover against Staphylococcus aureus as well as the enterobacteriaceae; cephalosporins being adequate. On the other hand, any drug used in cases of urologic surgery must be excreted by the kidney in an active state and should also be active against E. coli, a common uropathogen such as any cephalosporins or penicillin. Drugs like macrolides and tetracyclines accumulate in the prostate and are good for prostate surgery by they are not excreted well by the kidney and therefore useless for urological prophylaxis. It is important to note that even treating minor infections in a neurosurgical patient, we must use an antibiotic that cross blood-brain barrier otherwise meningitis might develop. In cases of gastrointestinal tract, surgery on the colon and appendix requires special coverage against anaerobic bacteria especially Bacteroides fragilis. On the other hand surgery on the stomach, gall-bladder and upper two thirds of small intestine, it is adequate to use drugs to cover aerobic bacteria such as E. coli. Most studies show that a single most effective antibiotic is enough and it is unnecessary to use two or more drug combinations.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents--special references to bacteria isolated between April 2000 and March 2001].
AB  - Tendency of isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery and their antimicrobial susceptibilities during the period from April 2000 to March 2001 were investigated in a multicenter study in Japan, and the following results were obtained. The number of cases investigated as objectives was 234 for one year. A total of 388 strains (136 strains from primary infections and 252 strains from postoperative infections) were isolated from 165 cases (70.5% of total cases). In primary infections, anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant, while from postoperative infections, aerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant. Among aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Enterococcus faecalis was the highest, followed by that of Staphylococcus aureus from postoperative infections. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Peptostreptococcus spp. was the highest from both types of infections. Among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in this order, and from postoperative infections, P. aeruginosa was the most predominantly isolated, followed by Enterobacter spp. and Klebsiella spp. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of Bacteroides fragilis group was the highest from both types of infections. There was no vancomycin-resistant S. aureus nor Enterococcus spp. Among anaerobic bacteria, there were many resistant strains against penicillins and cephems with MICs higher than 100 micrograms/ml, and the same trend was observed among other Bacteroides spp. and Prevotella spp.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents. Special references to bacteria isolated between April 1999 and March 2000].
AB  - The annual multicenter studies on isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery and their antimicrobial susceptibility have been conducted in Japan since July 1982. In this paper, the results obtained in the academic year 1999 (from April 1999 to March 2000) have been summarized. Two hundred seven cases were investigated, and 411 strains were isolated from 169 cases (81.6%). Of those strains, 184 and 227 strains were from primary infections and postoperative infections, respectively. In primary infections, the isolation rates of anaerobes, Streptococcus spp., and Escherichia coli were higher than in postoperative infections, while in postoperative infections, those of Gram-positive aerobes were higher than in primary infections. Staphylococcus aureus were most frequently isolated among Gram-positive aerobes, Peptostreptococcus prevotii among Gram-positive anaerobes, E. coli among Gram-negative aerobes, and Bacteroides fragilis among Gram-negative anaerobes. In primary infections, the percentage of Gram-negative aerobes, which gradually increased by the year 1998, decreased in the year 1999. The percentage of Gram-negative anaerobes increased, while that of Gram-negative bacteria was equivalent to that in the last year. In postoperative infections, the percentage of Gram-negative anaerobes, which continuously increased after the year 1990, decreased, while that of Gram-positive aerobes, which decreased in the last year, increased. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus accounted for 70.7% of S. aureus (41 strains). Either the number of strain or the percentage of MRSA decreased. The susceptibilities of E. coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae decreased against third and forth generation cephems, oxacephems, and monobactams. The susceptibilities of P. aeruginosa to carbapenems tend to decrease after the year 1997. S. aureus showed good susceptibilities to the tested drugs including arbekacin, vancomycin, and teicoplanin.
TI  - Study of fungal and bacterial infections of the diabetic foot.
AB  - Microbiological study for aerobic organisms, anaerobic organisms and fungi from 105 cases of diabetic foot ulcers was carried out to determine the aetiological agents and their antibiograms. Out of 265 microbial isolates obtained, 160 were aerobes, 50 anaerobes and 55 fungal strains. Polymicrobial infection was observed in 73 (69.5%) cases. The most frequently isolated aerobic microorganisms were Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Among the anaerobes Bacteroides melaninogenicus and Bacteroides fragilis were most common. Candida species were preponderant among the fungal isolates. Antimicrobial sensitivity pattern of the isolates is discussed in detail.
TI  - Bacteriology of anal fistulae.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate by bacteriological analysis the possible relationship between the chronicity of perianal fistulae and the presence of probable permanent infection of the fistulae. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study included 27 patients, 21 men and 6 women who had undergone surgery for chronic perianal fistulae type II (according to the Parks classification). A total of 27 samples of their fistulous tracts were sent to the microbiology department for the identification of germs. All samples were taken from the theatre and delivered to the laboratory in the same manner. They were then processed under de same conditions in terms of dilutions, inoculation and culture mediums used for the identification of germs in the tracks of the fistulae. RESULTS: A total of 45 were isolated from 21 different species of microorganisms. Most samples (78.26%) had polymicrobic growth. The predominant species were: Escherichia coli (45.45%), Bacteroides fragilis (16.66%), Staphylococcus aureus (12.12%) and Streptococcus viridans (12.12%). No Mycobacteria were found in any specimen. CONCLUSIONS: Anal fistulae can be colonized by poli- or mononormal intestinal or skin microbacterial flora or a combination of both. This report suggests that neither the type or the number of germs its related to the chronicity of cryptoglandular anal fistulae.
TI  - Microbiology and management of post-surgical wounds infection in children.
AB  - The recent increased recovery of anaerobic bacteria from children has led to greater appreciation of their role in paediatric infections at all body sites, including post-surgical wounds (PSW). In studies that employed adequate method for recovery of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria polymicrobial, aerobic and anaerobes were isolated from over half of the patients with PSW. The wounds studied were those that developed following these surgical procedures: head and neck surgery for malignancies, post-thoracotomy, spinal fusion and gastrostomy tube insertion. Staphylococcus aureus and aerobic gram-negative bacilli were found at all sites. However, a correlation was generally found between the site of the wounds and microbial flora recovered from the wound. Organisms that resided in the mucous membranes close to the surgical site predominated in the wound next to these areas. Enteric Gram-negative rods, Group D enterococcus and Bacteroides fragilis group predominated in wounds relating to the gut flora, while Streptococcus spp., pigmented Prevotella and Porphyromonas spp. and Fusobacterium spp. were most frequently recovered in wounds proximal to the oral area. Management of PSW should include administration of antimicrobials effective against the polymicrobial bacterial flora adjacent to the anatomic site of the wound.
TI  - CD4+ T cells mediate abscess formation in intra-abdominal sepsis by an IL-17-dependent mechanism.
AB  - Abscess formation associated with intra-abdominal sepsis causes severe morbidity  and can be fatal. Previous studies have implicated T cells in the pathogenesis of abscess formation, and we have recently shown that CD4(+) T cells activated in vitro by zwitterionic capsular polysaccharides from abscess-inducing bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus and Bacteroides fragilis initiate this host response when transferred to naive rats. In this study, we show that mice deficient in alphabetaTCR-bearing T cells or CD4(+) T cells fail to develop abscesses following challenge with B. fragilis or abscess-inducing zwitterionic polysaccharides, compared with CD8(-/-) or wild-type animals. Transfer of CD4(+) T cells from wild-type mice to alphabetaTCR(-/-) animals reconstituted this ability. The induction of abscesses required T cell costimulation via the CD28-B7 pathway, and T cell transfer experiments with STAT4(-/-) and STAT6(-/-) mice demonstrated that this host response is dependent on STAT4 signaling. Significantly higher levels of IL-17, a proinflammatory cytokine produced almost exclusively by activated CD4(+) T cells, were associated with abscess formation in Th2-impaired (STAT6(-/-)) mice, while STAT4(-/-) mice had significantly lower levels of this cytokine than control animals. The formation of abscesses was preceded by an increase in the number of activated CD4(+) T cells in the peritoneal cavity 24 h following bacterial challenge. Confocal laser-scanning microscopy analysis revealed that CD4(+) T cells comprise the abscess wall in these animals and produce IL-17 at this site. Administration of a neutralizing Ab specific for IL-17 prevented abscess formation following bacterial challenge in mice. These data delineate the specific T cell response necessary for the development of intra-abdominal abscesses and underscore the role of IL-17 in this disease process.
TI  - Microbiology of polymicrobial abscesses and implications for therapy.
AB  - Abscesses that develop as a result of introduction of the normal flora into a normally sterile body site are often polymicrobial. This review summarizes past studies published by our group on the microbiology of polymicrobial abscesses that occur at various body sites. Staphylococcus aureus and Group A beta-haemolytic streptococci are the most prevalent aerobes in skin and soft tissue abscesses and are isolated at all body sites. In contrast, organisms that colonize the mucous membranes predominated in infections adjacent to these membranes. In this fashion, organisms of the gastrointestinal and cervical flora (enteric Gram-negative bacilli and Bacteroides fragilis group) were found most often in intra-abdominal and buttock and leg lesions. Group A beta-haemolytic streptococci, pigmented Prevotella and Porphyromonas spp., and Fusobacterium spp. were most commonly found in lesions of the mouth, head, neck and fingers. These organisms probably reached these sites from the oral cavity, where they are part of the normal flora. Drainage of the abscess is the treatment of choice. Appropriate management of these mixed aerobic and anaerobic infections may also require the administration of antimicrobials that are effective against both the aerobic and anaerobic components of the infections.
TI  - Zwitterionic polysaccharides stimulate T cells by MHC class II-dependent interactions.
AB  - Polysaccharides of pathogenic extracellular bacteria commonly have negatively charged groups or no charged groups at all. These molecules have been considered classic T cell-independent Ags that do not elicit cell-mediated immune responses in mice. However, bacterial polysaccharides with a zwitterionic charge motif (ZPSs), such as the capsular polysaccharides of many strains of Bacteroides fragilis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pneumoniae type 1 elicit potent CD4(+) T cell responses in vivo and in vitro. The cell-mediated response to ZPS depends on the presence of both positively charged and negatively charged groups on each repeating unit of the polysaccharide. In this study, we define some of the requirements for the presentation of ZPS to CD4(+) T cells. We provide evidence that direct interactions of T cells with APCs are essential for T cell activation by ZPS. Monocytes, dendritic cells, and B cells are all able to serve as APCs for ZPS-mediated T cell activation. APCs lacking MHC class II molecules do not support this activity. Furthermore, mAb to HLA-DR specifically blocks ZPS-mediated T cell activation, while mAbs to other MHC class II and class I molecules do not. Immunoprecipitation of lysates of MHC class II-expressing cells following incubation with ZPS shows binding of ZPS and HLA-DR. Electron microscopy reveals colocalization of ZPS with HLA-DR on the cell surface and in compartments of the endocytic pathway. These results indicate that MHC class II molecules expressing HLA-DR on professional APCs are required for ZPS-induced T cell activation. The implication is that binding of ZPS to HLA-DR may be required for T cell activation.
TI  - Effect of a single percutaneous abscess drainage puncture and imipenem therapy, alone or in combination, in treatment of mixed-infection abscesses in mice.
AB  - The importance of supplementary imipenem therapy after a single percutaneous abscess drainage puncture was studied in a mouse model of established mixed-infection abscesses. Animals were treated for 3 days with daily dosing regimens of 384 to 1,536 mg/kg of body weight that took into account the short half-life of this antibiotic in mice. Imipenem therapy in conjunction with abscess drainage was significantly better than drainage alone in reducing the Escherichia coli and Bacteroides fragilis counts in the mixed infections. Furthermore, the killing of B. fragilis by the combination of imipenem therapy and abscess drainage was significantly better than that by imipenem treatment alone. The maximum reductions in E. coli and B. fragilis counts were 1.1 and 2.2 log(10) CFU/abscess, respectively. In contrast, the in vitro activity of imipenem was significantly better (maximum reduction, > or =6.2 log(10) CFU/ml) against mixed cultures of the same strains even when bacterial numbers similar to those found in the abscesses were used. Comparable in vivo activity was achieved only when treatment was started 30 min before inoculation (reduction for both strains, > or =6.1 log(10) CFU/abscess), but this killing was significantly diminished if the start of treatment was delayed until > or =12 h after inoculation. Imipenem concentrations in abscess tissue reached levels above the MIC for E. coli for >60% of the dosing interval. Possible reasons for the reduced activity of imipenem in vivo are discussed, and we conclude that standard susceptibility tests overestimate the efficacy of this antibiotic against the organisms present in these abscesses.
TI  - Necrotising infections of soft tissues--a clinical profile.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the clinical profile and outcome of patients with necrotising soft-tissue infections. DESIGN: Prospective study. SETTING: Teaching hospital, India. SUBJECTS: 75 patients (54 male and 21 female), mean age 40 years (range 8 months-85 years). INTERVENTIONS: Patients were uniformly managed by initial resuscitation, debridement, topical wound care, systemic antibiotics, and enteral hyperalimentation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Morbidity and mortality. RESULTS: Aetiology of the infections included major and minor trauma, minor skin infections and postoperative infections. 22 patients were diabetic. The extremities were involved in 57 patients, the trunk in 26 and the perineum in 21. 68 presented with local tenderness (91%), 74 with oedema (99%), 54 with erythema (72%), 55 with ulceration (73%), and 54 with a purulent or serous discharge (72%). beta-haemolytic streptococci were isolated from only 10 patients. Staphylococcus aureus was the most common bacteria isolated (n = 30, 46%) followed by Bacteroides fragilis and anaerobic cocci (n = 22, 34% each). Cultures grew fungi in 9 patients. 20 patients died giving a mortality of 27%. Jaundice and serum albumin were the only factors to have a significant influence on mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Necrotising soft tissue infections are potentially fatal. Early recognition and prompt aggressive debridement are the keys to successful management.
TI  - Joint and bone infections due to anaerobic bacteria in children.
AB  - The current review describes the microbiology, diagnosis and management of septic arthritis and osteomyelitis due to anaerobic bacteria in children. Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae type-b, and Group A streptococcus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Kingela kingae, Neisseria meningiditis and Salmonella spp are the predominant aerobic bacteria that cause arthritis in children. Gonococcal arthritis can occur in sexually active adolescents. The predominant aerobes causing osteomyelitis in children are S. aureus, H. influenzae type-b, Gram-negative enteric bacteria, beta-hemolytic streptococci, S. pneumoniae, K. kingae, Bartonella henselae and Borrelia burgdorferi. Anaerobes have rarely been reported as a cause of these infections in children. The main anaerobes in arthritis include anaerobic Gram negative bacilli including Bacteroides fragilis group, Fusobacterium spp., Clostridium spp. and Peptostreptococcus spp. Most of the cases of anaerobic arthritis, in contrast to anaerobic osteomyelitis, involved a single isolate. Most of the cases of anaerobic arthritis are secondary to hematogenous spread. Many patients with osteomyelitis due to anaerobic bacteria have evidence of anaerobic infection elsewhere in the body, which is the source of the organisms involved in osteomyelitis. Treatment of arthritis and osteomyelitis involving anaerobic bacteria includes symptomatic therapy, immobilization in some cases, adequate drainage of purulent material and antibiotic therapy effective to these organisms.
TI  - Cefditoren, a new aminothiazolyl cephalosporin.
AB  - Cefditoren pivoxil, an oral third-generation cephalosporin, was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in September 2001. It has been used in Japan for several years. The greatest therapeutic potential of cefditoren appears to be its activity against gram-positive and gram-negative organisms causing respiratory tract infections and skin and skin-structure infections, such as Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. Cefditoren is also effective against methicillin-susceptible strains of Staphylococcus aureus. Nevertheless, cefditoren has no activity against atypical pathogens, including Chlamydia pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Legionella sp. Moreover, cefditoren does not inhibit Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Bacteroides fragilis. In virtually all studies, cefditoren has compared favorably against other orally administered antibiotics used against the most commonly isolated respiratory tract pathogens. Its side effect profile includes diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, headache, and dyspepsia. Cefditoren is indicated for treatment of mild-to-moderate acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, pharyngitis-tonsillitis, and uncomplicated skin and skin-structure infections caused by susceptible strains of organisms in adults and adolescents (> or = 12 yrs of age). Based on its reported antimicrobial activity, cefditoren has potential for empiric management of most commonly encountered respiratory tract infections. Additional studies will further define its role in clinical practice.
TI  - Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-deficient murine macrophage cell line as an in vitro  assay system to show TLR4-independent signaling of Bacteroides fragilis lipopolysaccharide.
AB  - Bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) activate cells of innate immunity, such as macrophages, by stimulating signaling through toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). We and others have hypothesized that LPS derived from different bacterial species may function through TLR4-independent mechanisms. To test this hypothesis, we have generated using a nonviral transformation procedure a bone marrow-derived macrophage cell line called 10ScNCr/23 from mouse strain C57BL/10ScNCr. This mouse strain has a deletion of the TLR4 locus, causing the mouse strain to be nonresponsive to stimulation by LPS from Escherichia coli while responding normally to other bacterial substrates, such as lipoteichoic acid (LTA) from Staphylococcus aureus, which signal TLR4 independently. Stimulation with LTA induces five- and sixfold increases in 10ScNCr/23 cell line tumor necrosis factor alpha and macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2) secretion, but no increases in either cytokine were found when cells were stimulated with E. coli LPS. Bacteroides fragilis-derived LPS, however, can effectively stimulate MIP-2 expression in the absence of functional TLR4 in the 10ScNCr/23 cell line. This gives rise to the notion that LPS from some bacterial species will utilize alternative receptors to stimulate the innate immune response.
TI  - Primary psoas abscess. Report of three cases.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Primary psoas abscesses are a rare clinical entity with subtle and non specific symptoms, most commonly seen in patients predisposed to infections. Early diagnosis and appropriate management are therefore challenging aspects for physicians. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We present three patients with primary pyogenic psoas abscess, treated at the Heraklion University Hospital, during a 5-year period. The two male and one female patient, aged 36-51 years were admitted with fever, abdominal pain and a palpable tender mass. RESULTS: The classical sign of limping was absent in all cases. Positive psoas symptoms were detected in only two patients. CT scan accurately confirmed the diagnosis in all cases. The patients were successfully treated with antibiotics and prolonged surgical drainage. Staphylococcus aureus was the causative microorganism in the first two and Bacteroides fragilis in the third patient. This is the first reported case resulting from this specific bacteria. None of our patients had any predisposing risk factor. CONCLUSIONS: A high index of suspicion is mandatory to enable early recognition of this rare clinical disease. CT scan is the standard diagnostic tool to confirm diagnosis. Prolonged drainage and appropriate antibiotics are essential for the successful treatment of primary psoas abscesses.
TI  - Evaluation of N-acetylchitooligosaccharides as the main carbon sources for the growth of intestinal bacteria.
AB  - N-Acetylchitooligosaccharides ((GlcNAc)(n)) with different degrees of polymerization (n=1-6) were prepared as the main carbon sources in media for evaluating the growth of nine intestinal bacteria. A chitohydrolysate was prepared by hydrolyzing shrimp-shell chitin using HCl. After purification, the purity of each (GlcNAc)(1-6) was >86%. The growth of intestinal bacteria was carried out in a basal medium (BM) containing 0.2% (w/v) of each sugar or glucose as the main carbon source and was evaluated using maximum cell densities and specific growth rates. Bacteroides fragilis and Clostridium perfringens could respectively utilize GlcNAc and (GlcNAc)(2) more efficiently for growth than glucose. Bifidobacterium adolescentis and Eubacterium limosum could use (GlcNAc)(1-6) slightly as their main carbon source. Escherichia coli, Lactococcus lactis and Proteus vulgaris could utilize glucose more efficiently than (GlcNac)(1-6). GlcNAc was used more readily than (GlcNAc)(2-6) by Staphylococcus aureus, exhibiting almost the same specific growth rates. In BM, Streptococcus faecalis grew well even without adding each of the sugars tested.
TI  - Pharmacodynamic properties of HMR 3004, a novel ketolide, on respiratory pathogens, enterococci and Bacteroides fragilis demonstrated by studies of time kill kinetics and postantibiotic effect.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The pharmacodynamic properties of the novel ketolide (a new class of macrolide) antibiotic, HMR 3004, were investigated by studying time-kill kinetics and postantibiotic effect. METHODS: The time-kill kinetics were studied at two inocula against three strains each of Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium and Bacteroides fragilis. The postantibiotic effects of HMR 3004 were also investigated on these organisms at concentrations equivalent to 1, 4 and 10 x MIC. RESULTS: The time kill-kinetic data demonstrated that HMR 3004 is inoculum dependent and predominantly bacteriostatic being only slowly bactericidal at higher concentrations. HMR 3004 exhibited a significant postantibiotic effect with all strains studied, ranging from 1.9--6.2 h at 10 x MIC. CONCLUSIONS: The bacteriostatic activity and significant postantibiotic effect demonstrated by HMR 3004 are similar to those previously obtained with other macrolides.
TI  - In vitro activity of moxifloxacin against local bacterial isolates.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The emergence of resistance to common antimicrobials in bacteria has been increasingly reported in various countries. Empirical antimicrobial therapy of various infections would therefore need to be reviewed. The introduction of new fluoroquinolones has created an interest in the use of these as possible agents in the empirical treatment of respiratory tract infections. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the new fluoroquinolone, moxifloxacin, against 400 clinical bacterial isolates was determined by the E-test method. RESULTS: All Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates (penicillin sensitive or resistant) were susceptible to moxifloxacin. Similarly, both beta-lactamase and non beta-lactamase producing Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis isolates were susceptible to moxifloxacin. As for Enterobacteriaceae, 88.6% of the isolates tested were susceptible to moxifloxacin with MIC < 8 mg/L, but resistance was noted for some of Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella spp. and Escherichia coli. Enterococci and Acinetobacter baumannii were resistant to moxifloxacin, whilst the anaerobes tested were susceptible to moxifloxacin. CONCLUSION: Moxifloxacin has good in vitro activity against common organisms associated with community and nosocomial infections, with the exception of enterococci, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and ciprofloxacin-resistant gram-negative bacteria. There was good anti-anaerobic activity against Bacteroides fragilis and Clostridum spp. Results of this study are consistent with other similar published in vitro studies.
TI  - A critical review of the fluoroquinolones: focus on respiratory infections.
AB  - The new fluoroquinolones (clinafloxacin, gatifloxacin, gemifloxacin, grepafloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, sitafloxacin, sparfloxacin and trovafloxacin) offer excellent activity against Gram-negative bacilli and improved Gram-positive activity (e.g. against Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus) over ciprofloxacin. Ciprofloxacin still maintains the best in vitro activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Clinafloxacin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, sitafloxacin, sparfloxacin and trovafloxacin display improved activity against anaerobes (e.g. Bacteroides fragilis) versus ciprofloxacin. All of the new fluoroquinolones display excellent bioavailability and have longer serum half-lives than ciprofloxacin allowing for once daily dose administration. Clinical trials comparing the new fluoroquinolones to each other or to standard therapy have demonstrated good efficacy in a variety of community-acquired respiratory infections (e.g. pneumonia, acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis and acute sinusitis). Limited data suggest that the new fluoroquinolones as a class may lead to better outcomes in community-acquired pneumonia and acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis versus comparators. Several of these agents have either been withdrawn from the market, had their use severely restricted because of adverse effects (clinafloxacin because of phototoxicity and hypoglycaemia; grepafloxacin because of prolongation of the QTc and resultant torsades de pointes; sparfloxacin because of phototoxicity; and trovafloxacin because of hepatotoxicity), or were discontinued during developmental phases. The remaining fluoroquinolones such as gatifloxacin, gemifloxacin, levofloxacin and moxifloxacin have adverse effect profiles similar to ciprofloxacin. Extensive post-marketing safety surveillance data (as are available with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin) are required for all new fluoroquinolones before safety can be definitively established. Drug interactions are limited; however, all fluoroquinolones interact with metal ion containing drugs (eg. antacids). The new fluoroquinolones (gatifloxacin, gemifloxacin, levofloxacin and moxifloxacin) offer several advantages over ciprofloxacin and are emerging as important therapeutic agents in the treatment of community-acquired respiratory infections. Their broad spectrum of activity which includes respiratory pathogens such as penicillin and macrolide resistant S. pneumoniae, favourable pharmacokinetic parameters, good bacteriological and clinical efficacy will lead to growing use of these agents in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia, acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis and acute sinusitis. These agents may result in cost savings especially in situations where, because of their potent broad-spectrum activity and excellent bioavailability, they may be used orally in place of intravenous antibacterials. Prudent use of the new fluoroquinolones will be required to minimise the development of resistance to these agents.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents. Special references to bacteria isolated between April 1998 and March 1999].
AB  - The annual multicenter studies on isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery and their antimicrobial susceptibility have been conducted in Japan since July 1982. This paper describes the results obtained in fiscal 1998 (from April 1998 to March 1999). The number of cases investigated as objectives was 225 for one year. A total of 429 strains (121 strains from primary infections and 308 strains from postoperative infections) were isolated from 183 cases (81.3% of total cases). In primary infections, the isolation rates of anaerobes and Escherichia coli were higher than in postoperative infections, while in postoperative infections, those of Gram-positive aerobes and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were higher than in primary infections. On the whole, among Gram-positive aerobes, the isolation rate of Enterococcus faecalis was the highest, followed by Staphylococcus aureus with high frequency in isolation from postoperative infections. Among Gram-positive anaerobes, Peptostreptococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp. were predominantly isolated. Among Gram-negative aerobes, E. coli, P. aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae were frequently isolated. Among Gram-negative anaerobes, Bacteroides fragilis group was the majority of isolates. In primary infections, the percentage of Gram-negative aerobes has gradually increased since fiscal 1995 or 1996 with these years as the turning point, while those of Gram-positive and Gram-negative anaerobes have gradually declined. In postoperative infections, the percentage of Gram-negative anaerobes has increased continuously since the mid-1980s. The percentage of MRSA among S. aureus rose to 89.7%, which was the highest level since the beginning of this study. The susceptibilities of B. fragilis, which did not show apparent changes, were recognized to have decreased against cephems in fiscal 1998. Among other bacteria in B. fragilis group, development of resistance to cephems has continued on a long-term basis since the mid-1980s. E. coli and K. pneuminiae have obviously not changed in susceptibilities, however, the susceptibilities of isolated strains in fiscal 1998 against high-generation cephems, oxacephems and monobactams have declined. We found neither vancomycin-resistant nor teicoplanin-resistant strains of S. aureus and Enterococcus spp.
TI  - Production of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines of human placental trophoblasts in response to pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We studied the production of cytokines in purified cultures of human term trophoblasts in the presence of pathogenic strains of Escherichia coli, Bacteroides fragilis, Mycoplasma hominis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus agalactiae, which have been identified in intrauterine infections. METHODS: Human villous trophoblasts were isolated from term placentas after cesarean section and purified by several steps. After 6, 12, and 24 hours of incubation with the different heat-inactivated bacteria, interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), and interleukin-10 (IL-10) as well as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) were measured from supernatants by commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Expression of cytokine mRNAs was determined by semiquantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS: In nonstimulated cultures, low (IL-1beta and TNF-alpha) and high (IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10) basal secretion of cytokines was detectable. The pathogenic microorganisms induced a dose- and time-dependent release of IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10, whereas TNF-alpha secretion was not elevated. E coli was the most potent inducer followed by B fragilis, S agalactiae, S aureus, and M hominis. Transcripts encoding IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, or IL-10 were elevated in the RT-PCR reactions, suggesting that transcriptional mechanisms contribute to elevated cytokine expression. CONCLUSION: Pathogenic microorganisms stimulated mRNA expression and polypeptide release of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines from placental trophoblasts. Induction of both inflammation-promoting and inflammation-inhibiting cytokines by bacterial products could play a role in modulating the inflammatory response associated with chorioamnionitis.
TI  - 3-(Arylacetylamino)-N-methylbenzamides: a novel class of selective anti-Helicobacter pylori agents.
AB  - After chemical modification preceded by the random screening of our chemical library, a novel class of selective anti-Helicobacter pylori agents was generated. Consequently, the 3-(arylacetylamino)-N-methylbenzamides, which were quite easy to prepare, showed potent inhibitory activity against Helicobacter pylori but exhibited no inhibitory activity against other sorts of bacteria and fungi, e.g., Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacteroides fragilis, and Candida albicans. These compounds showed potent anti-H. pylori activity under acidic conditions, whereas amoxicillin and clarithromycin decreased activity. The 3-(3-arylpropionylamino)-N-methylbenzamides, 3-(aryloxyacetylamino)-N-methylbenzamides, and (3-methylcarbamoylphenyl)carbamic acid 1-arylmethyl esters also exhibited potent anti-H. pylori activity. Finally, we selected 7n (BAS-118) as a candidate compound for further evaluation.
TI  - Bacteriology of diabetic foot.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To study the relative frequency of bacterial isolates cultured from diabetic foot infections and assess their comparative in vitro susceptibility to the commonly used antibacterial agents. METHODS: This is a retrospective study with a review of the bacteriology results of specimens taken from 111 consecutive patients with diabetic foot infections at King Abdulaziz University Hospital, Jeddah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, during the period January 1997 to June 1999. The specimens were cultured using optimal aerobic and anaerobic microbiologic techniques. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing to different agents, was carried out using the disc diffusion method. RESULTS: Staphylococcus aureus was the commonest isolate being recovered from 28% of cases, including methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus in 9 of 30 (30%) patient wounds. The other organisms isolated were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (22%) and Proteus mirabilis (18%), anaerobic gram-negative organisms (11%) mainly Bacteroides fragilis. The antimicrobial susceptibility testing, showed that vancomycin was the most effective against gram-positive and and imipenem was the most effective against gram-negative organisms. CONCLUSION: Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis and Bacteroides fragilis were the most common causes of diabetic foot infections. These wounds require use of combined antimicrobial therapy for initial patient management prior to susceptibility results.
TI  - Group G beta-hemolytic streptococcal bacteremia characterized by 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing.
AB  - Little is known about the relative importance of the four species of Lancefield group G beta-hemolytic streptococci in causing bacteremia and the factors that determine the outcome for patients with group G beta-hemolytic streptococcal bacteremia. From 1997 to 2000, 75 group G beta-hemolytic streptococcal strains were isolated from the blood cultures of 66 patients. Sequencing of the 16S rRNA genes of the group G beta-hemolytic streptococci showed that all 75 isolates were Streptococcus dysgalactiae subspecies equisimilis. The API system (20 STREP) and Vitek system (GPI) successfully identified 65 (98.5%) and 62 (93.9%) isolates, respectively, as S. dysgalactiae subspecies equisimilis with >95% confidence, whereas the ATB Expression system (ID32 STREP) only successfully identified 49 isolates (74.2%) as S. dysgalactiae subspecies equisimilis with >95% confidence. The median age of the patients was 76 years (range, 33 to 99 years). Fifty-six patients (85%) were over 60 years old. All patients had underlying diseases. No source of the bacteremia was identified (primary bacteremia) in 34 patients (52%), whereas 17 (26%) had cellulitis and 8 (12%) had bed sore or wound infections. Fifty-eight patients (88%) had community-acquired group G streptococcal bacteremia. Sixty-two patients (94%) had group G Streptococcus recovered in one blood culture, whereas 4 patients (6%) had it recovered in multiple blood cultures. Fifty-nine patients (89%) had group G Streptococcus as the only bacterium recovered in their blood cultures, whereas in 7 patients other bacteria were recovered concomitantly with the group G Streptococcus in the blood cultures (Staphylococcus aureus in 3, Clostridium perfringens in 2, Citrobacter freundii in 1, and Bacteroides fragilis in 1). Overall, 10 patients (15%) died. Male sex, diagnosis other than cellulitis, hospital-acquired bacteremia, and multiple positive blood cultures were associated with mortality [P < 0.005 (relative risk [RR] = 7.6), P < 0.05 (RR = 3.7), P < 0.005 (RR = 5.6), and P < 0.05 (RR = 5.6), respectively]. Unlike group C beta-hemolytic streptococcal bacteremia, group G beta-hemolytic streptococcal bacteremia is not a zoonotic infection in Hong Kong.
TI  - Structural rationale for the modulation of abscess formation by Staphylococcus aureus capsular polysaccharides.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus is a medically important bacterial pathogen that is a common cause of superficial and deep-seated abscesses in humans. Most S. aureus isolates produce either a serotype 5 or 8 capsular polysaccharide (CP) that has been shown to enhance bacterial virulence. We investigated the role of S. aureus CPs in modulating abscess formation in an experimental animal model of intraabdominal infection. Structural studies of CP8 revealed that it has a zwitterionic charge motif conferred by the negatively charged carboxyl group of N-acetylmannosaminuronic acid and free amino groups available on partially N-acetylated fucosamine residues. We report that purified CP5 and CP8 facilitated intraabdominal abscess formation in animals when given i.p. with a sterile cecal contents adjuvant. Chemical modifications that neutralized the positively or negatively charged groups on CP8 abrogated its ability to provoke abscesses. Rats prophylactically treated with CP8 s.c. were protected against abscess formation induced by homologous or heterologous zwitterionic polysaccharides. Likewise, treatment with CP8 protected against challenge with viable S. aureus strains PS80 (a capsule type 8 strain) or COL (a methicillin-resistant capsule type 5 strain). Purified CP8 was a potent activator of rat and human CD4(+) T cells in vitro. When transferred to naive rats, these activated T cells modulated the development of intraabdominal abscess formation. These results provide a structure/function rationale for abscess formation by S. aureus and expand the sphere of encapsulated organisms that interact directly with T cells to regulate this host response to bacterial infection.
TI  - The yield of blood cultures in a department of emergency medicine.
AB  - This study sought to determine the yield of blood cultures drawn in the department of emergency medicine. The results of 730 blood cultures taken from 718 patients were retrospectively analysed. The total percentage of positive cultures was 9.7%. Only 3.4% of the blood cultures were classified as true bacteraemia and the rest as contaminants. The commonest type of isolate was coagulase-negative staphylococci (49%), which were considered contaminants in all cases. Other contaminants represented 13.2% of all the positive blood cultures. The following bacteria comprised the group of true bacteraemia: Escherichia coli (12.6%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (9.8%), viridans streptococci (7%), Staphylococcus aureus (2.8%), Bacteroides fragilis (2.8%), Moraxella species (1.4%) and Flavobacterium species (1.4%). Blood cultures were positive in 3.6% of patients with pneumonia and in 10% of patients with urinary tract infections. In patients with fever of unclear source blood cultures were positive in 3.1% of children between 0-36 months of age and in 1.1% of patients older than 16 years. As a whole, patients with positive blood cultures were clinically sicker, a higher percentage of them required admission to the hospital and had higher temperatures or rapidly fatal disease, compared with the group of patients with negative blood cultures. In order to improve the yield of blood cultures in febrile patients, first, better a priori identification of those subjects at high risk for bacteraemia will reduce the number of unnecessary blood cultures and second, sterile venipuncture techniques should be improved in order to reduce the number of contaminants.
TI  - [Cellulitis and necrotizing fasciitis: microbiology and pathogenesis].
AB  - Streptococcus pyogenes is a common cause of necrotizing cutaneous infections in otherwise healthy children and adults. Several surface components are involved in the processes of adherence and invasiveness, such as protein M and capsulae. Streptolysin O and other bacterial products, such as pyrogenic exotoxins, are involved in tissue injury and necrosis. Toxins A and C act as superantigens and are expressed by strains associated with the toxic shock syndrome. Staphylococcus aureus, alone or in association with streptococci, is also commonly isolated form all body sites, but bacteremia is inconstant. Capsule, protein A, and the staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome toxin are the major pathogenicity factors. In infections of the face and the neck, the predominant anaerobes recovered in association with group A streptococci are Peptostreptococcus magnus, oral Prevotella, Porphyromonas spp., and Fusobacterium spp. Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium, enterobacteria, and enterococci are recovered in infections located next to the perineal area. Penicillin is the drug of choice for the treatment of streptococcal infections. However benzylpenicillin may be not sufficient for severe infections and large inoculum, therefore the administration of clindamycin or another inhibitor of protein synthesis is recommended. Since the infection may be polymicrobial, the initial therapy should include treatment for staphylococci and anaerobes. In some cases broad- spectrum antibiotics also, effective on enterobacteria, are needed. The efficacy of appropriate parenteral antibiotics, however, depends on the prompt and aggressive exploration and debridement of suspected deep-seated infection, and supportive care of shock and multiple organ failure.
TI  - Comparative in vitro pharmacodynamics of imipenem and meropenem against ATCC strains of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacteroides fragilis.
AB  - We evaluated the pharmacodynamics of imipenem and meropenem, utilizing time-kill  studies over a concentration/MIC (C/MIC) range of 0.0625-1024 for E. coli ATCC 35218 (EC) and S. aureus ATCC 29213 (SA) and from 0.125-512 for B. fragilis ATCC 25285 (BF). Area under the time-kill curves were converted to percent response (%R). AUCs were calculated from drug concentrations corrected for degradation and %R vs. C/MIC and AUC/MIC were fit to a sigmoidal Emax model. Emax was similar for both agents for all organisms. Meropenem was 4x more potent than imipenem against EC based on the MIC and required 7 and 13.5-fold lower AUCs to achieve E50 and E90, (50% and 90% of the maximal response, respectively) respectively, whereas imipenem was 8x more potent than meropenem against SA based on the MIC and required 8 and 13-fold lower AUCs to achieve E50 and E90, respectively. The C/MIC and AUC/MIC to achieve E50 and E90 with imipenem were 2- and fourfold higher, respectively than meropenem against EC. There was less than a twofold difference in C/MICs and AUC/MIC between imipenem and meropenem for both E50 and E90 against SA. Against BF, concentrations and AUCs at E50 were similar for both agents; however, imipenem required 4 to 6-fold higher concentrations and AUC to achieve E90. Although there are differences in the potency of these agents as assessed by the MIC or AUC vs. response, when normalized by the MIC and corrected for drug degradation, these agents displayed similar pharmacodynamic parameter-response relationships.
TI  - [Resistance and new antibiotic strategies. New antistaphylococcal antibiotics].
AB  - INJECTABLE SPECTROGRAMIN: Combination regimens using quinupristin/dafopristin with either gentamicin or vancomycin have powerful bactericidal activities (even against quinupristin-resistant strains) against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in a model of experimental endocarditis in the rabbit. In clinical trials, quinupristin/dalfopristin is becoming a therapeutic alternative to consider after failure of conventional antistaphylococcal treatments. NEW GENERATION CEPHALOSPORINS: These new cephalosporins, particularly C-3 pyridinium-thiomethyl-cephalosporins, new (3-dithiocarbamoyl) cephalosporins, and a series of new compounds with high affinity for MRSA PLP2a, are particularly active against MRSA and are unaffected by beta-lactamases. A NEW CARBAPENEM: This new antibiotic has a wide bactericidal effect against Gram-positive organisms and is active against MRSA as well as penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae. NEW FLUOROQUINOLONE DERIVATIVES: In vitro, these new derivatives have been found to be active against MRSA, pneumococci non-sensitive to ciprofloxacin, and Bacteroides fragilis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Chlamydia pneumoniae.
TI  - Bacterial pathogens induce abscess formation by CD4(+) T-cell activation via the  CD28-B7-2 costimulatory pathway.
AB  - Abscesses are a classic host response to infection by many pathogenic bacteria. The immunopathogenesis of this tissue response to infection has not been fully elucidated. Previous studies have suggested that T cells are involved in the pathologic process, but the role of these cells remains unclear. To delineate the mechanism by which T cells mediate abscess formation associated with intra-abdominal sepsis, the role of T-cell activation and the contribution of antigen-presenting cells via CD28-B7 costimulation were investigated. T cells activated in vitro by zwitterionic bacterial polysaccharides (Zps) known to induce abscess formation required CD28-B7 costimulation and, when adoptively transferred to the peritoneal cavity of naive rats, promoted abscess formation. Blockade of T-cell activation via the CD28-B7 pathway in animals with CTLA4Ig prevented abscess formation following challenge with different bacterial pathogens, including Staphylococcus aureus, Bacteroides fragilis, and a combination of Enterococcus faecium and Bacteroides distasonis. In contrast, these animals had an increased abscess rate following in vivo T-cell activation via CD28 signaling. Abscess formation in vivo and T-cell activation in vitro required costimulation by B7-2 but not B7-1. These results demonstrate that abscess formation by pathogenic bacteria is under the control of a common effector mechanism that requires T-cell activation via the CD28-B7-2 pathway.
TI  - [Antibacterial activities of piperacillin in several fresh clinical isolates].
AB  - We investigated activity of piperacillin (PIPC) in comparison with 8 antibacterial reference drugs against several fresh clinical strains isolated from patients with infectious diseases in the respiratory tract and after surgical interventions in 1999. The following results were obtained: 1. PIPC had its MIC90 of 0.12-6 micrograms/ml in Gram-positive bacteria (Methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis) and showed its MIC of 1 microgram/ml or higher in 9 possible PRSP strains out of 38 isolates of S. pneumoniae but there were no possible isolates with evident resistance in other species of bacteria. 2. PIPC showed favorable antibacterial activities as its MIC90 were 2-8 micrograms/ml in Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Citrobacter freundii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae), except for P. mirabilis in which its MIC90 was as high as 64 micrograms/ml. 11 out of 39 isolates of P. mirabilis were resistant to other drugs such as PIPC, ABPC, CTM and CZOP. 3. PIPC had its MIC90 of > 128 micrograms/ml in Bacteroides fragilis. From these results, PIPC was considered highly effective in several infections in view of maintaining its favorable antibacterial activities in several causative bacteria even today when 20 years had passed since its first application to clinical practice.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents. Special references to bacteria isolated between April 1997 and March 1998].
AB  - The annual multicenter studies on isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery and their antimicrobial susceptibility have been conducted in 19 facilities in Japan since July 1982. This paper describes the results obtained during the period from April 1997 to March 1998. The number of cases investigated as objectives was 215 for one year. A total of 420 strains (170 strains from primary infections and 250 strains from postoperative infections) were isolated from 174 cases (80.9% of total cases). In primary infections, the isolation rate of anaerobic bacteria was higher than in postoperative infections, while in postoperative infections, those of aerobic Gram-positive bacteria and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were higher than in primary infections. Among aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Enterococcus faecalis was the highest, followed by Staphylococcus aureus, which was frequently isolated from postoperative infections. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, Peptostreptococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp. were commonly isolated from both types of infections. Among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by P. aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae in this order, and from postoperative infections, P. aeruginosa was most predominantly isolated, followed by E. coli and K. pneumoniae. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Bacteroides fragilis group was the majority of isolates from both types of infections. We found neither vancomycin nor arbekacin resistant strains of S. aureus, and found no vancomycin resistant strains of Enterococcus spp. The susceptibility of P. aeruginosa against carbapenems did not decline in the year 1997, while resistance of B. fragilis group against cephems advanced increasingly.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of anaerobic and aerobic bacteria isolated from patients with mixed infections in Nicaragua.
AB  - The agar dilution method was used to test the activity of ampicillin, benzylpenicillin, cefoxitin, imipenem, clindamycin, metronidazole, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, methicillin and vancomycin against 241 anaerobic and 227 aerobic bacteria isolated from 136 patients with intraabdominal infections and 49 with nonintraabdominal infections. Beta-lactamase production was tested in all strains. Overall, imipenem, metronidazole and chloramphenicol were the most active antimicrobial agents against anaerobic bacteria followed by clindamycin. Only the Bacteroides fragilis group was shown to be less susceptible to clindamycin (MIC90 8 mg/l). Ampicillin and cefoxitin were the least active beta-lactam antibiotics against the most common isolated B. fragilis group strains (MIC(90) >1024 and 64 mg/l, respectively) and against Escherichia coli strains (MIC(90) >1024 and >1024 mg/l, respectively). Chloramphenicol showed low activity against the Gram-negative aerobic bacteria, while gentamicin had good activity against the aerobic bacteria tested, except for E. coli and Pseudomonas. Among the Gram-positive aerobic and anaerobic bacteria tested, Staphylococcus aureus was shown to be less susceptible to beta-lactam antibiotics (29&#37; were methicillin resistant). No vancomycin-resistant S. aureus strains were found. A good correlation between beta-lactamase production and beta-lactam resistance was observed.

Chloramphenicol showed low activity against the Gram-negative aerobic bacteria, while gentamicin had good activity against the aerobic bacteria tested, except for E. coli and Pseudomonas. Among the Gram-positive aerobic and anaerobic bacteria tested, Staphylococcus aureus was shown to be less susceptible to beta-lactam antibiotics (29&#37; were methicillin resistant).

TI  - Characterization of a Bacteroides mobilizable transposon, NBU2, which carries a functional lincomycin resistance gene.
AB  - The mobilizable Bacteroides element NBU2 (11 kbp) was found originally in two Bacteroides clinical isolates, Bacteroides fragilis ERL and B. thetaiotaomicron DOT. At first, NBU2 appeared to be very similar to another mobilizable Bacteroides element, NBU1, in a 2.5-kbp internal region, but further examination of the full DNA sequence of NBU2 now reveals that the region of near identity between NBU1 and NBU2 is limited to this small region and that, outside this region, there is little sequence similarity between the two elements. The integrase gene of NBU2, intN2, was located at one end of the element. This gene was necessary and sufficient for the integration of NBU2. The integrase of NBU2 has the conserved amino acids (R-H-R-Y) in the C-terminal end that are found in members of the lambda family of site-specific integrases. This was also the only region in which the NBU1 and NBU2 integrases shared any similarity (28% amino acid sequence identity and 49% sequence similarity). Integration of NBU2 was site specific in Bacteroides species. Integration occurred in two primary sites in B. thetaiotaomicron. Both of these sites were located in the 3' end of a serine-tRNA gene NBU2 also integrated in Escherichia coli, but integration was much less site specific than in B. thetaiotaomicron. Analysis of the sequence of NBU2 revealed two potential antibiotic resistance genes. The amino acid sequences of the putative proteins encoded by these genes had similarity to resistances found in gram-positive bacteria. Only one of these genes was expressed in B. thetaiotaomicron, the homolog of linA, a lincomycin resistance gene from Staphylococcus aureus. To determine how widespread elements related to NBU1 and NBU2 are in Bacteroides species, we screened 291 Bacteroides strains. Elements with some sequence similarity to NBU2 and NBU1 were widespread in Bacteroides strains, and the presence of linA(N) in Bacteroides strains was highly correlated with the presence of NBU2, suggesting that NBU2 has been responsible for the spread of this gene among Bacteroides strains. Our results suggest that the NBU-related elements form a large and heterogeneous family, whose members have similar integration mechanisms but have different target sites and differ in whether they carry resistance genes.
TI  - [In vitro activity of faropenem against beta-lactamase producing clinical isolates].
AB  - Each 20 strains of beta-lactamase producing methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, and Bacteroides fragilis group were used as the test strains. Drug susceptibility of these strains to faropenem (FRPM), cefdinir, cefditoren, cefcapene, cefteram, cefaclor, and ampicillin was determined by an agar dilution method according to the NCCLS guideline M100-S9. beta-Lactamase activity of the test strains was determined by a spectrophotometric method. In the present study, FRPM was highly active against beta-lactamase-producing strains, and no close correlation was found between the MICs of FRPM for the test strains and their beta-lactamase activities. These results suggest that FRPM has potential in successful application for the treatment of infectious diseases with various types of bacterial pathogens including beta-lactamase producing strains.
TI  - Microbiology of infected poison ivy dermatitis.
AB  - We report the aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of secondarily infected poison ivy dermatitis. The study involved retrospective review of clinical and microbiology laboratory records of patients with secondarily infected poison ivy lesions. Bacterial growth was noted in 33 specimens. Aerobic or facultative anaerobic bacteria only were present in 18 (55%) patients, anaerobic bacteria only in seven (21%), and mixed anaerobic-aerobic bacteria in eight (24%). Forty-five isolates were recovered (1.4 per specimen): 27 aerobic or facultative anaerobic bacteria, and 18 strict anaerobes. The predominant aerobic and facultative anaerobic bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus (13 isolates) and group A beta-haemolytic streptococci (six). The predominant anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus spp. (seven isolates), pigmented Prevotella and Porphyromonas spp. (four) and Fusobacterium spp. (two). Single bacterial isolates were recovered in 18 (55%) patients, eight of which were S. aureus. Nineteen of the organisms isolated from 16 (48%) patients produced the enzyme beta-lactamase. Organisms that resided in the mucous membranes close to the lesions predominated in those infections. Enteric gram-negative rods and Bacteroides fragilis group predominated in leg and buttock lesions. Group A beta-haemolytic streptococci, pigmented Prevotella and Porphyromonas and Fusobacterium spp. were most frequently recovered from lesions of the finger, face and neck. The polymicrobial aetiology of secondarily infected poison ivy lesions, and the association of bacterial flora with the anatomical site of the lesions, are demonstrated.
TI  - Microbial profile of neonatal infection in Coimbatore.
AB  - In this study, 187 consecutive neonates suspected of having septicaemia were investigated for isolation of micro organisms. Two samples of blood were collected for isolation of aerobes and anaerobes. Cultures were positive in 75 (40%) cases. Aerobic bacteria were the major etiological agent, accounting for 93% of positives including the 8% cases showing polymicrobial etiology. Anaerobic bacteria and Candida species were isolated in 6.6% and 8% of positive cases respectively. Bacteroides fragilis (amongst anaerobic) and Staphylococcus aureus (amongst aerobic) were the predominant organisms isolated. Clinical presentations were not specifically different to distinguish aerobic from anaerobic bacteria. In the present study, 6.6% of bacteremias were due to anaerobes, hence possibility of some of the bactermias being due to anaerobes should be kept in mind while treating cases of neonatal septicaemia. For a complete microbial profile both aerobic and anaerobic cultures should be done.
TI  - Antibacterial properties of KwaZulu natal snake venoms.
AB  - The objective was to ascertain whether local snake venoms have antibacterial properties. The venoms of the common night adder (Causus rhombeatus), gaboon adder (Bitis gabonica), puff adder (Bitis arietans), black mamba (Dendroaspis polylepis), eastern green mamba (Dendroaspis augusticeps), forest cobra (Naja melanoleuca), snouted cobra (Naja annulifera) and Mozambique spitting cobra (Naja mossambica) were collected and, by gel diffusion, tested against the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeriginosa, Bacteriodes fragilis, Bacteroides intermedius, Clostridium sordellii and Clostridium perfringens. All snake venoms showed antibacterial activity, with the adders showing most activity against the aerobes while the cobras showed lesser, but equal activity against the aerobes and anaerobes. Black mamba venom only showed activity against C. perfringens. In conclusion, local snake venoms have antibacterial properties which are dependent on the venom and bacterial type; and in the Naja spp., for anaerobic bacteria, diminish in winter. There is liable to be more than one toxin component responsible.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial spectrum of a new broad-spectrum 8-methoxy fluoroquinolone, gatifloxacin.
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial spectrum of gatifloxacin was compared with those of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. Gatifloxacin was two- to four-fold more potent than comparator quinolones against staphylococci, streptococci, pneumococci and enterococci (gatifloxacin MIC90s, < or =1 mg/L, except 4 mg/L against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecium). Gatifloxacin was two-fold less potent than ciprofloxacin, and the same as or two-fold more potent than ofloxacin against Enterobacteriaceae (MIC90s, 0.06-0.5 mg/L against most members of the Enterobacteriaceae and < or =1 mg/L against Proteus/Morganella spp.). Relative to the comparator quinolones, gatifloxacin was two- to four-fold more potent against Providencia spp., and had good potency against Acinetobacter spp. (MIC90s, 0.25-1 mg/L). Gatifloxacin and ofloxacin had similar anti-pseudomonal potency, with corresponding MIC90s of 4, 8 and 0.25 mg/L for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas fluorescens and Pseudomonas stutzeri, while ciprofloxacin had two- to eight-fold more potency. The three quinolones were equipotent against Burkholderia cepacia (MIC90s, 8 mg/L), but gatifloxacin was two-fold more potent against Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (MIC90, 4 mg/L). Gatifloxacin was highly potent (MIC90s, 0.03-0.06 mg/L) against Haemophilus influenzae, Legionella spp., Helicobacter pylori and had at least eight-fold better anti-chlamydial and anti-mycoplasma potency (gatifloxacin MIC90s, 0.13 mg/L). The higher quinolone MICs for ureaplasma (MIC90s, 4-8 mg/L) may be due to the acidic pH of the ureaplasma test medium, which antagonizes quinolones. Like other quinolones, gatifloxacin had poor potency against Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare, though it was eight- to 16-fold more potent against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MIC90, 0.25 mg/L). Of the three quinolones, only gatifloxacin had activity against Bacteroides fragilis and Clostridium difficile. In summary, gatifloxacin is a broad-spectrum 8-methoxy fluoroquinolone that is more potent than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin against Gram-positive bacteria, chlamydia, mycoplasma, mycobacteria and anaerobes.
TI  - Fourth generation cephalosporins in the antimicrobial chemotherapy of surgical infections.
AB  - Surgical infections include a variety of entities such as secondary peritonitis,  intra-abdominal abscesses, obstetric and gynecological infections as well as bone-joint and soft-tissue infections. By definition the term "surgical infection" implies that surgery itself plays the major role in therapy, while antimicrobial chemotherapy is only supplementary. Broad-spectrum empirical regimens employed include the combination of a 1st or 2nd generation cephalosporin plus clindamycin or metronidazole +/- aminoglycoside (depending on the severity of the condition). Cefepime and cefpirome are new 4th generation parenteral cephalosporins with a spectrum of activity which makes them suitable for the treatment of infections caused by a wide variety of bacteria. They are active against both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms, including Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa with activity comparable to or greater than that of cefotaxime or ceftazidime respectively. Cefepime in particular is also very active against strains of Enterobacter and Pseudomonas spp resistant to these two agents. In comparison with 3rd generation cephalosporins, cefepime appears to be less likely to induce resistance, due to a lower rate of hydrolysis by beta-lactamases, a low affinity for these enzymes and more rapid permeation into the cell. Despite the fact that a 4th generation cephalosporin is well-suited for the treatment of polymicrobial infections, the following should be kept in mind: (I) MRSA strains and Bacteroides fragilis group are not included in their spectrum of activity. (II) Cefpirome is the only cephalosporin with in vitro activity against Enterococci. (III) Severe surgical infections of nosocomial origin, and particularly in settings where Enterobacter spp predominate, represent the major indication for empirical use of a 4th generation cephalosporin in combination with a nitroimidazole.
TI  - Antimicrobial chemotherapy in the control of surgical infectious complications.
AB  - In spite of the progress in surgical technique and antibiotic prophylaxis, postoperative infection still accounts for both the commonest surgical complication and one of the most frequent nosocomial infections, also causing an increase in duration and costs of hospital stay. The choice of treatment for post-surgical infections requires an understanding of the usual infecting flora, available antimicrobial agents, and susceptibility patterns. The most common organisms in simple wound infection are gram-positive cocci and mainly Staphylococcus aureus. Staphylococcus epidermidis and S. aureus (quite often methicillin-resistant strains) are the organisms which predominate in the infectious complications following clean surgical procedures with implantation of vascular grafts or prosthetic devices. Mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora are mainly responsible for cases of intra-abdominal and intra-pelvic postoperative infections: the most common aerobes are Enterobacteriaceae (Escherichia coli, Proteus spp., and others) and enterococci, and among anaerobes Bacteroides fragilis group prevails. Adequate drainage and surgical control of the source of infection, when needed, and adjunctive effective antimicrobial therapy are important factors in successful treatment of postoperative infections. Semisynthetic penicillinase-resistant penicillins and glycopeptides (vancomycin and teicoplanin) are the drugs of choice for the treatment of infections caused by penicillin-resistant methicillin-sensitive, and methicillin-resistant, respectively, S. aureus and S. epidermidis. For the treatment of intra-abdominal and intra-pelvic infections, animal and human studies support the recommendation that treatment should be directed against both gram-negative enteric and anaerobic bacteria. Combinations of aminoglycosides with clindamycin or metronidazole have been widely used with great success; however adverse reactions such as nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity have been a problem in some patients. In recent years monotherapy with either a carbapenem (imipenem/cilastatin or meropenem) or a penicillin/beta-lactamase inhibitor combination has been proposed. Among these combination antimicrobials, piperacillin combined with tazobactam is a very well designed formulation. Indeed, piperacillin is active against a broad range of gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens, and tazobactam is a potent beta-lactamase inhibitor which acts on a variety of clinically important plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases. This combination seems particularly attractive for the treatment of mixed polymicrobial anaerobic-aerobic infections such as intra-abdominal and intra-pelvic postoperative infections.
TI  - T cells activated by zwitterionic molecules prevent abscesses induced by pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - Immunologic paradigms classify bacterial polysaccharides as T cell-independent antigens. However, these models fail to explain how zwitterionic polysaccharides (Zps) confer protection against intraabdominal abscess formation in a T cell-dependent manner. Here, we demonstrate that Zps elicit a potent CD4+ T cell response in vitro that requires available major histocompatibility complex class II molecules on antigen-presenting cells. Specific chemical modifications to Zps show that: 1) the activity is specific for carbohydrate structure, and 2) the proliferative response depends upon free amino and carboxyl groups on the repeating units of these polysaccharides. Peptides synthesized to mimic the zwitterionic charge motif associated with Zps also exhibited these biologic properties. Lysine-aspartic acid (KD) peptides with more than 15 repeating units stimulated CD4+ T cells in vitro and conferred protection against abscesses induced by bacteria such as Bacteroides fragilis and Staphylococcus aureus. Evidence for the biologic importance of T cell activation by these zwitterionic polymers was provided when human CD4+ T cells stimulated with these molecules in vitro and adoptively transferred to rats in vivo conferred protection against intraabdominal abscesses induced by viable bacterial challenge. These studies demonstrate that bacterial polysaccharides with a distinct charge motif activate T cells and that this activity confers immunity to a distinct pathologic response to bacterial infection.
TI  - The in-vitro activity and tentative breakpoint of gemifloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of gemifloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, against a wide range (c. 700) of recent clinical isolates, was compared with that of three other fluoroquinolones and other relevant agents. Gemifloxacin inhibited 90% of the Enterobacteriaceae strains at 0.5 mg/L or less, exceptions being Serratia spp. (MIC(90) 1 mg/L) and strains possessing a putative mechanism of resistance to fluoroquinolones. Ninety per cent of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were inhibited by 4 mg/L. Gemifloxacin had good activity against respiratory pathogens, with 90% of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis being inhibited by 0.06 mg/L or less. Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) were highly susceptible (MIC(90) 0.06 mg/L) but MRSA less susceptible (MIC(90) 8 mg/L) to gemifloxacin. Enterococcus spp. were markedly more susceptible to the study agent than to ciprofloxacin. Gemifloxacin showed good activity against Bacteroides fragilis (MIC(90) 0.5 mg/L) and anaerobic cocci. A tentative in-vitro breakpoint of 0.5 mg/L was studied using a 1 microg disc content for all genera except Pseudomonas where a 5 microg disc content was employed. The false sensitivity reporting rate was 0.5% and false resistance rate was 6.0%, which was considered acceptable. In conclusion, gemifloxacin is a highly active fluoroquinolone that should prove clinically useful in the treatment of a wide range of infections. Susceptibility testing criteria have been developed that should prove robust in a clinical laboratory.
TI  - [An experimental study of the patterns in the development of an inflammatory process in the mandibular bone tissue caused by exposure to anaerobic microflora].
AB  - Inflammatory process in mandibular bone was induced in 39 outbred rats by a pure  culture of Bacteroides fragilis and by an associative culture of B. fragilis and Staphylococcus aureus. Anaerobic microflora notably aggravated the course of inflammation. In contrast to inflammation in other parts of the skeleton, inflammation of the jaws involves a high risk of infection of the oral cavity by pathogenic microflora. A variety of microorganisms is isolated from the focus: from gram-positive staphylococci to gram-negative enterobacteria, which fact should be borne in mind when planning antibiotic therapy. Combined use of antibiotics active towards the entire spectrum of agents detected in this study is the most effective.
TI  - Microbiology of subphrenic abscesses: a 14-year experience.
AB  - The objective of the review was to study the aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of subphrenic abscesses in relation with predisposing conditions. A retrospective review of clinical and laboratory data of 52 patients treated between 1974 and 1988 was conducted. Forty-three (83%) patients developed the abscesses after an operative procedure. These included 11 patients after colonic, 9 patients after gastric or duodenal, 7 patients after abdominal trauma, 7 patients after biliary, and 6 patients after appendix surgery. A total of 194 organisms (3.7 isolates/specimen), 83 aerobic (1.6/specimen), and 111 anaerobes (2.1/specimen) were recovered. Aerobic bacteria only were recovered in 7 (13%) abscesses, anaerobic bacteria only in 11 (21%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in 34 (65%). Polymicrobial infection was present in 47 (90%). The predominant aerobic isolates were Escherichia coli (28 isolates), Enterococcus group D(9), and Staphylococcus aureus (9). The predominant anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus species (33 isolates), Bacteroides fragilis group (25), Clostridium species (13), and Prevotella species (6). The number of isolates/site varied. The number of anaerobic bacteria/site outnumbered or was equal to the number of aerobic or facultatives in all instances, except in abscesses after biliary surgery. Their number/site was especially high in abscesses after appendectomy, and the number of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria was the lowest after gastric or duodenal surgery. S. aureus predominated after gastric, duodenal and posttrauma surgery; B. fragilis predominated after colonic, appendix, and postabdominal trauma surgery; Enterococcus group D predominated after biliary surgery; Fusobacterium and Prevotella species predominated after gastric or duodenal surgery; and Clostridium species predominated after colonic or appendix surgery. These data highlight the polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic nature of subphrenic abscesses and their correlation with predisposing surgery.
TI  - Microbiology of infected pustular psoriasis lesions.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial infections can occur in lesions of pustular psoriasis (PP). The objective of this study was to establish the aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of secondarily infected PP. METHODS: A retrospective 10-year review was carried out of clinical and microbiology laboratory records from patients with secondarily infected PP lesions, whose specimens of infected sites were processed for the presence of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. RESULTS: Bacterial growth was noted in 23 specimens. Aerobic or facultative anaerobic bacteria only were present in 12 patients (52%), anaerobic bacteria only in four (17%), and mixed anaerobic-aerobic flora was present in seven (30%). Thirty-six isolates were recovered (1.6 per specimen), 23 aerobic or facultative bacteria and 13 strict anaerobes. The predominant aerobic and facultative bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus (15 isolates), Group D Enterococcus (two isolates), and Escherichia coli (two isolates). The predominant anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus spp. (six isolates) and Bacteroides fragilis group, Propionibacterium acnes, and pigmented Prevotella spp. in two each. Single bacterial isolates were recovered in 14 patients (61%), 11 of which were S. aureus. Nineteen of the organisms isolated from 18 patients (78%) produced the enzyme beta-lactamase. S. aureus was isolated from all body sites. Organisms that resided in the mucous membranes close to the lesions predominated in these infections. Enteric Gram-negative rods and Bacteroides fragilis group predominated in lesions on the legs and buttocks. Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci, pigmented Prevotella, and Fusobacterium spp. were most frequently recovered in lesions of the hand. CONCLUSIONS: The polymicrobial etiology of secondarily infected PP lesions and the association of bacterial flora with the anatomic site of the lesions were demonstrated.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents: special references to bacteria isolated between July 1996 and June 1997].
AB  - The annual multicenter studies on isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery and their antimicrobial susceptibility have been conducted in 20 facilities in Japan since July 1982. This paper describes the results obtained during period from July 1996 to June 1997. The number of cases investigated as objectives was 217 for one year. A total of 406 strains were isolated from 177 cases (81.6% of total cases). From primary infections 162 strains were isolated, and from postoperative infections 244 strains were isolated, respectively. From primary infections, anaerobic bacteria were predominant, while from postoperative infections, aerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant. Among aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Enterococcus spp. was the highest. In postoperative infections, the majority of them were Enterococcus faecalis, while in primary infections, many of them were Enterococcus avium. The isolation rate of Staphylococcus spp., especially from postoperative infections, followed that of Enterococcus spp. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, Peptostreptococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp. were commonly isolated from both types of infections. Among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in this order, and from postoperative infections, P. aeruginosa was the most predominantly isolated, followed by E. coli and Enterobacter cloacae. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Bacteroides fragilis group was the majority of isolates from both types of infections. The isolation rate of aerobic Gram-negative bacillus has decreased with time, while those of anaerobes like B. fragilis group and of aerobic Gram-positive bacteria have gradually increased in both types of infections. We found vancomycin-resistant strains of neither Staphylacoccus aureus nor Enterococcus spp.; however, the MIC of arbekacin for one of strains of S. aureus was 100 micrograms/ml. Both the MIC90's of meropenem and imipenem/cilastatin against P. aeruginosa isolated in this term were 25 micrograms/ml, which were higher than those against the strains isolated in the previous years. Compared with the isolated strains in the year 1995, progress of resistance against carbapenem antibiotics was confirmed.
TI  - Efficacy of trovafloxacin in an in vitro pharmacodynamic simulation of an intraabdominal infection.
AB  - An in vitro model simulating trovafloxacin concentrations in human serum after standard doses was used to investigate the activity of this drug with time against Bacteroides fragilis, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus. Antibiotic concentrations used for each incubation period were: 4.24 mg/l (0-1 h), 3.69 mg/l (1-3 h), 3.25 mg/l (3-6 h), 2.38 mg/l (6-8 h), 1.35 mg/l (8-24 h). A 99.9% initial inoculum reduction (> 3 log10 cfu/ml) was defined as bactericidal activity. Bactericidal activity against these organisms was obtained with trovafloxacin after the first hour of incubation, and similar activity was obtained against B. fragilis, E. faecalis and S. aureus after 3 h, when they were tested individually. When the strains were tested as mixed culture, there was bactericidal activity against E. coli after 1 h incubation and after 3 h for S. aureus. This activity was observed against B. fragilis and E. faecalis after 6 h incubation in the mixed culture assays and after 3 h when organisms were tested individually. Regrowth was not observed over a 24 h period. These data show that trovafloxacin might be effective in intraabdominal infections caused by mixed aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms.
TI  - In vitro activities of macrolides against gram-positive aerobes, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Bacteroides fragilis in Taiwan.
AB  - BACKGROUND: New macrolides with improved pharmacokinetic characteristics have been developed and introduced for clinical use in Taiwan. In order to understand the antibacterial activities of these new macrolides, we tested their in vitro activities against common pathogenic bacteria. METHODS: Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of azithromycin, clarithromycin, dirithromycin, erythromycin and roxithromycin for clinical isolates collected from six teaching hospitals in Taiwan were determined by the agar dilution method. The tested bacteria included methicillin-sensitive and -resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci, methicillin-sensitive and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus, viridans streptococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus spp, Corynebacterium spp, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Bacteroides fragilis. RESULTS: High MICs were detected against most of the bacteria tested except for H influenzae and M catarrhalis. The MIC90 for viridans streptococci, S pneumoniae, S pyogenes, Enterococcus spp, S aureus (both methicillin-sensitive and -resistant), coagulase-negative staphylococci (both methicillin-sensitive and -resistant), Coryne-bacterium spp, and B fragilis were all at least 128 micrograms/ml. Wide ranges of MICs were demonstrated. CONCLUSIONS: Most bacteria tested were highly resistant to macrolides. This result is a warning for clinicians that rational use of antibiotics, including macrolides, is mandatory.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antimicrobial activities of T-3811ME, a novel des-F(6)-quinolone.
AB  - The in vitro and in vivo activities of T-3811ME, a novel des-F(6)-quinolone, were evaluated in comparison with those of some fluoroquinolones, including a newly developed one, trovafloxacin. T-3811, a free base of T-3811ME, showed a wide range of antimicrobial spectra, including activities against Chlamydia trachomatis, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In particular, T-3811 exhibited potent activity against various gram-positive cocci, with MICs at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited (MIC90s) of 0.025 to 6.25 microgram/ml. T-3811 was the most active agent against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and streptococci, including penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP). T-3811 also showed potent activity against quinolone-resistant gram-positive cocci with GyrA and ParC (GrlA) mutations. The activity of T-3811 against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and nonfermentative gram-negative rods was comparable to that of trovafloxacin. In common with other fluoroquinolones, T-3811 was highly active against Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Legionella sp., with MIC90s of 0.0125 to 0.1 microgram/ml. T-3811 showed a potent activity against anaerobic bacteria, such as Bacteroides fragilis and Clostridium difficile. T-3811 was the most active agent against C. trachomatis (MIC, 0.008 microgram/ml) and M. pneumoniae (MIC90, 0.0313 microgram/ml). The activity of T-3811 against M. tuberculosis (MIC90, 0.0625 microgram/ml) was potent and superior to that of trovafloxacin. In experimental systemic infection with a GrlA mutant of S. aureus and experimental pneumonia with PRSP in mice, T-3811ME showed excellent therapeutic efficacy in oral and subcutaneous administrations.
TI  - [Laboratory and clinical study of nitazole].
AB  - Nitazole, a drug from the nitrotiazole group, was shown to be active in vitro against bacteroides, peptococci, peptostreptococci, clostridia, staphylococci, colibacilli and streptococci. By its activity and antibacterial spectrum nitazole had some advantages over metronidazole, a drug from the nitroimidazole group. Experimental study of nitazole aerosole formulation in 4 models of purulent wounds of rabbits infected by Bacteroides fragilis, B. melaninogenicus, Clostridium perfringens 27 and Staphylococcus aureus 209P revealed its high therapeutic efficacy. In the treatment of 37 patients with purulent wounds of the soft tissues including 12 cases isolating anaerobic microbes, the clinical process of the acute suppuration in all the patients at the average reduced to the 5th-7th day. By the data of the bacteriological and cytological examinations the wound surface was ready for putting in stitches or free perforated cutaneous graft by the 10th-12th day. The drug tolerance was good. No adverse reaction were observed under the nitazole dressing in any case during the treatment of the wounds.
TI  - The in-vitro activity of linezolid (U-100766) and tentative breakpoints.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of linezolid, a novel oxazolidinone, was investigated in comparison with those of amoxycillin, cefuroxime, quinupristin/dalfopristin, trovafloxacin and vancomycin against 420 recent Gram-positive and anaerobic clinical isolates. Linezolid was equally active (MIC90 1 mg/L) against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus. It demonstrated uniform activity against streptococci and enterococci and no cross-resistance with other agents. The time-kill kinetic data demonstrated that the in-vitro activity of linezolid was predominantly bacteriostatic; slow bactericidal activity was only observed at the higher concentration with streptococci. An increase in inoculum from 10(4) to 10(6) cfu on selected strains had little effect on the MICs (MIC90 within one dilution step) of linezolid and an increase in inoculum from 10(5) to 10(7) cfu/mL had no notable effect on the in-vitro bactericidal activity. A tentative linezolid breakpoint of 2 mg/L was chosen after analysis of distribution of susceptibilities.
TI  - In vitro activities of aminomethyl-substituted analogs of novel tetrahydrofuranyl carbapenems.
AB  - CL 188,624, CL 190,294, and CL 191,121 are novel aminomethyl tetrahydrofuranyl (THF)-1 beta-methylcarbapenems. The in vitro antibacterial activities of these THF carbapenems were evaluated and compared with those of biapenem, imipenem, and meropenem against 554 recent clinical isolates obtained from geographically distinct medical centers across North America. The antibacterial activities of the THF carbapenems were equivalent to that of biapenem, and the THF carbapenems were slightly more active than imipenem and less active than meropenem against most of the members of the family Enterobacteriaceae but lacked significant activity against Pseudomonas isolates. In general, CL 191,121 was two- to fourfold more active than CL 188,624 and CL 190,294 against the staphylococcal and enterococcal isolates tested. CL 191,121 was twofold less active than imipenem against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci and was as activity as imipenem against Enterococcus faecalis isolates. Biapenem and meropenem were two- and fourfold less active than CL 191,121, respectively, against the methicillin-susceptible staphylococci and E. faecalis. All the carbapenems displayed equivalent good activities against the streptococci. Biapenem was slightly more active than the other carbapenems against Bacteroides fragilis isolates. Time-kill curve studies demonstrated that the THF carbapenems were bactericidal in 6 h against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus isolates. The postantibiotic effect exerted by CL 191,121 was comparable to or slightly longer than that of imipenem against isolates of S. aureus, E. coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae.
TI  - In vitro activity of meropenem against common pathogenic bacteria isolated in Taiwan.
AB  - The in vitro antimicrobial activity of meropenem, in comparison with nine other antimicrobial agents, against 12 different common pathogenic bacteria were evaluated to know the susceptibility of common bacteria to meropenem in Taiwan. Meropenem was active against most Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and anaerobic bacteria, including methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia cepacia, Acinetobacter baumannii, Haemophilus influenzae, and Bacteroides fragilis. For many of them, meropenem was the most active one in comparison with other broad-spectrum cephalosporins, aztreonam, imipenem, and ciprofloxacin. It is concluded that meropenem is a very active agent against most common pathogenic bacteria. It is uncommon for these common bacteria, except MRSA and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, to be resistant to meropenem in Taiwan, where a high prevalence of resistance to other antimicrobial agents was found in many of the common bacteria.
TI  - Sequence analysis of a cryptic plasmid from Flavobacterium sp. KP1, a psychrophilic bacterium.
AB  - A cryptic plasmid found at high copy number was isolated from Flavobacterium sp.  KP1, a psychrophilic Gram-negative bacterium, cloned, and sequenced. The sequence will appear in the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank databases under the accession number AB007196. The pFL1 plasmid is 2311 nucleotides in length with 32.7% GC content, and shows a distinctive nucleotide sequence without homology to other plasmids of similar length. The plasmid contains two open reading frames of significant length, ORFI and ORFII. ORFI encodes a protein similar to the replication proteins found in Gram-negative bacterial plasmids, Bacteroides fragilis plasmid pBI143 and Zymomonas mobilis plasmid pZM2. The putative translation product of ORFII shows homologies with plasmid recombination proteins found mainly in Gram-positive bacterial plasmids such as Staphylococcus aureus plasmid pT181.
TI  - Microbiology of perianal cellulitis in children: comparison of skin swabs and needle aspiration.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To establish the aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of perianal cellulitis in children, comparing skin swab and needle aspirate methodology. METHOD: Swabs of involved skin and needle aspirates of cellulitis were studied for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. RESULTS: Specimens obtained from 10 patients with perianal cellulitis showed bacterial growth. Polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic flora was found in all skin surface cultures, where the predominate isolates were Peptostreptococcus spp., Escherichia coli, and alpha hemolytic streptococci. The number of isolates in needle aspirates varied between one and two. The predominant ones were E. coli (3), Peptostreptococcus spp. (3), Staphylococcus aureus (2), and Bacteroides fragilis group (2). Complete or partial concordance in microbiology between skin swabs and needle aspirates was present in six instances. In four instances, isolates recovered from needle aspirates were not isolated from the skin surface. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the diversity of aerobic and anaerobic organisms isolated from perianal cellulitis, and the superiority of needle aspirates in establishing the microbiology of the infection.
TI  - [Beta-lactamase producers and other bacteria: which ones to take into consideration and when? The concept of beta-lactamase inhibitor].
AB  
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of endodontic medications].
AB  - BACKGROUND: The successful outcome of endodontic treatment depends on the elimination of bacteria present inside the root canal system. In the pulpal chronic infection, intracanal medicaments are necessary to obtain the sterilization. This study evaluated the antibacterial activities of some intracanal medicaments. METHODS: The bacteria used were: Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus viridans, Escherichia coli, Bacteroides fragilis and Candida albicans; the medicaments used were: Stomidros, Stomilex, Endoidros and Cresatina. Wells were punched in plates and filled with the medicaments to be tested. The diameters of the areas of bacterial inhibition were measured and recorded after 24.48 hours and 7 days. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The most important result of this study is the demonstration of the inefficiency of medicaments like calcium hydroxide against Candida albicans. The Cresatina showed antibacterial activity against all bacteria used.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of infection after trauma.
AB  - Clinical and laboratory data from 1973 to 1988 were retrospectively reviewed to study the microbiology of infection following trauma. A total of 368 specimens obtained from 340 trauma patients showed bacterial growth. The traumas included lacerations (163), blunt trauma (76), penetrating trauma (65), bites (20), and open fractures (10). Anaerobic bacteria only were isolated in 119 (32%) specimens, aerobic bacteria only in 58 (16%), and mixed aerobic-anaerobic flora in 191 (52%). A total of 444 anaerobic (1.2 isolates per specimen) and 267 aerobic or facultative (0.7 per specimen) were recovered. The predominant anaerobic bacteria included Bacteroides fragilis group (119 isolates), Peptostreptococcus spp (113), Clostridium spp (78), Prevotella spp (58), and Fusobacterium spp (23). The predominant aerobic bacteria included Escherichia coli (83), Staphylococcus aureus (61), Streptococcus pyogenes (27), Streptococcus group D (16), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (16). The types of infections included abscesses (109), bacteremia (32), bites (13), empyema (10), osteomyelitis (21), peritonitis (52), thrombophlebitis (12), and wounds (116, including posttraumatic wounds, cellulitis, stump wound, decubitus ulcers, myositis, and fasciitis). S. aureus was isolated at all sites. However, organisms of the oropharyngeal flora predominated in infections that originated from that location (ie, head and neck wounds, and abscesses or bites), and those of the gastrointestinal flora predominated in infections that originated from that site (ie, peritonitis, abdominal abscesses, decubitus ulcers). This study showed the polymicrobial nature of many infections that follow trauma.
TI  - Sinusitis in neurologically impaired children.
AB  - The microbiologic features of infected sinus aspirates in nine children with neurologic impairment were studied. Anaerobic bacteria, always mixed with aerobic and facultative bacteria, were isolated in 6 (67%) aspirates and aerobic bacteria only in 3 (33%). There were 24 bacterial isolates, 12 aerobic or facultative and 12 anaerobic. The predominant aerobic isolates were Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus (2 each) and Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae (1 each). The predominant anaerobes were Prevotella sp. (5), Peptostreptococcus sp. (4), Fusobacterium nucleatum (2), and Bacteroides fragilis (1). Beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were isolated from 8 (89%) patients. Organisms similar to those recovered from the sinuses were also isolated from tracheostomy site and gastrostomy wound aspirates in five of seven instances. This study demonstrates the uniqueness of the microbiologic features of sinusitis in neurologically impaired children, in which, in addition to the organisms known to cause infection in children without neurologic impairment, facultative and anaerobic gram-negative organisms that can colonize other body sites are predominant.
TI  - Superficial suppurative thrombophlebitis in children, caused by anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to present the microbiology and clinical features of six children with superficial suppurative thrombophlebitis (SST) caused by anaerobic bacteria. METHODS: A retrospective review of microbiological and clinical data was undertaken. RESULTS: Anaerobic bacteria alone were recovered in four instances, and they were mixed with facultative bacteria in two. There were 12 bacterial isolates (10 anaerobic and 2 facultatives). The bacteria were Peptostreptococcus species (four isolates), Prevotella species (three), and one isolate each of Fusobacterium nucleatum, Propionibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. SST at an intravenous infusion site developed in all but one patient. One patient sustained trauma to the leg, and cellulitis developed. Anaerobes of oral origin (Prevotella and Fusobacterium species) were recovered in scalp vein SST, and of gastrointestinal origin (Bacteroides fragilis) in a lower extremity SST. CONCLUSION: This study highlights the potential importance of anaerobic bacteria in children with SST.
TI  - Growth-inhibitory effects of Galla Rhois-derived tannins on intestinal bacteria.
AB  - The growth-inhibitory activity of Galla Rhois-derived materials towards 17 intestinal bacteria was evaluated using an impregnated paper disc method. The biologically active components of Galla Rhois were characterized as the tannins methyl gallate (MG) and gallic acid (GA) by spectral analysis. The growth responses varied with bacterial strain tested. In the test using 10 mg disc-1, MG and GA produced a clear inhibitory effect on harmful bacteria such as Clostridium perfringens, Cl. paraputrificum, Eubacterium limosum, Bacteroides fragilis, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. Methyl gallate showed no growth-inhibitory activity towards Bifidobacterium adolescentis or B. longum whereas the growth of B. bifidum, B. breve, B. infantis, B. animalis, B. thermophilum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lact. plantarum and Streptococcus faecalis was slightly affected. However, GA did not adversely affect the growth of the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. At 5 mg disc-1, MG significantly inhibited the growth of Cl. perfringens and Cl. paraputrificum but did not affect the growth of the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. At 1 mg disc-1, MG greatly inhibited the growth of Cl. perfringens alone. These results may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of Galla Rhois.
TI  - Studies on the pathogenicity of anaerobes, especially Prevotella bivia, in a rat  pyometra model.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Prevotella bivia is one of the anaerobic bacteria that resides in the  flora of the female genital tract. We studied the pathogenicity of P. bivia in a rat pyometra model. METHODS: The experimental animal (rat) model of pyometra was developed to investigate the pathogenicity of P. bivia in a rat pyometra model. RESULTS: In the groups inoculated with aerobes alone, the infection rate was 10% (1/10) in the Staphylococcus aureus- or Staphylococcus agalactiae-inoculated group and 20% (2/10) in the Escherichia coli-inoculated group. Infection was not established in the groups inoculated with anaerobes alone. High infection rates were observed in all the mixed-infection groups. In the S. agalactiae- and Bacteroides fragilis-, S. agalactiae- and P. bivia-, F. coli- and B. fragilis-, and E. coli- and P. bivia-inoculated groups, an infection rate of 100% (10/10) was demonstrated. The efficacy of antibiotics such as flomoxef (FMOX) could be determined using a rat pyometra model. In relation to the alteration of vaginal microbial flora during the menstrual cycle, estrogen increased the growth of P. bivia. CONCLUSION: Mixture of aerobic bacteria and P. bivia increased the pathogenicity of P. bivia. Estrogen would be useful for raising up the inflammatory change of the uterus in experimental models of genital tract infection due to P. bivia.
TI  - Pyomyositis associated with Bacteroides fragilis in a patient with multiple myeloma.
AB  - Pyomyositis is an infection of the skeletal muscle that is usually caused by Staphylococcus aureus. We report a 68-year-old Japanese woman who developed pyomyositis caused by Bacteroides fragilis following treatment for multiple myeloma. There are only two cases of pyomyositis associated with multiple myeloma in the literature. After receiving melphalan and prednisolone for five days, she developed multiple abscesses in the muscles of the right arm and thigh. Purulent exudate was aspirated from the abscess, and B. fragilis was identified. This is the first case of B. fragilis pyomyositis. Magnetic resonance imaging aided the diagnosis. Treatment consisted of surgical incision and drainage, with antibiotic administration. The immunosuppression caused by the myeloma and/or the chemotherapy presented a risk factor for the unusual infection observed in this patient.
TI  - Pancreatic fluid collections: diagnostic and therapeutic implications of percutaneous drainage guided by ultrasound.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: The aim of the present study is to assess the usefulness of biochemical and bacteriological analysis of the pancreatic fluid obtained at percutaneous drainage of pancreatic pseudocysts and abscesses guided by ultrasound. METHODOLOGY: The study population was comprised of 65 patients, aged 21-79 years: 18 with abscesses and 47 with pseudocysts. In all cases the etiological factor of pancreatic fluid collections was acute pancreatitis. Microbiological (both of aerobic and anaerobic flora), biochemical (including alpha 2-macroglobulin) and cytological analysis of aspirated fluid was performed. Duration of percutaneous drainage in pseudocysts was 10-40 days (mean 18 +/- 12) and in abscesses 21-56 days (mean 32 +/- 19). RESULTS: Complete resolution of pancreatic fluid collections was obtained in 54 (83%) patients, among them in 40 (85.1%) with pseudocysts and in 14 (77.7%) with abscesses, which was confirmed in follow-up ultrasound and/or computed tomography one year after the catheter was removed. Mild complications of this procedure observed in 17 (26.1%) patients were managed without catheter removal. A variety of organisms were cultured from pancreatic fluid, E. coli being the most prevalent. Enterobacter cloacae, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, peptococcus saccharolyticus, propionibacterium acnes and bacteroides fragilis were also isolated. Cytologic analysis of the aspirate revealed no atypical cells. The level of alpha 2-macroglobulin in the pancreatic fluid was significantly higher (p < 0.05) in patients with successful pancreatic drainage as compared to the remaining group. CONCLUSION: Percutaneous drainage represents a safe therapeutic method that also provides additional criteria for the management of patients with pancreatic cystic lesions.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of chronic venous ulcers.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The role of bacteria in the pathogenesis of chronic venous leg ulcers (CVLU) is unclear. The objective of the study was to establish the aerobic and anaerobic bacteriology of CVLU. METHODS: A retrospective review was carried out of the clinical and microbiological laboratory records obtained from patients with CVLU. Microorganisms were grown from 43 specimens obtained from 41 patients. RESULTS: Aerobic or facultative bacteria alone were present in 18 (42%) specimens, anaerobic bacteria only in three (7%), and mixed aerobic-anaerobic flora in 22 (51%). In total, there were 97 isolates, 64 aerobic or facultative and 33 anaerobic, an average of 2.3 isolates per specimen (1.5 aerobes and 0.8 anaerobes). The predominant aerobic organisms were Staphylococcus aureus (26 isolates), group D streptococci (5), and Escherichia coli(5). The predominant anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus spp. (15), Bacteroides fragilis group (6), Propionibacterium acnes (4), and Prevotella spp. (3). CONCLUSIONS: CVLU have a polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic flora.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of retroperitoneal abscesses.
AB  - The aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of various types of retroperitoneal abscesses was studied by review of the clinical and laboratory data for 161 patients treated between 1974 and 1990 for such abscesses. These included 109 anterior, 8 posterior, 21 retrofascial, and 23 pelvic retroperitoneal abscesses. A total of 472 organisms (2.9 isolates/specimen)--204 aerobic and facultative (1.3/specimen), and 268 anaerobic (1.7/specimen)--were recovered. Aerobes only were recovered from 34 abscesses (21%), anaerobes only from 34 (21%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria from 93 (58%). Polymicrobial infection was present in 132 patients (82%). The predominant aerobic and facultative isolates were Escherichia coli (60 isolates), Klebsiella pneumoniae (20), Streptococcus group D (19), and Staphylococcus aureus (11). The predominant anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus species (95 isolates), Bacteroides fragilis group (66), Prevotella species (22), and Clostridium species (22). The number of anaerobes per site always was greater than the number of aerobic or facultative organisms and was especially high in pelvic abscesses. The number of aerobic and facultative organisms was especially high in pancreatic abscesses. These data highlight the polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic nature of retroperitoneal abscesses.
TI  - [Survey of the sensitivities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents (annual report)].
AB  - Research groups were formed in 21 institutions nationwide to investigate carbapenem resistance. The activities of various antibacterial agents, principally carbapenems were tested against clinical isolates collected from these institutions. The broth microdilution method was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of 17 antibacterial agents for 1,282 strains of 11 bacterial species isolated at all institutions between October and December 1995. The results were as follows: 1. Carbapenems exhibited strong antibacterial activities against MSSA and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Their activities against Enterococcus faecalis were comparable to that of ABPC. Carbapenems showed low activities against MRSA. 2. OFLX exhibited the greatest antibacterial activity against Haemophilus influenzae, followed by MEPM. The antibacterial activities of the other carbapenems were comparable to those of FMOX and CTM. 3. The carbapenems showed high activities against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, and Bacteroides fragilis group. Their activities were greater than that exhibited by other beta-lactam antibacterial agents. The carbapenems also exhibited greater antibacterial activities against Serratia marcescens than the other beta-lactam antibacterial agents, but some resistant strains were detected. 4. The antibacterial activities of carbapenems against Pseudomonas aeruginosa were comparable to those of CAZ, AZT, AMK.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic infection associated with malignancy.
AB  - The goal of this work was to study the microbiology and clinical characteristics  of patients with infections associated with malignancy treated over a period of 17 years. A total of 668 specimens were obtained from 605 patients. The malignancies include 224 hematological malignancies and 381 nonhematogenic malignancies. Anaerobic bacteria only were isolated in 201 (30%) specimens, aerobic bacteria in 226 (34%), mixed aerobic-anaerobic bacteria in 231 (35%) and Candida spp. in 10 (1%). A total of 683 anaerobic (1.0 isolates per specimens) and 592 aerobic or facultative (0.9 per specimen) organisms were recovered. The predominant anaerobic bacteria included Bacteroides fragilis group isolates (181), Peptostreptococcus spp. (166), Prevotella spp. (106), Clostridium spp. (70), and Fusobacterium spp. (43). The predominant aerobic bacteria included Escherichia coli (133), Staphylococcus aureus (100), Klebsiella pneumoniae (48), and Pseudomonas aeroginosa (45). The type of infections included abscesses (221), bacteremia (198), wounds (175), including 61 cellulitis, 24 post-surgical wounds and 23 decubitus ulcers), peritonitis (48), empyema (12), cholecystitis (6) and thrombophlebitis (5). S. aureus and Peptostreptococcus spp. were isolated from all sites. However, organisms of the oropharyngeal flora (Prevotella and Fusobacterium spp.) predominated in local infections and bacteremia that originated from this site (head and neck wounds and abscesses and pulmonary infections), and organisms of the gastrointestinal tract flora predominated in infections that originated from this site (peritonitis, abdominal abscesses and decubitus ulcers). This retrospective study demonstrates polymicrobial features of many infections associated with malignancies.
TI  - Pharmacodynamic properties of HMR 3647, a novel ketolide, on respiratory pathogens, enterococci and Bacteroides fragilis demonstrated by studies of time-kill kinetics and postantibiotic effect.
AB  - The pharmacodynamic properties of a novel ketolide (a new class of macrolide), HMR 3647, were investigated by studying time-kill kinetics and postantibiotic effect (PAE). The time-kill kinetics were studied at two inocula against three strains each of Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium and Bacteroides fragilis. The PAEs of HMR 3647 were also investigated on these organisms at concentrations equivalent to 1, 4 and 10 x MIC. The time-kill kinetic data demonstrated that HMR 3647 is predominantly bacteriostatic and only slowly bactericidal at higher concentrations. HMR 3647 exhibited a significant PAE with all strains studied, ranging from 1.2 h to 8.2 h at 10 x MIC. The bacteriostatic activity and significant PAE demonstrated by HMR 3647 are similar to those previously obtained with other macrolides.
TI  - Microbiology of necrotizing fasciitis associated with omphalitis in the newborn infant.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to report the aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of periumbilical necrotizing fasciitis in newborn infants. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review was done of the author's 20-year experience. RESULTS: Specimens obtained from 11 newborn infants with periumbilical necrotizing fasciitis were cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. A total of 38 bacterial isolates was recovered: 21 aerobic and facultative and 17 anaerobic. Aerobic or facultative bacteria only were present in 1 specimen (9%), anaerobes only in 2 (18%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora in 8 (73%). Multiple organisms were recovered from all instances and the number of isolates varied from two to six (average 3.5 isolates per specimen). The predominant isolates were Peptostreptococcus sp. (7 isolates); Bacteroides fragilis group (6); streptococcus group B (4); and Staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus group D, Escherichia coli, and Proteus mirabilis (3 each). All patients underwent extensive debridement and resection, and they received supportive and antimicrobial therapy. Six (55%) of the patients died. CONCLUSIONS: These findings illustrate the polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic flora of periumbilical necrotizing fasciitis.
TI  - Synergistic activity of trovafloxacin with other agents against gram-positive and -negative organisms.
AB  - The synergistic activity of trovafloxacin with other agents against 55 Gram-positive and -negative bacteria was determined by checkerboard titration. Synergistic fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) indices (< or = 0.5) were seen in two methicillin-susceptible and one methicillin-resistant Staphyloccocus aureus with teicoplanin, one of each of the latter two with vancomycin; one methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative Staphylococcus with rifampin and one with fusidic acid; five Stenotrophomonas maltophilia with cefoperazone; three Pseudomonas aeruginosa with ticarcillin/clavulanate, four with aztreonam, two with ceftazidime, one with tobramycin, one with cefoperazone, and one with ceftriaxone; one pneumococcus with ceftriaxone; one Enterococcus faecalis with ceftriaxone, and one with vancomycin; two Bacteroides fragilis with metronidazole, two with clindamycin, and one with cefoxitin; and one Clostridium perfringens with metronidazole and one with clindamycin. All other FIC indices were additive/indifferent (0.51-2.0), and no antagonistic FIC indices (> 4.0) were observed.
TI  - Effects of surgery on mucosal pathologic changes following experimental sinusitis in rabbit.
AB  - In the present investigation, the regenerative capacity of the infected maxillary sinus mucosa following surgical procedures was studied in a rabbit model. Sinusitis was induced by occluding the ostium with and without the addition of Staphylococcus aureus or Bacteroides fragilis, or by provoking a prolonged bacterial infection with both pathogens. The surgical procedures performed were 1) widening of the natural sinus ostium (middle meatal antrostomy; MMA) and 2) removal of sinus mucosa without ostial interference (modified radical operation; MRO). The histologic features of the entire nose-sinus complex were studied, graded semiquantitatively, and compared with findings in untreated sinusitis, or after surgery only. Whereas MMA and MRO both led to a decrease of the inflammatory features of the sinus mucosa in induced sinusitis, persistent local histopathology was observed in the ostial region following MMA surgery. This indicates the importance of local pathologic changes resulting from interactions of bacterial colonization, inflammation, and surgery in chronic sinusitis.
TI  - Cytokine and prostaglandin production by amnion cells in response to the addition of different bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Our goal was to evaluate the effect of Escherichia coli, Bacteroides fragilis, Mycoplasma hominis, and Staphylococcus aureus on cytokine and prostaglandin production by amnion cells in vitro. STUDY DESIGN: Amnion cells were obtained from women undergoing elective cesarean section before the onset of labor and cultured in a primary cell culture. Confluent amnion cells were incubated with heat-inactivated bacteria in different concentrations (10(1) to 10(6) colony-forming units/ml) for 48 hours. Samples for quantification of interleukin-1 beta, interleukin-6, interleukin-8, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and prostaglandin E2 were collected at 6, 12, 24, and 48 hours. RESULTS: Under basal conditions, minor amounts of interleukin-6 and interleukin-8 were detectable. Incubation of amnion cells with E. coli enhanced the secretion of interleukin-8 and also induced an transient increase of prostaglandin E2 in a dose-dependent manner. B. fragilis produced an increase in the secretion of interleukin-6 and interleukin-8. M. hominis and S. aureus did not cause an increase in either interleukin-6, interleukin-8, or prostaglandin E2. CONCLUSION: The gram-negative bacteria E. coli and B. fragilis stimulated interleukin-6 and interleukin-8 to a greater degree than the other bacteria investigated in this study. This finding may be of clinical interest in the onset of preterm birth.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of CS-834, a novel oral carbapenem.
AB  - CS-834 is a novel oral carbapenem antibiotic. This compound is an ester-type prodrug of the active metabolite R-95867. The antibacterial activity of R-95867 was tested against 1,323 clinical isolates of 35 species and was compared with those of oral cephems, i.e., cefteram, cefpodoxime, cefdinir, and cefditoren, and that of a parenteral carbapenem, imipenem. R-95867 exhibited a broad spectrum of activity covering both gram-positive and -negative aerobes and anaerobes. Its activity was superior to those of the other compounds tested against most of the bacterial species tested. R-95867 showed potent antibacterial activity against clinically significant pathogens: methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus including ofloxacin-resistant strains, Streptococcus pneumoniae including penicillin-resistant strains, Clostridium perfringens, Neisseria spp., Moraxella catarrhalis, most members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, and Haemophilus influenzae (MIC at which 90% of strains are inhibited, < or =0.006 to 0.78 microg/ml). R-95867 was quite stable to hydrolysis by most of the beta-lactamases tested except the metallo-beta-lactamases from Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Bacteroides fragilis. R-95867 showed potent bactericidal activity against S. aureus and Escherichia coli. Penicillin-binding proteins 1 and 4 of S. aureus and 1Bs, 2, 3, and 4 of E. coli had high affinities for R-95867. The in vivo efficacy of CS-834 was evaluated in murine systemic infections caused by 16 strains of gram-positive and -negative pathogens. The efficacy of CS-834 was in many cases superior to those of cefteram pivoxil, cefpodoxime proxetil, cefdinir, and cefditoren pivoxil, especially against infections caused by S. aureus, penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae, E. coli, Citrobacter freundii, and Proteus vulgaris. Among the drugs tested, CS-834 showed the highest efficacy against experimental pneumonia in mice caused by penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae.
TI  - Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of two multiple-dose piperacillin-tazobactam regimens.
AB  - The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of two multiple-dose regimens of piperacillin-tazobactam (3.375 g every 6 h and 4.5 g every 8 h) were evaluated at steady state for 12 healthy adult volunteers. Inhibitory and bactericidal activities for the two regimens were determined with five American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) organisms (Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Bacteroides fragilis). The percentage of time that plasma concentrations remained above the MIC (T > MIC) for each organism and dosage regimen was calculated. Areas under the inhibitory (AUIC0-24) and bactericidal activity (AUBC0-24) curves were calculated with the trapezoidal rule by using the reciprocal of the inhibitory and bactericidal titers determined for each dosage regimen. In order to assess the validity of predicted measures of bactericidal (AUC0-24/MBC) and inhibitory (AUC0-24/MIC) activity to determine bacteriological response to beta-lactam antimicrobial agents, AUC0-24/MBC and AUC0-24/MIC values were compared with measured AUBC0-24 and AUIC0-24 values. Total body clearance values were equivalent for piperacillin (183.96 +/- 22.66 versus 181.72 +/- 19.54 ml/min/1.73 m2, P > 0.05) and tazobactam (184.71 +/- 19.89 versus 184.87 +/- 18.35 ml/min/1.73 m2, P > 0.05) following the administration of the 3.375-g-every-6-h and 4.5-g-every-8-h dosages, respectively. Comparison of area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC0-24) for piperacillin (967.74 +/- 135.56 microg x h/ml versus 978.88 +/- 140.96 microg x h/ml) and tazobactam (120.14 +/- 15.78 microg x h/ml versus 120.01 +/- 16.22 microg x h/ml) revealed no significant differences (P > 0.05) between the 3.375-g-every-6-h and 4.5-g-every-8-h regimens, respectively. Both regimens provided T > MIC values of > 60% for all organisms tested. Measured values of bactericidal (AUBC) and inhibitory (AUIC) activity were significantly different (P < 0.05) from predicted values (AUC0-24/MBC and AUC0-24/MIC) for all organisms studied with the exception of the bactericidal activity for P. aeruginosa and S. aureus. Additionally, ATCC organisms possessing the same MICs and MBCs exhibited great differences in measured AUBC0-24 and AUIC0-24 values. Reasons for this difference may be inherent differences in organism specific susceptibility.
TI  - The aerobic and anaerobic bacteriology of perirectal abscesses.
AB  - The microbiology of perirectal abscesses in 144 patients was studied. Aerobic or  facultative bacteria only were isolated in 13 (9%) instances, anaerobic bacteria only were isolated in 27 (19%) instances, and mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora were isolated in 104 (72%) instances. A total of 325 anaerobic and 131 aerobic or facultative isolates were recovered (2.2 anaerobic isolates and 0.9 aerobic isolates per specimen). The predominant anaerobes were as follows: Bacteroides fragilis group (85 isolates), Peptostreptococcus spp. (72 isolates), Prevotella spp. (71 isolates), Fusobacterium spp. (21 isolates), Porphyromonas spp. (20 isolates), and Clostridium spp. (15 isolates). The predominant aerobic and facultative bacteria were as follows: Staphylococcus aureus (34 isolates), Streptococcus spp. (28 isolates), and Escherichia coli (19 isolates). These data illustrate the polymicrobial aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of perirectal abscesses.
TI  - [Study of 112 patients with septic arthritis caused by pyogenic organisms and fungi: changes in the clinical spectrum during the last 2 decades].
AB  - A retrospective study of 112 patients with septic arthritis (SA) caused by pyogenic organisms and fungi attended at the same Medical Service from 1975 to 1994. This SA was more common among male patients and the age at onset of disease was 42 +/- 23.2 years. Predisposing factors were identified in 53 patients, the more common being connective tissue diseases and parenteral drug abuse (PDA). The main portal of entry was bacteremia from a distant infective source. The most common causative agents were Grampositive cocci (particularly S. aureus) and the more uncommon organisms were recovered from patients with underlying diseases. The diagnostic delay was 14.1 +/- 28.1 days. Single joint SA occurred in 88% of patients. Large joints were mainly involved. On admission, 25% of patients had no fever and only 54% of them had leukocytosis; therefore, the lack of these findings in a given patient with acute arthritis should not rule out the possibility of SA. Initial therapy consisted of daily arthrocentesis and i.v. antibiotics. The mean duration of antibiotic therapy was 47 +/- 23 days; the duration of the i.v. route was 23 +/- 14 days. An eighty percent of patients recovered without functional sequelae. The 31 patients who required surgical drainage had a longer diagnostic delay and a worse evolution, thus stressing the necessity of an early diagnosis. In the last decade (1986-1994) an increase in some predisposing factors (iatrogenic SA and PDA), a shorter diagnostic delay, a more prolonged antibiotic therapy, a smaller proportion of surgical drainage and an ultimate evolution identical to that in the previous decade were observed.
TI  - Differential induction of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in whole blood by  bacteria: effects of antibiotic treatment.
AB  - The in vitro production of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), IL-6, and the IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) in whole blood upon stimulation with different bacterial strains was measured to study the possible relationship between disease severity and the cytokine-inducing capacities of these strains. Escherichia coli, Neisseria meningitidis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Bacteroides fragilis, Capnocytophaga canimorsus, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pyogenes induced the cytokines IL-1beta, IL-6, and IL-1ra. Gram-negative bacteria induced significantly higher levels of proinflammatory cytokine production than gram-positive bacteria. These differences were less pronounced for the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-1ra. In addition, blood was stimulated with E. coli killed by different antibiotics to study the effect of the antibiotics on the cytokine-inducing capacity of the bacterial culture. E. coli treated with cefuroxime and gentamicin induced higher levels of IL-1beta and IL-6 production but levels of IL-1ra production similar to that of heat-killed E. coli. In contrast, ciprofloxacin- and imipenem-cilastatin-mediated killing showed a decreased or similar level of induction of cytokine production as compared to that by heat-killed E. coli; polymyxin B decreased the level of production of the cytokines.
TI  - Pharmacodynamic properties of BAY 12-8039 on gram-positive and gram-negative organisms as demonstrated by studies of time-kill kinetics and postantibiotic effect.
AB  - Time-kill kinetics of BAY 12-8039 were studied at two inocula against three strains each of Bacteroides fragilis, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, and Streptococcus pyogenes. The postantibiotic effects of BAY 12-8039 were studied on three strains each of E. coli, S. aureus, H. influenzae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The pharmacodynamic data demonstrated that BAY 12-8039 has marked activity against gram-positive and gram-negative organisms (under both anaerobic and aerobic conditions) and anaerobes. BAY 12-8039 also exhibited a postantibiotic effect of >1 h for all strains except one E. coli strain.
TI  - Microbiology of nonbullous impetigo.
AB  - Our objective was to establish the aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of nonbullous impetigo (NI) in children. We used a retrospective review of clinical microbiology laboratory and patients' records. Specimens were obtained from 40 patients with NI lesions and showed bacterial growth. Aerobic or facultative anaerobic bacteria only were present in 24 patients (60%), strict anaerobic bacteria only in 5 patients (12.5%), and mixed anaerobic-aerobic flora was present in 11 patients (27.5%). Sixty-four isolates were recovered (1.6 per specimen): 43 aerobic or facultative, and 21 anaerobic. The predominant aerobic and facultative bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus (29 isolates), Group A beta hemolytic streptococcus (GABHS) (13 isolates), and Escherichia coli (1 isolate). The predominant anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus spp. (12), pigmented Prevotella spp. (5), Fusobacterium spp. (2), and Bacteroides fragilis (1). Single bacterial isolates were recovered in 17 patients (42.5%), 13 of which were S. aureus. S. aureus alone or mixed with GABHS or Peptostreptococcus spp. were isolated from all body sites. Mixed flora of Peptostreptococcus spp. with Prevotella spp. or Fusobacterium spp. was mostly found in infections of the head and neck, while E. coli mixed with B. fragilis and Peptostreptococcus spp. were isolated from one infection of the buttocks area. Thirty-three organisms isolated from 32 patients (80%) produced the enzyme beta-lactamase. This study demonstrates the polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic microbiology of NI lesions.
TI  - Antimicrobial characteristics of quinupristin/dalfopristin (Synercid at 30:70 ratio) compared to alternative ratios for in vitro testing.
AB  - Quinupristin/dalfopristin is a new streptogramin combination that occurs at a natural ratio and formulation of 30:70. Rapid metabolism of the dalfopristin component to RP 12536 in vivo puts in question the validity of in vitro test of spectrum with the parent combination. In studies of quinupristin with both dalfopristin and RP 12536, a wide range of ratios (30:70, 50:50, 70:30) were tested by reference MIC and MBC tests. No significant potency differences were observed between combination ratios or metabolic components when testing 256 bacterial strains. Quinupristin/dalfopristin or quinupristin/RP 12536 remained active, by bactericidal action against many staphylococci and Streptococcus ssp. Enterococcus faecium strains were susceptible (MIC90, 2 micrograms/ml; static effect only) to the streptogramin, but E. faecalis, Pasteurella multocida, Pediococcus ssp., Haemophilus influenzae, and Bacteroides fragilis were generally less susceptible (MIC90, > or = 8 micrograms/ml). The log phase inoculum was preferred for MBC and kill-curve tests with this combination. The 30:70 ratio in vitro susceptibility test of quinupristin/dalfopristin as used to date, seems to predict the potency and spectrum of this streptogramin accurately and all clinically important in vivo ratios of the injectable form or its major metabolites. Quinupristin/dalfopristin should be further investigated for clinical use against emerging resistant Gram-positive infections, especially penicillin-resistant streptococci and glycopeptide-resistant E. faecium that exhibit susceptibility in this investigation.
TI  - The activity of the methylpiperazinyl fluoroquinolone CG 5501: a comparison with  other fluoroquinolones.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of CG 5501 against a wide range of recent clinical isolates was compared with that of three fluoroquinolones. CG 5501 inhibited 90% of the species of the family Enterobacteriaceae at 0.5 mg/L or less, exceptions being Enterobacter spp. (MIC90 2 mg/L) and Serratia spp. (MIC90 4 mg/L). Ninety per cent of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Acinetobacter spp. were inhibited by 16, 4 and 1 mg/L respectively. CG 5501 had high activity against Gram-positive cocci, 90% of staphylococci being inhibited at 2 mg/L. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains were generally ciprofloxacin-resistant yet were all susceptible to 4 mg/L or less of CG 5501. Isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae were eight-fold more susceptible to CG 5501 (MIC90 0.5 mg/L) than to ciprofloxacin (MIC90 4 mg/L) and the former had a similar activity to that of trovafloxacin and sparfloxacin. Enterococcus faecalis was generally two- to four-fold more susceptible to CG 5501 or trovafloxacin than to ciprofloxacin. CG 5501 and trovafloxacin had high activity against Bacteroides fragilis (MIC90 0.25 mg/L). Five strains of Chlamydia spp. were inhibited by < or =0.12 mg/L of CG 5501; sensitive and multiresistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis were inhibited by < or =0.5 mg/L of CG 5501. The high activity and breadth of its antibacterial spectrum suggests that CG 5501 should be useful in a wide range of clinical infections.
TI  - Pharmacodynamic properties of faropenem demonstrated by studies of time-kill kinetics and postantibiotic effect.
AB  - The pharmacodynamic properties of faropenem, a new oral penem antibiotic, were investigated by studying time-kill kinetics and postantibiotic effect. Time-kill kinetics were employed against strains of Bacteroides fragilis, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Streptococcus pyogenes. The postantibiotic effects of faropenem were studied using strains of E. coli, S. aureus, H. influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The time-kill kinetic data demonstrated that faropenem has bactericidal activity. Faropenem exhibited a significant postantibiotic effect against all strains except H. influenzae.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of low-dose clindamycin administered at 8- and 12-hour intervals against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Bacteroides fragilis.
AB  - Twelve volunteers received 300 mg of clindamycin intravenously (i.v.) or orally (p.o.) administered every 8 h (q8h) or q12h by random assignment over four study periods. Serum bactericidal titers were determined for each regimen against two isolates each of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae (one penicillin-sensitive isolate and one penicillin-resistant isolate), and Bacteroides fragilis. The duration of measurable bactericidal activity over the dosing interval (expressed as a percentage of the dosing interval) was determined for each isolate. No significant differences in the duration of activity were observed between i.v. and p.o. regimens dosed according to the same interval (P > 0.05). All regimens provided bactericidal activity against S. pneumoniae for 100% of their respective dosing intervals. Against B. fragilis, bactericidal activity was observed for greater than 80% of the dosing interval for each of the regimens. Although a statistically significant difference favoring the q8h i.v. regimen (P < 0.05) was detected, this difference is not believed to be clinically significant. The q8h and q12h regimens provided measurable bactericidal activity against S. aureus for greater than 85 and 50% of the dosing intervals, respectively (P < 0.001). Clindamycin dosed at 300 mg i.v. or p.o., q8h or q12h, provides adequate coverage against S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, and B. fragilis.
TI  - [Nationwide survey of susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents in 1992].
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical isolates to  imipenem (IPM) and other antibacterial agents in 144 hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1992. In this study, the isolates were identified and susceptibility tests were performed at individual laboratories. The susceptibility tests were performed using the disk dilution method recommended by NCCLS. S. aureus (including MRSA) strains were highly susceptible to arbekacin (ABK) and netilmicin (NTL). S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae were susceptible to most of the agents tested. E. faecalis were highly susceptible to penicillins and imipenem (IPM). P. aeruginosa showed high susceptibility to ceftazidime (CAZ), IPM and amikacin (AMK). Annual changes in antimicrobial susceptibility patterns over 5 years (1988-1992) were examined. The frequency of sensitive strains of S. aureus to methicillin (DMPPC) has slightly increased from 1991 to 1992. A moderate increases of PCG-insensitive S. pneumoniae was observed. B. fragilis group showed a slight increase in sensitivity to minocycline (MINO) but no yearly changes in IPM sensitivity was observed.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents. Special references to bacteria isolated between July 1995 and June 1996].
AB  - Isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery during the period from July  1994 to June 1995 were investigated in a multicenter study in Japan, and the following results were obtained. One hundred and sixty-four strains were isolated from primary infections, and 202 strains were isolated from postoperative infections. From primary infections, anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant, while from post operative infections, aerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant. Among aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Enterococcus faecalis was the highest, followed by that of Staphylococcus aureus from postoperative infections. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Peptostreptococcus spp. was the highest from both types of infections. Among anaerobic Gram-negative, Escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in this order, and from postoperative infections, P. aeruginosa was the most predominantly isolated, followed by Enterobacter spp. and Klebsiella spp. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of Bacteroides fragilis group was the highest from both types of infections. We noticed that MICs of cefazolin against three out of 23 strains of E. coli were higher than 100 micrograms/ml. Among anaerobic bacteria, there were many resistant strains against penicillins and cephems with MICs higher than 100 micrograms/ml, and the same trend was observed among other Bacteroides spp. and Prevotella spp.
TI  - The in-vitro activity of faropenem, a novel oral penem.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of faropenem, a novel oral penem, was studied in comparison with other beta-lactam antimicrobials against 711 recent clinical isolates including Gram-negative, Gram-positive and anaerobic bacteria. MIC data showed that faropenem was active against most members of the Enterobacteriaceae (MICs < or = 4 mg/L), with reduced activity against Serratia spp. (MIC90 = 32 mg/L). In common with its comparators, faropenem had weak activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (MIC > 128 mg/L). Faropenem was active against staphylococci, although for MRSA MICs were raised (MIC90 = 2 mg/L) compared with those for MSSA (MIC90 = 0.12 mg/L). Faropenem was also found to be active against streptococci, Neisseria spp., Enterococcus faecalis and beta-lactamase-producing and non-producing strains of Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis. Of the anaerobic bacteria studied, faropenem was most active against peptostreptococci and Clostridium perfringens (MIC90 < or = 1 mg/L) and Bacteroides fragilis (MIC90 = 4 mg/L). An increase in inoculum from 10(4) to 10(6) cfu raised faropenem MICs for Morganella morganii from 0.06-1 mg/L to 2-4 mg/L and for MRSA from 0.25-2 mg/L to 8 mg/L (a similar increase was not observed for MSSA). The MICs of faropenem were not affected by the presence of either 20% or 70% (v/v) serum. MICs for faropenem to 11 well characterized beta-lactamase producers were similar to those of non-producers. In hydrolysis studies, faropenem was shown to be highly stable to a number of beta-lactamases, including TEM-1, SHV-1, the extended spectrum beta-lactamases, TEM-3 and TEM-9, and the beta-lactamase produced by Staphylococcus aureus (NCTC 11561).
TI  - Microbiology of otitis externa.
AB  - Microbiologic and clinical data from 26 patients with otitis externa were prospectively evaluated. Specimens were processed for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Bacterial growth was noted in 23 specimens. A total of 33 aerobic and 2 anaerobic bacteria were recovered. Aerobic bacteria only were isolated in 21 (91%) patients, anaerobic bacteria only in 1 (4%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in 1 (4%). The most common isolates were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (14 instances), Staphylococcus aureus (7), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (2), Proteus mirabilis (2), Enterococcus faecalis (2), Bacteroides fragilis (1), and Peptostreptococcus magnus (1). One isolate was recovered in 13 (57%) patients, 2 isolates in 8 (35%), and 3 isolates in 2 (9%). These data illustrate the polymicrobial nature of otitis externa in about half of the patients and the role of anaerobic bacteria in 8% of them. Further studies are warranted to evaluate the therapeutic implications of these findings.
TI  - In vitro activity of BAY 12-8039, a new fluoroquinolone.
AB  - The in vitro activity of BAY 12-8039, a new fluoroquinolone, was studied in comparison with those of ciprofloxacin, trovafloxacin (CP 99,219), cefpodoxime, and amoxicillin-clavulanate against gram-negative, gram-positive, and anaerobic bacteria. Its activity against mycobacteria and chlamydia was also investigated. BAY 12-8039 was active against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae (MIC at which 90% of strains tested were inhibited [MIC90S] < or = 1 microgram/ml, except for Serratia spp. MIC90 2 microgram/ml), Neisseria spp. (MIC90S, 0.015 microgram/ml), Haemophilus influenzae (MIC90, 0.03 microgram/ml), and Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC90, 0.12 micrgram/ml), and these results were comparable to those obtained for ciprofloxacin and trovafloxacin. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the quinolones were more active than the beta-lactam agents but BAY 12-8039 was less active than ciprofloxacin. Strains of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia were fourfold more susceptible to BAY 12-8039 and trovafloxacin (MIC90S, 2 micrograms/ml) than to ciprofloxacin. BAY 12-8039 was as active as trovafloxacin but more active than ciprofloxacin against Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC90, 0.25 microgram/ml) and methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus auerus (MIC90S, 0.12 micrograms/ml). The activity of BAY 12-8039 against methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MIC90, 2 micrograms/ml) was lower than that against methicillin-susceptible strains. BAY 12-8039 was active against anaerobes (MIC90S < or = 2 micrograms/ml), being three- to fourfold more active against Bacteroides fragilis, Prevotella spp., and Clostridium difficile than was ciprofloxacin. Against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, BAY 12-8039 exhibited activity comparable to that of rifampin (MICs < or = 0.5 micrograms/ml). Against Chlamydia trachomatis and Chlamydia pneumoniae BAY 12-8039 was more active (MICs < or = 0.12 microgram/ml) than either ciprofloxacin or erythromycin and exhibited a greater lethal effect than either to these two agents. The protein binding of BAY 12-8039 was determined at 1 and 5 micrograms/ml as 30 and 26.4%, respectively. The presence of human serum (at 20 or 70%) had no marked effect on the in vitro activity of BAY 12-8039.
TI  - [Surgical treatment of sternoclavicular osteomyelitis].
AB  - Osteomyelitis of the sternocosto-clavicular (SCC) articulation is a rare infection usually caused by Staphylococcus aureus and enterobacteria. It usually occurs in individuals with osteoarticular disease or predisposing factors. Prolonged antibiotic treatment and articular puncture are generally accepted. Authors do not agree on an established protocol. We report three cases of SCC septic arthritis in two previously healthy patients with two foci of infection (one perianal abscess and one dental extraction) and in one adult patient with Still's disease. Pain and intense inflammation was referred to the shoulder, with scarce leukocytosis and fever reaching 38 degrees C. The germs responsible were S. aureus, Bacteroides fragilis and B. oralis. Two of the patients had local, regional abscesses. Long-term antibiotic treatment failed in all cases and surgery for SCC resection and myoplasty of the pectoralis major muscle was required. Recovery was good and shoulder and arm mobility was excellent. We propose medical treatment and articular diagnostic-therapeutic puncture as the first line of therapy for this disease. When evolution is poor or when complications appear, such as abscesses or mediastinitis, we conclude that radical debridement and myoplasty of the pectoralis major muscle are indicated.
TI  - Staphylococcus aureus nasal carriage in rheumatoid arthritis: antibody response to toxic shock syndrome toxin-1.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of Staphylococcus aureus nasal carriage and to compare antibody responses to two superantigens, staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1) and staphylococcal enterotoxin A (SEA), in rheumatoid arthritis patients and normal subjects. METHODS: 88 rheumatoid arthritis patients and 110 control subjects were cultured for nasal carriage of S aureus; 62 isolates were bacteriophage typed. Twenty five patients and 11 spouses were tested for antibodies to TSST-1, SEA, and sonicate extracts of Bacteroides fragilis and Escherichia coli; 19 patients were HLA-DR typed. RESULTS: 50% of patients and 33% of normal subjects were S aureus carriers. Bacteriophage typing of isolates suggested significant differences between strains isolated from the two groups. Patients showed higher IgG (P = 0.0025) and IgA (P = 0.0372) antibody levels to TSST-1 than normal spouses and these responses were not related to rheumatoid factor titres or HLA-DR type. CONCLUSION: When compared to normals, rheumatoid arthritis patients more often carry S aureus in their nasal vestibule, carry a distinct subpopulation of S aureus strains, and have higher average antibody levels to TSST-1.
TI  - In vitro activity of BAY 12-8039, a new 8-methoxyquinolone.
AB  - BAY 12-8039 is a new 8-methoxyquinolone with antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria which is significantly better than those of sparfloxacin or ciprofloxacin. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for 90% of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis were 0.062 and 2 mg/l, respectively. The MIC90s for ciprofloxacin-resistant, methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant S. aureus were 8 mg/l. Against the staphylococcal strains tested sparfloxacin was 2-fold and ciprofloxacin > or = 10-fold less active. MIC90s for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae were 0.125-0.5 mg/l, irrespective of whether strains with diminished ciprofloxacin susceptibility or ciprofloxacin-susceptible strains were tested. Against the streptococci sparfloxacin was 2- to 4-fold less active. Against gram-negative bacteria BAY 12-8039 is almost as active as ciprofloxacin, except for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Against Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides spp. and Clostridium spp. BAY 12-8039 was as active as metronidazole. The bactericidal activity against S. aureus and S. pneumoniae was in contrast to that of the other quinolones tested, penicillin G, amoxicillin+/-clavulanate, cefuroxime and clarithromycin, concentration-dependent. As compared to ciprofloxacin, development of resistance was less pronounced. The spontaneous mutation frequency towards BAY 12-8039 resistance was 2.8 x 10(-8) in Escherichia coli, 7.06 x 10(-8) in S. aureus and < 1.4 x 10(-9) in S. pneumoniae.
TI  - Bacteriology of necrotizing infections of soft tissues.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Necrotizing infections of soft tissues (NIST) are being attributed to a large variety of organisms, besides the originally described beta-haemolytic Streptococcus. A detailed bacteriological study of these infections was thought worthwhile. METHODS: A prospective study of 55 patients with NIST was carried out. Analysis of surface swabs and debrided tissue for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria and fungal infection was performed. A detailed bacteriological profile was obtained in 50 patients. RESULTS: A total of 257 isolates (167 aerobic, 90 anaerobic) was obtained. One to nine strains of bacteria were isolated from each patient. Aerobic bacteria alone were isolated in 26 patients while the remaining patients grew both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Forty-two patients had at least one Gram-positive bacterium while 40 had at least one Gram-negative bacterium. Staphylococcus aureus was the organism isolated most frequently (52%), followed by Bacteroides fragilis (40%) and anaerobic cocci (38%). Group A beta-haemolytic streptococci were isolated in 16%. Blood cultures were positive in only eight patients. Fungal cultures were positive in six patients. Aspergillus fumigatus was the commonest pathogen. CONCLUSIONS: Necrotizing infections of soft tissues are polymicrobial and no single bacterium is associated with a specific clinical entity. Importance should be placed on early recognition and treatment of the disease rather than on isolation of bacteria.
TI  - Microbiology of infected atopic dermatitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial infections occur frequently in lesions of atopic dermatitis (AD). The objectives of the study were to establish the aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of secondarily infected AD. METHODS: A retrospective review was carried out of clinical and microbiology laboratory records and of data obtained from patients with secondarily infected AD lesions, whose specimens of infected sites were processed for the presence of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. RESULTS: Bacterial growth was noted in 41 specimens. Aerobic or facultative anaerobic bacteria only were present in 15 patients (36%), anaerobic bacteria only in eight (20%), and mixed anaerobic-aerobic flora was present in 18 (44%). Seventy-two isolates were recovered (1.8 per specimen), 34 aerobic or facultative bacteria, 35 strict anaerobes, and three Candida sp. The predominant aerobic and facultative bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus (12 isolates), Group A beta hemolytic streptococcus in five isolates, and Escherichia coli in four. The predominant anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus spp. (13 isolates), pigmented Prevotella and Porphyromonas spp. in eight, and Fusobacterium spp. in four isolates. Single bacterial isolates were recovered in 14 patients (34%), seven of which were S. aureus. Twenty-one of the organisms isolated from 16 patients (39%) produced the enzyme beta-lactamase. Organisms that resided in the mucous membranes close to the lesions predominated in these infections. Enteric gram-negative rods and Bacteroides fragilis group predominated in lesions on legs and buttocks. Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci, pigmented Prevotella, and Porphyromonas and Fusobacterium spp. were most frequently recovered in lesions of the finger, scalp, face, and neck. CONCLUSIONS: The polymicrobial etiology of secondarily infected AD lesions and the association of bacterial flora with the anatomic site of the lesions are demonstrated.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of activities of nitazoxanide and tizoxanide against anaerobes and aerobic organisms.
AB  - The antibacterial activities of nitazoxanide and its main metabolite, tizoxanide, were tested against a broad range of bacteria, including anaerobes. Metronidazole, amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, piperacillin, cefoxitin, imipenem, and clindamycin were used as positive controls. MICs were determined by reference agar dilution methods. The 241 anaerobes were all inhibited by nitazoxanide, with the MICs at which 90% of isolates are inhibited (MIC90S) being between 0.06 and 4 mg/liter with the exception of those for Propionibacterium species, for which the MIC90 was 16 mg/liter. The MIC90s of nitazoxanide were 0.5 mg/liter for the Bacteroides fragilis group (80 strains), 0.06 mg/liter for Clostridium difficile (21 strains), and 0.5 mg/liter for Clostridium perfringens (16 strains). Metronidazole showed a level of activity comparable to that of nitazoxanide except against Bifidobacterium species, against which it was poorly active, and Propionibacterium species, which were resistant to metronidazole. The other antibiotics showed various levels of activity against anaerobes, with imipenem along with nitazoxanide being the most active agents tested. Tizoxanide was less effective than nitazoxanide except against the B. fragilis group, against which its activity was similar to that of nitazoxanide. Under aerobic conditions, nitazoxanide demonstrated poor activity against members of the family Enterobacteriacae and Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus, and Enterococcus species. The same results were obtained when culture was performed under anaerobic conditions with the notable exception of the results against Staphylococcus aureus. The MICs of nitazoxanide were in the range of 2 to 4 mg/liter for 34 clinical isolates of S. aureus, 12 of which were methicillin resistant, while tizoxanide was not effective.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and its susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents. Special references to bacteria isolated between July 1994 and June 1995].
AB  - Isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery during the period from July  1994 to June 1995 were investigated by a multicenter study in Japan, and the following results were obtained. One hundred and fifty-three strains were isolated from primary infections, and 143 strains were isolated from postoperative infections. From primary infections, both anaerobic Gram-positive and-negative bacteria were predominant, and from postoperative infections, aerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant. Among aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Enterococcus faecalis was highest, followed by that of Staphylococcus aureus from both types of infections. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Streptococcus intermedius was highest from primary infections, but from postoperative infections anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria was uncommon. Among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in this order. From postoperative infections, P. aeruginosa was most predominantly isolated, followed by Serratia marcescens and E. coli. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of Bacteroides fragilis group was the highest from both types of infections. We have noticed that resistant strains against imipenem and ofloxacin were increasing among P. aeruginosa and resistant strains against cefazolin were increasing among E. coli. MICs of cefazolin against four out of 30 strains of E. coli were higher than 100 micrograms/ml, and MICs of imipenem was higher than 50 micrograms/ml against 5 out of 22 strains of P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Penetration of cefpodoxime into uterine and vaginal secretions from postpartum women after a single oral dose of cefpodoxime proxetil.
AB  - We evaluated the usefulness of cefpodoxime proxetil (CPDX-PR) in the treatment of puerperal infection and obtained the following results. (i) The susceptibilities of 124 clinical isolates from 85 uterine lochia samples were determined. The MIC at which the growth of Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, and Bacteroides fragilis isolates was inhibited by 90% (MIC90) was 0.39 micrograms/ml or less. The MIC90 for Staphylococcus aureus was 3.13 micrograms/ml. (ii) Seven puerperal women received 200 mg of CPDX-PR orally. The CPDX concentration in the lochias in the uterine cavity was not statistically different from that in the vagina, suggesting that the vaginal samples, which can be obtained more safely and aseptically, can be substituted for the uterine samples. The CPDX concentration in cubital venous blood reached a peak of 1.61 micrograms/ml at 3 hours after CPDX-PR administration. The CPDX concentration in the lochias gradually increased and reached a peak of 1.20 micrograms/ml in the uterine cavity and 1.27 micrograms/ml in the vagina at 5 h after drug administration and gradually declined thereafter. These results suggest that CPDX-PR, with its good transfer to the lochia and its potent antimicrobial activity, is a promising drug for the prophylactic and therapeutic treatment of puerperal infections caused by susceptible organisms.
TI  - In vivo activities of U-100592 and U-100766, novel oxazolidinone antimicrobial agents, against experimental bacterial infections.
AB  - The Upjohn oxazolidinones, U-100592 and U-100766, are orally bioavailable synthetic antimicrobial agents with spectra of activity against antibiotic-susceptible and -resistant gram-positive pathogens. In several mouse models of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection, U-100592 and U-100766 yielded oral 50% effective doses (ED50) ranging from 1.9 to 8.0 mg/kg of body weight, which compared favorably with vancomycin subcutaneous ED50 values of 1.1 to 4.4 mg/kg. Similarly, both compounds were active versus a Staphylococcus epidermidis experimental systemic infection. U-100592 and U-100766 effectively cured an Enterococcus faecalis systemic infection, with ED50 values of 1.3 and 10.0 mg/kg, and versus a vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium infection in immunocompromised mice, both drugs effected cures at 12.5 and 24.0 mg/kg. Both compounds were exceptionally active in vivo against penicillin- and cephalosporin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, with ED50 values ranging from 1.2 to 11.7 mg/kg in systemic infection models. In soft tissue infection models with S. aureus and E. faecalis, both compounds exhibited acceptable curative activities in the range of 11.0 to 39.0 mg/kg. U-100766 was also very active versus the Bacteroides fragilis soft tissue infection model (ED50 = 46.3 mg/kg). In combination-therapy studies, both U-100592 and U-100766 were indifferent or additive in vivo against a monomicrobic S. aureus infection in combination with other antibiotics active against gram-positive bacteria and combined as readily as vancomycin with gentamicin in the treatment of a polymicrobic S. aureus-Escherichia coli infection. U-100592 and U-100766 are potent oxazolidinones active against antibiotic-susceptible and -resistant gram-positive pathogens in experimental systemic and soft tissue infections.
TI  - Detection of bacteria in equine synovial fluid by use of the polymerase chain reaction.
AB  - Equine synovial fluid aliquots were inoculated with Salmonella enteritidis, Escherichia coli, Actinobacillus equuli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus zooepidemicus to obtain approximate concentrations of 1000, 100, 10, and 1 colony forming U/mL. Synovial fluid aliquots were also inoculated with an unquantitated inoculum of Bacteroides fragilis and Clostridium perfringens. Inoculated synovial fluid was incubated in trypticase-soy broth or Columbia broth for approximately 12 hours. Then aliquots were removed for DNA extraction and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis for detection of a 531 base-pair segment of bacterial DNA corresponding to a region of the 16S ribosomal gene. Duplicate samples of inoculated synovial fluid were prepared for microbial culture. Bacteria were detected in all samples inoculated with bacteria but not in control synovial fluid samples. Under experimental conditions there was no difference between microbial culture and PCR analyses for detection of bacteria. Experimentally, PCR was able to detect bacteria in synovial fluid within 24 hours of inoculation.
TI  - In vitro activity of the tricyclic beta-lactam GV104326.
AB  - GV104326 is a novel tricyclic beta-lactam (a trinem or, formerly, tribactam). The in vitro activity of GV104326 was compared with those of cefuroxime, cefixime, amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cefpirome, and ciprofloxacin. GV104326 had in vitro activity generally similar to that of cefixime against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae (MIC at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited [MIC90], < or = 2 micrograms/ml), with cefuroxime and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid being 8- to 32-fold less active and with cefpirome being 4- to 8-fold more active against members of this family. The trinem had no activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (MIC90, > 128 micrograms/ml) but was the most active agent against Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. GV104326 was particularly active against gram-positive cocci. Ninety percent of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus strains were susceptible to 0.03 microgram of GV104326 per ml, making it the most active agent studied. Enterococci and Lancefield group A and B streptococci were generally equally or somewhat more susceptible to GV104326 than they were to amoxicillin. Streptococcus pneumoniae strains were highly susceptible to GV104326, and those strains which showed decreased susceptibility to penicillin were generally twofold more susceptible to the trinem than to amoxicillin. Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis were highly susceptible to GV104326 (MIC90s, 0.12 and 0.03 microgram/ml, respectively). The anaerobes Clostridium perfringens, Bacteroides fragilis, and Peptostreptococcus spp. were more susceptible to the trinems (formerly tribactams) than to the other agents studied.
TI  - In vitro activities of U-100592 and U-100766, novel oxazolidinone antibacterial agents.
AB  - Oxazolidinones make up a relatively new class of antimicrobial agents which possess a unique mechanism of bacterial protein synthesis inhibition. U-100592 (S)-N-[[3-[3-fluoro-4-[4-(hydroxyacetyl)-1-piperazinyl]- phenyl]-2-oxo-5-oxazolidinyl]methyl]-acetamide and U-100766 (S)-N-[[3-[3-fluoro-4-(4-morpholinyl)phenyl]- 2-oxo-5-oxazolidinyl]methyl]-acetamide are novel oxazolidinone analogs from a directed chemical modification program. MICs were determined for a variety of bacterial clinical isolates; the respective MICs of U-100592 and U-100766 at which 90% of isolates are inhibited were as follows: methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, 4 and 4 micrograms/ml; methicillin-resistant S. aureus, 4 and 4 micrograms/ml; methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus epidermidis, 2 and 2 micrograms/ml; methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis, 1 and 2 micrograms/ml; Enterococcus faecalis, 2 and 4 micrograms/ml; Enterococcus faecium, 2 and 4 micrograms/ml; Streptococcus pyogenes, 1 and 2 micrograms/ml; Streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.50 and 1 microgram/ml; Corynebacterium spp., 0.50 and 0.50 micrograms/ml; Moraxella catarrhalis, 4 and 4 micrograms/ml; Listeria monocytogenes, 8 and 2 micrograms/ml; and Bacteroides fragilis, 16 and 4 micrograms/ml. Most strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and the gram-positive anaerobes were inhibited in the range of 0.50 to 2 micrograms/ml. Enterococcal strains resistant to vancomycin (VanA, VanB, and VanC resistance phenotypes), pneumococcal strains resistant to penicillin, and M. tuberculosis strains resistant to common antitubercular agents (isoniazid, streptomycin, rifampin, ethionamide, and ethambutol) were not cross-resistant to the oxazolidinones. The presence of 10, 20, and 40% pooled human serum did not affect the antibacterial activities of the oxazolidinones. Time-kill studies demonstrated a bacteriostatic effect of the analogs against staphylococci and enterococci but a bactericidal effect against streptococci. The spontaneous mutation frequencies of S. aureus ATCC 29213 were <3.8 x 10(-10) and <8 x 10(-11) for U-100592 and U-100766, respectively. Serial transfer of three staphylococcal and two enterococcal strains on drug gradient plates produced no evidence of rapid resistance development. Thus, these new oxazolidinone analogs demonstrated in vitro antibacterial activities against a variety of clinically important human pathogens.
TI  - [In vitro and in vivo activities of sulopenem compared with those of imipenem and cephalosporins].
AB  - The in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of sulopenem (CP-70,429),a new  parenteral penem antibiotic, were compared with those of imipenem (IPM), flomoxef, cefuzonam (CZON) and cefotaxime. Sulopenem possessed broad-spectrum activities against Gram-positive bacteria and Gram-negative bacteria. Antibacterial activities of sulopenem against methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae were equivalent to or somewhat superior to those of IPM. Against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, sulopenem was 4- to 260-fold more active than reference antibiotics with broad-spectra. In a killing kinetics study for Haemophilus influenzae, sulopenem showed a 99.9% decrease of viable cells after 8 hours at a concentration of 0.20 micrograms/ml. This effect was obtained at a concentration 8-fold lower than that of IPM. The protective effects of sulopenem in murine experimental systemic infections were superior to those of imipenem/cilastatin. In murine experimental mixed infection with Escherichia coli and Bacteroides fragilis, sulopenem had lower ED50, in other words stronger antimicrobial activities than IPM. The therapeutic effect of sulopenem are related well with its MIC value. In guinea pigs experimental lung infection with Klebsiella pneumoniae, sulopenem was more effective than CZON or cefotiam.
TI  - Bacteriology and beta-lactamase activity in acute and chronic maxillary sinusitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the bacteriology and beta-lactamase enzyme activity in aspirates of 10 acutely and 13 chronically inflamed maxillary sinuses. RESULTS: The predominant organisms isolated in acute sinusitis were Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis, and those found in chronic sinusitis were Prevotella species, Fusobacterium species, and Peptostreptococcus species. Four beta-lactamase-producing organisms (BLPOs) were isolated in four specimens (40%) obtained from acutely inflamed sinuses, and 14 BLPOs were recovered from 10 chronically inflamed sinuses (77%). The predominant BLPOs in acute sinusitis were H influenzae, and M catarrhalis; those in chronic sinusitis were Staphylococcus aureus, Prevotella species, Fusobacterium species, and Bacteroides fragilis. CONCLUSIONS: Beta-lactamase activity was detected in 12 (three in acute and nine in chronic sinusitis) of the 14 aspirates that contained BLPOs. The detection of beta-lactamase activity in sinus aspirates provides support for the role of BLPOs in the failure of penicillin therapy in sinusitis.
TI  - Enhancement of growth of group A beta-hemolytic streptococci in mixed infections  with aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the potential for mutual enhancement of growth of group A  beta-hemolytic streptococci (GABHS), and 11 commonly associated aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms frequently isolated in tonsillar infections. METHODS: Enhancement was assessed by measuring the relative increase in colony-forming units (CFU) of GABHS and each of the 11 microorganisms inducing a subcutaneous abscess in mice. RESULTS: Of the 11 combinations of GABHS and aerobe or anaerobe, GABHS was enhanced in 10 cases and the other microorganism in 5, namely, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae type b, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Prevotella melaninogenica and Bacteroides fragilis. CONCLUSIONS: These findings confirm the mutual symbiotic enhancement of growth of GABHS in the presence of other aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.
TI  - Bactericidal activity, morphological alterations, and synergistic interactions of rufloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, alone and in combination with its N-desmethylate D derivative (MF 922).
AB  - The in vitro activity of rufloxacin, alone and in combination with its metabolite (MF 922) against common respiratory and urinary tract pathogens and anaerobes was assessed. No synergistic interaction between rufloxacin and MF 922 was observed by the checkerboard technique against aerobic bacteria. When the time-kill system was employed, 24 synergistic interactions were noted out of 30 tests performed (80%), of which 14 (100%) were with Enterobacteriaceae isolates, 2 with Moraxella catarrhalis (50%), 4 with Haemophilus influenzae (100%), 2 with Staphylococcus aureus (50%) and 2 with Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes (50%). Synergism was found with all Bacteroides fragilis irrespectively of the method used. Rufloxacin alone or in combination with MF 922, at concentrations achieved in vivo, induced morphological alterations in all the pathogens analyzed with the exception of M. catarrhalis and H. influenzae. Towards S. pyogenes and S. pneumoniae, the same levels of rufloxacin and MF 922 were capable of inducing only bacteriostatic rather than bactericidal effect, followed by reversible morphological modifications. The presence of 50% human serum in the test media did not affect the results.
TI  - Microbiology of mediastinitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the microbiologic and clinical characteristics of patients with mediastinitis. METHODS: Retrospective review of clinical and laboratory data of 17 patients treated between 1980 and 1987. RESULTS: Aerobic or facultative bacteria only were present in three patients (18%), anaerobic bacteria only in seven (41%), and mixed aerobic-anaerobic flora in seven (41%). In total, there were 42 isolates, 13 aerobic or facultative and 29 anaerobic bacteria, an average of 2.5 per specimen. Anaerobic bacteria predominated in infections that originated from esophageal perforation and orofacial, odontogenic, and gunshot sources. The predominant aerobes were alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus (three isolates), Staphylococcus aureus (two isolates), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (two isolates). The predominant anaerobes were Prevotella and Porphyromonas species (eight isolates), Peptostreptococcus species (seven isolates), and Bacteroides fragilis group (three isolates). CONCLUSION: These data highlight the polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic nature of mediastinitis.
TI  - Bacteroides fragilis pyomyositis in a patient with multiple myeloma.
AB  - Pyomyositis is a bacterial infection with abscess formation affecting large skeletal muscles. It is predominantly caused by Staphylococcus aureus. The disease is common in tropical areas, but rare in temperate climates. We report a patient with multiple myeloma who developed a giant elastic tumor on the right thigh and a hen egg-sized tumor on the right upper arm. MR imaging revealed cystic spaces in the femoral quadriceps and brachial biceps muscles. A large amount of pus with foul smell was removed by incision, drainage and aspiration of the two tumors. The lesions were successfully treated with intravenous administration of antibiotics. Repeated bacterial cultures yielded only Bacteroids fragilis. To our knowledge, this is the first report of pyomyositis due to Bacteroides fragilis.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin. Rationale for clinical use.
AB  - Most Gram-positive organisms are highly susceptible to the streptogramin, quinupristin/dalfopristin (RP 59500; Synercid). Minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of isolates (MIC90) were < or = 1 mg/L for Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, S. haemolyticus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes and Listeria monocytogenes. Importantly, quinupristin/dalfopristin shows similar activity against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains of S. aureus, and streptococci with benzylpenicillin (penicillin G)- or erythromycin-acquired resistance. Enterococci have varying susceptibility to quinupristin /dalfopristin, although most isolates tested are susceptible to the drug, including vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant Enterococcus faecium. E. faecalis are generally the least susceptible. Among the Gram-negative respiratory pathogens Moraxella catarrhalis is susceptible and Haemophilus influenzae is moderately susceptible to quinupristin/ dalfopristin; however, Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. are resistant. The drug is active against anaerobic organisms tested, including Clostridium perfringens, Lactobacillus spp., Bacteroides fragilis and Peptostreptococcus. Synergy has been demonstrated in vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant E. faecium, and methicillin-sensitive and -resistant S. aureus with the combination of vancomycin and quinupristin/ dalfopristin. Quinupristin/dalfopristin shows antibacterial activity in vivo in animal models of infection, including methicillin-sensitive and -resistant S. aureus infection in rabbits, S. aureus and S. pneumoniae in mice, and erythromycin-sensitive and -resistant viridans group streptococci infections in rats. The drug is rapidly bactericidal against Gram-positive organisms (with the exception of enterococci) at concentrations similar to or within 4-fold of the MIC, and it has a long postantibiotic effect both in vitro and in vivo.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of superficial suppurative thrombophlebitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the aerobic and anaerobic microbiologic characteristics of superficial suppurative thrombophlebitis. DESIGN: Retrospective review of microbiologic and clinical data. SETTING: Navy Hospital in Bethesda, Md. RESULTS: Sixty-one isolates, 36 aerobic and 25 anaerobic, were isolated from samples obtained from 42 patients. Aerobic bacteria only were found in 26 (62%) patients; anaerobic only, in 11 (26%); and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, in five (12%). The predominant aerobic bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus (n = 9), Escherichia coli (n = 7), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 4), and Klebsiella sp (n = 3). The most frequently recovered anaerobic bacteria were Peptostreptococcus sp (n = 8), Propionibacterium acnes (n = 6), Bacteroides fragilis group (n = 5), Prevotella intermedia (n = 3), and Fusobacterium nucleatum (n = 3). Propionibacterium acnes and Peptostreptococcus sp were associated with cannula-related superficial suppurative thrombophlebitis; B fragilis and Enterobacteriaceae, with abdominal surgery or pathology; and S aureus and P aeruginosa and Citrobacter sp, with burns. CONCLUSION: These data illustrate the importance of anaerobic bacteria in superficial suppurative thrombophlebitis.
TI  - Spinal epidural abscess in hemodialysis patients: report of three cases and review of the literature.
AB  - Spinal epidural abscess (SEA) is a rare infection that can evolve to severe permanent neurologic deficit or death if the diagnosis is delayed. We report three cases of SEA in hemodialysis patients and summarize nine previously reported cases occurring in hemodialysis patients, with detailed comparisons to series of SEA from the general medical literature. Among these 12 patients, hemodialysis catheters and arteriovenous grafts were the major source of infection, in contrast to the usual skin source. Staphylococcus aureus was implicated in all cases, but in one patient Bacteroides fragilis also was isolated from both the resected arteriovenous fistula and the SEA, and Escherichia coli was isolated from the arteriovenous fistula. The classic syndrome of SEA includes fever, backache, and local spinal tenderness, followed by progressive radicular and cord compression signs and symptoms. In this series, back pain and radicular pain were common at presentation, but only a minority had fever, back tenderness, weakness, or leukocytosis. Cerebrospinal fluid was typically abnormal but culture negative, whereas blood and epidural abscess cultures were frequently positive. Plain x-ray films, bone scans, and plain computed tomography scans had low diagnostic yield, and magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium had a sensitivity of 80%. Only myelography or computed tomography-myelography gave consistently correct diagnoses. The clinical outcome was poor, with one patient deceased and seven with severe weakness or paralysis. Early intervention provided a higher likelihood of good outcome, whereas late intervention and preoperative neurologic deficits portended a poor functional result. Because of the high incidence of bacteremia in hemodialysis patients, we recommend that symptoms of fever, backache, and spinal tenderness be promptly evaluated for SEA before signs or symptoms of cord compression develop. Early recognition and treatment with antibiotics and decompressive laminectomy is generally associated with a better outcome.
TI  - Macrolides resistance of common bacteria isolated from Taiwan.
AB  - To determine the susceptibility to macrolides of common pathogenic bacteria isolated from Taiwan, the in vitro activities of erythromycin, roxithromycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, and dirithromycin were tested against 492 clinical isolates of eight different bacteria, collected from the National Taiwan University Hospital. The results showed high minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) against most of the tested bacteria. The MIC90s for Staphylococcus aureus (both methicillin-resistant and -sensitive strains), coagulase-negative staphylococci (both methicillin-resistant and -sensitive strains), Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococci, peptostreptococci, and Bacteroides fragilis were all > or = 256 micrograms/ml. The MIC50s for methicillin-resistant strains of S. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci, and enterococci were > or = 256 micrograms/ml. For S. pneumoniae, peptostreptococci, and B. fragilis, the MIC50s were > 8 micrograms/ml. The resistance rates to macrolides were 80% or more in methicillin-resistant staphylococci and about 30% in methicillin-sensitive staphylococci. Around 55% of S. pneumoniae strains and 37 approximately 42% of S. pyogenes strains were resistant to macrolides. Cross-resistance to different macrolides was clearly demonstrated in most of the resistant strains.
TI  - In vivo efficacy of trovafloxacin (CP-99,219), a new quinolone with extended activities against gram-positive pathogens, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Bacteroides fragilis.
AB  - The interesting in vitro antimicrobial activity and pharmacokinetics of the new quinolone trovafloxacin (CP-99,219) warranted further studies to determine its in vivo efficacy in models of infectious disease. The significance of the pharmacokinetic and in vitro antimicrobial profiles of trovafloxacin was shown through efficacy in a series of animal infection models by employing primarily oral therapy. Against acute infections, trovafloxacin was consistently more effective than temafloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and ofloxacin against Streptococcus pneumoniae and other gram-positive pathogens while maintaining activity comparable to that of ciprofloxacin against gram-negative organisms. In a model of murine pneumonia, trovafloxacin was more efficacious than temafloxacin, while ciprofloxacin failed against S. pneumoniae (50% protective doses, 2.1, 29.5, and >100 mg/kg, respectively). In addition to its inherent in vitro potency advantage against S. pneumoniae, these data were supported by a pharmacokinetic study that showed levels of trovafloxacin in pulmonary tissue of S. pneumoniae-infected CF1 mice to be considerably greater than those of temafloxacin and ciprofloxacin (twice the maximum drug concentration in serum; two to three times the half-life, and three to six times the area under the concentration-time curve). Against localized mixed anaerobic infections, trovafloxacin was the only agent to effectively reduce the numbers of recoverable CFU of Bacteroides fragilis ( >1,000-fold), Staphylococcus aureus (1,000-fold), and Escherichia coli ( >100-fold) compared with ciprofloxacin, vancomycin, metronidazole, clindamycin, cefoxitin, and ceftriaxone. The in vitro and in vivo antimicrobial activities of trovafloxacin and its pharmacokinetics in laboratory animals provide support for the ongoing and planned human phase II and III clinical trials.
TI  - Activation of human endothelial cells by viable or heat-killed gram-negative bacteria requires soluble CD14.
AB  - In response to bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS; endotoxin), endothelial cells  are converted to an activation phenotype expressing both proinflammatory and procoagulant properties that include the induction of leukocyte adhesion molecules and tissue factor expression. LPS-induced endothelial cell activation requires a soluble form of the monocyte LPS receptor, sCD14. We evaluated the capacity of multiple strains of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria to induce endothelial E-selectin and tissue factor expression through sCD14-dependent pathways with cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVE). Both viable and heat-killed gram-negative bacteria (Bacteroides fragilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Klebsiella pneumoniae) but not viable or heat-killed gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae) induced prominent E-selectin surface expression detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Tissue factor activity on HUVE, indicated by factor X activation, was induced in response to gram-negative bacteria but not in response to gram-positive bacteria. Gram-negative bacteria induced transcriptional activation in HUVE, indicated by the appearance of E-selectin-specific mRNA and by the demonstration of activation of NF-kappa B, a trans-activating factor necessary for E-selectin and tissue factor gene transcription. In contrast, neither E-selectin mRNA nor activation of NF-kappa B was detected in HUVE treated with gram-positive bacteria. Endothelial cell activation by gram-negative bacteria in each of these assays was inhibited with a monoclonal antibody (60bd) against CD14. Furthermore, CHO-K1 cells, transfected with human recombinant CD14, responded to all strains of gram-negative bacteria (viable or heat killed), indicated by CHO-K1 NF-kappa B activation. We conclude that gram-negative bacteria induce endothelial cell activation through a common sCD14-dependent pathway.
TI  - Microbiology of gastrostomy site wound infections in children.
AB  - Specimens of pus were obtained from gastrostomy site wound infections in 22 children. Polymicrobial flora was found in 21 of the 22 wounds. Aerobic or facultative bacteria only were isolated in eight (36%) instances and mixed aerobic-anaerobic flora were isolated from the other 14 (64%) wounds. A total of 102 bacterial isolates (57 aerobic and 45 anaerobic) and seven cultures of candida were obtained. The most frequent isolates were Escherichia coli (16 isolates). Peptostreptococcus spp. (14), Enterococcus spp. (14), Bacteroides spp. (12) and Staphylococcus aureus (6). Twenty-eight strains producing beta-lactamase were isolated from 16 (73%) patients. The presence of polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic infection, and the isolation of E. coli and Bacteroides spp. were more frequent in wounds with gastric leakage than in wounds without gastric leakage (p < 0.05). Bacteria similar to those isolated from the wound were also isolated from blood cultures from three patients-two isolates of E. coli and one each of B. fragilis and S. aureus. All patients received local therapy and 11 were treated with systemic antimicrobial agents. The polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic flora of gastrostomy site wound infections, especially in association with gastric leakage, and the presence of beta-lactamase producers in most of these infections may have important implications for their management.
TI  - Clinical and microbiological features of necrotizing fasciitis.
AB  - The microbiological and clinical characteristics of 83 patients with necrotizing  fasciitis (NF) treated over a period of 17 years are presented. Bacterial growth was noted in 81 of 83 (98%) of specimens from patients with NF. Aerobic or facultative bacteria only were recovered in 8 (10%) specimens, anaerobic bacteria only were recovered in 18 (22%) specimens, and mixed-aerobic-anaerobic floras were recovered in 55 (68%) specimens. In total, there were 375 isolates, 105 aerobic or facultative bacteria and 270 anaerobic bacteria, for an average of 4.6 isolates per specimen. The recovery of certain bacteria from different anatomical locations correlated with their distribution in the normal flora adjacent to the infected site. Anaerobic bacteria outnumbered aerobic bacteria at all body sites, but the highest recovery rate of anaerobes was in the buttocks, trunk, neck, external genitalia, and inguinal areas. The predominant aerobes were Staphylococcus aureus (n = 14 isolates), Escherichia coli (n = 12), and group A streptococci (n = 8). The predominant anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus spp. (n = 101), Prevotella and Porphyromonas spp. (n = 40), Bacteroides fragilis group (n = 36), and Clostridium spp. (n = 23). Certain clinical findings correlated with some bacteria: edema with B. fragilis group, Clostridium spp., S. aureus, Prevotella spp. and group A streptococci; gas and crepitation in tissues with members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and Clostridium spp.; and foul odor with Bacteroides spp. Certain predisposing conditions correlated with some organisms: trauma with Clostridium spp.; diabetes with Bacteroides spp., members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, and S. aureus; and immunosuppression and malignancy with Pseudomonas spp. and members of the family Enterobacteriaceae. These data highlight the polymicrobial nature of NF.
TI  - Antibacterial effects of some root end filling materials.
AB  - In addition to having good sealing ability, root end filling materials should "ideally" have some antibacterial activity to prevent bacterial growth. This investigation compared the antibacterial effects of amalgam, zinc oxide-eugenol, Super EBA and a mineral trioxide aggregate on nine facultative bacteria Streptococcus fecalis, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, Lactobacillus species, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacillus subtilis, and Escherichia coli B and seven strict anaerobic bacteria, Prevotella (Bacteroides) buccae, Bacteroides fragilis, Prevotella (Bacteroides) intermedia, Prevotella (Bacteroides) melaninogenica, Fusobacterium necrophorum, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius. After growing these bacteria on solid media, freshly mixed and 24-h set test materials were placed on the surface of these inoculated media and incubated in the appropriate atmosphere for 24 to 48 h at 37 degrees C. Impregnated discs with the Super EBA liquid were used as positive controls. The antibacterial effects of each material were measured in millimeters and the data were analyzed using one-way and two-way analysis of variance and Scheffe tests to determine the statistical differences between the antibacterial effects of the test materials. Impregnated discs with Super EBA liquid caused varying degrees of growth inhibition for both facultative and strict anaerobic bacteria. Both types of amalgam had no antibacterial effect against any of the bacteria tested in this study. Mineral trioxide aggregate had an antibacterial effect on some of the facultative bacteria and no effect on any of the strict anaerobic bacteria. Zinc oxide-eugenol and Super EBA pastes had some antibacterial effects on both types of bacteria tested.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Antibiotic GE37468 A: a new inhibitor of bacterial protein synthesis. I. Isolation and characterization.
AB  - GE37468 A is a new thiazolyl peptide antibiotic obtained by fermentation of Streptomyces sp. strain ATCC 55365. It inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by acting on elongation factor Tu and is structurally and functionally related to the GE2270 class of EF-Tu inhibitors. It is active in vitro against Gram-positive bacteria and Bacteroides fragilis, and protects mice against Staphylococcus aureus infection.
TI  - Microbiology of secondary bacterial infection in scabies lesions.
AB  - Aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were grown from specimens obtained from 30 children with secondarily infected scabies lesions. Aerobic or facultative bacteria only were present in 14 (47%) patients, anaerobic bacteria only were present in 6 (20%) patients, and a mixed anaerobic-aerobic flora was present in 10 (33%) patients. Fifty isolates were recovered (1.7 per specimen); 27 were aerobic or facultative bacteria and 23 were strict anaerobes. The predominant aerobic and facultative bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus (nine isolates), group A streptococci (five isolates), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (three isolates). The predominant anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus sp. (nine isolates) and pigmented Prevotella and Porphyromonas spp. (four isolates). Single bacterial isolates were recovered from nine (30%) patients; five of these were S. aureus. Sixteen organisms isolated from 12 (40%) patients produced the enzyme beta-lactamase. Organisms that resided in the mucous membranes close to or in contact with the lesions predominated in those infections. Enteric gram-negative rods were recovered in leg and trunk lesions. Group A streptococci and S. aureus predominated in finger and hand lesions. Bacteroides fragilis group and Clostridium sp. were isolated from leg lesions, and pigmented Prevotella sp. and Porphyromonas and Fusobacterium spp. were recovered from finger lesions. The polymicrobial etiology of secondarily infected scabies lesions in children and the association of bacterial flora with the anatomical sites of the lesions are demonstrated.
TI  - In vitro activity of WY-49605, a penem antimicrobial.
AB  - The in vitro activity of the penem antimicrobial WY-49605 was compared with those of other agents available for oral administration. Based on concentrations inhibiting 90% of isolates (MIC(90)s), the penem inhibited methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (MIC(90) = 0.25 microg/ml), penicillin-susceptible streptococci (MIC(90) < or = 0.12 microg/ml) and several other Gram-positive genera at concentrations comparable or superior to the most active comparison agents. WY-49605 and cefpodoxime were the most active agents against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae. Most strains of Enterococcus faecalis and Bacteroides fragilis were susceptible to the new agent at concentrations < or =4microg/ml, while Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecium, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus were resistant to all agents tested.
TI  - Clinical features and aerobic and anaerobic microbiological characteristics of cellulitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the aerobic and anaerobic microbiological characteristics of cellulitis and correlate them with the infection site. DESIGN: Of 342 specimens, 64 obtained using needle aspiration and 278 using swabs were studied over 10 years. RESULTS: Bacterial growth was noted in 15 (23%) of the 64 needle aspirates and 259 (93%) of the 278 swab aspirates. The microbial results of the 15 specimens obtained through needle aspiration are separately presented. Aerobic or facultative bacteria only were present in 138 (53%) of swab samples, anaerobic bacteria only in 69 (27%), and mixed aerobic-anaerobic flora in 52 (20%). In total, there were 582 isolates, 247 aerobic or facultative and 335 anaerobic bacteria, with an average of 2.2 isolates per specimen. The predominance of certain isolates in different anatomical sites correlated with their distribution in the normal flora adjacent to the infected site. The highest recovery rates of anaerobes was from the neck, trunk, groin, external genitalia, and leg areas. Aerobes outnumbered anaerobes in the arm and hand. The predominant aerobes were Staphylococcus aureus, group A streptococci, and Escherichia coli. The predominant anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus sp, Bacteroides fragilis group, Prevotella and Porphyromonas sp, and Clostridium sp. Certain clinical findings correlated with the following organisms: swelling and tenderness with Clostridium sp, Prevotella sp, S aureus, and group A streptococci; regional adenopathy with B fragilis group; bulbous lesions with Enterobacteriaceae; gangrene and necrosis with Peptostreptococcus sp, B fragilis group, Clostridium sp, and Enterobacteriaceae; foul odor with Bacteroides sp; and gas in tissues with Peptostreptococcus sp, B fragilis group and Clostridium sp. Certain predisposing conditions correlated with the following organisms: trauma with Clostridium sp; diabetes with Bacteroides sp, Enterobacteriaceae, and S aureus; and burn with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. CONCLUSION: These data highlight the polymicrobial nature of cellulitis.
TI  - Multicenter clinical laboratory evaluation of a beta-lactamase disk assay employing a novel chromogenic cephalosporin, S1.
AB  - S1, a new chromogenic cephalosporin (International BioClinical, Inc., Portland, Oreg.), was used to detect beta-lactamase production among a variety of commonly encountered bacteria in a four-center collaborative study. Results of an S1 disk assay were compared with those obtained by a nitrocefin-based disk procedure (Cefinase; Becton-Dickinson Microbiology Systems, Cockeysville, Md.), with repetitive testing of five quality control organisms and with individual tests of recent clinical isolates of Neisseria gonorrhoeae (162 strains), Haemophilus influenzae (162 strains), Moraxella catarrhalis (155 strains), Staphylococcus aureus (161 strains), and Bacteroides fragilis (164 strains). The performances of the two beta-lactamase disk assays were comparable for the first three species cited above. However, the S1 assay appeared to be a more sensitive procedure than the Cefinase assay when applied to S. aureus and B. fragilis, with respect to both total numbers of positive results and length of time to a definitive positive endpoint.
TI  - The in-vitro activity of CP 99,219, a new naphthyridone antimicrobial agent: a comparison with fluoroquinolone agents.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of a new fluoroquinolone, CP 99,219 was compared with that  of ciprofloxacin, DU 6859, sparfloxacin and levofloxacin. CP 99,219 showed generally similar in-vitro activity to the other compounds tested against the Enterobacteriaceae (MIC90 of all agents < 0.5 mg/L except Morganella morganii). It was found to be more active than ciprofloxacin, sparfloxacin and levofloxacin against the strains of Acinetobacter calcoaceticus tested (MIC90 1 mg/L). CP 99,219 was found to be four-fold more active against strains of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia than ciprofloxacin (MIC90 1 and 8 mg/L, respectively). Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria spp. were highly susceptible to all the agents tested. CP 99,219 was more active than ciprofloxacin, sparfloxacin and levofloxacin against Gram-positive organisms, but less active than DU 6859. The enhanced anti-Gram-positive activity of CP 99,219 was most marked against the nine strains of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus tested. The MIC90 of CP 99,219 of these strains was 1.0 mg/L compared with 64 mg/L for ciprofloxacin. Against Bacteroides fragilis, CP 99,219 (MIC90 0.25 mg/L) and DU 6859 (MIC90 0.03 mg/L) were more active than the other quinolones. Chlamydia spp. were susceptible to < or = 0.12 mg/L of CP 99,219. Mycobacterial strains tested were less susceptible to CP 99,219 than to ciprofloxacin. The protein binding of CP 99,219 was 87.9% at 1 mg/L.
TI  - A retrospective review of cases of anaerobic empyema and update of bacteriology.
AB  - We conducted a retrospective study to update the bacteriology of 46 cases of anaerobic empyema that were originally studied between 1976 and 1993 at the Wadsworth Anaerobic Bacteriology Clinical Research Laboratory (Los Angeles). Anaerobic bacteriologic studies were completed for all 46 pleural fluid specimens, and aerobic bacteriologic studies were completed for 41 of these specimens. Thirty-seven clinical charts were available for review. A total of 161 anaerobic isolates (3.5 per patient) representing 64 species or groups were recovered. The most common isolates were as follows: Fusobacterium nucleatum (19); Prevotella oris-buccae group (13, 9 of which were P. oris); Bacteroides fragilis group (11, 4 of which were B. fragilis); pigmented Prevotella species (17, 8 of which were in the Prevotella intermedia-nigrescens group); Peptostreptococcus species (17, 9 of which were Peptostreptococcus micros); Eubacterium species (7); Lactobacillus species (8); Actinomyces species (7); and Clostridium species (7). Nineteen if the cases were of purely anaerobic etiology; of these, eight were caused by a single organism: F. nucleatum (five cases); B. fragilis (two cases); and Prevotella mangus (one case). Of the 45 aerobic isolates (1.1 per patient), viridans streptococci were most common (21 isolates), followed by group D nonenterococcal streptococcus (four isolates). Only nine gram-negative rods (six enteric and three nonenteric organisms) and one Staphylococcus aureus isolate were recovered. The susceptibility to penicillin of 64 isolates was examined with the use of the spiral gradient method; 21 (33%) of these isolates were beta-lactamase positive (MICs ranged from 1.1 to > or = 54 micrograms/mL vs < or = 0.27 micrograms/mL for beta-lactamase-negative strains).
TI  - Postmortem drug metabolism by bacteria.
AB  - Studies were undertaken to determine the possible role of enteric bacteria in the postmortem bioconversion of the nitrobenzodiazepines flunitrazepam, clonazepam, and nitrazepam. Flunitrazepam, clonazepam, and nitrazepam were completely metabolized in blood in the presence of eight species of enteric bacteria to their respective 7-amino-metabolites. The rates of metabolism, at 37 degrees C, ranged from 0.1 ng/mL/min for Streptococcus faecalis to 8.8 ng/mL/min for Clostridium perfringens. The rate of conversion was reduced to 87% by a combination of 0.7% (w/v) sodium fluoride and potassium oxalate, and almost completely inhibited (96%) by 1% (w/v) sodium fluoride. pH had variable effects on the rate of metabolic bioconversion of nitrobenzodiazepines, while increasing temperatures were found to generally increase the rate of nitrobenzodiazepine bioconversion. These data support the proposal that bacteria may mediate postmortem bioconversion of the nitrobenzodiazepines.
TI  - Acute suppurative parotitis and parotid abscess in children.
AB  - Acute suppurative parotitis and parotid gland abscess are infrequently encountered among children. Fourteen children were diagnosed in the Sheba Medical Center as suffering from these infections and their clinical features are described. Discussion reveals neither significant differences nor predominating factors to differentiate between these two entities.
TI  - Synergistic interaction between ofloxacin and cefotaxime against common clinical  pathogens.
AB  - Antimicrobial synergy resulting from combined antibiotic therapy is often important in the treatment of serious bacterial infections. To investigate the interactions between cefotaxime (CTX), desacetylcefotaxime (DES), and ofloxacin (OFL), 247 recent clinical isolates were tested for in vitro susceptibility to each antibiotic alone by an agar dilution technique and retested with the various antibiotic combinations using a checkerboard protocol. Fractional inhibitory concentrations were calculated for all organisms with all drug combinations. Time kill kinetic studies were performed on selected isolates to examine the bactericidal activity of the various antimicrobial combinations. Of the 110 gram-negative organisms tested, synergy or partial synergy between CTX, DES and OFL was demonstrable for 89 (81%). Included in the study were 70 members of the Enterobacteriaceae family, 20 isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 10 strains of Acinetobacter baumannii, and 10 isolates of Xanthomonas maltophilia. Additive activity was observed against an additional 13 (11%) isolates. Findings were similar for the 89 gram-positive isolates examined. Organisms tested included methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (20), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (20), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (9), methicillin-susceptible S. epidermidis (10), Enterococcus faecalis (10), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (20). Synergy or partial synergy was observed against 81 (91%). Less synergistic activity was detected, however, with members of the Bacteroides fragilis group. Of the 48 organisms tested, synergy or partial synergy was noted for only 27 (57%). Isolates representative of each major group of organisms included in the study were tested to determine whether synergistic bactericidal activity was also demonstrable with the three drugs. Time kill studies supported the checkerboard results.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [Nationwide survey on susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents in 1991].
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical isolates to  different antibacterial agents at 123 hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1991. In this study, identifications and susceptibility testings were carried out at each hospital laboratory. The susceptibility testing were performed using the disk dilution method recommended by NCCLS. Staphylococcus aureus and CNS showed high or moderate resistance rates to methicillin (DMPPC). Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Proteus mirabilis were highly susceptible to many agents including beta-lactam antibiotics. Though Enterococcus faecalis was highly susceptible to ampicillin (ABPC), piperacillin (PIPC), imipenem (IPM), sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (ST) compounds, Enterococcus faecium was resistant to almost all antibacterial agents but to ST compounds. High susceptibility rates were observed for strains of Enterobacter cloacae to IPM, gentamicin (GM) and ofloxacin (OFLX) and for strains of Proteus vulgaris to latamoxef (LMOX), IPM, aztreonam (AZT), GM and OFLX. Serratia marcescens and Bacteroides fragilis group were highly susceptible only to IPM. Pseudomonas aeruginosa were sensitive to ceftazidime (CAZ), IPM, amikacin (AMK) and tobramycin (TOB). Pseudomonas cepacia was relatively susceptible only to CAZ. IPM showed strong antibacterial activity to many species except for S. aureus and CNS.
TI  - E-4695, a new C-7 azetidinyl fluoronaphthyridine with enhanced activity against gram-positive and anaerobic pathogens.
AB  - E-4695, (-)-7-[3-(R)-amino-2-(S)-methyl-1-azetidinyl]-1-cyclopropyl-1,4- dihydro-6-fluoro-4-oxo-1,8-naphthyridine-3-carboxylic acid, is a new fluorinated naphthyridine with an azetidine moiety. The MICs of E-4695 at which 90% of the isolates were inhibited (MIC90s) were 0.06 to 0.5 microgram/ml for gram-positive cocci, including species of the genera Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, and Enterococcus, and the MIC90s against gram-negative pathogens such as members of the family Enterobacteriaceae (with the exception of Providencia spp. [MIC90, 8 micrograms/ml]) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were 0.015 to 0.5 microgram/ml. E-4695 inhibited 90% of the Clostridium perfringens and Bacteroides fragilis isolates at 0.25 and 4 micrograms/ml, respectively. Against gram-positive cocci the potency of E-4695 was 2- to 8-fold higher than that of ciprofloxacin, 4- to 8-fold higher than that of ofloxacin, and 8- to 16-fold higher than that of fleroxacin. Against enteric bacteria and P. aeruginosa the potency of E-4695 was, in general, similar to that of ciprofloxacin and eightfold higher than those of ofloxacin and fleroxacin. E-4695 was four- and eightfold more potent than ciprofloxacin against C. perfringens and B. fragilis isolates, respectively. E-4695 and ciprofloxacin showed similar properties when the effects of pH or magnesium concentration were tested on them. E-4695 and ciprofloxacin had substantial reductions of activity only when pH decreased below 4.8. E-4695 and ciprofloxacin activities were not markedly affected by the presence of 5 or 10 mM Mg2+. The presence of serum and human urine at pH 7.2 decreased the activity of E-4695 between two- and fourfold. After an oral dose of 50 mg/kg of body weight, the maximum level in serum, the biological half-life, and the area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 10 h for E-4695 were 13.2 microgram/ml, 3.3 h, and 45.6 microgram . h/ml, respectively. The area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 4 h for ciprofloxacin was 2.3 microgram . h/ml at the same dose. Fifty-percent effective doses (ED50S) against Staphylococcus aureus HS-93 infections in mice were 4.5 mg/kg with E-4695 and 37.6 mg/kg with ciprofloxacin. Infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae 29206 was more effectively treated with E-4695 (ED50, 41,2 mg/kg) than with ciprofloxacin (ED50, 200 mg/kg). The ED50 of E-4695 for infections with Streptococcus pneumoniae 1625 was 132.2 mg/kg; ciprofloxacin was ineffective at 400 mg/kg against this strain. E-4695 was also more potent than ciprofloxacin in treatment of infections caused by gram-negative organisms such as Escherichia coli HM-42 (ED50S, 1.0 and 3.9 mg/kg, respectively). The ED50S of E-4695 and ciprofloxacin were 33.0 and 145.5 mg/kg against P. aeruginosa HS-116 and 9.6 and 18.9 mg/kg against P. aeruginosa B-120, respectively. The therapeutic efficacy of E-4695 may depend not only on its in vitro activity but also on its improved pharmacokinetic properties.
TI  - Growth conditions influence expression of cell surface hydrophobicity of staphylococci and other wound infection pathogens.
AB  - The initial adhesion of microbes to tissue and solid surfaces can be mediated by  hydrophobic interaction. Expression of microbial cell surface hydrophobicity (CSH) is influenced by growth conditions, and often best expressed after growth under nutrient-poor conditions, or "starvation". In the present study, the CSH of 133 strains of Enterobacteriaceae, Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Enterococcus faecalis, group A streptococcus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Clostridium perfringens, Bacteroides fragilis, Peptococcus magnus, and of 8 Candida albicans strains was measured by the salt aggregation test after growth on hematin agar in a 5% CO2 atmosphere, or under anaerobiosis. Cells of all but 8 strains expressed pronounced or moderate CSH, i.e., they aggregated in 0.01-2 M ammonium sulfate. When the agar surface was covered by human serum (diluted 1:5) to mimic growth conditions in a wound, 94 strains expressed higher CSH, and 44 strains the same CSH as after growth without serum. The CSH of 12 strains of different species was measured after growth on blood, hematin and PDM agar, with or without serum, and in an aerobic or a 5% CO2 atmosphere. The highest CSH was expressed after growth in 5% CO2 with serum, and the lowest growth after on blood agar in aerobic atmosphere. Identical results were obtained with native and heat-inactivated (56 C, 20 min) serum. The reduced surface tension obtained in 5% CO2, as well as yet unidentified serum factors, promotes expression of CSH.
TI  - Development, characterization, and initial evaluations of S1. A new chromogenic cephalosporin for beta-lactamase detection.
AB  - A novel, chromogenic cephalosporin reagent (S1) for beta-lactamase testing was produced that shares physicochemical characteristics with nitrocefin (formerly 87/312). S1 and nitrocefin in a disk-testing format for beta-lactamase performed at 100% agreement for detecting enzyme-producing isolates of Bacteroides fragilis group, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Staphylococcus aureus, and selected Enterobacteriaceae. The time required to achieve an initial color change or a strong positive reaction was comparable for both chromogenic reagents for all organisms except the Gram-positive species. S1 reaction times were approximately 50% faster than nitrocefin for beta-lactamase-positive enterococci and S. aureus. These results from the developmental studies and a commercially prepared disk lot indicate that S1 is a promising beta-lactamase disk test reagent with the ability to detect all significant enzyme-producing species strains, some significantly earlier than the nitrocefin disk method.
TI  - Biochemical comparison of imipenem, meropenem and biapenem: permeability, binding to penicillin-binding proteins, and stability to hydrolysis by beta-lactamases.
AB  - Biological activities of biapenem, imipenem, and meropenem were compared with respect to permeability into Gram-negative bacteria, binding to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), and hydrolysis by beta-lactamases. Permeability for the three carbapenems was similar when measured in Serratia marcescens S6 producing a carbapenem-hydrolyzing beta-lactamase. Penetration of the carbapenems was comparable with cephaloridine and faster than piperacillin or the extended spectrum cephalosporin cefotaxime. All the carbapenems bound most strongly to PBP 2 of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and to PBP 1 of Staphylococcus aureus. In addition, biapenem showed strong affinity with PBP 1a of E. coli and PBP 1b of P. aeruginosa. Selected serine beta-lactamases, including the extended spectrum plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases, hydrolyzed these carbapenems at rates < 0.1% that of cephaloridine. Metallo-beta-lactamases hydrolysed the carbapenems at measurable rates, with enzymes from Bacteroides fragilis and Xanthomonas maltophilia hydrolyzing biapenem at lower Vmax values than meropenem or imipenem. In conclusion, all the carbapenems exhibited good rates of penetration, bound strongly to PBPs in both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, and were stable to most Group 1 and Group 2 serine beta-lactamases, but were hydrolyzed by metallo-beta-lactamases.
TI  - Bacteriology of chronic suppurative otitis media.
AB  - Aspiration of exudate through an open perforation was performed in 183 patients with chronic otitis media. The pus was cultured aerobically and anaerobically. Aerobes only were isolated from 71 patients (39%); 20 patients (11%) had only anaerobes; and 91 patients (50%) had both aerobes and anaerobes. Only 1 specimen had no growth. There were 259 aerobic isolates. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was recovered from 68 patients. Other aerobes commonly recovered included Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae. There were 178 anaerobic isolates. Only anaerobic gram-positive cocci were isolated in 20 instances. Sixty-three Bacteroides isolates were recovered, including 12 Bacteroides fragilis group and 21 Bacteroides melaninogenicus.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity and beta-lactamase stability of SY5555, a new oral penem antibiotic.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of SY5555, a new oral penem antibiotic, was compared with those of cefaclor, cefixime, and cefteram. SY5555 was more active than the comparison agents against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Morganella morganii, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Clostridium spp., and Bacteroides fragilis. Against Providencia spp., Proteus spp., and Haemophilus influenzae, SY5555 was less active than cefixime or cefteram. SY5555 was inactive against methicillin-resistant S. aureus. Enterococcus faecium, Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Xanthomonas maltophilia, as were the comparison agents. The bactericidal activities of SY5555, cefixime, and cefteram were at or slightly greater than the MICs for clinical isolates of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. SY5555 was not hydrolyzed by various types of beta-lactamases. However, SY5555 and the comparison agents were hydrolyzed by X. maltophilia (L-1) and P. aeruginosa/pMS354 beta-lactamases, two Bush group 3 beta-lactamases, SY5555 showed a high affinity, as did cefixime and cefteram, for cephalosporinases from C. freundii GN7391 and E. cloacae GN7471 strains. These results suggest that SY5555 may be more specific than existing beta-lactam antibiotics.
TI  - Gas gangrene following sacral pressure sores.
AB  - We report two cases of gas gangrene developed from sacral pressure sores. The first case was clostridial and the second, non-clostridial gas gangrene. Both patients died within two months. The first patient, a 56-year-old woman suffering from palsy of the lower half of the body for 3 weeks, developed a sacral pressure sore. One month later, crepitus by palpation and gas formation in the X-ray film were detected in the hip and right thigh. A culture of odoriferous pus yielded Clostridium limosum in addition to Staphylococcus intermedius, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Bacteroides fragilis. Blood culture yielded Bacteroides fragilis. The patient died 50 days after admission in spite of surgical debridement and aggressive therapy with high doses of antibiotics and hyperbaric oxygen. The second patient, a 70-year-old man suffering from diabetic nephropathy, arteriosclerosis obliterans of the lower limbs, and cerebral infarction, developed a large decubitus ulcer covering the whole sacral area. Crepitus and gas were detected in the soft tissue of the left gluteal region. Almost the entire gluteus maximus muscle was necrotic. Bacteroides fragilis, methicillin-resistant or -sensitive Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli were isolated from the muscle. Bacteroides fragilis was also obtained by blood culture. The patient died on the 72nd day after admission.
TI  - In-vitro activity of four new fluoroquinolones.
AB  - The in-vitro activities of four new fluoroquinolones, E-4749, E-4874, E-4884 and  E-4904, were compared with that of ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against 1106 clinical isolates. Against majority of Enterobacteriaceae, general antibacterial activities of E-4749 (MIC90s 0.06-1 mg/L), E-4874 (MIC90s, 0.03-0.25 mg/L) and E-4884 (MIC90s 0.01-0.5 mg/L) were comparable or slightly lower than those of ciproloxacin (MIC90s 0.01-0.25 mg/L) and sparfloxacin (MIC90s 0.01-1 mg/L). The activity of E-4904 (MIC90s 0.06-2 mg/L) was lower than those of its analogues. Most of the Escherichia coli which were resistant to ciprofloxacin (MIC > or = 2 mg/L) and Serratia spp., were resistant to the new fluoroquinolones. beta-Lactamase producing strains of Moraxella catarrhalis were very susceptible to these compounds (MICs < or = 0.008 mg/L). Most of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, non-aeruginosa Pseudomonas spp., Xanthomonas maltophilia, and Acinetobacter spp. were resistant to the new quinolones (MIC90s 8- > 16 mg/L). On the contrary, these new antimicrobials were active against the majority of the Aeromonas spp. (MIC90s < or = 0.5 mg/L). E-4749, E-4874, E-4884 and E-4904 remained active (MIC90s < or = 0.25 mg/L) against Staphylococcus aureus strains susceptible to methicillin. However, its activity was two- to eight-fold lower than that of ciprofloxacin (MIC90 0.03 mg/L) and sparfloxacin (MIC90 0.06 mg/L). Against S. aureus resistant to methicillin or ciprofloxacin, activity of these new compounds and comparators agents, was very low (MIC90s 2- > 16 mg/L). Most of the strains of Enterococcus faecalis were resistant (MIC90s > 16 mg/L). The activity of E-4874, E-4904 and sparfloxacin (MIC90 1 mg/L for each one) was higher than that of the rest of the agents tested. E-4874 (MIC90 0.25 mg/L) was four-fold more active than the other antibacterials tested (MIC90 2 mg/L) against Listeria monocytogenes. No new quinolone was active against Bacteroides fragilis (MIC90s 4-16 mg/L), Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (MIC90s 8- > 16 mg/L), and other B. fragilis group (MIC90s 16- > 16 mg/L). Ciprofloxacin (MIC90s > 16 mg/L), and sparfloxacin (MIC90s 8-16 mg/L) also were inactive. E-4874 (MIC90 4 mg/L) was the most active quinolone tested against B.fragilis.
TI  - The bacteriology of obstructive pneumonitis. A prospective study using ultrasound-guided transthoracic needle aspiration.
AB  - Obstructive pneumonitis, the opacity that develops distal to an obstructing endobronchial lesion or external compression, is actually a combination of atelectasis, bronchiectasis with mucus plugging, and true parenchymal inflammation. In the majority of cases, it is usually not possible to determine whether infection is present or not from the radiographic findings alone. The aim of this study was to evaluate the bacteriology of obstructive pneumonitis and the influence of this result on the treatment of patients. From March 1992 to February 1993, 26 consecutive patients (20 men and six women) with obstructive pneumonitis were investigated. The obstructive pneumonitis had been caused by malignant tumors in 24 and benign lesions in two. Chest ultrasound (US) and US-guided percutaneous transthoracic aspirations were undergone to obtain specimens for microbiologic examination. Microorganisms were isolated from seven of nine febrile patients and two of 17 nonfebrile patients. A total of 16 bacterial strains are detected in obstructive pneumonitis (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, viridant streptococci, Bacteroides fragilis, two Peptostreptococcus species, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Pseudomonas maltophilia, Streptococcus sanguis, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacteroides thetaiotamomicrons, Bacteroides intermedius, Bacteroides species, Veillonella species, aerobic gram-positive bacilli, and Escherichia coli). In five cases the isolates were monobacteriae, and in the remaining four cases, cultures yielded more than one bacteria. The results of aspirate cultures led to changes in the initial antibiotic trial in seven of nine patients, and fever subsided thereafter. Pneumothorax occurred in one cases as the sole complication. The pathogen causing obstructive pneumonitis is very heterogeneous, and polymicrobial infection is common.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of FK037, a new parenteral broad-spectrum cephalosporin, against recent clinical isolates in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of a new parenteral cephalosporin, FK037 was assessed  against recent aerobic and anaerobic strains isolated from patients in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology during the period between January 1992 and June 1993. The MICs of FK037 for 90% of the clinical isolates tested were 0.10 microgram/ml for Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, 0.20 microgram/ml for Streptococcus agalactiae, 0.39 microgram/ml for Gardnerella vaginalis, 0.78 microgram/ml for Staphylococcus epidermidis, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Mobiluncus spp., 1.56 micrograms/ml for Peptostreptococcus magnus, 3.13 micrograms/ml for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, 25 micrograms/ml for methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), Bacteroides fragilis and Prevotella disiens, 100 micrograms/ml for Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and Prevotella bivia; and > 100 micrograms/ml for Enterococcus faecalis. FK037 was superior in potency to ceftazidime against all strains except E. faecalis, P. anaerobius and P. bivia. It was 4- to 16-fold more active than cefotaxime against aerobic gram-positive bacteria and P. disiens, and its activity was similar to that of cefotaxime against the other strains. FK037 had 4- to 16-fold stronger activity than flomoxef against MRSA, S. agalactiae and E. coli and a similar activity to flomoxef against the other strains except G. vaginalis and B. fragilis that were 4-fold more sensitive to flomoxef than to FK037.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo evaluations of A-80556, a new fluoroquinolone.
AB  - A-80556 is a novel fluoroquinolone with potent antibacterial activity against gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic organisms. A-80556 was more active than ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, lomefloxacin, and sparfloxacin against gram-positive bacteria. A-80556 was particularly active against Staphylococcus aureus (MIC for 90% of isolates [MIC90], 0.12 microgram/ml, relative to fluoroquinolone-susceptible strains) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC90, 0.12 microgram/ml). A-80556 was also the most active of the quinolones tested against ciprofloxacin-resistant S. aureus, with an MIC90 of 4.0 micrograms/ml; that of ciprofloxacin was > 128 micrograms/ml. However, the significance of this activity is not known. A-80556 was slightly less active against Escherichia coli (MIC90, 0.06 microgram/ml) and other enteric organisms than ciprofloxacin (MIC90 for E. coli, < or = 0.03 microgram/ml). A-80556 was slightly less active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90, 4.0 micrograms/ml) than ciprofloxacin (MIC90, 2.0 micrograms/ml) and more active against Acinetobacter spp. (respective MIC90s, 0.12 and 0.5 microgram/ml). A-80556 was also the most active compound against anaerobes. Against Bacteroides fragilis, the MIC90 of A-80556 was 2.0 micrograms/ml; that of ciprofloxacin was 16 micrograms/ml. The in vivo efficacy of A-80556 in experimental models with both gram-positive and gram-negative infections was consistent with the in vitro activity and pharmacokinetics and oral absorption in mice.
TI  - Polymicrobial polyarticular arthritis.
AB  
TI  - A bacteriologic basis for the evolution and severity of empyema.
AB  - The management of pediatric empyema remains controversial. An experimental study  was undertaken to evaluate the role of bacteria in the evolution and severity of empyema, using specific bacteria that are pathogens of empyema in children. A rabbit model was used. The groups were Haemophilus influenzae (n = 9), Bacteroides fragilis (n = 8), the combination (n = 12), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 6), and control (n = 6). The total bacterial inoculum (10(8)) was constant. Diagnostic thoracentesis was performed at regular intervals. Characteristics of the empyema were evaluated when the rabbits were killed (at 4, 7, and 10 days). Most rabbits other than those of the mixed-bacteria group cleared the bacteria from their pleural cavities. Eleven of 12 mixed-bacteria animals had multiloculated empyemas; only one resolved spontaneously. In the other groups, the tendency was toward unilocular empyemas, which resolved by the 10th day in one third of the H influenzae animals, two thirds of the Bacteroides fragilis animals, and half the S aureus animals. The empyemas that persisted until the 10th day were in the exudative or fibrinopurulent stage, except for those of the mixed-bacteria group, all of which were in the advanced organizing stage. The amount of pleural debris and the degree of organization were significantly greater for the mixed bacteria group (P > .01). These findings support the clinical management of monobacterial empyema by simple drainage, whereas mixed aerobic-anaerobic empyemas may require more aggressive drainage procedures.
TI  - Interaction between antibiotics and antineoplastic drugs on antibacterial activity in-vitro - estramustine phosphate sensitizes pneumococci to amikacin.
AB  - The antibacterial and interactive effects of doxorubicin, cisplatin, cytarabine,  vincristine, carmustine, mitoxantrone, methotrexate, bleomycin, 5-fluorouracil, epirubicin, DTIC, mitomycin, etoposide and estramustine phosphate on the antibacterial activity of penicillin G, piperacillin, ceftazidime, imipenem, trimethoprim, amikacin, tetracyclin, oxacillin, metronidazole, 5-FC, and amphotericin B were studied on 57 bacterial strains. The bacterial species investigated were Escherischia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Bacteroides fragilis. The antineoplastic drugs were diluted in Muller-Hinton agar on which the bacteria were propagated. For the susceptibility tests standard antibiotic paper discs were used and results were confirmed with the PDM epsilometer test. Seven of the fourteen cytostatic agents displayed an intrinsic antibacterial effect. A most striking interactive effect was seen in the situation where estramustine phosphate caused a marked increased sensitivity of pneumococci to amikacin, a drug to which they are regularly completely resistant.
TI  - Peptostreptococcal infection in children.
AB  - 680 Peptostreptococcus sp. (Ps) were recovered from 598 (34%) of 1,750 specimens  obtained from 554 patients. They included 103 Ps asaccharolyticus, 74 Ps magnus, 56 Ps prevotii, 51 Ps micros, 46 Ps anaerobius, 11 Ps morbilorum, and 10 Ps saccharolyticus. Most infections were polymicrobial (in 553 instances or 92%) but in 45 (8%), Ps were recovered in pure culture. Most Ps were isolated from abscesses (237), ears (104), peritoneal fluid (95), lung infections (66), bone (30) and sinuses (24). Predisposing conditions were present in 224 (40%) children. These were previous surgery (54), immunodeficiency (43), malignancy (35), trauma (34), diabetes (23), prematurity (22), steroid therapy (19), foreign body (10) and sickle-cell anemia (7). The organisms most commonly isolated with Ps were Bacteroides sp. (276, including 190 B. fragilis group), Prevotella sp. (159), Fusobacterium sp. (122), Escherichia coli (114), and Staphylococcus aureus (97). Antimicrobial therapy was administered to all but 14 patients. Surgical drainage or correction of pathology was performed in 307 (56%) patients. 10 patients (2%) died of their infection. These data illustrate the importance of Ps and suggests their enhancing potentials in infection in children.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of fluoroquinolones against clinical isolates obtained in 1989 and 1990.
AB  - The in vitro activity of nine fluoroquinolones, enoxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, lomefloxacin, tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, fleroxacin and levofloxacin, and two earlier quinolones, nalidixic acid and pipemidic acid, against 1,346 bacterial strains isolated clinically between 1989 and 1990, was evaluated by agar dilution method. The bacteria studied were Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus species (including high-level gentamicin-resistant strains), Escherichia coli, Salmonella species, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Citrobacter spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas cepacia, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Bacteroides fragilis. In contrast to the moderate to poor activity of two earlier quinolones, the fluoroquinolones acted well against most Enterobacteriaceae and A. baumannii. The minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of the drug strains (MIC90s) were < 1 microgram/mL against most tested species. Ciprofloxacin, tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, and levofloxacin were more effective against multi-drug-resistant nosocomial pathogens. All fluoroquinolones assayed were very active against methicillin-susceptible S. aureus, with MIC90s < or = 1 microgram/mL. For methicillin-resistant strains, on the other hand, the MIC90s were > or = 4 micrograms/mL. There was no significant difference in fluoroquinolone susceptibility between methicillin-susceptible and -resistant S. epidermidis. Sparfloxacin, tosufloxacin, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin were more active against enterococci. Most fluoroquinolones were relatively inactive against B. fragilis, with the exception of tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin and levofloxacin. The MIC90s of most quinolones assayed against K. pneumoniae, Citrobacter spp., E. cloacae, S. aureus and S. epidermidis were at least four-fold higher in our study. Therefore, it is important for physicians to use fluoroquinolones carefully so as to prevent or delay the emergence of resistant strains.
TI  - Induction of the release of prostaglandin E2 from polymorphonuclear neutrophil granulocytes by Bacteroides fragilis: its possible role in the pathogenesis of mixed infections.
AB  - The presence of anaerobic bacteria, especially of Bacteroides (B.) fragilis, in abdominal abscesses, infected decubitus ulcera, and the infected foot of diabetic patients is well documented. The importance, however, of these microorganisms in the pathogenesis of deep tissue infections has still to be evaluated. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the potency of B. fragilis as compared to aerobic bacteria widely known for causing inflammation, in inducing the release of prostaglandin E2 from polymorphonuclear granulocytes. Prostaglandin E2 is a potent vasodilator and contributes to edema and erythema, which are part of the inflammatory response. Furthermore, the cAMP-content of the neutrophils was determined after stimulation of the cells with the various bacteria. Of the bacterial species tested, B. fragilis proved to be one of the most potent triggers for prostaglandin E2 release from neutrophils indicating a possible major role of this microorganism in the pathogenesis of mixed infections.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activities of polymyxin B against clinically isolated microbial strains. Results of MIC determination including high concentrations].
AB  - Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined for polymyxin B (PL-B),  gentamicin, ofloxacin and norfloxacin against clinically isolated microbial strains collected since November 1992, and the following conclusions were obtained: 1. Judging from the MIC distribution of PL-B against the studied strains including multi-drug resistant organisms of major strains of family Enterobacteriaceae, such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter spp., and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, it appeared that no PL-B resistant strains were detected among those Gram-negative organisms within the antimicrobial spectrum of PL-B. 2. MICs of PL-B against most strains including methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci were distributed between 100 and 800 micrograms/ml. These results supported reports of other investigators that the eradication of Staphylococcus spp. including MRSA (methicillin-resistant S. aureus) was possible by the use of PL-B at 1 mg/ml. 3. MIC distribution of PL-B against organisms of the Bacteroides fragilis group was almost the same as the results described above.
TI  - Role of anaerobic bacteria in liver abscesses in children.
AB  - Aspirates from pyogenic liver abscesses obtained from 14 children were cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Of 29 organisms that were recovered, 17 were anaerobic and 12 were aerobic or facultative. The predominant organisms were Peptostreptococcus spp. (5 isolates). Bacteroides fragilis group (4), Fusobacterium spp. (3) and Staphylococcus aureus (4). Aerobic or facultative bacteria only were recovered in five cases, anaerobic bacteria only in four and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in five. Anaerobic bacteria were recovered in liver abscesses that were associated with other infection in which these organisms were predominant (i.e. abdominal infection, abscesses). This study highlights the potential importance of anaerobic bacteria in pyogenic liver abscess.
TI  - Formation of mucosal polyps in the nasal and maxillary sinus cavities by infection.
AB  - Unilateral maxillary sinusitis was experimentally induced in New Zealand White rabbits with Streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 3, Bacteroides fragilis NCTC 9343, and Staphylococcus aureus V8. In another group of rabbits, sinusitis was induced by blocking of the sinus ostium only. Bacteriologic and light microscopic analysis was performed after 5 days to 1 month. Granulation-like polyps developed after deep mucosal inflammatory trauma initiating fibroblast proliferation, angiogenesis, and epithelial migration to cover the polyp. In regions of a more superficial trauma-characterized by epithelial desquamation and fibroblast growth-proliferation and differentiation of basal cells resulted in the formation of microcavities dissecting off edematous polyps. Polyps could be found in all sinusitis groups, irrespective of inducing agent. The cellular events of polyp formation appear to be the result of a continuous inflammatory reaction and are not directly related to the presence of a certain microorganism. Instead, the potential of any microorganism to induce a deep mucosal trauma or epithelial desquamation seems essential for its ability to initiate polyp formation.
TI  - In vitro activities of BAY Y3118, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and fleroxacin against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens from respiratory tract and soft tissue infections.
AB  - BAY Y3118 was highly active against Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Legionella pneumophila, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus (except quinolone-resistant, methicillin-resistant S. aureus), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC for 90% of strains tested [MIC90], 0.063 micrograms/ml). For Enterococcus faecalis and Corynebacterium jeikeium, MIC90s were 4 and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. BAY Y3118 was as active as ciprofloxacin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) and had potent activity against Bacteroides fragilis (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml).
TI  - Use of cephalosporins for prophylaxis and therapy of polymicrobial infection in mice.
AB  - Cefoxitin, cefotetan, and cefmetazole were compared in 10-day therapy of intra-abdominal and subcutaneous infections caused by three organisms: Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron combined with either Escherichia coli or Staphylococcus aureus. Intra-abdominal infection was caused by B. fragilis plus B. thetaiotaomicron plus E. coli. Therapy was initiated immediately before inoculation or was delayed for 8 h. Mortality was 14 of 30 (47%) for saline-treated mice, and all survivors developed abscesses. Immediate therapy reduced mortality and the percentage of mice with abscesses (in survivors), respectively, to 17 and 20% with cefoxitin, 0 and 13% with cefotetan, and 0 and 17% with cefmetazole, and the numbers of all bacteria were reduced by all the cephalosporins. Delayed therapy reduced mortality and abscess formation, respectively, to 20 and 8% of mice with cefoxitin, 10 and 93% with cefotetan, and 7 and 96% with cefmetazole. B. thetaiotaomicron survived in all abscesses treated with cefotetan and cefmetazole. Subcutaneous abscesses were caused by each organism alone or in combinations of one aerobe (S. aureus or E. coli) and one or two Bacteroides species. Early therapy reduced the numbers of all bacteria independent of their in vitro susceptibility. All agents reduced the number of each Bacteroides species with either E. coli or S. aureus. However, when therapy was delayed, cefotetan and cefmetazole were less effective than cefoxitin against B. thetaiotaomicron. Cefotetan was the most active agent against E. coli, and cefmetazole was the most effective against S. aureus. These data illustrate the efficacy of all tested cephalosporins in the prophylaxis of polymicrobial infections.
TI  - Antimicrobial therapy of skin and soft tissue infection in children.
AB  - Skin and soft tissue infection and cutaneous abscesses are common in children. They may be polymicrobial in nature, especially when located proximal to mucous membranes. A general knowledge of the common causative bacterial organisms in these infections enables the physician to empirically institute antimicrobial therapy before culture results are available. This review assesses the number and types of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria that occur in skin and soft tissue infections in children. Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes were recovered from infections occurring at all body sites, but predominated in infections of the leg, neck, and hand. Group D streptococci, Enterobacteriaceae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Bacteroides fragilis, and Prevotella species were isolated mostly from infections of the external genitalia and perirectal areas; pigmented Prevotella and Porphyromonas and Haemophilus influenzae can be isolated from infections of the head and neck. Management of skin and soft tissue infections in children should include surgical and medical therapy.
TI  - [A nationwide survey of antimicrobial susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibiotics in Japan (1988-1990)].
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical isolates to  antibacterial agents at 149 hospitals throughout Japan from September to December in both 1989 and 1990. In this study, identifications and susceptibility testings were carried out at each hospital laboratory. The susceptibility testings were performed according to the disk diffusion method recommended by NCCLS. Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci showed high or moderate resistance rates to beta-lactam antibiotics, but Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae were highly susceptible to them. Enterococcus faecalis was susceptible to imipenem (IPM) and piperacillin but resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics and aminoglycosides. Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis were susceptible to beta-lactam drugs and aminoglycosides. Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa had a good susceptibility to IPM and aminoglycosides. Bacteroides fragilis was highly susceptible to IPM. IPM had strong antibacterial activity to many species of clinical isolates, including strains which were resistant to commonly used antibiotics.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of empyema. A retrospective review in two military hospitals.
AB  - The microbiology and clinical features of empyema were studied retrospectively in 197 patients whose specimens yielded bacterial growth after inoculation for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Three hundred forty-three organisms (216 aerobic or facultative and 127 anaerobic organisms) were isolated. Aerobic bacteria were isolated in 127 (64 percent) patients, anaerobic bacteria in 25 (13 percent), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in 45 (23 percent). The predominant aerobic or facultative organisms were Streptococcus pneumoniae (70 isolates), Staphylococcus aureus (58), Escherichia coli (17), Klebsiella pneumoniae (16), and Haemophilus influenzae (12). The predominant anaerobes were pigmented Prevotella and Porphyromonas species (24), Bacteroides fragilis group (22), anaerobic cocci (36), and Fusobacterium species (20). beta-Lactamase-producing organisms were recovered in 49 (38 percent) of 128 tested specimens. These included all 42 tested S aureus and 15 B fragilis group, 4 of 9 K pneumoniae, 3 of 9 H influenzae, 3 of 8 pigmented Prevotella and Porphyromonas species, and 2 of 6 E coli. Most patients from whom S pneumoniae and H influenzae were recovered had pneumonia, and most patients with S aureus had pneumonia, aspiration pneumonia, and lung abscesses. The recovery of anaerobic bacteria was mostly associated with the concomitant diagnosis of aspiration pneumonia, and lung, subdiaphragmatic, dental, and oropharyngeal abscesses. These data highlight the importance of anaerobic bacteria in selected cases of empyema.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of biapenem, a new carbapenem antibiotic.
AB  - Biapenem is a new carbapenem antibiotic with high stability to human renal dehydropeptidase I. Its in vitro activity was compared with that of imipenem, meropenem, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, piperacillin and gentamicin against a total of 650 recent clinical isolates. MICs were determined by a standard agar dilution procedure and all isolates were tested at two inocula (10(4) and 10(6) cfu). Biapenem inhibited 90% of isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia stuartii, Enterobacter spp., Citrobacter freundii, Serratia marcescens, Salmonella typhi, Shigella sonnei and Yersinia enterocolitica at < or = 2 mg/l and was as active as or two- to four-fold more active than imipenem against all these species, with the exception of Serratia marcescens, against which imipenem was two-fold more active. Biapenem was two-fold more active than imipenem against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90 4 mg/l) and had activity similar to that of imipenem against the Bacteroides fragilis group (MIC90 0.5 mg/l) but was two-fold less active than imipenem against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MIC90 0.06 mg/l) and was, like imipenem, inactive against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Pharmacokinetics and clinical study of cefotetan in bile: prophylactic use in biliary tract surgery.
AB  - The excretion of cefotetan, a 7 alpha-methoxy-cephalosporin, was studied in 27 patients undergoing biliary surgery. Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined after a single intravenous bolus dose of 1 g (10 patients) or 2 g (17 patients). Rapidly excreted in bile, cefotetan concentrations were considerably higher in bile [range: 92-2,594 mg.l-1 (1 g); 35-4,610 mg.l-1 (2 g)] than in plasma despite the presence of gall stones. Bile bactericidal activities against Staphylococcus aureus (MIC 8 mg.l-1) and Bacteroides fragilis (MIC 2 mg.l-1) correlated well with gall bladder cefotetan levels [r = 0.888 (1 g); r = 0.971 (2 g)]. No cefotetan was detected in the bile of 3 patients with nonfunctioning gall bladders. One other patient with very low activity and these three aside, the inhibitory quotients (cefotetan concentration/MIC) were > 4 for both doses against both bacteria.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activities of aspoxicillin of fresh clinical isolates].
AB  - The Antimicrobial activity of aspoxicillin (ASPC) in terms of minimum inhibitory  concentration (MICs) was compared with those of other penicillin antibiotics (PCs) against clinical isolates sent to us from medical institutions throughout Japan in 1988, 1990 and 1992 and strains isolated and identified from samples collected from patients with various infections. 1. The MIC80's of ASPC against Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus spp., Escherichia coli, Bacteroides fragilis group were almost the same as those against these isolates in 1985 to 1986. 2. A trend for increasing susceptibility to PCs including ASPC was observed in the isolates of S. aureus and Haemophilus influenzae. This trend in S. aureus was attributed to the appearance of non beta-lactamase producing strains associated with the development of highly resistant strains among the methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) as well as to a tendency toward yearly decreasing frequency of MRSA. The trend for the increased susceptibility in H. influenzae was related to the decrease in the number of beta-lactamase production strains. 3. The frequency of the strains highly resistant to PCs including ASPC increased. 4. No PCs-resistant strains were observed among the so-called beta-streptococci, while among alpha-streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae there was a trend for decreasing frequency of strains with lower susceptibility to PCs or those with resistant to PCs. These strains may be variants which were also resistant to cephems and had penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). Meanwhile, a high frequency of highly PCs-resistant strains were noted among Enterococcus faecium. In view of the fact that the PCs-resistance of E. faecium is known to be related to PBPs, the pattern of the susceptibility of the recent clinical isolates to beta-lactams is considered to be multimodal.
TI  - Potentiation of decreased pyruvate dehydrogenase activity by inflammatory stimuli in sepsis.
AB  - The effect of inflammation and chronic sepsis on the activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDH) in skeletal muscle was investigated in rats. Inflammation was induced by the placement of a catheter in the carotid artery. Sepsis was induced by repeated (every 48 hr) injections of an inoculum composed of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Bacteroides fragilis organisms into a preformed subcutaneous abscess. Hindlimb muscle was sampled 7 or 14 days following the initial injection of the inoculum into the abscess. Total PHD activity was not altered by any of the conditions examined. There were no differences in the proportion of active PDH complex after 7 days in any of the conditions examined. In contrast, 14 days after the initial bacterial injection, the concentration of active PDH complex in skeletal muscle was reduced by 50% in the septic rats. The combination of intravascular catheterization and infection resulted in a further decrease in the concentration of active PDH complex. The decreased concentration of active PDH complex was associated with increased plasma lactate concentrations in septic rats. Catheterization exacerbated the rise in plasma lactate in sepsis. In this model of chronic sepsis, the magnitude of the hyperlactatemia and the inhibition of the PDH complex in skeletal muscle appear dependent upon the length of time of the septic insult and are potentiated by addition of an intravascular focus of inflammation.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of T-3761, a new quinolone derivative.
AB  - T-3761, a new quinolone derivative, showed broad and potent antibacterial activity. Its MICs for 90% of the strains tested were 0.20 to 100 micrograms/ml against gram-positive bacteria, including members of the genera Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, and Enterococcus; 0.025 to 3.13 micrograms/ml against gram-negative bacteria, including members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and the genus Haemophilus; 0.05 to 50 micrograms/ml against glucose nonfermenters, including members of the genera Pseudomonas, Xanthomonas, Acinetobacter, Alcaligenes, and Moraxella; 0.025 micrograms/ml against Legionella spp.; and 6.25 to 25 micrograms/ml against anaerobes, including Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium difficile, and Peptostreptococcus spp. The in vitro activity of T-3761 against these clinical isolates was comparable to or 2- to 32-fold greater than those of ofloxacin and norfloxacin and 2- to 16-fold less and 1- to 8-fold greater than those of ciprofloxacin and tosulfoxacin, respectively. When administered orally, T-3761 showed good efficacy in mice against systemic, pulmonary, and urinary tract infections with gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including quinolone-resistant Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The in vivo activity of T-3761 was comparable to or greater than those of ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, and tosufloxacin against most infection models in mice. The activities of T-3761 were lower than those of tosufloxacin against gram-positive bacterial systemic and pulmonary infections in mice but not against infections with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. The activities of T-3761 against systemic quinolone-resistant Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections in mice were 2- to 14-fold greater than those of the reference agents.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of FK037, a novel parenteral broad-spectrum cephalosporin.
AB  - FK037 is a new parenteral cephalosporin, which offers some advantages over the commercially available parenteral cephalosporins. It demonstrated potent broad-spectrum activity against clinical isolates of Gram-positive bacteria including methicillin-resistant staphylococci, and Gram-negative bacteria including Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Against clinical isolates of aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, FK037, like cefpirome, demonstrated more potent activity than ceftazidime, cefoperazone and ceftizoxime. It is noteworthy that FK037, on the basis of the MIC90s, was the most active of all the cephalosporins tested against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). It was similar in activity to cefpirome against methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA). Against clinical isolates of aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, FK037, like cefpirome, was superior to cefoperazone, similar to ceftazidime and inferior to ceftizoxime in activity. Against P. aeruginosa, FK037 was superior to cefoperazone, similar or slightly superior to cefpirome and inferior to ceftazidime in activity. However, FK037 exhibited significant activity against Citrobacter and Enterobacter which were highly resistant to ceftazidime, cefoperazone and ceftizoxime. FK037 had an advantage in that its bactericidal activity against S. aureus, Escherichia coli and P. aeruginosa at sub-MICs (1/2 or 1/4 the MIC) was much stronger than those of cefpirome and ceftazidime. Moreover, it exhibited potent bactericidal activity against MSSA, MRSA and P. aeruginosa in a pharmacokinetic in vitro model simulating human plasma concentrations after intravenous dosage of 0.125, 1.0 and 1.0 g, respectively. FK037 inhibited essential penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), 1, 2 and 3 of S. aureus with a 50% inhibitory concentration (I50) of 0.58 micrograms/ml or lower. Of essential PBPs 3, 1a and 1b of E. coli and P. aeruginosa, FK037 inhibited PBP 3 at the lowest I50 (0.03 and 0.04 micrograms/ml, respectively) and PBPs 1a and 1b with I50 values of 2.7 micrograms/ml or lower. FK037, like cefpirome, was highly stable to hydrolysis by various beta-lactamases except Ic cephalosporinase from Bacteroides fragilis, and had extremely low affinity for beta-lactamases. Therefore, FK037 was more potent than ceftazidime in activity against beta-lactamase-producing bacteria except P. aeruginosa and Serratia marcescens. The ability of FK037 to penetrate the outer membrane of E. coli was slightly higher than that of ceftazidime, but slightly lower than that of cefpirome.
TI  - Susceptibility survey of piperacillin alone and in the presence of tazobactam.
AB  - Among 325 fresh isolates of bacteria from 153 hospital patients with serious infections, 142 were susceptible to piperacillin, 129 were resistant and a further 54 exhibited a marked inoculum effect. Tazobactam restored the susceptibility of resistant isolates of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis (except methicillin-resistant isolates), Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Acinetobacter spp. and Bacteroides fragilis. Among 87 Enterobacteriaceae that were resistant to piperacillin, or showed an inoculum effect, 78 (89%) were restored to susceptibility by tazobactam. Pseudomonas spp. resistant to piperacillin were mostly resistant to the combination.
TI  - The in-vitro activity of Bay y 3118, a new chlorofluoroquinolone.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of Bay y 3118, a new quinolone antimicrobial was compared with that of ciprofloxacin, sparfloxacin and three beta-lactams against 620 clinical isolates. Bay y 3118 was the most active quinolone against the majority of Enterobacteriaceae and Staphylococcus spp. The MIC90 for the members of the Enterobacteriaceae were < or = 0.12 mg/L except for Serratia spp. (1 mg/L) and in general Bay y 3118 was two-fold more active than ciprofloxacin or sparfloxacin. Strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were more susceptible to ciprofloxacin (MIC90 0.25 mg/L) than to Bay y 3118 (MIC90 0.5 mg/L) or sparfloxacin (MIC90 1.0 mg/L). Staphylococcus aureus was more susceptible to Bay y 3118 (MIC90 0.03 mg/L) and sparfloxacin (MIC90 0.06 mg/L) than to ciprofloxacin (MIC90 1 mg/L) and similar differences were noted for Staphylococcus saprophyticus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Streptococcus pneumoniae was susceptible to Bay y 3118 (MIC90 0.03 mg/L) as were other streptococci. Enterococcus spp. was four-fold more susceptible to Bay y 3118 and sparfloxacin than to ciprofloxacin. All strains of Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella spp. were inhibited by Bay y 3118 < or = 0.015 mg/L. Anaerobes were more susceptible to Bay y 3118 than to other quinolones; the MIC90 of Bay y 3118 for Bacteroides fragilis being 0.06 mg/L. Little effect was seen by increasing the inoculum from 10(4) cfu to 10(6). Bay y 3118 inhibited Chlamydia sp. at concentrations < or = 0.015 mg/L.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of rokitamycin against fresh clinical isolates].
AB  - We obtained bacterial strains which were clinically isolated and identified from  outpatients with various infections in medical institutions throughout Japan. Possible antibacterial activities of rokitamycin (RKM) were examined against these isolates. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined through a comparative study with reference drugs. The results of the study are summarized as follows. 1. Resistance patterns of 400 isolates which were highly resistant to macrolides (MLs) with MIC values > 100 micrograms/ml were classified into 55 patterns. Staphylococcus spp. showed cross resistance to 14-membered ring MLs with 100% cross resistance observed between erythromycin (EM) and clarithromycin (CAM), and 85.2% between EM and oleandomycin (OL). Fewer isolates showed strong resistance to 16-membered ring MLs than to 14-membered ring MLs. Cross resistances observed among the Staphylococcus isolates were 100% between acetylmidecamycin (MDM-AC) and kitasamycin (leucomycin (LM)), 93.9% between MDM-AC and josamycin (JM), and 53.3% between MDM-AC and RKM. Streptococcus spp. and Peptococcus spp. showed very similar resistance patterns to both 14- and 16-membered ring MLs, but resistance patterns to RKM were quite different. Most of anaerobic streptococci and Bacteroides fragilis group had similar resistance patterns to 14- and 16-membered ring MLs, but in some cases a pattern similar to that of Staphylococcus spp. was observed. 2. When ML-resistant bacteria isolated during 1975 to 1980 were compared to those isolated in 1986 and 1989, it was observed that resistance of Staphylococcus aureus remained almost unchanged, that of Streptococcus pyogenes was lower in the later years than during 1975 to 1980, but that of Streptococcus pneumoniae increased. 3. Most of ML-resistances of the resistant isolates were inducible, but extents of induction varied depending on drugs tested. Strong inductions were observed when 14-membered ring MLs were used, but inductions were minimal with 16-membered ring MLs. RKM appeared to induce resistance to the least extent. From these results, it appears that the RKM is quite useful clinically even in the 1990s.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activities of ceftazidime on fresh clinical isolates].
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of ceftazidime (CAZ) was compared with those of other cephem antibiotics against clinically isolated strains sent to us by medical institutions throughout Japan in 1989 and 1991. Those strains separated and identified from samples collected from patients with various infections were also examined, and the following results were obtained. 1. The results suggested that, compared with reports of studies conducted with clinical isolates in early 1980's, MIC90 of CAZ in 1991 were markedly higher against Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter spp., Serratia marcescens, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Also, among other bacteria such as Providencia rettgeri, Providencia stuartii, Xanthomonas maltophilia, and Bacteroides fragilis group, strains resistant to CAZ were observed in high proportions. However, large time-course changes were not observed in microbial activities of CAZ on Streptococcus pyogenes, Klebsiella spp, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas cepacia, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Haemophilus influenzae and Anaerobic GPC (Gram-positive cocci). 2. Among the strains used in the study, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Benzylpenicillin (PCG)-insensitive S. pneumoniae (PISP), cephamycin and oxime type cephem-resistant Gram-negative bacilli of Enterobacteriaceae and new quinolone-resistant organisms were observed in high proportions. It appears therefore, that CAZ failed to exert sufficient antimicrobial activities to these strains because of combination of resistance in these strains. 3. Antimicrobial activities of CAZ on recent clinical isolates showed problems as mentioned above. However, it was also demonstrated that CAZ maintained effective antimicrobial activities against most of the clinical isolates which could be causative organisms of infectious diseases in the clinical practice. When it is additionally taken into account that CAZ is one of those limited drugs with activity against P. aeruginosa, and it has excellent permeability through outer membrane, it is concluded that CAZ still is one of the clinically useful cephem drugs in 1990's.
TI  - In vitro activity of RU 29246, the active compound of the cephalosporin prodrug ester HR 916.
AB  - The in vitro activity of RU 29246 was compared with those of other agents against 536 recent clinical isolates. The MICs of RU 29246 for 90% of members of the family Enterobacteriaceae tested (MIC90s) were less than 2 micrograms/ml except those for Morganella spp. (16 micrograms/ml) and Proteus spp. (8 micrograms/ml). RU 29246 was active against Staphylococcus aureus (MIC90, < or = 8 micrograms/ml) and against Staphylococcus saprophyticus and coagulase-negative staphylococci (MIC90s, < or = 2 micrograms/ml). Streptococci and Neisseria gonorrhoeae were highly susceptible to RU 29246, and the activity of the agent against isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC90, < or = 0.5 micrograms/ml), Haemophilus influenzae (MIC90, < or = 2 micrograms/ml), and Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC90, < or = 2 micrograms/ml) was comparable to those of the other cephalosporins tested. RU 29246 was insusceptible to hydrolysis by the common plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases (TEM-1 and SHV-1). However, hydrolysis by the new extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (TEM-3, TEM-5, and TEM-9) was detected. Results of the study suggested that RU 29246 should be investigated clinically for use in the treatment of a wide range of infections.
TI  - Experimental studies of survival of anaerobic bacteria at 4 degrees C and 22 degrees C in two different transport systems.
AB  - The survival of anaerobic bacteria on swabs in two different transport systems at 4 degrees C and 22 degrees C was evaluated. The transport systems were a charcoal-impregnated cotton swab in modified Stuart transport medium (MST), and a viscose swab in modified SIFF transport medium (BTM) (Bionor). The following eight clinical strains of anaerobic bacteria were tested for quantitative recovery at 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, and 96 h; Fusobacterium necrophorum, Bacteroides melaninogenicus, Bacteroides intermedius, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Peptococcus magnus, Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium tetani, and Actinomyces israelii. Additionally, a mixture of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli was tested together with Bacteroides fragilis, Fusobacterium necrophorum and Clostridium perfringens. Both transport systems preserved the bacteria, but the BTM medium gave a better quantitative recovery of the bacteria than the MST in 29/64 (45%) of the experiments, whereas the opposite was the case in 15/64 (23%) of the experiments (p < 0.05). There was no significant strain-related difference between the recovery of 10 different B. fragilis strains. There was no major difference in the recovery of the anaerobes in the two systems at 4 degrees C compared to 22 degrees C, except for Fusobacterium necrophorum, which survived best at 4 degrees C in the Bionor transport system.
TI  - Serum and blister fluid pharmacokinetics and bactericidal activities of ampicillin-sulbactam, cefotetan, cefoxitin, ceftizoxime, and ticarcillin-clavulanate.
AB  - Ampicillin-sulbactam, ticarcillin-clavulanate, cefoxitin, cefotetan, and ceftizoxime are promoted for the treatment of mixed aerobic-anaerobic bacterial infections. Their activities have been compared in vitro but not in vivo. In order to assess the in vivo activities of these agents in serum and interstitial fluid, we administered single, intravenous doses of these antimicrobial agents to healthy subjects. Concentrations of the antimicrobial agents in serum and suction-induced blister fluid and bactericidal activity were measured by high-pressure liquid chromatography and the standard methodology of the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards, respectively. The organisms used for bactericidal activity tests were one isolate each of Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Bacteroides fragilis. Pharmacokinetic parameters in serum and blister fluid were similar to those derived in other investigations. Of note were the high and prolonged concentrations of ticarcillin and cefotetan in blister fluid, despite high-level serum protein binding. The bactericidal activities in serum and blister fluid reflected the relative in vitro activities and kinetic dispositions of the various antimicrobial agents except for the bactericidal activity of cefotetan, which was substantially lower in blister fluid than serum, despite a blister fluid:serum area under the concentration-time curve ratio of 1.5. Similarly, the activity of ticarcillin-clavulanate in blister fluid was also substantially less than would have been predicted by the blister fluid:serum ratio of the area under the concentration-time curve of 1.1, possibly because of the low concentrations of clavulanate in blister fluid. The rankings of the in vivo bactericidal activities of the five drugs were as follows: for S. aureus, ampicillin-sulbactam > ticarcillin-clavulanate > ceftizoxime > cefoxitin > cefotetan; for K. pneumoniae, ceftizoxime > cefotetan > ampicillin-sulbactam = ticarcillin-clavulanate > cefoxitin; and for B.fragilis, ticarcillin-clavulanate > cefotetan > ceftizoxime > ampicillin-sulbactam = cefoxitin.
TI  - A reassessment of the activity of the third-generation cephalosporins against anaerobes and Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - The in vitro activity of cefotaxime (CTX) alone and in combination with its metabolite desacetylcefotaxime (dCTX) was evaluated against 106 isolates of Bacteroides species. and 32 strains of Staphylococcus aureus. All strains were recovered from infected tissues of diabetic patients. Addition of dCTX to the parent compound markedly increased the inhibitory activity against Bacteroides species in general and Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides vulgatus in particular. No effect of the combination of both agents on Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron or Bacteroides ovatus was observed; 50% of B. fragilis infections were susceptible to CTX alone and 81% became susceptible to CTX plus dCTX. In addition, a partial synergistic interaction against 20 strains of B. fragilis resulted in a four- to nine-fold reduction in the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) after dCTX was added to CTX. Interestingly, 10 of 20 strains that exhibited an MIC of 64-128 micrograms/mL with CTX alone became very susceptible after the combination of parent and metabolite. This favorable positive interaction of both agents was also observed with S. aureus; a two- to four-fold reduction in MIC values was observed when dCTX was added.
TI  - Microbiology of secondarily infected diaper dermatitis.
AB  - Specimens obtained from 67 infants with secondarily infected diaper dermatitis were cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Bacteria growth was obtained in 58. Aerobic facultative bacteria or Candida sp. only were present in 28 patients (48%), anaerobic bacteria only in 11 (19%), and mixed anaerobic with aerobic, facultative, or yeast flora was present in 19 (33%). Ninety-one bacterial or fungal isolates were recovered (1.6 per specimen), 54 (0.9 per specimen) aerobic or facultative bacteria, 8 (0.1 per specimen) Candida sp., and 31 (0.6 per specimen) strict anaerobes. The predominant aerobic and facultative bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus (23 isolates), Streptococcus sp. (16), and Escherichia coli (6). The predominant anaerobes included Bacteroides sp. (12, including 9 Bacteroides fragilis group) and Peptostreptococcus sp. (11). Single bacterial isolates were recovered in 32 (55%) patients, 18 of which were S. aureus. Twenty-five beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were detected in 22 (51%) of the 43 tested patients. These included 16 S. aureus and 6 B. fragilis group. These data highlight the importance of anaerobic bacteria in the polymicrobial nature of secondarily infected diaper dermatitis.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of AM-1155, a new 6-fluoro-8-methoxy quinolone.
AB  - AM-1155 is a new quinolone with a wide spectrum of antibacterial activity against various bacteria including anaerobes and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. AM-1155 was 2- to 16-fold more active than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin against Staphylococcus aureus including methicillin-resistant strains, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Enterococcus faecalis; its MICs for 90% of strains tested were 0.10 to 0.78 micrograms/ml. The activity of AM-1155 was comparable to that of ciprofloxacin against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, but was fourfold less than that of ciprofloxacin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Against Xanthomonas maltophilia, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and Campylobacter jejuni, AM-1155 was two- to fourfold more active than ciprofloxacin. At a concentration of 1.56 micrograms/ml, AM-1155 inhibited 90% of Bacteroides fragilis strains tested; its activity was 8- to 10-fold higher than those of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. Development of resistance to AM-1155 in S. aureus and S. epidermidis occurred at a lower frequency than did that to ciprofloxacin after eight transfers in the presence of drug. In the oral treatment of mouse systemic infections, AM-1155 was four- to eightfold more effective than ciprofloxacin against gram-positive cocci and was as active as ciprofloxacin against gram-negative rods. The efficacy of an oral or a subcutaneous dose of AM-1155 was two- to fivefold greater than that of ofloxacin. Against experimental pneumonia with Klebsiella pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa, AM-1155 was two- to fourfold more active than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. AM-1155 also had good efficacy against mouse ascending urinary tract infections with Escherichia coli and P. aeruginosa. These results suggest that AM-1155 may be a potent antibacterial agent applicable to various infections.
TI  - In vitro activity of L-627, a new carbapenem.
AB  - The in vitro activity of L-627, a new parenterally administered carbapenem, was compared with those of imipenem, meropenem, FCE 22101 (a penem), ceftazidime, and ceftriaxone. L-627 was active against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae (MIC for 90% of strains tested [MIC90] ranging from 0.03 to 4 micrograms/ml). L-627 displayed activity equal to that of meropenem against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90, 2 micrograms/ml), although, as with other carbapenems, the antipseudomonal activity was reduced against D2-deficient strains. Staphylococci and streptococci were susceptible (MIC90 of 1.0 micrograms/ml for Staphylococcus aureus and 0.015 micrograms/ml for group A streptococci). L-627 also had activity against anaerobic bacteria (MIC90, 2.0 micrograms/ml for Bacteroides fragilis). Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Neisseria meningitidis were highly susceptible (MIC90, 0.06 micrograms/ml), and against the common respiratory pathogens (Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Moraxella catarrhalis), the MIC90s were less than or equal to 2.0 micrograms/ml. The protein binding of L-627 ranged from 13.8 to 22%, depending on the concentration. The presence of human serum had little effect on the MIC or MBC of L-627. These results suggest that L-627 merits further study in the treatment of infections caused by a wide range of pathogens.
TI  - In vitro activity of CP-74,667. A new fluoroquinolone compared with other quinolones.
AB  - CP-74,667, a 6-fluoro-7-bridged piperazinyl-1-cyclopropyl-4 quinolone, inhibited  90% of staphylococci, beta-hemolytic streptococci, enterococci, Enterobacteriaceae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml. Ciprofloxacin-resistant, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus had minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC50) of 4 micrograms/ml and an MIC90 of 8 micrograms/ml. CP-74,667 was fourfold more active than ciprofloxacin against Streptococcus pneumoniae and St. pyogenes, but equal or less active than tosufloxacin against Gram-positive species. The MIC90 for P. aeruginosa was 5 micrograms/ml similar to temafloxacin. The CP-74,667 MIC90 for Bacteroides fragilis was 2 micrograms/ml, equal to tosufloxacin and temafloxacin. Activity was eight- to 16-fold less at pH 5.5 compared with pH 7.4 and also eight- to 16-fold less in urine. Magnesium ions markedly increased the CP-74,667 minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs). The development of resistance to CP-74,667 was similar to that found for other fluoroquinolones.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of the new antibiotic vermisporin.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of vermisporin, a new antibiotic produced by fermentation of the fungus Ophiobolus vermisporis, was tested in vitro. Vermisporin inhibited 90% of Bacteroides fragilis and other Bacteroides spp. at 1 microgram/ml (range 0.25-1 micrograms/ml). Clostridium perfringens were inhibited by 1 microgram/ml (range 0.25-2 micrograms/ml). Vermisporin inhibited 90% of Staphylococcus aureus, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, at 0.5 micrograms/ml (range 0.12-0.5 micrograms/ml). Vermisporin MICs for group A, B, C, F and G streptococci were < 1 microgram/ml when tested in Haemophilus Test Medium but > or = 8 micrograms/ml in the presence of blood. Vermisporin MICs for Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Haemophilus influenzae exceeded 64 micrograms/ml. Inhibited organisms had MBCs 16- to 32-fold above the MICs.
TI  - The activity of metal compounds against aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - We evaluated the antimicrobial activity of two metal compounds, JM-1397 (OsO2[xylyl]2) and JM-2469 (AuCl[S2CPEt3]). Both inhibited methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus at concentrations of 0.5-2 micrograms/ml, with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC90) of 1 microgram/ml for JM-1397 and 0.5 microgram/ml for JM-2469. Similar concentrations inhibited methicillin-susceptible and -resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (S. epidermidis, S. haemolyticus, and S. saprophyticus). JM-2469 inhibited group A, B, C, F, and G beta-hemolytic streptococci and viridans group streptococci at 1-8 micrograms/ml (MIC90 4 micrograms/ml) but Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium had MICs of 8-16 micrograms/ml. JM-1397 had MICs for these organisms of greater than 64 micrograms/ml. Bacteroides fragilis, other Bacteroides, and Clostridium species were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.12-4 micrograms/ml (MIC90, 0.5 microgram/ml). MICs of both compounds for Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas spp. were greater than 64 micrograms/ml. These studies show that osmium and gold compounds have potential as topical agents against Gram-positive and anaerobic species.
TI  - In vitro activity of MC-352, a new 16-membered macrolide.
AB  - The in vitro activity of MC-352, 3,4'-dideoxy-5-O-mycaminosyltylonolide, was compared with those of erythromycin, clarithromycin, and rokitamycin. The MC-352 MIC90 (MIC for 90% of isolates) for erythromycin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis was less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, similar to those of the other agents. The MC-352 MIC50 for erythromycin-resistant S. aureus was 2 micrograms/ml, similar to that of rokitamycin. The MC-352 MIC90 (0.12 micrograms/ml) for Streptococcus pyogenes was similar to those of erythromycin and clarithromycin and superior to that of rokitamycin, and the MC-352 MIC90 for group B, C, and G streptococci was 0.25 microgram/ml. MC-352 and clarithromycin had an MIC90 of 0.12 microgram/ml for Streptococcus pneumoniae. Erythromycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis was inhibited by MC-352 at 1 microgram/ml, but the MIC for constitutively erythromycin-resistant isolates was greater than 16 micrograms/ml. Legionella pneumophila was inhibited by less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml. MC-352 was the most active agent against Bacteroides fragilis, with an MIC90 of 8 micrograms/ml, and was more active than the other agents against Haemophilus influenzae, with an MIC90 of 4 micrograms/ml. Moraxella spp. were inhibited by MC-352 at less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml. The MIC90 for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Salmonella, Shigella, Yersinia, Enterobacter, Citrobacter, and Serratia spp. was greater than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml. MC-352 was bactericidal for S. pyogenes and S. pneumoniae, and its activity was not altered by human serum.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activities of ticarcillin alone and ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid against beta-lactamase producing and non-producing microorganisms.
AB  - A total of 818 clinical bacterial isolates were tested for the production of beta-lactamase by rapid chromogenic cephalosporin method and for the susceptibility to ticarcillin alone and in combination with clavulanic acid (2 micrograms/mL) by agar dilution method. These included 83 strains of methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), 31 of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), 49 of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, 58 of Haemophilus influenzae, 112 of Escherichia coli, 118 of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 58 of Proteus mirabilis, 30 of Proteus vulgaris, 60 of Serratia marcescens, 113 of Enterobacter cloacae, 60 of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 46 of Bacteroides fragilis. The results revealed that 46.6% of P. mirabilis, 53.4% of H. influenzae, 57.1% of N. gonorrhoeae, 80% of P. vulgaris, 83.9% of MRSA, 85.6% of MSSA, 87.5% of E. coli, 91.7% of S. marcescens, 95.7% of B. fragilis, 98.2% of E. cloacae, and 100% of K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa strains produced beta-lactamase. In general, beta-lactamase nonproducers were more susceptible to ticarcillin than beta-lactamase producers. The ranges of minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of ticarcillin for beta-lactamase nonproducers of MSSA, MRSA, H. influenzae, E. coli, P. vulgaris, S. marcescens, E. cloacae, B. fragilis and beta-lactamase producers of MSSA, H. influenzae strains were all within the in vitro susceptible range. The presence of clavulanic acid resulted in a significant enhancement of the antibacterial activity of ticarcillin against beta-lactamase producers of MRSA, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis, P. vulgaris and B. fragilis strains. Clavulanic acid had no synergistic activity for ticarcillin against S. marcescens, P. aeruginosa and E. cloacae.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activities of ceftriaxone against clinically isolated strains].
AB  - Antibiotic activities (MICs) of ceftriaxone (CTRX) against 1,210 strains of bacteria including 28 spp. isolated in 1987 and 1990 were compared with those of other cephems. 1. When compared to data on clinically isolated strains reported in the early 1980s, strains of the following species isolated in 1990 showed extremely elevated MIC90s of CTRX: Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter spp., Enterobacter spp., Serratia spp., Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii and Providencia spp. No changes were observed in MIC90s between the 2 periods for microorganisms such as Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Peptostreptococcus spp. 2. The MIC90 of CTRX to S. pneumoniae was high because a large number of benzylpenicillin (PCG)-insensitive S. pneumoniae (PISP) was present among this species. The MIC80 to Bacteroides fragilis group was also high because highly resistant B. fragilis and B. thetaiotaomicron were isolated in large proportions among the bacteria of this group. Other oxime-type cephems also had high MICs against the above mentioned bacteria. Therefore, a further evaluation has to be made with regard to activities of oxime-type cephems such as CTRX against PISP and B. fragilis group. 3. Sample strains included, in high ratios, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), cephamycin-resistant as well as oxime-type cephem-resistant intestinal bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria, and new-quinolone-resistant bacteria. Some of there resistant bacteria are also CTRX-resistant, and CTRX had insufficient activities against them. 4. With regard to the assessment of changes of frequencies of specific drug-resistant bacteria, including those with CTRX-resistance from year to year, the authors would like to point out the following comment of theirs made in 1989 and 1991, which appears to be increasing its significance, "Subjects of future studies should include dose on the mechanisms for the acquisition of bacterial resistance to entire beta-lactam antibiotics and the social circumstances in which resistant bacteria appear". 5. It appears that those strains resistant to cephems including CTRX are increasingly found among clinically isolated strains in recent years. CTRX, however, was found still effective against most clinical pathogens. Furthermore, considering that CTRX is one of the few drugs which sustain high blood concentrations of active forms we concluded that CTRX is a useful cephem-group antibiotic.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of LJC 10,627.
AB  - The in vitro activity of LJC 10,627, a new carbapenem, was compared with those of imipenem, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and gentamicin. LJC 10,627 inhibited 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter agglomerans, Enterobacter cloacae, Hafnia alvei, Citrobacter freundii, Citrobacter diversus, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Proteus rettgeri, Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas cepacia, salmonellae, shigellae, aeromonas, and yersiniae at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml. Haemophilus influenzae was inhibited by 0.5 microgram/ml, and moraxellae were inhibited by 0.12 microgram/ml. LJC 10,627 was twofold more active than imipenem against aerobic gram-negative organisms and inhibited ceftazidime-, cefotaxime-, and gentamicin-resistant members of the genera Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Citrobacter, and Serratia at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml. Xanthomonas maltophilia strains were resistant to the drug. Imipenem was two- to fourfold more active than LJC 10,627 against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. LJC 10,627 did not inhibit most methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis strains. LJC 10,627 inhibited Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae at 0.06 and 0.12 microgram/ml, respectively. Bacteroides fragilis and other Bacteroides spp. were inhibited by 0.5 microgram of LJC 10,627 per ml. Serum (50%) did not affect the MICs. LJC 10,627 was not hydrolyzed by plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases of Bush types 2b, 2b', TEM-1, TEM-2, TEM-3, TEM-5, TEM-7, TEM-9, and SHV-1; the chromosomal beta-lactamases of Bush type 1; P-99; a Morganella enzyme; or a Citrobacter freundii enzyme. The Bush type 2c and 2d enzymes OXA-1, OXA-2, PSE-1, PSE-2, and PSE-4 did not hydrolyze LJC 10,627, nor did the beta-lactamases of Staphylococcus aureus, Moraxella spp., Bacteroides fragilis, and Proteus vulgaris. The beta-lactamase of Xanthomonas hydrolyzed LJC 10,627, albeit at approximately one-third the rate that imipenem was hydrolyzed.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of RU29246, the active metabolite of HR916B.
AB  - HR 916B is a new orally absorbed cephalosporin. In tests its active metabolite, RU29246, inhibited Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus pneumoniae at less than or equal to 0.12 micrograms/ml, which is similar to the antibacterial activity of cefuroxime, and was more active than cefaclor. It was also more active (MIC 2 micrograms/ml) than cefixime, cefuroxime, cefaclor and cefotaxime against staphylococci. RU29246 inhibited Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter diversus, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia stuartii and Salmonella spp. at less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, thus being more active than cefuroxime and cefaclor, but was less active than cefixime and cefotaxime. It did not inhibit Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other Pseudomonas spp., Enterobacter spp., Serratia marcescens or Bacteroides fragilis. RU29246 was not hydrolyzed by TEM-1, Staphylococcus aureus TEM-2 or Moraxella catarrhalis beta-lactamases, but was hydrolyzed by TEM-3 and the chromosomal beta-lactamases of Proteus vulgaris and Morganella morganii. Plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases were inhibited by RU29246.
TI  - The bacteriology of chronic suppurative otitis media.
AB  - Specimens obtained directly from the middle ear under direct vision from 40 patients with chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) were investigated quantitatively and qualitatively for aerobes and anaerobes. Twenty one of the 40 specimens yielded aerobes only, 17 yielded a mixed flora of anaerobes and aerobes while only one yielded anaerobes only and the remaining one was sterile. Bacteroides fragilis was the commonest anaerobe and the second single most common bacteria generally present in CSOM. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus were the dominant aerobic flora appearing in 17 and 14 out of 40 specimens respectively. All pathogens isolated were present in very high counts averaging 10(8) ml of the exudate. The use of systemic anti-anaerobic drug combined with an anti-aerobic drug is worthy of a clinical trial.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of DU-6859, a new potent fluoroquinolone, against clinical isolates.
AB  - DU-6859, (-)-7-[(7S)-amino-5-azaspiro(2,4)heptan-5-yl]-8-chloro-6- fluoro-1-[(1R,2R)-cis-2-fluoro-1-cyclopropyl]-1,4-dihydro-4-oxoquinol one-3- carboxylic acid, is a new fluoroquinolone with antibacterial activity which is significantly better than those of currently available quinolones. The MICs for 90% of methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis clinical isolates (MIC90s) were 0.1, 3.13, 0.1, and 0.39 microgram/ml, respectively. MIC50s of DU-6859 against quinolone-resistant, methicillin-resistant S. aureus were 8-, 32-, 64-, and 128-fold lower than those of tosufloxacin and sparfloxacin, ofloxacin and fleroxacin, ciprofloxacin, and lomefloxacin, respectively. DU-6859 inhibited the growth of all strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes at 0.1 and 0.2 microgram/ml, respectively, and was more active against enterococci than the other quinolones tested. Although the activity of DU-6859 against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was roughly comparable to that of ciprofloxacin at the MIC50 level, it was fourfold more active than ciprofloxacin at the MIC90 level. DU-6859 was also more active against other glucose-nonfermenting bacteria, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, than the other drugs tested. Strains of Bacteroides fragilis and Peptostreptococcus spp. were susceptible to DU-6859; MIC90s were 0.39 and 0.2 microgram/ml, respectively. DU-6859 generally showed activities twofold or greater than those of ciprofloxacin and the other drugs against almost all members of the family Enterobacteriaceae. The action of DU-6859 against the clinical isolates was bactericidal at concentrations near the MICs. DU-6859 activity was not affected by different media, pH, inoculum size, or human serum but was decreased in human urine.
TI  - In vitro activity of OPC-17116.
AB  - The in vitro activity of OPC-17116, a new C-5 methyl fluoroquinolone, was compared with the activities of other fluoroquinolones. OPC-17116 inhibited 50% of the members of the family Enterobacteriaceae tested and 90% of Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria species, and Moraxella catarrhalis isolates at less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml. At less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, 90% of the Enterobacteriaceae were inhibited, which was comparable to or better than the activities of fleroxacin, ofloxacin, and lomefloxacin but less than the activity of ciprofloxacin. OPC-17116 inhibited 90% of the staphylococci tested at less than or equal to 0.25 micrograms/ml, but it did not inhibit methicillin-resistant, ciprofloxacin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or Staphylococcus epidermidis. Group A, B, C, F, and G streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.5 microgram/ml, being four-fold more active than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. Tosufloxacin was the most active agent tested against gram-positive cocci. OPC-17116 inhibited Bacteroides fragilis at 4 micrograms/ml. There was a minimal effect of inoculum size on MIC, and the MBCs were within 1 dilution of the MICs. The activity of OPC-17116 was decreased at pH 6 and in the presence of high Mg2+ concentrations, but it was unaffected by human serum. OPC-17116 showed a postantibiotic effect against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus similar to the postantibiotic effects reported for other fluoroquinolones. The frequency of spontaneous single-step resistance was low (less than 10(-9)), but repeated passage of organisms in the presence of OPC-17116 resulted in the selection of resistant isolates.
TI  - Pharmacokinetics and tissue penetration of single-dose cefotetan used for antimicrobial prophylaxis in patients undergoing colorectal surgery.
AB  - The pharmacokinetics and tissue penetration of cefotetan were studied after a single injection of 2 g given intravenously for antimicrobial prophylaxis to 16 consecutive patients undergoing colorectal surgery. Concentrations in tissue greater than or equal to the MIC for 90% of the main pathogens tested were considered adequate. The elimination half-life at beta phase was 4.6 +/- 1.4 h, the total body clearance was 0.75 +/- 0.19 ml/kg/min, and the volume of distribution was 260 +/- 71 ml/kg. At the time of incision (33 +/- 16 min after the injection), cefotetan concentrations were 14.2 +/- 7 micrograms/g in abdominal-wall fat, 16.4 +/- 1 micrograms/g in epiploic fat, and 163 +/- 62 mg/liter in serum. At the time of surgical anastomosis (151 +/- 54 min), cefotetan concentrations were 33.3 +/- 6 micrograms/g in the colonic wall and 73 +/- 34 mg/liter in serum. Upon closure of the abdomen (216 +/- 76 min), cefotetan concentrations were 6.3 +/- 3 micrograms/g in abdominal-wall fat, 6.1 +/- 4 micrograms/g in epiploic fat, and 64 +/- 38 mg/liter in serum. Cefotetan tissue penetration was 10% into abdominal and epiploic fat and 46% into the colonic wall. Levels in tissue were compared with the MIC for 90% of the most frequently encountered pathogenic germs (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacteroides fragilis, and Escherichia coli). Adequate concentrations in tissue were obtained up to anastomosis but not upon closure. The authors therefore recommend the injection of an additional dose of 1 g before closure in order to ensure optimal efficacy throughout the surgical procedure.
TI  - In-vitro activity of PD 131628, a new quinolone antimicrobial agent.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of PD 131628, the active metabolite of the prodrug PD 131112, was compared with that of ciprofloxacin and members of other groups of antimicrobial agents against 701 recent clinical isolates and strains with known mechanisms of resistance. The MIC90s of PD 131628 against the Enterobacteriaceae were between 0.008 and 0.5 mg/L; PD 131628 was one- to four-fold more active than ciprofloxacin against these strains and was four-fold more active than ciprofloxacin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Against the Gram-positive species tested, PD 131628 was two- to four-fold more active than ciprofloxacin, inhibiting all strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae with 0.5 mg/L or less. PD 131628 was very active against Neisseria spp., Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis, with MIC90s ranging from 0.004 to 0.008 mg/L. Organisms with decreased susceptibility to other quinolones had decreased susceptibility to PD 131628, but there was no cross-resistance between this class of antimicrobial and other classes. The protein binding of PD 131628 was at most 25% across a broad range of concentrations. The addition of 70% human serum had little effect on the MICs, but caused a two- to eight-fold increase in MBCs.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of levofloxacin (l-ofloxacin), an optically active ofloxacin.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of levofloxacin was compared with those of ofloxacin,  ciprofloxacin, and other antibiotics. In general, levofloxacin was equally active or up to fourfold more active than ofloxacin against all 801 organisms tested. Levofloxacin was twofold [corrected] more active than ciprofloxacin against Streptococcus pneumoniae and 2- to 4-fold more active than ciprofloxacin against Staphylococcus aureus, Xanthomonas maltophilia, and Bacteroides fragilis. Levofloxacin was two- to eightfold more active than ciprofloxacin against coagulase-negative staphylococci and Acinetobacter spp., although these improvements in potency may not be clinically relevant. Levofloxacin inhibited 90% of streptococci when it was used at concentrations of 1 to 2 micrograms/ml. Levofloxacin was two- to fourfold less active than ciprofloxacin against most members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, such as Escherichia coli; Klebsiella pneumoniae; Citrobacter, Proteus, Providencia, Salmonella, and Yersinia spp.; and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Both compounds were equally active against Pseudomonas cepacia. The in vitro DNA gyrase inhibitory activity of levofloxacin was as potent as that of ciprofloxacin, with a 50% inhibitory concentration of 0.65 micrograms/ml against an E. coli enzyme. In vivo, oral treatment with levofloxacin was as efficacious or more efficacious than that with ciprofloxacin in systemic as well as pyelonephritis infections in mice. Levofloxacin achieved higher concentrations in the serum and tissue of mice than did ciprofloxacin. This study presents some potential advantages of the pure L isomer of ofloxacin over ciprofloxacin and other quinolones.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of E1077, a new cephalosporin with a broad antibacterial spectrum.
AB  - E1077 is a novel parenteral cephalosporin with a wide spectrum of potent antibacterial activity against aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, E1077 was twice as active as cefpirome, with an MIC for 90% of strains tested (MIC90) of 0.78 micrograms/ml. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus was moderately to highly resistant to E1077, but E1077 was at least twice as active as other beta-lactams tested. Against Enterococcus faecalis, E1077 was the most active of the cephalosporins tested (MIC90, 12.5 micrograms/ml) and was at least fourfold more active than cefpirome and ceftazidime. At concentrations of less than or equal to 0.78 micrograms/ml, E1077 inhibited 90% of streptococci and most of the members of the family Enterobacteriaceae tested, with the exceptions of Serratia marcescens and Proteus vulgaris, for which the MIC90s of E1077 were both 3.13 micrograms/ml. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, E1077 was two- to fourfold more active than cefpirome and ceftazidime. For the anaerobes, E1077 was as active against Bacteroides fragilis as was cefuzonam, and its activity was fourfold higher than those of cefpirome and ceftazidime. E1077 was at least as resistant as cefpirome to hydrolysis by various beta-lactamases, and these enzymes had a low affinity for E1077.
TI  - Platelet-activating factor modulates endotoxin-induced macrophage procoagulant activity by a protein kinase C-dependent mechanism.
AB  - Macrophage procoagulant activity is an important mediator of extravascular fibrin deposition at sites of infection and appears to contribute to the pathogenesis of several infectious disease processes. Previous studies have shown that the inflammatory mediator platelet-activating factor was able to prime macrophages for induction of procoagulant activity by bacterial lipopolysaccharide. The present studies were designed to examine the mechanism of this priming effect. Platelet-activating factor (100 nM) primed macrophages for procoagulant activity generation in response to endotoxin at concentrations as low as 100 ng/ml and also following exposure to Escherichia coli, Bacteroides fragilis, and Staphylococcus aureus. The priming effect occurred following a pretreatment with platelet-activating factor for as short as 1 min, suggesting a rapid activation event. Two different doses of the calcium ionophore ionomycin were used to mimic the peak and sustained effects of platelet-activating factor on cytoplasmic calcium levels (1 microM and 100 nM, respectively). Neither dose was able to mimic the priming effect. However, extracellular calcium was necessary for induction of procoagulant activity and the priming effect. By contrast, the protein kinase C agonist phorbol myristate acetate reproduced the priming phenomenon observed for platelet-activating factor. In further support of the concept that protein kinase C activation mediated the effect of platelet-activating factor, the specific protein kinase C inhibitor staurosporine reversed the ability of platelet-activating factor to augment induction of macrophage procoagulant activity by endotoxin. These data suggest mechanisms by which inflammatory mediators within the microenvironment of infection might modulate the host response to bacterial pathogens.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents, 1989. A study mainly focused on imipenem. The Research Group for Testing Imipenem Susceptibilities of Clinical Isolates].
AB  - We investigated susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (IPM) and other antimicrobial agents at hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1989. The susceptibility testing was carried out according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc technique in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: (+++), (++), (+) and (-). IPM showed markedly high in vitro activities against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Bacteroides fragilis and had rather strong activities against Enterococcus faecalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Achromobacter xylosoxidans, but was less active to Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci and Xanthomonas maltophilia. IPM has been found to have activities superior to those of other antibiotics tested against E. faecalis, E. cloacae, C. freundii, S. marcescens, P. aeruginosa and B. fragilis. No antibiotics tested showed good activities against MRSA except minocycline.
TI  - Antimicrobial activities of piperacillin alone and in combination with tazobactam against beta-lactamase-producing bacteria.
AB  - Tazobactam (YTR 830), a new beta-lactamase inhibitor, was evaluated for its effect in combination with piperacillin, a broad spectrum, but beta-lactamase sensitive, penicillin, against 14 common bacteria. A total of 1,086 clinical isolates from different clinical specimens were tested for beta-lactamase production by the rapid chromogenic cephalosporin method. Their susceptibilities to piperacillin alone and in combination with tazobactam in a ratio of 8:1 by the agar dilution method were evaluated. The percentage of beta-lactamase producing strains ranged from 14.5% to 100% in these tested species. In general, the beta-lactamase producers were more resistant to piperacillin than the beta-lactamase nonproducers with higher minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs). For the beta-lactamase producers, tazobactam decreased the MICs of piperacillin prominently in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Salmonella species and Bacteroides fragilis, with a 4-fold or greater decrease in MIC50, MIC90 and the geometric mean of MIC. For Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the MICs did not change after adding tazobactam. For other species, there was a moderate decrease in MICs. We conclude that tazobactam is an effective beta-lactamase inhibitor for increasing the antimicrobial activity of piperacillin against beta-lactamase producing strains of many species of bacteria.
TI  - Antiseptic effectiveness with fibroblast preservation.
AB  - The efficacy of topical antiseptic therapy for wounds and skin ulcers has been shown to be at the expense of fibroblast and leukocyte function and, in general, wound healing. Specifically, continued fibroblast function after exposure to antiseptics has been correlated to the concentration of the antiseptic. At concentrations that preserve fibroblast function, 0.005% sodium hypochlorite, 0.001% providone-iodine, 0.0025% acetic acid, and 0.003% hydrogen peroxide were tested for their effectiveness against various clinical isolates. Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Group D enterococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Bacteroides fragilis were exposed to the antiseptics and plated in a standard microbiological fashion. The cultures showed that sodium hypochlorite inhibited the growth of all the bacteria (p less than 0.001), whereas povidone-iodine reduced the colonies of S. aureus and acetic acid inhibited P. aeruginosa. Our study suggests that 0.005% sodium hypochlorite can be used as a debriding and topical antibacterial agent for wounds and skin ulcers without inhibiting fibroblast activity essential to normal wound repair.
TI  - In vitro activity evaluations of cefdinir (FK482, CI-983, and PD134393). A novel  orally administered cephalosporin.
AB  - Cefdinir, a so-called third-generation oral cephalosporin was tested in vitro against over 700 pathogens from patients with bacteremia. Cefdinir was very active against the Enterobacteriaceae with a 50% minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC50) value range of less than or equal to 0.03-8 micrograms/ml. The enteric species having the highest MIC90S (greater than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml) were Citrobacter freundii, and the enterobacters, Morganella morganii, Proteus vulgaris, and Serratia marcescens. Cefdinir was generally two- to fourfold less active than cefixime, but markedly more potent with a wider spectrum compared with older oral cephalosporins, cefaclor or cefuroxime. In contrast to cefixime, cefdinir inhibited Staphylococcus aureus (MIC90, 1 micrograms/ml) and other staphylococci. Pneumococci, beta-hemolytic streptococci, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and pathogenic Neisseria spp. (MIC90S, 0.12-0.5 micrograms/ml) were cefdinir susceptible, but Pseudomonas aeruginosa, oxacillin-resistant staphylococci and Bacteroides fragilis gr. strains were resistant. Cefdinir was generally bactericidal with a minimal inoculum effect at 10(6) colony-forming units per spot. Cefdinir beta-lactamase hydrolysis by some recently described extended broad spectrum beta-lactamases was suspected. Cefdinir exhibited a wide, balanced spectrum for an oral cephalosporin indicating possible clinical use against susceptible pathogens in respiratory tract, urinary tract, genital and cutaneous infections.
TI  - A comparison of the in-vitro activity of clarithromycin, a new macrolide antibiotic, with erythromycin and other oral agents.
AB  - On the basis of minimum inhibitory concentrations clarithromycin (6-O-methylerythromycin), a new macrolide, was found to be slightly more active than erythromycin against Staphylococcus aureus, enterococci. Moraxella catarrhalis, Gardnerella vaginalis, Bacteroides fragilis (sensu stricto) and B. ureolyticus and slightly less active against coagulase-negative staphylococci, alpha- and beta-haemolytic streptococci, Haemophilus influenzae, Campylobacter coli/jejuni and the B. melaninogenicus/oralis groups. There was complete cross-resistance between the two agents. Reports of potentiation of the activity against Haemophilus influenzae of clarithromycin by its own metabolite and by human serum appear to operate in vivo, and therefore the new agent shows great promise, especially for the treatment of respiratory tract infections.
TI  - Antibacterial activities of amoxicillin alone and in combination with clavulanic  acid correlated with beta-lactamase production.
AB  - Amoxicillin, a beta-lactam antibiotic, was tested for its effect in combination with clavulanic acid, a beta-lactamase inhibitor, against 9 species of bacteria isolated from clinical specimens. A total of 698 strains of bacteria were tested for beta-lactamase production by the rapid chromogenic cephalosporin method. Their susceptibilities to amoxicillin alone and in combination with clavulanic acid were tested by the agar dilution method. The percentage of beta-lactamase producing strains ranged from 46.6% in Proteus mirabilis to 100% in Klebsiella pneumoniac. In general, beta-lactamase nonproducers were more susceptible to amoxicillin than beta-lactamase producers. For beta-lactamase producers, clavulanic acid decreased the MICs of amoxicillin prominently in strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, K. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis, Enterobacter cloacae and Bacteroides fragilis, when combining clavulanic acid with amoxicillin in the ratio of 1:2. Their MIC50s, MIC90s and geometric means of MICs all decreased 4 folds or greater. For beta-lactamase non-producing strains, the MICs did not show significant differences by adding clavulanic acid in most species we tested, including methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, N. gonorrhoeae, H. influenzae, Proteus vulgaris and E. cloacae.
TI  - In vitro activity of the novel cephalosporin GR69153.
AB  - The in vitro activity of GR69153 was compared to that of ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, imipenem and gentamicin against a total of 702 recent clinical isolates. MICs were determined by a standard agar dilution procedure and two inocula (10(4) and 10(8) cfu) were used throughout. GR69153 inhibited 90% of isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia and Proteus mirabilis at less than or equal to 0.25 mg/l and 90% of isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa at less than or equal to 1 mg/l. Citrobacter freundii (MIC90 16 mg/l), Morganella morganii (MIC90 128 mg/l) and Enterobacter spp. (MIC90 greater than 128 mg/l) were considerably more resistant to GR69153. GR69153 was four-fold more active than ceftazidime against methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus but was inactive against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis and Bacteroides fragilis group.
TI  - Autologous fibrin gel: bactericidal properties in contaminated hepatic injury.
AB  - Fibrin glue is an effective hemostatic agent in a variety of clinical situations; its utility is limited by potential transmission of viral infection. We studied the bactericidal properties of fibrin gel (FG) in a murine contaminated hepatic injury model and in vitro by agar plate culture method. Intra-abdominal abscess formation and adhesion rate were assessed following controlled liver injury in association with abdominal contamination with 10(7) Bacteroides fragilis and hepatorrhaphy (H, n = 15) or FG (n = 12). Animals treated by hepatorrhaphy had a significantly greater intra-abdominal abscess rate (15/15 vs. 4/12, p less than 0.05) and adhesion rate (14/15 vs. 6/12, p less than 0.05) than animals treated with FG. Fibrin gel is bactericidal to Bacteroides fragilis, Enterobacter faecium, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus but has no effect against Klebsiella pneumoniae or Pseudomonas aeruginosa; the plasma component appears active. Fibrin gel demonstrates significant improvement in adhesion formation and intra-abdominal abscess rate when compared with suture hepatorrhaphy. Fibrin gel appears protective in contaminated hepatic injury.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of E-1040, a novel thiadiazolyl cephalosporin compared with other parenteral cephems.
AB  - E-1040, a new parenteral fourth-generation cephalosporin, was tested against greater than 600 bacteremic pathogens and compared with cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and cefpirome. E-1040 activity against Staphylococcus aureus was comparable (MIC90, 8 micrograms/ml) to ceftazidime, but inferior to cefotaxime (MIC90, 2 micrograms/ml) and cefpirome (MIC90, 0.5 microgram/ml). beta-Hemolytic streptococci and most Gram-positive anaerobes were also susceptible to E-1040. Some strains of coagulase-negative staphylococci, all oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus spp., enterococci, and Bacteroides fragilis group strains were resistant to E-1040 (MIC90, greater than 64 micrograms/ml). Comparative tests for E-1040 and the three other cephalosporins against pseudomonads and nonenteric Gram-negative bacilli showed E-1040 to be generally most active. The E-1040 MIC90 for Pseudomonas aeruginosa was 1 microgram/ml and for ceftazidime it was 4 micrograms/ml. Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Neisseria spp. has E-1040 MIC90s ranging from 0.12 to 2 micrograms/ml. Neisseria gonorrhoeae, strains resistant to penicillin, did not have markedly elevated E-1040 MICs compared with penicillin-susceptible strains. Enterobacteriaceae species had all MICs of less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml for E-1040 and cefpirome, indicating activity against strains producing stably derepressed beta-lactamases. E-1040 appeared to be beta-lactamase stable, little influenced by testing systems or media, and was bactericidal. E-1040 seems to have promise as a parenteral beta-lactam for use on strains resistant to "third-generation" cephalosporins and other families of drugs such as aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones.
TI  - Management of infected aortoiliac aneurysms.
AB  - A 30-year retrospective review identified 13 patients treated for infected aneurysms of the abdominal aorta or iliac arteries, for an overall incidence of 0.65%. A constellation of clinical findings led to the correct preoperative diagnosis in 11 (85%) of 13 patients. Treatment methods included resection and in situ replacement grafting in seven patients, resection and extra-anatomic bypass in five patients, and resection-ligation in one patient. Four (31%) of 13 patients died within 30 days of operation, three of whom died of rupture. Overall, good results were achieved in five patients (38%), while poor results were noted in the remaining eight patients (62%). The determinants of outcome were aneurysm location or rupture, the presence of established infection, and the virulence of the infecting organism. In 10 (77%) of the 13 aneurysms, Salmonella species, Bacteroides fragilis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa accounted for all deaths, ruptures, and suprarenal aneurysm infections. These data suggest that patients with primary infections of the abdominal aorta or iliac arteries continue to present with advanced infections or aneurysm rupture that result in a high mortality.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of GR69153, a novel catechol-substituted cephalosporin.
AB  - GR69153 is a C-7 catechol cephalosporin with a broad spectrum of activity against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae (MICs for 50% of strains tested [MIC50s], 0.008 to 0.5 micrograms/ml), Staphylococcus aureus (MIC50, 4 micrograms/ml), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC50, 0.25 micrograms/ml), Haemophilus influenzae (MIC50, 0.03 micrograms/ml), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (MIC50, 0.03 micrograms/ml), and Acinetobacter spp. (MIC50, 2 micrograms/ml). Potent GR69153 activity was also demonstrated against Moraxella catarrhalis, pneumococci, beta-hemolytic streptococci, gram-positive anaerobes, and most species of coagulase-negative staphylococci. The activity of GR69153 was generally two- to fourfold greater than that of ceftazidime. Resistance level GR69153 MICs for 90% of strains tested (greater than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml) were found most often among Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter spp. and Morganella morganii strains. GR69153 did not significantly inhibit enterococci, Xanthomonas maltophilia, the Bacteroides fragilis group, Corynebacterium jeikeium, or Listeria monocytogenes. GR69153 was bactericidal and was generally beta-lactamase stable, and MICs were only slightly increased by high inoculum concentrations. Activity was enhanced in an iron-deficient medium, and a modest MIC difference attributed to iron availability was noted between standard agar and broth test results. GR69153 was confirmed to be a potent, catechol-substituted cephalosporin with a spectrum slightly wider than that of ceftazidime, but it was less active than cefpirome or imipenem against some gram-positive pathogens and anaerobes.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of trospectomycin (U-63,366F) against anaerobic bacteria and aerobic gram-positive cocci in Chile.
AB  - The in vitro activity of trospectomycin sulfate was compared with those of several antimicrobials, against 301 anaerobic bacteria and 613 aerobic Gram-positive cocci. Trospectomycin was about 4- to 32-fold more active than was spectinomycin. Trospectomycin exhibited consistently good activity against all Bacteroides fragilis group isolates, except Bacteroides vulgatus, and against all other anaerobes comparable or higher to that of clindamycin. The trospectomycin's activity was most similar to that of vancomycin, even against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis.
TI  - Synergy and antagonism of combinations with quinolones.
AB  - Combinations of fluoroquinolones with other antimicrobial agents have been extensively investigated. Combinations of fluoroquinolones with aminoglycosides, beta-lactams, imidazoles, macrolides and clindamycin infrequently show synergy against Enterobacteriaceae and gram-positive bacteria. These combinations rarely show antagonism. Combinations of rifampin with fluoroquinolones tested against Staphylococcus aureus have been reported to show synergy and antagonism, and in vitro results have not correlated with results of animal infection experiments. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa combinations of antipseudomonas penicillins or imipenem with fluoroquinolones are synergistic for 20% to 50% of isolates in vitro and also are synergistic in animal models of infection, whereas combinations of aminoglycosides with fluoroquinolones rarely show synergy against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Against anaerobic species such as Bacteroides fragilis combinations of fluoroquinolones with clindamycin, anti-anaerobic penicillins, cephalosporins or imidazoles are occasionally synergistic but usually indifferent. Ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin combined with antituberculosis agents have activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis and atypical mycobacteria. In general, fluoroquinolones should be combined with other agents not to achieve synergy, which is extremely variable, but to provide activity against bacteria inadequately inhibited by the fluoroquinolones.
TI  - Bacteriology of diabetic foot ulcers.
AB  - Seventy five diabetic foot ulcers were cultured using optimal aerobic and anaerobic microbiologic techniques. There were a total of 223 isolates (162 aerobes and 61 anaerobes) representing an average of 2.97 bacterial species per specimen. Mixed organisms were the most common isolates. Staphylococcus aureus was the commonest isolate being recovered in 60% of cases. Anaerobic organisms were isolated in 46 patients (61.33%) and the most frequent anaerobe isolated was Bacteroides fragilis. The other organisms predominantly isolated were Proteus, Klebsiella, Pseudomonas, Peptoccus and Clostridia. Antibiogram showed discouraging pattern with commonly used antibiotics. Metronidazole and gentamicin were the most effective antimicrobial agents against anaerobic and aerobic organisms respectively. Appreciation of the causative organisms in diabetic foot and their antibiotic sensitivity is essential for institution of appropriate antibiotic therapy.
TI  - In vitro activity of sparfloxacin.
AB  - Sparfloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, inhibited the majority of members of the family Enterobacteriaceae at less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml. It was less active than ciprofloxacin but more active than ofloxacin. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, it was less active than ciprofloxacin but twofold more active than ofloxacin. It inhibited Staphylococcus aureus and most Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes isolates at 0.25 micrograms/ml, whereas ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin inhibited these isolates at 2 micrograms/ml. Bacteroides fragilis was inhibited by less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml. Sparfloxacin was less active at an acidic pH and in the presence of Mg2+. Resistance to sparfloxacin was produced by repeated exposure, although the frequency of single-step mutants was less than 10(-9).
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of E-4497, a new 3-amine-3-methyl-azetidinyl tricyclic fluoroquinolone.
AB  - The in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of a new tricyclic fluoroquinolone, E-4497 [S(-)-9-fluoro-3-methyl-10-(3-amine-3-methyl-azetidin-1-yl)-7-oxo- 2,3-dihydro- 7H-pyrido-(1,2,3-de)-1,4-benzoxazine-6-carboxylic acid], were evaluated in comparison with those of DR-3355 [S-(-)-ofloxacin], norfloxacin, and ciprofloxacin. E-4497 was more potent than norfloxacin and as potent as or more potent than DR-3355 and ciprofloxacin against Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus spp., and Enterococcus faecalis. With the exception of Providencia spp., E-4497 inhibited 90% of the Enterobacteriaceae at less than or equal to 0.25 micrograms/ml. Against enteric bacteria, E-4497 was similar in potency to norfloxacin but less potent than DR-3355 and ciprofloxacin. For Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the MICs of E-4497, DR-3355, norfloxacin, and ciprofloxacin for 90% of strains were 2, 2, 4, and 0.5 micrograms/ml, respectively. Against Clostridium perfringens and Bacteroides fragilis, E-4497 (MICs for 90% of strains, 2 and 8 micrograms/ml, respectively) was two- to fourfold more active than norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin. E-4497 activity decreased moderately in the presence of 10 mM Mg2+. Urine at pH 5.5 caused a significant decrease in activity compared with urine at pH 7.2. However, the presence of serum either had no effect or increased the activity of E-4497. In general, E-4497 was bactericidal at the MIC. In systemic infections with Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in mice, the protective effect of E-4497 was generally greater than that of norfloxacin and comparable to those of DR-3355 and ciprofloxacin.
TI  - Activities of two new teicoplanin amide derivatives (MDL 62211 and MDL 62873) compared with activities of teicoplanin and vancomycin against 800 recent staphylococcal isolates from France and the United States.
AB  - MDL 62211 is the amide derivative of the teicoplanin complex and MDL 62873 is a more focused amide derivative of the teicoplanin A2-2 peak. Each investigational compound had nearly identical activity and was 2- to 16-fold more active than teicoplanin or vancomycin. The MDL 62873 MICs for 90% of the strains tested were as follows: Staphylococcus aureus, oxacillin susceptible, 0.12 micrograms/ml; S. aureus, oxacillin resistant, 0.25 micrograms/ml; coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), oxacillin susceptible, 0.25 micrograms/ml; and CNS, oxacillin resistant, 2 micrograms/ml. CNS isolates from France were generally more susceptible than those tested in the United States. Teicoplanin-resistant U.S. isolates were usually Staphylococcus haemolyticus (1.8% of all tested strains), for which MICs ranged from 32 to greater than 128 micrograms/ml. MDL 62873 was not active against the Bacteroides fragilis group but was generally effective against gram-positive anaerobic strains.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of ciprofloxacin against fresh clinical isolates from superficial suppurative foci].
AB  - The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 5 drugs (ciprofloxacin (CPFX), and 4 drugs used as standard) were determined to investigate antibacterial potencies of CPFX against bacterial strains isolated in 1989 from superficial suppurative foci. The clinical isolates tested included 375 strains from 11 aerobic bacterial species, and 50 strains from 2 anerobic bacterial genera (group) for a total of 425 isolates. Interpreting MIC level distributions of these drugs as the expression of antibacterial potencies, the results are as follows. 1. When activities of new-quinolone antibiotics were tested, we found that, CPFX expressed far superior antibacterial potency to ofloxacin (OFLX) and norfloxacin (NFLX) against coagulase-negative staphylococci, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Peptostreptococcus spp., although the activity of CPFX against Bacteroides fragilis group was weaker than that of OFLX, and CPFX had similar activity against Staphylococcus aureus to OFLX. 2. In comparison to beta-lactam antibiotics, CPFX was inferior to amoxicillin (AMPC) against E. faecalis and inferior to AMPC and cefaclor (CCL) against Peptostreptococcus spp. Against all other bacterial species, however, CPFX expressed superior antibacterial potency to AMPC and CCL. 3. Scattered findings of low sensitivity or resistance to CPFX were observed among the S. aureus, E. faecalis, E. faecium, P. vulgaris, M. morganii, P. aeruginosa and B. fragilis (group) species, but with an exception of E. faecium, the incidence of resistance strains was low.
TI  - Microbiological studies of decubitus ulcers in children.
AB  - Specimens from 58 children with decubitus ulcers were cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Aerobic bacteria only were present in 29 (50%) ulcers, anaerobic bacteria only were recovered in 5 (9%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora were present in 24 (41%). A total of 132 isolates (79 aerobes, 53 anaerobes) were recovered, an average of 2.3 isolates per specimen (1.4 aerobes, 0.9 anaerobes). The smallest number of isolates was recovered in ulcers of the skull (1.7 per site), and the highest number of isolates was found in ulcers of the buttocks (4.1 per site). The predominant isolates were Staphylococcus aureus (25 isolates), Peptostreptococcus species (22), Bacteroides fragilis group (10), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7). Forty-two of the organisms isolated from 38 (66%) patients produced the enzyme beta-lactamase. Most of the S aureus isolates were recovered from ulcers of the hand and the leg. Organisms that resided in the mucous membranes close to the ulcer predominated in the wounds next to these areas. Enteric gram-negative rods, group D streptococci, and B fragilis group predominated in ulcers of the buttocks. Group A streptococci, Haemophilus influenzae, Bacteroides melaninogenicus group, and Fusobacterium species were most frequently recovered in ulcers of the skull. The polymicrobial etiology of decubitus ulcers in hospitalized children and the association of bacterial flora with the anatomical site of the ulcer are demonstrated.
TI  - Bacterial killing in vitro by abscess-derived neutrophils.
AB  - In the absence of antimicrobial therapy, bacteria such as Bacteriodes fragilis, Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis may persist within an intra-abdominal abscess in the presence of large numbers of neutrophils which, under optimal conditions in vitro, can readily phagocytose and kill the same bacterial strains. Neutrophils taken from abscesses induced by gram-negative bacteria such as those above contain viable organisms. On incubation in vitro in the presence of serum, these neutrophils kill the bacteria phagocytosed in the abscess poorly, if at all, yet can readily kill organisms added in vitro. To determine possible mechanisms that might explain this, we examined the bactericidal activity in vitro of neutrophils from a range of abscesses induced by one or two species of bacteria plus an abscess-potentiating agent, bran. The organisms studied were B. fragilis, E. coli, P. mirabilis and Staphylococcus aureus. The killing in vitro of E. coli and P. mirabilis, engulfed within an abscess, was significantly less than that of the same organisms when they were added to the in-vitro assay. In contrast, the killing of S. aureus was similar, whether engulfed in vivo or in vitro. However, S. aureus was less susceptible to phagocytosis and killing in vitro than P. mirabilis or E. coli, and the killing of S. aureus during in-vitro incubation of neutrophils that had engulfed the organism with in the abscess was similar to that of the gram-negative bacteria engulfed within the abscess.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic microbiologic factors and recovery of beta-lactamase producing bacteria from obstetric and gynecologic infection.
AB  - Specimens obtained from 736 patients with obstetric and gynecologic infections were studied for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Bacterial growth was present in 714 specimens. These included 53 specimens of infected fallopian tubes, 470 of infected endometrium, 94 of infected amniotic fluid, 57 of aspirates of cul-de-sacs in instances of pelvic inflammatory disease, 14 labial and vaginal abscesses and 26 of Bartholyn's cyst abscess. A total of 2,052 isolates (2.9 per specimen), 1,139 anaerobes (1.6 per specimen) and 913 aerobic or facultative (1.3 per specimen) were recovered. The most commonly isolated anaerobic bacteria was Bacteroides species (566 isolates), which included Bacteroides bivius (151), Bacteroides fragilis group (130), Bacteroides melaninogenicus group (110) and Bacteroides ureolyticus (47). Others included an anaerobic gram-positive cocci (391), Clostridium species (48) and Fusobacterium species (36). The most frequently recovered aerobic and facultative bacteria were Lactobacillus species (169), Escherichia coli (85), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (62), Staphylococcus aureus (59) and Group B streptococcus (55). Three hundred and sixty-five (18 per cent) of the isolates recovered from 276 (39 per cent) patients were beta-lactamase producing organisms (BLPO); 222 (61 per cent) anaerobes and 143 (39 per cent) aerobes or facultatives. The most common BLPO were B. fragilis group, B. bivius, B. melaninogenicus, B. disiens, Enterobacteriaceae and S. aureus. These data illustrate the polymicrobial nature and important role of BLPO in obstetric and gynecologic infection.
TI  - Antibiotics and expression of microbial virulence factors: implications for host  defense.
AB  - The discovery that antibiotics are capable of modifying both the structural appearance and physiology of pathogenic bacteria when they are incorporated in the culture medium at sub-growth inhibitory concentrations, has led to numerous examples in which the expression of one or more virulence factors (both structural and soluble) is inhibited or potentiated--some of these bacterial products are recognized in their own right as substances which can interfere with one or more stages of the normal process of phagocytosis viz, chemotaxis and Staphylococcus aureus alpha-toxin; opsonization and M protein of Streptococcus pyogenes; phagocytic ingestion and capsule of Bacteroides fragilis; phagocytic killing and streptolysin O of Streptococcus pyogenes. Exposure to these bacteria to low concentrations of various chemotherapeutic drugs can alter the efficacy of the phagocytic process. However, many examples exist in which no specific biochemical lesion induced by exposure to the antibiotic has been recognized. By way of contrast some recent experimental studies using genetically defined variants of S. aureus expressing protein A, alpha-toxin, beta-toxin or coagulase have allowed some discrimination as to the specifity of the drug action and the relative role of each virulence factor in bacterial pathogenicity. In particular it can be recognized that the presence or absence of protein A either through drug treatment (clindamycin or fusidic acid) or through gene delation is critical in determining bacterial susceptibility to opson-ophagocytosis. Extension of these studies to in vivo models will shed light on possible antibiotic-host defence interaction during chemotherapy.
TI  - Effects of beta-lactamase-mediated antimicrobial resistance: the role of beta-lactamase inhibitors.
AB  - Production of beta-lactamase is the most common mechanism of bacterial resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics. Virtually all bacteria have the capability of synthesizing the enzyme. Microorganisms may already possess the native genetic information necessary for beta-lactamase production (i.e., chromosomal), or may acquire the capacity by transfer of DNA from another organism (i.e., plasmid-mediated). The level of beta-lactamase production may be stable and noninducible (constitutive enzyme production), or may be stimulated on exposure to selected beta-lactam antibiotics (inducible enzyme production). Inhibitors such as clavulanic acid and sulbactam prevent antibiotic degradation by the beta-lactamases of many clinically significant pathogens. Therefore, currently available beta-lactam-beta-lactamase-inhibitor combinations exhibit broad spectra of in vitro activity. Ticarcillin-clavulanate possesses clinically significant activity against many bacteria, including streptococci, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacteroides fragilis, and numerous Enterobacteriaceae. Amoxicillin-clavulanate and ampicillin-sulbactam demonstrate clinically significant activity against streptococci (including enterococci), S. aureus, B. fragilis, and some Enterobacteriaceae. Ticarcillin-clavulanate is indicated for treatment of serious infections, including septicemia. Amoxicillin-clavulanate is useful in the treatment of upper respiratory, urinary tract, and skin and soft tissue infections. Ampicillin-sulbactam may be used for treatment of intraabdominal, gynecologic, urinary tract, and skin and soft tissue infections.
TI  - Temafloxacin: in vitro comparison with five other antibacterial agents.
AB  - The in vitro activity of the new fluorinated quinolone temafloxacin was compared  with the activities of ciprofloxacin, fleroxacin, ofloxacin, ceftazidime and tobramycin. A total of 662 recent clinical isolates were included in the study, representing a variety of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. An agar dilution method was employed for the determination of minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs). Ciprofloxacin showed the highest potency against the Enterobacteriaceae, 90% of the isolates being inhibited by 0.06 mg/l or less. The other quinolones were also highly active (MIC90 = 0.25-0.5 mg/l). Ciprofloxacin and tobramycin were the most active agents against the Pseudomonas isolates (MIC90 = 0.25 and 0.5 mg/l, respectively), whereas the activities of temafloxacin, fleroxacin and ofloxacin were more variable. All the quinolones had relatively high and similar activity against Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis, but S. saprophyticus was markedly less susceptible to fleroxacin than to the other quinolones. The activity of temafloxacin against Streptococcus pneumoniae was somewhat higher than those of the other quinolones tested. Temafloxacin showed variable activity against Bacteroides fragilis isolates but was generally more potent against these isolates than were the other quinolones. The MICs of temafloxacin were slightly lower at pH 7.3 compared with those obtained at pHs 5.8 or 8.8.
TI  - The effect of antimicrobial therapy on mixed infections with Bacteroides species. Is eradication of the anaerobes important?
AB  - Antimicrobial agents were used alone or in combinations in order to explore their effect on mixed aerobic-anaerobic infections. Subcutaneous abscesses were induced in mice by single and mixed infections of Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides melaninogenicus, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The infected animals were treated for 5 days with spiramycin, gentamicin or metronidazole alone, or metronidazole combined with spiramycin or gentamicin. Animals were killed 5 days after inoculation and the bacterial contents of the abscesses determined. Infection induced by a single species of bacteria always responded to appropriate antimicrobial therapy. In infections caused by two species of organisms, however, therapy directed at either the Bacteroides sp. (with metronidazole) or the aerobes or facultative anaerobes (with spiramycin or gentamicin) was effective not only in significantly reducing the numbers of the target organism but also, in 13 of 24 instances, in reducing to a small extent the numbers of the other bacteria. Despite this phenomenon, in no instance did therapy with a single agent eliminate the infection and eradicate the untargeted organism. The combination of spiramycin and metronidazole increased the reduction in numbers of B. melaninogenicus in single-organism infections and of Bacteroides sp. in mixed infections with S. aureus and S. pyogenes. These findings support the need to aim treatment at all components of mixed infections.
TI  - The viability of microorganisms in preservation solutions.
AB  - In 1988 the University of Wisconsin solution was introduced into clinical transplantation. This solution is unique in that it contains no glucose but rather raffinose, lactobionate, and hydroxyethyl starch. In addition, it contains two antibiotics, penicillin and bactrim. Prior studies have shown that other preservation solutions allow the transmission of bacterial contamination from organ donor to recipient. However, there are no data on whether UW solution, with its unique composition and extended preservation times, allows bacterial transmission. We undertook the present study to establish if bacteria remain viable in UW solution at extended preservation times. Cultures of both aerobic (Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and anaerobic (Bacteroides fragilis) bacteria were suspended at 10(5), 10(4), 10(2), and 10(1) org./ml (calibrated from a .5 Macfarland turbidity standard) in both Eurocollins and UW preservation solutions. Samples were then stored in an ice bath to stimulate organ preservation. The organisms were removed and plated on blood and chocolate agar at 0, 6, 12, 18, 24, and 36 hr postsuspension. The samples were then incubated at 37 degrees C and read for growth at 24-48 hr after plating. Our results showed growth of all organisms except S epi in both preservation solutions, at all dilutions and preservation times. S epi grew in the Eurocollins solution at all dilutions and preservation times but did not grow in the UW solution. When the experiment was repeated omitting penicillin from the UW solution, S epi grew at all dilutions and preservation times. These results demonstrate that in spite of the inclusion of two different antibiotics, the majority of the common bacterial contaminants of the organ donor remain viable in UW solution with extended preservation times. It may be possible therefore to omit these antibiotics from the UW solution and obtain similar results. It is also important to note that routine culturing remains an expensive but necessary part of organ procurement and preservation.
TI  - Inactivation of metronidazole by Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - The in-vitro inactivation of metronidazole by different clinical isolates of Enterococcus faecalis was investigated by means of association experiments in which Ent. faecalis strains and Bacteroides fragilis group strains were cultured in the same liquid medium. All of the tested Ent. faecalis strains (20 isolates) were able to protect the B. fragilis group strains against the killing effect of metronidazole at a concentration four or eight times higher than the normal MIC. Different strains of Streptococcus (14), Staphylococcus aureus (10), Staph, epidermidis (10) and Escherichia coli (8) failed to exhibit the same effect. When Ent. faecalis strains were cultured anaerobically for 24 h in the presence of 4 mg metronidazole/l, either alone or together with different B. fragilis group strains, no metronidazole could be detected subsequently in the culture supernatants by HPLC. Concomitantly an increase of four or five logs in the viable counts of the co-cultured Bacteroides strains was observed compared with Bacteroides strains cultured alone. Sonicated cell extracts of Ent. faecalis cultured either aerobically or anaerobically were found to inactivate metronidazole to the same extent, whereas the culture supernatants had no such effect.
TI  - The role of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria in obstetrical and gynecological infections.
AB  - Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is a polymicrobial infection that evolves multiple aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Several of the bacterial pathogens that participate in PID can produce the enzyme beta lactamase. These include Bacteroides species (including Bacteroides bivius, Bacteroides disiens, and Bacteroides fragilis group), Neisseria gonorrheae, Enterobacteriaceae and Staphylococcus aureus. A recent increase in numbers of beta-lactamase-producing strains of these organisms in PID has been associated with increased failure rates of penicillins in eradication of this infection. These organisms cannot only survive penicillin therapy but also protect penicillin-susceptible pathogens from the drug. These direct and indirect virulence characteristics of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria require the administration of appropriate antimicrobial therapy directed against all of these pathogens in the therapy of PID.
TI  - Effect of daptomycin, metronidazole and mezlocillin combinations on mixed bacterial cultures involving facultative and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activities of different daptomycin concentrations in combination with metronidazole (4 mg/l) or/and mezlocillin (8 mg/l) were investigated on mixed bacterial cultures involving gram-positive facultative cocci. Bacteroides fragilis group strains and Escherichia coli. When Streptococcus faecalis alone or together with E. coli was cultured with B. thetaiotaomicron the colony counts of the latter were 4 log units higher after incubation in the presence of daptomycin and metronidazole than when it was cultured alone. After the addition of mezlocillin, this effect disappeared and all 3 strains were killed. When the same antibiotic combinations were used in the presence of beta-lactamase producing Staphylococcus aureus, the activity of mezlocillin was decreased significantly. The colony counts of the co-cultured B. thetaiotaomicron and E. coli proved to be 2 log and 6 log higher, respectively, than those observed after they were cultured alone. The antimicrobial susceptibilities of the clinical isolates tested here in mixed cultures of up to 3 strains were modified significantly by interactions between the strains and the antibiotics used.
TI  - Combination of ofloxacin and other antimicrobial agents.
AB  - We evaluated the combination of ofloxacin with piperacillin, gentamicin, vancomycin, rifampin, clindamycin, and metronidazole by the checkerboard agar dilution method against 165 isolates which included Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Providencia stuartii, Acinetobacter, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacteroides fragilis, and Citrobacter perfringens. Synergy of piperacillin-ofloxacin was demonstrated for 50% and 40% respectively of E. cloacae and P. aeruginosa. Some ofloxacin and piperacillin-resistant isolates were susceptible with the combination. Ofloxacin-gentamicin was indifferent for aerobic gram-negative species. Ofloxacin and vancomycin or gentamicin was indifferent for S. aureus and E. faecalis, but rifampin-ofloxacin showed addition. Combination of ofloxacin and metronidazole or clindamycin or erythromycin was indifferent for aerobic and anaerobic species. Ofloxacin could be combined with piperacillin with benefit against P. aeruginosa, but combination with aminoglycosides is not of benefit.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents. A study mainly focused on imipenem. Reported by the Research Group for Testing Imipenem Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (IPM) and other antibacterial agents at 64 hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1988. In this study, identification and susceptibility testing were carried out at each laboratory and the tests were performed according to the disk dilution method recommended by NCCLS in which susceptibilities are classified into "S", "MS", "I" and "R". IPM showed markedly high in vitro activities against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Salmonella spp., Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia rettgeri, Providencia stuartii, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, Alcaligenes spp., Peptococcus spp./Peptostreptococcus spp., Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides spp. IPM also had strong activities against Achromobacter xylosoxidans and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but less active against Flavobacterium spp., E. faecium, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas cepacia. In a study in which activities of IPM against bacteria isolated from different clinical sources were compared, differences in susceptibilities were observed among S. aureus, CNS, A. calcoaceticus and P. aeruginosa, but such differences were not apparent among S. pneumoniae, E. faecalis, H. influenzae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, C. freundii, S. marcescens or P. mirabilis.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents. A study mainly focused on imipenem. Research Group for Testing Imipenem Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - We investigated susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (IPM) and other antimicrobial agents at 459 hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1988. In this study, identification and susceptibility testing were performed at each hospital laboratory and the tests were carried out according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc technique in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, + and -. IPM had significantly high activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Salmonella spp., Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia rettgeri, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Moraxella catarrhalis, Alcaligenes spp., Peptococcus spp./Peptostreptococcus spp., Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides spp. and should slightly lower activities on coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), Enterococcus faecalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus vulgaris, Providencia stuartii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa than on the above mentioned bacteria. In a comparative study on activities of IPM against bacteria from different clinical sources, no remarkable differences were found due to different sources among S. pneumoniae, E. faecalis, H. influenzae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, C. freundii, P. mirabilis or A. calcoaceticus, whereas slight differences were found among Staphylococcus aureus, CNS, S. marcescens and P. aeruginosa.
TI  - [A case of Fournier's gangrene: was it triggered by prostatic massage?].
AB  - We have experienced a case of Fournier's gangrene which progressed rapidly after  prostatic massage. The patient was a 70-year-old man who had poorly controlled diabetes mellitus, hemorrhoid, urethral stricture and benign prostatic hyperplasia. He visited an urologist complaining of pollakisuria and miction pain. Under the diagnosis of prostatitis, prostatic massage was performed. From that night, he developed a high grade fever. Simultaneously, redness, swelling and pain of the scrotum progressed rapidly, and 11 days later, he was admitted to our hospital. An X-ray examination revealed subcutaneous gas formation in the scrotum. Immediately, incision and drainage with extensive debridement of necrotic tissue were performed combined with chemotherapy using broad spectrum antibiotics and insulin therapy. About 3 months later, the gangrene and the wound were healed with granulation and scarring. Cultures of the pus and the necrotic tissue from the scrotum were positive for Bacteroides fragilis and several aerobes including Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. The case proved to be non-clostridial gas gangrene.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of cefpirome and cefepime, two new cephalosporins.
AB  - In in vitro tests the broad-spectrum cephalosporins cefpirome and cefepime were highly active against Enterobacteriaceae, although often less so against strains resistant to amoxicillin-clavulanate and ticarcillin-clavulanate, and against most strains of Acinetobacter spp. and Aeromonas hydrophila. They were also active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, although strains with non-plasmid mediated beta-lactam resistance were sometimes less sensitive. Other Pseudomonas spp. varied in their sensitivity. Both agents were highly active against Haemophilus influenzae, but beta-lactamase-producing Branhamella catarrhalis were somewhat less sensitive. Neisseria gonorrhoeae were susceptible, although non-beta-lactamase producing penicillin-resistant strains had higher MICs. Gardnerella vaginalis was also susceptible and Campylobacter coli/jejuni usually susceptible. Both antibiotics had good activity against Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci except for methicillin-resistant strains and Staphylococcus haemolyticus which were of borderline sensitivity. All streptococci were sensitive, with the exception of highly penicillin-resistant pneumococci and enterococci against which cefpirome had greater activity than cefepime. Both antibiotics had little useful activity against the Bacteroides fragilis group or Bacteroides oralis group but were active against most other anaerobes. Clostridium difficile and some other Clostridium species were resistant.
TI  - In vitro activity of dirithromycin (LY 237216) compared with activities of other  macrolide antibiotics.
AB  - Dirithromycin inhibited Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and other hemolytic streptococci at concentrations of less than or equal to 0.03 to 0.12 micrograms/ml, with 90% inhibition at 0.12 micrograms/ml, which is comparable to results using erythromycin. Group A streptococci, listeriae, and enterococci resistant to erythromycin were resistant to dirithromycin. Erythromycin-susceptible staphylococci were inhibited by 0.5 micrograms/ml, but for erythromycin-resistant isolates MICs were greater than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml. For Haemophilus influenzae, MICs were greater than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml, two- to fourfold greater than for erythromycin. The activity of dirithromycin against staphylococci and streptococci was not decreased by the addition of human serum.
TI  - Occlusive dressings. Does dressing type influence the growth of common bacterial  pathogens?
AB  - We studied the effect of different occlusive dressings and of air exposure on the growth of four pathogenic bacteria in wounds. Partial-thickness wounds on domestic pigs were inoculated with Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium perfringens, Bacteroides fragilis, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Each wound was covered with three dressings (DuoDERM, Opsite, or Vigilon), or left exposed to air. Groups of wounds were sampled at 24, 48, and 72 hours. Staphylococcus aureus reached high levels beneath all of the dressings and in the air-exposed wounds. The numbers of C perfringens and B fragilis were greatly reduced in the air-exposed wounds and slightly reduced in the Opsite-covered wounds. The numbers of P aeruginosa were greatest in the Opsite- and Vigilon-covered wounds. The results indicate that occlusive dressings are not indicated in wounds that clinically appear to be grossly contaminated or that may contain anaerobic organisms.
TI  - Cardiac dysfunction in a rat model of chronic bacteremia.
AB  - Cardiac function was examined in vivo and in vitro in rats to determine if cardiac dysfunction could be demonstrated in a nonlethal model of infection. Bacteremic rats (n = 6) had a subcutaneous polymicrobial abscess produced via repeated inoculations of an encapsulated foreign body with Escherichia coli, Bacteroides fragilis, and Staphylococcus aureus while control rats (n = 6) had the same subcutaneous, encapsulated foreign body (an inflammatory focus) but were not inoculated with bacteria. Cardiovascular function was assessed indirectly in vivo by measuring the maximal O2 uptake during a progressive exercise test in both groups before and 14 days after the initiation of inoculations. Cardiac function was also assessed in vitro in the same rats by measuring stroke volumes generated at six different preloads with constant heart rate and afterload. Bacteremic rats had a significantly different fever curve and leukocytotic response than control rats over the 14 day period. The majority of rats that received inoculations demonstrated bacteremias, while none of the control animals had positive cultures for the inoculated organisms. Although in vivo assessment of cardiovascular function showed no evidence of dysfunction, in vitro assessment demonstrated a significant rightward shift of the Starling curve in bacteremic rats. These data suggest that LV dysfunction occurs even during nonlethal infections but may be masked in vivo by compensatory mechanisms.
TI  - In vitro activity of LJC10,627, a new carbapenem antibiotic with high stability to dehydropeptidase I.
AB  - The in vitro activity of LJC10,627, a new carbapenem, was compared with those of  imipenem and ceftazidime. LJC10,627 had broad-spectrum activity against gram-positive and gram-negative clinical isolates. The MICs of this compound for 90% of members of the family Enterobacteriaceae tested (MIC90s), including strains resistant to ceftazidime, ranged from 0.1 to 25 micrograms/ml. LJC10,627 inhibited Pseudomonas aeruginosa at an MIC90 of 3.13 micrograms/ml; it thus was twofold more active than imipenem. This compound inhibited Haemophilus, Neisseria, and Branhamella species at MIC90s of 3.13, 0.1, and 0.1 micrograms/ml, respectively. LJC10,627 was two- to fourfold less active than imipenem against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis at MIC90s of 0.1 and 0.39 microgram/ml. However, the compound was found to be twofold more active than imipenem against Bacteroides fragilis at an MIC90 of 1.56 microgram/ml. LJC10,627 was very stable to various beta-lactamases except for Xanthomonas maltophilia oxyiminocephalosporinase type II. LJC10,627 was minimally hydrolyzed by swine renal dehydropeptidase I; its residual activity was 93.0% after 2 h. Killing kinetics of this compound for Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa showed that bactericidal action occurred at concentrations above the MIC (0.05 and 0.39 microgram/ml, respectively). LJC10,627 had a high affinity for penicillin-binding proteins 2, 4, and 1B(s) of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and penicillin-binding proteins 1 and 4 of Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Disparate mechanisms of induction of procoagulant activity by live and inactivated bacteria and viruses.
AB  - This study describes the dose response, time course, and lymphocyte requirements  of procoagulant activity (PCA) induction following stimulation of thioglycolate-elicited BALB/c peritoneal macrophages with live and inactivated bacteria (Bacteroides fragilis, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus) and murine hepatitis virus type 3 (MHV-3). Induction of PCA by MHV-3 was significantly more rapid and the maximal PCA achieved was significantly greater than by the three bacterial species studied. In relation to induction of PCA by bacteria, the PCA response was more rapid and of greater magnitude with S. aureus and E. coli than with B. fragilis. MHV-3 induced an augmented PCA response at all concentrations of virus studied in a dose-dependent fashion, whereas higher titers of live bacteria (greater than 10(7) CFU/ml) inhibited PCA, suggesting the production of an inhibitory factor. Significant PCA induction was observed when macrophages were incubated with bacteria or virus in the absence of lymphocytes. At low titers of B. fragilis (10(3) CFU/ml), addition of lymphocytes greatly augmented PCA production, whereas at higher titers (10(7) CFU/ml), the addition of lymphocytes only slightly augmented the PCA response. In contrast, MHV-3 induction of PCA was enhanced by the addition of lymphocytes at all concentrations of virus studied, suggesting a lymphocyte-dependent process. Heat-inactivated bacteria were as effective as live bacteria in inducing PCA, suggesting that induction of PCA by bacteria requires only a bacterial surface component. In contrast, UV-inactivated MHV-3 did not induce PCA, suggesting that viral replication is a necessary step in PCA induction. These results suggest that the cellular and metabolic requirements for induction of PCA differ among viral and bacterial pathogens and may partly explain their differences in pathogenicity.
TI  - Microbiology of empyema in children and adolescents.
AB  - The microbiology of empyema was studied in 72 children and adolescents whose specimens yielded bacterial growth after inoculation for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. A total of 93 organisms, 60 aerobic or facultative and 33 anaerobic, were isolated. Aerobic bacteria was isolated in 48 (67%) patients, anaerobic bacteria in 17 (24%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in 7 (10%). The predominant aerobic or facultative bacteria were Haemophilus influenzae (15 isolates), Streptococcus pneumoniae (13), and Staphylococcus aureus (10). The predominant anaerobes were Bacteroides sp (15 isolates, including 7 Bacteroides fragilis group and 5 Bacteroides melaninogenicus group), anaerobic cocci (9), and Fusobacterium sp (6). beta-lactamase activity was detected in at least one isolate in 20 (37%) of the 54 tested patients. These included all 8 tested S aureus and 7 B fragilis group, 3 of 10 H influenzae, 2 of 4 B melaninogenicus group, and 1 of 2 Klebsiella pneumoniae. Most cases of S pneumoniae and H influenzae were associated with pneumonia. The recovery of anaerobic bacteria was mostly associated with the concomitant diagnosis of aspiration pneumonia, lung abscess, subdiaphragmatic abscess, and abscesses of dental or oropharyngeal origin. The data highlight the importance of anaerobic bacteria in selected cases of empyema in children and adolescents.
TI  - [In vitro antibacterial activity of clarithromycin, a new macrolide antibiotic, and regression curve].
AB  - This study was set up to establish the regression curve for clarithromycin inhibition zone diameters (disks 15 micrograms) and MIC to create a strain distribution plot, in order to allow accurate interpretation of the disk diffusion method for testing susceptibility to clarithromycin. 430 bacterial strains were studied in three university hospital. Clarithromycin was active against erythromycin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase negative Staphylococci at concentrations of 0.12 to 0.25 microgram/ml (mode 0.25). Erythromycin resistant strains were also resistant to clarithromycin. Enterococci could be divided into two populations, one resistant (MIC greater than 128 micrograms/ml) and the other with MIC of 0.06 to 2 (mode 0.25). This was also the case for Streptococci and Pneumococci with MIC lower for susceptible strains (mode 0.03 to 0.06). Clarithromycin was active on Haemophilus at concentrations of 4 to 64 micrograms/ml (mode 16); MICs for beta-lactamase producing strains were comparable to those of strains not producing. MICs for Neisseria were 0.12 to 16 and for B. catarrhalis 0.016 to 0.5. MIC were 0.5 and 1 (mode 1) for Clostridium perfringens; Bacteroides fragilis strains were inhibited by 0.12 to 8 micrograms/ml (mode 0.5-1). So, antibacterial activity of C was similar to that of E; it was sometimes slightly superior, particularly on Gram positive cocci. For MIC breakpoints of 1 and 4 micrograms/ml, zone size breakpoints should be 23 and 17 mm and for 2 and 8 micrograms/ml, 20 and 15 mm.
TI  - Biological characterization of a new radioactive labeling reagent for bacterial penicillin-binding proteins.
AB  - Radiolabeled penicillin G is widely used as the imaging agent in penicillin-binding protein (PBP) assays. The disadvantages of most forms of labeled penicillin G are instability on storage and the long exposure times usually required for autoradiography or fluorography of electrophoretic gels. We investigated the utility of radioiodinated penicillin V as an alternative reagent. Radioiodination of p-(trimethylstannyl)penicillin V with [125I]Na, using a modification of the chloramine-T method, is simple, high yielding, and site specific. We demonstrated the general equivalence of commercially obtained [3H]penicillin G and locally synthesized [125I]penicillin V (IPV) in their recognition of bacterial PBPs. Profiles of PBPs in membranes from Bacteroides fragilis, Escherichia coli, Providencia rettgeri, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, and Enterococcus faecium labeled with IPV or [3H]penicillin G were virtually identical. Use of IPV as the imaging agent in competition experiments for determination of the affinities of various beta-lactam antibiotics for the PBPs of E. coli yielded results similar to those obtained in experiments with [3H]penicillin G. Dried electrophoretic gels from typical PBP experiments, using IPV at 37.3 Ci/mmol and 30 micrograms/ml, exposed X-ray film in 8 to 24 h. The stability of IPV on storage at 4 degrees C was inversely proportional to specific activity. At 37.3 Ci/mmol and 60 micrograms/ml, IPV retained useful activity for at least 60 days at 4 degrees C. IPV represents a practical and stable reagent for rapid PBP assays.
TI  - In vitro activity of daptomycin-metronidazole combinations against mixed bacterial cultures: reduced activity of metronidazole against Bacteroides species in the presence of Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - The in vitro activity of daptomycin-metronidazole combinations against mixed cultures of gram-positive facultative cocci and strains of the Bacteroides fragilis group was investigated. Metronidazole did not influence the high activity of daptomycin against strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis in the absence or presence of the co-cultured Bacteroides strains. In contrast, the Enterococcus faecalis isolates protected the co-cultured Bacteroides strains against the killing effect of metronidazole, even at a concentration four- or eightfold the MIC of metronidazole. Killing curve experiments confirmed this protective effect of different isolates of Enterococcus faecalis.
TI  - Implications of beta-lactamase-inhibitor combinations.
AB  - Resistance of many species of bacteria to beta-lactam antibiotics is mediated via inactivation by beta-lactamase. Beta-lactamase inhibitors irreversibly bind to beta-lactamases and thus can prevent the destruction of active beta-lactam antibiotics. In the United States three beta-lactam-antibiotic/beta-lactam-inhibitor combinations are commercially available--the orally absorbed amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (A/C), the parenteral formulations of ampicillin/sulbactam (A/S) and ticarcillin/clavulanate (T/C). In a multicenter study that focused on T/C, the in vitro activity of amoxicillin (AMOX), ampicillin (AMP) and ticarcillin (TIC) against Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Haemophilus influenzae was obliterated when beta-lactamase-positive strains were tested, but all tested strains were susceptible to the antibiotics in combination with their respective beta-lactamase inhibitors. Clavulanic acid improved the activity of TIC against most species of Enterobacteriaceae but not against those Enterobacteriaceae that elaborate type I beta-lactamase or against non-Enterobacteriaceae gram-negative bacilli (except for Pseudomonas maltophilia). Staphylococci are generally beta-lactamase positive and considered resistant to AMP and TIC, but greater than 99% of 1,137 Staphylococcus aureus isolates and 92% of coagulase-negative staphylococcal isolates were susceptible to T/C, with comparable figures obtained for A/C and A/S. The activity of TIC against Bacteroides fragilis was improved up to 64-fold by clavulanic acid, with a definite but less pronounced effect on the non-fragilis Bacteroides species. Ninety-seven percent of strains of other anaerobic genera were susceptible to both TIC and T/C.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - In vitro activity of Ro 23-9424, a dual-action cephalosporin, compared with activities of other antibiotics.
AB  - The in vitro activity of Ro 23-9424, which is desacetyl-cefotaxime linked to fleroxacin, was compared with the activities of cefotaxime, desacetyl-cefotaxime, fleroxacin, ofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin. It inhibited the majority of members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, except for some Serratia marcescens, Citrobacter freundii, and Enterobacter cloacae strains, at less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml and had an MIC for 90% of strains tested (MIC90) of 8 micrograms/ml against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Most group A, B, C, and G streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited at less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml. Ninety percent of the staphylococci were inhibited at less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml, except for some methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolates. The MIC90S of Ro 23-9424 for Enterococcus faecalis and Listeria monocytogenes were greater than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml. Ninety percent of Clostridium perfringens isolates were inhibited by less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, whereas Bacteroides fragilis had an MIC90 of 32 micrograms/ml. There was a minimal inoculum size effect. The MICs and MBCs were either identical or within a twofold dilution. The MICs of Ro 23-9424 for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus increased 16- to 128-fold after 2 weeks of transfer in the presence of Ro 23-9424, showing that the presence of two agents does not prevent resistance.
TI  - Correlation of the extravascular pharmacokinetics of azithromycin with in-vivo efficacy in models of localized infection.
AB  - Infection models were used to clarify the roles of serum and extravascular concentrations in the in-vivo efficacy observed with azithromycin. In-vivo experiments were designed to give serum concentrations well below the MIC and tissue levels generally above the MIC at time of challenge and during the course of infection. The efficacy of azithromycin against a Salmonella enteritidis oral challenge (a tissue-associated infection model) in mice correlated directly with azithromycin liver levels, but not serum concentrations. The significance of extravascular pharmacokinetics was observed in a comparative study of azithromycin and ciprofloxacin against the salmonella challenge. Ciprofloxacin has a greater than 100-fold in-vitro potency advantage over azithromycin against this organism, but azithromycin (5 mg/kg) produced a greater reduction in cfu than ciprofloxacin (100 mg/kg) at the primary site of infection (liver). In another model, extravascular fluid levels, measured by bioassay of implanted paper discs, were compared with plasma levels in relation to control of a localized Staphylococcus aureus infection in rats. Extravascular fluid levels of azithromycin were greater than the MIC of the strain used for five days after a 100 mg/kg dose, while erythromycin levels were less than 20% of the MIC at 30 h after a 200 mg/kg dose. Serum concentrations of both compounds were less than 20% of the MIC at the time of challenge. The antibiotic levels at the site of infection correlated with the reduction of Staph. aureus cfu (99% with azithromycin compared with controls, P less than 0.01; 0% with erythromycin) recovered from inoculated discs. The significance of extravascular concentrations of azithromycin was further supported in other models of localized infections induced with Escherichia coli or a mixture of Staph. aureus and Bacteroides fragilis.
TI  - Comparative in-vitro activity of azithromycin and erythromycin against Gram-positive cocci, Haemophilus influenzae and anaerobes.
AB  - The in-vitro activities of azithromycin and erythromycin were compared against 689 clinical isolates, including Gram-positive cocci, Haemophilus influenzae, and anaerobes. Of the 100 methicillin-susceptible isolates of Staphylococcus aureus tested, 77% were susceptible to 1 mg/l azithromycin and 0.5 mg/l erythromycin, whereas 22% were resistant to 32 mg/l of both compounds. All methicillin-resistant S. aureus isolates were highly resistant to both macrolides (MIC greater than 64 mg/l). Coagulase-negative staphylococci showed a wide range of susceptibilities to both compounds; MIC50 values for azithromycin and erythromycin for all isolates were 0.5 and 0.25 mg/l, respectively. With the exception of enterococci, both macrolides showed similar activity against streptococci; MIC90 values for both group A and group B streptococci were 0.03 and 0.06 mg/l for erythromycin and azithromycin, respectively. Azithromycin was less active than erythromycin against enterococci, with mode MICs of 4.0 and 1.0 mg/l, respectively; about 20% of isolates were highly resistant to both compounds. Azithromycin was substantially more active than erythromycin against H. influenzae; 41% of isolates were inhibited by 0.5 mg/l azithromycin and all isolates were inhibited by 2 mg/l. The MIC90 for erythromycin was 8 mg/l; 36% of isolates required concentrations of greater than or equal to 4 mg/l for inhibition. The anaerobic bacteria tested showed similar susceptibility to both azithromycin and erythromycin.
TI  - [Community- and hospital-acquired bacteremia: a retrospective study in a regional hospital. III. Microbiological aspects].
AB  - A retrospective study was made of all blood cultures performed over a 40-month period at the Ivrea-Castellamonte Hospital (Turin, Italy). A total of 4386 vials from 619 patients were examined. There were 619 positive vials (14.1%) from 131 patients (21.2%) corresponding to 145 bacteremia episodes, including 129 monomicrobial (89%) and 16 polymicrobial (11%). Ten patients (1.6%) had more than one episode. There were 73 polluted vials (1.7%). A total of 165 microorganism were isolated: Gram-positive (52.7%) and Gram-negative (46%) bacteria, and mycetes (1.2%), anaerobic flora (9.7%). The predominant families were: Enterobacteriaceae (29.5%), Micrococcaceae (27.3%), Pseudomonadaceae (4.8%), Bacteroidaceae (4.8%) and Streptococcus "Genus" (18.8%). The species frequencies were: Escherichia coli (20%), Staphylococcus aureus (15.8%), Enterococcus (8.5%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (7.3%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4.8%), Proteus mirabilis (4.2%), Brucella spp. (2.4%), Bacteroides fragilis, Streptococcus bovis e Propionibacterium acnes (1.8%). These findings are compared with those published in the Italian and international literature. Stress is laid on periodical review of the isolations from samples of this kind as a useful aid towards the diagnosis and treatment of hospital infections, and in their monitoring and epidemiological evaluation.
TI  - Clinical evaluation of the imipenem/cilastatin combination in the therapy of severe infections in patients with malignant diseases.
AB  - Thirty hospitalized patients (23 men and 7 women), aged 42 to 78 years, with impaired host defences for malignant underlying diseases and affected by life-threatening infections, were treated with the imipenem/cilastatin combination at a dosage ranging between 2 and 4 g daily i.v. at 8 or 12 h intervals. The average length of therapy was 9.6 +/- 2.09 days. The isolated organisms were as follows: Pseudomonas aeruginosa [12], Escherichia coli [10], Klebsiella pneumoniae [5], Proteus mirabilis [3], P. vulgaris [2], Serratia marcescens [1], Staphylococcus aureus [3], Streptococcus faecalis [3], Bacteroides fragilis [5]. In fourteen patients a mixed infection was observed. Twenty-three patients (76.66%) were completely cured of infection and 35 out of 44 isolated organisms (79.54%) were eradicated. No important side-effects were observed.
TI  - New diterpenoid antibiotics, spirocardins A and B.
AB  - New antibiotics spirocardins A and B were isolated from the culture broth of an actinomycete isolated from a soil sample collected near Lake Hibara, Fukushima Prefecture, Japan. The producing strain was classified as Nocardia sp. SANK 64282. The antibiotics were isolated from the culture filtrate by solvent extraction and purified further by silica gel and preparative reverse phase column chromatography. They were primarily active against Gram-positive bacteria including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and limited species of Gram-negative bacteria such as Bacteroides fragilis and Klebsiella pneumoniae. They were also moderately active against several species of Mycoplasma. The molecular formulae of spirocardins A and B were C20H30O6 and C20H32O6, respectively. From their physico-chemical characteristics they were revealed to be diterpenoid antibiotics with closely related structures and the former was easily converted to the latter by the reduction with NaBH4.
TI  - Microbiology of infected epidermal cysts.
AB  - Specimens from 231 epidermal cyst abscesses were inoculated on media supportive for growth of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Of these, 192 yielded bacterial growth. Aerobic or facultative bacteria only were recovered in 84 specimens (44%), anaerobic bacteria only in 57 specimens (30%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in 51 specimens (26%). A total of 315 isolates (162 anaerobes and 153 aerobes) were recovered. An average of 0.8 aerobic or facultative isolates per infected cyst were recovered, and this number was unrelated to the cysts' anatomic sites. However, the number of anaerobic bacteria varied; they were isolated more frequently in perirectal (1.5 isolates per specimen), vulvovaginal (1.4), and head (1.1) infections, and less frequently in trunk (0.7) and extremities (0.4) infections. The predominant aerobic or facultative bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus (81 isolates), group A streptococcus (9 isolates), and Escherichia coli (7 isolates). The predominant anaerobic organisms were Peptostreptococcus species (85 isolates) and Bacteroides species (55 isolates, including 12 Bacteroides melaninogenicus and 9 Bacteroides fragilis groups). The study highlights the polymicrobial nature and predominance of anaerobes in cyst abscesses in the perirectal, vulvovaginal, and head areas.
TI  - Splenic abscess: presentation, treatment options, and results.
AB  - Pyogenic splenic abscess is a rare condition that tends to occur in patients with predisposing factors. The use of splenectomy or computed tomography-guided percutaneous drainage in 10 patients with splenic abscess is presented. In 8 of 10 cases, the diagnosis was based on abdominal computed tomography scan. Seven of 10 patients were treated with splenectomy, and 3 were managed with computed tomography-guided drainage. Abscess cultures included Escherichia coli, Enterobacter, Streptococcus viridans, Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacteroides fragilis. There were two morbidities and one death in the splenectomy group and no complications in those treated with percutaneous drainage. This review suggests a flexible approach in the management of splenic abscess. Although splenectomy remains the traditional treatment for bacterial splenic abscess, CT-guided drainage may be appropriate in carefully selected patients.
TI  - Effect of the abscess environment on the antimicrobial activity of ciprofloxacin.
AB  - The present studies were conducted to identify factors in human purulent material that might limit or enhance the activity of ciprofloxacin against bacteria causing suppurative infection. Ciprofloxacin, imipenem, and ampicillin were tested with regard to binding or inactivation by pus. The bactericidal activity of ciprofloxacin and imipenem were tested against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, or Staphylococcus aureus in human pus with a pH of 6.0 incubated at 37 degrees C under aerobic or anaerobic conditions. The effect of single or combination drug therapy with 20 mg/kg of ciprofloxacin, imipenem, or rifampin given every 12 hours was tested against E. coli or P. aeruginosa in polymicrobic murine abscesses that had been produced by subcutaneous injection of either of those organisms mixed with Bacteroides fragilis and autoclaved human stool. Antibiotic levels and the number of bacteria surviving in pus were quantitated. Therapy of subcutaneous abscesses was delayed 72 hours to test drug efficacy against organisms in well-established infections. Levels of ampicillin, imipenem, or ciprofloxacin were reduced from 10 micrograms/ml to 3.1 +/- 4.0, 2.7 +/- 3, or 5.8 +/- 2 micrograms/ml, respectively, after incubation in eight pus specimens for 24 hours at 37 degrees C. Ampicillin levels were reduced to less than 1 microgram/ml in four pus specimens containing beta-lactamase. Imipenem levels were undetectable in two specimens and were 0.2 micrograms/ml in one specimen. Ciprofloxacin binding to pus supernate or sediment appeared to be explained by its binding to the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) present in pus. Activity of 5 micrograms/ml of ciprofloxacin against four E. coli or K. pneumoniae strains in pus in vitro was greater than that of twofold higher concentrations of imipenem. The bactericidal activity of ciprofloxacin and imipenem were comparable but substantially reduced against S. aureus and P. aeruginosa in pus. Ciprofloxacin alone or regimens combining ciprofloxacin with rifampin or rifampin plus imipenem reduced the number of E. coli in polymicrobic subcutaneous abscesses but had little effect on P. aeruginosa in polymicrobic abscesses. The anaerobic abscess milieu appeared to inhibit the growth of P. aeruginosa. Ciprofloxacin activity in abscess fluid did not appear to be adversely affected by acid pH, aerobic or anaerobic conditions of incubation, the abscess constituents, or the binding of ciprofloxacin to the DNA in pus. Ciprofloxacin was bound to DNA of bacterial or human origin. Binding by pus was reversible, and binding to DNA extracts of pus was blocked by pretreatment of extracts with deoxyribonuclease but not by pretreatment with ribonuclease.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [Bacteremia secondary to decubitus ulcer].
AB  - We have prospectively evaluated 16 episodes of bacteremia induced by decubitus ulcers. The most commonly isolated microorganisms were Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bacteroides fragilis. Bacteremia was polymicrobial in 5 cases (31%). Most ulcers were already present at the time of admission, but bacteremia developed within the hospital in 13 patients. In 3 patients, ulcers did not show local features of infection. The initial antibiotic therapy was satisfactory in 13 cases. Mortality rate directly associated with bacteremia was 18%, but the overall mortality rate was 62%. We did not identify data permitting a reliable prediction of the findings of blood culture; therefore, the initial empirical therapy should be active against Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas, enteric Gram-negative bacilli and anaerobes including Bacteroides fragilis.
TI  - Standardisation of quantitative direct gas liquid chromatography for early detection of bacteria in blood cultures.
AB  - Blood cultures with strains of aerobic, facultative and obligate anaerobic bacteria were studied by quantitative direct gas liquid chromatography for early diagnosis of bacteraemias. Small amounts of volatile and nonvolatile fatty acids were detected in uninoculated blood cultures. Bacteroides fragilis produced acetic (27.6 mumol/ml), propionic (1.0 mumol/ml), isovaleric, (0.6 mumol/ml), lactic (4.5 mumol/ml) and succinic (2.7 mumol/ml) acids after 48 h. Blood cultures inoculated with Clostridium perfringens and Fusobacterium nucleatum produced large amount of butyric acid (2.5 and 18.8 mumol/ml respectively) along with acetic, propionic, lactic and succinic acids on day 2 of incubation. Blood cultures with Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi, Staphylococcus aureus, beta-haemolytic streptococci (group A) produced only acetic, lactic and succinic acids. Pseudomonas aeruginosa produced only small amounts of succinic (0.6 mumol/ml) and acetic acids (2.4 mumol/ml) on day 5 of incubation. Blood cultures inoculated with anaerobic bacteria produced multiple volatile fatty acids within 24 to 48 h of incubation. Since these acids could be detected earlier than the organism in cultures, they may be useful in the early diagnosis of anaerobic bacteraemias/septicaemias.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of piperacillin combined with the beta-lactamase inhibitor tazobactam (YTR 830).
AB  - Combination with tazobactam substantially enhanced the activity of piperacillin against routine isolates of staphylococci, various Enterobacteriaceae, Acinetobacter anitratus, and Bacteroides fragilis. Tazobactam enhanced the activity of piperacillin more than fourfold against Pseudomonas aeruginosa spp. harboring eight of 12 plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases.
TI  - Tazobactam prevention of emergence of resistance.
AB  
TI  - In vitro activity of AT-4140 against clinical bacterial isolates.
AB  - The activity of AT-4140, a new fluoroquinolone, was evaluated against a wide range of clinical bacterial isolates and compared with those of existing analogs. AT-4140 had a broad spectrum and a potent activity against gram-positive and -negative bacteria, including Legionella spp. and Bacteroides fragilis. The activity of AT-4140 against gram-positive and -negative cocci, including Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, was higher than those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and norfloxacin. Its activity against gram-negative rods was generally comparable to that of ciprofloxacin. Some isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MIC of methicillin, greater than or equal to 12.5 micrograms/ml) were resistant to existing quinolones, but many of them were still susceptible to AT-4140 at concentrations below 0.39 micrograms/ml. The MICs of AT-4140, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and norfloxacin for 90% of clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant S. aureus were 0.2, 12.5, 6.25, and 100 micrograms/ml, respectively. AT-4140 was bactericidal for each of 20 clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa at concentrations near the MICs. AT-4140 inhibited the supercoiling activity of DNA gyrase from E. coli.
TI  - Comparative in vitro and in vivo activities of piperacillin combined with the beta-lactamase inhibitors tazobactam, clavulanic acid, and sulbactam.
AB  - Tazobactam (YTR-830H), a novel beta-lactamase inhibitor, was compared with clavulanic acid and sulbactam for enhancement of the activity of piperacillin against beta-lactamase-producing, piperacillin-resistant clinical isolates. Piperacillin MICs were determined in media containing a fixed concentration of 2 or 4 micrograms of the inhibitors per ml. The higher concentration was generally more effective. Tazobactam was superior to sulbactam in enhancing the spectrum and potency of piperacillin. Although the calvulanic acid combination was more potent, tazobactam was effective for a similar spectrum of resistant gram-negative clinical isolates containing beta-lactamase. MICs were reduced to the susceptible range for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus spp., Salmonella spp., and Shigella spp. Combinations with tazobactam and sulbactam, but not clavulanic acid, were effective against Morganella spp. Some antagonism of the activity of piperacillin was observed with clavulanic acid but not with tazobactam or sulbactam. The inhibitors were similarly effective with piperacillin against beta-lactamase-positive Staphylococcus spp. and the Bacteroides fragilis group. Piperacillin-tazobactam was more effective against a broader spectrum of gram-negative enteric bacteria than ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid was. Combinations with tazobactam or clavulanic acid had a broader spectrum of activity than combinations with sulbactam against bacteria that produce characterized plasmid-mediated enzymes of clinical significance. In particular, piperacillin with tazobactam or clavulanic acid, but not with sulbactam, inhibited TEM-1, TEM-2, and SHV-1 enzymes. In vitro activity was reflected in vivo. Tazobactam and clavulanic acid were superior to sulbactam in enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of piperacillin in mice infected with beta-lactamase-positive E. coli, K. pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Staphylococcus aureus. Only combinations with tazobactam and sulbactam were effective against the Morganella infection. Tazobactam has a good potential for enhancing the clinical efficacy of piperacillin.
TI  - Topical and systemic antibiotics in the prevention of wound infection.
AB  - We evaluated under controlled conditions the efficacy of topical and systemic antibiotics, alone and in combination, in the prevention of wound infection and measured serum and tissue antibiotic levels in the wound and distant tissue after administration of antibiotics topically, systemically, and in combination. Adult Sprague-Dawley rats were contaminated on the dorsal paravertebral muscles with a preset standardized inoculum of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Bacteroides fragilis. A second-generation cephalosporin was used; systemic administration was given intramuscularly and topically in powder form. Wound infection was confirmed by the recovery of the organism by culture. Prophylactic antibiotics were effective in preventing wound infection in all groups. Topical antibiotic and a combination (topical/systemic) antibiotic were significantly more effective than was systemic antibiotic alone in preventing wound infection. Adequate levels of antibiotic were achieved in serum and tissue with both topical and systemic antibiotics. Wound tissue concentration of antibiotic was significantly higher when topical antibiotic was used.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of the new oral penem ALP-201 against aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activity of the new penem derivative ALP-201 against 226 aerobic and 350 anaerobic clinical bacterial isolates was determined using agar dilution techniques. For comparison amoxicillin, cefaclor, ceftazidime, doxycycline, erythromycin, imipenem and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole were also tested with aerobic bacteria, and cefoxitin, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, imipenem, metronidazole and piperacillin with anaerobic bacteria. ALP-201 was found to be highly active against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter spp., Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, anaerobic cocci, Propioni-bacterium acnes, Clostridium perfringens, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides spp. and fusobacteria. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Clostridium difficile were resistant to ALP-201. When tested against aerobic bacteria using a high inoculum or using the broth dilution technique, the activity of ALP-201 showed little dependence on inoculum size and the bactericidal activity was similar to the inhibitory activity. Further investigations are warranted with ALP-201, which is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration.
TI  - The in-vitro activity, pharmacokinetics and tissue penetration of temafloxacin.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of temafloxacin compared with other quinolone antibiotics was evaluated using 579 bacterial strains and three isolates of Chlamydia trachomatis. The MICs of temafloxacin for 90% of Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria spp., Enterobacteriaceae, Bacteroides fragilis and Ch. trachomatis were all less than or equal to 1 mg/l, an activity comparable with or superior to that of ofloxacin and superior to those of fleroxacin and norfloxacin. Temafloxacin, although more active against anaerobes, was in general slightly less active than ciprofloxacin. Against Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus (including MRSA) temafloxacin was twice as active as ciprofloxacin. The pharmacokinetics of temafloxacin were studied in six volunteers, following a single 400 mg oral dose, measuring concentrations in plasma, inflammatory fluid and urine. Mean peak plasma levels of 3.3 mg/l were achieved. The mean plasma elimination half life was 6.8 h and the percentage penetration into blister fluid was 104.5%. Of the administered dose 51.8% was excreted in urine by 26 h. Serum and blister fluid levels in excess of 1 mg/l were present for at least 8 h post dose, suggesting that a once or twice daily dosing regimen would be suitable for the treatment of infections caused by susceptible organisms.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of BO-1341, a new antipseudomonal cephalosporin.
AB  - BO-1341, a new antipseudomonal semisynthetic cephalosporin, was evaluated for in  vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities in comparison with ceftazidime, cefotaxime, and cefoperazone. The in vitro activity of BO-1341 was generally superior or comparable to the activities of the reference antibiotics against clinical isolates of the family Enterobacteriaceae. BO-1341 was highly active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC for 90% of the strains tested, 1.56 micrograms/ml), Pseudomonas maltophilia (MIC for 50% of the strains tested, 1.56 micrograms/ml), and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (MIC for 90% of the strains tested, 3.13 micrograms/ml). Furthermore, BO-1341 was highly active against P. aeruginosa isolates resistant to the other antibiotics. Of 199 P. aeruginosa isolates tested, only 2 were resistant to BO-1341. These two strains were also resistant to ceftazidime, cefotaxime, and cefoperazone. Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis, and nonenteric streptococci were also susceptible to BO-1341, but Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, and Bacteroides fragilis were not susceptible to the compound. The protective efficacy against experimental infections in mice caused by nine strains of gram-negative bacteria, including P. aeruginosa, reflected the potent in vitro activity.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of AT-4140, a new broad-spectrum quinolone.
AB  - AT-4140, 5-amino-1-cyclopropyl-6,8-difluoro-1,4-dihydro-7-(cis-3,5- dimethyl-1-piperazinyl)-4-oxoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid, showed broad and potent antibacterial activity. Its MICs for 90% of the strains tested were 0.1 to 0.78 micrograms/ml against gram-positive organisms, such as members of the genera Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, and Enterococcus, and 0.0125 to 1.56 micrograms/ml against gram-negative organisms, such as members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and the genera Pseudomonas, Branhamella, Campylobacter, Haemophilus, and Neisseria. Its MICs were 0.025 to 0.78 micrograms/ml against glucose nonfermenters, such as members of the genera Xanthomonas, Acinetobacter, Alcaligenes, Moraxella, Flavobacterium, and Brucella; 0.2 to 0.78 micrograms/ml against anaerobes, such as Clostridium perfringens and Bacteroides fragilis; 0.0125 to 0.05 micrograms/ml against Legionella spp.; 0.0125 to 0.2 micrograms/ml against Mycoplasma spp.; 0.031 to 0.063 micrograms/ml against Chlamydia spp.; and 0.1 to 0.3 micrograms/ml against Mycobacterium spp. The potencies of AT-4140 against gram-negative organisms were comparable to those of ciprofloxacin and higher than those of ofloxacin, enoxacin, and norfloxacin. The potencies of AT-4140 against gram-positive organisms, glucose nonfermenters, anaerobes, Mycoplasma spp., Chlamydia spp., and Mycobacterium spp. were generally higher than those of the quinolones with which AT-4140 was compared. AT-4140 showed good oral efficacy against systemic infections with Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in mice. Its efficacy was better when a daily dose was given once than when it was given in two doses. Good efficacies of the orally administered drug were also observed in pulmonary, dermal, and urinary tract infection models in mice. The in vivo efficacies of AT-4140 were equal to or better than those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, enoxacin, and norfloxacin.
TI  - The role of beta-lactamase in mixed infections in mice in relation to treatment with ampicillin.
AB  - Beta-lactamase-producing Staphylococcus aureus and Bacteroides fragilis in a localized mixed infection has been found to degrade the beta-lactam antibiotic at the focus of infection, thus protecting both the bacteria and pathogens susceptible to the antibiotic. To determine if beta-lactamase produced by Hemophilus influenzae and Branhamella catarrhalis have similar importance in mixed infections, a thread infection model in mice was used to evaluate the capacity of beta-lactamase produced by S. aureus, B. catarrhalis, or H. influenzae to hydrolyze ampicillin in a mixed infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae in mice. For both S. aureus and B. catarrhalis, the ampicillin concentrations at infection sites where beta-lactamase was produced were lower than at sites where beta-lactamase was not produced; however, this difference was not found when clavulanic acid was added to the ampicillin. In mixed infections with strains that did not produce beta-lactamase, ampicillin concentrations were similar with or without clavulanic acid. S. aureus was the best "protector" followed by B. catarrhalis. The beta-lactamase produced by H. influenzae failed to protect the S. pneumoniae. No bactericidal effect of clavulanic acid was found.
TI  - Intravenous sulbactam/ampicillin in the treatment of pediatric infections.
AB  - A total of 82 patients involving 83 episodes of proven or presumed bacterial infection were treated with sulbactam/ampicillin. These included 36 cases of soft tissue infection or abscess, four cases of joint or bone infection, 20 cases of respiratory tract infection (17 cases of pneumonia, two of otitis media, and one of tonsillitis), 15 urinary tract infections, three cases of enterocolitis, one case of infective endocarditis, two cases of septicemia, and two of peritonitis. The causative pathogen was isolated in 48 cases (49 infections). These pathogens included Staphylococcus aureus 13 cases, Staphylococcus epidermidis one, Streptococcus pyogenes two, Streptococcus pneumoniae two, Viridans group streptococcus two, peptostreptococcus one, Haemophilus influenzae one, Escherichia coli 12, Enterobacter cloacae three, Proteus mirabilis one, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus one, Salmonella spp. two, Shigella sonnei one, Bacteroides fragilis one, and polymicrobial infections of various combinations in five cases. No bacterial pathogens were isolated in 34 infections, 14 cases of pneumonia and 15 soft tissue infections. Sulbactam/ampicillin was given by intravenous bolus in a dosage range of 75-450 mg/kg/day in four divided doses for variable periods of time depending on the type and severity of the infection. Of a total of 83 episodes of infections, 80 (96.4%) cases were either cured or improved. Bacteriologic eradication also occurred in 46 (93.9%) of 49 infections. Side effects were diarrhea in two patients, acute hemolytic anemia in one patient, and transient elevations in SGOT and leukopenia in one patient. Side effects disappeared upon completion of treatment. Sulbactam/ampicillin is a safe and effective antibiotic for the treatment of common pediatric infections.
TI  - In vitro activity of S-ofloxacin.
AB  - S-Ofloxacin, the optically active form of ofloxacin, was twice as active as the S,R mixture of ofloxacin against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and gram-positive species. Of the Enterobacteriaceae, 90% were inhibited by less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml and 90% of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes isolates were inhibited by 0.5 microgram/ml. Bacteroides fragilis was inhibited by 4 micrograms/ml. Organisms resistant to ofloxacin were resistant to S-ofloxacin. Like ofloxacin activity, the activity of S-ofloxacin was reduced by Mg2+ and by acid pH. Spontaneous mutational resistance to S-ofloxacin was similar to that to ofloxacin.
TI  - Comparison of the in vitro activities of fenticonazole, other imidazoles, metronidazole, and tetracycline against organisms associated with bacterial vaginosis and skin infections.
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activity of the antifungal compound fenticonazole was  compared with those of clotrimazole, miconazole, tetracycline, and metronidazole against 177 strains of bacterial species associated with either bacterial vaginosis (BV) or skin infections by agar dilution MIC determinations. BV-associated Bacteroides isolates of the Bacteroides melaninogenicus-B. oralis group, Gardnerella vaginalis, Mobiluncus spp., and anaerobic, gram-positive cocci were highly susceptible to fenticonazole, clotrimazole, and miconazole; but Bacteroides spp. not associated with BV, Bacteroides ureolyticus and the Bacteroides fragilis group, were resistant. All Bacteroides strains were susceptible to metronidazole, but the susceptibility of G. vaginalis and Mobiluncus spp. varied. Among the skin bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus, coryneforms, and streptococci were highly susceptible to the imidazoles; but Staphylococcus epidermidis strains were generally resistant. This antibacterial activity may give fenticonazole a useful role in the topical treatment of vaginal discharge and in mycotic skin infections that are superinfected with bacteria.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of BMY 40062, a new fluoronaphthyridone.
AB  - The in vitro and in vivo activities of a new naphthyridone, BMY 40062, were compared with those of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. BMY 40062 showed about threefold more activity than ciprofloxacin showed and four- to eightfold more activity than ofloxacin showed against staphylococci, streptococci, and enterococci. BMY 40062 showed generally twofold less activity than ciprofloxacin showed against most species of the family Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter spp. but twofold more activity than ofloxacin showed against these organisms. BMY 40062 and ofloxacin were more active than ciprofloxacin against Bacteroides fragilis and Clostridium difficile. The antiureaplasmal and antichlamydial activities of BMY 40062 were similar to those of the tetracyclines and were 4- and 16-fold, respectively, higher than those of ciprofloxacin. The in vitro activities of BMY 40062 were influenced by pH and magnesium, although these factors appeared to affect the activity of BMY 40062 against P. aeruginosa to a lesser extent than those of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. BMY 40062 was found to be bactericidal, and cross-resistance with other fluoroquinolones was observed. In mouse protection tests, the efficacy of BMY 40062 reflected its in vitro potency. BMY 40062 exhibited longer half-life, higher maximum concentration in serum, greater area under the curve, and better bioavailability in mice after oral dosing than ciprofloxacin. Compared with ofloxacin, BMY 40062 had a lower maximum concentration in serum but a much longer half-life in mice. BMY 40062 was more effective than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin in penetrating mouse macrophages and killing macrophage-associated Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Comparative study of clindamycin, imipenem, oxacillin and vancomycin in the infected granuloma pouch model.
AB  - In a rat granuloma pouch model, Staphylococcus aureus infection was treated with  clindamycin, oxacillin or vancomycin and Bacteroides fragilis infection with clindamycin or imipenem. The model simulates a subcutaneous abscess and has the advantage of permitting frequent sampling of exudate for bacterial counts and antibiotic levels in the same animal. In staphylococcal infection all drugs reduced the bacterial counts in the infected pouch by 1-1.7 log, with a significant effect lasting for 3 h after the last injection. A 1.06-1.4 log reduction lasted for 24 h with clindamycin and oxacillin, but there was only an 0.3 log reduction at 24 h with vancomycin. The ratio of the drug concentration in the infected pouch to the MIC was highest with clindamycin (2.3) compared to oxacillin (1.6) and vancomycin (0.8). With Bact. fragilis infection the bacterial counts dropped 1.5 log at 3 h after the last injection with clindamycin and imipenem. At 24 h the counts were reduced 1.0 log with clindamycin and 0.5 log with imipenem. The ratios of pouch fluid concentration to MIC was 7.6 and 4.08 for imipenem and clindamycin, respectively, at 3 h, and 1.0 and 2.3 for imipenem and clindamycin at 24 h.
TI  - In vitro activity of YTR 830.
AB  - YTR 830, now known as tazobactam, is a new penicillanic acid sulfone beta-lactamase inhibitor. The in vitro activity of YTR 830 combined with various penicillins was determined and compared to that of clavulanate and sulbactam combined with the same agents. Combined with ampicillin or amoxicillin, all three inhibitors were active against beta-lactamase producing strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella, Citrobacter diversus, and all anaerobes except for Bacteroides fragilis homology group II. YTR 830 was also effective against Escherichia coli and indole-positive Proteus. The inhibitors had no effect against Enterobacter or Serratia. Overall, the activity of YTR 830 was comparable to that of clavulanate, and superior to that of sulbactam.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of Ro 23-9424, a novel ester-linked codrug of fleroxacin and desacetylcefotaxime.
AB  - Ro 23-9424 is a novel ester-linked codrug of fleroxacin (Ro 23-6240; AM-833) and  the cefotaxime metabolite desacetylcefotaxime. Its potency was determined against over 1,000 organisms and found to be intermediate between those of the two components. More than 99% of members of the family Enterobacteriaceae were inhibited by greater than or equal micrograms of Ro 23-9424 per ml; its MIC for 50% of strains tested ranged from greater than or equal to 0.06 to 1 micrograms/ml. Staphylococci, streptococci, Branhamella catarrhalis, Corynebacterium jeikeium, Bacillus spp., Haemophilus influenzae, Listeria monocytogenes, and the pathogenic Neisseria spp., including oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, beta-lactamase-producing strains, and penicillin-resistant pneumococci, were also inhibited by Ro 23-9424. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus spp., and Bacteroides fragilis group isolates were more refractory to Ro 23-9424 (the MIC for 90% of strains tested was less than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml). Overall, Ro 23-9424 inhibited 97% of the aerobic strains, compared with 90% for ceftazidime and 92% for cefoperazone. Ro 23-9424 was bactericidal, was relatively stable to inoculum effects on MICs at 10(7) CFU/ml, and was determined to be highly active against organisms resistant to fluoroquinolones or ceftazidime. Preliminary quality control guidelines were determined, and a 30-micrograms disk concentration appears to be the most usable form.
TI  - In vivo pH of induced soft-tissue abscesses in diabetic and nondiabetic mice.
AB  - Infections in the diabetic host have been shown to persist longer than those in the nondiabetic host. To investigate whether intra-abscess milieu might be a contributing factor to this persistence, the in vivo intra-abscess pH was measured in induced soft-tissue abscesses in diabetic and nondiabetic mice. Two models (female genetically obese insulin-resistant and male streptozocin-induced diabetic mice) were used with appropriate controls. The bacteria injected to produce the soft-tissue abscesses were Bacteroides fragilis and Enterococcus (B + E), Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus (S + E), and S. aureus (SA). Intra-abscess pH measured on day 3 was consistently and significantly lower in all diabetic mice compared with their controls. In the diabetic mice, the pH of an abscess induced with B + E, S + E, and SA was 6.28 (n = 17), 6.79 (n = 10), and 6.52 (n = 10), respectively; the pH in the controls was 7.21 (n = 20), 7.30 (n = 10), and 7.17 (n = 10), respectively. Differences in all groups between diabetic and nondiabetic mice were significant. The blood glucose values of the diabetic mice averaged 722 mg/dl, and in the nondiabetic mice were 210 mg/dl. No animals were ketotic. There were no significant differences in total colony counts between any groups. In conclusion, there is a significantly lower pH in the abscess of the diabetic host compared with the nondiabetic host that is not related to the numbers or types of causative bacteria.
TI  - Inoculum effect.
AB  - The inoculum effect (IE) is a laboratory phenomenon that is described as a significant increase in the minimal inhibitory concentration of an antibiotic when the number of organisms inoculated is increased. The IE generally occurs with beta-lactam antibiotics in relation to beta-lactamase-producing bacteria. An IE occurs with the first- and second-generation cephalosporins against Staphylococcus aureus and less often with the quinolones, beta-lactam-resistant penicillins, cefoxitin, and aminoglycosides. An IE occurs with the penicillins against the Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas species, and a variable IE occurs with cephalosporins; however, no IE occurs with aminoglycosides, quinolones, imipenem, and chloramphenicol against these organisms. An IE occurs with beta-lactam antibiotics against Haemophilus influenzae and with the penicillins and the cephalosporins against penicillinase-producing Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Branhamella catarrhalis. An IE occurs with the penicillins and cephalosporins against the Bacteroides fragilis group; no IE occurs with cefoxitin and imipenem. Although certain antibiotics exhibit an IE, they are still capable of eradicating infections when administered appropriately. Thus, the clinical significance of this laboratory phenomenon has yet to be elucidated.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. A study mainly focused on ofloxacin (the second report). Reported by the Research Group for Testing ofloxacin Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - Susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (OFLX) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures throughout Japan between April, 1986 and March, 1987. The results were totalized with an emphasis mainly on OFLX and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. In this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. Similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to OFLX included Staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), Entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), Escherichia coli (4,097 strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), Enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), Enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), Citrobacter freundii (406 strains), Proteus mirabilis (613 strains), Morganella morganii (320 strains), Serratia marcescens (869 strains), Haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), Acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and Campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). Neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to OFLX was investigated with this species. As results, OFLX showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, E. aerogenes, C. freundii, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, H. influenzae, A. calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp., and C. jejuni. However, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. The following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: Streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), Streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), Enterococcus faecium (146 strains), Branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), Citrobacter diversus (128 strains), Klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), Proteus vulgaris (438 strains), Serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), Pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), Pseudomonas putida (154 strains), Xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), Vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), Bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),
TI  - Activities and sources of beta-lactamase in sputum from patients with bronchiectasis.
AB  - beta-Lactamase activity was measured in secretions from patients with bronchiectasis. Of 28 sputum samples, 23 contained measurable amounts of activity; values were significantly higher (P less than 0.01) in purulent samples than in mucoid or mucopurulent samples. beta-Lactamase activity was usually present in saliva collected before and between sputum expectorations, although values for sputum were higher than for either group of saliva samples (P less than 0.025 and P less than 0.005, respectively). This difference suggests that at least part of sputum beta-lactamase activity originates in the bronchial tree. Detailed microbiological study of a further eight specimens (seven were beta-lactamase positive) led to the isolation of Haemophilus influenzae from six, although only two of these isolates were beta-lactamase positive. Several other beta-lactamase-producing organisms were also isolated, including Staphylococcus aureus (n = 3), Escherichia coli (n = 1), Proteus spp. (n = 1), and Bacteroides spp. (n = 3). Size-exclusion high-performance liquid chromatography of the sputum showed several peaks of beta-lactamase activity which usually coeluted in fractions similar to those of their beta-lactamase-positive isolates. Therefore, sources of sputum beta-lactamases are often bacteria not considered truly pathogenic or not isolated during routine bacteriological assessment. These observations should be considered when embarking on antimicrobial therapy in bronchiectatic patients and suggest that increased dosages of penicillins are indicated.
TI  - The role of glycocalyx in surface phagocytosis of Bacteroides spp., in the presence and absence of clindamycin.
AB  - The influence of isolated glycocalyx from Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and B. fragilis on surface phagocytosis of clindamycin-treated and -untreated homologous and heterologous species was studied. When homologous or heterologous isolated glycocalyx was added to clindamycin-treated B. thetaiotaomicron or B. fragilis before incubation with PMNL, phagocytosis was reduced to levels observed in the untreated control bacteria, but addition of glycocalyx to untreated control strains showed no reduction of phagocytosis. When isolated bacteroides-glycocalyx was added to Staphylococcus aureus or S. epidermidis, phagocytosis of both clindamycin-treated and -untreated bacteria was significantly reduced. The isolated glycocalyx preparations were analysed by thin layer and gas-liquid chromatography; these preparations were free of lipopolysaccharides. The isolated glycocalyx did not affect PMNL viability. Our findings suggest that the glycocalyx is an important virulence factor because it impairs phagocytosis of Bacteroides spp. by PMNL. Clindamycin may enhance opsonophagocytosis of bacteroides by altering the glycocalyx.
TI  - [Epidemiology of the resistance to antibiotics at the Hospital Center of Aulnay-sous-Bois].
AB  - Over the 14 month period (1/6/87-1/8/88) the majority of the bacteremia observed  in the intensive unit (C.H. d'Aulnay) was due to Gram-positive bacteria (16/23 cases). The incidence of resistant to methicillin Staphylococcus aureus (SAMR) in blood culture was 10% in 1986 and 14% in 1987. Resistance of S. pneumoniae to penicillin was not detected; 30% of the 72 strains were resistant to erythromycin and 26% to tetracycline. Among Enterobacteriaceae, third generation cephalosporin is uncommon (2.8%) as gentamicin resistance (4.5%). Among the anaerobes, 57% of non Bacteroides fragilis group are resistant to penicillin. Nitroimidazole resistance was not detected.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of cervical mucus in pregnant or non-pregnant women].
AB  - Antibacterial activities of human cervical mucus obtained from non-pregnant and pregnant women were tested using standard blood agar plates. The combined effect of cervical mucus with cefmetazole (CMZ) was also investigated. Obtained results are summarized as follows. 1. Cervical mucus specimens obtained from 6 subjects at 9 to 36 weeks of pregnancy showed antibacterial activity to only one strain of Bacillus subtilis among organisms tested. The cervical mucus enhanced the activity of CMZ against 1 strain of Streptococcus pyogenes and 2 strains of Micrococcus luteus, but no effect was observed against other organisms tested. 2. Cervical mucus specimens obtained from non-pregnant women showed antibacterial activities to 8 of 11 strains (72.7%) of B. subtilis tested. The cervical mucus enhanced the activities of CMZ against 1 strain of S. pyogenes and 3 strains of B. subtilis. The tested organisms included Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Bacteroides fragilis, S. pyogenes, B. subtilis, M. luteus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis, and Candida albicans, but, as described above, cervical mucus samples showed antimicrobial activities only against B. subtilis (9/17, 52.9%), and specimens obtained only from non-pregnant women or pregnant women with less than 11 weeks of pregnancy showed any antimicrobial activities.
TI  - In-vitro activity of a new penem FCE 22101.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of a new penem FCE 22101 was evaluated in comparison with other antimicrobial agents against 966 aerobic and anaerobic Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. FCE 22101 inhibited 90% of Enterobacteriaceae, Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae, H. ducreyi, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staph. epidermidis and group B streptococcus at concentrations of 0.12-4.0 mg/l. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was resistant with MIC90 of greater than 32 mg/l. Streptococcus faecalis displayed MIC90 of 16 mg/l. Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium spp., Peptococcus spp. and Peptostreptococcus spp. were inhibited at concentrations of 0.25-2.0 mg/l. beta-Lactamase-producing or methicillin resistant bacteria did not have significantly elevated MICs. FCE 22101 was generally less active than imipenem but more active than other beta-lactam antibiotics examined.
TI  - Comparative inhibitory and bactericidal activities of FCE 22101 against gram-positive cocci and anaerobes in vitro.
AB  - The inhibitory activity of penem FCE 22101 was compared with those of imipenem and other relevant antibiotics against over 500 clinical isolates of Gram-positive cocci and anaerobes. The relative bactericidal activities of FCE 22101 and imipenem were compared by a killing curve method. FCE 22101 showed good inhibitory activity against most aerobic Gram-positive cocci although generally less than imipenem. A substantial number of Staphylococcus aureus isolates (43%) were highly susceptible to imipenem (MIC less than 0.0015 mg/l); the mode MIC for FCE 22101 was 0.06 mg/l. Methicillin-resistant Staph. aureus (MRSA) were often slightly more susceptible to FCE 22101 than to imipenem. Streptococci were more susceptible to imipenem than to FCE 22101; mode MICs for group A streptococci were 0.003 and 0.03 mg/l and for enterococci 1 and 4 mg/l, respectively. The anaerobic organisms tested were equally susceptible to both FCE 22101 and imipenem. Imipenem and FCE 22101 showed similar bactericidal activity at a concentration equivalent to 4 x MIC. Fully susceptible staphylococci were killed rapidly by both compounds, whereas less susceptible isolates, especially MRSA, were killed slowly. Streptococci, other than Str. pneumoniae, were also killed relatively slowly. Bacteroides fragilis group organisms were rapidly killed by both FCE 22101 and imipenem.
TI  - Activity of FCE 22891 compared with cefuroxime axetil and cefixime in pulmonary and subcutaneous infections in mice.
AB  - The therapeutic activity of FCE 22891 was compared with that of two new oral cephalosporins, cefuroxime axetil and cefixime against Streptococcus pneumoniae respiratory infection and subcutaneous abscesses induced by mixed aerobes and anaerobes in mice. In experimental pneumonia FCE 22891 was the most active antibiotic. In aerobic abscesses FCE 22891 proved the most active agent in infections induced by methicillin susceptible and resistant Staphylococcus aureus while all three compounds were very active, against Str. pyogenes. In abscesses caused by Gram-negative bacteria, FCE 22891 showed good and constant efficacy. Cefixime was the most active drug against the two susceptible strains of Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae and also against resistant Esch. coli but was inactive against a strain of Ent. cloacae that produced cephalosporinase. Cefuroxime axetil was less active than the other two drugs against Gram-negative bacteria with adequate efficacy only against a susceptible strain of Ent. cloacae. FCE 22891 was more effective than cefixime and cefuroxime axetil in preventing and reducing the size of abscesses induced by Bacteroides fragilis 101. We conclude that FCE 22891, despite its short half life of 6 min in mice, exerts comparable and sometimes better activity than the two oral cephalosporins characterized by longer half lives.
TI  - A clinical evaluation of sulbactam/ampicillin in the treatment of pediatric infections.
AB  - We have treated 42 episodes of pediatric infections with sulbactam/ampicillin since 1987. Included were 9 cellulitis, 9 urinary tract infections, 5 cervical lymphadenitis, 4 meningitis, 2 thoracic empyema, 2 osteomyelitis, 2 sepsis, 1 furuncle, 1 perianal abscess, 1 dental abscess, 1 peritonsillitis, 1 salmonellosis, 1 shigellosis, 1 peritonitis, 1 suppurative thyroiditis, 1 infective endocarditis. Responsible pathogens were Escherichia coli in 8, Staphylococcus aureus in 6, Hemophilus influenzae in 2, Streptococcus pneumoniae in 3, Streptococcus viridans in 2, Staphylococcus epidermidis in 1, Bacteroides fragilis in 1, Salmonella D1 in 1, Shigella sonnei in 1, Klebsiella pneumoniae in 1, Enterobacter agglomerans in 1, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus in 1, Enterobacter cloacae in 1, group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus in 1, and polymicrobial infection in 4 cases. Thirty-nine out of 41 (95%) clinically evaluable patients cured and all (34/34) bacteriologically evaluable patients eradicated their pathogens after treatment with sulbactam/ampicillin. Side reactions were seen in five patients; one maculopapular skin rash, one hemolytic anemia, two diarrhea, and one liver function impairment plus leukopenia. All these reactions were transient and did not require interruption of therapy. These results indicate that sulbactam/ampicillin is safe and effective in the treatment of common pediatric infections beyond the neonatal period.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of lomefloxacin, a new difluoroquinolone.
AB  - The in vitro activity of lomefloxacin, a new difluoroquinolone, was compared with that of norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin and ceftazidime against a total of 577 recent clinical isolates. MICs were determined by a standard agar dilution procedure, and two inocula (10(4) and 10(6) CFU) were used throughout. Lomefloxacin inhibited most species of the Enterobacteriaceae, Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant strains) and Haemophilus influenzae at less than or equal to 1 mg/l. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC 90, 4 mg/l) was somewhat more resistant, and Pseudomonas maltophilia (MIC 90, 16 mg/l) and the Bacteroides fragilis group (MIC 90, 32 mg/l) were considerably more resistant. Overall, lomefloxacin was as active as norfloxacin, but was two- to eightfold less active than ciprofloxacin against most species tested.
TI  - Clinical evaluation of imipenem/cilastatin in the therapy of severe infections in high-risk patients.
AB  - A clinical trial was carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment with  imipenem/cilastatin in life-threatening infections in high-risk patients. Thirty hospitalized patients (22 men and 8 women), aged 28 to 78 years, with impaired host defences and severe infections were treated with imipenem/cilastatin at a dosage ranging between 1 and 3 g daily i.v. at 8 or 12 h intervals. The average length of therapy was 8.61 +/- 3.14 days. The isolated organisms were as follows: Escherichia coli [7], Pseudomonas aeruginosa [9], Staphylococcus aureus [5], Streptococcus faecalis [3], Strep. viridans [1], Proteus mirabilis [1], P. vulgaris [2], Klebsiella pneumoniae [2], Citrobacter freundii [2], Bacteroides fragilis [2]. In only one patient the aetiological agent remained unknown and in five patients (16.67%) a mixed infection was observed. Twenty-four patients (80%) were completely cured of infection and 29 isolated organisms (82.86%) were eradicated. No important side-effects were observed.
TI  - Anaerobic bacteria in brain abscess, a review; observation of 18 consecutive cases.
AB  - The aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora of 18 consecutive cases of brain abscesses were studied. Two cases were sterile. In five cases there was a single bacterial isolate. In five cases there was a single bacterial isolate the organism being Staphylococcus aureus in two cases, Bacteroides fragilis in two cases and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius in one case. In the remaining eleven cases, more than one organism was isolated. A combination of anaerobe with an aerobe was observed in five cases and infections with more than one anaerobe in as many as six cases. Anaerobic organisms are the important pathogens in brain abscess and occurrence of infections by more than one organism is a common factor.
TI  - Direct and indirect pathogenicity of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria in mixed infections in children.
AB  - The recent emergence of numerous aerobic and anaerobic beta-lactamase-producing bacterial strains has been associated with an increase in the failure rate of penicillins in the therapy of infection caused by these organisms. These include respiratory tract, skin of soft tissue, female genital tract, intra-abdominal, and other miscellaneous infections. The important aerobic beta-lactamase-producing bacteria (BLPB) include Staphylococcus aureus, Branhamella catarrhalis, Haemophilus sp., Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Legionella sp. The anaerobic BLPB are all Bacteroidiaceae and include Bacteroides fragilis group, B. melaninogenicus group, B. oralis, B. oris-buccae, and Fusobacterium sp. Laboratory, animal, and clinical studies that support the indirect pathogenicity of these organisms and the distribution of these BLPB in various infections are reviewed. BLPB may not only have a direct pathogenic role in causing the infection, but also an indirect pathogenic role. The indirect pathogenicity of these organisms is apparent through their ability not only to survive penicillin therapy, but also to protect penicillin-susceptible pathogens from that drug. These direct and indirect virulence characteristics of aerobic and anaerobic BLPB require the administration of appropriate antimicrobial therapy directed against all pathogens in mixed infections.
TI  - [Comparative study of the antimicrobial effect of various cavity liners used in conservative dentistry].
AB  - We have compared the microbiological activity of the following cavity liners: Life, Dycal II, Calcipulpe, Pure calcium hydroxide and Cavitec; against five different bacterial strains: Veillonella parvula, Bacteroides fragilis, Peptococcus s.p., Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus beta hemolytic: The results demonstrate the higher antimicrobial activity of the manufactured cavity liners with calcium hydroxide base in comparison with the pure calcium hydroxide.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of FK482, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  - FK482 is a new orally active cephem antibiotic which offers some advantages over  the commercially available oral beta-lactam antibiotics. It displayed a broad spectrum of activity in vitro against stock strains of Gram-positive and Gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. FK482 was more active in vitro than cefixime (CFIX), cefaclor (CCL) or cephalexin (CEX) against clinical isolates of Gram-positive organisms such as methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative Staphylococci including Staphylococcus epidermidis and strains of the Streptococcus group. Moderate activity was found against methicillin-resistant S. aureus and Enterococcus faecalis. Against clinical isolates of many Gram-negative species, including opportunistic pathogens, FK482 had good in vitro activity similar or slightly inferior to that of CFIX but superior to that of CCL or CEX. However, it was clearly inferior to CFIX in activity against Serratia marcescens, and was inactive against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Strains of S. aureus resistant to methicillin were moderately susceptible to FK482. All tested strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae resistant to CCL and CEX were susceptible to FK482, as were all the strains of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae and Branhamella catarrhalis resistant to amoxicillin (AMPC). FK482, like CFIX, was relatively stable to all type of beta-lactamases except Bacteroides fragilis and its stability was superior to that of CCL or CEX. The antibacterial activity of FK482 against CSH2 strains containing ampicillin-resistance plasmids was not affected by the presence of the ampicillin resistance determinants. FK482 showed higher affinity for the penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) (3, 2 and 1) of S. aureus than did CFIX, CCL and CEX. FK482 also showed very high affinity for the PBPs (2 and 3) of E. faecalis and PBPs (3, 1a, 4, 2 and 1 bs) of E. coli. The bactericidal activity of FK482 against S. aureus was almost as strong as that of AMPC and superior to that of CCL or CEX. Against Gram-negative bacteria such as E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. mirabilis, FK482 was similar to CFIX and superior to CCL and CEX in bactericidal activity.
TI  - [Evaluation of imipenem/cilastatin sodium in neonatal infections].
AB  - Ten patients with infections (8 neonates and 2 infants) were treated with 10.2 mg/10.2 mg/kg-37.7 mg/37.7 mg/kg of imipenem/cilastatin sodium (IPM/CS) b.i.d. or t.i.d. by a 1-hour intravenous drip infusion. The plasma concentrations of IPM/CS were determined in 5 of the 10 patients and in the cerebrospinal fluid of 1 patient of the 5. 1. The patients studied included 5 with pneumonia and 1 each with urinary tract infection, omphalitis, suspected meningitis, periproctal abscess and suspected septicemia. Clinical efficacy was evaluated in 9 patients: the patient with suspected meningitis was excluded from the clinical evaluation because the infection was doubtfully due to bacteria. Responses were excellent in 4 and good in 5 patients. No patient with a poor response was observed. All of the 6 etiological isolates obtained from 5 patients (2 strains of Staphylococcus aureus and 1 each of Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus agalactiae and Bacteroides fragilis) were eradicated. 2. As for side effects, rash was observed in 1 patient and petechiae accompanied by decreases in platelets and reticulocytes and increases in GOT and GPT were observed in another. Other abnormal laboratory test values in addition to the above abnormalities consisted of an increase in GPT in 1 patient and increases in GOT and GPT in another. These side effects and abnormalities in laboratory test values were mild and normalized after discontinuation or completion of IPM/CS administration.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of human cervical mucus].
AB  - The antibacterial activity of human cervical mucus in non pregnant or pregnant women were investigated employing the standard blood agar plates. Antibacterial activity of lysozyme and combined effect of lysozyme with cefmetazole (CMZ) were also investigated. The results obtained are summarized as follows: 1. Cervical mucus had an antibacterial activity against Bacillus subtilis, but had no antibacterial activity to any other organisms tested. When cervical mucus was heated at 100 degrees C for 5 minutes, its antibacterial activity was lost. 2. Antibacterial activity of cervical mucus combined with CMZ were obtained against Streptococcus pyogenes only, and no effect was observed against other organisms. 3. Lysozyme had an antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli, B. subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacteroides fragilis, but when combined with CMZ no antibacterial activity was observed.
TI  - Cefuroxime axetil.
AB  - Cefuroxime axetil is a orally active prodrug formulation of cefuroxime, which upon absorption undergoes immediate deesterification to free cefuroxime. Cefuroxime axetil offers an in vitro antibacterial spectrum against many gram-positive and some gram-negative organisms. Its beta-lactamase stability makes it useful in treating a variety of infections caused by beta-lactamase-producing strains of Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis, and Staphylococcus aureus. Cefuroxime axetil has good activity against the Enterobacteriaceae and moderate activity against non-Bacteroides fragilis anaerobes. Clinical studies suggest it is at least as effective as ampicillin, amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, penicillin V, or cefaclor in the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections, acute otitis media, upper respiratory infections, skin and soft tissue infections, and uncomplicated gonorrhea.
TI  - Worldwide assessment of the activity of cefotetan against clinical isolates.
AB  - Data on the antibacterial activity of cefotetan collected since 1985 have been compiled into a computer database and an analysis of results on more than 100,000 clinical isolates presented. The studies were conducted in 285 hospitals located throughout Europe, South Africa, Australia and the USA. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of cefotetan as a broad spectrum agent with significant activity against clinically important aerobes and anaerobes. This is exemplified by the susceptibility to cefotetan of 92% of 14,315 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 99% of 24,103 strains of Escherichia coli and 93% of 1,841 strains of Bacteroides fragilis.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies of cefuzonam in the field  of obstetrics and gynecology. Study group of cefuzonam in the field of obstetrics and gynecological infections].
AB  - A multi-center open study was conducted to investigate cefuzonam (CZON, L-105) regarding to its pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical aspects in the field of obstetrics and gynecology with the participation of 31 medical institutions and the related facilities. The results are summarized as follows. 1. Peak MICs of CZON for Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase (-) staphylococci, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Bacteroides fragilis group, Peptostreptococcus spp. isolated from obstetrical and gynecological infections with relatively high frequencies were 0.39, 0.20, 0.024, 0.024-0.05, 12.5, 0.20 microgram/ml, respectively, with an inoculum size of 10(6) CFU/ml. 2. When 1 g of CZON was given through bolus injection, the maximum concentration (Cmax) of CZON in pelvic dead space exudate was 18.7 micrograms/ml at 60.9 minutes (Tmax) after the injection; Cmax's in all female genital tissues were observed at 0.6-27.9 minutes and ranged from 11.9-26.3 micrograms/g. The Cmax 8.3 micrograms/ml, in the pelvic dead space exudate was noted at 97.0 minutes after the end of the intravenous drip infusion of 1 g over 1 hour, and Cmax's in genital tissues were 14.3-30.0 micrograms/g at the end of infusion. With 1 hour drip infusion of 2 g, Cmax's in genital tissues were 35.0-53.9 micrograms/g at the end of infusion. 3. The clinical efficacy of CZON was evaluated in 206 evaluable patients with obstetric and gynecologic infections. Efficacy rates classified by types of infections were 97.1% (67/69) for intrauterine infections, 81.6% (31/38) for intrapelvic infections, 91.8% (45/49) for adnexitis, 95.2% (20/21) for infections of the external genital organs and 86.2% (25/29) for other infections. 4. Side effects were observed in 7 of the 262 patients: eruption in 6 cases, itching in 2, diarrhea in 1. Abnormal laboratory test values were noted in 9 of the 256 patients. Most of them were slight elevation of hepatic function values. CZON showed satisfactory clinical efficacy and potent antibacterial activity, hence it appears that CZON will be a very useful antibiotic for obstetric and gynecologic infections.
TI  - The effects of chronic bacteremia on the metabolic response to exercise in the conscious rat.
AB  - Cardiac function was indirectly assessed in a rat model of chronic sepsis by measuring maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) during exercise. A subcutaneous abscess cavity was created in rats by implanting a gauze sponge in the hindquarter area. Animals with sterile abscesses were compared with rats that had the abscess cavity infected with Escherichia coli and Bacteroides fragilis (gram-negative group) or these two organisms plus Staphylococcus aureus (gram-positive/negative group). VO2max was measured during exercise before and after the abscess cavity was infected. After a carotid artery cannula was placed, heart rate, mean arterial pressure, arterial blood gases, and acid-base status were measured in three groups of rats (sterile abscess, gram-negative, gram-positive/negative) during submaximal and maximal exercise. Results demonstrated that the infected rats were febrile and had elevated white blood cell counts and intermittent bacteremia, while rats with sterile abscesses did not. VO2max was similar in all groups of rats both before and after the abscess cavity was infected. The metabolic and hemodynamic variables measured during submaximal and maximal exercise in the different groups of rats were similar. These results do not support the contention that gram-positive and/or-negative bacteremia produce cardiac dysfunction during early sepsis.
TI  - Enhancement of growth of aerobic, anaerobic, and facultative bacteria in mixed infections with anaerobic and facultative gram-positive cocci.
AB  - The potential for mutual enhancement of growth of seven strains of anaerobic and  facultative gram-positive cocci (AFGPC), seven aerobic and facultative organisms, and two Bacteroides spp. commonly isolated with AFGPC in mixed infection was evaluated. Enhancement was studied by measuring the relative increase in the colony-forming units of the two bacterial components inducing subcutaneous abscesses in mice. Of the 56 combinations, AFGPC were enhanced in 6 and inhibited in 1. The aerobic and facultative bacteria were enhanced in 32 of the 42 combinations and depressed in none. The Bacteroides spp. were enhanced in 12 of the 14 combinations and suppressed in none. The organisms uniformly enhanced by AFGPC were Group A streptococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Bacteroides fragilis (all seven instances), followed by Escherichia coli (six of seven instances), Bacteroides asaccharolyticus and Klebsiella pneumoniae (five instances each), Staphylococcus aureus (four instances), and Group D streptococci (three instances). It is apparent that in mixed infection with AFGPC the rate of growth of Bacteroides spp. and facultative and aerobic bacteria is enhanced much more than the rate of growth of AFGPC.
TI  - Comparative susceptibility patterns of common clinical isolates to cefoperazone:  1981 to 1987.
AB  - It has been postulated that the widespread use of broad-spectrum cephalosporins might lead to increased bacterial resistance to such agents. To determine if such increased resistance to cefoperazone might be detectable, the susceptibility patterns of common clinical isolates to cefoperazone were examined from the Pathology Laboratories at Baptist Medical Center, Jacksonville, Florida, from 1981, prior to approval by the Food and Drug Administration, to the present. Gram-negative aerobic and facultative anaerobic organisms, staphylococci, and members of the Bacteroides fragilis group were included in the analysis. The data obtained were compared with results of similar published studies nationwide. No significant decrease in susceptibility to cefoperazone was detected for any gram-negative species examined. A steady increase in the percentage of staphylococci (both coagulase positive and especially coagulase negative) resistant to cefoperazone was demonstrable at this institution. This was a direct function of the concomitant rise in the percentages of staphylococci resistant to methicillin observed over the testing interval. Anaerobic susceptibility patterns of the members of the B. fragilis group were also relatively constant during this period of time. The concentrations of antibiotic inhibiting 50 percent (MIC50) and 90 percent (MIC90) of B. fragilis isolates as determined by an agar dilution technique were 16 micrograms/ml and 64 micrograms/ml, respectively, both in 1981 and in 1987. No change in the national susceptibility patterns of common bacterial isolates to cefoperazone was demonstrable in the five-year period during which the antibiotic has been available for clinical use.
TI  - Use of antibiotics in the management of postirradiation wound infection and sepsis.
AB  - Ionizing gamma irradiation depresses the host defenses and enhances the susceptibility of the immunocompromised host to local and systemic infection due to endogenous or exogenous microorganisms. Trauma and wounding act synergistically and decrease the survival after exposure to irradiation. The current antimicrobial agents suitable for controlling serious infections and their use in post irradiation local and systemic infection with and without trauma are discussed. The experience gained in managing immunocompromised patients following chemotherapy is reviewed. Empiric single agent or combination agent therapy should be directed at the eradication of potential gram-negative as well as gram-positive pathogens. The most important organisms known to cause these infections are Pseudomonas sp. and Enterobacteriaceae. Management of intra-abdominal infections following trauma should include early surgical correlation and antimicrobials directed against the Bacteroides fragilis group and Enterobacteriaceae. Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes cause most skin and soft tissue infections following trauma. Chemoprophylaxis of enteric sources of systemic infection can be achieved by antimicrobials that selectively inhibit the Enterobacteriaceae sp. and preserve the anaerobic flora. The management of infection in the injured and irradiated host includes supportive and restorative therapy. Supportive therapy includes debridement and cleansing of wounds, fluids, immunoglobulin, and antimicrobials. Restorative therapy includes definite surgery repair and replenishment of the immune system by use of immunomodulators, growth factors, and bone marrow transplantation. Further studies are needed to examine the usefulness of presently available drugs and experimental agents in the irradiated and traumatized host.
TI  - Synergy between spiramycin and metronidazole in the treatment of polymicrobial infections.
AB  - The in-vitro and in-vivo activity of metronidazole and spiramycin, singly or in combination, was tested in the eradication of infection caused by Bacteroides spp. alone and in combination with Neisseria gonorrhoea, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes or Str. faecalis. The in-vitro tests consisted of determinations of the MICs with or without the addition of a constant amount of the other antimicrobials. The MICs of metronidazole for B. melaninogenicus, B. fragilis and B. bivius were significantly reduced by the addition of 0.125 mg/l spiramycin. The in-vivo tests were carried out in mice and consisted of measurements of the effects of the antimicrobial agents on the bacterial contents of abscesses induced by subcutaneous injection of bacterial suspension. Combined therapy of mixed infections showed further significant reduction of the numbers of Bacteroides spp. in seven of 12 combinations and of the aerobic and facultative bacteria in four of 12 combinations. Furthermore, a reduction in the number of facultative anaerobes was noted in mixed infections with Bacteroides spp. which were treated with metronidazole alone. The synergy in vitro and in vivo between metronidazole and spiramycin may have important clinical implications in the treatment of polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic infections.
TI  - In-vitro microbiological activities of DuP 105 and DuP 721, novel synthetic oxazolidinones.
AB  - DuP 105 and 721, synthetic antibiotics belonging to a totally novel chemical class (oxazolidinones), have been found to be active in vitro against a wide range of Gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. DuP 721 had geometric mean MICs ranging from 1.1 to 16 mg/l against 167 strains of Staph. aureus, Staph. epidermidis, Staph. saprophyticus, streptococci of Groups A, B and D and diphtheroids. DuP 105 was between 1.5 and eight-fold less active. Bacteroides fragilis strains were also susceptible to the DuP compounds (mean MICs being 8.3 and 14.9 mg/l for DuP 721 and 105, respectively), but other Gram-negative species and yeasts were not inhibited by concentrations in excess of 100 mg/l. Both compounds had a predominantly bacteriostatic action. No primary resistance was found, and the incidence of resistant variants in 105 strains tested was less than 1 per 10(8) bacteria.
TI  - A multicenter comparative study of cefotetan once daily and cefoxitin thrice daily for the treatment of infections of the skin and superficial soft tissue.
AB  - To compare the effectiveness of cefotetan administered at 2 g once a day with cefoxitin at 1 or 2 g three times a day in the treatment of hospitalized patients with skin and superficial soft tissue infections, 194 patients from eight centers were enrolled in an open, randomized trial. Most of the 104 evaluable patients in the cefotetan group and 50 in the cefoxitin group were young men with community-acquired, moderate or severe cellulitis, or abscesses of the upper and lower extremities caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus species, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Bacteroides fragilis and other species of bacteroides, peptococcus species, and peptostreptococcus species. The mean duration of treatment was 7.5 days for cefotetan and 7.1 days for cefoxitin. A successful clinical response was achieved in 97 percent of the cefotetan patients and in 94 percent of the cefoxitin patients. Of the 88 and 39 bacteriologically evaluable patients in the cefotetan and cefoxitin groups, respectively, a satisfactory bacteriologic response occurred in 96 percent and 87 percent of the patients. No clinically significant changes in clinical laboratory determinations were noted. The incidence of adverse reactions in the cefotetan group (17 percent) was significantly different from that for the cefoxitin group (6 percent) (p less than 0.05); however, the incidence of treatment-related reactions was not significant and the events were mild. Discontinuation of therapy was necessary only in two patients in whom allergic-type reactions developed. A once-daily regimen of cefotetan was as effective as thrice-daily cefoxitin in this study in the treatment of primarily polymicrobial, moderate, or severe infections of the skin and superficial soft tissue.
TI  - Ciprofloxacin: in vitro, experimental, and clinical evaluation.
AB  - Ciprofloxacin at a concentration of 2 micrograms/mL inhibited the growth of approximately 90% of 584 strains of aerobic bacteria isolated from cultures of blood drawn from septicemic patients. An increase in the inoculum size did not result in an increased MIC, but serial passages through media containing ciprofloxacin at sub-MIC levels increased the MIC for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus vulgaris. In experimental subcutaneous abscesses in the mouse model, ciprofloxacin was more active than cefotaxime against a mixed infection induced with E. coli and Bacteroides fragilis. Against mixed E. coli and Staphylococcus aureus infection, no significant differences were noted between the two drugs. In a double-blind, prospective, randomized clinical study, perorally administered ciprofloxacin was compared with intravenously administered cefotaxime in the treatment of skin and soft-tissue infections severe enough to require hospitalization. In 70 patients treated, the therapeutic efficacy of peroral ciprofloxacin was comparable to that of intravenous cefotaxime, with two differences: S. aureus infections responded less favorably to oral ciprofloxacin (62%) than to intravenous cefotaxime (90%), and aerobic gram-negative bacillary infections responded more favorably to ciprofloxacin (92%) than to cefotaxime (64%).
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of a new fluorinated 4-quinolone, T-3262 (A-60969).
AB  - The in vitro activity of a new quinolone, T-3262 [A-60969; DL-7-(3-amino-1-pyrrolidinyl)-1-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-6-fluoro-1-, 4-dihydro-4-oxo-1,8-naphthyridine-3-carboxylic acid monohydrate], was compared with those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, ceftazidime, imipenem, and gentamicin. T-3262 inhibited 90% of isolates of the family Enterobacteriaceae at a concentration of less than or equal to 0.25 micrograms/ml. It was two to four times more active than ofloxacin and similarly or slightly less active than ciprofloxacin. Ninety percent of isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were inhibited at 0.5 micrograms/ml. It was 4- to 8-fold more active than ciprofloxacin and 8- to 16-fold more active than ofloxacin against Pseudomonas cepacia and Pseudomonas maltophilia, which were resistant to imipenem and gentamicin. Most Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Branhamella catarrhalis isolates were inhibited at concentrations of less than or equal to 0.008 micrograms/ml. The MIC for 90% of the Staphylococcus aureus isolates, including methicillin-resistant S. aureus, was 0.12 micrograms/ml; that for Staphylococcus epidermidis was 0.5 micrograms/ml, as was that for Enterococcus faecalis. It inhibited 90% of Bacteroides fragilis isolates at 2 micrograms/ml, considerably more active than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. The frequency of spontaneous point mutational resistance was less than 10(-10) for members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas spp. Resistant strains could be selected by repeated subculture. Similar to other quinolones, its activity could be affected by culture conditions. T-3262 showed a postantibiotic suppressive effect on Escherichia coli, P. aeruginosa, and S. aureus.
TI  - [In vitro synergy between cefotaxime and its main metabolite, desacetylcefotaxime].
AB  - In vitro synergistic interaction between cefotaxime (CTX) and its main metabolite, desacetyl-cefotaxime (DCTX), against 7 species of clinical isolates (23-27 strains per species) was examined. Complete or partial synergy was noted with a 1:1 combination of CTX and DCTX against 22-78% of the Bacteroides fragilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Citrobacter freundii, Pseudomonas cepacia and Enterobacter cloacae isolates examined. Antagonistic effects of the drugs appeared against 11% of Proteus vulgaris and 4% of Serratia marcescens. When combined at various ratios by the checkerboard method and tested against B. fragilis, CTX and DCTX were found to act synergistically, and no antagonism occurred. The combined use of CTX and DCTX exhibited strong bactericidal activity against B. fragilis and inhibited bacterial regrowth. An experiment with concentrations of CTX and DCTX simulating human serum levels after intravenous administration also showed that the coexistence of DCTX augmented bactericidal activity of CTX against B. fragilis and brought inhibitory effects on bacterial regrowth. It is presumed from the present results that clinically applied CTX would have more potent effects than expected from in vitro sensitivity test data.
TI  - [In vitro activity of roxithromycin against hospital bacteria and the concordance curve].
AB  - This study was set up to establish the regression curve for roxithromycin inhibition zone diameters (disks 15 micrograms) and MIC to create a strain distribution plot, in order to allow accurate interpretation of the disk diffusion method for testing susceptibility to roxithromycin. 373 bacterial strains were studied in three university hospital. Roxithromycin was active against erythromycin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase negative Staphylococci at concentrations of 0.06 to 4 micrograms/ml (mode 0.5). Erythromycin resistant strains were also resistant to roxithromycin. Enterococci could be divided into two populations, one resistant (MIC greater than 128 micrograms/ml) and the other with MIC of 0.5 to 32 (mode 1-2). This was also the case for Streptococci and Pneumococci with MIC lower for susceptible strains (mode 0.06-0.12). Roxithromycin was active on Haemophilus at concentrations of 0.12 to 32 micrograms/ml; MIC for beta-lactamase producing strains were comparable to those of strains not producing. MIC for Gonococci were low (less than 0.008 to 0.12), except for three strains. They were higher for Meningococci (0.03 to 32) with a majority of strains inhibited by 0.5 to 4 micrograms/ml. MIC were 4 for Clostridium perfringens; Bacteroides fragilis strains were inhibited by 0.5 to 2 micrograms/ml. The correlation coefficient for regression curve was 0.79; for critical concentrations less than or equal to 1 and greater than 4 micrograms/ml, critical diameters are greater than or equal to 22 and less than 17 mm.
TI  - In vitro activities of two oxazolidinone antimicrobial agents, DuP 721 and DuP 105.
AB  - The antibacterial activities of DuP 105 and DuP 721, new oxazolidinone antimicrobial agents, were compared with those of beta-lactams and glycopeptides. Ninety percent of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis isolates, including methicillin-resistant isolates, were inhibited by 4 micrograms of DuP 105 and 1 microgram of DuP 721 per ml. DuP 721 inhibited hemolytic streptococcus groups A, B, C, F, and G at a concentration of less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, and it inhibited viridans group streptococci at a concentration of 2 micrograms/ml. Both agents inhibited Listeria monocytogenes, Corynebacterium group JK species, anaerobic cocci, and Clostridium spp. including Clostridium difficile. They did not inhibit members of the family Enterobacteriaceae or Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but the MIC for 90% of Bacteroides fragilis isolates was 8 micrograms of DuP 721 per ml.
TI  - Beta-lactamase-producing bacteria in head and neck infection.
AB  - We have summarized our experience in recovery of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria (BLPB) in head and neck infection (HNI). These HNI include conjunctivitis, serous and chronic otitis media, cholesteatoma, chronic mastoiditis, chronic sinusitis, adenoiditis, recurrent tonsillitis in children and adults, peritonsillar abscess, and retropharyngeal abscess. Beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were found in 262 (51%) of 513 patients with HNI; 72% had aerobic BLPB and 57% had anaerobic BLPB. The infections, where these organisms were most frequently recovered, were adenoiditis (85% of patients), tonsillitis in adults (82%) and children (74%), retropharyngeal abscess (71%), and chronic otitis media (57%). The predominant BLPB were Staphylococcus aureus (49% of patients with BLPB), the Bacteroides-melaninogenicus group (28%), the Bacteroides fragilis group (20%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (13%), Hemophilus influenzae (5%), and Branhamella catarrhalis (3%). The high incidence of recovery of BLPB in head and neck infections may have important implications on the antimicrobial management of these infections.
TI  - Comparative in vitro beta-lactam activity against aerobic and anaerobic surgical  isolates.
AB  - The comparative in vitro activity of cefoxitin, piperacillin, cefotetan, and ceftizoxime was compared against 843 surgical microbial isolates. All compounds exhibited excellent activity against the streptococcal isolates. Antimicrobial activity was poor for Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis. Cefotetan activity against the Enterobacteriaceae was comparable to ceftizoxime (greater than 95% susceptible). Resistance rates of 0, 1, 5, and 2% were observed with cefoxitin, piperacillin, cefotetan, and ceftizoxime against the anaerobic cocci and anaerobic gram-positive non-spore-forming rods. Ninety-six and ninety-nine percent of the clostridial strains were susceptible to cefotetan and piperacillin, respectively. Piperacillin, cefotetan, and ceftizoxime exhibited similar activity against Bacteroides fragilis (resistance less than 10%). Cefotetan and cefoxitin exhibited poor activity against Bacteroides distasonis, B. ovatus, and B. thetaiotaomicron. Antimicrobial activities were comparable for the four drugs against other Bacteroides and Fusobacterium species. The results demonstrate that all four compounds exhibited broad antimicrobial activity against facultative and obligate anaerobic surgical isolates from intraabdominal and soft tissue infections.
TI  - Cefotaxime single-dose surgical prophylaxis in a prepaid group practice. Comparisons with other cephalosporins and ticarcillin/clavulanic acid.
AB  - The prophylactic efficacy of a single 1g dose of cefotaxime for a wide variety of clean and clean-contaminated surgical procedures was studied in a large prepaid medical practice setting. Regimens were evaluated in 3 successive prospective, randomised comparative trials involving 1950 evaluable patients between November 1983 and March 1986. Single-dose cefotaxime was initially compared with standard multiple-dose regimens of cephazolin and cefoxitin, and subsequently used as the control regimen for comparisons with single-dose cefoperazone and ticarcillin/clavulanic acid. Patients were observed for the development of wound infection, non-wound morbidity, and adverse reactions. The single-dose prophylaxis regimens resulted in fewer surgical wound infections (p less than 0.05) compared with multi-dose prophylaxis if colorectal procedures were excluded from the analyses. The limited effectiveness of single-dose prophylaxis in colorectal surgery occurred despite the co-administration of erythromycin and neomycin. More than half the infections in all groups were discovered after hospital discharge and were inconsequential. Organisms isolated from the various infections generally remained susceptible to the administered antimicrobial agents. Adverse reactions occurred significantly (p less than 0.001) less often in the patients receiving single-dose prophylaxis. Non-wound morbidity was comparable in all trial groups. The costs associated with single-dose regimens were much lower than those of the FDA-approved multiple-dose regimens. These data confirm that single-dose, broad spectrum beta-lactam agents such as cefotaxime provide safe, effective and economical prophylaxis for a wide variety of surgical procedures.
TI  - A-61827 (A-60969), a new fluoronaphthyridine with activity against both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - A-61827 (A-60969 is the hydrochloric salt of A-61827) is a new aryl-fluoronaphthyridine which is active against aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. The MICs of A-61827 for 90% of strains (MIC90) of staphylococci and streptococci were less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml and were generally 1 to 4 twofold dilutions less than those of ciprofloxacin for these bacteria. The MIC90S of A-61827 for members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were also less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml. Ciprofloxacin was 1 to 3 twofold dilutions more active than A-61827 against these gram-negative bacteria. Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Campylobacter jejuni, and Haemophilus influenzae were susceptible to less than 0.06 microgram of A-61827 per ml. The MIC90 of A-61827 for Legionella pneumophila was 0.25 microgram/ml. A-61827 was as potent or 1 to 2 twofold dilutions more potent than ciprofloxacin against these organisms. The MIC90 of A-61827 for all anaerobic bacteria was less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml compared with less than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml for ciprofloxacin. In mouse protection tests, A-61827 was as active as ciprofloxacin against Escherichia coli, P. aeruginosa, and Salmonella typhimurium and 5 to 10 times more active than ciprofloxacin against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. A-61827 was as active as ciprofloxacin against P. aeruginosa in a mouse pyelonephritis model and more active than ciprofloxacin and metronidazole in a mouse Bacteroides fragilis abscess model. After oral administration of 100 mg/kg to mice, the peak concentrations of A-61827 and ciprofloxacin in serum were 2.3 and 2.4 micrograms/ml and the half-lives in serum were 3.9 and 1.2 h, respectively.
TI  - Comparative in-vitro activity of erythromycin, vancomycin and pristinamycin.
AB  - We have studied the in-vitro activity of erythromycin, vancomycin and pristinamycin against 1,006 clinical isolates comprising streptococci, staphylococci, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Haemophilus influenzae and anaerobes. In-vitro studies show pristinamycin to inhibit staphylococci and streptococci, including erythromycin highly-resistant organisms, at a concentration of less than or equal to 0.78 mg/l. Although pristinamycin's mean MIC for streptococci is higher than that of erythromycin, pristinamycin is bactericidal, whereas erythromycin is bacteristatic against Streptococcus agalactiae and oral streptococci. Enterococci were less uniformly susceptible to pristinamycin: 58 of the 94 Enterococcus faecalis tested were resistant (MIC greater than or equal to 3.12 mg/l). 14 of the 15 isolates of Enterococcus faecium were inhibited by less than or equal to 1.56 mg/l pristinamycin. Pristinamycin showed poor activity against Haemophilus influenzae (mode MIC 1.56 and MIC90 of 3.12 mg/l) but all except two of the 100 Neisseria gonorrhoeae tested were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.78 mg/l pristinamycin. Pristinamycin inhibited all nine Clostridium spp. at less than or equal to 0.39 mg/l and 38 of 40 strains of anaerobic gram-positive cocci at less than or equal to 0.78 mg/l. It was less effective against the Bacteroides fragilis group: (MIC90 3.12 mg/l). Pristinamycin had poor bactericidal activity against the anaerobes tested.
TI  - In vitro studies of fleroxacin (Ro 23-6240), a new trifluorinated quinolone derivative.
AB  - The in vitro activity of fleroxacin (Ro 23-6240) against 441 bacterial isolates was compared with those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, amoxycillin, cefadroxil, cefuroxime and tobramycin. An agar dilution method was used for the determination of minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs). Ciprofloxacin showed the highest activity against the Enterobacteriaceae, 95% of the isolates were inhibited by 0.06 mg/l, but fleroxacin and ofloxacin were also highly active (MIC 90% = 0.5 and 0.25 mg/l, respectively). Ciprofloxacin was the most active agent against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC 90% = 0.12 mg/l), whereas the activities of fleroxacin and ofloxacin were more variable. Tobramycin was highly active against P. aeruginosa, 75% of the isolates were inhibited by 0.5 mg/l or less. The quinolones and tobramycin exhibited high activity against Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, the great majority of the isolates being susceptible to 0.5 mg/l or less of any agent. All the quinolones showed high activity against Staphylococcus aureus, but fleroxacin was less active against Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus saprophyticus than were the other derivatives. The pneumococcal and streptococcal isolates were markedly less susceptible to fleroxacin than to the other quinolones tested (MIC range 4-32 mg/l). All isolates of Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae were inhibited by the lowest concentration of the quinolones employed in the study (0.03 mg/l). Cefuroxime was also highly active against N. gonorrhoeae, whether the strains were beta-lactamase-producing or not, but was somewhat less active against H. influenzae. The quinolones displayed moderate and similar activity against Bacteroides fragilis isolates (MIC range 1-16 mg/l). The MICs of fleroxacin against gram-negative rods were generally 4-16 times higher at pH 8.8 than those obtained at pH 5.8 and 7.3. The activity against gram-positive cocci was not markedly influenced by changes in pH.
TI  - The role of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria in respiratory tract infections.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Bacteroides sp. (Bacteroides melaninogenicus, Bacteroides oralis, and Bacteroides fragilis), peptostreptococci and fusobacterium sp. are important pathogens in respiratory tract infections (RTI). These organisms are often recovered mixed with other aerobic, facultative and anaerobic bacteria. A recent increase in numbers of bet-lactamase producing strains of anaerobic gram-negative bacteria in RTI has been associated with increased failure rates of penicillins in eradication of these infections. These infections include chronic otitis media, chronic sinusitis and mastoiditis, chronic recurrent tonsillitis and lung abscesses. The indirect pathogenicity of these organisms is apparent through their ability not only to survive penicillin therapy but also to protect penicillin susceptible pathogens from that drug. These direct and indirect virulence characteristics of anaerobic bacteria require the administration of appropriate antimicrobial therapy directed against all pathogens in mixed infections.
TI  - Beta-lactamase inhibition by acetylmethylene penicillanic acid compared to that of clavulanate and sulbactam.
AB  - The beta-lactamase inhibitory properties of 6-acetylmethylene penicillanic acid (6-AMPA) were investigated and compared with those of other beta-lactamase inhibitors. 6-AMPA inhibited the TEM-1, TEM-2, SHV-1, PSE-1, PSE-2, PSE-3, PSE-4, OXA-2, OXA-3, and Staphylococcus aureus beta-lactamases. It also inhibited the chromosomally-mediated beta-lactamases of the Richmond-Sykes type Ia, Ic and Id type and the type IV Klebsiella enzymes. Beta-lactamases of Branhamella catarrhalis and Bacteroides fragilis were inhibited. The 6-AMPA I50 values for various enzymes were less than 0.01 microgram/ml TEM-1 and PSE-4, and 0.01 microgram/ml SHV-1, 0.02 microgram/ml S. aureus, 0.04 microgram/ml Proteus vulgaris, 0.04 microgram/ml K. oxytoca, 6.8 micrograms/ml P99, and 9.7 micrograms/ml Sabath-Abraham Pseudomonas enzyme. With isolated beta-lactamases 6-AMPA was a more potent inhibitor than clavulanate or sulbactam. 6-AMPA was an irreversible inhibitor of beta-lactamases. The penetration index for Escherichia coli JT4 was 23 compared to 3 for clavulanate. 6-AMPA at 10 micrograms/ml acted synergistically with ampicillin against beta-lactamase containing bacteria, but it was less active than clavulanate and did not act synergistically with ampicillin against Enterobacter, Citrobacter or Pseudomonas. Although 6-AMPA has excellent beta-lactamase inhibitory properties with isolated enzymes, it is less useful with intact organisms.
TI  - Treatment of chronic postsurgical osteomyelitis with ciprofloxacin.
AB  - Sixteen patients (11F, 5M, age 18-83, mean 59.8 years) with chronic postsurgical  osteomyelitis were treated with ciprofloxacin. The dosage was 500 or 750 mg twice daily orally during one to six months; four patients started with 300 mg twice daily intravenously and changed after 3-7 days to oral therapy. Twelve patients had implanted prostheses. The organisms involved were Enterobacteriaceae (11), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7), Staphylococcus aureus (5), Streptococcus faecalis (4) and Bacteroides fragilis (1). Nine patients had pure cultures, seven mixed cultures. Cure (disappearance of infection symptoms, return of normal function with negative cultures, without resurgery) was obtained in 11 patients, improvement (resurgery required to obtain complete cure) in two. Three patients with infections by Staphylococcus aureus (2) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1) failed to respond after one and four months treatment respectively. No side effects were observed.
TI  - Changes in expression of bacterial surface antigens induced by antibiotics and their influence on host defenses.
AB  - Concomitant with the discovery that a number of antibiotics were able to induce profound morphological changes (increased septation, thickened walls, filamentation) at low concentrations their ability to inhibit bacterial protein/polysaccharide synthesis was determined. In particular toxin and extracellular enzyme biosynthesis could be repressed by the lincosamines, fusidic acid, erythromycin and streptomycin in Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Propionibacterium acnes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli. Several of these exoproducts act as antigens associated with microbial virulence and are therefore of importance in pathogenicity. Likewise structural components such as fimbriae in Escherichia coli, M protein in Streptococcus pyogenes, protein A in Staphylococcus aureus and capsule in Bacteroides fragilis and Haemophilus influenzae were not synthesised when the producer bacteria were grown in low concentrations of antibiotic. These products, through their importance as impedins of opsonization and subsequent phagocytosis by white blood cells, are important determinants in the host-parasite relationship. By their loss during drug exposure, potentiation of opsonophagocytosis occurred leading to more rapid killing of the pathogen. The immunogenicity of the antibiotic-damaged bacteria was also changed under these circumstances.
TI  - Effect of prophylactic antibiotics upon mixed infections with Bacteroides fragilis.
AB  - Antimicrobial agents were used alone or in combinations to explore the effect of  prophylactic antimicrobial therapy. Subcutaneous abscesses in mice were induced by single and mixed infections of Bacteroides fragilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Group A streptococci and Escherichia coli. The infected mice were treated with three doses of gentamicin, cefoxitin, metronidazole or clindamycin alone or else metronidazole or clindamycin in combination with gentamicin. Mice were sacrificed five days after inoculation and the bacterial contents of the abscesses were determined. Infection induced by a single bacteria always responded to appropriate antimicrobial therapy. However, in infections caused by two organisms, therapy directed at either the Bacteroides fragilis (with metronidazole or clindamycin) or Escherichia coli (with gentamicin) was effective in not only significantly reducing the colony forming units (CFU) of the target organism but also reducing the number of untreated bacteria. Clindamycin alone was effective in reducing the CFU of both components of mixed infections of Bacteroides fragilis with either Staphylococcus aureus or Group A streptococci. Cefoxitin alone and the combination of either clindamycin or metronidazole with gentamicin were effective against all mixed infections. These data support the need to provide coverage for all components of mixed infections with single or combination therapy.
TI  - Spectrum and mode of action of azithromycin (CP-62,993), a new 15-membered-ring macrolide with improved potency against gram-negative organisms.
AB  - The macrolide antibiotic azithromycin (CP-62,993; 9-deoxo-9a-methyl-9a-aza-9a-homoerythromycin A; also designated XZ-450 [Pliva Pharmaceuticals, Zagreb, Yugoslavia]) showed a significant improvement in potency against gram-negative organisms compared with erythromycin while retaining the classic erythromycin spectrum. It was up to four times more potent than erythromycin against Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae and twofold more potent against Branhamella catarrhalis, Campylobacter species, and Legionella species. It had activity similar to that of erythromycin against Chlamydia spp. Azithromycin was significantly more potent versus many genera of the family Enterobacteriaceae; its MIC for 90% of strains of Escherichia, Salmonella, Shigella, and Yersinia was less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml, compared with 16 to 128 micrograms/ml for erythromycin. Azithromycin inhibited the majority of gram-positive organisms at less than or equal to 1 micrograms/ml. It displayed cross-resistance to erythromycin-resistant Staphylococcus and Streptococcus isolates. It had moderate activity against Bacteroides fragilis and was comparable to erythromycin against other anaerobic species. Azithromycin also demonstrated improved bactericidal activity in comparison with erythromycin. The mechanism of action of azithromycin was similar to that of erythromycin since azithromycin competed effectively for [14C]erythromycin ribosomebinding sites.
TI  - Microbiological studies of tracheostomy site wounds.
AB  - Specimens were obtained from 25 patients who developed tracheostomy site wound infections. Aerobic bacteria only were isolated in 4 (16%) instances, anaerobic bacteria only in 2 (8%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic isolates were recovered in 19 (76%). A total of 145 isolates (72 aerobes and 73 anaerobes) were recovered, an average of 5.8 isolates per specimen (2.9 aerobes and 2.9 anaerobes). The most frequently recovered isolates were Peptostreptococcus sp., Bacteroides sp., alpha-hemolytic streptococci, Fusobacterium sp., and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Twenty-nine isolates recovered from 19 (72%) patients produced beta-lactamase. These included all isolates of Staphylococcus aureus and Bacteroides fragilis group and 4 of 11 (36%) of Bacteroides melaninogenicus group. The polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic flora of tracheostomy site wound infection, and the presence of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria in most of these infections, may have important implications for their management.
TI  - Metronidazole and spiramycin in abscesses caused by Bacteroides spp. and Staphylococcus aureus in mice.
AB  - The activity of metronidazole and spiramycin, singly or in combination, was tested in vitro and also in vivo, in the eradication of infection caused by Bacteroides spp. and Staphylococcus aureus, alone or in combination. The MICs of metronidazole for the B. melaninogenicus and B. fragilis strains were significantly reduced by the addition of spiramycin (from 0.25 and 0.5 mg/l, to 0.062 and 0.125 mg/l, respectively). Antimicrobial synergy between metronidazole and spiramycin was noted against Bacteroides spp. in abscesses caused in mice by subcutaneous injection of Bacteroides spp. alone or in combination with S. aureus. Furthermore, an additional reduction in the number of S. aureus was noted in mixed infections with bacteroides that were treated with metronidazole alone. The antimicrobial synergy in vitro and in vivo between metronidazole and spiramycin may have clinical implications that deserve to be further investigated.
TI  - Comparative in-vitro activity of A-56268 (TE-031), a new macrolide antibiotic.
AB  - The comparative in-vitro activity of A-56268 (TE-031), a new semisynthetic macrolide antibiotic, was assessed against approximately 400 bacterial isolates. The new drug demonstrated excellent activity against penicillin-susceptible streptococci (MIC90s less than or equal to 0.06 mg/l) and methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (MIC90 = 0.25 mg/l). Among other Gram-positive organisms tested, a significant number were resistant to A-56268 as well as to erythromycin and clindamycin. A-56268 was at least as active as erythromycin against Pasteurella multocida and Campylobacter jejuni, but was more active than erythromycin against Legionella spp. (MIC90 less than or equal to 0.06 mg/l), Bacteroides fragilis (MIC90 = 4 mg/l) and Bact. melaninogenicus (MIC90 less than or equal to 0.125 mg/l). Activity of A-56268 was pH dependent (more active at pH 7 than at pH 6) and was moderately affected by inoculum size. The drug was bactericidal against two strains of Streptococcus pyogenes tested, but exerted a bacteriostatic effect against Staphylococcus aureus and Str. faecalis.
TI  - Synergism between Bacteroides fragilis and Staphylococcus aureus in experimental  tibial osteomyelitis.
AB  - We explored the potential role of microbial synergy in an experimental rat osteomyelitis model. Osteomyelitis was assessed by gross pathologic conditions and quantitative cultivation of rat tibiae for the implanted organisms 21 days after challenge. When Staphylococcus aureus was used alone, the 50% infective dose (ID50) and the 100% infective dose (ID100) were 400 and 25,000 colony-forming units (CFU), respectively. When Bacteroides fragilis was inoculated alone, the ID50 was 150,000 organisms, and the ID100 was not confidently determined. Subinfectious numbers of B. fragilis added to the staphylococcal inocula yielded an ID100 as low as 20 staphylococci. Mixed inocula with 20 or 200 staphylococci and increasing numbers of B. fragilis yielded a dose-dependent increase in the number of staphylococci isolated from osteomyelitic tibiae. Multiple linear regression analysis confirmed the two inocula and their interaction to be significantly predictive of the 21-day quantitative assessment of staphylococci (r = 0.80). Synergy was most striking at low bacterial inocula. When even large numbers of S. aureus were added to B. fragilis, the B. fragilis inoculum required to initiate B. fragilis osteomyelitis was essentially unchanged. We conclude that small numbers of B. fragilis allow remarkably low numbers of S. aureus (20 or 200 CFU) to establish osteomyelitis in the rat.
TI  - Ceforanide. A review of its antibacterial activity, pharmacokinetic properties and clinical efficacy.
AB  - Ceforanide is a 'second generation' cephalosporin administered intravenously or intramuscularly. It is similar to cefamandole and cefonicid in its in vitro superiority to 'first generation' cephalosporins against several species of Enterobacteriaceae as well as its activity against Haemophilus influenzae, including beta-lactamase-producing strains. Its activity against Staphylococcus aureus is less than that of cefamandole, cefuroxime and first generation cephalosporins. The in vitro activity against Neisseria gonorrhoeae is excellent. Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter and Serratia species, and Bacteroides fragilis are resistant, as are many strains of Proteus and Providencia species. The elimination half-life is relatively long, although shorter than that of cefonicid, and in most clinical trials ceforanide has been administered twice daily. It appeared to be comparable in therapeutic efficacy to procaine penicillin and cephazolin in the treatment of patients with community-acquired pneumonia, to cephazolin in the treatment of skin and soft tissue infections due to S. aureus or beta-haemolytic streptococci and to cefapirin in S. aureus endocarditis in parenteral drug abusers. Also, it was comparable in efficacy to cephalothin in the prophylaxis of infection in patients undergoing open heart surgery or vaginal hysterectomy, and to cephazolin in patients undergoing cholecystectomy. Thus, ceforanide is an alternative to first and certain other second generation cephalosporins in several important therapeutic and prophylactic situations. It has no advantage over other cephalosporins with regard to spectrum of antibacterial activity, but has a longer half-life than other second generation cephalosporins, except cefonicid, and can be administered according to a twice daily dosage schedule.
TI  - Recovery of beta-lactamase producing bacteria in pediatric infections.
AB  - The presence of beta-lactamase producing bacteria (beta LPB) was investigated in  specimens obtained from 1469 children who presented with infections of the skin and soft tissue (648), upper respiratory tract (514), pulmonary sites (137), surgical sites (113), and other (57). Of 4989 bacterial isolates recovered, 910 (18%) were beta LPB, 492 (54%) aerobes, and 418 (46%) anaerobes. The beta LPB were recovered in 751 (51%) of the children. The most frequently recovered beta LPB was Staphylococcus aureus, which was recovered in 356 (47%) patients. Most isolates were recovered from patients with skin and soft-tissue infections (68% of patients), upper respiratory tract infections (49%), and pulmonary infections (35%). Bacteroides fragilis group was isolated in 35% of patients with beta LPB, mostly from surgical infections (98% of patients), pulmonary infections (36%), skin and soft-tissue infections (25%), and upper respiratory tract infections (20%). Twenty-five percent of the Bacteroides melaninogenicus group produced beta-lactamase. These organisms were recovered in 15% of patients with beta LPB. They were recovered in upper respiratory tract infections (38% of patients), pulmonary infections (22%), and skin and soft-tissue infections (7%). Other beta LPB were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8% of total patients with beta LPB), Escherichia coli (4%), Bacteroides oralis (3%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (3%), Haemophilus influenzae (2%), Proteus (1%), and Branhamella catarrhalis (1%). The role of beta LPB in the failure of penicillin to eradicate many of the infections is discussed.
TI  - The role of Bacteroides encapsulation in the lethal synergy between Escherichia coli and Bacteroides species studied in a rat fibrin clot peritonitis model.
AB  - Encapsulation in Bacteroides species has been thoroughly studied in vivo as a virulence factor in abscess formation. Its pathogenic role in lethal infections caused by a mixture of pathogens has been less well investigated. Our previous studies using the rat fibrin clot peritonitis model have demonstrated lethal synergy between Bacteroides fragilis and Escherichia coli. In order to determine the synergistic role of the encapsulation of the Bacteroides component in this model, inoculations of E. coli plus one of seven Bacteroides strains of differing degrees of encapsulation were assessed for their effect on mortality. Both unencapsulated Bacteroides strains tested (B. distasonis 1244, B. vulgatus 4300) produced an early lethal synergistic effect with E. coli while the heavily encapsulated strain, B. thetaiotaomicron 1603 did not do so. The four other Bacteroides strains tested were encapsulated and their synergy with E. coli was demonstrated. Control Gram-positive strains, Streptococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus, did not alter mortality when mixed with E. coli in this model. These studies support the concept that virulence factors other than encapsulation are important in the outcome of polymicrobial infections in which Bacteroides species play a part.
TI  - Effect of Bacteroides fragilis cellular components on chemotactic activity of polymorphonuclear leukocytes towards Escherichia coli.
AB  - Chemotaxis of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNL) in response to cell components  of Bacteroides fragilis alone or in combination with Escherichia coli was evaluated. E. coli produced much more powerful chemotactic factors than B. fragilis. The culture filtrate (CF), outer membrane (OM) preparation, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of B. fragilis slightly stimulated chemotactic activity of PMNL. The culture filtrate and OM preparation were capable of inhibiting the chemotaxis of PMNL in response to the chemotactic factors of E. coli but LPS of B. fragilis was not able to do so. Reduction by B. fragilis of PMNL chemotaxis in response to E. coli was not specific for B. fragilis but also occurred in the presence of facultative bacteria. In parallel with chemotaxis, lysozyme release, but not beta-glucuronidase release, by PMNL was significantly stimulated by E. coli but not by B. fragilis.
TI  - Inhibitory and cidal antimicrobial actions of electrically generated silver ions.
AB  - One promising alternative to antibiotics in the treatment of localized infections is the generation of antimicrobial silver ions by the use of low intensity direct current from a pure silver anode implanted at the site of an infection. This study investigates the in vitro bacteriostatic and bactericidal properties of this system on a variety of organisms.
TI  - HRE 664, a new parenteral penem. II. Evaluation of the pharmacokinetic behavior and the chemotherapeutic activity in animals.
AB  - The pharmacokinetic and chemotherapeutic properties of the new penem antibiotic HRE 664 (Fig. 1) were evaluated in experimental animals. High and sustained blood and serum levels were achieved following parenteral injection in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys. Half-lives ranged from 27 to 40 minutes in the various species tested. The antibiotic was well distributed in the rodents and penetrated well into tissues and body fluids. At 30 minutes after subcutaneous administration to mice (50 mg/kg), concentrations of between 12.4 and 35.9 micrograms/g were measured in the lungs, liver, heart and kidneys, that is 33 approximately 95% of the corresponding level in murine blood (37.7 micrograms/ml). In experimentally induced infections in mice, HRE 664 displayed good chemotherapeutic activity particularly against septicemias caused by methicillin-sensitive and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains and on abscess formation induced by Bacteroides fragilis. Most of the cephalosporins and other beta-lactam antibiotics exhibited low efficacy against these strains of bacteria.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies of cefuzonam in the field  of obstetrics and gynecology].
AB  - To study the transfer of cefuzonam (CZON, L-105) into female genital organs, concentrations of the compound in pelvic dead space exudate were measured in cases of radical hysterectomy due to cervical cancer and analyzed by the two-compartment model. When CZON 1 g was drip-infused intravenously, the concentration in the cubital vein blood was 46.95 micrograms/ml at 1 hour after the start of infusion. Concentrations in the pelvic dead space exudate reached the peak of 11.29 micrograms/ml at 2.44 hours after the start, were higher than 4 micrograms/ml after 8 hours and were higher than 1.7 micrograms/ml after 12 hours. The area under the concentration-time curve in the pelvic dead space exudate was 77.85 micrograms X hr/ml. From these results CZON was considered to be effective when administered at 1 g against infections of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, and haemophilus influenzae, but increased dose levels seemed necessary against infections of Staphylococcus epidermidis and Bacteroides fragilis. In 3 cases of obstetric and gynecological infections the efficacy of CZON was good in 2 cases and unknown in the other case.
TI  - Effect of ciprofloxacin on fecal flora of patients with cystic fibrosis and other patients treated with oral ciprofloxacin.
AB  - Ciprofloxacin is a fluorinated carboxyquinolone that inhibits Enterobacteriaceae, staphylococci, and Pseudomonas at low concentrations. It has poor activity against Bacteroides fragilis. In this study, the effect of administration of ciprofloxacin on bowel flora was determined in patients treated for different infections. Patients, aged 22 to 70 years, were treated with 500 mg of ciprofloxacin every 12 hours or 750 mg every eight hours for seven to 42 days. Some patients had advanced cystic fibrosis; other patients had infections with resistant bacteria. Infecting organisms were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Serratia, and Acinetobacter. Sites of infections were lung, soft tissue, and urinary tract. Stool samples were evaluated initially, during therapy, and after therapy. No resistant gram-negative aerobic species emerged; five patients had yeast colonization, staphylococci were found in three patients, and streptococci were found in one patient. Ciprofloxacin did not select resistant gram-negative bacteria in the stool, although sputum isolates showed increases in minimal inhibitory concentrations. Resistant bacteria were not selected in the fecal flora of patients who had received beta-lactam and aminoglycoside antibiotics before therapy with ciprofloxacin.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of a new penem, CGP 31608.
AB  - The in vitro activity of CGP 31608, a new penem, against aerobic and anaerobic organisms was evaluated and compared with those of other beta-lactams. CGP 31608 inhibited Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter diversus, and Salmonella, Shigella, Aeromonas, and Yersinia spp. with MICs for 50% of the strains (MIC50s) of 2 to 4 micrograms/ml and MIC90s of 4 micrograms/ml, compared with cefotaxime, ceftazidime, aztreonam, and imipenem MICs of less than 0.25 microgram/ml. MIC90s were 8 micrograms/ml for Enterobacter species and C. freundii, for which other agents had MICs of 32 micrograms/ml, except imipenem, which had equal activity. The MIC90 for Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia stuartii, and Providencia rettgeri was 8 micrograms/ml, compared with less than 2 micrograms/ml shown by the other agents. Acinetobacter species resistant to other agents except imipenem were inhibited by 4 micrograms/ml, as were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, including piperacillin-, ceftazidime-, and gentamicin-resistant isolates. The MIC for P. cepacia, P. fluorescens, and P. acidovorans was less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml, but that for P. maltophilia was greater than or equal to 128 micrograms/ml. Hemolytic streptococci A, B, C, G, and F were inhibited by less than 1 micrograms/ml, but the MIC for Streptococcus faecalis was greater than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml. MICs for Staphylococcus aureus methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains were less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, as were those for methicillin-susceptible and -resistant S. epidermidis. Bacteroides fragilis and Clostridium species and Fusobacterium spp. were inhibited by less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml. CGP 31608 was not hydrolyzed by plasmid beta-lactamases TEM-1, TEM-2, SHV-1, PSE-1, OXA-2, PSE-4, or by S. aureus. Chromosomal beta-lactamases of type Ia in Enterobacter cloacae P99 and Morganella morganii, Ic in P. vulgaris, K-1 in K. oxytoca, and Id in P. aeruginosa also did not hydrolyze CGP 31608. It inhibited TEM-1, but the 50% inhibitory concentration was 14.2 micrograms/ml compared with 0.15 micrograms/ml for the P99 enzyme. CGP 31608 induced beta-lactamases in P. aeruginosa, E. cloacae, C. freundii and Providencia rettgeri, but there was no increase in MICs for the isolates and it did not select strains derepressed for beta-lactamase production. Synergy of CGP 31608 and gentamicin was found against 90% P. aeruginosa, 60% Enterobacter cloacae, and 50% Serratia marcescens strains. No synergy was found with rifampin. A postantibiotic effect was found against E. coli.
TI  - In vitro activity of the new 4-quinolone compound Ro 23-6240.
AB  - The in vitro activity of the new 4-quinolone Ro 23-6240 was compared with that of pefloxacin, ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, nalidixic acid and gentamicin against a total of 397 recent clinical isolates. An agar dilution procedure was used to determine MICs and two inocula (10(4) and 10(6) CFU) were used throughout. Ro 23-6240 inhibited most species of the Enterobacteriaceae, Haemophilus influenzae and Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant strains) at less than or equal to 1 mg/l. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was somewhat more resistant (MIC 90 4 mg/l) and the Bacteroides fragilis group were considerably more resistant (MIC 90 32 mg/l). Overall Ro 23-6240 was as active as pefloxacin but was two- to eight-fold less active than ciprofloxacin against most species tested.
TI  - Bowel flora changes in humans receiving cefixime (CL 284,635) or cefaclor.
AB  - Twelve healthy young male subjects received either cefixime, a new oral cephalosporin (CL 284,635), or cefaclor (six subjects on each drug) orally for 2 weeks. In the case of cefixime, single daily doses of 400 mg were taken; with cefaclor, the dosage was 250 mg three times daily. Modest changes in the fecal flora were noted in both drug groups, but the changes were of different types. In the case of cefixime, there was more of an impact on the indigenous flora, and in the case of cefaclor, there was more ingrowth of new flora. With cefixime, Enterobacteriaceae were usually decreased (the decrease in Escherichia coli count was statistically significant), as were counts of clostridia and sometimes Bifidobacterium spp.; the Bacteroides fragilis group was eliminated in one subject. Coincident with these decreases, four subjects had increases in counts of group D streptococci of 3 logs or more. There was new appearance of Clostridium difficile in four subjects and of Staphylococcus aureus in one; four new strains of Enterobacteriaceae appeared. With cefaclor, there was no decrease of E. coli counts; two subjects had elimination of Bifidobacterium spp. There was little change in counts of group D streptococci. On the other hand, there were 13 new strains of Enterobacteriaceae, two of S. aureus, and three of C. difficile.
TI  - Experimental aerobic-anaerobic thoracic empyema in the guinea pig.
AB  - The clinical and pathological features of experimental aerobic-anaerobic thoracic empyema in the Duncan-Harley guinea pig are described. Thoracic empyema development and early death (less than 14 days after bacterial inoculation) were noted after various concentrations and species were inoculated into the pleural space with a piece of umbilical tape, which was used as a cofactor. The effect of concomitant hemothorax was also tested. Gram-negative infection was found to have a more virulent course than Gram-positive infection in the thoracic cavity. Moreover, these findings support the thesis that intrathoracic inoculation of anaerobic bacteria, even in combination with other anaerobic species, fails to produce clinical empyemas. However, anaerobic bacteria appear to enhance synergistically the virulence of sublethal and subempyema-forming concentrations of aerobic bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli.
TI  - In-vitro bacterial killing kinetics of ticarcillin/clavulanic acid.
AB  - An in-vitro model was developed to study the rates of killing by ticarcillin/clavulanic acid combinations of various beta-lactamase producing, ticarcillin resistant, logarithmic phase clinical isolates. Killing, defined as a 3 log reduction, was dependent on the organism, the concentration of clavulanic acid and the duration of exposure. For most isolates studied an optimum period of exposure to and concentration of clavulanic acid could be defined. Certain test strains showed optimum response to readily attainable in-vivo concentrations of clavulanic acid while other strains, although sensitive by MIC data showed a poor response. The clinical implications of this are discussed.
TI  - [Functions of intrinsic defense against anaerobic bacteria in healthy probands and patients with chronic-septic granulomatosis].
AB  - Different strains of Bacteroides fragilis exhibit great differences in sensitivity towards serum from healthy volunteers. In the presence of 10% autologous serum, neutrophilic granulocytes and monocytes (macrophages) caused significant killing of B. fragilis. The measured phagocytic and killing activity of the cells is comparable to their activity against aerobic bacteria (S. aureus). In four patients with chronic granulomatous disease of childhood, phagocytosis was normal but killing of B. fragilis and S. aureus in granulocytes or monocytes (macrophages) was appreciably lowered. This malfunction of the cells was accompanied by a disturbance in oxidative metabolism and inadequate iodination after phagocytosis of B. fragilis. The results suggest that granulocytes and monocytes play an important role in host defense against endogenous infections with anaerobes.
TI  - Microbiology of the female genital tract.
AB  - Patients who contract genital tract infections are predominantly young, are otherwise healthy, and generally respond well to treatment for bacterial infections. These infections are most commonly polymicrobial in etiology, with several noteworthy exceptions. Often there is an inciting event such as childbirth, surgical intervention, pregnancy termination or intrauterine contraceptive device insertion. With treatment, prognosis for cure is excellent; however, sequelae such as recurrent infections, infertility, or ectopic pregnancy can be serious. Bacteria encountered in the female genital tract can be divided into aerobic and anaerobic organisms. Among the aerobic gram-positive organisms, several varieties of streptococci such as Group B streptococci and enterococci occur frequently. Staphylococcus aureus is an infrequent but important pathogen. Among the aerobic gram-negative organisms, the most common is Escherichia coli. Klebsiella sp. and Proteus sp. occur in about 5% of genital tract infections. Species that are more resistant to antibiotics, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter sp., occur in approximately 1% or 2% of these cases and are more likely to appear in patients who have previously received antibiotic therapy or who have been hospitalized for some time. Among the anaerobic organisms, the most common gram-positive isolates are Peptostreptococci and Peptococci. Clostridia sp. occurs less frequently. Among the anaerobic gram-negative organisms, the Bacteroides sp. most frequently encountered are Bacteroides bivius and Bacteroides disiens. Bacteroides fragilis is still a common problem but appears to be less predominant. Other organisms encountered are Chlamydia trachomatis, the genital mycoplasmas, yeasts, protozoa, and viruses.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of A-56268 (TE-031), a new macrolide antibiotic.
AB  - The in vitro activity of A-56268 (TE-031) was determined by either standard agar  dilution or macrobroth tube dilution and compared with erythromycin and other antimicrobial agents against 329 clinical aerobic and anaerobic bacterial isolates. A-56268 showed good to excellent in vitro activity against methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, Neisseria meningitidis, and most anaerobes tested with the exception of Bacteroides fragilis isolates. A-56268 had relatively poor activity against coagulase-negative staphylococci and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Except for Haemophilus spp., the activity of A-56268 was similar to or more potent than erythromycin against all other isolates tested. A-56268 did not have significant bactericidal activity against any of the isolates examined.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of amniotic fluid in the early third trimester. Its association with preterm labor and delivery.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the bacterial growth inhibitory property of amniotic fluid (AF) from patients in the early third trimester and to examine its relationship to preterm labor and delivery. A total of 38 AF samples from patients between 27 and 35 weeks gestation with intact membranes were studied. Antibacterial activity was tested against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacteroides fragilis. Fifteen fluids were from patients in preterm labor who delivered near term after successful inhibition of labor. Five of these fluids (33%) were inhibitory to E. coli, five (33%) to S. aureus, and 11 (73%) to B. fragilis. Nine fluids were from patients who failed inhibition of labor and delivered preterm; none of these were inhibitory to E. coli, two (22%) to S. aureus, and only one (11%) to B. fragilis (P less than 0.005). Two of the nine fluids from patients who failed inhibition of labor also yielded fusobacteria. The remaining 14 fluids were obtained from patients without preterm labor and exhibited antibacterial activity similar to that from patients with successful labor inhibition. Results suggest a relationship between the absence of AF antibacterial activity against B. fragilis and preterm delivery in patients with preterm labor and intact membranes.
TI  - In vitro study of the antibacterial activity of ofloxacin against recent clinical isolates.
AB  - The in vitro activity of ofloxacin, a new broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent, was studied by a standardized single disc method. A total of 990 clinical isolates were tested, including 20 strains of anaerobic bacteria. Ofloxacin was highly active against 683 strains (70.41%), had intermediate activity against 109 (11.23%) and had no activity against 178 (18.35%). Ofloxacin was highly active against E. coli, Klebsiella sp., Citrobacter sp., Proteus mirabilis, Proteus morganii, Salmonella sp., Campylobacter jejuni, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Eubacterium sp., Propionibacterium acnes and Streptococcus sp. Pseudomonas sp., Serratia sp. and Proteus vulgaris had percentages of resistance to ofloxacin of 37.11%, 32% and 33.33% respectively. High percentages of resistance to ofloxacin were found only for Providencia sp., Proteus rettgeri and Bacteroides fragilis. With regard to Streptococcus faecalis, the results obtained with the disc procedure were not reliable and MIC determination was necessary to assess the behaviour of the drug.
TI  - Vaginal lactobacilli inhibiting growth of Gardnerella vaginalis, Mobiluncus and other bacterial species cultured from vaginal content of women with bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - On a solid agar medium the growth-inhibitory effect of 9 Lactobacillus strains cultured from vaginal content was tested on bacteria cultured from vaginal content of women with bacterial vaginosis: Mobiluncus, Gardnerella vaginalis, Bacteroides and anaerobic cocci. Inhibition zones were observed in the growth of all of the strains isolated from women with bacterial vaginosis around all lactobacilli. The inhibitory effect of the lactobacilli was further tested on various anaerobic and facultatively anaerobic species, both type strains and fresh extragenitally cultured strains. Four Bacteroides fragilis strains as well as 2 out of 4 Staphylococcus aureus strains were clearly inhibited by the lactobacilli. The inhibition zones were generally wider at pH 5.5 than at 6.0. For all inhibited strains, (the S. aureus excepted) a low pH on the agar around the lactobacilli correlated to wider growth-inhibition zones.
TI  - Beta-lactamase stability of imipenem.
AB  - The beta-lactamase stability and interactions of imipenem were analysed in comparison with those of cefazolin, cefuroxime, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, mezlocillin, piperacillin and penicillin G for a set of representative beta-lactamases. These enzymes included penicillinases such as those obtained from Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and other Enterobacteriaceae (TEM-1 and similar enzymes) (group A); cephalosporinases produced by Esch. coli (Amp C type), Serratia liquefaciens, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (group B); and beta-lactamases produced by Klebsiella spp., Proteus vulgaris and Bacteroides fragilis and with a high hydrolytic activity for the newer cephalosporins (group C). Enzymes of group A were demonstrated to be highly active against penicillins and also against the early cephalosporins; enzymes of group B showed hydrolytic activity for all other tested compounds, including the newer cephalosporins and cephamycins, but not imipenem, whereas enzymes of group C were highly active against the new cephalosporins but not against cephamycins and imipenem. In conclusion, imipenem shows a moderate affinity for all these enzymes but no detectable hydrolysis.
TI  - The relevance of microbiology in the management of anorectal sepsis.
AB  - Eighty patients with anorectal sepsis were studied over three years. All abscesses were drained and pus was submitted for culture. If a fistula was found when the abscess was drained it was laid open otherwise a second examination under anaesthetic was performed within 7-10 days. In no case was sterile pus obtained. Gut aerobes, predominantly Escherichia coli, were isolated from 49 of 53 (92.5%) of patients with a fistula and 8 of 27 (29.6%) of those without. 'Gut-specific bacteroides' predominantly Bacteroides fragilis were isolated from 47 of 53 (88.7%) patients with a fistula and 5 of 27 (18.5%) of those without. Anaerobes not specific to the gut, predominantly B. asaccharolyticus, B. ureolyticus, peptococci and peptostreptococci, in the absence of those specific to the gut, were isolated from 2 of 53 patients with a fistula (3.8%) and 17 of 27 (63%) of those without. Staphylococcus aureus was isolated from only 1 of 53 (1.9%) patients with a fistula but from 8 of 27 (29.6%) of those without. It is concluded that only patients with gut-specific organisms should be submitted to a second examination under anaesthetic and that culture of pus in anorectal sepsis is an essential part of its management.
TI  - Anaerobic osteomyelitis in children.
AB  - Twenty-six pediatric patients with osteomyelitis caused by anaerobic bacteria are presented. The etiologic factors were chronic mastoiditis (7 patients), decubitus ulcers (5), chronic sinusitis (4), periodontal abscesses (3), bites (3), paronychia (2), trauma (1) and scalp infection after fetal monitoring (1). Seventy-four organisms (2.8 isolates/specimen), including 63 anaerobes (2.4/specimen), and 11 facultative and aerobic bacteria (0.4/specimen) were recovered. The predominant organisms were anaerobic cocci (29 isolates), Bacteroides sp. (21), Fusobacterium sp. (8), Streptococcus sp. (5) and Clostridium sp. (4). The organisms generally reflected the microbial flora of the mucous surface adjacent to the infected site. Ten beta-lactamase-producing organisms were recovered from 7 (27%) patients. These included all isolates of the Bacteroides fragilis (4) and of Staphylococcus aureus (3), 2 of the 12 Bacteroides melaninogenicus group and 1 of 3 Bacteroides oralis. The clinical, diagnostic and therapeutic aspects of anaerobic osteomyelitis in children are discussed.
TI  - Cefonicid. A review of its antibacterial activity, pharmacological properties and therapeutic use.
AB  - Cefonicid is a 'second generation' cephalosporin administered intravenously or intramuscularly. It is similar to cefamandole in its superiority to first generation cephalosporins against several enterobacteriaceae as well as its activity against Haemophilus influenzae, including beta-lactamase-producing strains. Its activity against Staphylococcus aureus is similar to that of cefoxitin and inferior to cefamandole and first generation cephalosporins. It has excellent in vitro activity against Neisseria gonorrhoeae, but is inactive against Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, Serratia, and Bacteroides fragilis. Due to high achievable plasma concentrations and a relatively long half-life, in most clinical trials cefonicid has been administered once daily. It was comparable in efficacy with cefamandole or cefazolin in the treatment of patients with urinary tract, lower respiratory tract, and soft tissue and bone infections. It has also been compared with penicillin in the treatment of uncomplicated gonorrhoea. Results from a small series of patients with endocarditis appear to indicate that cefonicid should not be used in patients with serious staphylococcal infections. Single doses of cefonicid given preoperatively appear to offer a similar degree of protection against post-surgical infection as multiple doses of other antibiotics, but further data from studies involving larger numbers of patients are needed to confirm these impressions. Patients who require prolonged antibiotic therapy, such as those with osteomyelitis being treated as outpatients after a relatively short inpatient course, could benefit from the once daily dose regimen of cefonicid.
TI  - Sepsis and cholestasis: the in vitro effects of bacterial products on 14C-taurocholate uptake by isolated rat hepatocytes.
AB  - Bacterial endotoxins are known to be an important cause of cholestasis, yet not all organisms that cause cholestasis produce endotoxins. In order to determine whether bacterial products other than endotoxins may be involved in the cholestasis process, 14C-taurocholate (TC) uptake by isolated rat hepatocytes was measured in the presence of mid-log, stationary and mid-death phase bacterial broth supernatants from eight common bacterial pathogens. The results were then correlated with a quantitative assessment of endotoxin production by each organism. Supernatants from Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumonia demonstrated a striking inhibitory effect on bile salt uptake (77.2 +/- 6.7, 46.9 +/- 6.5 and 32.9 +/- 7.1% maximum inhibition of 14C-TC uptake, respectively) when compared to sterile broth controls. Streptococcus faecalis (Enterococcus), Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacteroides fragilis products, on the other hand, had relatively minor effects (12.3 +/- 5.2, 12.0 +/- 7.5, 8.4 +/- 6.7 and less than 5.0% inhibition respectively), while those from Proteus mirabilis had an intermediate effect (18.5 +/- 8.3% inhibition). Bile salt efflux rates (16.0 +/- 2.7 and 25.1 +/- 4.2 nmol/min/10(6) hepatocytes, mean +/- SEM) were similar in bacteria demonstrating marked uptake inhibition (Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) when compared to those with only minor inhibitory effects (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacteroides fragilis) (14.3 +/- 1.1 and 18.4 +/- 2.6 nmol/min/10(6) hepatocytes, respectively, p greater than 0.05). 14C-TC uptake inhibition did not correlate with the amount of endotoxin produced by each organism (r = 0.251). The results of this study indicate that bacteria produce a factor other than endotoxin that significantly inhibits bile salt uptake by isolated rat hepatocytes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - The in-vitro activity of CI-934 compared with that of other new 4-quinolones and  nalidixic acid.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of CI-934, a new 4-quinolone compound, was compared with that of the other new 4-quinolones, enoxacin and ciprofloxacin, and also with that of nalidixic acid. CI-934 was more active than any of the other 4-quinolones tested against Gram-positive aerobic organisms including Staphylococcus aureus (MICs 0.06-0.25 mg/l), beta-haemolytic streptococci (MICs 0.12-0.5 mg/l), Streptococcus pneumoniae (MICs 0.25-0.5 ml/l), viridans streptococci (MICs 0.06-0.5 mg/l) and most enterococci (MICs 0.12-0.5 mg/l), although some ampicillin-resistant isolates of Str. faecium were slightly less susceptible (MICs 2 mg/l). All three of the newer 4-quinolones tested were highly active against Enterobacteriaceae, Aeromonas sp., Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (MICs mostly less than 1 mg/l). The other Gram-negative aerobes tested were in general somewhat less susceptible, although for Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas aeruginosa MICs seldom exceeded 8 mg/l. CI-934 was more active than enoxacin against Gardnerella vaginalis (MICs 1-8 mg/l) although it was a little less active than ciprofloxacin. Bacteroides species (including about half of the fragilis group) were susceptible to CI-934 (MICs mostly 1-8 mg/l): ciprofloxacin had similar activity but enoxacin was less active. Other anaerobes tested were mostly highly susceptible to CI-934 (MICs 1 mg/l or less) but were somewhat less susceptible to enoxacin and ciprofloxacin.
TI  - In vitro activity of Ro 23-6240, a new difluoroquinolone derivative, compared with that of other antimicrobial agents.
AB  - Ro 23-6240 is a new difluorinated quinolone antimicrobial agent. Its in vitro activity against a wide range of bacteria was compared with those of other quinolones and beta-lactams. Generally, members of the family Enterobacteriaceae were inhibited by low concentrations of Ro 23-6240 (MIC90 [MIC for 90% of isolates tested], less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml). Ninety percent of Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant strains) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates were inhibited by 0.5 microgram/ml. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90, 2 micrograms/ml) and Bacteroides fragilis (MIC90, 4 micrograms/ml) showed intermediate susceptibility, and Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC90, 8 micrograms/ml) was less susceptible. Strains resistant to nalidixic acid were less susceptible to all the quinolones tested. The protein binding of Ro 23-6240 (5 micrograms/ml) was 27%.
TI  - [Bacteriologic findings and therapeutic consequences in adnexitis].
AB  - After laparoscopic confirmation of adnexitis, a bacteriological examination was made of specimens taken from the small pelvis of 63 patients, with an average age of 26.4 years, at the Rheinischen Landesfrauenklinik (Gynecological Hospital) in Wuppertal. To this end, various aerobic and anaerobic optimal and selective culture media were used. The cultured germs were identified with API systems, other conventional methods, and by using gas chromatography. All bacilli were tested for their sensitivity to mezlocillin and metronidazole. In 40 cases (63.5%), it was possible to determine 1-10 bacilli from the inner genital tract. In most cases there was an aerobic/anaerobic mixed infection, with participation of streptococci, staphylococci, enteric bacteria, as well as peptococci, peptostreptococci and bacteroid types. Neisseria gonorrhoeae was only identified three times. In 23 cases (36.5%), it was not possible to determine bacilli in spite of definite inflammatory symptoms. Since, according to international literature, Chlamydia trachomatis was to be found on the inflamed tubes of roughly one third of cases of adnexitis, the presence of this bacillus is suspected even in the many bacteriologically negative cases in the author's own study. Only in one case of a monoinfection by Staphylococcus aureus did the combination of mezlocillin and metronidazole prove to be unsuitable. In 25% of the cases where the presence of bacilli was proved, metronidazole was even necessary, since bacilli of the Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides bivius and disiens groups were involved, all of which are capable of inactivating penicillins and cephalosporins by formation of a beta-lactamase.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Presence of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria and beta-lactamase activity in abscesses.
AB  - The presence of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria (BLPB) in abscesses was investigated in 109 abscesses. Single isolates were recovered in 23 (21%) instances and were predominantly Staphylococcus aureus. The other abscesses yielded growth of two or more aerobic and/or anaerobic organisms. Aerobic bacteria were recovered in 28 (26%) of the aspirates, anaerobic bacteria in 41 (38%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in 40 (36%). A total of 362 isolates (247 anaerobes and 115 aerobes) were recovered, accounting for 3.3 isolates per specimen (2.2 anaerobes and 1.1 aerobes). One hundred beta-lactamase-producing organisms were recovered in 88 (77%) specimens. These included all 28 isolates of Bacteroides fragilis, 18 of 30 Bacteroides melaninogenicus, 42 of 43 S. aureus, and 11 of 14 Escherichia coli. Beta-lactamase activity was detected in 40 (55%) of the purulent specimens when using the chromogenic cephalosporin nitrocefin method. These data demonstrate the presence of aerobic and anaerobic BLPB in abscesses.
TI  - Staphylococcus aureus protein A--antibody-mediated haemagglutination for the analysis of cross-reactivity between phenol-water extracts of Bacteroides fragilis.
AB  - Passive haemagglutination (PHA) and Staphylococcus aureus protein A--antibody-mediated haemagglutination (SAPA-AMHA) were used to analyse the cross-reactions of rabbit antisera against four strains of Bacteroides fragilis. There was cross-reactivity between all the strains tested but strain-specific reactions were obtained with three strains. Two to 32-fold higher antibody titres were obtained with SAPA-AMHA than with PHA. The antigen concentration required in inhibition assays was up to 32-fold higher for PHA than for SAPA-AMHA. The latter is a simple and superior alternative to PHA for such studies.
TI  - In vitro activity of flurithromycin, a novel macrolide antibiotic.
AB  - Flurithromycin is an (8,S)-8-fluoroerythromycin isolated from the fermentation broth of Streptomyces erythraeus ATCC 31772, a blocked mutant of a strain producer of erythromycin. Its in vitro antibacterial activity has been determined on recent clinical isolates of respiratory pathogens. The range of MIC for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus beta-haemolyticus group A is from 0.0015 to 0.006 microgram/ml, for Haemophilus influenzae from 0.012 to 0.4 microgram/ml, for Staphylococcus aureus from 0.1 to 3.1 micrograms/ml. Its action is bacteriostatic and increases at alkaline pH. Among anaerobes Clostridium perfringens, Bacteroides fragilis, other species of Bacteroides and Peptostreptococcus are particularly susceptible. Flurithromycin also showed some activity on Mycobacterium bovis, M. scrofulaceum and M. phley. The determination of killing curves indicated that in most cases a killing effect was obtained at 4 X MIC. A combination of flurithromycin with ampicillin or doxycycline sometimes was synergic, but more often additive and never antagonistic. The possible interference of flurithromycin on some parameters of the natural system of defense was determined. At concentrations equal to therapeutic levels in blood and tissues, flurithromycin did not influence chemotaxis, phagocytosis, metabolic activation and the killing activity of neutrophils.
TI  - Activity of pefloxacin and thirteen other antimicrobial agents in vitro against isolates from hospital and genitourinary infections.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of the quinolone derivative pefloxacin was compared with that of three other quinolones, five beta-lactam antibiotics and three aminoglycosides against 367 isolates from hospital patients and from out-patients with genitourinary infections. MIC90 of pefloxacin and norfloxacin for each strain was the same; that of ciprofloxacin was a little lower. All strains except Escherichia coli were resistant to nalidixic acid. Pefloxacin was highly active against Staphylococcus aureus (39 strains; MIC90 1.0 mg/l) and most strains of coagulase-negative staphylococci (56; 4 mg/l), Esch. coli (50; 0.25 mg/l), other enterobacteria (33; 1.0 mg/l) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa 6; 0.25 mg/l). With Bacteroides spp. (total 78; 64 mg/l), the fragilis group (23) and the fusobacteria (19) were resistant, but the melaninogenicus-oralis group (31; range 0.06- greater than 64 mg/l) and B. ureolyticus (22; 0.125- greater than 64 mg/l) gave variable results. Amongst genitourinary isolates, Neisseria gonorrhoeae (15) and Haemophilus ducreyi (34) were sensitive (less than 0.06 mg/l) but Gardnerella vaginalis (25) and Mobiluncus spp. (11) were resistant (32 mg/l). Pefloxacin was more active than ceftazidime, cefotaxime, ceftizoxime, latamoxef and piperacillin against S. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci and than gentamicin, tobramycin and amikacin against coagulase-negative staphylococci. No enterobacteria or pseudomonads were resistant to pefloxacin or other quinolones, whereas some were resistant to beta-lactams and aminoglycosides.
TI  - Bactericidal effects of ticarcillin-clavulanic acid against beta-lactamase-producing bacteria in vivo.
AB  - The comparative efficacies of ticarcillin and ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid have been determined in the mouse against experimental infections caused by ticarcillin-resistant bacteria. The infections studied comprised an intraperitoneal infection, local tissue infections, pyelonephritis, and pneumonia. Both ticarcillin and clavulanic acid penetrated readily to the sites of infection studied and at the doses employed were present at concentrations of the same order as those obtained in humans after the administration of ticarcillin-clavulanic acid formulations (Timentin; Beecham). At these concentrations, the ticarcillin-clavulanic acid combination caused significant bactericidal effects at the sites of infection against the ticarcillin-resistant strains of Bacteroides fragilis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus investigated. The efficacy of ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid against the infections resistant to therapy with ticarcillin demonstrated the beta-lactamase-inhibitory activity of clavulanic acid in vivo.
TI  - Oral neomycin and erythromycin compared with single-dose systemic metronidazole and ceftriaxone prophylaxis in elective colorectal surgery.
AB  - A prospective randomized trial was performed to compare oral neomycin and erythromycin with single-dose intravenous metronidazole and ceftriaxone in elective colorectal surgery. The study was discontinued after 60 patients were entered. The overall rate of infection was 41 percent in the oral neomycin and erythromycin group (n = 29) compared with 9.6 percent in those who received intravenous metronidazole and ceftriaxone (n = 31) (p less than 0.01). Infections in the oral group were principally due to resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Bacteroides fragilis, and Escherichia coli. Preoperative administration of oral neomycin and erythromycin was associated with a significant reduction of Escherichia coli counts (1 X 10(7) to 3 X 10(5) organisms/ml, p less than 0.05) compared with the intravenous group, but there was no significant reduction in the counts of Bacteroides fragilis (2 X 10(8) to 1 X 10(7) organisms/ml) and there was an increase in the counts of Clostridia (2 X 10(4) to 1 X 10(6) organisms/ml). These results indicate that single-dose systemic prophylaxis with appropriate antibiotics is superior to oral neomycin and erythromycin.
TI  - Variation in the potentiation of beta-lactam antibiotic activity by clavulanic acid and sulbactam against multiply antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
AB  - Using a broth microdilution method, we studied 120 strains of beta-lactamase-producing clinical isolates to determine the potentiating effect of clavulanic acid and sulbactam (both beta-lactamase inhibitors) on the antibacterial activity of a variety of beta-lactam antibiotics. All antibiotics were tested alone and in combination with each inhibitor simultaneously using low (10(5) cfu/ml) and high (10(7) cfu/ml) inocula. Against the strains of Escherichia coli and Haemophilus influenzae the addition of both inhibitors significantly potentiated the activity of most antibiotics at the low inoculum. At the high inoculum, however, this effect was abrogated against E. coli and most strains of H. influenzae. Antibiotic activity was significantly enhanced by the inhibitors at both inoculum sizes with Bacteroides fragilis. Antibiotic resistance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was little affected by the inhibitors. Among methicillin-resistant staphylococci, antibiotic potentiation by the inhibitors was more significant for Staphylococcus aureus than the coagulase-negative staphylococci.
TI  - The comparative in-vitro activity of pefloxacin.
AB  - The in-vitro antibacterial activities of pefloxacin, other 4-quinolones and representative beta-lactams and aminoglycosides were assessed by determination of minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs). Pefloxacin (MICs mostly 0.03-2 mg/l) was highly active against Enterobacteriaceae. Gentamicin had slightly lower activity, and ceftazidime and norfloxacin similar activities to pefloxacin whereas ciprofloxacin was more active. Pefloxacin (MICs 0.03-2 mg/l) was active against Acinetobacter but again ciprofloxacin was more active. Aeromonas was highly susceptible to pefloxacin and norfloxacin (MICs 0.008-0.03 mg/l) as well as to ciprofloxacin (MICs 0.001-0.008 mg/l). Pefloxacin (MICs 1-8 mg/l) had similar activities to ceftazidime and gentamicin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa but tobramycin (MICs 0.25-32 mg/l), norfloxacin (MICs 0.25-4 mg/l) and ciprofloxacin (MICs 0.06-1 mg/l) were generally more active. Haemophilus influenzae was susceptible to pefloxacin (MICs 0.008-0.06 mg/l) and to norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin, all of which were more active than ampicillin or ceftazidime. Gardnerella vaginalis was not very susceptible to pefloxacin (MICs 2-8 mg/l), the other 4-quinolones or gentamicin but ampicillin and ceftazidime were highly active. Neisseria gonorrhoeae was very susceptible to pefloxacin and norfloxacin (MICs 0.016-0.12 mg/l) and ciprofloxacin (MICs 0.002-0.008 mg/l). The activity of pefloxacin (MICs 0.25-1 mg/l) was similar to that of ciprofloxacin (MICs 0.12-2 mg/l) but greater than that of norfloxacin (MICs 0.5-4 mg/l) against Staphylococcus aureus. Vancomycin (MICs 1-2 mg/l) had similar activity in vitro but whilst gentamicin was highly active against some isolates, others were resistant. Pefloxacin (MICs mostly 4-32 mg/l) and the other 4-quinolones had lower activity against streptococci (including alpha-, beta-, and non-haemolytic strains, enterococci and pneumococci) than against staphylococci. Benzylpenicillin (or ampicillin in the case of enterococci) were usually more active than any of the 4-quinolones. Bacteroides species, both of the fragilis and melaninogenicus/oralis groups were generally moderately resistant to pefloxacin (MICs 2-32 mg/l) and norfloxacin though ciprofloxacin was more active. Whilst the activity of pefloxacin and the other 4-quinolones was generally somewhat higher against the other anaerobes, ampicillin generally had greater activity.
TI  - Neutrophil activity in abscess-bearing mice: comparative studies with neutrophils isolated from peripheral blood, elicited peritoneal exudates, and abscesses.
AB  - Intraabdominal abscesses were induced in mice by intraperitoneal inoculation of Bacteroides fragilis and Escherichia coli plus bran as the abscess-potentiating agent. Six- or seven-day-old abscesses were mechanically disaggregated in buffer, and the cells obtained were fractionated on discontinuous Percoll density gradients. Neutrophil populations of different density, each approximately 90% pure, were isolated. When the abscess-derived neutrophils were subsequently incubated with normal serum in vitro under aerobic conditions, the viability of the gram-negative bacteria that had been phagocytosed within the abscess did not change significantly. This anergy to intracellular bacteria (on subsequent incubation in vitro under optimal conditions for phagocytic killing) was also found for neutrophils that had been obtained from abscesses induced by a mixture that included Proteus mirabilis plus B. fragilis and from those induced by E. coli plus P. mirabilis. While unable to significantly kill intracellular organisms that had been phagocytosed in vivo, the abscess-derived neutrophils could engulf and kill organisms to which they were exposed in vitro. Neutrophils from abscesses induced by P. mirabilis only plus bran killed that organism introduced in vitro significantly more effectively than the organisms that had been engulfed in vivo. In contrast, neutrophils from abscesses induced by the gram-positive organism Staphylococcus aureus plus bran were able to kill their intracellular organisms on subsequent incubation in vitro as effectively as they could kill added S. aureus. Neutrophils isolated from the peripheral blood and from induced peritoneal exudates of abscess-bearing mice were able to phagocytose and kill organisms in vitro with greater efficiency than abscess-derived neutrophils. The mechanism whereby neutrophils from abscesses induced by the gram-positive organism S. aureus can kill the organisms phagocytosed in vivo on subsequent in vitro incubation, in contrast to the relative anergy to their intracellular organisms displayed by neutrophils derived from abscesses induced by combinations of gram-negative bacteria, is not known.
TI  - The relationship between Fusobacterium species and other flora in mixed infection.
AB  - Mixed infections with three Fusobacterium species and seven other bacterial species were studied in a subcutaneous abscess model in mice. Fifteen Fusobacterium isolates (eight F. nucleatum, four F. necrophorum, and three F. varium) and one isolate each of Bacteroides fragilis, B. asaccharolyticus, Staphylococcus aureus, Group A beta-haemolytic streptococcus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were studied. Electronmicrographs showed the presence of a thin mucopolysaccharide wall before and after inoculation into mice in 12 isolates which included all of 11 Fusobacterium isolates that induced subcutaneous abscesses. After co-inoculation of Fusobacterium isolates with other species and selective therapy with antimicrobial agents, S. aureus and K. pneumoniae were found to be of equal or greater importance in abscess induction than were Fusobacterium isolates, while Fusobacterium isolates were found to be more important than Group A streptococci and E. coli. Mutual enhancement of the numbers of organisms in mixed infections was observed with Fusobacterium spp. and K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa or Bacteroides spp. Suppression of Fusobacterium spp. was noticed only when they were co-inoculated with Group A streptococci. The additive or synergistic capabilities of Fusobacterium species highlighted their potential pathogenicity in infection.
TI  - Ability of oral bacteria to degrade fibronectin.
AB  - The fibronectin-degrading ability of 116, mainly oral, strains was assayed by using plasma-derived fibronectin adsorbed to a polystyrene surface. Ability to degrade fibronectin was revealed in strains of Bacteroides gingivalis, Bacteroides intermedius, Bacteroides loeschii, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Peptococcus prevotii, Clostridium sporogenes, and Propionibacterium acnes. The fibronectinolytic activity of subgingival bacteriological samples was found to be related to the presence of B. gingivalis and B. intermedius. In addition, strains of the nonoral Bacteroides species B. asaccharolyticus and B. fragilis showed fibronectin-degrading ability. No such ability was detected in the oral strains tested of Streptococcus, Veillonella, Actinomyces, Lactobacillus, Actinobacillus, Capnocytophaga, Fusobacterium, or Haemophilus species.
TI  - Head-space gas-liquid chromatographic analysis for presumptive identification of  bacteria in blood cultures.
AB  - A total of 445 strains of common aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were analyzed for their volatile microbial metabolites by head-space gas-liquid chromatography. The bacteria were incubated for 24 or 48 h in blood-containing Trypticase soy or Lombard-Dowell glucose broth before being analyzed by automatic head-space injection. From the chromatographic pattern obtained, the majority of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Morganella morganii, Staphylococcus aureus, enterococci, Bacteroides fragilis, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Propionibacterium acnes could be characterized. The head-space technique developed provides a rapid, direct and easily-performed means for presumptive identification of bacteria found in blood culture.
TI  - [A case of toxic shock syndrome].
AB  
TI  - Antibacterial activity of ofloxacin and its mode of action.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of ofloxacin against Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae was comparable to norfloxacin and enoxacin, and far exceeded the activity of pipemidic acid and nalidixic acid. The activity of ofloxacin was two to eight times less than that of ciprofloxacin. Ofloxacin was more active against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Acinetobacter spp., Legionella spp., and Bacteroides fragilis, than norfloxacin, enoxacin, pipemidic acid and nalidixic acid, and the activity of ofloxacin was comparable to that of ciprofloxacin. Ofloxacin was two to seven times more effective than norfloxacin in systemic infections in mice with S. aureus, Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens and P. aeruginosa. Ofloxacin strongly inhibited DNA supercoiling activity of DNA gyrase purified from E. coli KL-16. There is a parallel relationship between antibacterial activity of ofloxacin and its inhibitory action against DNA gyrases from ofloxacin-susceptible and ofloxacin-resistant clinical isolates of E. coli. These results indicate that the high bactericidal action of ofloxacin and the related new quinolone agents can be explained by their potent inhibitory activities against DNA gyrase in bacterial cells.
TI  - Protease production by microorganisms associated with reproductive tract infection.
AB  - Factors influencing pathogenicity of various microbes found in the female lower genital tract remain incompletely understood. Protease production by cervico/vaginal microorganisms may alter or inactivate a variety of proteins important in host defense and structural-functional integrity including collagen-containing chorioamniotic membranes and uterine cervix. Host tissues may be made more susceptible to other organisms' virulence factors by protease-producing members of genital tract local flora. Microorganisms themselves may also be influenced by the presence of other microbial protease. Nonspecific protease, gelatinase, collagenase, and elastase production was examined for in vitro with use of aerobic (30) and anaerobic (25) strains of microorganisms typical of those isolated from the lower genital tract of women with premature rupture of membranes, chorioamnionitis, and puerperal infection. Microorganisms including Bacteroides bivius, Bacteroides melaninogenicus, Bacteroides fragilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus species, and Propionibacterium acnes produce various proteases. Protease production by both acknowledged pathogenic and commensal bacteria may contribute to the occurrence of reproductive tract morbidity including premature rupture of membranes and preterm labor.
TI  - Enhancement of growth of aerobic and facultative bacteria in mixed infections with Bacteroides species.
AB  - The potential for mutual enhancement of growth of the Bacteroides fragilis and B. melaninogenicus groups and the aerobic and facultative organisms commonly isolated with them in mixed infections was evaluated. Enhancement was studied by measuring the relative increase in CFU of the two bacterial components inducing subcutaneous abscesses in mice. Of the 42 combinations between three isolates each of the B. fragilis and B. melaninogenicus groups and seven aerobic or facultative organisms, Bacteroides spp. were enhanced in only 8 and inhibited in 4. The aerobic and facultative bacteria were enhanced in 31 of the 42 combinations and depressed in 2. The organisms uniformly enhanced by all of the Bacteroides spp. were group A streptococci and Escherichia coli (all six instances), followed by Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae (five of six instances), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (four instances), group D streptococci (in three instances only by the B. fragilis group), and Haemophilus influenzae (one instance). It is apparent that the growth rate of facultative and aerobic bacteria is enhanced much more in mixed infections with Bacteroides spp. than that of their anaerobic counterparts.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of ticarcillin in the presence of clavulanate potassium.
AB  - The antibacterial effects produced by ticarcillin disodium plus clavulanate potassium, a combination of the broad-spectrum penicillin ticarcillin, and the beta-lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid as the potassium salt, have been measured in vitro and in experimental infection studies. The presence of clavulanic acid resulted in a significant enhancement of the activity of ticarcillin against a wide range of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria. These included ticarcillin-resistant strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, P. vulgaris, Yersinia enterocolitica, and the anaerobe Bacteroides fragilis. In addition, beta-lactamase-producing isolates of Hemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Staphylococcus aureus were susceptible to ticarcillin and clavulanate. Clavulanic acid did not influence the activity of ticarcillin against ticarcillin-susceptible bacteria. The bactericidal effects of the antibiotic combination were measured in an in vitro kinetic model in which the drug concentrations were varied to simulate those measured in humans after intravenous dosing with ticarcillin (3.0 g) and clavulanate potassium (100 mg clavulanic acid). In these tests, ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid had pronounced bactericidal activity against ticarcillin-resistant bacteria. The protection of ticarcillin by clavulanic acid from inactivation by bacterial beta-lactamases in vivo was demonstrated in experimental infection models in which the efficacy of the ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid combination against infections caused by beta-lactamase-producing bacteria was correlated with the presence of effective concentrations of both antibiotic and inhibitor at the site of infection.
TI  - The cefoperazone-sulbactam combination. In vitro qualities including beta-lactamase stability, antimicrobial activity, and interpretive criteria for disk diffusion tests.
AB  - Three concentrations of the penicillanic acid sulfone, sulbactam were tested in combination with cefoperazone against 632 recent clinical bacterial isolates. Cefoperazone was effective alone (less than or equal to 16 micrograms/mL) against 95% of Enterobacteriaceae and combined with 4 micrograms/mL sulbactam inhibited 99.5% of strains. This coverage of enteric bacilli was superior to timentin (99.1%), ceftazidime (98.2%), and tobramycin (90.9%). The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of cefoperazone-susceptible strains also were markedly decreased by sulbactam (overall MIC90s, 8.0 micrograms/mL for cefoperazone and 1.0 microgram/mL for cefoperazone and 4.0 micrograms/mL for sulbactam). Sulbactam also expanded the spectrum of cefoperazone against Acinetobacter species, some rare Pseudomonas species, and Bacteroides fragilis group species. Sulbactam had direct antimicrobial activity against the acinetobacters and Pseudomonas acidovorans, but the increased activity of cefoperazone-sulbactam against some other Pseudomonas species and anaerobes was attributed to beta-lactamase inhibition. The cefoperazone MICs against beta-lactamase producing Staphylococcus species also were lowered to the level of enzyme-deficient strains. Cefoperazone bactericidal activity was improved by 4.0 micrograms/mL sulbactam, and no antagonism was observed. beta-lactamase hydrolysis studies confirmed a slow hydrolysis of cefoperazone only by TEM beta-lactamases and a high-grade resistance to enzyme breakdown by sulbactam. Differential beta-lactamase affinity studies for cefoperazone and sulbactam showed potential efficacy and applications to plasmid-mediated TEM and OXA enzymes and only marginal effective sulbactam inhibition of Pseudomonas and Klebsiella species enzymes. Disk diffusion studies on 556 strains confirmed the applicability of the cefoperazone 75-micrograms disk to testing routine isolates other than enterococci and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. The addition of 4.0 micrograms sulbactam/mL in a fixed concentration to dilution test systems and 15 micrograms sulbactam to the 75 micrograms cefoperazone disk were recommended for in vitro tests. Susceptibility and resistant interpretive criteria for the disk and dilution tests can be applied with confidence. Only 0.4% false-susceptibility errors and a 97.5% absolute interpretive agreement were achieved using the 75 micrograms cefoperazone/15 micrograms sulbactam disk.
TI  - Multiplicity of macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin antibiotic resistance determinants.
AB  - Bacteria can resist macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin (MLS) antibiotics enzymically by alteration of the target site or detoxification of the antibiotic. N6-dimethylation of adenine in 23 S ribosomal RNA confers resistance to M, L, and S B-type (MLSB) antibiotics. Investigation, by DNA annealing, of the relationship between the genes specifying this resistance mechanism from Streptococcus (groups A,B,D, and H, and pneumoniae), Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus licheniformis, Bacteroides fragilis, Lactobacillus casei, and Streptomyces erythreus indicated substantial sequence diversity among the MLSB resistance (R) determinants. A minimum of four distinct classes of MLSB R determinants could be defined: classes A and B for the Gram-positive cocci (streptococci pmeumococci and staphylococci), class C for B. licheniformis, and class D for Bact. fragilis. These data do not support the hypothesis that the R determinants were acquired recently from a single common origin and suggest an easy exchange of genetic information among the Gram-positive cocci. The genetic classes do not correlate with differences in phenotypic expression or in regulation (inducibility or constitutivity) of resistance towards MLSB antibiotics. Inactivation of the drug confers resistance to M and/or L and/or S or SA or SB antibiotics and has been detected in strains of Streptococcus, Staph. aureus, Lactobacillus, C. perfringens, Streptomyces, and recently in the Gram-negative organism Escherichia coli. We have cloned and sequenced a DNA fragment conferring high level resistance (MIC greater than 2 g/l) to erythromycin by hydrolysis of the antibiotic. The distribution of this 'new' character in enterobacteria isolated from human faeces was studied by colony hybridization using an intragenic probe. The gene for the erythromycin esterase was detected in numerous strains of E. coli belonging to various biotypes, in Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter agglomerans, and in one 'coliform'. Moreover, our results indicated the existence of at least two classes of genes specifying resistance to erythromycin by inactivation of the antibiotic in enterobacteria.
TI  - Evolution and epidemiology of MLS resistance.
AB  - Within the framework of this symposium, it is not feasible to present an exhaustive description of the present state of knowledge regarding the sensitivity and resistance of bacterial species to macrolides, lincosamides and streptogramins (MLS). This paper is limited to a description of the evolution of different types of resistance in the light of decisive factors described in previous papers, in order to deduce, if at all possible, trends in future strategy in therapeutics. Only acquired resistance lends itself to epidemiological study, in contrast to natural resistance which is, by definition, characteristic of a species or a genus, and not liable to change. Three groups will therefore be studied in turn: Staphylococcus aureus, streptococci and Bacteroides fragilis. There is as yet insufficient accumulated data to draw conclusions regarding the epidemiology and evolution of MLSB resistance observed in Clostridium perfringens and Corynebacterium diphtheriae, or regarding the high-level resistance to erythromycin due to enzymatic inactivation recently described in Escherichia coli.
TI  - In vitro activity of ceftazidime in combination with other antibiotics.
AB  - 189 bacterial strains were investigated for their in vitro sensitivity against ceftazidime (alone and in combination with another antibiotic). Moreover, the possibility to prevent development of secondary bacterial resistance as observed in subcultures at subinhibitory antibiotic concentrations, was studied using specific antibiotic combinations. Of 115 staphylococcal strains (91 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 24 strains of Staphylococcus epidermidis), 2% were sensitive, 82% were moderately sensitive and 16% were resistant to ceftazidime. On combining ceftazidime with vancomycin, synergism was found in 61% of the strains, and secondary resistance to ceftazidime could be prevented with this combination. The combination of ceftazidime and clindamycin showed synergism in 26% and an additive effect in 48% of the strains. Secondary resistance to ceftazidime did not develop with this combination in subcultures at subinhibitory concentrations in which loss of activity was only minimal with clindamycin alone. Rifampicin and fusidic acid were highly active against staphylococci. In combination with ceftazidime, only weak synergism or additive effects were seen in most strains; no antagonism could be observed. In subcultures at subinhibitory concentrations, secondary resistance to rifampicin and fusidic acid developed rapidly and could be partially prevented by adding ceftazidime. Of 60 Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, 84% were sensitive, 13% were moderately sensitive and 2% were resistant to ceftazidime. Synergism was most frequently observed when ceftazidime was combined with tobramycin. Using this combination, secondary resistance of Pseudomonas strains to ceftazidime did not develop. When ceftazidime was combined with piperacillin, synergism was observed in most strains, but the development of secondary resistance in vitro was not prevented.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Comparative clinical evaluation of imipenem/cilastatin vs. cefotaxime in treatment of severe bacterial infections.
AB  - Adult patients with severe bacterial infections caused by organisms susceptible to imipenem and cefotaxime were given either imipenem/cilastatin sodium (MK0787/MK0791) or cefotaxime as a part of a multiclinic randomized study to evaluate the effectiveness, safety, and tolerability of imipenem/cilastatin. Clinical diagnoses included bacteremia, urinary tract infection, osteomyelitis, mediastinitis, lower respiratory tract infection, and soft tissue infection. Efficacy was evaluated for 10 patients given imipenem/cilastatin and for 10 patients given cefotaxime. Major pathogens isolated included Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Bacteroides fragilis, and Peptostreptococcus species. Satisfactory clinical responses were noted in 90% of the patients in both treatment groups. Eradication of the pathogen was achieved in nine of 10 patients treated with imipenem/cilastatin and in 10 of 10 patients treated with cefotaxime. No major adverse effects were found in patients in each treatment group. The results of this study suggest that imipenem/cilastatin sodium is a relatively safe and effective antibiotic for the treatment of adult patients with severe infections caused by susceptible organisms.
TI  - Effect of bacterial competition on the opsonization, phagocytosis, and intracellular killing of microorganisms by granulocytes.
AB  - The ingestion of Escherichia coli by human granulocytes in vitro was reduced in the presence of Bacteroides fragilis or Staphylococcus aureus. This reduction of ingestion proved to be mainly attributable to the absence of opsonization of E. coli, which was due to complement consumption by B. fragilis and S. aureus. The intracellular killing of E. coli was decreased in the presence of B. fragilis and S. aureus because of consumption of complement components required for extracellular stimulation of granulocytes to kill intracellular bacteria. Decreased intracellular killing of E. coli by granulocytes containing either B. fragilis or S. aureus is due to the limited killing capacity of granulocytes. These interactions between E. coli and B. fragilis or S. aureus found for phagocytosis and intracellular killing were also observed in in vivo studies: in an experimental thigh lesion infection in mice, E. coli showed stronger proliferation after coinoculation with B. fragilis or with S. aureus than after injection of E. coli alone. These in vitro and in vivo findings indicate that bacterial interactions, not only between aerobic and anaerobic bacteria but also between two species of aerobic microorganisms, compete for host defense mechanisms (i.e., opsonization, phagocytosis, and intracellular killing).
TI  - Role of imipenem/cilastatin in the treatment of soft tissue infections.
AB  - Imipenem/cilastatin was given to 243 evaluable patients with moderately severe to severe soft tissue infections. Cultures prior to therapy yielded Staphylococcus aureus (108 isolates), group D and non-group D enterococci (49), group A streptococci (42), other aerobic gram-positive cocci (72), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (54), Escherichia coli (32), Proteus mirabilis (31), Enterobacter (21), Klebsiella (20), other aerobic gram-negative rods (58), Bacteroides fragilis group (16), and other anaerobes (65). Overall, 95 percent (230 of 243) of the patients treated had clinical cure (137 of 243) or improvement (93 of 243). Of the 506 strains of etiologic bacterial pathogens isolated from these patients and tested against imipenem, 498 (98 percent) were susceptible to the antibiotic. Many were resistant to both older and newer penicillins and cephalosporins. Serial cultures of infection sites revealed that 426 of 498 (86 percent) of pre-therapy bacterial isolates were eradicated by imipenem/cilastatin therapy. Eight of 498 etiologic pathogens (1.6 percent) acquired resistance to imipenem (seven P. aeruginosa and one enterococcus). Such resistance acquisition was associated with clinical failure in two patients. Imipenem/cilastatin appears to be a highly effective, relatively safe therapy of soft tissue infections caused by a wide variety of gram-positive and gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes, both polymicrobial and monomicrobial in nature. Imipenem/cilastatin should be considered particularly when infection by the more antibiotic-resistant of these bacteria is suspected or proved.
TI  - In-vitro activity of Sch 34343 against nosocomial pathogens: methicillin-resistant staphylococci, gentamicin-susceptible and -resistant Streptococcus faecalis, Clostridium difficile and Bacteroides fragilis.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of Sch 34343, a new beta-lactam antimicrobial, was studied  in vitro by quantitative broth dilution methods. It was found to have good antibacterial activity against four emerging problem pathogens: methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis isolates showing high level resistance to gentamicin (and other aminoglycosides), Clostridium difficile (the cause of pseudomembranous colitis), and Bacteroides fragilis. On the basis of these promising results, Sch 34343 merits further in-vitro and in-vivo study to define its potential usefulness in treatment of infections with these pathogens in humans.
TI  - A comparison of the antimicrobial activities of noxythiolin and formaldehyde solutions.
AB  - The availability of a rapid and highly specific polarographic method of analysis  for formaldehyde enabled investigation of the rate of formaldehyde release from noxythiolin solutions and actual concentrations of formaldehyde in solutions during clinical use and storage. The antimicrobial activity of noxythiolin solutions, equivalent pure formaldehyde solutions and N-methylthiourea individually or in combination was examined against standard bacteriological strains and clinical isolates. Several interesting observations were made. Clinical isolates were found to be relatively susceptible to noxythiolin in contrast to laboratory strains. The growth phase of the organism radically affects activity, early exponential phase cells being susceptible to 1.0% noxythiolin. Levels of formaldehyde detected in fresh noxythiolin solutions are extremely low and would not appear to be solely responsible for the antimicrobial activity observed.
TI  - [Multicenter study of the in vitro effect of imipenem (N-formimidoyl-thienamycin) on hospital bacteria].
AB  - Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of imipenem were evaluated by agar dilution for 2 895 bacterial strains isolated in 9 hospitals. Imipenem proved highly active against Enterobacteriaceae, with an MIC less than or equal to 0.25 for 63% of the 1 556 tested strains, less than or equal to 1 for 89.6% and less than or equal to 4 for 99%. The different groups of Enterobacteriaceae exhibited similar mode MICs (0.12 to 0.25), with the exception of Serratia (0.25-0.5), P. mirabilis (0.5), indole-positive Proteus (2), and Providencia (1). MICs of most cefotaxime-resistant strains were within the susceptibility range. Imipenem also exhibited satisfactory activity against P. aeruginosa (mode MIC 1-2) and Acinetobacter sp. (mode MIC: 0.25-0.5). MICs ranged from 0.03 to 4 (mode MIC: 0.5) for Haemophilus sp. and 0.25 to 1 for Gonococci, regardless of beta-lactamase-production status. MICs for Meningococci were less than or equal to 0,06. Methicillin-susceptible Staphylococci had low MICs, ranging from 0.008 to 0.5 (mode MIC : 0.016); MICs for methicillin-resistant strains varied widely, from 0.016 to 64, and were higher after incubation at 30 degrees C. Streptococci, except for Enterococci, and Pneumococci were highly susceptible (usually 0.008-0.03); MICs for Enterococci varied from 0,12 to 32 (mode MIC: 1-2). Except for four C. difficile strains, all tested anaerobic strains were inhibited by concentrations less than or equal to 1 (mode MICs: 0.06 for C. perfringens and 0.03 for B. fragilis).
TI  - In-vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability and inhibitory properties of a new penem antibiotic, Sch 34343.
AB  - Sch 34343 is a new penem antibiotic. Its in-vitro activity was determined against Gram-positive and -negative aerobic and anaerobic isolates. Sch 34343 inhibited 90% of strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella spp, Citrobacter spp. and Shigella spp. at less than 1 mg/1. Ninety per cent of strains of Enterobacter, Morganella and Providencia spp. were inhibited by less than 4 mg/1. Sch 34343 did not inhibit Pseudomonas spp., and it had slightly less activity against Enterobacteriaceae than did cefotaxime or latamoxef (moxalactam), but it inhibited organisms resistant to cefoxitin, cefoperazone and piperacillin. Sch 34343 inhibited methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus at less than or equal to 0.25 mg/1, and it inhibited haemolytic streptococci at less than or equal to 0.06 mg/1. Sch 34343 inhibited Bacteroides fragilis at 0.06 mg/1, including some cefoxitin-resistant isolates. Sch 34343 was not hydrolysed by plasmid- or chromosomally-mediated beta-lactamases, was an excellent inhibitor of Richmond-Sykes type Ia beta-lactamases, and also inhibited, although less effectively, the common plasmid beta-lactamases. It induced beta-lactamases, but inhibited Enterobacter and Citrobacter spp. in which it induced beta-lactamase activity.
TI  - Comparative in-vitro activity of Sch 34343, a new penem antibiotic.
AB  - Using an agar dilution technique we examined the in-vitro activity of Sch 34343 against 485 clinical bacterial isolates. Ampicillin, mezlocillin, cefuroxime, cefotaxime, cefotetan, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, imipenem (N-formimidoyl thienamycin) and gentamicin were used for comparison. Sch 34343 exhibited activity against all species tested, excepting Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas species. Unlike many newer beta-lactams, Sch 34343 was highly active against Gram-positive species. It was consistently active against the Enterobacteriaceae, with MIC50 and MIC90 being usually closely similar, as were results with two inoculum sizes (104 and 106 cfu). This, together with its activity against strains resistant to many other beta-lactam agents, suggested high stability to beta-lactamases. Sch 34343 was the most active compound tested against Bacteroides fragilis. In tests of combined bacteriostatic action with gentamicin no synergy was seen. It had bactericidal action in broth culture, against sensitive strains of E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis. It showed good stability in aqueous solution and serum at low temperatures at pH values in the physiological range, and was moderately stable at 37 degrees C. Binding in human plasma was 72%. We concluded that Sch 34343 is a highly promising agent with a broad spectrum of activity making it potentially suitable as monotherapy for patients with infection of undetermined bacterial aetiology, particularly if Bact. fragilis is a possible pathogen.
TI  - [In vitro activity of ceftriaxone on hospital bacteria. Results of a multicenter  study].
AB  - Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of ceftriaxone were determined by agar dilution for 2 099 strains isolated in six teaching hospitals. MICs were less than 1 microgram/ml for the great majority of Enterobacteriaceae, with mode MICs varying across groups from less than 0.008 micrograms/ml for Proteus (mirabilis and indole-positive) to 0.25 for Enterobacter. Only a few resistant strains were found, mainly among Enterobacter and Citrobacter. Ceftriaxone proved noticeably less active against P. aeruginosa and Acinetobacter (mode MICs: 16 micrograms/ml). Haemophilus sp. and Gonococci, regardless of beta-lactamase production status, as well as Neisseria meningitidis, were highly susceptible (MIC less than 0.008-0.032). Ceftriaxone was moderately active against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (MIC: 2 to 8 micrograms/ml) and failed to inhibit methicillin resistant strains. Enterococci were slightly susceptible or resistant, whereas the other Streptococci and Pneumococci had low MICs (0.03-0.25). A fairly wide range of MICs was found for anaerobes (Clostridium: 0.06-2, Bacteroides: 0.5-32). Our data show that its particularly strong activity against Proteus, Haemophilus and Neisseria sets ceftriaxone apart from the other third-generation cephalosporins.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of carumonam (AMA-1080), a new N-sulfonated monocyclic beta-lactam antibiotic.
AB  - The in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of carumonam (AMA-1080), a synthetic sulfazecin derivative, were compared with those of aztreonam, cefoperazone, ceftazidime, and cefsulodin. Carumonam was highly active in vitro against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Haemophilus influenzae and weakly active against Streptococcus pneumoniae, but it was not active against Staphylococcus aureus. The MICs of carumonam for 90% of 1,156 clinical Enterobacteriaceae isolates were between 0.013 and 25 micrograms/ml, which were the lowest MICs of the antibiotics tested. The MIC of carumonam for 90% of Klebsiella oxytoca was 0.2 micrograms/ml, whereas that of aztreonam was 50 micrograms/ml. The superiority of carumonam to aztreonam and the reference cephalosporins was also demonstrated by their activities against Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae. The MIC of carumonam for 90% of P. aeruginosa was 12.5 micrograms/ml, which was comparable to the MICs of aztreonam and ceftazidime. Carumonam showed a high affinity for the penicillin-binding protein 3 of gram-negative bacteria, but not for the penicillin-binding proteins of S. aureus and Bacteroides fragilis. Carumonam was resistant to hydrolysis by 12 plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases and 7 chromosomal beta-lactamases. It was more stable than aztreonam to hydrolysis by the beta-lactamase of K. oxytoca; this stability is related to the superiority of the in vitro and in vivo activities of carumonam to those of aztreonam against this species. In general, the protective activities (50% effective dose) of carumonam and reference antibiotics in mice with experimental intraperitoneal infections correlated with the in vitro activities (MIC); carumonam showed excellent protective activity against most aerobic gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo activities of DN-9550, a new broad-spectrum cephalosporin.
AB  - DN-9550 [(6R, 7R)-7-[(Z)-2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-2-(1H-imidazol-4-yl) methoxyiminoacetamido]-3-[(1-pyridinio)methyl]-8-oxo-5-thia -1-azabicyclo methyl]-8-oxo-5-thia-1-azabicyclo[4.2.0]oct-2-ene-2-carboxylate hydrochloride] is a new semisynthetic cephalosporin with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. The activity of DN-9550 against most species of the family Enterobacteriaceae was roughly comparable to that of ceftazidime, slightly lower than that of cefotaxime, and far exceeded that of cefoperazone. Against Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, and Serratia marcescens, DN-9550 was more active than ceftazidime and cefotaxime. DN-9550 and ceftazidime were significantly more active than cefotaxime against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but DN-9550 and cefotaxime were clearly more active than ceftazidime against staphylococci and streptococci. Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae were also highly susceptible to DN-9550, but Bacteroides fragilis was generally not susceptible to the compound. DN-9550 was stable to various types of beta-lactamases and had high affinities for penicillin-binding protein 3 of both Escherichia coli and P. aeruginosa. When DN-9550 was administered subcutaneously to mice experimentally infected with Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa, its efficacy well reflected its in vitro potency.
TI  - Prevalence of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria in chronic suppurative otitis media.
AB  - Aspiration of the exudate through open perforation was performed in 48 children with chronic suppurative otitis media. Eighty-two aerobic and 93 anaerobic isolates were recovered. Aerobic bacteria only were involved in 22 patients (46%), and anaerobic organisms only were involved in five patients (10%). Mixed aerobic and anaerobic isolates were recovered from 21 patients (44%). The most common bacteria isolated were Bacteroides melaninogenicus group (40% of patients), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (29%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (10%), and Staphylococcus aureus (10%). There were 50 beta-lactamase-producing organisms (26 anaerobes and 24 aerobes) recovered from 33 patients (69%). Forty-four of these bacteria were isolated from the 37 patients recently treated with a penicillin. These included all ten isolates of S aureus and Bacteroides fragilis group, 11 of 19 of B melaninogenicus group, five of the 14 P aeruginosa, three of ten K pneumoniae, three of six of Bacteroides oralis, four of six of Haemophilus influenzae, two of three of Staphylococcus epidermidis, and two of four of Branhamella catarrhalis. The beta-lactamase-producing organisms have a possible role in the failure of penicillin therapy.
TI  - HR 810 and BMY-28142, two new cephalosporins with broad-spectrum activity: an in-vitro comparison with other beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of the new parenteral cephalosporins, HR 810 (HR) and BMY-28142 (BMY), was compared with that of other beta-lactam antibiotics, including cefotaxime, against a total of 315 recent clinical isolates and characterized beta-lactamase producers. An agar dilution procedure was used to determine MICs and two inocula (10(4) and 10(6) cfu) were used throughout. Against all species of the Enterobacteriaceae tested, both HR and BMY were as active as, or slightly more active than, cefotaxime. HR differed from cefotaxime mainly in being eight-fold more active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and two-fold more active against Staphylococcus aureus. BMY was also eight-fold more active than cefotaxime against Ps. aeruginosa but was two-fold less active than the latter against Staph. aureus. Both new compounds had good activity against Haemophilus influenzae, including the beta-lactamase producing strains of that species, and both had poor activity against the Bacteroides fragilis group (MIC90 greater than 128 mg/l).
TI  - Dynamics of resistance to cephalosporins.
AB  - Bacterial susceptibility to various cephalosporins of nine of the most frequently isolated organisms were analyzed for the five-year period 1980 to 1984. The disk diffusion susceptibility to cephalosporins of 1,640,031 strains of bacteria isolated from 242 hospitals in the United States were compared. No significant change has occurred in the susceptibility of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae, or Streptococcus faecalis for this period; Enterobacter aerogenes showed a slight decrease in susceptibility to moxalactam, cephalothin, cefoxitin and cefamandole. Slight increases in susceptibility were observed with Pseudomonas aeruginosa to cefotaxime and moxalactam and for Bacteroides fragilis to cefoxitin and cefamandole. Staphylococcus aureus showed slight decreases in susceptibility to cefoperazone and ceftizoxime and slight increase to moxalactam.
TI  - Variation in microbial survival and growth in intravenous fluids.
AB  - The survival and growth of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, as well as a yeast, was studied in intravenous fluids over a 3-day period. Solutions were experimentally contaminated with pathogenic strains of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacteroides fragilis and Candida albicans. Samples of these solutions were tested on each day up to 3 days for determining viable numbers of the organisms by a membrane filtration method. Each organism showed a different survival/growth pattern in various infusion fluids. In 5% dextrose, C. albicans multiplied but only 2-3% of the initial viable cells of E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and S. aureus were detected after 3 days. In 0.9% sodium chloride, C. albicans and S. aureus showed growth and E. coli remained viable, but P. aeruginosa was not detected after 72 h. In lactated Ringer's solution, P. aeruginosa and C. albicans grew but E. coli and S. aureus were not detected after 72 h. In the amino acid solution, C. albicans, S. aureus and E. coli grew but P. aeruginosa and B. fragilis were not detected. Results indicate that the pattern of microbial survival and growth may be substantially different in various intravenous fluids.
TI  - Detection of gram-negative bacteremia by limulus amebocyte lysate assay: evaluation in a rat model of peritonitis.
AB  - A spectrophotometric Limulus amebocyte lysate assay using lysis filtration and centrifugation has been developed for the detection of gram-negative bacteria in blood. The assay is directed at detection of endotoxin in viable and nonviable bacteria present in the blood-stream and not detection of free endotoxin in plasma. The assay was evaluated in a model of peritonitis in which rats were challenged with an inoculum consisting of sterilized human feces, barium sulfate, and one of eight species of bacteria. This assay was able to detect gram-negative bacteremia due to Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, and Klebsiella pneumoniae in the rat model when compared with sham-inoculated uninfected rats. The assay failed to detect bacteremia due to Bacteroides fragilis or Staphylococcus aureus, nor was there a significant rise in absorbance when a pellet containing sterilized feces was implanted in the rat.
TI  - Cefmetazole: a broad spectrum cephem antibiotic effective on methicillin- and cephem-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Antibacterial activity of cefmetazole (CMZ) was investigated by the plate dilution method. Since CMZ is stable to any type of bacterial beta-lactamases, it inhibited growth of Escherichia coli carrying R plasmids, Klebsiella spp., Proteus vulgaris, and Bacteroides fragilis at the concentration of less than 0.78 to 25.0 micrograms/ml. The distinct characteristic of CMZ is its anti-MRSA (methicillin- and cephem-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) activity. Exclusively in MRSA, a new fraction of penicillin binding proteins (PBP) with a relative molecular mass of 78 kd apears, and the 78 kd/PBP possesses low binding affinity to beta-lactam antibiotics. By the competitive binding experiment of beta-lactam drugs to the PBPs of MRSA, it was revealed that CMZ and cephaloridine retain binding affinities to the new 78kd/PBP fraction of MRSA.
TI  - Effect of hemothorax on experimental empyema thoracis in the guinea pig.
AB  - An experimental model for empyema thoracis in the Duncan-Harley guinea pig is introduced. Empyema thoracis development and early death (less than 14 days after bacterial inoculation) were noted after various concentrations and species were inoculated into the pleural space with a piece of umbilical tape, which was used as a cofactor. The effect of concomitant hemothorax was also tested. Group I (N = 90) had intrapleural inoculation of umbilical tape and various concentrations (10(4), 10(6), 10(8) organisms/ml) of various bacterial species, which included Staphylococcus aureus (N = 30), Escherichia coli (N = 30), and Bacteroides fragilis (N = 30). Group II (N = 90) had intrapleural inoculation of umbilical tape, 1 ml of autologous blood, and the same varying concentrations and species of bacteria as Group I. The observation period was 14 days, during which time early deaths were noted. Fifty-eight percent of the staphylococcal group of animals, 37% of the E. coli group of animals, and none of the B. fragilis group of animals developed empyema. Animals with empyema developed significant weight loss (p less than 0.05) and roentgenographic evidence of empyema, which was supported by postmortem pleural reaction and pneumonia scores (p less than 0.05). Higher concentrations of inoculated bacteria produced a higher incidence of empyema in the S. aureus and E. coli groups (p less than 0.05), but concomitant hemothorax did not increase the already high incidence of empyema and early death in the E. coli group. Empyema caused by B. fragilis did not develop, even with cofactors of umbilical tape and blood. Anaerobic infections in this model may require the presence of other aerobic or facultative organisms, the presence of necrotic lung, prior malnutrition, or a combination thereof.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of three new quinolone antibiotics against recent clinical isolates.
AB  - New orally absorbable quinolone derivatives, ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, and ofloxacin demonstrated excellent activity in vitro against clinical isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus sp. indole-positive, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes and enterococci. None of the 3 drugs was more than moderately effective against Bacteroides fragilis. Ciprofloxacin was 2-4 times more effective against most gram-negative strains than was either norfloxacin or ofloxacin, and was also the most effective against gram-positive strains, though the difference was less marked. Ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin were almost equally effective against S. aureus. Results with agar and with broth were comparable. The activities of all 3 drugs were essentially independent of inoculum size, as the MIC values increased less than one dilution step when the inoculum was increased from 10(3) to 10(6). The new quinolone derivatives would appear to be promising alternatives to injectable drugs such as the aminoglycosides and cephalosporins.
TI  - In-vitro activity of pefloxacin compared to enoxacin, norfloxacin, gentamicin and new beta-lactams.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of pefloxacin was compared with that of norfloxacin, enoxacin, nalidixic acid, gentamicin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime and, where appropriate, other beta-lactams against a total of 363 recent clinical isolates. An agar dilution procedure was used to determine MICs and two inocula (10(4) and 10(6) cfu) were used throughout. Pefloxacin inhibited 90% of isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, indole-positive Proteus spp., Enterobacter spp., Shigella sonnei, Salmonella typhi, Campylobacter jejuni, Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae at less than or equal to 0.5 mg/l. Serratia marcescens and Providencia stuartii were somewhat more resistant, 2 mg/l of pefloxacin being required to inhibit 90% of isolates of these species. Pefloxacin inhibited 90% of isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa at 4 mg/l and 90% of isolates of the Bacteroides fragilis group at 16 mg/l. The activity of enoxacin was similar to that of pefloxacin, with enoxacin being four-fold less active against Staph. aureus, two-fold less active against the Bacteroides fragilis group and most species of the Enterobacteriaceae, and two-fold more active against Ps. aeruginosa. Pefloxacin showed good activity against gentamicin-resistant Ps. aeruginosa and Enterobacteriaceae and against methicillin-resistant Staph. aureus. Strains with decreased susceptibility to norfloxacin tended to be less susceptible to both pefloxacin and enoxacin.
TI  - Bactericidal effects of photoradiation therapy with hematoporphyrin derivative.
AB  - Hematoporphyrin derivative (Hpd) localizes selectively in malignant and rapidly metabolizing tissues and undergoes a cytotoxic reaction when exposed to light of a specific wavelength. Hpd has been studied extensively with regard to the diagnosis and treatment of tumors but not with regard to bactericidal activity. This investigation assessed the effect of light-activated Hpd on various microorganisms, on human polymorphonuclear leukocytes, and on the interactions of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and bacteria. Light-activated Hpd was 99.9% bactericidal against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, Bacteroides fragilis, Streptococcus M-G intermedius, Streptococcus mutans, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Peptococcus magnus, and Clostridium perfringens, but did not affect Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, or Candida albicans. Photoactivation of Hpd rendered 98% of polymorphonuclear leukocytes inviable. Combinations of light-activated Hpd and polymorphonuclear leukocytes had a 4-log (99.99%) bactericidal effect on both intra- and extracellular S. aureus. The ability of Hpd to localize in inflammatory tissues may have therapeutic applications in the treatment of abscesses.
TI  - Cefmenoxime: in vitro activity.
AB  - The in vitro activity of cefmenoxime (SCE-1365 or A-50912), a new semisynthetic cephalosporin antibiotic, was determined for a broad spectrum of 1,234 organisms isolated as part of a multiclinic study. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of cefmenoxime required to inhibit at least 90 percent of strains tested (MIC90) ranged from 0.12 to 8 micrograms/ml for Enterobacteriaceae. MIC90S were 0.015 and 0.06 microgram/ml for Streptococcus pneumoniae and S. pyogenes, respectively, and 4 micrograms/ml for Staphylococcus aureus. Group D streptococci were less susceptible. The MIC90 of cefmenoxime for Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Hemophilus influenzae was 0.06 microgram/ml. Cefmenoxime was less active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter species, and Bacteroides fragilis (MIC50 = 16 micrograms/ml).
TI  - In vitro activity of CGP 31523A, a broad-spectrum cephalosporin, in comparison with those of other agents.
AB  - The in vitro activity of CGP 31523A, a new aminothiazolyl cephalosporin, was compared with those of cefoxitin, cefuroxime, moxalactam, piperacillin, ciprofloxacin, and other beta-lactams, when appropriate, against 533 recent clinical isolates and known resistant strains of bacteria. The MICs of CGP 31523A required to inhibit 90% (MIC90S) of the members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae were less than or equal to 0.25 micrograms/ml. Of Staphylococcus aureus (excluding methicillin-resistant strains) and Haemophilus influenzae, 90% were susceptible to 0.5 micrograms/ml. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Lancefield group D streptococci were resistant to CGP 31523A (MIC90, greater than or equal to 128 micrograms/ml). The activity against Bacteroides fragilis was modest (MIC90, 32 micrograms/ml). The susceptibility of known beta-lactamase-producing strains suggested that CGP 31523A was resistant to many beta-lactamases (but not those of Bacteroides fragilis). The serum protein binding of CGP 31523A was about 73%. The primary target site of CGP 31523A in Escherichia coli appeared to be penicillin-binding protein 3.
TI  - Bacteriology of chronic tonsillitis in young adults.
AB  - Tonsils were obtained from 22 young adults (mean age, 23 years) suffering from chronic tonsillitis. Mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora was obtained from core tonsillar cultures in all patients, yielding an average of 9.0 isolates (5.3 anaerobes and 3.7 aerobes) per specimen. The predominant anaerobic isolates were Bacteroides sp, Fusobacterium sp, and gram-positive cocci. The predominant aerobic isolates were alpha-hemolytic streptococci, Staphylococcus aureus, Branhamella catarrhalis, beta-hemolytic streptococci, and hemophilus sp. beta-Lactamase-production was noted in 32 isolates recovered from 18 tonsils (82%). These included all eight isolates of S aureus and five B fragilis, and 11 of 24 B melaninogenicus group (46%). Our findings indicate the polymicrobial nature of deep tonsillar flora in young adults with chronic tonsillitis, and demonstrate the presence of beta-lactamase-producing organisms in most of the patients.
TI  - Imipenem therapy of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other serious bacterial infections.
AB  - Imipenem is the first of a new class of beta-lactam antimicrobial agents with remarkable and extremely potent in vitro activity against most commonly isolated bacterial pathogens, including Staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus, members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacteroides fragilis, and Hemophilus influenzae. The clinical efficacy and toxicity of imipenem were evaluated in 35 patients with 38 different infections. The overall clinical response was favorable (infections cured or improved) in 89% of the infections (34 of 38). Of the 17 infections with P. aeruginosa, 15 were cured or improved. However, P. aeruginosa isolates resistant to imipenem emerged during the therapy of six infections, and two cases of P. aeruginosa septicemia later relapsed after imipenem therapy. Gastrointestinal toxicity (nausea with or without emesis) occurred in 17% of the patients (6 of 35) but was ameliorated by slowing the rate of intravenous infusion or lowering the dose of imipenem. Except for certain severe P. aeruginosa infections, imipenem is effective and relatively safe therapy for infections caused by susceptible organisms.
TI  - The presence of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria as a guideline in the management of children with recurrent tonsillitis.
AB  - Thirty-eight children who had recurrent tonsillitis and who were chronic carriers of group A beta-hemolytic streptococci (GABHS) were treated with oral clindamycin. Surface tonsillar cultures, obtained prior to therapy and two weeks after the termination of therapy, were processed for aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms. Mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora were obtained from all cultures. Prior to therapy, the average yield was 9.3 isolates (5.2 aerobes and 4.1 anaerobes) per specimen; after the completion of therapy, the average yield was 5.5 isolates (3.0 aerobes and 2.5 anaerobes). The GABHS were completely eliminated after clindamycin therapy, and the numbers of isolates of Bacteroides spp and Staphylococcus aureus were reduced. Beta-lactamase production was detected prior to therapy in 57 isolates recovered from all tonsillar surfaces. This group included all isolates of S. aureus (15) and Bacteroides fragilis (eight), 19 of 34 Bacteroides melaninogenicus isolates (56 per cent), and seven of 12 Bacteroides oralis isolates (58 per cent). Only four isolates of beta-lactamase-producing bacterial strains were recovered after the conclusion of therapy. Follow-up study of 33 children for eight to 16 months (average, 13 months) showed no recurrence of GABHS in 31.
TI  - Quantitative measurement of beta lactamase in tonsils of children with recurrent  tonsillitis.
AB  - Tonsils were obtained from 50 children suffering from recurrent tonsillitis. The  tonsils' core material was cultured for aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms. Beta lactamase production was assayed in all isolates and beta lactamase activity was measured in the contents of each tonsil. Mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora was obtained in all patients, yielding an average of 7.9 isolates (4.4 anaerobes and 3.5 aerobes) per specimen. Beta lactamase production was noted in 58 isolates recovered from 39 tonsils (78%). These were all 21 isolates of S. aureus and 10 B. fragilis, 18 of 45 B. melaninogenicus (40%), 7 of 14 B. oralis (50%), and 2 of 13 H. influenzae type B (15%). Beta lactamase activity was detected in 33 of the 39 (85%) tonsils which harbored beta lactamase-producing bacteria, and in none of the 11 tonsils which had no beta lactamase-producing bacteria. Our findings indicate the polymicrobial nature of deep tonsillar flora in children with recurrent tonsillitis, and demonstrate the presence of detectable beta lactamase activity in the tonsillar tissue in most of the tonsils which harbored beta lactamase-producing organism.
TI  - Cefonicid: a long-acting, second-generation cephalosporin. Antimicrobial activity, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy and adverse effects.
AB  - Cefonicid is a new second-generation cephalosporin with a broad antimicrobial spectrum of activity and a prolonged serum elimination half-life. It has good in vitro activity against methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, nonenterococcal streptococci, Hemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Neisseria meningitidis and many of the commonly isolated Enterobacteriaceae. Organisms usually resistant to cefonicid include species of Pseudomonas, Serratia, Acinetobacter and Providencia, and Bacteroides fragilis. The drug is 98% protein bound in human serum, which probably contributes to its significant reduction of antimicrobial activity measured in serum. Limited clinical trials have demonstrated it to be effective for surgical prophylaxis and for treating infections of the urinary tract, lower respiratory tract and bone. Failures have been reported in treatment of soft tissue infections and endocarditis caused by S. aureus. A potential cost reduction may be achieved by administering a single daily dose of cefonicid for established infections or a single preoperative dose for effective surgical prophylaxis instead of multiple-dose regimens of other, similar agents.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of ceftriaxone: a review.
AB  - Ceftriaxone possesses potent activity, both in vitro and in vivo, against a broad range of bacteria. MIC50 and MIC90 geometric means were calculated using the results of broth and agar dilution assays performed worldwide. The MIC90 for ceftriaxone overall was 8 micrograms/ml or less for Enterobacteriaceae and 0.024 microgram/ml or less for Neisseria and Hemophilus species. Moderate activity was noted against Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter species (MIC50 12 to 28 micrograms/ml). Ceftriaxone was extremely active against nonenterococcal streptococci (MIC90 0.07 microgram/ml or less) and quite active against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MIC90 5 micrograms/ml or less). Ceftriaxone generally was inactive against enterococci and methicillin-resistant staphylococci. Activity against anaerobes was good, except for many strains of Bacteroides fragilis and B. thetaiotaomicron (MIC greater than 64 micrograms/ml). Ceftriaxone exhibited excellent stability to beta-lactamases. The effect of medium and inoculum on in vitro testing was minimal. Excellent activity was demonstrated in vivo. Against Enterobacteriaceae, nonenterococcal streptococci, and H. influenzae, the PD50 in mice generally was less than 1 mg/kg. S. aureus strains responded moderately (mean PD50 6.5 mg/kg), whereas against most P. aeruginosa strains, PD50s ranged from 5 to greater than 250 mg/kg. The superior pharmacokinetic profile of ceftriaxone compared with that of other new cephalosporins was demonstrated by use of a prophylactic treatment schedule. The ability of ceftriaxone to penetrate the cerebrospinal fluid and provide excellent therapeutic coverage was confirmed in experimental meningitis models.
TI  - Presence of two unique genes encoding macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin resistance in members of the Bacteroides fragilis group as determined by DNA-DNA homology.
AB  - The relationship of a previously described, plasmid-encoded macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin (MLS) resistance determinant to Bacteroides fragilis group clinical isolates from 11 different patients with bacteroides infections was assessed using in situ hybridization. Most of the strains were found to have DNA sequences homologous with the bacteroides MLS plasmid, pBF4, but this homology was exclusively to chromosomal DNA. Two organisms isolated from different sites in a single patient did not share homology with the plasmid, and probably represent a second type of MLS gene. The MLS resistance plasmids, pBF4 (from Bact. fragilis) and pE194 (from Staphylococcus aureus), did not share homologous sequences; therefore at least one of the bacteroids MLS genes is different from that found in Gram-positive organisms.
TI  - The activity of enoxacin against clinical bacterial isolates in comparison with that of five other agents, and factors affecting that activity.
AB  - The activity of enoxacin against 362 clinical bacterial isolates in comparison with norfloxacin, nalidixic acid, ampicillin, latamoxef (moxalactam) and gentamicin was tested by an agar dilution method. Typical MICs for enterobacteria lay between 0.12 and 1.0 mg/l. Enterobacter spp. and Serratia spp. tended to be more resistant. Enoxacin was also active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (mean MIC 0.5 mg/l) and highly active against fastidious Gram-negative aerobes. Typical MICs for Staphylococcus aureus were 1-2 mg/l while streptococci were more resistant (16-32 mg/l). Enoxacin had no useful activity against Bacteroides fragilis and Clostridium perfringens. Enoxacin was generally more active at pH 8 than pH 6, and in broth than in urine. It was bactericidal in its action. Daily serial passage from growth in broth containing enoxacin caused decreased sensitivity which was limited to four- to 16-fold greater than the original MIC. Enoxacin was about half as active as norfloxacin against enterobacteria, equally active against staphylococci, and some two to four times less active against streptococci.
TI  - Mechanism of action of the new orally active cephalosporin FK027.
AB  - The mechanism of action of a new orally active cephalosporin, FK027, was compared to that of cephalexin and cefaclor to elucidate its excellent antibacterial activity against Gram-negative bacteria. FK027 showed very high affinity for the penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) 3, 1a and 1bs of Escherichia coli whereas cephalexin showed fairly high affinity for PBPs 1a, 4 and 3. The ability of FK027 to penetrate the outer membranes of E. coli and Enterobacter cloacae was less than that of cephalexin and cefaclor. However, FK027 was extremely stable to both plasmid-mediated penicillinases and chromosomal beta-lactamases except the Bacteroides fragilis enzyme and its stability was superior to that of cephalexin and cefaclor. These results indicate that the potent antibacterial activity of FK027 is based on its enhanced affinity for the target enzymes and its high stability to beta-lactamases.
TI  - Synergistic effect of bacteroides, Clostridium, Fusobacterium, anaerobic cocci, and aerobic bacteria on mortality and induction of subcutaneous abscesses in mice.
AB  - The potential for synergy between aerobic, facultative, and anaerobic bacteria was studied by subcutaneous inoculation of mixtures of these organisms into mice and observation of subsequent mortality and abscess formation. The anaerobic bacteria tested included 12 strains of gram-positive cocci and two strains each of Bacteroides species, Clostridium species, and Fusobacterium species. The facultative and aerobic bacteria included one strain each of Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis. Mortality increased significantly when each aerobic organism was inoculated along with either of the Bacteroides species. A similar increase occurred when the anaerobic gram-positive cocci were inoculated along with P. aeruginosa (four of six combinations) or S. aureus (four of six). The rate of abscess induction increased significantly when 10 of the 12 strains of anaerobic gram-positive cocci were injected along with B. fragilis and when nine of these strains were inoculated along with Bacteroides asaccharolyticus . The results demonstrate synergistic potential between Bacteroides species and all aerobic bacteria tested, between Bacteroides species and most anaerobic gram-positive cocci, and between most anaerobic gram-positive cocci and P. aeruginosa or S. aureus.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of amniotic fluid in South Indian women.
AB  - Samples of amniotic fluid obtained from 48 South Indian women in the third trimester of pregnancy were studied for antimicrobial activity. The growth of Staphylococcus albus, Candida albicans and Clostridium perfringens was inhibited by nearly all samples studied while the growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Bacteroides fragilis was inhibited by 50%, 42% and 18% of samples respectively. The growth of Streptococcus faecalis was not inhibited. Using radial immunodiffusion, IgG was measurable in all 10 samples studied (mean 23 mg/dl), whereas IgA was measurable in only three of these samples (mean 1.32 mg/dl). However, while specific IgA against C. albicans was detected by indirect immunofluorescence in 93% of samples, specific IgG against C. albicans was detected in only 26% of samples (P less than 0.001). Amniotic fluid obtained from parous women had greater inhibitory activity against E. coli (P less than 0.05) than did the amniotic fluid obtained from nulliparae.
TI  - Interaction of cefotaxime and desacetylcefotaxime against pathogenic bacteria. Assessment with the serum bactericidal test.
AB  - Cefotaxime (CTX), a third-generation cephalosporin with high potency against virtually all Enterobacteriaceae as well as many other clinically important facultative and anaerobic bacteria, is metabolized in vivo to desacetylcefotaxime (des-CTX), which also has intrinsic antibacterial activity, albeit less than the parent compound. To assess the possible additive or synergistic interaction of CTX and its main metabolite, we used a micromethod to measure serum bactericidal activity in samples containing CTX with and without des-CTX. Forty subject samples with 0.8-55.8 micrograms/ml of CTX and 1.1-11.6 micrograms/ml of des-CTX and matched simulated serum samples with 0.8-57.2 micrograms/ml were tested against clinical strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Bacteroides fragilis. Both sets of sera were reproducibly bactericidal with titers of less than 2-32 against S. aureus, 16-greater than or equal to 2048 against E. coli, and less than 2-64 against B. fragilis. Serum bactericidal titers against B. fragilis were higher in 10 of 23 (43%) subject samples in which concentrations of the desacetyl metabolite exceeded 50% of those of CTX when compared with matched simulated samples containing CTX alone in equivalent concentrations. This effect was not observed with samples tested against S. aureus or E. coli. The ultimate clinical importance of any in vitro interaction between CTX and its desacetyl metabolite, however, can likely only be determined by controlled clinical trials.
TI  - The activity of cefotaxime and desacetylcefotaxime alone and in combination against anaerobes and staphylococci.
AB  - Cefotaxime (CTX) and desacetylcefotaxime (des-CTX) alone and in combination were  tested against anaerobic bacteria collected from clinical infections from several geographically diverse medical centers. The CTX minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) inhibiting 50% of tested Bacteroides fragilis strains was in the moderately susceptible range (32 micrograms/ml), but when placed in combination with des-CTX it had a potency compatible to cefoxitin (MIC50, 8.0 micrograms/ml). Other B. fragilis group species (B. distasonis and B. vulgatus) were also susceptible to CTX and des-CTX alone at the MIC50 level. MIC90 statistics for CTX, cefoxitin, and ticarcillin were generally in the resistant range. Synergy studies showed that 80% of tested anaerobes were synergistically killed by the combination of CTX and des-CTX. Most of these strains had their synergy occur at drug levels that could be achieved in vivo. A large number of the B. thetaiotaomicron strains must be considered resistant to the combination because of the very high levels of des-CTX required to produce synergistic killing. Other drugs routinely used for anaerobic infections (clindamycin, chloramphenicol, and metronidazole) also had elevated B. thetaiotaomicron MICs. Endemic difference in susceptibility to the beta-lactam drugs were observed, especially the CTX-des-CTX combination. The combination and other beta-lactams were most usable for strains isolated from the Portland metropolitan area, were moderately active against those from Cleveland, and were rarely usable on Bacteroides isolates at Northwestern in Chicago. Laboratories are urged to monitor the cephalosporin and semisynthetic penicillin in vitro efficacy and not rely on published statistics. Staphylococcus aureus strains were susceptible to CTX alone, but were even more susceptible (two- to fourfold reduction in MICs) when used in combination with des-CTX. These data show CTX to be the most active antistaphylococcal compound among the new cephalosporins and to be comparable to cefamandole and cefuroxime, but superior to the anaerobe-active cefoxitin.
TI  - The in vitro antimicrobial activity of desacetylcefotaxime compared to other related beta-lactams.
AB  - Like all other cephalosporins that contain an acetyl side chain in the 3' position, cefotaxime (CTX) is partially desacetylated in vivo. Desacetylcefotaxime (des-CTX) possesses a broad antimicrobial spectrum and high beta-lactamase stability. With the exception of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Morganella morganii, Bacteroides fragilis, and Staphylococcus aureus, most strains of other species tested usually had mean MICs of des-CTX lower than 1 microgram/ml. Its activity is generally lower than that of the parent compound. It was only against some strains of P. cepacia that des-CTX surpassed the activity of CTX. The activity of des-CTX markedly exceeds the activity of many therapeutically used cephalosporins. This is especially true for Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis, most species of Enterobacteriaceae, and streptococci other than Streptococcus faecalis.
TI  - beta-Lactamase-producing bacteria recovered after clinical failures with various  penicillin therapy.
AB  - The presence of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria in clinical specimens was investigated in 185 children with orofacial or respiratory tract infections. All of these patients failed to respond to antimicrobial therapy, including penicillins, that was administered to 148 (80%) of them. beta-Lactamase-producing aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were detected in 75 (40.5%) of the 185 children. The beta-lactamase-producing strains included all 11 strains of the Bacteroides fragilis group, 30 (45.4%) of the 66 strains of Bacteroides melaninogenicus group, five (41.7%) of the 12 strains of Bacteroides oralis, and 41 (97.6%) of 42 strains of Staphylococcus aureus. All beta-lactamase-producing Bacteroides strains were resistant to penicillin as compared with the non-beta-lactamase-producing strains. Clinical cure was achieved after surgical drainage and a change in antimicrobial therapy in most of the patients. In treatment of orofacial and respiratory tract infections, the clinician should consider the presence of beta-lactamase-producing Bacteroides sp and S aureus as a possible cause of clinical failure with various penicillin therapies.
TI  - Significance of encapsulated Bacteroides melaninogenicus and Bacteroides fragilis groups in mixed infections.
AB  - Organisms of the Bacteroides melaninogenicus and Bacteroides fragilis groups are  often found mixed with facultatively anaerobic organisms in infections. The relative importance of these Bacteroides groups and facultative anaerobic pathogens in mixed infections was investigated in a subcutaneous abscess model in mice. This was determined by observing the effect of antimicrobial therapy directed against one or both organisms present in the abscess. Clindamycin or metronidazole was used for treatment of infections caused by Bacteroides species, and either gentamicin, penicillin, ampicillin, or oxacillin was used for treatment of infections caused by facultative flora. In almost all instances the aerobic counterparts in the infection were more important than the unencapsulated Bacteroides species. On the other hand, encapsulated B. melaninogenicus group organisms were found to be more important in abscess formation than were group A streptococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Staphylococcus aureus. Encapsulated B. fragilis group organisms were found to be more important than or as important as Escherichia coli and group D streptococci and less important than S. aureus, group A streptococci, and K. pneumoniae in induction of subcutaneous abscesses. This study demonstrates that encapsulated Bacteroides species are a factor that should be considered in the treatment of mixed infections with antibiotics.
TI  - In-vitro activity of enoxacin (CL-919), a new quinoline derivative, compared with that of other antimicrobial agents.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of enoxacin (CI-919), a new synthetic quinoline derivative  was compared with that of three other quinolines ofloxacin, norfloxacin and nalidixic acid. In addition beta-lactams and gentamicin were also included when appropriate. The MICs of enoxacin for 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter spp., Proteus spp., Providencia stuartii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus were less than 4 mg/l, for Haemophilus influenzae less than 0.25 mg/l and Neisseria gonorrhoeae less than 0.03 mg/l. Bacteroides fragilis and streptococci (including Streptococcus pneumoniae) were less susceptible, MIC90 16 mg/l. Against many of the common Enterobacteriaceae enoxacin displayed a similar degree of activity as gentamicin. Gentamicin-resistant strains of common bacterial pathogens were susceptible to enoxacin as were methicillin-resistant Staph. aureus. The protein binding of enoxacin (concentration 5 mg/l) was 18%.
TI  - Ceftizoxime: a beta-lactamase-stable, broad-spectrum cephalosporin. Pharmacokinetics, adverse effects and clinical use.
AB  - Ceftizoxime is an iminomethoxy aminothiazolyl cephalosporin that inhibits a wide  variety of aerobic, anaerobic gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. The majority of Enterobacteriaceae are inhibited by less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml as are streptococcal species with the exception of Streptococcus faecalis. Staphylococcus aureus are inhibited by 3-8 micrograms/ml, while methicillin-resistant. aureus are resistant. Bacteroides fragilis are inhibited by 16-64 micrograms/ml. It inhibits Pseudomonas aeruginosa at usually achievable concentrations. Ceftizoxime is overall similar in antibacterial activity to cefotaxime and moxalactam. Ceftizoxime is not hydrolyzed by common plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases. Serum levels of ceftizoxime after intramuscular and intravenous injection are similar to those of cefotaxime and moxalactam. The half-life is 1.6 to 1.9 hours in normal individuals. The compound is not metabolized and is cleared from the body by glomerular filtration. Ceftizoxime enters most body fluids, including the cerebrospinal fluid, to produce therapeutic concentrations against clinically important bacteria. Ceftizoxime accumulates in the presence of renal failure, but it is removed from the body by hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. Ceftizoxime has proved to be an effective chemotherapeutic agent when used as treatment for pneumonia, urinary tract infections, osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, meningitis, peritonitis, gonorrhea, including penicillinase-producing isolates, and gynecological infections. No major adverse reactions have been associated with the use of ceftizoxime and it has produced neither disulfram -like reactions nor bleeding.
TI  - Ciprofloxacin, a quinolone carboxylic acid compound active against aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activity of ciprofloxacin, a quinolone-carboxylic acid derivative, was compared with those of norfloxacin, cefotaxime, cephalexin, ceftazidime, moxalactam, amoxicillin, and methicillin and other agents, as appropriate. The MICs of ciprofloxacin for 90% of members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Neisseria spp., and Bacteroides fragilis were between 0.005 and 0.8 micrograms/ml, whereas streptococci and staphylococci were all inhibited by less than or equal to 6.3 micrograms/ml. Ciprofloxacin was 4- to 32-fold more active than norfloxacin and inhibited gentamicin-, ameikacin-, cefotaxime-, and moxalactam-resistant members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. The activity of ciprofloxacin was not affected by serum but decreased in the presence of acid urine. The frequency of resistance to ciprofloxacin was between 10(-7) and 10(-9).
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial activity of clindamycin analogues: pirlimycin, 1,2 a  potent antibacterial agent.
AB  - The preparation of a series of analogues of clindamycin is described in which the naturally occurring five-membered cyclic amino acid amide portion of the molecule is replaced by a four-, six-, or seven-membered cyclic amino acid amide. The most interesting compound is pirlimycin (7e, U-57,930E), in which the (2S-trans)-4-n-propylhygramide portion of clindamycin is replaced by (2S-cis)-4-ethylpipecolamide. This structural modification results in significantly favorable changes in toxicity, metabolism, and antibacterial potency. Although the in vitro antibacterial activity of clindamycin and pirlimycin are nearly identical, the latter compound is 2-20 times more active than clindamycin when administered to mice experimentally infected with strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Bacteroides fragilis, and Plasmodium berghei. Pirlimycin is absorbed in rats and mice following both subcutaneous and oral administration. It readily penetrates B. fragilis induced abscesses in mice and is sequestered within these abscesses. A drug concentration of at least 60 times the required inhibitory concentration is maintained for 6 h following a single subcutaneous dose of 200 mg/kg. Urinary excretion of total bioactivity consists only of intact pirlimycin with no other antibacterially active metabolites being detected. Pirlimycin is tolerated well in rats and mice at the administered levels.
TI  - Clavulanic acid in combination with ticarcillin: an in-vitro comparison with other beta-lactams.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of ticarcillin in combination with clavulanic acid was compared with that of ticarcillin alone, piperacillin, cefotaxime and, where appropriate, other beta-lactams against a total of 301 recent clinical isolates and characterized beta-lactamase producers. An agar dilution procedure was used to determine MICs and two inocula (10(4) and 10(6) cfu) were used throughout. MICs of the combination of ticarcillin and clavulanic acid were expressed as MICs of ticarcillin in the presence of 5 or 10 mg/l of clavulanic acid. Against most members of the Enterobacteriaceae (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia stuartii and Serratia marcescens), ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid was as active as or more active than piperacillin. Against Staphylococcus aureus. Haemophilus influenzae and the Bacteroides fragilis group the combination was considerably more active than piperacillin. Piperacillin was more active than the ticarcillin/clavulanic acid combination against Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - Evaluation of three 4"-deoxy-4"-sulfonamido-oleandomycin derivatives with erythromycin-like antibacterial potency.
AB  - Three derivatives of oleandomycin in which the C"-4 hydroxyl moiety was replaced  for the first time with a nitrogen functionality have been compared with erythromycin base and oleandomycin base. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of these derivatives for 90% of a group of clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus were one-half to one-fourth those of erythromycin. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of the experimental macrolides for 50% of a group of S. aureus isolates resistant to greater than 12.5 micrograms of erythromycin per ml ranged from 0.2 to 0.39 micrograms/ml. The activities of these experimental compounds were equivalent to the activities of erythromycin against Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacteroides fragilis, and Haemophilus influenzae isolates. In general, erythromycin was more active against Streptococcus species. Each experimental macrolide was superior to erythromycin in inhibiting RNA-directed, cell-free polypeptide synthesis. The three experimental compounds were markedly more active than erythromycin base after oral administration to mice infected with S. aureus. The 50% protective doses of the experimental compounds ranged from 27.4 to 45.7 mg/kg; that of erythromycin was approximately 100 mg/kg.
TI  - Clindamycin and its action on the susceptibility of pathogenic bacteria to phagocytosis.
AB  - The role of various surface virulence factors in bacterial resistance to opsonophagocytosis has been investigated in relation to the effect of clindamycin at concentrations below those which inhibit growth (sub-MIC). In each case studied (Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacteroides fragilis) contact with the drug under these conditions potentiated complement-mediated opsonization of the bacterial cells resulting in a greater and more rapid deposition of C3 as C3b on the cell surface. Several other features of the phagocytic process were enhanced in consequence.
TI  - Ceftazidime: in vitro comparison with cephalothin, cefuroxime, and netilmicin. A  Norwegian study.
AB  - The in vitro activity of ceftazidime has been compared with those of cephalothin, cefuroxime, and netilmicin against a variety of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria in order to register sensitivity patterns in the western part of Norway. An agar dilution method was used for minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) determination. Ceftazidime was the most active agent against Enterobacteriaceae; all isolates being inhibited by 2 mg/l or less, whereas netilmicin was slightly less active, especially against Providencia. Cephalothin and cefuroxime were markedly less active than the other two agents against Enterobacteriaceae. Ceftazidime and netilmicin were active against our Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates (MICs less than or equal to 4 and less than or equal to 8 mg/l, respectively). Only netilmicin had useful activity against Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. Ceftazidime was the least active agent against Staphylococcus aureus; nearly all the isolates had MICs of 4-8 mg/l. Cefuroxime was the most active agent against Bacteroides fragilis, whereas ceftazidime was inactive. Ceftazidime may, in the future, be a useful alternative to the aminoglycosides in the treatment of serious gram-negative infections, particularly when P. aeruginosa might be involved.
TI  - Review of cefonicid, a long-acting cephalosporin.
AB  - The in vitro activity, pharmacokinetics, adverse effects, and clinical efficacy of cefonicid are reviewed. Also discussed are formulary considerations and bacterial resistance. Cefonicid, an investigational agent near approval, is less active than other currently available first- and second-generation cephalosporins against gram-positive cocci, particularly Staphylococcus. Cefonicid and cefamandole have similar activity that is superior to the first-generation cephalosporins against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Citrobacter spp., Enterobacter spp., indole-negative Proteus spp., and Providencia spp. Organisms such as Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas, and Bacteroides fragilis are resistant to cefonicid. Despite a small volume of distribution and high protein binding, cefonicid achieves high tissue concentrations. Approximately 90% of an administered dose is excreted unchanged in the urine, and the elimination half-life is approximately four hours. Cefonicid is usually well tolerated. In treating skin infections, cefonicid was usually less effective than cefazolin against Staphylococcus aureus. In genitourinary infections, cefonicid 1 g daily (as the sodium salt) in a single dose has shown comparable efficacy to cefamandole or amoxicillin given in multiple daily doses. Based on available data, single daily dosing of cefonicid in the therapy of Staph. aureus endocarditis is not effective. In studies of patients undergoing hysterectomy, cesarean section, cholecystectomy, and colorectal surgery, cefonicid 1 g given as a single preoperative dose has produced results comparable with those of cefoxitin 1-2 g (as the sodium salt) given preoperatively and for several doses postoperatively. The major clinical uses of cefonicid will probably be as a possible cost-reducing alternative (based on a single daily dose) to currently available first- and second-generation cephalosporins for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia and infections caused by enteric organisms. It may also be useful as a possible cost-reducing alternative to cefoxitin for prophylaxis in hysterectomy and biliary tract surgery.
TI  - [Chronological variations in blood isolates and their susceptibility to various antibiotics].
AB  - Chronological variation in blood isolates obtained from 1968 to 1982 was studied. Escherichia coli was the most frequent isolates followed by Klebsiella species, glucose-non-fermentative Gram-negative rods (excluding Pseudomonas aeruginosa), Enterobacter-Serratia group, and Staphylococcus aureus. The isolation of glucose-non-fermentative Gram-negative rods, about half of which being Achromobacter xylosoxidans, increased greatly in number from 1980. A total of 113 strains of blood isolates was examined for susceptibility to various antibiotics. Although there was a significant increase in S. aureus resistant to GM, these strains were susceptible to cephalosporins. In the 9 strains of GM-resistant aerobic Gram-negative rods (2 strains of Klebsiella, 2 strains of Enterobacter, 4 strains of Serratia and 1 strain of P. aeruginosa), 3 strains of Serratia species were also resistant to AMK. Two strains of LCM-resistant Bacteroides fragilis were susceptible to LMOX, but 1 strain was not inhibited by 100 micrograms/ml of CFX. Among the clinical specimens, differences were found in the rate of isolation of resistant strains, particularly in the case of Serratia and P. aeruginosa. Antibiotic resistant strains were isolated more frequently from urine and the least frequently from sputum. Since the frequency of isolation of resistant strains varied according to organism, clinical material and year of isolation, microbiological laboratories should develop their own data base from which clinicians can make rational therapeutic decisions.
TI  - Interactions of Bacteroides fragilis and phagocytes: studies with whole organisms, purified capsular polysaccharide and clindamycin-treated bacteria.
AB  - Bacteroides fragilis plays a key role in the pathogenesis of anaerobic infections and is often found mixed with aerobic organisms. We explored the interactions of this organism with phagocytes in an attempt to discern additional information about its virulence factors. We confirm an earlier report that killing of aerobic organisms by polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) is decreased in the presence of high numbers of Bact. fragilis but this effect could also be demonstrated with Bact. distasonis or Staphylococcus aureus. Our data support the concept that this phenomenon may be due to competition for opsonins. Virulence of Bact. fragilis has been associated with a polysaccharide capsule. We were unable to demonstrate any deleterious effect of the purified capsular polysaccharide of Bact. fragilis on phagocytosis, killing, or chemotaxis by PMN. We were not able to demonstrate any effect of subinhibitory levels of clindamycin on the interactions of neutrophils and Bact. fragilis.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity and beta-lactamase stability of E-0702, a new cephalosporin.
AB  - The in vitro activity of E-0702 was compared with the in vitro activity of cefotaxime, ceftazidime, moxalactam, and aztreonam against 600 gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic isolates. E-0702 had a minimal inhibitory concentration for 50% of isolates (MIC50) of 25 micrograms for Staphylococcus aureus, 50 micrograms for Staphylococcus epidermidis, and 1.6 to 3.1 micrograms for streptococci, with Streptococcus faecalis resistant. E-0702 had MIC50s against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterobacter aerogenes comparable to those of cefotaxime, ceftazidime, moxalactam, and aztreonam, but MIC90S were higher than those of the other agents. It was as active as the other agents against Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella spp., and Shigella spp., but was four- to eightfold less active against Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Providencia spp., Morganella spp., and Proteus vulgaris, with isolates in each species resistant. Activity against Bacteroides fragilis was fourfold less than that of cefoxitin. E-0702 was hydrolyzed by plasmid beta-lactamases and was only a weak inhibitor of plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases. There was an inoculum effect for E. cloacae, Serratia spp., Morganella spp., and Pseudomonas spp.
TI  - Third-generation and investigational cephalosporins: II. Microbiologic review and clinical summaries.
AB  - In vitro susceptibility of Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, Hemophilus influenzae, Bacteroides fragilis, and Neisseria gonorrhea to three new second-generation and eight third-generation cephalosporins is tabulated. In general, the newer cephalosporins have an extended spectrum of activity against gram-negative bacteria, including Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Neisseria gonorrhea. They also tend to be active against anaerobes, including Bacteroides fragilis. However, they generally have less activity against gram-positive bacteria when compared with the first- and second-generation cephalosporins. Clinical summaries are given for each of the cephalosporins, with emphasis on the results of comparative clinical trials. These cephalosporins may prove especially useful in nosocomial infections with resistant organisms, intraabdominal infections, febrile episodes in the granulocytopenic patient, and meningitis.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of cefodizime, an aminothiazolyl iminomethoxy cephalosporin.
AB  - Cefodizime, an iminomethoxy aminothiazolyl cephalosporin similar to moxalactam and ceftazidime, was less active (minimal inhibitory concentration, 1.6 to 12 micrograms) than cefazolin or cefotaxime against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. It inhibited Haemophilus and Neisseria spp. at less than 0.5 microgram/ml. It did not inhibit methicillin-resistant staphylococci, enterococci, or Listeria spp. and was 8- to 32-fold less active than cefotaxime, moxalactam, or ceftazidime against Escherichia coli, Citrobacter spp., Klebsiella pneumoniae, Providencia spp., and Serratia spp. Cefotaxime-resistant Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, and Proteus vulgaris were resistant to cefodizime. Cefodizime was less active than cefoxitin or moxalactam against Bacteroides fragilis. Cefodizime was not hydrolyzed by common plasmid or chromosomal beta-lactamases, and it inhibited type I beta-lactamases.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of fosfomycin in vitro.
AB  - Fosfomycin is a new bactericidal broad-spectrum antibiotic. In this study the minimum inhibiting concentration (MIC) was determined for 745 recent clinical isolates. Staphylococcus aureus and epidermidis, group A and B streptococci Streptococcus faecalis and pneumoniae as well as Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens and Haemophilus influenzae were very sensitive to the new drug with essentially all strains inhibited at 64 mg/l or less. Klebsiella, Enterobacter, indole-positive proteus and Pseudomonas-aeruginosa were less sensitive with 96, 42, 66 and 58% inhibited at 64 mg/l of fosfomycin. Bacteroides fragilis was resistant.
TI  - N-formimidoyl thienamycin: in vitro comparison with cefoxitin and tobramycin against clinical, bacterial isolates.
AB  - The in vitro activity of the novel beta-lactam antibiotic, N-formimidoyl thienamycin (N-f thienamycin) has been compared with those of cefoxitin and tobramycin. An agar dilution method was employed. N-f thienamycin was active against all Enterobacteriaceae isolates (MIC less than or equal to 4 mg/l). All Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were inhibited by 2 mg/l. N-f thienamycin was also active against Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (96 per cent inhibited by 0.5 mg/l) and Gram-positive cocci. All enterococci were inhibited by 2 mg/l. The drug was active against Haemophilus influenzae (MIC less than or equal to 1 mg/l) and the Bacteroides fragilis group (MIC less than or equal to 0.5 mg/l). Cefoxitin was inactive against most Enterobacter and A. calcoaceticus isolates and all P. aeruginosa and enterococcal isolates. Tobramycin was virtually inactive against Gram-positive cocci other than Staphylococcus aureus. N-f thienamycin thus has a broad spectrum of in vitro activity, greater than that of cefoxitin and tobramycin, and may therefore be useful in the treatment of serious infection, particularly when the aetiology is unknown.
TI  - In vitro activity of Bay 09867, a new quinoline derivative, compared with those of other antimicrobial agents.
AB  - The in vitro activity of Bay 09867, a new quinoline derivative, was compared with those of norfloxacin, nalidixic acid, ceftazidime, cefaclor, cefuroxime, gentamicin, and other antimicrobial agents, when appropriate, against 410 recent clinical isolates. The minimal inhibitory concentrations of Bay 09867 for 90% of Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, streptococci, Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacteroides fragilis strains were between 0.008 and 2 micrograms/ml. Bay 09867 was considerably more active against the gram-negative bacteria tested than were other agents tested. Gentamicin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, P. aeruginosa, and methicillin-resistant S. aureus were highly susceptible to Bay 09867. Strains less susceptible to nalidixic acid and norfloxacin tended to be less susceptible to Bay 09867. The protein binding of Bay 09867 was about 20%.
TI  - The frequency and some characteristics of anaerobic bacteria isolated from various forms of bovine mastitis.
AB  - The prevalence of strictly anaerobic bacteria in the secretions from untreated cases of mastitis in lactating dairy cows was investigated. The study involved 147 Friesland cows in 12 highveld herds. All herds yielded cows with anaerobic udder infections. No anaerobic bacteria were recovered from cows with normal quarters or those with latent aerobic infections. Only anaerobes were present in 10% of so-called 'aseptic' mastitis cases. A variety of anaerobic organisms was isolated concurrently with facultative bacteria from 5,3% and 58,8% of cases classified as subclinical and clinical respectively. Peptococcus spp. was associated with Corynebacterium pyogenes and Bacteroides spp. with Staphylococcus aureus and/or Streptococcus agalactiae in 80% anaerobic udder infections. Gram positive anaerobic species were mostly sensitive to penicillin-G but all the Gram negative rods were resistant. In addition, all B. fragilis strains produced beta-lactamase. The ability to produce heparinase was demonstrated in one strain of Peptococcus indolicus and a Peptostreptococcus sp.
TI  - Cefoperazone: a review of its antimicrobial spectrum, beta-lactamase stability, enzyme inhibition, and other in vitro characteristics.
AB  - The in vitro qualities of cefoperazone were reviewed on the basis of international medical literature and some new observations. Cefoperazone is highly active against the Enterobacteriaceae. Its activity against Staphylococcus aureus is comparable to that of the other newer cephem antibiotics. Cefoperazone is also active against all beta-hemolytic streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae and is relatively inactive against methicillin-resistant S. aureus and enterococci. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa cefoperazone is at least fourfold more active than cefotaxime or moxalactam and is approximately as active as azlocillin or piperacillin. Haemophilus and Neisseria species, regardless of beta-lactamase production, are highly susceptible to cefoperazone. Against the Bacteroides fragilis group, cefoperazone is either very active or quite inactive because of endemic variations. The drug is slightly less stable to some beta-lactamases than are cefotaxime-like or 7-methoxy cephem drugs. Cefoperazone is a bactericidal beta-lactam, and its minimal inhibitory concentrations are influenced only by high inoculum concentrations of beta-lactamase-producing strains. Its ability to permeate bacterial cell membranes appears similar to that of cefotaxime. Synergy studies with cefoperazone plus beta-lactamase inhibitors or aminoglycosides against Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa show enhanced killing. Cefoperazone is 70%-94% protein bound and has high affinities for bacterial penicillin-binding proteins 3, 1a, 2, and 1 bs.
TI  - Transtracheal aspiration in pulmonary infection in children with cystic fibrosis.
AB  - Six transtracheal aspirations (TTA) and expectorated sputum specimens were collected from four children suffering from cystic fibrosis who had pulmonary infection. Specimens obtained from both sites were cultured for aerobic bacteria and TTA aspirates were also cultured for anaerobes. Differences in bacteria isolated in TTA and sputum aspirates were present in all instances. Six isolates were recovered in both sites (three Pseudomonas aeruginosa, two Staphylococcus aureus and one Aspergillus flavus). Five aerobic isolates were recovered only in the expectorated sputum and not in TTA aspirations (two Klebsiella pneumoniae and one each of P. aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis). Nine organisms were isolated only from the TTA (two each of Veillonella parvula and Alpha hemolytic streptococci, and one each of Bacteroides fragilis, B. melaninogenicus, Lactobacillus sp., Haemophilus influenzae and Gamma hemolytic streptococci). The recovery of anaerobic organisms from four of the six TTA specimens suggests a possible role for these organisms in the etiology of pulmonary infection in cystic fibrosis. We found TTA to be helpful in the bacterial diagnosis and management of pulmonary infections in cystic fibrosis.
TI  - In-vitro antibacterial activity of cefotetan.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of cefotetan, a recently developed cephamycin, was investigated under various experimental conditions. The compound showed moderate activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes, no activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Streptococcus faecalis, but a high activity against Enterobacteriaceae, including beta-lactamase-producing strains. Haemophilus influenzae also was fairly susceptible. The MBC was usually equal to or two- or fourfold higher than MIC. Medium composition, pH and inoculum size had minimal influence on its activity. About 50% of recent clinical isolates of Bacteroides fragilis were susceptible to cefotetan, but some were highly resistant. Killing curves of cefotetan against different bacterial strains indicated that it was rapidly bactericidal at concentrations equal to MIC or two- to fourfold higher. However, some strains showed regrowth after initial inhibition. Combination of cefotetan with aminoglycosides, or with cefazolin, cefotaxime, moxalactam or piperacillin resulted either in synergy, addition or indifference according to the bacterial strain and the nature of the combination. Antagonism was never observed. Human serum protein binding varied from 75 to 86% according to the assay method. Binding with horse serum protein was about 28%.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of the cephamycin cefotetan: an in-vitro comparison with other beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  - The cephamycin, cefotetan, was compared with other beta-lactam antibiotics including the monocyclic beta-lactam, azthreonam, against a total of 277 recent clinical isolates. Cefotetan had activity comparable to moxalactam against Staphylococcus aureus and against the Enterobacteriaceae, inhibiting all isolates except for Serratia marcescens and Enterobacter spp. at less than or equal to 0.5 mg/l. Cefotetan was active against beta-lactamase producing and non-beta-lactamase producing Haemophilus influenzae (MIC90 1 mg/l); was inactive against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90 greater than 128 mg/l); and was eightfold less active than cefoxitin against the Bacteroides fragilis group. Azthreonam was as active as moxalactam against the Enterobacteriaceae and was more active than moxalactam against Ps. aeruginosa, inhibiting 90% of isolates at less than or equal to 8 mg/l, but was inactive against the Bact. fragilis group (MIC90 greater than 128 mg/l) and against Staphylococcus aureus (MIC90 greater than 128 mg/l).
TI  - In vitro activity of ceftazidime and ceftriaxone.
AB  - The in vitro susceptibility of 230 clinical isolates, including 55 anaerobic bacteria, was tested with ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, cefoperazone, moxalactam, cefamandole, cefoxitin, and ticarcillin. Ceftazidime was the most active drug against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter sp. Against Enterobacteriaceae, ceftazidime and ceftriaxone were similar to cefotaxime, moxalactam, and cefoperazone and more active than cefamandole, cefoxitin, and ticarcillin. Cefoxitin and moxalactam were significantly more active against Bacteroides fragilis than were the other beta-lactam drugs. Against Staphylococcus aureus, ceftriaxone showed moderate activity, while ceftazidime was relatively inactive. These results indicate a potential role for ceftazidime and ceftriaxone against infections involving facultative and aerobic gram-negative bacilli.
TI  - Cefotetan: antimicrobial activity in-vitro compared with that of cefotaxime.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of cefotetan and cefotaxime were compared in vitro against 547 strains of aerobes and 24 strains of Bacteroides fragilis. The strains were recent clinical isolates from 20 hospitals. Cefotetan was found to exhibit an activity two- to fourfold lower than that of cefotaxime against most of the enterobacteriaceae. About half the number of Enterobacter aerogenes and Enterobacter cloacae strains resistant to cefotetan were resistant also to cefotaxime. Cefotetan was more active than cefotaxime against most of the strains of Proteus vulgaris. In contrast to cefotaxime which was moderately active, cefotetan was inactive against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Cefotetan had limited activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis was resistant to both cefotetan and cefotaxime. Bact. fragilis was inhibited more effectively by cefotetan than by cefotaxime. Depending on the species tested, the activity of cefotetan was influenced significantly by the inoculum size in some cases. Different test media did not affect the results.
TI  - Cefotetan, a new cephamycin: comparison of in vitro antimicrobial activity with other cephems, beta-lactamase stability, and preliminary recommendations for disk diffusion testing.
AB  - Cefotetan is a new, potent, 7 alpha-methoxy cephalosporin (cephamycin). The in vitro activity of cefotetan tested in a multiphasic, collaborative study against 12,260 consecutive clinical isolates and 448 selected isolates showed 93% of Enterobacteriaceae, 90% of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (broth dilution), 83% of Bacteroides fragilis, and 72% of non-enterococcal streptococci to be inhibited by less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml. Beta-Lactamase-producing and -nonproducing Haemophilus influenzae strains were inhibited by less than or equal to 1.0 micrograms/ml. Cefotetan's inhibitory spectrum paralleled those of the newest generation of cephems and exceeded those of cefoxitin and cefamandole. No useful activity was present against Streptococcus faecalis or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Cefotetan was bactericidal without significant inoculum effect and was highly resistant to hydrolysis by Richmond-Sykes types I, III, and IV beta-lactamases. Hydrolysis of the chromogenic cephalosporin PADAC (pyridine-2-azo-p-dimethylaniline cephalosporin) by type I beta-lactamases was markedly inhibited by concentrations of cefotetan similar to those of the potent inhibitor dicloxacillin. Analysis of agar disk diffusion for several disk potencies and broth dilution susceptibility tests by regression and error rate-bounding methods produced preliminary tentative zone standards (30-micrograms disk, using minimal inhibitory concentration breakpoints of less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml susceptible and greater than 32 micrograms/ml resistant, or 75-micrograms disk, using minimal inhibitory concentration breakpoints of less than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml susceptible and greater than or equal to 64 micrograms/ml resistant) of greater than or equal to 18 mm susceptible, less than or equal to 14 mm resistant, and 15 to 17 mm indeterminate. Staphylococcus aureus testing with the 30-micrograms disk is not recommended.
TI  - In vitro activity of azthreonam, a monobactam antibiotic.
AB  - We studied the activity of azthreonam (SQ 26,776), a novel monocyclic beta-lactam compound, against a variety of clinical isolates. It was more potent than moxalactam, cefoperazone, cefamandole, cefoxitin, ticarcillin, tobramycin, or amikacin against strains of Klebsiella spp., Serratia spp., and the Proteus group. It was highly effective against Escherichia coli and strains of Salmonella spp. The median minimal inhibitory concentration for all species of Enterobacteriaceae was less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml. Azthreonam was moderately active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, including tobramycin-resistant strains, and against Pseudomonas cepacia (median minimal inhibitory concentration, 16 to 32 micrograms/ml), but was weakly active against Pseudomonas maltophilia and strains of Acinetobacter spp. and Achromobacter spp. The drug showed little activity against Staphylococcus aureus, enterococci, and anaerobic bacteria, including Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium spp., and gram-positive cocci. Like moxalactam and cefoperazone, azthreonam exhibited a considerable inoculum effect with strains of Enterobacter spp. and Pseudomonas spp. Combination with clavulanic acid did not increase the activity of azthreonam against S. aureus but was synergistic for 5 of 15 strains of B. fragilis. Azthreonam is about 50% bound to human serum protein. The selective range of activity of this compound could be of clinical benefit.
TI  - Elective colon surgery: clindamycin versus metronidazole prophylaxis.
AB  - Orally administered clindamycin-neomycin as a prophylactic antibiotic in patients scheduled to undergo colon surgery was compared to orally administered metronidazole-neomycin. Clindamycin levels of the colon contents and the mucosa were 8 to 10 times higher than the serum levels. Three of the 43 patients who received metronidazole had wound infection whereas none of the 38 patients who received clindamycin did. Clindamycin may help to prevent staphylococcal infection, a known problem associated with metronidazole use. It may also play a role in preventing infection at the anastomosis in patients who undergo colon resection.
TI  - 6-Acetylmethylenepenicillanic acid (Ro 15-1903), a potent beta-lactamase inhibitor. II. Antibacterial properties.
AB  - The beta-lactamase inhibitor Ro 15-1903 showed low affinity for penicillin binding proteins (PBPs) of Escherichia coli. When used as a single compound, it displayed no substantial antibacterial activity but in combination with ampicillin, it was similar to clavulanic acid in conferring activity against ampicillin-resistant strains. Some synergy between Ro 15-1903 and piperacillin was found against high inocula of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Ro 15-1903 markedly enhanced the activity of ceftriaxone against Bacteroides fragilis. In keeping with the in vitro findings, the combination Ro 15-1903 and ampicillin protected mice against systemic infections with beta-lactamase-producing strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus sp. but not against those with Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, and E. coli producing either chromosomally mediated beta-lactamase of type I or plasmid-mediated beta-lactamase of type TEM.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo activity of DL-8280, a new oxazine derivative.
AB  - DL-8280, 9-fluoro-3-methyl-10-(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)-7-oxo-2,3-dihydro-7H- pyrido-(1,2,3-de)1,4-benzoxazine-6-carboxylic acid, is a new nalidixic acid analog with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity against gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, including obligate anaerobes. The activity of DL-8280 against Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Clostridium perfringens was roughly comparable to that of norfloxacin and far exceeded that of pipemidic acid and nalidixic acid. DL-8280 had greater activity against Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus spp., Pseudomonas maltophilia, Acinetobacter spp., and Bacteroides fragilis than did norfloxacin, pipemidic acid, and nalidixic acid. Nalidixic acid-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, ampicillin-resistant gonococci, and clindamycin-resistant obligate anaerobes were also susceptible to DL-8280. The activity of DL-8280 was affected very little by inoculum size, and its action was bactericidal at two times the minimal inhibitory concentrations at most. Administered orally to mice experimentally infected with Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens, or P. aeruginosa, DL-8280 was 2 to 7 times more effective than norfloxacin and 7 to more than 50 times more active than pipemidic acid.
TI  - Distribution of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid in infected animals and efficacy  against experimental infections.
AB  - The therapeutic effects produced by formulations of amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid (BRL 25 000A and BRL 25 000G) were compared with those of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid separately against a variety of infections produced by amoxicillin-susceptible and beta-lactamase-producing (amoxicillin-resistant) bacteria. The infection models studied included intraperitoneal infections, a mouse pneumonia, experimental pyelonephritis, and local lesions caused by Staphylococcus aureus and Bacteroides fragilis. The distribution of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid in infected animals after the administration of amoxicillin-clavulanic acid was evaluated by measurement of the concentrations of the substances present in specimens collected at the sites of infection. The results showed that both amoxicillin and clavulanic acid were well distributed in the animal body after the administration of amoxicillin-clavulanic acid formulations, being present in significant concentrations at various sites of infection, e.g., peritoneal washings, pleural fluid, pus, and infected tissue homogenates. In a number of cases, the amoxicillin concentrations measured after the administration of BRL 25000 were higher than those found after treatment with amoxicillin alone, presumably as a result of inhibition of bacterial beta-lactamases by clavulanic acid at the site of infection. The ability of clavulanic acid to protect amoxicillin in vivo was confirmed by the efficacy of amoxicillin-clavulanic acid formulations in the treatment of the infections studied, most of which were refractory to therapy with amoxicillin.
TI  - Ceftriaxone: in vitro activity against 410 bacterial isolates compared with cefotaxime.
AB  - The in vitro activity of the two new cephalosporins, cefotaxime and ceftriaxone,  against 410 bacterial isolates was compared using an agar dilution method. Both compounds were highly active against Enterobacteriaceae, including indole-positive Proteus and Providencia; the great majority of the isolates were inhibited by 0.06 mg/l of either drug. Activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus was moderate, and enterococci were resistant. All Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Haemophilus influenzae isolates were susceptible to 0.03 mg/l of either drug. The isolates belonging to the Bacteroides fragilis group were inhibited over a wide range of concentrations and some were highly resistant (MIC greater than or equal to 64 mg/l). There were no significant differences in the antibacterial activity of the two drugs against our isolates. Both drugs may be of potential use in the treatment of serious infections caused by Enterobacteriaceae; they may prove to be a useful alternative to the aminoglycosides.
TI  - The history and background of Augmentin.
AB  - Bacterial resistance to the beta-lactam group of antibiotics is frequently due to the production of beta-lactamase which brings about the inactivation of the antibiotic. Clavulanic acid is a naturally occurring inhibitor of beta-lactamase which is capable of rendering penicillin- and cephalosporin-resistant organisms sensitive. The compound is obtained by fermentation from Streptomyces clavuligerus. Clavulanic acid shows some structural similarity to the penicillins and cephalosporins and functions as a progressive inhibitor of a wide range of beta-lactamases including those found in Escherichia coli, Klebsiella aerogenes, Proteus species, Bacteroides fragilis, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Staphylococcus aureus. Clavulanic acid is well absorbed when given by mouth and a formulation with amoxycillin (Augmentin; Beechams) is now available for clinical use.
TI  - The aetiology of perirectal sepsis.
AB  - Organisms that are present in the normal faecal flora, especially Bacteroides fragilis, were isolated significantly more often from perirectal abscesses associated with a fistula. Other organisms similar to those associated with infection of obstructed apocrine glands at other sites were isolated from abscesses without fistulas. These findings suggest that perirectal abscesses with and without fistulas may have a different aetiology and that appropriate bacteriological investigation may give an indication of the presence of an unsuspected fistula and thus provide useful guidance to the correct surgical management of the patient. Staphylococcus aureus and other skin organisms were found less frequently than in previous studies on perirectal sepsis and were equally common in cases with or without a fistula-in-ano.
TI  - In vitro activity of cefotetan, a new cephamycin derivative, compared with that of other beta-lactam compounds.
AB  - The in vitro activity of cefotetan, a new cephamycin, was compared with the activities of cefoxitin, cefuroxime, moxalactam, ceftazidime, and piperacillin against 273 recent clinical isolates. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of cefotetan for 90% of Enterobacteriaceae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae were between 0.12 and 2 micrograms/ml; for 90% of Staphylococcus aureus, the minimum inhibitory concentration was 8 micrograms/ml, and for 90% of Bacteroides fragilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Lancefield group D streptococci it was 128 micrograms/ml or more. The activity of cefotetan against Enterobacteriaceae is comparable to the activities of ceftazidime and moxalactam and four to eight times greater than the activities of cefoxitin and cefuroxime. Cefotetan was approximately one-half as active as cefoxitin and cefuroxime against S. aureus. Although cefotetan was 87% bound to serum protein, serum had little effect on the in vitro antimicrobial activity of this agent.
TI  - Bacteremia in diabetic patients with infected lower extremities.
AB  - Eleven cases of bacteremia in diabetic patients with infected lower extremities at Rancho Los Amigos Hospital (RLAH) were observed over a 34-mo period. The yearly incidence was 0.6% of admissions to the Ortho-Diabetes service. Aerobic bacteria were recovered in six cases and anaerobic bacteria in five. Bacteroides fragilis was isolated four times, Staphylococcus aureus three times, and nonfragilis Bacteroides sp., Escherichia coli, group B streptococcus, and viridans streptococcus were each seen once. Ten of the 11 patients were febrile at the time of bacteremia. Clinical, laboratory, radiologic, and ultrasonographic parameters were comparable in patients with aerobic and anaerobic bacteremia, and between bacteremic patients and nonbacteremic controls. Fever, however, was significantly more frequent in bacteremic patients. Foul-smelling lesions were seen in two of the five patients with anaerobic bacteremia, and in none of the patients with aerobic bacteremia. Postoperative B. fragilis bacteremia was observed to be transient and resolved without definitive therapy in one patient. Appropriate antibiotic therapy in 10 patients together with surgical intervention in eight cases resulted in resolution of the infection in the remaining patients.
TI  - Efficacy of ceftriaxone in serious bacterial infections.
AB  - Ceftriaxone is a new semisynthetic cephalosporin with broad-spectrum in vitro activity and an unusually long serum half-life. The clinical efficacy of ceftriaxone was evaluated in 35 infections in 34 patients; 12 of these patients had skin and soft tissue infections, 10 had infections of the urinary tract, 8 had pneumonia, 2 had biliary tract infections, 1 had sinusitis, 1 had diverticulitis, and 1 had a retroperitoneal abscess. Of the 35 infections, 9 were bacteremic. The bacteria isolated included Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus faecalis, other streptococcal species, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacteroides fragilis, other Bacteroides species, and anaerobic cocci. Improvement or cure occurred in 32 episodes, for a response rate of 91%. There were three treatment failures in patients with soft tissue infections. No serious drug toxicities were observed. At a dosage regimen of 1 g every 12 h the peak and trough serum antibiotic concentrations were well above the minimal inhibitory concentrations of most pathogens. Our findings suggest that ceftriaxone is a safe and effective antibiotic for therapy of serious bacterial infections.
TI  - Obturator foramen grafts: the preferable alternate route?
AB  - Although the femoral canal is the standard entrance route for vascular grafts to  the lower extremity, several situations may arise that preclude the use of this route. In these circumstances an alternate pathway for revascularization is required. Experience in our center with the use of obturator foramen grafts for revascularization of nine limbs in eight patients is reported and underscores the value of this pathway as an alternative route for limb revascularization. The obturator foramen was employed to circumvent an infected arterial prosthesis at the groin level in seven patients (eight limbs) from 12 days to 4.5 years after the initial vascular procedure. The organisms responsible for graft infection included Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter cloacae, and Bacteroides fragilis. The final patient required iliac to superficial femoral artery bypass via the obturator foramen to manage occlusion and autolysis of the femoral artery by a mycotic embolus containing beta-hemolytic Streptococcus. Graft material used for these remedial procedures, included saphenous vein (three), Gore-Tex (three), and Dacron (three). Revascularization was satisfactory in each case. Each groin infection healed. Two patients died of unrelated causes at 1.5 and 5 months after operation. The seven remaining grafts at risk (six patients) remained patent 12 months in each case. Four grafts were doing well at 18, 36, 50, and 52 months. Three grafts failed at 13, 19, and 28 months; one was revised successfully, one was re-done and failed again. Obturator foramen bypass grafting provides satisfactory and durable revascularization when an alternate route to the lower extremity is required.
TI  - [Actual germ spectrum in wound surgery].
AB  - Under aerobic conditions Staph. aureus was isolated in 40%, grampositive germs were as frequent as gramnegative bacteria. Bacteroides fragilis was the predominant germ from material suspicious of an anaerobic infection. For its isolation the material should be sent as soon as possible to the laboratory to be investigated under anaerobic conditions. The author stresses the close cooperation between the clinician and the microbiologist to receive optimal diagnostic results as the basis of an effective chemotherapy.
TI  - Augmentin: laboratory studies.
AB  - Clavulanic acid is a beta-lactam antibiotic which, although it has little intrinsic activity, is a potent inhibitor of bacterial beta-lactamases. When combined with amoxycillin its range of activity includes penicillinase-producing strains of Staphylococcus aureus and many of the beta-lactamase-producing strains of Gram-negative bacilli. Bacteria sensitive to augmentin include amoxycillin-resistant strains of Haemophilus influenzae and Escherichia coli, in addition strains of Klebsiella aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris and Bacteroides fragilis are usually sensitive. The beta-lactamases produced by Enterobacter spp, Proteus morgani, Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are less susceptible to clavulanic acid and these bacteria are usually resistant to augmentin (1).
TI  - Cefmenoxime (SCE-1365), a new cephalosporin: in vitro activity, comparison with other antimicrobial agents, beta-lactamase stability, and disk diffusion testing with tentative interpretive criteria.
AB  - The in vitro activity of cefmenoxime (SCE-1365) was evaluated in a multiphased collaborative investigation. Over 7,500 consecutive clinical isolates were tested in five laboratories, and greater than 90% of the following organisms were inhibited by cefmenoxime at the following concentrations: Enterobacteriaceae and non-enterococcal streptococci, </=0.125 mug/ml; Staphylococcus aureus, </=2.0 mug/ml; and nonfermenting gram-negative bacilli and Bacteroides fragilis group, </=32 mug/ml. Both beta-lactamase-producing and -nonproducing Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae were inhibited by cefmenoxime at </=0.03 mug/ml. The spectrum of cefmenoxime was similar to that of other, newer cephalosporins, particularly cefotaxime. A pronounced inoculum effect was found with some species upon increasing inocula from 10(5) to 10(7) colony-forming units per ml, resulting in an approximate eightfold increase in minimum inhibitory concentrations. Cefmenoxime was bactericidal when tested with inocula of 10(5) colonyforming units per ml, and mean differences between the minimum inhibitory concentration and the minimum lethal concentration were less than one log(2) dilution. No significant hydrolysis of cefmenoxime by five different beta-lactamases was detectable, and cefmenoxime exhibited marked inhibition of type I beta-lactamases. Regression and error rate-bounded analyses of results of disk diffusion and reference broth microdilution susceptibility tests were performed on 421 bacterial isolates, and the following tentative zone size breakpoints are proposed: >/=22 mm, susceptible; </=14 mm, resistant; and 15 to 21 mm, moderately susceptible (indeterminate). These data and cross-resistance studies with other newer cephalosporins indicate marked similarity of in vitro activity within this group of drugs, particularly between cefmenoxime, moxalactam, and cefotaxime. Any one of these could serve as the representative for the disk diffusion testing of this group of drugs if comparable minimum inhibitory concentration breakpoints were used for each drug.
TI  - Classification of macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin-B-type antibiotic resistance determinants.
AB  - We have examined the relationship between the genes specifying resistance towards macrolid-lincosamide-streptogramin-B-type (MLS) antibiotics from group D and H streptococci, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus licheniformis, and Bacteroides fragilis by DNA annealing. We detected homology between the MLS resistance determinants from the Gram-positive cocci (streptococci and staphylococci) but not between these and the genes from B. licheniformis and B. fragilis. Based on these DNA-DNA hybridizations and on data obtained from the literature, at least four distinct classes of MLS R determinants could be defined: classes A and B for the Gram-positive cocci, class C for B. licheniformis and class D and B. fragilis. These genetic classes did not correlate with differences in phenotypic expression or in regulation (inducibility or constitutivity) of resistance towards MLS antibiotics. These findings are in favor of a recent common origin of R determinants in streptococci and staphylococci but do not suggest that gene transfer may occur between Gram-positive cocci and anaerobes (B. fragilis) despite the fact that these pathogenic bacterial genera share common human eco-systems.
TI  - Moxalactam therapy for bacterial infections.
AB  - Moxalactam, a novel beta-lactam antimicrobial agent in which oxygen has replaced  sulfur in the six-membered ring of the conventional cephem nucleus, has in vitro activity against almost all commonly isolated bacterial pathogens including Staphylococcus aureus, the Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacteroides fragilis, and Haemophilus influenzae. The clinical efficacy an toxicity of moxalactam alone was evaluated in the treatment of 100 infections, including 22 septicemias. Thirty-two infections involved P aeruginosa, while organisms resistant to one or more of the currently available cephalosporins or cefoxitin were isolated from cultures in 63 of the cases. The overall clinical response was favorable (infection cured or improved) in 86% of the infections. A child with Klebsiella pneumoniae ventriculitis and meningitis was cured with intravenous moxalactam alone. Six of 14 treatment failures involved P. aeruginosa, and P aeruginosa isolates resistant to moxalactam emerged during therapy of 12 infections. Side effects, usually mild diarrhea, occurred in only 8.8% of the patients. Except for some severe P aeruginosa infections outside the urinary tract, moxalactam is effective and safe single-agent therapy for infections caused by susceptible organisms and represents a major advancement in beta-lactam antimicrobial therapy.
TI  - In-vitro activity of ceftazidime compared with other beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  - Ceftazidime and ceftriaxone (Ro 13-9904), two new parenteral cephalosporins, were compared with other beta-lactam antibiotics against a total of 237 recent clinical isolates. Both ceftazidime and ceftriaxone had good activity against the Enterobacteriaceae, with 90% of isolates being inhibited by 0.5 mg/l of ceftazidime and by 0.25 mg/l of ceftriaxone. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, ceftazidime was about four times more active than ceftriaxone which, in turn, was at least eight times more active than carbenicillin. Both ceftazidime and ceftriaxone were highly active against beta-lactamase producing and non-beta-lactamase producing Haemophilus influenzae. Against the Bacteroides fragilis group, neither ceftazidime nor ceftriaxone showed good activity, the MIC90 for ceftazidime being > 128 mg/l and the MIC90 for ceftriaxone being 32 mg/l. Both ceftazidime and ceftriaxone were less active than cephalothin against Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Ceftazidime: in-vitro antibacterial activity and susceptibility to beta-lactamases compared with that of cefotaxime, moxalactam and other beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  - The in-vitro antibacterial activity of ceftazidime was assessed against recent clinical isolates of common bacteria and also against reference strains that produced known beta-lactamases. The compound was active, though less so than cephaloridine against staphylococci and streptococci with MICs mostly 0.12-2 mg/l for streptococci and 8 mg/l for staphylococci, but enterococci (MICs > or =64 mg/l) and methicillin-resistant staphylococci (MICs 16-32 mg/l) were resistant. Penicillin-resistant pneumococci (MICs 2-4 mg/l) were much less sensitive than other pneumococci (MICs 0.12-0.25 mg/l). Ceftazidime was also active, but slightly less so than cefotaxime or moxalactam, against enterobacteria (MICs mostly 0.12-0.25 mg/l). Its activity was also inferior to that of cefotaxime against Neisseria gonorrhoeae (MICs mostly 0.03-0.06 mg/l) and Haemophilus influenzae (MICs mostly 0.06-0.25 mg/l). However it was about eightfold more active than cefotaxime or moxalactam against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MICs mostly 1-4 mg/l), and it was also more active than these compounds against other pseudomonads. Ceftazidime was less active than cefoxitin against Bacteroides spp. (MICs mostly 16-64 mg/l for Bact. fragilis and 2-8 mg/l for other bacteroides) and less active than ampicillin or cefoxitin against other anaerobes. The compound was highly resistant to hydrolysis by most beta-lactamases including OXA-1 and the enzymes from Klebsiella 1082E and Proteus vulgaris PC37 which hydrolyse cefuroxime and cefotaxime. However, it was hydrolysed slowly by the enzyme from a highly ampicillin-resistant isolate of Bact. fragilis.
TI  - The in-vitro properties of ceftazidime.
AB  - Ceftazidime showed a high level of in-vitro antibacterial activity against the Enterobacteriaceae with geometric mean MICs of 0.07-0.5 mg/l and at least 90% of isolates sensitive to 8 mg/l. This cephalosporin was at least as active as gentamicin against gentamicin-sensitive Enterobacteriaceae and showed no significant reduction in activity against gentamicin-resistant strains. The activity of ceftazidime against Pseudomonas species was of special note with all the 204 isolates tested sensitive to 8 mg/l and was highly active against gentamicin-resistant strains. Activity against Staphylococcus aureus was moderate, whilst streptococci were highly susceptible. Activity against Bacteroides fragilis was moderate but a range of anaerobic bacilli and cocci were sensitive. Ceftazidime showed no significant inoculum effects, was rapidly bactericidal and as stable as cefoxitin to a wide range of cell-free beta-lactamases. The spectrum and activity of ceftazidime suggest that it may replace the aminoglycosides currently in clinical use.
TI  - 6 beta-Iodopenicillanic acid (UI-38,006), a beta-lactamase inhibitor that extends the antibacterial spectrum of beta-lactam compounds: initial bacteriological characterization.
AB  - UK-38,006, 6 beta-iodopenicillanic acid, was shown to be a potent inhibitor of beta-lactamase enzymes. It potentiated the antibacterial action of ampicillin in vitro against beta-lactamase-producing strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Bacteroides fragilis. Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and many Enterobacteriaceae. This ability to synergize with ampicillin was also demonstrated in vivo after oral administration of UK-38,006 to experimentally infected mice. UK-38,006 was also shown to synergize in vitro with other penicillins and cephalosporins against beta-lactamase-producing strains of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, and Klebsiella species.
TI  - Use of cefotaxime, a beta-lactamase stable cephalosporin, in the therapy of serious infections, including those due to multiresistant organisms.
AB  - Cefotaxime is a cephalosporin active against most gram-positive and gram-negative organisms, including streptococci, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacteriaceae, Proteus, and many Pseudomonas and Bacteroides fragilis--all but the latter two are inhibited at concentrations below 0.5 micrograms/ml. We evaluated cefotaxime as the sole therapy for 32 infections in 31 patients. Infection sites included 18 bacteremias; pulmonary, urinary tract, deep tissue infections; and meningitis. Clinical cures were achieved in 88 percent and bacteriologic cures in 86 percent of the patients--including those with infections due to organisms resistant to cephalosporins, chloramphenicol, carbenicillin and aminoglycosides; and in two patients with meningitis due to multiresistant Klebsiella pneumoniae. Serum and cerebrospinal levels were readily maintained above the inhibitory levels of susceptible organisms. Adverse reactions were minimal. Cefotaxime was a safe, effective antibiotic in the treatment of infections due to susceptible organisms, including those resistant to other agents.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of first, second and third generation cephalosporins.
AB  - Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were determined against 662 recent clinical isolates for eight cephalosporins representing first, second and third generation compounds. All four third-generation cephalosporins tested (cefoperaxone, cefotaxime, ceftazidime and moxalactam) were significantly more active against aerobic gram-negative bacteria than the older compounds (cephalothin, cefamandole, cefoxitin, and cefuroxime). Cefotaxime and moxalactam were most active against Enterobacteriaceae with extremely low MIC-values. Ceftazidime was definitely most active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa with more than 90% of strains inhibited at 4 micro g/ml. MIC-values for cefotaxime against Staphylococcus aureus were for all strains 1-2 micro g/ml, slightly higher for cefoperazone, while the effect of ceftazidime and moxalactam was more limited. All third generation cephalosporins demonstrated efficiency against Streptococcus pyogenes, cefotaxime being most active and moxalactam least active, but were essentially ineffective against Streptococcus faecalis. Moxalactam demonstrated higher activity against Bacteroides fragilis than other second and third generation cephalosporins including cefoxitin. Previous studies have demonstrated a very high activity of all third generation cephalosporins against Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, including beta-lactamase producing strains.
TI  - Investigation into the microbial flora of healing and non-healing decubitus ulcers.
AB  - Seventy-four pressure lesions in fifty-three geriatric patients were observed at  weekly intervals to determine the bacterial flora and the healing index of each lesion, expressed as initial area of lesion (cm2) - final area of lesion (cm2) divided by time in days. The micro-organisms which caused infection included Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides asaccharolyticus. Many lesions contained a mixed flora. P mirabilis and Ps aeruginosa were associated with necrotic (p less than 0.005) and enlarging (p less than 5 x 10(-7)) lesions. Bacteroides spp were associated with necrotic lesions (p less than 0.05). The presence of S aureus in a lesion was not associated with any particular trend in healing index. The implications of the microbiological findings are discussed.
TI  - Anaerobic paronychia.
AB  - During 1 year 116 patients with paronychia had bacteriological cultures of the pus. Aerobic bacteria, predominantly Staphylococcus aureus were isolated from 81. Anaerobic bacteria were isolated from 35, and in 31 of these aerobes were also present. Anaerobic paronychias were less acute that those caused by aerobes but otherwise the clinical features and management were the same. The anaerobes isolated were those found as oro-pharyngeal commensals and did not include the colonic commensal Bacteroides fragilis. They were, with few exceptions, sensitive to penicillin.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic bacteriology of cutaneous abscesses in children.
AB  - Specimens from 209 cutaneous abscesses in children were cultured for aerobic and  anaerobic microorganisms. Of these, nine (4%) were sterile and 51 (24%) yielded pure cultures that were predominantly Staphylococcus aureus. The rest of the abscesses yielded growth of two or more aerobic and/or anaerobic organisms. The data were organized according to these anatomic locations: head, neck, trunk, finger, nailbed, hand, leg, buttocks, perirectal, and vulvovaginal areas. Aerobic bacteria only were present in 92 specimens (46%), anaerobes only were isolated in 52 (26%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were present in 56 abscesses (28%). A total of 467 isolates (270 anaerobes and 197 aerobes) were recovered, accounting for 2.3 isolates per specimen (1.3 anaerobes and 1.0 aerobes). The presence of more than one anaerobe per abscess was obtained from the vulvo-vaginal, buttocks, perirectal, finger, nailbed, and head areas. Aerobes were more prevalent in the neck, hand, leg, and trunk areas. The predominant aerobes recovered were: S aureus (89 isolates), alpha- and nonhemolytic streptococci (29), group A beta-hemolytic streptococci (16), Enterobacter (10), and Escherichia coli (8). The predominant anaerobes recovered were anaerobic Gram-positive cocci (79 isolates), Bacteroides sp (116, including 31 B melaninogenicus group and 29 B fragilis group), and Fusobacterium sp (39). Our findings indicate the polymicrobial nature and predominance of anaerobes in cutaneous abscesses in children in perirectal, head, finger, and nailbed areas.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in tonsils of children with recurrent tonsillitis.
AB  - Tonsils were obtained from 50 children suffering from recurrent tonsillitis. Patients' ages ranged from 2.5 to 17 years (mean 6 years); 29 were males and 21 females. The tonsils were sectioned in half after heat searing of the surface and the core material was cultured for aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms. Mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora was obtained in all patients, yielding an average of 7.8 isolates (4.1 anaerobes and 3.7 aerobes) per specimen. There were 207 anaerobes isolated. The predominant isolates were 101 Bacteroides sp (including 10 B fragilis group, and 47 B melaninogenicus group), 29 Fusobacterium sp, 34 Gram-positive anaerobic cocci (25 Peptococcus sp and 9 Peptostreptococcus sp) and 16 Veillonella sp. There were 185 aerobic isolates. The predominant isolates were 41 alpha-hemolytic streptococci, 24 Staphylococcus aureus, 19 beta-hemolytic streptococci (11 group A, 4 group B, and 2 each group C and F), 14 Haemophilus sp (including 12 H influenzae type B) and 5 H parainfluenzae. Beta-lactamase production was noted in 56 isolates recovered from 37 tonsils. These were all isolates of S aureus (24) and B fragilis (10), 15 of 47 B melaninogenicus (32%), 5 of the 12 B oralis (42%), and 2 of 12 H influenzae type B (17%). Our findings indicate the polymicrobial aerobic and anaerobic nature of deep tonsillar flora in children with recurrent tonsillitis, and demonstrate the presence of many beta-lactamase-producing organisms in 74% of the patients.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora of burns in children.
AB  - Aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora of burn sites in 180 children were monitored. Specimens were obtained twice a week; each patient had between one and 21 cultures taken (mean 2.4). A total of 392 specimens were collected over 2 years, of which 319 were positive. Aerobic bacteria alone were present in 225 specimens (71%) and anaerobic bacteria alone were present in 26 (8%). Mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were present in 68 burn specimens (21%). A total of 580 isolates (448 aerobes and 132 anaerobes) were recovered, accounting for 1.8 isolates per specimen (1.4 aerobes and 0.4 anaerobes). The predominant aerobic isolates were S. epidermidis, S. aureus, alpha hemolytic streptococcus, Pseudomonas sp., and Group D streptococcus. The predominant anaerobic isolates were: P. acnes, anaerobic Gram-positive cocci, and Bacteroides sp. Blood cultures were drawn from 45 children: four showed bacterial growth of one of each of the following isolates: S. aureus, E. coli, Peptococcus asaccharolyticus, and B. fragilis. The numbers of isolates per specimen were higher in the oral and anal area (3.2 and 2.8) than in the extremities and trunk (1.8 and 0.9). Gram-negative enteric rods and Group D streptococci were more frequently recovered from the anal area. S. aureus, S. epidermidis, and P. acnes were more frequently recovered from extremities. Bacteroides sp. and Fusobacterium nucleatum were more frequently recovered from the anal and oral areas. All children were treated with local application of silver sulfadiazine, and antimicrobial therapy was used in 128 children. Statistical analysis showed no correlation between the bacteria isolated and use of antimicrobial agents. These data suggest a role for anaerobic bacteria in the colonization of burns in children, especially in burns of the anal and oral areas.
TI  - Cefoperazone and cefotiam--two new cephalosporins: an in-vitro comparison.
AB  - The in vitro activity of cefoperazone (CPZ) and cefotiam (CTM) was compared to other available cephalosporins. Using an agar dilution procedure both CTM and CPZ were more active against the Enterobacteriaceae tested than cefoxitin, cefuroxime and cefazolin; CTM being slightly more active than CPZ, in particular against Klebsiella spp Haemophilus influenzae were more susceptible to CPZ. CTM had no activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa but CPZ exhibited considerable activity (mode MIC 4 mg/l). Against Bacteroides fragilis CPZ had a similar activity to cefuroxime, but CTM was less active. CTM was about twice as active as CPZ against Staphylococcus aureus, cefazolin being the most active agent tested. The MBC was about twice the MIC for each compound and the presence of 75% serum had only a modest effect on the MIC and MBC. The protein binding of CPZ was 94% and CTM 62%.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic bacteriology of adenoids in children: a comparison between  patients with chronic adenotonsillitis and adenoid hypertrophy.
AB  - Adenoids were obtained from 18 children with chronic adenotonsillitis (Group A) and from 12 others with adenoid hypertrophy (Group B). Patients' ages ranged from 20 months to 15 years (mean 6 years); 18 were males and 12 females. The adenoids were sectioned in half after heat searing of the surface, and the core material was cultured for aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms. Mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora were obtained from all patients, yielding an average of 7.8 isolates (4.6 anaerobes and 3.2 aerobes) per specimen. There were 97 anaerobes isolated. The predominant isolates in both groups were: Bacteroides sp. (including B. melaninogenicus and B. oralis), Fusobacterium sp., gram-positive anaerobic cocci, and Veillonella sp. There were 138 aerobic isolates. The predominant isolates in both groups were: alpha and gamma hemolytic streptococci, beta hemolytic streptococci (Group A, B, C, and F), S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, and Hemophilus sp. Hemophilus influenzae type B, and S. aureus were more frequently isolated in Group A. B. fragilis was only recovered in Group A. Beta lactamase production was noted in 27 isolates obtained from 18 patients. Fifteen of these patients belonged to Group A (83% of Group A), while 3 were members of Group B (25% of Group B). These bacteria were all isolates of S. aureus (11) and B. fragilis (2), 8 of 22 B. melaninogenicus group, 4 of 11 B. oralis, and two of 8 H. influenza type B. Our findings indicate the polymicrobial nature of deep adenoid flora and demonstrate the presence of many beta lactamase-producing organisms in children with recurrent adenotonsillitis.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of ceftriaxone (Ro 13-9904), a beta-lactamase-stable cephalosporin.
AB  - The in vitro activity of ceftriaxone (Ro 13-9904), a parenteral cephalosporin, was compared with that of other beta-lactam antibiotics. the compound was less active against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis than was cephalothin or cefamandole, but it was comparable to cefoxitin, cefotaxime, and moxalactam in inhibiting most isolates of S. aureus at 3.1 microgram/ml. Ro 13-9904 inhibited Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae at concentrations below 0.25 microgram/ml, but Streptococcus faecalis required concentrations above 25 microgram/ml. Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Haemophilus influenzae were inhibited at concentrations similar to those of cefotaxime, less than 0.1 microgram/ml. Ro 13-9904 was as active as cefotaxime and moxalactam against most Enterobacteriaceae and was the most active agent tested against Proteus, inhibiting all strains tested at 0.006 microgram/ml. Ro 13-9904 was slightly less active than moxalactam or cefoxitin against Bacteroides fragilis, requiring more than 100 microgram/ml to inhibit 90% of isolates, and it was less active than cefoperazone against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Presence of serum, alteration of pH, and use of various media did not change the inhibitory levels. Bactericidal concentrations were similar to inhibitory levels. Ro 13-9904 was stable to most plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases, but was hydrolyzed by some Enterobacter, Proteus, and Bacteroides beta-lactamases of chromosomal origin.
TI  - Comparative in vitro studies of Ro 13-9904, a new cephalosporin derivative.
AB  - The in vitro activity of Ro 13-9904, a new cephalosporin derivative, was compared with the activities of cephalothin, cefamandole, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, and moxalactam against 591 clinical isolates of gram-negative and gram-positive organisms. The spectra of activity and potency of Ro 13-9904 and cefotaxime were quite similar; they were the most active agents against Enterobacteriaceae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Neisseria meningitidis. Moxalactam was only slightly less active against these organisms. Ro 13-9904, cefotaxime, and moxalactam were approximately equal in activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa; concentrations of 50 to 100 microgram/ml inhibited over 90% of the strains tested. Cefamandole and cephalothin were the most active drugs tested against staphylococci. Moxalactam demonstrated the highest intrinsic activity against Bacteroides fragilis; a concentration of 1.6 microgram/ml inhibited over 50% of the strains. All six of the antibiotics were essentially inactive against group D streptococci. The action of all of the antibiotics was bactericidal, with minimal bactericidal concentrations generally being no more than twofold greater than minimal inhibitory concentrations. The only exception to this was found when large inocula of Staphylococcus aureus were tested. Increased inoculum size generally sharply reduced the activity of Ro 13-9904, cefotaxime, and moxalactam against Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Selected postoperative antibiotic prophylaxis in colo-rectal surgery on the basis of bacterial concentration in the operative field.
AB  - A new approach to antibiotic prophylaxis was tested in a prospective study of postoperative septic complications in elective colo-rectal surgery. The degree of contamination in the operative field in a nontreated group was estimated by dipslide technique. When the slide yielded greater than or equal to 5 CFU of a coliform bacterium or S. aureus the patient was judged to be contaminated. This trait was significantly correlated to the development of postoperative infection. All contaminated cases in another group of patients were subjects to prophylaxis within 24 hours after peritoneal closure, using an antibiotic with a favourable MIC concerning the current bacterium (-iae). This resulted in a significant reduction of the rate of infection. These findings challenge the current concept of a very limited effective period of prophylactic systemic antibiotics.
TI  - Wound sepsis after elective cholecystectomy. Restriction of prophylactic antibiotics to risk groups.
AB  - This prospective study of elective cholecystectomy investigated the frequency and type of bacteria in gallbladder bile at operation, the factors predicting the presence of bacteria in bile, and the relationship between bacteria in bile and subsequent wound sepsis. In 148 consecutive cases 23% of bile cultures were positive. The overall wound infection rate was 15%, but 91% of all wound infections occurred in patients with positive bile cultures. Eighty-five per cent of all positive bile cultures and 86% of all wound infections occurred in 37% of the patients, characterized by age over 60 years and/or a history of previous attacks of acute cholecystitis. We suggest that in elective cholecystectomy prophylactic antibiotics should be restricted to this group of patients to limit the use of antibiotics.
TI  - The treatment of the carrier state of group A beta-hemolytic streptococci with clindamycin.
AB  - 20 children who were chronic carriers of group A beta-hemolytic streptococci (GABHS) were treated with oral clindamycin. Surface tonsillar cultures were obtained prior to therapy and 2 weeks after termination of therapy. They were processed for aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms. Mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora were obtained from all cultures. Prior to therapy, the average yield was 9 isolates (5 aerobes and 4.1 anaerobes) per specimen; after completion of therapy, the average yield was 5.7 isolates (3 aerobes and 2.7 anaerobes). GABHS, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacteroides fragilis, and Bacteroides oralis were completely eliminated after clindamycin therapy and the number of isolates of Bacteroides melaninogenicus and Fusobacterium sp. was reduced. Beta lactamase production was detected prior to therapy in 21 isolates recovered from 16 tonsillar surfaces (80%). These included all isolates of S. aureus (8) and B. fragilis (2), 8 of 18 B. melaninogenicus (44%), and 3 of 5 B. oralis (60%). Only one isolate of beta-lactamase-producing strain of B. melaninogenicus was recovered after conclusion of therapy. Follow-up of the patients for 18 - 24 months (average 22 months) showed no recurrence of GABHS in 19 of the 20 children.
TI  - In vitro comparison of three new cephalosporins: LY-127935, cefotaxime and cefoperazone.
AB  - The comparative in vitro activity of three new cephalosporin antibiotics Ly-127935 (LY), cefotaxime (CTX) and cefoperazone (CFP) was examined. LY, CTX and CFP had similar activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis while CFP was less inhibitory than LY or CTX against Klebsiella spp.; indole + Proteus and gentamicin (GM)-susceptible Serratia. LY and CTX were effective while CFP was inactive against Enterobacter spp. and GM-resistant Serratia. CFP was more active than LY or CTX against GM-susceptible Pseudomonas aeruginosa but was the least active agent against GM-resistant isolates. Bacteroides fragilis were more susceptible to LY than CTX or CFP. Combination studies against P. aeruginosa with cephalosporin-GM pairs demonstrated synergy.
TI  - Anaerobic and aerobic bacteriology of decubitus ulcers in children.
AB  - Forty-two children with decubitus ulcers were studied using aerobic and anaerobic techniques. Anaerobic bacteria were isolated in 21 (50%) of the patients, five times as the only isolates and 16 times mixed with aerobes. Aerobes only were present in 20 (48%) of the patients. There were a total of 83 isolates, 46 aerobes and 37 anaerobes, with an average of two species per specimen (1.1 aerobes and 0.9 anaerobes). The predominant anaerobic isolates were gram-positive cocci (17), Bacteroides fragilis (6), and Fusobacterium nucleatum (4). The most common aerobic isolates were Staphylococcus aureus (23), Group A beta hemolytic streptococci (6), Hemophilus influenzae (5), and Enterobacter agglomerans (5). The polymicrobial etiology of decubitus ulcers in hospitalized children is demonstrated.
TI  - Comparative in vitro appraisal of piperacillin, including its activity against Salmonella typhi.
AB  - Piperacillin was evaluated in vitro against 711 clinical isolates of aerobic and  anerobic gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including 76 isolates of Salmonella typhi. Piperacillin minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) were compared with those of a range of beta-lactam, aminoglycoside, and other antimicrobial agents, and inoculum size effects were considered. The relationship between dilution and disk diffusion tests was studied by regression analysis. In addition, piperacillin was assessed in combination with aminoglycoside and other beta-lactam drugs. This investigation has confirmed the activity of piperacillin against a broad range of bacteria, including Pseudomonas, Enterobacteriaceae, Neisseria, beta-lactamase-negative Haemophilus influenzae, and Staphylococcus aureus as well as enterococci, Bacteroides fragilis, and other anaerobes. All strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were inhibited by </=32 mug/ml or less, demonstrating again the potential usefulness of piperacillin in the treatment of pseudomonal infections. S. typhi proved susceptible to piperacillin, all isolates being inhibited by 1 mug/ml. Inoculum size experiments showed that inocula of 10(8) CFU resulted in MICs and MBCs appreciably higher than those resulting from inocula of 10(6) CFU, and inocula of 10(2) CFU resulted in MICs and MBCs appreciably lower than those resulting from inocula of 10(4) CFU. Piperacillin was active against all gentamicin-resistant pseudomonads tested, but not against gentamicin-resistant klebsiellas and enterobacters. Combinations of piperacillin with tobramycin and amikacin were consistently synergistic against Pseudomonas and Serratia isolates. Less consistent results were shown when piperacillin was combined with aminoglycosides or cephalothin against Klebsiella and indole-positive Proteus isolates, although synergy was observed in most cases. Occasional antagonistic reactions were encountered with piperacillin-cephalothin or piperacillin-tobramycin combinations against the latter isolates.
TI  - Synergistic activity of piperacillin in combination with beta-lactamase inhibitors.
AB  - Clavulanic acid and a penicillanic acid sulfone, when combined individually with  piperacillin, synergistically inhibited various Enterobacteriaceae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacteroides fragilis. Clavulanic acid and piperacillin synergistically inhibited 91 of 170 (55%) isolates tested. Synergy was most often found against piperacillin-resistant bacteria: 65 of 69 isolates (94%). Although the penicillanic acid sulfone acted synergistically with piperacillin, inhibiting 62 of 170 strains (33%), the concentration of clavulanic acid required for synergy generally was less than that of penicillanic acid sulfone. Combination of piperacillin and cefotaxime, an inhibitor of type 1 beta-lactamases, rarely was synergistic and was antagonistic for several species. The combination of piperacillin with potent beta-lactamase inhibitors made piperacillin active against those isolates of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella and Bacteroides species, as well as selected other species, that are resistant to piperacillin by virtue of their production of beta-lactamases.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic bacteriology of perirectal abscess in children.
AB  - Aspirates of pus from perirectal abscesses in 28 children were studied for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. A total of 87 isolates (64 anaerobic and 23 aerobic) were recovered from the patients, an average of 2.3 anaerobes and 0.8 aerobes per specimen. Anaerobic organisms alone were recovered from 15 specimens (54%), and in nine specimens (32%) they were mixed with aerobic organisms. Aerobic organisms were recovered in pure culture in only four patients (14%). The predominant anaerobic organisms were Bacteroides sp (32 isolates, including 14 B fragilis group and seven B melaninogenicus group), Gram-positive anaerobic cocci (15), Fusobacterium sp (six), and Clostridium sp (three). The predominant aerobic organisms were Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus (six of each), group A beta-hemolytic streptococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus morganii (two of each). Five children had a serious underlying chronic disease; three of these had an accompanying bacteremia and two died. Incision and drainage were performed on all patients: some children also received parenteral, or oral antibiotic treatment, or both.
TI  - Host factors in the formation of abscesses.
AB  - The role of host factors in the formation of subcutaneous abscesses due to Bacteroides fragilis or Staphylococcus aureus was investigated in athymic nude mice, mice deficient in the fifth component of complement (C5D), and mice pretreated with cobra venom factor (CVF). CVF-treated mice, inoculated with B. fragilis, had abscesses 62% larger than those of control mice at day 4 (P < 0.01), but no significant difference was observed when S. aureus was used. Athymic nude mice had significantly smaller abscesses than control animals at both days 4 and 7 after inoculation with either organism. There were no differences in abscess size or in the accumulation of neutrophils at day 4 when C5D mice were compared with control animals for either organism. The results suggested that the activity of the alternative complement pathway may influence abscess size and that chemotactic factors other than the fifth component of complement can supervene in C5D mice to produce encapsulated abscesses. The absence of thymic factors did not prevent containment of abscesses.
TI  - Bacteriology of aspiration pneumonia in children.
AB  - Aspiration pneumonia in adults has been shown to involve anaerobes about 90% of the time. Studies of the bacteriology of aspiration pneumonia in children done in the past have either failed to exclude the oral and upper respiratory tract flora or have not utilized proper anaerobic culture techniques or both. In the present study. 74 institutionalized children with aspiration pneumonia were studied by percutaneous transtracheal aspiration. Their average age was 8 years. Fifty-two patients had pneumonitis, 12, necrotizing pneumonia, and 10, lung abscess. Only one patient (with lung abscess) had a complicating empyema. There was an average of five bacteria isolated per specimen--2.8 anaerobes and 2.2 nonanaerobes. The predominant anaerobic isolates were Gram-positive cocci, Bacteroides melaninogenicus, and fuso-bacteria; there were ten patients who yielded members of the Bacteroides fragilis group. The predominant nonanaerobes were alpha-hemolytic streptococci, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus. Thus, aspiration pneumonia in children, as in adults, commonly involves anaerobic bacteria. When aspiration occurs in a medical institution, nosocomial pathogens which are aerobic or facultative will also often be involved, in both children and adults.
TI  - Combined antibacterial activity of amoxicillin with clavulanic acid against ampicillin-resistant strains.
AB  - Strains of bacteria resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics have been increasing in  number and are becoming troublesome in clinical medicine. The in vitro antibacterial activity of amoxicillin combined with clavulanic acid was determined on selected ampicillin-resistant clinical isolates. Synergistic effects were produced by amoxicillin with clavulanic acid against ampicillin-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, and Bacteroides fragilis. Inhibition of the beta-lactamases produced by the ampicillin-resistant strains was confirmed, especially against the penicillinases mediated by the R factor and the cephalosporinases produced by P.vulgaris and B. fragilis. The inhibitory effect of clavulanic acid against beta-lactamases was irreversible because of the high affinity of clavulanic acid to the enzymes.
TI  - Comparison of in vitro activity of GR 20263, a novel cephalosporin derivative, with activities of other beta-lactam compounds.
AB  - The in vitro activity of GR 20263, a new cephalosporin, was compared primarily with the activities of moxalactam (LY 127935), cefotaxime, cefoxitin, cefuroxime, and cefazolin against 293 clinical isolates of a variety of gram-positive and -negative bacteria. The minimal inhibitory concentrations of GR 20263 for 90% of group isolates were between 0.06 and 0.5 microgram/ml for the Enterobacteriaceae, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Lancefield group A beta-hemolytic streptococci; 2 micrograms/ml for Pseudomonas aeruginosa; 16 micrograms/ml for Staphylococcus aureus; and in excess of 128 micrograms/ml for Bacteroides fragilis and Lancefield group D streptococci. In comparison with the other agents, GR 20263 was markedly more active against the Enterobacteriaceae than cefuroxime, cefoxitin, and cefazolin, but marginally less active than moxalactam or cofotaxime. Aganist S. aureus, cefazolin was 16-fold and cefotaxime was 4-fold more active than GR 20263 and moxalactam. GR 20263 was eight-fold more active than cefotaxime and moxalactam against P. aeruginosa.
TI  - CP-45,899 in combination with penicillin or ampicillin against penicillin-resistant Staphylococcus, Haemophilus influenzae, and Bacteroides.
AB  - CP-45,899 is a new, semisynthetic beta-lactamase inhibitor. When tested alone, CP-45,899 displayed only weak antibacterial activity, with the notable exception of its potent action against penicillin-susceptible and -resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae. A combination of 3.12 microgram of CP-45,899 per ml with 3.12 microgram of ampicillin per ml, tested in broth cultures, inhibited ca. 90% of resistant Staphylococcus and Haemophilus influenzae strains; similar data were obtained in a variety of media. The same combination of CP-45,899 with ampicillin or penicillin G inhibited 90% of Bacteroides fragilis as interpreted from agar dilution minimal inhibitory concentrations. Inhibitory concentrations of CP-45,899-ampicillin were bactericidal against H. influenzae strains and were as bactericidal as nafcillin or cephalothin against S. aureus. Ampicillin-resistant S. aureus, H. influenzae, and B. fragilis strains did not develop resistance to CP-45,899-ampicillin when transferred as many as six passages in the presence of a sublethal concentration of the combination.
TI  - Comparison of in vitro activity of moxalactam (LY127935) with cefazolin, amikacin, tobramycin, carbenicillin, piperacillin, and ticarcillin against 420 blood culture isolates.
AB  - To compare the in vitro activity of moxalactam (LY127935), a new broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent, with cefazolin, amikacin, tobramycin, carbenicillin, piperacillin, and ticarcillin, each drug was tested against 420 bacterial isolates from the blood of septic patients. Standard broth dilution methods were used to determine minimum inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations. LY127935 was as active as the aminoglycosides against aerobic gram-negative organisms, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and was at least 10-fold more active than the other beta-lactam agents against these bacteria. LY127935 was the most active agent tested against Bacteroides fragilis; its activity against all other anaerobic bacteria and Staphylococcus aureus was similar to those of the other agents tested. All streptococci, however, grew at higher concentrations of LY127935 than any other drug, and Streptococcus faecalis and Listeria monocytogenes were not inhibited at the highest concentration tested (minimum inhibitory concentration, > 64 microgram/ml). Although a greater proportion of blood culture isolates were susceptible to LY127935 than to any other drug tested, LY127935 does not have a sufficiently broad spectrum of in vitro activity to be recommended safely alone for empirical treatment of sepsis of unknown etiology.

TI  - A quantitative model for subcutaneous abscess formation in mice.
AB  - The purpose of this experiment was to develop an experimental model of s.c. encapsulated abscesses in which abscess formation could be assessed by quantitative measurements. Inocula were composed of bacterial broth cultures, autoclaved mouse caecal contents or both in combination. These inocula were injected s.c. on the flank in 2 strains of mice. Large encapsulated abscesses formed in all recipients by Day 4 when the inoculum contained either B. fragilis or S. aureus combined with caecal contents. Bacterial concentrations per ml of pus at Day 6 were 10(10.1+/-0.02) for B. fragilis and 10(8.4+/-0.1) for S. aureus. Spontaneous external drainage began by 10--15 days, and complete healing of the lesion occurred by 4--6 weeks. The typical histological pattern consisted of a collagen capsule surrounding a rim of neutrophils, enclosing a central area of necrotic cells and fibre from the inoculum. The cross-sectional areas of the capsule, the neutrophil band and the entire abscess were measured in a reproducible manner by planimetry, and abscess volumes were calculated. Values for these measurements varied with different inocula and different times after inoculation, but were highly consistent for a specified time and inoculum.
TI  - Semielectronic turbidimeter for automated monitoring of bacterial growth in test  tubes.
AB  - An automated turbidimeter for measuring bacterial growth in ordinary test tubes is described. The device records and prints adsorbance, expressed as Klett units, of 60 cultures every 15 min. Provision is made for either aerobic or anaerobic incubation. The device is adaptable to modification, depending upon local requirements and availability of computation facilities.
TI  - Activity of the cefotaxime (HR756) desacetyl metabolite compared with those of cefotaxime and other cephalosporins.
AB  - The desacetyl metabolite (DES) of cefotaxime (HR756) is formed in vivo to a significant extent. The in vitro activities of DES, the parent compound, and cefazolin, cefoxitin, and cefuroxime were compared against 70 bacterial isolates. DES was found to possess approximately 1/10th the activity of the parent compound against the common Enterobacteriaceae, but was somewhat more active than the other three compounds tested. DES had no useful activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and was less active than cefotaxime or cefoxitin against Staphylococcus aureus or Bacteroides fragilis. Because DES may accumulate in renal failure or be concentrated in the biliary tract, its antimicrobial activity may have considerable clinical significance.
TI  - Cefamandole in the treatment of serious bone and joint diseases.
AB  - The safety and efficacy of treatment with cefamandole were evaluated in 77 patients (from 33 institutions) with serious bone and joint infections. The antibiotic was given intramuscularly or intravenously in doses ranging from 1.5 to 12 g/day for 6 to 58 days. Seventy-three of the 77 patients responded satisfactorily, and 63 (of 70 from whom material for culture was obtainable) patients had a bacteriologic cure. Forty-one of 81 isolates were identified as Staphylococcus aureus. Other pathogens included Streptococcus epidermidis, Haemophilus influenzae, Enterobacter sp., Escherichia coli, aerobic and anaerobic cocci, as well as Bacteroides fragilis. The drug was well tolerated. Pharmacological studies indicated that cefamandole penetrated the bones and joints. Cefamandole would seem to be a safe and efficacious drug, for the treatment of serious bone and joint infections due to a wide variety of gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms.
TI  - A study of the in vitro activity of cefoperazone: a comparison with other beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  
TI  - Methods for testing antibiotic sensitivity of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - Problems are still encountered in the performance and interpretation of tests of  anaerobe sensitivity to antibiotics. A review of the methods currently used was carried out in order to determine factors modifying the activity of antibiotics. The sensitivity of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium perfringens to various drugs was tested under different conditions (including different culture media and incubation atmospheres). Gentamicin and kanamycin showed no activity in tests with brain heart infusion agar incubated anaerobically or in 10% CO2. The activity of lincomycin was much more readily influenced by test conditions than that of clindamycin. All the drugs examined except gentamicin and kanamycin showed more activity when tested in brain heart infusion agar than in Mueller Hinton blood agar.
TI  - Bacteriology of rattlesnake venom and implications for therapy.
AB  - Although the incidence of infection secondary to the bites of venomous snakes remains unknown, the routine use of prophylactic antimicrobial therapy is advocated. In this study, the venom from 15 rattlesnakes was cultured, and 58 aerobic and 28 anaerobic strains of bacteria were isolated. The most common species isolated were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus species, coagulase-negative staphylocci, and Clostridium species. Bacteroides fragilis was also recovered. When the fang sheaths of four additional rattlesnakes were retracted and the fangs of these snakes decontaminated, 50% of the samples of venom had no bacterial growth (P = 0.035). Until a clinical study is performed, the use of antimicrobial therapy that reflects that complex oral flora of rattlesnakes is still recommended in most cases of envenomization.
TI  - Experimental infections with Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus sanguis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Bacteroides fragilis in the jaws of dogs.
AB  
TI  - In vitro activity of LY127935.
AB  - LY127935 is a unique new beta-lactam antibiotic. Its activity against 536 clinical isolates was studied by using microdilution methods of susceptibility testing and compared with the activities of cefamandole, cefoxitin, and cephalothin. The lowest concentrations required to inhibit at least 90% of strains tested (MIC(90)s) of LY127935 for Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae ranged from 2 to 8 mug/ml. The MIC(90)s for other staphylococci and streptococci were higher. The MIC(90)s for Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas species ranged from 0.12 to 8 mug/ml and 8 to >32 mug/ml, respectively. The MIC(90)s for anaerobes ranged from 2 to >32 mug/ml. As determined by MIC(90)s, LY127935 was consistently the least active antibiotic against facultatively anaerobic gram-positive cocci and the most active against aerobic and facultatively anaerobic gram-negative bacilli. Its position with respect to activity against anaerobes varied from being the most active against Bacteroides fragilis and Clostridium perfringens to the least active against anaerobic cocci. In a population of multidrug-resistant isolates, concentrations of 8 mug or less of LY127935 per ml inhibited 82% of Enterobacteriaceae; concentrations of 32 mug or less per ml inhibited 100% of Enterobacteriaceae and 40% of P. aeruginosa. Increasing the inoculum size by 100-fold did not increase the minimal inhibitory concentrations of LY127935 or cefoxitin but did increase minimal inhibitory concentrations of cefamandole and cephalothin for some Enterobacteriaceae. All four drugs were bactericidal; minimal bactericidal concentrations were the same or one concentration higher than minimal inhibitory concentrations for 91 to 96% of strains tested. The broad spectrum and marked in vitro activity of LY127935 make it a promising new antibiotic.
TI  - Bacterial colonization, tracheobronchitis, and pneumonia following tracheostomy and long-term intubation in pediatric patients.
AB  - Serial tracheal cultures for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were obtained from 27 pediatric patients during one year of follow-up. The patients had required tracheostomy and prolonged intubation for periods ranging from 3 to 12 months (average, 7 1/2 months). Cultures of tracheal aspirates yielded 1,508 isolates of pathogenic aerobic (969 isolates) and anaerobic (539 isolates) bacteria. The most frequent aerobic isolates were Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus. The predominant anaerobes were anaerobic gram-positive cocci, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Bacteroides fragilis. Replacement of one pathogen by another occurred frequently. Tracheobronchitis occurred in 24 patients, all of whom had episodes of pneumonia. The data suggest that anaerobic bacteria are a part of the bacterial flora in colonization, tracheobronchitis, and pneumonia in patients with tracheostomy and prolonged intubation.
TI  - LY127935, a novel oxa-beta-lactam: an in vitro comparison with other beta-lactam  antibiotics.
AB  - The in vitro activities of LY127935 (LY) were compared with those of other beta-lactam antibiotics. LY was highly active (minimal inhibitory concentration [MIC] range 0.06 to 0.25 micrograms/ml) against the common Enterobacteriaceae (including Providencia stuartiia, Enterobacter, and Serrati marcescens), 8 to 16 times more active than cefoxitin, cefuroxime, or cefazolin, and from one-half to one-eighth as active as cefotaxime (HR756). The activity of LY against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (with MICs of 4 and 64 micrograms/ml for 50 and 90% of test strains, respectively) was essentially similar to that of cefotaxime, but was only one-half as active as CGP 7174/E. LY, cefoxitin, and cefotaxime were essentially equally active against Bacteroides fragilis--each was more active than cefuroxime and cefazolin. Against Staphylococcus aureus, LY (50% MIC and 90% MIC of 4 and 16 micrograms/ml, respectively) was less active than cefotaxime, cefoxitin, or cefuroxime and one-eighth as active as cefazolin. The composition and pH of the culture medium had little effect on the activity of LY, although 7.2 appeared to be the optimum pH.
TI  - In vitro activity of LY127935.
AB  - The activity of LY127935, a beta-lactam antibiotic of novel structure, was studied in vitro against facultative gram-negative bacilli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacteroides fragilis. The strains were recent clinical isolates, many of which were relatively resistant to other antibiotics. LY127935 exhibited striking activity against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter sp., Proteus sp., Serratia marcescens, and B. fragilis with median minimum inhibitory concentrations of less than or equal to 1.0 micrograms/ml. It was somewhat less active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and S. aureus. Cefotaxime (HR 756) showed very similar activity except that it was substantially weaker against B. fragilis. LY127935 was more active than cefamandole, cefoxitin, or piperacillin; it was also as potent as tobramycin or amikacin against all species except for P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Microbiology of superficial and deep tissues in infected diabetic gangrene.
AB  - In the current study, it is shown that, in the lesions of diabetic gangrene, there are usually mixed flora of two or more organisms. The organisms isolated from the presenting lesion may only partially reflect the organisms found in the deep tissues. Of the 58 cultures from the deep tissues, 11 of the isolates were anaerobes, but those anaerobes were never isolated as a pure culture. Bacterial synergism probably plays a role in infected diabetic gangrene. Maximizing the reduction of systemic infection and local cellulitis by elevation and appropriate antibiotic therapy results in improved wound healing in amputations of the lower extremities in patients with diabetic gangrene. However, apparent from this study, antibiotic therapy does not eradicate the organisms in the deep tissue, and surgical procedures are usually required for definitive treatment. Material from the surgically removed infected tissue should always be cultured for identification of existing organisms. When indicated, appropriate adjustment of antibiotic therapy, based upon these findings, should be prescribed.
TI  - Bacteriology and treatment of chronic otitis media.
AB  - Tympanocentesis was performed in 50 patients with chronic otitis media. Pus was cultured aerobically and anaerobically. Aerobes only were isolated from 21 patients, 3 had only anaerobes (peptococcus sp.) and 26 had both aerobes and anaerobes. There were 68 aerobic isolates. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was recovered in 36 (72%). Other aerobes commonly recovered included proteus sp. and Staphylococcus aureus. There were 48 anaerobes isolated. Anaerobic gram positive cocci were isolated in 24 instances. Sixteen Bacteriodes sp. were recovered, including 7 B. fragilis and 6 B. melaninogenicus. The patients were divided into two groups according to their antimicrobial therapy: 28 received carbenicillin and 22 clindamycin. An aminoglycoside was added when aerobic enteric gram negative rods were present in significantly high numbers in the culture. There was good to excellent response to therapy in more than half of the patients and in 12% there was a remission from symptoms for up to one year. Thirty-six percent of the patients had no response to therapy. There were no statistical differences in response to therapy in the two groups treated. Antimicrobial therapy directed against aerobic and anaerobic isolates from chronic otitis media had a high success rate in complete eradication of the infection.

TI  - Frequency and fate of human renal allografts contaminated prior to transplantation.
AB  - Bacterial cultures were done from donor ureter and/or graft perfusion fluid on 92 of 112 patients who had renal transplantations during 1977. Three samples of perfusion fluid and 14 samples of donor ureter contained bacteria. In nine cases there was a gram-positive organism, and in 10 cases a gram-negative rod was (among) the contaminant(s). There was no difference in the rate of graft survival, patient survival, or in the frequency of major postoperative complications between the two groups. Only in two instances could the urinary tract infection following transplanation be traced to the contaminating organism. Except for one case in which a urinary fistula may have been linked to the graft contamination, there were no clinically significant sequelae from the contaminated allografts.
TI  - Clindamycin in treatment of aspiration pneumonia in children.
AB  - Twenty-eight patients with anaerobic pleuropulmonary infections were treated with clindamycin alone or clindamycin with gentamicin. Sixteen of the patients presented with pneumonitis, nine with necrotizing pneumonia, and three with lung abscesses. The average length of treatment was 13.8 days, and the duration of temperature after initiation of therapy was 3.1 days. The predominant isolates were anaerobic gram-positive cocci (23 isolates), Bacteroides melaninogenicus (14), Bacteroides fragilis (9), and Fusobacterium nucleatum (11). The most frequent aerobic isolates were alpha-hemolytic streptococci (12), Diplococcus pneumoniae (12), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (9), Klebsiella pneumoniae (7), group A beta-hemolytic streptococci (5), Staphylococcus aureus (9), and Escherichia coli (6). All patients responded to the therapy and were cured of the infection. There were no side effects observed from the administration of clindamycin. None of the patients developed any blood dyscrasia, liver damage, diarrhea, or colitis. Clindamycin appears to be effective in the treatment of mixed aerobic and anaerobic pleuropulmonary infections in children, alone or with an aminoglycoside when indicated.
TI  - Bacteriology of chronic otitis media.
AB  - Tympanocentesis was performed in 50 patients with chronic otitis media; pus was cultured aerobically and anaerobically. Only aerobes were isolated from 21 patients (42%), three patients had only anaerobes (Peptococcus sp), and 25 patients (50%) had both aerobes and anaerobes. Only one specimen had no growth. There were 68 aerobic isolates. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was recovered in 36 patients (72%); other aerobes commonly recovered included Proteus sp and Staphylococcus aureus. There were 48 anaerobes isolated. Anaerobic Gram-positive cocci were isolated in 24 instances (21 Peptococcus sp and three Peptostreptococcus sp). Sixteen Bacteroides sp were recovered, including seven B fragilis group and six B melaninogenicus.
TI  - HR 756, a new cephalosporin active against gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activity of HR 756, 7-[2-(2-amino-4-thiazolyl)-2-(Z)-(methoximino)acetamido] cephalosporanic acid, was investigated against 659 isolates. HR 756 inhibited Neisseria and Haemophilus species at concentrations similar to those needed with ampicillin. It inhibited beta-lactamase-producing N. gonorrhoeae and H. influenzae. HR 756 was the most active compound tested against members of the Enterobacteriaceae, inhibiting most isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella, Enterobacter, and Shigella at concentrations of less than 0.1 mug/ml. It was twice as active as carbenicillin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and inhibited Bacteroides fragilis as well as cefoxitin. HR 756 killed E. coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and P. aeruginosa at rates similar to other beta-lactam antibiotics.
TI  - Septicemia in children with cancer.
AB  - Because of the persistently high mortality from sepsis in cancer patients, a retrospective study was designed to identify the causative organisms and to determine the factors affecting the outcome of sepsis. A total of 84 episodes of septicemia in 61 children with cancer were studied. The more frequently isolated organisms were: Staphylococcus aureus (21.4%); Escherichia coli (18%); Klebsiella (7.1%); Pseudomonas (6%); and Bacteroides fragilis (6%). Other isolates included Proteus, Serratia, Acinetobacter, hemolytic Streptococcus, and Bacillus cereus. In 10.7% of septic episodes, mixed bacterial infections were documented. Twenty-four (28.6%) resulted in death; in 13 (54%) death occurred within 24 hours after admission. The fatality rate was high in cases associated with absolute polymorphonuclear leukocyte counts of less than 100/cu mm, in neoplastic relapse, and when infection with gram-negative, anaerobic and mixed bacterial flora occurred.

TI  - Anaerobic subareolar breast abscess.
AB  - 15 non-puerperal women with breast abscess were seen during one year. In 8, anaerobes were cultured from pus obtained from the abscess, in 6, Staphylococcus aureus was grown, and in 1 the pus was sterile on culture. All 7 breast abscesses in puerperal women seen during the same period were staphylococcal. The anaerobic abscesses were all subareolar; they were recurrent in 4 patients and were associated with retracted nipples in 7. The anaerobes isolated were those found as normal commensals in the oropharynx and vagina but did not include the colonic commensal Bacteroides fragilis. Squamous metaplasia with keratin plugging of the breast ducts was identified histologically in the 2 non-puerperal patients in whom duct excision was performed. Surgical treatment of the underlying duct abnormality is important in the management of recurrent non-puerperal subareolar breast abscess.
TI  - The fetid foot: lower-extremity infections in patients with diabetes mellitus.
AB  - Infections of the lower extremities in patients with diabetes mellitus have been  attributed to Staphylococcus aureus and other facultatively anaerobic bacteria. However, a review of 30 consecutive diabetics who required surgery for lower-extremity infections revealed that 17 had mixed infections due to both obligate and facultative anaerobes; only six had infections due to S. aureus. Mixed infections often had characteristics of anaerobic suppuration and responded poorly to therapy. Patients with mixed infections required more operations than did those with staphylococcal infections, and their surgical wounds healed more slowly. Seven patients had infections with mixed enteric bacteria (neither anaerobes nor S. aureus), and their response to therapy was intermediate between that of the patients with mixed anaerobic infections and those with staphylococcal infections. Nine additional patients with mixed anaerobic infections were treated with cefoxitin; three required amputations at a level above the ankle, but six patients improved and required only limited surgery that preserved foot function. Bacteroides fragilis was the anaerobe isolated most often. Cefoxitin (less than or equal to 20 micrograms/ml) inhibited all of the anaerobes isolated from the nine patients and 97% of an additional 135 consecutive clinical isolates of B. fragilis; 98% of 54 strains of Bacteroides oralis and all of 34 strains of Bacteroides melaninogenicus were also inhibited. These in vitro results and the results of our clinical study show that cefoxitin is a promising antibiotic for therapy of foot infections due to a mixed flora of anaerobes in diabetics.
TI  - Cefoxitin therapy for bacterial endocarditis.
AB  - Of 22 patients who were suspected of having bacterial endocarditis and who were treated with cefoxitin intravenously (8-12 g per day), 12 were evaluated for responses to therapy. Ten patients had infections due to a single pathogen, and two had polymicrobial infections. Staphylococci were isolated from eight patients, and streptococci from four; both of these pathogens were susceptible to 2-16 micrograms of cefoxitin/ml. Staphylococcus aureus and four strains of anaerobic bacteria, including Bacteroides fragilis (minimal inhibitory concentration, 32 micrograms/ml), were isolated from one patient. The average level of cefoxitin in serum was 32.8 micrograms/ml (range, 14.5-64 micrograms/ml) at 1 hr after an intravenous dose of 2 g; after 5 hr the average level in serum was 8.5 micrograms/ml (range, 2-20 micrograms/ml). The mean (+/- SD) level of cefoxitin in myocardial tissues from eight rabbits at 1 hr following a 250-mg/kg dose of the antibiotic was 4 +/- 0.5 micrograms/g. On the average, patients were treated for 29 days (range, 14-40 days), and they became afebrile in 6.2 days (range, three to 20 days). Both clinical and microbiologic responses to cefoxitin therapy were excellent in 10 patients with monobacterial infections. Both patients with polymicrobial infections were not cured. One, who was infected with a mixed flora of anaerobes, died; the other was cured after surgical valvectomy. These results suggest that cefoxitin is effective in the treatment of endocarditis due to a single susceptible organism but that this antibiotic should be used with caution in patients whose endocarditis is caused by a mixed population of bacterial pathogens.
TI  - Anaerobic isolates in chronic recurrent suppurative otitis media. Treatment with  carbenicillin alone and in combination with gentamicin.
AB  - Tympanocentesis was performed in 32 pediatric patients with chronic recurrent suppurative otitis media. The aspirate was cultured aerobically and anaerobically. Aerobes were isolated from ten patients (31.2%); anaerobes from one patient; and both aerobes and anaerobes from 21 patients (65.6%). There were 46 aerobic isolates. The aerobes commonly recovered were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (24 isolates) Proteus sp. (5) and Staphylococcus aureus (3). There were 32 anaerobes isolated including anaerobic gram-positive cocci (19 isolates) and Bacteroides sp., the latter of which included Bacteroides fragilis group and Bacteroides melaninogenicus (9). The patients were treated by parenteral carbenicillin 300 to 400 mg per kg per day given in four dosages administered for a period of 12 to 21 days (average 17 days). An aminoglycoside (gentamicin) was added in 15 patients. The clinical response was good in 17 patients and poor in 15. There were no side effects or adverse reactions noted during therapy. The above findings demonstrate the polymicrobial etiology of chronic recurrent suppurative otitis media and suggest that treatment directed against the aerobic and anaerobic isolates is efficacious in more than half of the cases.
TI  - Endotoxin in germfree, gnotobiotic, or conventional-flora Sprague-Dawley rats.
AB  - The Limulus assay for bacterial endotoxin was performed on serum and (or) plasma  from animals monoassociated with Clostridium species, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter agglomerans, Bacteroides fragilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, or Candida albicans. Plasma from animals monoassociated with the gram-negative bacteria or C. albicans consistently showed a positive Limulus test while conventional-flora controls, germfree rats, and gnotobiotic animals monoassociated with gram-positive bacteria or E. agglomerans were negative. Germfree and conventional rats were injected (intraperitoneal (i.p.)) with Salmonella typhosa lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Although no endotoxin was detectable in either group prior to the injection, by 1 h post injection endotoxin was in the plasma of all groups. The germfree rats appeared to clear the LPS quicker than their conventional-flora counterparts. Generally, LPS-injected rats (conventional and germfree) showed clumping and decreased number of platelets, a decrease in their lymphocyte counts, and increased polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) counts.
TI  - Anaerobic and aerobic bacteriology in head and neck cancer surgery.
AB  - A prospective study of wound infections following major head and neck cancer surgery was undertaken to define a rational approach to trials of antibiotic prophylaxis and initial therapy of these infections. Preoperative aerobic cultures were taken from the planned site of skin incision and from the oropharynx. Both aerobic and anaerobic cultures were obtained from all wound infections. Patients receiving prophylactic antibiotics were excluded from the study. The data indicate that preoperative cultures are not usually predictive of the bacteriology of subsequent wound infection. Mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora were cultured from most wound infections and usually reflected normal anaerobic oropharyngeal flora and/or exogenously acquired Staphylococcus aureus. Bacteroides fragilis was not cultured in this series. Antibiotics selected for trials of prophylaxis or initial treatment of these infections should cover both the resident oral aerobic and anaerobic flora and S aureus. Coverage for B fragilis does not appear necessary. Antibiotic choices might include (1) penicillin G agents plus a penicillinase-resistant penicillin or (2) a parenteral cephalosporin.
TI  - Comparison of the in vitro activity of Bay k 4999 and piperacillin, two new antipseudomonal broad-spectrum penicillins, with other beta-lactam drugs.
AB  - Bay k 4999 and piperacillin, two new substituted ampicillins, were compared with  other beta-lactam antibiotics, including carbenicillin, azlocillin, mezlocillin, benzylpenicillin, ampicillin, and cefoxitin, against a wide range of gram-positive and -negative organisms. Bay k 4999 and piperacillin were extremely active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (50% inhibited by 2 mug/ml), being about 16-fold more active than carbenicillin. Bay k 4999 was the most active drug against Escherichia coli (50% inhibited by 0.5 mug/ml) and Klebsiella spp. (50% inhibited by 2 mug/ml). Piperacillin and Bay k 4999 were equally active against Proteus spp., and piperacillin had high activity against Bacteroides fragilis (50% inhibited by between 1 and 2 mug/ml).
TI  - Cefotoxime (HR 756) a new cephalosporin with exceptional broad-spectrum activity  in vitro.
AB  
TI  - Polymorphonuclear neutrophil chemotaxis under aerobic and anaerobic conditions.
AB  - The motility of human polymorphonuclear neutrophils was studied in vitro under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Chemotactic factors were generated from plasma with immune complexes or with whole bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Bacteroides fragilis). Chemotaxis induced by chemotactic factors generated from immune complexes was identical under both conditions. However, chemotaxis utilizing chemotactic factors generated from bacteria was markedly depressed under anaerobic conditions. Mean random tubemoltility was not significantly different under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. These data indicate that different metabolic pathways may be involved in polymorphonuclear neutrophil movement. Some of these pathways require oxygen (chemotaxis in response to factors generated by bacteria in plasma), whereas others do not (random tube migration and chemotaxis in response to factors generated by immune complexes in plasma). These observations may be important in the induction of inflammatory responses within hypoxic tissues.
TI  - Infective endocarditis: Part II. Current therapy.
AB  
TI  - Clinical experience with cefamandole for treatment of serious bone and joint infections.
AB  - The safety and efficacy of treatment with cefamandole were evaluated in 30 patients (from 18 institutions) with serious bone and joint infections. Five of the subjects were children. The antibiotic was given intramuscularly or intravenously in doses ranging from 2 to 12 g daily for five to 44 days. Twenty-six of the 30 patients responded satisfactorily. Fourteen of the fifteen infections due to Staphylococcus aureus were among the successful cases. Other pathogens were streptococci, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, and Bacteroides fragilis. The drug was well tolerated in patients in this series. Studies indicated that cefamandole penetrated the bones and joints. Further investigation of cefmandole in the treatment of bone and joint infections is warranted.
TI  - Management and microbiology of cutaneous abscesses.
AB  - Cutaneous abscesses in the perineal region contain primarily anaerobes commonly found in stool. Non-perineal abscesses contain mixed microflora indigenous to the skin. Bacteroides fragilis, the only anaerobe resistant to penicillin, is found predominantly in the perineal area. Staphylococcus aureus, although the most common aerobe found, is seen less frequently than expected and is almost always resistant to penicillin. Escherichia coli and Neisseria gonorrhoeae are rarely found. Incision and drainage is the primary mode of treatment. Fever is rare, though tachycardia is common in patients with normal host defenses. Patients with altered host defenses may require initial culture and Gram-stained smear to determine appropriate antibiotic therapy. The Gram-stained smear reliably indicates sterile and mixed abscesses, as well as those containing pure S aureus. Incision and drainage alone is the only therapy required in the usual patient. Since in these patients antibiotics are not required, initial culture and Gram-stained smear are unnecessary.
TI  - A comparative study of the activity of cefamandole and other cephalosporins and analysis of the beta-lactamase stability and synergy of cefamandole with aminoglycosides.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of cefamandole against 445 clinical isolates was investigated and compared with the activity of other known cephalosporins (cephalothin, cephaloridine, cephalexin, and cefazolin) and of two penicillins (ampicillin and carbenicillin). Cefamandole was the most active antibiotic against isolates of Citrobacter, Enterobacter, and Shigella, and its activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacteroides, and some members of the Enterobacteriaceae was comparable to that of the other antibiotics tested. The stability of cefamandole with respect to beta-lactamase was investigated and compared with that of cephalothin, cefazolin, and cephalexin. Cefamandole was stable with respect to the beta-lactamases of Enterobacter and some other members of the Enterobacteriaceae. No significant correlation was found between the antibacterial activity and the beta-lactamase stability of cefamandole, except with Enterobacter. The synergistic activity of cefamandole combined with gentamicin or amikacin was demonstrated by killing-curve techniques, isobolograms, and susceptibility data. Although 12%--46% of the isolates were synergistically inhibited by either combination, antagonism was not observed. No correlation between the hydrolysis of cefamandole by beta-lactamase and the synergistic activity of cefamandole combined with amikacin was demonstrated.
TI  - Differences between cephalothin and newer parenterally absorbed cephalosporins in vitro: a justification for separate disks.
AB  - The activities of cefamandole and cefoxitin in vitro were compared with that of cephalothin against staphylococci and gram-negative bacilli. Cephalothin was the most active agent against staphylococci. Cefamandole exhibited the greatest activity against the Enterobacteriaceae, with the exceptions of Serratia marcescens and indole-positive Proteeae, against which cefoxitin was the most active antibiotic. The activity of newer cephalosporins that are resistant to the beta-lactamases of gram-negative bacteria renders untenable the status of cephalothin as the class representative of the cephalosporins for susceptibility testing.
TI  - A rapid slide test for penicillinase.
AB  - The authors developed a rapid slide test modification of the iodometric method for detection of penicillinase produced by organisms growing on routine plating media. A loopful of colonies is scraped from the agar surface and emulsified in one drop of an iodine-penicillin solution on a glass slide. Addition of a drop of 0.4% starch solution results in a purple color when penicillinase is not present; a colorless reaction denotes a positive test. The slide test yielded positive results identical to those of a starch agar-plate method with 26 Staphylococcus aureus isolates; a further seven showed comparable negative tests. Penicillinase production was associated with a S. aureus penicillin MIC of greater than or equal to 0.5 micron/ml. All 15 Staphylococcus epidermidis isolates gave negative test results, as did 22 Bacteroides fragilis (MIC greater than or equal to 3.1). Twenty ampicillin-susceptible Haemophilus influenzae were negative by both the slide test and a Levinthal broth method; an additional five resistant (MIC greater than or equal to 10) isolates were positive by both methods. Twenty-eight (penicillin MIC greater than or equal to 0.8) of 50 Bacteroides melaninogenicus were slide test-positive for penicillinase. Two penicillinase-producing strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae gave positive slide tests, while eight other non-penicillinase-producers were negative.
TI  - Qualitative study of paradoxical zone phenomenon of penicillins against 17 bacterial species of clinical importance.
AB  - Using a triple agar layer technique and enzymatic inactivation of penicillin, the occurrence of a paradoxical zone phenomenon (illustrated by a typical 'target' image around the reservoir of antibiotic) was determined for several bacterial species specially chosen with regards to their taxonomic position, clinical importance and penicillin susceptibility. Among gram-positive bacteria, a paradoxical zone was obtained for approximately 43% of the strains studied here (all 10 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, all 10 strains of Streptococcus faecalis, 7 of 10 strains of group B beta-hemolytic streptococci, 1 of 10 group A strains, 3 of 10 strains of alpha-hemolytic streptococci, 3 of 10 strains of Clostridium perfringens but for none of 10 strains each of Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Listeria monocytogenes). Among gram-negative bacteria, a target image was regularly obtained with Haemophilus influenzae (all 10 strains tested) and Proteus species (9 of 10 strains) but with none of the following species: Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Shigella, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Neisseria meningitidis and Bacteroides fragilis. Therapeutic implications of these observations are difficult to assess, and need further investigation.
TI  - Comparison of killing of bacteria by guinea pig neutrophils and monocytes.
AB  - Guinea pig polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN's; harvested from the blood and from peritoneal exudates) and monocytes (harvested from the peritoneal cavity with and without stimulation of an exudate) were compared in their capacities to kill three pyogenic bacteria. All combinations of phagocytes and bacteria required heat-labile opsonic factors. No significant differences in killing of the three organisms were observed between blood and peritoneal PMN's or between stimulated and unstimulated monocytes. PMN's killed Staphylococcus aureus more effectively than monocytes after both 1 and 2 hr of incubation (p less than 0.05). Although PMN's appeared to have greater bactericidal activity against Escherichia coli than did monocytes, this differences was significant only after 2 hr of incubation (p less than 0.05). The killing of Bacteroides fragilis by PMN's and monocytes was identical. These data demonstrate that guinea pig exudates provide suitable models for the study of phagocytosis and killing of bacteria and suggest that the relative bactericidal capacities of phagocytes depend not only on the phagocyte but also on the species of pyogenic bacteria being studied. These observations may have important implications in host defense against serious infections.
TI  - Prophylactic systemic antibiotics in colorectal surgery.
AB  - The prophylactic value of gentamicin combined with either lincomycin or metronidazole in 52 patients undergoing colorectal surgery was investigated. The results confirmed the value of this practice. In a control group, the sepsis-rate was 48% with 1 death attributable to sepsis, compared with a sepsis-rate of 4% in the treated group. The combination of gentamicin and lincomycin was effective against sepsis but pseudomembranous colitis developed in 2 of the 14 patients treated with this combination of drugs. Lincomycin was discontinued, and when metronidazole was substituted the results were equally good and there were no toxic side-effects.
TI  - Anaerobic and aerobic bacteriology in head and neck cancer surgery.
AB  - A prospective study of wound infections following major head and neck cancer surgery was undertaken to define a rational approach to trials of antibiotic prophylaxis and initial therapy of these infections. Preoperative aerobic cultures were taken from the planned site of skin incision and from the oropharynx. Both aerobic and anaerobic cultures were obtained from all wound infections. Patients receiving prophylactic antibiotics were excluded from the study. The data indicate that preoperative cultures are not usually predictive of the bacteriology of subsequent wound infection. Mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora were cultured from most wound infections, and usually reflected normal anaerobic oropharyngeal flora, exogenously acquired Staphylococcus aureus, or both. Bacteroides fragilis was not cultured in this series. Antibiotics selected for trials of prophylaxis or initial treatment of these infections should cover both the resident oral aerobic and anaerobic flora and S aureus. Coverage for B fragilis does not appear necessary. Antibiotic choices might include penicillin G plus a penicillinase-resistant penicillin or a parenteral cephalosporin.
TI  - Effect of dilution on recovery of bacteria from blood.
AB  - The multiplication rate of bacteria in undiluted blood containing sodium polyanethol sulfonate was compared with growth rates obtained in dilutions of blood ranging from 1:2 to 1:8. Although all organisms tested grew in the undiluted blood, increased growth rates were seen in the 1:2 dilution. Further dilution resulted in growth rates equivalent to that obtained with the 1:2 dilution. In view of these results, we question the present recommendations that blood be diluted 1:10 or 1:20.
TI  - Empiric treatment with clindamycin and gentamicin of suspected sepsis due to anaerobic and aerobic bacteria.
AB  - Clindamycin and gentamicin were used in combination to treat 107 patients empirically for suspected aerobic-anaerobic sepsis. All patients were seriously ill and required initiation of treatment before results of cultures could be obtained. Infections included intraabdominal sepsis, hospital-acquired aspiration pneumonia, and soft tissue infections. Exudate cultured from 65 patients showed that the prediction of a mixed aerobic-anaerobic flora was correct in 46 patients (71%). Isolates from exudate included Escherichia coli, Bacteroides fragilis, clostridia, peptostreptococci, Proteus species, Klebsiella species, and Staphylococcus aureus. In 29 patients with bacteremia, the most frequent blood culture isolate was B. fragilis. Analysis of response to treatment showed that 92 patients were cured, five could not be evaluated adequately, and 10 failed to respond to therapy. Therapeutic failure primarily resulted from overwhelming sepsis, despite susceptibility of the pathogens to prescribed antibiotics.
TI  - Neonatal sepsis at The Johns Hopkins Hospital, 1969-1975: bacterial isolates and  clinical correlates.
AB  - The experience with neonatal sepsis at The Johns Hopkins Hospital during 1969-1975 was reviewed. Major pathogens included Escherichia coli, group B streptococcus, other streptococci, and Klebsiella. Nineteen percent of coliform isolates were kanamycin-resistant. The frequency of recovery of E. coli was increased in early-onset sepsis, and the frequency of recovery of Klebsiella was increased in late-onset sepsis. The mortality rate was 23%. The frequency of recovery of E. coli was increased in fatal cases, and mortality was highly correlated with the presence of gastrointestinal catastrophe. Ampicillin and gentamicin are the initial antibiotics of choice for neonatal sepsis at this institution; a penicillinase-resistant penicillin should be added when Staphylococcus aureus involvement is likely, and addition of chloramphenicol or clindamycin should be considered for infants at increased risk for Bacteroides fragilis sepsis.
TI  - Development of a lysis-filtration blood culture technique.
AB  - A lysed-blood culture system that quickly lyses patients' blood near neutrality and is relatively noninjurious to more delicate pathogens such as Haemophilus influenzae and Bacteroides fragilis is reported. The lysing solution includes culture medium, 0.004 M sodium carbonate and bicarbonate, 0.04% Triton X-100,and 0.6% Rhozyme (a mixture of proteases). Most of the pathogens tested multiplied in the lysing solution. The lysed blood normally is immediately filtered. The membrane is transferred to culture broth. The greatest advantage realized from this blood culture technique is separation of pathogens from antibiotics, bactericidal antibodies, complement, opsonins, and phagocytic systems. Another advantage is the concentration of organisms into a small volume of clear medium for faster growth and visualization of growth. It was observed that both gram-negative and -positive organisms were attracted during filtration to the filter material and were not removed from it by backwashing with buffer. Thus, filter membranes with porosities much larger than would nominally be expected to retain bacteria retained all or part of light and heavy Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus suspensions. Advantage may be taken of this phenomenon to use filters with larger pore sizes and avoid filter clogging by poorly lysed specimens. Porr lysis may result from addition of too much blood to the lysing solution, blood with elevated numbers of erythrocytes or leukocytes, or blood from some people whose blood is naturally more resistant to lysis.
TI  - Prophylactic lincomycin in the prevention of wound infection following appendicectomy: a double blind study.
AB  - The prophylactic use of a single dose of lincomycin in 100 patients undergoing appendicectomy reduced the incidence of postoperative wound infection from 17 to 6 per cent compared with a similar group of control patients. There was no correlation with the histological finding in the appendix, but patients with perforated appendicitis were excluded from the study. Bacteriological examination of the appendix area before surgery showed that Bacteroides fragilis and Escherichia coli were the organisms most frequently isolated. The majority of wound infections were due to B. fragilis, either alone or in association with aerobic organisms, but infection due to E. coli and Staphylococcus aureus also occurred. Systemic antibiotic therapy can successfully reduce the complications following appendicectomy but it is necessary to use a compound with activity against anaerobic organisms.
TI  - A gram stain for smears of blood cultures, body fluids and tissues.
AB  - A new Gram stain method for blood cultures was adapted from a method for tissue sections. This was accomplished by comparing various modifications of the latter method on positive smears prepared from a 24-hour negative blood culture seeded with Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. A blind study was then conducted using the new method and Hucker's method on 24-hour and 72-hour blood cultures as well as a limited number of other body fluids and tissues. Of the 35 positive blood cultures detected by the new method, the Hucker method failed to detect 14 positive specimens (40 per cent) upon initial examination. Ten additional cultures were negative using both stains, but were positive on subculture at three days. The 18 additional cultures positive after ten days were detected using only the Hucker stain.
TI  - In vitro activity of josamycin against aerobic gram-positive cocci and anaerobes.
AB  - Josamycin, a new macrolide antibiotic, was compared with ampicillin, erythromycin, and clindamycin in vitro against 25 isolates each of pneumococci, enterococci, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, and nonenterococcal hemolytic streptococci and against 25 anaerobes including 10 Bacteroides fragilis. Minimal inhibitory concentration and minimal bactericidal concentration data were obtained for the aerobic organisms, using serial twofold tube dilutions in Mueller-Hinton broth. Minimal inhibitory concentrations were determined for the anaerobes by the agar dilution technique. Josamycin was comparable to erythromycin and clindamycin in activity against the pneumococci, streptococci, and staphylococci and was more active than clindamycin against enterococci. It was somewhat less active than ampicillin against enterococci and S. epidermidis and showed its greatest in vitro activity against anaerobes, being comparable to clindamycin.
TI  - Activity of cefamandole and other cephalosporins against aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The activity of cefamandole was comparable to that of cephalothin, cefazolin, and cephaloridine against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Diplococcus pneumoniae. In contrast, cefamandole was considerably more active than cephalothin, cefazolin, or cephaloridine against gram-negative facultative bacilli, including Haemophilus influenzae, the most striking disparities being noted with indole-positive Proteus and Enterobacter. Bacteroides fragilis was more susceptible to cefoxitin than to cefamandole or cefazolin (median minimal inhibitory concentration, approximately 8, 32, and 32 mug/ml, respectively); cephalothin exhibited still less activity against this species. The majority of other anaerobes were inhibited by relatively low concentrations of all four cephalosporins. The results indicate a potentially valuable role for cefamandole against facultative gram-negative bacilli, including H. influenzae, but no exceptional activity against anaerobes.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of oxidized regenerated cellulose.
AB  - It has been demonstrated that oxidized regenerated cellulose promptly and markedly reduces the bacterial census of ten different strains of common pathogens when exposed to them in vitro. This was not true of two other hemostatic agents tested, namely, absorbable gelatin sponge and topical thrombin. Wounds in guinea pigs in which oxidized regenerated cellulose was placed and infected with one of three pathogens had healing per primum in 39 of 40 instances. In similar control wounds and incisions in which absorbable gelatin sponge was placed, sepsis of the wound developed in 19 of 20 of the control group and in 39 of 40 guinea pigs in the absorbable gelatin sponge group.
TI  - In vitro susceptibility studies with josamycin and erythromycin.
AB  - The in vitro activity of josamycin and erythromycin against five bacterial species was compared. In general, erythromycin was slightly more active by weight than josamycin, although both agents had a similar range of activity.
TI  - Survival of anaerobic and aerobic bacteria in a nonsupportive gassed transport system.
AB  - Survival of anaerobic and aerobic bacteria in a commercially available, non-supportive, gassed (oxygen-free) transport container (Anaport) was evaluated quantitatively. Saline-suspended obligate anaerobes survived significantly better in the gassed container in aerobic control tubes (P less than 0.025, t test), and counts were virtually unchanged after 8 h of holding. Similarly, initial counts and relative proportions of a mixture of Bacteroides fragilis and Staphylococcus aureus were maintained for 72 h. The value of the gassed transport system was less apparent when microorganisms were suspended in nutrient broth. The major advantage of the gassed transport system appears to be for holding of specimens collected by saline irrigation.
TI  - Combined activity of clindamycin and gentamicin on Bacteroides fragilis and other bacteria.
AB  
TI  - Survival of anaerobic and aerobic bacteria on cotton swabs in three transport systems.
AB  - The capacity of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria to survive on cotton swabs placed  into a dry gassed-out CO2-filled tube (DGT), dry sterile aerobic tube (DAT), and a tube containing a modified Stuarts' transport medium (MST), was assessed. Pseudomonas aeruginosa increased in numbers by 2 and 3 logs when stored in MST and DAT, respectively. The viability of P. aeruginosa, although retarded when compared to MSA and DAT, was not adversely affected by the CO2 environment in the DGT. The MST maintained relatively constant numbers of Streptococcus pyogenes during the 48-h storage period. The DAT and the DGT were unable to maintain the viability of S. pyogenes. Staphylococcus aureus, when stored in a DGT, DAT, or MST, was maintained in relatively constant numbers throughout the entire storage period. Of the four anaerobic bacteria evaluated (Bacteroides fragilis ssp. thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides melaninogenicus ssp. asaccharolyticus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius), only B. fragilis ssp. thetaiotamicron survived the 48-h storage period in the DGT. Under these test conditions the DGT did not adequately maintain the viability of the majority of anaerobic bacteria tested (when held on cotton swabs). However, the MST did maintain the viability of all species tested for at least the first 2 h of storage.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of aerobic and anaerobic polymorphonuclear neutrophils.
AB  - Human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) were made anaerobic by nitrogen washout (oxygen saturation <1%, Eh < -42 mV at pH 7.0), and the ability of the cells to kill bacteria was assayed and compared to the bactericidal activity of aerobic PMN. Anaerobic PMN were able to kill Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus, viridans streptococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium perfringens, and Peptococcus magnus normally. Organisms that were not killed normally by anaerobic PMN included Staphylococcus aureus (strains Wood 46 and 502a), Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, and Salmonella typhimurium. These findings suggest that mechanisms other than those dependent on hydrogen peroxide may be important in the killing of some bacteria.
TI  - Serum proteins of gnotobiotic rats.
AB  - Cellulose-acetate and agar gel immunoelectrophoresis were used to study the serum protein patterns of germfree rats before and after monoassociation with a pure culture of Staphylococcus aureus (phage type 80/81), Streptococcus faecalis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bacteroides fragilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, or Proteus vulgaris. All six bacteria quickly established themselves in the gastrointestinal tract of the germfree rat, and all six increased the animals' total serum proteins. Only S. aureus and P. aeruginosa caused a noticeable rise in gamma globulins. L. acidophilus, S. faecalis, and B. fragilis multiplied readily in the gastrointestinal tract but caused only minimal alterations in the serum proteins. P. vulgaris caused a marked increase in the alpha and beta, but not the gamma globulins.
