TI  - Anaerostipes butyraticus sp. nov., an anaerobic, butyrate-producing bacterium from Clostridium cluster XIVa isolated from broiler chicken caecal content, and emended description of the genus Anaerostipes.
AB  - Four butyrate-producing isolates were obtained from the caecal content of a 4-week-old broiler chicken. The 16S rRNA gene sequences were determined and confirmed the close relatedness of the four isolates, which suggested that they were derived from a single bacterial clone. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that its closest relatives were members of cluster XIVa of the Clostridium subphylum of Gram-positive bacteria and that the closest related type strain was Anaerostipes caccae L1-92(T) (94.5 % similarity). Similarity levels of 96-98 % with sequences from uncultured bacteria from human stool samples were observed. On the basis of morphological, biochemical and phylogenetic characteristics, this strain is assigned to a novel species in the genus Anaerostipes, for which the name Anaerostipes butyraticus sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is 35-7(T) (=LMG 24724(T) =DSM 22094(T)). An emended description of the genus Anaerostipes is also provided.
TI  - Anaerostipes caccae gen. nov., sp. nov., a new saccharolytic, acetate-utilising,  butyrate-producing bacterium from human faeces.
AB  - Two strains of a previously undescribed Eubacterium-like bacterium were isolated  from human faeces. The strains are Gram-variable, obligately anaerobic, catalase negative, asporogenous rod-shaped cells which produced acetate, butyrate and lactate as the end products of glucose metabolism. The two isolates displayed 99.9% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity to each other and treeing analysis demonstrated the faecal isolates are far removed from Eubacterium sensu stricto and that they represent a new subline within the Clostridium coccoides group of organisms. Based on phenotypic and phylogenetic criteria, it is proposed that the two strains from faeces be classified as a new genus and species, Anaerostipes caccae. The type strain of Anaerostipes caccae is NCIMB 13811T (= DSM 14662T).
