TI  - [Effect of metabolites of H2O2-producing lactobacilli on functional activity of lysozyme].
AB  - AIM: Study the effect of metabolites of H2O2-producing lactobacilli on enzymatic  and bactericidal activity of lysozyme. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 9 H2O2-producing vaginal lactobacilli, Micrococcus luteus NCTC 2665, Escherichia coli State Institute of Standardization and Control No 240367, Lactobacillus acidophilus Institute of Cellular and Intracellular Symbiosis No 37 were used. Ability of lactobacilli to produce H2O2 was evaluated by oxidation of tetramethylbenzidine by peroxidase. Lysozyme was modified by mixing with equal volumes of lactobacilli metabolites, metabolites of H2O2-producing vaginal lactobacilli previously treated with catalase were used in control. Lysozyme enzymatic activity was determined by speed of M. luteus lysis, bactericidal--by survivability of E. coli in Endo medium and L. acidophilus--in MRS medium. RESULTS: Decrease of enzymatic activity of lysozyme due to its contact with H2O2-producing lactobacilli metabolites was detected. This effect is accompanied by growth of bactericidal activity of lysozyme against E. coli and decrease against L. acidophilus. The degree of changes of enzymatic and bactericidal activity of lysozyme by lactobacilli metabolites depended on concentration of hydrogen peroxide in them. CONCLUSION: Modification of lysozyme by H2O2-producing lactobacilli metabolites resulting in opposite changes of its activity against autochthonous and allchthonous bacteria is one of the mechanisms of formation of stable microbial biocenosis in human organism.
TI  - Compound-specific nitrogen isotope analysis of D-alanine, L-alanine, and valine:  application of diastereomer separation to delta15N and microbial peptidoglycan studies.
AB  - We have developed an analytical method to determine the compound-specific nitrogen isotope compositions of individual amino acid enantiomers using gas chromatography/combustion/isotope ratio mass spectrometry. A novel derivatization of amino acid diastereomers by optically active (R)-(-)-2-butanol or (S)-(+)-2-butanol offers two advantages for nitrogen isotope analysis. First, chromatographic chiral separation can be achieved without the use of chiral stationary-phase columns. Second, the elution order of these compounds on the chromatogram can be switched by a designated esterification reaction. We applied the method to the compound-specific nitrogen isotope analysis of D- and L-alanine in a peptidoglycan derived from the cell walls of cultured bacteria (Firmicutes and Actinobacteria; Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus staphylolyticus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, and Streptomyces sp.), natural whole bacterial cells (Bacillus subtilis var. natto), (pseudo)-peptidoglycan from archaea (Methanobacterium sp.), and cell wall from eukaryota (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). We observed statistically significant differences in nitrogen isotopic compositions; e.g., delta15N ( per thousand vs air) in Staphylococcus staphylolyticus for d-alanine (19.2 +/- 0.5 per thousand, n = 4) and L-alanine (21.3 +/- 0.8 per thousand, n = 4) and in Bacillus subtilis for D-alanine (6.2 +/- 0.2 per thousand, n = 3) and L-alanine (8.2 +/- 0.4 per thousand, n = 3). These results suggest that enzymatic reaction pathways, including the alanine racemase reaction, produce a nitrogen isotopic difference in amino acid enantiomers, resulting in 15N-depleted D-alanine. This method is expected to facilitate compound-specific nitrogen isotope studies of amino acid stereoisomers.
TI  - Influence of microbial species on small intestinal myoelectric activity and transit in germ-free rats.
AB  - The effect of an intestinal microflora consisting of selected microbial species on myoelectric activity of small intestine was studied using germ-free rat models, with recording before and after specific intestinal colonization, in the unanesthetized state. Intestinal transit, neuropeptides in blood (RIA), and neuromessengers in the intestinal wall were determined. Clostridium tabificum vp 04 promoted regular spike burst activity, shown by a reduction of the migrating myoelectric complex (MMC) period from 30.5 +/- 3.9 min in the germ-free state to 21.2 +/- 0.14 min (P < 0.01). Lactobacillus acidophilus A10 and Bifidobacterium bifidum B11 reduced the MMC period from 27.9 +/- 4.5 to 21.5 +/- 2.1 min (P < 0.02) and accelerated small intestinal transit (P < 0.05). Micrococcus luteus showed an inhibitory effect, with an MMC period of 35.9 +/- 9.3 min compared with 27.7 +/- 6.3 min in germ-free rats (P < 0.01). Inhibition was indicated also for Escherichia coli X7 gnotobiotic rats. No consistent changes in slow wave frequency were observed. The concentration of neuropeptide Y in blood decreased after introduction of conventional intestinal microflora, suggesting reduced inhibitory control. Intestinal bacteria promote or suppress the initiation and aboral migration of the MMC depending on the species involved. Bacteria with primitive fermenting metabolism (anaerobes) emerge as important promoters of regular spike burst activity in small intestine.
TI  - Enhancement of lysozyme trypsin-mediated decay of intestinal bifidobacteria and lactobacilli.
AB  - Lysozyme-mediated lysis of Bifidobacteria and Lactobacilli was studied in in vitro tests using the agar gel plate and turbidometric Micrococcus luteus (lysodeikticus) procedure as a standard. Suspensions of the strains Bifidobacterium infantis, B. infantis liberorum, B. breve, B. longum, B. ssp, and Lactobacillus acidophilus proved to be resistant to egg white lysozyme and human milk lysozyme when incubated at 37 degrees C in concentrations of 5, 50, and 500 mg lysozyme/L, respectively, through 30 and 60 min. Heat treatment at 100 degrees C for 1 h and pretreatment with ether, acetone, ascorbic acid, and hydrogen peroxide failed to incline the bacteria to the lytic effects of lysozyme. Consecutive incubation of the lysozyme-pretreated bacteria with trypsin resulted in a significantly enhanced bacteriolysis in all strains of bacteria, with the exception of B. longum. The mode of action of lysozyme and proteolytic enzymes on Bifidobacteria and Lactobacilli offers an explanation for the release of microbial building blocks and their colonic absorption and retention in the breast-fed baby.

TI  - Effect of saccharin on growth and acid production of glucose-grown pathogenic and oral bacteria.
AB  - Growth and acid production of glucose-grown Gram-positive and Gram-negative rods  as well as cocci from the human oral cavity were studied in the presence of 0.02 to 20.00 mg/ml sodium saccharin. All Gram-positive rods, i.e. Actinomyces viscosus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bacillus subtilis and Corynebacterium diphtheriae, and Gram-positive cocci, i.e. Streptococcus spp, Staphylococcus aureus and Micrococcus luteus, were significantly inhibited by saccharin, especially at the higher concentrations. While Gram-negative cocci, i.e. Veillonella sp and Neisseria sicca were strongly inhibited by all tested saccharin concentrations, Gram-negative rods, i.e. the enterics and Acinetobacter sp, exhibited little if any inhibition. Saccharin caused a significant reduction in fermentative acid production congruent with observed growth.
