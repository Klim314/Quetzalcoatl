TI  == the recombinant lactococcus lactis oral vaccine induces protection against c. difficile spore challenge in a mouse model.
AB  == clostridium difficile infection (cdi) causes nosocomial antibiotic-associated diarrhea and colitis in the developed world. two potent cytotoxins, toxin a (tcda) and toxin b (tcdb) are the virulence factors of this disease and can be a  good vaccine candidate against cdi. in the present study, we genetically engineered lactococcus lactis to express the nontoxic, recombinant fragments derived from tcda and tcdb c-terminal receptor binding domains (tcd-ac and tcd-bc) as an oral vaccine candidate. the immunogenicity of the genetically engineered l. lactis oral vaccine delivery system (animal groups lac and lbc or the combination of both, lacbc) was compared with the recombinant tcda and tcdb c-terminal receptor binding domain proteins (animal groups pac and pbc or the combination of both, pacbc), which were expressed and purified from e. coli. after the c. difficile challenge, the control groups received pbs or engineered l. lactis with empty vector, showed severe diarrhea symptoms and died within 2-3  days. however, both the oral vaccine and recombinant protein vaccine groups had significantly lower mortalities, body weight decreases and histopathologic lesions than the control sham-vaccine groups (p<0.05) except group lbc which only had a 31% survival rate after the challenge. the data of post infection survival  showed that an average of 86% of animals survived in groups pac and pacbc, 75% of animals survived in group lacbc, and 65% of animals survived in group lac. all of the vaccinated animals produced higher titers of both igg and iga than the control groups (p<0.05), and the antibodies were able to neutralize the cytopathic effect of toxins in vitro. the results of this study indicate that there is a potential to use l. lactis as a delivery system to develop a cost effective oral vaccine against cdi.

TI  == the protective effect of recombinant lactococcus lactis oral vaccine on a clostridium difficile-infected animal model.
AB  == background: oral immunization with vaccines may be an effective strategy for prevention of clostridium difficile infection (cdi). however, application of previously developed vaccines for preventing cdi has been limited due to various  reasons. here, we developed a recombinant lactococcus lactis oral vaccine and evaluated its effect on a c. difficile-infected animal model established in golden hamsters in attempt to provide an alternative strategy for cdi prevention. methods: recombinant l. lactis vaccine was developed using the ptrkh2 plasmid, a  high-copy-number escherichia coli-l. shuttle vector: 1) l. lactis expressing secreted proteins was constructed with recombinant ptrkh2 (secreted-protein plasmid) carrying the usp45 signal peptide (spusp45), nontoxic adjuvanted tetanus toxin fragment c (tetc), and 14 of the 38 c-terminal repeats (14cdta) of nontoxic c. difficile toxin a (tcda); and 2) l. lactis expressing secreted and membrane proteins was constructed with recombinant ptrkh2 (membrane-anchored plasmid) carrying spusp45, tetc, 14cdta, and the cell wall-anchored sequence of protein m6 (cwam6). then, 32 male syrian golden hamsters were randomly divided into 4 groups (n = 8 each) for gavage of normal saline (blank control) and l. lactis carrying the empty shuttle vector, secreted-protein plasmid, and membrane-anchored plasmid, respectively. after 1-week gavage of clindamycin, the animals were administered with c. difficile spore suspension. general symptoms and intestinal  pathological changes of the animals were examined by naked eye and microscopy, respectively. protein levels of anti-tcda igg/iga antibodies in intestinal tissue and fluid were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). a cell culture cytotoxicity neutralization assay was done by tcda treatment with or without anti-tcda serum pre-incubation or treatment. apoptosis of intestinal epithelial cells was examined by flow cytometry (fl) assay. expression of mucosal inflammatory cytokines in the animals was detected by polymer chain reaction (pcr) assay. results: after the c. difficile challenge, the animals of control group had severe diarrhea symptoms on day 1 and all died on day 4, indicating that the cdi animal model was established in hamster. of the 3 immunization groups, secreted-protein and membrane-anchored plasmid groups had significantly lower mortalities, body weight decreases, and pathological scores, with higher survival rate/time than the empty plasmid group (p < 0.05). the tilter of igg antibody directed against tcda was significantly higher in serum and intestinal fluid of secreted-protein and membrane-anchored plasmid groups than in the empty  plasmid group (p < 0.05) while the corresponding titer of iga antibody directed against tcda had no substantial differences (p > 0.05). the anti-tcda serum of membrane-anchored plasmid group neutralized the cytotoxicity of 200 ng/ml tcda with the best protective effect achieved by anti-tcda serum pre-incubation. the incidences of tcda-induced death and apoptosis of intestinal epithelial cells were significantly reduced by cell pre-incubation or treatment with anti-tcda serum of membrane-anchored plasmid group (p < 0.05). mcp-1, icam-1, il-6, and gro-1 mrna expression levels were the lowest in cecum tissue of the membrane-anchored groups compared to the other groups. conclusion: recombinant l. lactis live vaccine is effective for preventing cdi in the hamster model, thus providing an alternative for immunization of c. difficile-associated diseases.

TI  == characterisation of the spoilage bacterial microbiota in oyster gills during storage at different temperatures.
AB  == background: the spoilage bacterial community in oyster gill was investigated during storage at 4, 10 and 20 degrees c. aerobic plate counts and ph values were determined. total bacterial dna was extracted from oyster gill and bulk cells of  plate count media. the major bacterial species during fresh or different temperatures storage were determined by polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge). results: the initial aerobic plate count in oyster gill reached 6.70 log cfu g(-1). pcr-dgge fingerprinting analysis of the 16s rrna gene v3 region revealed that most of the strains in fresh oyster gill belonged to the genera lactococcus and enterobacter. the major spoilage bacteria at a storage temperature of 20 degrees c were leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, an uncultured bacterium, cytophaga fermentans, lactococcus lactis, pseudoalteromonas sp., enterococcus mundtii, clostridium difficile and an uncultured fusobacteria; those at 10 degrees c were lactococcus spp., lactobacillus curvatus, weissella confusa and c. difficile; those at 4 degrees c  were lactococcus, weissella, enterobacter and aeromonas. the other minor species  were l. curvatus, pseudomonas sp. and e. mundtii. lactococcus spp. was the most common main spoilage bacteria in oyster gill during chilled storage. conclusion:  pcr-dgge revealed the complexity of the bacterial microbiota and the major bacteria species in oyster gill for fresh and storage.

TI  == cbpa: a novel surface exposed adhesin of clostridium difficile targeting human collagen.
AB  == clostridium difficile is the leading cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea and pseudomembranous colitis. while the role of toxins in pathogenesis has been extensively described, the contribution of surface determinants to intestinal colonization is still poorly understood. we focused our study on a novel member of the mscramm family, named cbpa (collagen binding protein a), for its adhesive  properties towards collagen. we demonstrate that cbpa, which carries an lpxtg-like cell wall anchoring domain, is expressed on the bacterial surface of c. difficile and that the recombinant protein binds at high affinity to collagens i and v (apparent kd in the order of 10(-9 ) m). these findings were validated by confocal microscopy studies showing the colocalization of the protein with type i and v collagen fibres produced by human fibroblasts and mouse intestinal tissues. however, the collagen binding activity of the wild-type c. difficile 630 strain was indistinguishable to the cbpa knock-out strain. to overcome this apparent clostridial adherence redundancy, we engineered a lactococcus lactis strain for the heterologous expression of cbpa. when exposed on the surface of l. lactis, cbpa significantly enhances the ability of the bacterium to interact with collagen and to adhere to ecm-producing cells. the binding activity of l. lactis-cbpa strain was prevented by an antiserum raised against cbpa, demonstrating the specificity of the interaction. these results suggest that cbpa is a newsurface-exposed adhesin contributing to the c. difficile interaction with the host.

TI  == kefir-isolated lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis inhibits the cytotoxic effect of  clostridium difficile in vitro.
AB  == kefir is a dairy product obtained by fermentation of milk with a complex microbial population and several health-promoting properties have been attributed to its consumption. in this work, we tested the ability of different kefir-isolated bacterial and yeast strains (lactobacillus kefir, lb. plantarum, lactococcus lactis subps. lactis, saccharomyces cerevisiae and kluyveromyces marxianus) or a mixture of them (mm) to antagonise the cytopathic effect of toxins from clostridium difficile (tcda and tcdb). cell detachment assays and f-actin network staining using vero cell line were performed. although incubation with microbial cells did not reduce the damage induced by c. difficile spent culture supernatant (scs), lc. lactis cidca 8221 and mm supernatants were able to inhibit the cytotoxicity of scs to vero cells. fraction of lc. lactis cidca 8221  supernatant containing components higher than 10 kda were responsible for the inhibitory activity and heating of this fraction for 15 min at 100 degrees c completely abrogated this ability. by dot-blot assay with anti-tcda or anti-tcdb  antibodies, concentration of both toxins seems to be reduced in scs treated with  lc. lactis cidca 8221 supernatant. however, protective effect was not affected by treatment with proteases or proteases-inhibitors tested. in conclusion, we demonstrated that kefir-isolated lc. lactis cidca 8221 secreted heat-sensitive products able to protect eukaryotic cells from cytopathic effect of c. difficile  toxins in vitro. our findings provide new insights into the probiotic action of microorganisms isolated from kefir against virulence factors from intestinal pathogens.

TI  == fate and efficacy of lacticin 3147-producing lactococcus lactis in the mammalian  gastrointestinal tract.
AB  == gastrointestinal survival of the bacteriocin-producing strain, lactococcus lactis dpc6520, was evaluated systematically in vitro and in vivo with a view to using this strain to deliver biologically active lacticin 3147, a broad-spectrum bacteriocin, to the gut. the activity of the lacticin 3147 producer was also evaluated against two clinically relevant pathogens: clostridium difficile and listeria monocytogenes. when suspended in an appropriate matrix, the lactococcal  strain is capable of surviving simulated gastrointestinal juices similar to the porcine probiotic, lactobacillus salivarius dpc6005. upon administration of l. lactis dpc6520 to pigs (n=4), excretion rates of approximately 10(2) -10(5) cfu g(-1) faeces were observed by day 5. although passage through the gastrointestinal tract (git) did not affect lacticin 3147 production by l. lactis dpc6520 isolates, activity was undetectable in faecal samples by an agar well diffusion assay. furthermore, l. lactis dpc6520 had no inhibitory effect on c. difficile or other bacterial populations in a human distal colon model, while lactococcal counts declined 10,000-fold over 24 h. the lacticin 3147 producer failed to prevent l. monocytogenes infection in a mouse model, even though a mean l. lactis dpc6520 count of 4.7 x 10(4) cfu g(-1) faeces was obtained over the 5-day administration period. these data demonstrate that l. lactis dpc6520 is capable of surviving transit through the git, and yet lacks antimicrobial efficacy in the models of infection used.

TI  == molecular characterization of a clostridium difficile bacteriophage and its cloned biologically active endolysin.
AB  == clostridium difficile infection is increasing in both frequency and severity, with the emergence of new highly virulent strains highlighting the need for more  rapid and effective methods of control. here, we show that bacteriophage endolysin can be used to inhibit and kill c. difficile. the genome sequence of a  novel bacteriophage that is active against c. difficile was determined, and the bacteriophage endolysin gene was subcloned and expressed in escherichia coli. the partially purified endolysin was active against 30 diverse strains of c. difficile, and importantly, this group included strains of the major epidemic ribotype 027 (b1/nap1). in contrast, a range of commensal species that inhabit the gastrointestinal tract, including several representatives of the clostridium-like firmicutes, were insensitive to the endolysin. this endolysin provides a platform for the generation of both therapeutic and detection systems  to combat the c. difficile problem. to investigate a method for the protected delivery and production of the lysin in the gastrointestinal tract, we demonstrated the expression of active cd27l endolysin in the lactic acid bacterium lactococcus lactis mg1363.

TI  == the clostron: a universal gene knock-out system for the genus clostridium.
AB  == progress in exploiting clostridial genome information has been severely impeded by a general lack of effective methods for the directed inactivation of specific  genes. those few mutants that have been generated have been almost exclusively derived by single crossover integration of a replication-deficient or defective plasmid by homologous recombination. the mutants created are therefore unstable.  here we have adapted a mutagenesis system based on the mobile group ii intron from the ltrb gene of lactococcus lactis (ll.ltrb) to function in clostridial hosts. integrants are readily selected on the basis of acquisition of resistance  to erythromycin, and are generated from start to finish in as little as 10 to 14  days. unlike single crossover plasmid integrants, the mutants are extremely stable. the system has been used to make 6 mutants of clostridium acetobutylicum  and 5 of clostridium difficile, exceeding the number of published mutants ever generated in these species. genes have also been inactivated for the first time in clostridium botulinum and clostridium sporogenes, suggesting the system will be universally applicable to the genus. the procedure is highly efficient and reproducible, and should revolutionize functional genomic studies in clostridia.

TI  == molecular analysis of colonized bacteria in a human newborn infant gut.
AB  == the complex ecosystem of intestinal microflora is estimated to harbor approximately 400 different microbial species, mostly bacteria. however, studies  on bacterial colonization have mostly been based on culturing methods, which only detect a small fraction of the whole microbiotic ecosystem of the gut. to clarify the initial acquisition and subsequent colonization of bacteria in an infant within the few days after birth, phylogenetic analysis was performed using 16s rdna sequences from the dna isolated from feces on the 1st, 3rd, and 6th day. 16s rdna libraries were constructed with the amplicons of pcr conditions at 30 cycles and 50 degrees c annealing temperature. nine independent libraries were produced  by the application of three sets of primers (set a, set b, and set c) combined with three fecal samples for day 1, day 3, and day 6 of life. approximately 220 clones (76.7%) of all 325 isolated clones were characterized as known species, while other 105 clones (32.3%) were characterized as unknown species. the library clone with set a universal primers amplifying 350 bp displayed increased diversity by days. thus, set a primers were better suited for this type of molecular ecological analysis. on the first day of the life of the infant, enterobacter, lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc citreum, and streptococcus mitis were present. the largest taxonomic group was l. lactis. on the third day of the  life of the infant, enterobacter, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, s. mitis, and streptococcus salivarius were present. on the sixth day of the life of the infant, citrobacter, clostridium difficile, enterobacter sp., enterobacter cloacae, and e. coli were present. the largest taxonomic group was e. coli. these results showed that microbiotic diversity changes very rapidly in the few days after birth, and the acquisition of unculturable bacteria expanded rapidly after  the third day.

TI  == in-vitro activity of nisin against clinical isolates of clostridium difficile.
AB  == nisin is a cationic peptide produced by lactococcus lactis. its activity against  clinical isolates of clostridium difficile was compared to that of vancomycin and metronidazole by minimum inhibitory concentration (mic), minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) and time-kill studies. nisin was more active than the other agents, with a mic90 of 0.256 mg/l and strong bactericidal activity. nisin may be a promising agent for the management of c. difficile associated diarrhea.

TI  == attenuation regulation of amino acid biosynthetic operons in proteobacteria: comparative genomics analysis.
AB  == candidate attenuators were identified that regulate operons responsible for biosynthesis of branched amino acids, histidine, threonine, tryptophan, and phenylalanine in gamma- and alpha-proteobacteria, and in some cases in low-gc gram-positive bacteria, thermotogales and bacteroidetes/chlorobi. this allowed us not only to describe the evolutionary dynamics of regulation by attenuation of transcription, but also to annotate a number of hypothetical genes. in particular, orthologs of ygea of escherichia coli were assigned the branched chain amino acid racemase function. three new families of histidine transporters  were predicted, orthologs of yuif and yvsh of bacillus subtilis, and lysq of lactococcus lactis. in pasteurellales, the single bifunctional aspartate kinase/homoserine dehydrogenase gene thra was predicted to be regulated not only  by threonine and isoleucine, as in e. coli, but also by methionine. in alpha-proteobacteria, the single acetolactate synthase operon ilvih was predicted to be regulated by branched amino acids-dependent attenuators. histidine biosynthetic operons his were predicted to be regulated by histidine-dependent attenuators in bacillus cereus and clostridium difficile, and by histidine t-boxes in l. lactis and streptococcus mutans.

TI  == molecular structure and evolution of the conjugative multiresistance plasmid pre25 of enterococcus faecalis isolated from a raw-fermented sausage.
AB  == plasmid pre25 from enterococcus faecalis transfers resistances against kanamycin, neomycin, streptomycin, clindamycin, lincomycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, roxithromycin, tylosin, chloramphenicol, and nourseothricin sulfate by conjugation in vitro to e. faecalis jh2-2, lactococcus lactis bu2, and listeria innocua l19. its nucleotide sequence of 50237 base pairs represents the  largest, fully sequenced conjugative multiresistance plasmid of enterococci (plasmid 46 (2001) 170). the gene for chloramphenicol resistance (cat) was identified as an acetyltransferase identical to the one of plasmid pip501 of streptococcus agalactiae. erythromycin resistance is due to a 23s ribosomal rna methyl transferase, again as found in pip501 (ermb). the aminoglycoside resistance genes are packed in tandem as in transposon tn5405 of staphylococcus aureus: an aminoglycoside 6-adenyltransferase, a streptothricin acetyl transferase, and an aminoglycoside phosphotransferase.). identical resistance genes are known from pathogens like streptococcus pyogenes, s. agalactiae, s. aureus, campylobacter coli, clostridium perfringens, and clostridium difficile. pre25 is composed of a 30.5-kbp segment almost identical to pip501. of the 15 genes involved in conjugative transfer, 10 codes for putative transmembrane proteins (e.g. trsb, trac, trsf, trsj, and trsl). the enterococcal part is joined into the pip501 part by insertion elements is1216v of e. faecium tn1545 (three copies), and homologs of is1062 (e. faecalis) and is1485 (e. faecium). pre25 demonstrates that enterococci from fermented food do participate in the molecular communication between gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria of the human and animal microflora.

TI  == identification and characteristics of nisin z-producing lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis isolated from kimchi.
AB  == we isolated bacteriocin-producing lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis from kimchi. the bacteriocin inhibited strains of clostridium perfringens, c. difficile, listeria monocytogenes, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus, and one out of four methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus strains, as well as some closely related lactic acid bacteria. in tricine-sds-page, the bacteriocin migrated with  an apparent molecular weight of about 4 kda to the same location as nisin a and crude nisin z. the gene encoding this bacteriocin was found to be identical to that of nisin z with direct pcr sequence methods. the inhibitory activity was stable against heat and ph, but it was lost at 100 degrees c for 1 h and at 121 degrees c for 15 min. the bacteriocin was inactivated by proteolytic enzymes, but was not affected by lysozyme, lipase, catalase, or beta-glucosidase. there were some differences in characteristics from those of nisins described previously.

TI  == binding of clostridium difficile surface layer proteins to gastrointestinal tissues.
AB  == clostridium difficile is the etiological agent of antibiotic-associated diarrhea, a potentially serious condition frequently affecting elderly hospitalized patients. while tissue damage is primarily induced by two toxins, the mechanism of gut colonization, and particularly the role of bacterial adherence to the mucosa, remains to be clarified. previous studies have shown binding of c. difficile whole cells to cultured cell lines and suggested the existence of multiple adhesins, only one of which has been molecularly characterized. in this  paper, we have investigated tissue binding of c. difficile surface layer proteins (slps), which are the predominant outer surface components and are encoded by the slpa gene. the adherence of c. difficile to hep-2 cells was studied by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis, which showed that antibodies to the high-molecular-weight (mw) slp inhibited adherence. immunohistochemical analysis of human gastrointestinal tissue sections revealed strong binding both to the surface epithelium lining the digestive cavities and to the subjacent lamina propria, while glands were negative. a similar pattern was observed in the mouse. by using purified recombinant slps, we show that binding is largely mediated by the high-mw slp. by western blotting analysis, we have identified two potential ligands of the c. difficile slps, one of which may be specific to the gut. by using purified extracellular matrix components immobilized on nitrocellulose, we also show slp binding to collagen i, thrombospondin, and vitronectin, but not to collagen iv, fibronectin, or laminin. these results raise the possibility that the slps play a role both in the initial colonization of the gut by c. difficile and in the subsequent inflammatory reaction.
