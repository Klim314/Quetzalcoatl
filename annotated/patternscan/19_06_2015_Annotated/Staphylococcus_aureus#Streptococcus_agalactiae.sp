TI  == a comparison of in-house real-time lamp assays with a commercial assay for the detection of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == molecular detection of bacterial pathogens based on lamp methods is a faster and  simpler approach than conventional culture methods. although different lamp-based methods for pathogenic bacterial detection are available, a systematic comparison of these different lamp assays has not been performed. in this paper, we compared 12 in-house real-time lamp assays with a commercialized kit (isothermal master mix) for the detection of listeria monocytogenes, salmonella spp, staphylococcus  aureus, escherichia coli o157, e. coli o26, e. coli o45, e. coli o103, e. coli o111, e. coli o121, e. coli o145 and streptococcus agalactiae. false-positive results were observed in all 12 in-house real-time lamp assays, while all the negative controls of isothermal master mix remained negative after amplification. the detection limit of isothermal master mix for listeria monocytogenes, salmonella spp, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli o157, e. coli o26, e. coli o45, e. coli o103, e. coli o111, e. coli o121 and streptococcus agalactiae was 1 pg, whereas the sensitivity of the commercialized kit for e. coli o145 was  100 pg. in conclusion, the 12 in-house real-time lamp assays were impractical to  use, while the commercialized kit isothermal master mix was useful for the detection of most bacterial pathogens.

TI  == selecting anti-microbial treatment of aerobic vaginitis.
AB  == aerobic vaginitis (av) is a vaginal infectious condition which is often confused  with bacterial vaginosis (bv) or with the intermediate microflora as diagnosed by nugent's method to detect bv on gram-stained specimens. however, although both conditions reflect a state of lactobacillary disruption in the vagina, leading to an increase in ph, bv and av differ profoundly. while bv is a noninflammatory condition composed of a multiplex array of different anaerobic bacteria in high quantities, av is rather sparely populated by one or two enteric commensal flora  bacteria, like streptococcus agalactiae, staphylocuccus aureus, or escherichia coli. av is typically marked by either an increased inflammatory response or by prominent signs of epithelial atrophy or both. the latter condition, if severe, is also called desquamative inflammatory vaginitis. as av is per exclusionem diagnosed by wet mount microscopy, it is a mistake to treat just vaginal culture  results. vaginal cultures only serve as follow-up data in clinical research projects and are at most used in clinical practice to confirm the diagnosis or exclude candida infection. av requires treatment based on microscopy findings and a combined local treatment with any of the following which may yield the best results: antibiotic (infectious component), steroids (inflammatory component), and/or estrogen (atrophy component). in cases with candida present on microscopy  or culture, antifungals must be tried first in order to see if other treatment is still needed. vaginal rinsing with povidone iodine can provide rapid relief of symptoms but does not provide long-term reduction of bacterial loads. local antibiotics most suitable are preferably non-absorbed and broad spectrum, especially those covering enteric gram-positive and gram-negative aerobes, like kanamycin. to achieve rapid and short-term improvement of severe symptoms, oral therapy with amoxyclav or moxifloxacin can be used, especially in deep dermal vulvitis and colpitis infections with group b streptococci or (methicillin resistant) staphylococcus aureus. since the latter colonizations are frequent, but seldom inflammatory infections, we in general discourage the use of oral antibiotics in women with av. in cases with a severe atrophy component (more than 10 % of epithelial cells are of the parabasal type), local estrogens can be used; and in postmenopausal or breast cancer patients with a contraindication for estrogens, even a combination of probiotics with an ultra-low dose of local estriol may be considered.

TI  == a c-type lectin from bothrops jararacussu venom disrupts staphylococcal biofilms.
AB  == bovine mastitis is a major threat to animal health and the dairy industry. staphylococcus aureus is a contagious pathogen that is usually associated with persistent intramammary infections, and biofilm formation is a relevant aspect of the outcome of these infections. several biological activities have been described for snake venoms, which led us to screen secretions of bothrops jararacussu for antibiofilm activity against s. aureus nrs155. crude venom was fractionated by size-exclusion chromatography, and the fractions were tested against s. aureus. biofilm growth, but not bacterial growth, was affected by several fractions. two fractions (15 and 16) showed the best activities and were  also assayed against s. epidermidis nrs101. fraction 15 was identified by tripletof mass spectrometry as a galactose-binding c-type lectin with a molecular weight of 15 kda. the lectin was purified from the crude venom by d-galactose affinity chromatography, and only one peak was observed. this pure lectin was able to inhibit 75% and 80% of s. aureus and s. epidermidis biofilms, respectively, without affecting bacterial cell viability. the lectin also exhibited a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on both bacterial biofilms. the antibiofilm activity was confirmed using scanning electron microscopy. a pre-formed s. epidermidis biofilm was significantly disrupted by the c-type lectin in a time-dependent manner. additionally, the lectin demonstrated the ability to inhibit biofilm formation by several mastitis pathogens, including different field strains of s. aureus, s. hyicus, s. chromogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, and escherichia coli. these findings reveal a new activity for c-type lectins. studies are underway to evaluate the biological activity of these lectins in a mouse mastitis model.

TI  == effects of benzalkonium chloride on planktonic growth and biofilm formation by animal bacterial pathogens.
AB  == background: resistance toward quaternary ammonium compounds (qacs) is widespread  among a diverse range of microorganisms and is facilitated by several mechanisms  such as biofilm formation. objectives: in this study, the effects of benzalkonium chloride on planktonic growth and biofilm formation by some field isolates of animal bacterial pathogens were investigated. materials and methods: forty clinical isolates of escherichia coli, salmonella serotypes, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus agalactiae (10 isolates of each) were examined for effects of benzalkonium chloride on biofilm formation and planktonic growth using microtiter plates. for all the examined strains in the presence of benzalkonium chloride, biofilm development and planktonic growth were affected at the same concentrations of disinfectant. results: the means of strains growth increase after the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) were significant in all the bacteria (except for e. coli in 1/32 and s. agalactiae in of 1/8 mic). biofilm formation increased with decrease of antiseptics concentration; a significant increase was found in all the samples. the most turbidity related to s. aureus and the least to salmonella. conclusions: bacterial resistance against quaternary ammonium compounds is increasing which can increase the bacterial biofilm formation.

TI  == [analysis of pathogenic bacteria and drug resistance in neonatal purulent meningitis].
AB  == objective: to study the clinical characteristics, pathogenic bacteria, and antibiotics resistance of neonatal purulent meningitis in order to provide the guide for early diagnosis and appropriate treatment. method: a retrospective review was performed and a total of 112 cases of neonatal purulent meningitis (male 64, female 58) were identified in the neonatal intensive care unit of yuying children's hospital of wenzhou medical university seen from january 1, 2004 to december 31, 2013. the clinical information including pathogenic bacterial distribution, drug sensitivity, head imageology and therapeutic outcome were analyzed. numeration data were shown in ratio and chi square test was applied for group comparison. result: among 112 cases, 46 were admitted from 2004 to 2008 and 66 from 2009 to 2013, 23 patients were preterm and 89 were term, 20 were early onset (occurring within 3 days of life) and 92 were late onset meningitis (occurring after 3 days of life). in 62 (55.4%) cases the pathogens were gram-positive bacteria and in 50 (44.6%) were gram-negative bacteria. the five most frequently isolated pathogens were escherichia coli (32 cases, 28.6%),  coagulase-negative staphylococcus (cns, 20 cases, 17.9%), streptococcus (18 cases, 16.1%, streptococcus agalactiae 15 cases), enterococci (13 cases, 11.6%),  staphylococcus aureus (9 cases, 8.0%). comparison of pathogenic bacterial distribution between 2004-2008 and 2009-2013 showed that gram-positive bacteria accounted for more than 50% in both period. escherichia coli was the most common  bacterium, followed by streptococcus in last five years which was higher than the first five years (22.7% (15/66) vs. 6.5% (3/46), chi(2) = 5.278, p < 0.05). klebsiella pneumoniae was more common isolate in preterm infants than in term infants (13.0% (3/23) vs. 1.1% (1/89), chi(2) = 7.540, p < 0.05). streptococcus (most were streptococcus agalactiae) was the most common bacteria in early onset  meningitis and higher than those in late onset meningitis (35.0% (7/20) vs. 12.0% (11/92), chi(2) = 4.872, p < 0.05). drug sensitivity tests showed that all the gram-positive bacterial isolates were sensitive to linezolid. staphylococci were  resistant to penicillin, and most of them were resistant to erythromycin, oxacillin and cefazolin; 77.8%of cns isolates were methicillin-resistant staphylococcus. no streptococcus and enterococcus faecalis was resistant to penicillin. none of enterococci was resistant to vancomycin. among the gram-negative bacterial isolates, more than 40% of escherichia coli were resistant to commonly used cephalosporins such as cefuroxime, cefotaxime and ceftazidime, and all of them were sensitive to amikacin, cefoperazone sulbactam and imipenem. isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae were all resistant to ampicillin, cefuroxime, cefotaxime and ceftazidime, but none of them was resistant to piperacillin tazobactam and imipenem. of the 112 patients, 69 were cured, 23 improved, 9 uncured and 11 died. there were 47 cases (42.0%) with poor prognosis, they had abnormal head imageology, severe complications and some cases died, 13 of 18 (72.2%) patients with meningitis caused by streptococcus died. conclusion:  escherichia coli, cns and streptococcus are the predominant pathogens responsible for neonatal purulent meningitis over the past ten years. there were increasing numbers of cases with streptococcus meningitis which are more common in early onset meningitis with adverse outcome, therefore careful attention should be paid in clinic. linezolid should be used as a new choice in intractable neonatal purulent meningitis cases caused by gram positive bacteria.

TI  == surrogate analysis of vancomycin to predict susceptible categorization of dalbavancin.
AB  == dalbavancin (dal) represents a recently approved addition for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (absssis). newly released antimicrobial agents are rarely found on commercial susceptibility testing devices, and surrogate testing may be an option for clinical microbiology laboratories. a total of 33,688 staphylococcus aureus, 2800 viridans group streptococci (vgs), and 5722 beta-hemolytic streptococci (bhs) were included in this cross-susceptibility (dal versus vancomycin [van]) analysis as well as 4576  coagulase-negative staphylococci and 6515 enterococci (nonindicated species groups). isolates were collected as part of the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program for the united states (usa) and europe (2011-2013). susceptibility testing followed clsi (m07-a9 and m100-s24) methods. usa food and drug administration (dal) and clsi (van) breakpoint criteria were used for correlations between dal and van susceptibility results. a categorical agreement  (ca; susceptible) rate of 99.9% was observed between dal and van when testing s.  aureus. only 48 (0.14%) very major (false-susceptible) errors were noted against  van-susceptible isolates that displayed a dal-nonsusceptible (mic, 0.25 or 0.5mug/ml) phenotype. when susceptible mic correlations were analyzed against indicated bhs species (streptococcus agalactiae and streptococcus pyogenes), an overall ca rate of 97.7-100.0% was obtained. complete (100.0%) ca was documented  for s. pyogenes, as well as against all vgs isolates, including the indicated streptococcus anginosus group (758 strains). in conclusion, high susceptible ca rates between dal and van were observed when testing a contemporary collection of indicated clinical isolates found in absssi. van-susceptible isolates can be inferred to be inhibited by dal (97.7-100.0%) at the regulatory agency-approved susceptible interpretive breakpoint of </=0.12mug/ml.

TI  == reduction of lactobacillus in the milks of cows with subclinical mastitis.
AB  == clinical and subclinical bovine mastitis are the most frequent diseases encountered on dairy farms worldwide, which cause significant economic loss and veterinary cost. the mastitic disease status is associated with increases in both milk bacterial pathogens and somatic cell count (scc). although it is well established that the mastitic pathogens generally correlate with the milk scc, to our knowledge, the correlation between the probiotic genus, lactobacillus, and the mastitic causative bacteria and scc have not been determined previously. thus, in this study, milk samples from 12 mild and 28 severe subclinical mastitic dairy cows were collected from the same farm. the overall milk bacterial load was quantified with the total plate count method. the lactobacillus genus and 4 common clinical and subclinical mastitic pathogens (escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, and trueperella pyogenes) in the sampled milk were enumerated by quantitative pcr. mild and severe subclinical mastitic samples were distinctly separated on the principal component analysis score plot generated based on the quantities of these 5 target bacteria, suggesting that clear differences existed in the microbiological composition between the two sample groups. based on comparison with the pairwise mann-whitney test, the mild subclinical mastitic dairy cows had a significantly higher amounts of lactobacilli (p=0.0175), but lower e. coli (p=0.0002), s. aureus (p<0.0001), s. agalactiae (p=0.0001) and t. pyogenes (p=0.0044) quantities, while an opposite trend occurred in the severe subclinical mastitic group. the negative correlation between lactobacillus and the pathogenic bacteria, as well as the scc, was confirmed with spearman correlation analysis. data generated from the current study may hint to a close relationship between lactobacillus and the health of bovine udder.

TI  == microbiology of pelvic lymphocyst infection after lymphadenectomy for malignant gynecologic tumors.
AB  == background: pelvic lymphocyst infection is a rare complication after lymphadenectomy for malignant gynecologic tumors. although medical therapy is a useful addition to surgical drainage, the appropriate antibiotic regimen is unknown because few studies have examined the causative organisms. the purpose of this case series was to identify the micro-organisms infecting pelvic lymphocysts. methods: this was a single-center, retrospective, case-series review conducted at a tertiary-care cancer center between october 2002 and march 2013. the participants included all patients who experienced their first pelvic lymphocyst infection after undergoing pelvic lymphadenectomy for cervical, endometrial, or ovarian cancer and exhibited positive lymphocyst fluid culture. computed tomography- or sonography-guided percutaneous aspiration procedures were performed to obtain lymphocyst fluid for culture. results: during the study period, 878 patients underwent lymphadenectomy for gynecologic malignant tumors,  and 13 developed a pelvic lymphocyst infection documented microbiologically. cultures identified staphylococcus aureus (three patients), s. epidermidis (one patient), streptococcus agalactiae (three patients), enterococcus (two patients), escherichia coli (one patient), and anaerobic bacteria (three patients). they were all monomicrobial infections. conclusions: our study and other smaller ones  suggest that lymphocyst infections following pelvic lymphadenectomy for malignant gynecologic tumors usually are monomicrobial and caused by gram-positive cocci, including staphylococcus, streptococcus, and enterococcus, and anaerobes such as  bacteroides fragilis. these bacteria should be considered when selecting empiric  antibiotic therapy.

TI  == antimicrobial protein and peptide concentrations and activity in human breast milk consumed by preterm infants at risk of late-onset neonatal sepsis.
AB  == objective: we investigated the levels and antimicrobial activity of antimicrobial proteins and peptides (amps) in breast milk consumed by preterm infants, and whether deficiencies of these factors were associated with late-onset neonatal sepsis (los), a bacterial infection that frequently occurs in preterm infants in  the neonatal period. study design: breast milk from mothers of preterm infants (</= 32 weeks gestation) was collected on days 7 (n = 88) and 21 (n = 77) postpartum. concentrations of lactoferrin, ll-37, beta-defensins 1 and 2, and alpha-defensin 5 were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. the antimicrobial activity of breast milk samples against staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, and streptococcus agalactiae was compared to the activity of infant formula, alone or supplemented with physiological levels of amps. samples of breast milk fed to infants with and without subsequent los were compared for levels of amps and inhibition of bacterial growth. results: levels of most amps and antibacterial activity in preterm breast milk were higher at day 7 than at day 21. lactoferrin was the only amp that limited pathogen growth >50% when added to formula at a concentration equivalent to that present in breast milk. levels of amps were similar in the breast milk fed to infants with and without los, however, infants who developed los consumed significantly less breast milk and lower doses of milk amps than those who were free from los. conclusions: the concentrations of lactoferrin and  defensins in preterm breast milk have antimicrobial activity against common neonatal pathogens.

TI  == heart transplantation as salvage treatment of intractable infective endocarditis.
AB  == this study reports six consecutive patients who underwent heart transplantation as salvage treatment for endocarditis (duke criteria) with extensive perivalvular lesions and end-stage heart failure. the median age was 45 years (range, 24 to 64), and the aortic valve was affected in all patients. pathogens were staphylococcus aureus (n = 2), streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 2), streptococcus agalactiae (n = 1), or not documented (n = 1). all patients survived, with no relapse, after a median follow-up of 24.5 months. the 10 patients with heart transplantation for endocarditis previously reported also survived (median follow-up, 27.5 months). heart transplantation may be considered as salvage treatment in selected patients with intractable infective endocarditis.

TI  == update of the telavancin activity in vitro tested against a worldwide collection  of gram-positive clinical isolates (2013), when applying the revised susceptibility testing method.
AB  == a revised broth microdilution susceptibility testing method for telavancin was approved by the food and drug administration (fda). telavancin activity was assessed against gram-positive pathogens collected worldwide (2013) using the revised method. a total of 12,346 isolates from 90 sites were included as part of the telavancin international surveillance program for the americas, europe, and asia-pacific. telavancin had mic50 and mic90 values of 0.03 and 0.06 mug/ml, respectively, against staphylococci, regardless of methicillin susceptibility, and inhibited all staphylococcus aureus at </=0.12 mug/ml (revised fda breakpoint). telavancin was 8-fold more active than daptomycin (mic50/90, 0.25/0.5 mug/ml) and 16- to 32-fold more active than vancomycin (mic50/90, 1/1 mug/ml) and linezolid (mic50/90, 1/1 mug/ml) against methicillin-resistant s. aureus. all 692 vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus faecalis were inhibited by telavancin (mic50/90, 0.12/0.12 mug/ml) at </=0.25 mug/ml (fda breakpoint), except for 1 strain (mic, 0.5 mug/ml). all enterococcus faecium and e. faecalis with telavancin mic values of >/=0.5 and >/=1 mug/ml, respectively, had a vana phenotype. a comparison data analysis based on the mic90 demonstrated that telavancin was at least 8-fold more potent than comparators against vancomycin-susceptible enterococci. streptococci showed telavancin mic50 values of </=0.015 mug/ml, except for streptococcus agalactiae (mic50, 0.03 mug/ml). these in vitro results obtained by the recently approved susceptibility testing method establish a new benchmark of telavancin activity worldwide.

TI  == the ongoing revolution of maldi-tof mass spectrometry for microbiology reaches tropical africa.
AB  == matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (maldi-tof) mass spectrometry (ms) represents a revolution in routine pathogen identification in clinical microbiology laboratories. a maldi-tof ms was introduced to tropical africa in the clinical microbiology laboratory of the hopital principal de dakar  (senegal) and used for routine pathogen identification. using ms, 2,429 bacteria  and fungi isolated from patients were directly assayed, leading to the identification of 2,082 bacteria (85.7%) and 206 fungi (8.5%) at the species level, 109 bacteria (4.5%) at the genus level, and 16 bacteria (0.75%) at the family level. sixteen isolates remained unidentified (0.75%). escherichia coli was the most prevalent species (25.8%) followed by klebsiella pneumoniae (14.8%), streptococcus agalactiae (6.2%), acinetobacter baumannii (6.1%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (5.9%), and staphylococcus aureus (5.9%). maldi-tof ms has also enabled the detection of rare bacteria and fungi. maldi-tof ms is a powerful tool for the identification of bacterial and fungal species involved in infectious diseases in tropical africa.

TI  == chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of essential oils of juniperus excelsa bieb. (cupressaceae) grown in r. macedonia.
AB  == background: there are no information of the yield, chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of essential oils of berries (eob) or leaves (eol) of juniperus excelsa bieb. (cupressaceae) growing wild in r. macedonia. materials and methods: plant material was collected from two localities during two seasons. essential oil composition was analyzed by gas chromatography/flame ionization detector/mass spectrometry (gc/fid/ms) and antimicrobial screening was made by disc diffusion and broth dilution method. results and discussion: eob yield ranged from 1.6-9.4 ml/kg and from 8.9-13.9 ml/kg for eol. two chemotypes of essential oil were differentiated, alpha-pinene-type (with 70.81% alpha-pinene in eob and 33.83% in eol), also containing limonene, beta-pinene and beta-myrcene while the sabinene-type (with 58.85-62.58% sabinene in eob and 28.52-29.49% in eol), was rich in alpha-pinene, beta-myrcene, limonene, cis-thujone, terpinolene  and alpha-thujene. the most sensitive bacteria to the antimicrobial activity of eob was haemophilus influenzae (mic = 31 mul/ml). eol have showed high activity towards: staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes and haemophilus influenzae (mic = 125 mul/ml). the pinene-type of essential oil showed moderate activity against streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pyogenes, corynebacterium spp. and campylobacter jejuni (mic >50%). the sabinene-type of the oil showed moderate activity to streptococcus pyogenes, haemopilus influenzae, campylobacter jejuni and escherichia coli (mic >50%). no activity was observed toward candida albicans. conclusion: the analysis of eob and eol revealed two chemotypes (alpha-pinene and sabinene type) clearly depended on the geographical origin of the macedonian juniperus excelsa which also affected the antimicrobial activity of these oils.

TI  == effects of cathode design parameters on in vitro antimicrobial efficacy of electrically-activated silver-based iontophoretic system.
AB  == post-operative infection is a major risk associated with implantable devices. prior studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of ionic silver as an alternative to antibiotic-based infection prophylaxis and treatment. the focus of this study is on an electrically activated implant system engineered for active release of antimicrobial silver ions. the objective was to evaluate the effects of the cathode design, especially the cathode material, on the in vitro antimicrobial efficacy of the system. a modified kirby-bauer diffusion technique  was used for the antimicrobial efficacy evaluations (24 h testing interval). in phase-1 of the study, a three-way anova (n = 6, alpha = 0.05) was performed to determine the effects of cathode material (silver, titanium, and stainless steel), cathode surface area and electrode separation distance on the efficacy of the system against staphylococcus aureus. the results show that within the design space tested, none of these parameters had a statistically significant effect on  the antimicrobiality of the system (p > 0.15). subsequently, one-way anova (n = 6, alpha = 0.05) was conducted in phase-2 to validate the inference regarding the non-significance of the cathode material to the system efficacy using a broader spectrum of pathogens (methicillin-resistant s. aureus, escherichia coli, streptococcus agalactiae and aspergillus flavus) responsible for osteomyelitis. the results confirmed the lack of statistical difference between efficacies of the three cathode material configurations against all pathogens tested (p > 0.58). overall, the results demonstrate the ability to alter the cathode material and related design parameters in order to minimize the silver usage in the system without adversely affecting its antimicrobial efficacy.

TI  == chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oils of pinus peuce (pinaceae) growing wild in r. macedonia.
AB  == the chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oils isolated from twigs with needles (t+n) and from twigs without needles (t-n) from  wild pinus peuce griseb. (pinaceae), from three different locations in r. macedonia, were investigated. essential oil yields of t+n ranged from 7.5 ml/kg to 12.5 ml/kg and for t-n from 13.8 ml/kg to 17.3 ml/kg. gc/fid/ms analysis of the essential oils revealed eighty-four components, representing 93.7-95.7% and 91.2-92.0% of the t+n and t-n oils, respectively. the major components in t+n and t-n oils were monoterpenes: alpha-pinene (23.8-39.9%, 21.2-23.3%), camphene (2.2-5.5%, 0.7-2.0%), beta-pinene (10.1-17.1%, 8.2-16.4%), myrcene (1.2-1.41%, 1.6-2.5%), limonene+beta-phellandrene (6.8-14.0%, 8.8-23.6%) and bornyl acetate (2.3-6.9%, 1.1-3.4%), followed by the sesquiterpenes: trans-(e)-caryophyllene (3.6-4.3%, 3.2-7.3%), germacrene d (7.1-9.5%, 5.0-10.3%) and delta-cadinene (2.1-3.1%, 3.3-4.2%, respectively). antimicrobial screening of the essential oils was made by disk diffusion and broth dilution methods against 13 bacterial isolates of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and one strain of candida albicans. t-n essential oils showed antimicrobial activity toward streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis and candida albicans as well as streptococcus agalactiae, acinetobacter spp. and haemophilus influenzae. the antimicrobial activity of t+n essential oils was greater, especially against streptococcus agalactiae, s. pyogenes, enterococcus and candida albicans, followed by haemophilus influenzae, acinetobacter spp., escherichia coli, salmonella enteritidis, staphylococcus aureus and s. epidermidis. minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of all tested essential oils ranged from 15-125  mul/ml. summarizing the obtained results, the antimicrobial activity of pinus peuce t+n and t-n essential oils collected from different localities in r. macedonia varied considerably. these alterations in the antimicrobial activity can be attributed to the differences in the quantitative composition and percentage amounts of the components present in the respective essential oils, although it was evident that there were no differences in the qualitative composition of the essential oils, regardless of the locality of collection, or the type of plant material (t+n or t-n).

TI  == reduction of teat skin mastitis pathogen loads: differences between strains, dips, and contact times.
AB  == the purpose of these experiments was to (1) assess differences in mastitis pathogen strain sensitivities to teat disinfectants (teat dips), and (2) determine the optimum time for premilking teat dips to remain in contact with teat skin to reduce pathogen loads on teat skin. two experiments were conducted using the excised teat model. in experiment 1, the differences in mastitis pathogen strain sensitivities to 4 commercially available dips (dip a: 1% h2o2; dip b: 1% chlorine dioxide; dip c: 1% iodophor; and dip d: 0.5% iodophor) were evaluated. four strains of 11 common mastitis pathogens (staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, mycoplasma bovis, streptococcus dysgalactiae, streptococcus uberis, escherichia coli, staphylococcus chromogenes, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus hyicus, staphylococcus xylosus, and staphylococcus haemolyticus) were tested. in experiment 2, the percentage log reduction of mastitis pathogens (escherichia coli, streptococcus uberis, streptococcus dysgalactiae, klebsiella species, staphylococcus chromogenes, staphylococcus haemolyticus, staphylococcus xylosus, and staphylococcus epidermidis) on teat skin with 3 commercially available teat dips: dip a; dip d;  and dip e: 0.25% iodophor, using dip contact times of 15, 30, and 45 s, was evaluated. experiment 1 results indicated significant differences in strain sensitivities to dips within pathogen species: staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus chromogenes, and streptococcus uberis. species differences were also found where mycoplasma bovis (97.9% log reduction) was the most sensitive to tested teat dips and staphylococcus haemolyticus (71.4% log reduction) the most resistant. experiment 2 results indicated that contact times of 30 and 45 s were  equally effective in reducing recovered bacteria for dips d and e and were also significantly more effective than a 15-s contact time. no differences were seen in recovered bacteria between tested contact times after treatment with dip a. it can be concluded that different mastitis pathogen species and strains within species may possess different sensitivities to teat dips, which may have implications in selection of teat dips on dairies. furthermore, a 30-s premilking dip contact time for iodophors and 15 s for h2o2 dips may be optimal in reducing  pathogen load in the shortest amount of time. a reduction in premilking teat dip  contact time may improve milking parlor efficiency.

AB  == the development of a bacteria-inducible expression system has several advantages  compared with persistent expression of anti-bacterial proteins in milk to prevent and treat mastitis. the present study determined whether mastitis responsive promoters could regulate enhanced green fluorescent protein (egfp) expression in  goat mammary epithelial cells (gmecs) in response to challenges with escherichia  coli, staphylococcus aureus or streptococcus agalactiae. the level of expression  of interleukin (il)-1alpha was significantly increased in gmecs challenged with e. coli, s. aureus or s. agalactiae compared with untreated gmecs. il-1beta was induced by e. coli and s. aureus, while toll-like receptor 2 (tlr2) was induced by e. coli only. gmecs were transfected with il-1alpha, il-1beta and tlr2 promoter-egfp reporter gene lentiviral expression vectors and the levels of expression of egfp were measured by flow cytometry and western blot analysis after bacterial challenge. egfp expression driven by the il-1alpha and il-1beta promoters was higher in gmecs challenged with e. coli, s. aureus or s. agalactiae than in untreated gmecs. there were no differences in egfp expression driven by the tlr2 promoter between gmecs challenged with s. aureus or s. agalactiae and untreated gmecs, but egfp expression was significantly increased in gmecs challenged with e. coli. overall, these results indicate that the promoters of some bacteria-inducible genes can regulate egfp expression in gmecs in response to bacterial challenges. this bacteria-inducible expression strategy could be used for production of mastitis resistant animals by regulating the expression of anti-bacterial proteins in the mammary gland.

TI  == influence of sequence mismatches on the specificity of recombinase polymerase amplification technology.
AB  == recombinase polymerase amplification (rpa) technology relies on three major proteins, recombinase proteins, single-strand binding proteins, and polymerases,  to specifically amplify nucleic acid sequences in an isothermal format. the performance of rpa with respect to sequence mismatches of closely-related non-target molecules is not well documented and the influence of the number and distribution of mismatches in dna sequences on rpa amplification reaction is not  well understood. we investigated the specificity of rpa by testing closely-related species bearing naturally occurring mismatches for the tuf gene sequence of pseudomonas aeruginosa and/or mycobacterium tuberculosis and for the  cfb gene sequence of streptococcus agalactiae. in addition, the impact of the number and distribution of mismatches on rpa efficiency was assessed by synthetically generating 14 types of mismatched forward primers for detecting five bacterial species of high diagnostic relevance such as clostridium difficile, staphylococcus aureus, s. agalactiae, p. aeruginosa, and m. tuberculosis as well as bacillus atropheus subsp. globigii for which we use the spores as internal control in diagnostic assays. a total of 87 mismatched primers were tested in this study. we observed that target specific rpa primers with mismatches (n > 1) at their 3'extrimity hampered rpa reaction. in addition, 3 mismatches covering both extremities and the center of the primer sequence negatively affected rpa yield. we demonstrated that the specificity of rpa was multifactorial. therefore its application in clinical settings must be selected and validated a priori. we recommend that the selection of a target gene must consider the presence of closely-related non-target genes. it is advisable to choose target regions with a high number of mismatches (>/=36%, relative to the size of amplicon) with respect to closely-related species and the best case scenario would be by choosing a unique target gene.

TI  == outcome of patients over 80 years of age on prolonged suppressive antibiotic therapy for at least 6 months for prosthetic joint infection.
AB  == objectives: to describe elderly patients treated with prolonged suppressive antibiotic therapy for a prosthetic joint infection (pji) in cases where the infected prosthesis could not be removed. methods: all patients aged >/=80 years  with a documented pji and treated with prolonged suppressive antibiotic therapy for more than 6 months were included retrospectively in this study. the following events were noted: failure including persisting infection, relapse, new infection, treatment discontinuation due to severe adverse events, and related death, and also unrelated death. results: thirty-eight patients with a median age of 84 years (80-95 years) were included; there were 24 hip infections, 13 knee infections, and one shoulder infection. the main causative organisms were staphylococcus aureus (39%) and streptococcus agalactiae (16%). the most commonly prescribed antibiotics as prolonged suppressive therapy were penicillins. the median follow-up duration was 24 months; 60% of the patients were event-free at 24 months and were still on prolonged suppressive antibiotic therapy. fifteen events (six failures and nine unrelated deaths) were observed. hypoalbuminaemia,  the presence of a sinus tract, and a staphylococcal pji were associated with an increased risk of an event. conclusions: prolonged suppressive antibiotic therapy is an alternative therapy in elderly patients with pji when surgery is contraindicated and when the bacteria are susceptible to well-tolerated oral antimicrobial therapy such as beta-lactams.

TI  == antibacterial compounds from salvia adenophora fernald (lamiaceae).
AB  == from the aerial parts of salvia adenophora fernald four derivatives of 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid (1-4) together with five clerodane diterpenoids (5, 6, 8-10), and one known diterpene (7) have been isolated. compounds 1-6 and 8-10 are described for the first time. the structures were established by extensive 1d, 2d nmr and hresi-tofms spectroscopic methods. finally, the absolute configuration has been established by comparing of experimental and quantum chemical calculation of ecd spectra. despite a total lack of antimicrobial activity of the plant extract, hinting to the existence of antagonistic interactions in the crude material, three oxylipins (2-4) displayed a promising inhibition on gram-positive multidrug-resistant clinical strains including staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae and, particularly, staphylococcus epidermidis, while the compounds 9 and 10 revealed a specific and strain-dependent activity against s. epidermidis. interestingly, the inhibition provided by these compounds was independent of the resistance patterns of these pathogens to classic antibiotics. no action was reported on gram-negative strains nor on candida albicans. these results confirm that clerodanes and, particularly, prostaglandin-like compounds can be considered as interesting antimicrobial agents deserving further study.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of azd0914, a new spiropyrimidinetrione dna gyrase/topoisomerase inhibitor with potent activity against gram-positive, fastidious gram-negative, and atypical bacteria.
AB  == azd0914 is a new spiropyrimidinetrione bacterial dna gyrase/topoisomerase inhibitor with potent in vitro antibacterial activity against key gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus agalactiae), fastidious gram-negative (haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae), atypical (legionella pneumophila), and anaerobic (clostridium difficile) bacterial species, including  isolates with known resistance to fluoroquinolones. azd0914 works via inhibition  of dna biosynthesis and accumulation of double-strand cleavages; this mechanism of inhibition differs from those of other marketed antibacterial compounds. azd0914 stabilizes and arrests the cleaved covalent complex of gyrase with double-strand broken dna under permissive conditions and thus blocks religation of the double-strand cleaved dna to form fused circular dna. whereas this mechanism is similar to that seen with fluoroquinolones, it is mechanistically distinct. azd0914 exhibited low frequencies of spontaneous resistance in s. aureus, and if mutants were obtained, the mutations mapped to gyrb. additionally, no cross-resistance was observed for azd0914 against recent bacterial clinical isolates demonstrating resistance to fluoroquinolones or other drug classes, including macrolides, beta-lactams, glycopeptides, and oxazolidinones. azd0914 was bactericidal in both minimum bactericidal concentration and in vitro time-kill studies. in in vitro checkerboard/synergy testing with 17 comparator antibacterials, only additivity/indifference was observed. the potent in vitro antibacterial activity (including activity against fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates), low frequency of resistance, lack of cross-resistance, and bactericidal activity of azd0914 support its continued development.

TI  == molecular and bacteriological investigation of subclinical mastitis caused by staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus agalactiae in domestic bovids from ismailia, egypt.
AB  == a study was carried out to establish the prevalence of subclinical mastitis (scm) in smallholder dairy farms in ismailia, egypt. a total of 340 milking cows and buffaloes were sampled from 60 farms, and 50 nasal swabs were collected from consenting farm workers. milk samples were subjected to california mastitis test  (cmt) and the positive samples were examined by bacterial culture and pcr to identify etiological agents. based on cmt, the prevalence of scm was 71.6 % in cattle and 43.5 % in buffaloes while the prevalence was 25.2 % at cow-quarter level and 21.7 % at buffaloes-quarter level. bacteriological analysis showed that the most frequently identified bacteria were staphylococcus (s.) aureus (38.3 %)  and streptococcus (str.) agalactiae (20 %). the diagnostic sensitivity of pcr compared to bacterial culture was superior with s. aureus and str. agalactiae detection being 41 and 22.6 %, respectively. furthermore, methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) strains occurred in 52.2 and 45 % of isolates of animals and workers, respectively. subclinical mastitis due to s. aureus and str. agalactiae  is endemic in smallholder dairy herds in ismailia. the occurrence of mrsa in animals and workers highlights a need for wide epidemiological studies of mrsa and adopting control strategies.

TI  == effectiveness of the two microorganisms lactobacillus fermentum lf15 and lactobacillus plantarum lp01, formulated in slow-release vaginal tablets, in women affected by bacterial vaginosis: a pilot study.
AB  == background: bacterial vaginosis (bv) is the most common reason for abnormal vaginal discharge in reproductive-age women and one of its most important causative agents is the gram-variable bacterium gardnerella vaginalis. bv is not  accompanied by significant local inflammation, whereas the "fishy odor" test is always positive. in contrast, aerobic vaginitis (av) is predominantly associated  with escherichia coli, but streptococcus agalactiae and staphylococcus aureus are also involved. standard treatment of bv consists of oral or intravaginal antibiotics, although these are unable to spontaneously restore normal flora characterized by a high concentration of lactobacilli. the main limitation is the inability to offer a long-term defensive barrier, thus facilitating relapses and  recurrences. this study was undertaken firstly to assess the ability of selected  lactobacilli to in vitro antagonize g. vaginalis to determine an association with a strain able to inhibit e. coli, thus identifying a possible use in av. the second step of the study was to conduct a human pilot trial in women affected by  bv using an association of the most promising and active bacteria. materials and  methods: for this purpose, neutralized supernatants of individual lactobacilli were tested at percentages ranging from 0.5% to 4% to determine their ability to  hinder the growth of g. vaginalis american type culture collection 10231. the bacterium that was able to exert the strongest inhibition was subsequently tested with lactobacillus plantarum lp01 in a human intervention, placebo-controlled, pilot trial involving 34 female subjects (aged between 18 and 50, mean 34.7+/-8.9, no menopausal women) diagnosed with bv. the 2 microorganisms lactobacillus fermentum lf15 (dsm 26955) and l. plantarum lp01 (lmg p-21021) were delivered to the vagina by means of slow-release vaginal tablets, also containing 50 mg of tara gum. the amount of each strain was 400 million live cells per dose. the women were instructed to apply a vaginal tablet once a day for 7 consecutive  nights, followed by 1 tablet every 3 nights for a further 3-week application (acute phase) and, finally, 1 tablet per week to maintain a long-term vaginal colonization against possible recurrences. a clinical examination was performed and the nugent score was quantified for each patient at enrollment (d0), after 28 days (d28), and at the end of the second month of relapse prevention (d56). a statistical comparison was made between d28, or d56, and d0, and between d56 and  d28 to quantify the efficacy against possible recurrences. results: l. fermentum  lf15 showed the strongest in vitro inhibitory activity towards g. vaginalis american type culture collection (atcc) 10231 after both 24 and 48 hours. in the  human trial, the 2 lactobacilli selected, namely l. fermentum lf15 and l. plantarum lp01, significantly reduced the nugent score below the threshold of 7 after 28 days in 22 patients of 24 in the active group (91.7%, p<0.001). eight women (33.3%) recorded a nugent score between 4 and 6, evidence of an intermediate situation, whereas the remaining 14 (58.3%) showed a score <4, therefore suggesting the restoration of physiological vaginal microbiota. at the  end of the second month, only 4 women registered a nugent score >7, definable as  bv (16.7%, p=0.065 compared with d28). in the placebo group, no significant differences were recorded at any time. conclusions: bv, also known as vaginal bacteriosis is the most common cause of vaginal infection in women of childbearing age. furthermore, bv is often asymptomatic as about 50% of women with this condition have no symptoms at all and the prevalence rate in apparently healthy women is around 10%. this study suggests the ability of the 2 strains l.  fermentum lf15 and l. plantarum lp01 to counteract acute gardnerella infections effectively and significantly improve the related uncomfortable symptoms in a very high percentage of women. this could be partially attributed to the presence of tara gum, which is able to create a mechanical barrier against gardnerella on  the surface of vaginal mucosa as a primary mechanism. furthermore, long-term physiological protection seems to be established, thanks to the integration of the 2 lactobacilli into the vaginal microbiota and to their adhesion to the epithelial cells of the mucosa. in the light of the additional in vitro inhibitory activity against e. coli, their prospective use in av could also prove interesting.

TI  == antibacterial efficacy of recombinant siganus oramin l-amino acid oxidase expressed in pichia pastoris.
AB  == siganus oraminl-amino acid oxidase is a novel natural protein (named sr-laao) isolated from serum of the rabbitfish (s. oramin), which showed antibacterial activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and had a lethal effect on the parasites cryptocaryon irritans, trypanosoma brucei brucei and ichthyophthirius multifiliis. in order to test whether recombinant sr-laao (rsr-laao) produced by the eukaryotic expression system also has antimicrobial activity, the yeast pichia pastoris was used as the expression host to obtain rsr-laao in vitro. crude rsr-laao produced by p. pastoris integrated with the sr-laao gene had antibacterial activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria as shown by inhibition zone assay of the antibacterial spectrum on agar plates. the average diameter of the inhibition zone of crude rsr-laao against the gram-positive bacteria staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus agalactiae was 1.040 +/- 0.045 cm and 1.209 +/- 0.085 cm, respectively. for the gram-negative bacteria aeromonas sobria, escherichia coli,  vibrio alginolyticus, vibrio cholera and photobacterium damselae subsp. piscicida, the average diameter of inhibition zone was 1.291 +/- 0.089 cm, 0.943  +/- 0.061 cm, 0.756 +/- 0.057 cm, 0.834 +/- 0.023 cm and 1.211 +/- 0.026 cm, respectively. these results were obtained at the logarithmic growth phase of s. agalactiae and a. sobria cell suspensions after incubation with 0.5 mg/ml crude rsr-laao for 24 h. the final bacterial growth rate was decreased significantly. the relative inhibition rate can reach 50% compared to crude products from p. pastoris integrated with an empty vector at the same concentration of protein. the antimicrobial activity of crude rsr-laao was likely associated with h2o2 formation, because its inhibition zones were disturbed significantly by catalase. scanning electron microscopy results showed crude rsr-laao-treated bacterial surfaces became rough and particles were attached, cell walls were retracted and  cell membranes were ruptured. together, the results of this study indicated rsr-laao from the p. pastoris expression system is a potential antibiotic for application as a therapeutic agent against bacterial diseases.

TI  == plasma components and platelet activation are essential for the antimicrobial properties of autologous platelet-rich plasma: an in vitro study.
AB  == autologous platelet concentrates are successfully adopted in a variety of medical fields to stimulate bone and soft tissue regeneration. the rationale for their use consists in the delivery of a wide range of platelet-derived bioactive molecules that promotes wound healing. in addition, antimicrobial properties of platelet concentrates have been pointed out. in this study, the effect of the platelet concentration, of the activation step and of the presence of plasmatic components on the antimicrobial activity of pure platelet-rich plasma was investigated against gram positive bacteria isolated from oral cavity. the antibacterial activity, evaluated as the minimum inhibitory concentration, was determined through the microdilution two-fold serial method. results seem to suggest that the antimicrobial activity of platelet-rich plasma against enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus oralis and staphylococcus aureus is sustained by a co-operation between plasma components and platelet-derived factors and that the activation of coagulation is a fundamental step. the findings of this study may have practical implications in the modality of application of platelet concentrates.

TI  == comparative study of bacteriological culture and real-time fluorescence quantitative pcr (rt-pcr) and multiplex pcr-based reverse line blot (mpcr/rlb) hybridization assay in the diagnosis of bacterial neonatal meningitis.
AB  == background: bacterial meningitis is more common in the neonatal period than any other time in life; however, it is still a challenge for the evidence based diagnosis. strategy for identification of neonatal bacterial meningitis pathogens is presented by evaluating three different available methods to establish evidence-based diagnosis for neonatal bacterial meningitis. methods: the cerebrospinal fluid samples from 56 neonates diagnosed as bacterial meningitis in 2009 in beijing children's hospital were analyzed in the study. two pcr based molecular assays, real-time fluorescence quantitative pcr (rt-pcr) and multiplex  pcr based-reverse line blot hybridization (mpcr/rlb), were used to assess 7 common neonatal meningitis bacterial pathongens, including escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, listerisa monocytogenes, neisseria meningitidis, haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, and streptococcus agalactiae. the findings in examinations of two assays were compared with the results obtained bacterial culture tests. results: bacterial meningitis was identified in five cases (9%) by csf cultures, 25 (45%) by rt-pcr and 16 (29%) by mpcr/rlb. one strain of s. epidermidis and one of e. faecalis were identified using mpcr/rlb but not by rt-pcr. in contrast, cultures identified one strain of s. pneumoniae which was missed by both pcr assays. overall, the bacterial pathogens in 28 cases were identified with these three methods. both rt-pcr and mpcr/rlb assays were more sensitive than bacterial culture, (p < 0.05). conclusion: our study confirmed that both rt-pcr and mpcr/rlb assays have better sensitivity than bacterial culture. they are capable of detecting the pathogens in csf samples with negative culture results.

TI  == development of a multiplex real-time pcr assay for the rapid diagnosis of neonatal late onset sepsis.
AB  == the diagnosis of late onset sepsis (los), a severe condition with high prevalence in preterm infants, is hampered by the suboptimal sensitivity and long turnaround time of blood culture. detection of the infecting pathogen directly in blood by pcr would provide a much more timely result. unfortunately, pcr-based assays reported so far are labor intensive and often lack direct species identification. therefore we developed a real-time multiplex pcr assay tailored to los diagnosis  which is easy-to-use, is applicable on small blood volumes and provides species-specific results within 4h. species-specific pcr assays were selected from literature or developed using bioinformatic tools for the detection of the most prevalent etiologic pathogens: enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus spp., streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella spp. and serratia marcescens. the pcr assays showed 100% specificity, full coverage of the target pathogens and a limit of detection (lod) of </=10cfueq./reaction. these lod values were maintained in the multiplex format or when bacterial dna was isolated from blood. clinical evaluation showed high concordance between the multiplex pcr and blood culture. in conclusion, we developed a multiplex pcr that allows the direct detection of the most important  bacterial pathogens causing los in preterm infants.

TI  == subterfuge and sabotage: evasion of host innate defenses by invasive gram-positive bacterial pathogens.
AB  == the development of a severe invasive bacterial infection in an otherwise healthy  individual is one of the most striking and fascinating aspects of human medicine. a small cadre of gram-positive pathogens of the genera streptococcus and staphylococcus stand out for their unique invasive disease potential and sophisticated ability to counteract the multifaceted components of human innate defense. this review illustrates how these leading human disease agents evade host complement deposition and activation, impede phagocyte recruitment and activation, resist the microbicidal activities of host antimicrobial peptides and reactive oxygen species, escape neutrophil extracellular traps, and promote and accelerate phagocyte cell death through the action of pore-forming cytolysins. understanding the molecular basis of bacterial innate immune resistance can open  new avenues for therapeutic intervention geared to disabling specific virulence factors and resensitizing the pathogen to host innate immune clearance.

AB  == for more than 30 yr, a control plan for streptococcus agalactiae and staphylococcus aureus has been carried out in more than 1,500 dairy herds of the  province of brescia (northern italy). from 2010 to 2011, the apparent prevalence  of strep. agalactiae has been relatively stable around 10%, but the apparent prevalence of staph. aureus has been greater than 40% with an increasing trend. the aim of this paper was to estimate and compare the diagnostic accuracy of 3 assays for the detection of strep. agalactiae and staph. aureus in bulk-tank milk samples (btms) in field conditions. the assays were a qualitative and a quantitative bacteriological culture (bc) for each pathogen and a homemade multiplex real-time pcr (rt-pcr). because a gold standard was not available, the  sensitivities (se) and specificities (sp) were evaluated using a bayesian latent  class approach. in 2012 we collected one btms from 165 dairy herds that were found positive for strep. agalactiae in the previous 2-yr campaigns of eradication plan. in most cases, btms collected in these herds were positive for  staph. aureus as well, confirming the wide spread of this pathogen. at the same time we also collected composite milk samples from all the 8,624 lactating cows to evaluate the within-herd prevalence of strep. agalactiae. streptococcus agalactiae samples were cultured using a selective medium tallium kristalviolette tossin, whereas for staph. aureus, we used baird parker modified medium with added rabbit plasma fibrinogen iso-formulation. in parallel, btms were tested using the rt-pcr. regarding strep. agalactiae, the posterior median of se and sp  of the 2 bc was similar [qualitative bc: se=98%, posterior credible interval (95%pci): 94-100%, and sp=99%, 95%pci: 96-100%; quantitative bc: se=99%, 95%pci:  96-100%, and sp=99%, 95%pci: 95-100%] and higher than those of the rt-pcr (at 40  cycle threshold, se=92%, 95%pci: 85-97%; sp=94%, 95%pci: 88-98%). also in case of staph. aureus, the posterior medians of bc were generally higher than those of rt-pcr. in fact, although the se of bc was slightly lower (rt-pcr at 40 cycle threshold, median se=99%, 95%pci: 97-100%, and qualitative bc, median se=94%, 95%pci: 87-99%), the sp was much higher (rt-pcr at 40 cycle threshold, median sp=67%, 95%pci: 38-97%; qualitative bc, median sp=95%; 95%pci: 76-100%). our study confirms that bc and rt-pcr are reliable diagnostic tools to detect strep.  agalactiae and staph. aureus, and rt-pcr results should be confirmed by bc carried out on btms and possibly on composite milk samples.

TI  == electrospun doxy-h loaded-poly(acrylic acid) nanofiber mats: in vitro drug release and antibacterial properties investigation.
AB  == electrospun doxy-h loaded-poly(acrylic acid) (paa) nanofiber mats (paa/doxy-h nanofiber mats) were prepared by the electrospinning technique and post-spinning  sorption method at various doses: paa/doxy-h125, paa/doxy-h250, paa/doxy-h500, and paa/doxy-h1000. the morphology, drug content, release characteristics, and antibacterial activities of the paa/doxy-h nanofiber mats were investigated with  scanning electron microscopy, uv-vis spectrophotometry, and disc diffusion methodology. the paa/doxy-h nanofiber mats had a diameter range of 285-340 nm, and a smooth surface without beads. adsorption isotherms of doxy-h could be described well with the freundlich model. the amounts of doxy-h, after the post-spinning sorption process, in the paa/doxy-h nanofiber mats ranged between 27.57 and 101.71 mg/g. all of the paa/doxy-h nanofiber mats exhibited an initial  burst release characteristic with cumulative releasing percentages between 37.14  and 45.97%, which followed the fickian diffusion mechanism. based on the antibacterial investigation, the tested gram-positive bacteria, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus agalactiae, seemed to be more sensitive to paa/doxy-h nanofiber mats than the tested gram-negative bacteria, pseudomonas aeruginosa. these paa/doxy-h nanofiber mats could be used as an antibacterial wound dressing.

TI  == establishing a list of qualifying pathogens under the food and drug administration safety and innovation act. final rule.
AB  == the food and drug administration (fda or agency) is issuing a regulation to establish a list of "qualifying pathogens'' that have the potential to pose a serious threat to public health. this final rule implements a provision of the generating antibiotic incentives now (gain) title of the food and drug administration safety and innovation act (fdasia). gain is intended to encourage  development of new antibacterial and antifungal drugs for the treatment of serious or life-threatening infections, and provides incentives such as eligibility for designation as a fast-track product and an additional 5 years of  exclusivity to be added to certain exclusivity periods. based on analyses conducted both in the proposed rule and in response to comments to the proposed rule, fda has determined that the following pathogens comprise the list of ``qualifying pathogens:'' acinetobacter species, aspergillus species, burkholderia cepacia complex, campylobacter species, candida species, clostridium difficile, coccidioides species, cryptococcus species, enterobacteriaceae (e.g.,  klebsiella pneumoniae), enterococcus species, helicobacter pylori, mycobacterium  tuberculosis complex, neisseria gonorrhoeae, n. meningitidis, non-tuberculous mycobacteria species, pseudomonas species, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, and vibrio cholerae. the preamble to the  proposed rule described the factors the agency considered and the methodology used to develop the list of qualifying pathogens. as described in the preamble of this final rule, fda applied those factors and that methodology to additional pathogens suggested via comments on the proposed rule.

TI  == silver sucrose octasulfate (iasos) as a valid active ingredient into a novel vaginal gel against human vaginal pathogens: in vitro antimicrobial activity assessment.
AB  == this in vitro study assessed the antimicrobial properties of a novel octasilver salt of sucrose octasulfate (iasos) as well as of an innovative vaginal gel containing iasos (silsos femme), against bacterial and yeast pathogens isolated from human clinical cases of symptomatic vaginal infections. in bhi and lapt culture media, different ionic silver concentrations and different phs were tested. iasos exerted a strong antimicrobial activity towards all the pathogens tested in both culture media. the results demonstrated that salts and organic compounds present in the culture media influenced iasos efficacy only to a moderate extent. whereas comparable mbcs (minimal bactericidal concentrations) were observed for g. vaginalis (10 mg/l ag+), e. coli and e. aerogenes (25 mg/l ag+) in both media, higher mbcs were found for s. aureus and s. agalactiae in lapt cultures (50 mg/l ag+ versus 25 mg/l ag+). no minimal concentration totally  inhibiting the growth of c. albicans was found. nevertheless, in both media at the highest ionic silver concentrations (50-200 mg/l ag+), a significant 34-52% drop in candida growth was observed. ph differently affected the antimicrobial properties of iasos against bacteria or yeasts; however, a stronger antimicrobial activity at ph higher than the physiological ph was generally observed. it can be therefore concluded that iasos exerts a bactericidal action against all the tested bacteria and a clear fungistatic action against c. albicans. the antimicrobial activity of the whole vaginal gel silsos femme further confirmed the antimicrobial activity of iasos. overall, our findings support iasos as a valid active ingredient into a vaginal gel.

TI  == synthesis and biological activities of novel pleuromutilin derivatives with a substituted thiadiazole moiety as potent drug-resistant bacteria inhibitors.
AB  == a series of novel pleuromutilin derivatives possessing thiadiazole moieties were  synthesized via acylation reactions under mild conditions. the in vitro antibacterial activities of the derivatives against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, and streptococcus agalactiae were tested by the agar dilution method and oxford cup assay. the majority of the tested compounds displayed moderate antibacterial activities. importantly, the three compounds with amino or tertiary amine groups in their side chains, 11, 13b, and 15c, were the most active antibacterial agents. docking experiments carried out on the peptidyl transferase center (ptc) of 23s rrna proved that there is a reasonable direct correlation between the binding free energy (deltagb, kcal/mol) and the antibacterial activity. moreover, the pharmacokinetic profiles of 11 and 15c in rat were characterized by moderate clearance and oral bioavailability.

TI  == mastitogenic bacteria isolated from dairy cows in kenya and their antimicrobial sensitivity.
AB  == there is limited epidemiological knowledge on udder health in kenyan dairy cattle that would aid in a pro-active approach towards mastitis prevention. the study objectives were: (1) to investigate the prevalence and distribution of clinical and subclinical mastitis in dairy cattle in mukurwe-ini and nakuru districts, kenya, and (2) to determine the antibacterial sensitivity of the organisms causing bovine mastitis in these districts. the study involved field-screening of milk samples from 241 dairy cows on 128 farms by use of the california mastitis test (cmt) and, if cmt-positive, followed by bacteriological culture of the major causative agents and their respective antibiotic sensitivity to eight commonly used antibiotics. all participating farms were visited twice during the study period. the results obtained during the first and second visits showed the prevalence of clinical mastitis to be very low: 0.9% and 0.5%, respectively; 56.0% and 65.0% of cows were cmt-positive on at least one quarter and 49.6% and 58.7% of cows were culture-positive, respectively. there was no significant difference in mastitis prevalence between nakuru and mukurwe-ini districts (p &gt; 0.10). staphylococcus aureus was isolated in 68.0% and 77.0% of samples during the first and second visits, respectively. other frequently isolated agents included streptococcus agalactiae, and other streptococcus spp., s. aureus and s. agalactiae were most sensitive to gentamycin and norfloxacin, and least sensitive to cotrimazole and ampicillin. knowing the prevalence of mastitogenic organisms and their antibiotic sensitivities could improve treatment efficacy and cow longevity.

TI  == staphylococcus pseudintermedius for camp-test.
AB  == camp test reliably detects listeria monocytogenes (lm) and streptococcus agalactiae (group b streptococcus, gbs); it is traditionally performed streaking  the tested isolate perpendicularly to staphylococcus aureus (sa), provided that reference sa strains (that produce beta-hemolysin) are used. in a zone of beta-hemolysin activity, in fact, gbs and lm form typical arrow-shaped hemolytic  areas. while sa production of the toxin is strain-dependent, however, that of staphylococcus pseudintermedius (sp), a pet-owner colonizer and an emerging human pathogen, is constitutive, then observed in all clinical isolates. therefore, sp  may indeed represent a valid alternative to perform the assay.

TI  == colloidal gold-based immunochromatographic strip test compromising optimised combinations of anti-s. suis capsular polysaccharide polyclonal antibodies for detection of streptococcus suis.
AB  == a rapid diagnosis kit that detects streptococcus suis (s. suis) antigens from urine with an immunochromatographic stripe (ics) test was developed in this study. the ics test was produced using colloidal gold coated with polyclonal antibodies (pabs) against s. suis. the pabs were developed from rabbits immunised with s. suis serotype 2 capsular polysaccharides (cps). development of the pabs was investigated to establish their binding to cps and to determine the maximum sensitivity of two combination antibodies for the ics test. the results of the ics optimisation revealed that the combinations of pab c-n1 and pab c-n2 had the  highest sensitivity to cps. the minimum limitation of ics sensitivity indicated 1.0 x 10(4) colony forming units (cfu) and a cps concentration of 0.05 microg. the assay time for detection of s. suis antigens is less than 15 min, which is suitable for rapid detection. a cross-reactive test was also conducted, and it detected no other bacteria (streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus agalactiae, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and klebsiella pneumoniae). the cross-reactivity of other serotypes in s. suis was also investigated, and tests for serotypes of 1, 1/2, 3, 4, 5, 6,  7, 8, 9, 14, and 16 were positive. this study presents the first report of a development of an ics that enables the quantitative detection of streptococcal antigens. the s. suis ics provides several advantages over other methods, including the speed and simplicity of use.

TI  == herd- and cow-level risk factors associated with subclinical mastitis in dairy farms from the high plains of the northern antioquia, colombia.
AB  == mastitis is the main disease entity affecting dairy farms in the colombian high plains of northern antioquia, colombia. however, no previous epidemiologic studies have determined the characteristics that increase the risk of infection in this region, where manual milking is still the prevailing system of milking. a 24-mo longitudinal study was designed to identify the predominant mastitis pathogens and important herd- and cow-level risk factors. monthly visits were made to 37 commercial dairy farms to collect herd- and cow-level data and milk samples. herd size varied from 6 to 136 cows (mean 37.0, median 29). herd-level factors included type of milking system (manual or mechanical) and a range of management practices recommended by the national mastitis council (madison, wi) to prevent mastitis. individual cow-level risk factors included parity, stage of  lactation, breed, udder hygiene, and lameness. a logistic regression analysis was used to investigate associations between herd- and cow-level risk factors with the presence of subclinical mastitis and infection caused by streptococcus agalactiae at the quarter level. a quarter was considered to have subclinical mastitis if it had a positive california mastitis test and was subsequently confirmed to have a somatic cell count of >/=200,000 cells/ml. any cow with one or more quarters with subclinical mastitis was considered to have subclinical mastitis at the cow level. using 17,622 cow observations, the mean prevalence of  subclinical mastitis at the cow level was 37.2% (95% confidence interval: 31.2, 43.3) for the first month and did not substantially change throughout the study.  the predominant microorganisms isolated from quarters meeting the subclinical mastitis definition were contagious pathogens, including strep. agalactiae (34.4%), corynebacterium spp. (13.2%), and staphylococcus aureus (8.0%). significant variables associated with subclinical mastitis risk at the quarter level included being a purebred holstein cow, higher parity, and increased months in milk. variables that were protective for mastitis risk included being a crossbreed cow and adequate premilking udder hygiene. significant variables associated with strep. agalactiae infection were higher parity, increased months  in milk, and manual milking. variables that were protective were postmilking teat dipping and adequate cleaning of the udder. the results highlight the importance  of hygiene practices in contagious mastitis control in manually milked herds.

TI  == evaluation of the minnesota easy culture system ii bi-plate and tri-plate for identification of common mastitis pathogens in milk.
AB  == the objective of this study was to validate use of the minnesota easy culture system ii bi-plate and tri-plate (university of minnesota laboratory for udder health, st. paul) to identify common mastitis pathogens in milk. a total of 283 quarter and composite milk samples submitted to the university of minnesota laboratory for udder health during the spring of 2010 were cultured simultaneously using 3 methods: standard laboratory culture (reference method) and the minnesota easy culture system ii bi-plate and tri-plate methods. bi-plate and tri-plate cultures were incubated for 18 to 24h and interpreted by 2 independent, untrained readers within 5h of each other. an experienced technician completed the standard laboratory culture. for each sample, all 3 study personnel recorded the culture result (yes/no) for each of the following diagnostic categories: no bacterial growth (ng), mixed (2 organisms), contaminated (3 or more organisms), gram-positive (gp), gram-negative (gn), staphylococcus spp., streptococcus spp., streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus dysgalactiae, streptococcus uberis, enterococcus spp., staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., and other. for each category, the prevalence, sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and predictive values of a positive and negative test were calculated, and the agreement between readers and between each reader and the laboratory was assessed. specificity, overall accuracy, and negative predictive values were generally high (>80%) for the bi-plate and tri-plate for each category. sensitivity and positive predictive values were intermediate (>60%) or high (>80%) for the broad categories of ng, gp, gn, staphylococcus spp. and streptococcus spp., and for staph. aureus, but were generally lower (<60%) for other more specific categories. similarly, interreader agreement (kappa value) was moderate to substantial (40-80%) for the broad categories of ng, gp, gn, staphylococcus spp. and streptococcus spp., and for staph. aureus and e. coli, but was lower for other categories. the tri-plate had a higher sensitivity, accuracy, and negative predictive value for streptococcus spp., and higher interreader agreement for some of the more specific categories. our conclusion was that bi-plate and tri-plate results will be most reliable when used to classify infections in broad diagnostic categories such ng, gp, or gn. the bi-plate and tri-plate will have intermediate ability to identify infections as being caused by staphylococcus spp., streptococcus spp., or staph. aureus.

TI  == efficacy of on-farm use of ultraviolet light for inactivation of bacteria in milk for calves.
AB  == ultraviolet light is being employed for bacterial inactivation in milk for calves; however, limited evidence is available to support the claim that uv light effectively inactivates bacteria found in milk. thus, the objective of this observational study was to investigate the efficacy of on-farm uv light treatment in reducing bacteria populations in waste milk used for feeding calves. samples of nonsaleable milk were collected from 9 pennsylvania herds, twice daily for 15  d, both before and after uv light treatment (n=60 samples per farm), and analyzed for standard plate count, coliforms, noncoliform, gram-negative bacteria, environmental and contagious streptococci, coagulase-negative staphylococci, streptococcus agalactiae, staphylococcus aureus count, and total solids percentage, and log reduction and percentage log reduction were calculated. data  were analyzed using the mixed procedure in sas. in all bacteria types, samples collected after uv treatment contained significantly fewer bacteria compared with samples collected before uv treatment. weighted least squares means for log reduction (percentage log reduction) were 1.34 (29%), 1.27 (58%), 1.48 (53%), 1.85 (55%), 1.37 (72%), 1.92 (63%), 1.07 (33%), and 1.67 (82%) for standard plate count, coliforms, noncoliform, gram-negative bacteria, environmental and contagious streptococci, strep. agalactiae, coagulase-negative staphylococci, and staph. aureus, respectively. a percentage log reduction greater than 50% was achieved in 6 of 8 bacteria types, and 43 and 94% of samples collected after uv treatment met recommended bacterial standards for milk for feeding calves. based  on these results, uv light treatment may be effective for some, but not all bacteria types found in nonsaleable waste milk. thus, farmers should take into account the bacteria types that may need to be reduced when considering the purchase of a uv-treatment system.

TI  == investigation of the antimicrobial activity of bacillus licheniformis strains isolated from retail powdered infant milk formulae.
AB  == this study investigated the potential antimicrobial activity of ten bacillus licheniformis strains isolated from retail infant milk formulae against a range of indicator (lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus bulgaricus and listeria innocua)  and clinically relevant (listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, salmonella typhimurium and escherichia coli) microorganisms. deferred antagonism assays confirmed that all b. licheniformis isolates show antimicrobial activity against the gram-positive target organisms.  pcr and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry analyses indicated that four of the b. licheniformis isolates produce the bacteriocin lichenicidin. the remaining six isolates demonstrated a higher antimicrobial potency than lichenicidin-producing strains. further analyses identified a peptide of ~1,422 da as the most likely bioactive responsible for the antibacterial activity of these six isolates. n-terminal sequencing of the ~1,422 da peptide from one strain identified it as ilpeitxifhd. this peptide shows a high homology to the non-ribosomal peptides bacitracin and subpeptin, known to be produced by bacillus spp. subsequent pcr analyses demonstrated that the six b. licheniformis isolates may harbor the genetic machinery needed for the synthesis of a non-ribosomal peptide synthetase similar  to those involved in production of subpeptin and bacitracin, which suggests that  the ~1,422 da peptide might be a variant of subpeptin and bacitracin.

AB  == raw milk and colostrum can harbor dangerous microorganisms that can pose serious  health risks for animals and humans. according to the usda, more than 58% of calves in the united states are fed unpasteurized milk. the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of uv light on reduction of bacteria in milk and colostrum, and on colostrum igg. a pilot-scale uv light continuous (uvc) flow-through unit (45 j/cm(2)) was used to treat milk and colostrum. colostrum and sterile whole milk were inoculated with listeria innocua, mycobacterium smegmatis, salmonella serovar typhimurium, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, and acinetobacter baumannii before being treated with uvc. during uvc treatment, samples were collected at 5 time points and bacteria were enumerated using selective media. the effect of uvc on igg was  evaluated using raw colostrum from a nearby dairy farm without the addition of bacteria. for each colostrum batch, samples were collected at several different time points and igg was measured using elisa. the uvc treatment of milk resulted  in a significant final count (log cfu/ml) reduction of listeria monocytogenes (3.2 +/- 0.3 log cfu/ml reduction), salmonella spp. (3.7 +/- 0.2 log cfu/ml reduction), escherichia coli (2.8 +/- 0.2 log cfu/ml reduction), staph. aureus (3.4 +/- 0.3 log cfu/ml reduction), streptococcus spp. (3.4 +/- 0.4 log cfu/ml reduction), and a. baumannii (2.8 +/- 0.2 log cfu/ml reduction). the uvc treatment of milk did not result in a significant final count (log cfu/ml) reduction for m. smegmatis (1.8 +/- 0.5 log cfu/ml reduction). the uvc treatment  of colostrum was significantly associated with a final reduction of bacterial count (log cfu/ml) of listeria spp. (1.4 +/- 0.3 log cfu/ml reduction), salmonella spp. (1.0 +/- 0.2 log cfu/ml reduction), and acinetobacter spp. (1.1 +/- 0.3 log cfu/ml reduction), but not of e. coli (0.5 +/- 0.3 log cfu/ml reduction), strep. agalactiae (0.8 +/- 0.2 log cfu/ml reduction), and staph. aureus (0.4 +/- 0.2 log cfu/ml reduction). the uvc treatment of colostrum significantly decreased the igg concentration, with an observed final mean igg reduction of approximately 50%. development of new methods to reduce bacterial contaminants in colostrum must take into consideration the barriers imposed by its opacity and organic components, and account for the incidental damage to igg  caused by manipulating colostrum.

TI  == is there a need for bacterial endocarditis prophylaxis in patients undergoing urological procedures?
AB  == heart valve repair or replacement is a serious problem.the focused update on infective endocarditis of american college of cardiology/american heart association 2008 (acc/aha guidelines) and guidelines on the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of infective endocarditis (new version 2009) of the european society of cardiology (esc guidelines) describe prophylaxis against infective endocarditis as not recommended for urinary tract procedures in the absence of active infection. a statistical association has been recently shown between urological procedures and the development of infective endocarditis. new  evidences concerning infective endocarditis due to actinobaculum schaalii, neisseria gonorrhoeae, streptococcus agalactiae, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, aerococci and staphylococcus aureus, and new findings indicate there is a need for bacterial endocarditis prophylaxis in patients undergoing urological procedures especially in elderly patients and in cancer and immunocompromised patients, to avoid serious consequences.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo effects of beneficial vaginal lactobacilli on pathogens responsible for urogenital tract infections.
AB  == the aim of this work was to evaluate the effects of beneficial human vaginal lactobacilli (lb) on urogenital pathogens through in vitro and in vivo experiments. co-aggregative and antimicrobial properties between five vaginal lb  strains and urogenital pathogens or potential pathogens (streptococcus agalactiae, staphylococcus aureus and candida albicans strains) were assayed. also, associative cultures of lb strains and s. agalactiae were performed and bacterial growth, ph, lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide (h2o2) were determined at different times. based on the results obtained, the in vivo studies were assayed  in mice with lactobacillus gasseri crl 1509 or lactobacillus salivarius crl 1328  inoculated intravaginally (i.v.) and then challenged i.v. with s. agalactiae. results were analysed by anova (repeated measures and general linear models). most of the lb strains increased the percentage of aggregation of s. agalactiae strains. only one strain (lactobacillus reuteri crl 1324) positively affected the aggregation of s. aureus and none increased the aggregation of c. albicans. the inhibition of the growth of s. agalactiae strains by production of organic acids  by lactobacilli was evidenced. the lb-s. agalactiae co-cultures showed a significant inhibition of the pathogen after 4 h and 8 h of incubation. parallel  increases in lactic acid and h2o2 levels were observed. however, in the experimental murine model, no significant differences were obtained in the number of streptococci recovered from the vaginal tract of control mice and those inoculated with lb. in conclusion, vaginal lb exhibited in vitro co-aggregative and antimicrobial effects on s. agalactiae strains, suggesting that they could be promising candidates for protection against s. agalactiae challenge. however, as  these effects were not evidenced in the murine model used, further animal studies under different experimental conditions should be conducted to evaluate the preventive effect of lb against challenge with s. agalactiae.

TI  == trends in bacterial, mycobacterial, and fungal meningitis in england and wales 2004-11: an observational study.
AB  == background: meningitis remains one of the most feared infectious diseases worldwide, yet there are few population-based studies on the epidemiology, causes, or trends over time in meningitis, especially in industrialised countries. our aim was to do such a study using routinely reported data available in england and wales. methods: in england and wales, uk national health service hospitals routinely report laboratory-confirmed pathogens electronically to public health england. records of all positive bacterial, mycobacterial, and fungal results from cerebrospinal fluid or from blood cultures in patients with clinical meningitis were extracted for analysis. the percentage change in annual  incidence was estimated using linear regression analysis of the log of the annual incidence. findings: during 2004-11, 7061 cases of meningitis were reported (mean annual incidence 1.62 per 100,000 people, 95% ci 1.58-1.66), including 2594 cases in children (37%). the incidence of bacterial (1.44 per 100,000 people, 1.41-1.48), fungal (0.09, 0.08-0.10), and mycobacterial (0.09, 0.08-0.09) meningitis remained stable overall and across the age groups, apart from significant year-on-year increases in children younger than 3 months (978 cases;  incidence 72.2 per 100,000 people; annual increase 7.4%, 5.1-9.8; p<0.0001) driven mainly by group b streptococci (gbs), and in adults aged 65 years or older (752 cases; incidence 1.2 per 100,000 people; annual increase 3.0%, 1.4-4.8; p<0.0001) primarily because of escherichia coli. by contrast, meningococcal meningitis rates declined steadily, but remained the most common cause of meningitis in children. overall, five groups of bacteria accounted for 60% (3790/6286) of bacterial meningitis cases: neisseria meningitidis (1350 cases, 22%), streptococcus pneumoniae (1143, 18%), staphylococcus aureus (652, 10%), gbs (326, 5%), and e coli (319, 5%). interpretation: in england and wales, laboratory-based surveillance shows a remarkably stable incidence of bacterial, fungal, and mycobacterial meningitis in recent years, although there were differences in individual trends among the main pathogens causing meningitis in different age groups. funding: none.

TI  == trends in diagnosis and control of bovine mastitis: a review.
AB  == mastitis (inflammation of mammary gland) is a most devastating disease condition  in terms of economic losses occurring throughout the world. the etiological agents may vary from place to place depending on climate; animal species and animal husbandry and include wide variety of gram positive and gram negative bacteria; and fungi. they may be either contagious viz. staphylococcus aureus; streptococcus agalactiae or environmental viz. s. dysgalactiae, s. uberis, corynebacterium bovis and coagulase negative staphylococcus. conventional diagnostic tests viz. california mastitis test (cmt); r-mastitest and mast-o-test methods are applied under field conditions; whereas somatic cell count and bulk tank somatic cell count (btscc) are useful for early mastitis detection and detection of sub clinical or chronic mastitis respectively. in vitro culture based diagnosis require further study as they can detect only viable cells. the advent of polymerase chain reaction (pcr) technology along with its various versions like multiplex and real time pcr has improved the rapidity and sensitivity of diagnosis. circulating micro rna (mirna) based diagnosis; immune assay and proteomics based detection along with biochips and biosensors prove to  be asset to diagnosticians for advanced diagnosis of this economically important  condition. improvement of milking hygiene; implementation of post-milking teat disinfection; regular control of the milking equipments; implementation of milking order; improvement of bedding material are the general measures to prevent new cases of mastitis. the use of antibiotics (intramammary infusions; bacteriocins) and herbs (terminalia spp.) are important for prophylaxis and therapeutics. vaccines viz. cell based; recombinant (staphylococcal enterotoxin type c mutant) or chimeric (paua); live (s. uberis 0140j stain based) and bacterial surface extract based; dna-based and dna-protein based have greatly aided in management of bovine mastitis. quorum sensing and disease resistant breeding using novel biomarkers viz. toll like receptors (tlr) 2 and 4, interleukin (il) 8; breast cancer type 1 susceptibility protein (brca1) and calcium channel voltage-dependent alpha 2/delta sub unit 1 (cacna2d1) are also indispensable. this mini review gives an overview of all these different aspects  that act as trend setters as far as the diagnosis and control of bovine mastitis  is concerned to help the diagnosticians; epidemiologists and researchers not to remain ignorant about this grave condition.

TI  == properties of an arcanobacterium haemolyticum strain isolated from a donkey.
AB  == the present study was designed to characterize phenotypically and genotypically an arcanobacterium haemolyticum strain (a. haemolyticum p646) isolated from a purulent nasal discharge of a donkey. a. haemolyticum p646 showed, compared to sheep blood, an enhanced hemolytic reaction on rabbit blood agar, a synergistic camp-like reaction with streptococcus agalactiae and rhodococcus equi as indicator strains, a reverse camp reaction in the zone of staphylococcus aureus beta-hemolysin and the typical biochemical properties of this species. the species identity could be confirmed by maldi-tof ms analysis, by sequencing the 16s rdna and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase encoding gene gap and by amplification of a. haemolyticum specific parts of 16s-23s rdna intergenic spacer region and 23s rdna. a. haemolyticum p646 and the reference strain a. haemolyticum dsm 20595 were further characterized by amplification of the putative virulence genes encoding arcanolysin, phospholipase d, hemolysin a, camp factor family protein, a collagen binding protein and two neuraminidases which were present for a. haemolyticum dsm 20595. a. haemolyticum p646 showed a comparable gene spectrum but was negative for the genes encoding collagen binding protein and neuraminidase h. to our knowledge, the present study is the first phenotypic and genotypic characterization of an a. haemolyticum strain isolated from a donkey.

TI  == cost-effectiveness of diagnostic strategies using quantitative real-time pcr and  bacterial culture to identify contagious mastitis cases in large dairy herds.
AB  == diagnostic strategies to detect contagious mastitis caused by mycoplasma bovis, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus agalactiae in dairy herds during an outbreak have been minimally studied with regard to cost and diagnostic sensitivity. the objective of this cross-sectional study was to compare the cost-effectiveness of diagnostic strategies for identification of infected cows in two california dairy herds during contagious mastitis outbreaks. m. bovis was  investigated in a subset of a herd (n=1210 cows) with an estimated prevalence of  2.8% (95% ci=1.9, 3.7), whereas staph. aureus and strep. agalactiae were studied  in a second herd (n=351 cows) with an estimated prevalence of 3.4% (95% ci=1.5, 5.3) and 16.8% (95% ci=12.9, 20.7), respectively. diagnostic strategies involved  a combination of testing stages that utilized bacterial culture, quantitative real-time pcr (qpcr), or both. strategies were applied to individual or pooled samples of 5, 10, 50 or 100 samples. culture was considered the gold standard for sensitivity estimation of each strategy. the reference strategy was the strategy  with the lowest cost per culture-positive cow which for both m. bovis and strep.  agalactiae consisted of 2 stages, culture of samples in pools of 5 followed by culture of individual samples in positive pools with a sensitivity of 73.5% (95%  ci: 55.6, 87.1) and 96.6% (95% ci: 27.7, 84.8), respectively. the reference strategy for staph. aureus consisted of 3 stages, culture of individual samples in pools of 100 (stage 1), culture constituents of those positive from stage 1 in pools of 5 (stage 2), culture constituents of those positive from stage 2 individually (stage 3) which resulted in a sensitivity of 58.3% (95% ci: 88.3, 99.6). the most cost-effective alternative to the reference strategy was whole herd milk culture for all 3 pathogens. qpcr testing was a component of the second most cost-effective alternative for m. bovis and the third most cost-effective alternatives for the 3 pathogens. a stochastic model was used to assess the effect of prevalence or herd size on the cost-effectiveness of diagnostic strategies. in the current study, increasing the prevalence of mastitis did not alter the ranking of strategies by cost-effectiveness. however, larger herds could benefit from testing larger pools such as 50 or 100 samples to improve cost-effectiveness. several diagnostic strategy options exist to identify contagious mastitis in herds, decisions should be based on cost and sensitivity of the strategies available.

TI  == intensive mutagenesis of the nisin hinge leads to the rational design of enhanced derivatives.
AB  == nisin a is the most extensively studied lantibiotic and has been used as a preservative by the food industry since 1953. this 34 amino acid peptide contains three dehydrated amino acids and five thioether rings. these rings, resulting from one lanthionine and four methyllanthionine bridges, confer the peptide with  its unique structure. nisin a has two mechanisms of action, with the n-terminal domain of the peptide inhibiting cell wall synthesis through lipid ii binding and the c-terminal domain responsible for pore-formation. the focus of this study is  the three amino acid 'hinge' region (n 20, m 21 and k 22) which separates these two domains and allows for conformational flexibility. as all lantibiotics are gene encoded, novel variants can be generated through manipulation of the corresponding gene. a number of derivatives in which the hinge region was altered have previously been shown to possess enhanced antimicrobial activity. here we take this approach further by employing simultaneous, indiscriminate site-saturation mutagenesis of all three hinge residues to create a novel bank of nisin derivative producers. screening of this bank revealed that producers of peptides with hinge regions consisting of aak, nai and sls displayed enhanced bioactivity against a variety of targets. these and other results suggested a preference for small, chiral amino acids within the hinge region, leading to the  design and creation of producers of peptides with hinges consisting of aaa and saa. these producers, and the corresponding peptides, exhibited enhanced bioactivity against lactococcus lactis hp, streptococcus agalactiae atcc 13813, mycobacterium smegmatis mc2155 and staphylococcus aureus rf122 and thus represent the first example of nisin derivatives that possess enhanced activity as a consequence of rational design.

TI  == antibiotic use during pregnancy alters the commensal vaginal microbiota.
AB  == antibiotics may induce alterations in the commensal microbiota of the birth canal in pregnant women. therefore, we studied the effect of antibiotic administration  during pregnancy on commensal vaginal bacterial colonization at gestational week  36. six hundred and sixty-eight pregnant women from the novel unselected copenhagen prospective studies on asthma in childhood (copsac2010 ) pregnancy cohort participated in this analysis. detailed information on oral antibiotic prescriptions during pregnancy filled at the pharmacy was obtained and verified prospectively. vaginal samples were obtained at pregnancy week 36 and cultured for bacteria. women who received oral antibiotics during any pregnancy trimester  had an increased rate of colonization by staphylococcus species in the vaginal samples as compared with samples obtained from women without any antibiotic treatment during pregnancy (adjusted or 1.63, 95% ci 1.06-2.52, p 0.028). oral antibiotic administration in the third trimester were also associated with increased colonization by staphylococcus species (adjusted or 1.98, 95% ci 1.04-3.76, p 0.037). these bacteriological changes were associated with urinary tract infection antibiotics. women treated in the third trimester of pregnancy were more often colonized by escherichia coli than women without antibiotic treatment in the third trimester (adjusted or 1.91, 95% ci 1.04-3.52, p 0.038). this change was associated with respiratory tract infection (rti) antibiotics. we did not observe any significant changes in vaginal streptococcus agalactiae (group b streptoccocus) or staphylococcus aureus colonization following antibiotic treatment in pregnancy. antibiotic administration during pregnancy leads to alterations in the vaginal microbiological ecology prior to birth, with  potential morbidity, and long-term effects on the early microbial colonization of the neonate.

TI  == in vitro characterization of plysk1249, a novel phage lysin, and assessment of its antibacterial activity in a mouse model of streptococcus agalactiae bacteremia.
AB  == beta-hemolytic streptococcus agalactiae is the leading cause of bacteremia and invasive infections. these diseases are treated with beta-lactams or macrolides,  but the emergence of less susceptible and even fully resistant strains is a cause for concern. new bacteriophage lysins could be promising alternatives against such organisms. they hydrolyze the bacterial peptidoglycan at the end of the phage cycle, in order to release the phage progeny. by using a bioinformatic approach to screen several beta-hemolytic streptococci, a gene coding for a lysin was identified on a prophage carried by streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis sk1249. the gene product, named plysk1249, harbored an original three-domain structure with a central cell wall-binding domain surrounded by an n-terminal amidase and a c-terminal chap domain. purified plysk1249 was highly lytic and bactericidal for s. dysgalactiae (2-log10 cfu/ml decrease within 15 min). moreover, it also efficiently killed s. agalactiae (1.5-log10 cfu/ml decrease within 15 min) but not several streptococcal commensal species. we further investigated the activity of plysk1249 in a mouse model of s. agalactiae  bacteremia. eighty percent of the animals (n = 10) challenged intraperitoneally with 10(6) cfu of s. agalactiae died within 72 h, whereas repeated injections of  plysk1249 (45 mg/kg 3 times within 24 h) significantly protected the mice (p < 0.01). thus, plysk1249, which was isolated from s. dysgalactiae, demonstrated high cross-lytic activity against s. agalactiae both in vitro and in vivo. these  encouraging results indicated that plysk1249 might represent a good candidate to  be developed as a new enzybiotic for the treatment of systemic s. agalactiae infections.

TI  == in vitro activity of ceftaroline-avibactam against gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens isolated from patients in canadian hospitals from 2010 to 2012: results from the canward surveillance study.
AB  == the in vitro activities of ceftaroline-avibactam, ceftaroline, and comparative agents were determined for a collection of bacterial pathogens frequently isolated from patients seeking care at 15 canadian hospitals from january 2010 to december 2012. in total, 9,758 isolates were tested by using the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) broth microdilution method (document m07-a9, 2012), with mics interpreted by using clsi breakpoints (document m100-s23, 2013). ceftaroline-avibactam demonstrated potent activity (mic90, </= 0.5 mug/ml) against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca,  proteus mirabilis, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, morganella morganii, citrobacter freundii, and haemophilus influenzae; >99% of isolates of e. coli, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, c. freundii, and h. influenzae were susceptible to ceftaroline-avibactam according to clsi mic interpretative criteria for ceftaroline. ceftaroline was less active than ceftaroline-avibactam against all species of enterobacteriaceae tested, with rates of susceptibility ranging from 93.9% (p. mirabilis) to 54.0% (s. marcescens). all isolates of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mic90, 0.25 mug/ml) and 99.6% of methicillin-resistant s. aureus isolates (mic90, 1 mug/ml) were susceptible to ceftaroline; the addition of avibactam to ceftaroline did not alter its activity  against staphylococci or streptococci. all isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae (mic90, 0.03 mug/ml), streptococcus pyogenes (mic90, </= 0.03 mug/ml), and streptococcus agalactiae (mic90, 0.015 mug/ml) tested were susceptible to ceftaroline. we conclude that combining avibactam with ceftaroline expanded its spectrum of activity to include most isolates of enterobacteriaceae resistant to  third-generation cephalosporins, including extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)- and ampc-producing e. coli and esbl-producing k. pneumoniae, while maintaining potent activity against staphylococci and streptococci.

TI  == rapid detection of gram-positive organisms by use of the verigene gram-positive blood culture nucleic acid test and the bact/alert pediatric fan system in a multicenter pediatric evaluation.
AB  == assays that expedite the reporting of organism identification and antibiotic susceptibility status in positive blood cultures can fast track interventions that improve clinical outcomes. we evaluated the verigene gram-positive blood culture nucleic acid test (bc-gp) in two pediatric hospitals. positive bact/alert pediatric fan blood cultures with gram-positive organisms were tested using the bc-gp in tandem with routine laboratory procedures. to test organisms underrepresented in the clinical blood culture evaluation, blood culture bottles  were spiked with diluted organism suspensions at concentrations of 10 to 100 cfu  per milliliter. a total of 249 gram-positive bacterial isolates were recovered from 242 blood cultures. the bc-gp detected staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-susceptible s. aureus, and methicillin-resistant s. aureus with sensitivities of 100%, 99%, and 100% and specificities of 100%, 100%, and 99.5%,  respectively. the bc-gp detected staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-susceptible s. epidermidis, and methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis  with sensitivities of 95%, 80%, and 96%, respectively, and 100% specificity. the  bc-gp correctly identified 14/15 cases of enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus  faecium bacteremia and 9 cases of streptococcus pneumoniae. it misidentified 5/15 clinical blood cultures with streptococcus mitis/streptococcus oralis and 1/3 blood cultures spiked with streptococcus anginosus group as s. pneumoniae. the bc-gp detected a case of streptococcus pyogenes bacteremia but failed to detect 2/3 clinical blood cultures with streptococcus agalactiae. bc-gp's rapid accurate detection of staphylococcus spp., e. faecium, and e. faecalis and its ability to  ascertain meca, vana, and vanb status may expedite clinical decisions pertaining  to optimal antibiotic use. false-positive s. pneumoniae results may warrant reporting of only "streptococcus spp." when this organism is reported by the bc-gp.

TI  == menaquinone analogs inhibit growth of bacterial pathogens.
AB  == gram-positive bacteria cause serious human illnesses through combinations of cell surface and secreted virulence factors. we initiated studies with four of these organisms to develop novel topical antibacterial agents that interfere with growth and exotoxin production, focusing on menaquinone analogs. menadione, 1,4-naphthoquinone, and coenzymes q1 to q3 but not menaquinone, phylloquinone, or coenzyme q10 inhibited the growth and to a greater extent exotoxin production of  staphylococcus aureus, bacillus anthracis, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus agalactiae at concentrations of 10 to 200 mug/ml. coenzyme q1 reduced the ability of s. aureus to cause toxic shock syndrome in a rabbit model, inhibited the growth of four gram-negative bacteria, and synergized with another  antimicrobial agent, glycerol monolaurate, to inhibit s. aureus growth. the staphylococcal two-component system srra/b was shown to be an antibacterial target of coenzyme q1. we hypothesize that menaquinone analogs both induce toxic  reactive oxygen species and affect bacterial plasma membranes and biosynthetic machinery to interfere with two-component systems, respiration, and macromolecular synthesis. these compounds represent a novel class of potential topical therapeutic agents.

TI  == prospective survey of acute osteoarticular infections in a french paediatric orthopedic surgery unit.
AB  == the epidemiology of acute paediatric osteoarticular infections (oai) has recently evolved, mainly due to the improvement of microbiological diagnosis. we conducted a prospective study to analyse the recent epidemiology and the clinical evolution of paediatric oai in order to validate the adequacy of our probabilistic first-line antibiotic treatment (intraveinous cefamandole + gentamicin). all children suspected of community acquired oai were included and followed-up for 3  years. the etiologic diagnosis was based on blood cultures, joint aspirations and bone punctures. all osteoarticular (oa) samples were systematically inoculated into blood culture bottles. real-time universal 16s rrna and pcr targeted on staphylococcus aureus, kingella kingae, streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes were performed twice a week. from 17 march 2007 to 26 february 2009, 98 septic arthritis, 70 osteomyelitis, 23 osteoarthritis and six spondylodiscitis were analysed. a portal of entry was suspected in 44% of cases,  including 55% of otorhinolaryngological infections. c reactive protein was the most sensitive inflammatory marker. pcr increased by 54% the performance of bacteriological diagnosis. among the patients completely investigated (blood culture and oai samples), there were 63% documented oai. the main pathogens found were k. kingae (52%), s. aureus (28%), s. pyogenes (7%), s. pneumoniae (3%) and streptococcus agalactiae (2%). all isolated bacteria were sensitive to the probabilist treatment and outcome was favorable. pcr has significantly improved the performance and the delay of ioa diagnosis in children, for which k. kingae turned out to be the first causative agent. the probabilistic treatment was active against the main bacteria responsible for paediatric oai.

TI  == improved protease stability of the antimicrobial peptide pin2 substituted with d-amino acids.
AB  == cationic antimicrobial peptides (amps) have attracted a great interest as novel class of antibiotics that might help in the treatment of infectious diseases caused by pathogenic bacteria. however, some amps with high antimicrobial activities are also highly hemolytic and subject to proteolytic degradation from  human and bacterial proteases that limit their pharmaceutical uses. in this work  a d-diastereomer of pandinin 2, d-pin2, was constructed to observe if it maintained antimicrobial activity in the same range as the parental one, but with the purpose of reducing its hemolytic activity to human erythrocytes and improving its ability to resist proteolytic cleavage. although, the hydrophobic and secondary structure characteristics of l- and d-pin2 were to some extent similar, an important reduction in d-pin2 hemolytic activity (30-40 %) was achieved compared to that of l-pin2 over human erythrocytes. furthermore, d-pin2  had an antimicrobial activity with a mic value of 12.5 mum towards staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, streptococcus agalactiae and two strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa in agar diffusion assays, but it was half less potent than that of l-pin2. nevertheless, the antimicrobial activity of d-pin2 was equally effective  as that of l-pin2 in microdilution assays. yet, when d- and l-pin2 were incubated with trypsin, elastase and whole human serum, only d-pin2 kept its antimicrobial  activity towards all bacteria, but in diluted human serum, l- and d-pin2 maintained similar peptide stability. finally, when l- and d-pin2 were incubated  with proteases from p. aeruginosa dfu3 culture, a clinical isolated strain, d-pin2 kept its antibiotic activity while l-pin2 was not effective.

TI  == susceptibility to antimicrobial agents among bovine mastitis pathogens isolated from north american dairy cattle, 2002-2010.
AB  == approximately 8,000 isolates of streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus dysgalactiae, streptococcus uberis, staphylococcus aureus, and escherichia coli,  isolated by 25 veterinary laboratories across north america between 2002 and 2010, were tested for in vitro susceptibility to beta-lactam, macrolide, and lincosamide drugs. the minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of the beta-lactam drugs remained low against most of the gram-positive strains tested,  and no substantial changes in the mic distributions were seen over time. of the beta-lactam antimicrobial agents tested, only ceftiofur showed good in vitro activity against e. coli. the mics of the macrolides and lincosamides also remained low against gram-positive mastitis pathogens. while the mic values given by 50% of isolates (mic50) for erythromycin and pirlimycin and the streptococci were all low (</=0.5 microg/ml), the mic values given by 90% of isolates (mic90)  were higher and more variable, but with no apparent increase over time. staphylococcus aureus showed little change in erythromycin susceptibility over time, but there may be a small, numerical increase in pirlimycin mic50 and mic90  values. overall, the results suggest that mastitis pathogens in the united states and canada have not shown any substantial changes in the in vitro susceptibility  to beta-lactam, macrolide, and lincosamide drugs tested over the 9 years of the study.

TI  == streptococcal vertebral osteomyelitis: multiple faces of the same disease.
AB  == the role of streptococcus species as an aetiological microorganism of vertebral osteomyelitis (vo) is considered to be of little relevance. we aimed to describe  a large number of cases of streptococcal vertebral osteomyelitis (svo), to analyze the clinical features associated with different streptococcus species, and to compare them with a cohort of patients with vo caused by staphylococcus aureus. an incidence study and a retrospective, multicenter, observational clinical study of cases of svo (1991-2011) were performed. statistical comparison of svo by different species and between them and staphylococcal vo was carried out. over the whole period there was an increasing incidence in the number of vos and svos per year (p <0.05). among 58 cases of svo, those caused by non-viridans  streptococcus (streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus agalactiae and streptococcus pyogenes; n = 26) mimicked vo by s. aureus, and presented with more fever, neurological symptoms and paravertebral abscesses in comparison with those caused by the viridans group (remaining species). in contrast, the latter have a  sub-acute clinical picture and were associated with the presence of endocarditis  (p <0.05). among non-viridans svos, concomitant infection was specifically related to s. pneumoniae (p <0.05). in conclusion, svo presents a wide range of clinical patterns. the relationship between vo and diagnosis of endocarditis was  established with svo caused by the viridans group. whereas non-viridans svo mimics acute characteristics of vo caused by s. aureus, cases of viridans svo are significantly more likely to have a sub-acute clinical presentation. the increased incidence of svo during the last decades could support a new epidemiological scenario.

TI  == anti-bacterial activity of recombinant human beta-defensin-3 secreted in the milk of transgenic goats produced by somatic cell nuclear transfer.
AB  == the present study was conducted to determine whether recombinant human beta-defensin-3 (rhbd3) in the milk of transgenic goats has an anti-bacterial activity against escherichia coli (e. coli), staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus) and streptococcus agalactiae (s. agalactiae) that could cause mastitis. a hbd3 mammary-specific expression vector was transfected by electroporation into goat fetal fibroblasts which were used to produce fourteen healthy transgenic goats by somatic cell nuclear transfer. the expression level of rhbd3 in the milk of the six transgenic goats ranged from 98 to 121 microg/ml at 15 days of lactation, and was maintained at 90-111 microg/ml during the following 2 months. milk samples from transgenic goats showed an obvious inhibitory activity against e. coli, s. aureus and s. agalactiae in vitro. the minimal inhibitory concentrations of rhbd3 in milk against e. coli, s. aureus and s. agalactiae were 9.5-10.5, 21.8-23.0 and 17.3-18.5 microg/ml, respectively, which was similar to those of the hbd3 standard (p>0.05). the in vivo anti-bacterial activities of rhbd3 in milk were examined by intramammary infusion of viable bacterial inoculums. we observed that 9/10 and 8/10 glands of non-transgenic goats infused with s. aureus and e. coli became infected. the mean numbers of viable bacteria went up to 2.9x10(3) and 95.4x10(3) cfu/ml at 48 h after infusion, respectively; the mean somatic cell counts (scc) in infected glands reached up to 260.4x10(5) and 622.2x10(5) cells/ml, which were significantly higher than the scc in uninfected goat glands. in contrast, no bacteria was presented in glands of transgenic goats and pbs-infused controls, and the ssc did not significantly change throughout the period. moreover, the compositions and protein profiles of milk from transgenic and non-transgenic goats were identical. the present study demonstrated that hbd3 were an effective anti-bacterial protein to enhance the mastitis resistance of dairy animals.

TI  == comparison of the epidemiological behavior of mastitis pathogens by applying time-series analysis in results of milk samples submitted for microbiological examination.
AB  == the objective of this study is to examine and compare the trends of mastitis pathogens in quarter milk samples (n = 240,232) submitted for microbiological examination at the milk analysis laboratory (l.i.g.a.l.) at galicia, spain from june 2005 to september 2011. autoregressive integrated moving average (arima) models and multivariate statistical techniques such as cluster analysis were used in order to detect seasonal trends and similarities between the series trends and to classify mastitis pathogens into relatively homogeneous groups. the decrease of bulk milk somatic cell counts achieved by the mastitis control program, developed in recent years in this region, is the result of the decrease in imi caused by a limited number of mastitis pathogens. the obtained results reflect a  greater complexity in the behavior of mastitis pathogens, unlike the traditional  classification into contagious or environmental. staphylococcus aureus showed a trend similar to streptococcus dysgalactiae, a mastitis pathogen can behave in both a contagious and an environmental manner. among the traditionally considered environmental mastitis pathogens, strep. uberis showed a different behavior to escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae. coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns) species and streptococcus other than strep. agalactiae showed differences in the trend model. time-series analysis and multivariate statistical techniques, such as cluster analysis, could be powerful tools to assess the isolation trend of mastitis pathogens because of their ability to cope with stochastic dependence of consecutive data. furthermore, they could be used to identify the epidemiological behavior of mastitis pathogens using the results of milk samples  submitted for routine microbiological examination, by classifying them into relatively homogeneous groups.

TI  == pathogen profile of clinical mastitis in irish milk-recording herds reveals a complex aetiology.
AB  == effective mastitis control requires knowledge of the predominant pathogen challenges on the farm. in order to quantify this challenge, the aetiological agents associated with clinical mastitis in 30 milk-recording dairy herds in ireland over a complete lactation were investigated. standard bacteriology was performed on 630 pretreatment quarter milk samples, of which 56 per cent were culture-positive, 42 per cent culture-negative and 2 per cent contaminated. two micro-organisms were isolated from almost 5 per cent of the culture-positive samples. the bacteria isolated were staphylococcus aureus (23 per cent), streptococcus uberis (17 per cent), escherichia coli (9 per cent), streptococcus  species (6 per cent), coagulase-negative staphylococci (4 per cent) and other species (1 per cent). a wide variety of bacterial species were associated with clinical mastitis, with s aureus the most prevalent pathogen overall, followed by s uberis. however, the bacterial challenges varied widely from farm to farm. in comparison with previous reports, in the present study, the contagious pathogens  s aureus and streptococcus agalactiae were less commonly associated with clinical mastitis, whereas, the environmental pathogens s uberis and e coli were found more commonly associated with clinical mastitis. while s aureus remains the pathogen most commonly associated with intramammary infection in these herds, environmental pathogens, such as s uberis and e coli also present a considerable  challenge.

TI  == identification of pathogens in mastitis milk samples with fluorescent in situ hybridization.
AB  == traditionally, the bacteriological examination of mastitis milk samples is performed by culture followed by biochemical tests on the cultured bacteria to allow identification of the causative pathogen. depending on the species involved, this classic identification is time-consuming compared to other techniques such as fluorescent in situ hybridization (fish), a culture-independent method that utilizes oligonucleotides (labeled with a fluorophore) that are specific to a string of target dna/rna. in the current study, the applicability of fish was evaluated for the detection of mastitis pathogens directly in milk samples. to remove interfering lipids and proteins from mastitis milk samples prior to fish, a previously published enzymatic treatment with savinase was evaluated. fish was performed using oligonucleotides  specific for staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus uberis, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli, and trueperella (arcanobacterium) pyogenes. the enzymatic pretreatment and the sensitivity of fish were evaluated using spiked whole milk samples and mastitis milk samples with bacterial loads of less than 10(3) up to 10(8) colony-forming units (cfu)/ml. bacteria were reliably detected in milk samples with bacterial numbers of 10(6) cfu/ml or higher. however, bacteria present in numbers below 10(6) cfu/ml were not detectable in all cases. the ability of fish to identify mastitis-causing pathogens directly in milk samples, and therefore earlier than classical culture methods, can supplement the classic diagnostic procedures for mastitis milk samples.

AB  == methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and streptococcus pyogenes (group a streptococcus [gras]) cause serious and sometimes fatal human diseases.  they are among the many gram-positive pathogens for which resistance to leading antibiotics has emerged. as a result, alternative therapies need to be developed  to combat these pathogens. we have identified a novel bacteriophage lysin (plyss2), derived from a streptococcus suis phage, with broad lytic activity against mrsa, vancomycin-intermediate s. aureus (visa), streptococcus suis, listeria, staphylococcus simulans, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus equi, streptococcus agalactiae (group b streptococcus [gbs]), s. pyogenes, streptococcus sanguinis, group g streptococci (ggs), group e streptococci (ges),  and streptococcus pneumoniae. plyss2 has an n-terminal cysteine-histidine aminopeptidase (chap) catalytic domain and a c-terminal sh3b binding domain. it is stable at 50 degrees c for 30 min, 37 degrees c for >24 h, 4 degrees c for 15  days, and -80 degrees c for >7 months; it maintained full activity after 10 freeze-thaw cycles. plyss2 at 128 mug/ml in vitro reduced mrsa and s. pyogenes growth by 5 logs and 3 logs within 1 h, respectively, and exhibited a mic of 16 mug/ml for mrsa. a single, 2-mg dose of plyss2 protected 92% (22/24) of the mice  in a bacteremia model of mixed mrsa and s. pyogenes infection. serially increasing exposure of mrsa and s. pyogenes to plyss2 or mupirocin resulted in no observed resistance to plyss2 and resistance to mupirocin. to date, no other lysin has shown such notable broad lytic activity, stability, and efficacy against multiple, leading, human bacterial pathogens; as such, plyss2 has all the characteristics to be an effective therapeutic.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance of abnormal vaginal discharges microorganisms in ouagadougou, burkina faso.
AB  == objective: to assess the prevalence of bacterial strains and fungal strains infecting the vaginal tract and test their sensitivity to antibiotics in women attending saint camille medical centre in ouagadougou. methods: from january 2008 to december 2009, a total of 2 000 vaginal swabs were cultivated for bacterial and fungal identification and isolation. furthermore, bacterial strains were tested for their susceptibility to several antibiotics used in routine in the centre. results: the results revealed that microbial isolation and identification was attempted for 1 536/2 000 sample, a positivity rate of 76.80%. candida albicans (48.76%), followed by escherichia coli (16.67%), streptococcus agalactiae (8.14%) and staphylococcus aureus (7.55%) were the major agents of genital tract infections in patients. mycoplasma hominis and ureaplasma urealyticum combined accounted for less than 7%. trichomonas vaginalis was identified in 1.04% cases. the antimicrobial tests revealed that the microorganisms developed resistance to several antibiotics including beta lactams. however, antibiotics such as cefamenzol, ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin were still active on these bacteria. conclusions: the results reveal that many sexually active women are infected by one or more microbial pathogens, probably because of the lack of hygiene or the adoption of some risky behaviors, such as not using condoms or having multiple sexual partners. efforts should be made to address these points in the country.

TI  == prevalence of contagious mastitis pathogens in bulk tank milk in quebec.
AB  == the objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence of mycoplasma, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus agalactiae in bulk tank milk (btm) in quebec dairy herds. btm was sampled 3 times a month in 117 randomly selected dairy herds. samples were submitted for s. aureus, s. agalactiae, and mycoplasma  and for direct mycoplasma detection by polymerase chain reaction (pcr). mycoplasma spp. was identified at least once in 3 herds (2.6%) by primary culture and/or pcr and in 4 herds (3.4%) by enrichment culture and/or pcr. staphylococcus aureus was isolated at least once in 99 (84.6%) and 112 (95.7%) herds in primary  culture and after enrichment, respectively. streptococcus agalactiae was isolated at least once in 9 (7.7%) and 10 (8.6%) herds in primary culture and after enrichment, respectively. herd prevalence of mycoplasma was similar to that previously reported in canada. staphylococcus aureus is still by far the most important contagious mastitis pathogen.

TI  == contemporary potencies of minocycline and tetracycline hcl tested against gram-positive pathogens: sentry program results using clsi and eucast breakpoint  criteria.
AB  == tetracycline class agents vary widely in their activity against emerging important antimicrobial-resistant pathogens such as methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and acinetobacter spp. also, published susceptibility breakpoints are discordant between the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi), the european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing (eucast), and regulatory-approved documents. we have assessed the impact of these differences for tetracycline hcl and minocycline when tested against contemporary gram-positive pathogens. the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program (2011) compared minocycline and tetracycline hcl activity via reference methods (m07-a9) using a worldwide collection of s. aureus (sa; 4917 strains with 1955 mrsa), streptococcus pneumoniae (spn; 1899), s. pyogenes (gra; 246), and s. agalactiae (grb; 217). regardless of applied categorical breakpoints, minocycline exhibited wider coverage (% susceptible) than tetracycline hcl of 4.5-11.8/0.5-2.6/1.4-2.3/0.4-0.4% for mrsa/spn/grb/gra,  respectively. lower eucast susceptible breakpoints produced reduced susceptibility rates for minocycline ranging from no difference (</=0.5 mug/ml) for gra to -8.9% (</=1 mug/ml) for mrsa (97.2% susceptible by clsi; 88.3% by eucast). use of tetracycline hcl-susceptible results to predict minocycline susceptibility was very accurate (99.0-100.0%), with absolute categorical agreement rates ranging from 92.1% to 98.4% (clsi) to 98.4% to 99.6% (eucast) for streptococci; greatest predictive error was noted using the clsi breakpoints (14.7%) compared to eucast criteria (only 5.0%; acceptable), both for mrsa testing dominated by false-resistant results for minocycline. in conclusion, minocycline demonstrates continued superior in vitro activity compared to tetracycline hcl when testing sa (especially mrsa) and pathogenic streptococci. when testing tetracyclines, laboratories must recognize the expanded spectrum of  minocycline against certain pathogens and utilize methods minimizing interpretive error. we conclude that eucast breakpoint criteria (</=0.5 or </=1 mug/ml) represent the most conservative (better recognize strains with tet resistance mechanisms) and accurate tetracycline breakpoint guidelines for testing contemporary isolates of gram-positive cocci.

TI  == host adapted intramammary infections in pregnant heifers which were co-housed and reared on fresh milk as calves.
AB  == background: heifers can calve down with intramammary infections (imi) and udder damage. this will have a negative impact on their longevity, future milk yield and financial return. co-housed pre-weaned calves that are fed fresh milk have the opportunity to suckle each other's teats and may infect udders of fellow heifer calves with pathogens present in milk. the prevalence of imi in pregnant heifers in south africa (sa) which were co-housed and reared on fresh milk as calves, is not known. quarter secretion samples from both pregnant heifers (n = 2065) and dry cows (n = 5365) were collected for microbiological analysis from eight sa dairy herds. all heifers tested in this study were co-housed pre-weaning and were fed fresh milk as calves. results: the prevalence of coagulase negative  staphylococci, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, environmental streptococci, coliforms and samples with no bacterial growth in heifers was 26%,  0.9%, 0.08%, 1.4%, 0.4% and 66%, respectively. the overall prevalence ratio between heifers and cows for staphylococcus aureus imi was 0.76 (95% ci: 0.59, 0.98). four of the individual herds had prevalence ratios of less than one (p < 0.05), one herd had a prevalence ratio of 3.15 (95% ci: 1.52, 6.32), and the remaining 3 herds had a prevalence ratio not significantly different from 1.0. marginally significant differences were found between staphylococcus aureus imi in pregnant heifers compared to cows in their second and later lactations (p = 0.06, p = 0.05, respectively) but no significant differences between heifers and  cows in their first lactation. conclusions: the presence of streptococcus agalactiae imi in heifers came as a surprise, especially as herd infection rates  were low. the high prevalence ratio of staphylococcus aureus between heifers and  cows in one herd warrants further investigation due to the potential danger of udder damage in a young cow at the start of her productive life. the imi in heifers with host adapted pathogens can also act as a source of new imi for lactating dairy cows.

TI  == assessment of a semi-automated protocol for multiplex analysis of sepsis-causing  bacteria with spiked whole blood samples.
AB  == sepsis is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates worldwide. rapid and reliable diagnostic methods are needed for efficient and evidence-based treatment of septic patients. recently, new molecular tools have emerged to complement the  conventional culture-based diagnostic methods. in this study, we used spiked whole blood samples to evaluate together two ready-to-use molecular solutions for the detection of sepsis-causing bacteria. we spiked whole blood with bacterial species relevant in sepsis and extracted bacterial dna with the nordiag arrow device, using the selectna blood pathogen dna isolation kit. dna extracts were analyzed by the polymerase chain reaction (pcr)- and microarray-based prove-it bone and joint assay, resulting in correctly identified bacterial species with detection limits of 11-600 colony-forming unit/ml (cfu/ml). to understand the recovery losses of bacterial dna during the sample preparation step and the capability of the pcr- and microarray-based platform to respond to the sensitivity requirements, we also determined the analytical sensitivity of the pcr and microarray platform to be 1-21 genome equivalents for the tested bacterial species. in addition, the inclusivity of the prove-it bone and joint assay was demonstrated with methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) clones carrying sccmec types i, ii, iv, or v and a nontypable sccmec type. the proof-of-concept for accurate multiplex pathogen and antibacterial resistance marker detection from spiked whole blood samples was demonstrated by the selective bacterial dna extraction method combined with the high-throughput pcr-  and microarray-based platform. further investigations are needed to study the promising potential of the concept for sensitive, semi-automated identification of sepsis-causing pathogens directly from whole blood.

TI  == defining standardized protocols for determining the efficacy of a postmilking teat disinfectant following experimental exposure of teats to mastitis pathogens.
AB  == the objective of this paper was to define standardized protocols for determining  the efficacy of a postmilking teat disinfectant following experimental exposure of teats to both staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus agalactiae. the standardized protocols describe the selection of cows and herds and define the critical points in performing experimental exposure, performing bacterial culture, evaluating the culture results, and finally performing statistical analyses and reporting of the results. the protocols define both negative control and positive control trials. for negative control trials, the protocol states that an efficacy of reducing new intramammary infections (imi) of at least 40% is required for a teat disinfectant to be considered effective. for positive control trials, noninferiority to a control disinfectant with a published efficacy of reducing new imi of at least 70% is required. sample sizes for both negative and  positive control trials are calculated. positive control trials are expected to require a large trial size. statistical analysis methods are defined and, in the  proposed methods, the rate of imi may be analyzed using generalized linear mixed  models. the efficacy of the test product can be evaluated while controlling for important covariates and confounders in the trial. finally, standards for reporting are defined and reporting considerations are discussed. the use of the  defined protocol is shown through presentation of the results of a recent trial of a test product against a negative control.

TI  == donor-derived bacteremia in liver transplant recipients despite antibiotic prophylaxis.
AB  == as the disparity between the number of candidates listed for transplant and the number of donors continues to grow, marginal organ donors are increasingly utilized. this includes bacteremic donors which may carry an increased risk of transmission of infection. it is recommended that recipients of organs from bacteremic donors receive antibiotic prophylaxis based on the susceptibilities of the donor isolate to prevent transmission. here, we present four cases of donor-derived bacteremia, despite appropriate antimicrobial prophylaxis, in four  liver transplant recipients. transmitted pathogens included staphylococcus aureus in two cases, and escherichia coli and group b streptococcus each in one case. interestingly, none of the nonhepatic organs (n=10) utilized from these bacteremic donors resulted in transmissions. these cases highlight the fact that  risk of transmission from bacteremic donors is not eliminated with antimicrobial  therapy in the donor and recipient. as no transmissions occurred in recipients of nonhepatic organs from these donors, these cases also suggest that liver recipients may be at higher risk of donor transmitted bacteremia.

TI  == update of dalbavancin spectrum and potency in the usa: report from the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program (2011).
AB  == dalbavancin (dal) is an investigational lipoglycopeptide with a prolonged serum half-life allowing once weekly dosing. dal potency was assessed in the 2011 sentry antimicrobial surveillance program among 1555 isolates sampled from all 9  us census regions. monitored gram-positive cocci included staphylococcus aureus (sa; 1,036/50.4% mrsa), coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons; 115), enterococcus faecalis (25), e. faecium (31), streptococcus pyogenes (155), streptococcus agalactiae (153), and viridans group streptococci (vgs; 40). all susceptibility (s) testing used clinical and laboratory standards institute reference broth microdilution methods and interpretations. dal (mic(50/90), 0.06/0.06 mug/ml) was 8- and 16-fold more active than daptomycin (dap) and vancomycin (van), respectively against sa, with mssa and mrsa having the same mic(90) results. cons was slightly more dal-s (mic(50), </=0.03mug/ml). the highest staphylococcal dal mic was only 0.25 mug/ml. beta-haemolytic streptococci (betahs) and vgs had dal mic results ranging from </=0.03 to 0.25 mug/ml (mic(90), 0.06-0.12 mug/ml), and only enterococci showed elevated dal mic results. vana phenotype-resistant e. faecalis or e. faecium had dal mic values at >/=1 mug/ml; vanb strains were dal-s (mic, </=0.25 mug/ml). all cited dal quantitative values were consistent with earlier surveillance data (2006-2009), without evidence of mic creep. in conclusion, year 2011 sentry program data for dal documents sustained potent activity against sa, cons, betahs, vgs, and van-s  enterococci, which averaged 4- to 32-fold greater than van, dap, or linezolid.

TI  == comparing effects of freezing at -196 degrees c and -20 degrees c on the viability of mastitis pathogens.
AB  == the aim of this study was to compare the effects of cryopreservation at approximately -196 degrees c in liquid nitrogen (n) and freezing at approximately -20 degrees c in a freezer, on the viability and survival of eight different mastitogenic bacteria inoculated in milk. bacteria were frozen at approximately -20 degrees c in a freezer and cryopreserved at approximately -196 degrees c in liquid nitrogen. an effective preservation method was needed for follow-up samples from cows identified in the south african national milk recording scheme  (nmrs) with somatic cell counts above 250 000 cells/ml milk. the organisation responsible for sample collection of the nmrs milk samples also provides producers with liquid nitrogen for their semen flasks at the collection sites. this existing mode of storage and transport could therefore be utilised.ten samples of each organism were thawed and cultured bi-weekly until week 18 for both temperature treatments. an additional sampling was performed at week 30 for  samples frozen at approximately -20 degrees c. freezing and cryopreservation did  not impair subsequent isolation of streptococcus dysgalactiae, streptococcus uberis, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus (sth) (phage type lytic group iii) or sta. aureus (sta) (phage typed, other than lytic group iii). survival was indicated by the isolation of bacteria from samples, and viability by the strength of growth of the bacteria isolated. the survival of streptococcus agalactiae decreased after week 12 and escherichia coli after week 16 of freezing, but both organisms survived under cryogenic preservation until week 18. coagulase-negative staphylococci survived until week 18 for both freezing and cryogenic preservation.both storage methods could thus contribute to the improvement of a pro-active approach towards udder health management in south african dairy herds.

TI  == influence of the vaginal microbiota on toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 production by staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == menstrual toxic shock syndrome (tss) is a serious illness that afflicts women of  premenopausal age worldwide and arises from vaginal infection by staphylococcus aureus and concurrent production of toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (tsst-1). studies have illustrated the capacity of lactobacilli to reduce s. aureus virulence, including the capacity to suppress tsst-1. we hypothesized that an aberrant microbiota characteristic of pathogenic bacteria would induce the increased production of tsst-1 and that this might represent a risk factor for the development of tss. a s. aureus tsst-1 reporter strain was grown in the presence of vaginal swab contents collected from women with a clinically healthy  vaginal status, women with an intermediate status, and those diagnosed with bacterial vaginosis (bv). bacterial supernatant challenge assays were also performed to test the effects of aerobic vaginitis (av)-associated pathogens toward tsst-1 production. while clinical samples from healthy and bv women suppressed toxin production, in vitro studies demonstrated that streptococcus agalactiae and enterococcus spp. significantly induced tsst-1 production, while some lactobacillus spp. suppressed it. the findings suggest that women colonized  by s. aureus and with av, but not bv, may be more susceptible to menstrual tss and would most benefit from prophylactic treatment.

TI  == recent developments and current issues in the epidemiology, diagnosis, and management of bacterial and fungal neonatal sepsis.
AB  == identifying neonates with sepsis is complicated by variability in clinical presentation. the incidence of early onset sepsis (eos) resulting from invasive group b streptococcal (gbs) infections has been notably reduced by the widespread delivery of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis. rates of eos attributable to non-gbs etiologies have remained constant, and ampicillin-resistant escherichia coli has become more prevalent. late-onset sepsis (los) attributable to gram-positive organisms including coagulase-negative staphylococci and staphylococcus aureus is associated with increased morbidity and mortality among  premature infants. invasive candidiasis is an emerging cause of los, especially among infants who receive broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents. prophylactic fluconazole administration to very low-birth-weight (vlbw) neonates during the first 6 weeks of life prevents invasive candidiasis in neonatal intensive care units (nicu) with high rates of fungal infections. targeted fluconazole prophylaxis may be beneficial in vlbw neonates who receive care in nicus with lower rates of invasive fungal infections. assessment of immune function, neutrophil markers, acute phase reactants, and utilization of sepsis screening scores may contribute to the management of sepsis. maternal decolonization, antimicrobial stewardship, early enteral feeding, and optimal infection control practices are potential practical strategies for reducing the burden of neonatal  sepsis.

TI  == short communication: relationship between herd intramammary infection incidence and elimination rate during the dry period.
AB  == the objective of the study was to explore the relationship between herd dry period (dp) intramammary infection (imi) incidence and elimination rates. a cohort of 91 canadian dairy herds was recruited and followed in 2007 and 2008. universal dry cow therapy was widely adopted among the participating herds. at the beginning of years 2007 and 2008, a sample of 15 cows was selected in each herd. a series of quarter-milk samples consisting of 2 predry and 2 postcalving samples were collected on each quarter of these 30 cows. milk samples were analyzed using routine bacteriological milk culture, and predry and postcalving imi statuses of these quarters were established using parallel interpretation of  the 2 predry and 2 postcalving tests, respectively. intramammary infection status was defined as imi by staphylococcus aureus, streptococci other than streptococcus agalactiae, coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns), or corynebacterium spp. incidence and elimination rates of dp imi were computed for  each herd. lowess curves and linear regression were used to investigate the association between dp imi incidence and elimination rates. significant negative  associations were found between incidence and elimination rates of staph. aureus  and cns. the relationship between incidence and elimination rates was nonlinear for cns, with a relatively strong negative relationship between dp imi incidence  and elimination rates for herds with relatively low dp imi incidence (<0.10 new imi/quarter-month). for herds with higher dp imi incidence (>/= 0.10 new imi/quarter-month), a weaker negative relationship was observed between rates. no significant associations could be seen between dp incidence and elimination rates of streptococci other than strep. agalactiae and of corynebacterium spp. these results suggest that, conversely to the general belief, acquisition of new imi and elimination of existing imi during the dp may be driven, at least for staphylococci, by common mechanisms. the use of management strategies that would  lead to the selection of pathogens less well adapted to the host could explain the associations observed between acquisition and elimination of imi over the dp.

TI  == molecular screening of ovine mastitis in different breeds.
AB  == clinical and subclinical mastitis directly affect mammary gland function and have a great economic impact on the sheep and goat dairy industries. the present study explores molecular diagnosis of ovine subclinical mastitis as a faster and more precise screening method compared with microbiology and biochemical techniques to assess the molecular and chemical properties of raw milk samples from healthy animals from 3 breeds of sheep raised in portugal. based on 16s ribosomal rna screening by pcr, milk samples from all sheep were categorized as contaminated (n=123) or noncontaminated (n=104). for contaminated milk, different specific primers were used for pathogen identification (staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus dysgalactiae, and streptococcus uberis).  streptococcus agalactiae was identified as the most frequent agent. we further assessed whether contaminated versus noncontaminated samples were chemically different in terms of fat, protein, lactose, ph, and solids-not-fat. this molecular screening method allowed rapid and efficient identification of contaminated raw sheep milk, including pathogen identification, before significant alterations in milk chemical properties could be detected. this methodology may lead to a specific and efficient animal treatment and consequently less expensive flock management.

AB  == background: a major feature of chronic wounds is the loss of tissue, with the exposure of dermal components preventing primary closure and leading to bacterial colonization. bacterial colonization has been proposed as one of the common underlying pathologies present in chronic wounds. the objective of this exploratory study was to identify bacteria cultured from chronic venous leg ulcers and test for proteolytic activity that degrades matrix substrates. method: bacteria were isolated, cultured, and identified from six subjects (average age = 62.8 years) over 2-10 months under an approved protocol using swabs and microbiological culture media. proteolytic activity against (a) gelatin, (b) an elastin substrate, and (c) a serine/trypsin-sensitive substrate was determined using a colorimetric plate assay with an elisa plate reader and zymography. results: we identified 13 bacteria that expressed proteolytic activity against one or more of the tested substrates. of these, six were gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus agalactiae, corynebacterium, and streptococcus bovis) and seven were gram-negative (pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis,  morganella morganii, klebsiella pneumoniae, bacteroides fragilis, and serratia marcescens) organisms. two of these, s. aureus and p. aeruginosa, are recognized  wound pathogens. conclusions: multiple bacteria species isolated from colonized venous leg ulcers have the capacity to secrete proteases capable of degrading components of the extracellular matrix important for wound healing. matrix degradation by bacteria may contribute to delays in tissue deposition and repair, suggesting that treatment of chronic wounds should include appropriate management of colonizing bacteria.

TI  == prospective survey of acute osteoarticular infections in a french paediatric orthopedic surgery unit.
AB  == clin microbiol infect abstract: the epidemiology of acute paediatric osteoarticular infections (oai) has recently evolved, mainly due to the improvement of microbiological diagnosis. we conducted a prospective study to analyse the recent epidemiology and the clinical evolution of paediatric oai in order to validate the adequacy of our probabilistic first-line antibiotic treatment (intraveinous cefamandole + gentamicin). all children suspected of community acquired oai were included and followed-up for 3 years. the etiologic diagnosis was based on blood cultures, joint aspirations and bone punctures. all  osteoarticular (oa) samples were systematically inoculated into blood culture bottles. real-time universal 16s rrna and pcr targeted on staphylococcus aureus,  kingella kingae, streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes were performed twice a week. from 17 march 2007 to 26 february 2009, 98 septic arthritis, 70 osteomyelitis, 23 osteoarthritis and six spondylodiscitis were analysed. a portal of entry was suspected in 44% of cases, including 55% of otorhinolaryngological infections. c reactive protein was the most sensitive inflammatory marker. pcr increased by 54% the performance of bacteriological diagnosis. among the patients completely investigated (blood culture and oai samples), there were 63% documented oai. the main pathogens found were k. kingae  (52%), s. aureus (28%), s. pyogenes (7%), s. pneumoniae (3%) and streptococcus agalactiae (2%). all isolated bacteria were sensitive to the probabilist treatment and outcome was favorable. pcr has significantly improved the performance and the delay of ioa diagnosis in children, for which k. kingae turned out to be the first causative agent. the probabilistic treatment was active against the main bacteria responsible for paediatric oai.

TI  == interim susceptibility testing for ceftaroline, a new mrsa-active cephalosporin:  selecting potent surrogate beta-lactam markers to predict ceftaroline activity against clinically indicated species.
AB  == ceftaroline, the bio-active form of parenterally administered ceftaroline fosamil, is a unique broad-spectrum cephalosporin with in vitro and in vivo activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and was approved for clinical use by the united states food and drug administration in october 2010. in over a year since ceftaroline fosamil approval, no widely used commercial susceptibility test system has added this new compound to its product, therefore  requiring use of alternative agar diffusion methods for clinical microbiology laboratories that want to test clinical isolates for ceftaroline susceptibility.  an alternative strategy of applying a surrogate beta-lactam class marker agent was assessed here, using results from 14,902 organisms (2008-2010) sampled in the usa. very high and acceptable accuracy (>/= 99.75%) was observed for predicting ceftaroline susceptibility as follows: 1) use of imipenem or meropenem minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) at </= 8 mug/ml (susceptible and intermediate categories) when testing s. aureus; 2) use of ceftriaxone mic at </= 2 mug/ml (susceptible and intermediate categories) when testing streptococcus pneumoniae as well as other streptococci (s. pyogenes and s. agalactiae); and 3) use of ceftriaxone, or cefepime, or ceftazidime at </= 2 mug/ml (susceptible category) when testing haemophilus influenzae. only when testing indicated enterobacteriaceae species using ceftriaxone susceptibility results did the ceftaroline-nonsusceptible errors increase (4.11%). these presented analyses offer a validated surrogate marker strategy for ceftaroline susceptibility testing, pending development and validation by the commonly used automated systems and agar diffusion commercial methods.

TI  == sensitivity and specificity of a hand-held milk electrical conductivity meter compared to the california mastitis test for mastitis in dairy cattle.
AB  == screening tests for mastitis can play an important role in proactive mastitis control programs. the primary objective of this study was to compare the sensitivity and specificity of milk electrical conductivity (ec) to the california mastitis test (cmt) in commercial dairy cattle in south africa using bayesian methods without a perfect reference test. a total of 1848 quarter milk specimens were collected from 173 cows sampled during six sequential farm visits. of these samples, 25.8% yielded pathogenic bacterial isolates. the most frequently isolated species were coagulase negative staphylococci (n=346), streptococcus agalactiae (n=54), and staphylococcus aureus (n=42). the overall cow-level prevalence of mastitis was 54% based on the bayesian latent class (blc) analysis. the cmt was more accurate than ec for classification of cows having somatic cell counts >200,000/ml and for isolation of a bacterial pathogen. blc analysis also suggested an overall benefit of cmt over ec but the statistical evidence was not strong (p=0.257). the bayesian model estimated the sensitivity and specificity of ec (measured via resistance) at a cut-point of >25 m ohm/cm to be 89.9% and 86.8%, respectively. the cmt had a sensitivity and specificity of 94.5% and 77.7%, respectively, when evaluated at the weak positive cut-point. ec  was useful for identifying milk specimens harbouring pathogens but was not able to differentiate among evaluated bacterial isolates. screening tests can be used  to improve udder health as part of a proactive management plan.

TI  == examining the effect of intramammary infections with minor mastitis pathogens on  the acquisition of new intramammary infections with major mastitis pathogens--a systematic review and meta-analysis.
AB  == major mastitis pathogens such as staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus uberis, streptococcus dysgalactiae, and the coliforms are usually considered more virulent and damaging to the udder than minor mastitis pathogens  such as corynebacterium bovis and coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns). the current literature contains several studies detailing analyses with conflicting results as to whether intramammary infection (imi) with the minor pathogens decreases, increases, or has no effect on the risk of a quarter acquiring a new intramammary infection (nimi) with a major pathogen. to investigate the available scientific evidence regarding the effect of imi with minor pathogens on the acquisition of nimi with major pathogens, a systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted. the total extant english- and french-language literature in electronic databases was searched and all publications cited by relevant papers were investigated. results from 68 studies were extracted from 38 relevant papers. random-effects models were used to investigate the effects of cns and c.  bovis on acquisition of new imi with any of the major pathogens, as well as individually for the minor pathogens and staph. aureus. significant heterogeneity among studies exists, some of which could be accounted for by using meta-regression. overall, observational studies showed no effect, whereas challenge studies showed strong and significant protective effects, specifically  when major pathogens were introduced into the mammary gland via methods bypassing the teat end. underlying risk can account for several unmeasured factors, and studies with higher underlying risk found more protective effects of minor pathogens. larger doses of challenge organisms reduced the protective effect of minor pathogens, and studies with more stringent diagnostic criteria for pathogen imi identified less protection. smaller studies (those utilizing fewer than 40 cows) also showed a greater protective effect than larger studies.

TI  == bayesian estimation of the diagnostic accuracy of a multiplex real-time pcr assay and bacteriological culture for 4 common bovine intramammary pathogens.
AB  == bacteriological culture (bc) is the traditional method for intramammary infection diagnosis but lacks sensitivity and is time consuming. multiplex real-time pcr (mr-pcr) enables testing the presence of several bacteria and reduces diagnosis time. our objective was to estimate bacterial species-specific sensitivity (se) and specificity of both bc and mr-pcr tests for detecting bacteria in milk samples from clinical mastitis cases and from apparently normal quarters, using a bayesian latent class model. milk samples from 1,014 clinical mastitis cases and  1,495 samples from apparently normal quarters were analyzed by bc and mr-pcr. two positive culture definitions were used: >/=1 cfu/0.01 ml and >/=10 cfu/0.01 ml of the specified bacteria. the mr-pcr was designed to simultaneously detect staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus uberis, escherichia coli, and streptococcus  agalactiae. the priors used in our bayesian model were weakly informative, with bc priors using the best available error data. results were compared with those obtained using uniform priors for mr-pcr to test robustness. weak and uniform priors gave about the same posterior distributions except for strep. uberis from  normal quarters and strep. agalactiae. multiplex real-time pcr se on milk from clinical mastitis were lower than mr-pcr se on milk from normal quarters. multiplex real-time pcr se was higher than bc on milk from normal quarters. multiplex real-time pcr se was generally lower than bc on milk from clinical mastitis and it varied by clinical severity. the estimate specificities of detection for all pathogens were >/=99%, regardless of sample type. the effect of milk sample preservation before testing was evaluated and may have been a factor  that affected our observed results. a significant association was observed between sample age and mr-pcr results leading to reduced detection of e. coli and strep. agalactiae in nonclinical samples. differences in sample age between conduct of bc and of mr-pcr did not concur with any apparent differences between  se estimates of the 2 tests. further work should be done to extend these results  to other pcr-based tests for detecting bacterial species in milk samples, for which presented results could be used as prior parameter distributions. limits of sample handling and storage and the potential existence of substances in clinical case samples that may interfere with pcr reactions also are worth further investigation.

TI  == whole-cell maldi-tof ms: a new tool to assess the multifaceted activation of macrophages.
AB  == whole-cell maldi-tof ms is routinely used to identify bacterial species in clinical samples. this technique has also proven to allow identification of intact mammalian cells, including macrophages. here, we wondered whether this approach enabled the assessment human macrophages plasticity. the whole-cell maldi-tof spectra of macrophages stimulated with ifn-gamma and il-4, two inducers of m1 and m2 macrophage polarisation, consisted of peaks ranging from 2 to 12 kda. the spectra of unstimulated and stimulated macrophages were clearly different. the fingerprints induced by the m1 agonists, ifn-gamma, tnf, lps and lps+ifn-gamma, and the m2 agonists, il-4, tgf-beta1 and il-10, were specific and  readily identifiable. thus, whole-cell maldi-tof ms was able to characterise m1 and m2 macrophage subtypes. in addition, the fingerprints induced by extracellular (group b streptococcus, staphylococcus aureus) or intracellular (bcg, orientia tsutsugamushi, coxiella burnetii) bacteria were bacterium-specific. the whole-cell maldi-tof ms fingerprints therefore revealed the multifaceted activation of human macrophages. this approach opened a new avenue of studies to assess the immune response in the clinical setting, by monitoring the various activation patterns of immune cells in pathological conditions.

TI  == development of a single-tube loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay for detection of four pathogens of bacterial meningitis.
AB  == several loop-mediated isothermal amplification (lamp) assays have been developed  to detect common causative pathogens of bacterial meningitis (bm). however, no lamp assay is reported to detect streptococcus agalactiae and streptococcus suis, which are also among common pathogens of bm. moreover, it is laborious and expensive by performing multiple reactions for each sample to detect bacterial pathogen. thus, we aimed to design and develop a single-tube lamp assay capable of detecting multiple bacterial species, based on the nucleotide sequences of the 16s rrna genes of the bacteria. the nucleotide sequences of the 16s rrna genes of main pathogens involved in bm were aligned to identify conserved regions, which were further used to design broad range specific lamp assay primers. we successfully designed a set of broad range specific lamp assay primers for simultaneous detection of four species including staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. suis and s. agalactiae. the broad range lamp assay was highly specific without cross-reactivity with other bacteria including haemophilus influenzae, neisseria meningitidis and escherichia coli. the sensitivity of our lamp assay was 100-1000 times higher compared with the conventional pcr assay. the bacterial species could be identified after digestion of the lamp products with restriction endonuclease ddei and haeiii.

TI  == quality of bulk tank milk samples from danish dairy herds based on real-time polymerase chain reaction identification of mastitis pathogens.
AB  == results of a commercial real-time pcr analysis for 11 mastitis pathogens from bulk tank milk (btm) samples from all 4,258 danish dairy herds in november 2009 to january 2010 were compared with somatic cell count (scc) and total bacteria count (tbc) estimates in btm. for streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus dysgalactiae, and streptococcus uberis, a low real-time pcr cycle threshold (ct)  value (corresponding to high bacterial dna quantity) was correlated with higher scc and higher tbc. for staphylococcus aureus, low ct values were correlated only with higher scc. for the environmental mastitis pathogens klebsiella spp., enterococcus spp., and escherichia coli, low ct values had a correlation with higher tbc. staphylococcus spp. were found in the btm from all herds, strep. uberis in 95%, staph. aureus in 91%, and strep. dysgalactiae in 86%, whereas e. coli, klebsiella, and strep. agalactiae were found in 61, 13, and 7% of the herds. it is concluded that the real-time pcr used provides results that are related to the milk quality in the herds. real-time pcr can be used in the same way as culture for monitoring btm samples, and is especially useful for bacteria  with low prevalence (e.g., strep. agalactiae).

TI  == [bacteremia in patients hospitalized with cellulitis].
AB  == cellulitis is an acute inflammation of dermis and subcutaneous tissue, usually complicating wounds, ulcers, or dermatosis. even though in these cases it is recommended to perform culture from skin and soft tissue samples, the utility of  blood cultures remains controversial due to the low frequency of positive results. here we report the prevalence of bacteremia in patients with cellulitis  admitted in our hospital, and evaluate the presence of risk factors associated with the occurrence of this event. clinical records of patients with diagnosis of cellulitis admitted between june 2007 and march 2010 were retrospectively reviewed. patients without skin and soft tissue culture and/or blood cultures were excluded. demographic data, presence of comorbidities, and culture results were analyzed. in this period, 140 patients were admitted with this diagnosis. fifty six (40%) of them had positive skin and soft tissue cultures; where methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) was the most frequently isolated bacterium species (35.7%). bacteremia was detected in 8.6% of these cases, where the most frequently isolated bacteria were group g beta haemolytic streptococcus (33%). bacteremia was significantly associated with longer hospital stay (10.5 +/- 8.98 vs. 4.9 +/- 6, p = 0.004). the following variables were significantly associated with the occurrence of positive blood cultures: diabetes (41.7% vs. 14.1%; p = 0.02; or 4.4), positive skin and soft tissue culture (75% vs. 35.2%; p = 0.01; or 5.5), alcoholism (16.7% vs. 3.9%; p = 0.01; or 4.9), and  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (16.7% vs. 0.78%; p = 0.01; or 25.4).

TI  == chemical composition of 8 eucalyptus species' essential oils and the evaluation of their antibacterial, antifungal and antiviral activities.
AB  == background: in 1957, tunisia introduced 117 species of eucalyptus; they have been used as fire wood, for the production of mine wood and to fight erosion. actually, eucalyptus essential oil is traditionally used to treat respiratory tract disorders such as pharyngitis, bronchitis, and sinusitis. a few investigations were reported on the biological activities of eucalyptus oils worldwide. in tunisia, our previous works conducted in 2010 and 2011 had been the first reports to study the antibacterial activities against reference strains. at that time it was not possible to evaluate their antimicrobial activities against  clinical bacterial strains and other pathogens such as virus and fungi. methods:  the essential oils of eight eucalyptus species harvested from the jbel abderrahman, korbous (north east tunisia) and souinet arboreta (north of tunisia) were evaluated for their antimicrobial activities by disc diffusion and microbroth dilution methods against seven bacterial isolates: haemophilus influenzae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes. in addition, the bactericidal, fungicidal and the antiviral activities of the tested oils were carried out. results: twenty five components were identified by gc/fid  and gc/ms. these components were used to correlate with the biological activities of the tested oils. the chemical principal component analysis identified three groups, each of them constituted a chemotype. according to the values of zone diameter and percentage of the inhibition (zdi, % i, respectively), four groups and subgroups of bacterial strains and three groups of fungal strains were characterized by their sensitivity levels to eucalyptus oils. the cytotoxic effect and the antiviral activity varied significantly within eucalyptus species  oils. conclusions: e. odorata showed the strongest activity against s. aureus, h. influenzae, s. agalactiae, s. pyogenes, s. pneumoniae and against all the tested  fungal strains. in addition, e. odorata oil showed the most cytotoxic effect. however, the best antiviral activity appeared with e. bicostata. virus pretreatment with e. bicostata essential oil showed better antiviral activity (ic(50) = 0.7 mg/ml, si = 22.8) than cell-pretreatment (ic(50) = 4.8 mg/ml, si =  3.33). the essential oil of e. astringens showed antiviral activity only when incubated with virus prior to cell infection. this activity was dose-dependent and the antiviral activity diminished with the decreasing essential oil concentration.

TI  == role of the group b antigen of streptococcus agalactiae: a peptidoglycan-anchored polysaccharide involved in cell wall biogenesis.
AB  == streptococcus agalactiae (group b streptococcus, gbs) is a leading cause of infections in neonates and an emerging pathogen in adults. the lancefield group b carbohydrate (gbc) is a peptidoglycan-anchored antigen that defines this species  as a group b streptococcus. despite earlier immunological and biochemical characterizations, the function of this abundant glycopolymer has never been addressed experimentally. here, we inactivated the gene gbco encoding a putative  udp-n-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate:lipid phosphate transferase thought to catalyze the first step of gbc synthesis. indeed, the gbco mutant was unable to synthesize the gbc polymer, and displayed an important growth defect in vitro. electron microscopy study of the gbc-depleted strain of s. agalactiae revealed a  series of growth-related abnormalities: random placement of septa, defective cell division and separation processes, and aberrant cell morphology. furthermore, vancomycin labeling and peptidoglycan structure analysis demonstrated that, in the absence of gbc, cells failed to initiate normal pg synthesis and cannot complete polymerization of the murein sacculus. finally, the subcellular localization of the pg hydrolase pcsb, which has a critical role in cell division of streptococci, was altered in the gbco mutant. collectively, these findings show that gbc is an essential component of the cell wall of s. agalactiae whose function is reminiscent of that of conventional wall teichoic acids found in staphylococcus aureus or bacillus subtilis. furthermore, our findings raise the possibility that gbc-like molecules play a major role in the growth of most if not all beta-hemolytic streptococci.

TI  == update on control of staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus agalactiae for management of mastitis.
AB  == the primary method of spread for s agalactiae and s aureus is from cow to cow, so prevention focuses on within and between herd biosecurity to reduce or eliminate  the reservoir of infection. s agalactiae is an obligate pathogen of the mammary gland, whereas s aureus is more widespread on other cow body sites and in the environment. both organisms cause persistent infections, with s agalactiae typically causing higher scc and bacteria counts in milk. conventional methods of detection through culture perform well at the cow level. in bulk tanks, augmented procedures should be considered. pcr methods show promise of high sensitivity and specificity, at both the cow and bulk tank level. in developed dairy industries,  prevalence of infection has decreased dramatically over the past 30 years for s agalactiae. for s aureus, the herd level of infection remains very high, although with rigorous, consistent application of control measures, within-herd prevalence has decreased. because the milking time is the primary period for new imi, it is  the focal point of most prevention activities. premilking and postmilking teat disinfection and proper stimulation and milk-out with adequately functioning equipment are key factors. there is growing evidence that the use of milking gloves is an integral part of contagious mastitis control and the production of high-quality milk. treatment success is dramatically different between the 2 pathogens. for s agalactiae, eradication can be completed rapidly through a culture and treatment program with minimal culling. for s aureus, treatment success, particularly during lactation, is often disappointing and depends on cow, pathogen, and treatment factors. these factors should be reviewed prior to initiating any treatment to determine the potential for cure. blanket dry cow therapy and strategic culling are important control procedures for contagious mastitis pathogens. maintaining a closed herd or, at minimum, adhering to clearly defined biosecurity protocols is critical to reduce risk of reintroduction of s agalactiae or the addition of new, potentially more virulent strains of s aureus  to endemic herds.

AB  == there are a number of important issues for the dairy practitioner to consider in  designing the most appropriate mastitis microbiological service for his or her clients. these include the decision to use enhancement tools or selective agars to optimize sensitivity and specificity. the service should include a monthly btc service that monitors for the important contagious mastitis organisms: s aureus,  s agalactia, and mycoplasma. at the cow level, a zero tolerance program to protect healthy cows from exposure to contagious mastitis will require a routine  culture service to monitor for these pathogens in new herd additions, clinical cases, and all fresh cows and heifers. a wide variety of additional benefits for  maintaining good udder health and the production of quality milk can come from a  more comprehensive diagnostic service that looks at both individual cow and bulk  tank milk. finally, more practitioners can help their clients economically by implementation of an on-farm tnt culture service and significantly reducing the use of intramammary therapy.

TI  == relationship between lactobacilli and opportunistic bacterial pathogens associated with vaginitis.
AB  == background: vaginitis, is an infectious inflammation of the vaginal mucosa, which sometimes involves the vulva. the balance of the vaginal flora is maintained by the lactobacilli and its protective and probiotic role in treating and preventing vaginal infection by producing antagonizing compounds which are regarded as safe  for humans. aim: the aim of this study was to evaluate the protective role of lactobacilli against common bacterial opportunistic pathogens in vaginitis and study the effects of some antibiotics on lactobacilli isolates. materials and methods: in this study (110) vaginal swabs were obtained from women suffering from vaginitis who admitted to babylon hospital of maternity and paediatrics in babylon province, iraq. the study involved the role of intrauterine device among  married women with vaginitis and also involved isolation of opportunistic bacterial isolates among pregnant and non pregnant women. this study also involved studying probiotic role of lactobacilli by production of some defense factors like hydrogen peroxide, bacteriocin, and lactic acid. results: results revealed that a total of 130 bacterial isolates were obtained. intrauterine device was a predisposing factor for vaginitis. the most common opportunistic bacterial isolates were staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, streptococcus agalactiae, and klebsiella pneumoniae. all lactobacilli were hydrogen peroxide producers while some isolates were bacteriocin producers that inhibited some of opportunistic pathogens (s. aureus, e. coli). lactobacilli were sensitive to erythromycin while 93.3% of them were resistant to ciprofloxacin and (40%, 53.3%) of them were resistant to amoxicillin and gentamycin respectively. results revealed that there was an inverse relationship between lactobacilli presence and organisms causing vaginitis. this may be attributed to the production of defense  factors by lactobacilli. conclusion: the types of antibiotics used to treat vaginitis must be very selective in order not to kill the beneficial bacteria (lactobacilli) that help in preservation of vaginal health and ecosystem as being one of the probiotic bacteria.

AB  == the major pathogens causing mastitis were evaluated by multiplex-polymerase chain reaction (m-pcr) with self-designed primers in four quarters of the first, third, and fifth parities in industrial, semi-industrial, and traditional dairy cattle farms in iran. with the incidence of infection in the quarters by staphylococcus  aureus and streptococcus agalactiae, the mean log somatic cell count (log scc) increased from 5.06 to 5.77. the smallest changes occurred with escherichia coli. contagious pathogens, when compared with environmental pathogens, were more prevalent and common and created more profound quantitative and qualitative changes in scc profiles. the second part of the study surveyed the diversity of contaminating pathogens and their effect on quantitative and qualitative profiles of somatic cells. m-pcr was used to determine the absence (m-pcr(-)) and presence of one (m-pcr(+1)), two (m-pcr(+2)), and three (m-pcr(+3)) major pathogens in raw milk samples. quarter log scc increased from 5.06 (for m-pcr(-1)) to 5.5 (for m-pcr(+1)), 5.7 (for m-pcr(+2)), and 6 (for m-pcr(+3)). percent changes in polymorphonuclears (pmns) were not significant between different quarters and parities but were significant between different farms in terms of pathogen diversity (p < 0.05). therefore, by increasing the number of types of major pathogens involved in subclinical mastitis, scc of udder quarters and the proportion of pmns significantly increased, whereas the proportion of lymphocytes significantly decreased. this subject is very important in increasing the shelf life of dairy products, because pmns are introduced to the enzymatic pools.

TI  == antibacterial activity of wine phenolic compounds and oenological extracts against potential respiratory pathogens.
AB  == aims: to investigate the effect of seven wine phenolic compounds and six oenological phenolic extracts on the growth of pathogenic bacteria associated with respiratory diseases (pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, moraxella catarrhalis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus sp group f, streptococcus agalactiae and streptococcus pneumoniae). methods and results: antimicrobial activity was determined using a microdilution method and quantified as ic(50) . mor. catarrhalis was the most susceptible specie to phenolic compounds and extracts. gallic acid and ethyl gallate were the compounds that showed the greatest antimicrobial activity. regarding phenolic extracts, gse (grape seed extract) and gse-o (oligomeric-rich fraction from gse) were the ones  that displayed the strongest antimicrobial effects. conclusions: results highlight the antimicrobial properties of wine phenolic compounds and oenological extracts against potential respiratory pathogens. the antimicrobial activity of wine phenolic compounds was influenced by the type of phenolic compounds. gram-negative bacteria were more susceptible than gram-positive bacteria to the action of phenolic compounds and extracts; however, the effect was species-dependent. significance and impact of study: the ability to inhibit the growth of respiratory pathogenic bacteria as shown by several wine phenolic compounds and oenological extracts warrants further investigations to explore the use of grape and wine preparations in oral hygiene.

TI  == acute toxicity evaluation, antibacterial, antioxidant and immunomodulatory effects of melastoma malabathricum.
AB  == melastoma malabathricum (mm) is a well-known plant in malaysian traditional medicine, locally known as senduduk. its ethanol and aqueous extracts have been used in the present investigation to study the immunomodulatory role on human peripheral blood mononuclear cell (pbmc), and the dpph, abts and frap free radical scavenging activities were also measured. total flavonoids and total phenolic contents were assayed and the antibacterial effect was tested against four species of bacteria; two gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus agalactiae) and two gram-negative (escherichia coli and klebsilla pneumonia). the tests were carried out using the disc diffusion, minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) methods. moreover, the acute toxicity was evaluated in vivo on the ethanol extract of mm to establish its safety when administered orally. in our results, both extracts of mm showed abilities to scavenge dpph and abts free radicals, ic(50) values: (11.599 +/- 0.84, 10.573 +/- 0.58 micromol/l) and (62.657 +/- 0.78, 63.939 +/- 0.48 micromol/l) for ethanol and aqueous extracts respectively.  indeed the ethanol extract evidenced high phenolic content (384.33 +/- 0.005 mg/g), flavonoids contents (85.8 +/- 0.009 mg/g) and ferric reducing antioxidant  power (33,590 +/- 0.038 mmol/g), with high activity against s. aureus and s. agalactiae (11 +/- 0.3 and 12 +/- 0.6 mm inhibition zones). likewise, the percentage of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc) viability was increased in response to mm, ic(50) values (1.781 +/- 1.2 and 6.545 +/- 0.93 microg/ml) for ethanol and aqueous extracts, respectively. in addition, our results showed that  the mm extract is safe even at a high dose of 5,000 mg/kg and has no oral toxicity. these findings suggest the excellent medicinal bioactivity of mm and explain the popularity of this plant in the folk medicine as a remedy for different illnesses.

TI  == protection against staphylococcus aureus by antibody to the polyglycerolphosphate backbone of heterologous lipoteichoic acid.
AB  == type 1 lipoteichoic acid (lta) is present in many clinically important gram-positive bacteria, including enterococci, streptococci, and staphylococci, and antibodies against lta have been shown to opsonize nonencapsulated enterococcus faecalis strains. in the present study, we show that antibodies against e. faecalis lta also bind to type 1 lta from other gram-positive species  and opsonized staphylocccus epidermidis and staphylcoccus aureus strains as well  as group b streptococci. inhibition studies using teichoic acid oligomers indicated that cross-reactive opsonic antibodies bind to the teichoic acid backbone. passive immunization with rabbit antibodies against e. faecalis lta promoted the clearance of bacteremia by e. faecalis and s. epidermidis in mice. furthermore, passive protection also reduced mortality in a murine s. aureus peritonitis model. the effectiveness of rabbit antibody against lta suggests that this conserved bacterial structure could function as a single vaccine antigen that targets multiple gram-positive pathogens.

TI  == identification of conserved antigens from staphylococcal and streptococcal pathogens.
AB  == the design of vaccines containing epitopes shared between different human pathogens may lead to cross-species protection. in order to identify potentially  conserved bacterial antigens, bacteriophage expression libraries of genomic dna from streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes were probed with human sera from staphylococcus aureus-infected and healthy individuals. by comparison with previous screening data from staphylococcus epidermidis and staph. aureus, putative antigenic, conserved domains across the genera were identified. in particular, three potentially antigenic conserved regions were identified based on the n-terminal domain of sacol0609 (sdrd), the c-terminal domain of sacol0723 (scab) and the c-terminus of sacol1140 (isda) from staph. aureus. the three domains were overexpressed, recombinant proteins were purified and polyclonal antisera raised against them recognized cell surface-located proteins from both staphylococcal and streptococcal species. the antisera were also able to opsonize both staph. aureus and strep. agalactiae thereby increasing their phagocytic uptake by human neutrophils. the conserved antigenic domains therefore represent potential cross-protective vaccine candidates.

TI  == gap1 functions as a molecular chaperone to stabilize its interactive partner gap3 during biogenesis of serine-rich repeat bacterial adhesin.
AB  == serine-rich repeat glycoproteins (srrps) are important bacterial adhesins that are conserved in streptococci and staphylococci. fimbriae-associated protein (fap1) from streptococcus parasanguinis, was the first srrp identified; it plays  an important role in bacterial biofilm formation. a gene cluster encoding glycosyltransferases and accessory secretion components is required for fap1 biogenesis. two glycosylation-associated proteins, gap1 and gap3 within the cluster, interact with each other and function in concert in fap1 biogenesis. here we report the new molecular events underlying contribution of the interaction to fap1 biogenesis. the gap1-deficient mutant rendered gap3 unstable  and degraded in vitro and in vivo. inactivation of a gene encoding protease clpp  reversed the phenotype of the gap1 mutant, suggesting that clpp is responsible for degradation of gap3. molecular chaperone groel was co-purified with gap3 only when gap1 was absent and also reacted with gap1 monoclonal antibody, suggesting that gap1 functions as a specific chaperone for gap3. the n-terminal interacting  domains of gap1 mediated the gap3 stability and fap1 biogenesis. gap1 homologues  from streptococcus agalactiae and staphylococcus aureus also interacted with and  stabilized corresponding gap3 homologues, suggesting that the chaperone activity  of the gap1 homologues is common in biogenesis of srrps.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity of combretum molle (combretaceae) against staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus agalactiae isolated from crossbred dairy  cows with clinical mastitis.
AB  == following the rapidly expanding dairy enterprise, mastitis has remained the most  economically damaging disease. the objective of this study was mainly to investigate the in vitro antibacterial activities of ethanol extracts of combretum molle (r.br.ex.g.don) engl & diels (combretaceae) against antibiotic-resistant and susceptible staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus agalactiae isolated from clinical cases of bovine mastitis using agar disc diffusion method. the leaf and bark extracts showed antibacterial activity against s. aureus at concentrations of 3 mg/ml while the stem and seed extract did not show any bioactivity. although both leaf and bark extracts were handled in the same manner, the antibacterial activity of the bark extract against the bacterial strains had declined gradually to a lower level as time advanced after  extraction. the leaf extract had sustained bioactivity for longer duration. the susceptibility of the bacteria to the leaf extract is not obviously different between s. aureus and s. agalactiae. also, there was no difference in susceptibility to the leaf extract between the antibiotic-resistant and antibiotic-sensitive bacteria. further phytochemical and in vivo efficacy and safety studies are required to evaluate the therapeutic value of the plant against bovine mastitis.

TI  == a proposal of interpretive criteria for cefoperazone applicable to bovine mastitis pathogens.
AB  == the correct assessment of mastitis pathogens for their susceptibility/resistance  to cefoperazone is currently hampered by the lack of harmonized test conditions and interpretive criteria. the aim of this study was to provide a proposal for clinical breakpoints of cefoperazone which are applicable to staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, escherichia coli, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus dysgalactiae and streptococcus uberis from cases of bovine mastitis and better reflect the situation in the bovine udder than breakpoints adopted from human medicine. for this, pharmacological data and clinical efficacy data of the documents submitted for approval of cefoperazone have been revisited. in addition, 1086 bacterial pathogens of the aforementioned  six species/groups collected in germany and in the usa during recent years were tested in parallel for their cefoperazone mics and the zone diameters using a 75  mug disk. subsequently, mics were plotted against zone diameters. based on the pharmacological data, the clinical efficacy and the microbiological data, a proposal was made for veterinary-specific breakpoints which classify members of the aforementioned species/groups as (a) susceptible to cefoperazone when their mic is </= 2 mug/ml and their zone diameters are >/= 27 mm (staphylococci or e. coli) or >/= 21 mm (streptococci), (b) intermediate when their mic is 4 mug/ml and their zone diameters are 22-26 mm (staphylococci or e. coli) or 16-20mm (streptococci), and (c) resistant when their mic is >/= 8 mug/ml and their zone diameters are </= 21 mm (staphylococci or e. coli) or </= 15 mm (streptococci).

AB  == food products, such as milk and meat products including cheese, milk powder, fermented milk, sausage, etc. are susceptible to the contamination by pathogenic  and deteriorative bacteria. these bacteria include listeria monocytogens, staphylococcus aureus, enterobacter sakazakii, escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella spp., vibrio parahaemolyticus, streptococcus agalactiae and pseudomonas fluorescens, etc. traditional methods for the detection of these microorganisms are laborious and time consuming. therefore, rapid and accurate diagnostic methods are needed. in this study, we designed the dna probes and pcr  primers for the detection of aforementioned microorganisms. by using two sets of  multiplex pcr, followed by a chromogenic macroarray system, these organisms in milk or other food products could be simultaneously detected. when the system was used for the inspection of milk or meat homogenate containing 10(0) target cells  per milliliter or gram of the sample, all these bacterial species could be identified after an 8h pre-enrichment step. the system consisting of a multiplex  pcr step followed by macroarray allowed us to detect multiple target bacterial species simultaneously without the use of agarose gel electrophoresis. compared to the commonly used multiplex pcr method, this approach has the additional advantage of detecting more bacterial strains because some bacterial strains generate pcr products with the same molecular sizes which can be differentiated by macroarray but not by electrophoresis.

TI  == molecular epidemiology of mastitis pathogens of dairy cattle and comparative relevance to humans.
AB  == mastitis, inflammation of the mammary gland, can be caused by a wide range of organisms, including gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, mycoplasmas and algae. many microbial species that are common causes of bovine mastitis, such as  escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus agalactiae and staphylococcus aureus also occur as commensals or pathogens of humans whereas other causative species, such as streptococcus uberis, streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae or staphylococcus chromogenes, are almost exclusively found in animals. a wide range of molecular typing methods have been used in the past two decades to investigate the epidemiology of bovine mastitis at the subspecies  level. these include comparative typing methods that are based on electrophoretic banding patterns, library typing methods that are based on the sequence of selected genes, virulence gene arrays and whole genome sequencing projects. the strain distribution of mastitis pathogens has been investigated within individual animals and across animals, herds, countries and host species, with consideration of the mammary gland, other animal or human body sites, and environmental sources. molecular epidemiological studies have contributed considerably to our understanding of sources, transmission routes, and prognosis for many bovine mastitis pathogens and to our understanding of mechanisms of host-adaptation and  disease causation. in this review, we summarize knowledge gleaned from two decades of molecular epidemiological studies of mastitis pathogens in dairy cattle and discuss aspects of comparative relevance to human medicine.

TI  == identification and characterization of two novel antimicrobial peptides, temporin-ra and temporin-rb, from skin secretions of the marsh frog (rana ridibunda).
AB  == in this study, two novel antimicrobial peptides from the skin secretions of the marsh frog, rana ridibunda, named temporin-ra and temporin-rb, were identified and purified using rp-hplc. temporin-ra and temporin-rb are composed of 14 and 12 amino acids, respectively. our results show that these peptides have inhibitory effects on both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, especially antibiotic resistant strains prevalent in hospitals, such as staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus agalactiae. the sequences and molecular weights of these peptides were determined using tandem ms. the molecular masses were found to be 1242.5 da  for temporin-rb and 1585.1 da for temporin-ra. human red blood cells tolerated well exposure to temporin-ra and temporin-rb, which, at a concentration of 60 microg/ml, induced 1.3% and 1.1% hemolysis, respectively. mic values of these peptides are suitable for potent antimicrobial peptides. the low hemolytic effect and wide-spectrum antimicrobial activity suggest a possible therapeutic application of these novel peptides.

TI  == rapid identification of bovine mastitis pathogens by high-resolution melt analysis of 16s rdna sequences.
AB  == accurate identification of mastitis pathogens is often compromised when using conventional culture-based methods. here, we report a novel, rapid assay tested for speciation of bacterial mastitis pathogens using high-resolution melt analysis (hrma) of 16s rdna sequences. real-time pcr amplification of 16s rrna gene fragment, spanning the variable region v5 and v6 was performed with a resulting amplicon of 290bp. first, a library was generated of melt curves of 9 common pathogens that are implicated in bovine mastitis. six of the isolates, escherichia coli, streptococcus agalactiae, klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus  uberis, staphylococcus aureus and mycoplasma bovis, were type strains while the other 3, arcanobacterium pyogenes, corynebacterium bovis and streptococcus dysgalactiae, were bovine mastitis field isolates. four of the type strains, e. coli, s. agalactiae, k. pneumoniae and s. aureus, were found to be of human origin, while the other 3 type strains were isolated from bovine infections. secondly, the melt curves and corresponding amplicon sequences of a. pyogenes, e. coli, s. agalactiae, s. dysgalactiae, k. pneumoniae, s. uberis and s. aureus were compared with 10 bovine mastitis field isolates of each pathogen. based on the distinct differences in melt curves and sequences between human and bovine isolates of e. coli and k. pneumoniae, it was deemed necessary to select a set of bovine strains for these pathogens to be used as reference strains in the hrma. next, the hrma was validated by three interpreters analyzing the differential clustering pattern of melt curves of 60 bacterial cultures obtained from mastitis milk samples. the three test interpreters were blinded to the culture and sequencing results of the isolates. overall accuracy of the validation assay was  95% as there was difficulty in identifying the streptococci due to heterogeneity  observed in the pcr amplicons of s. uberis. the present study revealed that broad-range real-time pcr with hrma can be used as a powerful, fast and low-cost  tool for the differentiation of clinically important bacterial mastitis pathogens.

TI  == cellular compatibility of biomineralized zno nanoparticles based on prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems.
AB  == zinc oxide nanoparticles (nps) with the size of approximately 100 nm were prepared via a facile biomineralization process in the template of silk fibroin (sf) peptide at room temperature. these zno nps have shown the remarkable behavior of low toxicity to gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus agalactiae), gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli), and eukaryotic cells (mouse l929 fibroblasts). bacteriological testing indicated that zno nps presented a 50% inhibitory effect on streptococcus agalactiae at the concentrations of >100 mm, whereas at the same concentrations, the growth of staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli were hardly inhibited. on the other hand, a remarkable proliferation of staphylococcus aureus or escherichia coli was observed at the concentrations of zno nps <50 mm. moreover, the cytotoxicity test demonstrated that zno nps mineralized with sf peptide possessed a low toxicity to mouse l929 fibroblasts. the sf peptide coated on the surface of zno nps permitted greater adhesion and consequently greater proliferation of mouse l929 fibroblasts. besides, from tem micrographs of the cell ultrastructure, endocytosis of nps into the cytoplasm can be detected and the ultrastructure of the cell underwent few changes. the cell membrane retained integrity, euchromatin dispersed homogenously inside the cytoplasm, the mitochondrial architecture remained intact, and no intracellular vacuoles were observed. high-resolution transmission electron microscopy images and selected area electron diffraction patterns of ultrathin cell sections indicated that the crystal structure of nps was not damaged by the organelle or cytoplasm. all these observations indicated that zno nps mineralized with the sf peptide possess good cytocompatibility.

TI  == structural differences between the streptococcus agalactiae housekeeping and pilus-specific sortases: srta and srtc1.
AB  == the assembly of pili on the cell wall of gram-positive bacteria requires transpeptidase enzymes called sortases. in streptococcus agalactiae, the pi-1 pilus island of strain 2603v/r encodes two pilus-specific sortases (srtc1 and srtc2) and three pilins (gbs80, gbs52 and gbs104). although either pilus-specific sortase is sufficient for the polymerization of the major pilin, gbs80, incorporation of the minor pilins gbs52 and gbs104 into the pilus structure requires srtc1 and srtc2, respectively. the s. agalactiae housekeeping sortase, srta, whose gene is present at a different location and does not catalyze pilus polymerization, was shown to be involved in cell wall anchoring of pilus polymers. to understand the structural basis of sortases involved in such diverse functions, we determined the crystal structures of s. agalactiae srtc1 and srta.  both enzymes are made of an eight-stranded beta-barrel core with variations in their active site architecture. srta exhibits a catalytic triad arrangement similar to that in streptococcus pyogenes srta but different from that in staphylococcus aureus srta. in contrast, the srtc1 enzyme contains an n-terminal  helical domain and a 'lid' in its putative active site, which is similar to that  seen in streptococcus pneumoniae pilus-specific sortases, although with subtle differences in positioning and composition. to understand the effect of such differences on substrate recognition, we have also determined the crystal structure of a srtc1 mutant, in which the conserved dp(w/f/y) motif was replaced  with the sorting signal motif of gbs80, ipntg. by comparing the structures of wt  wild type srta and srtc1 and the 'lid' mutant of srtc1, we propose that structural elements within the active site and the lid may be important for defining the role of specific sortase in pili biogenesis.

TI  == frequency and antibiotic susceptibility of gram-positive bacteria in makkah hospitals.
AB  == background and objective: gram-positive bacteria are important nosocomial pathogens. the objective of this study was to estimate the frequencies and resistance rates of gram-positive pathogens isolated from hospitals in makkah, saudi arabia. design and setting: prospective study at three makkah hospitals from may 2008 to april 2009. patients and methods: clinical isolates were collected and demographic and laboratory data were recorded. standard microbiological methods were used to identify the organisms and test for antimicrobial susceptibility. the results were interpreted according to the clinical laboratory standards institute (clsi) guidelines. results: clinical isolates were collected from 1087 patients. gram-positive pathogens infected all  age groups, but had no gender predominance. staphylococcus aureus was the most common cause of wound infection and accounted for more than half of the clinical  isolates (688 cases). coagulase-negative staphylococcus (cons) was a common isolate from blood cultures. wounds were the most common site of infection (37.6%). enterococcus spp. and streptococcus agalactiae were the second most common bacteria (26%). the resistance rates of s aureus and cons isolates were 39.4% and 82.4% for oxacillin, respectively. among the streptococci, the resistance rates of streptococcus pneumoniae were 21.1% and 16.7% for ampicillin  and erythromycin, respectively. conclusions: s aureus infections were found to be very common in the makkah hospitals. infection prevention, control measures and continuous monitoring for antibiotic susceptibility are necessary to reduce these and other nosocomial infections.

TI  == serotypes and antibiotic resistance in group b streptococcus isolated from patients at the maternity hospital, kuwait.
AB  == a total of 143 group b streptococcus (gbs) isolates collected from mothers at the maternity hospital in kuwait were investigated for their serotypes and antibiotic resistance, and screened by pcr for the carriage of genes for resistance to tetracycline (tetk, tetm, tetl, teto), erythromycin (erma, ermb, ermc, ermtr, ermm, mefa, mefe, msra) and aminoglycosides (aph3, ant4, ant6). all isolates were serotyped using a latex agglutination test. most of the isolates belonged to serotypes v (38.5 %), iii (20.9 %), ia (7.7 %) and ii (11.2 %). sixteen isolates  (11.2 %) were nontypable. all isolates were susceptible to penicillin, ampicillin and cefotaxime (mics 0.016-0.094 microg ml(-1)) but were resistant to trimethoprim (92.3 %), tetracycline (89.5 %), minocycline (89.5 %), high-level kanamycin (76.9 %), chloramphenicol (30.0 %), erythromycin (12.6 %), clindamycin  (7.0 %), high-level streptomycin (3.5 %) and ciprofloxacin (0.7 %). the tetracycline-resistant isolates contained tetm (94.5 %), teto (3.9 %), tetl (1.6  %) and tetk (0.8 %). the erythromycin-resistant isolates contained ermb (61.1 %), ermtr (38.9 %), erma (5.5 %), mefa (5.5 %) and mefe (11 %). all high-level kanamycin-resistant isolates contained aph3. one of the high-level streptomycin-resistant isolates contained ant6. partial dna sequencing of aph3 revealed sequences with 99 % similarity to aph3 found in enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, suggesting that the gbs isolates could have acquired aph3 from other gram-positive cocci. the high proportion of isolates with resistance to tetracycline, high-level kanamycin and trimethoprim, and the increase in the prevalence of erythromycin resistance, represents an emerging public health concern that needs further surveillance.

TI  == [the characteristics of gram-positive bacteria isolated from skin lesions observed in ambulatory patients and the assessment of their susceptibility to antimicrobial drugs].
AB  == the bacterial skin and soft-tissue infections occur commonly and are characterized by more or less intensified changes within skin and subcutaneous tissue. the bacterial skin infections give rise to significant therapeutic problems associated with increasing resistance etiological agents of these infections to antibiotics and chemotherapeutics. the aim of this study was to assess the distribution of various gram-positive microorganisms in skin lesion observed in ambulatory patients in a period from june 2005 to december 2006. there were 116 bacterial strains isolated and identified from clinical samples: staphylococcus aureus, coagulase - negative staphylococi (s.epidermidis, s. xylosus, s.capitis, s.saccharolyticus), propionobacterium acnes, streptococcus spp. (s.agalactiae, s.pyogenes) i corynebacterium spp. (c. striatum, c. amycolatum, c. aquaticum). in the further part of this study we analyzed a profile of their susceptibility to antibiotics and chemotherapeutics in relation  to drugs recommended for the empirical therapy. the resultant resistance patterns among the examined bacterial isolates are indicative of certain divergence between recommended empirical antibiotic therapy and actual antimicrobial susceptibility of many etiologic factors of skin and soft-tissue infections.

TI  == multiplex pcr and reverse line blot hybridization assay (mpcr/rlb).
AB  == multiplex pcr/reverse line blot hybridization assay allows the detection of up to 43 molecular targets in 43 samples using one multiplex pcr reaction followed by probe hybridization on a nylon membrane, which is re-usable. probes are 5' amine  modified to allow fixation to the membrane. primers are 5' biotin modified which  allows detection of hybridized pcr products using streptavidin-peroxidase and a chemiluminescent substrate via photosensitive film. with low setup and consumable costs, this technique is inexpensive (approximately us$2 per sample), high throughput (multiple membranes can be processed simultaneously) and has a short turnaround time (approximately 10 hours). the technique can be utilized in a number of ways. multiple probes can be designed to detect sequence variation within a single amplified product, or multiple products can be amplified simultaneously, with one (or more) probes used for subsequent detection. a combination of both approaches can also be used within a single assay. the ability to include multiple probes for a single target sequence makes the assay highly specific. published applications of mpcr/rlb include detection of antibiotic resistance genes(1,2), typing of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus  aureus(3-5) and salmonella sp(6), molecular serotyping of streptococcus pneumoniae(7,8), streptococcus agalactiae(9) and enteroviruses(10,11), identification of mycobacterium sp(12), detection of genital(13-15) and respiratory tract(16) and other(17) pathogens and detection and identification of mollicutes(18). however, the versatility of the technique means the applications  are virtually limitless and not restricted to molecular analysis of micro-organisms. the five steps in mpcr/rlb are a) primer and probe design, b) dna extraction and pcr amplification c) preparation of the membrane, d) hybridization and detection, and e) regeneration of the membrane.

TI  == high-level fluorescence labeling of gram-positive pathogens.
AB  == fluorescence labeling of bacterial pathogens has a broad range of interesting applications including the observation of living bacteria within host cells. we constructed a novel vector based on the e. coli streptococcal shuttle plasmid pat28 that can propagate in numerous bacterial species from different genera. the plasmid harbors a promoterless copy of the green fluorescent variant gene egfp under the control of the camp-factor gene (cfb) promoter of streptococcus agalactiae and was designated pbsu101. upon transfer of the plasmid into streptococci, the bacteria show a distinct and easily detectable fluorescence using a standard fluorescence microscope and quantification by facs-analysis demonstrated values that were 10-50 times increased over the respective controls. to assess the suitability of the construct for high efficiency fluorescence labeling in different gram-positive pathogens, numerous species were transformed. we successfully labeled streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus anginosus and staphylococcus aureus strains utilizing the egfp reporter plasmid pbsu101. in all of these species the presence of the cfb promoter construct resulted in high-level egfp expression that could be further increased by growing the streptococcal and enterococcal cultures under high oxygen conditions through continuous aeration.

TI  == investigations on the pattern recognition molecule m-ficolin: quantitative aspects of bacterial binding and leukocyte association.
AB  == m-ficolin is a prm of the innate immune system, found in serum and associated with leukocytes. we used the soluble form to study specificity toward gram-positive bacteria and characterized and quantified cell-associated m-ficolin. the binding of m-ficolin to capsulated and noncapsulated strains of streptococcus agalactiae (gbs) and staphylococcus aureus was investigated. we did not observe binding of m-ficolin to any of 13 serotypes of s. aureus. dose-dependent binding of m-ficolin was demonstrated for all of the capsulated gbs strains. the binding was abolished by prior treatment of the bacteria with sialidase, indicating that sialic acid is the ligand for m-ficolin on these bacteria. glcnac could inhibit the binding, suggesting that m-ficolin binds via its fbg. m-ficolin was found associated with the complement-activating enzyme in  serum, and m-ficolin bound to gbs mediated activation of the complement system. m-ficolin expression on leukocytes was evaluated by flow cytometry with anti-m-ficolin mab. total m-ficolin of different leukocytes was quantified in detergent extracts. monocytes and granulocytes showed similar m-ficolin surface expression, 1.1 x 10(5) and 0.7 x 10(5) m-ficolin molecules/cell, respectively. the total m-ficolin content of the cells was 1.5 x 10(6) molecules/monocyte and approximately one-third of this for granulocytes. lymphocytes contained <1.5% of  the amount estimated for monocytes, and none was revealed on the surface of lymphocytes by flow cytometry. immunohistochemical analysis of the distribution of m-ficolin in 25 tissues revealed staining of only granulocytes and monocytes.  reported m-ficolin expression by type ii pneumocytes could not be verified. we demonstrate the specific binding of m-ficolin to sialic acids in the capsule of gbs and give quantitative aspects of the cell-associated m-ficolin.

TI  == risk factors associated with short-term post-treatment outcomes of clinical mastitis.
AB  == the objectives of this study were to characterize 60-d outcomes after treatment of mild (abnormal milk) and moderate (abnormal milk and abnormal udder) cases of  clinical mastitis (cm) occurring in a single quarter of cows on wisconsin farms (n=4) and to determine risk factors associated with those outcomes. duplicate milk samples were collected from the affected quarter of each cow for microbiological analysis at the onset of cm (pre) and 21 d later (post). cows were treated only in the affected quarter using an intramammary product containing 125 mg of ceftiofur. bacteriological cure was defined as absence of pathogens in the post sample obtained from the enrolled quarter. recurrence was defined for the cow when cm occurred after the milk-withholding period for the enrolled case of cm. retention in the herd was defined when a cow was retained within the herd for the 60-d follow-up period. somatic cell count reduction (sccr) was defined at the cow level as somatic cell count (scc) below 200,000 cells/ml at the dairy herd improvement association test day occurring between 21  to 55 d post-treatment. the effects of farm, days in milk, parity, severity, microbiological diagnosis at pre, previous milk yield, previous scc, previous occurrence of cm and treatment duration on selected post-treatment outcomes were  assessed using chi-squared analysis and logistic regression. microbiological results at pre were distributed as: escherichia coli (n=14), klebsiella spp. (n=11), enterobacter spp. (n=8), serratia spp. (n=7), other gram-negative species (n=3), streptococcus spp. (n=25), coagulase-negative staphylococci (n=4); staphylococcus aureus (n=1); streptococcus agalactiae (n=1), other gram-positive  species (n=9), and culture negative (n=60). treated quarters were more likely to  experience bacteriological cure when the cow experienced cm for the first time in the lactation and when no pathogen was recovered from pre milk samples obtained from the enrolled quarter. parity and bacteriological cure were associated with the probability of recurrence. greater milk yield at previous dairy herd improvement test was the most important predictor for retention within the herd.  when scc before cm was >200,000 cells/ml the probability of having sccr after treatment was decreased. when the case experienced bacteriological cure, the cow  was less likely to experience recurrent cases and was more likely to have sccr below 200,000 cells/ml. post-treatment outcomes, such as recurrence and sccr, are strongly associated with bacteriological cure and, when monitored, can be used to help determine if a treatment has been successful. information about the etiology of cm, history of clinical and subclinical mastitis, and parity are useful to review when making strategic treatment decisions.

TI  == assessment of an extraction protocol to detect the major mastitis-causing pathogens in bovine milk.
AB  == despite all efforts to control its spread, mastitis remains the most costly disease for dairy farmers worldwide. one key component of better control of this  disease is identification of the causative bacterial agent during udder infections in cows. mastitis is complex, however, given the diversity of pathogens that must be identified. development of a rapid and efficient bacterial species identification tool is thus necessary. this study was conducted to demonstrate the feasibility of bacterial dna extraction for the automated molecular detection of major mastitis-causing pathogens directly in milk samples  to complement traditional microbiological identification. extraction and detection procedures were designed and optimized to achieve detection in a respectable time frame, at a reasonable cost, and with a high throughput capacity. the following species were identified: staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, streptococcus uberis, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus dysgalactiae, and klebsiella spp. (including klebsiella oxytoca and klebsiella pneumoniae). the detection procedure includes specific genomic dna amplification  by multiplex pcr for each species, separation by capillary electrophoresis, and laser-assisted automated detection. the specificity of the primers was assessed with a panel of bacteria representing mastitis-negative control species. the extraction protocol comprised multiple steps, starting with centrifugation for fat removal, followed by heating in the presence of a cation exchange resin to trap divalent ions. the analytical sensitivity was 100 cfu/ml for milk samples spiked with staph. aureus, strep. dysgalactiae, and e. coli, with a tendency for  k. pneumoniae. the detection limit was 500 cfu/ml for strep. uberis and strep. agalactiae. the overall diagnostic sensitivity (95.4%) and specificity (97.3%) were determined in a double-blind randomized assay by processing 172 clinical milk samples with microbiological characterization as the gold standard. when the physical nature of the milk samples was too altered, dna purification with a magnetic bead-based system was used. of the apparent false-positive samples, 5 were identified by specific microbiological analysis as true-positive staph. aureus co-infections, with further confirmation by ribosomal 16s sequencing. the  proposed methodology could, therefore, become an interesting tool for automated pcr detection of major mastitis pathogens in dairy cattle.

TI  == influence of storage and preservation on microbiological quality of silo ovine milk.
AB  == this study was designed to analyze the effects of the storage and preservation conditions on counts of mesophilic, thermoduric, psychotrophic, coliform, escherichia coli, streptococcus agalactiae, and staphylococcus aureus organisms in silo ovine milk. a total of 910 analytical determinations were conducted from  aliquots of 10 silo ovine milks. the conditions tested were unpreserved and azidiol-preserved milk stored at 4 degrees c, and unpreserved milk stored at -20  degrees c. milk aged 2, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h post-collection for refrigerated aliquots, and 7, 15, and 30 d post-collection for frozen aliquots. the factors silo and storage conditions significantly contributed to variation of all microbiological variables, although milk age effect within storage was only significant for mesophilic, psychrotrophic, and coliform bacteria counts. in refrigerated raw milk, mesophile, psychrotroph, and coliform counts significantly increased over 96 h post-collection, whereas the other groups and bacteria species tested maintained their initial concentration. in all cases, azidiol preservation maintained the initial bacterial concentration in raw sheep milk under refrigeration throughout 96 h. thus, azidiol was a suitable preservative for microbiological studies in sheep milk. smallest counts were registered for frozen samples, particularly for coliforms, e. coli, strep. agalactiae and staph. aureus. estimates of mesophilic, thermoduric and psychrotrophic organisms showed  similar values on both azidiol-preserved and frozen milk samples. coliforms and e. coli counts significantly decrease over time after freezing. consequently, freezing at -20 degrees c could also be appropriate for analysis of mesophilic, thermoduric, and psychrotrophic bacterial groups, but not for coliforms or mammary pathogens.

TI  == a death due to subinvolution of the uteroplacental arteries.
AB  == a 19-year-old g1p0 caucasian woman died 8 days postpartum because of the subinvolution of the uteroplacental arteries. microscopic examination of the placental implantation site revealed large, dilated spiral arteries containing partially occluding thrombi in the superficial myometrium. the presence of cytotrophoblasts within and surrounding the spiral arteries was confirmed by low  molecular weight cytokeratin immunohistochemistry. infection of the cesarean section incision site was demonstrated by the growth of staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus agalactiae group b in the wound as well as the intrauterine blood clot. although subinvolution of the placental site may be a cause of delayed postpartum hemorrhage and significant morbidity, the underlying pathophysiologic  mechanism is unknown.

TI  == the effect of lemongrass oil and its major components on clinical isolate mastitis pathogens and their mechanisms of action on staphylococcus aureus dmst 4745.
AB  == the aims of this study were to investigate the antibacterial activity of lemongrass oil (lg) and its major components which were citral, geraniol and myrcene, against four strains of clinically isolated bovine mastitis pathogens, including staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, bacillus cereus and escherichia coli by the broth microdilution method, as well as their activity on  s. aureus biofilm formation. attempts to clarify their mechanisms of action by investigation of the effects on intracellular material leakage and morphological  changes of s. aureus dmst 4745 were also made. the results demonstrate that s. agalactiae and b. cereus are more susceptible to lg, citral and geraniol than s.  aureus and e. coli. moreover, they also inhibit s. aureus biofilm formation and exhibit effective killing activities on preformed biofilms. the lg appears to have multiple targets in the bacterial cell, depending on concentration used as well as the amount of its components.

TI  == udder pathogens and their resistance to antimicrobial agents in dairy cows in estonia.
AB  == background: the goal of this study was to estimate the distribution of udder pathogens and their antibiotic resistance in estonia during the years 2007-2009.  methods: the bacteriological findings reported in this study originate from quarter milk samples collected from cows on estonian dairy farms that had clinical or subclinical mastitis. the samples were submitted by local veterinarians to the estonian veterinary and food laboratory during 2007-2009. milk samples were examined by conventional bacteriology. in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed with the disc diffusion test. logistic regression with a random herd effect to control for clustering was used for statistical analysis. results: during the study period, 3058 clinical mastitis samples from 190 farms and 5146 subclinical mastitis samples from 274 farms were  investigated. positive results were found in 57% of the samples (4680 out of 8204), and the proportion did not differ according to year (p > 0.05). the proportion of bacteriologically negative samples was 22.3% and that of mixed growth was 20.6%. streptococcus uberis (str. uberis) was the bacterium isolated most frequently (18.4%) from cases of clinical mastitis, followed by escherichia  coli (e. coli) (15.9%) and streptococcus agalactiae (str. agalactiae) (11.9%). the bacteria that caused subclinical mastitis were mainly staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus) (20%) and coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns) (15.4%). the probability of isolating s. aureus from milk samples was significantly higher on  farms that had fewer than 30 cows, when compared with farms that had more than 100 cows (p < 0.005). a significantly higher risk of str. agalactiae infection was found on farms with more than 600 cows (p = 0.034) compared with smaller farms. the proportion of s. aureus and cns isolates that were resistant to penicillin was 61.4% and 38.5%, respectively. among the e. coli isolates, ampicillin, streptomycin and tetracycline resistance were observed in 24.3%, 15.6% and 13.5%, respectively. conclusions: this study showed that the main pathogens associated with clinical mastitis were str. uberis and e. coli. subclinical mastitis was caused mainly by s. aureus and cns. the number of s. aureus and str. agalactiae isolates depended on herd size. antimicrobial resistance was highly prevalent, especially penicillin resistance in s. aureus and cns.

TI  == ozone in dentistry: microbiological effects of gas action depending on the method and the time of application using the ozonytron device. experimental study.
AB  == introduction: bactericidal, virucidal, and fungicidal activity of ozone is generally known and has been exploited for years in industry and medicine. ozone  therapy became an inherent element of the treatment of infection in such fields as surgery, dermatology, cosmetics, and dentistry. ozone is a gas, so it penetrates very well even into such tissues and spaces that are not easily accessible. thanks to the property of deep penetration and long ozone presence in tissues after treatment, a long-lasting bactericidal effect is achieved. the action of oxygen radicals is, however, not neutral for the human organism, therefore the use of an appropriate procedure and therapy algorithms is essential. material and methods: we decided to confirm the effect of antibacterial activity of ozone applied by means of the ozonytron device (made by biozonix) on model strains of streptococcus salivarius, pneumonia, pyogenes, and  agalactiae, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus and epidermidis, using two application patterns developed by us. results: we found a statistically significant difference in the size of zones of inhibited bacterial growth on all  media depending on the time of action of ozone. in the present paper, the bactericidal activity of ozone in relation to bacterial strains that are most frequently isolated from the oral cavity was confirmed. what is more, two models  of application of the gas on the infected medium were compared. conclusion: research on the use of ozone in combatting bacteria typical for dental diseases has shown that the gas has an oxidizing effect on these bacteria and is bactericidal.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of e-101 solution, a novel myeloperoxidase-mediated antimicrobial, against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens.
AB  == objectives: e-101 solution (e-101) is a novel myeloperoxidase-mediated antimicrobial. it is composed of porcine myeloperoxidase (pmpo), glucose oxidase, glucose as the substrate and specific amino acids in an aqueous vehicle. e-101 is being developed for topical application directly into surgical wounds to prevent  surgical site infections (ssis). the in vitro activity of e-101 was investigated. methods: mic, mbc, time-kill and antimicrobial combination experiments were performed according to clsi guidelines with modifications. resistance selection studies were performed using a serial passage method. results: e-101 showed mic(90) values of 0.03, 0.5 and 0.5 mg pmpo/l for staphylococci (n = 140), streptococci (n = 95) and enterococci (n = 55), respectively. mic(90) values ranged between 0.03-0.5 and </= 0.004-0.12 mg pmpo/l for enterobacteriaceae (n =  148) and gram-negative non-enterobacteriaceae (n = 92) strains, respectively. there was no antimicrobial tolerance to e-101 for staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae or streptococcus pyogenes. time-kill studies demonstrated a rapid (<30 min) bactericidal effect against s. aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa in a concentration-dependent and time-dependent manner. there was no evidence of stable resistance to e-101 among staphylococci, enterococci, e. coli or p. aeruginosa strains and no evidence of e-101 interaction with antibiotics commonly used in clinical medicine. conclusions e-101 shows potent and broad-spectrum in vitro activity against bacteria that are the causative pathogens of ssis, thereby providing the impetus to test its clinical utility in the prevention of ssis.

TI  == real-time pcr assays compared to culture-based approaches for identification of aerobic bacteria in chronic wounds.
AB  == chronic wounds cause substantial morbidity and disability. infection in chronic wounds is clinically defined by routine culture methods that can take several days to obtain a final result, and may not fully describe the community of organisms or biome within these wounds. molecular diagnostic approaches offer promise for a more rapid and complete assessment. we report the development of a  suite of real-time pcr assays for rapid identification of bacteria directly from  tissue samples. the panel of assays targets 14 common, clinically relevant, aerobic pathogens and demonstrates a high degree of sensitivity and specificity using a panel of organisms commonly associated with chronic wound infection. thirty-nine tissue samples from 29 chronic wounds were evaluated and the results  compared with those obtained by culture. as revealed by culture and pcr, the most common organisms were methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) followed by streptococcus agalactiae (group b streptococcus) and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the sensitivities of the pcr assays were 100% and 90% when quantitative and qualitative culture results were used as the reference standard, respectively. the assays allowed the identification of bacterial dna from ten additional organisms that were not revealed by quantitative or qualitative cultures. under optimal conditions, the turnaround time for pcr results is as short as 4-6 h. real-time pcr is a rapid and inexpensive approach that can be easily introduced into clinical practice for detection of organisms directly from tissue samples. characterization of the anaerobic microflora by real-time pcr of chronic wounds is warranted.

TI  == myeloperoxidase selectively binds and selectively kills microbes.
AB  == myeloperoxidase (mpo) is reported to selectively bind to bacteria. the present study provides direct evidence of mpo binding selectivity and tests the relationship of selective binding to selective killing. the microbicidal effectiveness of h(2)o(2) and of ocl(-) was compared to that of mpo plus h(2)o(2). synergistic microbicidal action was investigated by combining streptococcus sanguinis, a h(2)o(2)-producing microbe showing low mpo binding, with high-mpo-binding escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, or pseudomonas aeruginosa without exogenous h(2)o(2), with and without mpo, and with and without erythrocytes (red blood cells [rbcs]). selectivity of mpo microbicidal action was conventionally measured as the mpo mic and minimal bactericidal concentration (mbc) for 82 bacteria including e. coli, p. aeruginosa, s. aureus, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, and viridans streptococci. both h(2)o(2) and ocl(-) destroyed rbcs at submicrobicidal concentrations. nanomolar concentrations of mpo increased h(2)o(2) microbicidal action 1,000-fold. streptococci plus mpo produced potent synergistic microbicidal action against all microbes tested, and rbcs caused only a small decrease in potency without erythrocyte damage. mpo directly killed h(2)o(2)-producing s. pyogenes but was ineffective against non-h(2)o(2)-producing e. faecalis. the mpo  mics and mbcs for e. coli, p. aeruginosa, and s. aureus were significantly lower  than those for e. faecalis. the streptococcal studies showed much higher mic/mbc  results, but such testing required lysed horse blood-supplemented medium, thus preventing valid comparison of these results to those for the other microbes. e.  faecalis mpo binding is reportedly weak compared to binding of e. coli, p. aeruginosa, and s. aureus but strong compared to binding of streptococci. selective mpo binding results in selective killing.

TI  == kill rate of mastitis pathogens by a combination of cefalexin and kanamycin.
AB  == aim: to assess the bacterial killing rate produced by a combination of cefalexin  and kanamycin at two different concentration ratios. methods and results: time-kill kinetics of cefalexin and kanamycin, individually and in combination, were determined against one strain each of escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus dysgalactiae and streptococcus uberis. the combination was tested using two fixed ratios (cefalexin : kanamycin  ratios of 1.25 : 1 and 1 : 2.3) and two concentrations of each ratio. time-kill curves produced with either ratio were quite similar. against most bacterial species, higher concentrations produced faster kill. in all cases, the combination of cefalexin and kanamycin showed faster and greater kill at lower antibiotic concentrations than those observed with either drug alone. conclusions: the combination of cefalexin and kanamycin results in a fast initial killing of major mastitis pathogens at both concentration ratios. significance and impact of the study: the combination of cefalexin and kanamycin achieved rapid bacterial kill at concentrations and ratios that can be achieved in vivo following intramammary infusion of a mastitis treatment.

TI  == evaluation of calf milk pasteurization systems on 6 pennsylvania dairy farms.
AB  == waste milk has been fed to calves for many years, but concerns with bacterial contamination as well as possible transmission of diseases have discouraged widespread use of this feed. pasteurization of waste milk is one option to reduce management risk while utilizing a valuable, low-cost, liquid feed source for calves. however, many farms currently pasteurizing waste milk lack a system to adequately monitor the efficiency of the process. a study was carried out to evaluate 6 on-farm pasteurization systems, including high-temperature, short-time pasteurizers and low-temperature, batch pasteurizers. milk samples were taken pre- and postpasteurization as well as from the calf buckets and immediately frozen for later bacterial culture. samples were collected twice daily for 15 d.  milk samples were examined for standard plate count (spc), coagulase-negative staphylococci count, environmental streptococci count, coliform count, gram-negative noncoliform count, streptococcus agalactiae count, and staphylococcus aureus count. before pasteurization, 68% of the samples had spc <20,000 cfu/ml, and 39% of samples contained <100 cfu/ml of coliform bacteria. after pasteurization, 96% of samples had spc <20,000 cfu/ml, and 92% had coliform counts <100 cfu/ml. bacteria counts were significantly reduced by pasteurization, and pasteurized milk contained acceptable numbers of bacteria in >90% of samples. these results indicate that pasteurization can be very effective in lowering bacterial contamination of milk. however, bacteria numbers significantly increased after pasteurization and, in some cases, bacteria counts in milk fed to calves were similar to prepasteurization levels. milk handling after pasteurization was identified as an important issue on the farms studied.

TI  == management practices associated with the bulk-milk prevalence of staphylococcus aureus in canadian dairy farms.
AB  == when designing mastitis-prevention and control programs, it is important to know  the level of adoption of mastitis-prevention management practices and control programs and the herd-level prevalence of contagious mastitis pathogens. our objectives were to estimate: (1) adoption of recommended mastitis-preventive management on canadian dairy farms; (2) herd-level prevalence of contagious mastitis pathogens on canadian dairy farms; and (3) associations of certain management practices with the isolation of staphylococcus aureus from the bulk tank milk from canadian dairy farms. in total, 226 farms participating in dairy herd improvement milk recording were randomly selected. all participating farms in british columbia had free-stall barns and 85% of farms in quebec had tie-stall barns. post-milking teat disinfection was practised on 96% of the farms and 72% had implemented blanket dry-cow treatment. weighted and province-stratified prevalence of streptococcus agalactiae and staph. aureus in bulk tank milk was 4% (95% confidence interval: 0-12%) and 74% (95% confidence interval: 61-86%), respectively. highest staph. aureus prevalence was found in nova scotia (91%) and lowest prevalence in british columbia (38%). no mycoplasma spp. were isolated, but detection of mycoplasma spp. could have been hampered by the frozen shipment  and storage of the milk samples. management practices associated with a lower probability of isolating staph. aureus were blanket dry-cow treatment and believing that a nutritionist is important in mastitis data review. having the milking equipment checked by an independent technician at least once a year and rubber mats or mattresses in the free-stall barns were associated with an increased probability of isolating staph. aureus from the bulk tank. most of canadian dairy farms adopted important mastitis-prevention practices, such as post-milking teat disinfection and drying off all cows with antibiotics; however, improvements can still be made. a few management practices were associated with the prevalence of staph. aureus in bulk tank milk, such as dry-cow treatment and  barn type for the lactating cows. further work has to be carried out to investigate to what extent the associations are causal.

TI  == trends in methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus anovaginal colonization in  pregnant women in 2005 versus 2009.
AB  == in 2005, the prevalence of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) anovaginal colonization in pregnant women at our center (columbia university medical center) was 0.5%, and mrsa-colonized women were less likely to carry group b streptococcus (gbs). in this study, our objectives were to identify changing trends in the prevalence of mrsa and methicillin-susceptible s. aureus (mssa) anovaginal colonization in pregnant women, to assess the association between mrsa and gbs colonization, and to characterize the mrsa strains. from february to july 2009, lim broths from gbs surveillance samples were cultured for s. aureus. mrsa strains were identified by resistance to cefoxitin and characterized by microscan, staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (sccmec) typing, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge), spa typing, and panton-valentine leukocidin pcr. a total of 2,921 specimens from different patients were analyzed. the prevalences of mssa, mrsa, and gbs colonization were 11.8%, 0.6% and 23.3%, respectively. gbs colonization was associated with s. aureus colonization (odds ratio [or], 1.9; 95% confidence interval [95% ci], 1.5 to 2.4). the frequencies of gbs colonization were similar in mrsa-positive (34.2%) versus mrsa-negative patients (21.8%) (p = 0.4). all mrsa isolates from 2009 and 13/14 isolates from 2005 were sccmec type iv or v, consistent with community-associated mrsa; 12/18 (2009) and 0/14 (2005) isolates were the usa300 clone. levofloxacin resistance increased from 14.3% (2005) to 55.6% (2009) (p = 0.028). in conclusion, the prevalence of mrsa anovaginal colonization in pregnant women in new york city, ny, remained stable from 2005 to 2009, and usa300 emerged as the predominant clone with a significant increase in levofloxacin-resistant isolates.

TI  == biological activity of the essential oil of kadsura longipedunculata (schisandraceae) and its major components.
AB  == objectives: the aim was to determine the chemical composition of the essential oil of kadsura longipedunculata and the biological activity of the oil and its major components. methods: the essential oil from stem bark of kadsura longipedunculata was analysed by capillary gas chromatography (glc/fid) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (glc/ms). the ability of the oil to reduce diphenylpicrylhydrazine (dpph(*)) was used to evaluate the antioxidant activity.  inhibition of both lipoxygenase and prostaglandin e(2) was used to assess the anti-inflammatory activity. antimicrobial activity was studied in vitro against a range of bacteria and fungi using diffusion and microdilution methods. inhibition of trypanosome proliferation was assessed using resazurin as vital stain. the in-vitro cytotoxicity of the essential oil on six human cancer cell lines (hepg2, mia paca-2, hela, hl-60, mda-mb-231 and sw-480) was examined using the mtt assay. key findings: fifty compounds, representing 97.63% of total oil, were identified. delta-cadinene (21.79%), camphene (7.27%), borneol (6.05%), cubenol (5.12%) and delta-cadinol (5.11%) were found to be the major components of the oil. the oil exerted a good antimicrobial activity against all gram-positive bacteria tested,  including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis. streptococcus pyogenes and s. agalactiae were the most sensitive bacteria with a minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) of 60 microg/ml  oil. the essential oil showed a moderate fungicidal activity against yeasts, but  it did not show any activity against gram-negative bacteria. the essential oil showed a good trypanocidal activity in trypanosoma b. brucei with an ic50 value of 50.52 +/- 0.029 microg/ml. radical scavenging activity had an ic50 value of 3.06 +/- 0.79 mg/ml. 5-lipoxygenase inhibition (ic50 = 38.58 microg/ml) and prostaglandin e(2) production inhibition (28.82% at 25 microg/ml) accounted for anti-inflammatory activity of the oil. the oil exhibited some degree of cytotoxic activity against mia paca-2, hepg-2 and sw-480 cell lines with ic50 values of 133.53, 136.96 and 136.62 microg/ml, respectively. the oil increased caspase 3/7  activity (an indicator of apoptosis) 2.5-4 fold in mia paca-2 cells. camphene and borneol did not show antioxidant activity. however, both compounds exhibited some degree of antimicrobial, trypanocidal, anti-inflammatory and cytotoxic activity.  conclusions: this investigation provided evidence for, and confirmed the efficacy of, k. longipedunculata, a traditionally used chinese medicinal plant for the treatment of inflammation and infection.

TI  == linum usitatissimum (linseed/flaxseed) fixed oil: antimicrobial activity and efficacy in bovine mastitis.
AB  == purpose: in vitro antimicrobial activity and in vivo therapeutic efficacy of l. usitatissimum (linseed/flaxseed) fixed oil in bovine mastitis were investigated.  method: in vitro antimicrobial activity of l. usitatissimum fixed oil was evaluated against a number of microorganisms by disc diffusion method and mic determination. the in vivo efficacy of the oil was evaluated in nine mastitis-affected cows divided into three groups (three in each group), following once-a-day intramammary infusion of oil, cefoperazone or an oil-cefoperazone combination for 7 days and by monitoring the california mastitis test score, somatic cell count and microbial count in milk samples. results: the in vitro antimicrobial activity of the oil against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae and escherichia coli was comparable to that of cefoperazone while the  antimicrobial activity against enterococcus faecalis, micrococcus luteus and candida albicans, was greater than that of cefoperazone. in the in vivo study, the oil exhibited significant reduction in the california mastitis test score and somatic cell count in milk samples from infected udders following 7 days of intramammary administration suggesting its anti-inflammatory effect. the microbial count in milk samples was also reduced significantly following oil treatment. the effects were comparable to the treatment by cefoperazone (mastiwock) alone or in combination with the oil. apparently, the anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties of the oil contribute to its therapeutic efficacy in mastitis; the oil could be used as an alternative treatment for bovine mastitis conclusion: the results suggest possible therapeutic potential of l. usitatissimum fixed oil in bovine mastitis.

TI  == intramammary infections with the contagious staphylococcus aureus genotype b in swiss dairy cows are associated with low prevalence of coagulase-negative staphylococci and streptococcus spp.
AB  == the association between the contagious staphylococcus aureus genotype b (gtb) and the presence of coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns) and streptococcus spp. (non-agalactiae streptococci), was investigated, and the identification of problem herds without genotyping was evaluated. milk samples from 10 herds with staph. aureus gtb herd problems (ph cases) were compared with samples from 19 herds with at least one staph. aureus isolate of non-b genotype (ch cases). all samples were bacteriologically analysed and staph. aureus genotyping carried out  using a ribosomal spacer-pcr. cow and quarter prevalences of staph. aureus, cns and streptococcus spp. differed significantly between ph and ch groups. ph cases  were highly associated with decreased cow prevalences of cns and streptococcus spp. these altered prevalences also contributed significantly to the identification of problem herds without resorting to genotyping. common herd-level risk factors did not explain the difference between the prevalences in ph and ch cases.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibilities of coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns) and streptococci from bovine subclinical mastitis cases.
AB  == the prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibilities of staphylococci and streptococci were assessed from subclinical mastitis cases. one hundred coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns) and 34 streptococci were identified. the most frequently isolated species were staphylococcus haemolyticus (27%) and staphylococcus simulans (24%). susceptible cns species revealed the highest resistance to penicillin g (58%), ampicillin (48%), neomycin (20%), and oleandomycin (14%). cns methicillin resistance rates within 82 isolates were 21.95% and 1.22% by disk diffusion and pcr methods, respectively. these results suggested the disk diffusion method was more prone to yield false positives. partial sequencing of the 16s rrna region from the meca carrying isolate (s. haemolyticus) was homologous with s. haemolyticus sequences/accessions obtained from genbank. however, the meca gene sequence from this isolate was more closely  allied with the s. aureus meca gene of human origins. identical sequence data was acquired from the national center for biotechnology information (ncbi) database,  suggesting horizontal gene transfer between the two species. cns beta-lactamase activity within 81 isolates was 29.63%. the most frequently isolated streptococcus species were s. uberis (52%) and s. agalactiae (15%). oleandomycin  was the least effective antimicrobial agent on these isolates with 59% susceptibility. results indicated that cns and streptococci exhibited various antimicrobial resistance responses. consequently, isolation and identification of udder pathogens in herds suffering from subclinical agents is essential to select the most effective antimicrobial agent. moreover, multiple resistance features of methicillin resistant (mr) isolates should be considered during antimicrobial susceptibility tests.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of ceftobiprole against gram-positive cocci.
AB  == the activity of ceftobiprole and comparator agents was evaluated against a collection of 880 isolates, comprising 200 meticillin-susceptible staphylococcus  aureus, 200 meticillin-resistant s. aureus, 180 coagulase-negative staphylococci  blood isolates, 100 streptococcuspneumoniae and 200 macrolide-resistant beta-haemolytic streptococci (100 streptococcus pyogenes and 100 streptococcus agalactiae). ceftobiprole showed excellent activity against staphylococci (minimum inhibitory concentrations <or=4 microg/ml), irrespective of their susceptibility to other agents such as oxacillin, linezolid or glycopeptides. ceftobiprole was also highly active against penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae and macrolide-resistant beta-haemolytic streptococci, inhibiting 99.6% of all streptococci tested at <or=0.5 microg/ml. based on these results, ceftobiprole appears to be a promising agent for the treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant gram-positive pathogens.

TI  == bacterial meningitis in cirrhotic patients: case series and description of the prognostic role of acute renal failure.
AB  == aim: to analyze the mortality risk factors in cirrhotic patients with bacterial meningitis (bm). background: cirrhotic patients are susceptible to infections. despite its high mortality rate, bm has not been extensively studied in this group of patients. study: bm patients diagnosed with cirrhosis, between 1987 and  2008, were studied. bm was defined as the presence of signs or symptoms of meningitis and a cerebrospinal fluid (csf) leukocyte count >100/mm3 or the presence of bacteria in csf. results: we identified 4955 infections among 7591 cirrhotic patients; 12 (0.2%) had bm. the mean age at diagnosis was 60+/-16 years. abnormal mental status (83%), fever (67%), and neck stiffness (67%) were the most frequent clinical presentations. the sensitivity of csf culture was 75%  (streptococcus pneumoniae, 2; staphylococcus aureus, 2; listeria monocytogenes, 1; group b streptococcus, 1; streptococcus agalactiae, 1; streptococcus bovis, 1; and escherichia coli, 1), and its correlation with blood culture was 78%. five patients died. on admission, the serum creatinine level was 1.63+/-0.93 mg/dl. a  serum creatinine level >/=1.3 mg/dl was associated with increased mortality (p=0.028). the model for end-stage liver disease score, gastrointestinal bleeding, bilirubin level >3.5 mg/dl, hepatic encephalopathy, diabetes mellitus,  and results of cytology and biochemistry tests of csf were not associated with mortality. conclusions: bm in cirrhotic patients is associated with a high mortality rate. the clinical and microbiologic features of bm in cirrhotic patients differ from those in the general population. a serum creatinine level >/=1.3 mg/dl on admission is associated with a higher risk of mortality.

TI  == skizzle is a novel plasminogen- and plasmin-binding protein from streptococcus agalactiae that targets proteins of human fibrinolysis to promote plasmin generation.
AB  == skizzle (skzl), secreted by streptococcus agalactiae, has moderate sequence identity to streptokinase and staphylokinase, bacterial activators of human plasminogen (pg). skzl binds [glu]pg with low affinity (k(d) 3-16 mum) and [lys]pg and plasmin (pm) with indistinguishable high affinity (k(d) 80 and 50 nm, respectively). binding of skzl to pg and pm is completely lysine-binding site-dependent, as shown by the effect of the lysine analog, 6-aminohexanoic acid. deletion of the cooh-terminal skzl lys(415) residue reduces affinity for [lys]pg and active site-blocked pm 30-fold, implicating lys(415) in a lysine-binding site interaction with a pg/pm kringle. skzl binding to active site fluorescein-labeled pg/pm analogs demonstrates distinct high and low affinity interactions. high affinity binding is mediated by lys(415), whereas the source of low affinity binding is unknown. skzl enhances the activation of [glu]pg by urokinase (upa) approximately 20-fold, to a maximum rate indistinguishable from that for [lys]pg and [glu]pg activation in the presence of 6-aminohexanoic acid.  skzl binds preferentially to the partially extended beta-conformation of [glu]pg, which is in unfavorable equilibrium with the compact alpha-conformation, thereby  converting [glu]pg to the fully extended gamma-conformation and accelerating the  rate of its activation by upa. skzl enhances [lys]pg and [glu]pg activation by single-chain tissue-type pg activator, approximately 42- and approximately 650-fold, respectively. skzl increases the rate of plasma clot lysis by upa and single-chain tissue-type pg activator approximately 2-fold, confirming its cofactor activity in a physiological model system. the results suggest a role for skzl in s. agalactiae pathogenesis through fibrinolytic enhancement.

TI  == microbial colonization of tracheoesophageal voice prostheses (provox2) following  total laryngectomy.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to determine the presence of individual microorganisms and the most frequent microbial combinations in the biofilm of the indwelling provox2 voice prosthesis in situ. furthermore, we wanted to evaluate the possible influence of biofilm composition on the mean and median lifetime of  these voice prostheses. over a 5-year period, implantation of a provox2 voice prosthesis was performed in 85 patients, or 90% of the overall number of patients who underwent total laryngectomy. in total 100 implanted voice prostheses, at least one of every patient, were microbiologically processed immediately after being replaced. out of the total of 292 isolates, 67% were bacteria and the remaining 33% were yeasts. the most frequently found yeast species on voice prostheses biofilms was c. albicans, followed by c. krusei and c. tropicalis. the most frequently isolated bacteria included staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, and streptococcus agalactiae. simultaneous presence of bacteria and fungi was established in 83% of the processed voice prostheses; in 16% of samples the biofilm contained only one or more bacterial species. the mean time of implantation was 238 days and the median lifetime of the device was 180 days. dividing the prostheses in four groups according to the composition of biofilm revealed that the device lifetimes varied significantly between groups. the longest lifetime of voice prostheses was associated with the presence of single fungal isolate in combination with bacteria. there is a significant correlation between biofilm composition and the  device life time.

TI  == antimicrobial and antiadhesive properties of a biosurfactant isolated from lactobacillus paracasei ssp. paracasei a20.
AB  == aims: the aim of this study was to determine the antimicrobial and antiadhesive properties of a biosurfactant isolated from lactobacillus paracasei ssp. paracasei a20 against several micro-organisms, including gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, yeasts and filamentous fungi. methods and results: antimicrobial and antiadhesive activities were determined using the microdilution method in 96-well culture plates. the biosurfactant showed antimicrobial activity against all the micro-organisms assayed, and for twelve of the eighteen micro-organisms (including the pathogenic candida albicans, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and streptococcus agalactiae),  the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and the minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) were achieved for biosurfactant concentrations between 25 and 50 mg ml(-1). furthermore, the biosurfactant showed antiadhesive activity against most of the micro-organisms evaluated. conclusions: as far as we know, this is the first compilation of data on antimicrobial and antiadhesive activities of biosurfactants obtained from lactobacilli against such a broad group of micro-organisms. although the antiadhesive activity of biosurfactants isolated from lactic acid bacteria has been widely reported, their antimicrobial activity  is quite unusual and has been described only in a few strains. significance and impact of the study: the results obtained in this study regarding the antimicrobial and antiadhesive properties of this biosurfactant opens future prospects for its use against micro-organisms responsible for diseases and infections in the urinary, vaginal and gastrointestinal tracts, as well as in the skin, making it a suitable alternative to conventional antibiotics.

TI  == effect of heat treatment of bovine colostrum on bacterial counts, viscosity, and  immunoglobulin g concentration.
AB  == a study was conducted to identify the optimal temperature and time at which heat  treatment of bovine colostrum would least change viscosity and igg concentrations yet reduce bacterial count. first-milking colostrum with >50g of immunoglobulins/l (measured by colostrometer) was collected from 30 holstein cows. aliquots of colostrum were heated for 0, 30, 60, or 90min at 57, 60, or 63  degrees c in a water bath. samples were examined for viscosity, igg(1), and igg(2) concentrations, standard plate count, coagulase-negative staphylococci, environmental streptococci, coliform, gram-negative noncoliform, streptococcus agalactiae, and staphylococcus aureus counts. all heat treatments reduced counts  of all bacteria groups measured compared with untreated colostrum samples. heat treatment at >or=60 degrees c denatured igg(1) compared with untreated colostrum; however, colostral igg(2) levels were not reduced when temperature was held at 60 degrees c for <60min. viscosity was not affected when temperature was held at 60  degrees c for <60min. in this study, heat treatment of bovine colostrum at 60 degrees c for 30 or 60min reduced bacterial count, slightly reduced igg concentration, and did not affect viscosity.

TI  == prognostic factors in left-sided endocarditis: results from the andalusian multicenter cohort.
AB  == background: despite medical advances, mortality in infective endocarditis (ie) is still very high. previous studies on prognosis in ie have observed conflicting results. the aim of this study was to identify predictors of in-hospital mortality in a large multicenter cohort of left-sided ie. methods: an observational multicenter study was conducted from january 1984 to december 2006  in seven hospitals in andalusia, spain. seven hundred and five left-side ie patients were included. the main outcome measure was in-hospital mortality. several prognostic factors were analysed by univariate tests and then by multilogistic regression model. results: the overall mortality was 29.5% (25.5% from 1984 to 1995 and 31.9% from 1996 to 2006; odds ratio 1.25; 95% confidence interval: 0.97-1.60; p = 0.07). in univariate analysis, age, comorbidity, especially chronic liver disease, prosthetic valve, virulent microorganism such as staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae and fungi, and complications (septic shock, severe heart failure, renal insufficiency, neurologic manifestations and perivalvular extension) were related with higher mortality. independent factors for mortality in multivariate analysis were: charlson comorbidity score (or: 1.2; 95% ci: 1.1-1.3), prosthetic endocarditis (or: 1.9; ci: 1.2-3.1), staphylococcus aureus aetiology (or: 2.1; ci: 1.3-3.5), severe heart failure (or: 5.4; ci: 3.3-8.8), neurologic manifestations (or: 1.9; ci: 1.2-2.9), septic shock (or: 4.2; ci: 2.3-7.7), perivalvular extension (or: 2.4; ci: 1.3-4.5) and acute renal failure (or: 1.69; ci: 1.0-2.6). conversely, streptococcus viridans group etiology (or: 0.4; ci: 0.2-0.7) and surgical treatment (or: 0.5; ci: 0.3-0.8) were protective factors. conclusions: several characteristics of left-sided endocarditis enable selection of a patient group at higher risk of mortality. this group may benefit from more specialised attention  in referral centers and should help to identify those patients who might benefit  from more aggressive diagnostic and/or therapeutic procedures.

TI  == mode of action and in vitro susceptibility of mastitis pathogens to macedocin st91km and preparation of a teat seal containing the bacteriocin.
AB  == mastitis is considered to be the most economically costly disease affecting the dairy industry. regular dosage of animals with antibiotics, including use of prophylactic concentrations, may select for resistant strains. the purpose of this study was to determine the mode of action of a new bacteriocin (macedocin st91km), to evaluate the antimicrobial resistance of mastitis pathogens to antibiotics commonly used in treatment remedies, and to introduce the possible use of an alternative antimicrobial agent. the bacteriocin macedocin st91km, produced by streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. macedonicus st91km, is bactericidal to streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus dysgalactiae, streptococcus uberis and staphylococcus aureus associated with mastitis infections, including strains resistant to methicillin and oxacillin. sensitive cells were deformed and secreted nucleotides, k(+) and beta-galactosidase when exposed to macedocin st91km. adsorption of the peptide to target cells decreased in the presence of solvents, suggesting that receptors on the cell surfaces have lipid moieties. no  adsorption was recorded in the presence of mgcl2, ki and na2co3, suggesting that  ionic strength plays an important role. a teat seal preparation containing macedocin st91km effectively released the peptide and inhibited the growth of s.  agalactiae. macedocin st91km could form the basis for alternative dry cow therapy to prevent mastitis infections in dairy cows as it is effective against pathogens that display resistance to conventional antibiotic therapy.

TI  == invited review: the role of contagious disease in udder health.
AB  == contagious diseases are a threat to animal health and productivity, both nationally and at the farm level. this makes implementation of biosecurity measures to prevent their introduction and spread within countries and farms a necessity. mastitis is the most common and costly contagious disease affecting dairy farms in the western world. the major mastitis pathogens are endemic in most countries, and biosecurity measures to prevent introduction and transmission must therefore be implemented at farm level. the 40-yr-old mastitis control plan  remains a solid foundation to prevent the spread of contagious intramammary infections. contagious diseases that do not affect the mammary gland directly may have an indirect effect on mastitis. this is true for list a diseases such as foot and mouth disease, for which biosecurity measures may need to be taken at national level, and for other infections with nonmastitis pathogens such as bovine viral diarrhea virus and mycobacterium avium ssp. paratuberculosis. maintaining a closed herd decreases the risk of introduction of pathogens that affect udder health directly or indirectly. if animals are purchased, their udder health history should be evaluated and they should be examined and tested for contagious diseases. transmission of infections by and to humans and nonbovine animals may occur. contact with visitors and nonbovine animals should therefore be minimized. because of globalization and heightened consumer awareness, the importance of biosecurity now supersedes individual farms, and increased pressure to control transmission of contagious diseases can be expected at industry or government levels in western countries and elsewhere.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity profile of oritavancin against recent gram-positive clinical isolates.
AB  == oritavancin activity was tested against 15,764 gram-positive isolates collected from 246 hospital centers in 25 countries between 2005 and 2008. organisms were staphylococcus aureus (n = 9,075), coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 1,664),  enterococcus faecalis (n = 1,738), enterococcus faecium (n = 819), streptococcus  pyogenes (n = 959), streptococcus agalactiae (n = 415), group c, g, and f streptococci (n = 84), and streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 1,010). among the evaluated staphylococci, 56.7% were resistant to oxacillin. the vancomycin resistance rate among enterococci was 21.2%. penicillin-resistant and -intermediate rates were 14.7% and 21.4%, respectively, among s. pneumoniae isolates. among nonpneumococcal streptococci, 18.5% were nonsusceptible to erythromycin. oritavancin showed substantial in vitro activity against all organisms tested, regardless of resistance profile. the maximum oritavancin mic against all staphylococci tested (n = 10,739) was 4 microg/ml; the mic(90) against s. aureus was 0.12 microg/ml. against e. faecalis and e. faecium, oritavancin mic(90)s were 0.06 and 0.12, respectively. oritavancin was active against glycopeptide-resistant enterococci, including vana strains (n = 486), with mic(90)s of 0.25 and 1 microg/ml against vana e. faecium and e. faecalis, respectively. oritavancin showed potent activity against streptococci (n = 2,468); mic(90)s for the different streptococcal species were between 0.008 and 1 microg/ml. these data are consistent with previous studies with respect to resistance rates of gram-positive isolates and demonstrate the spectrum and in vitro activity of oritavancin against a wide variety of contemporary gram-positive pathogens, regardless of resistance to currently used drugs. the data provide a foundation for interpreting oritavancin activity and potential changes in susceptibility over time once oritavancin enters into clinical use.

AB  == the aim of this study was to retrospectively analyse the results of milk samples  obtained from south african dairy herds during the period 1996 to april 2007 in order to identify possible trends in isolates of microorganisms and their pathogenicity under field conditions. milk samples were obtained from 7 of the 9  provinces in south africa where there are low numbers of dairy cows. although there is scientific limitation to a country wide survey, such as the variation in herd size, management skills, parity, milk yield, milking frequency and other parameters, the size of this database helps to give a fair indication of general  udder health in south africa. cytology and routine bacteriology were performed on 379,000 milk samples of lactating cows and bacteriology on 11,946 samples from non-lactating cows. according to the results obtained, mastitis did not decrease  in south africa over the test period. the prevalence of mastitis and teat canal infection was lowest in 2002. mastitis and teat canal infection increased from 2002 to 2006 from 8.1% and 24.1% to 15.4 and 30.0% respectively. the percentage of mastitogenic pathogens isolated from cows over these years also varied. previously unknown or almost eradicated mastitogenic pathogens such as alphabeta  haemolytic staphylococcus aureus which is thought to be of human origin, streptococcus agalactiae and enterococcus canis were responsible for numerous mastitis outbreaks seen in the test samples. coagulase-negative staphylococci were the most frequently isolated bacteria in milk samples from both lactating and dry cows, followed by staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus agalactiae. although staphylococcus aureus remained the principal mastitogenic pathogen in south africa, owing to its chronic nature and resultant economic losses, most cases of mastitis were caused by coagulase-negative staphylococci. this finding increases the importance of coagulase-negative staphylococci (formerly described  as a minor pathogen) significantly. isolations of streptococcus agalactiae peaked between 2000 and 2005 and decreased again by 2007. coagulase-negative staphylococcal isolates increased from 2002 and were still on the increase in 2007. streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus uberis and enterococcus canis were  isolated more frequently from milk samples of lactating cows compared with dry cows, while enterococcus faecalis was isolated more frequently from dry cow samples.

TI  == synthesis, spectroscopic characterization and antibacterial activity of new cobalt(ii) complexes of unsymmetrical tetradentate (osn2) schiff base ligands.
AB  == cobalt ion complexes with the schiff bases, (4-x-2-{[2-(2-pyridine-2-yl-ethylsulfanyl)ethylimino]methyl}phenol (x=methoxy (ome), phenylazo (n(2)ph), bromo (br), nitro (no(2))),were synthesized and investigated by several techniques using elemental analysis (c, h, n), ftir, electronic spectra and molar conductivity. the thermal stability of free ligands  and related cobalt complexes were studied by using differential scanning calorimetry (dsc) and thermogravimetric analyses (tga). cyclic voltammetry indicates that the investigated cobalt complexes, under the experimental conditions, have irreversible redox behavior. the synthesized compounds have antibacterial activity against the four gram-positive bacteria: streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, staphylococcus aureus and bacillus anthracis  and also against the two gram-negative bacteria: klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the activity data show that the parent schiff bases are more potent antibacterials than the cobalt complexes.

TI  == pharmacokinetics and efficacy of teicoplanin against intramammary infections in sheep.
AB  == the pharmacokinetics of teicoplanin were evaluated in 10 healthy sheep. after intravenous injection it showed monophasic behaviour, with a short mean (sd) elimination half-life (5 [0.24] hours). after intramuscular injection its bioavailability was 100 per cent but it was absorbed slowly; its elimination half-life was satisfactorily slow (9.23 [0.74] hours). its efficacy was evaluated in 26 crossbreed sheep with milk positive to strains of staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci and streptococcus agalactiae, and clinical signs of disease. in 19 of them a single intramuscular dose of 6 mg/kg bodyweight resulted in a complete resolution of the clinical signs, and no microorganisms were detected in milk by the fifth day; in the other seven sheep, with more severe intramammary infections, three consecutive daily intramuscular doses of 6  mg/kg bodyweight were necessary. there were no local or systemic side effects and no relapses during 30 days after the treatments in any of the sheep.

TI  == acute phase proteins in the diagnosis of bovine subclinical mastitis.
AB  == background: the california mastitis test (cmt) and somatic cell count (scc) are commonly used for diagnosis of subclinical mastitis in cattle. acute phase proteins (apps), as alternative biomarkers of mastitis, may increase in concentration in the absence of macroscopic changes in the milk, or may precede the onset of clinical signs. objective: the aim of this study was to compare the  accuracy of apps measured in milk and in serum with bacterial culture for the diagnosis of bovine subclinical mastitis. methods: one hundred and seventy-five holstein cows were randomly selected from 7 dairy farms. quarter milk and serum samples were taken from all cows. milk samples were analyzed using a cmt and scc, and for haptoglobin (mhp) and amyloid a (maa) concentrations, and were also submitted for bacterial culture. serum samples obtained concurrently were analyzed for haptoglobin (shp) and amyloid a (saa). two-sample wilcoxon (mann-whitney) test was used to compare scc, maa, mhp, saa, and shp concentrations between culture-positive and culture-negative animals. receiver-operating characteristic analysis was used to assess the performance of  each test using bacterial culture as the reference method. results: maa concentration was the most accurate of the 5 tests, with a sensitivity of 90.6% and specificity of 98.3% at concentrations >16.4 mg/l. maa and mhp had significantly larger areas under the curve than the respective serum proteins, saa and shp. conclusions: the results suggest that measuring haptoglobin and amyloid a in milk is more accurate than serum analysis for the diagnosis of subclinical mastitis in holstein cows.

TI  == pathogen detection in milk samples by ligation detection reaction-mediated universal array method.
AB  == this paper describes a new dna chip, based on the use of a ligation detection reaction coupled to a universal array, developed to detect and analyze, directly  from milk samples, microbial pathogens known to cause bovine, ovine, and caprine  mastitis or to be responsible for foodborne intoxication or infection, or both. probes were designed for the identification of 15 different bacterial groups: staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, nonaureus staphylococci, streptococcus bovis, streptococcus equi, streptococcus canis, streptococcus dysgalactiae, streptococcus parauberis, streptococcus uberis, streptococcus pyogenes, mycoplasma spp., salmonella spp., bacillus spp., campylobacter spp., and escherichia coli and related species. these groups were identified based on the 16s rrna gene. for microarray validation, 22 strains from the american type culture collection or other culture collections and 50 milk samples were tested.  the results demonstrated high specificity, with sensitivity as low as 6 fmol. moreover, the ligation detection reaction-universal array assay allowed for the identification of mycoplasma spp. in a few hours, avoiding the long incubation times of traditional microbiological identification methods. the universal array  described here is a versatile tool able to identify milk pathogens efficiently and rapidly.

TI  == osteopontin enhances phagocytosis through a novel osteopontin receptor, the alphaxbeta2 integrin.
AB  == osteopontin (opn) is a cytokine with multiple functions, including immune defense mechanisms against invading microorganisms. opn-deficient mice are impaired in clearing intracellular pathogens, suggesting an important role of opn during phagocytosis, but it remains to be defined how opn may enhance this innate immune process. here, we demonstrate that opn binds to monocytes, but not resting t cells, nk cells, or b cells, and mediates chemoattraction of il-1-activated human monocytes. moreover, opn binds in a specific manner to all known serotypes of the two bacterial species streptococcus agalactiae and staphylococcus aureus and opsonizes these bacteria for phagocytosis. we identify the integrin alpha(x)beta(2) (cd11c/cd18), which is highly expressed on the cell surface of monocytes, as a novel opn receptor. to eliminate the contribution from other molecular interactions between the bacteria and the phagocyte, we show that opn-coated synthetic beads are phagocytosed in an alpha(x)beta(2) integrin-dependent manner. the ligand recognition does not involve the rgd motif  previously reported to support binding of opn to integrins. taken together, these data identify the alpha(x)beta(2) integrin as a novel opn receptor that is required for opn-mediated phagocytosis, thereby elucidating an important mechanism of an innate immune function of opn.

TI  == the impact of the stone age diet on gingival conditions in the absence of oral hygiene.
AB  == background: the objective of this study was to assess the oral microbiota and clinical data in subjects without access to traditional oral hygiene methods and  who ate a diet available in the stone age. methods: ten subjects living in an environment replicating the stone age for 4 weeks were enrolled in this study. bleeding on probing (bop), gingival and plaque indices, and probing depth (pd) were assessed at baseline and at 4 weeks. microbiologic samples were collected at the mesio-buccal subgingival aspects of all teeth and from the dorsum of the tongue and were processed by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization methods. results: no subject had periodontitis. mean bop decreased from 34.8% to 12.6% (p <0.001).  mean gingival index scores changed from 0.38 to 0.43 (not statistically significant) and mean plaque scores increased from 0.68 to 1.47 (p <0.001). pd at sites of subgingival sampling decreased (mean difference: 0.2 mm; p <0.001). at week 4, the total bacterial count was higher (p <0.001) for 24 of 74 species, including bacteroides ureolyticus, eikenella corrodens, lactobacillus acidophilus, capnocytophaga ochracea, escherichia coli, fusobacterium nucleatum naviforme, haemophilus influenzae, helicobacter pylori, porphyromonas endodontalis, staphylococcus aureus (two strains), streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus anginosis, and streptococcus mitis. bacterial counts from tongue samples were higher at baseline (p <0.001) for 20 species, including tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans; serotype a), and streptococcus  spp. conclusions: the experimental gingivitis protocol is not applicable if the diet (e.g., stone age) does not include refined sugars. although plaque levels increased, bop and pd decreased. subgingival bacterial counts increased for several species not linked to periodontitis, whereas tongue bacterial samples decreased during the study period.

TI  == rapid detection of eight causative pathogens for the diagnosis of bacterial meningitis by real-time pcr.
AB  == we aimed to detect causative pathogens in cerebrospinal fluid (csf) collected from patients diagnosed with bacterial meningitis by real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr). in addition to streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae,  and mycoplasma pneumoniae described previously, five other pathogens, neisseria meningitidis, escherichia coli, streptococcus agalactiae, staphylococcus aureus,  and listeria monocytogenes, were targeted, based on a large-scale surveillance in japan. results in csf from neonates and children (n=150), and from adults (n=18)  analyzed by real-time pcr with molecular beacon probes were compared with those of conventional culturing. the total time from dna extraction from csf to pcr analysis was 1.5 h. the limit of detection for these pathogens ranged from 5 copies to 28 copies per tube. nonspecific positive reactions were not recognized  for 37 microorganisms in clinical isolates as a negative control. the pathogens were detected in 72.0% of the samples by real-time pcr, but in only 48.2% by culture, although the microorganisms were completely concordant. with the real-time pcr, the detection rate of h. influenzae from csf was high, at 45.2%, followed by s. pneumoniae (21.4%), s. agalactiae (2.4%), e. coli (1.8%), l. monocytogenes (0.6%), and m. pneumoniae (0.6%). the detection rate with pcr was significantly better than that with cultures in patients with antibiotic administration (chi2=18.3182; p=0.0000). in conclusion, detection with real-time  pcr is useful for rapidly identifying the causative pathogens of meningitis and for examining the clinical course of chemotherapy.

TI  == antibacterial effect of plant-derived antimicrobials on major bacterial mastitis  pathogens in vitro.
AB  == the objective of this study was to investigate the antimicrobial effect of plant-derived antimicrobials including trans-cinnamaldehyde (tc), eugenol, carvacrol, and thymol on major bacterial mastitis pathogens in milk. the minimum  inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) of the aforementioned compounds on streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus dysgalactiae, streptococcus uberis, staphylococcus aureus, and escherichia coli were determined. in addition, the bactericidal kinetics of tc on the aforementioned pathogens and the persistence of the antimicrobial activity of tc  in milk over a period of 2 wk were investigated. all 4 plant-derived molecules exhibited antimicrobial activity against the 5 mastitis pathogens tested, but tc  was most effective in killing the bacteria. the mic and mbc of tc on staph. aureus, e. coli, and strep. uberis were 0.1 and 0.45%, respectively, whereas that on strep. agalactiae and strep. dysgalactiae were 0.05 and 0.4%, respectively. the mic and mbc of the other 3 molecules ranged from 0.4 to 0.8% and 0.8 to 1.5%, respectively. in time-kill assays, tc at the mbc reduced the bacterial pathogens  in milk by 4.0 to 5.0 log(10) cfu/ml and to undetectable levels within 12 and 24  h, respectively. the antimicrobial effect of tc persisted for the duration of the experiment (14 d) without any loss of activity. results of this study suggest that tc has the potential to be evaluated as an alternative or adjunct to antibiotics as intramammary infusion to treat bovine mastitis.

TI  == changing trends in mastitis.
AB  == the global dairy industry, the predominant pathogens causing mastitis, our understanding of mastitis pathogens and the host response to intramammary infection are changing rapidly. this paper aims to discuss changes in each of these aspects. globalisation, energy demands, human population growth and climate change all affect the dairy industry. in many western countries, control programs for contagious mastitis have been in place for decades, resulting in a decrease in occurrence of streptococcus agalactiae and staphylococcus aureus mastitis and  an increase in the relative impact of streptococcus uberis and escherichia coli mastitis. in some countries, klebsiella spp. or streptococcus dysgalactiae are appearing as important causes of mastitis. differences between countries in legislation, veterinary and laboratory services and farmers' management practices affect the distribution and impact of mastitis pathogens. for pathogens that have traditionally been categorised as contagious, strain adaptation to human and bovine hosts has been recognised. for pathogens that are often categorised as environmental, strains causing transient and chronic infections are distinguished. the genetic basis underlying host adaptation and mechanisms of infection is being unravelled. genomic information on pathogens and their hosts and improved knowledge of the host's innate and acquired immune responses to intramammary infections provide opportunities to expand our understanding of bovine mastitis. these developments will undoubtedly contribute to novel approaches to mastitis diagnostics and control.

TI  == [comparative in vitro activity of daptomycin against gram-positive microorganisms: sentry surveillance program, spain (2002-2006)].
AB  == introduction and objective: daptomycin is a bactericidal lipopeptide antibiotic,  active against gram-positive bacteria. in this study, the comparative in vitro activity of daptomycin and other antimicrobial agents against isolates recovered  in 3 spanish hospitals from 2002 to 2006 was determined as part of the international sentry antimicrobial resistance surveillance program. the possible  therapeutic role of daptomycin is addressed in the light of spanish susceptibility data. methods: antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed  by the microdilution method with 1398 consecutively recovered gram-positive isolates. results: all the staphylococci (n = 1024), enterococci (n = 228), and streptococci (n = 146) studied were susceptible to daptomycin. the highest mic values were 1, 4, and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively, regardless of methicillin, vancomycin, or penicillin resistance status. all staphylococcus aureus isolates were also susceptible to vancomycin, teicoplanin, linezolid, and quinupristin-dalfopristin. coagulase-negative staphylococci were susceptible to vancomycin, linezolid, and quinupristin-dalfopristin. only daptomycin and linezolid were active against all enterococcal isolates. in addition, vancomycin, teicoplanin, and ampicillin were fully active against enterococcus faecalis. daptomycin, vancomycin, teicoplanin, linezolid, and quinupristin-dalfopristin were active against all streptococcus pyogenes, s. agalactiae, and s. viridans group isolates. the distribution of daptomycin mic values in s. aureus and enterococci was homogeneously sustained along the 5-year study period. conclusion: the sustained antimicrobial activity of daptomycin against staphylococci, enterococci, and streptococci in spain makes this antibiotic an excellent therapeutic option in severe infection caused by gram-positive microorganisms, including those with multiresistance.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of udder pathogens from cases of acute clinical mastitis in dairy cows.
AB  == to investigate occurrence of acquired antimicrobial resistance in udder pathogens mics in staphylococcus aureus (n=211), coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns) (n=56), streptococcus uberis (n=113), streptococcus dysgalactiae (n=152), streptococcus agalactiae (n=6), escherichia coli (n=163), and klebsiella spp. (n=42) were determined using microdilution. isolates were from a nation wide survey employing strict inclusion criteria. presence of acquired resistance was evaluated by species-specific epidemiological cut-off values issued by eucast. penicillin or methicillin resistance in staphylococci were however evaluated by beta-lactamase production or presence of the meca gene, respectively. staphylococci were mostly susceptible to antimicrobials tested but 7.1% of s. aureus and 12.5% of cns were resistant to penicillin by beta-lactamase production. methicillin resistance was not found in s. aureus. all streptococcus  dysgalactiae and s. agalactiae were susceptible to penicillin. bimodal mic distributions for tetracycline in s dysgalactiae and s. uberis indicate acquired  resistance in some isolates. among e. coli 12.3% of isolates were resistant to one or more antimicrobials. resistance to streptomycin (11.0%), sulphametoxazole  (8.6%), ampicillin (7.4%), or tetracycline (4.9%) were the most common traits. klebsiella spp. were resistant to ampicillin and some isolates also to tetracycline (7.1%) or sulphonamide (9.5%). the study shows that in sweden bacteria associated with acute clinical mastitis for the most part are susceptible to antimicrobials used in therapy but resistance to penicillin in s.  aureus is not uncommon. penicillin is recommended for treatment of mastitis caused by gram-positive pathogens and regular monitoring of beta-lactamase production in s. aureus is therefore recommended in herds with udder health problems.

TI  == a survey of bacteriological quality and the occurrence of salmonella in raw bovine colostrum.
AB  == in recent years, bovine colostrum has gained popularity as a human food because it is an excellent source of bioactive proteins, which have been claimed to inhibit viral and bacterial pathogens, improve gastrointestinal health, and enhance body condition. a study was conducted to determine bacteriological quality and occurrence of salmonella in colostrum collected from dairy herds (n = 55) in pennsylvania. colostrum samples were analyzed for standard plate count, preliminary incubation count, laboratory pasteurization count, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, coagulase negative staphylococci, streptococci, coliforms, and non-coliforms. a standardized polymerase chain reaction assay was  used for detection of salmonella in colostrum. salmonella were detected in 8 of 55 (15%) of colostrum samples. streptococcus agalactiae (1000 colony-forming units [cfu]/ml) was detected in one colostrum sample. the mean standard plate count (977,539 cfu/ml), preliminary incubation count (12,094,755 cfu/ml), laboratory pasteurization count (615 cfu/ml), staphylococcus aureus (306 cfu/ml), coagulase negative staphylococci (164,963 cfu/ml), streptococci (256,722 cfu/ml), coliforms (323,372 cfu/ml), and non-coliforms (111,544 cfu/ml) counts in colostrum were considerably higher than raw bulk tank milk counts reported previously from pennsylvania. analysis revealed that farm size did not influence  the bacteriological quality of colostrum. collection, handling, and storage of colostrum need to be addressed to improve bacteriological quality of colostrum intended not only for feeding calves but also for human consumption.

TI  == udder shape and teat-end lesions as potential risk factors for high somatic cell  counts and intra-mammary infections in dairy cows.
AB  == the association of common bacterial pathogens in milk samples during calving with udder shape or the presence of 'teat-end' lesions was investigated in 240 dairy cows from two herds. sixty-three of 120 cows (53%) in one herd (herd a) and 54/120 animals (45%) in a second herd (herd b) had normal-shaped udders. the remaining animals had udder shapes defined as follows: large pendulous (18% herd  a, 26% herd b); large between hindquarter (10% herd a, 17% herd b); overall small (8% herd a, 5% herd b); or small but pendulous (11% herd a, 7% herd b). at calving teat-end lesions were present in 63% and 76% of the quarters of herd a and b animals, respectively. there was no herd effect on udder shape or teat-end  lesions. analysis of variance revealed that udder shape and teat-end lesions did  not have a significant association with quarter somatic cell count. however there was some association between mammary infection and udder shape and teat-end lesions. compared to other udder shapes, cows with large between hindquarter shape had significantly less staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus uberis infection (p<0.001). there was a similar albeit less significant negative association with escherichia coli infection (p<0.01). infection with streptococcus agalactiae and streptococcus dysgalactiae was more frequent in cows with large pendulous and overall small udder conformations. the results also suggest an association between intra-mammary infection at calving and the presence of hyperkeratotic teat-end lesions, given that s. aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, s. uberis, s. agalactiae and e. coli were cultured from significantly more quarters with such lesions than from quarters without lesions or with other types of lesion (p<0.001).

TI  == cns mastitis: nothing to worry about?
AB  == in this paper, we analyzed a very large field data set on intramammary infections (imi) and the associated somatic cell count (scc) in dairy cows. the objective of the study was to analyze the impact of coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns) imi on cow scc, both mean and variability, and on the potential of these infections to have a major impact on the bulk milk scc (bmscc). data and milk samples for bacterial culture were collected by quality milk production services (qmps) between 1992 and march of 2007. the qmps program services dairy farms in new york state and other states in the northeastern usa and operates in conjunction with cornell university. only records from cows where scc and milk production data were available, and where only one organism was isolated from bacterial cultures  of milk samples (or where culture was negative) were used for this analysis. a total of 352,614 records from 4200 whole herd mastitis screening sampling qualified for this study. within herds an average of 15% (s.d. 12%) of cows sampled were infected with cns, ranging between 0 and 100%. average within herd prevalence of cows with a cns imi and an scc over 200,000 cells/ml was 2% (s.d. 4%) with a minimum of 0% and a maximum of 50%. results of linear mixed models showed three distinct populations of imi statuses: negative cultures with the lowest scc; cns and corynebacterium bovis with a moderate increase in scc, and streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus spp. and staphylococcus aureus showing an important increase in scc. surprisingly, milk production was slightly but significantly higher in cns infected cows compared to culture-negative cows, whereas it was strongly reduced in cows with a major pathogen imi. the percentage contribution of cns infections to the bmscc was 17.9% in herds with a bmscc less  than 200,000 cells/ml. this value decreased to 11.9 and 7.9% in herds with bulk milk scc between 200,000 and 400,000 and over 400,000 cells/ml, respectively. we  concluded that very few herds with milk quality problems would have an important  increase in bmscc that could be mostly attributed to cns infections. on the other hand, in herds with low bmscc, cns infections may be an important contributor to  the total number of somatic cells in the bulk milk.

TI  == deaths of early-onset, invasive sepsis in full-term infants in miyazaki: nine cases from a regional population-based analysis from 1998-2006.
AB  == in a population-based study we investigated the early-onset, invasive sepsis caused by group b streptococcus (gbs) and non-gbs in the era of intrapartum antimicrobial prophylaxis. from 1998 to 2006, we had 387 perinatal deaths in 98,495 deliveries, and 9 full-term infants met the criteria of early-onset, invasive sepsis, in which microorganisms were proven from blood sampling. of these cases, 4 involved gbs, 2 ampicillin-resistant escherichia coli, 2 methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, and 1 was unidentified. all 4 cases  of gbs related death underwent improper procedures contrary to the prophylaxis recommendation. eighty percent of non-gbs related deaths had septicemia of antibiotic-resistant pathogens. we found in our population-based study that early-onset, fatal sepsis in full-term infants is associated with insufficient adherence to the prophylaxis strategy for gbs and with the emergence of antimicrobial resistant non-gbs bacteria.

TI  == in vitro activity of daptomycin against gram-positive cocci: the first multicentre study in greece.
AB  == a total of 10420 gram-positive cocci (including staphylococci, enterococci and various groups of streptococci) collected from clinically significant specimens in ten greek hospitals during 2006--2007 were tested for their susceptibility to  daptomycin. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) was determined by the broth microdilution method. daptomycin demonstrated very high activity against enterococcus faecalis (mic at which 50% of the isolates were inhibited (mic50) =  1mg/l and mic at which 90% of the isolates were inhibited (mic90) = 1.36 mg/l), enterococcus faecium (mic50 = 1.36 mg/l and mic90 = 1.90 mg/l), streptococcus pyogenes (mic50 = 0.12 mg/l and mic90 = 0.50mg/l), streptococcus agalactiae (mic50 = 0.09 mg/l and mic90 = 0.12 mg/l), streptococcus pneumoniae (mic50 = 0.24 mg/l and mic90 = 0.5 mg/l) and viridans group streptococci (mic50 = 0.50 mg/l and mic90 = 0.89 mg/l). resistance to linezolid and vancomycin for enterococci and to penicillin for streptococci appears to be independent of reduced susceptibility to daptomycin. on the other hand, daptomycin was also active against meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mic50 = 0.44 mg/l and mic90 = 0.78 mg/l) and meticillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (mic50 = 0.24 mg/l and mic90 = 0.44 mg/l); however, 0.9% of the staphylococci tested had an mic > 1mg/l, which is the clinical and laboratory standards institute breakpoint proposed for susceptibility. for all tested organism groups, resistance to daptomycin was not associated with glycopeptide resistance.

AB  == retapamulin, the first pleuromutilin antimicrobial agent approved for the topical treatment of skin infections in humans, was tested against 987 clinical isolates  representing 30 species and/or resistance groups. mics were determined along with disk diffusion zone diameters using a 2-microg disk. population distribution and  mic versus disk zone diameter scattergrams were analyzed to determine microbiological mic cutoff values and inhibition zone correlates. minimum bactericidal concentrations were performed on a smaller subset of key species. the retapamulin mic(90) against 234 staphylococcus aureus isolates and 110 coagulase-negative staphylococci was 0.12 microg/ml. retapamulin mic(90)s ranged  from 0.03 to 0.06 microg/ml against beta-hemolytic streptococci including 102 streptococcus pyogenes, 103 streptococcus agalactiae, 59 group c streptococcus, and 71 group g streptococcus isolates. the mic(90) against 55 viridans group streptococci was 0.25 microg/ml. retapamulin had very little activity against 151 gram-negative bacilli and most of the enterococcus species tested. based on the data from this study, for staphylococci, mics of <or=0.5, 1, and >or=2 microg/ml  with corresponding disk diffusion values of >or=20 mm, 17 to 19 mm, and <or=16 mm can be proposed for susceptible, intermediate, and resistant microbiological cutoffs, respectively. for beta-hemolytic streptococci, a susceptible-only mic of <or=0.25 microg/ml with a corresponding disk diffusion value of >or=15 mm can be  proposed for susceptible-only microbiological cutoffs.

TI  == bacteriocin st91km, produced by streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. macedonicus st91km, is a narrow-spectrum peptide active against bacteria associated with mastitis in dairy cattle.
AB  == streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. macedonicus st91km produces a bacteriocin (macedocin st91km) active against streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae, streptococcus uberis, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis. macedocin st91km is, according to tricine-sds page, between 2.0 and 2.5 kda in size. antimicrobial activity remained unchanged  after 2 h of incubation at ph 2.0-10.0 and after 100 min at 100 degrees c. the peptide was inactivated after 20 min at 121 degrees c and when treated with proteolytic enzymes. treatment with alpha-amylase had no effect on activity, suggesting that the mode of action does not depend on glycosylation. amplification of the genome of strain st91km with primers designed from the macedocin precursor gene (mcda) produced 2 fragments (approximately 375 and 220 bp) instead of one 150-bp fragment, as recorded for macedocin produced by streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. macedonicus aca-dc 198. strain aca-dc 198 was not available. however, dna amplified from strain lmg 18488 (aca-dc 206), genetically closely related to strain aca-dc 198, revealed 99% homology to the mcda of strain aca-dc 198 (accession no. dq835394). macedocin st91km may thus be  a second putative bacteriocin described for streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. macedonicus.

TI  == the response of hek293 cells transfected with bovine tlr2 to established pathogen-associated molecular patterns and to bacteria causing mastitis in cattle.
AB  == toll-like receptors (tlrs) are key sensors of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (pamps). their role in immunity is difficult to examine in species of veterinary interest, due to restricted access to the knockout technology and tlr-specific antibodies. an alternative approach is to generate cell lines transfected with various tlrs and to examine the recognition of pamps or relevant bacteria. in this report, we examined whether recognition of various pamps and mastitis-causing bacteria is achieved by transfection of recombinant bovine tlr2  (botlr2). therefore, human embryonic kidney (hek) 293 cells were transfected by whole botlr2. a clonal analysis of stably transfected cells disclosed variable recognition of several putative tlr2 agonists although expressing similar amounts of the transgene and endogenous tlr6. one clone (clone 25) reacted by copious interleukin-8 (il-8) production to several stimulants of tlr2 such as di-palmitoylated cysteyl-seryl-lysyl-lysyl-lysyl-lysine (pam2), a biochemical preparation of lipoteichoic acid from staphylococcus aureus, a commercial preparation of peptidoglycan from s. aureus, and heat-killed listeria monocytogenes (hklm). tlr2-dependent induction of il-8 release was stronger in medium containing human serum albumin than in medium containing fetal calf serum. clone 25 cells responded to high concentrations of s. aureus and to escherichia coli causing mastitis, but not to streptococcus uberis and to streptococcus agalactiae which also cause mastitis. stimulation by s. aureus was relatively weak when compared (i) with stimulation of the same cells by hklm and pamps derived from s. aureus, (ii) with a clone stably transfected with tlr4 and md-2 and stimulated by e. coli causing mastitis, and (iii) with interferon-gamma-costimulated bovine macrophages stimulated by s. aureus and s. agalactiae. thus, clone 25 is suitable for studying the interaction of putative tlr2 agonists with bovine tlr2-transfected cells, provides a cell to search for tlr2-specific antibodies, and is a tool for studying the interaction of tlr2 with bacteria causing disease, e.g. mastitis, in cattle.

AB  == background: early differentiation between septic and non-septic arthritis is difficult. a previous study showed promising diagnostic accuracy of serum procalcitonin (pct) in septic arthritis, limited by a low sensitive pct test kit. objective: to investigate the diagnostic value of pct in patients with septic and non-septic arthritis using a novel test with low detection limit. methods: forty-two patients, 28 with non-septic and 14 with septic arthritis were prospectively included. for each patient, gram stain, culture and polarization microscopy of synovial fluid was done and pct, c-reactive protein (crp), white blood cell count, uric acid and blood cultures were taken. patients with septic arthritis, patients with non-septic arthritis with and without concomitant infection were compared. results: patients with septic arthritis had a significant higher pct concentration than patients with non-septic arthritis (p<0.0001). at a cut-off of 0.1 (0.25) ng/ml, sensitivity for septic arthritis was 100(93)% and specificity 46(75)%. specificity rose to 93% after exclusion of  patients with non-septic arthritis and concomitant infection. both sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of septic arthritis were higher for pct than crp. conclusions: our data suggest that pct seems to be a highly sensitive and specific marker for septic arthritis, depending on the clinical setting. further  studies are warranted.

TI  == bovine mastitis and antibiotic resistance patterns in selalle smallholder dairy farms, central ethiopia.
AB  == a study was conducted to determine the prevalence of mastitis, identify the major bacterial pathogens and test the antimicrobial resistance of milk bacterial isolates in smallholder dairy farms in selalle area, ethiopia. a total of 109 smallholder dairy farms comprising 500 crossbred lactating cows were included. the prevalence of clinical mastitis at herd, cow and quarter level was 8.3% (n=9), 1.8% (n=9) and 0.51% (n=10), respectively, while that of sub-clinical mastitis was 54.7%, 22.3% and 10.1%, respectively. the univariate logistic regression showed that among the risk factors considered, presence of teat lesion, stage of lactation and parity number had significant effect on the prevalence of sub-clinical mastitis. however, after multivariate analysis, only presence of teat lesion and stage of lactation had significant effect. the common isolates from the clinical mastitic quarters were st. agalactiae (30%, n=3) and st. dysgalactiae (30%, n=3), while from sub-clinical cases were s. aureus (42.6%, n=83), s. epidermidis (22.1%, n=43), st. agalactiae (12.8%, n=25) and st. uberis  (10.3%, n=20). staphylococcus intermedius and streptococcus dysgalactiae were the species, which showed high level of susceptibility for most of the antimicrobials tested, while the remaining had varying levels of resistance for almost all the antimicrobials used. among the antimicrobials employed, erythromycin and sulphonamide showed the lowest proportion of resistant isolates. considering the  possible significant economic losses that could be incurred by both clinical and  sub-clinical mastitis, attention should be paid for further detailed investigations including the economic losses and benefits of interventions in the study area.

TI  == the generation of nisin variants with enhanced activity against specific gram-positive pathogens.
AB  == nisin is the prototype of the lantibiotic group of antimicrobial peptides. it exhibits broad spectrum inhibition of gram-positive bacteria including important  food pathogens and clinically relevant antibiotic-resistant bacteria. significantly, the gene-encoded nature of nisin means that it can be subjected to gene-based bioengineering to generate novel derivatives. here, we take advantage  of this to generate the largest bank of randomly mutated nisin derivatives reported to date, with the ultimate aim of identifying variants with enhanced bioactivity. this approach led to the identification of a nisin-producing strain  with enhanced bioactivity against the mastitic pathogen streptococcus agalactiae  resulting from an amino acid change in the hinge region of the peptide (k22t). prompted by this discovery, site-directed and site-saturation mutagenesis of the  hinge region residues was employed, resulting in the identification of additional derivatives, most notably n20p, m21v and k22s, with enhanced bioactivity and specific activity against gram-positive pathogens including listeria monocytogenes and/or staphylococcus aureus. the identification of these derivatives represents a major step forward in the bioengineering of nisin, and lantibiotics in general, and confirms that peptide engineering can deliver derivatives with enhanced antimicrobial activity against specific problematic spoilage and pathogenic microbes or against gram-positive bacteria in general.

AB  == this report was delineated to study the clinical, bacteriological and therapeutic aspects concerned with acute coliform mastitis in buffaloes. bacteriological examination of 80 quarter milk samples obtained aseptically from 56 buffaloes with acute mastitis revealed that coliform bacteria was the most common pathogen  (45 cases) followed by staphylococcus aureus (seven cases) then streptococcus uberis (three cases), and streptococcus agalactiae (one case). clinically, hotness, swelling and painful reaction with serous excretion containing clots was recorded in buffaloes with coliform mastitis. the efficacy of ceftiofur was evaluated in the treatment of buffaloes with acute coliform mastitis. parenteral  ceftiofur neither improved clinical signs nor returned milk to pre-infection production level, whereas intramammary ceftiofur and combination of intramammary  with parenteral ceftiofur improved the clinical signs in 10/15 and 12/15 buffaloes, respectively. on quarter level, 3/17, 12/17 and 15/21 quarters recovered in groups received parenteral, intramammary and combination therapy, respectively. this study demonstrates that systemic ceftofur is not effective in  the treatment of clinical coliform mastitis in buffaloes.

AB  == in the present study the lower genital tract microbiota in asymptomatic fertile women (n=34) was identified and quantified by culturing vaginal secretions. also, vaginal and cervical samples were analyzed by a semiquantitative checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique (cdh) based on genomic probes prepared from 13 bacterial species (bacteroides ureolyticus, escherichia coli, fusobacterium nucleatum, gardnerella vaginalis, mobiluncus curtisii ss curtisii, prevotella bivia, prevotella disiens, prevotella melaninogenica, atopobium vaginae, lactobacillus iners, staphylococcus aureus ss aureus, streptococcus anginosus, and streptococcus agalactiae). the bacterial species found by either culture or cdh were correlated with proinflammatory cytokines (il-1 alpha, il-1 beta, il-6,  il-8), secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (slpi), and endotoxin in the cervicovaginal samples. grading the women into healthy, intermediate, or bacterial vaginosis (bv) as based on gram staining of vaginal smears, the viable  counts of lactobacilli (l. gasseri) and of streptococci-staphylococci combined were highest in the intermediate group. in bv, particularly the high concentrations of actinomyces urogenitalis, atopobium vaginae, and peptoniphilus  harei were noted (>or=10(11) per ml). the total viable counts correlated with both cervical il-1 alpha and il-1 beta. a strong negative correlation was observed between l. iners and total viable counts, g. vaginalis, or cervical il-1 alpha, while it correlated positively with slpi. analysis of vaginal and cervical samples from 26 out of the 34 women by cdh showed that anaerobic bacteria were more frequently detected by cdh compared to culture. by this method, a. vaginae correlated with g. vaginalis, and l. iners with s. aureus. with regard to cytokines, b. ureolyticus correlated with both cervical and vaginal il-1 alpha as well as with cervical il-8, while f. nucleatum, s. agalactiae, s. anginosus, or s. aureus correlated with vaginal il-1 alpha. furthermore, all gram-negative bacteria taken together, as measured by cdh, correlated with vaginal endotoxin and inversely with vaginal slpi. the significance of the results is discussed. in summary, mapping of the identity and quantity of vaginal bacterial species and their association with locally produced host innate immune factors will help in defining various types of abnormal vaginal microbiota, developing new ways of assessing the risk of ascending subclinical infections, and in treating them. cdh appears to be a suitable tool for future analyses of large numbers of clinical samples with an extended number of bacterial probes.

TI  == the establishment of resistance phenotypes for bacteria isolated from outpatients in urine cultures.
AB  == from 1911 outpatients, who addressed a timisoara private clinical laboratory, from january to december 2005, we collected 1,889 urine cultures, 431 being positive. bacteria identification was generally done using morphological, cultural, biochemical characters and pathogenicity tests. sensitivity testing to  antimicrobial medical drugs was done by using the classical diffusion kirby-bauer method and the automatic analyzer osiris, also. the main bacteria involved in the etiology of these infections were represented by enterobacteriaceae, head of the  list being escherichia coli (81.21%), followed by klebsiella pneumoniae (8.35%) and proteus mirabilis (3.02%). we also isolated gram positive cocci (in a much smaller proportion), mainly represented by enterococcus faecalis (1.16%), staphylococcus aureus (0.93%), streptococcus agalactiae, and also gram negative non-fermentative bacilli, such as pseudomonas aeruginosa (0.93%) or acinetobacter baumanii (0.23%). as soon as we performed the sensitivity tests, we divided them  in resistance phenotypes: most of the enterobacteriaceae were integrated in the wild phenotype, followed by the penicillinase producing phenotype. an e. coli strain (0.29%) and 3 klebsiella pneumoniae strains (8.33%) were integrated in the large spectrum, multidrug resistant, beta-lactamase producing phenotype, also associated with resistance to fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides; non-fermentative bacilli did not present special resistance problems, the four pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were integrated in the wild phenotype (secreting induced chromosomal cephalosporinase). as for staphylococcus aureus it was identified a strain having fluoroquinolone resistance, two strains secreting penicillinase and having a k (nm) phenotype and a strain secreting penicillinase  only. antibiotic resistance represents a major concern for patients, physicians,  healthcare managers, and policymakers. the use of antibiotics is closely linked with the development of acquired antibiotic resistance.

TI  == treatment challenges in the management of complicated skin and soft-tissue infections.
AB  == complicated skin and soft-tissue infections (csstis) are a significant clinical problem, partially owing to increasing resistance of infecting bacteria to current antibiotic therapies. two case studies that illustrate complications that can arise when treating csstis are outlined, and methods that can be used to address the problem and the final treatment outcome are detailed. although these  are specific examples, intolerance of and bacterial resistance to current antibacterial therapies are problems that are often seen in the clinical setting  and must be addressed appropriately. the use of new antibiotic agents is one potential solution to these problems, and some of these agents are highlighted. selecting the most appropriate therapy for an infection is often crucial for patient welfare. this article presents some potential approaches to the treatment of csstis.

TI  == toxicological effect of zno nanoparticles based on bacteria.
AB  == streptococcus agalactiae and staphylococcus aureus are two pathogenetic agents of several infective diseases in humans. biocidal effects and cellular internalization of zno nanoparticles (nps) on two bacteria are reported, and zno  nps have a good bacteriostasis effect. zno nps were synthesized in the eg aqueous system through the hydrolysis of ionic zn2+ salts. particle size and shape were controlled by the addition of the various surfactants. bactericidal tests were performed in an ordinary broth medium on solid agar plates and in liquid systems  with different concentrations of zno nps. the biocidal action of zno materials was studied by transmission electron microscopy of bacteria ultrathin sections. the results confirmed that bactericidal cells were damaged after zno nps contacted with them, showing both gram-negative membrane and gram-positive membrane disorganization. the surface modification of zno nps causes an increase  in membrane permeability and the cellular internalization of these nps whereas there is a zno np structure change inside the cells.

TI  == the antimicrobial activity of heyneanol a extracted from the root of taiwanese wild grape.
AB  == aims: to search for antimicrobial compounds against pathogenic bacteria from grape vines (vitis spp.). to investigate the antimicrobial efficacy of active compounds towards methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa). methods and results: the root extracts of taiwanese wild grape (vitis thunbergii var. taiwaniana) showed marked activities against gram-positive bacteria using the disc diffusion method. after purification, the active compound 1 was confirmed as heyneanol a by mass spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance. heyneanol a showed an minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) value of 2 microg ml(-1) towards mrsa and a value of 2 to 4 microg ml(-1) for enterococcus faecium, s. aureus, streptococcus agalactiae and streptococcus pyogenes. in addition, the contents of heyneanol a were determined as 36 mg g(-1) in roots of taiwanese wild grape. conclusions: the root extracts of grapevines have good antimicrobial activities towards some strains of gram-positive pathogens. heyneanol a, the major antimicrobial compound, is especially active towards mrsa. in addition, the abundances of heyneanol a and other stilbenes in the roots of grapevines make it  possible to produce natural antimicrobial compounds from this plant species. significance and impact of the study: this study reports for the first time the antimicrobial compounds in the root extracts of grapevines. the results will have clinical significance owing to their activities against mrsa.

TI  == placental histological inflammation and reproductive tract infections in a low risk pregnant population in latvia.
AB  == background: to investigate the correlation of reproductive tract infections (rti) and endogenous vaginal flora at first antenatal consultation with placental histological inflammation. methods: in a follow-up study, 154 low risk women with no miscarriage risk factors were examined for the presence of neisseria gonorrhoeae, trichomonas vaginalis, chlamydia trachomatis, ureaplasma urealyticum, mycoplasma hominis, gardnerella vaginalis, streptococcus agalactiae  (gbs), staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis (gds) and bacterial vaginosis (bv). at delivery, outcome data were collected and the histology of the placenta  was studied. results: some 85 (56.3%) of all pregnant women had rti or endogenous vaginal flora. placental histological inflammation correlated with genital tract  colonisation with g. vaginalis (p =0.013), bv (p =0.031), s. aureus (p =0.04) and aerobic vaginitis (p =0.017). bv and bv-related g. vaginalis correlated with the  presence of parietal and placental chorioamnionitis in 53.8 and 43.5% of cases. genital tract colonisation with gds and other aerobic flora in combination with inflammatory vaginitis correlated with the presence of funisitis in 33.3 and 40.0% of cases. mycoplasmas increased the risk for intrauterine infection only when present in combination with other rtis (p =0.023). conclusion: histological  placental inflammation is associated with both bv and genital tract colonisation  with aerobic bacteria, while funisitis is associated with colonisation of aerobic bacteria at first prenatal visit before the 17th gestational week.

TI  == integrin beta 1 regulates phagosome maturation in macrophages through rac expression.
AB  == phagocytosis and subsequent phagosome maturation by professional phagocytes are essential in the clearance of infectious microbial pathogens. the molecular regulation of phagosome maturation is largely unknown. we show that integrin beta(1) plays critical roles in the phagocytosis of microbial pathogens and phagosome maturation. macrophages lacking integrin beta(1) expression exhibit reduced phagocytosis of bacteria, including group b streptococcus and staphylococcus aureus. furthermore, phagosomes from macrophages lacking integrin  beta(1) show lowered maturation rate, defective acquisition of lysosome membrane  markers, and reduced f-actin accumulation in the periphagosomal region. integrin  beta(1)-deficient macrophages exhibit impaired bactericidal activity. we found that the expression of the rho family gtpases rac1, rac2, and cdc42 was reduced in integrin beta(1)-deficient macrophages. ectopic expression of rac1, but not cdc42, in integrin beta(1)-deficient macrophages restored defective phagosome maturation and f-actin accumulation in the periphagosomal region. importantly, macrophages lacking rac1/2 also exhibit defective maturation of phagosomes derived from opsonized escherichia coli or igg beads. taken together, these results suggest that integrin beta(1) regulates phagosome maturation in macrophages through rac expression.

TI  == characterization of a bacteriophage lysin (ply700) from streptococcus uberis.
AB  == the antibacterial properties of bacteriophage lytic enzymes may be of importance  in future mastitis control programs. a prophage was isolated from a strain of streptococcus uberis (atcc 700407) following exposure to mitomycin c. partial sequencing of the phage dna revealed a putative lysin based on sequence similarity to other streptococcal phage lysins. the putative lysin (ply700) was recombinantly expressed in escherichia coli, and chromatographically purified. addition of the purified ply700 to bacterial suspensions of s. uberis, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus dysgalactiae caused a rapid, calcium-dependent lysis while there was little activity against streptococcus agalactiae, staphylococcus aureus, or e. coli. killing of s. uberis in milk by ply700 (50 microg/ml) was confirmed by plate count assay. activity was related to the initial concentration of bacteria in that 31% killing (p<0.05) was observed with an inoculating dose of approximately 4500 cfu/ml, while 81% killing (p<0.01) was observed when the inoculum was reduced to approximately 600 cfu/ml. in contrast, complete sterilization was observed in parallel cultures suspended in assay buffer indicating that factors in milk are able to neutralize the lysin. functional characterization of the c-terminal domain, as a component of a gfp fusion protein, revealed its calcium-dependent ability to bind to s. uberis. the  c-terminal domain may have utility in targeting s. uberis while it remains to be  determined if the lysin by itself has sufficient potency in milk for effective use in the control of s. uberis mastitis.

TI  == inactivation of bacterial pathogens in human milk by high-pressure processing.
AB  == low-temperature, long-time (ltlt) pasteurization assures the safety of banked human milk; however, heat can destroy important nutritional biomolecules. high-pressure processing (hpp) shows promise as an alternative for pasteurization of breast milk. the purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy of hpp  for inactivation of selected bacterial pathogens in human milk. human milk was inoculated with one of five pathogens (10(8) to 10(9) cfu/ml), while 0.1% peptone solution solutions with the same levels of each organism were used as controls. the samples were subjected to 400 mpa at 21 to 31 degrees c for 0 to 50 min or to 62.5 degrees c for 0 to 30 min (capillary tube method) to simulate ltlt pasteurization. tryptic soy agar and selective media were used for enumeration. traditional thermal pasteurization resulted in inactivation (> 7 log) of all pathogens within 10 min. in human milk and in peptone solution, a 6-log reduction was achieved after 30 min of hpp for staphylococcus aureus atcc 6538. after 30 min, s. aureus atcc 25923 was reduced by 8 log and 6 log in human milk and peptone solution, respectively. treatments of 4 and 7 min resulted in an 8-log inactivation of streptococcus agalactiae atcc 12927 in human milk and peptone solution, respectively, while listeria monocytogenes atcc 19115 required 2 min for an 8-log inactivation in human milk. escherichia coli atcc 25922 was inactivated by 8 log after 10 min in peptone solution and by 6 log after 30 min in human milk. these data suggest that hpp may be a promising alternative for pasteurization of human milk. further research should evaluate the efficacy of hpp in the inactivation of relevant viral pathogens.

TI  == secular trends in pediatric bloodstream infections over a 20-year period at a tertiary care hospital in germany.
AB  == objective: over the last 20 years, a number of medical innovations with impact on the incidence of bacterial and fungal bloodstream infections (bsis) in children have been developed and implemented. although appropriate empirical antimicrobial therapy is a prerequisite to the successful treatment of bsis, to date, epidemiological data on long-term microbiological trends in bsis of hospitalized  children have not been available. methods: two cohorts of pediatric patients who  were hospitalized in a single-center tertiary care hospital in germany over a 20-year time span (period a from 1985 to 1995 vs. period b from 1997 to 2006) were retrospectively analyzed and compared with respect to the epidemiology and microbiology of bsis. results: a total of 1,646 cases of monomicrobial bsis were  detected. the rate of positive blood culture results dropped from 4.5% in period  a to 2.0% in period b. the proportion of gram-positive vs. gram-negative pathogens recovered from blood cultures remained stable. among gram-positive pathogens, an increase in enterococci (3.3% vs. 8.2%) and in coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons) (22.9 vs. 28.2%) was observed. in contrast, bsis caused by staphylococcus aureus (16.4% vs. 11.7%), streptococcus agalactiae (4.9% vs. 2.1%), haemophilus influenzae (7.3% vs. 0.7%), and neisseria meningitidis (1.9% vs. 0.5%) diminished. in analyzing subgroups, an increase of enterococcal and cons infections was noted among patients with immunosuppression and neonatal early-onset sepsis (eos), while a decrease was found among late-onset sepsis (los) cases with s. viridans. notably, aminopenicillin-resistant enterococci and  aminopenicillin- and fluoroquinolone-resistant enterobacteriaceae all increased over time, while the overall resistance pattern was still favorable. the overall  mortality rate of bsis decreased (5.2% vs. 2.6%). conclusions: over the 20-year study period, the spectrum of specific microorganisms among bsis shifted, with opportunistic pathogens becoming predominant. despite an increase in the proportion of antibiotic-resistant organisms, however, the mortality rate decreased.

TI  == reliability of serum procalcitonin concentrations for the diagnosis of sepsis in  neonates.
AB  == the evaluation of tests for neonatal sepsis is important because the infection may present a very serious threat to the baby. extensive literature exists on single laboratory test or combinations of tests, as well as tests used together with risk factors and/or clinical signs, to diagnose neonatal sepsis. in many instances, the results of the evaluations have been conflicting. it has recently  been suggested that serum procalcitonin (pct) is of value: in the diagnosis of neonatal sepsis, with varying results. this study was designed to determine the reliability of pct concentrations as a new marker for the diagnosis of early neonatal sepsis of vertical transmission comparing to the traditional inflammatory mediators, such as interleukin-6 (il-6) and c-reactive protein (crp) values. the current study included 69 newborn babies. after full history and clinical examination, they were classified into 2 groups: group 1, included 27 of asymptomatic newborn infants admitted during the first 24 h of life to the neonatal unit because of prematurity, low birth weight. they had no clinical signs of sepsis during their first week of life and had a negative blood culture, and they did not receive antibiotic treatment. the second group: group 2, included 42 symptomatic neonates who were admitted to the neonatal care unit and  were evaluated for sepsis during the first 48 h of life, they were subclassified  into twosubgroups: group 2a; included 22 neonates of confirmed vertical neonatal  sepsis, defined as they had at least three clinical signs of infection with culture proven sepsis, and group 2b included 20 neonates of vertical clinical sepsis (they had at least three clinical signs of infection) with negative blood  culture. blood sampling for blood culture, complete blood count, blood gases and  blood chemistry, additionally, crp, serum il-6 and pct were measured. the microbial organisms isolated from the blood culture of group 2a; escherichia coli was isolated from 9 cases, staphylococcus aureus from 6 cases, staphylococcus epidermidis from 2 cases, group b streptococci (gbs) from 2 cases, ureaplasma from 2 cases and one case was gbs positive mother. the comparison between the studied groups revealed that, white blood cell counts (wbcs) and crp levels were  significantly increased in group 2a more than in group 1 and group 2b. while in group 2b the wbcs not differed from group 1 but crp differed from group 1. il-6 and pct values were significantly increased in group 2a more than in group 1 and  group 2b. furthermore in group 2b both were significantly increased as compared to group 1. for the diagnosis of neonatal infection, at cutoff >1.5 ng/ml, pct give a sensitivity of 92.9%, specificity of 85.2%, positive predictive value (ppv) of 84.8%, and negative predictive value (npv) of 76.7%. at a cutoff >140 ng/ml, il-6 gives a sensitivity of 76.2%, specificity of 70.4%, ppv of 64%, npv of 63.3%. however, at a cutoff >12 mg/l, crp gives a sensitivity of 88%, specificity of 77.8%, ppv of 77.1%, npv of 70%. we conclude that the serum pct concentration showed a good diagnostic value for the early detection of neonatal  sepsis of vertical transmission comparing with the other traditional markers of inflammations, thus may facilitate early therapeutic intervention in those high risk group.

TI  == [neonatal infections of the bones and joints].
AB  == neonatal osteoarticular infections remain rare, with an estimated incidence of 1  to 3 cases per 1000 admissions to neonatal intensive care units. it usually results from bacteraemia and may thus be induced by iv catheters. more rarely it  is due to direct inoculation secondary to cutaneous damage, or extension of soft  tissue infection. the particularity of bone vascularization in the newborn explains the frequency of abscess formation in the periosteum or in soft tissues. the main pathogen involved is s. aureus (3/4 of cases), followed by group b streptococci and enterobacteriacae. infection consists mainly of localised and slowly progressing abscesses. however, multifocal and severe infection is possible, in particular when caused by an iv catheter. ultrasonography is the best initial investigation, possibly leading to surgical care. medical treatment  must include 2 synergistic antistaphyloccocal antibiotics, possibly associated with cefotaxime. the outcome is generally favorable, but orthopaedic consequences may emerge if the growth plate is involved. rare specific causes, such as syphilis or tuberculosis, should also be evoked, but the clinical context is generally helpful for the diagnosis.

TI  == prevalence and distribution of mastitis pathogens in subclinically infected dairy cows in flanders, belgium.
AB  == the main objective was to determine the prevalence of intramammary infections (imi) in dairy cows in flanders, belgium. data were obtained from quarter milk samples of dairy herds subjected to a mandatory yearly screening of all lactating cows. a total of 178,668 quarter milk samples were collected at 1087 cross-sectional dairy herd screenings performed in three consecutive years. of the dairy cows, 40% had at least one culture-positive quarter. more than 50% of all imi were caused by non-aureus staphylococci. streptococcus agalactiae is almost eradicated in flanders, whereas staphylococcus aureus was isolated from 18% of the culture-positive quarters. in addition, the distribution of mastitis pathogens in quarter milk samples from selected dairy cows with an elevated somatic cell count (scc) is described. from 6390 cows with a geometric mean composite scc 250,000 cells/ml, nearly 65% had at least one culture-positive quarter. the majority of the imi were caused by non-aureus staphylococci (41.1%), whereas staph. aureus and aesculin-positive cocci were found in respectively 25%  and 18% of the culture-positive milk samples. we conclude that more efforts are needed in the prevention and control of subclinical mastitis in flanders. non-aureus staphylococci are the predominant cause of imi, warranting more research regarding the epidemiology and pathogenicity of those species.

AB  == putative n-acetylmuramyl-l-alanine amidase genes from lambdasa1 and lambdasa2 prophages of streptococcus agalactiae were cloned and expressed in escherichia coli. the purified enzymes lysed the cell walls of streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae, and staphylococcus aureus. the peptidoglycan digestion  products in the cell wall lysates were not consistent with amidase activity. instead, the structure of the muropeptide digestion fragments indicated that both the lambdasa1 and lambdasa2 lysins exhibited gamma-d-glutaminyl-l-lysine endopeptidase activity. the endopeptidase cleavage specificity of the lysins was  confirmed using a synthetic peptide substrate corresponding to a portion of the stem peptide and cross bridge of streptococcus agalactiae peptidoglycan. the lambdasa2 lysin also displayed beta-d-n-acetylglucosaminidase activity.

TI  == camp factor is not essential for systemic virulence of group b streptococcus.
AB  == the gram-positive pathogen group b streptococcus (gbs) is the leading cause of bacterial pneumonia, sepsis, and meningitis in human newborns. gbs elaborates a pore-forming toxin known as camp factor that synergizes with staphylococcus aureus beta-toxin, generating a co-hemolytic reaction useful in identification of gbs in the clinical laboratory. to evaluate the indirect evidence implicating camp factor in gbs pathogenesis, the cfb gene encoding the pore-forming cytotoxin was deleted by precise allelic replacement. the virulence properties of the camp  factor mutant were then explored by a series of in vitro and in vivo assays. compared to wild-type, the isogenic gbs deltacfb mutant demonstrated equivalent phagocyte resistance and endothelial cell invasiveness and also retained full virulence in a mouse model of infection. our data suggest that camp factor expressed in its native context is not essential for systemic virulence of gbs.

TI  == fibrinogen-binding proteins of gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == fibrinogen (fg), the major clotting protein in blood plasma, plays key roles in blood coagulation and thrombosis. in addition, this 340 kd glycoprotein is a stress inducible protein; its synthesis is dramatically upregulated during inflammation or under exposure to stress such systemic infections. this regulation of fg expression indicates that fg also participates in the host defense system against infections. in fact, a number of reported studies have demonstrated the involvement of both the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways of coagulation; the thrombotic and the fibrinolytic systems in the pathophysiology of infectious diseases. it is, therefore, perhaps not surprising that many pathogenic bacteria can interact with fg and manipulate its biology. this review  focuses on the major fg-binding proteins (fgbps) from gram-positive bacteria with an emphasis on those that are known to have an effect on coagulation and thrombosis.

TI  == activity of staphylococcal bacteriocins against staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus agalactiae involved in bovine mastitis.
AB  == the inhibitory activity of seven bacteriocins produced by staphylococcus aureus (aureocins a70, a53, and 215fn) and staphylococcus epidermidis (pep5, epidermin,  epilancin k7 and epicidin 280) was tested against strains of both s. aureus (165  strains) and streptococcus agalactiae (74 strains) isolated from udders of cows suffering from bovine mastitis. most strains of the two species were inhibited by epidermin (>85%), aureocin a53 (>67%) and by a combination of aureocins a70 and a53 (>91%), co-expressed in the genetic background of strain a70, the native producer of aureocin a70. synergy between aureocins a70 and a53 was also demonstrated, which broadened the spectrum of strains inhibited. the remaining staphylococcins inhibited either none of, or a lower percentage (<48%) of, the mastitis-causing pathogens tested. our results therefore show that the use of epidermin and/or a combination of aureocins a53 and a70 may represent a new non-antibiotic alternative for successfully inhibiting both mastitic staphylococci and streptococci.

TI  == an igg-like domain in the minor pilin gbs52 of streptococcus agalactiae mediates  lung epithelial cell adhesion.
AB  == streptococcus agalactiae is the leading cause of neonatal pneumonia, sepsis, and  meningitis. the pathogen assembles heterotrimeric pilus structures on its surface; however, their function in pathogenesis is poorly understood. we report  here the crystal structure of the pilin gbs52, which reveals two igg-like fold domains, n1 and n2. each domain is comprised of seven antiparallel beta strands,  an arrangement similar to the fold observed in the staphylococcus aureus adhesin  cna. consistent with its role as an adhesin, deletion of gbs52 gene significantly reduces bacterial adherence to pulmonary epithelial cells. moreover, latex beads  linked to the gbs52 protein adhere to pulmonary but not to many other epithelial  cells; binding to the former is specifically inhibited by antibodies against gbs52. nonetheless, substantial binding is only observed with n2 domain-conjugated beads. this study presents the structure of a gram-positive pilin that utilizes a distinct igg fold variant to mediate pathogen adherence to  a specific tissue.

TI  == phase 2 study of ceftaroline versus standard therapy in treatment of complicated  skin and skin structure infections.
AB  == ceftaroline, the bioactive metabolite of ceftaroline fosamil (previously ppi-0903, tak-599), is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin with potent in vitro activity against multidrug-resistant gram-positive aerobic pathogens, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus. a randomized, observer-blinded study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ceftaroline versus standard therapy in treating complicated skin and skin structure infections (csssi) was performed. adults with csssi, including at least one systemic marker of inflammation, were randomized (2:1) to receive intravenous (i.v.) ceftaroline (600 mg every 12 h) or i.v. vancomycin (1 g every 12 h) with or without adjunctive i.v. aztreonam (1 g every 8 h) for 7 to 14 days. the primary outcome measure was the clinical cure rate at a test-of-cure (toc) visit 8 to 14 days after treatment. secondary outcomes included the microbiological success rate (eradication or presumed eradication) at toc and the clinical relapse rate 21 to 28 days following treatment. of 100 subjects enrolled, 88 were clinically evaluable; the clinical cure rate was 96.7% (59/61) for ceftaroline versus 88.9% (24/27) for standard therapy. among the microbiologically evaluable subjects (i.e., clinically evaluable and having had at least one susceptible pathogen isolated at baseline), the microbiological success rate was 95.2% (40/42) for ceftaroline versus 85.7% (18/21) for standard therapy. relapse occurred in one subject in each group (ceftaroline, 1.8%; standard therapy, 4.3%). ceftaroline exhibited a very favorable safety and tolerability profile, consistent with that of marketed cephalosporins. most adverse events from ceftaroline were mild and not related to treatment. ceftaroline holds promise as a new therapy for treatment of csssi and  other serious polymicrobial infections.

TI  == group b streptococcal infections in the postgenomic era.
AB  == dr rubens is a pediatric infectious disease specialist and microbiologist, with a longstanding interest in the molecular pathogenesis of bacterial perinatal infections by gram-positive bacteria. group b streptococci (gbs) have been shown  to invade eukaryotic cells and this process may be the main mechanism used by the organism to cause disease in neonates. molecular approaches are used to identify  the genetic and biochemical basis of specific virulence traits, such as epithelial/endothelial cell entry and transcytosis, evasion of innate immune mechanisms by inhibiting complement activation and phagocytic uptake, and microbial survival in various host environments (bloodstream, reproductive system and neonatal lung). hence, these projects apply to both in vitro and in vivo model systems. genetic techniques are also utilized to identify the genes and biosynthetic mechanisms important for the production of capsular polysaccharide and other virulence traits by gbs. recently, dr rubens's group has started a project characterizing the early stages of bacterial pneumonia by investigating the host:pathogen interaction after introducing staphylococcus aureus into the airway using genomic and proteomic techniques. this project will eventually characterize the bacterial response to the lung airway, including specific traits critical for microbial persistence in the face of lung innate immunity. they have also begun to characterize the host airway proteome for the proteins that contribute to innate immune mechanisms.

AB  == this study was undertaken to test the in vitro activity of tigecycline against 117 clinically relevant gram-positive pathogens and to correlate this activity with their resistance gene content. overall, tigecycline showed a minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) range of 0.015-0.5mg/l, able to inhibit potently all multiresistant streptococci, enterococci and mr staphylococci. tigecycline was active against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and enterococci, with mics for 90% of the organisms (mic(90)) of 0.25 mg/l and 0.12 mg/l, respectively, being more active than linezolid (mic(90)=2 mg/l) and quinupristin/dalfopristin (mic(90)=0.5 and 2-4 mg/l, respectively). molecular characterisation of resistance determinants demonstrated the concomitant presence of different classes of genes: in particular, tet(m), erm(b) and erm(c) in streptococcus agalactiae; tet(o), variably associated with different erm genes, in streptococcus pyogenes; vana, tet(m) and erm(b) in enterococcus faecalis, and  vana and erm(b) in enterococcus faecium. all the mrsa strains harboured sccmec and erm genes and 50% possessed tet(k) with tet(m) genes. staphylococcus epidermidis strains were only resistant to erythromycin. these results clearly demonstrate that tigecycline has a mic(90) range of 0.015-0.5 mg/l both against tetracycline-susceptible and -resistant isolates carrying other resistance determinants, suggesting that this drug could play an important role in the treatment of infections caused by these multiresistant gram-positive pathogens.

AB  == nisin is an antimicrobial polypeptide produced by lactococcus lactis and is believed nontoxic to humans. the objective of this study was to evaluate a nisin-based formulation for the treatment of bovine clinical mastitis in lactating dairy cattle. a total of 92 cows with 107 clinically mastitic quarters  were randomly assigned to nisin- (48 cows with 51 quarters) and gentamicin (gm)-treated (44 cows with 56 quarters) groups. in the nisin-treated group, cows  received an intramammary infusion of nisin at a dose of 2,500,000 iu; in the gm-treated group, intramammary infusion of gm was administered at a dose of 0.8 g. results indicated that nisin offered a clinical cure rate similar to gm (90.2  vs. 91.1%) and no difference in bacteriological cure rate than gm-treated group (60.8 vs. 44.6%, respectively). proportion of the quarters with milk somatic cell counts <500,000 cells/ml was not different in the nisin-treated group (50.0 and 47.8%) compared with the gm-treated group (33.3 and 37.3%) 1 and 2 wk after treatment. of 17 staphylococcus aureus isolates, 82.5% were resistant to penicillin, and 35.3% to gm, but none of them to nisin. nisin therapy eliminated  54.5% (6 of 11) of s. aureus imi, whereas gm eliminated 33.3% (2 of 6). nisin in  milk (4.5 +/- 0.8 iu/ml) was detected only at 12 h following intramammary infusion, which was much lower than the upper limit (500 mg/ml) allowed as preservative in milk by the china authority. because of its efficacy in the treatment of bovine clinical mastitis, especially resistant staph. aureus-caused  imi, as well as its safety in humans, nisin deserves further study to clarify its effects on mastitis caused by different mastitis pathogens on a larger scale.

TI  == therapeutic effect of nisin z on subclinical mastitis in lactating cows.
AB  == bovine subclinical mastitis is an inflammation of the mammary gland caused by bacterial intramammary infection, accounting for large economic losses. treatment of subclinical mastitis is not suggested for lactating cows due to the risk of milk contamination. the objectives of this study were to evaluate an antimicrobial peptide, nisin, in the treatment of subclinical mastitis in lactating cows. a total of 90 lactating holstein cows with subclinical mastitis were randomly divided into nisin-treated (n = 46) and control (n = 44) groups. in the nisin-treated group, cows received an intramammary infusion of nisin at a dose of 2,500,000 iu once daily for 3 days while the control cows received no treatment. milk samples were collected from the affected mammary quarters before  treatment and 1 and 2 weeks after treatment for analyses of bacteria, somatic cells, and n-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase (nagase). results indicated that nisin therapy had bacteriological cure rates of 90.1% for streptococcus agalactiae (10  of 11), 50% for staphylococcus aureus (7 of 14), 58.8% for coagulase-negative staphylococci (7 of 17), and 65.2% for all cases (30 of 46). meanwhile, only 15.9% (7 of 44) of untreated cows spontaneously recovered. nagase activity in milk samples and the number of mammary quarters with a milk somatic cell count of > or =500,000/ml were significantly decreased after nisin treatment while no significant changes took place in the control group. because of its therapeutic effects on bovine subclinical mastitis, as well as its safety in humans, nisin deserves further study to clarify its effects on mastitis caused by different pathogens.

AB  == background: this study compared the efficacy of bacterial detection with inactivation for reducing the risk associated with transfusion of platelet (plt)  components contaminated with low levels of bacteria. study design and methods: twenty-one double-dose plts were spiked with seven species of bacteria at three levels (0.003-0.03, 0.03-0.3, 0.3-3 colony-forming units [cfus]/ml). after split, each plt unit contained 1 to 10, 10 to 100, and 100 to 1000 cfus. one unit was photochemically treated (pct; 150 micromol/l amotosalen and 3 j/cm(2) ultraviolet a). the other unit was untreated. all units were stored and sampled on days 1, 2, and 5 of storage for aerobic and anaerobic culture in the bact/alert system (biomerieux). plts were classified as sterile when no bacterial growth was detected after 120 hours of culture. results: in all pct plts, no bacteria were detected throughout 5 days of storage regardless of species, level of contamination, and sampling time. in untreated plts, staphylococcus aureus was consistently detected by culturing. growth of 1 to 10 cfus per unit staphylococcus epidermidis, 1 to 100 cfus per unit of klebsiella pneumoniae, and  1 to 1000 cfus per unit propionibacterium acnes was delayed and only detectable after 5, 2, and 5 days of storage, respectively. low levels of streptococcus agalactiae (1-10 cfus/unit), escherichia coli (1-100 cfus/unit), and clostridium  perfringens (1-100 cfus/unit) were not detected during 5 days of storage, although bacterial outgrowth was detected at higher levels of contamination. conclusions: for the seven bacterial species examined, contaminated plts may be released for transfusion on test-negative-to-date status. in contrast, bacterial  inactivation by pct could reduce the risk associated with transfusion of plts contaminated with low levels of these bacteria.

TI  == albomycin is an effective antibiotic, as exemplified with yersinia enterocolitica and streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == albomycin belongs to the class of sideromycins, compounds composed of iron carriers linked to antibiotic moieties. albomycin was found to be active against  bacteria that have a functional ferric hydroxamate transport system meaning that  bacteria will actively transport albomycin until they die. we examined the activity spectrum of albomycin for bacterial pathogens and found that enterobacteriaceae except species of proteus and morganella were sensitive. resistance in the two genera was due to the lack of the ferric hydroxamate transport system. among gram-positive bacteria, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae were highly sensitive, whereas streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pyogenes, and staphylococcus epidermidis were resistant. the in vivo efficacy of albomycin was examined in mice infected with s. pneumoniae or yersinia enterocolitica. a single dose of 10mg albomycin/kg body weight reduced the colony-forming units of y. enterocolitica by three to four orders of magnitude. a single dose of 1mg albomycin/kg body weight was sufficient to clear  s. pneumoniae infections in mice. in direct competition experiments with wild-type s. pneumoniae and its albomycin-resistant mutant, the recovery rate of  the mutant was lower than for the wild-type indicating that the mutant had reduced fitness in the mouse model. we conclude that albomycin is effective in clearing infections caused by both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria in a  mouse model. albomycin treatment reduces the bacterial load allowing the immune system to remove residual albomycin-resistant bacteria, and as such would make albomycin-based antibiotics an adjunct to treatment. the ferrichrome transport system serves as a trojan horse to get albomycin into bacteria.

AB  == a simple and specific method for direct detection of bovine mastitis pathogens (streptococcus agalactiae (gbs), staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli) in milk products, bacterial samples from milk and isolated bacterial dna was developed. the method is based on polymerase chain reaction (pcr) using sequence-specific primers only for gbs and species-specific primers derived from  16s and 23s rrna for all chosen species. the presence of the gene of surface immunogenic protein (sip) in bovine gbs isolates, described previously only in human gbs isolates was confirmed. the gbs detection was performed with the sequence coding for surface immunogenic protein from gbs human isolates designated as sip specific sequence (sss); this sequence was selected for specific primer design. the sequence is unique for gbs and was designed from a consensus of all known sip genes. the specific identification was shown on a collection of 75 gbs bovine isolates from different localities in slovakia. all isolates were positive to sss, 16s and 23s rrna sequence. the 16s and 23s rrna pcr detection was also performed with s. aureus and e. coli isolates and specific pcr products were also detected. the detection limit of this assay for milk products was 6 cfu/microl (i.e. 6000 cfu/ml) for gbs and e. coli, and 16 cfu/microl for s. aureus. this rapid, sensitive and specific diagnostic method can be performed within hours and represents an innovative diagnostic tool for the detection of milk pathogens in dairy products.

AB  == the purpose of this study was to determine the predictors and outcomes of pregnant women with vaginal-rectal carriage of community-associated methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (ca-mrsa). we performed an unmatched  1:4 case-control study with two control groups (13 ca-mrsa cases, 52 methicillin-sensitive s. aureus (mssa) controls, and 52 s. aureus-negative controls) via a retrospective medical record review. we found that ca-mrsa cases  were 12.5 times significantly less likely to be colonized with group b streptococci (gbs) compared with mssa controls in multivariable analyses. when we compared mssa patients with s. aureus-negative patients, we found that mssa patients were 4.5 times significantly more likely to be colonized with gbs and 11 times significantly more likely to have a postpartum fever > or = 100.4 degrees f in multivariable analyses. traditional risk factors for hospital-associated mrsa  do not appear to predict vaginal-rectal ca-mrsa carriage in pregnant women. instead, ca-mrsa carriage is significantly associated with lack of gbs carriage.  additional microbiologic studies and epidemiologic studies are needed to clarify  the relationship between s. aureus and gbs, given that these two colonizing organisms have the potential to become pathogens.

AB  == we examined antibacterial activities of 4 kinds of macrolides (mls), erythromycin (em), clarithromycin (cam), azithromycin (azm) and rokitamycin (rkm), against 4 bacterial species of clinical strains isolated in 2004. bacterial isolates used were 51 strains of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa), 20 of streptococcus pyogenes, 68 of streptococcus agalactiae, and 120 of streptococcus  pneumoniae. macrolide resistance genes, ermb and mefe, in macrolide-resistant s.  pyogenes and s. agalactiae, and all of pneumococci were analyzed by pcr. antimicrobial activities against macrolide-susceptible mssa of em and cam, were more potent than those of rkm. by contrast, against s. pneumoniae, rkm was more effective than em, cam and azm. against s. pyogenes and s. agalactiae, 4 antibiotics showed similar antimicrobial activities. twelve, 1 and 2 strains of mssa, s. pyogenes and s. agalactiae, respectively, were resistant to em, cam and  azm, whereas rkm was active to almost, but not quite, of them. among 120 strains  of s. pneumoniae, 76 (63.3%) were resistant to em (mic; > or = 0.5 microg/ml), and 23, 15 and 28 strains were highly resistant (mic; > 128 microg/ml) to em, cam and azm, respectively. by contrast, for rkm, there were far fewer resistant strains, and there was no highly resistant strain. pcr analyses of macrolide-resistant genes revealed that 1 resistant strain of s. pyogenes and 2 of s. agalactiae carried mefe and ermb, respectively. in the case of s. pneumoniae, 59, 19 and 5 strains, respectively, carried ermb, mefe and both ermb  and mefe. we also studied about bactericidal activities and postantibiotic effects (pae) of mls using macrolide-susceptible, and ermb- and mefe-carrying s.  pneumoniae, and observed morphological alterations of the strains treated with the drugs by a scanning electron microscope. it was demonstrated that rkm had superior bactericidal activities and pae than other 3 drugs, and potent destructive effects to all of 3 strains.

TI  == multiplexed identification of blood-borne bacterial pathogens by use of a novel 16s rrna gene pcr-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis assay.
AB  == we have developed a novel high-throughput pcr-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis (pcr-ldr-ce) assay for the multiplexed identification of 20 blood-borne pathogens (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, listeria monocytogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, neisseria meningitidis, bacteroides fragilis, bacillus anthracis, yersinia pestis, francisella tularensis, and brucella abortus), the last four of which are biothreat agents. the method relies on the amplification of two regions within the bacterial 16s rrna gene, using universal pcr primers and querying the identity of specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms within the amplified regions in a subsequent ldr. the ligation products vary in color and size and are separated by ce. each organism generates a specific pattern of ligation products, which can be used to  distinguish the pathogens using an automated software program we developed for that purpose. the assay has been verified on 315 clinical isolates and demonstrated a detection sensitivity of 98%. additionally, 484 seeded blood cultures were tested, with a detection sensitivity of 97.7%. the ability to identify geographically variant strains of the organisms was determined by testing 132 isolates obtained from across the united states. in summary, the pcr-ldr-ce assay can successfully identify, in a multiplexed fashion, a panel of  20 blood-borne pathogens with high sensitivity and specificity.

TI  == stochastic modeling to determine the economic effects of blanket, selective, and  no dry cow therapy.
AB  == in many countries, blanket dry cow therapy (dct) is the standard way to dry off cows. because of concerns about antibiotic resistance, selective dct is proposed  as an alternative. the economic consequences of different types of dct were studied previously, but variation between input traits and different types of pathogens were not taken into account. the goal of this study was to create a stochastic monte carlo model to simulate the dynamics of intramammary infections  (imi) around the dry period to predict the economic consequences of dct for different types of pathogens (streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus dysgalactiae, streptococcus uberis, staphylococcus aureus, and escherichia coli). the traits used in the model can be varied. the probabilities within the basic situation were collected from the literature and, because not all information needed was available in the literature, by interviewing experts (n = 10). the expert opinions were translated into minimum, most expected, and maximum values for each of the different probabilities. for dutch farmers, the costs associated  with mastitis and mastitis control around the dry period varied between 10.61 euros and 26.61 euros (average 15.60 euros) for blanket dct, between 4.86 euros and 29.41 euros (average 13.72 euros) for selective dct, and between 4.08 euros and 42.60 euros (average 18.02 euros) for no dct. although there were small differences between the treatment groups, the variation within the treatment groups was much larger. the major portion of the costs for selective treatment (59% of the total costs) and no dct (82%) was derived from the costs of clinical  mastitis after calving, and for blanket dct, the costs of treatment (65%) exceeded the costs of clinical mastitis (27%). the cost of mastitis around the dry period was most sensitive to a change in the risk of new imi during the dry period, spontaneous cure, and costs associated with the antibiotic treatment. the optimal decision to dry off cows depends on the attitude of the farmer toward risk and other farm-specific traits and probabilities such as the new imi rate during the dry period. therefore, it is necessary to make farm-specific calculations so that farmers are able to factor this information into their decisions when choosing the best dct for their situations.

AB  == this study was performed to examine the bacteriological findings in 58 mammary secretions from 15 heifers at 4-5 weeks before parturition, and to evaluate whether a high prevalence of s. aureus infection in lactating cows affects the occurrence of s. aureus infection in prepartum heifers in the dairy herd. a total of 86.7%(13/15) of the heifers and 60.3%(35/58) of quarter milk samples from the  heifers were bacteriologically positive. no s. aureus isolate was detected in mammary secretions from the heifers. coagulase-negative staphylococcus (cns) species were predominantly detected in 54.3%(19/35) and streptococci other than streptococcus agalactiae were isolated from 22.9%(8/35) of the quarters. a high s. aureus prevalence in the herd may not necessarily be a decisive factor for s.  aureus infection in heifers.

TI  == comparison of bactec plus blood culture media to bact/alert fa blood culture media for detection of bacterial pathogens in samples containing therapeutic levels of antibiotics.
AB  == blood culture bottles with antimicrobial removal systems are recommended for patients who develop fever while on antibiotics. this study compared the ability  of becton dickinson (sparks, md) bactec plus bottles and biomerieux (durham, nc)  bact/alert fa bottles to effectively remove vancomycin, cefoxitin, ceftriaxone, cefepime, piperacillin-tazobactam, ampicillin, oxacillin, gentamicin, and a combination of gentamicin/penicillin, thus allowing bacterial pathogens to grow.  each bottle was spiked with 10 ml of human blood, antibiotic, and strains of organisms susceptible to the antibiotic evaluated. the organisms used were type strains and clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus (methicillin susceptible and resistant), streptococcus pneumoniae, a viridans streptococcus, enterococcus  faecalis, enterococcus faecium, streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. testing was completed in triplicate, using 10 to 100 cfu/ml of organisms with various concentrations of each antibiotic. two rounds of testing were completed per antibiotic/organism combination. bottles were mixed and loaded onto their respective instruments as per the manufacturer's instructions. antimicrobial removal was evaluated on the basis of time to detection of organism growth, for up to 5 days of incubation. overall, the bact/alert fa system recovered 25.1% of strains from test bottles and 96.9% of strains from growth control bottles (no antibiotic added), and the bactec plus system recovered 95.1% of strains from test bottles and 100% of strains from growth control bottles. both systems performed well in the detection of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa in the presence of gentamicin. in the presence of ceftriaxone, neither system was able to recover streptococcus pneumoniae. the ability to remove vancomycin and cefoxitin was also determined by measuring antibiotic levels remaining in bottles after 1 h of incubation. the results demonstrated remaining levels of 72 to 90% of vancomycin and 71 to 72% of cefoxitin in the bact/alert system. for the bactec system, remaining levels were 0 to 30% of vancomycin and 0% of cefoxitin. under these simulated conditions, the bactec plus system was superior to the bact/alert fa system in recovering gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial pathogens in the presence of beta-lactam antibiotics, gentamicin/penicillin, and vancomycin.

TI  == isolation and identification of a paenibacillus polymyxa strain that coproduces a novel lantibiotic and polymyxin.
AB  == a new bacterial strain, displaying potent antimicrobial properties against gram-negative and gram-positive pathogenic bacteria, was isolated from food. based on its phenotypical and biochemical properties as well as its 16s rrna gene sequence, the bacterium was identified as paenibacillus polymyxa and it was designated as strain osy-df. the antimicrobials produced by this strain were isolated from the fermentation broth and subsequently analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. two antimicrobials were found: a known antibiotic, polymyxin e1, which is active against gram-negative bacteria, and an  unknown 2,983-da compound showing activity against gram-positive bacteria. the latter was purified to homogeneity, and its antimicrobial potency and proteinaceous nature were confirmed. the antimicrobial peptide, designated paenibacillin, is active against a broad range of food-borne pathogenic and spoilage bacteria, including bacillus spp., clostridium sporogenes, lactobacillus spp., lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc mesenteroides, listeria spp., pediococcus cerevisiae, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus agalactiae. furthermore, it  possesses the physico-chemical properties of an ideal antimicrobial agent in terms of water solubility, thermal resistance, and stability against acid/alkali  (ph 2.0 to 9.0) treatment. edman degradation, mass spectroscopy, and nuclear magnetic resonance were used to sequence native and chemically modified paenibacillin. while details of the tentative sequence need to be elucidated in future work, the peptide was unequivocally characterized as a novel lantibiotic,  with a high degree of posttranslational modifications. the coproduction of polymyxin e1 and a lantibiotic is a finding that has not been reported earlier. the new strain and associated peptide are potentially useful in food and medical  applications.

TI  == identification and sequence of a tet(m) tetracycline resistance determinant homologue in clinical isolates of escherichia coli.
AB  == the presence of the tetracycline resistance determinant tet(m) in human clinical  isolates of escherichia coli is described for the first time in this report. the  homologue was >99% identical to the tet(m) genes reported to occur in lactobacillus plantarum, neisseria meningitidis, and streptococcus agalactiae, and 3% of the residues in its deduced amino acid sequence diverge from tet(m) of  staphylococcus aureus. sequence analysis of the regions immediately flanking the  gene revealed that sequences upstream of tet(m) in e. coli have homology to tn916; however, a complete is26 insertion element was present immediately upstream of the promoter element. downstream from the termination codon is an insertion sequence that was homologous to the isvs1 element reported to occur in  a plasmid from vibrio salmonicida that has been associated with another tetracycline resistance determinant, tet(e). results of mating experiments demonstrated that the e. coli tet(m) gene was on a mobile element so that resistance to tetracycline and minocycline could be transferred to a susceptible  strain by conjugation. expression of the cloned tet(m) gene, under the control of its own promoter, provided tetracycline and minocycline resistance to the e. coli host.

TI  == c-terminal wxl domain mediates cell wall binding in enterococcus faecalis and other gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == analysis of the genome sequence of enterococcus faecalis clinical isolate v583 revealed novel genes encoding surface proteins. twenty-seven of these proteins, annotated as having unknown functions, possess a putative n-terminal signal peptide and a conserved c-terminal region characterized by a novel conserved domain designated wxl. proteins having similar characteristics were also detected in other low-g+c-content gram-positive bacteria. we hypothesized that the wxl region might be a determinant of bacterial cell location. this hypothesis was tested by generating protein fusions between the c-terminal regions of two wxl proteins in e. faecalis and a nuclease reporter protein. we demonstrated that the c-terminal regions of both proteins conferred a cell surface localization to the  reporter fusions in e. faecalis. this localization was eliminated by introducing  specific deletions into the domains. interestingly, exogenously added protein fusions displayed binding to whole cells of various gram-positive bacteria. we also showed that the peptidoglycan was a binding ligand for wxl domain attachment to the cell surface and that neither proteins nor carbohydrates were necessary for binding. based on our findings, we propose that the wxl region is a novel cell wall binding domain in e. faecalis and other gram-positive bacteria.

AB  == aims: lactobacilli, the predominant micro-organisms of the vaginal microbiota, play a major role in the maintenance of a healthy urogenital tract by preventing  the colonization of pathogenic bacteria. the aim of the present study was to assess the ability of four vaginal lactobacillus strains, previously selected for their probiotic features, to block in vitro the adherence of three human urogenital pathogens to vaginal epithelial cells (vec). methods and results: three types of assays were performed in order to determine the inhibitory effect  of lactobacilli on adhesion of urogenital pathogens to vec: blockage by exclusion (lactobacilli and vec followed by pathogens), competition (lactobacilli, vec and  pathogens together) and displacement (pathogens and vec followed by the addition  of lactobacilli). bacterial adhesion to vec was quantified by microscopy (x1000)  after gram's stain. all the strains were able to inhibit by exclusion and competition the adhesion of staphylococcus aureus to vec but none was able to decrease the attachment of escherichia coli by neither of the mechanisms assayed. only lactobacillus acidophillus crl 1259 and lactobacillus paracasei crl 1289 inhibited the attachment of group b streptococci (gbs) to vec by exclusion and competition respectively. conclusions: lactobacillus of vaginal origin were able  to inhibit the attachment of genitouropathogenic staph. aureus and gbs to the vaginal epithelium. significance and impact of the study: the results support the probiotic potential of these lactobacillus strains as anti-infective agents in the vagina and encourage further studies about their capacity to prevent and manage urogenital tract infections in females.

AB  == our medical institution does not have a bacterial culture facility, requiring outsourcing of bacterial culture tests. due to the time elapsed from the time of  specimen collection to culturing, the identification of causative bacteria in respiratory tract infections tends to be difficult. we therefore used transport medium for sputum bacteria examinations. expectorated purulent or purulent-mucous sputum specimens were collected from 32 patients with lower respiratory tract infection. we divided each of the sputum specimens into the two treatment groups: transport medium (seedswab gamma2) ndar and stad disinfection container. paired samples prepared from each patient were sent out for bacterial culture together.  the time elapsed from collection to delivery to the lab were as follows: day 0 (same day, n = 14 patients), day 1 (n = 15), day 2 (n = 2), and day 3 (n = 1). the identified causative bacteria were streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 6 patients), haemophilus influenzae (n =5), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 4), staphylococcus aureus (n = 2), moraxella catarrhalis (n = 2), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 1), and streptococcus agalactiae (n = 1). samples prepared by each of the two methods gave similar results. the utility of transport medium for examination of general  bacteria for lower airway infection from sputum samples was not demonstrated. the rate of detection of bacteria decreased, when the transport of samples was delayed. therefore, we need to send the sputum specimens as quickly as possible.

AB  == the isoelectric points of many microbial cells lie within the ph range spanning from 1.5 to 4.5. in this work, we suggest a cief method for the separation of cells according to their isoelectric points in the ph range of 2-5. it includes the segmental injection of the sample pulse composed of the segment of the selected simple ampholytes, the segment of the bioanalytes and the segment of carrier ampholytes into fused silica capillaries dynamically modified by poly(ethylene glycole). this polymer dissolved in the catholyte, in the anolyte and in the injected sample pulse was used for a prevention of the bioanalyte adsorption on the capillary surface and for the reduction of the electroosmotic flow. between each focusing run, the capillaries were washed with the mixture of  acetone/ethanol to achieve the reproducible and efficient cief. in order to trace of ph gradients, low-molecular-mass pi markers were used. the mixed cultures of microorganisms, escherichia coli ccm 3954, candida albicans ccm 8180, candida parapsilosis, candida krusei, candida glabrata, candida tropicalis, ccm 8223, proteus vulgaris, klebsiela pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus ccm 3953, streptococcus agalactiae ccm 6187, enterococcus faecalis ccm 4224 and staphylococcus epidermidis ccm 4418, were focused and separated by the cief method suggested here. this cief method enables the separation and detection of the microbes from the mixed cultures within several minutes. the minimum detectable number of microbial cells was less than 10(3).

TI  == group b streptococcal bacteremia in non-pregnant adults.
AB  == background and purpose: an increasing incidence of group b streptococcus (gbs) infection in non-pregnant adults has been noted in recent years. to understand the incidence, clinical characteristics, and outcome of gbs bacteremia in non-pregnant adults, we conducted a retrospective study at a tertiary teaching hospital in taiwan. methods: this retrospective analysis included 94 non-pregnant adults (age >/=18 years) with gbs bacteremia hospitalized between january 2001 and december 2003. results: the incidence of gbs bacteremia increased from 0.16 cases/1000 admissions in 2001 to 0.30 cases/1000 admissions in 2003 (p=0.017, chi-squared test for trend). the mean age of patients was 64.7 +/- 1.39 years. at least 1 underlying systemic disease was found in 81% of patients, with the most frequent being malignancy (43.6%), diabetes mellitus (42.6%), and liver cirrhosis (16%). the 2 major clinical syndromes were primary bacteremia (34%) and soft tissue infection (31.9%). the overall mortality rate was 20.2%. staphylococcus aureus and klebsiella pneumoniae were the 2 most common concurrently isolated bloodstream pathogens. polymicrobial bacteremia, thrombocytopenia, and shock were independent risk factors for mortality in gbs bacteremia. conclusions: the increasing incidence of gbs bacteremia is noteworthy, especially among patients with invasive infections. these infections are also responsible for substantial mortality in elderly patients with underlying diseases. susceptibility testing indicated that penicillin g remains the drug of choice for gbs bacteremia.

TI  == lower extremity reconstruction after necrotising fasciitis and necrotic skin lesions using a porcine-derived skin substitute.
AB  == seven consecutive clinical cases of necrotising fasciitis or necrotic skin lesions (42-78 years old; average 65.0 years of age, three females and four males) due to group a streptococcus, group b streptococcus, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and pseudomonas aeruginosa in the lower extremities, who demonstrated rapid systemic symptoms, were investigated for the usefulness of a bilayer artificial dermis, derived from porcine tendons, over 4 +/- 2.4 years (1-7 years). all surgical debridement was confirmed as sufficiently deep and wide for clinically infected lesions and artificial dermis was applied to all wounds.  the average interval to secondary split-thickness skin grafting was about 17.5 days (17.5 +/- 2.44 days, 21 days max., 14 days min.) and the average thickness was 0.009 +/- 0.0022 in. (range: 0.006 - 0.012 in.). no clinical problems were noted during the application of the artificial dermis and the subsequent skin grafting. since, the donated skin graft was thin, the morbidity was minimised. the use of artificial dermis after extensive surgical debridement in necrotising  fasciitis was easy and effective. local or systemic infection was negligible.

TI  == prevalence of mastitis pathogens and their resistance against antimicrobial agents in dairy cows in brandenburg, germany.
AB  == the primary objective of this study was to determine management practices concerning mastitis in brandenburg, germany, the prevalence of mastitis pathogens in dairy cows, and their resistance to selected antimicrobial agents. a further objective was to study the potential effect of parity and stage of lactation on the resistance of staphylococcus aureus isolates against ampicillin. milk samples for microbiological culture were collected from 4 groups of clinically healthy cows (first lactation, >1 lactation, >50 d in milk, and >250 d in milk; 8 cows/group) in 80 dairy herds. resistance of gram-positive pathogens against 6 antimicrobial agents was tested using the broth microdilution method. mastitis pathogens were isolated from 26.4% of the milk samples. coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns, 9.1% of quarters) and corynebacterium bovis (7.3%) were the pathogens most frequently isolated. among the major pathogens, staph. aureus (5.7%) and streptococcus uberis (1.0%) had the highest prevalence. streptococcus  agalactiae was isolated in samples from 29% of the herds. although the prevalence of most pathogens was higher in older cows, the prevalence of cns was higher in primiparous cows. results of the mastitis control questionnaire showed that cows  with clinical mastitis were transferred to a sick cow pen in 70% of the herds. cephalosporins were the drug of first choice for treatment of clinical mastitis cases followed by fixed combinations of antimicrobial agents, beta-lactamase-resistant penicillins, and penicillin. most farmers treated cows 3 to 4 times per case. cloxacillin, alone or in combination, and penicillin were most often used for dry-cow therapy. antimicrobial resistance of the pathogens was within the range of other reports. resistance of staph. aureus to ampicillin  increased significantly during the first lactation. further research is required  to determine the factors that lead to the selection of staph. aureus strains that are resistant to ampicillin during the first lactation.

TI  == short communication: disinfectant containing a complex of skin conditioners.
AB  == the efficacies of 2 new teat dip formulations were tested against experimental challenge by contagious mastitis pathogens staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus agalactiae over a 12-wk period. formulations contained an iodine complex (0.5 or 1.0% iodine) and skin conditioning agents (propylene glycol, polyvinylpyrridone, glycerine, lanolin, allantoin, and aloe). percentage reduction (dipped vs. control mammary quarters) in new contagious mastitis pathogen intramammary infections for the 0.5 and 1.0% iodine dips was 65.4 and 84.5, respectively. both dips were significantly effective in reducing new contagious intramammary infections. teat skin scores and teat end scores varied over time but were virtually identical for both treated and control teats, for both treatments. thus, both dips were effective in reducing new contagious mastitis infections without untoward effects on teat skin condition.

TI  == capillary isoelectric focusing of proteins and microorganisms in dynamically modified fused silica with uv detection.
AB  == we suggest a method for the reproducible and efficient capillary isoelectric focusing of proteins and microorganisms in the ph gradient 3-10. the method involves the segmental injection of the simple ampholytes, the solution of the selected electrolytes, and the sample mixture of bioanalytes and carrier ampholytes to the fused silica capillaries dynamically modified by poly(ethylene  glycol), peg 4000, which is added to the catholyte, the anolyte and injected solutions. in order to receive the reproducible results, the capillaries were rinsed by the mixture of acetone/ethanol between analyses. for the tracing of the ph gradients the low-molecular-mass pi markers were used. the simple proteins and the mixed cultures of microorganisms, saccharomyces cerevisiae ccm 8191, escherichia coli ccm 3954, candida albicans ccm 8180, candida parapsilosis, candida krusei, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae ccm 6187, enterococcus faecalis ccm 4224, staphylococcus epidermidis ccm 4418 and stenotrophomonas maltophilia, were focused and separated by the method suggested. the minimum detectable number of microbial cells was 5x10(2) to 1x10(3) with on-column uv detection at 280 nm.

TI  == lactobacilli in the female genital tract in relation to other genital microbes and vaginal ph.
AB  == background: the relationship between lactobacilli and other microbes and the association with vaginal ph in the female genital tract were examined. the study  also included evaluation of the possibility of supplying probiotics to the genital tract by using panty liners impregnated with the probiotic strain lactobacillus plantarum lb931. methods: this was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter study involving 191 healthy fertile women. specified microbes were counted and vaginal ph was measured once a month for five consecutive months. results: major individual variations in the genital  microflora composition and the vaginal ph were found among the women. the number  of lactobacilli was significantly related to vaginal ph (p<0.001) and approximately 70% of the women were permanent carriers of individual lactobacilli strains. women with high numbers of lactobacilli were less prevalent with group b streptococci than women with low numbers (p=0.036), and these women had a lower mean vaginal ph. the number of lactobacilli also correlated with the prevalence of yeast. lb931 could be found in 86% of the labial samples and 54% of the vaginal samples. conclusions: high numbers of lactobacilli may contribute to a low vaginal ph and seem to have a negative influence on group b streptococci. lb931 could be transferred from the panty liners to both the vagina and the labial fold.

TI  == infectious causes of reproductive loss in camelids.
AB  == reproductive losses in camelids are due to infertility, pregnancy loss, udder diseases and neonatal mortality caused by a variety of infectious diseases. uterine infection and abortion represent the major complaint in camelid veterinary practice. the major infectious organisms in endometritis and metritis  are e. coli and streptococcus equi subspecies zooepidemicus. abortion rates due to infectious diseases vary from 10% to more than 70% in some areas. leptospirosis, toxoplasmosis and chlamydiosis have been diagnosed as the major causes of abortion in llamas and alpacas. in camels, brucellosis and trypanosomiasis represent the major causes of infectious abortion in the middle east and africa. mastitis is rare in south american camelids. the prevalence of subclinical udder infection in camels can reach very high proportions in dairy camels. udder infections are primarily due to streptococcus agalactiae and staphylococcus aureus. neonatal mortality is primarily due to diarrhea following  failure of passive transfer and exposure to e. coli, rotavirus, coronavirus, coccidia and salmonella. this paper reviews the etio-pathogenesis of these causes of reproductive losses, as well as the major risk factors and strategies to prevent their occurrence.

TI  == peptidoglycan hydrolase fusions maintain their parental specificities.
AB  == the increased incidence of bacterial antibiotic resistance has led to a renewed search for novel antimicrobials. avoiding the use of broad-range antimicrobials through the use of specific peptidoglycan hydrolases (endolysins) might reduce the incidence of antibiotic-resistant pathogens worldwide. staphylococcus aureus  and streptococcus agalactiae are human pathogens and also cause mastitis in dairy cattle. the ultimate goal of this work is to create transgenic cattle that are resistant to mastitis through the expression of an antimicrobial protein(s) in their milk. toward this end, two novel antimicrobials were produced. the (i) full-length and (ii) 182-amino-acid, c-terminally truncated s. agalactiae bacteriophage b30 endolysins were fused to the mature lysostaphin protein of staphylococcus simulans. both fusions display lytic specificity for streptococcal pathogens and s. aureus. the full lytic ability of the truncated b30 protein also suggests that the sh3b domain at the c terminus is dispensable. the fusions are active in a milk-like environment. they are also active against some lactic acid  bacteria used to make cheese and yogurt, but their lytic activity is destroyed by pasteurization (63 degrees c for 30 min). immunohistochemical studies indicated that the fusion proteins can be expressed in cultured mammalian cells with no obvious deleterious effects on the cells, making it a strong candidate for use in future transgenic mice and cattle. since the fusion peptidoglycan hydrolase also  kills multiple human pathogens, it also may prove useful as a highly selective, multipathogen-targeting antimicrobial agent that could potentially reduce the use of broad-range antibiotics in fighting clinical infections.

TI  == evidence for siderophore-dependent iron acquisition in group b streptococcus.
AB  == mutagenesis of group b streptococcus (gbs) with tnphoz, a transposon designed to  identify secreted protein genes, identified the gene homologues fhud and fhug. the encoded proteins participate in siderophore (hydroxamate)-dependent iron(iii) transport in other bacterial species. sequence analysis of the genome determined  that fhud and fhug are members of a polycistronic operon comprised of four genes, fhucdbg, that encode a putative atpase, cell surface receptor and two transmembrane proteins respectively. we hypothesized that fhud was a siderophore  receptor. western analysis of cell extracts localized fhud to the bacterial cell  membrane. fluorescence quenching experiments determined that purified fhud bound  hydroxamate-type siderophores. fhud displayed highest affinity for iron(iii)-desferroxamine, with a k(d) (microm) = 0.05, identical to that described for fhud2 from staphylococcus aureus. the role of fhu in siderophore-iron transport was also characterized. a fhu mutant, acfhu1, was equally sensitive to the iron-dependent antibiotic streptonigrin as the wild-type strain, suggesting that acfhu1 was not reduced for intracellular iron concentrations in the absence of exogenous siderophore. however, acfhu1 transported significantly less siderophore-bound iron in (55)fe accumulation assays. these data provide the first evidence of siderophore-mediated iron acquisition by gbs.

TI  == technical note: improved method for rapid dna extraction of mastitis pathogens directly from milk.
AB  == efficient control against bovine mastitis requires sensitive, rapid, and specific tests to detect and identify the main bacteria that cause heavy losses to the dairy industry. molecular detection of pathogenic microorganisms is based on dna  amplification of the target pathogen. therefore, efficient extraction of dna from pathogenic bacteria is a major step. in this study, we aimed to develop a specific, sensitive, and rapid method to extract dna directly from the main gram-positive bacteria known to cause bovine mastitis (staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus dysgalactiae, and streptococcus uberis) found in milk samples. the dna extraction method is based on the lysing and nuclease-inactivating properties of the chaotropic agent, guanidinium thiocyanate, together with the nucleic acid-binding properties of the silica particles. an efficient protocol consisting of 6 basic steps (3 of which were done twice) was developed and applied directly to milk samples. absence of pcr inhibitors and dna quality were evaluated by pcr amplification of the species-specific dna sequences of the target bacteria. the level of sensitivity achieved in our experiments is applicable to milk sample analysis without sample  enrichment.

TI  == ability of the heparan sulfate proteoglycan syndecan-1 to participate in bacterial translocation across the intestinal epithelial barrier.
AB  == although hundreds of microbial species reside in the human intestinal tract, comparatively few (e.g., escherichia coli and other enterobacteria, enterococcus  faecalis, etc.) are typically associated with systemic infection in postsurgical, shock, and trauma patients. syndecan-1 is the predominant cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan expressed on epithelia, and there is substantial evidence that heparan sulfate participates in interactions of a variety of frankly pathogenic microbes with mammalian cells. to investigate the role of syndecan-1 in interactions of enteric flora with intestinal epithelium, bacteria that might  use the enterocyte as a portal of entry for systemic infection (including e. faecalis, e. coli, and other enterobacteria, and several species of staphylococci and streptococci) were studied for their abilities to interact with syndecan-1. streptococcus bovis, s. agalactiae, s. pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, and s. epidermidis showed increased adherence to arh-77 cells transfected to express syndecan-1. heparin, a heparan sulfate analog, inhibited internalization of s. bovis, s. agalactiae, s. pyogenes, and s. aureus by ht-29 enterocytes (prominent  syndecan-1 expression), but not caco-2 enterocytes (relatively low syndecan-1 expression). data from experiments with chinese hamster ovary cells with altered  glycosaminoglycan expression indicated that heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate (glycosaminoglycans on the syndecan-1 ectodomain) participated in bacterial interactions with mammalian cells. thus, although e. faecalis, e. coli, and other gram-negative enterobacteria did not appear to interact with syndecan-1, this heparan sulfate proteoglycan may mediate enterocyte interactions with some staphylococci and streptococci that are known to cause systemic infections in specific populations of high-risk, immunosuppressed, postsurgical,  and trauma patients.

TI  == antibiotic resistance in outpatient urinary isolates: final results from the north american urinary tract infection collaborative alliance (nautica).
AB  == the goal of the north american urinary tract infection collaborative alliance (nautica) study was to determine antibiotic susceptibility to commonly used agents for urinary tract infections against outpatient urinary isolates obtained  in various geographic regions in the usa and canada. forty-one medical centres (30 from the usa and 11 from canada) participated, with each centre submitting up to 50 consecutive outpatient midstream urine isolates. isolates were identified to species level by the standard protocol of each laboratory. susceptibility testing was determined using the national committee for clinical laboratory standards (nccls) microdilution method. resistance breakpoints used were those published by the nccls, including: ampicillin (resistant > or = 32 microg/ml), sulphamethoxazole/trimethoprim (smx/tmp) (resistant > or = 4 microg/ml), nitrofurantoin (resistant > or = 128 microg/ml), ciprofloxacin (resistant > or =  4 microg/ml) and levofloxacin (resistant > or = 8 microg/ml). of the 1990 isolates collected, 75.1% (1494) were collected from the usa and 24.9% (496) were collected from canada. the mean age of the patients was 48.3 years (range 1 month to 99 years), and 79.5% and 20.5% of isolates were obtained from women and men, respectively. the most common organisms were escherichia coli (57.5%), klebsiella pneumoniae (12.4%), enterococcus spp. (6.6%), proteus mirabilis (5.4%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (2.9%), citrobacter spp. (2.7%), staphylococcus aureus (2.2%), enterobacter cloacae (1.9%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (1.3%), staphylococcus saprophyticus (1.2%), klebsiella spp. (1.2%), enterobacter aerogenes (1.1%) and streptococcus agalactiae (1.0%). among all 1990 isolates, 45.9% were resistant to ampicillin, 20.4% to smx/tmp, 14.3% to nitrofurantoin, 9.7% to ciprofloxacin and 8.1% to levofloxacin. fluoroquinolone resistance was highest in patients > or = 65 years of age. for the 1142 e. coli isolates, resistance rates were: ampicillin 37.7%, smx/tmp 21.3%, ciprofloxacin 5.5%, levofloxacin 5.1% and nitrofurantoin 1.1%. for all 1990 isolates and for the 1142 e. coli only, resistance rates were significantly higher in us compared with canadian medical centres. this study reports higher rates of antibiotic resistance in us versus canadian outpatient urinary isolates and demonstrates the continuing evolution of resistance to antimicrobial agents.

AB  == an evaluation of the microbiota present in cutaneous ulcers from 31 patients with a clinical and parasitological diagnosis of american tegumentary leishmaniasis (atl) was carried out by the standard filter paper disc technique, including antimicrobial susceptibility of the bacterial isolates. microbial examination indicated that 21 patients (67.7%) were contaminated with one to four bacteria and some of them also with yeast. a total of 142 micro-organisms were isolated. staphylococcus aureus was the most frequently recovered bacterium (95.2% of positive patients) and was found to produce type b (70% of the staphylococcal isolates) and type c (50%) enterotoxins as well as toxic shock syndrome toxin (60%). proteus mirabilis (33.3% of the positive patients), streptococcus pyogenes (19.0 %), h(2)s-negative proteus species (19.0%), klebsiella oxytoca (14.3%), enterobacter species (9.5%), peptostreptococcus species (9.5%), pseudomonas species (4.8%), prevotella bivia (4.8%), escherichia coli (4.8%), streptococcus agalactiae (4.8%), bacteroides fragilis (4.8%), candida albicans (9.5%) and candida tropicalis (4.8%) were also isolated. surprisingly, staph. aureus isolates were susceptible to almost all tested drugs, although some of them were  resistant to penicillin (69%) and ampicillin + sulbactam (68%). concerning obligate anaerobes, all the gram-negative isolates (25% of the total) were resistant to metronidazole. the results of the present study show that microbial  secondary contaminants, particularly staph. aureus, should be considered in the diagnosis and treatment of atl lesions.

TI  == simultaneous detection of mastitis pathogens, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus uberis, and streptococcus agalactiae by multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == the objective of this study was to develop a multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) method for simultaneous detection of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, and streptococcus uberis directly from milk. a genetic  marker specific for staph. aureus was used for primers and dual-labeled probe design. the target for strep. agalactiae primers and dual-labeled probe was selected from the cfb gene encoding the christie-atkins-munch-petersen factor. the plasminogen activator gene was the target for primers and dual-labeled probe  design for strep. uberis. quarter milk samples (n = 192) were analyzed by the multiplex real-time pcr assay and conventional microbiological methods. an additional 57 quarter milk samples were analyzed in a separate real-time pcr assay for strep. agalactiae only. using an overnight enrichment step, the real-time pcr technique correctly identified 96.4% of all quarter milk samples; 91.7% of staph. aureus, 98.2% of strep. agalactiae, and 100% of strep. uberis. results of conventional microbiological methods were used to determine the sensitivity and specificity of the multiplex real-time pcr procedure. the sensitivity of the procedure to correctly identify staph. aureus, strep. agalactiae, and strep. uberis directly from milk was 95.5%, and the specificity was 99.6%. results of this study indicate that the multiplex real-time pcr procedure has the potential to be a valuable diagnostic technique for simultaneous identification of staph. aureus, strep. agalactiae, and strep. uberis directly from quarter milk samples.

TI  == antibacterial effect of caprylic acid and monocaprylin on major bacterial mastitis pathogens.
AB  == bovine mastitis is the most significant economic drain on the worldwide dairy industry. concerns regarding poor cure rates, emergence of bacterial resistance,  and residues in milk necessitate development of alternative therapeutic approaches to antibiotics for treatment of mastitis. a variety of free fatty acids and their monoglycerides have been reported to exert antimicrobial activity against a wide range of microorganisms. the objective of our study was to examine the efficacy of caprylic acid, a short-chain fatty acid, and its monoglyceride, monocaprylin, to inactivate common mastitis pathogens, including streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus dysgalactiae, streptococcus uberis, staphylococcus aureus, and escherichia coli. milk samples containing 50 mm or 100 mm caprylic acid, and 25 mm or 50 mm monocaprylin were inoculated separately with a 3-isolate mixture of each of the 5 pathogens, and incubated at 39 degrees c. populations of surviving bacteria were determined at 0 min, 1 min, 6 h, 12 h, and 24 h of incubation. both caprylic acid and monocaprylin reduced all 5 pathogens by >5.0 log cfu/ml after 6 h of incubation. among the bacterial species tested, strep. agalactiae, strep. dysgalactiae, and strep. uberis were most sensitive, and e. coli was most tolerant to caprylic acid and monocaprylin. results of this study indicate that caprylic acid and monocaprylin should be evaluated as alternatives  or adjuncts to antibiotics as intra-mammary infusion to treat bovine mastitis.

TI  == in vitro activity of tigecycline against 6792 gram-negative and gram-positive clinical isolates from the global tigecycline evaluation and surveillance trial (test program, 2004).
AB  == tigecycline, a new glycylcycline antibiotic, has shown promising in vitro activity against many common pathogens, including multidrug-resistant strains. to determine the activity of tigecycline against a broad range of pathogens from diverse populations and geographic areas, the tigecycline evaluation and surveillance trial (test program) commenced in 2003. this study evaluated the activity of tigecycline and commonly used antimicrobials against 6792 clinical isolates from 40 study centers in 11 countries. tigecycline was the most active agent tested against gram-positive facultative species including multidrug-resistant strains. mic90 results (microg/ml) for tigecycline against enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, and streptococcus pneumoniae were 0.12, 0.12, 0.25, and 0.25 microg/ml, respectively. tigecycline was active against enterobacteriaceae with an mic90 of 1 microg/ml. haemophilus influenzae was very susceptible to tigecycline with an mic90 of only 0.25 microg/ml. pseudomonas aeruginosa was the  least susceptible organism tested against tigecycline. tigecycline appears to be  a promising new glycylcycline agent for the treatment of many types of pathogens  with varying resistance phenotypes.

TI  == the use of a hand-held conductivity meter for the diagnosis of subclinical mastitis in dairy cows during late lactation.
AB  == aim: to evaluate the accuracy of a hand-held electrical conductivity meter for the detection of subclinical mastitis in an australian dairy herd in late lactation. methods: a hand-held conductivity meter was evaluated during late lactation in a herd of dairy cows that had a high prevalence of streptococcus agalactiae and staphylococcus aureus infection. the ability of the conductivity meter to accurately discriminate between uninfected quarters and those infected with major pathogens was assessed, using bacteriology as the definitive test for  infection status. milk samples for bacteriology, and electrical conductivity measurements, were collected from 233 quarters from 59 cows. the ability of the device to identify infected and uninfected cows was also assessed. sensitivity and specificity were calculated for a range of threshold values, using absolute values, the range of quarter values within a cow and the ratio of quarter values  within a cow. results: electrical conductivity was higher in infected quarters than uninfected quarters, but the degree of overlap between the populations was substantial, even when quarters were assessed as case-control pairs from the same cow. use of the device according to the manufacturer's recommendations for diagnostic criteria of mastitic quarters had a sensitivity of 51% and a specificity of 71%. the ability of the device to correctly diagnose the infection status of cows was dependent on both the analytical method and the threshold value used. applying the manufacturer's recommended criteria to the diagnosis of  the status of cows, the sensitivity of the test was 91% and the specificity 17%.  conclusion: the variability between individual quarters and between cows in this  study was such that the use of this device to measure the conductivity of milk was not a reliable method by which to diagnose subclinical mastitis in cows in late lactation. clinical relevance: interpretation of results from handheld conductivity meters when used for the diagnosis of subclinical mastitis in dairy  cows needs to be made with care. in some circumstances the results obtained do not accurately reflect the bacteriological status of either individual quarters,  or cows.

TI  == group b streptococcal facet joint arthritis: case report.
AB  == study design: case report. objective: to report a previously undescribed complication of group b streptococcal infective endocarditis, which was lumbar facet joint arthritis. summary of background data: lumbar facet joint arthritis is a rare clinical condition, and the casual pathogen is generally staphylococcus aureus. streptococcus agalactiae usually causes peripartum infections affecting the mother and newborn. it rarely causes infective endocarditis, and facet joint  arthritis has never been reported before. methods: a case of group b streptococcal infective endocarditis and lumbar facet joint arthritis is described. the clinical course, treatment, and complications of facet joint arthritis and infective endocarditis are discussed. results: a nonimmunocompromised patient presenting with fever and back pain was diagnosed to have s. agalactiae bacteremia. subsequent imaging with echocardiography revealed  mitral valve infective endocarditis and magnetic resonance imaging of lumbar spine showed left l5-s1 facet joint arthritis. emergent intravenous antibiotic treatment and mitral valve replacement resulted in complete resolution. conclusions: facet joint septic arthritis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with fever and back pain. s. agalactiae should also be considered among the causal pathogens, and, if present, emergent antibiotic treatment, follow-up for complications, and a thorough search for the source of the hematogenous spread, which can be a life-threatening infection, are essential.

TI  == pyrrolobenzodiazepine dimers: novel sequence-selective, dna-interactive, cross-linking agents with activity against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == objectives: pyrrolo[2,1-c][1,4]benzodiazepine (pbd) dimers are synthetic sequence-selective interstrand dna minor-groove cross-linking agents developed from anthramycins. we investigated the antibacterial activity of three dimers, sjg-136, drg-16 and elb-21, which differ in the structure of the pbd monomeric unit and the length of the linker region between the two identical pbd monomers.  methods: mics were determined against 38 methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), 20 vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre), 12 isolates of streptococcus pyogenes, 12 of streptococcus agalactiae, 12 of listeria monocytogenes and 24 gram-negative clinical isolates. binding to double-stranded  dna was assessed by determination of the dna melting temperature (t(m)). results: mic(90) values for sjg-136 were 0.5 mg/l against mrsa, vre and l. monocytogenes,  0.06 mg/l against s. pyogenes and 0.03 mg/l against s. agalactiae; these were below the maximum tolerated dose of the drug. mic(90)s for drg-16 were 0.125, >0.5, 0.125, 0.015 and <0.008 mg/l, respectively. the most potent compound was elb-21, with corresponding mic(90) values of 0.03, 0.06, 0.06, 0.015 and 0.015 mg/l. there was little or no variation in sensitivity amongst isolates from any one species. all gram-negative species (acinetobacter, pseudomonas, klebsiella, proteus spp.) were not susceptible due to the barrier function of the outer membrane. pbd dimers showed bactericidal activity against mrsa and vre and there  was a significant post-antibiotic effect (1.5--3.5 h). incubation of emrsa-16 genomic dna (50 microm) with 20 microm elb-21 resulted in a large increase in t(m) suggesting that pbd dimers exert their antibacterial effect by cross-linking of the two dna strands. conclusions: these data indicate that this novel class of antibacterial agents warrants further investigation as potential antibiotics for  the treatment of severe infections caused by gram-positive pathogens.

TI  == role of lipoteichoic acid in the phagocyte response to group b streptococcus.
AB  == group b streptococcus (gbs) cell walls potently activate phagocytes by a largely  tlr2-independent mechanism. in contrast, the cell wall component lipoteichoic acid (lta) from diverse gram-positive bacterial species has been shown to engage  tlr2. in this study we examined the role of lta from gbs in phagocyte activation  and the requirements for tlr-lta interaction. using cells from knockout mice and  genetic complementation in epithelial cells we found that highly pure lta from both gbs and staphylococcus aureus interact with tlr2 and tlr6, but not tlr1, in  contrast to previous reports. furthermore, nf-kappab activation by lta required the integrity of two putative pi3k binding domains within tlr2 and was inhibited  by wortmannin, indicating an essential role for pi3k in cellular activation by lta. however, lta from gbs proved to be a relatively weak stimulus of phagocytes  containing approximately 20% of the activity observed with lta from staphylococcus aureus. structural analysis by nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry revealed important differences between lta from gbs and s. aureus, specifically differences in glycosyl linkage, in the glycolipid anchor and a lack of n-acetylglucosamine substituents of the glycerophosphate backbone. furthermore, gbs expressing lta devoid of d-alanine residues, that are essential  within immune activation by lta, exhibited similar inflammatory potency as gbs with alanylated lta. in conclusion, lta from gbs is a tlr2/tlr6 ligand that might contribute to secreted gbs activity, but does not contribute significantly to gbs cell wall mediated macrophage activation.

AB  == in the present study, 188 coagulase-negative staphylococcus (cns) strains were isolated from bovine mastitis cases from 56 different brazilian dairy herds, located in the southeast region of the country, and were tested for antimicrobial substance production. twelve cns strains (6.4%) exhibited antagonistic activity against a corynebacterium fimi indicator strain. most antimicrobial substances were sensitive to proteolytic enzymes suggesting that they might be bacteriocins  (bac). amongst the cns producers, six were identified as s. epidermidis, two as s. simulans, two as s. saprophyticus, one as s. hominis and one as s. arlettae. plasmid profile analysis of these strains revealed the presence of at least one plasmid. the bac(+) strains presented either no or few antibiotic resistance phenotypes. three strains were shown to produce a bacteriocin either identical or similar to aureocin a70, a bacteriocin previously isolated from an s. aureus strain isolated from food. the remaining bac(+) strains produce antimicrobial peptides that seem to be distinct from the best characterised staphylococcal bacteriocins described so far. some of them were able to inhibit listeria monocytogenes, an important food-borne pathogen, and several strains of streptococcus agalactiae associated with bovine mastitis, suggesting a potential  use of these bacteriocins either in the prevention or in the treatment of streptococcal mastitis.

TI  == influence of modified natural and synthetic surfactant preparations on bacterial  killing by polymorphonuclear leucocytes.
AB  == in addition to its biophysical functions, surfactant plays an important role in pulmonary host defense. in this investigation we studied the influence of various commercially available surfactants on the phagocytosis of bacteria that are common pathogens in the neonatal period. group b streptococci (gbs), escherichia  coli and staphylococcus aureus were cultured with isolated human polymorphonuclear leucocytes (pmn) and non-specific serum in the presence or absence of different modified natural (curosurf, alveofact, survanta) or totally  synthetic, protein-free surfactant preparations (exosurf, pumactant). prior to and after 30 and 60 min of incubation with pmn at different surfactant concentrations (1, 10 or 20 mg/ml), the number of viable bacteria was determined  by colony counting. killing of s. aureus by pmn was not influenced by any of the  surfactants. alveofact and curosurf had no significant negative impact on phagocytosis. at 20 mg/ml, curosurf even reduced the number of viable e. coli. survanta at 10 and 20 mg/ml and exosurf at all concentrations impaired the killing of non-encapsulated gbs and e. coli. pumactant at 1-20 mg/ml interfered with the phagocytosis of e. coli. in further experiments we demonstrated that curosurf did not interfere with the phagocytosis of an encapsulated gbs-strain opsonised by a specific antiserum either. in additional experiments we analysed the influence of the different surfactants on the release of reactive oxygen metabolite by pmn and found that the changes in nitroblue tetrazolium reduction did not necessarily correlate with the findings of the studies on killing. in conclusion, we found that killing by pmn was influenced by the bacterial species  and the composition and concentration of the different surfactant preparations. the strongest impairment in phagocytic function of pmn was observed with the protein-free synthetic surfactant exosurf, a phospholipid preparation that contains the alcohols hexadecanol and tyloxapol as spreading agents.

AB  == the objective of the study was to determine the relationship between morphological findings of the surface of teat duct particularly the level of ceratosis and the prevalence of intramammary infections (imi). the study was conducted on a commercial dairy herd housing about 3000 lactating dairy cows. we  examined 891 quarters in the middle of lactation. duplicate samples of quarter foremilk were collected monthly. the bacteriological status of quarters was determined according to the recommendations of idf. at the same time teats were evaluated by clinical examinations. the appearance of teat skin lesions and the status of the teat duct especially the existence of hyperceratosis (hc) was documented. four classes of teat duct hyperceratosis were defined: without, slight, medium and severe hc. the rate of imi in different classes of hyperceratosis of teat duct was compared by chi-square analysis. prevalences of intramammary infections were determined three times (p1, p2 and p3) during the study period. prevalence of infection was high for s. aureus (p1: 5.6% vs. p2: 4.5% vs. p3: 4.3%), sc. agalactiae (p1: 2.7% vs. p2: 2.6% vs. p3: 2.8%) and cns (p1: 10.7% vs. p2: 8.8% vs. p3: 9.6%). furthermore we detected imi caused by other streptococci, yeast, e. coli and mixed infections. a positive correlation between status of hc and prevalence of imi for sc. agalactiae was found. at the second and third sampling time the rate of intramammary infection with sc. agalactiae in quarters with medium hc (p2: 9.21% and p3: 13.73%) differed significantly (p < 0.05) compared to groups without (p2: 1.56% and p3: 1.91%) and slight hyperceratosis (p2: 2.33% and p3: 2.56%). the results of our study indicate a correlation between morphology of teat duct surface, especially regarding to sc. agalactiae. on one hand hc can cause high intramammary infection rate with sc. agalactiae. on the other hand it is possible that hc is the consequence of a quarter infection with sc. agalactiae. further research is required.

TI  == daptomycin - a novel antibiotic against gram-positive pathogens.
AB  == daptomycin is a novel member of a new class of antimicrobial agents used in treating resistant gram-positive infections. these infections are becoming more commonplace and treatment options are limited. at present, daptomycin is approved for use in the us for complicated skin and skin-structure infections that are a common complication of surgery, diabetic foot ulcers, and burns. the most common  causative organisms in these types of infections are staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, and group c and g streptococci. traditionally, these infections have been treated with penicillin and cephalosporins, but resistance to these agents is widespread and increasing. of particular concern is the rapid increase in methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa). the sentry antimicrobial surveillance programme reported that approximately 30% of s. aureus isolates from skin and skin-structure infections were mrsa. the standard treatment for mrsa infections is vancomycin but resistance to this agent is also developing. there is a continuing need for the development of new antibiotics with gram-positive activity, to combat multi-drug-resistant gram-positive infections.

TI  == [rapid diagnosis of neonatal sepsis by 16srrna genes pcr amplification and genechip hybridization].
AB  == objective: to explore a method for rapid diagnosis of sepsis in newborn infants.  methods: (1) the primers and oligonucleotide probes were designed and synthesized based on the sequences of bacterial 16srrna gene. the gene chip was prepared through the probes printed onto special glass slides. the gene chip included 18 special probes: universal probe 1, universal probe 2, gram positive bacterial probe, gram negative bacterial probe 1, gram negative bacterial probe 2, staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococcus (cons) 1, cons 2, escherichia coli, hemophilus influenzae, listeria monocytogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus agalactiae, bacteroides fragilis, bacillus, meningococcus, corynebacterium, propionibacterium; (2) blood specimens from 285 cases of suspected septicemia were cultured and bacterial 16s rrna gene was detected separately; dna isolated from blood specimens and cerebrospinal fluid was amplified by pcr, and pcr products were hybridized with the probes on the gene chips. hybridization results were scanned and read by laser-scanner. results: (1) of the 285 cases, 17 were positive by pcr and the positive rate (5.96%) was significantly higher than that of blood culture (2.81%) (p < 0.01). when blood culture was taken as control, the sensitivity of pcr was 100% and specificity was 96.75%, the index of accurate diagnosis was 0.968. (2) the 17 specimens which showed positive results by pcr were further hybridized on the gene chip. all were positive by universal probes. among all of them, 5 were positive by e. coli probe; 4 were positive by staphylococcus epidermidis; two were positive by bacillus and propionibacterium probes, separately; 4 were positive by cons. the 8 specimens which showed positive results by both pcr and blood culture, the result of gene chip hybridization coincided with the result of blood culture. conclusion: detection of the bacterial 16srrna genes in clinical specimens by gene chip hybridization technology can diagnose neonatal septicemia  rapidly. this method has higher sensitivity and specificity than blood culture or other methods and can provide a rapid way for the etiological diagnosis of neonatal septicemia. therefore the genechip method may be valuable and practical  in early diagnosis of neonatal septicemia.

TI  == guidelines for monitoring bulk tank milk somatic cell and bacterial counts.
AB  == this study was conducted to establish guidelines for monitoring bulk tank milk somatic cell count and bacterial counts, and to understand the relationship between different bacterial groups that occur in bulk tank milk. one hundred twenty-six dairy farms in 14 counties of pennsylvania participated, each providing one bulk tank milk sample every 15 d for 2 mo. the 4 bulk tank milk samples from each farm were examined for bulk tank somatic cell count and bacterial counts including standard plate count, preliminary incubation count, laboratory pasteurization count, coagulase-negative staphylococcal count, environmental streptococcal count, coliform count, and gram-negative noncoliform  count. the milk samples were also examined for presence of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, and mycoplasma. the bacterial counts of 4 bulk tank milk samples examined over an 8-wk period were averaged and expressed as mean bacterial count per milliliter. the study revealed that an increase in the frequency of isolation of staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus agalactiae was  significantly associated with an increased bulk tank somatic cell count. paired correlation analysis showed that there was low correlation between different bacterial counts. bulk tank milk with low (<5000 cfu/ml) standard plate count also had a significantly low level of mean bulk tank somatic cell count (<200,000 cells/ml), preliminary incubation count (<10,000 cfu/ml), laboratory pasteurization count (<100 cfu/ml), coagulase-negative staphylococci and environmental streptococcal counts (<500 cfu/ml), and noncoliform count (<200 cfu/ml). coliform count was less likely to be associated with somatic cell or other bacterial counts. herd size and farm management practices had considerable  influence on somatic cell and bacterial counts in bulk tank milk. dairy herds that used automatic milking detachers, sand as bedding material, dip cups for teat dipping instead of spraying, and practiced pre-and postdipping had significantly lower bulk tank somatic cell and/or bacterial counts. in conclusion, categorized bulk tank somatic cell and bacterial counts could serve as indicators and facilitate monitoring of herd udder health and milk quality.

TI  == seven years survey of susceptibility to marbofloxacin of bovine pathogenic strains from eight european countries.
AB  == this study was conducted from 1994 to 2001 to determine the susceptibility of bovine pathogenic bacteria to marbofloxacin (a third generation fluoroquinolone used only in individual administration for animals). strains originated in bovine diseases from eight european countries. they were isolated from gut infections (escherichia coli, salmonellae), mastitis (e. coli, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus uberis, s. agalactiae, s. dysgalactiae) and respiratory diseases (mannheimia haemolytica, pasteurella multocida, haemophilus somnus). there was no change in the mic distributions for each species after the launch of marbofloxacin in 1997. in e. coli, a resistant population was present before the  use of marbofloxacin having been induced by co- or cross-resistance to other antibiotics used previously. over this period the only a significant change seen  was an increase in mic(90) of e. coli from the gut (1.275 microg/ml in 1994/1995  to 5.098 microg/ml in 2001). all the salmonellae were susceptible to marbofloxacin with a mic(90) = 0.073 microg/ml in 2001 without development of high level resistance. the use of marbofloxacin seems not to have favoured a significant increase and spreading of resistant bacteria.

TI  == nucleic acid-based diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis and improved management using probiotic lactobacilli.
AB  == bacterial vaginosis (bv) is a common condition in women that represents an imbalance of the vaginal microflora, lactobacilli depletion, and excess growth of mainly anaerobic gram-negative pathogens. diagnosis is made using a series of tests or a gram stain of a vaginal smear. treatment with antibiotics is quite effective, but recurrences are common. a study of 55 vaginal samples from 11 postmenopausal women showed the presence of bv by the gram stain-based nugent scoring system, and polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis showed that bacteroides or prevotella species were the most common isolates recovered (24 of 25), with escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus agalactiae also found in some samples. in one case, only gardnerella vaginalis was found. these findings illustrate that bv remains common even among otherwise healthy women, but it is not caused solely by either  gardnerella or mobiluncus. use of a femexam system (cooper surgical, shelton, ct), based upon elevated ph and trimethylamine levels, to screen vaginal smears from 59 healthy women showed poor correlation with the gram stain method. a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of these subjects showed that the lactobacilli-dominant microbiota was restored in subjects with bv but not in controls, following 2 months of daily oral intake of lactobacillus rhamnosus gr-1 and lactobacillus fermentum rc-14. these studies show that nucleic acid-based methods are effective at identifying bacteria responsible for bv. if such methods could be used to develop a commercially available, self-use kit, women would be much better placed to take control of their own health, for example, using medicinal food or dietary supplement products such as the clinically proven probiotic strains l. rhamnosus gr-1 and l. fermentum rc-14.

TI  == efficacy and tolerability assessment of cefprozil in children with acute otitis media.
AB  == young children contract as many as six to eight upper respiratory tract viral infections per year, and these infections frequently lead to secondary bacterial  infections such as acute otitis media and sinusitis. cefprozil is an orally active third generation cephalosporin which has demonstrated activity against the gram-positive organisms streptococcus pyogenes, pneumoniae and agalactiae and against methicilin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus. cefprozil is also active against various gram-ves and certain anaerobic organisms, and is stable to hydrolysis by a number of b-lactamases. present study is an effort to study the efficacy and safety of cefprozil in children with acute otitis media. three hundred and thirty four children aged 6 months through 12 years with clinical symptoms and tympanic membrane signs of aom received cefprozil 30 mg/kg/day in two divided doses per day for 10 days. clinically, 96.6% patients were cured, 2.4% improved and there was failure of therapy in 1% of the patients. there was no need for any rescue medication and any change in antibiotic in any patient. a  satisfactory bacteriological outcome was (i.e. cure, presumed cure, and cure plus reinfection with a different pathogen) was achieved in 95% of patients. in conclusion, cefprozil is a well tolerated and effective drug for acute otitis media in children. moreover, its expanded spectrum of activity, ability to achieve adequate concentrations in tissues, suitability for twice-daily dosing, and proven tolerability suggest that it is a better alternative to agents conventionally used in acute otitis media.

AB  == background: bacterial infections of the central nervous system, especially acute  infections such as bacterial meningitis require immediate, invariably empiric antibiotic therapy. the widespread emergence of resistance among bacterial species is a cause for concern. current antibacterial susceptibility data among central nervous system (cns) pathogens is important to define current prevalence  of resistance. methods: antimicrobial susceptibility of pathogens isolated from cns specimens was analyzed using the surveillance database (tsn) usa database which gathers routine antibiotic susceptibility data from >300 us hospital laboratories. a total of 6029 organisms derived from cns specimen sources during  2000-2002, were isolated and susceptibility tested. results: staphylococcus aureus (23.7%) and streptococcus pneumoniae (11.0%) were the most common gram-positive pathogens. gram-negative species comprised approximately 25% of isolates. the modal patient age was 1 or <1 year for most organisms. prevalence of mrsa among s. aureus from cerebrospinal fluid (csf) and brain abscesses were 29.9-32.9%. penicillin resistance rates were 16.6% for s. pneumoniae, 5.3% for viridans group streptococci, and 0% for s. agalactiae. for csf isolates, ceftriaxone resistance was s. pneumoniae (3.5%), e. coli (0.6%), klebsiella pneumoniae (2.8%), serratia marcescens (5.6%), enterobacter cloacae (25.0%), haemophilus influenzae (0%). listeria monocytogenes and n. meningitidis are not routinely susceptibility tested. conclusions: resistance is commonly detected, albeit still at relatively low levels for key drugs classes such as third-generation cephalosporins. this data demonstrates the need to consider predominant resistance phenotypes when choosing empiric therapies to treat cns infections.

TI  == comparison of the microbicidal and muramidase activities of mouse lysozyme m and  p.
AB  == lysozyme is one of the most abundant antimicrobial proteins in the airspaces of the lung. mice express two lysozyme genes, lysozyme m and p, but only the m enzyme is detected in abundance in lung tissues. disruption of the lysozyme m locus significantly increased bacterial burden and mortality following intratracheal infection with a gram-negative bacterium. unexpectedly, significant lysozyme enzyme activity (muramidase activity) was detected in the airspaces of uninfected lysozyme m-/- mice, amounting to 25% of the activity in wild-type mice. muramidase activity in lysozyme m-/- mice was associated with increased lysozyme p mrna and protein in lung tissue and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid respectively. the muramidase activity of recombinant lysozyme p was less than that of recombinant m lysozyme. recombinant p lysozyme was also less effective in killing selected gram-negative bacteria, requiring higher concentrations than lysozyme m to achieve the same level of killing. the lower antimicrobial activity of p lysozyme, coupled with incomplete compensation by p lysozyme in lysozyme m-/- mice, probably accounts for the increased susceptibility of null mice to infection. recombinant lysozyme m and p were equally effective in killing selected gram-positive organisms. this outcome suggests that disruption of both m and p loci would significantly increase susceptibility to airway infections, particularly those associated with colonization by gram-positive organisms.

TI  == l-ficolin specifically binds to lipoteichoic acid, a cell wall constituent of gram-positive bacteria, and activates the lectin pathway of complement.
AB  == the lectin pathway of complement is activated when a carbohydrate recognition complex and associated serine proteases binds to the surface of a pathogen. three recognition subcomponents have been shown to form active initiation complexes: mannan-binding lectin (mbl), l-ficolin, and h-ficolin. the importance of mbl in antimicrobial host defense is well recognized, but the role of the ficolins remains largely undefined. this report shows that l-ficolin specifically binds to lipoteichoic acid (lta), a cell wall component found in all gram-positive bacteria. immobilized lta from staphylococcus aureus binds l-ficolin complexes from sera, and these complexes initiate lectin pathway-dependent c4 turnover. c4  activation correlates with serum l-ficolin concentration, but not with serum mbl  levels. l-ficolin binding and corresponding levels of c4 turnover were observed on lta purified from other clinically important bacteria, including streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus agalactiae. none of the lta preparations bound mbl, h-ficolin, or the classical pathway recognition molecule, c1q.

AB  == as a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, and carbapenems. changes in the bacterial susceptibility for czop were also evaluated with the resistance ratio calculated with breakpoint mic. sixteen species (2,363 strains) of gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the  clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2001, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus epidermidis  (msse), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis (mrse), staphylococcus haemolyticus, staphylococcus saprophyticus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus avium, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae (pssp), penicillin-intermediate resistant s. pneumoniae (pisp), penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp), streptococcus milleri group and peptostreptococcus spp. the antibacterial activity of czop either against mssa or msse was preferable (mic90: 2 or 0.5 micrograms/ml) and comparable to those of other cephems. czop was also effective  on mrse (mic90: 16 micrograms/ml) but not on mrsa. czop and other cephems had low antibacterial activity against s. haemolyticus (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against s. saprophyticus was comparable to or higher than those of other cephems, but the mic90 of czop in 2001 was higher than those in 1996-2000 (32 vs 1-2 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop  against e. faecalis was comparable to that of cefpirome (cpr; mic90: 16 micrograms/ml) and higher than those of other cephems. no antibacterial activity  of czop against e. faecium and e. avium was observed, like other drugs. the antibacterial activity of czop against s. pyogenes was as potent as those of cefotiam and cpr (mic90: < or = 0.063 microgram/ml), and, against s. agalactiae,  was also preferable (mic90: 0.125 microgram/ml). czop indicated preferable antibacterial activity either against pssp, pisp, or prsp (mic90: 0.25, 1, or 2 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against s. milleri group was also preferable, but the mic90 of czop in 2001 was higher than those in 1996-2000 (4 vs 0.5 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against peptostreptococcus spp. was preferable but weaker than those of cefazolin and cefmetazole. the resistance ratio estimated from breakpoint mic of czop was 95.9% in mrsa, 93.5% in prsp, 63.3% in pisp, 35.8% in s. haemolyticus, 27.9% in e. faecalis, and 13.3% mrse. those resistance ratios were comparable to those for cefepime (cfpm), but e. faecalis showed 91.2% for cfpm. the difference in the resistance ratio of e. faecalis demonstrated that czop successfully maintained its antibacterial activity against these species. in correlation of drug susceptibility, 40.3% of prsp was not inhibited at breakpoint mic either czop or  cfpm while 69.2% at breakpoint mic either czop or ceftazidime. in conclusion, the antibacterial activities of czop against the gram-positive bacteria obtained from the 6-year duration study were consistent with the results from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. a decline in the sensitivities of s. saprophyticus, s. milleri group, pisp, and prsp to czop, however, was suggested.

TI  == results of milk samples submitted for microbiological examination in wisconsin from 1994 to 2001.
AB  == the objective of this study was to examine the characteristics of milk samples submitted for microbiological examination at the wisconsin veterinary diagnostic  laboratory between 1994 and 2001. results (n = 83,650) of microbiological testing of milk samples (n = 77,172) submitted to the wisconsin veterinary diagnostic laboratory from january 1994 until june 2001 were analyzed. submissions included  milk samples obtained from cases of clinical and subclinical mastitis as well as  samples obtained for mastitis surveillance programs. results were recorded as no  growth, contaminated, or identified as specific bacterial pathogens. statistical  analysis was performed to determine trends in the isolation of mastitis pathogens. the proportion of samples identified as contaminated decreased from 20.6 (1997) to 9.5% (2001). the proportion of samples coded as no growth increased from 22.6 (1994) to 49.7% (2001). isolation of staphylococcus aureus decreased from 17.7% (1994) of isolates to 9.7% (2001), while isolation of streptococcus agalactiae decreased from 8.1 (1994) to 3.0% (2001). coagulase-negative staphylococcus spp. were isolated from 12.7 to 17.5%, environmental streptococcus spp. were isolated from 11.6 to 20.1%, and escherichia coli were isolated from 3.1 to 6.7% of all isolates. no growth and contaminated samples comprised almost 50% of total submissions, and it is important that producers have proper expectations when submitting milk samples. the proportion of isolates identified as staph. aureus and strep. agalactiae decreased, suggesting the proportion of contagious bacteria causing mastitis has  decreased. environmental and contagious pathogens demonstrated characteristic differences by season.

TI  == constitutive expression of pcsb suppresses the requirement for the essential vicr (yycf) response regulator in streptococcus pneumoniae r6.
AB  == we report several new findings about the function of the essential vicrk two-component regulatory system (tcs) in the human pathogen streptococcus pneumoniae. the vicr-encoded response regulator, vick-encoded histidine kinase and the protein encoded by the downstream vicx gene are the homologues of the yycf, yycg and yycj proteins, respectively, studied previously in bacillus subtilis and staphylococcus aureus. using a regulatable promoter, we demonstrated that the vick histidine kinase is conditionally required for growth of s. pneumoniae. likewise, we found that the vicx protein is also conditionally required for growth and probably plays a role in the essential signal transduction pathway mediated by vicr and vick. recovery of limited substitutions in the conserved aspartate 52 residue (d52) of vicr was consistent with a requirement for phosphorylation of vicr for growth under some conditions. we applied microarrays to characterize the changes in transcription patterns in bacteria depleted for vicrkx operon expression. our results suggest that the pcsb gene is a target of the vicrk tcs. we present evidence that downregulation of pcsb could account for many of the defects in cell growth, shape, size and morphology observed in bacteria depleted for vicrkx expression. furthermore, constitutive expression of pcsb+ suppressed the essential requirement for the vicrk tcs and allowed the isolation of vicr null mutants.

TI  == enhancement of antimicrobial effects by glucocorticoids.
AB  == in the past few years a body of evidence has accumulated showing that stimulation of human astrocytes and microvascular endothelial cells with ifn-gamma induces a  potent antibacterial and anti-parasitic effect. we have found that the ifn-gamma-mediated activation of the tryptophan-degrading enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (ido) is, at least in part, responsible for this antimicrobial activity. glucocorticoids are frequently used in inflammatory central nervous system diseases to reduce the inflammatory reaction and cerebral edema. since in  many inflammatory conditions infection is either a primary or secondary factor, steroids are administered, in these circumstances, during infection. we investigated whether steroids could affect the antimicrobial effect of ifn-gamma-induced ido activation. we found that hydrocortisone and dexamethasone  enhance ifn-gamma-mediated ido activity in both human astrocytoma cells and native human astrocytes. furthermore, we found that the amounts of ido mrna and of ido protein are enhanced in cells treated with ifn-gamma and glucocorticoids.  in addition, we were able to demonstrate that both steroids enhance the ifn-gamma-mediated antimicrobial activity against toxoplasma gondii, staphylococcus aureus and group b streptococci. the enhanced antimicrobial effect of ifn-gamma in the presence of glucocorticoids is due to the enhancement of the  ido-mediated tryptophan degradation, demonstrated by the complete abrogation of this antimicrobial effect by tryptophan resupplementation. these data show that glucocorticoids, which were often used to inhibit proinflammatory processes, do not decrease ido-mediated antimicrobial effects. in contrast, high doses of steroids were able to enhance the ifn-gamma-induced antimicrobial activity.

AB  == by alkylation of hexamethylenetetramine with halogenated derivatives of ketones,  ethers, esters or amides of acids, alkyl- and aralkyl halides the corresponding n-monoalkylated compounds of hexamethylenetetramine were obtained. the quaternization of pyridine nitrogen in 5,6-benzoquinoline, 8-hydroxyquinoline, quinoline, 1,10-phenanthroline molecules with alkyl- or aralkylhalides was carried out. the susceptibility of gram-positive (streptococcus agalactiae and staphylococcus aureus) and gram-negative (e. coli, salmonella cholerae suis, salmonella enteridis gartneri) microorganisms to synthesized quaternary ammonium  salts by disc difussion method has been detected. the bacteriostatic action of 0.5-1% solutions of all compounds was assessed in comparison with benzalkonium chloride. it was shown, that the most effectiveness against all strains is possessed by quaternary hexamethylenetetramine ammonium salts, and especially salts, containing 1-propynyl- or hydroxycarbamoylmethyl radicals. the action of these two compounds against salmonella and streptococcus was stronger than the action of benzalkonium chloride. susceptibility of pseudomonas aeruginosa to these compounds were detected. it was shown, that 1% solutions of chlorides of n-(1-propynyl) hexamethylenetetramonium and n-(hydroxycarbamoylmethyl) hexamethylenetetrammonium demonstrate the same bacteriostatic action against p. aeruginosa as well as benzalkonium chloride.

TI  == molecular structure and evolution of the conjugative multiresistance plasmid pre25 of enterococcus faecalis isolated from a raw-fermented sausage.
AB  == plasmid pre25 from enterococcus faecalis transfers resistances against kanamycin, neomycin, streptomycin, clindamycin, lincomycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, roxithromycin, tylosin, chloramphenicol, and nourseothricin sulfate by conjugation in vitro to e. faecalis jh2-2, lactococcus lactis bu2, and listeria innocua l19. its nucleotide sequence of 50237 base pairs represents the  largest, fully sequenced conjugative multiresistance plasmid of enterococci (plasmid 46 (2001) 170). the gene for chloramphenicol resistance (cat) was identified as an acetyltransferase identical to the one of plasmid pip501 of streptococcus agalactiae. erythromycin resistance is due to a 23s ribosomal rna methyl transferase, again as found in pip501 (ermb). the aminoglycoside resistance genes are packed in tandem as in transposon tn5405 of staphylococcus aureus: an aminoglycoside 6-adenyltransferase, a streptothricin acetyl transferase, and an aminoglycoside phosphotransferase.). identical resistance genes are known from pathogens like streptococcus pyogenes, s. agalactiae, s. aureus, campylobacter coli, clostridium perfringens, and clostridium difficile. pre25 is composed of a 30.5-kbp segment almost identical to pip501. of the 15 genes involved in conjugative transfer, 10 codes for putative transmembrane proteins (e.g. trsb, trac, trsf, trsj, and trsl). the enterococcal part is joined into the pip501 part by insertion elements is1216v of e. faecium tn1545 (three copies), and homologs of is1062 (e. faecalis) and is1485 (e. faecium). pre25 demonstrates that enterococci from fermented food do participate in the molecular communication between gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria of the human and animal microflora.

TI  == epidemiology and antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria causing skin and soft tissue infections in the usa and europe: a guide to appropriate antimicrobial therapy.
AB  == susceptibility data for all organisms associated with a range of skin and soft tissue infections (ssti) in hospitalised patients were studied. data were reported by clinical laboratories in the usa, france, germany, italy and spain during 2001 which participate in the surveillance network (tsn). staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus spp. and coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns), escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa were the most prevalent pathogens in all countries. mrsa was detected in 44.4, 34.7, 12.4, 41.8 and 32. 4% of s. aureus in each country, respectively. the majority of mrsa were cross resistant to other compound classes tested except for vancomycin (100% susceptible) trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole with range 1.7% (france) to 15.9% (italy) resistant, and gentamicin with range 12.2% (france) to 87.0% (italy) resistant. more than 99.0% of mssa tested susceptible to ceftriaxone and >94.9% to trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole. 87.2% (france) to 94.6% of mssa (germany) were ciprofloxacin susceptible; 73.2% (usa) to 86.6% (spain) were erythromycin susceptible; 85.4% (italy) to 99.2% (france) were gentamicin susceptible. mssa were more frequently found and generally more antibiotic susceptible from out patients. overall, 100% of streptococcus agalactiae and streptococcus pyogenes were susceptible to penicillin, ceftriaxone and cefotaxime. macrolide resistance  was common among s. agalactiae (20.7%, germany to 10%, italy and spain), s. pyogenes (19.2%, france to 11.1%, usa) and viridans streptococci (25.7%, france to 14.1%, germany). vancomycin-resistant enterococcus spp. were uncommon outside  the usa (17.5%) and italy (7.4%). for all countries susceptibility of e. coli was 100% to imipenem, >98.7% to amikacin, >96.0% to ceftriaxone and cefotaxime. susceptibility of e. coli isolates to ciprofloxacin was 77.6% in spain to 94.3% in germany. klebsiella spp., proteus spp., citrobacter spp. and enterobacter spp. displayed varying susceptibilities between countries to drugs tested. putative extended spectrum beta-lactamase expression in e. coli remained rare comprising 4-5% of isolates in usa, italy and spain and in france and germany <2%. for p. aeruginosa piperacillin-tazobactam, amikacin, imipenem and ceftazidime were the most active compounds tested irrespective of region. surveillance data should be  considered when selecting empirical therapy for treating ssti.

AB  == we examined antibacterial activities of 4 kinds of macrolides, erythromycin (em), clarithromycin (cam), azithromycin (azm) and rokitamycin (rkm), against 6 bacterial species of clinical strains isoleted in 2002. bacterial isolates used were each 50 strains of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa), streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae and 43 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae. s. agalactiae were derived from gynecological samples, and other species were isolated from respiratory specimens. antimicrobial activities against s. aureus,  s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, m. catarrhalis and h. influenzae of 14-membered macrolides, such as em and cam, were higher than those of 16-membered macrolide,  rkm. by contrast, against s. pneumoniae, rkm was more effective than 14-membered  macrolides. six, three and four strains of s. aureus, s. pyogenes and s. agalactiae, respectively, were resistant to macrolides. thirty-five among 43 pneumococcal isolates were resistant, and 15 of the 35 were highly-resistant, mic of > 128 micrograms/ml, to any one of em, cam or azm. isolation frequency of resistant strains to rkm was lower than those to 14- and 15-membered macrolides:  only one strain was highly-resistant and 12 were intermediately-resistant. no resistant strain was recognized in m. catarrhalis and h. influenzae. further, we  analyzed the resistant mechanisms, methylation or efflux, of macrolide resistant  strains by the double-disk method. methylation was major mechanism in s. aureus,  and in s. pyogenes, all of the resistance was caused by methylation. in s. agalactiae and s. pneumoniae, methylation and efflux shared about half and half.

TI  == small-fragment genomic libraries for the display of putative epitopes from clinically significant pathogens.
AB  == taking advantage of whole genome sequences of bacterial pathogens in many thriving diseases with global impact, we developed a comprehensive screening procedure for the identification of putative vaccine candidate antigens. importantly, this procedure relies on highly representative small-fragment genomic libraries that are expressed to display frame-selected epitope-size peptides on a bacterial cell surface and to interact directly with carefully selected disease-relevant high-titer sera. here we describe the generation of small-fragment genomic libraries of gram-positive and gram-negative clinically significant pathogens, including staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, and streptococcus  pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, helicobacter pylori, chlamydia pneumoniae, the enterotoxigenic escherichia coli, and campylobacter jejuni. large-scale sequencing revealed that the libraries, which provide an average of 20-fold coverage, were random and, as demonstrated with two s. aureus libraries, highly representative. consistent with the comprehensive nature of this approach is the  identification of epitopes that reside in both annotated and putatively novel open reading frames. the use of these libraries therefore allows for the rapid and direct identification of immunogenic epitopes with no apparent bias or difficulty that often associate with conventional expression methods.

TI  == bulk tank milk analysis: factors associated with appearance of mycoplasma sp. in  milk.
AB  == factors associated with the presence of mycoplasma sp. in bulk tank milk samples  were evaluated from 664 herds during 2.25 years. milk quality components were not strongly related to the presence of mycoplasma sp. in bulk tank milk. the presence of other contagious mastitis pathogens, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus agalactiae, was also not related to the presence of mycoplasma, suggesting that the aetiology and transmission of mycoplasma mastitis were different from transmission of other contagious mastitis pathogens. the occurrence of the first isolation of mycoplasma from a bulk tank was not correlated to season of the year. mycoplasma in bulk tank milk samples were more  likely to be found in herds shipping more milk, an indirect measure of herd size. this suggests that larger herds are more likely to have mycoplasma mastitis. however, the first appearance of mycoplasma mastitis in a bulk tank sample was followed by a sample without this pathogen in more than 60% of herds. mycoplasma  sp. was not detected in any herd a year after first isolation. these findings suggest that this pathogen could be controlled and eliminated from herds.

AB  == effective diagnostic tools for screening herds for mastitis pathogens are important in development and monitoring of mastitis control programmes. a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay for simultaneous detection of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus dysgalactiae and streptococcus uberis was used in preliminary studies to assess its applicability  as an alternative method for monitoring mastitis caused by these organisms at the herd level. pcr was used to detect the presence of these organisms in bulk milk samples. correlations with bulk milk somatic cell counts (bmcc), total bacteria counts and thermoduric bacteria counts were evaluated. a total of 176 bulk milk samples were collected from 42 herds on five consecutive occasions at approx. 10-d intervals. str. uberis was the most common organism in these bulk milk samples. there was no relationship between presence of either staph. aureus, str. dysgalactiae or str. uberis and bmcc, total bacteria counts or thermoduric bacteria counts. however, presence of str. agalactiae was associated with high bmcc and total bacteria counts. the results of this study show that regular analysis of bulk milk using this multiplex pcr assay may be a useful tool for monitoring herd status with respect to str. agalactiae, but is of less value for  monitoring occurrence of staph. aureus, str. dysgalactiae and str. uberis. further investigations are needed to clarify the relationship between positive pcr results and the prevalence of infected cows in the herd.

TI  == vaginal bacterial flora activates rat peritoneal mast cells.
AB  == sixteen strains of physiological and pathological vaginal bacteria were tested for their ability to secrete histamine from rat peritoneal mast cells in vitro. we noticed that mycoplasma hominis-induced histamine release was very high (up to 53.6%). the stimulation of rat mast cells with staphylococccus cohnii, staphylococcus coagulase(-) (two strains), ureaplasma urealyticum, peptostreptococcus spp., bacteroides capillosus, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus agalactiae resulted in lower but significant histamine secretion (11.2%-17.5%). other bacteria strains (staphylococcus epidermidids, enterococcus  faecalis, escherichia coli, actinomyces naeslundii (two strains) and lactobacillus fermentum (two strains) caused very low (4.2% - 8.8%) histamine release.

TI  == in vitro activity of ertapenem against common clinical isolates in relation to human pharmacokinetics.
AB  == the in vitro activity of ertapenem against bacterial pathogens isolated from patients with moderate to severe complicated intra-abdominal, complicated skin/skin structure, acute pelvic, or complicated urinary tract infection or community acquired pneumonia was compared to ceftriaxone and piperacillin-tazobactam and related to known plasma concentrations of the three agents. ertapenem was more potent against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus  aureus (mssa) than ceftriaxone and piperacillin-tazobactam and was more potent and more active than both of these agents against enterobacteriaceae and anaerobes. piperacillin-tazobactam was the most active agent against enterococci  and pseudomonas aeruginosa. all isolates of enterobacteriaceae (n=1088), streptococcus pyogenes (n=37), streptococcus agalactiae (n=48), mssa (n=187), haemophilus influenzae (n=59), and moraxella catarrhalis (n=9) were susceptible to ertapenem; < 1% of 1284 anaerobes and only 1 of 113 streptococcus pneumoniae (a penicillin-resistant isolate) were resistant to ertapenem. the mic value at which 90% of all enterobacteriaceae, streptococci, mssa, h. influenzae, m. catarrhalis, and anaerobes were inhibited (mic90) was < or = 1 microg/ml and below the mean plasma concentration of total ertapenem following a 1 g intravenous infusion for at least 24 hours, i.e., the entire recommended dosing interval, and below the free drug concentration for at least 8 h.

TI  == quarter milk somatic cell count in infected dairy cows: a meta-analysis.
AB  == the aim of this paper was to evaluate the effects associated with intramammary infection (imi) by a bacterium or a group of bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus dysgalactiae, streptococcus uberis, coliforms, staphylococci other than s. aureus, and corynebacterium bovis) on the  somatic cell count (scc) in quarter milk of dairy cows. papers selected for analysis had to provide scc values associated with the natural infection in quarters by different bacteria. sampling for measurement of scc and determination of the infection had to be done on the same day. only papers published in english or in french after 1971 were considered. twenty-one papers fulfilled the selection criteria. the animals sampled, the measurement techniques for scc and the bacteriological identification, as well as the definition of the infection, all differed widely among the selected studies. the meta-analysis method was used to estimate both the mean scc (arithmetic and geometric) value and the average increase on scc of each type of infection. the geometric mean scc in bacteriologically negative quarters was 68 000 c/ml. in case of imi, the retained scc was 357 000, 857 000, 547 000, 1 024 000, 1 151 000, 138 000 and 105 000 c/ml in quarters infected by staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus dysgalactiae, streptococcus uberis, coliforms, staphylococci other  than s. aureus and corynebacterium bovis, respectively. the variation factors that could influence these scc values and the bacteriological results are discussed.

TI  == field validation of a milk line sampling device for monitoring milk quality and udder health.
AB  == the objective of this study was to investigate the ability of a milk line sampling device to obtain a representative sample by comparing scc and bacterial  culture results between milk line and bulk tank samples for milk harvested from the same group of cows at the same milking. a total of 42 paired milk line and bulk tank samples were collected at separate milking events from 21 different herds. concordance correlation coefficients showed a high level of agreement between the two sample types, with values ranging between 0.74 and 0.99 for all parameters and bacterial species measured. anova showed that scc and bacterial culture results for streptococcus agalactiae, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus non-agalactiae, coliforms, and coagulase-negative staphylococci were neither numerically or statistically different between milk line and bulk tank samples. kappa analysis showed that overall agreement beyond chance between  milk line and bulk tank samples in determining whether a herd was positive or negative for either strep. agalactiae or staph. aureus were 100 and 75%, respectively. while further research is needed to fully assess the utility of this tool for the purpose of bacterial culture, the results of this study suggest that the strategy of milk line sampling is a very promising monitoring tool. this sampling strategy should provide producers with inexpensive and timely information that will help to improve programs for monitoring milk quality and udder health in commercial dairy herds.

TI  == microbiological quality and somatic cell count of ewe milk with special reference to staphylococci.
AB  == a total 1502 useful half udders of 762 churra ewes from eight herds were aseptically sampled in midlactation to study both the bacteriological isolates and the scc of milk. corynebacteria, enterococci, micrococci, staphylococci, and  streptococci represented 11.2, 2.9, 1.4, 78.9, and 3.1% of all isolates, respectively. within staphylococci, novobiocin-sensitive species (71.1%) were much more frequently isolated than novobiocin-resistant ones (7.8%). staphylococcus epidermidis was the most prevalent species (53.2% of the isolates). log scc of uninfected half udder milk was 4.86. isolates of novobiocin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci, micrococci, and corynebacteria were associated to low values of log scc (4.85 to 5.20). in contrast, infection by novobiocin-sensitive coagulase-negative staphylococci, streptococci, and enterococci organisms was related to a sharp inflammatory response with log scc means between 5.92 and 6.32. the species that showed the highest log scc were pasteurella haemolytica (7.62), streptococcus agalactiae (7.28), and staphylococcus aureus (6.68). high prevalence of infections by novobiocin-sensitive staphylococci together with high scc related to such infections show a relevant role of these organisms in ewe mastitis. consequently, implementation of staphylococcal mastitis control programs would be of great interest in dairy ewe herds to improve microbiological and hygienic quality of milk.

TI  == trends in antibacterial susceptibility of mastitis pathogens during a seven-year  period.
AB  == milk samples collected from dairy cattle suspected of having mastitis were submitted to the microbiology laboratory of the animal health diagnostic laboratory, michigan state university, for bacteriologic culture. a total of 2778 isolates, from the years 1994 to 2000, were isolated, identified, and subjected to in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility testing using the disk diffusion method, in accordance with national committee on clinical laboratory standards (nccls) standards. isolates included in this study were streptococcus uberis, streptococcus dysgalactiae, streptococcus agalactiae, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcesens, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the proportion of bacterial isolates determined to be susceptible did not change during the 7-yr period for the majority of bacterial-antibacterial interactions tested. however, analysis for linear trend in proportions determined that there were increases in the proportion of s. aureus isolates that were susceptible to ampicillin, penicillin, and erythromycin. for strep. uberis, increases in the proportion of susceptible isolates occurred for oxacillin, sulfa-trimethoprim, gentamicin, and pirlimycin, and a decrease in the proportion  of susceptible isolates occurred with penicillin. for strep. dysgalactiae, increases in the proportion of susceptible isolates occurred with erythromycin, gentamicin, sulfa-trimethoprim, and tetracycline. for strep. agalactiae, increases in the proportion of susceptible isolates occurred with sulfa-trimethoprim. among e. coli isolates, there was an increase in the proportion that were susceptible to ampicillin and cephalothin. among k pneumoniae isolates, there was an increase in the proportion that were susceptible to ceftiofur. overall, there was no indication of increased resistance of mastitis isolates to antibacterials that are commonly used in dairy cattle.

TI  == the effect of temperature on bactericidal properties of 10% povidone-iodine solution.
AB  == objective: ten percent povidone-iodine (pvi) is commonly used as a bactericidal solution before amniocentesis is performed. warming pvi may increase patient comfort; however, the effect of warming on its bactericidal properties is not known. the objective of this study was to determine the effect of warming 10% pvi on its bactericidal properties. study design: room temperature of pvi was 25 degrees c, and temperature in an ultrasonic gel warmer was 32 degrees c. in vitro experiments were conducted in 25 degrees c and 32 degrees c water baths. nine milliliters of pvi at each temperature was added to 1 ml of bacteria (10(7) organisms/ml staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus species, escherichia coli, group b streptococcus). after 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 8 minutes, 1-ml samples were removed and added to 4 ml of 0.5% sodium thiosulfate (to neutralize the iodine and interrupt bactericidal action). the number of viable organisms was determined by plating 0.1-ml samples on trypticase soy agar plates. plates were incubated at 37 degrees c for 24 hours and colony-forming units (cfus) were counted. for in vivo experiments in 40 volunteers, a 9-cm2 area of the dorsum of each hand was wiped with a sterile cotton swab to obtain a sample of bacteria for culture. the  area was then wiped for 15 seconds with pvi at 25 degrees c or 32 degrees c and recultured. the bactericidal properties of pvi at each temperature were compared. the mann-whitney u test was used as appropriate, and p <.05 was considered significant. results: in vitro, pvi was bactericidal against e coli, s aureus, enterococcus species, and group b streptococcus within 0.25 minutes at both 25 degrees c and 32 degrees c, with median bacterial growth of 0 cfu/plate for each  species of bacteria studied (3 replicates at each temperature). median bacterial  growth from skin was 4 cfu/plate (range, 0 to >100). after hands were wiped with  pvi at 25 degrees c and 32 degrees c, median bacterial growth was 0 cfu/plate (range, 0-8) and 0 cfu/plate (range, 0-15), respectively (not significant). conclusion: pvi is as effective at 32 degrees c as it is at 25 degrees c. use of  pvi at 32 degrees c should be considered to increase patient comfort in procedures performed without the use of anesthetics.

TI  == biofilm bacteria: formation and comparative susceptibility to antibiotics.
AB  == the calgary biofilm device (cbd) was used to form bacterial biofilms of selected  veterinary gram-negative and gram-positive pathogenic bacteria from cattle, sheep, pigs, chicken, and turkeys. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum biofilm eradication concentration (mbec) of ampicillin, ceftiofur, cloxacillin, oxytetracycline, penicillin g, streptomycin, tetracycline, enrofloxacin, erythromycin, gentamicin, tilmicosin, and trimethoprim-sulfadoxine  for gram-positive and -negative bacteria were determined. bacterial biofilms were readily formed on the cbd under selected conditions. the biofilms consisted of micro-colonies encased in extracellular polysaccharide material. biofilms composed of arcanobacterium (actinomyces) pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus hyicus, streptococcus agalactiae, corynebacterium renale, or corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis were not killed by the antibiotics tested but  as planktonic bacteria they were sensitive at low concentrations. biofilm and planktonic streptococcus dysgalactiae and streptococcus suis were sensitive to penicillin, ceftiofur, cloxacillin, ampicillin, and oxytetracycline. planktonic escherichia coli were sensitive to enrofloxacin, gentamicin, oxytetracycline and  trimethoprim/ sulfadoxine. enrofloxacin and gentamicin were the most effective antibiotics against e. coli growing as a biofilm. salmonella spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates growing as planktonic populations were sensitive to enrofloxacin, gentamicin, ampicillin, oxytetracycline, and trimethoprim/sulfadoxine, but as a biofilm, these bacteria were only sensitive to enrofloxacin. planktonic and biofilm pasteurella multocida and mannheimia haemolytica had similar antibiotic sensitivity profiles and were sensitive to most of the antibiotics tested. the cbd provides a valuable new technology that can be used to select antibiotics that are able to kill bacteria growing as biofilms.

TI  == effect of preculture freezing and incubation on bacteriological isolation from subclinical mastitis samples.
AB  == in this study the sensitivity of three methods of isolation of udder pathogens from milk samples from subclinical mastitis cases was compared. for analysis 1827 quarter milk samples were selected. milk was cultured using a standard culture technique (0.01 ml of fresh milk streaked on a sheep blood agar plate and on edward's medium). in addition, an inoculum of 0.01 ml of the original milk sample was incubated for 24h at 37 degrees c in broth, followed by culture using the standard culture technique. in the third method, the whole milk sample was frozen for 24h, and then incubated for 24h at 37 degrees c, followed by culture using standard culture technique. the isolation percentage of staphylococcus aureus was 4.7% for standard culture technique, 14.2% for incubation in broth, and 21.5% for the combination of freezing plus incubation. isolation percentage of streptococcus dysgalactiae and streptococcus agalactiae was highest using the standard culture technique, while isolation rate of streptococcus uberis was not  different among the three methods used. with increasing somatic cell count, the likelihood of s. aureus, s. dysgalactiae and s. uberis isolation increased. based on the relative sensitivity, defined as the isolation rate using a single technique compared to the isolation rate of the three techniques together, a combination of standard culture technique and freezing plus incubation was most attractive for achieving a high isolation rate of s. agalactiae and s. dysgalactiae. relative sensitivity of s. uberis isolation was highest using the standard culture technique and incubation in broth, while s. aureus was most often isolated using a combination of incubation in broth and freezing plus incubation. a combination of the three methods increased the isolation rate for s. dysgalactiae, s. uberis and s. aureus. the standard culture technique, together with the combination of freezing plus incubation, can be recommended for isolating major udder pathogens. if s. aureus is the pathogen of main interest, using incubation in broth together with the combination of freezing plus incubation performed best.

TI  == definition of a type of abnormal vaginal flora that is distinct from bacterial vaginosis: aerobic vaginitis.
AB  == objective: to define an entity of abnormal vaginal flora: aerobic vaginitis. design: observational study. setting: university hospital gasthuisberg, leuven, belgium. sample: 631 women attending for routine prenatal care or attending vaginitis clinic. methods: samples were taken for fresh wet mount microscopy of vaginal fluid, vaginal cultures and measurement of lactate, succinate and cytokine levels in vaginal fluid. smears deficient in lactobacilli and positive for clue cells were considered to indicate a diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis. aerobic vaginitis was diagnosed if smears were deficient in lactobacilli, positive for cocci or coarse bacilli, positive for parabasal epithelial cells, and/or positive for vaginal leucocytes (plus their granular aspect). results: genital complaints include red inflammation, yellow discharge, vaginal dyspareunia. group b streptococci, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus and trichomonas vaginalis are frequently cultured. vaginal lactate concentration is severely depressed in women with aerobic vaginitis, as in bacterial vaginosis, but vaginal succinate is not produced. also in contrast to bacterial vaginosis, aerobic vaginitis produces a host immune response that leads to high production of interleukin-6, interleukin-1-beta and leukaemia inhibitory factor in the vaginal fluid. conclusion: aerobic vaginitis is associated with aerobic micro-organisms, mainly group b streptococci and e. coli. its characteristics are different from those of bacterial vaginosis and elicit an important host response. the most severe form of aerobic vaginitis equals desquamative inflammatory vaginitis. in theory, aerobic vaginitis may be a better candidate than bacterial vaginosis as the cause of pregnancy complications, such as ascending chorioamnionitis, preterm rupture of the membranes and preterm delivery.

TI  == in vitro antagonistic effect of lactobacillus on organisms associated with bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == objective: to assess antagonistic properties of lactobacillus strains isolated from the vaginas of healthy women as compared to the most common bacterial agents related to vaginosis. study design: antagonistic activity of different lactobacillus strains isolated from the vaginas of healthy women not treated for  infections with an antibiotic for the previous three months was screened using an agar slab method. the activity was tested against test organisms associated with  bacterial vaginosis and/or urinary tract infections: staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, gardnerella vaginalis, peptostreptococcus anaerobius and prevotella bivia. results: many of the 146 lactobacillus strains tested exerted apparent antagonistic activities against gram-positive aerobic cocci and gram-negative rods, such as s aureus and  e coli, and a marked number of lactobacillus strains inhibited facultative bacteria, such as gardnerella vaginalis and the anaerobes p anaerobius and p bivia. only a few lactobacilli were able to inhibit growth of e faecalis and s agalactiae. indicator bacteria growth inhibition probably relies upon several different complementary mechanisms. the specific indicator bacteria species determines which mechanism predominates. conclusion: lactobacillus strains taken  from normal vaginal flora demonstrated antagonistic activity against a variety of bacteria related to vaginal and urinary tract infections. the specific occurrence rates of active lactobacillus strains are different, and this difference is dependent on the indicator bacteria species.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of everninomicin against clinical isolates of enterococcus spp., staphylococcus spp., and streptococcus spp. tested by etest.
AB  == the in-vitro antimicrobial activity of everninomicin, a novel oligosaccharide antibiotic, was tested against clinical isolates of 11 methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa) strains, 11 methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) strains, 22 staphylococcus epidermidis strains, 23 enterococcus faecalis strains, 23 enterococcus faecium strains, 23 enterococcus avium strains, 27 streptococcus  pneumoniae strains, 22 streptococcus pyogenes strains, and 20 streptococcus agalactiae strains. the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of everninomicin were determined by etest and compared with those of vancomycin, teicoplanin, and  minocycline. the etest showed that everninomicin exhibited excellent activity (mic, <0.016 to 1.5 microg/ml) against the gram-positive cocci tested. the antimicrobial activity of everninomicin against s. aureus and s. epidermidis was  stronger than that of vancomycin, teicoplanin, and minocycline, in particular against mrsa, with an mic50 of 0.38 microg/ml and an mic90 of 0.5 microg/ml. against strains of enterococci and streptococci, everninomicin was more active than vancomycin, but as active as teicoplanin.

TI  == sample preparation of gram-positive bacteria for identification by matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight.
AB  == a new sample preparation method was developed for fresh, whole-cell gram-positive bacteria to be analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi tof ms). with fresh, whole-cell gram-negative bacteria of the enterobacteriaceae family, we had previously achieved spectra consisting of >50 peaks and mass ranges of 2-25 kda. because similar spectral quantity could not be achieved for gram-positive bacteria, using this same protocol, we investigated an alternative approach that focuses on the thick peptidoglycan layer of the cell wall. gram-positive bacteria were incubated with 0.05-0.5 mg/ml lysozyme for 30 min prior to being analyzed by maldi tof ms.  lysozyme is an enzymatically stable, 14-kda protein that specifically cleaves between peptidoglycan disaccharide subunits. a significant increase in overall number of peaks (>50) in the 2-14 kda range was observed without interference from the presence of lysozyme. we show that for four different species (staphylococcus aureus, s. haemolyticus, streptococcus pyogenes, and s. agalactiae) reproducible subset of peaks were found within spectra from a reference strain and two unrelated clinical isolates. the data suggests that this sample preparation may be useful for increasing the overall number of peaks within spectra for subsequent development of bacterial identification strategies.

TI  == production of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines of human placental trophoblasts in response to pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == objective: we studied the production of cytokines in purified cultures of human term trophoblasts in the presence of pathogenic strains of escherichia coli, bacteroides fragilis, mycoplasma hominis, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus agalactiae, which have been identified in intrauterine infections.  methods: human villous trophoblasts were isolated from term placentas after cesarean section and purified by several steps. after 6, 12, and 24 hours of incubation with the different heat-inactivated bacteria, interleukin-1beta (il-1beta), interleukin-6 (il-6), interleukin-8 (il-8), and interleukin-10 (il-10) as well as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) were measured from supernatants by commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. expression of cytokine mrnas was determined by semiquantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr). results: in nonstimulated cultures, low (il-1beta and tnf-alpha) and high (il-6, il-8, and il-10) basal secretion of cytokines was detectable. the pathogenic microorganisms induced a dose- and time-dependent release of il-1beta, il-6, il-8, and il-10, whereas tnf-alpha secretion was not elevated. e coli was the most potent inducer followed by b fragilis, s agalactiae, s aureus, and m hominis. transcripts encoding il-1beta, il-6, il-8, or il-10 were elevated in the rt-pcr reactions, suggesting  that transcriptional mechanisms contribute to elevated cytokine expression. conclusion: pathogenic microorganisms stimulated mrna expression and polypeptide  release of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines from placental trophoblasts. induction of both inflammation-promoting and inflammation-inhibiting cytokines by bacterial products could play a role in modulating the inflammatory response associated with chorioamnionitis.

TI  == sequence of the 50-kb conjugative multiresistance plasmid pre25 from enterococcus faecalis re25.
AB  == the complete 50,237-bp dna sequence of the conjugative and mobilizing multiresistance plasmid pre25 from enterococcus faecalis re25 was determined. the plasmid had 58 putative open reading frames, 5 of which encode resistance to 12 antimicrobials. chloramphenicol acetyltransferase and the 23s rna methylase are identical to gene products of the broad-host-range plasmid pip501 from streptococcus agalactiae. in addition, a 30.5-kb segment is almost identical to pip501. genes encoding an aminoglycoside 6-adenylyltransferase, a streptothricin  acetyltransferase, and an aminoglycoside phosphotransferase are arranged in tandem on a 7.4-kb fragment as previously reported in tn5405 from staphylococcus  aureus and in pjh1 from e. faecalis. one interrupted and five complete is elements as well as three replication genes were also identified. pre25 was transferred by conjugation to e. faecalis, listeria innocua, and lactococcus lactis by means of a transfer region that appears similar to that of pip501. it is concluded that pre25 may contribute to the further spread of antibiotic-resistant microorganisms via food into the human community.

TI  == the in vitro activity of daptomycin against 514 gram-positive aerobic clinical isolates.
AB  == the in vitro activity of daptomycin was assessed in comparison with that of vancomycin and penicillin against a wide range of gram-positive aerobic clinical  isolates. mics were determined by an agar dilution method on mueller-hinton agar  (nccls/eucast) and on isotonic agar adjusted to contain 50 mg/l free calcium (bsac). both media were enriched with 5% horse blood for fastidious organisms. daptomycin mics for all 172 staphylococci, including methicillin-susceptible and  methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus haemolyticus, were 0.03-0.5 mg/l. for 99 of the 100 enterococci (enterococcus faecalis, n = 50; enterococcus faecium, n = 50), including 37 vancomycin-resistant isolates, they were 0.25-2 mg/l. for all 108 beta-haemolytic streptococci, including streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus agalactiae, daptomycin mics were 0.016- 0.25 mg/l; for 101 alpha-haemolytic streptococci, including streptococcus pneumoniae and 'viridans' streptococci, they were 0.016-2 mg/l. for miscellaneous vancomycin-resistant isolates including lactobacillus spp., lactococcus spp., leuconostoc spp., pediococcus spp. and isolates of enterococcus casseliflavus and enterococcus gallinarum, daptomycin mics were 0.03-2 mg/l; mics for the seven isolates of listeria monocytogenes were 0.25-4 mg/l. there was little difference between the results on mueller-hinton agar and  on supplemented isotonic agar the discrepant results occasionally obtained tended to be one dilution higher on supplemented isotonic agar. daptomycin was active (mics < or = 2 mg/l) against all the isolates tested with the exception of one isolate each of e. faecium and l. monocytogenes (mics = 4 mg/l). our results indicate that daptomycin mics are independent of methicillin and vancomycin mics.

TI  == development of a rapid and sensitive test for identification of major pathogens in bovine mastitis by pcr.
AB  == bovine mastitis is the most important source of loss for the dairy industry. a rapid and specific test for the detection of the main pathogens of bovine mastitis is not actually available. molecular probes reacting in pcr with bacterial dna from bovine milk, providing direct and rapid detection of escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus  dysgalactiae, streptococcus parauberis, and streptococcus uberis, have been developed. two sets of specific primers were designed for each of these microorganisms and appeared to discriminate close phylogenic bacterial species (e.g., s. agalactiae and s. dysgalactiae). in addition, two sets of universal primers were designed to react as positive controls with all major pathogens of bovine mastitis. the sensitivities of the test using s. aureus dna extracted from milk with and without a pre-pcr enzymatic lysis step of bacterial cells were compared. the detection limit of the assay was 3.125 x 10(2) cfu/ml of milk when  s. aureus dna was extracted with the pre-pcr enzymatic step compared to 5 x 10(3) cfu/ml of milk in the absence of the pre-pcr enzymatic step. this latter threshold of sensitivity is still compatible with its use as an efficient tool of diagnosis in bovine mastitis, allowing the elimination of expensive reagents. the two pcr tests avoid cumbersome and lengthy cultivation steps, can be performed within hours, and are sensitive, specific, and reliable for the direct detection  in milk of the six most prevalent bacteria causing bovine mastitis.

AB  == to improve diagnosis of mastitis in dairy cattle, a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay was developed for the simultaneous detection of the four major bacterial causes of bovine mastitis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus dysgalactiae, and streptococcus uberis. the target sequence was the 16s to 23s rrna spacer regions. the performance of the assay was examined with 117 milk samples collected from a subclinically infected herd, and  the diagnostic specificities and sensitivities of the multiplex pcr were compared with conventional culture. pcr was significantly more sensitive than culture for  detection of s. aureus and s. uberis, but there were no significant differences in sensitivities between pcr and culture for the detection of s. agalactiae and s. dysgalactiae. the results suggest that this multiplex pcr assay could be used  as an alternative method in routine diagnosis for rapid, sensitive, and specific  simultaneous detection of s. aureus, s. agalactiae, s. dysgalactiae, and s. uberis in milk samples.

TI  == the major bovine mastitis pathogens have different cell tropisms in cultures of bovine mammary gland cells.
AB  == we previously showed that staphylococcus aureus cells adhered mainly to an elongated cell type, present in cultures of bovine mammary gland cells. moreover, we showed that this adhesion was mediated by binding to fibronectin. the same in  vitro model was used here, to study adhesion of other important mastitis pathogens. like the s. aureus strains, the streptococcus dysgalactiae strains adhered mainly to elongated cells, which seemed to be mediated by fibronectin binding. in contrast, streptococcus uberis strains adhered mainly to cubic cells. since the cubic cells did not express fibronectin and s. uberis cells bound fibronectin less efficiently, the adhesion of s. uberis cells was independent of  fibronectin binding. streptococcus agalactiae strains adhered poorly to both cell types. the specificity and efficiency of adhesion of escherichia coli strains was strongly strain dependent. none of the s. agalactiae and e. coli strains tested was able to bind fibronectin efficiently. the results suggest that the different  mastitis pathogens have different target cell specificities and use different mechanisms to adhere to cells of the bovine mammary gland.

AB  == staphylococcus aureus ab201, a clinical isolate from wound pus, produced a bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance termed as bac201, that was inhibitory to streptococcus agalactiae, enterococcus faecalis, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, neisseria meningitidis and a number of staphylococcal species. it was purified to homogeneity by ammonium sulfate precipitation, gel filtration (biosil-sec-125), and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (vydac c4). the native  bac201 was sized at approximately 170-kda as determined by gf hplc. fraction-i (native bac201), having antibacterial activity was also examined by transmission  electron microscopy and appeared as globular structure showing resemblance with phage-like objects. the purification of bac201 resulted in 466-fold increase in specific activity and recovery of 0.94% of total antibacterial activity. the purified bac201 migrated as single band on sds-page with an estimated molecular mass of about 41-kda. bac201 was sensitive to proteolytic enzymes, resistant to heat and organic solvents, and active over a wide range of ph (2.5-10). the amino acid composition revealed a general resemblance with other reported high molecular mass bacteriocins and predominance of glycine (39%), proline (13%) and  alanine (8%) residues. further results showed that bac201 has a bactericidal effect on sensitive cells which is not produced by either cell lysis or apparent  loss of membrane permeability.

TI  == antibacterial properties of human amnion and chorion in vitro.
AB  == objective: the purpose of the present study was to explore the direct effects of  amnion and chorion on bacterial growth in vitro including the antibacterial spectrum. chorioamniotic membranes were obtained under sterile conditions from 13 healthy women undergoing elective cesarean section at term. likewise, chorioamniotic membranes were obtained from 10 healthy women with spontaneous vaginal delivery at term. five strains of hemolytic streptococci group b (gbs) were tested and one clinical isolate of the following species or bacterial groups: hemolytic streptococcus group a, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus saprophyticus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter calcoaceticus and lactobacillus species. bacteriological media included (1) blood-agar medium; (2) a transparent agar medium for submerged cultures; and (3) a nutrient broth medium. results: an inhibitory effect of fetal membranes against a range of bacteria was found. consistent results were obtained in experiments with cultures on agar and cultures suspended in agar (membranes from eight women in both studies). in experiments with liquid cultures (seven women) only chorion showed a marginal inhibitory effect. all strains were inhibited, but the most pronounced inhibition was obtained for streptococcus group a, s. aureus and s. saprophyticus by both chorion and amnion. conclusion: this study demonstrated an inhibitory effect of the fetal membranes on a diverse  panel of bacteria

TI  == efficacies of chlorine dioxide and lodophor teat dips during experimental challenge with staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus agalactiae.
AB  == we tested two postmilking teat dips for efficacy against staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus agalactiae using experimental challenge procedures recommended  by the national mastitis council. the chlorine dioxide teat dip that contained 0.7% sodium chlorite reduced the number of new intramammary infections (imi) caused by staph. aureus by 86.6% and reduced new imi caused by strep. agalactiae  by 88.4%. the 0.5% iodophor teat dip reduced the number of new imi caused by staph. aureus by 92.9% and reduced the number of new imi caused by strep. agalactiae by 43.4%. teat skin and teat end conditions were evaluated before and  after the study, and no deleterious effects were noted among dipped quarters compared with undipped control quarters for either teat dip.

TI  == spinal epidural abscesses in children: a 15-year experience and review of the literature.
AB  == we reviewed medical records and laboratory and diagnostic evaluations for 8 pediatric patients with spinal epidural abscesses who were treated during the last 15 years at our institution. staphylococcus aureus was isolated from 5 of 8  epidural abscesses, including 2 abscesses with methicillin-resistant s. aureus. unusual isolates were group b streptococcus in a patient with chronic vesicouretral reflux associated with the posterior urethral valves and aspergillus flavus in a patient with acute myelogenous leukemia. an analysis incorporating our results and a review of the english-language literature about abscesses in children and adults revealed differences related to age. abscesses in children were more posterior in epidural location, had greater spinal column extension, and were associated with more favorable clinical outcomes than were abscesses in adults. magnetic resonance imaging is the diagnostic procedure of choice; however, radionuclide bone scans should be considered for associated distant osteomyelitis in children. prompt diagnosis and combined medical and surgical treatment remain the cornerstones for the prevention of adverse outcomes.

AB  == we investigated activity of piperacillin (pipc) in comparison with 8 antibacterial reference drugs against several fresh clinical strains isolated from patients with infectious diseases in the respiratory tract and after surgical interventions in 1999. the following results were obtained: 1. pipc had  its mic90 of 0.12-6 micrograms/ml in gram-positive bacteria (methicillin susceptible staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis) and showed its mic of 1 microgram/ml or higher in 9 possible prsp strains out of 38 isolates of s. pneumoniae but there were no possible isolates with evident resistance in other species of bacteria. 2. pipc showed favorable antibacterial activities as its mic90 were 2-8 micrograms/ml in gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, citrobacter freundii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae), except for p. mirabilis in which its mic90  was as high as 64 micrograms/ml. 11 out of 39 isolates of p. mirabilis were resistant to other drugs such as pipc, abpc, ctm and czop. 3. pipc had its mic90  of > 128 micrograms/ml in bacteroides fragilis. from these results, pipc was considered highly effective in several infections in view of maintaining its favorable antibacterial activities in several causative bacteria even today when  20 years had passed since its first application to clinical practice.

TI  == influence of modified natural or synthetic surfactant preparations on growth of bacteria causing infections in the neonatal period.
AB  == connatal bacterial pneumonia is common in neonates. animal studies and initial clinical reports indicate that surfactant dysfunction is involved in the pathophysiology of severe neonatal pneumonia. since respiratory distress syndrome and connatal pneumonia may be difficult to differentiate in the first hours of life, neonates with respiratory failure due to bacterial infections might receive surfactant. under such conditions surfactant components might be catabolized by bacteria and promote bacterial growth. we therefore investigated the influence of three modified natural (curosurf, alveofact, and survanta) and two synthetic (exosurf and pumactant) surfactant preparations on the growth of bacteria frequently cultured from blood or tracheal aspirate fluid in the first days of life. group b streptococci (gbs), staphyloccocus aureus, and escherichia coli were incubated in a nutrient-free medium (normal saline) for 5 h at 37 degrees c, together with different surfactants at concentrations of 0, 1, 10, and 20 mg/ml.  with the exception of e. coli, incubation in saline alone led to a variable decrease in cfu. in the presence of alveofact, exosurf, and pumactant the decline in bacterial numbers was less marked than in saline alone. curosurf was bactericidal in a dose-dependent fashion for gbs and had a strong negative impact on the growth of a gbs subtype that lacked the polysaccharide capsule. in contrast, survanta (10 and 20 mg/ml) significantly promoted the growth of e. coli, indicating that surfactant components may actually serve as nutrients. we conclude that bacterial growth in different surfactant preparations is influenced by microbial species and the composition and dose of the surfactant. further studies are necessary to elucidate the mechanisms behind our findings and to evaluate the effects of surfactant on bacterial growth in vivo.

TI  == factors prior to dry period associated with high and low levels of cow milk somatic cell counts in next lactation.
AB  == data from a randomized controlled field study of selective dry cow therapy were used in which 686 cows had been allocated to 2 control groups (sampling only or placebo) or 2 therapy groups. possible factors from previous lactation were assessed in determining their association with the probability of 'failure', designated as a cow milk somatic cell count (cmscc) of greater than 399,000 per ml in geometric mean of several measurements during subsequent lactation. success cows were those with a cmscc of less than 200,000 per ml. for our analyses, this  targeted 187 success cows and 186 failure cows. therapy was given as a total dose of 400,000 iu penicillin and 100 mg neomycin per infected quarter as dry cow preparation once, or as a lactation formula with a total dose of 1.2 million iu penicillin and 1,200 mg dihydrostreptomycin per infected quarter during a 1-week  period. significant factors in the predictive model for success included therapy, low level of cmscc (geometric mean of the 3 last tests) in previous lactation, low level of cmscc (weighted by daily milk yield mean) in the herd, young cows, and not having had a case of treatment for chronic clinical mastitis. additional  information on the probability of failure in treated and untreated cows can be predicted by number of quarters infected with staphylococcus aureus approximately 1.5 months before drying off. the models derived are considered for use as tools  in selective treatment and culling decisions.

AB  == the antibacterial potencies of gemifloxacin (sb-265805) and 13 comparator compounds were determined by broth microdilution against a panel of 645 gram-positive and 995 gram-negative organisms collected from various usa sites. time-kill studies were performed and postantibiotic effect (pae) was determined for several organisms using trovafloxacin and ciprofloxacin as comparator compounds. based on mic(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent compound tested against gram-positive isolates: streptococcus pneumoniae (mic(90) 0. 016 mg/l), streptococcus agalactiae (0.03 mg/l), streptococcus pyogenes (0.03 mg/l), viridans streptococci (0.12 mg/l), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus  (0.03 mg/l), staphylococcus epidermidis (2 mg/l), staphylococcus saprophyticus (0. 016 mg/l) and enterococcus faecalis (2 mg/l). against gram-negative isolates, the potency of gemifloxacin was equal to that of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin and generally better than that of ofloxacin, grepafloxacin, trovafloxacin and nalidixic acid. mic(90)s for gemifloxacin were: haemophilus influenzae (</=0.008  mg/l), moraxella catarrhalis (0.008 mg/l), escherichia coli (0.016 mg/l), klebsiella pneumoniae (0.25 mg/l), klebsiella oxytoca (0.25 mg/l), enterobacter cloacae (1 mg/l), enterobacter aerogenes (0.25 mg/l), proteus spp. (4 mg/l), serratia spp. (1 mg/l), citrobacter freundii (2 mg/l), morganella morganii (0.12  mg/l), pseudomonas aeruginosa (8 mg/l), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4 mg/l) and acinetobacter spp. (32 mg/l). gemifloxacin was bactericidal for all organisms studied at 2 and 4 x mic. the pae for most strains was in the range 0.7-2.5 h at  2 and 4 x mic, although longer paes were observed with h. influenzae, p. aeruginosa and proteus vulgaris (>6 h at 4 x mic) and shorter paes with e. faecalis (0.1-0.6 h) and k. pneumoniae (0.1-0.2 h). in conclusion, gemifloxacin is a novel quinolone with a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity. it has substantially improved potency against gram-positive organisms, especially streptococci, for which gemifloxacin is generally at least eight- to 16-fold more potent than other quinolones tested. it retains the good gram-negative activity seen with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and shows good bactericidal activity and prolonged paes.

TI  == beta 2 integrins are involved in cytokine responses to whole gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == proinflammatory cytokines have an important pathophysiologic role in septic shock. cd14 is involved in cytokine responses to a number of purified bacterial products, including lps. however, little is known of monocyte receptors involved  in cytokine responses to whole bacteria. to identify these receptors, human monocytes were pretreated with different mabs and tnf-alpha was measured in culture supernatants after stimulation with whole heat-killed bacteria. human serum and anti-cd14 abs significantly increased and decreased, respectively, tnf-alpha responses to the gram-negative escherichia coli. however, neither treatment influenced responses to any of the gram-positive bacteria tested, including group a and b streptococci, listeria monocytogenes, and staphylococcus  aureus. complement receptor type iii (cr3 or cd18/cd11b) abs prevented tnf-alpha  release induced by heat-killed group a or b streptococci. in contrast, the same abs had no effects when monocytes were stimulated with l. monocytogenes or s. aureus. using either of the latter bacteria, significant inhibition of tnf-alpha  release was produced by abs to cd11c, one of the subunits of cr4. to confirm these blocking ab data, il-6 release was measured in cr3-, cr4-, or cd14-transfected chinese hamster ovary cells after bacterial stimulation. accordingly, streptococci triggered moderate il-6 production (p < 0.05) in cr3 but not cd14 or cr4 transfectants. in contrast, l. monocytogenes and s. aureus induced il-6 release in cr4 but not cr3 or cd14 transfectants. collectively our data indicate that beta 2 integrins, such as cr3 and cr4, may be involved in cytokine responses to gram-positive bacteria. moreover, cd14 may play a more important role in responses to whole gram-negative bacteria relative to gram-positive ones.

TI  == multilocus enzyme analysis in aerobic and anaerobic bacteria using gel electrophoresis-nitrocellulose blotting.
AB  == an optimized multilocus enzyme electrophoresis method, which involves polyacrylamide-agarose gel electrophoresis followed by electrophoretic transfers  on nitrocellulose sheets, was developed for the analysis of enzyme polymorphism in several aerobic and anaerobic bacterial species including staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. agalactiae, klebsiella pneumoniae and k. oxytoca, clostridium bifermentans and c. sordellii, and prevotella bivia. serial  electrophoretic transfers (during 5-15 min each) from a single polyacrylamide gel could be achieved for most enzymes studied, and allowed an increased definition of enzyme bands on nitrocellulose as compared to migration gels. four enzymes, which could not be blotted in such conditions, could still be stained in gels after blotting. thus, the method allowed the combined analysis of several enzymes after a single gel electrophoresis separation. the analysis of enzyme polymorphism in the various species studied raised the interest of polymorphic loci such as esterase or glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase for epidemiologic studies. the method characterized a genetic diversity of enzyme loci of s. pneumoniae higher than previously reported, and is thus convenient for the analysis of genetic relationships between related isolates. since the present method reduces the tediousness of multilocus enzyme electrophoresis and requires  experimental conditions that are not specific for the bacterial population studied, it may be proposed for rapid population genetics analysis of a wide variety of bacteria.

AB  == group b streptococci (gbs) adhere to surface receptors present on epithelial cells; these receptors include fibronectin and laminin. to identify other possible receptors, plasma membranes from a549 cells, a respiratory tract epithelial cell line, were prepared. these plasma membranes were tested in a protein blot analysis using radiolabeled gbs as a probe. gbs adhered to two species, with molecular masses of 50 kda (p50) and 57 kda (p57). we concluded that p50 and p57 correspond to two forms of cytokeratin 8 (ck8) on the basis of the following results: (i) protein blot results demonstrated that p50 and p57 exactly comigrated with two forms of ck8 after separation by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (page); (ii) p50 and p57 exactly comigrated with ck8 after separation by two-dimensional page; (iii) ck8 in solution bound to gbs, as demonstrated by immunoblot analysis of proteins from a549 lysates that bound to gbs in a liquid-phase assay; and (iv) radiolabeled gbs bound to a549 lysate-derived ck8 that had been captured in anti-ck8-coated microtiter wells. ck8 bound to coh1-13, an acapsular mutant of coh1, demonstrating that adherence is not mediated by capsular polysaccharide. trypsin-treated gbs did not bind to ck8, indicating that adherence is mediated via a protein on the surface of gbs. soluble ck8 bound to six of six gbs strains  tested. soluble ck8 also bound to staphylococcus aureus, lactococcus lactis, enterococcus faecalis, and streptococcus pyogenes. we hypothesize that adherence  of gbs to cytokeratin may be important for maintenance of colonization at sites of keratinized epithelium, such as the vagina, or for adherence of these bacteria to damaged epithelial cells at other sites.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of moxifloxacin against gram-positive clinical isolates.
AB  == the in vitro activity of moxifloxacin was compared with that of 15 antibacterial  agents against 513 gram-positive microorganisms. the mic(90) (mg/l) of moxifloxacin was 0.06 for quinolone-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, 0.12 for streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus agalactiae; 0.25 for streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus bovis, streptococcus anginosus and actinomyces pyogenes; 0.5 for streptococcus sanguis and listeria monocytogenes, 2 for corynebacterium jekeium and bifidobacterium bivius. over 50% of enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium,  quinolone-resistant staphylococci, nocardia steroides and clostridium difficile were susceptible to 2 mg/l moxifloxacin. moxifloxacin and trovafloxacin demonstrated comparably high activity towards gram-positive cocci; moxifloxacin and clinafloxacin were most active against gram-positive bacilli.

TI  == risk factors associated with early-onset sepsis in premature infants.
AB  == objective: to define perinatal factors associated with early-onset neonatal sepsis. study design: maternal and neonatal variables were analysed retrospectively in 343 infants born before 35 weeks using univariate and multivariate statistical analysis. results: logistic regression analysis identified risk factors for probable neonatal sepsis: gestational age at delivery (odds ratio 0.9, 95% confidence interval (ci) 0.91-0.96), premature rupture of the membranes (odds ratio 2.9, 95% ci 1.004-8.56), apgar score after 1 min (odds  ratio 0.7, 95% ci 0.53-0.96), and histological chorioamnionitis and/or funisitis  (odds ratio 4.1, 95% ci 1.36-12.12). there was a strong association between probable sepsis and intracranial haemorrhage of the infant (odds ratio 4.3, 95% ci 1.07-17.40). funisitis had a high specificity (91%) and positive predictive value (82%) for the detection of neonatal sepsis < or =32 weeks. conclusions: independent obstetrical risk factors for early-onset neonatal sepsis in premature infants may help to identify newborns who benefit from maternal antibiotic prophylaxis before birth. the histological examination of the umbilical cord can  be used as an additional diagnostic test to detect newborns at risk of infection.

TI  == in vitro activity of levofloxacin against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == the in vitro activity of levofloxacin was investigated against 256 clinical strains of four gram-positive genera (staphylococcus, streptococcus, enterococcus, and listeria). ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin were used as comparators. uniform susceptibility to levofloxacin was recorded among methicillin-susceptible staphylococci, streptococci other than streptococcus agalactiae, regardless of their being susceptible, intermediate, or resistant to  penicillin (s. pneumoniae) or erythromycin (s. pyogenes and s. pneumoniae), in enterococci other than enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium, and in listeria monocytogenes isolates. moreover, 1 of 22 s. agalactiae isolates and 1 of 19 e. faecium isolates was resistant, and 2 of 19 were intermediate. resistances to levofloxacin with mic90s in the resistance range were only observed in methicillin-resistant staphylococci and e. faecalis isolates. in any case, the mics of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin were usually 2-4 times higher than those of levofloxacin. in time-kill assays using three test strains (a methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus isolate, a penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae isolate, and an e. faecalis isolate), the bactericidal activity of levofloxacin was greater than that of ciprofloxacin.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin, a new injectable streptogramin with a wide gram-positive spectrum.
AB  == quinupristin/dalfopristin (synercid) is a new injectable streptogramin antibiotic proposed for the treatment of severe antimicrobial infections, that has been shown to be active against gram-positive, multi-resistant cocci. we compared the  in vitro activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin with that of amoxycillin, ampicillin, penicillin, cefixime, ceftriaxone, clindamycin, erythromycin, imipenem, meropenem, oxacillin, piperacillin/tazobactam, teicoplanin and vancomycin. the susceptibility of 37 staphylococcus aureus (14 ms, 23 mr), 26 staphylococcus epidermidis (16 ms, 10 mr), 20 streptococcus pneumoniae, 33 group  a streptococcus pyogenes, 15 streptococcus agalactiae, 10 enterococcus faecalis (1 vancomycin-resistant), 15 enterococcus faecium (9 van a) was evaluated. quinupristin/dalfopristin was active against all gram-positive species tested, including met-r s. aureus (mic < or = 2 mg/l), met-r s. epidermidis (mic < or = 2 mg/l), s. pneumoniae (mic < or = 1 mg/l), ery-r and ery-s streptococci (mic < or  = 1 mg/l). the strains of e. faecalis were generally less susceptible. time-kill  studies confirmed that quinupristin/dalfopristin at 4 x mic concentration showed  a complete bactericidal effect (3 log reduction) in about 4 6 h against all strains tested. a post-antibiotic effect (pae) of 3.9-5.2 h was observed at 4 x mic concentration of quinupristin/dalfopristin against staphylococci. a prolonged pae was obtained for s. pneumoniae (8 h), s. pyogenes (9 h) and s. agalactiae (7  h), while the shortest pae was seen for e. faecalis and e. faecium (about 4 h).

TI  == etiology of serious infections in young gambian infants.
AB  == background: despite improvements in infant mortality rates in many developing countries including the gambia, neonatal mortality remains high and many neonatal deaths are caused by infection. the study described in this paper was conducted to determine the bacterial and viral etiology of serious infections in gambian infants younger than 91 days old. methods: at a first level health facility 497 infants with symptoms that could indicate serious infection were enrolled, of whom 239 with 1 or more signs of serious infection and 55 with no signs were investigated, yielding 17 cases with positive bacterial cultures of blood and/or  cerebrospinal fluid. at a nearby pediatric referral hospital 198 infants were seen and 182 were investigated, yielding 35 positive bacterial cultures. results: there were 15 culture positive cases of meningitis caused by streptococcus pneumoniae (7), streptococcus pyogenes (2), enterobacter cloacae (2), escherichia coli (1), haemophilus influenzae type b (1), streptococcus agalactiae (1) and salmonella spp. (1). six of these children died. thirty-three infants without meningitis had positive blood cultures for staphylococcus aureus (17), s. pneumoniae (3), salmonella spp. (5), e. coli (3), other enterobacteria (4) and s. agalactiae (1), of whom 14 died. nasopharyngeal aspirates from 438 children were  investigated for common respiratory viruses. respiratory syncytial virus was found in 51, influenza a in 46, influenza b in 22, parainfluenza in 26 and adenovirus in 16. respiratory syncytial virus and influenza a isolates were found most frequently toward the end of the wet season. nasopharyngeal carriage of s. pneumoniae and h. influenzae was studied in 320 infants recruited during the first year. of these 184 (58%) were positive for s. pneumoniae and 141 (44%) were positive for h. influenzae, 18 of which were type b. infants with a bacterial isolate from blood or cerebrospinal fluid were more likely than the rest to die,  whereas those with a viral isolate were less likely to die. conclusions: the most important causes of serious infections in young gambian infants are staphylococcus aureus, s. pneumoniae and salmonella spp.

TI  == semiquantitative bacterial observations with group b streptococcal vulvovaginitis.
AB  == objective: group b streptococcal (gbs) vulvovaginitis is a poorly-delineated clinical entity. the purpose of this study is to report semiquantitative data from four cases of gbs vulvovaginitis and to comment on their significance in terms of the in vitro inhibitory capabilities of gbs. methodology: four patients  whose clinical presentations were consistent with gbs vulvovaginitis, from whom gbs was isolated and for whom semi-quantitative as well as qualitative microbiologic data existed, were identified. results: to produce vulvovaginitis,  gbs must be at a high multiplicity (10(8) cfu/g of vaginal fluid). single coisolates were identified in three of the four cases (two cases of escherichia coli and one case of staphylococcus aureus). group b streptococcus does not inhibit either of these bacteria in vitro. conclusion: when the growth requirements for the demonstration of in vitro inhibition for gbs or lack thereof are met in vivo, the in vivo observations are consistent with those projected from the in vitro data.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of fk041, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  == the in vitro activity of fk041, a new orally active cephem antibiotic, against a  wide variety of clinical isolates of bacteria was investigated and compared with  those of cefdinir (cfdn) and cefditoren (cdtr). fk041 exhibited broad spectrum activity against reference strains of gram-positive and gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. fk041 was active against clinical isolates of gram-positive organisms  except enterococcus faecalis with mic90s less than 1.56 microg/ml. fk041 was more active than cfdn and cdtr against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and streptococcus agalactiae and was comparable to cfdn and cdtr against streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae. fk041 had no activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococci, like cfdn and cdtr. fk041 showed moderate activity against penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae with an mic range of 0.05 approximately 3.13 microg/ml, and was superior to cfdn but inferior to cdtr. against clinical isolates of many gram-negative organisms such as neisseria gonorrhoeae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis, fk041 had good activity comparable or superior to those of cfdn and cdtr. however, it was inferior to cdtr in activity against moraxella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, morganella morganii, and serratia marcescens, and was inactive against pseudomonas aeruginosa. with fk041 a small difference between mic and mbc against s. aureus, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and h. influenzae was found, indicating that its action is bactericidal against these species. fk041 was stable to group 2beta-lactamase hydrolysis but was unstable to group 1beta-lactamase hydrolysis. the stability of fk041 to these enzymes was similar to those of cfdn and cdtr. fk041 showed high affinity for the main penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) of s. aureus (pbp 3, 2, and 1) and e. coli (pbp 3, 4, lbs, 2, and 1a).

TI  == comparison of seven antibiotic treatments with no treatment for bacteriological efficacy against bovine mastitis pathogens.
AB  == milk culture results were retrospectively reviewed from 9007 cases of subclinical mastitis affecting cows housed in dairy herds located in new york and northern pennsylvania. cases included in this analysis had at least one mastitis pathogen  isolated from the initial milk sample, were recultured within 1 mo, had permanent cow identification, and had records of whether mastitis was treated with an antibiotic or no treatment at all. overall bacteriological cure rate for 21 mastitis pathogens was 68% (6097 of 9007). antibiotic treated cases had a higher  cure rate (75%) than did untreated cases (65%). antibiotic treatments that significantly differed from the untreated cure rate of 65% were amoxicillin (82%), erythromycin (76%), cloxacillin (73%), and pirlimycin (44%). cure rates for antibiotic treatments with cephapirin, hetacillin, or penicillin did not differ from the untreated cure rate. agents for which some antibiotics were associated with increased cure rates compared with no treatment were streptococcus agalactiae, streptococci other than strep. agalactiae, and coagulase-negative staphylococci. the antibiotic most commonly associated with higher cure rates was amoxicillin. most of the 21 mastitis agents showed no difference in bacteriologic cure rates between any of the 7 antibiotic treatments and no treatment.

TI  == identification, cloning, and expression of the camp factor gene (cfa) of group a  streptococci.
AB  == the camp reaction is a synergistic lysis of erythrocytes by the interaction of an extracellular protein (camp factor) produced by some streptococcal species with the staphylococcus aureus sphingomyelinase c (beta-toxin). group a streptococci (gas [streptococcus pyogenes]) have been long considered camp negative, and this  reaction commonly has been used to distinguish gas from streptococcus agalactiae. we here provide evidence that gas possess this gene and produce an extracellular  camp factor capable of participating in a positive camp reaction. the s. pyogenes camp factor is specified by a 774-bp open reading frame homologous to the camp factor genes from s. agalactiae and streptococcus uberis. this gene, designated cfa, was isolated on a 1,256-bp fragment and cloned in escherichia coli. recombinant clones of e. coli expressing cfa secreted an active camp factor. the  deduced 28.5-kda protein encoded by cfa consists of 257 amino acids, with a predicted 28-amino-acid signal peptide. the cfa gene is widely spread among gas:  82 of 100 clinical gas isolates produced a positive camp reaction. of the camp-negative strains, 17 of the 18 gas strains contained the cfa gene. additionally, camp activity was detected in streptococci from serogroups c, m, p, r, and u. the cfa gene was cloned and actively expressed in escherichia coli and  gene fusions were made, placing the beta-galactosidase gene (lacz) under control  of the cfa promoter. these cfa promoter-lacz fusions were introduced into s. pyogenes via a bacteriophage-derived site-specific integration vector where they  showed that the cfa gene has a strong promoter that may be subject to as-yet-unidentified regulatory factors. the results presented here, along with previous reports, indicate that the camp factor gene is fairly widespread among streptococci, being present at least in groups a, b, c, g, m, p, r, and u.

TI  == susceptibility to levofloxacin of clinical isolates of bacteria from intensive care and haematology/oncology patients in switzerland: a multicentre study.
AB  == the objective of this study was to examine the susceptibility of clinical isolates to levofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone with extended activity against gram-positive bacteria, and other antibiotics in 12 swiss clinical microbiology laboratories using the nccls disc diffusion technique. isolates were prospectively collected from intensive care units (icus (59%), oncology wards (7%) and other units with haematology/oncology patients (34%) from june 1995 to march 1996. the levofloxacin breakpoints used were as recommended by the manufacturer. a total of 310 gram-positive and 580 gram-negative isolates from the respiratory tract (36%), skin/wounds (12%), blood (16%), urine (17%) and other sources (19%) were tested. the percentage of isolates susceptible to levofloxacin was 100% for enterococcus spp. (38 strains), streptococcus agalactiae (13), streptococcus pneumoniae (65), acinetobacter spp. (11), citrobacter diversus (6), citrobacter freundii (17), klebsiella oxytoca (39), morganella morganii (16), proteus mirabilis (20), proteus vulgaris (23), serratia spp. (19), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (10) and haemophilus influenzae (41). the percentage of isolates susceptible to levofloxacin for staphylococcus aureus (95  strains, including 2% mrsa) was 94%, coagulase-negative staphylococci (85) 65%, enterobacter spp. (75) 99%, escherichia coli (111) 97%, klebsiella pneumoniae (45) 98% and pseudomonas aeruginosa (124) 87%. in conclusion, levofloxacin is a new fluoroquinolone to which the most common clinical isolates in switzerland are susceptible. the susceptibility of enterococcus spp. and s. pneumoniae to levofloxacin was particularly remarkable. this compound appears to be a promising therapeutic alternative for the treatment of gram-positive infections.

TI  == determinants of success or failure in the elimination of major mastitis pathogens in selective dry cow therapy.
AB  == discriminant factors for the elimination of major pathogens (mainly staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus dysgalactiae) were identified from a randomized, double-blind, field study on dry cow therapy. from an original study  of 686 cows, 269 fulfilled the criteria for this analysis: 93 from the control group, 83 from group c (treated with benestermycin vet. "leo") and 93 from group  d (treated with leocillin with dihydrostreptomycin vet. "leo"). a "success" cow was defined as a cow that had all quarters healthy in two tests after dry period. isolation of a major pathogen (mainly staph. aureus or strep. dysgalactiae) in any quarter in both samples after the dry period was defined as "failure." better elimination was associated with short-acting preparations (therapy d) rather than with long-acting therapy c (odds ratio = 0.32), as was a smaller mean value of the last three composite milk somatic cell counts (cmscc) before dry cow therapy. cows with a major pathogen in the right hind quarter at drying off or at least one case of acute clinical mastitis during the previous lactation were more likely to have a major pathogen in the next lactation (odds ratio = 4.1 and 3.6,  respectively). young cows without major pathogens at drying off should not be recommended for dry cow therapy, and cows with high cmscc should be considered for culling if their profiles also show previous acute clinical mastitis in combination with generally high cmscc and low cure rates in the herd.

TI  == [udder health on dairy farms. 1. results of a longitudinal study on 300 dutch farms].
AB  == udder health was studied in 300 dairy herds grouped in three categories according to the bulk milk somatic cell count. in all herds, lactating cows were housed in  a free-stall barn during the winter. all herds participated in a three or four-weekly milk recording system, had annual production quota between 300,000 and 900,000 kg, and were stocked with cows of the holstein-friesian or dutch friesian breeds. the incidence of clinical mastitis was not different among herds with a low (< or = 150,000), middle (151,000 to 250,000), or high (251,000 to 400,000 cells/ml) bulk milk somatic cell count. clinical mastitis caused by gram-negative pathogens occurred more often in herds with a low bulk milk somatic cell count. clinical mastitis caused by staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus dysgalactiae, or streptococcus agalactiae occurred more often in herds with a high bulk milk somatic cell count; however, the incidence of clinical streptococcus uberis mastitis was not different among the three herd categories.  the differences in bulk milk somatic cell count between the categories could be explained by the management practices studied. the incidence of clinical e. coli  mastitis was mostly related to housing, hygiene, and milking machine. the incidence of clinical staphylococcus aureus mastitis was associated with factors  that were related to the bulk milk somatic cell count and to factors of which it  was not clear whether they were a cause or effect of the high incidence of staphylococcus aureus mastitis. the incidence of clinical streptococcus dysgalactiae mastitis was related to nutrition, milking technique, and milking machine. the incidence of clinical streptococcus uberis mastitis was associated with housing, nutrition, and milking machine. two groups of farmers and herds could be differentiated. the first group was identified as 'clean and accurate',  and the second group as 'quick and dirty'. the relationship between these two groups and bulk milk somatic cell count category was high. however, the relationship between the two groups and the incidence of clinical mastitis was weak.

TI  == spectrum and antimicrobial activity of alexomycin (pnu-82, 127), a peptide compound projected for use in animal health.
AB  == alexomycin (pnu-82, 127) is a thiopeptide antimicrobial complex intended for veterinary practice that belongs to a series of cyclic peptides produced by streptomyces arginensis. mics against selected routine and fastidious clinical isolates of animal and human origin were determined by broth microdilution or agar dilution reference methods. alexomycin was active against gram-positive pathogens such as oxacillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus and  coagulase-negative staphylococci (260 strains; mic90, 0.5 microgram/ml), as well  as enterococcus species (95 strains; mic90, 0.25 to 0.5 microgram/ml), and generally inactive against gram-negative aerobes. alexomycin had more potent activity against streptococcus bovis (mic90, 0.12 microgram/ml), s. agalactiae (mic90, 0.12 microgram/ml), corynebacterium species (mic90, 0.06-0.12 microgram/ml), and listeria monocytogenes (mic90, 0.5 microgram/ml). alexomycin activity was limited against bacillus species (mic90, 1 microgram/ml), neisseria  meningiditis (mic90, 2 micrograms/ml), haemophilus influenzae (mic90, 8 micrograms/ml), moraxella catarrhalis (mic90, 16 micrograms/ml), and campylobacter jejuni (mic90, 32 micrograms/ml). this thiopeptide complex was also found to be stable at low concentrations (0.015-32 micrograms/ml) in mueller-hinton broth for up to 24 h, possesses static antimicrobial activity and  did not produce resistant mutants after multiple passages at subinhibitory drug concentrations. alexomycin seems to have potential for use as a feed additive to  increase feed efficiency and promote growth in poultry and swine as well as other applications against gram-positive pathogens.

TI  == a preliminary survey of antibiotic residues and viable bacteria in milk from three caribbean basin countries.
AB  == there is widespread concern about the presence of antimicrobial drugs in milk. the presence of drug residues in milk may have public health implications. milk samples (n = 25 to 65/country) were collected from bulk tanks and commercial vendors in barbados, costa rica, and jamaica between february 1996 and august 1997. bulk tank samples were collected from high milk-producing regions of jamaica and costa rica and from 26 dairy farms in barbados. milk ph, bacterial growth (total cfu/ml and the presence of streptococcus agalactiae and staphylococcus aureus), and the presence of antimicrobials were determined. milk  samples were tested by a microbial inhibition test (delvotest-p, gist-brocades food ingredients, inc.) to screen for antimicrobial drugs. all positives were retested for the presence of beta-lactam antibiotics after incubating with penicillinase and some positives were identified by high-pressure liquid chromatography-uv. mean ph values ranged from 6.5 to 6.7. s. aureus was identified in bulk tank samples from costa rica (52%), barbados (44%), and jamaica (46%). s. agalactiae was identified in bulk tank samples from costa rica  (28%), barbados (8 and 16%), and jamaica (18%). antimicrobial residues were detected in some bulk tank samples from barbados (8%) and jamaica (10%) but not in samples from costa rica. all positives in milk from jamaica and barbados were  determined to be beta-lactams. no residues were detected in pasteurized milk samples from barbados or ultrahigh-temperature milk from jamaica. the presence of beta-lactam residues in some of these samples suggests the appropriateness of testing milk prior to processing for consumption.

TI  == vaccines and diagnostic methods for bovine mastitis: fact and fiction.
AB  == a number of problems are uniquely associated with vaccination of dairy cows for mastitis. one of these is that the number of mastitis pathogens is numerous and heterogeneous. vaccine efforts have concentrated mainly on the major mastitis pathogens. while at least one s. aureus bacterin has been commercially available  for a number of years, no large-scale, independent field trials have been published in refereed journals which support the efficacy of this vaccine. experimental vaccines for s. aureus composed of pseudocapsule-enriched bacterins  supplemented with alpha- and/or beta-toxoids appear promising, but none of these  has been commercialized. with s. uberis, some protection against homologous strain challenges was reported recently with a live strain and a bacterin, but other data from the same laboratory showed this vaccine would not protect against heterologous challenge strains. at this time there is only one highly effective vaccine for mastitis, the core-antigen vaccine for coliform mastitis. all of the  commercially available vaccines for this indication are bacterins of rough mutants of e. coli strain j5 or salmonella spp. preliminary success with an experimental vaccine based on the plasminogen activator of s. uberis is a very different approach for a mastitis vaccine. little success has been reported with  vaccination against other mastitis pathogens. for diagnostic methods, the high somatic cell count, as measured by direct count or indirect assays, remains the cornerstone of mastitis diagnosis. however, for subclinical mastitis, bacterial cell culture is a reliable diagnostic method. pathogen identification may rely on older biochemical testing methods or newer commercial identification systems, depending on the laboratory budget. elisa assays also have been used to assess herd infection status. epidemiologic studies have used dna fingerprinting and ribotyping, but none of these methods has yet produced an easily utilized commercial format. within the next decade, additional efficacious vaccines for several of the most common agents for bovine mastitis are likely. a review written at that time then can be more fact than fiction.

AB  == various mycotoxins were tested for their antibacterial activity by evaluating growth delays using a fully automated microturbidmetric method. ten different strains of the genera escherichia, streptococcus, staphylococcus, yersinia, salmonella, erysipelothrix and lactobacillus were used as test micro-organisms. t-2 toxin, deoxynivalenol (don), ochratoxin a (ota), aflatoxin b1 (afb1) and fumonisin b1 (fb1) were used as representative mycotoxins. the inhibitory effect  in vitro was defined as the difference between the growth rate without mycotoxins and the growth rate in the presence of a mycotoxin. among the tested strains, streptococcus agalactiae was found to be sensitive to all the toxins, with the exception of ota. t-2 toxin and fb1 were the most effective in slowing down the growth of staphylococcus aureus. afb1 affected the growth of yersinia enterocolitica. the growth rate of escherichia coli and salmonella infantis was decreased by fb1. among the bacterial strains used in this study, only the growth of erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae was inhibited by ota. thus, using appropriate tester strains it should be possible to set up a broad-range microtubidimetry assay for individual mycotoxin screening in vitro. we concluded that the microtitration technique provides a rapid, convenient and high-throughput capacity system to analyse bacteria-mycotoxin interactions.

TI  == effect of therapeutic concentrations of nitric oxide on bacterial growth in vitro.
AB  == objectives: besides its vasodilative actions, nitric oxide (no) is also involved  in host defense on a cellular level. we studied the antimicrobial properties of no in concentrations used with inhaled no therapy for the treatment of pulmonary  hypertension in neonates. design: in vitro study of bacterial growth of five species, with and without no exposure. setting: level iv neonatal intensive care  unit at a university children's hospital. subjects: in vitro bacterial cultures.  interventions: we tested ten different strains of five bacterial species (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, group b streptococcus [gbs/streptococcus agalactiae], escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa), derived from the tracheal isolates of ventilated premature and term infants. cultures were exposed to three different concentrations of no (40, 80, and 120 parts per million [ppm]) and bacterial growth was compared with the same strains  incubated in ambient air for 24 hrs. after incubation (with or without no), colony-forming units were counted. measurements and main results: bacterial growth of s. aureus, e. coli, and p. aeruginosa was not reduced with the no concentrations applied. the number of colony-forming units of s. aureus increased at 80 ppm of no. growth of s. epidermidis and gbs was significantly affected at 120 ppm, resulting in decreased numbers of colony-forming units as compared with  controls exposed to ambient air. conclusions: we conclude that no has a selective bacteriostatic effect on some of those bacteria most commonly cultured in tracheal specimens of premature infants and neonates. this effect appears to be dose-dependent and occurs in the upper range of dosages used with inhaled no therapy. however, in the range of dosages applied in ongoing controlled trials of inhaled no in neonates and premature infants (1 to 80 ppm), a bacteriostatic effect of no is not to be expected.

TI  == effects of tamoxifen, melatonin, coenzyme q10, and l-carnitine supplementation on bacterial growth in the presence of mycotoxins.
AB  == the involvement of toxic oxygen intermediates in the bacteriostatic effects of mycotoxins (t-2 toxin, deoxynivalenol, ochratoxin a, aflatoxin b1, and fumonisin  b1) was investigated by producing bacterial growth curves using turbidimetry assays in the presence and absence of oxygen radical-scavenging substances. the strains used in this study included escherichia coli (ft 101), streptococcus agalactiae (ft 311, ft 313, ft 315), staphylococcus aureus (ft 192), yersinia enterocolitica (ft 430), salmonella infantis (ft 431), erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae (ft 432), lactobacillus plantarum (ft234) and lactobacillus casei (ft 232). tamoxifen, melatonin, l-carnitine and coenzyme q10 were used as radical scavengers against oxygen toxicity to the strains studied. tamoxifen was the most effective in inhibiting bacterial growth when used at a high concentration, whereas melatonin and l-carnitine were less effective. a combination of l-carnitine and coenzyme q10 provided better protection against oxygen toxicity caused by the mycotoxins growth than they did individually. it was concluded that oxygen radicals are involved in the killing of bacteria and that there is endogenous formation of toxic oxygen products by mycotoxins. the objective of this study was to determine whether the antioxidants were able to counteract the  toxic effects of the mycotoxins. the data obtained indicate that bacterial growth can be inhibited especially by t-2 toxin, aflatoxin b1 and ochratoxin a and that  this effect can be partially counteracted by antioxidants such as coenzyme q10 plus l-carnitine.

TI  == partial budget of the discounted annual benefit of mastitis control strategies.
AB  == the objective of this study was to rank the benefits associated with various mastitis control strategies in simulated herds with intramammary infections caused by streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus spp. other than strep. agalactiae, staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, and escherichia coli. the control strategies tested were prevention, vaccination for  e. coli, lactation therapy, and dry cow antibiotic therapy. partial budgets were  based on changes caused by mastitis control strategies from the mean values for milk, fat, and protein yields of the control herd and the number of cows that were culled under a fixed mastitis culling criterion. each annual benefit (dollars per cow per year) of a mastitis control strategy was compared with the revenue for the control herd and was calculated under two different milk pricing  plans (3.5% milk fat and multiple-component pricing), three net replacement costs, and three prevalences of pathogen-specific intramammary infection. twenty  replicates of each control strategy were run with simmast (a dynamic discrete event stochastic simulation model) for 5 simulated yr. rankings of discounted annual benefits differed only slightly according to milk pricing plans within a pathogen group but differed among the pathogen groups. differences in net replacement costs for cows culled because of mastitis did not change the ranking  of control strategies within a pathogen group. both prevention and dry cow therapy were important mastitis control strategies. for herds primarily infected  with environmental pathogens, strategies that included vaccination for mastitis caused by e. coli dominated strategies that did not include vaccination against this microorganism.

TI  == azithromycin. a review of its use in paediatric infectious diseases.
AB  == azithromycin is an azalide antimicrobial agent active in vitro against major pathogens responsible for infections of the respiratory tract, skin and soft tissues in children. pathogens that are generally susceptible to azithromycin include haemophilus influenzae (including ampicillin-resistant strains), moraxella catarrhalis, chlamydia pneumoniae, chlamydia trachomatis, mycoplasma pneumoniae, legionella spp., streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus agalactiae. azithromycin is also generally active against erythromycin- and penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae and methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus. azithromycin is administered once daily, achieves clinically relevant concentrations at sites of infection, is slowly eliminated from the body and has few drug interactions. in children, azithromycin is usually given as either a 3-day course of 10 mg/kg/day or a 5-day course with 10 mg/kg on the first day, followed by 5 mg/kg/day for a further 4 days. these standard regimens were as effective as amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, clarithromycin, cefaclor and amoxicillin in the treatment of children with otitis media. azithromycin was also as effective as either phenoxymethylpenicillin (penicillin  v), erythromycin, clarithromycin or cefaclor against streptococcal pharyngitis or tonsillitis in children, but appears to result in more recurrence of infection than phenoxymethylpenicillin in this indication, necessitating a dosage of 12 mg/kg/day for 5 days. community-acquired pneumonia, bronchitis and other respiratory tract infections in children responded as well to azithromycin as to  amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, cefaclor, erythromycin or josamycin. azithromycin was similar or superior to ceftibuten in mixed general practice populations of patients. however, symptoms of lower respiratory tract infections resolved more rapidly with azithromycin than with erythromycin, josamycin or cefaclor. skin and soft tissue infections responded as well to azithromycin as to cefaclor, dicloxacillin or flucloxacillin, and oral azithromycin was as effective as ocular tetracycline in treating trachoma. although not as well tolerated as phenoxymethylpenicillin in the treatment of streptococcal pharyngitis, azithromycin is at least as well tolerated as most other agents used to treat respiratory tract and other infections in children and was better tolerated than  amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. adverse events that do occur are mostly gastrointestinal and tend to be mild to moderate in severity. conclusions: azithromycin is an effective and well tolerated alternative to first-line agents  in the treatment of respiratory tract, skin and soft tissue infections in children, offerring the convenience of a short, once-daily regimen.

TI  == identification of two genes, cpsx and cpsy, with putative regulatory function on  capsule expression in group b streptococci.
AB  == two divergently transcribed open reading frames: cpsx and cpsy separated by a common regulatory region was identified upstream of the cpsa-d genes involved in  polysaccharide capsule biosynthesis in group b streptococci (gbs). we suggest that these genes are involved in the regulation of capsule expression in gbs, since the cpsx protein shares sequence similarities with lytr of bacillus subtilis, an attenuator of transcription while cpsy has similarity to a wide variety of members of the lysr family of transcriptional regulators. no deletions, insertions, dna rearrangements, or apparent differences were discovered in the postulated regulatory genes when the gene region was compared in gbs with different capsule phenotypes. thus, other yet unidentified gene loci  may control capsule phase variation in gbs.

TI  == a new ketolide, hmr 3004, active against streptococci inducibly resistant to erythromycin.
AB  == hmr 3004 is a new hydrazono ketolide characterized by a 3-keto function instead of the cladinose moiety. the effect of this antimicrobial agent on inducible and  constitutive macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin b (mlsb) resistance was tested in a lacz reporter system under control of several ermam-like attenuator variants. for one constitutively resistant streptococcus agalactiae strain, three inducibly resistant streptococcus pneumoniae strains, and one inducibly resistant enterococcus faecalis strain, the attenuators fused with lacz were cloned into the shuttle plasmid pjim2246 and the plasmid was introduced into staphylococcus aureus rn4220. for the wild-type attenuators, hmr 3004 was a very weak inducer, unlike its cladinose counterpart ru 6652 and erythromycin. as expected, for the fusion originating from the constitutively resistant s. agalactiae strain, the level of uninduced beta-galactosidase synthesis was high. for one s. pneumoniae attenuator, mutations in the 3' end of the attenuator that weakened the stem-loop structure that sequesters the ribosome-binding site and start codon for ermam methylase could explain the high level of uninduced beta-galactosidase produced.  for streptococci, the activity of hmr 3004 correlated with the basal level of beta-galactosidase synthesized. the weak inducer activity of hmr 3004 explained its activity against inducibly mlsb-resistant s. pneumoniae but did not correlate with the moderate activity of the antibiotic against inducibly resistant e. faecalis.

TI  == design and validation of a dynamic discrete event stochastic simulation model of  mastitis control in dairy herds.
AB  == a dynamic stochastic simulation model for discrete events, simmast, was developed to simulate the effect of mastitis on the composition of the bulk tank milk of dairy herds. intramammary infections caused by streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus spp. other than strep. agalactiae, staphylococcus aureus, and coagulase-negative staphylococci were modeled as were the milk, fat, and protein  test day solutions for individual cows, which accounted for the fixed effects of  days in milk, age at calving, season of calving, somatic cell count (scc), and random effects of test day, cow yield differences from herdmates, and autocorrelated errors. probabilities for the transitions among various states of  udder health (uninfected or subclinically or clinically infected) were calculated to account for exposure, heifer infection, spontaneous recovery, lactation cure,  infection or cure during the dry period, month of lactation, parity, within-herd  yields, and the number of quarters with clinical intramammary infection in the previous and current lactations. the stochastic simulation model was constructed  using estimates from the literature and also using data from 164 herds enrolled with quality milk promotion services that each had bulk tank scc between 500,000  and 750,000/ml. model parameters and outputs were validated against a separate data file of 69 herds from the northeast dairy herd improvement association, each with a bulk tank scc that was > or = 500,000/ml. sensitivity analysis was performed on all input parameters for control herds. using the validated stochastic simulation model, the control herds had a stable time average bulk tank scc between 500,000 and 750,000/ml.

AB  == incidence of clinical mastitis was studied in 274 herds grouped in three categories by bulk milk somatic cell count (scc). mean incidence rate of clinical mastitis was 0.278, 0.257, and 0.252 cases per 365 cow-days at risk in herds with low (< or = 150,000), medium (150,000 to 250,000), and high (250,000 to 400,000 cells/ml) bulk milk scc, respectively. the incidence rate of clinical mastitis was not different among the three categories. variance in the incidence of clinical mastitis among herds increased as bulk milk scc decreased. clinical mastitis caused by gram-negative pathogens, such as escherichia coli, klebsiella  spp., or pseudomonas spp., occurred more often in herds with a low bulk milk scc. clinical mastitis caused by staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus dysgalactiae, and streptococcus agalactiae occurred more often in herds with a high bulk milk scc. systemic signs of illness caused by clinical mastitis occurred more often in herds with a low bulk milk scc. both overall culling rate and culling rate for clinical mastitis were not different among groups catergorized by bulk milk scc.  in herds with a high bulk milk scc, however, more cows that produced milk with a  high scc were culled. in herds with a low bulk milk scc, more cows were culled for teat lesions, milkability, udder shape, fertility, and character than were cows in herds with a high bulk milk scc. in herds with a low bulk milk scc, cows  were also culled more for export and production reasons.

AB  == forty-six awassi sheep flocks selected by stratified random sampling were subjected to a cross-sectional study to determine the prevalence of intramammary  infections, to assess the influence of flock size and parity on the prevalence of somatic cell count (scc) and to identify major udder pathogens. of the 3472 udder halves examined, 29.8% had over 10(6) scc/ml and 0.03% had dry teats due to chronic mastitis. flocks with 30-49 milking ewes (small flock size) were much younger (p < 0.001) than flocks with 50-99 ewes (medium) and flocks with > or = 100 ewes (large). pairwise analysis of the inscc of both halves of the udders revealed significant mean differences for small and large flock size (p < 0.05),  and for medium and large flock size (p < 0.001). mean inscc was lower (p < 0.05)  in samples obtained from the left half compared with samples of the right half of the udder. multiparous ewes had higher (p < 0.001) mean inscc than primiparous ewes. also, ewes with twin lambs had higher (p < 0.001) mean inscc in the right half of the udder compared with single-lamb ewes. samples collected in january (winter) had lower (p < 0.05) mean inscc compared with samples collected in june. the most common organisms isolated from subclinical mastitis cases were coagulase-negative staphylococci (17.8%), e. coli (13.6%), streptococcus agalactiae (6.8%) and staphylococcus aureus (6.8%). of the 46 flocks, 20 were monitored monthly for 9 consecutive months to determine the incidence of clinical mastitis diagnosed by shepherds or/and sheep farmers with major pathogens. the incidence of clinical mastitis (expressed as the number of clinical cases per 100 ewe-months) were 2.1 +/- 1.9 (sd), 1.9 +/- 1.1, and 1.2 +/- 2.1 for small, medium and large flocks size strata, respectively. the overall population estimate was 1.7 +/- 0.02 cases per 100 ewe-months. the most-common clinical isolates were s.  aureus (22% of all clinical isolates) and e. coli (14.2%).

TI  == selecting linear-score distributions for modelling milk-culture results.
AB  == the data for this cross-sectional retrospective study are from surveys of 65 dairy-cattle herds in central new york, usa sampled between february, 1993 and march, 1995. the objective was to identify probability distributions of logarithmically transformed somatic-cell counts (linear score) for use in a simulation model of mastitis and milk quality. probability density functions were estimated using maximum-likelihood estimators for the linear score of individual-cow composite-milk samples culture negative and culture positive for the pathogens streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus non-agalactiae, staphylococcus aureus, and coagulase-negative staphylococci for the complete dataset and by bulk-tank somatic-cell count group (< 500,000, > or = 500,000 scc/ml). based on the rankings of three goodness-of-fit tests (anderson-darling,  kolmogorov-smirnov and chi 2), the weibull distribution (among the three top-ranking distributions for 14 out of 15 cases) may be used to model the individual-cow linear-score response by culture-result-specific bulk-tank somatic-cell count group. a beta distribution was among the three top-ranking distributions for nine out of 15 culture-result-specific bulk-tank somatic-cell count groups and has a logical relationship to linear score because it is defined on a fixed interval. on the other hand, the normal distribution had a poorer fit  than the weibull and at least two other distributions for all culture negative and coagulase-negative staphylococci samples. we do not assume that the underlying biological processes are fully explained by either weibull or beta distribution--but modelling the linear score for the above culture results with these distributions provided an adequate fit to the survey data, reduced the need for two-sided truncation that open intervals needed, and had errors that did not  appear to be systematically positive or negative.

TI  == outbreak of mastitis caused by one strain of staphylococcus aureus in a closed dairy herd.
AB  == the washington state university dairy experienced an outbreak of intramammary infections (imi) caused by staphylococcus aureus during autumn 1993 through summer 1995. the outbreak was believed to be a result of transmission of 1 strain of s aureus in a herd that historically had excellent control of contagious mastitis. control practices included strict hygiene at time of milking and preferential culling of cows infected with s aureus. mastitis caused by streptococcus agalactiae was not found in this herd. despite excellent control practices, the strain of s aureus caused a new infection rate of approximately 3% of the herd per month. moreover, a second strain of s aureus, isolated from a cow with mastitis, was introduced into the herd experimentally, and it failed to transmit disease. the outbreak of s aureus mastitis in this herd was eventually controlled by maintaining a program of strict milking time hygiene, by intensifying the program of preferentially culling infected cows, and by segregating cows with s aureus imi in a separate pen and milking these infected cows last.

TI  == giving selenium supplements to dairy cows strengthens the inflammatory response to intramammary infection and induces a growth-suppressing effect on mastitis pathogens in whey.
AB  == supplementing the feed of selenium-deficient diary cows with selenium (se)-yeast  or selenite at a level of 0.2 p.p.m. induced self-cure of subclinical mastitis; the prevalence of quarters harbouring subclinical mastitis (bacteriological criteria) decreased to about one half during the 8 week supplementation period. three phenomena became apparent to explain the beneficial effect of selenium on mastitis: 1. the recruitment of phagocytes to the infected milk compartment of the udder was improved due to se-supplementation; the correlation between infection and the respective inflammatory response, as indicated by the somatic cell count (scc) and the n-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase activity (nagase) of milk, was poor in selenium-deficient cows. selenium supplementation significantly improved the correlation; 2. selenium supplementation induced an unspecified antibacterial activity in milk lactoserum (whey), restricting in vitro growth of  the mastitis pathogens escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae and streptococcus uberis, bacterial growth rates in whey samples became inversely correlated with the respective blood glutathione peroxidase activities (gsh-px); and 3. selenium supplementation had an effect on redox activities and sulfhydryl activities in whey. these changes were correlated with  in vitro bacterial growth rates.

TI  == clinical mastitis in dairy cattle in ontario: frequency of occurrence and bacteriological isolates.
AB  == the objective of this study was to describe the frequency of occurrence of clinical mastitis in dairy herds in ontario. the study group consisted of 65 dairy farms involved in a 2-year observational study, which included recording all clinical mastitis cases and milk sampling of quarters with clinical mastitis. lactational incidence risks of 9.8% for abnormal milk only, 8.2% for abnormal milk with a hard or swollen udder, and 4.4% for abnormal milk plus systemic signs of illness related to mastitis were calculated for 2840 cows and heifers. overall, 19.8% of cows experienced one or more cases of clinical mastitis during  location. teat injuries occurred in 2.1% of lactations. standard bacteriology was performed on pretreatment milk samples from 834 cows with clinical mastitis. the  bacteria isolated were staphylococcus aureus (6.7%), streptococcus agalactiae (0.7%), other streptococcus spp. (14.1%), coliforms (17.2%), gram-positive bacilli (5.5%), corynebacterium bovis (1.7%), and other staphylococcus spp. (28.7%). there was no growth in 17.7% of samples, and 8.3% of samples were contaminated. clinical mastitis is a common disease in dairy cows in ontario; approximately 1 in 5 cow lactations have at lease one episode of clinical mastitis. there is, however, considerable variation in the incidence of clinical  mastitis among farms. the majority of 1st cases of clinical mastitis occur early  in lactation, and the risk of clinical mastitis increases with increasing parity. environmental, contagious, and minor pathogens were all associated with cases of  clinical mastitis.

TI  == cloning and characterization of a novel macrolide efflux gene, mrea, from streptococcus agalactiae.
AB  == a strain of streptococcus agalactiae displayed resistance to 14-, 15-, and 16-membered macrolides. in pcr assays, total genomic dna from this strain contained neither erm nor mef genes. ecori-digested genomic dna from this strain  was cloned into lambda zap ii to construct a library of s. agalactiae genomic dna. a clone, paes63, expressing resistance to erythromycin, azithromycin, and spiramycin in escherichia coli was recovered. deletion derivatives of paes63 which defined a functional region on this clone that encoded resistance to 14- and 15-membered, but not 16-membered, macrolides were produced. studies that determined the levels of incorporation of radiolabelled erythromycin into e. coli were consistent with the presence of a macrolide efflux determinant. this putative efflux determinant was distinct from the recently described mef pump in  streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae and from the multicomponent msra pump in staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci. its gene has been designated mrea (for macrolide resistance efflux).

TI  == [comparative antimicrobial activity of rp 59,500 (quinupristin-dalfopristin), the first semisynthetic injectable streptgramin, against gram-positive cocci and other recent clinical pathogens].
AB  == rp 59,500 (quinupristin-dalfopristin) is the first semisynthetic injectable streptogramin antimicrobial agent, which is a combination of quinupristin and dalfopristin in a 30:70 ratio. the components of rp 59,500 act synergically to provide bactericidal activity through action at different sites on bacterial ribosomes. in the present study, the antimicrobial activity of rp 59,500 was compared with those of four macrolides (erythromycin, clarithromycin, azithromycin, roxithromycin). susceptibility testing was carried out by microdilution method on 303 strains of 10 species, especially antibiotic-resistant gram-positive cocci. rp 59,500 was active against a wide range of gram-positive cocci including methicillin-resistant staphylococci and penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae. the mics90 of rp 59,500 against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and staphylococcus epidermidis were both 0.25 microgram/ml, although those of four macrolides were higher than 32 micrograms/ml. the mics90 of rp 59,500 against penicillin-sensitive, -intermediate and -resistant s. pneumoniae were all 0.5 microgram/ml, although those of four macrolides against penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae were higher than 32 micrograms/ml. rp 59,500 also exhibited equivalent activities to the four macrolides against strains of streptococcus pyogenes. streptococcus agalactiae and moraxella catarrhalis. rp 59,500 exhibited the highest activities against enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium and enterococcus avium strains which  are intrinsically resistant to most antimicrobial agents. no cross-resistance was observed between rp 59,500 and the four macrolides, which will merit attention in future clinical trials of the agent. the effect of human serum on the mic of rp 59,500 was studied with strains of s. aureus, s. epidermidis and e. faecalis. the presence of 20% (v/v) serum had little or no effect on the mic, although 50% (v/v) serum increased mics by 4-8 folds. laboratory-induced resistance to rp 59,500 occurred in a stepwise fashion in broth cultures of s. aureus, s. epidermidis and e. facalis strains and the induction rate was slow and no more than four fold increases were observed. population analysis was performed on rp 59,500 and the reference macrolides against s. aureus atcc 25,923 strain. although low frequencies (less than 0.01%) of resistant sub-population were detected with em, cam, azm and rxm, no rp 59,500-resistant sub-population was detected in this study.

TI  == identification of staphylococcal and streptococcal causes of bovine mastitis using 16s-23s rrna spacer regions.
AB  == bovine mastitis is caused mainly by certain staphylococcus and streptococcus species. the sequences of the 16s-23s rrna spacer regions were determined for the nine species which cause mastitis: staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus chromogenes, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus hyicus, staphylococcus simulans, staphylococcus xylosus, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus dysgalactiae and streptococcus uberis. significant variation was found between the spacer sequences of different species with the lengths of the spacers varying from 240 to 461 bp. between genera the spacers shared only short conserved regions (8-9 bp) and within genera the sequence identities varied from 53 to 85%. this variation made it possible to construct specific primer pairs for these species and genera. the specificities of these primers were tested with 25 bacterial species and 51 isolates from cattle with clinical mastitis. the dna-based identification of the mastitis species was mostly successful.

TI  == estimation of interdependence among quarters of the bovine udder with subclinical mastitis and implications for analysis.
AB  == interdependency among udder quarters with subclinical mastitis was evaluated on 150 farms using a total of 35,828 udder quarters. the occurrence of high somatic  cell count (scc) (> 250,000 cells/ml) in 0, 3, and 4 quarters occurred at a higher rate than would be expected based on independence of the quarters. for all bacterial species, intramammary infection in 0, 2, 3, or 4 quarters of the same cow occurred at a higher rate than would be expected based on independence of the quarters. intramammary infection and high scc were found less often in front quarters than in rear quarters. high scc and intramammary infection occurred more often in right front quarters than in left front quarters. high scc in diagonal quarters occurred at a lower rate than expected. corynebacterium bovis, streptococcus agalactiae, and staphylococcus aureus had the highest intraclass correlation within herd. streptococcus uberis had a very low intraclass correlation within herd. the intraclass correlation within cow for the natural logarithm of scc was 0.47. corynebacterium bovis and strep. agalactiae had the highest intraclass correlation within cow, and streptococcus dysgalactiae had the lowest. analytical methods were proposed to manage the problem of interdependence and its effect on the design or evaluation of field studies on subclinical mastitis.

TI  == a prospective study of neonatal sepsis and meningitis in southern israel.
AB  == objective: to study the epidemiology of neonatal sepsis and meningitis in the negev area of southern israel. design: a prospective 8-year study conducted at the neonatal intensive care unit and pediatric wards of the soroka university medical center. results: two hundred twenty-nine cases of hospital and community-acquired neonatal sepsis occurred during the study period. thirty-two patients (14%) were meningitis. during this period 70,709 births (59% jews and 41% bedouins) were recorded; thus the rates of neonatal sepsis and meningitis were 3.2 and 0.5/1000 live births, respectively. one hundred seventeen (4/1000 live births) cases were recorded in bedouins and 112 (2.6/1000 live births) in jewish neonates (p < 0.001). twenty-six percent of all sepsis cases occurred within < 24 h from birth, 25% from days 2 to 7 of life and 49% between days 8 and 28. a total of 251 organisms that were considered true pathogens were isolated. fifty-seven of all isolates were gram-negative organisms (mainly klebsiella pneumoniae (20%) and escherichia coli (16%)). gram-positive organisms were isolated in 41% of cases. although e. coli was the most frequently recovered gram-negative pathogen in community-acquired late onset sepsis, klebsiella and enterobacter spp. represented the most commonly isolated gram-negative organisms  in nosocomial late onset sepsis. all staphylococcus aureus isolates recovered in  late onset sepsis were nosocomial. the incidence of streptococcus agalactiae was  3 times higher in early onset sepsis than in late onset sepsis. all cases of streptococcus pneumoniae sepsis occurred in bedouins. conclusions: neonatal sepsis and meningitis rates in southern israel are similar to those reported in western europe and the united states. the incidence of neonatal sepsis is significantly higher for bedouins than for jewish neonates. the distribution of the main pathogens is different in southern israel and although gram-negative enteric organisms are predominant, s. agalactiae plays a relatively minor role in the etiology of sepsis during the first month of life. in southern israel the etiology of community-acquired late onset sepsis is different from that of nosocomial late onset sepsis.

(b.) catarrhalis and  methicillin sensitive s. aureus. against methicillin sensitive s. epidermidis, rxm activity was fairly good but about 20% of the strains had mic > or = 128 micrograms/ml. the activity against s. pneumoniae was not so potent and similar to activities of em, cam, mdm, and clindamycin. the vast majority of methicillin  resistant s. aureus and s. epidermidis were also resistant to macrolide antibiotics and other classes of compounds tested. in conclusion, rxm is an unique macrolide antibiotic by retaining potent activity against s. pyogenes, s.  agalactiae, s. aureus except mrsa, m. (b.) catarrhalis and m. pneumoniae.

TI  == association between management practices, dairy herd characteristics, and somatic cell count of bulk tank milk.
AB  == objective: to determine whether particular dairy management practices and herd characteristics were associated with somatic cell count (scc) of bulk tank milk.  design: analysis of records. sample population: milk samples collected from 59,435 cows housed in 843 dairy herds between march 1992 and june 1994. procedure: results of bacterial culture of milk samples and data on farm housing, sanitation, milking system, and management were collected. multiple regression analysis was used to determine sources of variation in bulk tank milk scc among herds. results: prevalence of streptococcus agalactiae and staphylococcus aureus  mastitis was associated with bulk tank milk scc. in herds free of s agalactiae mastitis, prevalence of s aureus and corynebacterium bovis mastitis were important. for herds without s agalactiae mastitis, use of sawdust bedding was associated with a decrease in scc and a dirty loose housing area was associated with an increase. increased milk production, repeated mastitis control visits, and use of particular predip compounds were significantly associated with reduced scc in all herds, regardless of whether any cows in the herd had s agalactiae mastitis. in herds with s agalactiae mastitis, use of iodine (certain concentrations), chlorhexidine, peroxide, or sodium chlorite-lactic acid as a predip was associated with a decrease in scc. only use of sodium chlorite-lactic  acid predip was significantly associated with a decrease in scc in herds without  s agalactiae mastitis. clinical implications: important factors associated with bulk tank milk scc were prevalence of s agalactiae and s aureus mastitis, careful application of particular predip compounds, avoiding a dirty loose housing area,  and use of a service to regularly monitor prevalence of mastitis in the herd.

TI  == increase of staphylococci in neonatal septicaemia: a fourteen-year study.
AB  == all cases of neonatal septicaemia during 1981-94 were studied at orebro medical centre hospital, sweden. one hundred and thirty-two children fulfilled laboratory and clinical criteria for neonatal septicaemia and were included. staphylococcus  aureus (n = 41), group b streptococcus (gbs) (n = 32) and coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons) (n = 27) were the dominating aetiologies. the annual incidence of septicaemia increased significantly, from 2.3 cases during the first 7-year period to 3.3 per 1000 live births during 1988-94. this increase was caused by s. aureus and cons, which mainly affected premature children and had an onset more than 48 h after delivery. gbs, on the other hand, slightly decreased and affected full-term children within 48 h. the overall mortality was 11%. cons  isolated during the latter 7-year period were more resistant to antibiotics than  those isolated during 1981-87; resistance to methicillin increased from 14 to 45% and to gentamicin from 0 to 20%. these changes in aetiology and antibiotic susceptibility should be considered when selecting antibiotic treatment in neonatal septicaemia.

TI  == sequence analysis and characterization of pom1, a small cryptic plasmid from butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, and its use in construction of a new family of cloning vectors for butyrivibrios.
AB  == as a preliminary step in the development of vector systems, we have isolated and  begun to characterize small, cryptic plasmids from several strains of the rumen bacterium butyrivibrio fibrisolvens. we present here the complete nucleotide sequence of butyrivibrio plasmid pom1, which was isolated from b. fibrisolvens bu49. while it is very similar in size to the previously characterized butyrivibrio plasmids prjf1 and prjf2, pom1 exhibits a restriction pattern which  is quite distinct. analysis of sequence data reveals that pom1 contains only two  open reading frames of significant length (orf1 and orf2), both of which are required for self-replication and maintenance. the protein encoded in orf1 shows  homologies with pre (plasmid recombination enzyme) proteins encoded in plasmids from gram-positive organisms such as staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, lactobacillus plantarum, and bacillus thuringiensis. the putative translation product of orf2, on the other hand, resembles rep (replication) proteins of a different group of gram-positive plasmids, for which the staphylococcus plasmid psn2 is a prototype. unlike the other characterized-butyrivibrio plasmids, pom1 appears to replicate via a rolling-circle mechanism. experimental evidence showing the presence of a single-stranded replication intermediate consistent with this mechanism is presented. pom1 has been used in the construction of a new escherichia coli-b. fibrisolvens shuttle vector, psmerm1, which has been successfully used to introduce a cloned gene into b. fibrisolvens harboring the prjf1 plasmid.

AB  == objectives: to develop a reference database for characterization of bovine staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus agalactiae strains by automated ribotyping and to use it to assess the discriminatory power of this typing procedure and the geographic distribution of sta aureus and str agalactiae strains in new york state dairy herds. sample population: 22 commercial dairy herds. procedure: isolates of sta aureus and str agalactiae from bovine milk were identified by standard bacteriologic procedures, then typed by automated ribotyping. antimicrobial susceptibility of isolates was tested in vitro. two indicators made from the data were percentage of farms with multiple ribotypes and percentage of single ribotypes found in several geographic regions. standard  bacteriologic diagnosis, automated ribotyping, and determination of antibiograms  (kirby-bauer method) also were done. results: of 50 sta aureus and 44 str agalactiae isolates from composite milk samples of 12 and 10 herds, respectively, 18 and 14 ribotypes, respectively, were identified. the discriminatory power of automated ribotyping was approximately 0.96 (hunter-gaston's formula). a higher percentage of herds with sta aureus had multiple ribotypes. the most common sta aureus ribotypes tended to have broader geographic distribution. some sta aureus  ribotypes were significantly associated with antibiotic resistance profiles. conclusions: automated ribotyping appears to characterize bovine strains of bacteria associated with intramammary infections with a high discriminatory index. potential applications include identification of strains that appear to have broad geographic distribution suggesting interfarm transfer, discrimination  between recurrent versus new intramammary infections (ie, for control of str agalactiae and sta aureus), and evaluation of antibiotic therapy.

TI  == [a method for estimating the prevalence of mammary staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus agalactiae infections in herds based on an examination of bulk milk samples].
AB  == parallel quantitative determination executed in 92 herds at 107 sampling dates was focused on the counts of major pathogens (staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae) in bulk milk samples and on the prevalence of the above pathogens in a herd by examination of individual milk samples. the counts of main pathogens were also determined in terms of quantity in rinsing water before milking and in bulk samples in 5 herds with pipeline milking. tab. i shows the qualitative analysis of the relation. sensitivity of the method is satisfactory for the pathogens observed (95% and 91%, resp.), but method is less specific for  staph. aureus (67% against 92% str. agalactiae). figs. 1 and 2 show coordinate graphs of the results obtained while figs. 3 and 4 document the distribution of frequency of the particular values in data sets. the values do not exhibit normal distribution (p < 0.01). spearman's coefficient of rank correlation of bulk milk  and individual examinations amounted to 0.823 and 0.900 for staph. aureus and str. agalactiae, respectively. four mathematical models were tested in the course of quantitative analysis, describing the relation between bulk milk examination and individual examination: (1) linear regression, (2) linear regression with fixed starting point, (3) logarithmic regression and (4) irrational function. a model based on the equation of irrational function (4) was found to be best: y =  a + bx + c square root of x + k +/- a1 + i(t)c1 square root of x + k1. tab. ii shows the parameters of the equation for examined microorganisms. correlation coefficients for the above equation are r = 0.733 and r = 0.842 for staph. aureus and str. agalactiae, respectively. prediction curves (figs. 5 to 8) and confidence regions of prediction curves were also determined for the best model,  and a prediction table was constructed (tab. iii). it was confirmed that the milking machines were not a significant source of direct contamination of bulk milk samples with the examined pathogens (tab. v).

TI  == cloning and sequencing of the hyaluronate lyase gene from propionibacterium acnes.
AB  == the hyaluronate lyase (hyaluronidase) gene from propionibacterium acnes was cloned and sequenced. the gene was isolated on an ecori-generated 3-kb piece of dna. expression was less in escherichia coli than in p. acnes; in e. coli, active enzyme was only cell associated and not secreted. the gene is 2256-pb long and codes for a protein of 82 kda. amino terminal sequencing of the protein of the partially purified gene indicated the presence of a 32-amino-acid leader sequence. the leader sequence showed a membrane-spanning domain and all of the features usually associated with the leader for a secreted protein. the amino acid sequence is predicted to share homology with the hyaluronidase enzymes from  streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus agalactiae, and staphylococcus aureus. a  potential hyaluronate-binding domain was identified and antibody against this domain was inhibitory to the enzyme.

TI  == frequency, risk factors, and outcome for bacteremia after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty.
AB  == the objectives of this study were to examine bacteremias after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (ptca) with respect to incidence, outcome, and  risk factors. patients undergoing ptca from january 1990 through april 1994 were  studied; during this period a total of 4,217 ptcas were performed in 3,473 patients. with use of predefined clinical and microbiologic criteria, bacteremias were divided into 3 categories according to the relation to the ptca procedure: ptca-related, unrelated, and indeterminate. ninety-one patients with at least 1 positive blood culture during a 7-week period after ptca were identified. the bacteremia was classified as unrelated to the ptca procedure in 32 patients, ptca-related in 27, and indeterminant in the remaining 32 patients. the attack rate of ptca-related bacteremia during the 52-month period was 0.64%. the most common organisms causing ptca-related bacteremia were staphylococcus aureus (14 patients), coagulase-negative staphylococci (9 patients) and group b streptococci (6 patients). septic complications, which included femoral artery mycotic aneurysm, septic arthritis, and septic thrombosis, occurred in 10 patients (0.24%). independent risk factors for ptca-related bacteremia included duration of procedure (odds ratio [or] 2.9; p = 0.04), number of catheterizations at the same site (or 4.0; p = 0.015), difficult vascular access (or 14.9; p = 0.007), arterial sheath in place > 1 day (or 6.8; p = 0.025), congestive heart failure (or 43.3; p = 0.002). thus, ptca-related bacteremia is an infrequent complication of ptca but can be associated with significant morbidity, particularly when the infecting organism is s. aureus. four of the 5 risk factors for ptca-related bacteremia appear to correlate directly with increased vascular injury or maintenance of the arterial entry for the procedure.

TI  == [comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (1995). i. susceptibility distribution].
AB  == the frequencies of isolation and susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents were investigated on 704 bacterial strains isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (utis) in 11 hospitals during the period of june 1995 to may 1996. of  the above bacterial isolates, gram-positive bacteria accounted for 29.8% and a majority of them were enterococcus faecalis. gram-negative bacteria accounted for 70.2% and most of them were escherichia coli. susceptibilities of several isolated bacteria to antimicrobial agents were as followed; 1. enterococcus faecalis ampicillin (abpc) and imipenem (ipm) showed the highest activities against e. faecalis isolated from patients with utis. the mic90s of them were 1 microgram/ml. vancomycin (vcm) and piperacillin (pipc) were also active with the  mic90s of 2 micrograms/ml and 4 micrograms/ml, respectively. the others had low activities with the mic90s of 16 micrograms/ml or above. 2. staphylococcus aureus including mrsa vcm showed the highest activities against s. aureus isolated from  patients with utis. its mic90 was 1 microgram/ml against both s. aureus and mrsa. arbekacin (abk) was also active with the mic90 of 2 micrograms/ml. the other except minocycline (mino) had very low activities with the mic90s of 64 micrograms/ml or above. 3. staphylococcus epidermidis abk and mino showed the strongest activities against s. epidermidis isolated from patients with utis. the mic90s of them were 0.25 microgram/ml. vcm was also active with the mic90 of 1 microgram/ml. the mic90s of cephems ranged from 2 micrograms/ml to 16 micrograms/ml in 1994, but they ranged from 8 micrograms/ml to 128 micrograms/ml  in 1995. these results indicated that some resistances existed among s. epidermidis to cephems. 4. streptococcus agalactiae all drugs except gentamicin (gm) were active against s. agalactiae. abpc, cefmenoxime (cmx), ipm, erythromycin (em), clindamycin (cldm) and clarithromycin (cam) showed the highest activities. the mics for all strains were lower than 0.125 microgram/ml. the mic90s of the others were 2 micrograms/ml or below. 5. citrobacter freundii ipm showed the highest activity against c. freundii isolated from patients utis. its  mic90 was 1 microgram/ml. gm was also active with the mic90 of 2 micrograms/ml. cefpirome (cpr), cefozopran (czop) and amikacin (amk) were also active with the mic90s of 4 micrograms/ml. penicillins and cephems except cmx, cpr and czop showed low activities with mic90s of 256 micrograms/ml or above. 6. enterobacter  cloacae ipm showed the highest activity against e. cloacae. the mics for all strains were equal to or lower than 1 microgram/ml. mino and tosufloxacin (tflx)  were also active with the mic90s of 8 micrograms/ml. penicillins and cephems except cpr and czop showed lower activities with the mic90s of 256 micrograms/ml  or above. 7. escherichia coli. most of the antimicrobial agents were active against e. coli. particularly cpr, czop and ipm showed the highest activities against e. coli. the mics for all strains were equal to or lower than 0.5 microgram/ml. cmx and tflx were also active with the mic90s of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. penicillins were slightly active with mic90s of 128 micrograms/ml or above. 8. klebsiella pneumoniae k. pneumoniae was susceptible to all drugs except penicillins, with mic90s of 2 micrograms/ml or below. carumonam (crmn) had the strongest activity against k. pneumoniae, the mics for all strains were equal to  or lower than 0.125 microgram/ml. comparing with the result of 1994, the sensitivities of k. pneumoniae against all drugs had obviously changed into a better state. for example, the mic90s of cephems ranged from 0.25 microgram/ml to 16 micrograms/ml in 1994, but they were all lower than 2 micrograms/ml in 1995. 9. proteus mirabilis p. mirabilis was susceptible to a majority of drugs. cmx, ceftazidime (caz), cefixime (cfix), and crmn showed the highest activities against p. mirabilis isolated from patients with utis. mics of crmn for all

TI  == [validation of tkt medium for detection of streptococcus agalactiae in bulk milk  samples].
AB  == a selective medium for quantitative determination of streptococcus agalactiae in  bulk milk samples was tested. among the medium bases, edwards medium (ew) supplemented with 6 to 9% (v/v) of carefully washed sheep erythrocytes was proved to be best (tab. v). the production of sphingomyelinasis c (bhe, tab. ii) or d (corex, tab. i) as a supplement supporting the formation of specific hemolytic zones in the medium, was tested in four strains of staphylococcus aureus and seven strains of corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis. submersion aerated cultivation was used for enzyme production; optimum cultivation time is about 100 hours (figs. 1, 2). to determine the activity of the enzymes produced a screening method was developed applying hemolytic interactions with camp factor of str. agalactiae. method sensitivity and reproducibility are sufficiently high for the  purposes of observation (tab. iii). the produced enzymes did not show any changes in their activity over the whole period of storage under all conditions of storage (32 days/7 degrees c, 48 weeks/-18 degrees c, lyophilizate 48 weeks/20 degrees c). sphingomyelinasis c is more resistant to heat denaturation, not losing its activity even after being warmed to 85 degrees c for 5 min; sphingomyelinasis d is sensitive to temperatures higher than 50 degrees c (fig. 3). corex was selected (sphingomyelinasis d), produced by the strain cntcc 18/62  of c. pseudotuberculosis. the enzyme was applied either in raw filtrate of the medium (sterilization by repeated membrane filtration) or in prepurified form obtained by cold acetone precipitation, providing the same results. the medium is highly specific and likely enough selective for str. agalactiae, unlike bhe it does not provide any positive results with uberis-factor+strains of str. uberis (tab. v). optimum cultivation time is 18 hours; prolongation of cultivation for more than 24 hours brings about the risk of falsely positive readings (tab. vi) in the strains of accompanying microflora (morganella morganii ssp. morganii, delta-hemolytic staphylococci).

AB  == antimicrobial susceptibility testing was conducted on a variety of mastitis pathogens. the infected quarters were subsequently treated during lactation with  a commercially available product containing penicillin and novobiocin that was designed for lactating cows. cows were treated as per the recommendations of the  product manufacturer, and cures were determined by the absence of bacteria in both sets of duplicate quarter milk samples that were collected at 28 d posttreatment. comparisons were made between the susceptibility of the bacteria and the therapeutic success or failure. all isolates tested were considered to be susceptible to the penicillin and novobiocin combination. bacteriologic cure rates for newly acquired staphylococcus aureus intramammary infection (imi) (< 2  wk in duration) at 28 d posttreatment were 70%. cure rates for chronic staph. aureus imi (> 4 wk duration) were much lower (35%), reaffirming previous reports  of the intractable nature of chronic staph. aureus imi. cure rates for subclinical imi caused by other organisms were 90% for streptococcus agalactiae,  91% for streptococcus uberis, 90% for streptococcus dysgalactiae, 77% for other streptococcus spp., and 71% for staphylococcus spp. other than staph. aureus. in  vitro testing was considered to be a predictor of therapy outcome for imi caused  by staphylococcus spp., newly acquired staph. aureus, strep. uberis, strep. dysgalactiae, and strep. agalactiae, but was not considered to be a useful predictor of efficacy for chronic imi caused by staph. aureus.

AB  == we evaluated the usefulness of cefpodoxime proxetil (cpdx-pr) in the treatment of puerperal infection and obtained the following results. (i) the susceptibilities  of 124 clinical isolates from 85 uterine lochia samples were determined. the mic  at which the growth of streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, and bacteroides fragilis isolates was inhibited by 90% (mic90) was 0.39 micrograms/ml or less. the mic90 for staphylococcus aureus was 3.13 micrograms/ml. (ii) seven puerperal women received 200 mg of cpdx-pr orally. the cpdx concentration in the  lochias in the uterine cavity was not statistically different from that in the vagina, suggesting that the vaginal samples, which can be obtained more safely and aseptically, can be substituted for the uterine samples. the cpdx concentration in cubital venous blood reached a peak of 1.61 micrograms/ml at 3 hours after cpdx-pr administration. the cpdx concentration in the lochias gradually increased and reached a peak of 1.20 micrograms/ml in the uterine cavity and 1.27 micrograms/ml in the vagina at 5 h after drug administration and  gradually declined thereafter. these results suggest that cpdx-pr, with its good  transfer to the lochia and its potent antimicrobial activity, is a promising drug for the prophylactic and therapeutic treatment of puerperal infections caused by  susceptible organisms.

AB  == streptococcus agalactiae b128 is the only highly gentamicin-resistant group b streptococcal (gbs) strain described so far. this strain carries a chromosomal gentamicin resistance transposon, designated tn3706, which is similar, if not identical, to the tn4001 and tn5281 transpons detected in staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis, respectively. transposition of tn3706 occurred onto the gbs plasmid pip501 in two different loci of its 7.5-kb avaii fragment carrying the genes for chloramphenicol and erythromycin resistance. molecular analysis of pip501 derivatives showed that tn3706 is composed of a central fragment containing the aac6'-aph2" gene; this fragment is flanked by two tandemly repeated copies of is256 at the 5' extremity of the resistance gene and  a single inverted copy of is256 at its 3' extremity. the two tandemly repeated copies of is256 were separated by a 6-bp segment identical to that found, in the  same orientation, in the is256-aac6'-aph2" junction. the hybrid replicons pip501::tn3706 were found to be structurally unstable following conjugative transfer between gbs strains. numerous individual copies of is256 were detected in b128, but this insertion sequence was not found in the 11 wild-type, gentamicin-susceptible gbs strains studied.

AB  == objective: to evaluate efficacy of florfenicol treatment for bovine mastitis caused by streptococcus agalactiae, staphylococcus aureus nonagalactiae streptococci, coagulase-negative staphylococci, escherichia coli, klebsiella sp,  and others. design: double blind study with cases randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups. sample population: 861 cows/10 commercial dairy farms. procedure: experimental (750 mg of florfenicol) or control (200 mg of cloxacillin) treatment was administered by intramammary infusion every 12 hours for 3 treatment to all cases. treatments were randomly assigned identified only by numerical labels. to retain blinding, the longer withdrawal time was adhered to for all cases. cases remained in the study only if there was no other treatment. quarter samples were recultured 14, 21, and 28 days later. if all samples after day 1 were culture negative, the case was defined as cured. if only 1 of the follow-up results was positive, the case was considered cured if the day-28 somatic cell count was < 300,000/ ml. failure of treatment was defined as  2 or more culture positive follow-up samples. results: florfenicol and cloxacillin did not differ significantly in efficacy versus clinical (n = 85) or  subclinical (n = 71) bovine mastitis, or for any etiologic agent (x2). overall cure rates for mastitis were: str agalactiae, 5 of 8 (63%); sta aureus, 5 of 54 (9%); streptococcus sp, 16 of 35 (46%); staphylococcus sp, 7 of 33 (21%); e coli, 5 of 11 (46%); klebsiella sp, 3 of 6 (50%); others, 1 of 9 (11%); and all cases,  42 of 156 (27%). conclusions: florfenicol did not offer any advantage over cloxacillin in efficacy against bovine mastitis. overall cure rates were low. as  with most mastitis treatment regimens poor efficacy may be partly attributable to the short duration of treatment.

TI  == identification and characterization of the eps (exopolysaccharide) gene cluster from streptococcus thermophilus sfi6.
AB  == we report the identification and characterization of the eps gene cluster of streptococcus thermophilus sfi6 required for exopolysaccharide (eps) synthesis. this report is the first genetic work concerning eps production in a food microorganism. the eps secreted by this strain consists of the following tetrasaccharide repeating unit:-->3)-beta-d-galp-(1-->3)-[alpha-d-galp-(1-->6)]-beta-d- d-galp-(1-->3)-alpha-d-galp-d-galpnac-(1-->. the genetic locus the genetic locus  was identified by tn916 mutagenesis in combination with a plate assay to identify eps mutants. sequence analysis of the gene region, which was obtained from subclones of a genomic library of sfi6, revealed a 15.25-kb region encoding 15 open reading frames. eps expression in the non-eps-producing heterologous host, lactococcus lactis mg1363, showed that within the 15.25-kb region, a region with  a size of 14.52 kb encoding the 13 genes epsa to epsm was capable of directing eps synthesis and secretion in this host. homology searches of the predicted proteins in the swiss-prot database revealed high homology (40 to 68% identity) for epsa, b, c, d, and e and the genes involved in capsule synthesis in streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus agalactiae. moderate to low homology (37 to 18% identity) was detected for epsb, d, f, and h and the genes involved in capsule synthesis in staphylococcus aureus for epsc, d, and e and the genes involved in exopolysaccharide i (epsi) synthesis in rhizobium meliloti for epsc to epsj and the genes involved in lipopolysaccharide synthesis in members of the  enterobacteriaceae, and finally for eps k and lipb of neisseria meningitidis. genes (epsj, epsl, and epsm) for which the predicted proteins showed little or no homology with proteins in the swiss-prot database were shown to be involved in eps synthesis by single-crossover gene disruption experiments.

TI  == diffusion of 3-quaternary ammonium cephem antibiotics into cerebrospinal fluid of patients with bacterial meningitis.
AB  == cefepime and cefpirome are new beta-lactamase resistant parenteral cephalosporin  derivatives whose spectrum of activity makes them suitable for use in the treatment of severe infections such as bacterial meningitis. however, the published information on the penetration of these new agents into human csf and on their use in the treatment of bacterial meningitis are really scarce. experimental studies have shown that cefepime and cefpirome penetrated remarkably well into the csf of animals infected with streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus agalactiae, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae type b or pseudomonas aeruginosa. the mean changes in bacterial colony count in csf after cefpirome or cefepime administration express the antibacterial activity of these drugs. studies in patients show that cefepime and cefpirome crossed the blood-brain barrier and reached concentrations in the csf that are bactericidal against most potential pathogens. higher levels are likely to be achieved with multiple dosing and in the presence of inflamed meninges. no study has been performed to investigate the efficacy of cefpirome in the treatment of bacterial meningitis. cefepime was as effective and safe as cefotaxime for treatment of patients with bacterial meningitis as shown in the only clinical trial.

TI  == effects of freezing on the viability of nine pathogens from quarters with subclinical mastitis.
AB  == milk samples from 45 quarters containing mastitis pathogens were collected from lactating cows to determine the viability of those pathogens after freezing. an initial bacteria count was conducted, and samples were divided into 2-ml portions and frozen. weekly bacteria counts were conducted for 6 wk. viability after freezing was determined on five isolates of nine bacterial species: staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus hyicus, staphylococcus chromogenes, staphylococcus xylosus, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus dysgalactiae, streptococcus uberis, corynebacterium bovis, and escherichia coli. bacteria counts were converted to logarithm base 10, and analysis of variance was conducted to determine alterations in viability over the 6-wk period. freezing of quarter milk samples for 6 wk did not affect viability of any of these pathogens.

TI  == [treatment of osteomyelitis with oral bactericidal antibiotics-- description of 9 cases].
AB  == the efficacy of oral bactericidal antibiotics in the treatment of osteomyelitis is analyzed retrospectively by a review of 9 cases histories. the first patient was treated in 1982. clinical and laboratory controls were reviewed up to 1.1.1995. in 6 patients s. aureus was isolated, while in 3 patients the organism  could not be cultured but gram + cocci were almost likely. 5 cases of osteomyelitis were acute, 4 were chronic and in one case there was an infection of an artificial knee prothesis. the isolated s. aureus were sensitive to the antibiotics prescribed. 8 patients received a combination of flucloxacillin (2-4  g/day) and rifampicin (600 mg/day); one patient was treated with the combination  amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (1500/425 mg/day) followed by ofloxacin (400 mg/day)  and finally co-trimoxazole (320/1600 mg/day). 3 patients received all antibiotics orally; in 6 patients oral administration followed a short intravenous course of  the antibiotic combination. the duration of treatment varied between 6 and 23 weeks. follow-up extended over 9 months (n = 1), 14 months (n = 3), 4-7 years (n  = 3), and 10-12 years (n = 2). in 8 cases the osteomyelitis was cured (89%). in our view, a combination of bactericidal oral antibiotics with good penetration into bone tissue can be prescribed in selected cases of osteomyelitis to shorten  or even avoid the standard intravenous therapy of acute or chronic diseases.

TI  == staphylococcus aureus skin colonization in infants with atopic dermatitis.
AB  == background: coagulase-positive staphylococcus aureus colonizes eczematous lesions in 78-100% of children and adults with atopic dermatitis (ad), whereas it is found on skin of healthy subjects in only 2-25% of cases. on unaffected skin of subjects with ad the bacterium has been isolated in 51-100% of cases. objective and methods: this paper examines rate and density of s. aureus colonization, using the swab technique and the contact plate method, respectively, on affected  and unaffected skin in 72 infants with ad (age 3-24 months) and in a control group, to determine if there are significant differences with respect to what is  reported for children and adults with ad. results and conclusions: the main differences is that on unaffected skin of our infants with ad, bacterium colonization rate is significantly lower than on affected skin.

TI  == effects of different surfactant preparations on bacterial growth in vitro.
AB  == several lines of evidence suggest that surfactant and surfactant proteins may have direct effects on inhaled bacteria and are able to interact with lung defence mechanisms in many ways. we examined the effect of three different surfactant preparations (alveofact, survanta and exosurf) approved for treatment  of the infant respiratory distress syndrome on different strains of escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and streptococcus agalactiae which are important neonatal pathogens and on legionella pneumophila serogroup i as a frequent cause of pneumonia in adults. addition of survanta to saline seemed to delay the reduction of viable bacteria in sterile saline and induced a considerably accelerated growth of all examined e. coli strains. as opposed to this, addition of surfactant did not influence the kinetics of bacterial growth in brain-heart infusion or buffered yeast extract both with the  exception of exosurf which exerted an inhibitory effect on the multiplication of  group b streptococci. though the exact mechanisms underlying these effects remain to be determined, the influence of surfactant therapy on the growth of bacteria within the respiratory tract should be taken into account.

TI  == clinical and diagnostic features of osteomyelitis occurring in the first three months of life.
AB  == we report a retrospective study of 94 infants, ages < 4 months, who underwent investigation for possible osteomyelitis during a 9-year period. of the 30 babies with proven osteomyelitis (radiographic changes or positive bone cultures or positive blood cultures plus a compatible clinical picture), 17 were preterm artificially ventilated babies and 4 were full term infants receiving intensive care. an etiologic organism was isolated from 28: methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, 16; methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), 7; escherichia coli, 3; and group b streptococcus, 2. mrsa occurred exclusively in the preterm group. osteomyelitis was multifocal in 40% and associated with septic arthritis in 47%. the long bones were frequently affected (80%) whereas the flat bones were often sites of clinically silent disease. twenty-five (83.3%) of the 30 babies with proven osteomyelitis had focal clinical signs or evidence of disseminated staphylococcal disease. only 10 were febrile. four of 27 babies investigated because of positive blood cultures for s. aureus but no focal signs had osteomyelitis, as did only 1 of 27 babies with suspected sepsis but no focal signs. the sensitivity of 99mtc bone scanning was 84%, specificity 89%, positive  predictive value 79% and negative predictive value 92%. the addition of gallium scanning (in 39 of the 94 infants) improved the respective figures to 90, 97, 93  and 95% and was useful in interpreting equivocal bone scans.

TI  == partial characterization of the cohemolytic factor produced by streptococcus uberis and comparison with the camp-factor.
AB  == exosubstances (cohemolysins) produced by streptococcus agalactiae (camp-factor) and streptococcus uberis (uberis-factor) showing hemolytic synergism with beta-lysin produced by staphylococcus aureus were compared. cohemolytic activity  was evaluated in the supernatants of bacterial cultures, before and after ammonium sulfate precipitation. sheep erythrocytes sensitized with beta-lysin were used as substrate. the assays were performed in microtiter plates and results were expressed as cohemolytic units/ml. maximum cohemolytic activity was  detected, respectively, after 8 h and 14 h of growth in columbia broth in s. uberis and s. agalactiae cultures. cohemolytic activities of both microorganisms  showed similarities when submitted to various physical and chemical treatments. they were significantly decreased by heating at 60 degrees c and 100 degrees c, or in presence of trypsin, and were abolished in the presence of tween 20. activities were found to be stable in crude supernatants and concentrated preparations maintained at -20 degrees c for 3 months. differences were related to levels of activity and kinetics of detection during the growth cycle. the results indicate the proteic nature, at least in part, of the uberis factor. analysis by page in the presence or absence of sds allowed us to correlate uberis activity with a protein band with apparent molecular mass of 42 kda, while camp activity was associated with a protein band of 27 kda.

AB  == two barrier teat dips were evaluated for efficacy in preventing new imi by staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus agalactiae during experimental exposure trials, and two barrier dips were evaluated during natural exposure trials. dipping in an experimental product containing nicin as a germicide using experimental exposure demonstrated no difference in rate of new staph. aureus imi (10.2%) compared with that of controls (7.1%) or in the rate of new strep. agalactiae imi (13.6%) compared with that of controls (11%). testing of an experimental .55% chlorhexidine gluconate barrier dip using experimental exposure resulted in an increased rate of new staph. aureus imi compared with that of controls (4.8 vs. 1.7%, respectively), but no difference in the rate of new strep. agalactiae imi in dipped quarters (6.1%) compared with that of controls (3.3%). dipping with a commercial .3% iodine barrier dip during natural exposure  increased the number of new coagulase-negative staphylococcal and total imi by 56.6 and 30.6%, respectively, compared with a 1% iodophor dip without barrier. use of an experimental .3% iodine barrier dip during natural exposure demonstrated no difference in total rate of new imi (18.4%) compared with that of controls (20.3%); however, after germicide concentration was increased to .5% iodine and further tested, the reformulated product reduced new imi by 43.1%. under the conditions of these trials, the barrier teat dips tested were no more efficacious than no teat dip or using a nonbarrier product.

TI  == bactericidal activity of the bovine myeloperoxidase system against bacteria associated with mastitis.
AB  == myeloperoxidase (mpo) is a lysosomal enzyme found in the primary granules of mammalian neutrophils. together with mpo, peroxide and halide form a system of defense against bacteria. the present investigation was undertaken to study the bactericidal effects of the bovine-mpo/peroxide/halide system on pathogenic bacteria associated with bovine mastitis. we demonstrated that mpo together with  oxidizing agents generated by xanthine oxidase, hypoxanthine and chloride form a  potent antibacterial system against the common udder pathogens staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus uberis, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus dysgalactiae and escherichia coli in a synthetic medium. however, when milk was added to the reaction mixture, the bactericidal properties of this enzyme system  were completely inhibited. loss of bactericidal activity in the milk-containing cultures was unable to be restored by increasing the concentration of mpo. nor did an increase in concentrations of hypoxanthine and xanthine oxidase, or the replacement of the above-mentioned peroxidase generating system with a high concentration of hydrogen peroxide, significantly elevated the bactericidal activity that was inhibited by milk. the addition of bovine serum albumin to the  synthetic medium reduced the bactericidal activity of the mpo/peroxide/chloride system in a dose-dependent manner. therefore, milk proteins probably form adducts with strong bactericidal agents that are generated by the mpo system and thereby  reduce the bactericidal potential of this system.

AB  == the herd health approach for dairy herds with a high bulk milk somatic cell count, in which streptococcus agalactiae plays a major role, was evaluated. after introduction of the standard mastitis prevention programme, all quarters of infected cows were treated during lactation. in three of the four herds investigated, the bulk milk somatic cell count dropped below the limit of 400,000 cells/ml for a long period of time. the herd in which there were many infections  with staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus agalactiae was an exception. the management, somatic cell count, and prevalence of subclinical mastitis in the different herds is discussed. it is concluded that for infection with streptococcus agalactiae at the herd level, treatment during lactation can be an  effective method to lower the bulk milk somatic cell count. in essence, however,  the approach to the problem lies in the standard mastitis prevention programme.

AB  == an internal fragment representing approximately 85% of sod genes from seven gram-positive bacteria was amplified by using degenerate primers in a polymerase  chain reaction assay. the dna sequences of sod polymerase chain reaction products from clostridium perfringens, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, lactococcus lactis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae, and streptococcus pyogenes were determined. comparisons of their deduced amino acid sequences with those of the corresponding regions of  the sod proteins from bacillus stearothermophilus, listeria monocytogenes, and streptococcus mutans revealed strong relatedness. phylogenetic analysis of sod peptides showed that members of the genera streptococcus and those of the genera  enterococcus constitute two well-supported monophyletic groups. the method described in this study provides a means for easy recovery of sod genes and the construction of sod mutants of various gram-positive pathogens.

TI  == [reliability of bacteriological studies of composite samples in the diagnosis of  subclinical udder infections in cattle].
AB  == this study evaluated the reliability of making bacteriological cultures of composite milk samples for the diagnosis of subclinical udder infections in dairy herds. quarter samples as well as composite samples were collected from 482 cows  with suspected subclinical mastitis from 69 dutch dairy farms. the samples were used to measured somatic cell counts and to prepare bacteriological cultures. the sensitivity and specificity of the bacteriological cultures of the composite samples were compared with those of the quarter samples. the sensitivity of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus uberis, streptococcus agalactiae and streptococcus dysgalactiae was 57.9%, 65.2%, 86.6%, and 60.3%, respectively. the  specificity was higher than 98% for all four bacteria. although information is lost when composite samples are used, composite samples are useful, especially for large dairy herds. the advantage and disadvantages of the use of composite samples are discussed.

TI  == [udder disinfection and mastitis in cattle: a literature review].
AB  == postmilking teat disinfection is accepted as an important part of standard preventive measures against mastitis in dairy cattle. the efficacy of postmilking teat disinfection against infections with contagious pathogens such as staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus agalactiae is beyond doubt. however, the  efficacy of teat disinfection against infections with environmental pathogens such as escherichia coli is disputed, and a negative effect has even been described in some situations. this article reviews the practice of teat disinfection in dairy cattle. premilking and postmilking teat disinfection are discussed, as is the efficacy, different ways of teat disinfection, and different disinfectants. it is concluded that post-milking teat disinfection is an effective management measure in most herds. selection of teat disinfectants should be based on proven efficacy, which is required for registration of the preparation as a veterinary medical product in the netherlands.

AB  == mammary secretions, obtained before and after calving, were examined for visual appearance, scc, and bacteriology as part of a larger study determining the prevalence of imi in 1588 primigravid heifers. appearance of secretions was categorized into five groups: thin and watery, honey-like, serumy, milky, or thickened colostrum. precalving secretions were further characterized as low viscosity (thin and watery, serumy, or milky) or high viscosity (honey-like and thickened colostrum). postcalving secretions were further characterized as normal (milky, thickened colostrum) or abnormal (thin and watery, serumy, or honey-like). infected precalving quarters (81%) had low viscosity secretions. quarters that were uninfected precalving (75%) had high viscosity secretions. greater than 90% of all postcalving milk samples appeared to be normal, regardless of geographic location, season, or bacterial infection status. only 77% of the samples from quarters infected with contagious and noncontagious mastitis pathogens had normal appearance. precalving scc from bacteriologically negative quarters were lower than scc from infected quarters. similarly, postcalving scc were lower from the bacteriologically negative quarters than from the infected quarters. infected quarters had higher mean scc than the uninfected  quarters during both pre- and postcalving periods.

TI  == development of a direct viable count procedure for some gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == the direct viable count (dvc) is a procedure for enumerating viable-nonculturable cells. it should be noted, however, that bacteria demonstrating the viable but nonculturable phase have to date included only gram-negative species, mainly because the dvc procedure does not lend itself to the analysis of gram-positive bacteria since the dvc procedure is dependent on the bacterium being sensitive to nalidixic acid. the authors report here concerning studies on an analogous procedure for the direct enumeration of viable-nonculturable gram-positive bacteria. to facilitate a differential dvc for gram-positive bacteria, ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, norfloxacin or isopropyl cinodine were substituted for nalidixic acid. these antibiotics were chosen because, like nalidixic acid, they  are dna gyrase inhibitors. the concentrations used for each antibiotic were 1000  micrograms ml-1, 100 micrograms ml-1. pure cultures of staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus agalactiae, listeria monocytogenes and bacillus subtilis were obtained from the culture collection at the university of  wyoming and a faecal streptococcus was isolated from the laramie wastewater treatment plant. an antibiotic and optimal concentration thereof was found which  gave enlarged cells for all the organisms except the faecal streptococcus isolated from the wastewater plant for which no enlarged cells were ever seen. the antibiotic and concentration thereof which gave the optimal percent enlarged  cells in the dvc procedure varied between organisms.

AB  == introduction: the aim of this study was: 1) to evaluate the rate of micro-organism isolation in 100 patients consulting for balanitis at the centre of sexually transmitted diseases at the st. louis hospital in paris in comparison with that of micro-organisms isolated in 60 men without balanitis; 2) to search for a possible correlation between the clinical aspect of the disease and the nature of the infectious agent identified. methods: one hundred consecutive patients were included in the study. all underwent a clinical examination and samples were taken for bacteriology, mycology and virology examinations. sixty healthy volunteers served as controls. two samples were taken from the balanopreputial groove in search for fungi and bacteria. results: candida albicans (ca) was isolated in 33 p. 100 of the patients. a pathogenic bacteria (beta-haemolytic streptococci, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella), or a potentially pathogenic germ (haemophilus parainfluenzae, anaerobic bacteria, gardnerella vaginalis, streptococcus milleri, group hb5) was found without ca in  28 p. 100 of the cases, a commensal flora (enterobacteria, group d streptococci)  was found without ca in 8 p. 100 and in 31 p. 100 of the cases non causal agent could be identified. discussion: this series confirms the non-pathogenic nature of commensal bacteria: the number of isolations was similar in the subjects with  and without balanitis (p < 0.9). the role played by the other bacteria in the development of balanitis is discussed: saprophytic association or direct pathogenesis? the significant difference in the rate of bacteria isolations in patients with balanitis compared with controls (p < 0.001) is in favour of a pathogenic role. the clinical presentation was not predictive of the presence of  any particular micro-organism excepting the presence of pustules which were highly suggestive of candidiasis.

TI  == relations between udder infection and somatic cells in camel (camelus dromedarius) milk.
AB  == quarter milk samples (n = 391) from 101 camels were examined to study the occurrence and causes of mastitis in traditionally managed camels in eastern sudan and to evaluate the value of the california mastitis test (cmt), somatic cell count (scc) and adenosine triphosphate (atp) in the detection of subclinical mastitis in the camel. one hundred and seventy (43.5%) of the quarter milk samples yielded pathogenic bacteria. streptococcus agalactiae, other streptococcus spp., staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, and  escherichia coli were isolated from milk. thirty-two (8.2%) quarter milk samples  yielded mixed cultures, and 189 (48.3%) yielded no growth. mean values for cmt, scc and atp were higher for quarters infected with major pathogens. however, a significant number of quarter milk samples had elevated values in these tests but were from quarters from which no bacteria were isolated. the ability of the tests to predict a positive bacteriology increased slightly when 2 or 3 tests were combined.

TI  == a study of mastitis bacteria and herd management practices to identify their relationship to high somatic cell counts in bulk tank milk.
AB  == thirty dairy herds, selected to cover a wide range of bulk tank somatic cell count (btscc) values, were used to study the relationship between the levels of the principal species of mastitis-causing bacteria, herd management practices and the btscc. a good correlation was found between the number of mastitis streptococci (streptococcus agalactiae, s. dysgalactiae and s. uberis) found in bulk tank milk and the btscc. staphylococcus aureus was less significantly correlated to btscc, but was of increasing importance in borderline btscc herds,  where lower excretion levels into milk were unlikely to trigger hygiene penalties and so alert producers to the presence of a significant mastitis problem. high btscc herds had significantly lower yields and were less likely to use a post-milking teat dip or to have a regular programme of milking machine maintenance or automatic cluster removal. these herds also tended to buy in replacements rather than breed their own. overall the management of high btscc herds showed less commitment to implementing mastitis control procedures than herds with a consistently low btscc.

AB  == since septic sacroileitis is one of the less frequent localizations among joint infections, we decided to review 9 cases in a retrospective study of 5 females and 4 males, aged between 22 and 60 years old. none had a clinically predisposing condition. the initiating factor was gynecologic-obstetric in 4 women, the irruption of the skin barrier in 3 cases and finally in one case the infection reached the joint through the psoas muscle. fever and lumbar pain were present in all cases and allowed diagnostic orientation. radiologic and centellographic alterations were useful for clinical confirmation. an articular biopsypunction was performed in 4 cases, while in the other 5 cases the clinical and radiologic  features and the bacteriologic positivity in the blood cultures were enough criteria for diagnosis. the bacteriologic findings were staphylococcus aureus (4  cases), streptococcus group a beta hemolitico (1 case), staphylococcus coagulase  negative (1 case), streptococcus agalactiae (1 case), proteus mirabilis (2 cases). eight out of 9 patients were treated with a b-lactamic and aminoglycoside association. one patient received her treatment per os, with quinolones. six patients recovered, 2 died and one needed to be sent to another hospital.

AB  == the influence of pre-existing staphylococcus sp. imi on development of new imi after experimental challenge with staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus agalactiae was studied. the imi data were analyzed from five trials in which quarters were challenged with major pathogens incident to studies of teat dip efficacy. prior to each trial, quarter imi status was determined, and new imi were enumerated during challenge. percentage of new staph. aureus imi in uninfected quarters was 3-fold that of quarters already infected with staphylococcus sp. of quarters that were initially uninfected, 13.23% acquired new staph. aureus imi, and 4.49% of quarters infected with staphylococcus sp. became infected. conversely, the percentage of new strep. agalactiae imi in quarters infected with staphylococcus sp. was 1.5-fold that of uninfected quarters (8.38 vs. 5.52%). the percentage of clinical staph. aureus imi in uninfected quarters was higher than for quarters infected with staphylococcus sp., but percentages of clinical strep. agalactiae imi were similar among imi statuses. geometric mean scc prior to challenge were 87 x 10(3) for uninfected quarters and 260 x 10(3)/ml for quarters infected with staphylococcus sp. quarters infected with staphylococcus sp. were less susceptible to staph. aureus  imi, but more susceptible to strep. agalactiae imi.

TI  == group b streptococcus-induced nitric oxide production in murine macrophages is cr3 (cd11b/cd18) dependent.
AB  == nitric oxide (no) is produced by murine macrophages in response to cytokines and/or gram-negative bacterial lipopolysaccharide. no induction by gram-positive  bacteria such as group b streptococci (gbs), the major etiologic agents of neonatal pneumonia and meningitis, has received little study. gbs as well as two  other gram-positive bacterial species, staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, were found to stimulate no production in thioglycolate-elicited murine macrophages and in the mouse macrophage cell line j774a.1 in the presence  of gamma interferon. serotype ia and iii gbs were both stimulatory, as were asialo- and type antigen-deficient mutant strains of type iii gbs. no production  was dose dependent, inhibitable by l-arginine analogs, and unaffected by polymyxin b. since phagocytosis by murine and human phagocytes of gbs is dependent on complement receptor type 3 (cr3), the role of cr3 in the no response to gbs was tested in the cr3-deficient myelomonocytic cell line wehi-3. gbs did not induce no, whereas s. aureus or lipopolysaccharide did induce no in wehi-3 cells. s. epidermidis, whose nonopsonic phagocytosis is also cr3 dependent, failed to induce no in wehi-3 cells. monoclonal anti-cr3 (anti-cd11b or anti-cd18) in the presence of interferon also induced no production in thioglycolate-elicited macrophages and in j774a.1 cells but not in wehi-3 cells.  this evidence suggests that ligated cr3 and gamma interferon act synergistically  to induce no production and that cr3 mediates the gbs-induced signal for no production in interferon-treated macrophages.

TI  == the type i macrophage scavenger receptor binds to gram-positive bacteria and recognizes lipoteichoic acid.
AB  == macrophage scavenger receptors exhibit unusually broad binding specificity for polyanionic ligands and have been implicated in atherosclerosis and various host  defense functions. using a radiolabeled, secreted form of the type i bovine macrophage scavenger receptor in an in vitro binding assay, we have found that this receptor binds to intact gram-positive bacteria, including streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus hirae, and listeria monocytogenes. competition binding studies using purified lipoteichoic acid, an anionic polymer expressed on the surface of most gram-positive bacteria, show that lipoteichoic acids are scavenger receptor ligands and probably mediate binding of the receptor to gram-positive bacteria. lipoteichoic acids, for which no host cell receptors have previously been identified, are implicated in the pathogenesis of septic shock due to gram-positive bacteria. scavenger receptors may participate in host defense by clearing lipoteichoic acid and/or intact bacteria from tissues and the circulation during gram-positive sepsis. since scavenger receptors have been previously shown to bind to and facilitate bloodstream clearance of gram-negative bacterial endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide), these receptors may provide a general mechanism for macrophage recognition and internalization of pathogens and their cell surface components.

AB  == several agar media (mueller-hinton agar, mha; diagnostic sensitivity test agar, dsta; schaedler agar, scha; todd-hewitt agar with added yeast extract, thya; wilkins-chalgren agar, wca) were compared using the bauer-kirby agar disk diffusion test against six nonfastidious quality control strains: staphylococcus  aureus atcc 25923 and atcc 29213, escherichia coli atcc 25922 and atcc 35218, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853, and enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212. mha, dsta, and thya yielded essentially comparable inhibition zones. however, wca and  scha antagonized cotrimoxazole and aminoglycoside antibiotics; furthermore, scha  antagonized polymyxin b, and both wca and scha antagonized imipenem against the p. aeruginosa strain, but not against the e. coli strains. sheep blood-mha (bl-mha), wca, thya, and dsta were examined with streptococcus pyogenes atcc 19615, streptococcus agalactiae atcc 13813, and streptococcus pneumoniae atcc 6306. in comparison with bl-mha, both wca and thya yielded comparable inhibition  zones against s. pyogenes; dsta afforded suboptimal growth. dsta yielded larger inhibition zones with the majority of antimicrobial drugs against s. agalactiae,  whereas wca and thya enhanced the activity of oxacillin and penicillin g against  this strain. s. pneumoniae strain atcc 6306 grew well on bl-mha, yielded suboptimal growth on wca and faint growth on thya, and failed to grow on dsta. chocolate-supplemented sheep blood-mha (choc-mha) was compared with haemophilus test medium (htm), wca with added nad, and thya with added hematin and nad against haemophilus influenzae strains atcc 35056 and atcc 49247. the activities  of doxycycline and rifampin were enhanced against both strains by htm, wca+nad, and thya+hematin+nad. only wca+nad antagonized cotrimoxazole against both h. influenzae strains, an effect due to thymidine; however, htm antagonized cotrimoxazole against s. aureus atcc 25923 and e. coli atcc 25922. it was concluded that bl-mha performed best for beta-hemolytic streptococci quality control strains. likewise, choc-mha was optimal for the two h. influenzae strains used in this comparative agar disk diffusion study.

TI  == association af changes in the bacterial ecology of bovine mastitis with changes in the use of milking machines and antibacterial drugs.
AB  == the results of mastitis bacteriology made by the national veterinary and food research institute in finland during the past 50 years (1.15 million samples) are viewed in relation to simultaneous changes in dairy cow management. although intensive preventive measures have been applied for decades, the prevalence of bovine mastitis has not decreased. instead, pathogenic bacteria are becoming progressively less susceptible to the available therapy. in part this must be due to the emergence of antibiotic resistant strains of bacteria, but it seems that the bacterial spectrum has also changed. the incidence of streptococcus agalactiae (group b streptococci) has decreased, while in contrast, the incidence of staphylococci, initially staphylococcus aureus and later coagulase-negative staphylococci, has increased. results suggest that external pressure, like changes in animal husbandry, including antimicrobial treatments and introduction  of modern milking machines, act as selective forces on the bacterial species which cause bovine mastitis.

TI  == toxic shock syndrome toxin-secreting staphylococcus aureus in kawasaki syndrome.
AB  == kawasaki syndrome (ks), the main cause of acquired heart disease in children, is  associated with the selective expansion of v beta 2+ t cells in peripheral blood. our study suggests that ks may be caused by a superantigen--a staphylococcal or streptococcal toxin. bacteria were cultured without knowledge of their origin, from the throat, rectum, axilla, and groin of 16 patients with untreated acute ks and 15 controls. bacteria producing toxins were isolated from 13 of 16 ks patients but from only 1 of 15 controls (p < 0.0001). toxic shock syndrome toxin  (tsst) secreting staphylococcus aureus was isolated from 11 of the 13 toxin-positive cultures, and streptococcal pyogenic exotoxin (spe) b and c were found in the other 2. these toxins are known to stimulate v beta 2+ t cells. all  tsst-producing ks isolates were tryptophan auxotrophs indicating they were clonally related. s aureus isolates from acute ks patients were unusual because they produced less lipase, haemolysin, and protease compared to other isolates (p < 0.01). s aureus colonies from ks patients were white, and could be easily mistaken for coagulase-negative staphylococci, whereas colonies of non-ks isolates were gold. these observations suggest that the expansion of v beta 2+ t  cells in most patients with ks may be caused by a new clone of tsst-producing s aureus, and, in a minority of patients, speb-producing or spec-producing streptococci.

TI  == immunization and immunotherapy for mastitis.
AB  == immunization and immunotherapy for mastitis are active areas of investigation. the past decade has seen development of effective and economical r-mutant vaccines for gram-negative mastitis. these vaccines doubtless will prove beneficial on well managed dairies that have eradicated contagious mastitis pathogens. development of vaccines for other mastitis pathogens has been noticeably slower. a commercially available staphylococcus aureus vaccine appears to reduce the frequency and severity of clinical episodes, but probably has minimal impact on the incidence or prevalence of infection. this product has not  been extensively studied. the recent recognition of virulence factors produced in vivo by staphylococcus aureus may provide a breakthrough in the development and production of staphylococcus aureus vaccines. bacterins employing this principle  presently are not commercially available, however. in the case of all contagious  mastitis pathogens (streptococcus agalactiae, staphylococcus aureus, and mycoplasma spp.), traditional control and eradication efforts (teat dip, dry cow  therapy, culling programs) likely will prove preferable to long-term immunization. ongoing research may provide more efficacious vaccines for these mastitis syndromes. immunostimulants are an active area of research. although leukopoietic factors appear promising as immunostimulants, no compound has clearly demonstrated efficacy in either the prevention or treatment of bovine mastitis.

TI  == culture of bulk tank milk as a mastitis screening test: a brief review.
AB  == the culture of a sample of bulk tank milk may be a useful technique by which to screen herds for major mastitis pathogens. staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus agalactiae, if identified on a culture of a sample of bulk milk, reliably indicate infection of the udder. environmental bacteria, such as the other streptococci and coliforms, are unlikely to be indicative of the proportion of cows infected with these organisms.samples of bulk milk are readily obtainable and can be rapidly and inexpensively cultured to screen large numbers of herds for mastitis-causing bacteria, yet the performance of the test has only recently  been formally assessed for its ability to correctly classify herds according to infection status.a single culture of bulk tank milk has been found to be a test with low sensitivity and high specificity for determining the presence of s. agalactiae or s. aureus in the herd. this means that many infected herds will be  called negative, but few uninfected herds will be classified as positive.the literature assessing the performance of bulk tank milk culture in comparison with other mastitis screening tests, the use of bulk milk culture for prevalence surveys, and factors affecting these results is discussed.

AB  == the in vivo effects of penicillin and cefprozil therapy on the interaction between organisms commonly recovered from inflamed tonsils were studied by using  a subcutaneous abscess model in mice. these organisms were group a beta-hemolytic streptococci (gabhs), streptococcus salivarius (which is capable of interfering with gabhs), and staphylococcus aureus. in mice infected with gabhs and s. salivarius alone or in combination, penicillin eliminated both organisms and cefprozil eliminated gabhs and s. aureus but not s. salivarius. penicillin did not, however, reduce the number of gabhs or s. salivarius in the presence of s. aureus. the present study demonstrated the ability of beta-lactamase-producing s. aureus to protect gabhs from penicillin. however, no such protection was present  following the administration of cefprozil. furthermore, the preservation of s. salivarius that interferes with gabhs growth may provide protection from reinfection with gabhs. this study supports and provides an explanation for the increased efficacies of cephalosporins administered orally over that of penicillin when treating patients with acute gabhs pharyngitis or tonsillitis.

AB  == group b streptococci (gbs) are the most common cause of neonatal sepsis and pneumonia. the pathogenesis of gbs disease is not completely defined. gbs-induced endothelial cell injury is suggested by histological findings at autopsy and in animal studies. we hypothesized that (i) type iii gbs (coh-1) invade and injure human umbilical vein endothelial (huve) cells and (ii) isogenic mutations in gbs  capsule synthesis would influence huve invasion. confluent huve monolayers were infected for 0.5, 2, or 6 h. media with penicillin plus gentamicin were added and incubated for 2 h to kill extracellular bacteria. cells were washed and lysed, and the number of live intracellular bacteria was determined by plate counting. coh-1 invaded huve cells in a time-dependent manner at levels 1,000-fold higher than those of the noninvasive escherichia coli strain but significantly lower than those of staphylococcus aureus. there was no evidence for net intracellular  replication of gbs within huve cells. coh-1 infection of huve cells caused the release of lactate dehydrogenase activity. gbs invasion was inhibited by cytochalasin d in a dose-dependent manner; gbs-induced lactate dehydrogenase release was attenuated by cytochalasin d. the isogenic strains coh 1-11, devoid of capsular sialic acid, and coh 1-13, devoid of all type iii capsule, invaded huve cells three- to fivefold more than the parent coh-1 strain. the type iii capsular polysaccharide and particularly the capsular sialic acid attenuate gbs invasion of huve cells. electron micrographs of lung tissue from a gbs-infected newborn macaca nemestrina also showed gbs within capillary endothelial cells. we  conclude that endothelial cell invasion and injury are potential mechanisms in the pathogenesis of gbs disease.

TI  == cefprozil. a review of its antibacterial activity, pharmacokinetic properties, and therapeutic potential.
AB  == cefprozil is an orally active cephalosporin which has demonstrated activity against a wide range of organisms in vitro. it is particularly active against the gram-positive organisms streptococcus pyogenes, pneumoniae and agalactiae and against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus. strains of methicillin-resistant s. aureus are not susceptible to cefprozil. cefprozil is also moderately active against haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, many enterobacteriaceae and certain anaerobic organisms, and is relatively stable to hydrolysis by a number of beta-lactamases. in comparative trials, the clinical and bacteriological efficacy of cefprozil 500mg  or 20 mg/kg administered once or twice daily has been comparable with multiple daily dosage regimens of erythromycin in patients with tonsillitis or pharyngitis, with cefaclor and amoxicillin/clavulanate in lower respiratory tract infections, with amoxicillin/clavulanate and erythromycin in skin and skin-structure infections and with cefaclor in acute uncomplicated urinary tract  infections. the clinical efficacy of cefprozil is similar to that of cefaclor in  patients with tonsillitis or pharyngitis but the bacteriological efficacy of cefprozil is significantly greater than that of cefaclor. cefprozil is clinically more effective than cefuroxime axetil in the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections and demonstrated greater efficacy than cefaclor in one of 2 comparative studies when administered twice daily in patients with skin and skin-structure infections. in children with acute otitis media, cefprozil 15 mg/kg twice daily was as effective as cefaclor or amoxicillin/clavulanate 13.3 mg/kg 3 times daily and was as effective as cefixime 8 mg/kg once daily. the most frequently reported adverse effects associated with cefprozil, diarrhoea and nausea, are usually mild to moderate in severity and discontinuation of treatment is rarely necessary. thus, cefprozil with its convenient administration regimen appears to be a suitable alternative to cefaclor, cefixime, amoxicillin/clavulanate or erythromycin for the treatment of upper and lower respiratory tract infections, skin and skin-structure infections, and otitis media in children. while cefprozil has shown similar efficacy to cefaclor in the  treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections, well-controlled clinical trials comparing its efficacy with that of cotrimoxazole (trimethoprim+sulfamethoxazole) in this indication are required.

AB  == we obtained bacterial strains which were clinically isolated and identified from  outpatients with various infections in medical institutions throughout japan. possible antibacterial activities of rokitamycin (rkm) were examined against these isolates. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined through  a comparative study with reference drugs. the results of the study are summarized as follows. 1. resistance patterns of 400 isolates which were highly resistant to macrolides (mls) with mic values > 100 micrograms/ml were classified into 55 patterns. staphylococcus spp. showed cross resistance to 14-membered ring mls with 100% cross resistance observed between erythromycin (em) and clarithromycin  (cam), and 85.2% between em and oleandomycin (ol). fewer isolates showed strong resistance to 16-membered ring mls than to 14-membered ring mls. cross resistances observed among the staphylococcus isolates were 100% between acetylmidecamycin (mdm-ac) and kitasamycin (leucomycin (lm)), 93.9% between mdm-ac and josamycin (jm), and 53.3% between mdm-ac and rkm. streptococcus spp. and peptococcus spp. showed very similar resistance patterns to both 14- and 16-membered ring mls, but resistance patterns to rkm were quite different. most of anaerobic streptococci and bacteroides fragilis group had similar resistance patterns to 14- and 16-membered ring mls, but in some cases a pattern similar to  that of staphylococcus spp. was observed. 2. when ml-resistant bacteria isolated  during 1975 to 1980 were compared to those isolated in 1986 and 1989, it was observed that resistance of staphylococcus aureus remained almost unchanged, that of streptococcus pyogenes was lower in the later years than during 1975 to 1980,  but that of streptococcus pneumoniae increased. 3. most of ml-resistances of the  resistant isolates were inducible, but extents of induction varied depending on drugs tested. strong inductions were observed when 14-membered ring mls were used, but inductions were minimal with 16-membered ring mls. rkm appeared to induce resistance to the least extent. from these results, it appears that the rkm is quite useful clinically even in the 1990s.

TI  == production of an electrolyte beverage from milk permeate.
AB  == the objective of this study was to prepare shelf-stable electrolyte beverages from milk permeate. the average composition of permeate was 4.59% total solids and .40% ash. lactose was hydrolyzed (approximately 80%) with a commercial fungal lactase enzyme. additional sweetness was provided by sucrose. the ph was reduced  to 3.5 to 3.8 by the addition of citric acid. shelf-stable products were made using four processes: 1) uht followed by aseptic filling, 2) heating of filled bottles to 85 degrees c for 30 min, 3) addition of .05% benzoate, and 4) nanopore filtration. the mineral composition of the finished product, expressed in parts per million, was calcium, 150; phosphorus, 157; magnesium, 43; potassium, 1166; sodium, 286; iron, 17; copper, 8; and zinc, 3.4. listeria monocytogenes, salmonella dublin, salmonella typhimurium, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus agalactiae grew well when they were inoculated into unacidified, hydrolyzed permeate. none of these organisms were isolated from properly processed products. a shelf-stable electrolyte beverage high in minerals was made from whole milk permeate. this beverage could be used to replace electrolytes lost from the human body. the production of a permeate beverage would help alleviate disposal problems of permeate.

TI  == the bactericidal effect of n-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase on bacteria.
AB  == the bactericidal activity of n-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase (nagase) on some of  the potential bacterial pathogens of the cow was determined. nagase treatment significantly decreased the mean log10 number of actinomyces pyogenes (p less than 0.01) and staphylococcus aureus (p less than 0.05) after 2 and 4 hours of incubation at 37 degrees c. similarly nagase treatment significantly (p less than 0.05) reduced the mean log10 number of streptococcus agalactiae and pseudomonas aeruginosa after 4 hours incubation at 37 degrees c. nagase did not reduce the numbers of escherichia coli or enterobacter aerogenes after either 2 or 4 hours incubation. since nagase and presumably other lysosomal enzymes are free on normal mucosal surfaces such as the uterus it is suggested that this direct bactericidal activity may be an important component of the normal defense mechanisms.

TI  == mycobacterium paratuberculosis binds fibronectin.
AB  == fibronectin, an adhesive glycoprotein which is present in plasma and on many host cell surfaces of many host organisms, binds to certain bacterial pathogens. this  study demonstrates the ability of mycobacterium paratuberculosis (m.ptb) to interact with 125i-labelled fibronectin purified from bovine and ovine plasma. two m.ptb strains were tested: a clinical isolate and a commercially available vaccine strain. both strains showed significant fibronectin-binding activities of 22 and 41%, respectively, whereas non-pathogenic m.phlei had almost no affinity for fibronectin. binding activities were similar for ovine and bovine fibronectin. we found that fibronectin binding by m.ptb was (1) time-dependent, reaching saturation within 90 min, (2) specific, since it was inhibited by an excess of unlabelled fibronectin but not by albumin, (3) saturable, with an apparent dissociation constant of 1.25 x 10(-9) m and a maximal number of 1,600 binding sites per bacterium, and (4) sensitive to detergents, proteases and heat  treatments, indicating the protein nature of the responsible binding component(s). scatchard plot analysis gave a straight line suggesting the presence of a single type of fibronectin receptor on m.ptb.

AB  == milk samples for bacteriologic culture were submitted from 71 dairy herds, 24 with low somatic cell count (scc) and 47 with high scc and high prevalence of subclinical mastitis. at the time of sample submission to the mastitis diagnostic laboratory of pennsylvania state university, information regarding the herd mastitis control practices was collected. a combined program of post-milking teat dipping (pmtd) and antibiotic treatment of all cows at the start of the nonlactating period was practiced more frequently for herds with low scc, (p less than 0.001) than for herds with high scc. among all herds for which pmtd was practiced, a higher proportion (p less than 0.001) of those for which chlorhexidine-based products were used had low scc than high scc. conversely, a higher proportion of herds for which a dip with an acrylic latex barrier was used had high scc rather than low scc (p = 0.002). for herds with high prevalence of subclinical mastitis, and despite a program of pmtd and treatment of all cows at  the start of the nonlactating period, a change to a different germicidal teat dip product may be indicated to help reduce prevalence of infection.

AB  == bacteriological culture results were compared between 336 pairs of quarter milk samples collected premilking and postmilking. using a positive result on either premilking or postmilking samples as the definitive diagnosis, premilking sampling sensitivity was 91% for staphylococcus aureus, 91% for coagulase-negative staphylococci, and 97% for streptococcus other than agalactiae. postmilking sampling sensitivities were 81, 45, and 58%, respectively, for the same pathogens. requiring both premilking and postmilking samples for the definitive diagnosis, specificities were 92, 86, and 95% for premilking sampling alone and 96, 98, and 99% for postmilking sampling alone. such differences in specificity would result in major differences in predictive value of a positive culture for herds with a low prevalence. multiple isolates were significantly more common from premilking samples.

TI  == direct identification of bacterial isolates in blood cultures by using a dna probe.
AB  == this study involved the rapid, direct identification of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, haemophilus influenzae, enterococcus  sp., and streptococcus agalactiae from positive blood culture bottles (bactec, johnston laboratories, inc.) by using the accuprobe (gen-probe, san diego, calif.) culture confirmation test. this method uses a chemiluminescent dna probe  that detects the rrna of the target organisms. the manufacturer's instructions were modified to use a pellet of bacteria made directly from positive blood culture broth rather than a colony from an agar plate. two separate procedures of selective centrifugation were employed in order to obtain the pellet. the first utilized a routine clinical centrifuge and a large volume of broth (10 to 12 ml)  from the blood culture bottle. the second method used a microcentrifuge and less  volume (1 to 1.5 ml). a total of 196 clinical specimens taken directly from positive blood culture broths were correctly identified by accuprobe from pellets made by using the clinical centrifuge technique, while 166 clinical specimens used as negative controls failed to show hybridization. the microcentrifuge technique for obtaining pellets was performed on 105 patient specimens, and all were correctly identified. when combined with the microcentrifuge technique for pellet preparation, the accuprobe test has several advantages: (i) direct identification of bacteria from blood culture broths, (ii) rapid turn-around time (30 min), (iii) simplicity of the procedure, and (iv) relative low cost.

AB  == pharmacokinetic, bacteriological, and clinical studies on cefdinir (cfdn, fk482)  (10% fine granules), a new oral cephem, were performed in pediatrics. 1. bioequivalencies of plasma concentrations and urinary excretions of cfdn 5% and 10% fine granules were investigated on 3 pediatric patients with ages between 5 to 13 years administered with a drug in fasting state at a dose level of 3 mg/kg  using a cross over method. average plasma concentrations in a group of patients administered with 5% fine granules peaked at 3 hours after administration with a  level of 1.05 +/- 0.29 micrograms/ml (mean +/- s.e.) and decreased to 0.12 +/- 0.05 micrograms/ml at 8 hours with a half-life of 1.48 +/- 0.09 hours. in the group administered with 10% fine granules, average plasma concentrations peaked at 2 hours after administration with a level of 1.32 +/- 0.12 micrograms/ml, and  decreased to 0.20 +/- 0.11 microgram/ml at 8 hours with a half-life of 1.68 +/- 0.28 hours. the first 8-hour urinary recovery rates of cfdn in the 5% and 10% fine granules groups averaged 19.64 +/- 5.69% and 23.37 +/- 2.36%, respectively.  both average and individual plasma concentrations and urinary recovery rates in the patients of the 10% fine granules group were somewhat higher than those of the 5% fine granules group, but no significant differences were observed between  the 2 groups including areas under concentrations. 2. cfdn 10% fine granule preparation was administered to 33 pediatric patients with ages between 1 to 13 years with various infections, and its clinical effects, bacteriological effects  and safety were assessed. in 31 of the 33 patients (2 patients were excluded since they were with non-bacterial infections) clinical effects were excellent in all of 9 patients with scarlet fever (3), acute pharyngitis (3) or impetigo (3),  excellent in 12 and good in 3 of 15 patients with acute purulent tonsillitis, and excellent in 4 and good in 3 of 7 patients with acute pneumonia. the overall efficacy rate was 100%. bacteriological effects against causative organisms were  evaluated. all the identified staphylococcus aureus (4 strains) and streptococcus agalactiae (1) were eradicated. of 10 strains of streptococcus pyogenes, 9 strains were eradicated and the other one was reduced. of 7 strains of haemophilus influenzae 4 were eradicated, 1 persisted and the fate of the remaining 2 were unknown. the overall eradication rate was 90.0%. microbial substitutions were observed in 5 patients. the new, replacing bacteria were all haemophilus spp.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == ampicillin-aminoglycoside combinations as initial treatment for neonatal septicaemia or meningitis. a retrospective evaluation of 12 years' experience.
AB  == in a retrospective study covering the years 1975-1986, 341 episodes of invasive infections in 338 newborn infants were evaluated. of the 365 pathogens isolated from blood and/or cerebrospinal fluid, 91% were sensitive to either ampicillin or aminoglycosides or both. ampicillin resistance was mainly found in very low and low birthweight infants with late-onset infections, in which aerobic gram-negative rods were common pathogens. in contrast, aminoglycoside resistance  was common in early-onset infections, due to the dominance of group b streptococcal infections. the ampicillin-aminoglycoside combination had been given as initial treatment in 189 cases of septicaemia or meningitis. treatment failed in 36 infections (20%), although all organisms were sensitive to one or both antibiotics. treatment failed in 6 of 34 patients with meningitis but the failure was not related to ampicillin or aminoglycoside resistance. in conclusion, both in vitro and clinical results show that the ampicillin-aminoglycoside combination can be used as initial treatment of invasive infections in neonates.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of ru29246 (hr916 metabolite) compared with four other oral beta-lactams tested against more than 5000 clinical isolates.
AB  == the activity of ru29246, the active metabolite of the oral cephalosporin ester hr916, was compared in a multicenter study with that of the four oral beta-lactam antibiotics cephalexin, cefaclor, cefixime and amoxicillin/clavulanate (amoxicillin/ca). ru29246 was generally 2- to 8-fold more active than the other oral cephalosporins and comparable to amoxicillin/ca against staphylococci, and was the most active cephalosporin against group b streptococci. all four cephalosporins were ineffective against enterococci. ru29246 was the only cephalosporin consistently active against acinetobacter, but all beta-lactam antibiotics had poor activity against pseudomonas spp. and xanthomonas maltophilia. ru29246 was comparable to cefixime and more active than the other cephalosporins against members of the family enterobacteriaceae. however, all of  the antibiotics had poor activity against enterobacter cloacae and serratia marcescens. quality control reference ranges for the quality control organisms staphylococcus aureus atcc 29213 and escherichia coli atcc 25922 are proposed for the broth dilution method based on data derived from this multicenter study.

TI  == growth of staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus species in bovine mammary secretions during the nonlactating and peripartum periods following intramammary  infusion of lipopolysaccharide at cessation of milking.
AB  == the objective was to determine if induced mammary inflammation at cessation of milking influenced growth of gram-positive mastitis pathogens in mammary secretions, particularly during early involution. growth of all mastitis pathogens evaluated was similar in cell-free fat-free mammary secretions from lps-infused and control glands. these data indicate that intramammary infusion of lps at cessation of milking did not alter growth of gram-positive mastitis pathogens in mammary secretion during the nonlactating period. stage of lactation and the nonlactating period influenced bacterial growth and marked differences between bacteria and among strains of a bacterial species were observed. staphylococcus aureus grew well in secretions collected during late lactation, but growth decreased during early- and mid-involution and increased again in secretions obtained near parturition. streptococcus agalactiae and strep. uberis  grew better in mammary secretion obtained during involution than in secretions collected during late or early lactation. streptococcus dysgalactiae grew well in mammary secretions at all time periods. these data demonstrate the variability of mastitis pathogen growth during physiologic transitions of the bovine udder.

TI  == bacteriological nasal flora in newborns indicating health and/or development of infection.
AB  == during delivery, a fetus otherwise sterile during the intrauterine life, comes in contact with bacterial flora of the mother's birth canal, and then also with the  ward personnel's skin and respiratory system flora. due to the absence of competitive bacteriological flora, the nasal cavity is gradually colonized by microorganisms, especially those with a capacity of adhesion to epithelial cells  of respiratory nasal mucosa. bacteriological flora of the newborn's nasal flora was observed on days 1 and 3 postpartum, in an attempt to determine whether a finding of pathogenic bacterial flora in newborn's nasal mucosa indicates a localized infection only or points to the possible development of generalized infection. bacteriological nasal flora was monitored in infants born by spontaneous delivery and in those born by cesarean section. in mothers of infants born by spontaneous delivery, bacteriological flora from the cervix uteri was investigated. results of the study performed by usual methods revealed escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus to prevail in the pathogenic flora. gram-negative microorganisms were found to be good indicators of local infection  of newborn's nasal mucosa, regardless of the absence of clinical symptoms.

TI  == the relationship of tonsil bacterial concentration to surface and core cultures in chronic tonsillar disease in children.
AB  == fifty-five tonsils removed for chronic tonsillar disease (chronic tonsillitis and obstructive tonsillar hyperplasia) underwent surface swab and quantitative core cultures in order to identify the relationship between core bacterial concentration and the presence of aerobic bacteria on the tonsil surface. the accuracy of a single core culture was further established by quantitative cultures of 9 sections per tonsil in an additional 19 tonsils. the results indicate that many (61.5%) but not all aerobic bacteria which were found in the tonsil core were cultured from the surface of the tonsil. conversely, the tonsil  core bacteria with the highest bacterial concentrations are more likely to be present on the tonsillar surface and the greater the bacterial concentration, the more likely the bacteria are to be found in most if not all areas of the tonsil core. therefore, the core bacterial concentration appears to be related to the presence of aerobic bacteria on the tonsillar surface. surface bacteria may not,  however, be truly representative of the core bacterial environment. implications  for the management of chronic tonsillar disease will be discussed.

AB  == in a retrospective study of neonatal septicaemia and meningitis in a defined region of western sweden 1975-1986, 231 cases were identified. the incidence was  2.8/1000 live births. the case-fatality rate was 15%. thirty-three patients had meningitis. only 55 patients (24%) had no known risk factors. preterm delivery was a most important risk factor for both morbidity and mortality. the most common causative organisms were group b streptococci, staphylococcus aureus and aerobic gram-negative rods, together isolated from 82% of the patients. the cases were approximately equally divided between very early, early and late onset infections. group b streptococci were over-represented in very early onset infections in all birthweight groups and aerobic gram-negative rods were the most common isolates from low birthweight infants with late onset infections. however, group b streptococci, staphylococcus aureus and gram-negative rods were found in  all birthweight and gestational age groups. thus, initial antimicrobial therapy must be equally broad in all neonates with suspected septicaemia.

TI  == use of modified norleucine-tyrosine broth in identification of peptostreptococcus anaerobius.
AB  == gas-liquid chromatography was employed to analyze the volatile and nonvolatile acids produced in modified norleucine-tyrosine (mnt) broth by various gram-positive cocci. the mnt broth consists of 0.5% trypticase (bbl microbiology  systems, cockeysville, md.), 0.5% yeast extract (difco laboratories, detroit, mich.), 0.2% l-norleucine, and 0.1% l-tyrosine. the microorganisms included reference strains and clinical isolates of peptostreptococcus spp. (p. anaerobius, p. asaccharolyticus, p. indolicus, p. magnus, and p. prevotii), staphylococcus spp. (s. aureus, s. epidermidis, and s. saccharolyticus), and streptococcus spp. (s. agalactiae, s. intermedius, s. mutans, s. sanguis i, and s. sanguis ii). only peptostreptococcus anaerobius strains produced caproic and valeric acids in mnt broth cultures. all 11 p. anaerobius strains produced valeric acid in mnt broth, and only 1 strain failed to produce caproic acid in the medium. this unique feature aids in rapid, reliable identification of p. anaerobius with a minimum number of tests.

TI  == a case of group b streptococcal pyomyositis.
AB  == the group b streptococcus is an opportunistic pathogen that causes a variety of serious infections including bacteremias, puerperal sepsis, and neonatal meningitis. group b streptococcal infections of muscle are rare. we report here an unusual case of group b streptococcal pyomyositis. pyomyositis arises predominantly from infections caused by staphylococcus aureus and, occasionally,  streptococcus pyogenes. because of the rarity of pyomyositis in temperate climates, the common lack of localizing signs or symptoms, and the frequently negative blood cultures, considerable delay often precedes the diagnosis of pyomyositis; in fact, the infection has been initially misdiagnosed as muscle hematoma, cellulitis, thrombophlebitis, osteomyelitis, or neoplasm. diagnosis may be greatly aided by radiologic techniques that can demonstrate the sites of muscle enlargement and the presence of fluid collections. the response to antibiotics is usually rapid, but resolution of the infection may require aspiration of deeply situated muscle abscesses. this report describes a diabetic  patient with an unusual presentation of pyomyositis that mimicked an acute abdomen.

TI  == efficacy of chlorhexidine as a postmilking teat disinfectant for the prevention of bovine mastitis during lactation.
AB  == a natural exposure trial was conducted for 12 mo in a herd of 150 lactating jersey cows to determine efficacy of a .35% chlorhexidine teat dip containing a glycerine emollient for the prevention of bovine intramammary infections. right teats of cows were dipped in the experimental teat dip after milking machine removal and left teats were not dipped. the herd was free of streptococcus agalactiae and had a low prevalence of staphylococcus aureus. most new major pathogen intramammary infections resulted from streptococcus species, primarily streptococcus uberis and streptococcus dysgalactiae. new infections by streptococcus species were significantly lower in teats dipped in chlorhexidine than in undipped teats. overall efficacy of the chlorhexidine teat dip against major mastitis pathogens was 50%. the experimental teat dip also reduced coagulase-negative staphylococcus species infections 49.0% and corynebacterium bovis infections 65.2%. overall efficacy against minor mastitis pathogens was 54.0%. no irritation or chapping of teats dipped in the experimental teat dip was observed.

TI  == plus-origin mapping of single-stranded dna plasmid pe194 and nick site homologies with other plasmids.
AB  == staphylococcus aureus plasmid pe194 manifests a natural thermosensitivity for replication and can be established in several species, both gram positive and gram negative, thus making it attractive for use as a delivery vector. like most  characterized plasmids of gram-positive bacteria, pe194 generates single-stranded dna. the direction of pe194 replication is clockwise, as determined by the strandedness of free single-stranded dna. significant homology exists between a 50-base-pair sequence in the origin of pe194 and sequences present in plasmids pmv158 (streptococcus agalactiae), padb201 (mycoplasma mycoides), and psh71 (lactococcus lactis). we used an initiation-termination reaction, in which pe194  initiates replication at its own origin and is induced to terminate at the related pmv158 sequence, to demonstrate that pe194 replicates by a rolling-circle mechanism; the initiation nick site was localized to an 8-base-pair sequence.

TI  == transferable plasmid-mediated antibiotic resistance in listeria monocytogenes.
AB  == a strain of listeria monocytogenes, isolated from a patient with meningoencephalitis, was resistant to chloramphenicol, erythromycin, streptomycin, and tetracycline. the genes conferring resistance to these antibiotics were carried by a 37-kb plasmid, pip811, that was self-transferable to other l monocytogenes cells, to enterococci-streptococci, and to staphylococcus aureus. the efficacy of transfer and the stability of pip811 were  higher in enterococci-streptococci than in the other gram-positive bacteria. as indicated by nucleic acid hybridisation, the genes in pip811 conferring resistance to chloramphenicol, erythromycin, and streptomycin were closely related to plasmid-borne determinants that are common in enterococci-streptococci. plasmid pip811 shared extensive sequence homology with  pam beta 1, the prototype broad host range resistance plasmid in these two groups of gram-positive cocci. these results suggest that emergence of multiple antibiotic resistance in listeria spp is due to acquisition of a replicon originating in enterococci-streptococci. the dissemination of resistance to other strains of l monocytogenes is likely.

TI  == mastitis control services and utilization of milk somatic cell count data by veterinarians in ohio.
AB  == a telephone survey was conducted of 50 randomly selected ohio-licensed veterinarians engaged in dairy practice. the survey's purpose was to determine the extent of mastitis control services offered by practitioners and to assess their utilization of milk somatic cell count (scc) data on individual cows available from the dairy herd improvement association (dhia). during the preceding year, 96% (48/50) of practitioners surveyed had performed bacteriologic culture of milk samples. practitioners were twice as likely to have performed culture on milk from mastitic cows that failed to respond to treatment as they were to have performed culture for purposes of identifying pathogen trends within a herd. veterinarians in predominantly dairy practices were more likely to have completed bacteriologic examination of milk in their own laboratories than were veterinarians who were engaged in less than 50% dairy practice (p = 0.016). most  veterinarians (83%) reported that coagulase test results were available or that staphylococcus aureus was differentiated from other staphylococcal species. streptococcus agalactiae was not differentiated from other streptococcal species  by 35% of practitioners surveyed. for veterinarians with clients enrolled in the  dhia, 91% (43/47) reported looking at, discussing, or otherwise using the dhia records. eighty-one percent (35/43) of veterinarians who had clients using services from the dhia reported that clients also received individual cow milk scc results. veterinarians engaged in predominantly, dairy practice expressed a greater familiarity with the linear score method of scc reporting than did veterinarians whose practices were less than 50% dairy (p = 0.085); however, both groups reported a preference for raw scc data.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == cefepime (bmy 28142) was compared with ceftazidime, cefotaxime, and moxalactam for efficacy in treating experimental meningitis in mice and neonatal rats. mice  were infected intracranially with streptococcus pneumoniae, s. agalactiae, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa and treated intramuscularly. five- to eight-day-old neonatal rats were injected intracisternally with haemophilus influenzae, s. pneumoniae, and s. agalactiae and treated intraperitoneally. cefepime was found to be the most active compound against induced meningitis in mice infected with s. agalactiae. cefepime was as active as cefotaxime against staphylococcus aureus meningitis, slightly more active than cefotaxime against s. pneumoniae and e. coli, and as active as ceftazidime against k. pneumoniae and p. aeruginosa meningitis. cefepime was found to be the most active compound against s. pneumoniae and s. agalactiae meningitis in neonatal rats. against h. influenzae, cefepime was as active as moxalactam and cefotaxime. ceftazidime was the least active compound. the pharmacokinetics of cefepime in neonatal rats were similar to those of ceftazidime. both compounds penetrated well into cerebrospinal fluid and brain tissues of uninfected neonatal rats. relative concentrations were twice as high as those of cefotaxime and moxalactam.

TI  == sequestration of n-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase in somatic cells during experimental bovine mastitis induced by endotoxin, staphylococcus aureus or streptococcus agalactiae.
AB  == experimental mastitis was induced in cows by intramammary infusion of endotoxin,  staphylococcus aureus or streptococcus agalactiae. the inflammatory response was  monitored by somatic cell counting and n-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase (nagase).  nagase activity was analysed in fresh milk samples in parallel with samples treated by a cycle of freezing and thawing combined with detergent treatment to release the cell-bound nagase. before the udder reacted by inflammation, the total nagase activity consisted of free extracellular activity. later on when the inflammation was established, much of the milk nagase remained sequestered intracellularly. s agalactiae was linked with a high degree of cellular nagase sequestration indicating a blockage of the lysosomal release function from the phagocytes. s aureus delayed the inflammatory response.

TI  == clinical mastitis in two california dairy herds participating in contagious mastitis control programs.
AB  == the occurrence of clinical mastitis in two large california dairy herds over a 3-yr period is described. herds had been participating for 15 or 22 yr in mastitis control programs against streptococcus agalactiae and staphylococcus aureus, had low bulk tank scc, and had maintained good standards of hygiene and husbandry, but clinical mastitis remained a serious problem. a total of 1654 clinical mastitis cases were detected; the annual incidence in each herd was 49%. coliform bacteria and environmental streptococci were etiological agents in 60% of the total clinical mastitis cases; coliforms produced 1.6 times more clinical  mastitis than environmental streptococci. a higher susceptibility to clinical mastitis, primarily from coliform bacteria and environmental streptococci, was found in the first months of lactation. clinical mastitis incidence peaked for cows in lactations 4 and 5 and was lowest during the first lactation. highest incidence of clinical mastitis due to coliform bacteria and environmental streptococci at each dairy occurred during the rainy season (late fall and winter).

TI  == complement c3 deposition onto bacteria by neonatal serum is not enhanced after the infusion of intravenous immunoglobulin.
AB  == to determine the effect of intravenous immunoglobulin (ivig) on the capacity of serum from septic neonates to deposit complement c3 and igg onto the bacteria isolated from their blood, 500 mg/kg of ivig was administered to 18 neonates suspected of being septic. blood was obtained just before the infusion, and again 15 minutes after its completion. group b streptococcus type ii, group b streptococcus type iii, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis were isolated from the pre-infusion blood of four neonates. bacteria were incubated with the appropriate serum, washed, and the amount of c3 and igg subsequently bound to the organisms was quantified by radioimmunobinding assay. sera from the four septic neonates and sera from four neonates of similar gestational age but whose blood cultures were negative were compared with pooled  sera from healthy adults. before the administration of ivig, c3 deposition onto the bacteria by sera from five of the seven neonates tested was significantly less than that observed for adult sera. following the infusion, no increase in c3 deposition was observed for any of the seven sera assayed, and in two cases c3 deposition fell significantly. in contrast, in seven of eight cases, ivig enhanced the igg deposition to levels greater than or equal to those observed for adult sera. therefore, following the infusion of ivig into neonates with proven or suspected sepsis, the deposition of c3 onto invasive bacteria by their serum was not enhanced even though igg deposition was increased.

TI  == the effect of pre-enrichment on recovery of streptococcus agalactiae, staphylococcus aureus and mycoplasma from bovine milk.
AB  == the study was conducted to determine whether pre-enrichment would increase sensitivity of detecting streptococcus (str.) agalactiae, staphylococcus (s.) aureus, and mycoplasma in bovine milk. two procedures were followed, one involving direct inoculation of milk on bovine blood agar, and the other involving preenrichment in broth followed by inoculation on agar. logistic regression was used to predict the probability of isolation as a function of culture procedure and two additional covariates, the california mastitis test (cmt) score of the milk and the type of sample (indicating sample storage temperature and herd mastitis status). a total of 13778 milk samples was cultured for each of the three bacteria. by using results of both direct inoculation and pre-enrichment, the probability of isolation compared to use of direct inoculation only and adjusted for effects of other variables was increased 3.6-fold for str. agalactiae, 1.6-fold for s. aureus and 1.7-fold for mycoplasma. the probability of isolation for all three bacteria increased as the cmt score increased. for str. agalactiae, there was a statistical interaction predicting that enrichment improved the odds of isolation more from milk with high cmt scores than from milk with low scores. results indicate that pre-enrichment can substantially increase the sensitivity of bacteriological screening of dairy cows for mastitis caused by str. agalactiae, s. aureus, and mycoplasma.

TI  == purification, composition, and activity of two bactenecins, antibacterial peptides of bovine neutrophils.
AB  == extracts of granules of bovine neutrophils are known to exhibit a marked antibacterial activity in vitro. by a simple, two-step chromatographic procedure, we have resolved two peptide components of the antibacterial system. they were named bac-5 and bac-7 from the general term bactenecin and had molecular masses of about 5 and 7 kilodaltons, respectively. over 45 and 20% of the amino acid residues in the two bactenecins are proline and arginine, respectively. the remaining amino acids are mainly hydrophobic (isoleucine, leucine, and phenylalanine). both bac-5 and bac-7 efficiently kill escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, and klebsiella pneumoniae. they also arrest the growth of enterobacter cloacae (mics, 25 to 200 micrograms/ml) but not of proteus vulgaris, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus agalactiae (mic, greater than 200 micrograms/ml). finally, bac-7 but not bac-5 has mics of less than or equal to 200 micrograms/ml for pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus epidermidis. from the comparison between the efficient bactericidal concentrations in vitro and the estimated content of bactenecins in neutrophils (125 ng of bac-5 and bac-7 each per 10(6) cells), it is reasonable to conclude that the two cationic peptides may exert a major role in host defense against at least some microorganisms.

AB  == cefteram pivoxil (cftm-pi), the pivaloyloxymethyl ester of cefteram (cftm) in which aminothiazol was also introduced into the 7 position of cephem nucleus, is  a new oral cephem antibiotic. cftm-pi was absorbed through the intestines and hydrolyzed to cftm by esterases in the intestinal wall and existed in the body fluids as cftm. a tablet form of this drug has been released in japan and now a granular form for pediatric patients has been developed. we have determined mics  of 5 drugs (cftm, cephalexin (cex), cefaclor (ccl), ampicillin (abpc), erythromycin (em], against stock strains and mics of 6 drugs (cftm, cex, ccl, abpc, methicillin, cloxacillin) against fresh strains from patients received to cftm-pi, with an inoculum size of 10(6) cfu/ml. a total of 149 strains included gram-positive cocci i.e. staphylococcus aureus (11), streptococcus pyogenes (85), streptococcus agalactiae (16) and streptococcus pneumoniae (4), and gram-negative rods i.e. haemophilus influenzae (11), bordetella pertussis (11), escherichia coli (9), proteus mirabilis (1) and morganella morganii (1). the granular form of cftm-pi was administered to 9 boys (age: 8 years 3 months approximately 10 years  10 months) to determine serum and urinary concentrations of the drug and its urinary recovery rates using bioassay. doses of 1.5, 3.0 and 6.0 mg/kg were given orally 30 minutes after meal to 3 boys, respectively. urinary concentrations and  its urinary recovery rates of t-2525a, a main metabolite of cftm, were determined using high performance liquid chromatography (hplc). to study clinical and bacteriological effects of this drug, a mean daily dose of 3.3 mg/kg divided 3-4  times a day (3 times: 133 cases, 4 times: 9 cases) was administered for 8 days on the average to a total of 142 cases with pharyngitis (22), tonsillitis (12), acute bronchitis (3), pneumonia (11), pleurisy (1), scarlet fever (28), acute purulent otitis media (16), impetigo (13), abscess (2), purulent lymphadenitis (1) and urinary tract infection (33). adverse reactions and abnormal effects on laboratory test values attributable to this drug were studied in patients. the results obtained are summarized as follows. 1. with regard to gram-positive cocci, mics of cftm against 11 fresh strains of s. aureus ranged from 3.13 to 6.25 micrograms/ml except for 1 strain, thus cftm was equally effective to cex, but less active than the other drugs tested.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == automatic application of teat disinfectant through the milking machine cluster.
AB  == an automatic device, which infuses disinfectant into the mouthpiece of the liner  of the milking machine cluster as teatcups are removed, is described. application at this time avoids any delay in disinfection, reduces the workload in the parlour and increases reliability of application. the teats of 20 cows were contaminated before each milking by immersion in a suspension of staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus agalactiae and then disinfected manually or automatically with iodophor after milking. str. agalactiae was recovered from less than 5% of swabs and there was no difference between the results from the two methods. neither method of disinfection was as effective against staph. aureus and the recovery rate was significantly greater for the automatic method for both swabs from teat barrel (p less than 0.05) and teat apex (p less than 0.001). rates of intramammary infection for quarters automatically or manually disinfected were similar and low (3/40 v. 6/40 respectively). the automatic method facilitates cluster removal by relieving vacuum and decreasing frictional  contact at the mouthpiece lip, and utilizes approximately half the quantity of disinfectant used by manual dipping (0.9 v. 1.9 ml/teat). however, iodine contamination in the milk from the iodophor teat disinfectant was significantly increased from 14.4 to 102.2 micrograms 12/100 ml milk when no backflushing was practised.

AB  == phagocytic and oxidative metabolic activities of bovine blood neutrophils were determined in the presence of glycolytic (naf) and cytoskeletal (colchicine, cytochalasin b, and prostaglandin e1) inhibitors. phagocytosis and post-phagocytic oxidative metabolic activity, measured by nitroblue tetrazolium reduction, were determined using zymosan, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, or streptococcus agalactiae. sodium fluoride (1.25 microm to 1.25 mm concentrations) did not significantly (p greater than 0.05) inhibit phagocytosis  of s aureus and str agalactiae, whereas phagocytosis of zymosan and e coli was significantly (p less than 0.05) inhibited only at 1.25 mm concentration. colchicine at 1.25 nm to 1.25 microm concentrations significantly inhibited phagocytosis of zymosan and e coli, but not of s aureus and str agalactiae. cytochalasin b at 1.25 nm to 1.25 microm concentrations significantly inhibited phagocytosis of zymosan and all 3 bacteria, whereas prostaglandin e1 was noninhibitory at similar concentrations. nitroblue tetrazolium reduction, in general, was not significantly affected by naf and cytoskeletal inhibitors.

AB  == the genetic determinant of the cohemolysin which is responsible for the camp phenomenon, a cohemolysis, of actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae was cloned in escherichia coli. total dna from the a. pleuropneumoniae serotype 1 type strain 4074 was used to construct a gene library in plasmid puc18 in e. coli jm83. a total of 10,500 clones containing recombinant plasmids have been screened for hemolysis on blood plates. fifty-five clones which showed a weak hemolytic response after 24 to 48 h of incubation were screened for the camp reaction with  staphylococcus aureus. this led to the identification of one clone which showed a positive camp reaction. immunoblot analysis revealed that the recombinant strain  expressed a protein with a molecular mass of 27,000 daltons, similar in size to the camp protein of the group b streptococci. rabbit antibodies against the camp+ clone neutralized the camp reaction mediated by the e. coli strain containing the cloned camp gene as well as that of a. pleuropneumoniae. antibodies raised against the cloned camp cohemolysin cross-reacted with streptococcus agalactiae protein b. we designate the 27,000-dalton molecule camp factor protein and name its corresponding gene cfp.

AB  == when ciprofloxacin was introduced on the swedish market the recommended interpretive standards for disk diffusion susceptibility testing using a 10 microgram disk were: sensitive greater than or equal to 24 mm (mic less than or equal to 1 mg/l) and resistant less than 18 mm (mic greater than 4 mg/l), except  for enterococci where s greater than or equal to 18 mm and r less than 14 mm were recommended. a quality control study revealed that the accuracy of the routine susceptibility testing of ciprofloxacin was low. 50% of the strains of staphylococcus aureus and 90% of streptococcus agalactiae strains were falsely assigned to the intermediate instead of the sensitive category, and the test missed to detect true resistance in pseudomonas maltophilia. new species-specific breakpoints were determined by the sra method. separate breakpoints were required only for the pseudomonas species. streptococcus faecalis was found to belong mainly to the intermediate group and it is suggested that these strains are not categorized as sensitive. the breakpoints that gave acceptable accuracy in routine susceptibility testing of ciprofloxacin were s greater than or equal to 20 mm, r less than 13 mm for all relevant bacteria except pseudomonas aeruginosa  for which s greater than or equal to 27 mm, r less than 18 mm is proposed, and pseudomonas maltophilia where s greater than or equal to 30 mm, r less than 23 mm are adequate breakpoints. the 10 microgram disk gave acceptable inhibition zones  for all strains with mics within the clinically interesting mic range.

AB  == infection with group b streptococci (gbs) is associated with a poor acute inflammatory response in which neutrophils fail to localize at the site of invasion. in the present studies, we have examined the effects of group b streptococci on c-derived chemotactic activity in human serum. fresh human serum  was activated to form c5a and c5adesarg by incubation with zymosan. the activated serum was then incubated with group b organisms, centrifuged, and the supernatants tested for chemotactic activity for human polymorphonuclear leukocytes. group b organisms caused a dose-dependent decrease in c-dependent chemotactic activity. the degree of inhibition was profound with 1 x 10(9) bacteria/ml (10% of control). experiments indicated that significant chemotactic  factor inactivation occurred within 2 min of exposure to gbs organisms, while maximal inhibition occurred after 30 min incubation. a number of different strains of gbs of types i, ii, and iii possessed inhibitory activity. in contrast, group d streptococci, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae failed to inhibit the c-derived chemotactic activity in human serum. group a streptococci that were m protein positive also inactivated c-dependent chemotactic activity in serum, as previously reported. the inhibitory activity of the gbs strains could be abolished by heat or trypsin treatment but not by neuraminidase, pronase, or pepsin. c5a levels in zymosan-activated serum as measured by ria were not decreased after incubation with an inhibitory strain  suggesting that absorption was not involved. sds-page analysis revealed that group b streptococci degrade the c5a molecule, increasing its electrophoretic mobility by removing a fragment with a m.w. of approximately 650 da. thus, one of the reasons for the poor inflammatory response at the site of gbs infection may reside in the ability of these pathogens to inactivate c-derived inflammatory mediators. the gbs c5a-ase activity probably serves as an additional virulence factor for these organisms contributing to the poor inflammatory response characteristic of group b streptococcal infection.

TI  == frequency of isolation of environmental mastitis-causing pathogens and incidence  of new intramammary infection during the nonlactating period.
AB  == quarter samples (n = 6,328) of mammary secretions were collected from 160 cows during physiologic transitions of the udder to determine the frequency of isolation of mastitis-causing pathogens and the incidence of new intramammary infections (imi) during the nonlactating period. none of the cows in the herd was infected with streptococcus agalactiae, and the prevalence of staphylococcus aureus was low. cows were not treated with antibiotics at cessation of milking. a threefold increase in the percentage of quarters infected with major mastitis-causing pathogens developed from late lactation to early involution. coliforms and streptococci other than str agalactiae accounted for 94% of major pathogen infections. the number of quarters infected with coagulase-negative staphylococci increased slightly from late lactation to early involution, whereas the number of quarters infected with corynebacterium bovis decreased markedly. major pathogens caused 101 of 153 imi at parturition and greater than 90% were caused by streptococci and coliforms. at parturition, 51 of 52 minor pathogen imi were caused by coagulase-negative staphylococci. during early lactation, there was a marked decrease in quarters infected with major pathogens; however, the number of quarters with major pathogen imi during early lactation was 2.3 times higher than the number of quarters infected before cessation of milking. the number of quarters with minor pathogen imi during early lactation was the same as at parturition, but a marked decrease in quarters infected with coagulase-negative staphylococci and a marked increase in c bovis imi developed from parturition to early lactation.

TI  == effects of fibronectin on the interaction of polymorphonuclear leukocytes with unopsonized and antibody-opsonized bacteria.
AB  == fibronectin (fn) affects the interaction of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (pmnls)  with certain bacteria. fn alone enhanced the response, in a chemiluminescence (cl) assay, of pmnls to staphylococcus aureus (p less than .05) and staphylococcus epidermidis (p less than .01) but had no effect on type iii, group b streptococci (gbs) or escherichia coli. when gbs or e. coli were first preopsonized in antibody, fn significantly enhanced the cl response of pmnls (p less than .05). the intracellular metabolic inhibitor nan3 but not the extracellular scavengers superoxide dismutase or human serum albumin inhibited fn-enhanced cl; this fact suggests that enhancement of the respiratory burst by fn is an intracellular event. we used an acridine orange-crystal violet monolayer assay to examine the effects of fn on ingestion and intracellular killing of bacteria by pmnls. fn alone promoted uptake and killing of s. aureus (p less than .01) and s. epidermidis (p less than .05) by pmnls but did not enhance monolayer  phagocytosis of gbs or e. coli, unless these bacteria were preopsonized in antibody (p less than .01).

AB  == a comparative study of phagocytosis and postphagocytic oxidative metabolic activity of bovine blood neutrophils incubated with pure and mixed cultures of escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus agalactiae was preformed. most neutrophils when incubated with mixed cultures showed preferential phagocytosis for one species and a smaller number phagocytized both  species of microorganisms. percent phagocytosis for e. coli in pure culture was similar to that of strep. agalactiae in pure culture and higher than that for staph. aureus in pure culture. neutrophils incubated with mixed cultures of e. coli and staph. aureus or e. coli and strep. agalactiae showed greater than expected phagocytosis of each microorganisms alone and reduced phagocytosis of both microorganisms together. postphagocytic oxidative metabolic activity of neutrophils, measured by percent nitroblue tetrazolium reduction, did not differ  following phagocytosis of these three microorganisms in pure cultures. in comparison, a synergistic effect on nitroblue tetrazolium reductive activity was  seen in mixed cultures as evidenced by higher percent nitroblue tetrazolium reduction following phagocytosis of both e. coli and staph. aureus or e. coli and strep. agalactiae. these observations indicate that the phagocytic and metabolic  activities of neutrophils for bacteria in mixed cultures may not be identical to  those in pure cultures.

AB  == bacteria contaminating amniotic fluid have anecdotally been shown to produce a phosphatidylglycerol-like substance, thus giving false positive tests for phosphatidylglycerol in vaginal pool fluid from patients with premature rupture of the membranes. isolates of escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, acinetobacter  calcoaceticus, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococcus, streptococcus faecalis, and streptococcus agalactiae (group b streptococcus) were grown in broth and analyzed for the presence of phosphatidylglycerol-like material by one-dimensional thin-layer chromatography and also by a polyclonal, immunologic slide agglutination test (amniostat-flm). all species demonstrated a positive test result for phosphatidylglycerol by either thin-layer chromatography, slide agglutination, or both. the material migrated separately from cardiolipin and phosphatidylethanolamine as determined by chromatography, but identically with the phosphatidylglycerol control. gram-negative species were more strongly positive than gram-positive organisms. colony counts on the order of 10(8) colony-forming units per milliliter were necessary to give positive test results for phosphatidylglycerol. the possible clinical implications of these findings are discussed.

AB  == the udders of 100 heifers were examined for clinical changes during parturition.  of each quarter colostral samples were taken and analyzed bacteriologically. 35 heifers (13.5% of the quarters) showed clinical changes of the quarters and/or of colostral samples. 14 of these animals (4.75% of the quarters) suffered from cellulitis-like mastitis. 13 (5.25% of the quarters) had acute catarrhalic mastitis and eight heifers (3.5% of the quarters) showed acute galactophoritis. in all milk samples of animals with pathological changes of the udder or of colostrum the causing bacteria could be identified. besides the group of 35 heifers with clinical lesions udder-pathogenic bacteria were found in samples of  24 apparently healthy animals (20.5% of the quarters) during parturition. however, these animals failed to show clinical signs of inflammation at least until the end of this study (10 days post partum). isolated bacteria included facultative and obligate pathogenic species, 70% of which were gram-positive cocci (i.e. streptococcus [sc.] uberis, sc. dysgalactiae, sc. agalactiae, staphylococcus aureus and other staphylococci) versus 30% of gram-negative bacteria (i.e. escherichia [e.] coli, klebsiella and other coliform species. in-vitro-susceptibility tests showed best effectiveness of penicillin against sc., cloxacillin against staphylococci and gentamycin and polymyxin b against coliform bacteria. possible pathways, leading to bacterial infection of first lactating heifers during parturition, are discussed. pathways of infection seem to be of lesser importance for the development of apparent, sometimes severe mastitis with coliform bacteria.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == bactericidal activity of teicoplanin in an in-vitro two-compartment kinetic model.
AB  == the bactericidal activity of teicoplanin was studied in a model system in which antibiotic concentration is continuously varied. a two-compartment open model was used to reproduce, in vitro serum pharmacokinetics of teicoplanin in humans during 24 h after iv administration. staphylococcal and streptococcal strains of  various species were tested. teicoplanin showed rapid killing of staphylococcus epidermidis and staph. hominis. all strains of staph. epidermidis were rapidly killed in spite of the high mic values (4-16 mg/l). the killing effect against staph. haemolyticus was less rapid and marked than against staph. epidermidis, with strain to strain variation. a 99.9% kill was achieved for most strains within 22 h, but with other isolates regrowth occurred which was due to the presence of highly resistant cells in the original population. other staphylococci (staph. aureus, staph. saprophyticus) and streptococcus pyogenes, str. bovis and str. salivarius were reduced by 99.9% within 22 h. bactericidal activity against other streptococci (str. mutans, str. agalactiae, str. faecalis, str. faecium) was less marked; against str. sanguis teicoplanin was bacteriostatic.

TI  == teicoplanin in combination therapy for febrile episodes in neutropenic and non-neutropenic paediatric patients.
AB  == the aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of teicoplanin in combination with other antimicrobial agents for therapy of severe suspected or proven gram-positive infection in children and also to determine a dosage regimen for paediatric patients. twenty children were given 23 courses of teicoplanin therapy for 11 septicaemias, one erysipelas, one cellulitis and 11 cases of fever of unknown origin. eighteen of the 20 patients had severe underlying disease: one solid tumour, 15 acute lymphoblastic leukaemias, two acute myeloblastic leukaemias; 15 were neutropenic; 19 had a central line. thirteen gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the blood cultures in eleven patients. there were eight coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns), (five methicillin-resistant) and four staphylococcus aureus isolates. teicoplanin was given as a 30 min infusion twice on the first day then once a day. the mean unit dose was 6 mg/kg for first  eight patients. one clinical failure and lower serum concentrations than expected led us to increase the dosage to 10 mg/kg daily for the remaining patients. tolerability remained excellent. it is concluded that antistaphylococcal treatment for febrile episodes in neutropenic patients can be satisfactorily provided by teicoplanin 10 mg/kg iv daily with a second loading dose on the first day. one injection a day is a convenient schedule in paediatrics.

TI  == group b streptococcal soft tissue infections beyond the neonatal period.
AB  == in one year sporadic soft tissue infections due to group b streptococci were identified in 37 patients beyond the neonatal period. serious underlying conditions were present in 25 patients (68%), including 17 (46%) who had diabetes mellitus and 4 (11%) with paraplegia. unlike previous reports, 12 patients (32%)  were previously healthy. infection developed in 8 persons as a result of minor trauma. the mean age of the normal hosts was 20.9 years, whereas the mean age of  patients with underlying disease was 44.2 years (p<.0005). the clinical spectrum  was varied and included abscess formation in 17 patients (46%). all patients required treatment with antibiotics and 28 (76%) required admission to hospital.  complete recovery occurred in 33 patients (89%) while 4 with diabetes required amputation of infected extremities. group b streptococcus was the only organism identified in 22 patients (59%) while mixed organisms were cultured in 15 (41%),  including staphylococcus aureus in 12 and gram-negative enteropathogens in 4. group b streptococcal soft tissue infections beyond the neonatal period are common and may even involve normal hosts.

TI  == interaction of soluble fibronectin with group b streptococci.
AB  == fibronectin binds to a variety of bacterial species, and we hypothesized that differential fibronectin binding might influence the invasive potential of group  b streptococci (gbs). human plasma fibronectin purified by a standard two-step chromatographic procedure was radiolabeled with 3h. fifty gbs strains (invasive,  colonizing, or bovine) representing serotypes ia (10 strains), ib (6 strains), ia/c (6 strains), ii (10 strains), iii (11 strains), iv (1 strain), and nontypable (6 strains) were tested. no source or serotype variability was detected among gbs strains, and binding was uniformly less than 1.5% of available fibronectin. lack of detectable binding occurred at both the log and stationary growth phases and persisted despite treatment with trypsin or neuraminidase or opsonization with immunoglobulin g containing high levels (greater than 40 micrograms/ml) of antibody specific for the ia, ii, or iii gbs capsular polysaccharides. incubation with gbs did not inhibit fibronectin binding to the cowan 1 strain of staphylococcus aureus. strain coh 31-15, an isogenic, type iii, capsule-deficient mutant of coh 31r/s, also failed to bind fibronectin. in contrast to other streptococci, gbs do not have readily detectable receptors for  soluble fibronectin as part of their surface structures. if present, binding sites for soluble fibronectin are deep to surface structures, obscured from host  defense systems, or require the presence of other factors to facilitate their recognition of fibronectin. the uniform ability of gbs to resist binding to soluble fibronectin could be a significant virulence factor in the pathogenesis of invasive infections of infants.

TI  == [the study of flomoxef in the pediatric field].
AB  == flomoxef (fmox; 6315-s), a new synthetic oxacephem antibiotic, was studied in the pediatric field and pharmacokinetic and clinical results obtained were summarized below. 1. the activity of fmox against staphylococcus aureus isolated from clinical patients, including latamoxef resistant strains was very high and mic was approximately less than or equal to 0.39 microgram/ml. this mic value was lower than other cephem antibiotics such as cefotaxime, cefotiam, cefmetazole, cefamandole. the distribution of mic's of fmox against escherichia coli and salmonella spp. ranged from 0.05 to 0.78 microgram/ml and from 0.05 to 0.39 microgram/ml, respectively. 2. serum concentrations of fmox after dosages of 20 mg/kg and 40 mg/kg with 1 hour intravenous drip infusion were 21.5-27.5 micrograms/ml, 6.00-7.81 micrograms/ml, 0.37-0.59 micrograms/ml at 1, 2, 5 hours  after administration, respectively, and t1/2(beta) were 0.61-0.83 hour. serum concentrations after one shot intravenous injection of 20 mg/kg fmox were 56.7-90.2 and 0.20-0.26 micrograms/ml at 3-10 minutes and 6 hours after administration, respectively, t1/2(beta) was 1.22 hours and urinary excretion rate was 66.7-69.8% in 6 hours. 3. fmox was administered to 32 cases (upper and lower respiratory tract infection, and purulent infections) at 3-4 times daily for 4-13 days. in these cases the daily dosage amounted to 41-119 mg/kg. clinical effectiveness was 97% overall including resistance cases upon other cephem antibiotic treatment. all bacterial species identified including branhamella catarrhalis, streptococcus pyogenes, s. aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, and haemophilus influenzae were eradicated upon the treatment with fmox. 4. only 3 cases of soft stool, 1 case of elevated got and gpt, and 1 case of elevated gpt were observed, and all of these adverse reactions were normalized after the completion of treatment.

TI  == bacterial adherence to the upper respiratory tract of ferrets infected with influenza a virus.
AB  == a ferret model was used to study bacterial adherence in animals with influenza. ferrets were inoculated intranasally with influenza a3/hong kong/1/68 virus. antiviral serum antibodies were apparent by day 5. on days 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11, three virus-inoculated and two uninoculated controls were anesthetized, exsanguinated, and decapitated, and the lower jaw was removed. each animal was inoculated intranasally with a 1-ml suspension containing 20 mg (dry wt) of either 3h-labeled staphylococcus aureus or 3h-labeled group b streptococcus type  ia and incubated for 45 min at ambient temperature. in animals challenged with staphylococci, 80% of the original inoculum remained free in suspension; of the remaining 20%, the distribution in the upper respiratory tracts of virus-infected and control animals was significantly different. of the staphylococci remaining in the nasopharynx of control animals, 74% was present in mucinous plugs, 11% was bound to host cells present in washes of the nasal cavity, and 15% was released by protease treatment of the nasopharynx. of the staphylococci remaining in the upper respiratory tract of virus-infected ferrets, 36% was recovered in plugs, 24% was bound to cells in nasal washes, and 40% was released by enzyme treatment. overall, adherence-positive staphylococci represented 64% of recoverable bacteria in virus-infected ferrets versus 26% in controls. adherence was increased twofold (days 5 and 7) to threefold (days 3, 9, and 11) in virus-infected ferrets compared to uninfected controls. in contrast, only 7% of the original streptococcal inoculum was recovered from virus-infected and uninfected control animals and virus infection did not enhance streptococcal adherence except for an approximately threefold increase that was seen on day 11.

TI  == neonatal septicemia in stockholm.
AB  == in a prospective study to determine the incidence and etiology of neonatal septicemia at karolinska hospital, stockholm, all cases of neonatal septicemia in infants born at the hospital from 1981 to 1985 were reviewed. there were 4.0 cases of neonatal septicemia per 1,000 live births during the study period. during the five year period the incidence of septicemia tended to increase, mainly due to the increasing incidence of septicemia in infants with a birth weight below 1,500 grams. the single most common causative organism was group b streptococci with an incidence of 1.4 per 1,000 live births, staphylococcus aureus accounting for 1.1 cases, staphylococcus epidermidis for 0.7 cases, and gram-negative rods for only 0.4 cases per 1,000 live births. in a retrospective study of the incidence of neonatal septicemia in a non-selected patient population, all cases in the stockholm area in 1983 were reviewed. in that year there were 17,586 live births in the area and the incidence of neonatal septicemia was 2.6 per 1,000 live births. group b streptococci, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and gram-negative rods were equally common as  causative agents.

AB  == two groups of dairy herds (16 herds/group) were studied to determine the relationship between the prevalence of mastitis in a herd and mean herd blood concentrations of vitamins a and e, beta-carotene, and selenium (se). one group had a dairy herd improvement association 12-month mean herd somatic cell count (scc) of less than or equal to 150,000 cells/ml. the second group had a dairy herd improvement association 12-month mean herd scc of greater than or equal to 700,000 cells/ml. once for each herd, duplicate milk samples were collected from  each quarter of the lactating cows, and blood samples were collected from 21 cows in various stages of lactation. serum concentrations of vitamin a, beta-carotene, and vitamin e and whole blood concentrations of se and se-dependent glutathione-peroxidase (gsh-px) were determined. significant differences between  the 2 groups were not found with respect to serum concentrations of vitamin a, vitamin e, or beta-carotene. however, the herds with the low scc (less than or equal to 150,000 cells/ml) had significantly higher mean (+/- sem) blood gsh-px activity (35.6 +/- 2.95 mu/mg of hemoglobin) than did the herds with the high scc (20.2 +/- 2.38 mu/mg of hb). whole blood concentrations of se also were significantly higher in the herds with low scc (0.133 +/- 0.010 microgram/ml of blood) than in the herds with high scc (0.074 +/- 0.007 microgram/ml of blood). significant negative correlations were found between the prevalence of intramammary infection with major pathogens and mean herd activity of gsh-px (r = -0.62) and mean herd concentrations of se (r = -0.66).

TI  == growth inhibition of mastitis pathogens by long-chain fatty acids.
AB  == staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus hyicus, streptococcus agalactiae, and corynebacterium bovis were tested for sensitivity to long-chain fatty acids predominant in teat canal keratin. antibacterial activity of free fatty acids on  each bacterial species was measured after 12 and 24 h in chemically defined media. polyene c18:2 and c18:3 acids were bactericidal to each species at less than or equal to 10(5) ng/ml-1. the most bacteriostatic saturated fatty acids were c12 and c14. streptococcus agalactiae growth was inhibited more by fatty acids after 24 h than after 12 h. no incubation time effect on growth responses of other species was determined. polyoxyethylenesorbitan monooleate had a neutralizing effect on the bactericidal activity of polyene acids on c. bovis. corynebacterium bovis were unable to grow in synthetic media containing individual free fatty acids as the sole source of preformed fatty acids. a relationship between bacterial species commonly isolated from bovine teat canals  with resistance to fatty acids predominant in keratin was not evident.

TI  == a two-center review of bacteremia in the community hospital.
AB  == there are fewer studies on bacteremia coming from the community hospital, where the practicing family physician is likely to see this problem, than from the university hospital. the hypothesis of this study was that patterns of bacteremia would be different between the two types of hospitals. two hundred four patient episodes of culture-proven bacteremia from two analogous community hospitals were reviewed. bacteremia was discovered in 2.6 of 1,000 patients, which is lower than reports from university hospitals. of the 213 organisms isolated, slightly more were gram-negative than gram-positive, whereas many tertiary care centers report  a preponderance of gram-negative organisms. about 20 percent of the episodes of bacteremia ended in death, a rate lower than in many tertiary care centers, and slightly more patients died of gram-negative than gram-positive bacteremia. the most common organisms in descending order were the streptococci and escherichia coli followed by staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus species, and streptococcus pneumoniae. the most common sources of bacteremia were, in decreasing order, urinary tract, source unknown, heart valve, and lung. the most  common underlying disorders were, in decreasing order, malignancy, diabetes mellitus, complicated urinary tract infection, valvular heart disease, and postoperative infection. correctness of treatment of bacteremia appeared to increase survival.

AB  == amniotic fluid obtained from normal full term gestation inhibited the growth of e. coli, staph. aureus and b. subtilis, while ps. aeruginosa, str. faecalis and str. agalactiae proliferated readily in amniotic fluid. but when amniotic fluid was heated at 100 degrees c for 5 minutes, its antibacterial activity was completely lost. the levels of transferrin and lysozyme in amniotic fluid at term were determined to be 29.1 +/- 17.6 mg/100 ml (n = 90) and 19.1 +/- 8.3 micrograms/ml (n = 145), respectively. antibacterial activity against e. coli was restored by adding transferrin into heat-treated amniotic fluid at a concentration of 250 mg/100 ml or higher, but simultaneous addition of transferrin and sufficient concentration of iron to form a transferrin-iron complex resulted in the loss of antibacterial activities. when lysozyme was added to the amniotic fluid, which had lost its antibacterial activity through exposure to heat, the antibacterial effect on b. subtilis was restored. the growth of staph. aureus in heat-treated amniotic fluid was inhibited by the concomitant addition of lysozyme and aminobenzyl penicillin.

TI  == silver-coated nylon fiber as an antibacterial agent.
AB  == a blend of nylon fiber and silver-coated nylon fiber (the latter known as x-static) was used in these experiments. this fiber was bactericidal when bacteria were exposed to it directly or to an extract derived from its prior incubation in salt solution. at ambient temperatures, a rapid exponential decrease of survival occurred, usually after a delay of approximately 1 h. the rate of killing (decrease of survival) increased with an increase in x-static percentage of the fiber blend, temperature of fiber extraction, concentration of  tris buffer present during extraction, and temperature at which bacteria were exposed to the extract. when bacteria were exposed to the extract at 37 degrees c as opposed to ambient temperature, there was no delay in onset of killing. escherichia coli was generally the indicator organism tested, but comparable results were also found for pseudomonas, klebsiella, staphylococcus, and streptococcus species. the rate of killing increased with increasing silver ion concentration of the fiber extract, as determined through atomic absorption spectrophotometry. the rate of killing was greater and the onset was earlier with an extract containing silver ions from fiber than with a salt solution containing the same concentration of silver ions from silver nitrate. studies of the kinetics of ion release suggested that x-static may be an effective, sustained-release antibacterial agent.

TI  == [antibacterial activity of cephem antibiotics against isolates from clinical specimens at the yokohama city university hospital].
AB  == minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of cephem antibiotics against 405 strains belonging to 17 species of clinical isolates were investigated using the  standard method of the japanese congress of chemotherapy. the results obtained are summarized below. cephem antibiotics showed weak antibacterial activities against enterococcus sp., b. fragilis and s. marcescens. s. pneumoniae, s. agalactiae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae and p. mirabilis were susceptible to cephem antibiotics. cephem antibiotics of the 1st and the 2nd generations showed weak antibacterial activity against citrobacter sp. and e. cloacae, while cephem antibiotics of 3rd generation had a good antibacterial activity against these species. cephem antibiotics of the 2nd and the 3rd generations showed high antibacterial activity against h. influenzae and indole positive proteus group. cefoperazone showed high antibacterial activity against p. aeruginosa. resistance to latamoxef, ceftizoxime and cefoxitin was observed among staphylococcus sp., while the mics of other antibiotics against staphylococcus sp. were fairly low. number of strains resistant to the 3rd cephem antibiotics seems to be increasing  because the 3rd generation of cephem antibiotics have been used frequently. further investigation will be required on resistant organism to these antibiotics including beta-lactamase producing strains.

TI  == relationship between mastitis pathogen numbers in bulk tank milk and bovine udder infections in california dairy herds.
AB  == samples of bulk tank milk and cow-composite milk from 23,138 dairy cows from 50 california dairies were examined by use of microbiologic procedures. the number of colonies of mastitis pathogens isolated per milliliter of bulk tank milk (used as a predictor of the percentage of infected cows in the herd) was evaluated, using simple regression analysis and spearman's rank correlation. correlations between the pathogens and the percentage of cows in each herd shedding the pathogens were found for streptococcus agalactiae (r = 0.71) and mycoplasma (r =  0.59), but were considerably lower for other pathogens. when greater than or equal to 4,000 colonies of streptococcus agalactiae were found per milliliter of  bulk tank milk, at least 7% of the cows in the herd was shedding this organism. however, a pattern was not found between the number of mycoplasma colonies per milliliter of bulk tank milk and the percentage of infected cows in the herd.

TI  == does the hygroscopic property of the laminaria tent imply a risk for ascending infection in legal abortions? a microbiological study.
AB  == in 53 women admitted for first-trimester abortion, the cervical canal was dilated with laminaria tents prior to vacuum aspiration. before insertion of the tents, endocervical specimens were taken for microbiological investigations, including chlamydia trachomatis, and both aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms. the laminaria tents, widened by their hygroscopic properties, were removed just before the vacuum aspiration and sent for cultivation of aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms. the gram-positive aerobic cocci, staph. epidermidis, strept. faecalis and strept. agalactiae as well as escherichia coli and klebsiella/enterobacter were the most frequent microorganism among the aerobic isolates from the endocervices as well as from the laminaria tents. these microorganisms were identified on the tents in greater numbers than in the cervices. staph. aureus was isolated from three laminaria tents, but only one of  these 3 women was proved to be primarily colonized endocervically. among the anaerobes, bacteroidaceae followed by peptococci and peptostreptococci were the predominant genera found in the cervix as well as on the removed laminaria tents. these three groups of anaerobic microorganisms were found markedly less frequently on the laminaria tents than in the endocervix. on the other hand, strept. intermedius, another anaerobe of possible enteric origin, was recovered from 9 laminaria tents but not in the cervices. since no cases of clinically verified endometritis/salpingitis were registered in the present study it is concluded that the risk of a pelvic inflammatory disease (pid) due to the laminaria tent is negligible as long as the laminaria treatment does not exceed 24 hours.

AB  == using haemolysis in gel, two bacterial igg-binding substances, an fc-receptor isolated from group a streptococci type m15, and protein a from staphylococcus aureus, were shown to inhibit complement-mediated lysis of sheep erythrocytes sensitized with rabbit igg. when the crude alkaline extracts of ten types of group a streptococci were tested to see whether streptococcal components other than fc-binding material might affect lysis, the degree of inhibition was found to be correlated with fc-binding activity. in no case was the lysis of igm-coated cells inhibited. opsonophagocytosis experiments showed that both purified streptococcal fc-receptor and protein a impaired antibody complement-dependent killing by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes of each of two strains of group b streptococci (lacking igg fc-receptors). furthermore, the impairment was ascribable to interference with the fixation of complement to the antibodies, as  demonstrated in pre-opsonization experiments with one of the strains. our results suggest that blocking of the binding of complement to igg is an important virulence mechanism in fc-receptor-bearing streptococci and staphylococci.

TI  == comparative susceptibility of group b streptococci and staphylococcus aureus to killing by oxygen metabolites.
AB  == group b streptococci (gbs) lack catalase, and they produce and release h2o2;thus, they should be readily killed by phagocytes with a diminished respiratory burst.  surprisingly, although strains of staphylococcus aureus were killed at h2o2 concentrations greater than 0.5 mm, gbs strains were killed only at concentrations greater than 5mm. in contrast, gbs were killed by hydroxyl radicals generated by the xanthine oxidase-acetaldehyde system at o2 fluxes greater than or equal to 3.5 nmol/ml per min, whereas o2 fluxes greater than or equal to 10 nmol/ml per min were required to kill the s. aureus strains. results  with virulent and laboratory strains of gbs were similar. the differences in susceptibility of gbs and s. aureus seemed to correlate with differences in content of endogenous oxygen-metabolite scavengers. gbs contained approximately 100-fold more glutathione and approximately 20-fold more glutathione reductase than did s. aureus, whereas s. aureus was rich in catalase that gbs lacked. gbs that were grown in buthionine sulfoximine, however, contained 87% less glutathione than did controls but were not more susceptible to killing by h2o2 or the xanthine oxidase-acetaldehyde system. similarly, the relative susceptibility  of gbs to tert-butyl hydroperoxide and h2o2 paralleled that of s. aureus. thus, inherent differences in susceptibility of vital cellular functions to oxidative damage rather than content of oxygen-metabolite scavengers may account for the differences in susceptibility of gbs and s. aureus.

AB  == a 75-year-old man with stage iv chronic lymphocytic leukemia was seen for tingling in the left arm, vesicular rash confined to the dorsum of the left hand, and diffuse erythema and swelling that extended to the elbow. gram's stain of material aspirated from the cellulitic area revealed gram-positive cocci. blood cultures grew group b streptococci, and cultures of material from the cellulitic  area grew group b streptococci and staphylococcus aureus. cellulitis with bacteremia was diagnosed, and seven-day drug therapy with acyclovir (zovirax) and penicillin g was started. the cellulitis resolved and the vesicular lesions crusted over within seven days. group b streptococci, traditionally regarded as pathogens of neonates, are becoming an increasingly important cause of infection  in adults. primary care physicians who care for adults, especially those who are  elderly, should include group b streptococci in the differential diagnosis of cellulitis.

TI  == effect of automatic backflushing on number of new intramammary infections, bacteria on teatcup liners, and milk iodine.
AB  == effect of an automatic iodine (15 ppm) backflushing system on incidence of new intramammary infections, teatcup liner bacterial populations, and milk iodine was tested in a herd free of streptococcus agalactiae and with a low prevalence of staphylococcus aureus. in an 11-mo trial, backflushing was applied to teatcups that milked the right half of the udder; the left half served as control. clawpieces were divided into left and right halves with each having a milk outlet. postmilking teat dipping was discontinued. all lactating cows in the university herd were used, averaging 154 with normal attrition and additions of new individuals as they calved. backflushing reduced numbers of staphylococci recovered from liners by 98.5% and gram-negative bacteria by 99.5% as compared with unflushed liners. backflushing significantly reduced new infections caused by corynebacterium bovis. however, there was no effect on incidence of new infections by staphylococci, streptococci, or coliforms. iodine concentrations averaged 243 micrograms per liter in milk from control quarters and 486 micrograms from backflushed udder halves. interior surface cracking was more severe in backflushed teatcup liners than in control liners. these results do not justify the use of backflushing in a herd with low prevalence of contagious pathogens.

AB  == the involvement of toxic oxygen intermediates in the bacteriostatic effect of milk was determined by producing bacterial growth curves using turbidimetry in the presence and absence of oxygen radical-scavenging substances. using whey as substrate, catalase, haemoglobin combined with ascorbic acid and xanthine oxidase inhibitors all provided protection against oxygen toxicity for a strain of staphylococcus aureus and of streptococcus agalactiae. superoxide dismutase and mannitol were less effective. this was evident in whey alone and in the presence  of oxygen radicals produced exogenously by the t-butylhydroperoxide, h2o2 and xanthine/xanthine oxidase systems.

TI  == mode of action and in-vitro activity of vancomycin.
AB  == vancomycin is a unique glycopeptide structurally unrelated to any currently available antibiotic. it also has a unique mode of action inhibiting the second stage of cell wall synthesis of susceptible bacteria. there is also evidence that vancomycin alters the permeability of the cell membrane and selectively inhibits  ribonucleic acid synthesis. induction of bacterial l-phase variants from susceptible organisms with vancomycin is extremely difficult, and such variants are unstable. stable l-phase variants induced by other agents are susceptible to  vancomycin. vancomycin is active against a large number of species of gram-positive bacteria, such as staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant strains), staph. epidermidis (including multiple-resistant  strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (including multiple-resistant strains), str. pyogenes, str. agalactiae, str. bovis, str. mutans, viridans streptococci, enterococci, clostridium species, diphtheroids, listeria monocytogenes, actinomyces species and lactobacillus species. there has been no increase in resistance to vancomycin during the past three decades. enhancement of antimicrobial activity has been demonstrated with the combination of vancomycin and an aminoglycoside against staph. aureus, str. bovis, enterococci and viridans streptococci. the combination of vancomycin and rifampicin are antagonistic to most strains of staph. aureus, though indifference and occasionally synergism have been shown, but is synergistic against strains of staph. epidermidis. it shows indifference against enterococci. vancomycin and fusidic acid are indifferent against staph. aureus.

TI  == reversible inhibition of bacterial growth after specific inhibition of spermidine synthase by dicyclohexylamine.
AB  == the effect of dicyclohexylamine on seven freshly isolated bacterial strains of mastitis pathogens was studied. streptococcus uberis was the most sensitive strain investigated, since 5 mm-dicyclohexylamine totally arrested its growth and 1.25 mm of the drug caused 60% growth inhibition. the staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were also sensitive to the drug, but less so than strep. uberis, since 5 mm drug caused only partial inhibition of growth. micrococcus sp. and klebsiella sp. grew in the presence of  10.0 mm-dicyclohexylamine, and, finally the growth of streptococcus agalactiae was not at all affected by dicyclohexylamine. these different sensitivities towards dicyclohexylamine in vivo were paralleled by different sensitivities of the bacteria's spermidine synthase to the drug in vitro, and also by the ability  of the drug to lower spermidine concentration in bacterial cells. spermidine synthase from sensitive bacteria was inhibited by more than 90% by 50 microm-dicyclohexylamine in vitro, and the concentration of spermidine was decreased in e. coli and ps. aeruginosa by 70% and in strep. uberis by 95%, whereas in strep. agalactiae 5 mm-dicyclohexylamine did not affect the concentration of spermidine at all. dicyclohexylamine treatment led to the accumulation of putrescine in strep. uberis. spermidine synthesis catalysed by the extracts of micrococcus sp. required 500 microm-dicyclohexylamine for 90% inhibition, and strep. agalactiae contained a spermidine synthase that was still  active at 1000 microm-dicyclohexylamine, the observed inhibition of growth was totally reversed by adding 50 microm-spermidine (final concentration) to the medium. putrescine reversed the inhibition only when bacteria had a spermidine synthase activity insensitive to dicyclohexylamine. spermine did not overcome the inhibition of growth caused by dicyclohexylamine, probably because it was not taken up by the bacterial cells used in this study. the inhibition of the growth  by dicyclohexylamine (even in the case of strep. uberis) was reversible in the sense that addition of 50 microm-spermidine 18 h after dicyclohexylamine still restored the growth rate of untreated controls.

AB  == several tests, bacitracin, camp, pyroglutamic acid-b-naphthylamide test (pyr test), bile aesculin hydrolysis, salt tolerance and pigment production tests were evaluated for their reliability and speed in presumptive identification of streptococci. bacitracin correctly identified all of the group a streptococci but 5% of other beta haemolytic streptococci were misidentified as group a. the pyr reaction was just as sensitive but more specific for group a streptococci and the results were available within 2-3 h. the pyr reaction also effectively differentiated between enterococcal and non-enterococcal group d streptococci. both the salt tolerance test and the pyr reaction misidentified bile aesculin positive non-group d streptococci as non-enterococcal group d streptococci. pigment production by group b streptococci was more reliable than the camp test for identifying group b streptococci. the combination of pyr, bile aesculin and pigment production allowed rapid differentiation of several medically important groups of streptococci.

TI  == the importance of hygienic procedures in controlling mastitis.
AB  == properly designed and instituted sanitation will improve milk quality and reduce  mastitis. the majority of mammary infections occur during milking. since the populations of pathogenic organisms on the teat are directly correlated to the incidence of udder infections, hygienic practices in the milking parlor are of major importance to accomplish effective mastitis control. the organisms causing  mastitis have two general sources. the contagious pathogens originating from infected udders are passed from cow to cow. the environmental agents are ubiquitous, gaining entrance to the mammary gland from external sources; they do  not rely on intramammary infection for survival in the dairy environment. cow hygiene in the milking parlor consists of three separate steps: premilking cleansing, sanitation of the milking unit between cows, and covering the teats with a germicide after milking. each step has separate requirements in terms of product selection, concentration of germicide, time commitment, and mechanical assistance. premilking sanitation is most effective against coliform-like infections as well as the other environmentals. unit flushing and teat dipping are the greater deterrents to infection from the contagious pathogens, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, and the mycoplasma species. extra care needs to be given to hygiene measures when infusing the mammary gland  with antibiotics. dipping the teats in an effective germicide both before and after infusion is highly effective in reducing mammary infections. fresh cows and sick cows are both highly susceptible to infection. only minimal sanitation of these animals while milking is generally practiced. dipping prior to milking and  leaving the germicide in contact with the teat while milking can be recommended as an additional procedure to reduce pathogens. all products used during milking  should bear the label for product safety in food environments, and judicious use  should not threaten product safety through potential residues.

TI  == relationships between linear type scores, objective type measures, and indicators of mastitis.
AB  == objectives were to examine the usefulness of objective measures of conformation and linear scores for type for predicting indicators of mastitis. approximately 300 cows in five herds were scored in the experimental linear classification program of the holstein-friesian association of america, measured objectively for numerous components of conformation, and evaluated for four indicators of mastitis. indicators of mastitis were average natural logarithm of somatic cell counts during the lactation, percent of samples (taken approximately every 3 mo)  infected during a lactation, percent of samples infected with staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, klebsiella, and percent of samples with signs of mastitic milk. relationships between conformation and mastitis often were inconsistent because of moderate or low correlations between  indicators of mastitis. indicators of mastitis were predicted from results of multiple regression analyses with subjective scores and objective measures of type as independent variables. largest differences of predicted indicators of mastitis from variation in any single type trait were sufficient to be important  economically, but average differences were much smaller. selection to reduce frequencies of cows with deep udders, especially low rear udders, widely placed teats, rear teats too far back, and teats that are short and wide, may augment, modestly, efforts to reduce incidence of mastitis through improved sanitation, antibiotic treatment, and proper milking procedures.

TI  == the susceptibility of bovine udder quarters colonized with corynebacterium bovis  to experimental infection with staphylococcus aureus or streptococcus agalactiae.
AB  == twenty bovine udder quarters colonized with corynebacterium bovis sr6 and 20 uncolonized quarters were challenged by inoculation of staphylococcus aureus newbould 305 (atcc 29740) into the teat cistern. the percentage of infection in quarters colonized with c. bovis (50%) was significantly lower than that in controls (100%). by similar challenge no significant difference was observed between the percentage of infection with streptococcus agalactiae atcc 27956 in 33 quarters colonized with c. bovis (70%) compared to 33 controls (87.9%). a total of 37 quarters colonized with c. bovis and 37 control quarters were challenged with staph. aureus newbould 305 (atcc 29740) and maxi (atcc 27543) and strep. agalactiae (atcc 27956) by exposure of the teat orifice. the percentage of teat ducts colonized with c. bovis which became infected with either pathogen was not different from that for controls.

TI  == correlation between opsonic activity for various microorganisms and composition of gammaglobulin preparations for intravenous use.
AB  == in this study 12 commercial immunoglobulin preparations for intravenous administration were investigated with respect to their opsonic activity for various strains of staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, streptococcus pyogenes, and group b streptococci, and in addition, the concentration of unsplit igg molecules, igg fragments, and igg aggregates (dimers) was determined. the results show that four preparations that had been treated with enzyme or by reduction and alkylation had hardly any opsonic activity; the other preparations  were as effective as inactivated serum. a statistical analysis showed an excellent correlation between the concentration of intact igg molecules in a preparation and the opsonic activity for the various bacteria; a negative correlation between the concentration of igg fragments and the opsonic activity was found. the combination of the two techniques used in this study provides a basis for recommendations on the choice of gammaglobulin preparations for clinical use.

TI  == comparative opsonic activity of intravenous gamma globulin preparations for common bacterial pathogens.
AB  == immune globulin intravenous is a reduced and alkylated preparation of gamma globulin that is stabilized in 10 percent maltose and 0.1 m glycine at ph 6.8. recently, a modified immune globulin intravenous preparation was developed that is identical to the standard preparation except that it does not contain glycine  and the ph has been lowered to 5.25. the effect of these modifications has resulted in a higher igg monomer content in the preparation. in the present studies the opsonic activity against several common bacterial pathogens was assessed in the standard (ph 6.8) versus the more acidic immune globulin intravenous (ph 5.25). opsonic activity was detected in each preparation for staphylococcus aureus, group b streptococci, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia  coli, and serratia marcescens. with all of the organisms except s. marcescens, an intact complement system was required for optimal uptake and killing with each preparation. in general, the opsonic activity of the ph 5.25 immune globulin intravenous was equivalent to the standard ph 6.8 preparation. with several organisms, however, the more acidic preparation had greater activity than the standard one. an immune globulin intravenous preparation with increased antibody  titers to p. aeruginosa was also prepared from selected donors and tested for opsonic activity against six of the seven pseudomonas immunotypes. this preparation was found to have strikingly increased opsonic titers for most of the pseudomonas immunotypes when compared with the standard immune globulin intravenous. these studies indicate that changes in donor selection or minor modifications in production techniques may markedly affect the biologic activity  of intravenous gamma globulin.

AB  == changes in the level of the tissue damage marker enzyme, n-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase (nagase) in quarter fore milks were found to be related to the presence and types of pathogenic bacteria present and to somatic cell counts (scc). minor pathogens (coagulase-negative staphylococci, corynebacterium bovis) elicited a mild scc increase (from a mean of 243 x 10(3)/ml in healthy quarters to 504 x 10(3)/ml in infected quarters) with marginal tissue damage (mean nagase activity increased from 21 in healthy quarters to 28 in infected quarters). major pathogens (i.e. staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, str. dysgalactiae and str. uberis) caused more  severe tissue damage (mean nagase of 48) and scc increases (mean, 2803 x 10(3)/ml). the nagase test could also be used effectively on composite milk samples where regular monthly nagase analysis was able to identify correctly 74%  of animals having infected quarters. the possibility of combining scc and nagase  data in order to give a more definite diagnosis of bovine mastitis is discussed.

TI  == chloralanyl and propargylglycyl dipeptides. suicide substrate containing antibacterials.
AB  == a set of dipeptides containing the amino acid residues beta-chloroalanine and propargylglycine, which are mechanism-based inactivators of purified microbial enzymes (alanine racemase and cystathionine gamma-synthase, respectively), have been synthesized, and their antibacterial properties in vitro have been evaluated. dipeptides containing a single beta-chloro-l-alanyl residue (e.g., 3,  5, 9, and 10) or a single l-propargylglycyl residue (e.g., 12 and 15) are potent  antibacterials. the in vitro antibiotic activity of beta-chloro-l-alanine and of  l-propargylglycine is increased as much as 4000-fold by incorporation of these residues into a dipeptide. compounds that contain only a single enzyme-inactivating amino acid together with a second l-alanyl residue (3, 5, 12, and 15) have a restricted range of activity: of the species tested, only streptococcus agalactiae, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis are sensitive. however, peptides that contain two suicide-substrate residues [e.g., beta-cl-lala-beta-cl-lala (8) or lppgly-lppgly (18)] are broad-spectrum antibacterials; as many as 12 different species of the 16 surveyed are sensitive. dipeptides that contain an amino-terminal l-methionyl (9) or an l-norvalyl (10) residue and a carboxy-terminal beta-chloro-l-alanyl unit are also effective against a large number of organisms; the spectra of activity are like those seen  for 8 and 18. a "mixed" dipeptide [beta-cl-lala-lppgly, (21)] gives apparent synergism of antibiotic action of beta-chloro-l-alanine and of l-propargylglycine when these two residues are incorporated into a single structure. peptides of the d,d configuration (4, 6, 13, 16, and 20) and ones of l,d stereochemistry (e.g., 7) are not antibacterials. peptides containing one (11 and 14) and two (17) d,l-propargylglycyl residues are unresolved sets of diastereomers; the mixtures of compounds are between two- and fourfold less active than the correspondingly resolved l,l dipeptides (12, 15, and 18). these findings are consistent with a mechanism of action for these antibiotics involving stereoselective processing of the peptidyl unit in vivo.

TI  == effects of antibiotic treatment of nonlactating dairy cows on antibiotic resistance patterns of bovine mastitis pathogens.
AB  == antibiotic resistance patterns of the major groups of bovine mastitis pathogens (streptococcus agalactiae, other streptococci, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis) were examined by determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of 13 different antibiotics against bacterial isolates from dairy cattle. the bacterial strains were obtained from milk samples from each cow in 21 new york state dairy herd surveys. in 12 herd surveys (high antibiotic-use  group), all 365 cows received antibiotic infusions into the udder at the cessation of each lactation cycle. the 324 animals in the other nine herd surveys (low antibiotic-use group) did not routinely receive antibiotics during the nonlactation period. the mics from the two groups were compared by calculating for each bacterial group the average mic, the antibiotic concentration necessary  to inhibit 90% of the isolates, and the antibiotic concentration necessary to inhibit 50% of the isolates. increased resistance to all 13 antibiotics was observed with streptococcus agalactiae isolates from the high antibiotic use herds. however, there was relatively little difference between the two groups in  the resistance patterns of the other bacterial species examined. the most important finding of the study was the identification of a multiple beta-lactam resistance phenotype in streptococcus agalactiae.

TI  == mastitis control: a discussion.
AB  == methods of mastitis control that are effective against streptococcus agalactiae and staphylococcus aureus have been developed and proven successful. these control procedures, however, are not as effective against the environmental pathogens. environmental pathogens are predominantly the coliform bacteria and species of streptococci other than streptococcus agalactiae. the total extent of  their present involvement in mastitis is not well documented, and this is due in  part to differences in the nature of infection by environmental pathogens compared to streptococcus agalactiae and staphylococcus aureus infections. concern regarding the importance of environmental pathogens in mastitis is increasing. this concern is based, first, on current trends of dairy cattle housing and management that increase exposure to teat ends to environmental pathogens and, second, on a reduction of prevalence of streptococcus agalactiae and staphylococcus aureus infected quarters. the latter is a result of the effectiveness of postmilking teat end disinfection and dry cow therapy. development of equally effective control methods for the environmental pathogens  will be an important area of future mastitis research.

AB  == in a 270-cow dairy herd, milk samples from all cows with acute mastitis were cultured during a 12-month period. of 119 isolates (from 166 quarters), 49% were  gram-positive organisms, 39% were gram-negative organisms, and 12% were yeasts. of all samples from cows with acute mastitis, 40% failed to produce colonies on culture media. recovery of the common gram-positive pathogens, staphylococcus aureus (11% of isolations) and streptococcus agalactiae (1% of isolations), was rather low. however, s epidermidis (14% of isolations) and streptococci other than str agalactiae (9% of isolations) were recovered more frequently than expected, particularly in recently calved cows. coliform organisms accounted for  35% of the total isolates and were the single most important cause of acute mastitis. of 42 cows with coliform mastitis, 6 died despite intensive antibiotic  and electrolyte therapy. there was no death loss among cows with mastitis caused  by gram-positive organisms. antimicrobial susceptibilities of 95 isolates to 11 antimicrobials was determined by standardized methods. organisms were most often  susceptible to chloramphenicol, cephalothin, and gentamicin. a treatment regimen  consisting primarily of oxytetracycline and/or sulfonamides systemically in conjunction with intramammary infusions of cephapirin was evaluated. treatment response in 37 quarters was determined by culturing before treatment and at 4 or  more days after treatment. of 23 quarters initially culture-positive, 22 were negative on reculture. treatment response appeared to agree with the results of the susceptibility testing.

TI  == short-time low-temperature pasteurisation of human milk.
AB  == using the oxford human milk pasteuriser human milk was exposed to lower temperature and shorter time periods than employed in classical holder pasteurisation. heating human milk at 62.5 degrees c for 5 min completely destroyed escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, and group b beta-haemolytic streptococci inoculated into the samples. heating at 56.0 degrees c for 15 min destroyed over 99% of the inoculated organisms. the mean percentage remaining activity of certain antimicrobial proteins after heat treatment at 62.5 degrees c for 30 min, 62.5 degrees c for 5 min and 56 degrees c for 15 min were as follows: iga 67, and 90%; lactoferrin 27, 59 and 91%; and lysozyme 67, 96 and 106%, respectively. these results suggest that human milk can be effectively pasteurised using less heat treatment than in classical holder pasteurisation. lower temperature and shorter heat treatment also preserves substantially more of the activity of the antimicrobial proteins present in human milk.

TI  == antibody response in lacteal secretions of cows after immunization with various concentrations of staphylococcal and streptococcal antigens.
AB  == a total of 55 lactating holstein cows were randomly allocated to 6 groups. five of these groups (no. 2 through 6) were inoculated on 2 occasions in the region of the external inguinal lymph node with various concentrations of 3 bacterial antigens. saline solution was administered to group 6 as a control. the antigen preparations consisted of a staphylococcus aureus bacterin, a streptococcus agalactiae bacterin, and staphylococcal alpha-toxoid. these antigens were administered as a composite preparation suspended in saline solution. the concentration of antibody in the lacteal secretions, represented by immunoglobulin g specific for each of the 3 vaccine antigens, was monitored during the 18-week experimental period by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. the  concentration of each of the 3 vaccine components which was required to stimulate a maximal immune response in the lactating gland appears to have been established.

TI  == group b streptococcal pneumonia in the elderly.
AB  == group b streptococcal infections, although well studied in neonates, have only recently been appreciated as important infectious agents in adults. seven cases of group b streptococcal pneumonia were verified by transtracheal aspiration, blood and sputum cultures, or multiple stab cultures at autopsy. the infections were largely nosocomial and, ultimately, fatal in all seven patients. our patients were older (average age, 73 years) and much more debilitated than the 13 cases reported in the literature. diabetes was less common than previously reported. previous antibiotic therapy was common. concomitant isolation of another organism (especially staphylococcus aureus) occurred in five patients. the morphologic findings at autopsy, in one patient, were characterized by a severely necrotizing destructive process. in our experience, group b streptococcal pneumonia is more common, more devastating, and occurs in an older  population than previously reported.

TI  == gram-positive bacteria-induced granulocytopenia and pulmonary leukostasis in rabbits.
AB  == pneumococci have been shown to induce granulocytopenia and pulmonary leukostasis  which might contribute to morbidity and mortality in pneumococcal sepsis. we studied whether other gram-positive species (groups a and b streptococci, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, and clostridium perfringens) could also induce these phenomena. rabbits were challenged with nonviable preparations of each species, and all five species induced profound granulocytopenia (mean decrease of 90%) and pulmonary leukostasis. in vitro studies of serum incubated with these species of bacteria showed a mean consumption of total hemolytic complement of 90%, a mean increase of chemotactic activity for granulocytes of 204%, and a mean augmentation of granulocyte adherence of 45% (compared with 18%  for the control). infusion of sonicate-exposed sera induced granulocytopenia in recipient rabbits. thus, several nonviable gram-positive species can interact with serum to activate the complement system, generate c5a bioactivity, augment granulocyte adherence, and generate a neutropenia-inducing factor. these alterations may contribute to granulocytopenia or pulmonary leukostasis, which may play a role in the morbidity and mortality associated with gram-positive bacterial infections.

AB  == camp-factor, the exosubstance of streptococcus agalactiae, and uberis-factor, the exosubstance of streptococcus uberis, exerted lethal effect when administered parenterally to rabbits and white mice. a single intravenous dosis of 1,500 activity units per 1 kg body weight resulted in rapid death of the rabbits. to kill mice, the intravenous or intraperitoneal dosis had to be 45 times higher in  relation to the body mass. after formaldehyde treatment, both streptococcal exosubstances were deprived of their lethal effect as well as of their synergistic hemolytic activity with the staphylococcal beta-toxin.

TI  == effect of csf on bacterial growth.
AB  == the growth patterns of five potentially pathogenic bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, group b beta-hemolytic streptococcus, and klebsiella pneumoniae) and a commonly encountered, nonpathogenic microorganism (s epidermidis) were compared using csf, trypticase soy broth (tsb), and a phosphate buffer. each grew less in csf than in tsb. escherichia coli was least affected with a median difference of 2 logarithms between csf and tsb at 24 hours of growth, whereas s epidermidis was markedly inhibited, with a median difference of 6.85 logarithms. the differences among the remaining four organisms ranged from 3.86 to 5.94 logarithms, all significantly greater than that for e. coli. similar results were obtained at 48 hours of growth. the non-support of bacterial growth by csf may constitute a host defense  mechanism. the basis of these observations may be the presence of inhibitors or the absence of nutrients required for bacterial growth in the csf.

AB  == the use of corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis or of its hemolytically active exosubstance for the detection of staphylococcal hemolysins represents a suitable alterative to the use of the beta-toxin producing strain of staphylococcus aureus, or of isolated beta-toxin. an increased capture of beta-toxin production  was recorded when the camp-factor of streptococcus agalactiae was used. a total of 446 staphylococcus aureus strains and 48 coagulase-negative staphylococal strains were tested against the prepurified form of hemolytically active exosubstance of corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis and against the camp-factor. the results obtained are in agreement with the testing by means of staphylococcal beta-toxin and of the camp-factor. the two modifications of the method for the detection of staphylococcal hemolysins using one plate as proposed by the authors give good results. their ability of assessment, however, is higher by one degree  when the exocubstance of corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis is employed.

TI  == in vitro activity of ly127935.
AB  == ly127935 is a unique new beta-lactam antibiotic. its activity against 536 clinical isolates was studied by using microdilution methods of susceptibility testing and compared with the activities of cefamandole, cefoxitin, and cephalothin. the lowest concentrations required to inhibit at least 90% of strains tested (mic(90)s) of ly127935 for staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, and streptococcus pneumoniae ranged from 2 to 8 mug/ml. the mic(90)s for other staphylococci and streptococci were higher. the  mic(90)s for enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas species ranged from 0.12 to 8 mug/ml and 8 to >32 mug/ml, respectively. the mic(90)s for anaerobes ranged from  2 to >32 mug/ml. as determined by mic(90)s, ly127935 was consistently the least active antibiotic against facultatively anaerobic gram-positive cocci and the most active against aerobic and facultatively anaerobic gram-negative bacilli. its position with respect to activity against anaerobes varied from being the most active against bacteroides fragilis and clostridium perfringens to the least active against anaerobic cocci. in a population of multidrug-resistant isolates,  concentrations of 8 mug or less of ly127935 per ml inhibited 82% of enterobacteriaceae; concentrations of 32 mug or less per ml inhibited 100% of enterobacteriaceae and 40% of p. aeruginosa. increasing the inoculum size by 100-fold did not increase the minimal inhibitory concentrations of ly127935 or cefoxitin but did increase minimal inhibitory concentrations of cefamandole and cephalothin for some enterobacteriaceae. all four drugs were bactericidal; minimal bactericidal concentrations were the same or one concentration higher than minimal inhibitory concentrations for 91 to 96% of strains tested. the broad spectrum and marked in vitro activity of ly127935 make it a promising new antibiotic.

AB  == computerized, frequency-pulsed, modulated electron capture gas-liquid chromatography was used to study the acid metabolites produced in vitro in fetal  calf serum and in vivo in an animal chamber model. several strains of diplostreptococcus agalactiae, propionibacterium acnes, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus serogroups a, b, and g were studied. all of these organisms have been reported to be associated with arthritic transudates in humans. metabolites were detected by this method from derivatized extracts of both spent  fetal calf serum and chamber fluids. since there was little host response to the  organisms cultured in the chambers, it is highly probable that the products detected represent metabolites produced in an in vivo type of environment. the metabolic patterns were reproducible and exhibited many similarities in vitro and in vivo. production of the acids detected was reproducible, and these acids were  useful identification markers. the data support published reports (j. b. brooks,  c. c. alley, and j. a. liddle, anal. chem. 46: 1930-1934, 1974; j. b. brooks, g.  choudhary, r. b. craven, d. edman, c. c. alley, and j. a. liddle, j. clin. microbiol. 5:625-628, 1977; j. b. brooks, r. b. craven, a. r. melton, and c. c. alley, in h. h. johnson and w. b. newson, ed., second international symposium on  rapid methods and automation on microbiology, 1976; j. b. brooks, r. b. craven, d. schlossberg, c. c. alley, and f. m. pitts, j. clin. microbiol. 8:203-208, 1978; j. b. brooks, d. s. kellogg, c. c. alley, h. b. short, and h. h. handsfield, j. infect. dis. 129:660-668, 1974) that bacterial metabolites might be detectable in diseased body fluids. the growth characteristics of the organisms in the animal model and fetal calf serum are discussed, and a moderately priced computer for performing data manipulations is evaluated.

TI  == an etiologic shift in infantile osteomyelitis: the emergence of the group b streptococcus.
AB  == twenty-one infants from six to 52 days of age (mean 23.3 days) with osteomyelitis were studied between 1965 and 1977. the etiologic agents were group b streptococcus (8), staphylococcus aureus (6), gramnegative bacilli (4), streptococcus pneumoniae (1), and unknown (2). patients with group b streptococcal osteomyelitis were characterized by an uncomplicated neonatal course, single bone involvement with a predilection for involvement of the proximal humerus, and lack of inflammatory signs. in contrast, patients with osteomyelitis due to other organisms frequently had had manipulative procedures predisposing to infection and were more likely to have multiple bone involvement, fever, and leukocytosis at the time of diagnosis. functional impairment was detected in only one of 17 patients evaluated a mean of 36 months after diagnosis.

TI  == complete versus selective dry cow therapy for mastitis control.
AB  == two hundred and thirty-two cows were assigned alternately to complete dry cow therapy (infusion in all quarters on the day of drying off) or selective therapy  (infusion in all quarters if a history of mastitis, california mastitis test score of +2 or +3 in any quarter, or if cell counts from bucket milk samples as determined by the membrane filter-deoxyribonucleic acid procedure were above 500,000 cells/ml). a dry cow product containing 10(6) units of procaine penicillin g and 1 g of dihydrostreptomycin in a slow release base was used. a 1% iodophor teat dip was used throughout the experiment. infections of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, other streptococci, and gram negative rods were eliminated from 85.4% of the infected quarters with complete therapy and 88.2% of the infected quarters with selective therapy. new infections occurred in 3.1% of quarters with complete therapy and in 6.5% of the quarters with selective therapy. incidence of mastitis following the dry period was less with complete therapy compared to selective therapy (4.6% vs. 7.8% of the quarters). selective therapy was as effective as complete therapy in eliminating  existing infections. complete therapy would be the choice in situations where new infections in dry period are of concern.

TI  == treatment of bacterial endocarditis with vancomycin.
AB  == five patients with bacterial endocarditis who were allergic to penicillin were treated successfully with vancomycin. the causative microorganisms were streptococcus bovis, s faecalis, s agalactiae, s intermedius, and staphylococcus  aureus. except for the strain of s faecalis, vancomycin was bactericidal against  these organisms at easily achievable serum concentrations. to insure a bactericidal serum titer of 1:8 or greater, streptomycin was added in the therapy of the case caused by s faecalis. there was no toxicity from vancomycin therapy in our patients except for mild phlebitis at the infusion site. vancomycin appears to be an effective alternative to penicillin in individuals with endocarditis due to susceptible organisms. vancomycin in combination with an aminoglycoside may be appropriate therapy for enterococcal endocarditis.

TI  == influence of phenylbutazone on leukocyte chemiluminescence and function.
AB  == the effect of phenylbutazone on human leukocyte chemiluminescence, phagocytosis and intracellular killing of bacteria has been examined. a marked reduction of chemiluminescence and intracellular killing of bacteria was observed. the effect  on phagocytosis was less pronounced. high drug concentrations nearly abolished light emission, and concentrations equivalent to those obtained in plasma during  therapy caused a 25--30% reduction. the effect occurred within less than 10 minutes. no permanent effect upon resting cells was observed. phenylbutazone reduced the effect of sodium azide on leukocyte chemiluminescnece, indicating that the drug might also inhibit myeloperoxidase dependent chemiluminescnece. whether these impairments of leukocyte function also take place in vivo resulting in enhanced susceptibility to infection remains unknown.

TI  == synergistic lysis of erythrocytes by propionibacterium acnes.
AB  == sheep and human erythrocytes, partially processed by staphylococcus aureus or clostridium perfringens, were susceptible to lysis in the presence of propionibacterium acnes. p. acnes liberated a lipase that was detected on tween 80 agar and also on phospholipase c-precipitated egg yolk agar. such a lipase might have contributed in the process of an intensified cellular lysis. similar reactions were attempted with lactobacillus acidophilus, known to possess a nondiffusible lipase, and failed to produce any such reactions. the synergistic reactions, between p. acnes and c. perfringens, were compared with the classical  camp reaction in an attempt to find a correlation with the established membrane composition of the erythrocytes involved. synergistic reactions observed do seem  to reflect the membrane composition. such findings, besides being contributory to an understanding of the role of these organisms in the process of pathogenesis, are of importance in the elucidation of molecular organization of biomembranes. detailed studies, involving a large number of representative anaerobic bacteria,  may also help provide an avenue in anaerobic species identification.

TI  == method for rapid detection of group b streptococci by coagglutination.
AB  == a quick and reliable technique for the identification of group b streptococci has been developed. the method requires no elaborate equipment or expensive reagents  and can be used to detect the group b organisms in mixed broth cultures or to identify suspect colonies selected from agar plates. the method is a coagglutination technique in which 1 drop of specifically sensitized protein a-containing staphylococcus aureus is mixed with 1 drop of supernatant of an actively growing culture. the soluble group-specific carbohydrate substance of the group b streptococci reacts with the staph particles to produce agglutination that is macroscopically readable. one colony of group b streptococci taken from an agar plate and inoculated into todd-hewitt broth will give a positive reaction within 6 h of incubation; with a larger inoculum, the positive reaction occurs within a shorter period. the method was applied for detection of group b streptococci in mixed broth cultures. in laboratory studies involving random mixtures of organisms, 59.3% of positive cultures were detected within the first  8 h of incubation, and 71.7% were found within 24 h. in clinical studies with mixed broth cultures grown directly from vaginal swabs, 78.6% of the positive cultures were detected within the first 8 h of incubation, and 92.9% were found within 24 h.

TI  == apparatus for pasteurising teat cup liners between cows in a herringbone parlour.
AB  == in a herringbone milking parlour, teat cup liners were deliberately contaminated  in turn with staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, streptococcus agalactiae and sterp uberis. contamination was achieved by filling the liners with milk that contained 10(6) test organisms per ml. after the clusters had been back-flushed with water at 85 degrees c for five seconds, normal swabbing methods failed to recover any contaminating organisms from the teat liners in 56 tests out of 64. after 10 seconds back-flushing no recoveries were made in the same number of tests. the apparatus developed to effect this back-flushing for a particular herringbone parlour is described, with details of its routine use during milking. for a 100-cow herd, the running cost of such equipment using a five-second back-flush is estimated at no more than 4 pounds per week and, in its present form, would not add more than 10 seconds to the total milking time for each cow.  improvements in design of the apparatus, and in milking techniques arising from the routine use of the device, are also considered.

TI  == [selective effect of propolis in the isolation of listeria monocytogenes (author's transl)].
AB  == propolis is a substance produced by honeybees. it is inhibitory to some bacteria  species, mainly gram-positive bacteria, but less inhibitory to listeria monocytogenes (l.m) than to the other gram-positive bacteria tested. in order to  obtain selective growth of l.m. from contaminated samples, the effect of propolis in plating media and broths on various strains of bacteria was examined. table i  shows the effect of increasing concentrations of propolis in tryptose-agar (ta).  l.m. tolerated higher concentrations of propolis than streptococcus viridans and  staphylococcus aureus. l.m. grew well in tryptosebroth (tb) that contained 0.15 mg propolis pr. ml medium, while streptococcus viridans and streptococcus agalactiae were completely inhibited as seen in table ii. table iii shows that when serum was added to the agar, the inhibitory effect was reduced. it can also  be seen that gram-negative bacteria grew quite well on media that contained 0.19  mg propolis pr. ml. to reduce the growth of gram-negative bacteria, nalidixic acid was added to the medium. table iv illustrates growth of various species of bacteria in tryptosephosphatebroth (tfb) with or without propolis and nalidixic acid. most of the strains tested were inhibited, but pseudomonas aeruginosa and to some extent faecal streptococci were able to grow in the medium that contained the selective substances. as a conclusion it seems that propolis may be a valuable additive to a medium for the selective isolation of l.m.

AB  == comparative studies were carried out on some methods and nutrient media used for  the isolation and identification of mastitis causative agents. milk from normal andmastitis-affected udder quarters was aseptically sampled and treated under various conditions. individual samples were simultaneously seeded in different media. the following conclusions were drawn: 1. milk samples for the diagnosis of mastitis of a subclinical character can be taken at the beginning and at the end  of milking. 2. direct seedings of milk have equal diagnostic value as those of the sediment. with the former the process of bacteriologic treatment of the samples is shortened in time, and the isolation and differentiation of the mastitis agents is rendered feasible. 3. at the present etiologic structure of the subclinical types of mastitis in this country most suitable has proved the blood agar medium in which almost all mastitis causative agents can be demonstrated. 4. kartashova's medium and the tkt-medium possess a pronounced selectivity with special reference to streptococci and have higher diagnostic value for farms where streptococcus mastitis is prevailing.

AB  == the effect was tested of the disinfection preparations hibitan and iozan sst under field conditions in the course of six months. the animals treated were included in two groups: group i--with 20 cows, and group ii--with 39 cows. all animals were free of mastitis-causing agents. the udder of the animals in the first was disinfected with hibitan-super-concentrate (7.5 per cent chlorhexidin gluconate). prior to milking the udder was washed with a 0.12 per cent solution.  after milking the teats were disinfected with a hibitan cream. the udder of the animals of the second group was disinfected with iozan sst (17.6 per cent tensit-iodo-iodide complex). prior to milking the udder was washed a 0.5 per cent solution, and the teats after milking were disinfected with a 33 per cent iozan sst solution. it was found that the washing of the udder and teats as indicated above in the course of 6 months rules out the outbreak of the infectious subclinical mastitits in cows. it is suggested to adopt the use of the two preparations to prevent mastitis in field and farm practice.

TI  == some factors affecting selective adherence of microorganisms in the bovine mammary gland.
AB  == some parameters affecting the adherence of microbes to the ductular epithelium of the bovine mammary gland were studied. adherence increased from teat sinus to lactiferous sinus to the large ducts, and cells from the lactiferous sinus to the large ducts, and cells from the lactiferous sinus were used for all other experiments. there was no difference in adherence to cells from different quarters of the same cow, but there were significant differences between cows. scanning electron microscopy suggested that the cells of the ductular epithelium  undergo dynamic changes that probably result in secretion and/or desquamation. adherence to cells could be demonstrated only at a late stage of these changes. the adherence of organisms associated with mastitis was studied using an in vitro test. adherence generally paralleled prevalence as cause of disease, with staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus agalactiae adhering best. strain variation suggested that virulence was related to adherence with s. agalactiae and s. dysgalactiae but not with s. aureus. it is proposed that specific adherence is an important aspect of pathogenesis of mastitis due to s. aureus and s. agalactiae.

TI  == nonlactating-cow therapy with a formulation of penicillin and novobiocin: therapeutic and prophylactic effects.
AB  == an experimental product incorporating 500,000 iu of procaine penicillin g and 600 mg of sodium novobiocin in 2% aluminum monostearate-peanut oil gel (10-ml dose) was used to treat all quarters of 56 cows which were infected in at least 1 quarter at time of final mild-out at end of lactation. treatment was withheld from 89 cows uninfected in all quarters. quarter infection was determined by bacteriologic culturing of milk samples collected at the last regular milking, at intervals up to final milk-out (7 or 12 days later), at calving, and 1 week later. clearance rates against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococci other than streptococcus agalactiae, and coliform bacteria in treated quarters were 83, 94, 88, and 71%, respectively. subtraction of the spontaneous clearance rate of about 50% in untreated quarters resulted in values  of 35 to 45% for drug efficacy against existing staphylococcal and streptococcal  infections. prophylactic efficacy was examined. in cows entering the true nonlactating period with 1 or more quarters infected, new infection rates across  the period aming quarters uninfected at the beginning were 36.0% among untreated  cows and 6.3% among treated cows (p less than 0.005). the comparable rates for cows entering the nonlactating period uninfected in all quarters were 5.7 and 0%. staphylococcus aureus and streptococci, which comprised 38.5% of new period infections among untreated cows, were completely lacking among treated cows (p less than 0.025). within the treated group of cows, 83.1% of infected quarters were cleared, and new infection rate in the non-lactating period was 50% less than the rate among untreated cows. because the frequency of intramammary infection in this herd was quite low at "drying-off" (10.5% of quarters), the net effect on herd health of selective therapy of cows infected at end of lactation was a reduction in total quarter infection from 19.8 to 13.6%.

TI  == conversion of chronic staphylococcal mastitis to acute gangrenous mastitis after  neutropenia in blood and bone marrow produced by an equine anti-bovine leukocyte  serum.
AB  == a stock strain of staphylococcus aureus of mastitis origin, characterized by alpha-, beta-, and delta-toxins, was used to produce chronic mastitis of 20 to 300 days' duration in 6 lactating mammary quarters of 4 cows. early acute streptococcus agalactiae mastitis was produced in 1 additional mammary quarter of 1 cow. equine anti-bovine leukocyte serum (eabls) was administered to all cows by continuous intravascular drip for 12 to 32 hours. neutropenia in blood and partial depletion of neutrophil reserve in bone marrow were produced. chronic subclinical staphylococcal mastitis in 2 quarters of 1 cow changed to gangrenous  mastitis by the 40th hour after eabls administration and led to death of the cow. the disappearance of neutrophil leukocytes from the milk was followed by uninhibited multiplication of s aureus. probably, staphylococcal leukocidins accelerated the destruction of neutrophils in the milk as s aureus multiplication became intensified. in another quarter of the same cow that was infected with str agalactiae, neutrophil leukocytes were present in milk as long as 3 days after their disappearance from blood and bone marrow. this may give some indication of  the extravascular life-span of the neutrophil in the udder in mastitis. the 2nd cow died at the 16th hour from the start of eabls administration and at a time when gangrenous mastitis was in the initial stages of development. the s aureus-infected quarters of the 2 remaining cows did not become gangrenous. administration of eabls to these 2 cows did not significantly reduce the numbers  of neutrophil leukocytes entering the milk of the 3 s aureus-infected quarters. it is concluded that continuous diapedesis of neutrophil leukocytes into the milk in chronic staphylococcal mastitis protects the gland against the development of  gangrenous mastitis in the presence of a strain of s aureus capable of alpha-toxin production.

TI  == [resistance to antibiotics of bacteria involved in respiratory infections (author's transl)].
AB  == the present status of resistance to antibiotics of bacteria involved in respiratory infections is reviewed. schematically it can outlined as follows. streptococcus b-haemolyticus as well as pneumococcus did not change their sensitivity to penicillin, but some strains are now resistant to tetracycline. streptococcus viridans, enterococcus and h. influenzae did not change substantially their sensitivity to antibiotics. staphylococcus aureus is the bacterial species that always poses some problems with regard to antibiotic resistance. due to the selection of strains penicillinase-producing because of the large use of penicillin, the most part of clinical isolates of staphylococci  is now resistant to penicillin. in addition an increased number of strains resistant to the other antibiotics has been registered as soon as they has been introduced in therapy. the resistant strains spread in a particularly rapid way in hospital. the introduction in therapy of penicillinase-resistant penicillins constituted a remarkable advance in therapy of staphylococcal infection. however, there is now a growing number of indications about the emergence of methicillin resistant strains of staphylococci. on the other hand it must be recalled that since 1960 a marked reduction of incidence and mortality in severe staphylococcal infections has been noted. incidence and mortality of respiratory infections due  to gram-negative bacilli is augmented particularly in connection with a larger use of immunosuppressive and antineoplastic therapies, of particular surgical or  reanimation procedures, of intensive courses of antibiotic therapy etc. emergence of pseudomonas, proteus, serratia, providencia, etc. infections poses many difficult problems of chemotherapy since these species are scarcely sensitive to  antibiotics. carbenicillin, cephalosporins, sisomicin, tobramycin, amikacin are the more recent drugs that alone or in combination may offer some chances of success in this field.

AB  == fifty-nine teat dips were tested for effectiveness in reducing populations of experimentally applied streptococcus agalactiae and staphylococcus aureus on teat skin. the results varied widely among products. populations of s. agalactiae recovered from dipped teats ranged from a 98.3% reduction to a 147.4% increase as compared to undipped controls. reductions in recoverable s. aureus ranged from 98.5 to 43.6%. the products yielding the highest germicidal activity did not conform to a consistent pattern in type and concentration of active ingredients,  presence or lack of specific emollients, or ph. approximately 20% of the products yielded a low activity. each of six oil-based products performed poorly and frequently increased numbers of organisms.

TI  == hygiene in the prevention of udder infections. ii. evaluation of oil-based teat dips.
AB  == oil-based teat dips containing iodine at .5 and 1% were compared in a series of studies with two water-based iodophor products of the same concentration and also with undipped controls. when the two types of products were tested at .5% under conditions of natural infection, the water-based dip was four times more effective than the oil-based dip at preventing staphylococcus aureus infections.  in three subsequent trials teats were experimentally exposed to s. aureus and streptococcus agalactiae. five times more s. aureus infections developed in a group dipped with the oil-based dip at 1% iodine with an undipped control yielded no significant difference for s. aureus infections. the 1% iodine water-based product was nine times more effective in preventing s. aureus infections than the 1% oil-based product. differences in the incidence of s. agalactiae infections were nonsignificant within the individual trials. though ineffective in preventing udder infections oil-based products were effective in creating a supple condition of teat skin.

TI  == [effect of antibiotics on hemolysin production by bacteria causing mastitis in cattle].
AB  == effect of six antibiotics on the hemolysin formation by 320 strains of staphylococcus (including 112 s. aureus) and 100 strains of s. agalactiae isolated from cow udders, have been determined. tests were performed on plates containing 5% horse red cells, but the hemolytic strains were tested on blood agar plates supplemented with 5% sheep, rabbit and calf cells in addition. one strain of s. aureus produced the rings of hemolysis around the zones of growth inhibition on the media containing the discs of penicillin, erythromycin, oxyterramycin and chloramphenicol. another strain of s. agalactiae produced similar rings, but only on the medium supplemented with penicillin. on the calf blood agar plate, s. aureus produced the hemolytic rings only in association with streptomycin and neomycin. after five times of propagation on the nutrient agar,  the hemolytic phenomenon was not reproducible. it may be suggested that in cow milk there are some inhibitors for hemolysin formation by staphylococcus and s. agalactiae.

TI  == determination of untreated whole-milk effects on in vitro antibacterial activity.
AB  == the effect of fresh whole milk without pasteurization or other pretreatment on in vitro antibacterial activity of selected compounds was determined in broth dilution. the milk was collected by hand directly from dairy goats, or by syringe or cannula from bovine quarters showing low bacterial counts. antibacterial activity was determined in 50% (v/v) milk-broth medium against sensitive mastitis-etiologic strains of streptococcus agalactiae and staphylococcus aureus. the indicator salt 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride was incorporated in the milk broth medium to determine inoculum growth. contaminant interference was circumvented through early as well as late readings and comparisons with uninoculated control tubes, with and without the test compounds. application of the method with more than 75 compounds, including nitrofurans, antibiotics, and other chemicals uncovered marked degrees of milk interference. the method warrants routine use among preliminary screens to relate in vitro with in vivo observations of antimicrobial activity. similar procedures may be used with serum, skim milk, or mastitis-milk media for separating effects due to protein, lipid, or other elements in product evaluation.

TI  == cores, microbial organelles possibly specific to group d streptococci.
AB  == a long, thin, approximately cylindrical core spans the interior of cells of 24-hr cultures of all group d streptococci that were examined, five strains of streptococcus faecalis, single strains of s. faecalis subsp. zymogenes and s. durans, and three strains of streptococcus spp. in one strain of s. faecalis, serial section electron microscopy showed that most cells possess a core. the core is 0.10 to 0.16 mum thick and consists of a matrix and an axial array of ribosomelike particles. it resembles one of two types of cores present in a stable protoplast form of one of the s. faecalis strains. cores were not present  in single strains of s. pyogenes (beta-hemolytic group a), s. agalactiae (group b), s. dysgalactiae (group c), s. equisimilis (group c), and s. mitis (viridans group) that were examined; nor were cores observed in single strains of staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, and bacillus megaterium. cores may be useful, therefore, in identification of group d streptococci. for preservation and rapid recognition of cores, a glutaraldehyde-osmium tetroxide sequence of fixation appears superior to the osmium tetroxide method often employed in processing bacteria for electron microscopy.
