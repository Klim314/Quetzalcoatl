TI  == arabinoxylans and inulin differentially modulate the mucosal and luminal gut microbiota and mucin-degradation in humanized rats.
AB  == the endogenous gut microbiota affects the host in many ways. prebiotics should favour beneficial intestinal microbes and thus improve host health. in this study, we investigated how a novel class of potential prebiotic long-chain arabinoxylans (lc-ax) and the well-established prebiotic inulin (in) modulate the gut microbiota of humanized rats. six weeks after axenic rats were inoculated with a human faecal microbiota, their colonic microbiota was similar to this inoculum ( approximately 70%), whereas their caecal microbiota was enriched with  verrucomicrobia and firmicutes concomitant with lower abundance of bacteroidetes. moreover, different bifidobacterium species colonized the lumen (b. adolescentis) and mucus (b. longum and b. bifidum). both lc-ax and in increased scfa levels and induced a shift from acetate towards health-promoting propionate and butyrate respectively. by applying a high-resolution phylogenetic micro-array (hitchip) at the site of fermentation (caecum), in and lc-ax were shown to stimulate bacterial groups with known butyrate-producers (roseburia intestinalis, eubacterium rectale, anaerostipes caccae) and bifidobacteria (b. longum) respectively. prebiotic administration also resulted in lower caecal abundances of the mucin-degrading akkermansia muciniphila and potentially more mucin production by  the host. both factors might explain the increased caecal mucin levels for lc-ax  (threefold) and in (sixfold). these mucins were degraded along the colon, resulting in high faecal abundances of akkermansia muciniphila for lc-ax and especially in-treated rats. finally, the microbial changes caused an adaptation period for the host with less weight gain, after which the host fine-tuned the interaction with this altered microbiota. our results demonstrate that next to in, lc-ax are promising prebiotic compounds by stimulating production of health-promoting metabolites by specific microbes in the proximal regions. further, prebiotic supplementation shifted mucin degradation to distal regions, where mucin-degraders may produce beneficial metabolites (e.g. propionate by akkermansia muciniphila), so that prebiotics may potentially improve gut health along the entire length of the intestine.

TI  == in vitro kinetics of prebiotic inulin-type fructan fermentation by butyrate-producing colon bacteria: implementation of online gas chromatography for quantitative analysis of carbon dioxide and hydrogen gas production.
AB  == kinetic analyses of bacterial growth, carbohydrate consumption, and metabolite production of five butyrate-producing clostridial cluster xiva colon bacteria grown on acetate plus fructose, oligofructose, inulin, or lactate were performed. a gas chromatography method was set up to assess h2 and co2 production online and to ensure complete coverage of all metabolites produced. method accuracy was confirmed through the calculation of electron and carbon recoveries. fermentations with anaerostipes caccae dsm 14662(t), roseburia faecis dsm 16840(t), roseburia hominis dsm 16839(t), and roseburia intestinalis dsm 14610(t) revealed similar patterns of metabolite production with butyrate, co2, and h2 as  the main metabolites. r. faecis dsm 16840(t) and r. intestinalis dsm 14610(t) were able to degrade oligofructose, displaying a nonpreferential breakdown mechanism. lactate consumption was only observed with a. caccae dsm 14662(t). roseburia inulinivorans dsm 16841(t) was the only strain included in the present  study that was able to grow on fructose, oligofructose, and inulin. the metabolites produced were lactate, butyrate, and co2, without h2 production, indicating an energy metabolism distinct from that of other roseburia species. oligofructose degradation was nonpreferential. in a coculture of r. inulinivorans dsm 16841(t) with the highly competitive strain bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum lmg 11047 on inulin, hardly any production of butyrate and co2 was detected, indicating a lack of competitiveness of the butyrate producer. complete recovery of metabolites during fermentations of clostridial cluster xiva butyrate-producing colon bacteria allowed stoichiometric balancing of the metabolic pathway for butyrate production, including h2 formation.

TI  == cross-feeding between bifidobacterium longum bb536 and acetate-converting, butyrate-producing colon bacteria during growth on oligofructose.
AB  == in vitro coculture fermentations of bifidobacterium longum bb536 and two acetate-converting, butyrate-producing colon bacteria, anaerostipes caccae dsm 14662 and roseburia intestinalis dsm 14610, with oligofructose as the sole energy source, were performed to study interspecies interactions. two clearly distinct types of cross-feeding were identified. a. caccae dsm 14662 was not able to degrade oligofructose but could grow on the fructose released by b. longum bb536  during oligofructose breakdown. r. intestinalis dsm 14610 could degrade oligofructose, but only after acetate was added to the medium. detailed kinetic analyses of oligofructose breakdown by the last strain revealed simultaneous degradation of the different chain length fractions, in contrast with the preferential degradation of shorter fractions by b. longum bb536. in a coculture  of both strains, initial oligofructose degradation and acetate production by b. longum bb536 took place, which in turn also allowed oligofructose breakdown by r. intestinalis dsm 14610. these and similar cross-feeding mechanisms could play a role in the colon ecosystem and contribute to the combined bifidogenic/butyrogenic effect observed after addition of inulin-type fructans to the diet.

TI  == lactate-utilizing bacteria, isolated from human feces, that produce butyrate as a major fermentation product.
AB  == the microbial community of the human colon contains many bacteria that produce lactic acid, but lactate is normally detected only at low concentrations (<5 mm)  in feces from healthy individuals. it is not clear, however, which bacteria are mainly responsible for lactate utilization in the human colon. here, bacteria able to utilize lactate and produce butyrate were identified among isolates obtained from 10(-8) dilutions of fecal samples from five different subjects. out of nine such strains identified, four were found to be related to eubacterium hallii and two to anaerostipes caccae, while the remaining three represent a new  species within clostridial cluster xiva based on their 16s rrna sequences. significant ability to utilize lactate was not detected in the butyrate-producing species roseburia intestinalis, eubacterium rectale, or faecalibacterium prausnitzii. whereas e. hallii and a. caccae strains used both d- and l-lactate,  the remaining strains used only the d form. addition of glucose to batch cultures prevented lactate utilization until the glucose became exhausted. however, when two e. hallii strains and one a. caccae strain were grown in separate cocultures  with a starch-utilizing bifidobacterium adolescentis isolate, with starch as the  carbohydrate energy source, the l-lactate produced by b. adolescentis became undetectable and butyrate was formed. such cross-feeding may help to explain the  reported butyrogenic effect of certain dietary substrates, including resistant starch. the abundance of e. hallii in particular in the colonic ecosystem suggests that these bacteria play important roles in preventing lactate accumulation.
