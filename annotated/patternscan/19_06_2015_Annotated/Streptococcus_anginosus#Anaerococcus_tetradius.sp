TI  == intracranial bacterial infections of oral origin.
AB  == brain abscesses are rare but potentially deadly complications of odontogenic infections. this phenomenon has been described mainly in the form of case reports, as large-scale studies are difficult to perform. we compiled a total of  60 previously published cases of such a complication to investigate the predisposing factors, microbiology, and clinical outcomes of intracranial abscesses of odontogenic origin. a systematic review of the literature using the  pubmed database was performed. men accounted for 82.1% of cases, and the mean age was 42.1 years. caries with periapical involvement and periodontitis were the two most common intra-oral sources, and wisdom tooth extraction was the most common preceding dental procedure. in 56.4% of cases, there were obvious signs of dental disease prior to development of intracranial infection. commonly implicated microorganisms included streptococcus viridans (especially the anginosus group),  actinomyces, peptostreptococcus, prevotella, fusobacterium, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and eikenella corrodens. there was an 8.3% mortality rate.  intracranial abscesses can form anywhere within the brain, and appear unrelated to the side of dental involvement. this suggests that hematogenous spread is the  most likely route of dissemination.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of preparation bioaron c.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of sirupus bioaron c, a preparation, whose main ingredient is an extract from the leaves of aloe arborescens, was tested against  different microorganisms isolated from patients with upper respiratory tract infections. the experiments were performed on 40 strains: 20 strains of anaerobic bacteria, 13 strains of aerobic bacteria and 7 strains of yeast-like fungi from the genus candida and on 18 reference strains (atcc). the antimicrobial activity  of bioaron c (mbc and mfc) was determined at undiluted concentration. bioaron c proved to be very effective against the microorganisms causing infections. at the concentration recommended by the producer, the preparation showed biocidal activity (mbc, mfc) against the strains of the pathogenic microorganisms, which cause respiratory infections most frequently, including, among others, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, parvimonas micra, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus anginosus, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and candida albicans, already after 15 min. the mic of bioaron c against most of the tested microorganisms was 5 to 100 times lower than the usually applied concentration. the great antimicrobial activity means that the preparation may be used in the prevention and treatment of infections of the upper respiratory tract. bioaron c  may be an alternative or complement to classical therapy, especially in children.

TI  == descending necrotizing mediastinitis: a modified algorithmic approach to define a new standard of care.
AB  == background: descending necrotizing mediastinitis (dnm) is a highly morbid infectious process. this uncommon disease process has carried historically a substantial burden of morbidity and mortality. in this study we hypothesized that application of a prospective modified management algorithm would decrease the morbidity and mortality from this highly destructive process. methods: we developed a systematic approach for managing dnm, focusing on serial debridement  guided by imaging, in conjunction with the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics and  modern principles of critical care. we reviewed all patients admitted with this disease process from 2007-2012. data collected included demographic information,  co-morbidities, laboratory data including culture results, operative details, imaging frequency and findings, complications, and survival. continuous variables were reported as median values and ranges. results: from 2007-2010, we treated eight patients with dnm. the median age of the patients was 33 y (range 28-63 y), and 63% were male. in accordance with our algorithm, the patients underwent serial imaging at regular intervals following operative debridement. the median number of imaging studies was 11 (range 4-19). the patients required a median of  five operative debridements (range 1-15). in five patients, drainage was necessary through a cervical exploration. a thoracic approach was required in six patients (two thoracoscopic, four via thoracotomy). additional procedures included thymectomy (n=2), anterior mediastinotomy, carotid sheath exploration and resections of the clavicle, first rib, manubrium, pectoralis major muscle, and sternocleidomastoid muscle. the most common etiologic agents were peptostreptococcus spp. and streptococcus anginosus. study patients received a median of six different antibiotics (range 2-10) for a total of 42 d (range 34-55 d). these patients were hospitalized for a median of 29 days (range 16-56 d), with 15 d (range 7-48 d) spent in the intensive care unit. remarkably, the rate of survival was 100% (median follow-up of 33 mo). the patients developed no major complications, required no re-admissions, and had no re-infections. conclusions:  we applied an algorithmic approach to the treatment of dnm, consisting of aggressive operative debridement and enhanced by equally aggressive imaging. our  patients had excellent outcomes despite the widely known lethality of dnm. an aggressive approach may decrease complications and improve survival in this devastating disease process. furthermore, our prospective experience with dnm suggests that this algorithm used in the present study should be the standard for managing patients with this challenging condition.

TI  == microarray analysis of microbiota of gingival lesions in noma patients.
AB  == noma (cancrum oris) is a gangrenous disease of unknown etiology affecting the maxillo-facial region of young children in extremely limited resource countries.  in an attempt to better understand the microbiological events occurring during this disease, we used phylogenetic and low-density microarrays targeting the 16s  rrna gene to characterize the gingival flora of acute noma and acute necrotizing  gingivitis (ang) lesions, and compared them to healthy control subjects of the same geographical and social background. our observations raise doubts about fusobacterium necrophorum, a previously suspected causative agent of noma, as this species was not associated with noma lesions. various oral pathogens were more abundant in noma lesions, notably atopobium spp., prevotella intermedia, peptostreptococcus spp., streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus anginosus. on the other hand, pathogens associated with periodontal diseases such as aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, capnocytophaga spp., porphyromonas spp. and fusobacteriales were more abundant in healthy controls. importantly, the overall loss of bacterial diversity observed in noma samples as well as its homology to that of ang microbiota supports the hypothesis that ang might be the  immediate step preceding noma.

TI  == the predominant bacteria isolated from radicular cysts.
AB  == purpose: to detect predominant bacteria associated with radicular cysts and discuss in light of the literature. material and methods: clinical materials were obtained from 35 radicular cysts by aspiration. cultures were made from clinical  materials by modern laboratory techniques, they underwent microbiologic analysis. results: the following are microorganisms isolated from cultures: streptococcus milleri group (smg) (23.8%) [streptococcus constellatus (19.1%) and streptococcus anginosus (4.7%)], streptococcus sanguis (14.3%), streptococcus mitis (4.7%), streptococcus cremoris (4.7%), peptostreptococcus pevotii (4.7%), prevotella buccae (4.7%), prevotella intermedia (4.7%), actinomyces meyeri (4.7%), actinomyces viscosus (4.7%), propionibacterium propionicum (4.7%), bacteroides capillosus (4.7%), staphylococcus hominis (4.7%), rothia denticariosa (4.7%), gemella haemolysans (4.7%), and fusobacterium nucleatum (4.7%). conclusions: results of this study demonstrated that radicular cysts show a great variety of anaerobic and facultative anaerobic bacterial flora. it was observed that all isolated microorganisms were the types commonly found in oral flora. although no  specific microorganism was found, streptococcus spp. bacteria (47.5%) - especially smg (23.8%) - were predominantly found in the microorganisms isolated. furthermore, radicular cysts might be polymicrobial originated. although radicular cyst is an inflammatory cyst, some radicular cyst fluids might be sterile.

TI  == subgingival microflora in inflammatory bowel disease patients with untreated periodontitis.
AB  == objective: to analyze the subgingival microflora composition of inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) patients with untreated chronic periodontitis and compare them with systemically healthy controls also having untreated chronic periodontitis. method: thirty ibd patients [15 with crohn's disease (cd) and 15 with ulcerative colitis (uc)] and 15 control individuals participated in the study. all patients had been diagnosed with untreated chronic periodontitis. from every patient, subgingival plaque was collected from four gingivitis and four periodontitis sites with paper points. samples from the same category (gingivitis or periodontitis) in each patient were pooled together and stored at -70 degrees  c until analysis using a checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique for 74 bacterial species. results: multiple-comparison analysis showed that the groups differed in bacterial counts for bacteroides ureolyticus, campylobacter gracilis, parvimonas micra, prevotella melaninogenica, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus mutans, and treponema denticola (p<0.001). cd  patients had significantly higher levels of these bacteria than uc patients either in gingivitis or in periodontitis sites (p<0.05). cd patients harbored higher levels of p. melaninogenica, s. aureus, s. anginosus, and s. mutans compared with controls both at gingivitis and at periodontitis sites (p<0.05). uc patients harbored higher levels of s. aureus (p=0.01) and p. anaerobius (p=0.05)  than controls only in gingivitis sites. conclusion: our study showed that even with similar clinical periodontal parameters, ibd patients harbor higher levels of bacteria that are related to opportunistic infections in inflamed subgingival  sites that might be harmful for the crucial microbe-host interaction.

TI  == does pregnancy have an impact on the subgingival microbiota?
AB  == background: we investigated clinical and subgingival microbiologic changes during pregnancy in 20 consecutive pregnant women > or =18 years not receiving dental care. methods: bacterial samples from weeks 12, 28, and 36 of pregnancy and at 4  to 6 weeks postpartum were processed for 37 species by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. clinical periodontal data were collected at week 12 and at 4 to 6  weeks postpartum, and bleeding on probing (bop) was recorded at sites sampled at  the four time points. results: the mean bop at week 12 and postpartum was 40.1% +/- 18.2% and 27.4% +/- 12.5%, respectively. the corresponding mean bop at microbiologic test sites was 15% (week 12) and 21% (postpartum; not statistically significant). total bacterial counts decreased between week 12 and postpartum (p  <0.01). increased bacterial counts over time were found for neisseria mucosa (p <0.001). lower counts (p <0.001) were found for capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, eubacterium saburreum, fusobacterium nucleatum naviforme, fusobacterium nucleatum polymorphum, leptotrichia buccalis, parvimonas micra (previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros), prevotella intermedia, prevotella melaninogenica, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguinis, selenomonas noxia, and veillonella parvula. no changes occurred between weeks 12 and 28 of pregnancy. counts of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), and  treponema denticola did not change. counts of p. gingivalis and t. forsythia at week 12 were associated with gingivitis (p <0.001). conclusions: subgingival levels of bacteria associated with periodontitis did not change. p. gingivalis and t. forsythia counts were associated with bop at week 12. a decrease was found in 17 of 37 species from week 12 to postpartum. only counts of n. mucosa increased.

TI  == bacterial examination of endodontic infections by clonal analysis in concert with denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography.
AB  == background/aims: the aim of this study was to examine the diversity of bacterial  species in the infected root canals of teeth associated with endodontic abscesses by cloning and sequencing techniques in concert with denaturing high-performance  liquid chromatography. methods: samples collected from five infected root canals  were subjected to polymerase chain reaction (pcr) with universal 16s ribosomal dna primers. products of these pcrs were cloned and sequenced. denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (dhplc) was used as a screening method to  reduce the number of clones necessary for dna sequencing. results: all samples were positive for the presence of bacteria and a range of 7-13 different bacteria were found per root canal sample. in total, 48 different oral clones were detected among the five root canal samples. olsenella profusa was the only species present in all samples. porphyromonas gingivalis, dialister pneumosintes, dialister invisus, lachnospiraceae oral clone, staphylococcus aureus, pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, peptostreptococcus micros and enterococcus faecalis were found in two of the five samples. the majority of the taxa were present in only one sample, for example tannerella forsythia, shuttleworthia satelles and filifactor alocis. some facultative anaerobes that are frequently isolated from endodontic infections such as e. faecalis, streptococcus anginosus  and lactobacillus spp. were also found in this study. conclusion: clonal analysis of the microflora associated with endodontic infections revealed a wide diversity of oral species.

TI  == evaluation of the microbiota of primary endodontic infections using checkerboard  dna-dna hybridization.
AB  == background/aims: the aim of this study was to evaluate the composition of the microbiota of primary endodontic infections in 111 selected cases of single-rooted teeth with necrotic pulp. methods: samples were collected from the  root canals using #15 hedstroen-type files and two sterile paper points, which were introduced 1 mm short of the apical foramen. the presence, levels, and proportions of 40 different bacterial species in each sample were determined using dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization techniques. results: the  mean number of species per sample was 22. enterococcus faecalis (89.3%), campylobacter gracilis (89.3%), leptotrichia buccalis (89.3%), neisseria mucosa (87.5%), prevotella melaninogenica (86.6%), fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. vincentii (85.7%), eubacterium saburreum (75.9%), streptococcus anginosus (75%),  and veillonella parvula (74.1%) were the most prevalent species. the species found in highest mean counts (over 10(5)) were f. nucleatum ssp. vincentii (13.14 x 10(5)), e. saburreum (5.67 x 10(5)), e. faecalis (5.38 x 10(5)), n. mucosa (4.19 x 10(5)), v. parvula (3.63 x 10(5)), c. gracilis (3.46 x 10(5)), treponema  socranskii (3.34 x 10(5)), porphyromonas endodontalis (2.96 x 10(5)), porphyromonas gingivalis (2.85 x 10(5)), micromonas micros (2.81 x 10(5)), prevotella nigrescens (2.68 x 10(5)) and fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. nucleatum (2.64 x 10(5)). most of these species were also found in high proportions. conclusions: our results suggest that several bacterial species considered to be  oral pathogens seem to be implicated in the etiology of primary endodontic infections.

TI  == coaggregation interactions between oral and endodontic enterococcus faecalis and  bacterial species isolated from persistent apical periodontitis.
AB  == interactions between enterococcus faecalis and other species found in root canal  infections might be important for the development and persistence of periapical disease. the aim of this study was to investigate the coaggregation interactions  between e. faecalis clinical isolates and species previously shown to survive and induce apical periodontitis in monkeys: peptostreptococcus anaerobius, prevotella oralis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and streptococcus anginosus. intergeneric coaggregation assays were conducted in duplicate with observations scored immediately at 0 h, 1 h and 24 h after mixing of combinations of strains. all e.  faecalis strains (n = 53) coaggregated with f. nucleatum; e. faecalis did not coaggregate with p. anaerobius or s. anginosus. one strain, e. faecalis e1, coaggregated with p. oralis, with aggregates visible at 1 h. coaggregation interactions between e. faecalis and f. nucleatum observed in this study suggest  a potential role for this combination in endodontic infections.

TI  == influence of residual bacteria on periapical tissue healing after chemomechanical treatment and root filling of experimentally infected monkey teeth.
AB  == the purpose of this study was twofold: first, to determine the influence on the healing of the periapical tissues when selected bacterial strains and combinations thereof remain after root canal treatment; and, second, the relationship to healing of the quality of the root filling. in eight monkeys, 175 root canals, previously infected with combinations of four or five bacterial strains and with radiographically verified apical periodontitis, were endodontically treated, bacteriologically controlled, and permanently obturated.  after 2-2.5 yr, the periapical regions were radiographically and histologically examined. of these teeth, 48 root canals were also examined for bacteria remaining after removal of the root fillings. when bacteria remained after the endodontic treatment, 79% of the root canals showed non-healed periapical lesions, compared with 28% where no bacteria were found. combinations of residual bacterial species were more frequently related to non-healed lesions than were single strains. when no bacteria remained, healing occurred independently of the  quality of the root filling. in contrast, when bacteria remained, there was a greater correlation with non-healing in poor-quality root fillings than in technically well-performed fillings. in root canals where bacteria were found after removal of the root filling, 97% had not healed, compared with 18% for those root canals with no bacteria detected. the present study demonstrates the importance of obtaining a bacteria-free root canal system before permanent root filling in order to achieve optimal healing conditions for the periapical tissues.

TI  == clinical and microbiological changes associated with the use of combined antimicrobial therapies to treat "refractory" periodontitis.
AB  == background: the present investigation examined clinical and microbial changes after a combined aggressive antimicrobial therapy in subjects identified as "refractory" to conventional periodontal therapy. method: fourteen subjects were  identified as "refractory" based on full-mouth mean attachment loss and/or >3 sites with attachment loss > or =3 mm following scaling and root planing (srp), periodontal surgery and systemic antibiotics. after baseline monitoring, subjects received srp, locally delivered tetracycline at pockets > or =4 mm, systemically  administered amoxicillin (500 mg, t.i.d. for 14 days)+metronidazole (250 mg, t.i.d. for 14 days) and professional removal of supragingival plaque weekly for 3 months. subjects were monitored clinically every 3 months post-therapy for 2 years. subgingival plaque samples were taken at the same time points from the mesial aspect of each tooth and the levels of 40 subgingival taxa were determined using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. mean levels of each species were averaged within a subject at each visit. significance of changes in clinical and  microbiological parameters over time were evaluated using the friedman or wilcoxon signed ranks test. results: on average, subjects showed significant improvements in all clinical parameters after therapy. mean (+/-sem) full-mouth pocket depth reduction was 0.83+/-0.13 mm and mean attachment level "gain" was 0.44+/-0.12 at 24 months. clinical improvement was accompanied by major reductions in multiple subgingival species during the first 3 months of active therapy that were maintained for most species to the last monitoring visit. reductions occurred for three actinomyces species, "orange complex" species including campylobacter showae, eubacterium nodatum, three fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies, peptostreptococcus micros, prevotella intermedia as well as the "streptococcus milleri" group, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus constellatus and streptococcus intermedus. subjects differed in their response to therapy; six modest response subjects exhibited less attachment level gain and were characterized by reductions in the microbiota from baseline to 3 months, but re-growth of many species thereafter. conclusions: the combined antibacterial therapy was successful in controlling disease progression in 14 "refractory" periodontitis subjects for 2 years.

TI  == clinical presentation and bacteriologic analysis of infected human bites in patients presenting to emergency departments.
AB  == previous studies of infected human bites have been limited by small numbers of patients and suboptimal microbiologic methodology. we conducted a multicenter prospective study of 50 patients with infected human bites. seventy percent of the patients and assailants were young adult men. fifty-six percent of injuries were clenched-fist injuries and 44% were occlusional bites. most injuries were to the hands. fifty-four percent of patients were hospitalized. the median number of isolates per wound culture was 4 (3 aerobes and 1 anaerobe); aerobes and anaerobes were isolated from 54% of wounds, aerobes alone were isolated from 44%, and anaerobes alone were isolated from 2%. isolates included streptococcus anginosus (52%), staphylococcus aureus (30%), eikenella corrodens (30%), fusobacterium nucleatum (32%), and prevotella melaninogenica (22%). candida species were found in 8%. fusobacterium, peptostreptococcus, and candida species  were isolated more frequently from occlusional bites than from clenched-fist injuries. many strains of prevotella and s. aureus were beta-lactamase producers. amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and moxifloxacin demonstrated excellent in vitro activity against common isolates.

TI  == [four cases of non-clostridial gas gangrene with diabetes mellitus].
AB  == we report four cases of non-clostridial gas gangrene. all cases were associated with diabetes mellitus as the underlying disease. case 1: a 60-year-old male developed an ulcerative lesion on the dorsum of his left foot. peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, citrobacter freundii and staphyrococcus epidermidis were identified in culture from odoriferous pus. case 2: a 81-year-old female developed a lesion on her vulva spreading to the right lower abdomen. bacteroides bivius, peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus and streptococcus faecalis were identified in culture of the odoriferous pus. case 3: a 80-year-old male developed a swollen area with ulcer on the right foot. bacteroides fragiris, enterococcus faecalis, proteus mirabilis, enterococcus avium and enterococcus faecalis were identified by culture. case 4: a 52-year-old female developed swelling of her left groin. enterococcus faecalis and streptococcus anginosus were identified in culture from the odoriferous pus. in all patients, a radiological examination revealed the presence of subcutaneous gas in the lesion. prognosis of non-clostridial gas gangrene is usually poor. these four patients, however, all survived. once an infectious sign is seen in the diabetic patient, it is important to discover a gas figure by using the radiological examination (plain film or computed tomography). earlier diagnosis and debridement are the most important for a better prognosis. because workers with diabetes mellitus are now increasing in number, occupational physicians should always keep in mind that a serious infectious disease like non-clostridial gas gangrene can develop even from minor accidental trauma, and they should control the working environment in  the workplace where accidents often happen.

TI  == bacteriology of histopathologically defined appendicitis in children.
AB  == background: acute appendicitis is the most common surgical emergency in childhood. however, the pathogenesis and detailed microbiology are obscure. objective: to determine in detail the bacterial etiology of appendicitis in children in relation to the histologic tissue pathology. study design: tissue samples obtained at surgery from 41 children with suspected acute appendicitis were examined histologically and by culture for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. the patients were analyzed according to histopathologic and clinical findings. results: aerobic and anaerobic species were isolated from 40 of 41 (98%) samples; on average, 14.1 isolates per specimen (10.4 anaerobes and 3.7 aerobes). specimens from patients with gangrenous appendices yielded significantly higher numbers of anaerobic isolates per specimen than did specimens from patients with  healthy appendices (11.7 vs. 7.7; p < 0.01). bacteria belonging to the bacteroides fragilis group were the most frequently isolated anaerobic microorganisms (95%). other organisms frequently isolated in all histology groups were peptostreptococcus micros (66%), bilophila wadsworthia (63%), fusobacterium  nucleatum (44%), eggerthella lenta (44%) and a hitherto undescribed bile-resistant, pigment-producing gram-negative rod (41%). of the aerobes escherichia coli (88%) and streptococcus anginosus group (former streptococcus "milleri" group) organisms (61%) were the most frequent findings. conclusions: the shift from histologically normal toward gangrenous appendices was clearly associated with markedly elevated anaerobic bacterial counts in terms of species. the unusually high frequencies of b. wadsworthia (75%) and the hitherto undescribed bile-resistant, pigment-producing gram-negative rod (56%) in gangrenous appendices represent unique and different findings from those reported in adults.

TI  == proteolysis and utilization of albumin by enrichment cultures of subgingival microbiota.
AB  == subgingival dental plaque consists mainly of microorganisms that derive their energy from amino acid fermentation. their nutrient requirements are met by the subgingival proteolytic system, which includes proteases from microorganism and inflammatory cells, and substrate proteins from sulcus exudate, including albumin. to determine the selective effect of individual proteins on microbiota,  we used albumin as the main substrate for growth. eight subgingval plaque samples from untreated periodontal pockets of patients with adult periodontitis were inoculated in peptone yeast medium with bovine albumin (9 g/l). after three subculture steps, cell yields of the enrichment cultures at the medium with 0, 1.25, 2.5, 5, 10, and 20 g/l albumin were determined. proteolytic activity (u/absorbance at 550 nm) of the enrichment cultures and different isolates derived from the cultures was estimated by the degradation of resorufin-labeled casein. it was observed that the yield of the mixed culture was albumin limited,  and the proteolytic activities of the cultures in albumin broth were higher than  in control (peptone broth). among the isolates from the enrichment cultures, peptostreptococcus micros, prevotella melaninogenica, prevotella buccae and prevotella bivia demonstrated proteolysis. the frequent occurrence of streptococcus gordonii and streptococcus anginosus in the albumin cultures is explained by their ability to utilize arginine as an energy source for growth. albumin in the medium was partly degraded by pure cultures but completely consumed in enrichment cultures, indicating synergy of bacterial proteinases. it  is concluded that the subgingival microbiota possesses proteolytic activity and may use albumin as a substrate for their growth. enrichment cultures on albumin may serve as a relatively simple in vitro model to evaluate the effects of proteinase inhibitors.
