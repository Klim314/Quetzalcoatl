TI  == bacteriocin activity against various pathogens produced by pediococcus pentosaceus vj13 isolated from idly batter.
AB  == bacteriocins, an antimicrobial peptide, is known to have wide spectrum antimicrobial activity against various pathogens. because they are easily digested in the intestine, they are considered as safe and are widely used as food preservatives. hence their purification and characterization have attracted  considerable attraction, especially for those having activity against human pathogens. in this study, the bacteriocin produced by pediococcus pentosaceus vj13 was precipitated with cold acetone and purified by gel permeation chromatography and hydrophobic interaction chromatography. the bacteriocin exhibited antimicrobial activity against various pathogens, like mycobacterium smegmatis, klebsiella pneumonia, clostridium perfringens and staphylococcus epidermidis. the activity of bacteriocin was lost completely after treatment with protease, which revealed its proteinaceous nature. the bacteriocin was stable up  to 100 degrees c and exhibited antilisterial property which is a characteristic feature of class iia bacteriocins. it was active within the ph range of 2-8 and stable against various chemicals and denaturants. tricine sds-page revealed its molecular weight to be 4.0 kda, where the corresponding activity against listeria monocytogenes was also noted. treatment of l. monocytogenes with bacteriocin decreased the viable cell count, and scanning electron microscope analysis revealed membrane pore formation that resulted in the release of intracellular content, suggesting its bactericidal effect.

TI  == pediocin a improves growth performance of broilers challenged with clostridium perfringens.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of the anticlostridial pediocin a from pediococcus pentosaceus fbb61 to contain negative effects associated to clostridium proliferation in broilers, through 2 subsequent investigations. in the first study, 36 ross 508 broilers were divided into 3 groups and fed for 21 d as follows: the control diet (ctr), the control diet supplemented with supernatant filtrate of a culture of p. pentosaceus fbb61-2 (bac-, isogenic mutant nonproducing pediocin a), and the control diet supplemented with supernatant filtrate of a culture of p. pentosaceus fbb61 (bac+) containing pediocin a. birds were challenged with 10(6) cells of clostridium perfringens. in the second study, 216 ross 508 broilers were allocated in 18 pens and divided into 3 groups fed the same diet for 42 d: a control group (ctr), a group challenged with 10(8) cells of c. perfringens (cp),  and a group challenged with 10(8) cells of c. perfringens and receiving the control diet supplemented with p. pentosaceus fbb61 and pediocin a (pa). broiler  bw, adg, adfi, and feed conversion rate were measured throughout the studies. at  the end of both experiments, an appropriate number of birds was killed and analyzed for necrotic enteritis lesions and microbiological examinations. in the  first study, on d 9, adg and bw were 20% higher for bac+ compared with ctr and bac-; on d 14, adg was higher for bac+ (+23%, p<0.05), whereas bw was higher for  bac+ and bac- compared with ctr (+23 and +14%, respectively; p<0.05). in the second study, on d 14, adg and bw were higher for pa compared with ctr and cp (+15% on average; p<0.05), whereas between 15 and 42 d, there was only a tendency toward a higher adg for pa when compared with the cp group (+4%, p=0.08). diet supplementation with pediocin a improved broiler growth performance during the challenge with c. perfringens and tended to restore the adg depletion during the  42-d period.

TI  == isolation and characterization of bacteriocin-producing bacteria from the gastrointestinal tract of broiler chickens for probiotic use.
AB  == aims: to isolate and characterize the bacteriocin-producing bacteria (bpb) from the gastrointestinal tract of broiler chickens for probiotic use. methods and results: in total, 291 bacterial strains were isolated from broilers and screened for bacteriocin-producing ability. the bacteriocins produced by enterococcus faecium sh 528, ent. faecium sh 632 and pediococcus pentosaceus sh 740 displayed  inhibitory activity against pathogens including clostridium perfringens and listeria monocytogenes. activity of the bacteriocins remained unchanged after 30  min of heat treatment at 60 degrees c or exposure to organic solvents, but diminished after treatment with proteolytic enzymes. pcr was used to detect the structural genes enterocin a and b in sh 528, enterocin l50 and p in sh 632, and  pediocin pa-1 in sh 740. most of them were resistant to 0.5% bile salts and remained viable after 2 h at ph 3.0. ent. faecium sh 528 exhibited the highest amylase activity among the strains tested. conclusions: we selected ent. faecium  sh 528 and sh 632 and ped. pentosaceus sh 740 by probiotic selection criteria including inhibition activity against pathogens. significance and impact of the study: the isolated bpb could potentially be used in the poultry industry as probiotics to control pathogens.

TI  == production of bacteriocin-like metabolites by lactic acid cultures isolated from  sucuk samples.
AB  == a total of 51 sucuk samples, obtained from different regions of turkey, were examined for lactic acid bacteria (lab) strains producing putative bacteriocin-like metabolites. for detection of antagonistic activity, agar spot and well diffusion assay tests were used. lactobacillus sake lb790, listeria monocytogenes li6, staphylococcus aureus st44 and escherichia coli nrrl b-3704 were used as indicator organisms. strains having antimicrobial activity were also tested against clostridium perfringens 4ttk, clostridium botulinum type a. 7948,  bacillus cereus nrrl b-3711, micrococcus luteus nrrl b-4376 and yersinia enterocolitica type 103. 57 of 424 isolates from sucuk samples were putative producers of bacteriocin-like metabolistes and were identified as the following:  19 lactobacillus plantarum, 4 l. curvatus, 4 pediococcus pentosaceus, 3 p. acidilactici, 2 l. pentosus, 2 l. sake, 1 l. delbrueckii, 1 l. rhamnosus and 21 unidentified lactobacillus spp. p. pentosaceus 416, p. acidilactici 413, 419 and  446, l. curvatus 348, l. plantarum 452 and 495, and lactobacillus spp. 411 strains have the best potential for use as sucuk starter cultures.

TI  == enterocin 012, a bacteriocin produced by enterococcus gallinarum isolated from the intestinal tract of ostrich.
AB  == enterococcus gallinarum strain 012, isolated from the duodenum of ostrich, produced enterocin 012 which is active against ent. faecalis, lactobacillus acidophilus, lact. sake, listeria innocua, propionibacterium acidipropionici, propionibacterium sp., clostridium perfringens, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella typhimurium. one of the four pathogenic strains of escherichia coli isolated from the intestinal tract of ostrich was inhibited by enterocin 012. no  antimicrobial activity was recorded against bacillus cereus, cl. sporogenes, cl.  tyrobutyricum, leuconostoc cremoris, pediococcus pentosaceus, staphylococcus carnosus and streptococcus thermophilus. enterocin 012 was resistant to treatment with lysozyme, catalase, lipase and papain, but sensitive to proteinase k, alpha-chymotrypsin, trypsin and pepsin. treatment of enterocin 012 with gastric juice from the duodenum resulted in a 50% loss of antibacterial activity. half of the activity was lost when incubated at 80 degrees c for 30 min, or when kept overnight at a ph of 1.0-5.0 and ph 11.0 and 12.0, respectively. enterocin 012 production started in mid-logarithmic growth and reached a maximum of 800 au ml-1, but increased further to 1600 au ml-1 in the stationary growth phase. the peptide is approximately 3.4 kda in size, as determined after partial purification with amberlite xad-1180 and ammonium sulphate precipitation, followed by tricine-sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. the mechanism of antimicrobial activity against lact. sake lmg 13558 is bactericidal and caused cell lysis of active growing cells.

TI  == the occurrence and growth of microorganisms during the fermentation of fish sausage.
AB  == minced fish (mullet) sausage mixes containing added sugar, salt, nitrate, nitrite and spices were fermented (48 h, 30 degrees c) by indigenous flora or by a starter culture (pediococcus acidilactici) and the microbial ecology and behaviour of various bacteria was monitored. pediococcus pentosaceus and lactobacillus plantarum dominated the indigenous fermentation, achieving populations of 10(7)-10(8) cfu/g by 48 h, and decreasing the ph of the mix to 4.5-4.7. significant growth (10(5)-10(7) cfu/g) of staphylococcus warneri, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis. micrococcus varians and micrococcus luteus also occurred during this fermentation. less growth was exhibited by bacillus megaterium and yeasts. pediococcus acidilactici dominated the fermentation when it was inoculated as a starter culture, but indigenous lactic acid bacteria (p. pentosaceus and l. plantarum) also grew to 10(7)-10(8) cfu/g. the growth of other bacteria and yeasts was restricted during fermentation with starter culture. inoculated escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, salmonella sofia, and staphylococcus aureus grew to 10(6)-10(7) cfu/g in the sausage mix during indigenous fermentation. lesser growth occurred for bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens and vibrio parahaemolyticus. growth of these bacteria was significantly inhibited in sausage mix fermented with p. acidilactici.
