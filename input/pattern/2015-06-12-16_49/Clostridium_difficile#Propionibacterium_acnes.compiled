TI  - Development of antimicrobial resistance in the normal anaerobic microbiota during one year after administration of clindamycin or ciprofloxacin.
AB  - Thirty healthy subjects (15 males and 15 females) were randomly assigned in three groups and clindamycin (150 mg qid) or ciprofloxacin (500 mg bid) or placebo was given for a 10-day period. Skin, nasal, saliva, faeces samples were collected at day - 1, day 11, 1 month, 2 months, 4 months and 12 months post administration for microbiological analysis. Ciprofloxacin or clindamycin had no impact on the anaerobic skin microbiota and the proportions of antibiotic resistant anaerobic bacteria were similar as in the placebo group. Ciprofloxacin had impact on the Propionibacterium acnes in the nasal microbiota that normalized after 1 month, however, ciprofloxacin-resistant P. acnes strains increased at month 2 and month 12. Clindamycin had no impact on the nasal microbiota. In the oropharyngeal microbiota, a higher proportion of ciprofloxacin resistant Veillonella was found, it lasting up to 12 months post dosing. In the clindamycin group, clindamycin-resistant Prevotella spp. were found in increased proportions compared to placebo at various time points except month 4 in the saliva samples. The relative proportion of ciprofloxacin-resistant Bifidobacteria increased in the faecal samples on day 11, 1 month, 4 months and 12 months post dosing compared to placebo. The proportion of clindamycin-resistant Bacteroides spp. increased at 1, 2, 4 and 12 months post dosing compared to placebo in the faecal samples. No Clostridium difficile was recovered from any of the samples from any of the volunteers at any visit. The concentrations of ciprofloxacin or clindamycin in the faeces were higher than the MICs for most of the organisms present in the normal microbiota. No obvious correlation between the groups in resistant patterns for anaerobic bacteria was observed. In conclusion, based on the microbiological data of the microbiota as well as the results of the bioassays for ciprofloxacin and clindamycin concentrations in the faecal samples, oral administration of ciprofloxacin and clindamycin has an impact on the anaerobic microbiota and may have a long-term effect on the development and persistence of antibiotic-resistant anaerobes in the normal microbiota.
TI  - Advancement in the routine identification of anaerobic bacteria by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry.
AB  - We evaluated matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) Biotyper as a tool for the identification of anaerobic bacteria compared with 500 base-pair (bp) 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) gene sequencing analysis, which is considered to be the "gold standard" method. A total of 484 anaerobic bacteria were retrieved from the clinical specimens of 318 pediatric patients. Molecular identification resulted in 18 genera and 51 species. The most prevalent genus was Clostridium (76.85 %), with 70 % C. difficile isolates. The concordance and sensitivity determined by MALDI-TOF MS for C. difficile, the most prevalent species isolated, was 94.08 %, whereas the specificity was 100 %. For the other anaerobes, the sensitivity and specificity were 94.07 % and 81.82 %, respectively, with a concordance of 93.15 %. Low performance was observed for Propionibacterium acnes and Fusobacterium nucleatum, for which a dedicated pretreatment procedure should likely be set up. MALDI-TOF MS was shown to be a valid alternative for the fast and reliable identification of the most clinically relevant anaerobic bacteria; moreover, it is less time-consuming, the cost for reagents is minimized, and it does not require dedicated personnel.
TI  - Antibacterial properties of a glycolipid-rich extract and active principle from Nunavik collections of the macroalgae Fucus evanescens C. Agardh (Fucaceae).
AB  - This study investigated the antibacterial activity of glycolipid-rich extracts of the brown macroalga Fucus evanescens in cell culture. Accessions were collected on the Arctic coast of Ungava Bay, Nunavik, Quebec. The crude ethyl acetate extract of these accessions showed strong antibacterial activity (>/=4 log(10) cfu) against Hemophilus influenzae , Legionella pneumophila , Propionibacterium acnes (ATCC and clinical isolate), and Streptococcus pyogenes at 100 microg/mL. This algal extract inhibited by 3 log(10) Clostridium difficile and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus , whereas Bacillus cereus , Escherichia coli , Klebsiella pneumoniae , and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were not significantly affected. Further investigations of the activity of a glycolipid-rich fraction, extracted with dichloromethane, against Propionibacterium acnes showed an MIC(100) of 50 microg/mL, with an inhibition of more than 99% at only 7.8 microg/mL. The main active compound, a beta-d-galactosyl O-linked glycolipid, was synthesized for the bioassay and showed an MIC(100) of 50 microg/mL but lost its activity more quickly with only 50% of inhibition at 12.5 microg/mL. Therefore, the semipurified F. evanescens extract could be a good choice for future research into the development of alternative treatments for acne therapy.
TI  - In vitro activity against anaerobes of retapamulin, a new topical antibiotic for  treatment of skin infections.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Retapamulin is the first agent of the pleuromutilin class formulated  as a topical antibacterial for treating skin infections. The aim of this study was to determine the antimicrobial activity of retapamulin by determining the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of this new drug and comparators against a wide range of anaerobic bacteria of human origin. METHODS: The in vitro activity of retapamulin and six comparators (amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, ceftriaxone, imipenem, clindamycin and metronidazole) was evaluated against 232 anaerobic clinical isolates. MICs were determined by the CLSI reference agar dilution method (M11-A6). RESULTS: Ceftriaxone, clindamycin and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid resistance rates were 54%, 42% and 9.6%, respectively, within the Bacteroides fragilis group. Despite high resistance rates to various antibiotics, retapamulin inhibited 37/52 (71%) strains of the B. fragilis group and 85/87 (98%) of the other Gram-negative bacilli at a concentration of 2 mg/L or less. All the investigated strains of Clostridium perfringens were inhibited by 1 mg/L retapamulin. Three strains of C. difficile and one strain of C. clostridioforme demonstrated decreased susceptibility to retapamulin. Based on inhibitory concentrations, retapamulin was more active than clindamycin, metronidazole and ceftriaxone against Propionibacterium acnes and anaerobic Gram-positive cocci, as all isolates were inhibited by <or=2 mg/L. CONCLUSIONS: At <or=2 mg/L, retapamulin inhibited 90% of all 232 anaerobes tested, whereas overall resistance rates for the comparators were as follows: co-amoxiclav, 2%; metronidazole, 12%; clindamycin, 15% and ceftriaxone, 20%. The broad anaerobic spectrum demonstrated by retapamulin in vitro is attractive. Pending further clinical investigation, retapamulin may offer an alternative treatment for anaerobic skin infections in this era of increasing resistance.
TI  - In vitro activities of daptomycin, vancomycin, and penicillin against Clostridium difficile, C. perfringens, Finegoldia magna, and Propionibacterium acnes.
AB  - Daptomycin has in vitro activity against gram-positive anaerobic bacteria, although limited numbers of species have been tested. We studied the in vitro activities of daptomycin, vancomycin, and penicillin against more than 100 strains each of Clostridium difficile, C. perfringens, Finegoldia magna, and Propionibacterium acnes. Daptomycin Etest MICs and results from time-kill studies were determined for selected strains. For 392 of 421 strains (93%), daptomycin was inhibitory at < or =1 microg/ml, including 15 of 16 strains of C. difficile with elevated linezolid MICs of 8 and 16 microg/ml, all 32 strains with moxifloxacin MICs of > or =4 microg/ml, and all 16 strains resistant to clindamycin. Daptomycin MICs were also < or =1 microg/ml for all 16 F. magna strains resistant to clindamycin and all 32 strains resistant to tetracycline. Only one strain, a C. perfringens strain, had a MIC of >2 microg/ml to daptomycin. Eighty-five and 92.5% of the Etest MICs were within 1 dilution of the agar dilution method for all drugs at 24 and 48 h, respectively. In time-kill studies, a C. difficile strain was inhibited by both daptomycin and vancomycin at 1, 2, 4, 8, and 24 h; colony counts were decreased by 2.3 to 2.9 log at 24 h. Vancomycin was not bactericidal for C. perfringens; however, daptomycin showed bactericidal activity as early as 1 h at four and eight times the MIC and at 2 and 4 h at two and four times the MIC.
TI  - [The study of the pro-nucleating activity of bacteria identified in cholesterol gallstones in model bile systems].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the relationship of bacteria identified in cholesterol gallstones and gallstone formation. METHODS: Observe the bacteria activity in model bile and the influence of bacteria on the cholesterol nucleation time (NT). RESULTS: (1) Model bile were suitable for the growth of E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, clostridium difficile and Clostridium. Propionibacterium acne grew weakly and the growth of Bacteroides fragilis was restrained in model bile. (2) Only pseudomonas aeruginosa and enTerococcus faecalis could ly shorten the cholesterol nucleation time. (3) With pseudomonas aeruginosa or enTerococcus faecalis added in model bile, the formation of cholesterol crystals presented a progressive course of evolution. CONCLUSIONS: Pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus faecalis, not propionibacterium acne, have pro-nucleating ability in model bile.

TI  - Susceptibilities of 428 gram-positive and -negative anaerobic bacteria to Bay y3118 compared with their susceptibilities to ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, metronidazole, piperacillin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and cefoxitin.
AB  - The susceptibilities of 428 gram-negative and gram-positive anaerobes (including  selected cefoxitin-resistant strains) to Bay y3118 (a new fluoroquinolone), ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, metronidazole, cefoxitin, piperacillin, and piperacillin-tazobactam were tested. Organisms comprised 115 Bacteroides fragilis group, 116 non-B. fragilis Bacteroides, Prevotella, and Porphyromonas spp., 40 fusobacteria, 58 peptostreptococci, 48 gram-positive non-spore-forming rods, and 51 clostridia. beta-Lactamase production was demonstrated in 87% of the gram-negative rods but in none of the gram-positive organisms. Overall, Bay y3118 was the most active agent, with all organisms inhibited at an MIC of < or = 2.0 micrograms/ml (MICs for 50% [MIC50] and 90% [MIC90] of strains tested, 0.125 and 0.5 microgram/ml, respectively). By contrast, ciprofloxacin was much less active, with only 42% of strains susceptible at a breakpoint of 2.0 micrograms/ml (MIC50, 4.0 micrograms/ml; MIC90, 16.0 micrograms/ml). Metronidazole was active against all gram-negative rods, but 7% of peptostreptococci, 83% of gram-positive non-spore-forming rods, and 4% of non-Clostridium perfringens, non-Clostridium difficile clostridia were resistant to this agent (MICs, > 16.0 micrograms/ml). Clindamycin was active against 94% of Bacteroides, Prevotella, and Porphyromonas spp., 91% of peptostreptococci, and 100% of gram-positive non-spore-forming rods, but was active against only 70% of fusobacteria and 53% of clostridia. Cefoxitin was active against > or = 90% of all groups except the B. fragilis group and non-Propionibacterium acnes gram-positive non-spore-forming rods (both 85%) and C. difficile (20%). Significant enhancement of piperacillin by tazobactam was seen in all beta-lactamase-positive strains (99% susceptible; MIC90, 8.0 micrograms/ml), and all beta-lactamase-negative strains were susceptible to piperacillin (MIC90, 8.0 micrograms/ml). Clinical studies are required to delineate the role of Bay y3118 in the treatment of anaerobic infections.

AB  - The in vitro activity of teicoplanin and A16686, two new glycopeptide antibiotics was determined against 196 isolates of anaerobic bacteria. The activity of teicoplanin and A16686, in comparison with that of vancomycin, clindamycin, erythromycin and fusidic acid was 2 to 16 times higher against the gram positive anaerobes, namely, Propionibacterium acnes, Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium difficile, Clostridium species, Peptococcus species and Peptostreptococcus species. However, Bacteroides fragilis was resistant to teicoplanin and A16686 while Bacteroides melaninogenicus and Bacteroides bivius were found to be sensitive.
TI  - In vitro activity of flomoxef compared to moxalactam, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, and  clindamycin against anaerobes.
AB  - To assess the in vitro activity of flomoxef (6315-S), moxalactam, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, and clindamycin against anaerobes 197 clinical isolates (27 Bacteroides fragilis, 42 B. thetaiotaomicron, 10 B. vulgatus, 7 B. ovatus, 6 B. uniformis, 6 B. distasonis, 7 Bacteroides melaninogenicus group, 11 Bacteroides oralis group, 21 Clostridium difficile, 7 C. perfringens, 3 C. sporogenes, 3 Clostridium spp., 33 Propionibacterium acnes, 14 Peptococcaceae) were studied by means of agar dilution tests. The MIC90 of B. fragilis was less than 2 micrograms/ml for flomoxef, less than 4 micrograms/ml for moxalactam, less than 16 micrograms/ml for cefoxitin, less than 128 micrograms/ml for cefotaxime and less than 2 micrograms/ml for clindamycin. The respective MIC90's of B. thetaiotaomicron were less than 64, less than 128, less than 32, less than 256 and 8 micrograms/ml. Strains of the other Bacteroides species and groups were more susceptible to flomoxef and the other antibiotics than B. thetaiotaomicron. Against Clostridium difficile flomoxef (MIC90 less than 4 micrograms/ml) proved to be superior to the other agents tested. Most of the Clostridium strains other than C. difficile were also susceptible to flomoxef; anaerobic grampositive cocci and Propionibacterium acnes were very sensitive (MIC90's less than 1 and less than or equal to 0.125 micrograms/ml, respectively). Its anti-anaerobic activity, together with its efficacy against aerobes, should make flomoxef a useful adjunct to the arsenal of modern antibiotic therapy.
TI  - BMY 28100, a new oral cephalosporin.
AB  - BMY 28100, a new oral cephalosporin with a (Z)-propenyl side chain at the 3 position and a p-hydroxyphenylglycyl substituent at the 7 position, was evaluated in comparison with cefaclor and cephalexin and, when appropriate, ampicillin and vancomycin. In vitro, BMY 28100 was more active than the reference cephalosporins against streptococci, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Listeria monocytogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, Propionibacterium acnes, Clostridium perfringens, and Clostridium difficile. BMY 28100 was comparable to cefaclor and more active than cephalexin against Staphylococcus saprophyticus and ampicillin-susceptible strains of Branhamella catarrhalis; but against ampicillin-resistant strains of B. catarrhalis, BMY 28100 was comparable to cephalexin and more active than cefaclor. Against Neisseria gonorrhoeae, BMY 28100 was comparable to cephalexin, but less active than cefaclor. Members of the family Enterobacteriaceae overall were equally susceptible to BMY 28100 and cefaclor but were less susceptible to cephalexin. In human serum, BMY 28100 was 45% protein bound. After an oral dose to mice, 82% of the drug was recovered in urine. The oral therapeutic efficacy of BMY 28100 in systemically infected mice reflected its activity in vitro.
TI  - The effect of carbon dioxide on the in vitro activity of erythromycin and RU-28965 against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activity of erythromycin and RU-28965 (a novel macrolide antimicrobial with improved pharmacokinetics) was determined against a variety of anaerobic bacteria in anaerobic atmospheres with and without added carbon dioxide. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were determined using an antimicrobial incorporation technique in Wilkins-Chalgren agar (Oxoid, UK) containing saponinlysed horse blood to a final concentration of 10%. The inoculum used was approximately 10(4) colony forming units (cfu) contained in 10 microliters Wilkins-Chalgren broth, which was applied to the surface of the agar plates using a multipoint inoculator. Following inoculation, plates were incubated for 48 h at 37 degrees C in an anaerobic atmosphere containing 10% carbon dioxide or in hydrogen alone. The MIC of each antimicrobial for each organism examined was determined as the lowest concentration of the antimicrobial which completely inhibited growth of the inoculum. The minimum concentrations required to inhibit the growth of 50% (MIC50) and 90% (MIC90) of the bacteria examined were also determined. The MICs of erythromycin and RU-28965 for isolates of the Bacteroides fragilis group, B. bivius and Fusobacterium spp. were generally 10-100 times greater when determined in the presence of carbon dioxide than when determined in hydrogen alone. The MICs of erythromycin and RU-28965 for B. melaninogenicus, Peptococcus spp., Peptostreptococcus spp., Clostridium perfringens, Cl. difficile and Propionibacterium acnes were less affected by the presence of carbon dioxide.
TI  - In vitro activity of vancomycin and teicoplanin against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activity of vancomycin and teicoplanin, a new glycopeptide antimicrobial, was determined against a total of 286 anaerobic bacteria including Bacteroides fragilis group (100), B. melaninogenicus (21), B. bivius (16), Fusobacterium spp. (15), Peptococcus spp. (20), Peptostreptococcus spp. (21), Clostridium perfringens (23), C. difficile (41) and Propionibacterium acnes (29). Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were determined using an antimicrobial incorporation technique in Wilkins-Chalgren agar approximately 10(4) colony forming units (cfu) contained in 10 microliters Wilkins-Chalgren broth, which was applied to the surface of the agar plates using a multipoint inoculator. Following inoculation, plates were incubated for 48 h at 37 degrees C in an anaerobic atmosphere. Both vancomycin and teicoplanin were highly active against all the Gram-positive anaerobic bacteria examined, 90% of all isolates being inhibited by 0.5 micrograms/ml of either antimicrobial. Isolates of B. fragilis group and Fusobacterium spp. were resistant to vancomycin (MIC90 64 micrograms/ml) and teicoplanin (MIC90 128 micrograms/ml). Unexpectedly, isolates of B. melaninogenicus and B. bivius which were resistant to vancomycin (MIC90 64 and 128 micrograms/ml respectively) were sensitive to teicoplanin (MIC90 2 and 2 micrograms/ml respectively).
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of anaerobic bacteria in Sweden in 1983.
AB  - This review is concerned with anaerobic bacteria and antimicrobial susceptibility. Data on the susceptibility to different antimicrobials of anaerobic isolates in Sweden during 1983 is presented. Among the different bacterial groups, Clostridium perfringens, propionibacteria, anaerobic cocci and curved rods were found to be susceptible to beta-lactam antibiotics, clindamycin and chloramphenicol. C. difficile was susceptible to benzylpenicillin and imipenem, but resistant to cefoxitin. Most C. difficile strains were also susceptible to clindamycin and fusidic acid, while all strains were susceptible to metronidazole and vancomycin. The majority of the fusobacteria were susceptible to beta-lactam antibiotics, clindamycin, metronidazole and chloramphenicol. However, some strains were found to be resistant to penicillins. Against the Bacteroides fragilis group, clindamycin, chloramphenicol, metronidazole and imipenem had the best activity, whereas piperacillin and cefoxitin showed good activities. Most Bacteroides non-fragilis strains were susceptible to the antimicrobials tested. However, an increasing number of isolates were found to be resistant especially to penicillins when comparing with data from the last five years.
TI  - Teichomycin: in-vitro and in-vivo evaluation in comparison with other antibiotics.
AB  - Teichomycin, a new glycopeptide antibiotic with a spectrum of activity similar to that of vancomycin, was highly active against staphylococci, streptococci and Gram-positive anaerobes (Propionibacterium acnes, Clostridium perfringens and Cl. difficile). Ninety per cent of the Staphylococcus aureus and streptococcal strains, including enterococci, were inhibited by 0.4 mg/l; 90% of Staph. epidermidis strains were susceptible to 1.6 mg/l. Vancomycin was less active than teichomycin against all clinical isolates tested. Multiply resistant strains, including methicillin-resistant Staph. aureus, were all susceptible to teichomycin and vancomycin. Teichomycin was highly bactericidal for growing cells of staphylococci and Streptococcus pyogenes and moderately bactericidal for Str. faecalis. In mice, teichomycin was well absorbed upon subcutaneous administration and had a half-life of 2.5 h. It was very effective in curing experimental mouse septicemias caused by Gram-positive bacteria (ED50 values less than 1 mg/kg).
