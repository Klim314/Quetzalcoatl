TI  == kibdelomycin is a bactericidal broad-spectrum aerobic antibacterial agent.
AB  == bacterial resistance to antibiotics continues to grow and pose serious challenges, while the discovery rate for new antibiotics declines. kibdelomycin is a recently discovered natural-product antibiotic that inhibits bacterial growth by inhibiting the bacterial dna replication enzymes dna gyrase and topoisomerase iv. it was reported to be a broad-spectrum aerobic gram-positive agent with selective inhibition of the anaerobic bacterium clostridium difficile. we have extended the profiling of kibdelomycin by using over 196 strains of gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic pathogens recovered from worldwide patient populations. we report the mic50s, mic90s, and bactericidal activities of kibdelomycin. we confirm the gram-positive spectrum and report for the first time that kibdelomycin shows strong activity (mic90, 0.125 mug/ml) against clinical strains of the gram-negative nonfermenter acinetobacter baumannii but only weak activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa. we confirm that well-characterized resistant strains of staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae show no cross-resistance to kibdelomycin and quinolones and coumarin antibiotics. we also show that kibdelomycin is not subject to efflux in pseudomonas, though it is in escherichia coli, and it is generally affected by the outer membrane permeability entry barrier in the nonfermenters p. aeruginosa and a. baumannii, which may be addressable by structure-based chemical modification.

TI  == evaluation of an online program to teach microbiology to internal medicine residents.
AB  == microbiology rounds are an integral part of infectious disease consultation service. during microbiology rounds, we highlight microbiology principles using vignettes. we created case-based, interactive, microbiology online modules similar to the vignettes presented during microbiology rounds. since internal medicine residents rotating on our infectious disease elective have limited time  to participate in rounds and learn microbiology, our objective was to evaluate the use of the microbiology online modules by internal medicine residents. we asked residents to complete 10 of 25 online modules during their infectious disease elective. we evaluated which modules they chose and the change in their knowledge level. forty-six internal medicine residents completed assessments given before and after accessing the modules with an average of 11/20 (range, 6 to 19) and 16/20 (range, 9 to 20) correct questions, respectively (average improvement, 5 questions; p = 0.0001). the modules accessed by more than 30 residents included those related to clostridium difficile, anaerobes, candida spp., streptococcus pneumoniae, influenza, mycobacterium tuberculosis, and neisseria meningitidis. we demonstrated improved microbiology knowledge after completion of the online modules. this improvement may not be solely attributed to completing the online modules, as fellows and faculty may have provided additional microbiology education during the rotation.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of azd0914, a new spiropyrimidinetrione dna gyrase/topoisomerase inhibitor with potent activity against gram-positive, fastidious gram-negative, and atypical bacteria.
AB  == azd0914 is a new spiropyrimidinetrione bacterial dna gyrase/topoisomerase inhibitor with potent in vitro antibacterial activity against key gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus agalactiae), fastidious gram-negative (haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae), atypical (legionella pneumophila), and anaerobic (clostridium difficile) bacterial species, including  isolates with known resistance to fluoroquinolones. azd0914 works via inhibition  of dna biosynthesis and accumulation of double-strand cleavages; this mechanism of inhibition differs from those of other marketed antibacterial compounds. azd0914 stabilizes and arrests the cleaved covalent complex of gyrase with double-strand broken dna under permissive conditions and thus blocks religation of the double-strand cleaved dna to form fused circular dna. whereas this mechanism is similar to that seen with fluoroquinolones, it is mechanistically distinct. azd0914 exhibited low frequencies of spontaneous resistance in s. aureus, and if mutants were obtained, the mutations mapped to gyrb. additionally, no cross-resistance was observed for azd0914 against recent bacterial clinical isolates demonstrating resistance to fluoroquinolones or other drug classes, including macrolides, beta-lactams, glycopeptides, and oxazolidinones. azd0914 was bactericidal in both minimum bactericidal concentration and in vitro time-kill studies. in in vitro checkerboard/synergy testing with 17 comparator antibacterials, only additivity/indifference was observed. the potent in vitro antibacterial activity (including activity against fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates), low frequency of resistance, lack of cross-resistance, and bactericidal activity of azd0914 support its continued development.

TI  == establishing a list of qualifying pathogens under the food and drug administration safety and innovation act. final rule.
AB  == the food and drug administration (fda or agency) is issuing a regulation to establish a list of "qualifying pathogens'' that have the potential to pose a serious threat to public health. this final rule implements a provision of the generating antibiotic incentives now (gain) title of the food and drug administration safety and innovation act (fdasia). gain is intended to encourage  development of new antibacterial and antifungal drugs for the treatment of serious or life-threatening infections, and provides incentives such as eligibility for designation as a fast-track product and an additional 5 years of  exclusivity to be added to certain exclusivity periods. based on analyses conducted both in the proposed rule and in response to comments to the proposed rule, fda has determined that the following pathogens comprise the list of ``qualifying pathogens:'' acinetobacter species, aspergillus species, burkholderia cepacia complex, campylobacter species, candida species, clostridium difficile, coccidioides species, cryptococcus species, enterobacteriaceae (e.g.,  klebsiella pneumoniae), enterococcus species, helicobacter pylori, mycobacterium  tuberculosis complex, neisseria gonorrhoeae, n. meningitidis, non-tuberculous mycobacteria species, pseudomonas species, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, and vibrio cholerae. the preamble to the  proposed rule described the factors the agency considered and the methodology used to develop the list of qualifying pathogens. as described in the preamble of this final rule, fda applied those factors and that methodology to additional pathogens suggested via comments on the proposed rule.

TI  == [steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome complicated with severe streptococcus pneumonlae peritonitis in a 10-year-old girl--case report].
AB  == primary bacterial peritonitis is a rare complication of idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (ins) in children, found in 1.5-3.7% cases. the 10-year-old girl was admitted with ins relapse: generalized edema, proteinuria 630 mg/kg/24 h, hypoalbuminemia 1.8 g/dl, hypogammaglobulinemia 74.0 mg/dl (n: 618-1537 mg/dl), gfr 71.6 ml/min/1.73 m2. she was treated with prednisone 60 mg/24 h. on 5th day severe pain, fever, crp (15.5 mg/dl) and leukocytosis (19.5 tys/mm3) rise occurred. on 6th day due to suspicion of peritonitis, laparotomy was performed and 400 ml of suppurative exudate was evacuated (streptococcus pneumoniae was cultured). postoperative course was complicated with acute kidney injury (gfr 47.7 ml/min/ 1.73 m2), lung edema, arterial hypertension, and separation of the layers of a surgical wound. the patient was treated with: imipenem (9 days), vancomycine i.v. (4 days)/p.o. (11 days) (clostridium difficile toxin present in  stool), fluconazole (14 days), 20% albumins, furosemide, labetalole, cyclosporine a (started on 56th day after the operation due to secondary steroid-resistance of ins). the remission was achieved after 7 days of cyclosporine a treatment. authors suggest that children with nephrotic syndrome belong to high-risk group of invasive pneumococcal disease, therefore they require careful implementation of mandatory immunization schedule. peritonitis is a rare and still dangerous infectious complication of nephrotic syndrome in children.

TI  == a new plant-derived antibacterial is an inhibitor of efflux pumps in staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == an in-depth evaluation was undertaken of a new antibacterial natural product (1)  recently isolated and characterised from the plant hypericum olympicum l. cf. uniflorum. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined for a panel of bacteria, including: meticillin-resistant and -susceptible strains of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus haemolyticus; vancomycin-resistant and -susceptible enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium; penicillin-resistant and -susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae; group a streptococci (streptococcus pyogenes); and clostridium difficile. mics were 2-8 mg/l for most staphylococci and all enterococci, but were >/=16 mg/l for s. haemolyticus and were >32 mg/l for all species in the presence of blood. compound 1 was also tested against gram-negative bacteria, including escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium but was inactive. the mic for mycobacterium bovis bcg was 60  mg/l, and compound 1 inhibited the atp-dependent mycobacterium tuberculosis mure  ligase [50% inhibitory concentration (ic(50)) = 75 mum]. in a radiometric accumulation assay with a strain of s. aureus overexpressing the nora multidrug efflux pump, the presence of compound 1 increased accumulation of (14)c-enoxacin  in a concentration-dependent manner, implying inhibition of efflux. only moderate cytotoxicity was observed, with ic50 values of 12.5, 10.5 and 8.9 mum against human breast, lung and fibroblast cell lines, respectively, highlighting the potential value of this chemotype as a new antibacterial agent and efflux pump inhibitor.

TI  == biological evaluation of benzothiazole ethyl urea inhibitors of bacterial type ii topoisomerases.
AB  == the type ii topoisomerases dna gyrase (gyra/gyrb) and topoisomerase iv (parc/pare) are well-validated targets for antibacterial drug discovery. because  of their structural and functional homology, these enzymes are amenable to dual targeting by a single ligand. in this study, two novel benzothiazole ethyl urea-based small molecules, designated compound a and compound b, were evaluated  for their biochemical, antibacterial, and pharmacokinetic properties. the two compounds inhibited the atpase activity of gyrb and pare with 50% inhibitory concentrations of <0.1 mug/ml. prevention of dna supercoiling by dna gyrase was also observed. both compounds potently inhibited the growth of a range of bacterial organisms, including staphylococci, streptococci, enterococci, clostridium difficile, and selected gram-negative respiratory pathogens. mic90s against clinical isolates ranged from 0.015 mug/ml for streptococcus pneumoniae to 0.25 mug/ml for staphylococcus aureus. no cross-resistance with common drug resistance phenotypes was observed. in addition, no synergistic or antagonistic interactions between compound a or compound b and other antibiotics, including the topoisomerase inhibitors novobiocin and levofloxacin, were detected in checkerboard experiments. the frequencies of spontaneous resistance for s. aureus were <2.3 x 10(-10) with compound a and <5.8 x 10(-11) with compound b at concentrations equivalent to 8x the mics. these values indicate a multitargeting  mechanism of action. the pharmacokinetic properties of both compounds were profiled in rats. following intravenous administration, compound b showed approximately 3-fold improvement over compound a in terms of both clearance and the area under the concentration-time curve. the measured oral bioavailability of compound b was 47.7%.

TI  == ceftaroline fosamil: a review of its use in the treatment of complicated skin and soft tissue infections and community-acquired pneumonia.
AB  == ceftaroline, the active metabolite of the prodrug ceftaroline fosamil (zinforo, teflaro), is an advanced-generation, parenteral cephalosporin with broad-spectrum antibacterial activity in vitro against gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and multidrug resistant streptococcus pneumoniae and gram-negative bacteria, including haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis, but not pseudomonas aeruginosa. ceftaroline has demonstrated a low potential for the selection of resistance in vitro for drug-resistant gram-positive organisms, including mrsa, as well as for gram-negative respiratory pathogens. in pivotal phase iii studies, intravenous ceftaroline fosamil demonstrated noninferiority to intravenous vancomycin plus aztreonam in patients hospitalized with complicated skin and soft tissue infections (csstis) and intravenous ceftriaxone in patients hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia (cap) [pneumonia outcomes research team (port) risk  class iii or iv]; however, patients with cap admitted to the intensive care unit  were not evaluated. ceftaroline fosamil was generally well tolerated in these trials, with an adverse event profile similar to that of other cephalosporins. diarrhoea was the most commonly reported adverse event; however, the risk of clostridium difficile-associated diarrhoea with ceftaroline fosamil appeared to be low. potential limitations of the drug include the lack of an oral formulation and the requirement for twice-daily administration. nonetheless, ceftaroline fosamil represents an attractive option (either alone or in combination with other agents) for the initial empirical treatment of patients hospitalized with csstis (including those with suspected mrsa infection) or cap (port risk class iii or iv) who require intravenous antimicrobial therapy. as with all antibacterial agents, ceftaroline fosamil should be used in accordance with good  antimicrobial stewardship.

TI  == site-directed mutations in the lanthipeptide mutacin 1140.
AB  == the oral bacterium streptococcus mutans, strain jh1140, produces the antibiotic mutacin 1140. mutacin 1140 belongs to a group of antibiotics called lanthipeptides. more specifically, mutacin 1140 is related to the epidermin type  a(i) lanthipeptides. mutagenesis experiments of this group of lanthipeptides have been primarily restricted to the posttranslationally modified meso-lanthionine and 3-methyllanthionine residues. site-directed mutagenesis of the core peptide of mutacin 1140 was performed using the suicide vector pva891. substitutions of the n-terminal residue, the charged residue in the hinge region, and residues in  ring a and intertwined rings c and d were investigated. a truncation and insertion of residues in ring a and intertwined rings c and d were also performed to determine whether or not they would alter the antimicrobial activity of the producing strain. bioassays revealed that five of 14 mutants studied had improved antimicrobial activity against the indicator strain micrococcus luteus atcc 10240. mics against streptococcus mutans ua159, streptococcus pneumoniae atcc 27336, staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923, clostridium difficile uk1, and micrococcus luteus atcc 10240 were determined for three mutacin 1140 variants that had the most significant increases in bioactivity in the m. luteus bioassay. this mutagenesis study of the epidermin group of lanthipeptides shows that antimicrobial activity can be significantly improved.

TI  == sequencing of bacterial genomes: principles and insights into pathogenesis and development of antibiotics.
AB  == the impact of bacterial diseases on public health has become enormous, and is partly due to the increasing trend of antibiotic resistance displayed by bacterial pathogens. sequencing of bacterial genomes has significantly improved our understanding about the biology of many bacterial pathogens as well as identification of novel antibiotic targets. since the advent of genome sequencing two decades ago, about 1,800 bacterial genomes have been fully sequenced and these include important aetiological agents such as streptococcus pneumoniae, mycobacterium tuberculosis, escherichia coli o157:h7, vibrio cholerae, clostridium difficile and staphylococcus aureus. very recently, there has been an explosion of bacterial genome data and is due to the development of next generation sequencing technologies, which are evolving so rapidly. indeed, the field of microbial genomics is advancing at a very fast rate and it is difficult  for researchers to be abreast with the new developments. this highlights the need for regular updates in microbial genomics through comprehensive reviews. this review paper seeks to provide an update on bacterial genome sequencing generally, and to analyze insights gained from sequencing in two areas, including bacterial  pathogenesis and the development of antibiotics.

TI  == current and future challenges in the development of antimicrobial agents.
AB  == micro-organisms exist to survive. even in the absence of antimicrobial agents, many have determinants of resistance that may be expressed phenotypically, should the need arise. with the advent of the antibiotic age, as more and more drugs were developed to treat serious infections, micro-organisms (particularly bacteria) rapidly developed resistance determinants to prevent their own demise.the most important determinants of resistance have been in the gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. among gram-positive bacteria, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) and penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae (prsp) have taxed researchers and pharmaceutical companies to develop new agents that are effective against these resistant strains. among the gram-negative bacteria, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) enzymes, carbapenemases (cres) and the so-called amp-c enzymes that may be readily transferred between species of enterobacteriaceae and other facultative species have created multi-drug resistant organisms that are difficult to treat. other resistance determinants have been seen in other clinically important bacterial species such as neisseria  gonorrhoeae, clostridium difficile, haemophilus influenzae and mycobacterium tuberculosis. these issues have now spread to fungal agents of infection.a variety of modalities have been used to stem the tide of resistance. these include the development of niche compounds that target specific resistance determinants. other approaches have been to find new targets for antimicrobial activity, use of combination agents that are effective against more than one target in the cell, or new delivery mechanism to maximize the concentration of antimicrobial agents at the site of infection without causing toxicity to the host. it is important that such new modalities have been proved effective for clinical therapy. animal models and non-mammalian systems have been developed to  determine if new agents will reach sufficient concentrations at infection sites to predict clinical efficacy without toxicity. it will also be key to consider antimicrobial stewardship as an important component of the continuing battle to prevent the development of antimicrobial resistance.

TI  == the impact of infection on population health: results of the ontario burden of infectious diseases study.
AB  == background: evidence-based priority setting is increasingly important for rationally distributing scarce health resources and for guiding future health research. we sought to quantify the contribution of a wide range of infectious diseases to the overall infectious disease burden in a high-income setting. methodology/principal findings: we used health-adjusted life years (halys), a composite measure comprising premature mortality and reduced functioning due to disease, to estimate the burden of 51 infectious diseases and associated syndromes in ontario using 2005-2007 data. deaths were estimated from vital statistics data and disease incidence was estimated from reportable disease, healthcare utilization, and cancer registry data, supplemented by local modeling  studies and national and international epidemiologic studies. the 51 infectious agents and associated syndromes accounted for 729 lost halys, 44.2 deaths, and 58,987 incident cases per 100,000 population annually. the most burdensome infectious agents were: hepatitis c virus, streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia  coli, human papillomavirus, hepatitis b virus, human immunodeficiency virus, staphylococcus aureus, influenza virus, clostridium difficile, and rhinovirus. the top five, ten, and 20 pathogens accounted for 46%, 67%, and 75% of the total  infectious disease burden, respectively. marked sex-specific differences in disease burden were observed for some pathogens. the main limitations of this study were the exclusion of certain infectious diseases due to data availability  issues, not considering the impact of co-infections and co-morbidity, and the inability to assess the burden of milder infections that do not result in healthcare utilization. conclusions/significance: infectious diseases continue to cause a substantial health burden in high-income settings such as ontario. most of this burden is attributable to a relatively small number of infectious agents, for which many effective interventions have been previously identified. therefore, these findings should be used to guide public health policy, planning, and research.

AB  == this study investigated the antibacterial activity of glycolipid-rich extracts of the brown macroalga fucus evanescens in cell culture. accessions were collected on the arctic coast of ungava bay, nunavik, quebec. the crude ethyl acetate extract of these accessions showed strong antibacterial activity (>/=4 log(10) cfu) against hemophilus influenzae , legionella pneumophila , propionibacterium acnes (atcc and clinical isolate), and streptococcus pyogenes at 100 microg/ml. this algal extract inhibited by 3 log(10) clostridium difficile and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus , whereas bacillus cereus , escherichia coli , klebsiella pneumoniae , and pseudomonas aeruginosa were not significantly affected. further investigations of the activity of a glycolipid-rich fraction, extracted with dichloromethane, against propionibacterium acnes showed an mic(100) of 50 microg/ml, with an inhibition of more than 99% at only 7.8 microg/ml. the main active compound, a beta-d-galactosyl o-linked glycolipid, was synthesized for the bioassay and showed an mic(100) of 50 microg/ml but lost its activity more quickly with only 50% of inhibition at 12.5 microg/ml. therefore, the semipurified f. evanescens extract could be a good choice for future research into the development of alternative treatments for acne therapy.

TI  == mortality and associated risk factors in consecutive patients admitted to a uk nhs trust with community acquired bacteraemia.
AB  == purpose: within the uk, there is lack of contemporary data on clinical outcomes in patients admitted to hospital with severe community acquired infection. the purpose of this study was to determine outcomes and risk factors associated with  mortality in consecutive patients admitted to a uk nhs trust with community acquired infections that cause bacteraemia. methods: from september 2007 to august 2008, demographic, clinical and microbiological data were collected on patients with laboratory confirmed bacteraemia. multivariate logistic regression  was used to determine the association between predicted variables and likelihood  of death. results: 686 bacteraemic episodes occurred in 681 patients. the most common sites of infection were non-catheter associated urinary tract infections (140, 20.4%) and biliary tract infections (62, 9.1%). the most common organisms were escherichia coli (238, 34.7%), staphylococcus aureus (84, 12.2%) and streptococcus pneumoniae (40, 5.8%). of the e coli infections, extended spectrum  beta-lactamase (esbl) producers accounted for 21/238 (8.8%), and of the s aureus  infections, methicillin resistant s aureus (mrsa) accounted for 14/84 (16.7%). 124 (18.2%, 95% ci 15.3% to 21.1%) people died within 7 days and 170 (25.0%, 95%  ci 21.7% to 28.2%) within 30 days. age (or 2.17, 95% ci 1.54 to 3.06), charlson comorbidity index (or 1.21, 95% ci 1.10 to 1.34), and pitt score (or 1.49, 95% ci 1.32 to 1.67) were highly significantly associated with 30 day mortality (p<0.001). delay in appropriate antibiotic treatment (or 1.35, 95% ci 1.05 to 1.75) and an undefined site of infection (or 2.05, 95% ci 1.19 to 3.53) were less significantly associated with 30 day mortality (p<0.05). conclusion: the 30 day mortality rate in consecutive patients with community acquired bacteraemic infection was 25.0%. these figures could be used as performance indicators to compare outcomes in different uk nhs trusts. with the exception of delay in appropriate antibiotic treatment, predictors of mortality at 30 days were non-modifiable.

TI  == tn916-like genetic elements: a diverse group of modular mobile elements conferring antibiotic resistance.
AB  == antibiotic-resistant gram-positive bacteria are responsible for morbidity and mortality in healthcare environments. enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae can all exhibit clinically relevant multidrug resistance phenotypes due to acquired resistance genes on mobile genetic elements. it is possible that clinically relevant multidrug-resistant clostridium difficile strains will appear in the future, as the organism is adept at acquiring mobile genetic elements (plasmids and transposons). conjugative transposons of the tn916/tn1545 family, which carry major antibiotic resistance determinants, are transmissible between these different bacteria by a conjugative mechanism during which the elements are excised by a staggered cut from donor cells, converted to a circular form, transferred by cell-cell contact and inserted into recipient cells by a site-specific recombinase. the ability of these conjugative transposons to acquire additional, clinically relevant antibiotic resistance genes importantly contributes to the emergence of multidrug resistance.

AB  == background: streptococcus pneumoniae is an important human pathogen representing  a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. we sequenced the genome of a  serotype 11a, st62 s. pneumoniae invasive isolate (ap200), that was erythromycin-resistant due to the presence of the erm(tr) determinant, and carried out analysis of the genome organization and comparison with other pneumococcal genomes. results: the genome sequence of s. pneumoniae ap200 is 2,130,580 base pair in length. the genome carries 2216 coding sequences (cds), 56 trna, and 12 rrna genes. of the cdss, 72.9% have a predicted biological known function. ap200 contains the pilus islet 2 and, although its phenotype corresponds to serotype 11a, it contains an 11d capsular locus. chromosomal rearrangements resulting from a large inversion across the replication axis, and  horizontal gene transfer events were observed. the chromosomal inversion is likely implicated in the rebalance of the chromosomal architecture affected by the insertions of two large exogenous elements, the erm(tr)-carrying tn1806 and a functional prophage designated phispn_200. tn1806 is 52,457 bp in size and comprises 49 orfs. comparative analysis of tn1806 revealed the presence of a similar genetic element or part of it in related species such as streptococcus pyogenes and also in the anaerobic species finegoldia magna, anaerococcus prevotii and clostridium difficile. the genome of phispn_200 is 35,989 bp in size and is organized in 47 orfs grouped into five functional modules. prophages similar to phispn_200 were found in pneumococci and in other streptococcal species, showing a high degree of exchange of functional modules. phispn_200 viral particles have morphologic characteristics typical of the siphoviridae family and are capable of infecting a pneumococcal recipient strain. conclusions: the sequence of s. pneumoniae ap200 chromosome revealed a dynamic genome, characterized by chromosomal rearrangements and horizontal gene transfers. the overall diversity of ap200 is driven mainly by the presence of the exogenous elements tn1806 and phispn_200 that show large gene exchanges with other genetic  elements of different bacterial species. these genetic elements likely provide ap200 with additional genes, such as those conferring antibiotic-resistance, promoting its adaptation to the environment.

TI  == epidemiology and clinical relevance of microbial resistance determinants versus anti-gram-positive agents.
AB  == gram-positive pathogens are a major cause of community-acquired and hospital-acquired infections, and exhibit a remarkable ability to develop antibiotic resistance. methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), glycopeptide-resistant enterococci (gre) and multidrug-resistant pneumococci are  currently the major resistance challenges among gram-positives, due to their global dissemination and overall clinical impact. the mechanisms of evolution of  these resistance phenotypes are based on a diverse array of mutational events and gene transfer phenomena carried out by several types of mobile genetic elements,  followed by the dissemination of successful resistant clones. resistance to glycopeptides in staphylococci remains uncommon, likely due to fitness issues. resistance to the new anti-gram-positive agents (linezolid, daptomycin and tigecycline) overall remains very rare. however, a transferable resistance mechanism to linezolid, mediated by ribosomal target modification by the cfr protein, has recently emerged among s. aureus, being a matter of raising concern. linezolid resistance among enterococci and coagulase-negative staphylococci is also increasingly reported. moreover, a role for antibiotic resistance has been advocated in the recent increase of clostridium difficile infection (cdi) associated with the emergence of hypervirulent strains.

TI  == infections caused by gram-positive bacteria: a review of the global challenge.
AB  == infections caused by multidrug-resistant gram-positive bacteria represent a major public health burden, not just in terms of morbidity and mortality, but also in terms of increased expenditure on patient management and implementation of infection control measures. staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus spp. are established pathogens in the hospital environment, and their frequent multidrug resistance complicates therapy. the archetypal hospital "superbug", methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), regularly attracts mass-media interest and, in many countries, there is political pressure to reduce mrsa infection rates, with some progress now being made in the united kingdom and the united states. to compound these established problems, we have witnessed the emergence and spread of virulent clones of mrsa in the community, and of clostridium difficile in hospitals. multidrug-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae clones are major community pathogens in many parts of the world, but are now being challenged by new conjugate vaccines. using combinations of molecular epidemiological tools, which characterize the resistant isolates and their resistance determinants, scientists can track highly successful bacterial strains at local, national, and international levels. these methods have provided new insights into the evolution of key pathogens, and this information may aid the design of control strategies and vaccines. in addition, the development of new antimicrobials including oxazolidinones, lipopeptides, glycylcyclines, ketolides, and new generations of fluoroquinolones, antistaphylococcal b-lactams, and glycopeptides must remain a high priority for the continued effective treatment of infections caused by resistant strains. so far, resistance to these newer agents is identified rarely in surveillance programs, but occasional reports of resistance causing therapeutic failure (e.g., with linezolid, daptomycin, telithromycin, or newer fluoroquinolones) give cause for concern. the emergence of antibiotic resistance is inevitable, but we must seek to decrease its impact and prolong the effectiveness of the agents available to us.

TI  == swine flu and antibiotics.
AB  == health services worldwide are likely to be hard-pressed by swine flu-related illness in the months ahead. secondary infections with streptococcus pneumoniae,  other streptococci (e.g. streptococcus pyogenes), haemophilus influenzae and staphylococcus aureus are likely to be important causes of morbidity and mortality. the uk department of health recently published clinical pathways for the management of swine flu. suggested severity criteria have not been validated  in respiratory infection and are different from those previously published. antibiotics are recommended for all patients assessed at hospital, regardless of  severity of illness; cephalosporins or quinolones are suggested for inpatients with pneumonia. these recommendations will jeopardize recent decreases in clostridium difficile-associated diarrhoea (cdad) and methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) in uk hospitals. this article, written on behalf of the bsac council, considers these recommendations and provides alternative antibiotic regimens for a range of clinical scenarios.

TI  == human alpha-defensins inhibit hemolysis mediated by cholesterol-dependent cytolysins.
AB  == many pathogenic gram-positive bacteria release exotoxins that belong to the family of cholesterol-dependent cytolysins. here, we report that human alpha-defensins hnp-1 to hnp-3 acted in a concentration-dependent manner to protect human red blood cells from the lytic effects of three of these exotoxins: anthrolysin o (alo), listeriolysin o, and pneumolysin. hd-5 was very effective against listeriolysin o but less effective against the other toxins. human alpha-defensins hnp-4 and hd-6 and human beta-defensin-1, -2, and -3 lacked protective ability. hnp-1 required intact disulfide bonds to prevent toxin-mediated hemolysis. a fully linearized analog, in which all six cysteines were replaced by aminobutyric acid (abu) residues, showed greatly reduced binding and protection. a partially unfolded hnp-1 analog, in which only cysteines 9 and  29 were replaced by abu residues, showed intact alo binding but was 10-fold less  potent in preventing hemolysis. surface plasmon resonance assays revealed that hnp-1 to hnp-3 bound all three toxins at multiple sites and also that solution-phase hnp molecules could bind immobilized hnp molecules. defensin concentrations that inhibited hemolysis by alo and listeriolysin did not prevent  these toxins from binding either to red blood cells or to cholesterol. others have shown that hnp-1 to hnp-3 inhibit lethal toxin of bacillus anthracis, toxin  b of clostridium difficile, diphtheria toxin, and exotoxin a of pseudomonas aeruginosa; however, this is the first time these defensins have been shown to inhibit pore-forming toxins. an "abcde mechanism" that can account for the ability of hnp-1 to hnp-3 to inhibit so many different exotoxins is proposed.

TI  == assessment of the in vitro efficacy of the novel antimicrobial peptide cect7121 against human gram-positive bacteria from serious infections refractory to treatment.
AB  == background: resistant gram-positive bacteria are causing increasing concern in clinical practice. this work investigated the efficacy of ap-cect7121 (an antimicrobial peptide isolated from an environmental strain of enterococcus faecalis cect7121) against various pathogenic gram-positive bacteria. methods: strains were isolated from intensive care unit patients unresponsive to standard  antibiotic treatments. inhibitory activity of ap-cect7121 was assessed using the  agar-well diffusion method. the most resistant isolates from each species screened (enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis,staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, clostridium perfringens and clostridium difficile) were further examined in time-killing curve studies. results: these bactericidal kinetic experiments demonstrated a rapid killing effect with no viable bacteria being detected within 30 and 90 min for enterococcal and streptococcal strains and 180 min for community-acquired methicillin-resistant s. aureus and c. perfringens: viable counts for c. difficile were threefold decreased after 90 min. conclusions: ap-cect7121 may provide a novel strategy for treating potentially fatal clinical infections in hospitalized patients.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of dc-159a, a new fluoroquinolone.
AB  == dc-159a is a new 8-methoxy fluoroquinolone that possesses a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, with extended activity against gram-positive pathogens, especially streptococci and staphylococci from patients with community-acquired infections. dc-159a showed activity against streptococcus spp. (mic(90), 0.12 microg/ml) and inhibited the growth of 90% of levofloxacin-intermediate and -resistant strains at 1 microg/ml. the mic 90s of dc-159a against staphylococcus  spp. were 0.5 microg/ml or less. against quinolone- and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus strains, however, the mic 90 of dc-159a was 8 microg/ml. dc-159a was the most active against enterococcus spp. (mic 90, 4 to 8 microg/ml)  and was more active than the marketed fluoroquinolones, such as levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and moxifloxacin. the mic 90s of dc-159a against haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, and klebsiella pneumoniae were 0.015, 0.06, and 0.25 microg/ml, respectively. the activity of dc-159a against mycoplasma pneumoniae was eightfold more potent than that of levofloxacin. the mics of dc-159a against chlamydophila pneumoniae were comparable to those of moxifloxacin, and dc-159a was more potent than levofloxacin. the mic 90s of dc-159a against peptostreptococcus spp., clostridium difficile, and bacteroides fragilis were 0.5, 4, and 2 microg/ml, respectively; and among the quinolones tested it showed the highest level of activity against anaerobic organisms. dc-159a demonstrated rapid bactericidal activity against quinolone-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae strains both in vitro and in vivo. in vitro, dc-159a showed faster killing than moxifloxacin and garenoxacin. the bactericidal activity of dc-159a in a murine muscle infection model was revealed to be superior to that of moxifloxacin. these activities carried over to the in vivo efficacy in the murine pneumonia model, in which treatment with dc-159a led to bactericidal activity superior to those of the other agents tested.

TI  == [treatment of community acquired pneumonia].
AB  == the s3 guidelines for diagnosis and therapy use german epidemiological data to set the standards for a risk and degree of severity based treatment of community  acquired pneumonia (cap). over the last few years, a change in pathogen epidemiology has been recognized with the significance of staphylococci and enterobacteria increasing. cap is becoming increasingly a disease of the elderly, for whom a more broadly effective initial therapy appears to be needed. resistant pathogens play an important role in the course of the disease. for patients with  a low risk of mortality, a reduction in the length of therapy seems possible. on  the other hand, the early identification of critically ill patients who require treatment with high dose, broad spectrum antibiotics is necessary. antibiotic associated diarrhoea, caused by clostridium difficile, is a significant complication in antibiotic therapy. with the introduction of vaccination against  streptococcus pneumoniae for children, a change in the course of the illness and  an improvement in the resistance situation has been achieved. an update of the s3 guidelines is intended for 2008 in order to integrate new knowledge into the recommendations.

TI  == the complete genome sequence of clostridium difficile phage phic2 and comparisons to phicd119 and inducible prophages of cd630.
AB  == the complete genomic sequence of a previously characterized temperate phage of clostridium difficile, c2, is reported. the genome is 56 538 bp and organized into 84 putative orfs in six functional modules. the head and tail structural proteins showed similarities to that of c. difficile phage cd119 and streptococcus pneumoniae phage ej-1, respectively. homologues of structural and replication proteins were found in prophages 1 and 2 of the sequenced c. difficile cd630 genome. a putative holin appears unique to the c. difficile phages and was functional when expressed in escherichia coli. nucleotide sequence comparisons of c2 to cd119 and the cd630 prophage sequences showed relatedness between c2 and the prophages, but less so to cd119. c2 integrated into a gene encoding a putative transcriptional regulator of the gntr family. c2, cd119 and cd630 prophage 1 genomes had a cdu1-attp-integrase arrangement, suggesting that the pathogenicity locus (paloc) of c. difficile, flanked by cdu1, has phage origins. the attp sequences of c2, cd119 and cd630 prophages were dissimilar. c2-related sequences were found in 84 % of 37 clinical c. difficile isolates and  typed reference strains.

TI  == inhibition of clostridium perfringens by a novel strain of bacillus subtilis isolated from the gastrointestinal tracts of healthy chickens.
AB  == the objectives of this study were to isolate beneficial strains of microorganisms from the gastrointestinal tracts of healthy chickens and to screen them against clostridium perfringens, a causative agent of necrotic enteritis in poultry. one  of the bacteria isolated, a strain of bacillus subtilis, was found to possess an  anticlostridial factor that could inhibit the c. perfringens atcc 13124 used in this study. the anticlostridial factor produced by b. subtilis pb6 was found to be fully or partially inactivated in the presence of pronase, trypsin, and pepsin. in contrast, the antimicrobial activity of the anticlostridial factor was not affected by treatment at 100 or 121 degrees c or by treatment with any of the organic solvents used in the study. the optimum growth temperature and optimum ph for production of the anticlostridial factor were 37 degrees c and 6.20, respectively. using the mass spectroscopy-mass spectroscopy technique, the apparent molecular mass of the anticlostridial factor was estimated to be in the  range from 960 to 983 da. in terms of the antimicrobial spectrum, the anticlostridial factor was inhibitory toward various strains of c. perfringens implicated in necrotic enteritis in poultry, clostridium difficile, streptococcus pneumoniae, campylobacter jejuni, and campylobacter coli.

TI  == structural characterization of the cell wall binding domains of clostridium difficile toxins a and b; evidence that ca2+ plays a role in toxin a cell surface association.
AB  == clostridium difficile (c.difficile) is a nosocomially acquired intestinal bacillus which can cause chronic diarrhea and life-threatening colitis. the pathogenic effects of the bacillus are mediated by the release of two toxins, a and b. the c-terminal portions of both toxins are composed of 20 and 30 residue repeats known as cell wall binding (cwb) domains. we have cloned and expressed the cwb-domains of toxins a and b and several truncated cwb-domain constructs to  investigate their structure and function. the smallest cwb-domain that folded in  a cooperative manner was an 11 repeat construct of toxin a. this differentiates the c-terminal domains of toxins a and b from the cwb-domain of streptococcus pneumoniae lyta, which only requires six repeats to fold. the 11 repeat toxin a construct bound ca2+ directly with millimolar affinity and interacted with mammalian cell surfaces in a concentration and ca2+-dependent fashion. millimolar ca2+ levels also accelerated toxin mediated cho cell killing in an in vitro cell  assay. together, the data suggest a role for extracellular ca2+ in the sensitization of toxin a/cell-surface interactions.

TI  == limited value of routine microbiological diagnostics in patients hospitalized for community-acquired pneumonia.
AB  == current guidelines recommend microbiological diagnostic procedures as a part of the management of patients hospitalized for community-acquired pneumonia (cap), but the value of such efforts has been questioned. patients hospitalized for cap  were studied retrospectively, focusing on the use of aetiological diagnostic methods and their clinical impact. adult patients, without known human immunodeficiency virus infection, admitted to hospital for cap during 12 months,  were evaluated with regard to the importance of aetiological diagnosis for tailoring antibiotic therapy, antibiotic-associated diarrhoea, clostridium difficile disease, length of hospital stay and mortality. of the 605 studied patients, 482 (80%) were subjected to mycoplasma pneumoniae and/or respiratory virus serology and/or cultures of blood and/or sputum. they had a better prognosis than patients not subjected to microbiological diagnostics (mortality within 3 months was 9% vs 24%, p = 0.001), apparently reflecting differences in general health (e.g. less dementia diagnosis) but not the outcome of diagnostics. a presumptive aetiology was obtained only in 132 of the 482 patients, streptococcus pneumoniae and m. pneumoniae being the most common agents (in 49 and 36 patients, respectively). establishing an aetiological diagnosis had no impact on the number of in-hospital changes of therapy, on the proportion of new  regimens having a narrower antimicrobial spectrum than the initial one or on the  outcome. therapy was changed to a drug directed specifically against the identified pathogen in only 16 out of these 132 patients and again without any overall improvement in the outcome variables. in a setting with a low frequency of antibiotic-resistant respiratory tract pathogens current routine microbiological diagnostics were found to be of limited value for the clinical management of patients hospitalized for cap. improved diagnostics in cap are urgently needed, as establishing an aetiological diagnosis carries a potential for optimizing the antibiotic therapy.

TI  == human infections caused by glycopeptide-resistant enterococcus spp: are they a zoonosis?
AB  == following the detection of glycopeptide-resistant enterococci (gre) in 1986 and their subsequent global dissemination during the 1990s, many studies have attempted to identify the reservoirs and lines of resistance transmission as a basis for intervention. the eradication of reservoirs and the prevention of gre spread is of major importance for two reasons: (i) the emergence of high-level glycopeptide resistance in invasive enterococcal clinical isolates that are already multiresistant, has left clinicians with therapeutic options that are only at the experimental stage; and (ii) the resistance genes may spread to more  virulent bacterial species such as staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae and clostridium difficile. vana-type strains, resistant to high levels of both vancomycin and teicoplanin, are the most commonly encountered enterococci with acquired glycopeptide resistance in humans. a widespread vana-type gre reservoir was detected early in farm animals that were exposed to the glycopeptide growth-promoter avoparcin. numerous studies have provided indirect evidence for the transfer of vana-type gre and their resistance determinants from animal reservoirs to humans. the data collected have expanded our understanding of the promiscuous nature of antibiotic resistance, and have provided the groundwork for logical decision-making with the objective of deterring the dissemination of resistant bacteria and of their resistance genes.

AB  == ertapenem (mk-0826, l-749,345) is a 1-beta-methyl carbapenem with a long serum half-life. its in vitro activity was determined by broth microdilution against 3,478 bacteria from 12 centers in europe and australia, with imipenem, cefepime,  ceftriaxone, and piperacillin-tazobactam used as comparators. ertapenem was the most active agent tested against members of the family enterobacteriaceae, with mics at which 90% of isolates are inhibited (mic(90)s) of < or =1 microg/ml for all species. ertapenem also was more active than imipenem against fastidious gram-negative bacteria and moraxella spp.; on the other hand, ertapenem was slightly less active than imipenem against streptococci, methicillin-susceptible  staphylococci, and anaerobes, but its mic(90)s for these groups remained < or =0.5 microg/ml. acinetobacter spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa were also much less susceptible to ertapenem than imipenem, and most enterococcus faecalis strains were resistant. ertapenem resistance, based on a provisional nccls mic breakpoint of > or =16 microg/ml, was seen in only 3 of 1,611 strains of the family enterobacteriaceae tested, all of them enterobacter aerogenes. resistance was also seen in 2 of 135 anaerobes, comprising 1 bacteroides fragilis strain and 1 clostridium difficile strain. ertapenem breakpoints for streptococci have not been established, but an unofficial susceptibility breakpoint of < or =2 microg/ml was adopted for clinical trials to generate corresponding clinical response data for isolates for which mics were as high as 2 microg/ml. of 234 streptococcus pneumoniae strains tested, 2 required ertapenem mics of 2 microg/ml and one required an mic of 4 microg/ml, among 67 non-streptococcus pyogenes, non-streptococcus pneumoniae streptococci, single isolates required ertapenem mics of 2 and 16 microg/ml. these streptococci also had diminished susceptibilities to other beta-lactams, including imipenem as well as ertapenem.  the etest and disk diffusion gave susceptibility test results in good agreement with those of the broth microdilution method for ertapenem.

TI  == clostridium difficile recombinant toxin a repeating units as a carrier protein for conjugate vaccines: studies of pneumococcal type 14, escherichia coli k1, and shigella flexneri type 2a polysaccharides in mice.
AB  == unlike the native protein, a nontoxic peptide (repeating unit of the native toxin designated raru) from clostridium difficile toxin a (cdta) afforded an antigen that could be bound covalently to the surface polysaccharides of pneumococcus type 14, shigella flexneri type 2a, and escherichia coli k1. the yields of these  polysaccharide-protein conjugates were significantly increased by prior treatment of raru with succinic anhydride. conjugates, prepared with raru or succinylated (rarusucc), were administered to mice by a clinically relevant dosage and immunization scheme. all conjugates elicited high levels of serum immunoglobulin  g both to the polysaccharides and to cdta. conjugate-induced anti-cdta had neutralizing activity in vitro and protected mice challenged with cdta, similar to the raru alone. conjugates prepared with succinylated raru, therefore, have potential for serving both as effective carrier proteins for polysaccharides and  for preventing enteric disease caused by c. difficile.

AB  == strain differentiation of staphylococcus species, streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, clostridium difficile, and candida species was performed by restriction endonuclease analysis (rea) of genomic dna with hinfi or haeiii followed by conventional agarose gel electrophoresis. rea of 19 methicillin-resistant s. aureus isolates and 19 methicillin-susceptible s. aureus isolates revealed 8, and 14 patterns, respectively. fifty-three isolates of s. epidermidis were divided into 39 groups on the basis of rea pattern. rea patterns obtained from different strains of the same species were more similar than those  from different staphylococcus species. a total of 67 patterns were noted among 215 s. pneumoniae isolates. there was some correlation between the rea patterns and serotypes. in addition, all 61 isolates showing the pattern 6 (serotype 19) were penicillin-resistant. sixteen isolates of e. coli o157 and 18 isolates of e. coli o25 were analyzed by rea with haeiii. among 14 epidemiologically unrelated e. coli o157:h7 isolates, rea patterns were either identical or differed only by  a few fragment bands. rea patterns of 7 isolates of heat stable enterotoxin producing e. coli o25 from an outbreak were identical. eight distinct rea patterns were noted among 7 toxigenic c. difficile strains, and one to two strains were included in each group. candida strains belonging to different six candida species were analysed by rea. all c. albicans isolates (148 strains) showed one to four bright bands ranging from 4 to 8kb in size, and these strains  were divided into 37 groups according to the rea patterns. each candida strain showed species-specific rea patterns. twenty-one isolates of mycobacterium tuberculosis complex were analyzed by pcr with primer complementary to the inverted repeat of is6110(is6110-pcr). the results of pcr of 19 m. tuberculosis isolates and 2 m. bovis bcg isolates revealed 15 patterns, and 1 pattern, respectively. our results demonstrated that rea of genomic dna with hinfi or haeiii was a useful tool for strain differentiation. by comparing the species-specific rea patterns of reference strains, clinical isolates of candida  and staphylococci could be identified to the species level if they could not be identified by routine biochemical methods. because is6110-pcr is simple and rapid to perform, it seems to be a good screening method to differentiate m. tuberculosis strains.

TI  == tracking the evolution of the bacterial choline-binding domain: molecular characterization of the clostridium acetobutylicum ncib 8052 cspa gene.
AB  == the major secreted protein of clostridium acetobutylicum ncib 8052, a choline-containing strain, is cspa (clostridial secreted protein). it appears to  be a 115,000-m(r) glycoprotein that specifically recognizes the choline residues  of the cell wall. polyclonal antibodies raised against cspa detected the presence of the protein in the cell envelope and in the culture medium. the soluble cspa protein has been purified, and an oligonucleotide probe, prepared from the determined n-terminal sequence, has been used to clone the cspa gene which encodes a protein with 590 amino acids and an m(r) of 63,740. according to the predicted amino acid sequence, cspa is synthesized with an n-terminal segment of  26 amino acids characteristic of prokaryotic signal peptides. expression of the cspa gene in escherichia coli led to the production of a major anti-cspa-labeled  protein of 80,000 da which was purified by affinity chromatography on deae-cellulose. a comparison of cspa with other proteins in the embl database revealed that the c-terminal half of cspa is homologous to the choline-binding domains of the major pneumococcal autolysin (lyta amidase), the pneumococcal antigen pspa, and other cell wall-lytic enzymes of pneumococcal phages. this region, which is constructed of four repeating motifs, also displays a high similarity with the glucan-binding domains of several streptococcal glycosyltransferases and the toxins of clostridium difficile.

TI  == definition of a fundamental repeating unit in streptococcal glucosyltransferase glucan-binding regions and related sequences.
AB  == the c-termini of the glucosyltransferases (gtfs) of oral streptococci are responsible for glucan binding. these glucan-binding domains (gbds) are composed  of a series of repeated sequences that have been classified into four different classes (a-d) by virtue of sequence similarity and which, by inference, have been suggested to be of functional importance. in contrast, we propose that repeat sequences evolve in response to selection for an increase in the number of copies of a particular domain through multiple duplication events occurring at different times. according to this hypothesis, repeats should possess various degrees of similarity, especially if only key residues are of functional importance. analysis of the gbds of the gtfs indicated that a common fundamental repeat, designated the "yg" repeat, could be discerned within the "a", "b", "c", and "d"  repeats. similar elements were also conserved in the ligand-binding repeats of the clostridium difficile toxins and the lysins and the pspa protein of streptococcus pneumoniae, suggesting that similar selective pressures had also been imposed on these sequences. analysis of the "yg" repeats present in the gtfj and gtfk of streptococcus salivarius indicated that some of the "yg" repeats in the gbds of these proteins had arisen as a result of duplication events involving a series of three sequential "yg" repeats.

TI  == review of in vitro activity, pharmacokinetic characteristics, safety, and clinical efficacy of cefprozil, a new oral cephalosporin.
AB  == objective: to review the pharmacokinetics, microbiology, clinical efficacy, safety, and tolerance of cefprozil, a new, broad-spectrum oral cephalosporin. data sources: published clinical trials and microbiologic, pharmacokinetic, and safety data were identified by medline; additional references were derived from bibliographies of these articles; microbiologic data on file were provided by bristol-myers squibb. study selection: only published comparative clinical trial  reports are included in the review of clinical efficacy. noncomparative clinical  data pertaining to uses of cefprozil not approved by the food and drug administration are not included. data synthesis: data are presented on the in vitro microbiologic activity of cefprozil against 10,152 bacterial isolates, including most of the clinically important streptococci (e.g., streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae), beta-lactamase-positive and -negative staphylococcus aureus and haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, clostridium difficile, and numerous other gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. in clinical trials, cefprozil appears to be  at least as effective as commonly used comparison agents such as cefaclor, cefixime, and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. additionally, cefprozil is better tolerated than the latter two agents, especially with regard to gastrointestinal  adverse effects. conclusions: cefprozil is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin that provides coverage against both gram-negative and -positive bacteria that may cause otitis media, pharyngitis/tonsillitis, skin and skin-structure infections,  secondary bacterial infection of acute bronchitis, and acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis. the beta-lactamase stability of cefprozil appears to exceed that of other oral cephalosporins for some important pathogens. cefprozil is used primarily for second-line treatment as less-expensive, first-line generic alternatives generally are available. cefprozil demonstrates clinical advantages over many other orally administered beta-lactam antibiotics in terms of antimicrobial spectrum, a once- or twice-daily dosing regimen, and/or reduced incidence of adverse effects.

TI  == structural properties and evolutionary relationships of pspa, a surface protein of streptococcus pneumoniae, as revealed by sequence analysis.
AB  == analysis of the sequence for the gene encoding pspa (pneumococcal surface protein a) of streptococcus pneumoniae revealed the presence of four distinct domains in  the mature protein. the structure of the n-terminal half of pspa was highly consistent with that of an alpha-helical coiled-coil protein. the alpha-helical domain was followed by a proline-rich domain (with two regions in which 18 of 43  and 5 of 11 of the residues are prolines) and a repeat domain consisting of 10 highly conserved 20-amino-acid repeats. a fourth domain consisting of a hydrophobic region too short to serve as a membrane anchor and a poorly charged region followed the repeats and preceded the translation stop codon. the c-terminal region of pspa did not possess features conserved among numerous other surface proteins, suggesting that pspa is attached to the cell by a mechanism unique among known surface proteins of gram-positive bacteria. the repeat domain  of pspa was found to have significant homology with c-terminal repeat regions of  proteins from streptococcus mutans, streptococcus downei, clostridium difficile,  and s. pneumoniae. comparisons of these regions with respect to functions and homologies suggested that, through evolution, the repeat regions may have lost or gained a mechanism for attachment to the bacterial cell.

TI  == tetracyclines, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, clindamycin, and metronidazole.
AB  == the tetracyclines are effective in the treatment of chlamydia, mycoplasma pneumoniae, and rickettsial infections and also can be used for gonococcal infections in patients unable to tolerate penicillin. these drugs may cause gastrointestinal irritation, diarrhea, phototoxic dermatitis, and vestibular damage, and fatal reactions due to hepatotoxicity have occurred in pregnant women. chloramphenicol has a broad spectrum of bacteriostatic activity, but its association with suppression of the bone marrow and aplastic anemia has relegated it to a historical role. erythromycin is the drug of choice for the treatment of  infections caused by m. pneumoniae, legionella species, group a beta-hemolytic streptococci, and streptococcus pneumoniae. the frequency of serious adverse effects associated with the use of erythromycin is low; dose-related epigastric distress may occur. clindamycin is bactericidal to most nonenterococcal gram-positive aerobic bacteria and many anaerobic microorganisms. although historically it was a frequent cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea and colitis, clindamycin is considered an excellent alternative to beta-lactam antibiotics for treatment of many staphylococcal infections, and it has therapeutic utility in anaerobic infections and in several protozoan infections in immunosuppressed patients. metronidazole is efficacious for treating nonpulmonary anaerobic infections, various parasitic infections (trichomoniasis,  amebiasis, and giardiasis), nonspecific vaginitis, and clostridium difficile-mediated colitis. with use of metronidazole, mild side effects such as  epigastric discomfort, diarrhea, reversible neutropenia, and allergic-type cutaneous reactions may occur.

TI  == a family of clostridial and streptococcal ligand-binding proteins with conserved  c-terminal repeat sequences.
AB  == analysis of the derived amino acid sequences of toxins a and b from clostridium difficile has identified an extraordinarily large number of repeat amino acid units in the c-terminal regions of the proteins. nearly one third of each of the  proteins consist of repeating units which appear, at least in the case of toxin a, to be responsible for carbohydrate binding. similar repeat units are also found in the c-terminal region of four glucosyltransferases from streptococcus mutans and streptococcus downei, and in four lytic enzymes from streptococcus pneumoniae and its bacteriophages (hb-3, cp-1 and cp-9). in each case the repeats constitute the ligand-binding portion of the respective enzymes. a glucan-binding protein from s. mutans, which lacks enzymatic activity, has similar repeats spanning almost the entire molecule. this family of ligand-binding proteins appears to be of modular design, with one module consisting of a repetitive ligand-binding domain located in the c-terminal region and the other module(s) providing enzymatic functions.

TI  == pediatric gastroenteritis in primary care and in hospitalized patients.
AB  == one-hundred and fifty-seven consecutive children below seven years of age (primary care n = 48, hospitalized patients n = 109) with acute gastroenteritis of assumed infectious origin were studied. rotavirus was demonstrated by electron microscopy of faeces in 44% of all patients. the occurrence of rotavirus among patients in primary care, 15%, was significantly lower than among hospitalized patients, 57% (p less than 0.01). adenovirus was isolated in six per cent and enterovirus in two per cent of the patients with no differences between the two groups. yersinia enterocolitica and campylobacter jejuni were demonstrated in each three per cent. salmonella and shigella spp. or giardia lamblia were not found in any cases. thus the cause of gastroenteritis was established in 58% of the patients. this figure was lower among patients in primary care (27%) than among hospitalized patients (72%), a difference mainly due to the high occurrence of rotavirus in the latter group. clostridium difficile was recovered in 20 cases (12%), eight of which harboured one more enteropathogenic agent. cultures from the nose and throat revealed streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, branhamella catarrhalis or group a, c and g streptococci in 58% of the patients with no differences regarding the occurrence of rotavirus in faeces. neither clostridium difficile nor respiratory tract pathogens were found to play a role in causation of gastroenteritis in the children investigated.

TI  == antibacterial activities of a new stabilized thienamycin, n-formimidoyl thienamycin, in comparison with other antibiotics.
AB  == the in vitro activity of a new crystalline derivative of thienamycin, n-formimidoyl thienamycin (mk0787), was tested against 46 laboratory reference strains and 2,158 clinical isolates of gram-positive and -negative bacteria, including anaerobes, and compared with cefoxitin, cefaxolin, carbenicillin, and amikacin. mk0787 was significantly more active than the reference antibiotics against most bacteria tests. mk0787 was 16- to 500-fold more active than the other antibiotics against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, and group a and group b streptococci, inhibiting most isolates at concentrations less than 0.031 micrograms/ml. the inhibition concentration against over 90% of 156 strains of streptococcus faecalis was 1 micrograms/ml. mk0787 had slightly less activity than carbenicillin against haemophilus influenzae. the minimal inhibitory concentrations of mk0787 against strains of enterobacter spp., citrobacter spp., serratia marcescems. pseudomonas aeruginosa, and clostridium difficile that are resistant to currently available antibiotics were less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml. the only species found resistant to mk0787 was pseudomonas maltophilia, which was equally nonsusceptible to the other reference  antibiotics.
