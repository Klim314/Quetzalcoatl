TI == effects of baseplates of orthodontic appliances with in situ generated silver nanoparticles on cariogenic bacteria: a randomized, double-blind cross-over clinical trial.
AB == aim: polymethyl-methacrylate (pmma) is commonly used primarily for baseplates of  orthodontic appliances (boa). the activities of cariogenic bacteria in bioflm on these surfaces may contribute to dental caries, gingival infammation and periodontal disease. the pmma incorporated with nanoparti-cles of silver (nanoag-i-pmma) and nanoag in situ in pmma (nanoag-is-pmma) have been shown to control the growth of cariogenic bacteria, but clinical trial of anti-cariogenic application of these novel materials in orthodontics has not been evaluated. the main aim of the study is to compare the clinical effectiveness of using nanoag-is-pmma and nanoag-i-pmma for construction of new boa in inhibiting the planktonic growth and bioflm formation of the cariogenic bacteria. materials and methods: twenty four patients with a median age of 12.6 years (7-15) harboring streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus and lactobacillus acidophilus as well as lactobacillus casei participated in the randomized, double-blind, cross-over study. the experimental boa, nanoag-is-boa and nanoag-i-boa, contained 0.5% w/w nanoag while the control boa was standard pmma. antibacterial effect of nanoag-is-boa and nanoag-i-boa was assessed against test cariogenic bacteria by planktonic and bioflm bacterial cells growth inhibition. results: the average levels of test cariogenic bacteria in saliva decreased about 2 to 70 fold (30.9-98.4%) compared to baseline depending on the microorganism type and test boa. bioflm inhibition analysis demonstrated that nanoag-i-boa and nanoag-is-boa inhibited the bioflm of all test bacteria by 20.1 to 79.9% compared to boa. nanoag-is-boa had a strong anti-bioflm effect against s. mutans, s. sobrinus and l. casei. however, nanoag-i-boa showed only slight anti-bioflm effects on test bacteria. most notably, at all period of the clinical trial, nanoag-is-boa showed a higher antibacterial activity than nanoag-i-boa. conclusion: based on the novel data that presented here, the nanoag-is-boa had strong antimicrobial activity in the planktonic phase and subsequent bioflm formation of the cariogenic bacteria. clinical significance: wearing of nanoag-is-boa has the potential to minimize dental plaque formation and caries during orthodontic treatment.

TI == a study of the fluorescence characteristics of common cariogenic microorganisms.
AB == objective: to explore the fluorescence characteristics of common cariogenic bacteria: streptococcus mutans, s. sanguis, actinomyces viscosus, prevotella intermedia, lactobacillus acidophilus, and candida albicans. methods: the bacteria were cultured on brain heart infusion (bhi) agar and bhi blood agar, and bacterial colonies were collected for further amplification in liquid medium. bacterial suspensions in physiological saline were equally divided into three parts for bacteria counting, fluorescence spectrometry detection, and fluorescence microscope examination. results: the optimal excitation wavelength of the bacteria was 350 nm; their characteristic fluorescence peak position was at 436 +/- 4 nm. there was a significant linear correlation between fluorescence intensity and bacterial concentration. the mean optical density (mod) of s. mutans and l. acidophilus cultivated in bhi blood was significantly higher than that cultivated in bhi agar (110 +/- 10 vs. 57 +/- 20; 94 +/- 16 vs. 31 +/- 12, respectively, p < 0.05). the mod of s. sanguis, a. viscosus, and p. intermedia cultivated in bhi blood agar was higher than that cultivated in bhi agar (37 +/- 12 vs. 36 +/- 11; 43 +/- 17 vs. 38 +/- 6; 86 +/- 21 vs. 72 +/- 8, respectively, p > 0.05); the opposite was observed for c. albicans. conclusion: at 350 nm excitation wavelength, 436 +/- 4 nm is an indicator for detecting six cariogenic bacteria. the fluorescence energy, q, is a valuable index reflecting bacterial concentration under fluorescence spectrometry detection. exogenous fluorescence groups have greater influence on fluorescence intensity and little influence on fluorescence peak position detection.

TI == innate immune response of pullets fed diets supplemented with prebiotics and synbiotics.
AB == prebiotics and synbiotics are considered to be among the most promising replacements for in-feed antibiotic growth promoters (agp) in poultry feed. the current study was designed to study the effect of bacitracin methylene disalicylate (bmd) (control), yeast-derived carbohydrates (ydc), and a blend of ydc and probiotics [lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, streptococcus faecium, bacillus subtilis, and ydc] (snb) in the performance and innate immune response of pullets. feed intake and bw were measured on a weekly basis. at the end of the study (d 21), 10 birds/treatment were sacrificed by cervical dislocation and ileum, cecal tonsil, and spleen samples were collected for gene expression analysis. no significant difference (p > 0.05) in feed intake and g:f was observed among treatments. in the second and third wk age, higher bw gain was observed in snb treatment compared to control and both control and ydc treatments, respectively. expression of tlr2b was upregulated in ydc and snb in the ileum, and in snb in the spleen (p < 0.05). expression of tlr4 was downregulated in snb in the cecal tonsil. expression of tlr21 was downregulated in ydc in the ileum, while it was upregulated in snb in the spleen (p < 0.05). in the ileum, ydc resulted in downregulated il-12p35, cxcli2, and il-13, and snb resulted in upregulated il-6, interferon (ifn)-gamma, and il-4 (p < 0.05). in the cecal tonsil, ydc resulted in upregulated il-12p35, il-2, il-13 and il-10, and snb resulted in downregulated il-2 and upregulated il-13 and il-10 (p < 0.05). in the spleen, ydc resulted in dowregulated il-2 and cxcli2, and snb resulted in upregulated il-6, ifn-gamma, il-4, and il-10 (p < 0.05). in conclusion, no change in performance was observed. innate immune response analysis showed snb with a more potent effect compared to ydc where the former showed a balanced t-helper (th)-1/th-2 response locally and a more th-2-dependent response systemically; snb might provide a more beneficial immune modulation with maintaining immune homeostasis, which was observed in a strong il-10 response.

AB == lactobacilli are widespread in natural environments and are increasingly being investigated as potential health modulators. in this study, we have adapted the broad-host-range vector pnz8048 to express the mcherry protein (prcr) to expand the usage of the mcherry protein for analysis of gene expression in lactobacillus. this vector is also able to replicate in streptococcus pneumoniae and escherichia coli. the usage of prcr as a promoter probe was validated in lactobacillus acidophilus by characterizing the regulation of lactacin b expression. the results show that the regulation is exerted at the transcriptional level, with lbab gene expression being specifically induced by co-culture of the l. acidophilus bacteriocin producer and the s. thermophilus sty-31 inducer bacterium.

TI == inhibitory effects of children's toothpastes on streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguinis and lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB == aim: as suppression of streptococcus mutans in young children may prevent or delay colonisation of the oral cavity, toothbrushing with dentifrices containing anti-s. mutans activity may aid in preventing caries. the aims of this study were to compare the effects of children's dentifrices on the growth of s. mutans and non-mutans bacteria (streptococcus sanguinis and lactobacillus acidophilus). materials and methods: the agar diffusion assay at neutral ph was used to examine the antibacterial activity of commercial dentifrices and their major constituents. results: dentifrices containing 1,450 ppm fluoride produced greater growth inhibition of both s. mutans and s. sanguinis than those with <500 ppm. no inhibition was seen for pure solutions of sodium fluoride or sodium monofluorophosphate at fluoride concentrations up to 100,000 ppm. stannous fluoride exerted antibacterial effects at concentrations above 10,000 ppm. significant growth inhibition of both s. mutans and s. sanguinis was seen with sodium lauryl sulphate at 2,500 ppm and with triclosan at 100 ppm. no inhibitory effects were seen for xylitol, sorbitol, sodium pyrophosphate or polyethylene glycol at concentrations up to 80,000 ppm. conclusion: sodium lauryl sulphate is the major bacterial inhibitory compound in children's dentifrices.

TI == use of probiotics to reduce faecal shedding of shiga toxin-producing escherichia  coli in sheep.
AB == shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli (stec) are zoonotic, foodborne pathogens of humans. ruminants, including sheep, are the primary reservoirs of stec and there is a need to develop intervention strategies to reduce the entry of stec into the food chain. the initiation of the majority of bacterial, enteric infections involves colonisation of the gut mucosal surface by the pathogen. however, probiotic bacteria can serve to decrease the severity of infection via a number of mechanisms including competition for receptors and nutrients, and/or the synthesis of organic acids and bacteriocins that create an environment unfavourable for pathogen development. the aim of the current study was to determine whether the administration of a probiotic mixture to sheep experimentally infected with a non-o157 stec strain, carrying stx1, stx2 and eae genes, was able to decrease faecal shedding of the pathogen. the probiotic mixture contained lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus bulgaricus, lactobacillus lactis, streptococcus thermophilus and enterococcus faecium. the numbers of non-o157 stec in faecal samples collected from sheep receiving daily doses of the probiotic mixture were significantly lower at the 3rd, 5th and 6th week post-inoculation when compared to the levels recorded in untreated animals. it was concluded that administration of the probiotic mixture reduced faecal shedding of non-o157 stec in sheep, and holds potential as a pre-harvest intervention method to reduce transmission to humans.

TI == local probiotic therapy for vaginal candida albicans infections.
AB == the high rate of vaginal candida albicans recurrence is attributed to azole resistance rates as high as 15 %. the aim of this study was to determine the clinical and microbiological efficacy of standard azole therapy for treatment of vaginal c. albicans infection alone and in combination with local probiotic as well as the effects on vaginal microbiota. this study included 436 women with vaginal candidiasis randomly assigned to two treatment groups. the first group, with 207 patients (12 dropouts), was administered 150 mg fluconazole and a single vaginal globule of fenticonazole (600 mg) on the same day. the second group of 209 patients (8 dropouts) followed the same treatment schedule; however, ten applications of a vaginal probiotic containing lactobacillus acidophilus, l. rhamnosus, streptococcus thermophilus, and l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus were also administered beginning the fifth day after azole treatment. microbiological analysis of the therapy efficacy in the first treatment group showed c. albicans resistance in over 30 % of patients. clinical complaints persisted after treatment administration in 79.7 % (n = 165) of women in this group. clinical complaints in the second group decreased to 31.1 % (n = 65) and microbiological efficacy also improved among investigated parameters, from 93.7 % (n = 193) to 95.2 % (n = 198). the local application of probiotics after administration of combined azoles for treatment of vaginal c. albicans infections increases therapy efficacy and could prevent relapse.

TI == effects of synbiotics injected in ovo on regulation of immune-related gene expression in adult chickens.
AB == objective: to determine immunomodulatory effects of synbiotics administered in ovo on immune-related gene expression in adult chickens. animals: 30 green-legged partridgelike chickens. procedures: on incubation day 12, eggs were injected with 3 synbiotics (lactococcus lactis subsp lactis ibb sl1 with raffinose family oligosaccharides [rfos; s1], lactococcus lactis subsp cremoris ibb sc1 with rfos [s2], and lactobacillus acidophilus and streptococcus faecium with lactose [s3]). control eggs were injected with rfos prebiotic or saline (0.9% nacl) solution. gene expression of 6 cytokines (interleukin [il]-4, il-6, il-12p40, il-18, interferon [ifn]-beta, and ifn-gamma) and 1 chemokine (il-8) was analyzed in the cecal tonsils and spleen of 6-week-old chickens by means of reverse transcription quantitative pcr assays. results: gene expression for il-4, il-6, ifn-beta, and il-18 was significantly upregulated in the spleen of chickens in groups s2 and s3. in contrast, il-12 expression was downregulated in group s2 and ifn-gamma expression was downregulated in group s3. expression of il-8 did not change in chickens treated with synbiotics in ovo. gene expression of all cytokines, except for il-18, was downregulated in cecal tonsils. conclusions and clinical relevance: in ovo administration of synbiotics activated the immune system in adult chickens. the intestinal immune system (cecal tonsils) had downregulation of expression for the cytokines evaluated, which indicated an increase in oral tolerance, whereas in the peripheral part of the immune system (spleen), expression of il-4 and il-6 was upregulated. evaluation of immune-related gene expression patterns may be useful when monitoring the effectiveness of synbiotic selection with respect to immunobiotic properties.

TI == the antibacterial and antifungal activity of essential oils extracted from guatemalan medicinal plants.
AB == context: essential oils are prevalent in many medicinal plants used for oral hygiene and treatment of diseases. objective: medicinal plant species were extracted to determine the essential oil content. those producing sufficient oil were screened for activity against staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus acidophilus, and candida albicans. materials and methods: plant samples were collected, frozen, and essential oils were extracted by steam distillation. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) were determined using a tube dilution assay for those species yielding sufficient oil. results: fifty-nine of the 141 plant species produced sufficient oil for collection and 12 species not previously reported to produce essential oils were identified. essential oil extracts from 32 species exhibited activity against one or more microbes. oils from eight species were highly inhibitory to s. mutans, four species were highly inhibitory to c. albicans, and 19 species yielded mic values less than the reference drugs. discussion: results suggest that 11 species were highly inhibitory to the microbes tested and merit further investigation. oils from cinnamomum zeylanicum blume (lauraceae), citrus aurantiifolia (christm.) swingle (rutaceae), lippia graveolens kunth (verbenaceae), and origanum vulgare l. (lamiaceae) yielded highly significant or moderate activity against all microbes and have potential as antimicrobial agents. conclusion: teas prepared by decoction or infusion are known methods for extracting essential oils. oils from 11 species were highly active against the microbes tested and merit investigation as to their potential for addressing health-related issues and in oral hygiene.

TI == short-term probiotic therapy alleviates small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, but does not improve intestinal permeability in chronic liver disease.
AB == aim: : although numerous animal studies suggest that probiotic therapy has beneficial effects in various liver diseases, the evidence for beneficial effects in human liver disease is controversial. this study was carried out to investigate the efficacy of probiotic therapy in alleviating small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (sibo) and permeability in chronic liver disease. methods: fifty-three patients with chronic liver disease were randomized to either probiotic therapy or placebo. six bacterial species were used: bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium lactis, bifidobacterium longum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus rhamnosus, and streptococcus thermophilus. after 4 weeks, changes in the composition of fecal bacteria, sibo, intestinal permeability, and clinical symptoms were examined. results: three of the six probiotic species, b. lactis, l. rhamnosus, and l. acidophilus, increased in the feces of the probiotic therapy group (p<0.001), whereas there was no change in fecal microbiota in the placebo group. sibo disappeared in many individuals of the probiotic therapy group, but none in the placebo (24 vs. 0%, p<0.05). general gastrointestinal symptoms also improved more in the probiotic group and improvement in intestinal permeability was slightly but not significantly more frequent in the probiotic arm than the placebo arm (50 vs. 31.3%, p=0.248). numbers of lactobacilli in stool were correlated negatively with intestinal permeability (p for trend<0.05). liver chemistry did not improve significantly in either group. conclusions: we conclude that short-term probiotic administration in chronic liver disease is effective in alleviating sibo and clinical symptoms, but ineffective in improving intestinal permeability and liver function.

AB == the ability of 55 strains from different lactobacillus species to produce folate  was investigated. in order to evaluate folic acid productivity, lactobacilli were cultivated in the folate-free culture medium (facm). most of the tested strains needed folate for growth. the production and the extent of vitamin accumulation were distinctive features of individual strains. lactobacillus amylovorus crl887 was selected for further studies because of its ability to produce significantly higher concentrations of vitamin (81.2 +/- 5.4 mug/l). the safety of this newly identified folate producing strain was evaluated through healthy experimental mice. no bacterial translocation was detected in liver and spleen after consumption of crl887 during 7 days and no undesirable side effects were observed in the animals that received this strain. this strain in co-culture with previously selected folate producing starter cultures (lactobacillus bulgaricus crl871, and streptococcus thermophilus crl803 and crl415) yielded a yogurt containing high folate concentrations (263.1 +/- 2.4 mug/l); a single portion of which would provide 15% of the recommended dietary allowance. this is the first report where a lactobacillus amylovorus strain was successfully used as co-culture for natural folate bio-enrichment of fermented milk.

TI == effect of lactobacillus species on streptococcus mutans biofilm formation.
AB == streptococcus mutans is the primary pathogen responsible for initiating dental caries and decay. the presence of sucrose, stimulates s. mutans to produce insoluble glucans to form oral biofilm also known as dental plaque to initiate caries lesion. the gtfb and luxs genes of s. mutans are responsible for formation and maturation of biofilm. lactobacillus species as probiotic can reduces the count of s. mutans. in this study effect of different lactobacillus species against the formation of s. mutans biofilm was observed. growing biofilm in the presence of sucrose was detected using 96 well microtiter plate crystal violet assay and biofilm formation by s. mutans in the presence of lactobacillus was detected. gene expression of biofilm forming genes (gtfb and luxs) was quantified through real-time pcr. all strains of lactobacillus potently reduced the formation of s. mutans biofilm whereas lactobacillus acidophilus reduced the genetic expression by 60-80%. therefore, probiotic lactobacillus species can be used as an alternative instead of antibiotics to decrease the chance of dental caries by reducing the count of s. mutans and their gene expression to maintain good oral health.

TI == effect of an oxygenating agent on oral bacteria in vitro and on dental plaque composition in healthy young adults.
AB == oral bacteria live in symbiosis with the host. therefore, when mouthwashes are indicated, selective inhibition of taxa contributing to disease is preferred instead of broad-spectrum antimicrobials. the potential selectivity of an oxygenating mouthwash, ardox-x(r) (ax), has not been assessed. the aim of this study was to determine the antimicrobial potential of ax and the effects of a twice-daily oral rinse on dental plaque composition. material and methods: in vitro, 16 oral bacterial strains were tested using agar diffusion susceptibility, minimum inhibitory and minimum bactericidal concentration tests. a pilot clinical study was performed with 25 healthy volunteers. clinical assessments and microbiological sampling of supragingival plaque were performed at 1 month before the experiment (pre-exp), at the start of the experiment (baseline) and after the one-week experimental period (post-exp). during the experiment individuals used ax mouthwash twice daily in absence of other oral hygiene measures. the microbiological composition of plaque was assessed by 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing. results: ax showed high inter-species variation in microbial growth inhibition. the tested prevotella strains and fusobacterium nucleatum showed the highest sensitivity, while streptococci and lactobacillus acidophilus were most resistant to ax. plaque scores at pre-exp and baseline visits did not differ significantly (p = 0.193), nor did the microbial composition of plaque. during a period of 7-days non-brushing but twice daily rinsing plaque scores increased from 2.21 (0.31) at baseline to 2.43 (0.39) post-exp. a significant microbial shift in composition was observed: genus streptococcus and veillonella increased while corynebacterium, haemophilus, leptotrichia, cardiobacterium and capnocytophaga decreased (p </= 0.001). conclusion: ax has the potential for selective inhibition of oral bacteria. the shift in oral microbiome after 1 week of rinsing deserves further research.

AB == statement of problem: bacterial plaque must be routinely removed from teeth, adjacent structures, and prostheses. however, the removal of this plaque can inadvertently increase the risk of future bacterial adhesion. purpose: the purpose of this investigation was to assess the change in the surface roughness of 3 different surfaces after dental prophylactic instrumentation and how this influenced bacterial adhesion. material and methods: forty specimens each of type iii gold alloy, lithium disilicate, and zirconia were fabricated in the same dimensions. the specimens were divided into 4 groups: ultrasonic scaler, stainless steel curette, prophylaxis cup, and control. pretreatment surface roughness measurements were made with a profilometer. surface treatments in each group were performed with a custom mechanical scaler. posttreatment surface roughness values were measured. in turn, the specimens were inoculated with streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus acidophilus, and actinomyces viscosus. bacterial adhesion was assessed by rinsing the specimens with sterile saline to remove unattached cells. the specimens were then placed in sterile tubes with 1 ml of sterile saline. the solution was plated and quantified. scanning electron microscopy was performed. the statistical analysis of surface roughness was completed by using repeated-measures single-factor anova with a bonferroni correction. results: the surface roughness values for gold alloy specimens increased as a result of prophylaxis cup treatment (0.221 to 0.346 ra) (p<.01) and stainless steel curette treatment (0.264 to 1.835 ra) (p<.01). the results for bacterial adhesion to gold alloy proved inconclusive. a quantitative comparison indicated no statistically significant differences in pretreatment and posttreatment surface roughness values for lithium disilicate and zirconia specimens. in spite of these similarities, the overall bacterial adherence values for lithium disilicate were significantly greater than those recorded for gold alloy or zirconia (p<.05). instrumentation of the lithium disilicate and zirconia with the stainless steel curette significantly increased bacterial adhesion compared with the control (p<.05). conclusions: the results of this investigation indicate that type iii gold alloy exhibited increased surface roughness values after stainless steel curette and prophylaxis cup treatments. zirconia was less susceptible to bacterial adhesion than lithium disilicate, and greater bacterial adhesion was found for the stainless steel curette than the other instrumentation methods.

TI == molecular detection of bacteria associated to dental caries in 4-12-year-old tunisian children.
AB == the occurrence of several microbial species in the oral cavity of 4-12-year-old tunisian children was investigated. samples were taken from 158 children (81 caries actives and 77 caries free). genomic dna was extracted and analyzed for the presence of 17 microbial species using a polymerase chain reaction assay. all samples were positive for at least one of the target microbial strains. streptococcus mutans was the most prevalent species (76.5%) detected in genomic dna collected from carious lesions. other prevalent species were candida spp (63%), streptococcus salivarius (59%) and streptococcus oralis (42%). the frequency of lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus plantarum, and lactobacillus casei-group in caries lesions was 29.5%, 34.5% and 22% respectively. pathogenic bacteria such as staphylococcus aureus was found in 28.5% of carious lesion samples compared to 15.5% in the control. frequency of porphyromonas endodontali, actinomyces radicidentis and treponema denticola recovery did not differ significantly between origins of samples. pcr analysis of genomic dna detect various oral bacteria that differ between caries actives and caries-free children. in addition, the association of same aciduric bacteria (s. mutans, s. salivarius, l. acidophilus) and caries formation was noticed.

TI == the inhibitory effect of a fermented papaya preparation on growth, hydrophobicity, and acid production of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus mitis, and lactobacillus acidophilus: its implications in oral health improvement of diabetics.
AB == fermented papaya preparation (fpp) is a "natural health product." the high incidence of dental caries, gingivitis, periodontitis, and oral microbial infection cases among patients with diabetes mellitus continues to prevail. the potential role of fpp against common oral microbiota (streptococcus mutans, streptococcus mitis, and lactobacillus acidophilus) isolated from the human oral cavity was investigated using in vitro simulation models of dental plaque and caries. fpp showed an inhibitory effect against the growth (at 0.05 mg/ml: s. mutans: -6.9%; s. mitis: -4.47%, p < 0.05), acid production (at 0.05 mg/ml: s. mutans: +6.38%; l. acidophilus: +2.25%), and hydrophobicity (at 50 mg/ml: s. mutans: 1.01%, p < 0.01; s. mitis: 7.66%, p < 0.05) of tested microbiota. the results of this study suggest that low doses of fpp may be a suitable complement to good oral hygiene practice for the effective prevention of dental caries, plaque, and gingivitis. the functional application of fpp as a constituent of a balanced diet and active lifestyle can make a positive contribution to the oral health status and well-being of patients with diabetes.

TI == probiotic viability and storage stability of yogurts and fermented milks prepared with several mixtures of lactic acid bacteria.
AB == currently, the food industry wants to expand the range of probiotic yogurts but each probiotic bacteria offers different and specific health benefits. little information exists on the influence of probiotic strains on physicochemical properties and sensory characteristics of yogurts and fermented milks. six probiotic yogurts or fermented milks and 1 control yogurt were prepared, and we evaluated several physicochemical properties (ph, titratable acidity, texture, color, and syneresis), microbial viability of starter cultures (lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus) and probiotics (lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, and lactobacillus reuteri) during fermentation and storage (35 d at 5 degrees c), as well as sensory preference among them. decreases in ph (0.17 to 0.50 units) and increases in titratable acidity (0.09 to 0.29%) were observed during storage. only the yogurt with s. thermophilus, l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, and l. reuteri differed in firmness. no differences in adhesiveness were determined among the tested yogurts, fermented milks, and the control. syneresis was in the range of 45 to 58%. no changes in color during storage were observed and no color differences were detected among the evaluated fermented milk products. counts of s. thermophilus decreased from 1.8 to 3.5 log during storage. counts of l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus also decreased in probiotic yogurts and varied from 30 to 50% of initial population. probiotic bacteria also lost viability throughout storage, although the 3 probiotic fermented milks maintained counts >/= 10(7)cfu/ml for 3 wk. probiotic bacteria had variable viability in yogurts, maintaining counts of l. acidophilus >/= 10(7) cfu/ml for 35 d, of l. casei for 7d, and of l. reuteri for 14 d. we found no significant sensory preference among the 6 probiotic yogurts and fermented milks or the control. however, the yogurt and fermented milk made with l. casei were better accepted. this study presents relevant information on physicochemical, sensory, and microbial properties of probiotic yogurts and fermented milks, which could guide the dairy industry in developing new probiotic products.

TI == lactose digestion from yogurt: mechanism and relevance.
AB == yogurt is traditionally consumed throughout the world among populations who are seemingly unable to digest lactose. this review provides a historical overview of the studies that show lactose digestion and tolerance from yogurt by lactose-intolerant people. the lactose in yogurt is digested more efficiently than other dairy sources of lactose because the bacteria inherent in yogurt assist with its digestion. the bacterial lactase survives the acidic conditions of the stomach, apparently being physically protected within the bacterial cells and facilitated by the buffering capacity of yogurt. the increasing ph as the yogurt enters the small intestine and a slower gastrointestinal transit time allow the bacterial lactase to be active, digesting lactose from yogurt sufficiently to prevent symptoms in lactose-intolerant people. there is little difference in the lactase capability of different commercial yogurts, because they apparently contain lactobacillus bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus in sufficient quantities (10(8) bacteria/ml). however, lactobacillus acidophilus appears to require cell membrane disruption to physically release the lactase. compared with unflavored yogurts, flavored yogurts appear to exhibit somewhat reduced lactase activity but are still well tolerated.

TI == short communication: survival of the characteristic microbiota in probiotic fermented camel, cow, goat, and sheep milks during refrigerated storage.
AB == the objective of this study was to monitor the viability during storage of lactobacillus acidophilus la-5 (a), bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis bb-12 (b), and streptococcus thermophilus chcc 742/2130 (t) in probiotic cultured dairy foods made from pasteurized camel, cow, goat, and sheep milks fermented by an abt-type culture. the products manufactured were stored at 4 degrees c for 42d. microbiological analyses were performed at weekly intervals. streptococcus thermophilus chcc 742/2130 was the most numerous culture component in all 4 products both at the beginning and at the end of storage. the viable counts of streptococci showed no significant decline in fermented camel milk throughout the entire storage period. the initial numbers of lb. acidophilus la-5 were over 2 orders of magnitude lower than those of strep. thermophilus chcc 742/2130. with the progress of time, a slow and constant decrease was observed in lactobacilli counts; however, the final viability percentages of this organism did not differ significantly in the probiotic fermented milks tested. the cultured dairy foods made from cow, sheep, and goat milks had comparable b. animalis ssp. lactis bb-12 counts on d 0, exceeding by approximately 0.5 log10 cycle those in the camel milk-based product. no significant losses occurred in viability of bifidobacteria in fermented camel, cow, and sheep milks during 6wk of refrigerated storage. in conclusion, all 4 varieties of milk proved to be suitable raw materials for the manufacture of abt-type fermented dairy products that were microbiologically safe and beneficial for human consumption. it was suggested that milk from small ruminants be increasingly used to produce probiotic fermented dairy foods. the development of camel milk-based probiotic cultured milks appears to be even more promising because new markets could thus be conquered. it must be emphasized, however, that further microbiological and sensory studies, technology development activities, and market research are needed before such food products can be successfully commercialized.

TI == dental caries and vaccination strategy against the major cariogenic pathogen, streptococcus mutans.
AB == although dental caries is a global problem in modern times, no vaccines are available for preventing these diseases. among the bacterial pathogens that cause dental caries, including streptococcus mutans, s. sobrinus, and lactobacillus acidophilus, and actinomyces viscosus, s. mutans is the most prominent and prevalent species. during the past, much effort has been focused on developing vaccines against s. mutans. early attempts used fixed whole cells of s. mutans, but later it was found that serological cross-reactivity between heart tissue antigens and streptococcus antigens occurs in patients resulting in rheumatic fever. recently, with the aid of molecular biology, the genome sequences of s. mutans strains are available, which can greatly accelerate the development of subunit vaccines. many desirable candidate subunit vaccines have been or are going to be evaluated in either experimental animal models or in human clinical trials. in this review article, we summarized the updated progress made in deciphering the mechanisms of disease development and the achievements of vaccine research against s. mutans.

TI == adhesion forces and composition of planktonic and adhering oral microbiomes.
AB == the oral microbiome consists of a planktonic microbiome residing in saliva and an adhering microbiome (the biofilm adhering to oral hard and soft tissues). here we hypothesized that possible differences in microbial composition of the planktonic and adhering oral microbiome on teeth can be related to the forces by which different bacterial species are attracted to the tooth surface. the relative presence of 7 oral bacterial species in saliva and biofilm collected from 10 healthy human volunteers was determined twice in each volunteer by denaturing-gradient-gel electrophoresis. analysis of both microbiomes showed complete separation of the planktonic from the adhering oral microbiome. next, adhesion forces of corresponding bacterial strains with saliva-coated enamel surfaces were measured by atomic force microscopy. species that were found predominantly in the adhering microbiome had significantly higher adhesion forces to saliva-coated enamel (-0.60 to -1.05 nn) than did species mostly present in the planktonic microbiome (-0.40 to -0.55 nn). it is concluded that differences in composition of the planktonic and the adhering oral microbiome are due to small differences in the forces by which strains adhere to saliva-coated enamel, providing an important step in understanding site- and material-specific differences in the composition of biofilms in the oral cavity.

TI == simultaneous improvement of specificity and affinity of aptamers against streptococcus mutans by in silico maturation for biosensor development.
AB == in silico evolution with an in vitro system can facilitate the development of functional aptamers with high specificity and affinity. although a general technique known as systematic evolution of ligand by exponential enrichment (selex) is an efficient method for aptamer selection, it sometimes fails to identify aptamers with sufficient binding properties. we have previously developed in silico maturation (ism) to improve functions of aptamers based on genetic algorithms. ism represents an intelligent exploitation of a random search within a defined sequence space to optimize aptamer sequences and improve their function of interest. here we demonstrated a successful application of ism of aptamers to simultaneously improve specificity and affinity for streptococcus mutans with discovery of a core sequence, which was required to form a polymerized guanine quadruplex structure for target binding. we applied ism to aptamers selected by whole-cell selex and identified an aptamer with up to 16-fold improvement in affinity compared to its parent aptamers, and specificity was increased to show 12-fold more binding to s. mutans than to lactobacillus acidophilus. furthermore, we demonstrated a specific flow-through detection of s. mutans at a concentration range of 1 x 10(5) -10(8) cfu/ml using the evolved aptamer immobilized on gold colloids.

TI == an in vitro study on the secondary caries-prevention properties of three restorative materials.
AB == statement of problem: secondary caries is considered to be the most important and common reason for the replacement of all types of restorations. purpose: the purpose of the study was to evaluate in vitro both the anticaries efficacy and marginal integrity of amalgam, glass ionomer cement, and composite resin restorations in a cariogenic condition. material and methods: class ii cavities were prepared on 60 extracted teeth, which were assigned to 3 groups and restored either with amalgam, glass ionomer, or composite resin. after thermal cycling and sterilization, the teeth were set in an artificial carious environment for 10 days. the bacteria from the margin of the restorations were then collected, and microleakage was evaluated by means of dyeing. according to the locations, the demineralization of tooth tissue around the restoration was divided into 3 parts: artificial outer lesion, artificial enamel wall lesion, and artificial dentin wall lesion. the depths of the artificial outer lesion and the areas of the artificial enamel and dentin wall lesions were investigated with a confocal laser scanning microscope after all the specimens had been stained with 0.1 mm rhodamine b. statistical analyses consisted of 1-way anova and kruskal-wallis tests (alpha=.05). results: no significant difference was noted in terms of the number of bacteria around the restorations for the 3 materials; the microleakage of amalgam was the least among the 3 types of restorations; the outer enamel lesion depth around the glass ionomer cement was the lowest, and the wall lesion area around the amalgam was the smallest. conclusions: no definite inhibitory effect of fluoride releasing restorative materials (glass ionomer) was apparent on lactobacillus acidophilus in this study. the amalgam restorations showed the best marginal integrity and the smallest artificial wall lesion among the 3 types of restorations.

TI == lab-test((r)) 4: dental caries and bacteriological analysis.
AB == dental caries is one of the most common infectious ultifactorial diseases worldwide, characterized by the progressive demineralization of the tooth, following the action of bacterial acid metabolism. the main factors predisposing the onset of the carious process are: 1) the presence of bacterial species able to lower the ph until critical values of 5.5, 2) the absence of adequate oral hygiene, 3) an inefficient immune response anti-caries, 4) the type of alimentary diet and 5) the structure of the teeth. among the 200 bacterial species isolated from dental plaque the most pathogenic for dental caries are: streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, lactobacillus acidophilus, actinomices viscusus and bifidobacterium dentium. our laboratory (lab((r)) s.r.l., codigoro, ferrara, italy) has developed a test for absolute and relative quantification of the most common oral cariogenic bacteria. the test uses specific primers and probes for the amplification of bacteria genome sequences in polymerase chain reaction real time. the results provide a profile of patient infection, helpful for improving the diagnosis and planning of preventive treatment to reduce the bacterial load.

TI == photodynamic antimicrobial therapy of curcumin in biofilms and carious dentine.
AB == photodynamic therapy (pdt) is a technique that involves the activation of photosensitizers by light in the presence of oxygen, resulting in the production of reactive radicals that are capable of inducing cell death. the present study evaluated the susceptibility of streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus acidophilus to pdt grown as multi-species in the biofilm phase versus in dentine carious lesions. a brain-heart infusion culture medium supplemented with 1% glucose, 2% sucrose, and 1% young primary culture of l. acidophilus 10(8) cfu/ml and s. mutans 10(8) cfu/ml was used to develop multi-species biofilms and to induce caries on human dentine slabs. five different concentrations of curcumin (0.75, 1.5, 3.0, 4.0, and 5.0 g/l) were used associated with 5.7 j/cm(2) light emission diode. four different groups were analyzed l-d- (control group), l-d+ (drug group), l+d- (light group), and l+d+ (pdt group). anova/tukey's tests were conducted to compare groups. a significant reduction (p <0.05) in cell viability was observed in the biofilm phase following photosensitization with all curcumin concentrations tested. to achieve significant bacterial reduction (p <0.05) in carious dentine, it was necessary to utilize 5.0 g/l of curcumin in association with blue light. no significant reduction was found for l-d+, supporting the absence of the drug's dark toxicity. s. mutans and l. acidophilus were susceptible to curcumin in the presence of blue light. however, due to light penetration and drug diffusion difficulties, these microorganisms within dentine carious lesions were less affected than they were in the biofilm phase.

TI == crystal structure analysis of a fatty acid double-bond hydratase from lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB == bacteria have evolved mechanisms for the hydrogenation of unsaturated fatty acids. hydroxy fatty acid formation may be the first step in such a process; however, knowledge of the structural and mechanistic aspects of this reaction is scarce. recently, myosin cross-reactive antigen was shown to be a bacterial fad-containing hydratase which acts on the 9z and 12z double bonds of c16 and c18 non-esterified fatty acids, with the formation of 10-hydroxy and 10,13-dihydroxy fatty acids. these fatty acid hydratases form a large protein family which is conserved across gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria with no sequence similarity to any known protein apart from the fad-binding motif. in order to shed light on the substrate recognition and the mechanism of the hydratase reaction, the crystal structure of the hydratase from lactobacillus acidophilus (lah) was determined by single-wavelength anomalous dispersion. crystal structures of apo lah and of lah with bound linoleic acid were refined at resolutions of 2.3 and 1.8 a, respectively. lah is a homodimer; each protomer consists of four intricately connected domains. three of them form the fad-binding and substrate-binding sites and reveal structural similarity to three domains of several flavin-dependent enzymes, including amine oxidoreductases. the additional fourth domain of lah is located at the c-terminus and consists of three alpha-helices. it covers the entrance to the hydrophobic substrate channel leading from the protein surface to the active site. in the presence of linoleic acid, the fourth domain of one protomer undergoes conformational changes and opens the entrance to the substrate-binding channel of the other protomer of the lah homodimer. the linoleic acid molecule is bound at the entrance to the substrate channel, suggesting movement of the lid domain triggered by substrate recognition.

TI == in-vitro activity of saponins of bauhinia purpurea, madhuca longifolia, celastrus paniculatus and semecarpus anacardium on selected oral pathogens.
AB == objective: dental caries, periodontitis and other mucosal diseases are caused by  a complex community of microorganisms. this study aimed to investigate the antimicrobial properties of saponins of four important oil yielding medicinal plant extracts on selected oral pathogens that are involved in such diseases. materials and methods: saponins were extracted from bauhinia purpurea, madhuca longifolia, celastrus paniculatus and semecarpus anacardium and purified. antimicrobial properties of these saponins against streptococcus mutans, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus salivarius, staphylococcus aureus and lactobacillus acidophilus were determined using well diffusion method. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) was determined as the lowest concentration of saponins inhibiting bacterial growth after 14 h of incubation at 37 degrees c. the bactericidal activity was evaluated using the viable cell count method. results: the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) of madhuca longifolia saponin on streptococcus mutans mtcc 890, streptococcus mitis and staphylococcus aureus was 18.3 +/- 0.15/34.4 +/- 0.24 mug/ml, 19.0 +/- 0.05/32.2 +/- 0.0 mug/ml and 21.2 +/- 0.35/39.0 +/- 0.30 mug/ml, respectively and bauhinia purpurea saponin on streptococcus mutans mtcc 890, staphylococcus aureus and lactobacillus acidophilus was 26.4 +/- 0.20/43.0 +/- 0.40 mug/ml, 29.0 +/- 0.30/39.6 +/- 0.12 mug/ml and 20.2 +/- 0.05/36.8 +/- 0.23 mug/ml, respectively. conclusion: the strong antimicrobial activity of madhuca longifolia and bauhinia purpurea may be due to the presence of complex triterpenoid saponins, oleanane type triterpenoid glycosides or atypical pentacyclic triterpenoid saponin. hence, these extracted saponins may be used in food and oral products to prevent and control oral diseases.

AB == isomaltooligosaccharides (imo) have been suggested as promising prebiotics that stimulate the growth of probiotic bacteria. genomes of probiotic lactobacilli from the acidophilus group, as represented by lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm, encode alpha-1,6 glucosidases of the family gh13_31 (glycoside hydrolase family 13 subfamily 31) that confer degradation of imo. these genes reside frequently within maltooligosaccharide utilization operons, which include an atp-binding cassette transporter and alpha-glucan active enzymes, e.g., maltogenic amylases and maltose phosphorylases, and they also occur separated from any carbohydrate transport or catabolism genes on the genomes of some acidophilus complex members, as in l. acidophilus ncfm. besides the isolated locus encoding a gh13_31 enzyme, the abc transporter and another gh13 in the maltooligosaccharide operon were induced in response to imo or maltotetraose, as determined by reverse transcription-pcr (rt-pcr) transcriptional analysis, suggesting coregulation of alpha-1,6- and alpha-1,4-glucooligosaccharide utilization loci in l. acidophilus ncfm. the l. acidophilus ncfm gh13_31 (lagh13_31) was produced recombinantly and shown to be a glucan 1,6-alpha-glucosidase active on imo and dextran and product-inhibited by glucose. the catalytic efficiency of lagh13_31 on dextran and the dextran/panose (trisaccharide) efficiency ratio were the highest reported for this class of enzymes, suggesting higher affinity at distal substrate binding sites. the crystal structure of lagh13_31 was determined to a resolution of 2.05 a and revealed additional substrate contacts at the +2 subsite in lagh13_31 compared to the gh13_31 from streptococcus mutans (smgh13_31), providing a possible structural rationale to the relatively high affinity for dextran. a comprehensive phylogenetic and activity motif analysis mapped imo utilization enzymes from gut microbiota to rationalize preferential utilization of imo by gut residents.

TI == dual functionality of triticale as a novel dietary source of prebiotics with antioxidant activity in fermented dairy products.
AB == the objectives of this study were to: (i) define the optimum concentration of triticale bran (tb) that can be incorporated in yogurt, (ii) evaluate the prebiotic effects of tb on microbial viability, ph and total titratable acidity (tta) in yogurt across 28 days of cold storage, and (iii) measure the oxygen radical absorbance capacity (orac) of water-extractable polysaccharides (wep) in tb. lactobacillus bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus were used as starter cultures. lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium lactis were used as probiotics. a concentration of 4% tb in yogurt was determined to be the maximum amount that could be added without causing synersis. by day 7, the number of bacteria greatly increased in yogurt samples containing tb and maintained higher viable bacteria counts at the end of the cold storage period, in comparison to controls (p </= 0.05). confirming this data was the lower ph levels and higher tta values of tb yogurt samples exhibited throughout 28 days (p </= 0.05). polysaccharide extracts of tb exhibited strong antioxidant activity with an orac value of 33.86 +/- 2.30 mumol trolox equivalents (te)/g of bran. results of this study suggest that tb may serve as a new prebiotic and antioxidant source for functional foods and nutraceutical applications.

AB == probiotics are live microorganisms claimed to exert beneficial effects on the host. this study investigated their effect on the metabolism and pharmacokinetics of sulfasalazine (ssz), a drug whose efficacy depends on metabolism by azoreductase (ar) in the gut microbiota to sulfapyridine (sp) and 5-acetylsalicylic acid (5-asa). the probiotic strains lactobacillus acidophilus l10, bifidobacterium lactis b94 and streptococcus salivarius k12 possessed ar activity and a corresponding ability to metabolize ssz. treatment of male wistar rats (n = 5) with oral 2 g doses of a mixture of the three probiotics (total dose 1.8 x 10(9) cfu) every 12 h for 3 days resulted in a significant increase (p < 0.05) in ar activity in ex vivo colon contents with a corresponding increase in ssz metabolism. similar probiotic treatment of male wistar rats (n = 8) followed by an oral 100 mg/kg dose of ssz produced high plasma levels of sp, but pharmacokinetic parameters of ssz and sp were not significantly different from control rats given ssz. these results indicate that probiotic strains possess ar activity and can metabolize ssz. treatment with probiotics increases ar activity in the gut microbiota but has no effect on plasma levels of ssz and sp following a subsequent oral dose of ssz.

AB == probiotics have been extensively studied over the past several years in the prevention and, to a larger extent, in the treatment of diarrheal diseases, especially in pediatric populations. diarrhea is a symptom, and not a disease. this review will not address chronic disorders associated with diarrhea, or clostridium difficile-induced diarrhea. rather it will focus on published clinical trials performed on acute-onset, likely infectious diarrhea occurring in the settings of day-care centers, in the community, acquired in the hospital, antibiotic-associated diarrhea, and treatment of acute infectious diarrhea. for prevention of diarrhea acquired in day-care centers, 9 randomized and placebo-controlled trials have been published, conducted in different parts of the world. probiotics tested were lactobacillus gg, bifidobacterium lactis (alone or in combination with streptococcus thermophilus, and lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus rhamnosus (not gg), and lactobacillus acidophilus, in various trials either alone or in comparison with each other. the evidence of their efficacy in these settings is only modest for the prevention of diarrhea, although somewhat better for prevention of upper respiratory infections. in the community, new trails conducted in underprivileged areas of india, again with modest efficacy. previous trials that examined the potential role of probiotics in preventing the spreading of diarrhea in hospitalized children had yielded conflicting results. more recently, a large trial in poland showed, however, rather good evidence of efficacy for lactobacillus gg. the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea has been the subject of many investigations, both in children and in adults. most commonly used probiotics were lactobacillus gg, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, bifidobacterium ssp, streptococcus ssp, and the yeast saccharomyces boulardii. in general, most of these trials do show clear evidence of efficacy, with the 2 most effective strains being lactobacillus gg and s. boulardii. evidence is also emerging on the importance of the dose in reducing the incidence of this type of diarrhea, and the incidence of clostridium difficile-associated postantibiotic diarrhea. as for treatment, a large body of data is available, especially in children, on the effect of several strains of probiotics in treating sporadic infectious diarrhea. the vast majority of the published trials show a statistically significant benefit and moderate clinical benefit of a few, well-identified probiotic strains-mostly lactobacillus gg and s. boulardii-in the treatment of acute watery diarrhea, and particularly those due to rotavirus. such a beneficial effect results, on average, in a reduction of diarrhea duration of approximately 1 day. the effect is strain-dependent and dose-dependent.

TI == a novel biosensor based on lactobacillus acidophilus for determination of phenolic compounds in milk products and wastewater.
AB == different branches of industry need to use phenolic compounds (pcs) in their production, so determination of pcs sensitively, accurately, rapidly, and economically is very important. for the sensitive determination of pcs, some biosensors based on pure polyphenol oxidase, plant tissue and microorganisms were developed before. but there has been no study to develop a microbial phenolic compounds biosensor based on lactobacillus species, which contain polyphenol oxidase enzyme. in this study, we used different forms of lactobacillus species as enzyme sources of biosensor and compared biosensor performances of these forms for determination of pcs. for this purpose, we used lyophilized lactobacillus cells (containing l. bulgaricus, l. acidophilus, streptococcus thermophilus), pure l. acidophilus, pure l. bulgaricus, and l. acidophilus- and l. bulgaricus adapted to catechol in lactobacilli mrs broth. the most suitable form was determined and optimization studies of the biosensor were carried out by using this form. for preparing the bioactive layer of the biosensor, the lactobacillus cells were immobilized in gelatin by using glutaraldehyde. in the study, we used catechol as a substrate. phenolic compound determination is based on the assay of the differences on the respiration activity of the cells on the oxygen meter in the absence and the presence of catechol. the microbial biosensor response depends directly on catechol concentration between 0.5 and 5.0 mm with 18 min response time. in the optimization studies of the microbial biosensor the most suitable microorganism amount was found to be 10 mg, and also phosphate buffer (ph 8.0; 50 mm) and 37.5 degrees c were obtained as the optimum working conditions. in the characterization studies of the microbial biosensor some parameters such as substrate specificity on the biosensor response and operational and storage stability were examine. furthermore, the determination of pc levels in synthetic wastewater, industrial wastewater, and milk products was investigated by using the developed biosensor under optimum conditions.

AB == lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus, and lactobacillus acidophilus are dairy cultures widely used in the manufacture of cultured dairy products. commonly used homogenization pressures in the dairy industry are 13.80 mpa or less. it is not known whether low homogenization pressures can stimulate bacteria to improve their probiotic characteristics. objectives were to determine the effect of homogenization at 0, 3.45, 6.90, 10.34, and 13.80 mpa on acid tolerance, bile tolerance, protease activity, and growth of l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus lb-12, s. salivarius ssp. thermophilus st-m5, and l. acidophilus la-k. the cultures were individually inoculated in cool autoclaved skim milk (4 degrees c) and homogenized for 5 continuous passes. growth and bile tolerance of samples were determined hourly for 10h of incubation. acid tolerance was determined every 20 min for 120 min of incubation. protease activity was determined at 0, 12, and 24h of incubation. all homogenization pressures studied improved acid tolerance of l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus lb-12 but had no beneficial effect on protease activity and had negative effects on growth and bile tolerance. a pressure of 6.90 mpa improved acid tolerance, bile tolerance, and protease activity of s. salivarius ssp. thermophilus st-m5, but none of the homogenization pressures studied had an effect on its growth. homogenization pressures of 13.80 and 6.90 mpa improved acid tolerance and bile tolerance, respectively, of l. acidophilus la-k but had no effect on protease activity and its growth. some low homogenization pressures positively influenced some characteristics of yogurt culture bacteria and l. acidophilus la-k. culture pretreatment with some low homogenization pressures can be recommended for improvement of certain probiotic characteristics.

TI == in vitro antimicrobial effects of commercially available mouth-wetting agents.
AB == products have been developed to provide palliation for persons with dry mouth. in addition to mouth-wetting agents, some products incorporate antimicrobial constituents with the goal of improving oral microbial defenses. the aim of this in vitro study was to investigate the potential antimicrobial and antifungal effects of two commercially available saliva substitutes on streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus acidophilus, and candida albicans by using the agar-well diffusion method. antimicrobial activity as measured by the size of the inhibition zone growth for s. mutans and l. acidophilus was observed only with biotene dry mouth oral rinse(r) and bioxtra(r) gel. the zone of inhibition of biotene dry mouth oral rinse was larger than that of bioxtra gel (p= 0.00, p < 0.01). no anticandidal effect was seen with any of the test products. the ph of the preparations, the variations between the amount of active ingredients within the products, and the potential antimicrobial effects of inactive ingredients should be investigated to determine the factors that impacted microbial inhibition.

TI == use of the checkerboard dna-dna hybridisation technique for in vivo detection of  cariogenic microorganisms on metallic brackets, with or without use of an antimicrobial agent.
AB == objective: using checkerboard dna-dna hybridisation (cddh) assay, this randomised clinical study evaluated the contamination of metallic brackets by four cariogenic bacterial strains (streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus acidophilus) and the efficacy of 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate (chx) mouthwashes in reducing bacterial contamination. methods: thirty-nine 11-33-year-old patients under treatment with fixed orthodontic appliances were enrolled in the study and had 2 new metallic brackets bonded to premolars. nineteen patients used a 0.12% chx mouthwash (periogard) and 20 patients used a placebo mouthwash (control) twice a week. after 30 days, the brackets were removed and samples were obtained for analysis by cddh. data were analysed statistically by the kruskal-wallis test (alpha=0.05) using the sas software. results: s. mutans, s. sobrinus, l. casei and l. acidophilus were detected in 100% of the samples from both groups. however, brackets of the control group were more heavily contaminated by s. mutans and s. sobrinus (p<0.01). in the experimental group, although all counts decreased after rinsing with the chlorhexidine solution, there was significant difference only for s. mutans (p=0.03). conclusions: the use of 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate mouthwashes can be useful in clinical practice to reduce the levels of cariogenic microorganisms in patients under treatment with fixed orthodontic appliances.

TI == metabolism of l-selenomethionine and selenite by probiotic bacteria: in vitro and in vivo studies.
AB == since selenium supplements have been shown to undergo biotransformation in the gut, probiotic treatment in combination with selenium supplements may change selenium disposition. we investigated the metabolism of l-selenomethionine (semet) and selenite by probiotic bacteria in vitro and the disposition of selenium after probiotic treatment followed by oral dosing with semet and selenite in rats. when semet was incubated anaerobically with individual antibiotic-resistant probiotic strains (streptococcus salivarius k12, lactobacillus rhamnosus 67b, lactobacillus acidophilus l10, and bifidobacterium lactis lafti(r) b94) at 37 degrees c for 24 h, 11-18% was metabolized with 44-80% of semet lost being converted to dimethyldiselenide (dmdse) and dimethylselenide (dmse). in similar incubations with selenite, metabolism was more extensive (26-100%) particularly by the lactobacilli with 0-4.8% of selenite lost being converted to dmse and dmdse accompanied by the formation of elemental selenium. four groups of rats (n = 5/group) received a single oral dose of either semet or selenite (2 mg selenium/kg) at the time of the last dose of a probiotic mixture or its vehicle (lyoprotectant mixture used to maintain cell viability) administered every 12 h for 3 days. another three groups of rats (n = 3/group) received a single oral dose of saline or semet or selenite at the same dose (untreated rats). serum selenium concentrations over the subsequent 24 h were not significantly different between probiotic and vehicle treated rats but appeared to be more sustained (semet) or higher (selenite) than in the corresponding groups of untreated rats. probiotic treated rats given semet also had selenium concentrations at 24 h that were significantly higher in liver and lower in kidney than untreated rats given semet. thus, treatment with probiotics followed by semet significantly affects tissue levels of selenium.

AB == this study was conducted to investigate the effects of increased dietary zno on the bacterial core and enterobacterial composition in the small intestine of piglets that were fed diets containing a total of 124 or 3,042 mg of zn per kilogram of diet, respectively. zinc was supplemented to the basal diet as zno. bacterial 16s rrna genes of ileal dna extracts were pcr-amplified with 2 bar-coded primer sets and sequenced by 454 pyrosequencing. the bacterial core species were calculated from the relative abundances of reads present in 5 of 6 samples per group and at a minimum of 5 sequences per sample. the reference database silva was used to assign sequence reads at an alignment minimum of 200 bases and 100% identity. lactic acid bacteria dominated the bacterial core, but showed diverse responses to dietary zno. of the dominant lactobacillus spp., lactobacillus reuteri was reduced due to increased dietary zno (44.7 vs. 17.9%; p=0.042), but l. amylovorus was not influenced. however, the changes of relative abundances of other lactic acid bacteria were more noteworthy; weissella cibaria (10.7 vs. 23.0%; p=0.006), w. confusa (10.0 vs. 22.4%; p=0.037), leuconostoc citreum (6.5 vs. 14.8%; p=0.009), streptococcus equinus (0.14 vs. 1.0%; p=0.044), and s. lutetiensis (0.01 vs. 0.11%; p=0.016) increased in relative abundance. nonlactic acid bacteria that were influenced by increased dietary zno included the strict anaerobic species, sarcina ventriculi, which showed a strong numerical decrease in relative abundance (14.6 vs. 5.1%). species of the enterobacteriaceae increased their relative abundance, as well as species diversity, in the high dietary zno experimental group. bacterial diversity indices were increased due to increased dietary zno (p < 0.05), which was traced back to the increase of sequences from subdominant species. increased dietary zno led to an increase of less prominent species and, thus, had a major impact on the bacterial composition and diversity in piglets. this effect may help to stabilize the intestinal microbiota in the sensitive postweaning period.

TI == the effect of a probiotic strain (lactobacillus acidophilus) on the plaque formation of oral streptococci.
AB == the objective of this study was to investigate the ability of biofilm formation among mutans and non mutans oral streptococci and to determine the effect of lactobacillus acidophilus dsm 20079 as a probiotic strain on the adhesion of selected streptococcal strains on the surfaces. the sample comprised 40 isolates of oral streptococci from dental plaque and caries of volunteer persons. streptococcus mutans atcc35668 (no24) was as an standard strain. the probiotic strain was lactobacillus acidophilus dsm 20079. the ability of biofilm formation was investigated with colorimetric method and the strongest isolates were selected. then the effect of probiotic strain on the adhesion of streptococci isolates was determined in polystyrene microtiter plate simultaneously and 30 minutes before streptococci entrance to the system. the results showed that 42% of mutans streptococci were strongly adherent (sa) and in non mutans streptococci, only 23.5% of isolates were found strongly adherent. the strong biofilm forming bacterium isolated was streptococcus mutans strain22. in the next step, in the presence of probiotic strain the streptococcal adhesion were reduced, and this reduction was non significantly stronger if the probiotic strain was inoculated to the system before the oral bacteria. the lactobacillus acidophilus had more effect on adherence of mutans streptococci than non mutans streptococci with significant difference (p < 0.05). adhesion reduction is likely due to bacterial interactions and colonization of adhesion sites with probiotic strain before the presence of streptococci. adhesion reduction can be an effective way on decreasing cariogenic potential of oral streptococci.

TI == effects of yogurt starter cultures on the survival of lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB == recognized to confer health benefits to consumers, probiotics such as lactobacillus acidophilus are commonly incorporated into fermented dairy products worldwide; among which yogurt is a popular delivery vehicle. to materialize most of the putative health benefits associated with probiotics, an adequate amount of viable cells must be delivered at the time of consumption. however, the loss in their viabilities during refrigerated storage has been demonstrated previously. this study focused on the effects of yogurt starter cultures on the survival of five strains of l. acidophilus, with emphases on low ph and acid production. differential survival behavior between l. acidophilus strains was further analyzed. to this end, viable cell counts of l. acidophilus were determined weekly during 4 degrees c storage in various types of yogurts made with streptococcus thermophilus alone, l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus alone, both species of the starter cultures, or glucono-delta-lactone (gdl). all yogurt types, except for pasteurized yogurts, were co-fermented with l. acidophilus. yogurt filtrate was analyzed for the presence of any inhibitory substance and for the amount of hydrogen peroxide. multiplication of l. acidophilus was not affected by the starter cultures as all strains reached high level on day 0 of the storage period. throughout the 28-day storage period, cell counts of l. acidophilus pim703 and sbt2062 remained steady (~6 x 10(7)cfu/g) in yogurts made with both starter cultures, whereas those of atcc 700396 and ncfm were reduced by a maximum of 3 and 4.6 logs, respectively. when starter cultures were replaced by gdl, all strains survived well, suggesting that a low ph was not a critical factor dictating their survival. in addition, the filtrate collected from yogurts made with starter cultures appeared to have higher inhibitory activities against l. acidophilus than that made with gdl. the presence of viable starter cultures was necessary to adversely affect the survival of some strains, as pasteurized yogurts had no effect on their survival. in particular, the inhibitory effect exerted by l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus on l. acidophilus ncfm was highly pronounced than by s. thermophilus, nevertheless, the same effect was not observed on sbt2062. the inhibition against stationary-phase ncfm cells might be caused by the elevated level of hydrogen peroxide produced by l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus. delineating factors driving the differences in survival trait among probiotic strains will lead to a more efficacious delivery of health benefits in fermented dairy products through targeted technological interventions.

AB == streptococcus mutans (s. mutans), harboring biofilm formation, considered as a main aetiological factor of dental caries. gtf genes play an important role in s. mutans biofilm formation. the purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of lactobacillus acidophilus-derived biosurfactant on s. mutans biofilm formation and gtfb/c expression level (s. mutans standard strain atcc35668 and isolated s. mutans strain (22) from dental plaque). the lactobacillus acidophilus (l. acidophilus) dsm 20079 was selected as a probiotic strain to produce biosurfactant. the ftir analysis of its biosurfactant showed that it appears to have a protein-like component. due to the release of such biosurfactants, l. acidophilus was able to interfere in the adhesion and biofilm formation of the s. mutans to glass slide. it also could make streptococcal chains shorter. using realtime rt-pcr quantitation method made it clear that gtfb and gtfc gene expression were decreased in the presence of l. acidophilus-derived biosurfactant fraction. several properties of s. mutans cells (the surface properties, biofilm formation, adhesion ability and gene expression) were changed after l. acidophilus- derived biosurfactant treatment. it is also concluded that biosurfacant treatment can provide an optional way to control biofilm development. on the basis of our findings, we can suggest that the prepared biosurfactant may interfere with adhesion processes of s. mutans to teeth surfaces, provided additional evaluation produce satisfactory results.

AB == human milk contains about 7% lactose and 1% human milk oligosaccharides (hmos) consisting of lactose with linked fucose, n-acetylglucosamine and sialic acid. in infant formula, galactooligosaccharides (goss) are added to replace hmos. this study investigated the ability of six strains of lactic acid bacteria (lab), lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus reuteri, streptococcus thermophilus and leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. cremoris, to digest hmo components, defined hmos, and goss. all strains grew on lactose and glucose. n-acetylglucosamine utilization varied between strains and was maximal in l. plantarum; fucose utilization was low or absent in all strains. both hetero- and homofermentative lab utilized n-acetylglucosamine via the embden-meyerhof pathway. lactobacillus acidophilus and l. plantarum were the most versatile in hydrolysing pnp analogues and the only strains releasing mono- and disaccharides from defined hmos. whole cells of all six lab hydrolysed onp-galactoside and pnp-galactoside indicating beta-galactosidase activity. high beta-galactosidase activity of l. reuteri, l. fermentum, s. thermophilus and l. mesenteroides subsp. cremoris whole cells correlated to lactose and gos hydrolysis. hydrolysis of lactose and goss by heterologously expressed beta-galactosidases confirmed that lab beta-galactosidases are involved in gos digestion. in summary, the strains of lab used were not capable of utilizing complex hmos but metabolized hmo components and goss.

TI == use of lactulose as prebiotic and its influence on the growth, acidification profile and viable counts of different probiotics in fermented skim milk.
AB == lactulose can be considered as a prebiotic, which is able to stimulate healthy intestinal microflora. in the present work, the use of this ingredient in fermented milk improved quality of skim milk fermented by lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus bulgaricus and bifidobacterium lactis in co-culture with streptococcus thermophilus. compared to control fermentations without lactulose, the addition of such a prebiotic in skim milk increased the counts of all probiotics, with particular concern to b. lactis (bifidogenic effect), the acidification rate and the lactic acid acidity, and concurrently reduced the time to complete fermentation (t(ph4.5)) and the ph at the end of cold storage for 1 to 35 days.

TI == effect of the antimicrobial decapeptide ksl on the growth of oral pathogens and streptococcus mutans biofilm.
AB == dental caries and periodontitis are common oral bacterial infectious diseases. their prevention and treatment requires control of the causative pathogens, such as streptococcus mutans and porphyromonas gingivalis, that exist within dental plaque. as one of the attractive future substitutes for conventional antibiotics, antimicrobial peptides (amps), both natural and synthetic, have been widely tested and used for controlling bacterial infections. in this study, we investigated the antimicrobial activity of ksl (kkvvfkvkfk-nh(2)), a novel amp, against several major cariogenic and periodontopathogenic bacteria as well as candida albicans in vitro. streptococcus mutans, the causative agent of dental caries, was chosen for in-depth testing. bacterial susceptibility and time-kill assays were performed to investigate the sensitivity of s. mutans to ksl. the effect of ksl on biofilm formation and on pre-formed biofilm was also examined. for biofilm studies, confocal laser scanning microscopy (clsm) was used to observe and analyse bacterial biofilm. the results showed that ksl had antimicrobial activity against a variety of oral bacteria and fungi. streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus acidophilus were the most susceptible strains to ksl peptide [minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of 0.0625 mg/ml] compared with other species tested (mics of 0.125-1mg/ml). ksl also inhibited s. mutans biofilm formation, with a minimum biofilm inhibition concentration of 0.0625-0.125 mg/ml, and reduced 1-day-old developed s. mutans biofilm, with a minimum biofilm reduction concentration of 0.25-0.5mg/ml. clsm images showed that ksl significantly reduced the viability of biofilm cells. this study suggests that ksl may have a potential clinical application in treating dental caries by killing s. mutans within dental plaque.

TI == nisin inhibits dental caries-associated microorganism in vitro.
AB == nisin, produced by lactococcus lactis, is an antibiotic peptide to effectively antagonize a broad spectrum of gram-positive bacteria, and is widely used as a safe food antimicrobial agent. in the present study, we investigated whether nisin could be used as an effective antibiotic peptide against the nine common cariogenic microorganisms, and its antimicrobial activity could be affected by the ingredients of saliva in oral cavity. in the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimal bactericide concentration (mbc) and spot-on-lawn assay, nisin displayed different mic, mbc and antimicrobial activity against the nine tested strains. there was statistical difference between the inhibitory zone diameters of nisin against the different tested bacteria (p<0.05), but no statistical difference between the inhibitory zone diameters of nisin dissolved in pbs and saliva (p>0.05). furthermore, morphology and membranes of streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus fermenti and lactobacillus acidophilus with nisin treatment were observed and showed different degrees of variation by a field emission scanning electron microscope (fe-sem). our findings suggested that nisin has considerable potential for prevention and treatment of dental caries.

TI == lactic acid fermentation of germinated barley fiber and proliferative function of colonic epithelial cells in loperamide-induced rats.
AB == to develop a functional food from the dietary fiber fraction of germinated barley (hordeum vulgare l.) (gbf), lactic acid fermentation was attempted using lactobacillus acidophilus, streptococcus thermophilus, and bifidobacterium bifidus. the quality characteristics of the lactic acid-fermented product and its effect on gastrointestinal function in an animal model were examined. the anaerobic fermentation of 1% and 2% gbf yielded lactic acid bacteria at 8.9 +/- 1.0 x 10(8) and 1.6 +/- 0.2 x 10(9) colony-forming units/ml, and it was considered acceptable for consumption by sensory assessment. to determine the effect on gastrointestinal function, sprague-dawley rats were fed with three types of diets: a normal chow diet and chow diets supplemented with 10% lactic acid bacteria or a yogurt fermented with 2% gbf (gbfy). the rats fed gbfy for 6 weeks gained less body weight, excreted more fecal mass, and had improved gastrointestinal transit as examined with barium sulfate. the effect of gbfy on colonic epithelial proliferation was investigated through loperamide (lpm)-induced constipation in rats. the rats fed with gbfy for 6 weeks were intraperitoneally administered lpm twice daily for 7 days. gbfy supplementation decreased fecal excretion and moisture content in feces and depleted goblet cells as observed by hematoxylin and eosin stain. however, the rats supplemented with gbfy prior to the lpm administration had enhanced bowel movement, mucin secretion, and production of short-chain fatty acids compared with values for the lpm-alone group. immunohistochemistry revealed that the gbfy supplement increased the numbers of nuclei stained positively for ki-67 and extended from the base to the middle zone of crypts. these results indicate that gbfy alleviates constipation via the proliferation of the colonic crypts in lpm-administered rats.

AB == dental caries in pre-school children has significant public health and health disparity implications. to determine microbial risk markers for this infection, this study aimed to compare the microbiota of children with early childhood caries with that of caries-free children. plaque samples from incisors, molars, and the tongue from 195 children attending pediatricians' offices were assayed by 74 dna probes and by pcr to streptococcus mutans. caries-associated factors included visible plaque, child age, race, and snacking habits. species were detected more frequently from tooth than tongue samples. lactobacillus gasseri (p < 0.01), lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus vaginalis, and s. mutans with streptococcus sobrinus (all p < 0.05) were positively associated with caries. by multifactorial analysis, the probiotic lactobacillus acidophilus was negatively associated with caries. prevotella nigrescens was the only species (p < 0.05) significantly associated with caries by the 'false discovery' rate. analysis of the data suggests that selected lactobacillus species, in addition to mutans streptococci, are risk markers for early childhood caries.

TI == antibacterial surface properties of fluoride-containing resin-based sealants.
AB == objectives: the aim of the present study was to determine the antibacterial properties of three resin-based pit and fissure sealant products: clinpro (3m espe), embrace (pulpdent), and ultraseal xt plus (ultradent). methods: the antibacterial effects of the sealants were tested in both an agar diffusion assay and a planktonic growth inhibition assay using streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus acidophilus. the materials were applied to paper and enamel disks in the former and on the side walls of 96-well microtiter plates on the latter. results: all materials showed either diffusible or contact antibacterial effects in the agar diffusion assays. the effect was diminished when enamel disks were used as substrate. in the planktonic growth inhibition assay, clinpro had its effect reduced, but retained activity against both bacteria over time. l. acidophilus was more sensitive than s. mutans to ultraseal. embrace retained antibacterial activity against both bacteria over time. conclusions: within the limitations of this in vitro study it can be concluded that all materials are capable of contact inhibition of l. acidophilus and s. mutans growth. embrace has the longer lasting antibacterial activity when in solution, especially against s. mutans.

TI == antibacterial activity of triclosan incorporated glass ionomer cements--an in vitro pilot study.
AB == objectives: the aim of this pilot study was to evaluate the antibacterial activity of glass ionomer cement impregnated with different concentrations (0.5%, 1.25% and 2.5%) of a non releasing bactericide--triclosan (tc) against two common cariogenic bacteria - lactobacillus acidophilus and streptococcus mutans; and to compare triclosan incorporated gic with chlorhexidine (chx) incorporated gic (2.5%) in terms of antibacterial activity. methods: chlorhexidine or triclosan were added to glass ionomer cement powder to achieve 2.5% chx--gic (positive control--group ii), 0.5%, 1.25% and 2.5% tc-gic (experimental groups iii, iv and v respectively) formulations. restorative glass ionomer cement (fuji ix gc--group i) served as negative control. the powder and liquid were mixed and inserted into the wells punched in agar plates (10 mm x 4 mm). the agar diffusion method was used to determine the antibacterial activity of the cements after 1, 7 and 30 days. mean values were compared between different study groups using one-way anova and tukey's hsd procedure at a significance level of 5%. results: triclosan incorporated gic was more effective against l. acidophilus and s. mutans than chlorhexidine incorporated gic. triclosan at a concentration of 2.5% was more effective than at lower concentrations. at all time periods studied, the maximum zone of inhibition against l. acidophilus was produced by group v. against s. mutans, on days 1, 7 and 30, there was no significant difference between groups ii and iv (p > 0.05), while the other groups showed significant differences. conclusion: the use of triclosan as an antibacterial additive in gic holds promise and further clinical research is needed in this direction.

TI == multistep mechanism of probiotic bacterium, the effect on innate immune system.
AB == the etiology and pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease are still not fully understood. however, evidence from both animal models and clinical observations suggests luminal bacteria as the most probable inducer of this disease. the intestinal bacterial microbiota may be modified by dietary addition of viable probiotic bacteria, thereby constituting an alternative approach to disease prevention and treatment. the aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the effects of two probiotic regiments; lactobacillus gg and a mixture of streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus acidophilus, and bifidobacterium lactis (yo-mix y 109 fro 1000) in both normal and trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid colitis-induced rats. colon morphology and damage were evaluated histologically; colonic tissues were used for mrna analysis, using real-time pcr. administration of both probiotics reduced the expression of proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha and il-6 and increased the expression of mucin 2 in compared with colitis group and reduced the inflammatory response. these results provide additional support for the positive effect of probiotics in the gut and may shed light on the mechanism by which probiotic bacteria exert their action in an animal model.

TI == effect of probiotic supplementation on immunoglobulins, isoagglutinins and antibody response in children of low socio-economic status.
AB == background: antigen exposure is one of the major exogenous factors modulating human immunocompetence acquisition. decline in family size and improvements in public health and hygiene in developed countries, may deprive the immune system of appropriate antigen input by diminishing infectious stimuli. probiotics are a large group of microorganisms defined by their beneficial effects on human health and with stimulating effects on different functions of the immune system. aim of the study: we conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to determine if probiotics maintain their immune-stimulating effects in a population of 162 children with a high index of natural exposure to microorganisms. children were to ingest for at least 4 months one of two products, low-fat milk fermented by streptococcus thermophilus (control product) or low-fat milk fermented by s. thermophilus and lactobacillus casei, with lactobacillus acidophilus, oligofructose and inulin added after the fermentation process (test product). according to their age, children were vaccinated with dtp-hib vaccine or a 23-valent anti-pneumococcal vaccine. results: final analysis of results was done in 70 children in each group, showing that the rate of immunoglobulin and isoagglutinin acquisition was similar in both groups. there was no difference between groups in antibody levels neither before nor after vaccination. days of fever and number of episodes of infection were not statistically different in either group. conclusions: supplementation of standard fermented milk with additional probiotics was not of benefit. the high natural rate of early microbial exposure in infants and children from a population of low socio-economic status living in a "less hygienic environment" may account for the absence of an additional immune-stimulating effect by supplementary probiotics.

AB == the effects of yeasts on the survival of probiotic and non-probiotic lactic acid  bacteria (lab) were studied in fermented milk under non-refrigerated conditions (30 degrees c) with a view to develop ambient-stable fermented milk with live lab. five yeasts tested (saccharomyces bayanus, williopsis saturnus var. saturnus, yarrowia lipolytica, candida kefyr and kluyveromyces marxianus) enhanced the survival of lactobacillus bulgaricus (but not streptococcus thermophilus) in a mixed yoghurt culture in yoghurt by approximately 10(2) to 10(5)-fold. seven yeasts examined (candida krusei, geotrichum candidum, pichia subpelliculosa, kloeckera apiculata, pichia membranifaciens, schizosaccharomyces pombe and y. lipolytica) improved the survival of lactobacillus rhamnosus in fermented milk by approximately10(3) to 10(6)-fold. w. saturnus var. saturnus enhanced the survival of lactobacillus acidophilus, l. rhamnosus (probiotic) and lactobacillus reuteri by up to 10(6)-fold, but the same yeast failed to improve the survival of lactobacillus johnsonii (probiotic), s. thermophilus and l. bulgaricus in fermented milk. these results provide definitive evidence that yeasts possess stability-enhancing effects on lab and that the specific effects of yeasts on lab stability vary with yeasts as well as with lab. however, the molecular mechanism of such interaction of yeasts with lab remains to be found.

TI == oral bacterial adhesion forces to biomaterial surfaces constituting the bracket-adhesive-enamel junction in orthodontic treatment.
AB == bacterial adhesion to biomaterial surfaces constituting the bracket-adhesive-enamel junction represents a growing problem in orthodontics, because bacteria can adversely affect treatment by causing demineralization of the enamel surface around the brackets. it is important to know the forces with which bacteria adhere to the surfaces of these junction materials, as the strength of these forces will determine how easy it will be to remove the bacteria. we compared the adhesion forces of five initially colonizing and four cariogenic strains of bacteria to an orthodontic adhesive, stainless steel, and enamel, with and without a salivary conditioning film. adhesion forces were determined using atomic force microscopy and a bacterial probe. in the absence of a salivary conditioning film, the strongest bacterial adhesion forces occurred to the adhesive surface (-2.9 to -6.9 nn), while adhesion forces to the enamel surfaces were lowest (-0.8 to -2.7 nn). in the presence of a salivary conditioning film, adhesion forces were reduced strongly, to less than 1 nn, and the differences between the various materials were reduced. generally, however, initial colonizers of dental hard surfaces presented stronger adhesion forces to the different materials (-4.7 and -0.6 nn in the absence and presence of a salivary conditioning film, respectively) than cariogenic strains (-1.8 and -0.5 nn).

AB == background: mentha longifolia l. (lamiaceae) leaves have been traditionally implemented in the treatment of minor sore throat and minor mouth or throat irritation by the indigenous people of iraq, although the compounds responsible for the medicinal properties have not been identified. in the present study, an antimicrobial compound was isolated and characterized, and its biological activity was assessed. methods: the compound was isolated and characterized from the extracted essential oil using different spectral techniques: tlc, ftir spectra and hplc. antimicrobial activity of the compound was assessed using both disc diffusion and microdilution method in 96 multi-well microtiter plates. results: a known compound was isolated from the essential oil of the plant and was identified as (-) menthol. the isolated compound was investigated for its antimicrobial activity against seven selected pathogenic and non-pathogenic microorganisms: staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus faecalis, streptococcus pyogenis, lactobacillus acidophilus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and the yeast candida albicans. menthol at different concentrations (1:1, 1:5, 1:10, 1:20) was active against all tested bacteria except for p. aeruginosa, and the highest inhibitory effect was observed against s. mutans (zone of inhibition: 25.3 mm) using the disc diffusion method. minimal inhibitory concentration mic values ranged from 15.6-125.0 microg/ml, and the most promising results were observed against s. aureus and s. mutans (mic 15.6 microg/ml) while, s. faecalis, s. pyogenis and l. acidophilus ranked next (mic 31.2 microg/ml). furthermore, menthol achieved considerable antifungal activity against the yeast c. albicans (zone of inhibition range: 7.1-18.5 mm; mic: 125.0). conclusion: the isolation of an antimicrobial compound from m. longifolia leaves validates the use of this plant in the treatment of minor sore throat and minor mouth or throat irritation.

AB == background: probiotics may protect against inflammatory bowel disease through regulation of lamina propria lymphocytes (lpls) function. data are lacking on possible involvement of intraepithelial lymphocytes (iels). the aim of this study was to investigate whether different probiotic mixtures prevented gut inflammatory disease and the role of both iels and lpls. methods: balb/c mice received 2 probiotic mixtures orally for 3 weeks, as mix1 (lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium longum), or mix2 (lactobacillus plantarum, streptococcus thermophilus, and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis). colitis was induced by intrarectal administration of trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (tnbs). probiotics in stools were analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr). colon subpopulations of iels and lpls were assayed by flow cytometry. serum cytokines were measured by cytometric bead array (cba). results: all probiotics colonized the intestine. the 2 mixtures prevented the tnbs-induced intestinal damage, and mix1 was the most effective. the mix1 protection was associated with a reduction in cd4(+) cells of iels and lpls, an increase in gammadeltat cells of iels, and a decrease in gammadeltat cells of lpls. an expansion of t regulatory (treg) cells of iels was induced by mix1 and mix2. both probiotic mixtures inhibited tumor necrosis factor (tnf)-alpha and monocyte chemotactic protein (mcp)-1 production and upregulated interleukin (il)-10. in addition, mix1 prevented the tnbs-induced increase of il-12 and interferon (ifn)-gamma. conclusions: the 2 probiotic mixtures were able to prevent the tnbs-induced colitis; the l. acidophilus and b. longum mixture was the most effective. other than an involvement of lpls, our results report a novel importance of the iels population in probiotic protection.

AB == an analysis of the peptides generated by hydrolysis of blg by nonproliferating cells of the strain lactobacillus acidophilus crl 636 was carried out. the effect of polysaccharides (pectin, and two eps synthesized by two streptococcus thermophilus strains, eps1190 and eps804) on blg digestibility using an in vitro gastric/pancreatic system was analyzed. polysaccharides are commonly used in the dairy industry to improve food texture; these hydrocolloids may interact with proteins, affecting their digestibility. nonproliferating cells of lb. acidophilus crl 636 were able to hydrolyze 52% of blg. twenty-six resulting peptides with molecular masses in the range 544-4119 da were identified by lc-ms/ms. these peptides resulted mostly from the hydrolysis of the more accessible n-terminal part of blg. degradation of blg by pepsin was poor (8%). when blg was previously hydrolyzed by lb. acidophilus crl 636, peptic hydrolysis was of 54.8%, while when pectin and eps1190 were added, hydrolysis was higher (58.2 and 57.2%, respectively). peptides crossing 8 kda dialysis membranes after trypsin/chymotrypsin hydrolysis were analyzed by hpsec. the produced peptides were smaller when blg was hydrolyzed previously by the lb. acidophilus strain. moreover, in the presence of pectin, the amount of the larger peptide (3.5 kda) observed in the size exclusion chromatograms was considerably decreased. our studies showed that prehydrolysis of blg by lb. acidophilus crl 636 had a positive influence on blg digestibility and that polysaccharides may change the peptide profile yielded by trypsin/chymotrypsin hydrolysis, releasing smaller size peptides, which are known to be less immune-reactive. moreover, lb. acidophilus crl 636 was able to hydrolyze the main epitopes (41-60, 102-124, and 149-162) of blg, reducing its allergenic content.

AB == lactobacillus acidophilus la-5 is a probiotic strain used in dairy products. production of bacteriocin by l. acidophilus la-5 was achieved when it was grown in co-cultures with the yogurt starter species streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. however, bacteriocin induction was not observed when heat-killed cells were used as inducers. this study demonstrates that l. acidophilus la-5 produces lactacin b and that the bacteriocin expression is controlled by an auto-induction mechanism involving the secreted peptide ip_1800. the transcript level of the lactacin b gene cluster expression was investigated in co-cultures between l. acidophilus la-5 and s. thermophilus sty-31 and a remarkable increase of the bacteriocin structural gene (lbab) transcription was observed. however, lbab was transcribed constitutively in uninduced l. acidophilus la-5 cells, but the levels of the secreted bacteriocin were not enough to be detected by the agar diffusion assay. a new method for bacteriocin detection was formulated based on the monitoring on real time of lactobacillus sakei subsp. sakei growth in presence of the supernatant and the cell wall extracts of pure and induced l. acidophilus la-5. these results showed that part of lactacin b secreted remains adhered to cell envelope.

AB == dental caries is one of the most common diseases in humans. in modern times, it has reached epidemic proportions. dental caries is an infectious microbiologic disease of the teeth that results in localized dissolution and destruction of the calcified tissue. dental caries is a mulitifactorial disease, which is caused by host, agent, and environmental factors. the time factor is important for the development and progression of dental caries. a wide group of microorganisms are identified from carious lesions of which s. mutans , lactobacillus acidophilus , and actinomyces viscosus are the main pathogenic species involved in the initiation and development of dental caries. in india, surveys done on school children showed caries prevalence of approximately 58%. surveys among the u.s. population showed an incidence of 45.3% in children and 93.8% in adults with either past or present coronal caries. huge amounts of money and time are spent in treating dental caries. hence, the prevention and control of dental caries is the main aim of public health, eventually the ultimate objective of public health is the elimination of the disease itself. recently, dental caries vaccines have been developed for the prevention of dental caries. these dental caries vaccines are still in the early stages.

TI == prediction of surface exposed proteins in streptococcus pyogenes, with a potential application to other gram-positive bacteria.
AB == the in silico prediction of bacterial surface exposed proteins is of growing interest for the rational development of vaccines and in the study of bacteria-host relationships, whether pathogenic or host beneficial. this interest is driven by the increase in the use of dna sequencing as a major tool in the early characterization of pathogenic bacteria and, more recently, even of complex ecosystems at the host-environment interface in metagenomics approaches. current protein localization protocols are not suited to this prediction task as they ignore the potential surface exposition of many membrane-associated proteins. therefore, we developed a new flow scheme, surfg+, for the processing of protein sequence data with the particular aim of identification of potentially surface exposed (pse) proteins from gram-positive bacteria, which was validated for streptococcus pyogenes. the results of an exploratory case study on closely related lactobacilli of the acidophilus group suggest that the yogurt bacterium lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (l. bulgaricus) dedicates a relatively important fraction of its coding capacity to secreted proteins, while the probiotic gastrointestinal (gi) tract bacteria l. johnsonii and l. gasseri appear to encode a larger variety of pse proteins, that may play a role in the interaction with the host.

AB == the simultaneous effects of different binary co-cultures of lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus bulgaricus, lactobacillus rhamnosus and bifidobacterium lactis with streptococcus thermophilus and of different prebiotics on the production of fermented milk were investigated in this paper. in particular, we determined and compared the kinetics of acidification of milk either as such or supplemented with 4% (w/w) maltodextrin, oligofructose and polydextrose, as well as the probiotic survival, chemical composition (ph, lactose, lactic acid and protein contents), fatty acids profile and conjugate linoleic acid (cla) content of fermented milk after storage at 4 degrees c for 24 h. fermented milk quality was strongly influenced both by the co-culture composition and the selected prebiotic. depending on the co-culture, prebiotic addition to milk influenced to different extent kinetic acidification parameters. all probiotic counts were stimulated by oligofructose and polydextrose, and among these b. lactis always exhibited the highest counts in all supplemented milk samples. polydextrose addition led to the highest post-acidification. although the contents of the main fatty acids were only barely influenced, the highest amounts of conjugated linoleic acid (38% higher than in the control) were found in milk fermented by s. thermophilus-l. acidophilus co-culture and supplemented with maltodextrin.

TI == comparison of the antibacterial activity of different self-etching primers and adhesives.
AB == aim: the aim of this study was to evaluate the antibacterial effects of different one-step and two-step self-etching primer/adhesives on streptococcus mutans (s. mutans), lactobacillus casei (l. casei), and lactobacillus acidophilus (l. acidophilus). methods and materials: the antibacterial effects of clearfil protect bond primer and bonding agent; adhese primer and bonding agent; adper prompt l-pop; futurabond nr; clearfil tri s bond; and cervitec (positive control, 1% chlorhexidine varnish) were tested against standard strains of s. mutans, l. casei, and l. acidophilus using the disk diffusion method. standard filter paper disks (n=5) impregnated with 20 microl of each material were prepared. after incubation at 37 masculinec for 48 hours in a 5-10% co2 atmosphere, the diameter of inhibition zones were measured in millimeters. data were analyzed using one way analysis of variance (anova) and multivariate analysis of variance (manova). duncan's multiple range test was used for pairwise comparison. results: the size of inhibition zones produced by primer/adhesives varied among the brands. adhese primer: s. mutans (20.6+/-1.51); l. casei (14.8+/-1.78); l. acidophilus (11.4+/-0.54). adper prompt l-pop: s. mutans (19.6+/-1.51); l. casei (13.8+/-1.64); l. acidophilus (13.8+/-1.09). cervitec: s. mutans (23+/-0.00); l. casei (27+/-0.70); l. acidophilus (22.4+/-0.54). clearfil protect bond primer: s. mutans (17+/-0.00); l. casei (17.6+/-0.54); l. acidophilus (22.4+/-0.54). futurabond nr was found effective only against s. mutans (14.6+/-1.67). of all the materials tested, adhese bonding agent, clearfil protect bond bonding agent, and clearfil tri s bond exhibited no inhibition zone (-) for all bacteria tested. conclusion: among the adhesives tested clearafil protect bond primer based upon monomer methacryloyloxydodecylpyridiniium bromide (mdpb) was found to be the most potent material against l. acidophilus and l. casei. adhese primer and adper prompt l-pop are highly effective against s. mutans. clinical significance: compared with other adhesive systems, clearfil protect bond primer (containing mdpb) showed a high antibacterial effect against all microorganizms tested. two-step, self-etching primer/adhesive system clearfil protect bond might be a suitable choice under minimally invasive restorations. the recently developed one-step, self-etching system clearfil tri s bond showed no antibacterial effect against microorgazims tested.

TI == utilization of monolinolein as a substrate for conjugated linoleic acid production by bifidobacterium breve lmc 520 of human neonatal origin.
AB == this study was designed to isolate bifidobacteria from human intestines that efficiently converts monolinolein, a monoglyceride form of linoleic acid, into conjugated linoleic acid (cla), as well as to optimize culture conditions for improving cla production during milk fermentation. among 150 screened neonatal bifidobacteria, bifidobacterium breve lmc 520 showed the highest cla-producing ability and was tested with different types of fat substrates at various concentrations to determine the optimal conditions for cla production. monolinolein was tested as a substrate for cla production. the incubation time optimized for cla production was 24 h, and cla production was proportionally increased with monolinolein concentration. the incubation of lmc 520 with commercial starter strains caused minimal reduction in cla production. our results demonstrate that the cla-producing ability of b. breve lmc 520 could offer beneficial effects when utilized as a starter culture for the development of functional dairy products.

TI == mlpa diagnostics of complex microbial communities: relative quantification of bacterial species in oral biofilms.
AB == a multitude of molecular methods are currently used for identification and characterization of oral biofilms or for community profiling. however, multiplex pcr techniques that are able to routinely identify several species in a single assay are not available. multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (mlpa) identifies up to 45 unique fragments in a single tube pcr. here we report a novel use of mlpa in the relative quantification of targeted microorganisms in a community of oral microbiota. we designed 9 species specific probes for: actinomyces gerencseriae, actinomyces naeslundii, actinomyces odontolyticus, candida albicans, lactobacillus acidophilus, rothia dentocariosa, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguinis and veillonella parvula; and genus specific probes for selected oral streptococci and lactobacilli based on their 16s rdna sequences. mlpa analysis of dna pooled from the strains showed the expected specific mlpa products. relative quantification of a serial dilution of equimolar dna showed that as little as 10 pg templates can be detected with clearly discernible signals. moreover, a 2 to 7% divergence in relative signal ratio of amplified probes observed from normalized peak area values suggests mlpa can be a cheaper alternative to using qpcr for quantification. we observed 2 to 6 fold fluctuations in signal intensities of mlpa products in dnas isolated from multispecies biofilms grown in various media for various culture times. furthermore, mlpa analyses of dna isolated from saliva obtained from different donors gave a varying number and intensity of signals. this clearly shows the usefulness of mlpa in a quantitative description of microbial shifts.

TI == characterization of the amylovorin locus of lactobacillus amylovorus dce 471, producer of a bacteriocin active against pseudomonas aeruginosa, in combination with colistin and pyocins.
AB == lactobacillus amylovorus dce 471 produces amylovorin l, a bacteriocin with an antibacterial activity against some strains of the lactobacillus lineage. based on the sequence of one active peptide, a gene encoding active amylovorin l was cloned and sequenced. genome walking allowed us to sequence a larger fragment of 7577 bp of genomic dna, with 12 predicted orfs. the previously characterized amylovorin l peptide-encoding gene is preceded by another gene encoding a small polypeptide with a typical bacteriocin-processing double-glycine site, suggesting that amylovorin l is a two-component class iib bacteriocin (amylovorin lalpha/beta). lalpha and lbeta show the highest similarity to gassericin t from lactobacillus gasseri sbt2055 and blpn from streptococcus pneumoniae r6, respectively, and to lafa and lafx, which form the lactacin f bacteriocin of lactobacillus johnsonii ncc 533. as for other lactic acid bacteria bacteriocins, amylovorin l showed no activity against the gram-negative opportunistic pathogen pseudomonas aeruginosa on its own, but showed synergistic inhibitory activity when used in combination with the peptide antibiotic colistin, and, remarkably, with the p. aeruginosa soluble bacteriocins, pyocins s1 and s2.

TI == probiotic use in the critically ill.
AB == probiotics are "live microbes which when administered in adequate amounts confer  a health benefit to the host" (fao/who joint group). their potential role in bio-ecological modification of pathological internal milieu of the critically ill is under evaluation. probiotics are available as single microbial strain (e.g., bacillus clausii, lactobacillus) or as a mix of multiple strains of lactobacillus (acidophilus, sporogenes, lactis, reuteri rc-14, gg, and l. plantarum 299v), bifidobacterium (bifidum, longum, infantis), streptococcus (thermophillus, lactis, fecalis), saccharomyces boulardii etc. lactobacilli and bifidobacteria are gram-positive, anaerobic, lactic acid bacteria. these are normal inhabitant of human gut and colonize the colon better than others. critical illness and its treatment create hostile environment in the gut and alters the micro flora favoring growth of pathogens. therapy with probiotics is an effort to reduce or eliminate potential pathogens and toxins, to release nutrients, antioxidants, growth factors and coagulation factors, to stimulate gut motility and to modulate innate and adaptive immune defense mechanisms via the normalization of altered gut flora. scientific evidence shows that use of probiotics is effective in prevention and therapy of antibiotic associated diarrhea. however, available probiotics strains in currently used doses do not provide much needed early benefits, and need long-term administration to have clinically beneficial effects (viz, a reduction in rate of infection, severe sepsis, icu stay, ventilation days and mortality) in critically ill surgical and trauma patients. possibly, available strains do not adhere to intestinal mucosa early, or may require higher dose than what is used. gap exists in our knowledge regarding mechanisms of action of different probiotics, most effective strains--single or multiple, cost effectiveness, risk-benefit potential, optimum dose, frequency and duration of treatment etc. more information is needed on safety profile of probiotics in immunocompromised state of the critically ill in view of rare reports of fungemia and sepsis and a trend toward possible increase in nosocomial infection. at present, despite theoretical potential benefits, available evidence is not conclusive to recommend probiotics for routine use in the critically ill.

TI == strong antibacterial effect of miswak against oral microorganisms associated with periodontitis and caries.
AB == background: the chewing stick (miswak) is used for oral hygiene in many parts of  the world. in addition to the mechanical removal of plaque, an antibacterial effect has been postulated; however, tests of miswak extract from salvadora persica (arak) disclosed only low to moderate antibacterial effects. this may be attributable to the extraction process. our aim was to test in vitro the antibacterial effect of miswak pieces, without extraction, on bacteria implicated in the etiology of periodontitis and caries. methods: miswak pieces were standardized by size and weight (0.07 and 0.14 g) and tested against streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus acidophilus, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), porphyromonas gingivalis, and, as a reference, haemophilus influenzae. the miswak pieces were tested in two ways: embedded in the agar plate or suspended above the agar plate. results: the inhibitory effect was most pronounced on p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, and h. influenzae, less on s. mutans, and least on l. acidophilus. suspended miswak had comparable or stronger effects than miswak embedded in agar. the 0.14-g suspended miswak exhibited significantly greater inhibition on a. actinomycetemcomitans and h. influenzae than the 0.14-g miswak embedded in agar (p<0.01 and p<0.001, respectively). conclusions: miswak embedded in agar or suspended above the agar plate had strong antibacterial effects against all bacteria tested. the antibacterial effect of suspended miswak pieces suggests the presence of volatile active antibacterial compounds.

TI == therapeutic potential of two probiotics in inflammatory bowel disease as observed in the trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid model of colitis.
AB == purpose: the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease is thought to be a multifactorial process. one of the leading hypotheses is that an imbalance in normal gut flora induces an excessive immune response and contributes to inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract. administration of probiotic bacteria reduces symptoms in patients suffering from inflammatory bowel diseases, probably via both manipulation of the microflora and stimulation of the intestinal immune system. in the current study the therapeutic potential of two different probiotics-lactobacillus gg and a mixture of streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus acidophilus, and bifidobacterium longum (yo-mix y 109 fro 1000)--in a rat model of colitis were evaluated. methods: male wistar rats were administered probiotics for three days simultaneously with colitis induction. colonic damage was evaluated histologically and biochemically and colonic tissues, as well as fecal samples, were used for bacterial studies using 16s rrna gene primers. results: probiotics administration reduced the relative amounts of the pathogenic bacteria aeromonas and escherichia coli in the colonic tissue. however, whereas both probiotics affected colon morphology, only lactobacillus gg administration reduced myeloperoxidase activity. conclusions: we report the therapeutic rather than preventive potential of two different probiotics in an animal model of colitis.

TI == influence of human dentine on the antibacterial activity of self-etching adhesive systems against cariogenic bacteria.
AB == objectives: the incorporation of antibacterial agents into adhesive systems has been proposed to eliminate residual bacteria from dentine. this study used the agar diffusion method to evaluate the antibacterial activity of clearfil protect bond (cpb), clearfil se bond (cseb), clearfil tri-s bond (c3sb) and xeno-iii (xiii) self-etching adhesive systems, with or without light-activation, against cariogenic bacteria, and to assess the influence of human dentine on the antibacterial activity of these materials. methods: an aliquot of 10 microl per material (and individual components) were pipetted onto paper and dentine discs distributed in petri dishes containing bacterial culture in bhi agar. positive control was 0.2% chlorhexidine digluconate (chx). results: after incubation, the adhesive components of cpb and cseb, liquid a of xiii and c3sb did not present antibacterial activity when applied to paper discs. the non-light-activated cpb primer+adhesive promoted the greatest inhibition of streptococcus mutans (p<0.05), whereas with light-activation, there was no significant difference between primer+adhesive and primer alone. for lactobacillus acidophilus, cpb primer presented the greatest antibacterial activity in both light-activation conditions (p<0.05). regarding the dentine discs, only chx promoted an inhibitory effect, though less intense than on paper discs (p<0.05). chx presented greater antibacterial activity against s. mutans than against l. acidophilus (p<0.05). conclusions: light-activation significantly reduced the antibacterial activity of the self-etching adhesive systems; mdpb incorporation contributed to the effect of adhesive systems against cariogenic bacteria; the components eluted from the adhesive systems were not capable to diffuse through 400 microm-thick dentine disc to exert their antibacterial activity against cariogenic bacteria.

TI == 16s ribosomal rna-based methods to monitor changes in the hindgut bacterial community of piglets after oral administration of lactobacillus sobrius s1.
AB == 16s ribosomal rna (rrna) gene based pcr/denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) and real-time pcr were used to monitor the changes in the composition of microbiota in the hindgut of piglets after oral administration of lactobacillus sobrius s1. six litters of neonatal piglets were divided randomly into control group and treatment group. at 7, 9, and 11 days of age, piglets in the treatment group orally received a preparation of l. sobrius s1. at 7, 14, 21(weaning), 24, and 35 days of age, one piglet from each litter was sacrificed and digesta samples of hindgut were collected. dgge analysis of 16s rrna gene v6-v8 region for all bacteria showed that several populations present in the hindgut of piglets, represented by far-migrating bands, disappeared after weaning. most of these bands corresponded to lactobacillus spp. as revealed by sequence analysis. quantitative real-time pcr specific for lactobacilli further demonstrated that the number of lactobacilli population tended to decrease after the piglets were weaned. drastic changes of l. amylovorus and l. sobrius in total lactobacillus populations were also observed in the colon of piglets around weaning, as monitored by 16s rrna gene v2-v3 region based lactobacillus-specific pcr-dgge. species-specific real-time pcr also revealed that the population of l. sobrius declined apparently in the colon of piglets after weaning. no remarkable changes in the overall microbial community in the hindgut were found between control and treatment groups. however, comparison of dgge profiles between the two groups revealed a specific band related to clostridium disporicum that was found in treatment group on day 14. on day 35, a specific band appeared only in the control group, representing a population most closely related to streptococcus suis (99%). real-time pcr showed that l. sobrius 16s rrna gene copies in treatment group were relatively higher than in the control group (10(8.45) vs. 10(6.83)) on day 35, but no significant difference was observed between the two groups.

TI == long-term antibacterial effects and physical properties of a chlorhexidine-containing glass ionomer cement.
AB == statement of the problem: many regions in the world do not have electricity, water, or access to dental facilities that allows the treatment of caries with dental handpieces and rotary burs. for restorative techniques used in these regions, an antibacterial self-adherent glass ionomer material would contribute considerably. purpose: this study aimed to test if chlorhexidine diacetate (fluka biochemika, buchs, switzerland)- or chlorhexidine digluconate (sigma-aldrich, steinheim, germany)-added chemfil superior glass ionomer cement (dentsply detrey, konstanz, germany) had any long-term antibacterial effect against certain oral bacteria and to test the new formulation's physical properties. materials and methods: chemfil superior was used as a control. chlorhexidine diacetate (powder) was added to the powder and chlorhexidine digluconate (liquid) was mixed with the powder in order to obtain 0.5, 1.25, and 2.5% concentrations of the respective groups. setting time, compressive strength, and acid erosion were tested according to iso 9917-1. working time, hardness, diametral tensile strength, and biaxial flexural strength were also determined. long-term antimicrobial activity against s. mutans, l. acidophilus, and c. albicans were tested with the agar diffusion method. analysis of variance (anova) was used for comparison (p < 0.05). results: regarding the immediate antibacterial effect for s. mutans, all the tested groups showed inhibitions of the strain compared with the control group (p < 0.05), with larger zones for the higher concentration groups and all the diacetates. for l. acidophilus, all the groups were effective compared with the control, but the greatest antibacterial effect was observed with the 2.5% diacetate group. the 2.5% group of chlorhexidine diacetate showed antibacterial activity up to 90 days against s. mutans and up to 60 days against l. acidophilus. the working and setting time, acid erosion test, diametral tensile strength, and biaxial flexural strength of the tested groups were not different from the control chemfil group. however, the 1.25 and 2.5% groups of chlorhexidine diacetate had significantly lower compressive strengths than the control group. lower hardness values were obtained with the 0.5 and 2.5% chlorhexidine digluconate groups in comparison with the control group. clinical significance: the results of this in vitro investigation demonstrated that chlorhexidine diacetate or digluconate added to the chemfil superior glass ionomer material can exhibit long-term antibacterial effects against s. mutans and l. acidophilus without compromising the physical properties of the material.

TI == probiotic crescenza cheese containing lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus acidophilus manufactured with high-pressure homogenized milk.
AB == high-pressure homogenization (hph) is one of the most promising alternatives to traditional thermal treatment of food preservation and diversification. its effectiveness on the deactivation of pathogenic and spoilage microorganisms in model systems and real food is well documented. to evaluate the potential of milk treated by hph for the production of crescenza cheese with commercial probiotic lactobacilli added, 4 types of cheeses were made: hph (from hph-treated milk), p (from pasteurized milk), hph-p (hph-treated milk plus probiotics), and p-p (pasteurized milk plus probiotics) cheeses. a strain of streptococcus thermophilus was used as starter culture for cheese production. compositional, microbiological, physicochemical, and organoleptic analyses were carried out at 1, 5, 8, and 12 d of refrigerated storage (4 degrees c). according to results obtained, no significant differences among the 4 cheese types were observed for gross composition (protein, fat, moisture) and ph. differently, the hph treatment of milk increased the cheese yield about 1% and positively affected the viability during the refrigerated storage of the probiotic bacteria. in fact, after 12 d of storage, the lactobacillus paracasei a13 cell loads were 8 log cfu/ g, whereas lactobacillus acidophilus h5 exhibited, in p-p cheese, a cell load decrease of about 1 log cfu/g with respect to the hph-p cheese. the hyperbaric treatment had a significant positive effect on free fatty acids release and cheese proteolysis. also, probiotic cultures affected proteolytic and lipolytic cheese patterns. no significant differences were found for the sensory descriptors salty and creamy among hph and p cheeses as well as for acid, piquant, sweet, milky, salty, creamy, and overall acceptance among hph, hph-p, and p-p crescenza cheeses.

AB == an in vitro plaque model based on the use of human salivary bacteria and tooth-like surfaces was previously developed for studying the formation of oral biofilm and its use for pre-clinical testing of candidate antimicrobial or antiplaque agents. in this study, a quantitative taqman pcr assay (qpcr) was developed to compare the bacterial compositions of in vitro biofilms to parent saliva samples, and to determine the relative contributions of different species in the formation of the oral biofilm. in addition, the growth inhibition of saliva-derived plaque was evaluated by chlorhexidine. with this assay, which consisted of primer/probe sets targeting either 16s rdna sequences present in public databases or cloned ribosomal intergenic spacer region (isr) sequences, 15 oral bacteria derived from saliva as well as those that were responsible for biofilm formation in an in vitro plaque model were rapidly identified and quantified. among the target organisms were actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, lactobacillus acidophilus, micromonas micros, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, tannerella forsythensis, and veillonella parvula. primer and probe sets developed were both sensitive and specific. the relative profiles of a number of bacteria in 45-h-old biofilms were determined and, when compared to saliva samples, it was found that most of the bacteria identified in saliva also populated the in vitro plaque, including some anaerobes. brief exposure of biofilms to chlorhexidine resulted in significant losses in viability. this new broad spectrum qpcr assay in combination with the in vitro plaque model will be of significant value in the quantitative study of the microbial composition of human saliva, saliva-derived plaque, and pre-clinical evaluation of potential antimicrobial and antiplaque molecules.

AB == carcinogenesis of squamous cell carcinomas in the upper aero-digestive tract (uadt) is a multi-stage process. since 1937, micronuclei (mn) have been considered a marker for genome damage in the initiation stage. by help of the micronucleus test, carcinogenic exposure can be proven in the mucosa area of the uadt. the hypothesis to be tested was that individual oral hygiene and the dental status, respectively - just like alcohol and tobacco abuse - are associated with the micronucleus rate in cytological preparations of the buccal mucosa. in a prospective clinical observation study, we determined in 100 probands the micronucleus frequency per 1000 mucosa epithelial cells. study participants with a high number of missing teeth (m/t index, p=0.037), a below-average papillary bleeding index (pbi, p=0.032) and periodontal status, respectively (psi, p=0.042) possessed a higher micronucleus number in comparison with restored dental conditions. probands with composite restorations displayed a higher mn rate (p=0.006) compared to those with amalgam. however, we could not detect any significant relation with the prosthetic status (p> or =0.075). an adjustment was made according to alcohol and tobacco. we therefore conclude that subgingival plaque and synthetic dental materials in addition to chronic alcohol and tobacco consumption might have genotoxic relevance in the oral cavity.

AB == in vivo dental plaque biofilms consist of complex communities of oral bacteria that are a challenge to replicate in vitro. the aim of this investigation was to establish human dental plaque microcosms in microplates to reflect conditions that are relevant to dental caries. microcosm plaque biofilms were initiated from the saliva of two different donors, grown for up to 10 days in 24-welled microplates on thermanox coverslips in various types of artificial saliva with and without sucrose, which were replaced daily. microbiota composition of 40 species associated with oral health and dental caries was monitored in the plaques using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization analysis. ph was measured as an indicator of cariogenic potential. the composition of the saliva inocula was different, and yielded plaque microcosms with different composition and growth responses to sucrose. artificial saliva type and presence of sucrose, and the resulting growth and ph conditions, modified the growth of individual species and hence the ecological profile of the microplate plaques during development. complex population shifts were observed during development, and older plaques comprised predominantly facultative anaerobic species. sucrose supplementation limited the decline of streptococci over time but did not increase the abundance of mutans streptococci. sucrose at 0.15% increased levels of caries-associated species including lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus acidophilus and actinomyces gerensceriae; these were further increased with sucrose at 0.5%, in addition to actinomyces israelii, rothia dentocariosa and capnocytophaga gingivalis. the microplate plaques demonstrated complex community dynamics that appeared to reflect the maturation of natural plaques, and sucrose induced a cariogenic plaque composition and ph.

TI == [changes of bacterial flora from hindguts of piglets after oral administration of lactobacillus amylovorus s1 as a probiotic strain].
AB == changes of bacterial flora from hindguts of piglets from 7 to 35 days of age (two weeks after weaning) were studied after oral administration of l. amylovorus s1, using molecular techniques based on 16s rdna gene. six litters of neonatal piglets were divided randomly into control group and treatment group. at 7, 9, 11 days of age, piglets in treatment group received 1, 2 and 3ml preparation of s1 (5 x 10(9) cfu/ml) through oral administration, respectively. on d 7, 14, 21, 24 and 35, one piglet from each litter was slaughtered and samples of hindguts were collected for analysis. the results showed that high g + c mol% bacteria in hindguts of piglets disappeared after weaning and restored gradually two weeks later. sequencing analysis indicated that most of these high g + c mol% bacteria blonged to lactobacillus spp. . statistical analysis showed that treatment with s1 had no marked effect on diversity index of predominant bacteria from hindguts in piglets. by comparing the bands in dgge profiles between two groups, a specific band in treatment group was found in profiles from piglets at 14 days of age, sequence matched with that showed 95 % similarity to clostridium disporicum. at 35 days of age, another specific band appeared in control group, which was identified to be streptococcus suis (99% ).

TI == spotlight on vsl#3 probiotic mixture in chronic inflammatory bowel diseases.
AB == vsl#3 (vsl#3) is a high-concentration probiotic preparation of eight live freeze-dried bacterial species that are normal components of the human gastrointestinal microflora, including four strains of lactobacilli (lactobacillus casei, l. plantarum, l. acidophilus, and l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus), three strains of bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium longum, b. breve, and b. infantis), and streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus. data from noncomparative trials suggest that vsl#3 has clinical potential in the treatment of active mild to moderate ulcerative colitis and as maintenance therapy for patients with ulcerative colitis in remission. in addition, a randomized, open-label, multicenter trial showed that vsl#3 in combination with low-dose balsalazide (a prodrug of mesalazine [mesalamine; 5-aminosalicylic acid]) was more effective than standard doses of basalazide or mesalazine monotherapy in the treatment of acute mild to moderate ulcerative colitis. randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies have shown vsl#3 is effective in preventing the onset of acute pouchitis in patients with newly formed surgical pouches, and in maintaining remission following antibacterial treatment of acute pouchitis in patients with a history of refractory or recurrent pouchitis. treatment guidelines from the us and the uk include vsl#3 as a therapeutic option for the prevention of pouchitis relapse in patients with chronic pouchitis. in general, vsl#3 was well tolerated in clinical trials. large, well designed, controlled confirmatory clinical trials will further determine the place of vsl#3 in the treatment of ulcerative colitis.

TI == production of yoghurt with mild taste by a lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus mutant with altered proteolytic properties.
AB == in this communication, we describe the isolation of a lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus 92063 mutant strain named ph-p11, which differed from the parent strain by low proteolytic activity and altered regulation of expression of lacz in the presence of glucose or lactose. in the presence of lactose, beta-galactosidase activity was approximately twice as high in ph-p11 than in the wild type. ph-p11 exhibited protosymbiosis together with streptococcus thermophilus. yoghurt produced with ph-p11 was characterized by low acidity and little post-acidification during storage. the organoleptic properties (absence of bitterness and other off-flavors, weak sourness, and clear yoghurt taste) were those of a typical "yoghurt mild". this mild flavor was achieved at rather high cell counts of lactobacilli even at the end of shelf-life. high cell counts in conjunction with high beta-galactosidase activity make ph-p11 an interesting strain for application in yoghurt especially designed for consumers with lactose malabsorption. in contrast to "yoghurt mild", which is predominantly produced with lactobacillus acidophilus together with streptococcus thermophilus, the product obtained by fermentation with ph-p11 and streptococcus thermophilus concurs with international standards for yoghurt. during frequent sub-culturing, strain ph-p11, which is supposed to differ from the wild type by one or a few so-far-not-characterized mutations, showed sufficient stability for application in industrial production.

TI == antibiotic resistance of lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacterium spp. isolated from dairy and pharmaceutical products.
AB == the outlines of antibiotic resistance of some probiotic microorganisms were studied. this study was conducted with the double purpose of verifying their ability to survive if they are taken simultaneously with an antibiotic therapy and to increase the selective properties of suitable media for the isolation of samples containing mixed bacterial populations. we isolated from commercial dairy and pharmaceutical products, 34 strains declared as probiotics, belonging to the genera bifidobacterium and lactobacillus, and 21 strains of starter culture bacteria. all the microorganisms have been compared by electrophoresis of the soluble proteins for the purpose of identifying them. a multiplex-pcr with genus- and species-specific primers was used to detect for bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis presence. all bifidobacteria were b. animalis subsp. lactis except one bifidobacterium longum. sometimes the identification showed that the used strain was not the one indicated on the label. the lactobacilli were lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. the streptococci were all streptococcus thermophilus. the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) of 24 common antibiotic substances has been valued by the broth microdilution method. all tested strains were susceptible to ampicillin, bacitracin, clindamycin, dicloxacillin, erytromycin, novobiocin, penicillin g, rifampicin (mic(90) ranging from 0.01 to 4 microg/ml); resistant to aztreonam, cycloserin, kanamycin, nalidixic acid, polymyxin b and spectinomycin (mic(90) ranging from 64 to >1000 microg/ml). the susceptibility to cephalothin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, lincomycin, metronidazole, neomycin, paromomycin, streptomycin, tetracycline and vancomycin was variable and depending on the species.

TI == incipient caries lesions on cementum by mono- and co-culture oral bacteria.
AB == objectives: there is increasing prevalence of root caries. we hypothesized different biofilms will cause varying demineralization in cementum. this study investigated the extent of demineralization of cementum by oral biofilm formed from three major cariogenic microorganisms: streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus acidophilus, and actinomyces israelii. sound cementum tooth blocks were incubated with mono-, bi-, and tri-species combinations of the bacteria under investigation. materials and methods: the matrix (amide i) and phosphate content of the lesions was analyzed by fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (ftir), and calcium and phosphorus levels were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive spectroscopy (sem-edx). results: the log[amide i:hpo(4)(2-) absorbance] values showed that a. israelii mono-culture caused significantly more demineralization than the other bacterial cultures. log[ca:p] showed that all carious lesions were confined to the cementum. conclusions: oral biofilm arising from bacterial species a. israelii alone was the most cariogenic of those tested and produced the most demineralization in incipient carious lesions in cementum.

TI == characterization of lactic acid bacteria and other gut bacteria in pigs by a macroarraying method.
AB == lactic acid bacteria (lab) consist of many genera, gram-positive, and nonspore-forming micro-organisms; some members being used as probiotics while some others have negative effects on pig health. bacterial species in the gastrointestinal tract can produce antibacterial substances, reduce serum cholesterol in their host, or can be responsible for growth reduction, diarrhea, and intestinal epithelial damage. it is therefore important for the pig industry to evaluate the impact of food and farm management on the presence of "good" or "bad" bacteria and the risk for consumers. this articles focuses on the molecular identification of gut microflora species following different diets given to pigs in uk and correlating the data on growth, health, and welfare. first of all, pig feces were individually collected from sows before and after farrowing and also from piglets before and after weaning over several months. bacteria colonies were grown on mrs agar plates from feces and dna was extracted (qiaamp dna stool kit) and amplified using 16s rdna (27f and 519r) primers. dna sequencing and sequence alignment allowed us to identify species-specific zones, which were used as probes in a macroarray system also known as reverse line blot hybridization. some probes were found to be species specific for the following species: lactobacillus acidophilus, l. animalis, l. gallinarum, l. kitasanotis, l salivarius, streptococcus alactolyticus, s. hyointestinalis, and sarcina ventriculi. actual studies are now focusing on the impact of diets of the microflora in different gut parts and at different stages of the animal's life.

TI == antimicrobial effect of acidified nitrate and nitrite on six common oral pathogens in vitro.
AB == background: salivary nitrate is positively correlated with plasma nitrate and its level is 9 times the plasma level after nitrate loading. nitrate in saliva is known to be reduced to nitrite by oral bacteria. nitrate and nitrite levels in saliva are 3 - 5 times those in serum in physiological conditions respectively in our previous study. the biological functions of high salivary nitrate and nitrite are still not well understood. the aim of this in vitro study was to investigate the antimicrobial effects of nitrate and nitrite on main oral pathogens under acidic conditions. methods: six common oral pathogens including streptococcus mutans nctc 10449, lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4646, porphyromonas gingivalis atcc 33277, capnocytophaga gingivalis atcc 33624, fusobacterium nucleatum atcc 10953, and candida albicans atcc 10231 were cultured in liquid medium. sodium nitrate or sodium nitrite was added to the medium to final concentrations of 0, 0.5, 1, 2, and 10 mmol/l. all of the microorganisms were incubated for 24 to 48 hours. the optical densities (od) of cell suspensions were determined and the cultures were transferred to solid nutrient broth medium to observe the minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal/fungicidal concentration for the six tested pathogens. results: nitrite at concentrations of 0.5 to 10 mmol/l had an inhibitory effect on all tested organisms at low ph values. the antimicrobial effect of nitrite increased with the acidity of the medium. streptococcus mutans nctc 10449 was highly sensitive to nitrite at low ph values. lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4646 and candida albicans atcc 10231 were relatively resistant to acidified nitrite. nitrate at the given concentrations and under acidic conditions had no inhibitory effect on the growth of any of the tested pathogens. conclusion: nitrite, at a concentration equal to that in human saliva, is both cytocidal and cytostatic to six principal oral pathogens in vitro, whereas nitrate at a similar concentration has no antimicrobial effect on these organisms.

TI == probiotics and commensals reverse tnf-alpha- and ifn-gamma-induced dysfunction in human intestinal epithelial cells.
AB == background & aims: commensal bacteria are crucial for the development of the mucosal immune system. probiotics are commensals with special characteristics and may protect mucosal surfaces against pathogens. pathogens cause significant phenotypic alterations in infected epithelial cells, and probiotics reverse these deleterious responses. we hypothesized that probiotics and/or commensals may also reverse epithelial damage produced by cytokines. methods: human intestinal epithelial cells were exposed basolaterally to interferon (ifn)-gamma (10(3) u/ml) or tumor necrosis factor (tnf)-alpha (10 ng/ml) for up to 48 hours and assessed for ion transport, transepithelial resistance (ter), and epithelial permeability in the presence or absence of probiotics (streptococcus thermophilus [st] and lactobacillus acidophilus [la]), or the commensal, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (bt). results: agonist-stimulated chloride secretion was inhibited by ifn-gamma, an effect prevented by st/la or bt. the ability of st/la or bt to restore cl(-) secretion was blocked by inhibitors of p38 mapk, erk1, 2, and pi3k. the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (cftr) and the nkcc1 cotransporter were down-regulated by ifn-gamma, and st/la pretreatment reversed this effect. both tnf-alpha and ifn-gamma significantly reduced ter and increased epithelial permeability, effects prevented by st/la or bt. a janus kinase (jak) inhibitor synergistically potentiated effects of st/la or bt on ter and permeability, but p38, erk1, 2, or pi3k inhibition did not. finally, only probiotic-treated epithelial cells exposed to cytokines showed reduced activation of socs3 and stat1,3. conclusions: deleterious effects of tnf-alpha and ifn-gamma on epithelial function are prevented by probiotic, and to a lesser extent, commensal pretreatment. these data extend the spectrum of effects of such bacteria on intestinal epithelial function and may justify their use in inflammatory disorders.

TI == anticariogenic activity of macelignan isolated from myristica fragrans (nutmeg) against streptococcus mutans.
AB == the occurrence of dental caries is mainly associated with oral pathogens, especially cariogenic streptococcus mutans. preliminary antibacterial screening revealed that the extract of myristica fragrans, widely cultivated for the spice and flavor of foods, possessed strong inhibitory activity against s. mutans. the anticariogenic compound was successfully isolated from the methanol extract of m. fragrans by repeated silica gel chromatography, and its structure was identified as macelignan by instrumental analysis using 1d-nmr, 2d-nmr and ei-ms. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of macelignan against s. mutans was 3.9 microg/ml, which was much lower than those of other natural anticariogenic agents such as 15.6 microg/ml of sanguinarine, 250 microg/ml of eucalyptol, 500 microg/ml of menthol and thymol, and 1000 microg/ml of methyl salicylate. macelignan also possessed preferential activity against other oral microorganisms such as streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sanguis, lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus casei in the mic range of 2-31.3 microg/ml. in particular, the bactericidal test showed that macelignan, at a concentration of 20 microg/ml, completely inactivated s. mutans in 1 min. the specific activity and fast-effectiveness of macelignan against oral bacteria strongly suggest that it could be employed as a natural antibacterial agent in functional foods or oral care products.

AB == conventional multivariate statistical techniques (hierarchical cluster analysis,  linear discriminant analysis) and unsupervised (kohonen self organizing map) and supervised (bayesian network) artificial neural networks were compared for as tools for the classification and identification of 352 sds-page patterns of whole cell proteins of lactic acid bacteria belonging to 22 species of the genera lactobacillus, leuconostoc, enterococcus, lactococcus and streptococcus including 47 reference strains. electrophoretic data were pre-treated using the logistic weighting function described by piraino et al. [piraino, p., ricciardi, a., lanorte, m. t., malkhazova, i., parente, e., 2002. a new procedure for data reduction in electrophoretic fingerprints of whole-cell proteins. biotechnol. lett. 24, 1477-1482]. hierarchical cluster analysis provided a satisfactory classification of the patterns but was unable to discriminate some species (leuconostoc, lb. sakei/lb. curvatus, lb. acidophilus/lb. helveticus, lb. plantarum/lb. paraplantarum, lc. lactis/lc. raffinolactis). a 7x7 kohonen self-organizing map (ksom), trained with the patterns of the reference strains, provided a satisfactory classification of the patterns and was able to discriminate more species than hierarchical cluster analysis. the map was used in predictive mode to identify unknown strains and provided results which in 85.5% of cases matched the classification obtained by hierarchical cluster analysis. two supervised tools, linear discriminant analysis and a 23:5:2 bayesian network were proven to be highly effective in the discrimination of sds-page patterns of lc. lactis from those of other species. we conclude that data reduction by logistic weighting coupled to traditional multivariate statistical analysis or artificial neural networks provide an effective tool for the classification and identification of lactic acid bacteria on the basis of sds-page patterns of whole cell proteins.

TI == modulation of antibody-mediated immune response by probiotics in chickens.
AB == probiotic bacteria, including lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium bifidum, have been shown to enhance antibody responses in mammals. the objective of this study was to examine the effects of a probiotic product containing the above bacteria in addition to streptococcus faecalis on the induction of the chicken antibody response to various antigens, both systemically and in the gut. the birds received probiotics via oral gavage and subsequently were immunized with sheep red blood cells (srbc) and bovine serum albumin (bsa) to evaluate antibody responses in serum or with tetanus toxoid (tt) to measure the mucosal antibody response in gut contents. control groups received phosphate-buffered saline. overall, bsa and srbc induced a detectable antibody response as early as week 1 postimmunization (p.i.), which lasted until week 3 p.i. probiotic-treated birds had significantly (p <or= 0.001) more serum antibody (predominantly immunoglobulin m [igm]) to srbc than the birds that were not treated with probiotics. however, treatment with probiotics did not enhance the serum igm and igg antibody responses to bsa. immunization with tt resulted in the presence of specific iga and igg antibody responses in the gut. again, treatment with probiotics did not change the level or duration of the antibody response in the gut. in conclusion, probiotics enhance the systemic antibody response to some antigens in chickens, but it remains to be seen whether probiotics have an effect on the generation of the mucosal antibody response.

AB == objectives: to assess antimicrobial activities of aqueous crude khat (catha edulis) extracts against a panel of oral microorganisms and to test their ability to modify bacterial resistance to tetracycline and penicillin in vitro. design: lyophilized aqueous extracts were prepared from three khat cultivars. the agar dilution method of the nccls was used to test the extracts, at concentrations of 20-1.25 mg/ml, against 33 oral strains. mic was defined as the lowest concentration at which there was no visible growth. slight growth was defined as marked growth reduction (mgr). the e-test was used to determine the mics of tetracycline and penicillin-g for three resistant strains in absence and presence of a sub-mic of the khat extracts (5mg/ml). results: eighteen strains (55%) were sensitive to the extracts (mics 5-20 mg/ml). most of these were periodontal pathogens with porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythensis being the most susceptible (mic 5-10mg/ml). veillonella parvula, actinomyces israelii and some streptococci were not sensitive. except for lactobacillus acidophilus that showed mgr at 1mg/ml, cariogenic species were neither sensitive. the extracts were active against streptococcus pyogenes (mic 10-20 mg/ml) but not against candida albicans and staphylococcus aureus. the presence of the khat extracts at a sub-mic resulted in a 2-4-fold potentiation of the tested antibiotics against the resistant strains. conclusions: khat has water-soluble constituents possessing selective antibacterial activity against oral bacteria. there is preliminary evidence for presence of an antibiotic resistance-modifying component. further investigation is needed to identify the active components and assess their clinical relevance.

TI == oral lactobacilli in chronic periodontitis and periodontal health: species composition and antimicrobial activity.
AB == background/aims: lactobacilli are known to play an important role in the maintenance of health by stimulating natural immunity and contributing to the balance of microflora. however, their role in chronic periodontitis is unclear. we aimed to identify oral lactobacilli in chronic periodontitis and periodontally healthy subjects, and to determine their antimicrobial activity against putative oral pathogens. methods: a total of 238 lactobacillus isolates from the saliva and subgingival sites of 20 chronic periodontitis and 15 healthy subjects were collected. in all, 115 strains were identified using rapid amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis. antimicrobial activity against streptococcus mutans, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia was assessed. results: lactobacilli belonging to 10 species were identified. the most prevalent strains in healthy persons were lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus fermentum and in chronic periodontitis patients, lactobacillus plantarum. obligately homofermentatives, particularly l. gasseri, were less prevalent in chronic periodontitis patients compared with healthy subjects (8% vs. 64% for l. gasseri, p < 0.01). sixty-nine percent of tested lactobacilli inhibited s. mutans, 88% a. actinomycetemcomitans, 82% p. gingivalis and 65% p. intermedia. the strongest antimicrobial activity was associated with lactobacillus paracasei, l. plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, and lactobacillus salivarius. the strains from periodontally healthy patients showed a lower antimicrobial activity against s. mutans than the strains from chronic periodontitis patients. conclusion: the composition of oral lactoflora in chronic periodontitis and healthy subjects differs, with a higher prevalence of homofermentative lactobacilli, particularly l. gasseri, in the latter group. both homo- and heterofermentative oral lactobacilli suppress the growth of periodontal pathogens, but the antimicrobial properties are strain, species and origin specific.

TI == effects of yeasts and bacteria on the levels of folates in rye sourdoughs.
AB == fermentation of rye dough is often accompanied with an increase in folate content. in this study, three sourdough yeasts, candida milleri cbs 8195, saccharomyces cerevisiae ts 146, and torulaspora delbrueckii ts 207; a control, baker's yeast s. cerevisiae alko 743; and four lactobacillus spp., l. acidophilus tsb 262, l. brevis tsb 307, l. plantarum tsb 304, and l. sanfranciscensis tsb 299 originally isolated from rye sourdough were examined for their abilities to produce or consume folates. the microorganisms were grown in yeast extract-peptone-d-glucose medium as well as in small-scale fermentations that modelled the sourdough fermentation step used in rye baking. total folate contents were determined using lactobacillus rhamnosus (atcc 7469) as the growth indicator organism. the microorganisms studied did not excrete folates into the media in significant amounts. yeasts increased the folate contents of sterilised rye flour-water mixtures from 6.5 microg/100 g to between 15 and 23 microg/100 g after 19-h fermentation, whereas lactic acid bacteria decreased it to between 2.9 and 4.2 microg/100 g. strains of lactobacillus bulgaricus, l. casei, l. curvatus, l. fermentum, l. helveticus, pediococcus spp., and streptococcus thermophilus that were also tested gave folate contents after fermentation that varied between 2 and 10.4 microg/100 g. although the four lactobacillus spp. from sourdough consumed folates their effect on folate contents in co-cultivations was minimal. it was concluded that the increase of folate content during fermentation was mainly due to folate synthesis by yeasts. fermentation of non-sterilised flour-water mixtures as such resulted in three-fold increases in the folate contents. two folate producing bacteria were isolated from the non-sterilised flour and identified as enterobacter cowanii and pantoea agglomerans.

AB == background: patients with inflammatory bowel disease have a 10- to 100-fold increased risk of nephrolithiasis, with enteric hyperoxaluria being the major risk factor for these and other patients with fat malabsorptive states. endogenous components of the intestinal microflora can potentially limit dietary oxalate absorption. methods: ten patients were studied with chronic fat malabsorption, calcium oxalate stones, and hyperoxaluria thought to be caused by jejunoileal bypass (1) and roux-en-y gastric bypass surgery for obesity (4), dumping syndrome secondary to gastrectomy (2), celiac sprue (1), chronic pancreatitis (1), and ulcerative colitis in remission (1). for 3 months, patients received increasing doses of a lactic acid bacteria mixture (oxadrop), vsl pharmaceuticals), followed by a washout month. twenty-four-hour urine collections were performed at baseline and after each month. results: mean urinary oxalate excretion fell by 19% after 1 month (1 dose per day, p < 0.05), and oxalate excretion remained reduced by 24% during the second month (2 doses per day, p < 0.05). during the third month on 3 doses per day oxalate excretion increased slightly, so that the mean was close to the baseline established off treatment. urinary oxalate again fell 20% from baseline during the washout period. calcium oxalate supersaturation was reduced while on oxadrop, largely due to the decrease in oxalate excretion, although mean changes did not reach statistical significance. conclusion: manipulation of gastrointestinal (gi) flora can influence urinary oxalate excretion to reduce urinary supersaturation levels. these changes could have a salutary effect on stone formation rates. further studies will be needed to establish the optimal dosing regimen.

TI == antimicrobial activity and tightness of a dcpd-cao-based hydraulic calcium phosphate cement for root canal filling.
AB == calcium hydroxide is currently used in dentistry for endodontic treatments where  its main advantage is its antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activity. however, it also has some drawbacks such as pulp necrosis, slight solubility, slow and insufficient hardening, and retraction on drying. in consequence, it is used only as temporary material for root canal disinfection. by mixing calcium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (cahpo4 . 2h2o, also called dicalcium phosphate dihydrate, dcpd) and calcium oxide with a sodium phosphate buffer as liquid phase, we obtained a cpc with better mechanical properties than calcium hydroxide pastes. the setting reaction produced either hydroxyapatite (ha) or a mixture of ha and calcium hydroxide depending on the relative masses of dcpd and cao in the cement powder. the presence of calcium hydroxide a priori confers antimicrobial properties to this cement which were investigated in agar plates (diffusion method) against streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus acidophilus, candida albicans, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus hominis (clinical isolates), and a preparation of polymicrobial flora isolated from dental plaque. the cement samples tested were prepared at molar calcium-to-phosphate ratios (ca/p) of 1.67 to 2.75. a pure calcium hydroxide paste was used as reference material. clear and reproducible bacterial growth inhibition was observed for cement samples with ca/p > or = 2 against all the microorganisms tested. with ca/p = 2.5, this cement alkalinizes dentinal tubules and provides a fluid-tight sealing that well compares with sealing obtained using a zinc oxide-eugenol cement without gutta-percha point. dcpd-cao-based cement is therefore a potential root canal filler.

AB == dietary doses of 2,500 ppm zno-zn reduced bacterial activity (atp accumulation) in digesta from the gastrointestinal tracts of newly weaned piglets compared to that in animals receiving 100 ppm zno-zn. the amounts of lactic acid bacteria (mrs counts) and lactobacilli (rogosa counts) were reduced, whereas coliforms (macconkey counts) and enterococci (slanetz counts, red colonies) were more numerous in animals receiving the high zno dose. based on 16s rrna gene sequencing, the colonies on mrs were dominated by three phylotypes, tentatively identified as lactobacillus amylovorus (otu171), lactobacillus reuteri (otu173), and streptococcus alactolyticus (otu180). the colonies on rogosa plates were dominated by the two lactobacillus phylotypes only. terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis supported the observations of three phylotypes of lactic acid bacteria dominating in piglets receiving the low zno dose and of coliforms and enterococci dominating in piglets receiving the high zno dose. dietary doses of 175 ppm cuso(4)-cu also reduced mrs and rogosa counts of stomach contents, but for these animals, the numbers of coliforms were reduced in the cecum and the colon. the influence of zno on the gastrointestinal microbiota resembles the working mechanism suggested for some growth-promoting antibiotics, namely, the suppression of gram-positive commensals rather than potentially pathogenic gram-negative organisms. reduced fermentation of digestible nutrients in the proximal part of the gastrointestinal tract may render more energy available for the host animal and contribute to the growth-promoting effect of high dietary zno doses. dietary cuso(4) inhibited the coliforms and thus potential pathogens as well, but overall the observed effect of cuso(4) was limited compared to that of zno.

AB == the effect of probiotic cultures over known populations of staphylococcus aureus  inoculated in yogurt was studied; also the production and stability of its thermonuclease during yogurt storage was evaluated. in three different occasions, two different yogurt brands, one with additional probiotic cultures (lactobacillus casei and l. acidophilus), were inoculated with known populations of s. aureus in high and low concentration (10(9) cfu/g and 10(7) cfu/g), respectively. these samples were stored for 28 days at 5 degrees c. every four days the count of lactic bacteria, s. aureus and ph were evaluated, according to the methodology described in the compendium of methods for the microbiological examination of foods, vanderzant & splittstoesser. the presence of thermonuclease was determined using petrifilm for s. aureus from 3m company. the ph and lactic bacteria population were constant during the testing period. yogurt with additional probiotic cultures (high and low concentration) lowered the population of s. aureus to non detectable levels in 8 days; but, s. aureus could be cultured from yogurt without probiotics even after 24 days of incubation. same time, the presence of thermonuclease was positive in all tests; it was not affected by probiotics. the presence of thermonuclease is related to the production of s. aureus enterotoxin. this work emphasizes again the beneficial effects of probiotic cultures in yogurt over bacteria and the importance of keeping hygienic practices in order to avoid the contamination of food with s. aureus and the eventual production of its enterotoxin, since it is not affected by probiotics.

TI == influence of dentin on the effectiveness of antibacterial agents.
AB == the influence of dentin on the effectiveness of three antibacterial agents (triclosan, glutaraldehyde, naocl) on streptococcus mutans, s. sobrinus, and lactobacillus acidophilus was tested using the agar diffusion method with and without bovine dentin discs (200 mum and 500 mum thickness) placed between bacteria and test substances. the effect of 0.3% triclosan on all tester strains (100%) was reduced after passage through 500 mum dentin discs to 0% (l. acidophilus) and to 22% and 28% (s. mutans and s. sobrinus). seal&protect (dentsply, konstanz, germany), a triclosan containing dental bonding agent, produced inhibition zones only against s. mutans, but no zone when applied on 200 mum dentin discs. the inhibition zones for 1% naocl and 5% glutaraldehyde against all tester strains were significantly increased up to 230% (glutaraldehyde) and 236% (naocl) when applied on dentin discs, compared to direct application (100%). dentin may either decrease or increase the inhibitory effect of antibacterial agents.

AB == background: cecropin-xj belongs to cecropin-b, which is the most potent antibacterial peptide found naturally. the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of cecropin-xj on growth and adherence of oral cariogenic bacteria. methods: four oral cariogenic bacteria (streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus acidophilus, actinomyces viscosus and actinomyces naeslundii) were chosen for this experiment. the minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) and reductive percent of bacterial growth were used to assay the antibacterial activity of cecropin-xj. mammalian cytotoxicity of cecropin-xj was tested with human periodontal membrane fibroblasts by tetrazolium (mtt) colorimetric assay. the bacterial morphological changes induced by cecropin-xj were examined on scanning electron microscope (sem). the influence of cecropin-xj on bacterial adhesion to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite (s-ha) was measured by scintillation counting. results: the mics of cecropin-xj for inhibition of the growth of four bacteria ranged from 4.0 to 42.8 micromol/l with the highest susceptible to a. naeslundii and the lowest susceptible to l. acidophilus. at ph 6.8, 5.5 and 8.2, 1/2 mic of cecropin-xj reduced the number of viable bacteria by 40.9%, 67.8% and 32.8% for s. mutans and by 28.1%, 57.2% and 37.9% for l. acidophilus. the activities against s. mutans and l. acidophilus increased at ph 5.5 compared with ph 6.8 (p < 0.01, respectively). in present of 50% saliva, 1/2 mic of the peptide decreased the direct count of viable cells by 29.2% and 14.4% for s. mutans and l. acidophilus, respectively (p < 0.01 and p > 0.05, respectively), whereas almost no reduction counts were detected in the presence of 20% serum for both bacteria (p > 0.05, respectively). mammalian cytotoxicity of cecropin-xj from 1.0 to 100 micromol/l exhibited no cytotoxicity against human periodontal membrane fibroblasts (p > 0.05). bacterial morphological changes induced by mic of cecropin-xj examined on sem showed cell surface disruption. furthermore, the ability of a. naeslundii adhesion to s-ha decreased significantly with mic of cecropin-xj for 10 and 20 minutes (p = 0.001 and 0.000, respectively), and s. mutans, a. viscosus to s-ha decreased significantly with mic of cecropin-xj for 20 minutes (p = 0.000, respectively). conclusions: cecropin-xj exhibited bactericidal action against cariogenic pathogens, and the antibacterial activity enhanced in the acid environment. the results also demonstrate that cecropin-xj prevents s. mutans and actinomyces adsorption to s-ha. these findings suggest that cecropin-xj may have potential to prevent caries.

TI == coaggregation profiles of the microflora from root surface caries lesions.
AB == bacterial coaggregation reactions between different species and the auto aggregation of the same species are associated with the initiation and development of dental plaque and biofilms. as no such data is available on isolates from root caries lesions, we evaluated, by a visual, semi-quantitative scoring system and a spectrophotometric, quantitative assay, the coaggregation of 22 different wild-type microbial species comprising ten bacterial genera and a single candida spp. the quantitative coaggregation assay we used proved to be a more sensitive method than the semi-quantitative, visual evaluation as the results yielded the percent coaggregation. fusobacterium nucleatum, lactobacillus acidophilus, streptococcus bovis ii/2 and gemella morbillorum were observed having higher degrees of autoaggregation than the other examined strains. significant levels of inter-species coaggregation was seen between: (1) actinomyces spp. and veillonella spp.; (2) actinomyces israelii and peptostreptococcus prevotii; (3) campylobacter gracilis and actinomyces spp.; (4) prevotella intermedia and nine different species; and (5) fusobacterium nucleatum and six other species. the single candida albicans isolate did not coaggregate to a significant extent with any of the 21 bacterial isolates studied. scanning electron microscopy observation of the coaggregation interactions between bacterial pairs having strong coaggregation reactions revealed varying adhesive patterns. our findings on coaggregation amongst these isolates imply existence of multiple interactions between the coaggregation-inducing bacterial species in root caries. in particular, actinomyces spp., veillonella spp., prevotella spp. and fusobacterium spp. appear to play a significant role in this context.

TI == study of a hydraulic calcium phosphate cement for dental applications.
AB == calcium phosphate-based cements (cpcs) have attracted much interest because of their good osteoconductivity for bone reconstruction. we obtained cpcs by mixing calcium bis-dihydrogenophosphate monohydrate (mcpm) and calcium oxide with water or sodium phosphate buffers (nap) as liquid phase. cement samples with different calcium-to-phosphate ratios (ca/p), liquid-to-powder ratios (l/p) and liquid phases were analyzed by x-rays diffraction (xrd), ph-metry, extensometry and calorimetry. antibacterial activity on two bacterial strains (streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus acidophilus) and a polycontaminated bacterial inoculum was also studied using the agar diffusion method. the best mechanical properties (approximately 25 mpa) corresponded to ca/p ratios between 1.67 and 2.5, a 1 m sodium phosphate buffer ph 7, as liquid phase and a l/p ratio of 0.6ml g(-1). the final setting time increased with the ca/p ratio. the setting expansion, around 1-2%, depended on the ca/p and l/p ratios. the inner temperature of the cements rose to 45 degrees during setting then decreased rapidly. the injectability was 100% up to 3.5 min and then decreased. it increased with increasing the l/p ratio but to the detriment of the compressive strength and setting time. xrd analysis indicated that the setting reaction led to a mixture of calcium hydroxide and calcium-deficient hydroxyapatite even for a ca/p ratio of 1.67. consequently, the ph of the surrounding fluids rose to 11.5-12 during their dissolution. bacterial growth inhibition was only clearly observed for ca/p>or=2. this bioactive calcium phosphate cement can potentially be employed for pulp capping and cavity lining as classical calcium hydroxide-based cements, but it is not usable, in the present formulation, for root canal filling because of its short setting time.

TI == expression of a heterologous manganese superoxide dismutase gene in intestinal lactobacilli provides protection against hydrogen peroxide toxicity.
AB == in living organisms, exposure to oxygen provokes oxidative stress. a widespread mechanism for protection against oxidative stress is provided by the antioxidant enzymes: superoxide dismutases (sods) and hydroperoxidases. generally, these enzymes are not present in lactobacillus spp. in this study, we examined the potential advantages of providing a heterologous sod to some of the intestinal lactobacilli. thus, the gene encoding the manganese-containing sod (soda) was cloned from streptococcus thermophilus ao54 and expressed in four intestinal lactobacilli. a 1.2-kb pcr product containing the soda gene was cloned into the shuttle vector ptrk563, to yield psoda, which was functionally expressed and complemented an escherichia coli strain deficient in mn and fesods. the plasmid, psoda, was subsequently introduced and expressed in lactobacillus gasseri nck334, lactobacillus johnsonii nck89, lactobacillus acidophilus nck56, and lactobacillus reuteri nck932. molecular and biochemical analyses confirmed the presence of the gene (soda) and the expression of an active gene product (mnsod) in these strains of lactobacilli. the specific activities of mnsod were 6.7, 3.8, 5.8, and 60.7 u/mg of protein for l. gasseri, l. johnsonii, l. acidophilus, and l. reuteri, respectively. the expression of s. thermophilus mnsod in l. gasseri and l. acidophilus provided protection against hydrogen peroxide stress. the data show that mnsod protects cells against hydrogen peroxide by removing o(2)(.-) and preventing the redox cycling of iron. to our best knowledge, this is the first report of a soda from s. thermophilus being expressed in other lactic acid bacteria.

AB == the first step in the origination of caries is the formation of a dental plaque.  dental caries can lead to destruction of enamel and dentin resulting in bacterial invasion of the pulp. invasion of the pulp and the periapical areas can promote the development of dento-alveolar abscess and spread of the infection to other anatomical areas. several oral acid producing aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, including streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus acidophilus, and actinomyces viscosus, are capable of initiating the carious lesion. the organisms that predominate in pulpitis and dento-alveolar abscess are prevotella, porphyromonas, fusobacterium, and peptostreptococcus spp. treatment of caries involves removal of all affected tooth structure and proper replacement with a restorative material. once pulpitis has developed the infected tissue should be removed and root canal therapy instituted, or the tooth should be extracted. extraction, root canal therapy and/or drainage of pus usually are indicated for an abscess. antimicrobial therapy supplementing the dental care should be considered, especially when local or systemic spread of the infection is suspected. penicillin or amoxicillin are generally effective against most of the aerobic and anaerobic bacteria recovered. the patient whose oral cavity may harbor penicillin-resistant organisms should be considered for treatment with drugs effective against these organisms. these agents include amoxicillin-clavulanate, clindamycin or the combination of metronidazole plus amoxicillin or a macrolide.

AB == the aim of this study was to compare the in vitro microbial leakage in 4 micro-hybrid composites in combination with 4 single-component dental adhesives (scotchbond 1/z100 mp = group 1; syntac single-component/tetric flow = group 3; optibond solo/xrv herculite = group 5; solobond m/arabesk top = group 7) and 4 multi-component dental adhesives (scotchbond multi-purpose/z100 mp = group 2; syntac/tetric flow = group 4; optibond fl/xrv herculite = group 6; solobond plus/arabesk top = group 8). ninety-four mixed standardized class v cavities of human caries-free extracted premolars were filled with eight different composite adhesive systems using a one-layer (groups 1-4) or a two-layer technique (groups 5-8). after thermocycling and incubation in a broth culture of streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus acidophilus, followed by decalcification and staining, the extent and the type of microbial leakage were measured histologically. the extent of microbial leakage in the composite restorations was very low in all groups and there were no significant differences between adhesives. z100 mp in combination with single- and multi-component adhesives showed a significantly higher microbial leakage than tetric flow systems (u test: p=0.037). xrv herculite adhesive systems showed significantly less extensive microbial leakage than arabesk top adhesive systems (u test: p<0.001). the single-component dental adhesives achieved a marginal adaptation of composites comparable to that of multi-component adhesives in vitro.

AB == the effect of probiotic cultures over listeria monocytogenes during the production and storage of yogurt was evaluated. a yogurt mixture (10.6% non-fat solid liquids, 3% fat and 0.3% gelatin) was prepared, homogenized and pasteurized. yogurt was inoculated with 0, 10(2), 10(4) and 10(6) cfu/ml of l. monocytogenes and 0.02% of traditional lactic culture yc 180 (streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus bulgaricus) and probiotic culture aby-1 (bifidobacterium longum, b. bifidum, b, infantis, lactobacillus acidophilus, streptococcus thermophilus y lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus). it was incubated for 3 h at 43 degrees c until ph reached an approximate value of 4.8, followed by refrigeration at 5 degrees c for 21 days. during fermentation, samples were taken every hour, and during storage every 3 days, analyzing ph and lactic, bifidobacteria and pathogen count for each time. it was demonstrated that there was no significant simple effect for the type of culture used (aby-1 and yc 180) (p = 0.684) over the amount of l. monocytogenes present in yogurt during the fermentation and storage periods. the presence of bifidobacteria in the aby-1 culture did not present a significant effect over l. monocytogenes. neither the effect of time presented a significant effect over l. monocytogenes (p = 0.448). in this case, the aby-1 and yc 180 cultures present a bacteriostatic effect over the pathogen. the probiotic cultures had a bacteriostatic but not bactericidal effect over l. monocytogenes. this is not related to the protective effect of these cultures in bowel, since in-vivo conditions favor the production of antimicrobial substances, such as bacteriocins that act over pathogens.

TI == functional and comparative genomic analyses of an operon involved in fructooligosaccharide utilization by lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB == lactobacillus acidophilus is a probiotic organism that displays the ability to use prebiotic compounds such as fructooligosaccharides (fos), which stimulate the growth of beneficial commensals in the gastrointestinal tract. however, little is known about the mechanisms and genes involved in fos utilization by lactobacillus species. analysis of the l. acidophilus ncfm genome revealed an msm locus composed of a transcriptional regulator of the laci family, a four-component atp-binding cassette (abc) transport system, a fructosidase, and a sucrose phosphorylase. transcriptional analysis of this operon demonstrated that gene expression was induced by sucrose and fos but not by glucose or fructose, suggesting some specificity for nonreadily fermentable sugars. additionally, expression was repressed by glucose but not by fructose, suggesting catabolite repression via two cre-like sequences identified in the promoter-operator region. insertional inactivation of the genes encoding the abc transporter substrate-binding protein and the fructosidase reduced the ability of the mutants to grow on fos. comparative analysis of gene architecture within this cluster revealed a high degree of synteny with operons in streptococcus mutans and streptococcus pneumoniae. however, the association between a fructosidase and an abc transporter is unusual and may be specific to l. acidophilus. this is a description of a previously undescribed gene locus involved in transport and catabolism of fos compounds, which can promote competition of beneficial microorganisms in the human gastrointestinal tract.

AB == the growth of streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus paracasei was studied in a ph-auxostat. the computer-controlled smooth change of ph or temperature was used to study the effect of ph and temperature on the culture characteristics (specific growth rate mu growth yield y(atp) and specific lactate production rate q(atp)). the behaviour of mu and q(atp) with an increase of temperature suggested that atp production capacity was an important factor in determining the maximum growth rate of lactic acid bacteria (lab). the decrease of y(atp) with increase of temperature resulted in the decrease of specific growth rate while q(atp) remained constant or even increased. with the decrease of ph, decrease of both y(atp) and q(atp) was observed. s. thermophilus st20 having the highest maximum specific growth rate of 2.2 h(-1) at 44 degrees c was the most acid sensitive strain. the l. paracasei e1h3 having the lowest mu(max) was the most tolerant strain to ph change. the behaviour of mixed culture of l. bulgaricus and s. thermophilus in milk in a ph-auxostat with ph-decrease was in agreement with the pure culture experiments of the same species. the study showed that ph-auxostat with smooth controlled change of ph and temperature is an effective method for determination of technological characteristics and comparative physiological study of lab.

TI == live probiotics protect intestinal epithelial cells from the effects of infection with enteroinvasive escherichia coli (eiec).
AB == background: the colonic epithelium maintains a life long reciprocally beneficial  interaction with the colonic microbiota. disruption is associated with mucosal injury. aims: we hypothesised that probiotics may limit epithelial damage induced by enteroinvasive pathogens, and promote restitution. methods: human intestinal epithelial cell lines (ht29/cl.19a and caco-2) were exposed to enteroinvasive escherichia coli (eiec 029:nm), and/or probiotics (streptococcus thermophilus (st), atcc19258, and lactobacillus acidophilus (la), atcc4356). infected cells and controls were assessed for transepithelial resistance, chloride secretory responses, alterations in cytoskeletal and tight junctional proteins, and responses to epidermal growth factor (egf) stimulation. results: exposure of cell monolayers to live st/la, but not to heat inactivated st/la, significantly limited adhesion, invasion, and physiological dysfunction induced by eiec. antibiotic killed st/la reduced adhesion somewhat but were less effective in limiting the consequences of eiec invasion of cell monolayers. furthermore, live st/la alone increased transepithelial resistance, contrasting markedly with the fall in resistance evoked by eiec infection, which could also be blocked by live st/la. the effect of st/la on resistance was accompanied by maintenance (actin, zo-1) or enhancement (actinin, occludin) of cytoskeletal and tight junctional protein phosphorylation. st/la had no effect on chloride secretion by themselves but reversed the increase in basal secretion evoked by eiec. eiec also reduced the ability of egf to activate its receptor, which was reversed by st/la. conclusions: live st/la interact with intestinal epithelial cells to protect them from the deleterious effect of eiec via mechanisms that include, but are not limited to, interference with pathogen adhesion and invasion. probiotics likely also enhance the barrier function of naive epithelial cells not exposed to any pathogen.

TI == influence of the oral administration of lactic acid bacteria on iga producing cells associated to bronchus.
AB == intestinal, respiratory and genitourinary mucosal surfaces are the most important routes of entry for microbial pathogens. the stimulus of the mucosal immunity is not easy because the trigger keys for the activation do not follow the ones of the systemic immune response. in previous works we have demonstrated that some lactic acid bacteria (lab), when orally administered, can induce an enhance of the gut immune response. taking into account the concept of a common mucosal response, we studied the effect of orally administered mice with lactobacillus casei, l. acidophilus, l. rhamnosus, l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and lactococcus lactis on the iga secreting cells associated to bronchus. as shown before, oral immunostimulation with lab induced an increase of the iga* cells at intestinal level by a dose depending effect. in this study it is also showed that the lab assayed, with exception of l. acidophilus, were able to enhance iga+ cells at bronchial level, being also this effect dose dependent. the increment induced by some lab in the number of iga+ cells on the mucosa surface of the lower respiratory tract may be very important to prevent bronchus diseases.

TI == intestinal pathway of internalisation of lactic acid bacteria and gut mucosal immunostimulation.
AB == the induction of the gut mucosal immune response is dependent on the antigen interacting with the m cells of peyer's patches and with the immune cells associated with this lymphoid organ. in previous studies we showed that the mucosal immunostimulation by lab varied depending upon the strain being studied. some of them increased the inflammatory immune response and others enhanced the level of secretory antibody (s-iga). our aim was to determine the pathway of the internalisation of lab strains in the intestine, to provide a basis for understing the different behaviour exhibited by them. the presence of lab on peyer's patches or in the immune cells associated with the villi of small intestine was determined using fluorescein-labelled bacteria and by transmission electron microscopy. mice were dosed orally by intubation, with 10<sup>1</sup> cells of labelled single strains of lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus. for electron microscopy studies unlabelled bacteria were used. histological preparations of the small and large intestine were performed 1 hour after administration of the bacteria. fluorescent bacteria of l. casei and s. thermophilus were found only in peyer's patches while l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and l. acidophilus were observed in peyer's patches and in the small intestine. l. acidophilus was also found in the large intestine. we confirmed these findings by electron microscopy. we determined that for l. casei the pathway of internalisation was via the m and fae cells of peyer's patches, while for s. thermophilus, l. acidophilus and l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus the interaction with the immune cells of peyer's patches was through the follicle associated epithelium (fae). l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and l. acidophilus also interacted with the epithelial cells of the small intestine and l. acidophilus with epithelial cells of the large intestine. these results suggest that the different effects of lab on the mucosal immunostimulation, are related to the different pathways of gut internalisation used to take contact with the immune cells associated with the lamina propria intestinal.

TI == antibacterial effect of a hydraulic calcium phosphate cement for dental applications.
AB == calcium hydroxide is currently used in dentistry for endodontic treatment where its main advantage consists of its antibacterial and anti-inflammatory potency. however, it also has some drawbacks such as pulp necrosis, slight solubility, slow and low hardening, and retraction on drying. since the studies conducted by brown and chow (iadr 1983, abst. 207), calcium phosphate-based cements (cpc) have attracted considerable interest in bone reconstruction because of their good osteoconductivity. by mixing calcium bis-dihydrogenphosphate monohydrate (mcpm) and calcium oxide with sodium phosphate buffer in the form of liquid phase, we obtained a cpc with better mechanical properties than calcium hydroxide. the setting reaction produced a mixture of calcium-deficient hydroxyapatite and calcium hydroxide, making this cement more suitable for dental applications than orthopedic ones. the presence of calcium hydroxide a priori confers antibacterial properties to this cement, which were investigated in agar plates (diffusion method) against streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus acidophilus, candida albicans (clinical isolates) and a preparation of polymicrobial flora isolated from dental plaque. the cement samples tested were prepared at calcium-to-phosphate molar ratios (ca/p) ranging from 1.67 to 2.75. a pure calcium hydroxide paste was used as reference material. clear and reproducible bacterial growth inhibition was observed for cement samples with ca/p > or = 2 against all the microorganisms tested. mcpm-cao-based cement is therefore a potential candidate for pulp capping and cavity lining.

AB == background: as a bacterial reservoir, the nose may harbor potentially pathogenic  bacteria (ppb: staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, beta-hemolytic streptococci, and haemophilus influenzae). in patients carrying ppb, antiseptic regimens could be crucial for infection control after major operations on or injuries of the head, nasal sinuses, or lungs. such regimens may also be important for diabetic patients and persons receiving hemodialysis, in intensive care units, or with impaired immunity due to various other causes. objective: we tested a possible effect of the ingestion of probiotics on the bacterial flora of the nose. design: in an open, prospective trial, 209 volunteers were randomly assigned to consume either a probiotic, fermented milk drink [65 ml with lactobacillus gg (atcc 53103), bifidobacterium sp b420, lactobacillus acidophilus 145, and streptococcus thermophilus; n = 108] or standard yogurt (180 g; n = 101) daily for 3 wk. nasal microbial flora were analyzed on days 1, 21, and 28. the microbial examination was blinded to the source of the samples. results: we found a significant reduction (19%; p < 0.001) in the occurrence of nasal ppb in the group who consumed the probiotic drink but not in the group who consumed yogurt. the effect was mainly on gram-positive bacteria, which decreased significantly (p < 0.05). conclusions: the results indicate that regular intake of probiotics can reduce ppb in the upper respiratory tract. the results also indicate a linkage of the lymphoid tissue between the gut and the upper respiratory tract.

TI == a mixed-bacteria ecological approach to understanding the role of the oral bacteria in dental caries causation: an alternative to streptococcus mutans and the specific-plaque hypothesis.
AB == for more than 100 years, investigators have tried to identify the bacteria responsible for dental caries formation and to determine whether their role is one of specificity. frequent association of lactobacillus acidophilus and streptococcus mutans with caries activity gave credence to their being specific cariogens. however, dental caries occurrence in their absence, and the presence of other bacteria able to produce substantial amounts of acid from fermentable carbohydrate, provided arguments for non-specificity. in the 1940s, stephan found that the mixed bacteria in dental plaque produced a rapid drop in ph following a sugar rinse and a slow ph return toward baseline. this response became a cornerstone of plaque and mixed-bacterial involvement in dental caries causation when stephan showed that the ph decrease was inversely and clearly related to caries activity. detailed examination of the ph (acid-base) metabolisms of oral pure cultures, dental plaque, and salivary sediment identified the main bacteria and metabolic processes responsible for the ph metabolism of dental plaque. it was discovered that this metabolism in different individuals, in plaque in different dentition locations within individuals, and in individuals of different levels of caries activity could be described in terms of a relatively small number of acid-base metabolic processes. this led to an overall bacterial metabolic vector concept for dental plaque, and helped unravel the bacterial involvement in the degradation of the carbohydrate and nitrogenous substrates that produce the acids and alkali that affect the ph and favor and inhibit dental caries production, respectively. a central role of oral arginolytic and non-arginolytic acidogens in the production of the stephan ph curve was discovered. the non-arginolytics could produce only the ph fall part of this curve, whereas the arginolytics could produce both the fall and the rise. the net result of the latter was a less acidic stephan ph curve. both kinds of bacteria are numerous in dental plaque. by varying their ratios, we were easily able to produce stephan ph curves indicative of different levels of caries activity. this and substantial related metabolic and microbial data indicated that it is the proportions and numbers of acid-base-producing bacteria that are at the core of dental caries activity. the elimination of s. mutans, as with a vaccine, was considered to have little chance of success in preventing dental caries in humans, since, in most cases, this would simply make more room for one or more of the many acidogens remaining. an understanding of mixed-bacterial metabolism, knowledge of how to manipulate and work with mixed bacteria, and the use of a bacterial metabolic vector approach as described in this article have led to (1) a more ecological focus for dealing with dental caries, and (2) new means of developing and evaluating anti-caries agents directed toward microbial mixtures that counter excess acid accumulation and tooth demineralization.

AB == the objective of this research was to investigate the effect of a cyanobacterial  (spirulina platensis) biomass on the microflora of a probiotic fermented dairy product during storage at two temperatures. spirulina-enriched and control (plain) fermented acidophilus-bifidus-thermophilus (abt) milks were produced using a fast fermentation starter culture (abt-4) as the source of lactobacillus acidophilus (a), bifidobacteria (b), and streptococcus thermophilus (t). incubation took 6 h at 40 degrees c. as for the cyanobacterial product, the s. platensis biomass was added to the process milk during stirring at ph 4.5 to 4.6. thereafter, the abt-type fermented milks were cooled to 25 degrees c in ice water, filled into sterile, tightly capped centrifuge tubes, further cooled at 4 degrees c for 24 h, and then stored either at 15 degrees c for 18 d or at 4 degrees c for 42 d. microbiological analyses and acidity measurements were performed at regular intervals. our results showed that the counts of the starter organisms were satisfactory during the entire storage period at both temperatures applied in this research. the s. platensis biomass had a beneficial effect on the survival of abt starter bacteria regardless of storage temperature. postacidification was observed at 15 degrees c, whereas ph remained stable during refrigerated storage at 4 degrees c. the abundance of bioactive substances in s. platensis is of great importance from a nutritional point of view because thus the cyanobacterial biomass provides a new opportunity for the manufacture of functional dairy foods.

TI == effect of fluoride on cariogenic oral microorganisms (an in vitro study).
AB == the effect of sodium fluoride and sodium monofluorophosphate at concentrations of 1, 5, 10, 50, 100 and 1000 mg/l in phosphate buffer (ph 6.5) as well as in uht milk were studied on cultures and suspensions of streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus acidophilus and candida albicans. using serial tenfold dilutions up to 10(-7) of 24-48 hour cultures, a subsequent 0, 60 and 120 min incubation caused no decrease in the number of cfus. growth kinetic studies in the bioscreen biophotometer (labsystem, finland) revealed that sodium fluoride in different concentrations (from 0.875 mg/l up to 500 mg/l) influenced the growth dynamics of s. mutans and c. albicans: the exponential phase flattened out at the highest fluoride concentrations (500 mg/l) present in the growth media. the lag phase of c. albicans became longer. the results of these experiments indicate that sodium fluoride administered at higher concentrations than the usual caries preventive dosage made the generation time of cariogenic oral bacteria and fungi longer, slowing down their multiplication.

TI == salivary microbiota levels in relation to periodontal status, experience of caries and miswak use in sudanese adults.
AB == objectives: the purpose of the present investigation was to assess the salivary levels of 25 oral bacteria in relation to periodontal status and experience of caries, and to compare the levels of these bacteria between habitual miswak and toothbrush users in adult sudanese subjects. material and methods: the study subjects consisted of 56 individuals with age range 19-53 years (mean 35.2 years) and included 30 miswak and 26 toothbrush users. the periodontal status and presence of dental caries were assessed clinically. whole saliva was collected from all subjects, and the levels of 25 selected bacterial species in saliva were assessed by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method using whole genomic dna probes. results: a high percentage of the subjects had detectable levels (> or = 105 bacterial cells) of several bacterial species in saliva. between 12% and 16% of the subjects showed high (> or = 106 cells) salivary levels of the periodontitis-associated bacteria a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. melaninogenica, p. intermedia, c. rectus and e. corrodens, whereas only two (3.6%) and four (7.1%) subjects had high levels of p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum, respectively. there were no significant differences in the levels of all or most bacterial species by age group, gender or periodontal status. presence of > or = 105 l. acidophilus bacterial cells in saliva was associated with high caries scores (p = 0.02). there were significantly higher levels of a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. melaninogenica, c. rectus, p. micros, v. parvula, s. mutans, s. anginosus, a. israelii, c. sputigena, and c. gingivalis, and significantly lower levels of p. intermedia, f. nucleatum, s. sputigena, e. corrodens, l. acidophilus, s. sanguis, s. salivarius, s. oralis, and s. mitis in the miswak than in the toothbrush group. conclusions: : the findings suggest that miswak may have a selective inhibitory effect on the level of certain bacteria in saliva, particularly several oral streptococci species. this is the first report that the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method can be useful for assessing the levels of a wide range of bacterial taxa in saliva.

TI == evolution of carbohydrate fraction in carbonated fermented milks as affected by beta-galactosidase activity of starter strains.
AB == the influence of carbonation on the evolution of lactose, galactose and glucose in fermented milks with added probiotic bacteria (lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus acidophilus and/or bifidobacterium bifidum) was evaluated and related to beta-galactosidase activity of starter strains. during incubation and first days of refrigeration, lactose hydrolysis resulting in the liberation of galactose and glucose occurred in ct (streptococcus thermophilus/lb. casei), at (str. thermophilus/lb. acidophilus) and abt fermented milks (str. thermophilus/lb. acidophilus/bifid. bifidum). levels of galactose were higher than those of glucose and could be related to the preferential consumption of glucose by actively growing bacteria. through the incubation, lactose and monosaccharide levels were not affected by milk carbonation. however, during refrigerated storage the presence of this gas was associated with slightly lower content of lactose and higher levels of galactose and glucose in at and abt products but not in ct fermented milks. through the refrigeration galactose was moderately utilised by lb. acidophilus in at products whereas the presence of bifid. bifidum seems to prevent the consumption of this sugar in abt fermented milks. glucose remained constant, with minor variations in ct products but a continuous increase of this sugar occurred in carbonated at and abt fermented milks during storage. beta-galactosidase activity displayed by str. thermophilus strains was similar at ph 6.5 (initial ph of non-carbonated samples) and ph 6.3 (initial ph of carbonated samples) whereas lb. acidophilus laa3 showed greater beta-galactosidase activity at ph 6.3 than at higher ph values. thus, the enhanced metabolic activity of lb. acidophilus caused by the low initial ph of carbonated milk also promoted higher cellular beta-galactosidase activity that could have released greater amounts of galactose and glucose from lactose in at and abt fermented milks through the refrigerated period. in ct fermented milks, similar beta-galactosidase activity levels of str. thermophilus at ph 6.5 and 6.3 together with the absence of beta-galactosidase activity in lb. casei could explain the lack of differences on glucose and galactose content between carbonated and non-carbonated samples.

TI == interactions among lactic acid starter and probiotic bacteria used for fermented  dairy products.
AB == interactions among lactic acid starter and probiotic bacteria were investigated to establish adequate combinations of strains to manufacture probiotic dairy products. for this aim, a total of 48 strains of streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, and bifidobacterium spp. (eight of each) were used. the detection of bacterial interactions was carried out using the well-diffusion agar assay, and the interactions found were further characterized by growth kinetics. a variety of interactions was demonstrated. lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus was found to be able to inhibit s. thermophilus strains. among probiotic cultures, lb. acidophilus was the sole species that was inhibited by the others (lb. casei and bifidobacterium). in general, probiotic bacteria proved to be more inhibitory towards lactic acid bacteria than vice versa since the latter did not exert any effect on the growth of the former, with some exceptions. the study of interactions by growth kinetics allowed the setting of four different kinds of behaviors between species of lactic acid starter and probiotic bacteria (stimulation, delay, complete inhibition of growth, and no effects among them). the possible interactions among the strains selected to manufacture a probiotic fermented dairy product should be taken into account when choosing the best combination/s to optimize their performance in the process and their survival in the products during cold storage.

TI == lack of therapeutic effect of a specially designed yogurt for the eradication of  helicobacter pylori infection.
AB == background: current antibiotic treatment for helicobacter pylori infection is often associated with frequent adverse effects and resistance to antibiotics. alternative treatment methods to control h. pylori infection are needed. some specific strains of lactic acid bacteria (probiotics) in dairy products are known to inhibit the growth of h. pylori in vitro. a clinical trial was conducted to see the efficacy of a specially designed yogurt product containing specific probiotics on the eradication of h. pylori. method: the yogurt was prepared using three lactobacillus spp. (l. acidophilus and l. casei) and one commercial starter culture (l. acidophilus, l. bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus). all these cultures were previously evaluated, and found to have strong in vitro inhibitory effects on the growth of h. pylori. twenty-seven asymptomatic women positive for h. pylori on gastric biopsy and 13c urea breath test were recruited, and administered 175 ml of the yogurt three times a day for 30 days. the 13c urea breath test was administered again, one month after stopping the yogurt treatment to detect the presence of h. pylori. results: in 26 of 27 subjects, the urea breath test values remained positive, indicating that the consumption of the yogurt had no effect on the eradication of h. pylori. conclusion: although the designed fermented milk containing lactobacilli is very effective in the inhibition of h. pylori growth in vitro, eradication of this infection in humans is difficult to achieve by consuming this product.

TI == enteroinvasive bacteria alter barrier and transport properties of human intestinal epithelium: role of inos and cox-2.
AB == background & aims: various invasive pathogens cause diarrhea, but the mechanism(s) are poorly understood. we hypothesized that nitric oxide and prostaglandins might modulate chloride secretory and barrier properties of the infected intestinal epithelium and that diarrhea is caused, in part, by altered expression of inducible no synthase (inos) and cyclooxygenase 2 (cox-2). methods: studies were conducted in human intestinal epithelial cell lines (ht29/cl.19a, caco-2, and t84). cells were infected with enteroinvasive escherichia coli (eiec 029:nm) or salmonella dublin (sd), or nonpathogenic, noninvasive bacteria (streptococcus thermophilus [st] and lactobacillus acidophilus [la]). infected cells and controls were tested for transepithelial resistance, chloride secretion, prostaglandin e2, guanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate and adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate, and protein expression. results: cells infected with eiec or sd, but not uninfected controls or st/la-exposed monolayers, showed a progressive reduction in transepithelial resistance starting at 6-12 hours. infected ht29/cl.19a and caco-2 cells, but not t84 cells, also showed an increase in total nitrite. expression of inos, and consequently cox-2, was also increased, followed by increased production of prostaglandins and cyclic nucleotides. furthermore, basal and stimulated chloride secretory responses to various agonists were enhanced in ht29/cl.19a and caco-2 cells after infection with enteroinvasive bacteria, and this effect was reversed for some agonists by inos or cox-2 inhibitors. increased expression of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator and nkcc1 was also observed in eiec or sd-infected cells vs. controls, secondary to no synthase activity. conclusions: up-regulation of inos and cox-2 by enteroinvasive bacteria can modulate chloride secretion and barrier function in intestinal epithelial cells. thus, these enzymes represent possible therapeutic targets in infectious diarrhea.

TI == evolution of the lactic acid bacterial community during malt whisky fermentation: a polyphasic study.
AB == the development of the lactic acid bacterial community in a commercial malt whisky fermentation occurred in three broad phases. initially, bacteria were inhibited by strong yeast growth. fluorescence microscopy and environmental scanning electron microscopy revealed, in this early stage, both cocci and rods that were at least partly derived from the wort and yeast but also stemmed from the distillery plant. denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) of partial 16s rrna genes and sequence analysis revealed cocci related to streptococcus thermophilus or saccharococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus brevis, and lactobacillus fermentum. the middle phase began 35 to 40 h after yeast inoculation and was characterized by exponential growth of lactobacilli and residual yeast metabolism. lactobacillus casei or lactobacillus paracasei, l. fermentum, and lactobacillus ferintoshensis were detected in samples of fermenting wort examined by dgge during this stage. bacterial growth was accompanied by the accumulation of acetic and lactic acids and the metabolism of residual maltooligosaccharides. by 70 h, two new pcr bands were detected on dgge gels, and the associated bacteria were largely responsible for the final phase of the fermentation. the bacteria were phylogenetically related to lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus delbrueckii, and strains similar to the former had previously been recovered from malt whisky fermentations in japan. these were probably obligately homofermentative bacteria, required malt wort for growth, and could not be cultured on normal laboratory media, such as mrs. their metabolism during the last 20 to 30 h of fermentation was associated with yeast death and autolysis and further accumulation of lactate but no additional acetate.

AB == the c repeat region of the m6 protein (m6c) from streptococcus pyogenes was expressed within the pip bacteriophage receptor on the surface of lactococcus lactis. m6c was also detected in the culture medium. the pip-emm6c allele was integrated into the chromosome and stably expressed without antibiotic selection. the level of cell-associated surface expression of pipm6c was 0.015% of total cellular protein. the amount of pipm6c on the cell surface was increased about 17-fold by expressing pip-emm6c from a high-copy-number plasmid. replacing the native pip promoter with stronger promoters isolated previously from lactobacillus acidophilus increased surface expression of pipm6c from the high-copy-number plasmid up to 27-fold. concomitantly, the amount of pipm6c in the medium increased 113-fold. the amount of pipm6c did not vary greatly between exponential- and stationary-phase cultures. western blots indicated that the full-length pipm6c protein and most of the numerous proteolytic products were found only on the cell surface, whereas only one proteolytic fragment was found in the culture medium.

TI == reduction of oxaluria after an oral course of lactic acid bacteria at high concentration.
AB == background: hyperoxaluria is a major risk factor for renal stones, and in most cases, it appears to be sustained by increased dietary load or increased intestinal absorption. previous studies have shown that components of the endogenous digestive microflora, in particular oxalobacter formigenes, utilize oxalate in the gut, thus limiting its absorption. we tested the hypothesis of whether oxaluria can be reduced by means of reducing intestinal absorption through feeding a mixture of freeze-dried lactic acid bacteria. methods: six patients with idiopathic calcium-oxalate urolithiasis and mild hyperoxaluria (>40 mg/24 h) received daily a mixture containing 8 x 10(11) freeze-dried lactic acid bacteria (l. acidophilus, l. plantarum, l. brevis, s. thermophilus, b. infantis) for four weeks. the 24-hour urinary excretion of oxalate was determined at the end of the study period and then one month after ending the treatment. the ability of bacteria to degrade oxalate and grow in oxalate-containing media, and the gene expression of ox1t, an enzyme that catalyzes the transmembrane exchange of oxalate, also were investigated. results: the treatment resulted in a great reduction of the 24-hour excretion of oxalate in all six patients enrolled. mean levels +/- sd were 33.5 +/- 15.9 mg/24 h at the end of the study period and 28.3 +/- 14.6 mg/24 h one month after treatment was interrupted compared with baseline values of 55.5 +/- 19.6 mg/24 h (p < 0.05). the treatment was associated with a strong reduction of the fecal excretion of oxalate in the two patients tested. two bacterial strains among those used for the treatment (l. acidophilus and s. thermophilus) proved in vitro to degrade oxalate effectively, but their growth was somewhat inhibited by oxalate. one strain (b. infantis) showed a quite good degrading activity and grew rapidly in the oxalate-containing medium. l. plantarum and l. brevis showed a modest ability to degrade oxalate even though they grew significantly in oxalate-containing medium. no strain expressed the ox1t gene. conclusions: the urinary excretion of oxalate, a major risk factor for renal stone formation and growth in patients with idiopathic calcium-oxalate urolithiasis, can be greatly reduced with treatment using a high concentration of freeze-dried lactic acid bacteria. we postulate that the biological manipulation of the endogenous digestive microflora can be a novel approach for the prevention of urinary stone formation.

(bifidobacterium longum, b. breve, b. infantis, b. bifidum, and b. adolescentis) and five other lactic acid bacteria strains (lactobacillus casei, l. bulgaricus, l. acidophilus, streptococcus thermophilus, and s. lactis). both spots of lactic acid and acetic acid were detected on all the tlc plates from the five bifidobacterial culture broths. the five other lactic acid bacterial culture broths, however, only exhibited lactic acid spots. accordingly, the proposed tlc method would appear to be a useful tool for rapid identification of bifidobacterium spp. at the genus level.

AB == salmonella enteritidis colonizes the intestinal tract of poultry and causes foodborne illness in humans. reduction of salmonella enteritidis colonization in the intestinal tract of poultry reduces potential carcass contamination during slaughter. the purpose of this study was to determine the effect of an avian-specific probiotic combined with salmonella enteritidis-, salmonella typhimurium-, and salmonella heidelberg-specific antibodies on the cecal colonization and organ invasion of salmonella enteritidis in broiler as well as on body weights. the treatment group was defined as chicks spray-vaccinated with avian pac plus at the hatchery and given avian pac plus for the first 3 days after placement. an intermediate treatment was given at 10 and 14 days, 2 days prior to vaccination and 2 days postvaccination. all birds were vaccinated with newcastle disease vaccine, la sota virus (one drop/eye) at 12 days of age. a final treatment was given 3 days preslaughter. the control group was defined as chicks not given avian pac plus at any time. six hours after oral administration of the probiotic suspension (treatment group) or water (control group) at placement, the chicks were challenged with salmonella enteritidis. all chickens were orally inoculated with 0.25 ml of salmonella enteritidis that contained 4 x 10(7) cfu/1.0 ml. cecal colonization and organ invasion were evaluated for salmonella enteritidis on days 0, 1, 3, 7, 10, 17, 24, 31, 38, and 41. the probiotic-treated group had a significantly lower concentration of salmonella enteritidis cecal colonization at days 3, 7, 10, 17, 24, 31, 38, and 41 when compared to the nontreated, control group (p < 0.05). similarly, there was a significant difference (p < 0.05) in the isolation of salmonella enteritidis from the internal organs (liver and spleen) when probiotic-treated and nonprobiotic-treated groups were compared. there was no significant difference (p > 0.05) in the mean body weight between the two experimental groups at each collection period. these results indicated that a combination of lactobacillus acidophilus, streptococcus faecium, and salmonella enteritidis, salmonella typhimurium, and salmonella heidelberg-specific antibodies have a beneficial effect in reducing the colonization of salmonella enteritidis in market-aged broilers.

AB == background/aims: the main reason for this study was to determine whether yoghurt  bacteria, being rich in some water-soluble vitamins, release them or utilize vitamins from their surroundings. our study was trying to determine for the first time, if the viable bacteria of probiotic yoghurt are able to influence the parameters of the b-vitamin (b(1), b(2), b(6)) status of the healthy adult human. methods: the test yoghurt was commercially available probiotic yoghurt prepared with streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus acidophilus, enriched with lactobacillus casei gg. different chemical forms of all investigated b-vitamins were determined by hplc methods. in order to determine the influence of the yoghurt flora, each of 12 subjects consumed four yoghurt portions 125 g each ( = 500 g) a day, containing thermally inactivated cultures during the first 2-week period and yoghurt without heat treatment during the second 2-week period. results: the heat treatment of the probiotic yoghurt caused negligible changes in vitamin contents. the plasma levels of thiamin decreased significantly (p < 0.01) after the first 2-week period and kept on decreasing during the second 2-week period. a similar trend was found in the urinary excretion. the plasma levels of the b(2)-vitamers were different. the flavin adenine dinucleotide concentrations increased significantly (p < 0.01) after the consumption of heat-treated yoghurt and decreased significantly (p < 0.05) after the following 2 weeks, in which the subjects received the untreated yoghurt. in contrast, the flavin mononucleotide plasma levels decreased during the first 2-week period and increased during the second part of the study, but the change was not statistically significant. the free riboflavin concentrations in plasma and urine showed a continuous but not significant increase. the concentrations of pyridoxal-5-phosphate in plasma increased after the consumption of yoghurt with the inactivated bacteria and decreased in the second part of the study. however, the differences were not significant. the excretion of thiamin, b(2)- and b(6)-vitamers in the faeces did not significantly change throughout the study period (p>0.05). conclusions: our observations show that the bacterial flora of the examined yoghurt does not influence the vitamin b(1), b(2) and b(6) status of man. it seems likely that even lactobacilli of the 'probiotic' type which are vitamin b consumers can decrease the bioavailability of these vitamins for man. obviously a thermal death of the cells did not induce a release of physiologically active vitamins.

TI == gut mucosal immunostimulation by lactic acid bacteria.
AB == the beneficial properties of lactic acid bacteria (lab) on human health have been frequently demonstrated. the interaction of lab with the lymphoid cells associated to the gut to activate the mucosal immune system and the mechanisms by which they can exert an adjuvant effect is still unclear, as well as if this property is common for all the lab. we studied the influence of the oral administration of different geneous of lab such as lactobacillus casei, l. acidophilus, l. rhamnosus, l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, l. plantarum, lactococcus lactis and streptococcus thermophilus. we determined if the lab assayed were able to stimulate the specific, the non-specific immune response (inflammatory response), or both. we demonstrated that all the bacteria assayed were able to increase the number of iga producing cells associated to the lamina propria of small intestine. this effect was dose dependent. the increase in iga+ producing cells was not always correlated with an increase in the cd4+ t cell number, indicating that some lab assayed only induced clonal expansion of b cells triggered to produce iga. most of them, induced an increase in the number of cells involved in the inflammatory immune response. cd8+ t cell were diminished or not affected, with exception of l. plantarum that induced an increase at low dose. this fact would mean that lab are unable to induce cytotoxicity mechanisms. we demonstrated the importance in the selection of lab to be used as gut mucosal adjuvant. the different behaviours observed among them on the gut mucosal immune response, specially those that induce inflammatory immune response, show that not all the lab can be used as oral adjuvant and that the beneficial effect of them can not generalized to genous or specie. the immunoadjuvant capacity would be a property of the strain assayed.

TI == probiotic bacteria: safety, functional and technological properties.
AB == during the past two decades probiotic (health promoting) micro-organisms have been increasingly included in various types of food products, especially in fermented milks. several aspects, including safety, functional and technological characteristics, have to be taken into consideration in the selection process of probiotic micro-organisms. safety aspects include specifications such as origin (healthy human gi-tract), non-pathogenicity and antibiotic resistance characteristics. functional aspects include viability and persistence in the gi-tract, immunomodulation, antagonistic and antimutagenic properties. before probiotic strains, chosen on the basis of their good safety and functional characteristics, can benefit the consumer, they must first be able to be manufactured under industrial conditions. furthermore, they have to survive and retain their functionality during storage, and also in the foods into which they are incorporated without producing off-flavours. factors related to the technological and sensory aspects of probiotic food production are of utmost importance since only by satisfying the demands of the consumer can the food industry succeed in promoting the consumption of functional probiotic products in the future.

TI == reduction of fecal shedding of enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli o157:h7 in lambs by feeding microbial feed supplement.
AB == enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli o157:h7, an emerging food-borne pathogen, has  been implicated in several outbreaks in the us. ruminants, including cattle, sheep and deer are reservoirs of e. coli o157:h7 and fecal shedding of the pathogen forms the vehicle of entry into the human food chain. we studied the efficacy of lactobacillus acidophilus, streptococcus faecium, a mixture of l. acidophilus and s. faecium and a mixture of l. acidophilus, s. faecium, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus plantarum in reducing fecal shedding of e. coli o157:h7 by sheep experimentally infected with the pathogen prior to administration with the microbials. following oral inoculation with 10(10)cfu of e. coli o157:h7, 30 suffolk ram lambs were blocked by body weight (six blocks of five lambs each) and lambs within the block randomly assigned to five groups. the lamb groups were fed daily for 7 weeks a basal diet without microbial supplement (control) or the basal diet with l. acidophilus or with s. faecium or with a mixture of l. acidophilus and s. faecium or with a mixture of l. acidophilus, s. faecium, l. casei, l. fermentum and l. plantarum. the microbial supplements contained stabilized live naturally occurring bacteria and were mixed with the diet at the rate of 6.0x10(6)cfu per kilogram of diet. fecal samples were collected weekly and analyzed for e. coli o157:h7 using modified tryptic soy broth with novobiocin as a pre-enrichement broth and cefixim-tellurite sorbitol macconkey agar (ct-smac) as a selective media. e. coli o157:h7 was confirmed by its reaction with o157 and h7 antisera. e. coli o157:h7 was shed continuously and in varying numbers in the feces throughout the 7-week experimental period by all five groups. however, lambs administered a mixture of l. acidophilus, s. faecium, l. casei, l. fermentum and l. plantarum shed significantly lower (p=0.0211) average number of e. coli o157:h7 (2.3log(10)cfu per gram of feces per week) than the other lamb groups over the entire experimental period. s. faecium supplemented lambs were comparable (p=0.0884) to lambs fed a mixture of l. acidophulus and s. faecium in fecal shedding of the pathogen (3.5 versus 4.4log(10)cfu per gram of feces) but significantly lower (p=0.0001) than the control lambs (5.6log(10)cfu per gram of feces) and those supplemented with l. acidophilus (5.5log(10)cfu per gram of feces). average daily gain (adg) and gain to feed ratio (g:f) were significantly improved (p=0.0145) by the mixed culture microbials (163.0g and 0.33 for the control, 186.4g and 0.37 for l. acidophulus, 168.2g and 0.36 for s. faecium, 213.6g and 0.46 for l. acidophulus and s. faecium, and 219.1g and 0.44, respectively for l. acidophilus, s. faecium, l. casei, l. fermentum and l. plantarum supplemented lambs. the study indicates that supplementing lambs infected with e. coli o157:h7 with s. faecium or a mixture of s. faecium, l. acidophilus, l. casei, l. fermentum and l. plantarum in the diet can reduce total number of e. coli o157:h7 shed in the feces and improve animal meat production performance as well.

AB == the immunostimulating and protective effects of an oral polybacterial immunomodulator, dentavax (d), composed of killed cells from klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, candida albicans and lactobacillus acidophilus and their lysates, have been investigated on an experimental rabbit model. in this model, mixed suspensions of the above bacterial wild strains have been injected in six sides of oral mucosa. a long-lasting inflammation with the development of infiltrates and confluating abscesses has been observed. the influence of orally given dentavax on the course of the model infection as well as on the dynamics of the immune response has been studied. a two-fold decrease in the duration and severity of inflammatory reaction, confirmed by the histological findings, has been registered. in immunised animals, an activation of polymorphonuclear phagocytosis, together with stimulation of humoral systemic and mucosal immunity with synthesis of specific serum (predominantly, igg) and coproantibodies (predominantly, s-iga) determined by elisa, has been found. the results obtained proved the strong immunostimulating and protective effects of the preparation d, which is meant for the prophylaxis and treatment of inflammatory periodontal diseases.

TI == fractional inhibitory concentration index of combinations of antibacterial agents against cariogenic organisms.
AB == objectives: to examine the inhibitory effects between paired combinations of four antibacterial agents that have been investigated in dentistry against six bacteria associated with dentinal caries. methods: the antibacterial agents tested were: chlorhexidine dihydrochloride, benzalkonium chloride, cetrimide and cetylpyridinium chloride. two organisms each belonging to streptococcus, lactobacillus and actinomyces species were evaluated against these agents. a checkerboard microtitration method was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration and fractionary inhibitory concentration (fic) and summation operator fic index of the paired combinations of antibacterial agents against the six species of bacteria. appropriate controls were included. the summation operator fic index was then used to determine if synergy, antagonism, or indifference occurred as a result of interactions between the antibacterial agents and the test organisms. results: the data from a total of 295 test results were evaluated. using summation operator fic values for synergy as < or = 0.5 and antagonism as > 4.0 as recommended by the american society for microbiology, no significant synergistic or antagonistic interactions were observed between the paired antibacterial agents when tested against selected organisms. however, a tendency for an additive antibacterial effect was observed with approximately a third of the test results. nonetheless, no combination of antibacterial agents appeared to be superior to any other. conclusions: according to these in vitro results, there appears to be no beneficial effect of combining the antibacterial agents against the individual cariogenic micro-organisms selected. however, it may be beneficial to use combined antibacterial agents that have a broader range of activity against an ecosystem of bacteria than using individual agents.

TI == viability of probiotic (bifidobacterium, lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus casei) and nonprobiotic microflora in argentinian fresco cheese.
AB == we evaluated the suitability of argentinian fresco cheese as a food carrier of probiotic cultures. we used cultures of bifidobacterium bifidum (two strains), bifidobacterium longum (two strains), bifidobacterium sp. (one strain), lactobacillus acidophilus (two strains), and lactobacillus casei (two strains) in different combinations, as probiotic adjuncts. probiotic, lactic starter (lactococcus lactis and streptococcus thermophilus), and contaminant (coliforms, yeasts, and molds) organisms were counted at 0, 30, and 60 d of refrigerated storage. furthermore, the acid resistance of probiotic and starter bacteria was determined from hydrochloric solutions (ph 2 and 3) of fresco cheese. the results showed that nine different combinations of bifidobacteria and l. acidophilus had a satisfactory viability (count decreases in 60 d <1 log order) in the cheese. both combinations of bifidobacteria and l. casei cultures assayed also showed a satisfactory survival (counts decreased <1 log order for bifidobacteria but no decrease was detected for l. casei). on the other hand, the three combinations of bifidobacteria, l. acidophilus, and l. casei tested adapted well to the fresco cheese environment. when a cheese homogenate at ph 3 was used to partially simulate the acidic conditions in the stomach, the probiotic cultures had an excellent ability to remain viable up to 3 h. at ph 2, the cell viability was more affected; b. bifidum was the most resistant organism. this study showed that the argentinian fresco cheese could be used as an adequate carrier of probiotic bacteria.

AB == cells from a number of bacterial genera have been shown to possess mitogenic and  polyclonal activating properties when cultured with cells of the immune system. based on previously reported health immune-enhancing effects of fermented dairy products, we tested the potentiating effects of representative lactic acid bacteria and their extracts on leukocyte function. specifically, the effects of in vitro exposure to heat-killed cells of bifidobacterium, lactobacillus acidophilus, l. bulgaricus, l. casei, l. gasseri, l. helveticus, l. reuteri, and streptococcus thermophilus, their cell walls, and their cytoplasmic extracts on proliferation as well as cytokine and nitric oxide (no) production were examined in the raw 264.7 macrophage cell line. a similar strategy was applied to murine cultures composed of peritoneal, spleen, and peyer's patch cells. both the cell wall and cytoplasmic fractions of lactic acid bacteria were able to stimulate cloned macrophages to produce significant amounts of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, (interleukin) il-6, and no. pronounced enhancement of il-6 production by peritoneal cells was observed when cultured with those extracts, whereas, effects were not noted in spleen and peyer's patch cell cultures from mice. based on the results, it appears that, as a group, the lactic acid bacteria were capable of stimulating macrophages and possibly other immune cells to produce cytokines and no, and both their cell walls and cytoplasm contributed to these capacities.

TI == study of the possible mechanisms involved in the mucosal immune system activation by lactic acid bacteria.
AB == the induction of a mucosal immune response is not easy due to the development of  oral tolerance, but under some conditions, bacteria can activate this immune system. antigens administered orally can interact with m cells of peyer's patches or bind to the epithelial cells. we have demonstrated that certain lactic acid bacteria are able to induce specific secretory immunity, and others will enhance the gut inflammatory immune response. the aim of this work was to establish the reason for these different behaviors and to define possible mechanisms involved in the interaction of lactic acid bacteria at the intestinal level. we studied iga+ and igm+ b cells comparatively in bronchus and intestine and cd4+ t cells and iga anti-lactic acid bacteria antibodies in the intestinal fluid, induced by oral administration of lactobacillus casei, lb. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, lb. acidophilus, lb. plantarum, lb. rhamnosus, lactococcus lactis, and streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus. the increase in the iga+ b cells in the bronchus means that these lactic acid bacteria were able to induce the iga cycle by interaction with m cells from peyer's patches or intestinal epithelial cells. the igm+ cells increased when the stimulus did not induce the switch from igm+ to iga+. the increase in the cd4+ cells suggests interaction of peyer's patches and enhancement of the b- and t-cell migration. the anti-lactic acid bacteria antibody is related to the processing and presentation of the microorganisms to the immune cells. we demonstrated that lb. casei and lb. plantarum were able to interact with peyer's patch cells and showed an increase in iga-, cd4+ cells, and antibodies specific for the stimulating strain. lactobacillus acidophilus induced gut mucosal activation by interaction with the epithelial cells without increase in the immune cells associated with the bronchus. although lb. rhamnosus and strep. salivarius ssp. thermophilus interact with epithelial cells, they also induced an immune response against their epitopes. lactococcus lactis and lb. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus induced an increase of iga+ cells entering the iga cycle but not cd4+ cells; thus, these bacteria would have been bound to epithelial cells that activated b lymphocytes without processing and presenting of their epitopes. we did not determine specific antibodies against lc. lactis or lb. bulgaricus.

AB == the purpose of this study was to determine the effect of a fermented milk product containing lactobacillus johnsonii la1 (formerly known as lactobacillus acidophilus la1) on the phagocytic activity of peripheral blood leukocytes in healthy adult volunteers. furthermore, we sought to define the effective doses of the bacteria, examine the effect on respiratory burst activity, and, finally, examine the contribution made by the starter culture to the biological effects. volunteers were randomly distributed among three groups; each subject received one pot (150 ml) of fermented milk each day for 3 wk. the first two groups received a freshly prepared product fermented by streptococcus thermophilus (group a) alone or s. thermophilus and 10(7) cfu/ml l. johnsonii la1 (group b). group c received a product stored for a period of 21 to 28 d and that contained s. thermophilus and 10(6) cfu/ml of l. johnsonii la1. ingestion of l. johnsonii la1 did not significantly increase fecal lactobacilli counts. however, l. johnsonii la1 was able to survive intestinal transit and was only recovered from the feces of the volunteers of groups b and c. the fermented base alone showed a weak effect on respiratory burst but not on phagocytic activity. however, the product containing 10(7) cfu/ml l. johnsonii la1 significantly enhanced both functions. the product containing 10(6) cfu/ml of l. johnsonii la1 had no significant effect on either function. these results suggest that fecal persistence may not necessarily reflect in vivo colonization and may not be a prerequisite for all forms of immune reactivity.

TI == ingestion of yogurt containing lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium to potentiate immunoglobulin a responses to cholera toxin in mice.
AB == lactic acid bacteria have been reported to have benefits for the prevention and treatment of some forms of diarrhea and related conditions. to determine whether these effects might involve direct stimulation of the gastrointestinal immune response, we administered yogurt to try to enhance mucosal and systemic antibodies against an orally presented immunogen, cholera toxin. yogurts were manufactured with starter cultures containing different species and strains of lactic acid bacteria. mice were fed these yogurts for 3 wk, during which they were also orally immunized twice with 10 micrograms of cholera toxin. blood was collected on d 0 and 21, and fecal pellets were collected weekly. mice that were immunized orally with cholera toxin responded by producing specific intestinal and serum immunoglobulin (ig)a anti-cholera toxin. antibody responses of the iga isotype were significantly increased in mice fed yogurts made with starters containing the conventional yogurt bacteria lactobacillus bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus supplemented with lactobacillus acidophilus, bifidobacterium bifidum, and bifidobacterium infantis. yogurt that was manufactured with starters containing only conventional yogurt bacteria produced less iga anti-cholera toxin than did the control group fed nonfat dry milk. although strong responses were also observed for igg anti-cholera toxin in serum, the responses did not differ among groups. thus, administration of yogurt supplemented with l. acidophilus and bifidobacterium spp. enhanced mucosal and systemic iga responses to the cholera toxin immunogen.

TI == effects of yogurt ingestion on mucosal and systemic cytokine gene expression in the mouse.
AB == to assess the potential for ingestion of yogurt to modulate immunity, its effects on basal gene expression of cytokines in systemic and mucosal sites were determined in mice. yogurts were manufactured from pasteurized nonfat dry milk using five commercial starter cultures with or without bifidobacterium sp. and lactobacillus acidophilus. treatment mice were fed the ain-93g diet mixed 1:1 with unheated yogurt or heat-treated yogurt (wt/wt) for 2 and 4 weeks, and control mice were fed the ain-93g diet mixed 1:1 (wt/wt) with nonfat dry milk. the viability of the various bacterial groups in unheated yogurts was maintained above 10(6) cfu/g throughout the feeding period. the yogurt-feeding regimens did not significantly affect weight gain. relative mrna levels in spleen, mesenteric lymph nodes, or peyer's patches for the cytokines interferon-gamma, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-2, -4, and -6, and the "housekeeping gene" beta2-microglobulin were determined by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in conjunction with hybridization analysis. prolonged feeding of some yogurts decreased expression of several cytokine mrnas, the depression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha mrna in the spleen being the most prominent effect. heat-treated yogurts were more effective in altering cytokine mrna expression than were unheated yogurts containing viable organisms. generally, yogurts either had no effect or decreased specific cytokine mrna in the test organs, regardless of whether they contained bifidobacterium sp. and l. acidophilus. these results suggest that, in contrast with previous studies in vitro, some yogurt formulations may reduce rather than stimulate basal cytokine expression and that these effects are most prominent in the systemic compartment.

AB == increasing numbers of functional foods and pharmaceutical preparations are being  promoted with health claims based on the potential probiotic characteristics of lactic acid bacteria and on their capacity for stimulating the host immune system. however, the specific immune effects of oral administration of these microbes still remains undefined. in this study, we tested the hypothesis that production of immunologic mediators by leukocytes in mice is affected by orally administered lactic acid bacteria. the specific objectives of this study were to evaluate the effects of exposure to eight different lactic acid bacteria in mice on ex vivo cytokine and nitric oxide production in leukocyte cultures. mice were gavaged with 1 x 10(9) viable bacteria and peritoneal, peyer's patch and splenic leukocytes were isolated 8 h later. these were cultured for 2 or 5 days in the presence or absence of mitogens and then interleukin (il)-6, il-12, interferon (ifn)-gamma, tumor necrosis factor (tnf)-alpha, and nitric oxide production was measured. the results revealed that lactobacillus acidophilus and l. casei potentiated il-6 and il-12 production by peritoneal cells whereas l. acidophilus upregulated ifn-gamma and nitric oxide. in contrast, l. helveticus, l. gasseri, l. reuteri, and bifidobacterium attenuated the production of il-6, ifn-gamma, and nitric oxide by peritoneal cells. tnf-alpha was not detectable in peritoneal cultures. none of the bacteria altered ex vivo production of cytokines or nitric oxide by peyer's patch or spleen cell cultures. taken together, the results suggest that prior oral exposure to lactic acid bacteria could differentially potentiate or attenuate subsequent cytokine and nitric oxide production by peritoneal cells.

AB == campylobacter jejuni has often been responsible for human gastroenteritis. poultry have often been implicated as a source for these human infections. intestinal colonization of c. jejuni in the chicken plays a role in carcass contamination during slaughter. thus, reducing c. jejuni colonization in chickens can potentially reduce the incidence of c. jejuni infections in humans. the use of probiotics to competitively exclude the colonization of intestinal pathogens has been proposed for poultry. hence, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the use of an avian-specific probiotic containing lactobacillus acidophilus and streptococcus faecium for reducing the shedding and colonization of c. jejuni in the chicken intestinal tract. day-old chicks were randomly allocated into either a probiotic-treated group or a control group. the treated group was given probiotic from day 1 to day 3, and the control group was not given any probiotic. six hours after the first oral administration of probiotics (treatment) or double distilled water (control), these chicks were challenged with c. jejuni. the frequency of the c. jejuni shedding was monitored until market age. intestinal colonization was determined for the two experimental groups at slaughter. results indicated that chickens given probiotics from day 1 to day 3 had a 70% reduction in the frequency of c. jejuni shedding in colonized chicks (p = 0.0001) and a 27% reduction in jejunal colonization in colonized chicks (p = 0.0001) at slaughter when compared with the control group. thus, the use of the avian-specific probiotic containing l. acidophilus and s. faecium can reduce the colonization and frequency of fecal shedding of c. jejuni in market-aged broilers.

AB == six lactobacillus acidophilus, 5 bifidobacterium, and 6 streptococcus thermophilus strains were studied for characteristics that are important to activity and stability in unfermented fluid milk products. speciation, strain relatedness, frozen concentrate stability, bile sensitivity, and lactase activity were evaluated. the microbiological stability of a culture-containing fluid milk product was also determined. two of the bifidobacteria cultures contained > 1 strain. some strains were shown to be closely related or identical by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of fragmented chromosomal dna. selective media that distinguished among all 3 added genera were identified. all lactobacilli and most of the bifidobacteria were resistant to bile concentrations varying from 1 to 3%, and all streptococci were sensitive to bile. lactase activities were highest for s. thermophilus strains, supporting use of this species in fluid milk and dairy products to aid in the digestion of lactose by consumers. the experimental product evaluated in this study contained 10(7) cfu/ml of both l. acidophilus and bifidobacterium spp. and 5 x 10(7) cfu/ml of s. thermophilus. lactic, but not psychrotrophic, populations were fairly stable during storage. the results suggest that milk formulated with high concentrations of three different genera of probiotic bacteria can be manufactured with commercial strains.

TI == composition of the lactobacillus acidophilus complex isolated from vaginal flora.
AB == one hundred and fifty human vaginal samples containing a diversity of pathogens or nonpathogens (gardnerella vaginalis, streptococcus sp., staphylococcus sp., candida albicans. mycoplasma sp.) were examined for their content in lactobacilli of the lactobacillus acidophilus complex. although all samples contained lactobacilli, strains of the l. acidophilus complex were present in only twenty-nine cases. isolates were further characterized and compared with type strains or reference strains in an attempt to differentiate by phenotypic means the genospecies of the l. acidophilus complex. data regarding specific activities of beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) and of phospho-beta-galactosidase (p-beta-gal) provided no specific information at the species level within the l. acidophilus complex. dna-relatedness differentiates this genospecies. most lactobacilli isolated from the vaginal flora of symptomatic women were genotypically close to l. gasseri cip 102991t by the technique of dna/dna hybridization.

TI == biotherapeutic agents. a neglected modality for the treatment and prevention of selected intestinal and vaginal infections.
AB == objective: to evaluate the potential of biotherapeutic agents (microorganisms with therapeutic properties) for the prevention and/or treatment of selected intestinal and vaginal infections. data sources: the medline database was searched for all relevant articles published between 1966 and september 1995. search terms used were biotherapeutic agent, probiotic, lactobacillus, saccharomyces, bifidobacterium, candida, gastrointestinal- system, vaginitis, vaginosis-bacterial, and related terms. the bibliographies of obtained articles were also reviewed. study selection and data extraction: all placebo-controlled human studies on biotherapeutic agents were reviewed. english-language open trials, case series and reports, and animal studies were reviewed only if they were especially relevant to providing information on the potential efficacy, adverse effects, or mechanisms of action of these agents. data synthesis: placebo-controlled studies have shown that biotherapeutic agents have been used successfully to prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhea (lactobacillus caseigg, bifidobacterium longum, b longum with l acidophilus, and saccharomyces boulardii), to prevent acute infantile diarrhea (bifidobacterium bifidum with streptococcus thermophilus), to treat recurrent clostridium difficile disease (s boulardii), and to treat various other diarrheal illnesses (enterococcus faecium sf68, l caseigg, and s boulardii). there is also evidence for lactobacillus acidophilus in the prevention of candidal vaginitis. few adverse effects have been reported. however, many of the studies tested only small numbers of patients or volunteers. conclusions: there is now evidence that administration of selected microorganisms is beneficial in the prevention and treatment of certain intestinal and, possibly, treatment of vaginal infections. in an effort to decrease the reliance on antimicrobials, the time has come to carefully explore the therapeutic applications of biotherapeutic agents.

TI == lactobacillus- and bifidobacterium-mediated antigenotoxicity in the colon of rats.
AB == lactic acid bacteria (lab) are proposed to have several beneficial effects, including the inactivation of carcinogens. we have studied the potential of lactobacillus acidophilus (from a commercially available yogurt), lactobacillus gasseri (p79), lactobacillus confusus (dsm20196), streptococcus thermophilus (ncim 50083), bifidobacterium breve and bifidobacterium longum (from human infant stool) to prevent the induction of dna damage by n-methyl-n'-nitro-n-nitrosoguanidine (mnng, 7.5 mg/kg body wt) in colon cells of the rat. using the new technique of single cell microgel electrophoresis, all investigated strains were antigenotoxic toward mnng after a single dose of 10(10) viable cells/kg body wt p.o. eight hours before the carcinogen. one-half and one-tenth of this initial dose resulted in a loss of protective activity. high doses of heat-treated l. acidophilus strains were also not antigenotoxic. one mechanism of the preventive effect could be that bacterial metabolites or components are responsible. accordingly, selected examples were investigated in vitro in colon cells of the rat. metabolically active l. acidophilus cells, as well as an acetone extract of the culture, prevented mnng-induced dna damage. different cell fractions from l. acidophilus (cytoplasm, cell wall skeleton, cell wall) were devoid of antigenotoxic activity, whereas the peptidoglycan fraction and whole freeze-dried cells were antigenotoxic. as a second carcinogen, 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (dmh) was used. a dose- and time-response study was first performed to assess the effects of dmh in several segments of the gastrointestinal (gi) tract. exposure for 16 hours to 15 or 25 mg dmh/kg body wt p.o. induced dna damage in cells of the distal colon of rats, whereas no cytotoxicity was seen. pretreatment orally with lab on four consecutive mornings before dmh gavage (8 hours after the last lab application) revealed that l. acidophilus, l. confusus, l. gasseri, b. longum, and b. breve inhibited the genotoxic effect of dmh. one of four s. thermophilus and one of three lactobacillus delbrueckeii ssp. bulgaricus strains were also protective. heat-treated l. acidophilus did not inhibit dmh-induced genotoxicity. a few aliquots of the colon cells were processed immunohistochemically for the presence of the "proliferation cell nuclear antigen" (pcna). dmh treatment did not increase pcna, nor was there any modulation by lab. the effect of l. acidophilus on foreign compound-metabolizing enzymes (phase i and phase ii) in liver and colon cells of rats revealed only one parameter to be modulated, namely, a two- to three-fold increase in the levels of nadph-cytochrome p-450 reductase. the meaning of this finding, in terms of possible chemoprevention by lab, remains unclear. in conclusion, our studies show that most, but not all, lab tested could strongly inhibit genotoxicity in the gi tract of the rat and that viable lab organisms are required for the protective effect in vivo. the comet assay technique is a powerful tool to elucidate such in vivo antigenotoxic activities in tumor target tissues.

TI == role of intestinal bacteria in ileal ulcer formation in rats treated with a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug.
AB == the role of intestinal bacteria in induction and repression of ulcer formation in the ileum of rats treated with one of the nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (nsaids), 5-bromo-2-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-(4-methylsulfonylphenyl) thiophene (bfmet), was examined in this study. bfmet was administered by intragastric gavage once at doses of 500-1,500 mg/kg of body weight to wistar rats treated with and without antibiotics (bacitracin, neomycin, streptomycin), germ-free rats and gnotobiotic rats, and 72 hr later their gastrointestinal tracts were examined for ulcer formation. a single oral administration of bfmet induced ileal ulcers in specific pathogen-free rats. however, the rats given antibiotics to reduce the intestinal bacteria had no ulcers. bfmet-treated germ-free rats and gnotobiotic rats mono-associated with bifidobacterium adolescentis or lactobacillus acidophilus also had no intestinal ulcers. however, the drug induced ileal ulcers in gnotobiotic rats mono-associated with eubacterium limosum or escherichia coli. an overnight culture of b. adolescentis or l. acidophilus or yogurt containing bifidobacterium breve and streptococcus thermophilus, when given as drinking water, inhibited ulcer formation in the ileum of rats treated with bfmet. gram staining of the ileal contents of normal rats revealed that 97.4% of the stained microorganisms were gram-positive rods and only 1.2% were gram-negative rods. in the group of rats with ulcers induced by bfmet, the gram-positive rods decreased by 56.4% and the gram-negative rods including escherichia coli, klebsiella, proteus and bacteroides increased by 37.3%. however, in the group of rats administered the bifidobacterium culture, the lactobacillus culture or yogurt, the percentages of the gram-negative rods were decreased. although lactobacillus was a major bacterium in the ileum of normal rats, the gram-negative facultatively anaerobic rods e.coli, klebsiella and proteus were increased in the ulcerated ileum of rats treated with bfmet, suggesting that these bacteria are associated with ulcer formation in rats treated with nsaids, and that lactobacillus and bifidobacterium inhibit it by repressing the growth of ulcer-inducing bacteria.

AB == the antagonistic effect of lactic acid bacteria (lab, including lactobacillus acidophilus, l. bulgaricus, l. casei and streptococcus thermophilus) on staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli was evaluated on mrs agar with the deferred and cross-streaking techniques, and in milk with the plate counting method. all lab were repressive to s aureus and e coli on the agar medium. however, their suppressive activity was significantly reduced when the agar medium was buffered to ph 7.2. in normal milk, l acidophilus strains a and b, s thermophilus and its combinations with l acidophilus a and l bulgaricus 6032 were inhibitory to s aureus, while in mastitic milk, only s thermophilus and its combinations showed inhibition. l acidophilus a and l bulgaricus 34104 were repressive to e coli growth in normal milk. s thermophilus and its combinations were inhibitory to e coli in both the normal and mastitic milk samples. these results indicate that the antagonistic activity of lab on pathogenic bacteria varied with the type of media in which the tests were done, and that testing of in vitro antagonism in milk would be more informative than that in artificial media for in vivo tests concerning the possible roles of competitive microbiological ecology in mastitis control.

TI == effect of candida albicans infection and clotrimazole treatment on vaginal microflora in vitro.
AB == objective: to determine the effect of candida albicans infection and clotrimazole treatment on vaginal microflora. methods: studies were conducted using a model simulating the healthy vaginal ecosystem. the model consisted of a mixed culture of lactobacillus acidophilus, staphylococcus epidermidis, prevotella bivia, and group d streptococcus sp grown in continuous culture in a chemically defined medium. the status of the model was assessed using a mathematical equation that determines the probability a microflora is normal or abnormal. results: challenge of the model with c albicans was followed within 24 hours by the development of microbial populations representing an abnormal microflora. treatment of the system with clotrimazole (100 micrograms/ml) resulted in a decrease in c albicans counts to 0 within 48 hours. however, treatment also altered other components of the vaginal microflora, which did not return to normal. addition of clotrimazole (100 micrograms/ml) to the system in the absence of c albicans also resulted in an abnormal model by 24 hours. conclusions: candida albicans infection of the vaginal ecosystem, as represented by this in vitro model, has a deleterious effect on members of the normal microflora. clotrimazole, although effective against c albicans infection, also has a deleterious effect on components of the normal vaginal microflora. one of the implications for women using clotrimazole for microbiologically undocumented vaginal yeast infections is an increased risk of infection or disease through the disruption of the protective microflora barrier.

AB == epidemiological and in vivo and in vitro experimental studies have suggested that fermented milks may interfere with the emergence and/or the development of colon cancer. the results, however, remain inconclusive. this prompted us to develop a new approach based on the use of ht-29, a cultured human colon cancer cell line, to study at the cellular level the effect of fermented milks on colon cancer cell growth and differentiation characteristics. undifferentiated ht-29 cells have been grown in the continuous presence of milks fermented by one of the following bacterial populations: lactobacillus helveticus, bifidobacterium, l.acidophilus or a mix of streptococcus thermophilus and l. bulgaricus. penicillin g was added to the cell culture medium, resulting in a complete blockade of bacterial growth without significant effect on bacterial viability. one out of the four bacteria species studied, namely l.acidophilus, was without effect on both cell growth and differentiation. the three other bacterial strains induced a significant, although variable, reduction in the growth rate of ht-29 cells, which resulted in a 10-50% decrease in the cell number at steady-state (i.e. at cell confluency). the most efficient strains in lowering the ht-29 growth rate were l. helveticus and bifidobacterium. concomitantly, the specific activities of dipeptidyl peptidase iv (dpp iv), a sensitive and specific marker of ht-29 cell differentiation, and that of three other brush border enzymes (sucrase, aminopeptidase n and alkaline phosphatase) were significantly increased, thus suggesting that these cells may have entered a differentiation process. altogether, these results indicate that the use of cultured colon cancer cells may be a useful tool to further study the effect of fermented milks on colon cancer and that bacterial strains may exert a different and specific effect on cancer cell growth and differentiation when used in fermented milk products.

AB == immunoglobulin molecules in the supernatant fluids (sf) from pulpal explant cultures have been observed to react with microorganisms implicated in infections of root canals. in this study, the reactivity of immunoglobulin molecules in the sf from normal and irreversible pulpitis pulps to six strains of predominant microorganisms isolated from the immediate layer of carious lesions above the pulps used for explant cultures was investigated using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. two atcc strains of eubacterium were also included in this assay. specific antibodies to lactobacillus casei subsp. casei, lactobacillus casei subsp. rhamnosus, lactobacillus acidophilus (i), (ii), streptococcus mutans, bacteroides intermedius, eubacterium brachy, and eubacterium alactolyticum in the sf from the normal and irreversible pulpitis tissues were observed with a large variation of antibody levels in both groups. immunodiffusion assays of the sf revealed that igg was the major class of immunoglobulin in the normal as well as the irreversible groups. the presence of natural antibodies in the normal pulps suggested a possible protective role of antibodies during the invasive process of caries.

TI == noncariogenicity of erythritol as a substrate.
AB == erythritol is a sugar alcohol produced by aureobasidium sp. from glucose. it is 75-80% as sweet as sucrose and is also nonhygroscopic. the aim of this study was to evaluate this sugar substitute from a cariological point of view. erythritol was neither utilized as a substrate for the lactic acid production nor for plaque formation of mutans streptococci (serotypes a-h) and certain oral microorganisms. it was not utilized for water-insoluble glucan synthesis or cellular adherence by glucosyltransferase from streptococcus mutans ps-14 (c) and streptococcus sobrinus 6715 (g). finally, a significantly lower caries score (3.1 +/- 0.5; mean +/- sem) was observed in specific pathogen-free rats infected with s. sobrinus 6715 and fed with a diet containing 26% erythritol, as compared to control rats fed with a diet containing 26% sucrose (60.5 +/- 2.0). also, rats provided a diet containing 56% erythritol chocolate (23.8% erythritol) and challenged with s. mutans ps-14 exhibited a significantly lower caries score (6.7 +/- 0.8) compared to the sucrose chocolate group (82.8 +/- 2.8). the main conclusion from this study is therefore that erythritol is a promising sugar substitute from a cariological point of view.

TI == strains and species of lactic acid bacteria in fermented milks (yogurts): effect  on in vivo lactose digestion.
AB == lactose in yogurt with live bacteria is better tolerated than lactose in other dairy foods, partly because of the activity of microbial beta-galactosidase (beta-gal), which digests lactose in vivo. to evaluate the ability of different strains and species of lactic acid bacteria to digest lactose in vivo, yogurts (containing mixtures of strains of streptococcus salivarius subsp thermophilus and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp bulgaricus) and fermented milks (containing individual species of s thermophilus, l bulgaricus, l acidophilus, or bifidobacterium bifidus) that varied in microbial beta-gal activity were produced. selected products were fed to healthy people who cannot digest lactose, and breath hydrogen production was monitored. all yogurts dramatically and similarly improved lactose digestion, regardless of their total or specific beta-gal activity. the response to fermented milks varied from marginal improvement with b bifidus milk to nearly complete lactose digestion with l bulgaricus milk. the results suggest that total beta-gal was not the limiting factor in promoting lactose digestion, perhaps because of a limited rate of intracellular substrate transport.

AB == lactobacillus acidophilus 88 produced a bacteriocin, designated lactacin f, that  demonstrated inhibitory activity toward l. acidophilus 6032, l. lactis 970, l. helveticus 87, l. bulgaricus 1489, l. leichmanii 4797, l. fermentum 1750, and streptococcus faecalis 19433. production of lactacin f was ph dependent and could be maximized in mrs broth cultures maintained at ph 7.0. lactacin f was heat stable and sensitive to ficin, proteinase k, trypsin, and bacillus subtilis protease. l. acidophilus 88 harbored plasmids of 4 and 27 megadaltons. variants of l. acidophilus 88 which were deficient in lactacin f production (laf) and lactacin f immunity (laf) retained the two resident plasmids. a laf laf derivative, l. acidophilus 89, was used as a recipient in agar surface mating experiments with l. acidophilus 88 (laf laf). two types of laf laf transconjugants were recovered. one type (t-e) had acquired two plasmids of 68 (ppm68) and 52 (ppm52) megadaltons that were not detected in either the conjugal donor or the other type of laf laf transconjugants (t-89). laf and laf were unstable in the plasmid-bearing transconjugant. plasmid analysis of laf laf variants revealed that ppm52 and ppm68 were cured with loss of laf and laf. bacteriocin production and immunity phenotypes were genetically stable in laf laf transconjugants not harboring ppm52 and ppm68, suggesting chromosomal integration of the transferred determinants. the data demonstrated intragenic conjugation in l. acidophilus and provided direct evidence for involvement of transient plasmid determinants in laf and laf.

TI == [bacteriological investigation of the cariogenic effects of sugar alcohols and sucrose].
AB == considerable evidence indicates that the disaccharide, sucrose is probably the major dietary factor in dental caries formation and much subsequent research has gone into the search for another sweetener to replace sucrose. currently, there is much interest in the development of new sweeteners and the cariogenic properties of sugar alcohols. the present study aimed to examine the cariogenic properties of sugar alcohols (xylitol, sorbitol, mannitol) and sucrose on growth pattern and acid production of s. mutans, s. mitis, s. salivarius, s. sanguis, s. faecalis, s. viridans, l. casei and l. acidophilus in vitro by using photo electrical colorimeter and ph meter. in conclusion the results in this study showed that out of sugar alcohols, xylitol is the only compound which, depending on its concentration, significantly did not affect the growth and acid production of all tested micro organisms.

TI == survival of lactic acid bacteria in the human stomach and adhesion to intestinal  cells.
AB == the survival of four strains of lactic acid bacteria in human gastric juice, in vivo and in vitro, and in buffered saline, ph 1 to 5, has been investigated. the strains studied include two lactobacillus acidophilus strains, lactobacillus bulgaricus, and streptococcus thermophilus. in addition, the adhesion of these strains to freshly collected human and pig small intestinal cells and to pig large intestinal cells has been studied and the effect of milk on both survival and adhesion tested. as a result of these investigations, an in vitro test system for screening potential cultures for use as human dietary adjuncts can be developed. the ability to survive in gastric juice and to adhere varied significantly for the strains tested; l. acidophilus adh survived and adhered better than the others while s. thermophilus survived and adhered poorly. for all strains, both survival and adhesion was enhanced by milk. as all strains adhered to some extent to both human and pig intestinal cells, the adhesion mechanism is probably a nonspecific attachment as opposed to other reported specific lactobacillus adhesion to gastric tissue. from the survival and adhesion data it seems feasible to obtain elevated levels of viable lactobacillus sp. in human intestine by careful selection of the bacterial strains ingested. furthermore, the in vitro methods used here should be valuable to screen potential strains. the data presented here can then be correlated with human in vivo studies monitoring the beneficial effect of ingestion of these lactobacillus.

AB == the effects of lactic acid bacterial fermentation on chemical and physical changes in aqueous extracts of cowpea (vigna unguiculata), peanut (arachis hypogea), soybean (glycine max), and sorghum (sorghum vulgare) were studied. the bacteria investigated were lactobacillus helveticus, l. delbrueckii, l. casei, l. bulgaricus, l. acidophilus, and streptococcus thermophilus. organisms were inoculated individually into all of the seed extracts; l. bulgaricus and s. thermophilus were also evaluated together as inocula for fermenting the legume extracts. during fermentation, bacterial population and changes in titratable acidity, ph, viscosity, and color were measured over a 72-h period at 37 degrees c. maximum bacterial populations, titratable acidity, ph, and viscosity varied depending upon the type of extract and bacterial strain. the maximum population of each organism was influenced by fermentable carbohydrates, which, in turn, influenced acid production and change in ph. change in viscosity was correlated with the amount of protein and titratable acidity of products. color was affected by pasteurization treatment and fermentation as well as the source of extract. in the extracts inoculated simultaneously with l. bulgaricus and s. thermophilus, a synergistic effect resulted in increased bacterial populations, titratable acidity, and viscosity, and decreased ph in all the legume extracts when compared to the extracts fermented with either of these organisms individually. fermented extracts offer potential as substitutes for cultured dairy products.

(int. j. syst. bacteriol. 30:53-68, 1980) demonstrated that production of the bacteriocin lactacin b could not be used in classification of neotype l. acidophilus strains. however, the usefulness of employing sensitivity to lactacin b in classification of dairy lactobacilli is suggested.

AB == an attempt was made to protect rhesus monkeys from dental caries by immunisation  with streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus acidophilus and lipoteichoic acid (lta). the vaccine composed of s. mutans gave significant protection against caries, a decrease in the number of s. mutans, an increase in igg antibodies and a moderate increase in complement-fixing antibodies to lta. when lta was used as immunogen, there was only a small reduction in caries, without any detectable antibodies to lta and a slight increase in igg antibodies to cell of s. mutans. vaccines of l. acidophilus or l. fermentum gave no protection. a combined vaccine of s. mutans and l. acidophilus did not reduce the incidence of caries but the antibody titre to cells of s. mutans was raised to a level comparable with that in the s. mutans-immunised monkeys. the results of this investigation in a subhuman primate confirm that immunisation with s. mutans induces protection against caries, unlike the attempt to immunise with two selected strains of lactobacilli. more studies are required to establish the role of specific serotypes of lactobacilli in the development of dental caries.

AB == recent studies on the etiology and prevention of dental caries are synthetized. caries is an infectious disease produced by the bacterial plaque where microorganisms act upon hydrocarbon substrate producing acids (lactic, pyruvic, acetic, etc.). these acids decalcify the enamel surface producing the carious cavity. the three types of caries are mentioned: 1. the sucrose-dependent caries on the free surfaces of the tooth with the streptococcus mutans predominance. 2. the pits and fissures caries with lactobacillus acidophilus predominance. 3. the root caries with acinomyces viscosus predominance. caries prevention points out to three aspects. 1. increasing tooth resistance through the use of ingested fluoride and/or topical fluorides and pits and fissure sealants. 2. a profuse and promising research work on control of microbial plaque is being done. meanwhile, the correct and periodically controlled toothbrushing is still the most efficient preventive measure. 3. diet control. being carbohydrates a deep rooted habit of our modern culture, its control has to be carefully evaluated. a judicious and reduced strategic consumption of carbohydrates and the use of substitutes are useful ways of achieving the preventive aims.

TI == effects of eimeria brunetti on intestinal ph in conventional and gnotobiotic chickens.
AB == white leghorn cockerels, 2-4 weeks of age, inoculated with sporulated oocysts of  eimeria brunetti had a lower mean ph in the middle and lower small intestine than did uninoculated controls by 5-9 days post-inoculation. no effect of the infection on ph was seen in the upper intestine while ph in the gizzard and caeca was occasionally higher than in controls. magnitude of ph. decrease did not correlate with increases in oocyst dosage and severity of infection as measured by lesion score. studies with germ-free (gf) and gnotobiotic chicks showed that host bacterial flora was essential for a ph decrease in the middle and lower small intestine with e. brunetti infection. inoculation of gf birds with lactobacillus acidophilus or l. acidophilus plus streptococcus faecalis, in addition to e. brunetti resulted in some decrease in ph.

TI == mutanolysin, bacteriolytic agent for cariogenic streptococci: partial purification and properties.
AB == mutanolysin partially purified from the culture filtrate of streptomyces globisporus 1829 consists of two main lytic enzymes with an isoelectric point near ph 8.5 and 10, respectively, and proteolytic enzyme is associated with the latter lytic enzyme. mutanolysin exhibited maximal lytic activity at 60 c in the ph range 6.5 to 7.0 and was stable at 50 c in the acid range. n-bromosuccinimide caused complete inhibition of lytic activity at 1 mm, whereas calcium and magnesium ions at the same concentration caused activation. mutanolysin had lytic or bactericidal activity against the living cells of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sanguis, lactobacillus acidophilus, and actinomyces viscosus, which are considered to be etiologic agents of dental caries, but had no activity against s. aureus and all gram-negative strains tested. the lytic activity was well retained in human saliva. digestion of the cell walls of s. mutans bht by mutanolysin was accompanied by the liberation of free amino groups and reducing sugars. mutanolysin may be expected to be a useful agent for dental caries control.

TI == indirect fluorescent-antibody method for the identification of corynebacterium vaginale.
AB == the indirect fluorescent-antibody technique was employed in an attempt to develop a rapid method of identification of corynebacterium vaginale. six reference strains and ten clinical isolates selected on the basis of morphology and conventional biochemical tests were compared. antisera were prepared in rabbits against the six reference strains. the most satisfactory antiserum was that prepared using strain 14018 grown diphasically (14018 di) as the antigen. certain of the antisera did exhibit a cross-reacting titer when reacted against corynebacterium diptheriae, corynebacterium xerosis, or lactobacillus acidophilus. however, antisera adsorbed with these bacteria did not exhibit a significant decrease in titer when reacted against the homologous strain. various other species of corynebacterium as well as species of nocardia, actinomyces, hemophilus, and streptococcus did not fluoresce with the antisera. a specific antiserum was prepared by adsorbing anti-14018 di with l. acidophilus. the adsorption removed the cross-reacting antibody but did not affect the staining reaction with c. vaginale strains. all reference strains and clinical isolates characterized as c. vaginale gave a definite positive reaction with the adsorbed anti-14018 di. the specificity of the reactions was assessed by adsorbing the antiserum with the homologous strain. the data suggest that the indirect staining method will be of value in the rapid presumptive identification of c. vaginale.

AB == proteins in sonic extracts of streptococcus lactis were separated by starch-gel electrophoresis at high voltage. each slab was sliced longitudinally, and half was stained for peptidases in a mixture containing a peptide, l-amino acid oxidase (snake venom), peroxidase, and o-dianisdine; the other half was stained in amido black for protein. in addition to sonic treatment, trypsin also released enzyme from acetone-treated cells. glycyl-l-phenylalanine, l-phenylalanyl-glycine, l-alanyl-l-phenylalanine, and l-phenylalanyl-l-alanine served as substrates in characterizing the enzymes. five different fractions of various specificities appeared in the gels. broad-range substrate specificities were found for sonic extracts of s. lactis, s. cremoris, s. durans, and lactobacillus acidophilus.

AB == we have extended our investigation of nicotinamide deamidation in the stomach of  conventional rats. the bacterial species in the pars preventricularis were identified as flavobacterium peregrinum, escherichia coli, streptococcus faecalis, and lactobacillus acidophilus, listed in order of decreasing deamidase activity. nicotinamide-7-(14)c ingested into rat stomach was rapidly deamidated to nicotinic acid. these results contribute to the accumulated evidence that microorganisms present in the pars preventricularis of rat stomach are responsible for the deamidation of nicotinamide to nicotinic acid, a known precursor of mammalian pyridine nucleotides.

TI == common individual antigenic determinants in five of eight balb-c iga myeloma proteins that bind phosphoryl choline.
AB == eight iga myeloma proteins derived from independently induced plasma-cytomas in genetically similar inbred balb/c mice are functionally related by their binding of phosphoryl choline-containing antigens (pneumococcus c polysaccharide or lactobacillus antigen). each protein resembles a single species of immunoglobulin in antibody. the proteins are characterized by highly sensitive myeloma-specific antisera prepared by immunizing mice of other inbred strains with the balb/c myeloma proteins. individual or myeloma-specific determinants located on fab fragments were found on three of the proteins that were unique for that protein and did not react with any other iga protein among over 70 tested. remarkably, five of the proteins shared two common myeloma-specific determinants which were specific for this group of five proteins. these results suggest that the five functionally and genetically related proteins sharing the same myeloma-specific determinants might also be structurally similar.
