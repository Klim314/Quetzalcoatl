TI  == consumption of partially hydrolysed guar gum stimulates bifidobacteria and butyrate-producing bacteria in the human large intestine.
AB  == partially hydrolysed guar gum (phgg) is a water-soluble dietary fibre that is non-digestible in the upper gastrointestinal tract. it is believed that phgg benefits the health of hosts by altering the colonic microbiota and stimulating short-chain fatty acid (scfa) production. however, it remains unclear which bacteria ferment phgg in the human large intestine. in this study, the effect of  phgg on faecal bacteria was analysed to specify the bacteria that contribute to the fermentation of phgg in the human large intestine. ten healthy volunteers consumed phgg (6 g/day) for 2 weeks. faeces were collected at 2 weeks prior to consumption, at the end of 2 weeks of consumption, and 2 weeks after consumption  of phgg. bacterial dna was extracted from these collected faeces and subjected to real-time pcr using bacterial group- or species-specific primers. the copy number of the butyryl-coa coa-transferase gene and the 16s rrna gene copy numbers of bifidobacterium, the clostridium coccoides group, the roseburia/ eubacterium rectale group, eubacterium hallii, and butyrate-producing bacterium strain ss2/1  were significantly increased by the intake of phgg. other bacteria and bacterial  groups were not significantly influenced by the intake of phgg. it was believed that the roseburia/e. rectale group bacteria, bifidobacterium, the lactate-utilising, butyrate-producing bacteria, e. hallii and bacterium strain ss2/1, would contribute to the fermentation of phgg in the human large intestine. phgg may benefit health by stimulating bifidobacterium and butyrate-producing bacteria in the human large intestine.

TI  == diversity of human colonic butyrate-producing bacteria revealed by analysis of the butyryl-coa:acetate coa-transferase gene.
AB  == butyrate-producing bacteria play an important role in the human colon, supplying  energy to the gut epithelium and regulating host cell responses. in order to explore the diversity and culturability of this functional group, we designed degenerate primers to amplify butyryl-coa:acetate coa-transferase sequences from  faecal samples provided by 10 healthy volunteers. eighty-eight per cent of amplified sequences showed >98% dna sequence identity to coa-transferases from cultured butyrate-producing bacteria, and these fell into 12 operational taxonomic units (otus). the four most prevalent otus corresponded to eubacterium  rectale, roseburia faecis, eubacterium hallii and an unnamed cultured species ss2/1. the remaining 12% of sequences, however, belonged to 20 otus that are assumed to come from uncultured butyrate-producing strains. samples taken after ingestion of inulin showed significant (p=0.019) increases in faecalibacterium prausnitzii. because several of the dominant butyrate producers differ in their dna % g+c content, analysis of thermal melt curves obtained for pcr amplicons of  the butyryl-coa:acetate coa-transferase gene provides a convenient and rapid qualitative assessment of the major butyrate producing groups present in a given  sample. this type of analysis therefore provides an excellent source of information on functionally important groups within the colonic microbial community.

TI  == genetic diversity of viable, injured, and dead fecal bacteria assessed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting and 16s rrna gene analysis.
AB  == a novel approach combining a flow cytometric in situ viability assay with 16s rrna gene analysis was used to study the relationship between diversity and activity of the fecal microbiota. simultaneous staining with propidium iodide (pi) and syto bc provided clear discrimination between intact cells (49%), injured or damaged cells (19%), and dead cells (32%). the three subpopulations were sorted and characterized by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) of 16s rrna gene amplicons obtained from the total and bifidobacterial communities. this analysis revealed that not only the total community but also the distinct subpopulations are characteristic for each individual. cloning and sequencing of the dominant bands of the dgge patterns showed that most of clones  retrieved from the live, injured, and dead fractions belonged to clostridium coccoides, clostridium leptum, and bacteroides. we found that some of the butyrate-producing related bacteria, such as eubacterium rectale and eubacterium  hallii, were obviously viable at the time of sampling. however, amplicons affiliated with bacteroides and ruminococcus obeum- and eubacterium biforme-like  bacteria, as well as butyrivibrio crossotus, were obtained especially from the dead population. furthermore, some bacterial clones were recovered from all sorted fractions, and this was especially noticeable for the clostridium leptum cluster. the bifidobacterial phylotypes identified in total samples and sorted fractions were assigned to bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium longum,  bifidobacterium infantis, bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum, and bifidobacterium  bifidum. phylogenetic analysis of the live, dead, and injured cells revealed a remarkable physiological heterogeneity within these bacterial populations; b. longum and b. infantis were retrieved from all sorted fractions, while b. adolescentis was recovered mostly from the sorted dead fraction.

TI  == lactate-utilizing bacteria, isolated from human feces, that produce butyrate as a major fermentation product.
AB  == the microbial community of the human colon contains many bacteria that produce lactic acid, but lactate is normally detected only at low concentrations (<5 mm)  in feces from healthy individuals. it is not clear, however, which bacteria are mainly responsible for lactate utilization in the human colon. here, bacteria able to utilize lactate and produce butyrate were identified among isolates obtained from 10(-8) dilutions of fecal samples from five different subjects. out of nine such strains identified, four were found to be related to eubacterium hallii and two to anaerostipes caccae, while the remaining three represent a new  species within clostridial cluster xiva based on their 16s rrna sequences. significant ability to utilize lactate was not detected in the butyrate-producing species roseburia intestinalis, eubacterium rectale, or faecalibacterium prausnitzii. whereas e. hallii and a. caccae strains used both d- and l-lactate,  the remaining strains used only the d form. addition of glucose to batch cultures prevented lactate utilization until the glucose became exhausted. however, when two e. hallii strains and one a. caccae strain were grown in separate cocultures  with a starch-utilizing bifidobacterium adolescentis isolate, with starch as the  carbohydrate energy source, the l-lactate produced by b. adolescentis became undetectable and butyrate was formed. such cross-feeding may help to explain the  reported butyrogenic effect of certain dietary substrates, including resistant starch. the abundance of e. hallii in particular in the colonic ecosystem suggests that these bacteria play important roles in preventing lactate accumulation.
