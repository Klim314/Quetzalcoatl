TI  == a novel multi-strain probiotic and synbiotic supplement for prevention of clostridium difficile infection in a murine model.
AB  == the protective effect of a multi-strain probiotic and synbiotic formulation was evaluated in c57bl/6 mice infected with clostridium difficile (cd) nap1/027. antibiotic-treated mice were divided into the following four groups: group 1, fed with a synbiotic formulation consisting of lactobacillus plantarum f44, l. paracasei f8, bifidobacterium breve 46, b. lactis 8:8, galacto-oligosaccharides,  isomalto-oligosaccharides, and resistant starch; group 2, fed with the same four  probiotic strains as group 1; group 3, fed with the same prebiotic supplements as group 1 for 7 days before cd infection; and group 4 (control group) antibiotic treated and infected with nap1/027 strain. feces and cecal contents were collected for microbial cell viability, quantitative pcr (qpcr), toxin analyses and histopathology. synbiotics- and probiotics-fed mice showed a significant increase in total bifidobacteria (p < 0.05). the total lactobacilli count was increased in group 1. tests for cecal toxins were negative in group 2 mice, whereas one sample each from group 1 and 3 was positive. qpcr of cecal contents showed significant reduction in nap1/027 dna copies in groups 1 and 2 and significantly higher numbers of b. breve 46, l. plantarum f44, and l. paracasei f8 in groups 1 and 2 (p < 0.05); these changes were much less pronounced in groups 3 and 4. our findings indicate that the newly developed synbiotic or multi-strain probiotic formulation confers protection against nap1/027 infection  in c57bl/6 mice. this holds promise for performing human studies.

TI  == influence of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis against group b streptococcus on  the early newborn gut composition and evaluation of the anti-streptococcus activity of bifidobacterium strains.
AB  == several factors are known to influence the early colonization of the gut in newborns. among them, the use of antibiotics on the mother during labor, referred to as intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (iap), has scarcely been investigated, although this practice is routinely used in group b streptococcus (gbs)-positive  women. this work is therefore aimed at verifying whether iap can influence the main microbial groups of the newborn gut microbiota at an early stage of microbial establishment. fifty-two newborns were recruited: 26 born by mothers negative to gbs (control group) and 26 by mothers positive to gbs and subjected to iap with ampicillin (iap group). selected microbial groups (lactobacillus spp., bidobacterium spp., bacteroides fragilis, clostridium difficile, and escherichia coli) were quantified with real-time pcr on dna extracted from newborn feces. further analysis was performed within the bidobacterium genus by using dgge after amplification with genus-specific primers. results obtained showed a significant decrease of the bifidobacteria counts after antibiotic treatment of the mother. bifidobacteria were found to be affected by iap not only quantitatively but also qualitatively. in fact, iap determined a decrement in the frequency of bidobacterium breve, bidobacterium bifidum, and bidobacterium dentium with respect to the control group. moreover, this study has preliminarily evaluated that some bifidobacterial strains, previously selected for use in infants, have antibacterial properties against gbs and are therefore potential candidates for being applied as probiotics for the prevention of gbs infections.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of antimicrobial activity of lactic acid bacteria against clostridium difficile.
AB  == clostridium difficile infection (cdi) has become a significant threat to public health. although broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy is the primary treatment option for cdi, its use has evident limitations. probiotics have been proved to be effective in the treatment of cdi and are a promising therapeutic option for cdi. in this study, 4 strains of lactic acid bacteria (lab), namely, lactobacillus rhamnosus (lr5), lactococcuslactis (sl3), bifidobacterium breve (br3), and bifidobacterium lactis (bl3) were evaluated for their anti-c. difficile activity. co-culture incubation of c. difficile (10(6) and 10(10) cfu/ml) with each strain of lab indicated that sl3 possessed the highest antimicrobial activity over a 24-hr period. the cell-free supernatants of the 4 lab strains exhibited mic50 values between 0.424 mg/ml (sl3) and 1.318 (br3) mg/ml. these results may provide a basis for alternative therapies for the treatment of c. difficile-associated gut disorders.

TI  == antipathogenic activity of probiotics against salmonella typhimurium and clostridium difficile in anaerobic batch culture systems: is it due to synergies  in probiotic mixtures or the specificity of single strains?
AB  == probiotics are currently being investigated for prevention of infections caused by enteric pathogens. the aim of this in vitro study was to evaluate the influence of three single probiotics: lactobacillus casei ncimb 30185 (pxn 37), lactobacillus acidophilus ncimb 30184 (pxn 35), bifidobacterium breve ncimb 30180 (pxn 25) and a probiotic mixture containing the above strains plus twelve other strains belonging to the lactobacillus, bifidobacterium, lactococcus, streptococcus and bacillus genera on the survival of salmonella typhimurium and clostridium difficile using ph-controlled anaerobic batch cultures containing mixed faecal bacteria. changes in relevant bacterial groups and effects of probiotic addition on survival of the two pathogens were assessed over 24 h. quantitative analysis of bacterial populations revealed that there was a significant increase in lactobacilli and/or bifidobacteria numbers, depending on  probiotic addition, compared with the control (no added probiotic). there was also a significant reduction in s. typhimurium and c. difficile numbers in the presence of certain probiotics compared with controls. of the probiotic treatments, two single strains namely l. casei ncimb 30185 (pxn 37), and b. breve ncimb 30180 (pxn 25) were the most potent in reducing the numbers of s. typhimurium and c. difficile. in addition, the supplementation with probiotics into the systems influenced some fermentations parameters. acetate was found in the largest concentrations in all vessels and lactate and formate were generally  detected in higher amounts in vessels with probiotic addition compared to controls.

TI  == prebiotic-non-digestible oligosaccharides preference of probiotic bifidobacteria  and antimicrobial activity against clostridium difficile.
AB  == bifidobacterium breve 46, bifidobacterium lactis 8:8 and bifidobacterium longum 6:18 and three reference strains b. breve ccug 24611, b. lactis jcm 10602, and bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum jcm 1200 were examined for acid and bile tolerance, prebiotic utilization and antimicrobial activity against four clostridium difficile (cd) strains including the hypervirulent strain, pcr ribotype nap1/027. b. lactis 8:8 and b. lactis jcm 10602 exhibited a high tolerance in mrsc broth with ph 2.5 for 30 min. b. breve 46 and b. lactis 8:8 remained 100% viable in mrsc broth with 5% porcine bile after 4 h. all six strains showed a high prebiotic degrading ability (prebiotic score) with galactooligosaccharides (gos), isomaltooligosaccharides (imos) and lactulose as carbon sources and moderate degradation of fructooligosaccharides (fos). xylooligosaccharides (xos) was metabolized to a greater extent by b. lactis 8:8,  b. lactis jcm 10602, b. pseudocatenulatum jcm 1200 and b. longum 6:18 (prebiotic  score >50%). all strains exhibited extracellular antimicrobial activity (ama) against four cd strains including the cd nap1/027. ama of b. breve 46, b. lactis  8:8 and b. lactis jcm 10602 strains was mainly ascribed to a combined action of organic acids and heat stable, protease sensitive antimicrobial peptides when cells were grown in mrsc broth with glucose and by acids when grown with five different prebiotic-non-digestible oligosaccharides (ndos). none of c. difficile  strains degraded five prebiotic-ndos. whole cells of b. breve 46 and b. lactis 8:8 and their supernatants inhibited the growth and toxin production of the cd nap1/027 strain.

TI  == effects of probiotics and antibiotics on the intestinal homeostasis in a computer controlled model of the large intestine.
AB  == background: antibiotic associated diarrhea and clostridium difficile infection are frequent complications of broad spectrum antibiotic therapy. probiotic bacteria are used as therapeutic and preventive agents in these disorders, but the exact functional mechanisms and the mode of action are poorly understood. the effects of clindamycin and the probiotic mixture vsl#3 (containing the 8 bacterial strains streptococcus thermophilus, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium infantis, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus paracasei and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus) consecutively or in combination were investigated and compared to controls without therapy using a standardized human fecal microbiota in a computer-controlled in vitro model of large intestine. microbial metabolites (short chain fatty acids, lactate, branched chain fatty acids, and ammonia) and the intestinal microbiota were analyzed. results: compared to controls and combination therapy, short chain fatty acids and lactate, but also ammonia and branched chain fatty acids, were increased under probiotic therapy. the metabolic pattern under combined therapy with antibiotics and probiotics had the most beneficial and consistent effect on intestinal metabolic profiles. the intestinal microbiota showed a decrease in several indigenous bacterial groups under antibiotic therapy, there was no significant recovery of these groups when the antibiotic therapy was followed by administration of probiotics. simultaneous application of anti- and probiotics had a stabilizing effect on the intestinal microbiota with increased bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. conclusions: administration of vsl#3 parallel with the clindamycin therapy had a beneficial and stabilizing effect on the intestinal metabolic homeostasis by decreasing toxic metabolites and protecting the endogenic microbiota from destruction. probiotics could be a reasonable strategy in prevention of antibiotic associated  disturbances of the intestinal homeostasis and disorders.

TI  == early colonization with a group of lactobacilli decreases the risk for allergy at five years of age despite allergic heredity.
AB  == background: microbial deprivation early in life can potentially influence immune  mediated disease development such as allergy. the aims of this study were to investigate the influence of parental allergy on the infant gut colonization and  associations between infant gut microbiota and allergic disease at five years of  age. methods and findings: fecal samples were collected from 58 infants, with allergic or non-allergic parents respectively, at one and two weeks as well as at one, two and twelve months of life. dna was extracted from the fecal samples and  real time pcr, using species-specific primers, was used for detection of bifidobacterium (b.) adolescentis, b. breve, b. bifidum, clostridium (c.) difficile, a group of lactobacilli (lactobacillus (l.) casei, l. paracasei and l. rhamnosus) as well as staphylococcus (s.) aureus. infants with non-allergic parents were more frequently colonized by lactobacilli compared to infants with allergic parents (p = 0.014). however, non-allergic five-year olds acquired lactobacilli more frequently during their first weeks of life, than their allergic counterparts, irrespectively of parental allergy (p = 0.009, p = 0.028). further the non-allergic children were colonized with lactobacilli on more occasions during the first two months of life (p = 0.038). also, significantly more non-allergic children were colonized with b. bifidum at one week of age than the children allergic at five years (p = 0.048). conclusion: in this study we show that heredity for allergy has an impact on the gut microbiota in infants but also that early lactobacilli (l. casei, l. paracasei, l. rhamnosus) colonization  seems to decrease the risk for allergy at five years of age despite allergic heredity.

TI  == growth-inhibiting activities of phenethyl isothiocyanate and its derivatives against intestinal bacteria.
AB  == the growth-inhibiting activities of sinapis alba l. seed-derived materials were examined on the growth of bifidobacterium bifidum, b. breve, b. longum, clostridium difficile, c. perfringens, escherichia coli, lactobacillus acidophilus, and l. casei. the active component of s. alba seeds was purified using silica gel column chromatography and hplc and was identified as phenethyl isothiocyanate by various spectroscopic analyses. the antimicrobial activity of phenethyl isothiocyanate varied according to the dose and bacterial strain tested. phenethyl isothiocyanate strongly inhibited the growth of c. difficile and c. perfringens at 1 mg/disc, and weakly (+) inhibited its growth at 0.1 mg/disc. furthermore, phenethyl isothiocyanate moderately (++) inhibited the growth of e. coli at a dose of 2 mg/disc, but did not inhibit the growth of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. addition of various functional groups to isothiocyanates resulted in selective inhibitory activity against harmful bacteria with low concentrations of aromatic isothiocyanates demonstrating greater inhibitory activity against clostridia and e. coli than aliphatic isothiocyanates. in conclusion, aromatic isothiocyanates containing phenethyl-, benzyl-, and benzoyl-groups might be useful in the development of novel preventive and therapeutic agents against diseases caused by harmful intestinal bacteria.

TI  == [effect of biapenem (l-627) on fecal flora in gnotobiotic mice and children].
AB  == biapenem (l-627), a novel injectable carbapenem antibiotic, was studied with regard to its effect on mice inoculated with four types of bacteria and on the intestinal flora of pediatric patients. l-627 was given i.m., 40 mg/kg once daily for 5 consecutive days, to mice inoculated enterically with four types of bacteria (escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, bacteroides fragilis, and bifidobacterium breve). except for a mild decrease in e. coli, there were no major fluctuations in viable bacterial counts in the feces during the treatment.  five children with bacterial infections (3 boys and 2 girls; ages: 1 month to 7 years and 7 months; body weights 4.62-21.8 kg) were given l-627 at 6.0 to 11.7 mg/kg 3 times daily for 7 to 11 days. among aerobes, although enterobacteriaceae  such as e. coli tended to decrease remarkably in all patients, there was no major change in enterococcus. consequently, total aerobe counts did not change significantly in any patient. among anaerobes, bifidobacterium, bacteroides, and  eubacterium, which are the predominant organisms in infants, decreased remarkably in some patients. one of the patients showed a marked decrease in total anaerobe  count associated with a change in fecal characteristics (diarrhea). glucose nonfermenting gram-negative bacilli or fungi did not become predominant organisms in any patient. recovery from these changes in the intestinal flora was noted promptly after terminating l-627 treatment. l-627 was detected in the feces of 4  patients during treatment. the fecal concentration ranged from 0.24 to 2.22 micrograms/g. clostridium difficile was not detected in any patient. although c.  difficile d-1 antigen was observed in 2 patients, it bore no relationship to fecal properties. the results indicated that l-627 had relatively few effects on  the intestinal flora compared to other new beta-lactam antibiotics.

TI  == [the influence of cefdinir on the intestinal bacterial flora].
AB  == the influence of cefdinir (cfdn), a new oral cephalosporin, on the intestinal bacterial flora was studied in tetra-contaminated mice and in pediatric patients. cfdn in fine granules was administered at a dose of 10 mg/kg once a day for 5 consecutive days to mice contaminated with 4 different species of organism: escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, bacteroides fragilis and bifidobacterium breve. no remarkable changes were observed in the fecal viable cell counts except that decreases in e. coli counts were observed on the day 3 to 5 after starting administration. the subjects in pediatric study were 7 children with infections,  3 boys and 4 girls, with their ages from 6 months to 12 years 7 months. their body weights ranged from 5.5 to 29.2 kg. cfdn fine granules was administered at each dose of 3.0 mg/kg to 3.7 mg/kg, 3 times a day for 4 to 14 days. during the administration of cfdn, some variations were observed in the pattern of changes in the fecal bacterial flora between subjects. although enterobacteriaceae and total counts of anaerobes were markedly decreased in 2 cases, total counts of aerobes were unchanged in the 2 cases, whereas main aerobes and anaerobes except  enterococci hardly varied in the other cases. there was no case in which glucose  non-fermenting gram-negative rods and fungi became predominant species continually. although clostridium difficile and c. difficile d-1 antigens were detected in 1 and 4 cases, respectively, no relationship was found between the number of c. difficile and the characteristics of the feces. with regard to the drug sensitivities of bacteria isolated from feces before and after administration of cfdn, higher levels of resistance were found in some bacteria such as enterococcus and bacteroides during or after administration than before administration. cfdn was detected in fecal samples from 2 cases during administration with concentrations ranging between 0.99-254 micrograms/g. high value of cfdn was found in a case with low beta-lactamase activity in feces, in which marked decrease of enterobacteriaceae and total counts of anaerobes was observed. the above results suggest that cfdn is considered to be a drug with relatively small influence on the intestinal bacterial flora. but as high concentrations of drugs were detected in feces under some circumstances, our attention will be required. particular care is also required for the occurrence of diarrhea and microbial replacement during continuous, long-term administration of the drug.

TI  == the intestinal microflora of infants: composition of fecal flora in breast-fed and bottle-fed infants.
AB  == the fecal flora of 35 breast-fed and 35 bottle-fed babies was determined. bifidobacteria were the predominant fecal bacteria in both groups. conversely, the counts of most of the other bacteria, such as bacteroides, eubacteria, peptococci, veillonella, clostridia, enterobacteria, streptococci, and bacilli in the bottle-fed group were significantly higher than those in the breast-fed group. the frequencies of occurrence of lecithinase positive clostridia, clostridia-others, pseudomonas and bacilli in the bottle-fed group were significantly higher than those in the breast-fed group. twenty-one genera and 103 species or biovars of microorganisms were isolated from the feces of the breast-fed group and 20 genera and 97 species or biovars from the bottle-fed group. the organism that showed the highest number and the highest frequency of occurrence in both groups was bifidobacterium breve. bifidobacterium infantis, which was formerly the most prevalent bifidobacterium species in baby feces, was  never isolated in this study. further, the counts and incidences of clostridium paraputrificum, c. perfringens, and bacillus subtilis, the counts of c. clostridiiforme, bacteroides vulgatus, veillonella parvula, lactobacillus acidophilus, escherichia coli, streptococcus bovis, s. faecalis, and s. faecium and the incidences of c. difficile, c. tertium, and pseudomonas aeruginosa in the bottle-fed infants were significantly higher than those in the breast-fed infants.
