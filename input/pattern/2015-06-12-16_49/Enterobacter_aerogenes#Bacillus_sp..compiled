TI  - Pyrosequencing analysis of microbial community and food-borne bacteria on restaurant cutting boards collected in Seri Kembangan, Malaysia, and their correlation with grades of food premises.
AB  - This study adopts the pyrosequencing technique to identify bacteria present on 26 kitchen cutting boards collected from different grades of food premises around Seri Kembangan, a city in Malaysia. Pyrosequencing generated 452,401 of total reads of OTUs with an average of 1.4x10(7) bacterial cells/cm(2). Proteobacteria, Firmicutes and Bacteroides were identified as the most abundant phyla in the samples. Taxonomic richness was generally high with >1000 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) observed across all samples. The highest appearance frequencies (100%) were OTUs closely related to Enterobacter sp., Enterobacter aerogenes, Pseudomonas sp. and Pseudomonas putida. Several OTUs were identified most closely related to known food-borne pathogens, including Bacillus cereus, Cronobacter sakazaki, Cronobacter turisensis, Escherichia coli, E. coli O157:H7, Hafnia alvei, Kurthia gibsonii, Salmonella bongori, Salmonella enterica, Salmonella paratyphi, Salmonella tyhpi, Salmonella typhimurium and Yersinia enterocolitica ranging from 0.005% to 0.68% relative abundance. The condition and grade of the food premises on a three point cleanliness scale did not correlate with the bacterial abundance and type. Regardless of the status and grades, all food premises have the same likelihood to introduce food-borne bacteria from cutting boards to their foods and must always prioritize the correct food handling procedure in order to avoid unwanted outbreak of food-borne illnesses.
TI  - A sequential statistical approach towards an optimized production of a broad spectrum bacteriocin substance from a soil bacterium Bacillus sp. YAS 1 strain.
AB  - Bacteriocins, ribosomally synthesized antimicrobial peptides, display potential applications in agriculture, medicine, and industry. The present study highlights integral statistical optimization and partial characterization of a bacteriocin substance from a soil bacterium taxonomically affiliated as Bacillus sp. YAS 1 after biochemical and molecular identifications. A sequential statistical approach (Plackett-Burman and Box-Behnken) was employed to optimize bacteriocin (BAC YAS 1) production. Using optimal levels of three key determinants (yeast extract (0.48% (w/v), incubation time (62 hrs), and agitation speed (207 rpm)) in peptone yeast beef based production medium resulted in 1.6-fold enhancement in BAC YAS 1 level (470 AU/mL arbitrary units against Erwinia amylovora). BAC YAS 1 showed activity over a wide range of pH (1-13) and temperature (45-80 degrees C). A wide spectrum antimicrobial activity of BAC YAS 1 against the human pathogens (Clostridium perfringens, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Campylobacter jejuni, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterococcus sp., Proteus sp., Klebsiella sp., and Salmonella typhimurium), the plant pathogen (E. amylovora), and the food spoiler (Listeria innocua) was demonstrated. On top and above, BAC YAS 1 showed no antimicrobial activity towards lactic acid bacteria (Lactobacillus bulgaricus, L. casei, L. lactis, and L. reuteri). Promising characteristics of BAC YAS 1 prompt its commercialization for efficient utilization in several industries.
TI  - Production of humic substances through coal-solubilizing bacteria.
AB  - In this paper, the production of humic substances (HS) through the bacterial solubilization of low rank coal (LRC) was evaluated. The evaluation was carried out by 19 bacterial strains isolated in microenvironments with high contents of coal wastes. The biotransformed LRC and the HS produced were quantified in vitro in a liquid growth medium. The humic acids (HA) obtained from the most active bacterial strain were characterized via elemental composition (C, H, N, O), IR analyses, and the E4/E6 ratio; they were then compared with the HA extracted chemically using NaOH. There was LRC biotransformation ranged from 25 to 37%, and HS production ranged from 127 to 3100 mg . L(-1). More activity was detected in the isolated strains of Bacillus mycoides, Microbacterium sp, Acinetobacter sp, and Enterobacter aerogenes. The HA produced by B. mycoides had an IR spectrum and an E4/E6 ratio similar to those of the HA extracted with NAOH, but their elemental composition and their degree of aromatic condensation was different. Results suggest that these bacteria can be used to exploit the LRC resulting from coal mining activities and thus produce HS in order to improve the content of humified organic matter in soils.
TI  - Purification of a secreted lectin from Andrias davidianus skin and its antibacterial activity.
AB  - A lectin secreted from Andrias davidianus skin (ADL) was purified by affinity chromatography on porcine stomach mucin (type III) (PSM)-crosslinked albumin, followed by gel filtration on Sephadex G-100 and HPLC on TSK gel G3000PWXL. The purified lectin was found to be a dimeric protein, as revealed by SDS-PAGE and MALDI-TOF analysis. SDS-PAGE showed that the ADL protein had a molecular mass of 17 kDa. ADL produced an 8.5 kDa band when examined using SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. ADL agglutinated native and trypsinized human B erythrocytes. The hemagglutination activity was inhibited by glycoproteins, such as PSM and asialo-PSM, but not by any of the monosaccharides tested. The activity was stable between 4 degrees C and 50 degrees C. Significant ADL activity was observed between pH 4-5. The lectin reaction did not depend on the presence of the divalent cation Ca2+ or Mg2+. The N-terminal ADL sequence was determined to be VGYTVGATPM. The lectin exhibited antibacterial activity, involving growth and respiration inhibition in Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis and Shewanella sp. Furthermore, ADL showed inhibition activity against the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These findings suggest that ADL plays an important role in the innate immunity of A. davidianus on the body surface.
TI  - Cytotoxic (A549) and antimicrobial effects of Methylobacterium sp. isolate (ERI-135) from Nilgiris forest soil, India.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the antimicrobial and cytotoxic effects of Methylobacterium  sp. isolated from soil sample of Doddabetta forest, Nilgiris, Western Ghats of Tamil Nadu. METHODS: Isolation of Methylobacterium was performed from soils by serial dilution plate technique. The strain was grown in modified nutrient gulucose agar (MNGA) medium to study the morphology and biochemical characteristics. Methylobacterium sp. was screened for its antimicrobial activity against pathogenic bacteria and fungi. The strain was subjected to 16S rRNA analysis and was identified as Methylobacterium sp. The nucleotide sequence of the 16S rRNA gene of the isolate exhibited close similarity with other Methylobacterium sp. and has been submitted to Genbank. The antibacterial substances were extracted using chloroform and ethyl acetate from MNGA medium in which ERI-135 had grown for 5 d at 30 degrees C. Cytotoxic effect was also studied. GC-MS analysis was carried out. The antimicrobial activity was assessed using broth micro dilution technique. RESULTS: Ethyl acetate extract showed activity against bacteria such as Bacillus subtilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium, Shigella flexneri, Enterobacter aerogenes, Staphylococcus aureu and Staphylococcus epidermidis (S. epidermidis) and fungi such as, Candida albicans and Trichophyton rubrum. The lowest minimum inhibitory concentrations were: 250 microg/mL against S. epidermidis and 250microg/mL against K. pneumonia. The isolate had the ability to produce enzymes such as protease. The exyract showed cytotoxic effect in human adenocarcinoma cancer cell line (A549). GC-MS analysis showed the presence of isovaleric acid (3.64%), 2-Methylbutanoic acid (5.03%), isobutyramide (5.05%), N,N-oimethylformamide-di-t-butylacetal (9.79%), benzeneacetamide (15.56%), octyl butyl phthalate (3.59%) and diisooctyl phthalate (5.79) in the extract. CONCLUSIONS: Methylobacterium sp. (ERI-135) showed promising antibacterial and cytotoxic activity. This is the first report in the antimicrobial and cytotoxic effect of Methylobacterium sp.
TI  - Phyto-synthesis of silver nanoscale particles using Morinda citrifolia L. and its inhibitory activity against human pathogens.
AB  - Leaf extract of Morinda citrifolia L. was assessed for the synthesis of silver nanoscale particles under different temperature and reaction time. Synthesized nanoscale (MCAgNPs) particles were confirmed by analysing the excitation of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) using UV-visible spectrophotometer at 420 nm. Further SEM, HRTEM analysis confirmed the range of particle size between 10 and 60 nm and SEAD pattern authorizes the face centered cubic (fcc) crystalline nature of the MCAgNPs. Fourier transform infrared spectrum (FTIR) of synthesized MCAgNPs confirms the presence of high amount of phenolic compounds in the plant extract which may possibly influence the reduction process and stabilization of nanoparticles. Further, inhibitory activity of MCAgNPs and plant extract were tested against human pathogens like Eschericia coli, Pseudomonas aeroginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Bacillus cereus and Enterococci sp. The results indicated that the MCAgNPs showed moderate inhibitory actions against human pathogens than crude plant extract, demonstrating its antimicrobial value against pathogenic diseases.
TI  - Phytochemical analysis and antimicrobial activities of methanolic extracts of leaf, stem and root from different varieties of Labisa pumila Benth.
AB  - A local herb, Kacip Fatimah, is famous amongst Malay women for its uses in parturition; however, its phytochemical contents have not been fully documented. Therefore, a study was performed to evaluate the phenolics, flavonoids, and total saponin contents, and antibacterial and antifungal properties of the leaf, stem and root of three varieties of Labisia pumila Benth. Total saponins were found to be higher in the leaves of all three varieties, compared to the roots and stems. Leaves of var. pumila exhibited significantly higher total saponin content than var. alata and lanceolata, with values of 56.4, 43.6 and 42.3 mg diosgenin equivalent/g dry weight, respectively. HPLC analyses of phenolics and flavonoids in all three varieties revealed the presence of gallic acid, caffeic acid, rutin, and myricetin in all plant parts. Higher levels of flavonoids (rutin, quercitin, kaempferol) were observed in var. pumila compared with alata and lanceolata, whereas higher accumulation of phenolics (gallic acid, pyrogallol) was recorded in var. alata, followed by pumila and lanceolata. Antibacterial activities of leaf, stem and root extracts of all varieties determined against both Gram positive (Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus subtilis B145, Bacillus cereus B43, Staphylococcus aureus S1431) and Gram negative (Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumonia K36, Escherichia coli E256, Pseudomonas aeruginosa PI96) pathogens showed that crude methanolic extracts are active against these bacteria at low concentrations, albeit with lower antibacterial activity compared to kanamycin used as the control. Antifungal activity of methanolic extracts of all plant parts against Fusarium sp., Candida sp. and Mucor using the agar diffusion disc exhibited moderate to appreciable antifungal activities compared to streptomycin used as positive control.
TI  - Potential application of the nisin Z preparation of Lactococcus lactis W8 in preservation of milk.
AB  - AIMS: The aim of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the preparation of nisin Z from Lactococcus lactis W8-fermented milk in controlling the growth of spoilage bacteria in pasteurized milk. METHODS AND RESULTS: Spoilage bacteria isolated from pasteurized milk at 8 and 15 degrees C were identified as Enterococcus italicus, Enterococcus mundtii, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus thuringiensis, Bacillus cereus, Lactobacillus paracasei, Acinetobacter sp., Pseudomonas fluorescens and Enterobacter aerogenes. These bacteria were found to have the ability to survive pasteurization temperature. Except Enterobacter aerogenes, the spoilage bacteria were sensitive to the nisin Z preparation of the L. lactis W8. Addition of the nisin Z preparation to either the skim milk or fat milk inoculated with each of the spoilage bacteria reduced the initial counts (about 5 log CFU ml(-)(1)) to an undetectable level within 8-20 h. The nisin Z preparation extended the shelf life of milk to 2 months under refrigeration. CONCLUSIONS: The nisin Z preparation from L. lactis W8-fermented milk was found to be effective as a backup preservative to counteract postpasteurization contamination in milk. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: A rapid inhibition of spoilage bacteria in pasteurized skim and fat milk with the nisin Z preparation of L. lactis W8 is more significant in comparison with the commercially available nisin (nisin A). The nisin Z preparation can be used instead of commercial nisin, which is not effective in fat milk.
TI  - Isolation, structure determination and antibacterial activities of succinamide conjugate diacid from Acinetobacter sp. BJ-L.
AB  - Strain BJ-L was isolated from the a water sample taken from Xiao Yue River in Beijing and identified as Acinetobacter sp. BJ-L based on the study of its morphology, physiology, biochemistry and 16S rRNA gene sequence. A new antimicrobial substance was produced after the strain was incubated in potato extract medium at 15 degrees C for 72 h. The antimicrobial substance was sequentially purified by reduced pressure condensation, EtOAc extract, and silica gel column chromatography. The structure of the antimicrobial substance was elucidated as succinamide conjugate diacid (SCD) by spectroscopic data interpretation. Structure analysis indicated that SCD is a novel compound and that it could inhibit the growth of some tested bacterial strains with the MIC of 2mg/ml, such as Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Enterobacter aerogenes and Escherichia coli. Moreover, no obvious toxicity has been found on cultured HUVEC cells with different concentrations of SCD at 5, 10, 15, and 20mg/ml.
TI  - Isolation and identification of microbes associated with mobile phones in Dammam  in eastern Saudi Arabia.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to determine microbial contamination of mobile phones in the city of Dammam, in the eastern region of Saudi Arabia, and identify the most important microbial species associated with these phones in order to take the necessary remedial measures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The analysis of a total of 202 samples was done to identify fungal and pathogenic bacteria isolates. Sterile swabs were firmly passed on the handset, the buttons and the screens of mobile phones, then inoculated into media of bacteria and fungi. Frequency distribution of isolates were calculated. RESULTS: There were 737 isolated of the following bacteria: Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Neisseria sicca, Micrococcus luteus, Proteus mirabilis, Bacillus subtilis, and Enterobacter aerogenes at the rate of 56.58, 13.57, 8.01, 7.73, 6.51, 3.66, 2.85 and 1.09% respectively. There were fungal isolates as follows: Alternaria alternata, Aspergillus niger, Cladosporium sp., Penicillium spp., Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus fumigatus, Rhizopus stolonifer, Aspergillus ochraceus at the rate of 29.07, 26.74, 20.93, 10.47, 6.98, 2.33, 2.33, 1.16%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The study showed that all mobile phones under consideration were infected by several microbes, most of which belonged to the natural flora of the human body as well as airborne fungi and soil. This means that it is necessary to sterilize hands after contact with a phone since it is a source of disease transmission.
TI  - Assessment of microbiological quality of sachet-packaged drinking water in Western Nigeria and its public health significance.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the microbiological quality of sachet-packaged drinking water in Western Nigeria and its impact on public health. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional microbiological testing. METHODS: Ninety-two sachet-packaged water samples were analysed for microbiological and metal qualities. Total bacterial and coliform counts were determined, and the presence of Escherichia coli, an important water quality indicator, was tested. The level of conformity of the water processors with the guidelines of Nigeria's quality regulatory agency was also determined. RESULTS: Varying levels of microbial contamination were recorded in samples from the different sampling locations. The total bacteria count ranged between 2.86 and 3.45log colony-forming units (cfu)/ml. The highest coliform count recorded was 1.62log cfu/ml. Faecal coliform E. coli was detected in one sample from Oke-Iho and one sample from Okaka, representing 2.2% of total samples. Lead and manganese were not found in any of the samples. However, iron was detected and the highest iron concentration (0.10mg/l) was detected in samples from Ikorodu. The bacteria that were identified from the water samples included E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella sp., Proteus vulgaris, Alcaligenes faecalis, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus lactis, Aeromonas sp. and Micrococcus luteum. Many of the water processors did not comply with the guidelines of the quality regulatory agency. CONCLUSIONS: Some of the sachet-packaged samples of drinking water were of poor quality. The results indicate a need for Nigeria's quality regulatory agency to take appropriate measures in safeguarding public health.
TI  - Chemical composition, antifungal and antibacterial activity of the essential oil  of Chamaecyparis nootkatensis from Spain.
AB  - The chemical composition of the oil of Chamaecyparis nootkatensis (D. Don) Spach. has been analysed by gas chromatography (GC) and gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS). A total of 34 compounds were identified representing more than 90% of the total oil. The oil was richer in monoterpenes than in sesquiterpenes, the major constituents being limonene (53.2%), 6-3-carene (21.0%) and a-pinene (12.2%). The antibacterial and antifungal activities of the oil were also tested against Candida albicans, Bacillus subtilis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella sp. and Serratia marcescens. Only two of these, Bacillus subtilis and Candida albicans, were sensitive to the treatment, inhibition zones of 11 and 14 mm diameter being obtained, respectively. As far as we know, this is the first report of the antifungal and antibacterial activity of this species.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of ethanol extracts of seaweeds against fish bacterial pathogens.
AB  - Crude extracts were prepared using the solvent ethanol from the seaweeds viz., Gracilaria edulis, Calorpha peltada and Hydroclothres sp. and screening for their antibacterial activity against six bacterial pathogens were also carried out. The test bacterial strains were Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus faecalis and Bacillus cereus. Ethanol extract of Gracilaria edulis inhibited growth of all the test organisms except Bacillus cereus and Enterobacter aerogenes. Seaweed extract of Calorpha peltada was found effective against a number of Gram negative and Gram positive bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis. Hydroclothres sp. extract inhibited the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa only out of the six tested pathogens.
TI  - Bacterial contamination in drinking water: a case study in rural areas of northern Rajasthan, India.
AB  - The objective of this study was to determine the bacterial contaminations in drinking water samples collected form some rural habitations of northern Rajasthan, India. A total of ten bacterial species: Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella sp, Proteus vulgaris, Alcaligenes faecalis, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus lactis and Micrococcus luteum were identified form drinking water samples. The bacteria belonging to the family enterobacteriaceae (coliforms) showed the maximum occurrences in water samples. The total coliforms count, i.e. TTC(m) (m = MPN index/100 ml) in drinking water samples was in the ranges of 25 TTC(m) (village Naiwala)-41 TTC(m) (village Meharwala). The data suggested that the drinking water quality deterioration in rural habitations of this region was due to poor sanitation and unawareness about personal hygienic practices. The occurrences some pathogenic bacteria in drinking water may increase the risks of water-related diseases and health problems in local residents.
TI  - Hydrogen and polyhydroxybutyrate producing abilities of microbes from diverse habitats by dark fermentative process.
AB  - Thirty five bacterial isolates from diverse environmental sources such as contaminated food, nitrogen rich soil, activated sludges from pesticide and oil refineries effluent treatment plants were found to belong to Bacillus, Bordetella, Enterobacter, Proteus, and Pseudomonas sp. on the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. Under dark fermentative conditions, maximum hydrogen (H(2)) yields (mol/mol of glucose added) were recorded to be 0.68 with Enterobacter aerogenes EGU16 followed by 0.63 with Bacillus cereus EGU43 and Bacillus thuringiensis EGU45. H(2) constituted 63-69% of the total biogas evolved. Out of these 35 microbes, 18 isolates had the ability to produce polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB), which varied up to 500 mg/l of medium, equivalent to a yield of 66.6%. The highest PHB yield was recorded with B. cereus strain EGU3. Nine strains had high hydrolytic activities (zone of hydrolysis): lipase (34-38 mm) -Bacillus sphaericus strains EGU385, EGU399 and EGU542; protease (56-62 mm) -Bacillus sp. strains EGU444, EGU447 and EGU445; amylase (23 mm) -B. thuringiensis EGU378, marine bacterium strain EGU409 and Pseudomonas sp. strain EGU448. These strains with high hydrolytic activities had relatively low H(2) producing abilities in the range of 0.26-0.42 mol/mol of glucose added and only B. thuringiensis strain EGU378 had the ability to produce PHB. This is the first report among the non-photosynthetic microbes, where the same organism(s) -B. cereus strain EGU43 and B. thuringiensis strain EGU45, have been shown to produce H(2) - 0.63 mol/mol of glucose added and PHB - 420-435 mg/l medium.
TI  - Diversity of microflora in the gut and casts of tropical composting earthworms reared on different substrates.
AB  - The diversity of fungi, bacteria, yeast, actinomycetes and protozoa were analysed in the gut and casts of Eudrilus eugeniae, Lampito mauritii, Eisenia fetida and Perionyx excavatus, both qualitatively and quantitatively as influenced by different feed substrates like clay loam soil, cowdung and pressmud. While actinomycetes (Streptomyces albus, S. somaliensis, Nocardia asteroides, N. caviae and Saccharomonosporia) were not digested by any of these species of worms, protozoa (Amoeba proteus, A. terricola, Paramecium trichium, Euglena viridis, E. orientalis, Vorticella picta and Trichomonas hominis) and yeast (Candida tropicalis, C. krusei C. albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans) were totally digested. Certain species of fungi (Saksenae vasiformis, Mucor plumbeus, Cladosporium carrionii, C. herbacium, Alternaria sp., Cunninghamella echinulata, Mycetia sterila, Syncephalostrum racemosum, Curvalaria lunata, C. geniculata and Geotrichum candidum) and bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacterium antitratum, Mima polymorpha, Enterobacter aerogenes, E. cloacae, Proteus vulgaris, P. mirabilis, P. rettgeri, Escherichia coli, Staphylococus citreus, Bacillus subtilis, B. cereus, Enterococci and Micrococci) were completely digested. Certain other species were not digested fungi like Aspergillus fumigatus, A. flavus, A. ochraceous, Trichoderma koningii (except by Eeugeniae), Fusarium moniliforme (except by E. eugeniae) and Rhizopus sp., and bacteria like Klebsiella pneumoniae and Morganella morganii) and these were multiplied during the transit of the organic residues through the gut of worms. The microbial proliferation was more in the casts, due to the environment prevailing--rich in nutrient supply and large surface area available for growth and reproduction of the microbes that lead to enhanced microbial activity and humic acid contents in the casts.
TI  - Antifungal and antibacterial activities of Mexican tarragon (Tagetes lucida).
AB  - Mexican tarragon (Tagetes lucida Cv. Asteraceae: Campanulatae) is an important, nutritious plant and an effective herbal medicine. Seven coumarins, 7,8-dihydroxycoumarin (4), umbelliferone (7-hydroxycoumarin) (5), scoparone (6,7-dimethoxycoumarin) (7), esculetin (6,7-dihydroxycoumarin) (11), 6-hydroxy-7-methoxycoumarin (12), herniarin (7-methoxycoumarin) (13), and scopoletin (6-methoxy-7-hydroxycoumarin) (14), and three flavonoids, patuletin (18), quercetin (19), and quercetagetin (20), were isolated from CH2Cl2 and MeOH extracts from aerial parts of T. lucida. In addition, 6,7-diacetoxy coumarin (15), 6-methoxy-7-acetylcoumarin (16), and 6-acetoxy-7-methoxycoumarin (17) derivatives were synthesized. 8-Methoxypsoralen (1), 8-acetyl-7-hydroxycoumarin (2), 7,8-dihydroxy-6-meth-oxycoumarin (3), 6,7-dimethoxy-4-methylcoumarin (6), 5,7-dihydroxy-4-methylcoumarin (8), 4-hydroxycoumarin (9), 4-hydroxy-6,7-dimethylcoumarin (10), naringenin (21), glycoside-7-rhamnonaringin (22), and rutin (23) were commercially obtained (Sigma-Aldrich). All of these compounds and extracts (M1 and M2) were assayed against bacteria and fungi. The antibacterial activity was determined on Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella typhi, Salmonella sp., Shigella boydii, Shigella sp., Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter agglomerans, Sarcina lutea, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Yersinia enterolitica, Vibrio cholerae (three El Tor strains, CDC-V12, clinic case, and INDRE-206, were obtained from contaminated water), and V. cholerae (NO-O1). The evaluated fungi were Aspergillus niger, Penicillium notatum, Fusarium moniliforme, Fusarium sporotrichum, Rhizoctonia solani, and Trichophyton mentagrophytes. The most active compounds against Gram-positive and -negative bacteria were the dihydroxylated coumarins 3 and 4. In addition, 2-4, 6, 7, and 11 showed an interesting activity against V. cholerae, a key bacterium in the contaminated water; 2-4 were the most active. Coumarins were the most effective compounds against Gram-negative bacteria. The extract MeOH/CH2Cl2 (1: 4) M2 at 0.4 microg/disk inhibited the growth of E. coli and P. mirabilis (40%), K. pneumoniae (31.1%), Salmonella sp. (35.5%), and Shigella sp. (0%) at 72 h of culture. The dimethoxy compounds 6 and 7 showed a strong activity against fungal strains, especially T. mentagrophytes and R. solani (100% of inhibition at 125.0 and 250.0 microg/mL, respectively).
TI  - Differential activity of a lectin from Solieria filiformis against human pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - A lectin isolated from the red alga Solieria filiformis was evaluated for its effect on the growth of 8 gram-negative and 3 gram-positive bacteria cultivated in liquid medium (three independent experiments/bacterium). The lectin (500 microg/mL) stimulated the growth of the gram-positive species Bacillus cereus and inhibited the growth of the gram-negative species Serratia marcescens, Salmonella typhi, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus sp, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa at 1000 microg/mL but the lectin (10-1000 microg/mL) had no effect on the growth of the gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus and B. subtilis, or on the gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium. The purified lectin significantly reduced the cell density of gram-negative bacteria, although no changes in growth phases (log, exponential and of decline) were observed. It is possible that the interaction of S. filiformis lectin with the cell surface receptors of gram-negative bacteria promotes alterations in the flow of nutrients, which would explain the bacteriostatic effect. Growth stimulation of the gram-positive bacterium B. cereus was more marked in the presence of the lectin at a concentration of 1000 microg/mL. The stimulation of the growth of B. cereus was not observed when the lectin was previously incubated with mannan (125 microg/mL), its hapten. Thus, we suggest the involvement of the binding site of the lectin in this effect. The present study reports the first data on the inhibition and stimulation of pathogenic bacterial cells by marine alga lectins.
TI  - Isolation and insecticidal effects of some bacteria from Euproctis chrysorrhoea L. (Lepidoptera: Lymantriidae).
AB  - In this study, we investigated the bacterial pathogens of Euproctis chrysorrhoea  and tested for their insecticidal activities. Based on colony color and morphology, four isolates were determined. According to morphological, physiological and biochemical characters of the isolates, they were identified as Enterobacter aerogenes, Lactobacillus sp., Bacillus thuringiensis and Micrococcus luteus. The insecticidal effects of these bacterial isolates on third-fourth instar larvae of Euproctis chrysorrhoea were investigated. The highest insecticidal effect determined on this pest is 68% with Bacillus thuringiensis. The effects of the other isolates are 45% with Enterobacter aerogenes, 15% Micrococcus luteus and 0% with Lactobacillus sp.
TI  - Cost-effective and rapid presumptive identification of gram-negative bacilli in routine urine, pus, and stool cultures: evaluation of the use of CHROMagar orientation medium in conjunction with simple biochemical tests.
AB  - The algorithm for a new identification system was designed on the basis of colony color and morphology on CHROMagar Orientation medium in conjunction with simple biochemical tests such as indole (IND), lysine decarboxylase (LDC), and ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) utilization tests with gram-negative bacilli isolated from urine samples as well as pus, stool, and other clinical specimens by the following colony characteristics, biochemical reactions, and serological results: pinkish to red, IND positive (IND(+)), Escherichia coli; metallic blue, IND(+), LDC(+), and ODC negative (ODC(-)), Klebsiella oxytoca; IND(+), LDC(-), and ODC(+), Citrobacter diversus; IND(+) or IND(-), LDC(-), and ODC(-), Citrobacter freundii; IND(-), LDC(+), and ODC(+), Enterobacter aerogenes; IND(-), LDC(-), and ODC(+), Enterobacter cloacae; IND(-), LDC(+), and ODC(-), Klebsiella pneumoniae; diffuse brown and IND(+), Morganella morganii; IND(-), Proteus mirabilis; aqua blue, Serratia marcescens; bluish green and IND(+), Proteus vulgaris; transparent yellow-green, serology positive, Pseudomonas aeruginosa; clear and serology positive, Salmonella sp.; other colors and reactions, the organism was identified by the full identification methods. The accuracy and cost-effectiveness of this new system were prospectively evaluated. During an 8-month period, a total of 345 specimens yielded one or more gram-negative bacilli. A total of 472 gram-negative bacillus isolates were detected on CHROMagar Orientation medium. For 466 of the isolates (98.7%), no discrepancies in the results were obtained on the basis of the identification algorithm. The cost of identification of gram-negative bacilli during this period was reduced by about 70%. The results of this trial for the differentiation of the most commonly encountered gram-negative pathogens in clinical specimens with the new algorithm were favourable in that it permitted reliable detection and presumptive identification. In addition, this rapid identification system not only significantly reduced costs but it also improved the daily work flow within the clinical microbiology laboratory.
TI  - The effect of physical and microbiological factors on food container leakage.
AB  - The effect of physical and microbiological factors on food container leakage was  investigated in a container leakage model system (CLMS). The leakage of Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Staphylococcus sp., Pseudomonas sp., Bacillus sp., a coryneform, Staph. aureus, and two biotest organisms (Enterobacter cloacae NC1B 8151 and Ent. aerogenes MB31) was studied. The rate of bacterial leakage (log10 cells/channel/s) was greater in the presence of a partial vacuum of 51-305 mm Hg than at atmospheric pressure. Fluid flow (ml) through leakage channels was increased by the application of vacuum. Leakage varied with vacuum, bacterial morphology, cell concentration, leakage channel size (0.78-120 micron 2) and channel shape (straight or convoluted). The number of leaked cells was not proportional to vacuum or channel size. The effect of channel shape varied with bacterial species. Increased container medium viscosity decreased bacterial leakage. Fluid flow through leakage channels was generally reduced by the most viscous solution. Cells from biofilms and monolayers of Ac. calcoaceticus or Staph. aureus attached to nylon (Hyfax) or stainless steel surfaces underwent leakage. Mixed bacterial populations had characteristic leakage rates against vacuum different from the leakage pattern of individual species in the population. The composition of the leaked population was different from the original inoculum. The results indicated that container leakage is a complex process involving a range of interdependent factors.
TI  - Microbial conversion of DL-2-amino-delta2-thiazoline-4-carboxylic acid to L-cysteine and L-cystine: screening of microorganisms and identification of products.
AB  - Microorganisms able to form L-cysteine from DL-2-amino-delta2-thiazoline-4-carboxylic acid (DL-ATC), a chemical intermediate in the synthesis of DL-cysteine, were isolated from soil samples and classified as Pseudomonas sp., Pseudomonas cohaerens, P. desmolytica, and P. ovalis. Thirteen L-cysteine-producing bacteria were also found in among 463 stock cultures representing 37 genera. These were Achromobacter delmarvae. Alcaligenes denitrificans, Bacillus brevis, Brevibacterium flavum, Enterobacter aerogenes, Erwinia carotovora, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus sodonensis, Myocoplana dimorpha, Sarcina lutea, Serratia marcescens, Flavobacterium acidoficum, and Pseudomonas ovalis. In the presence of intact cells of Pseudomonas sp. AJ 3854, 6.1 mg of L-cysteine and/or L-cystine per ml was produced from 10 mg of DL-ATC-3H2O per ml in a molar yield of 100%. This finding suggests that racemization and asymmetric hydrolysis occurred simultaneously in this incubation mixture. After the complete oxidation of cysteine to cystine by aeration in the presence of ferrous ion, crystalline cystine was isolated; its configuration was the L isomer based on data from X-ray diffraction, microbioassay, and optical rotation studies.
TI  - Formation of methyl mercury by bacteria.
AB  - Twenty-three Hg2+-resistant cultures were isolated from sediment of the Savannah  River in Georgia; of these, 14 were gram-negative short rods belonging to the genera Escherichia and Enterobacter, six were gram-positive cocci (three Staphylococcus sp. and three Streptococcus sp.) and three were Bacillus sp. All the Escherichia, Enterobacter, and the Bacillus strain were more resistant to Hg2+ than the strains of staphylococci and streptococci. Adaptation using serial dilutions and concentration gradient agar plate techniques showed that it was possible to select a Hg2+-resistant strain from a parent culture identified as Enterobacter aerogenes. This culture resisted 1,200 mug of Hg2+ per ml of medium and produced methyl mercury from HgCl2, but was unable to convert Hg2+ to volatile elemental mercury (Hg0). Under constant aeration (i.e., submerged culture), slightly more methyl mercury was formed than in the absence of aeration. Production of methyl mercury was cyclic in nature and slightly decreased if DL-homocysteine was present in media, but increased with methylcobalamine. It is concluded that the bacterial production of methyl mercury may be a means of resistance and detoxification against mercurials in which inorganic Hg2+ is converted to organic form and secreted into the environment.
TI  - Degradation of uric acid by certain aerobic bacteria.
AB  - We have isolated and identified nine cultures of aerobic bacteria capable of growing on an elective medium containing uric acid as the only source of carbon, nitrogen, and energy. Four of these cultures were identified as Aerobacter aerogenes, two as Klebsiella pneumoniae, and the remainder as Serratia killiensis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Bacillus species. Another culture identified as P. fluorescens required both glucose and uric acid for growth. When 23 laboratory stock cultures were inoculated into the uric acid medium, A. aerogenes, B. subtilis, Mycobacterium phlei, P. aeruginosa, and S. marcescens were able to grow. These five cultures also grew when the uric acid was replaced with adenine, guanine, hypoxanthine, xanthine, or allantoin, but growth was poor. In all of these media, including the uric acid medium, addition of glucose along with the nitrogenous compounds yielded good growth. Induction experiments demonstrated that the ability of A. aerogenes, K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa, P. fluorescens, S. kiliensis, S. marcescens, B. subtilis, and Bacillus sp. to degrade uric acid is an induced property. Of these organisms, only Bacillus sp. accumulated a small amount of intracellular uric acid.
TI  - Repression of Staphylococcus aureus by food bacteria. II. Causes of inhibition.
AB  - Two food bacteria, Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas sp. CS-1, inhibited an enterotoxigenic strain of Staphylococcus aureus, apparently by out-competing it for nutrients. Five others, Bacillus cereus, Proteus vulgaris, Escherichia coli H-52, Aerobacter aerogenes, and Achromobacter sp., inhibited by means of antibiotic substances which were Seitz-filterable, dialyzable, and stable at 90 C for 10 min. Inhibition was not caused by changes in pH, oxidation-reduction potential, or production of peroxide or fatty acids. The concentrated antibiotic material from E. coli H-52 contained amino acids but not peptides and was especially effective against staphylococci and micrococci.
