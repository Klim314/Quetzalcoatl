TI  == the extract of hypericum ascyron l. induces bacterial cell death through apoptosis pathway.
AB  == ethnopharmacological relevance: hypericum ascyron l. (h. ascyron l.) has been used as a traditional medicine for the treatment of wounds, swelling, headache, nausea, stomach ache, abscesses, dysentery and chronic bronchitis. pharmacological studies are necessary to provide a scientific basis to substantiate their traditional use. in this study, antimicrobial effect and its mechanism of the h. ascyron l. extract was investigated. materials and methods: antimicrobial activity of the h. ascyron l. extract was evaluated by the 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay (mtt). to confirm the antimicrobial mechanism of h. ascyron l. extract on bacterial cells, annexin  v/propidium iodide (pi) double staining, tunel, and dna laddering analysis were performed. results: antibacterial effects of the h. ascyron l. extract were tested on enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumonia, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus and micrococcus luteus, and the results showed that the sensitive bacteria of h. ascyron l. extract mainly included e. coli, s. aureus and m. luteus, especially m. luteus. the mbc value of h. ascyron l. extract on m. luteus was equal to the mic (20mg/ml). h. ascyron l. extract could induce cells death of m. luteus through apoptosis pathway. conclusions: this study provides scientific support for some of the traditional uses and the pharmacological activities of h. ascyron l. our data provide a rational base for the folkloric use of h. ascyron l.

TI  == plantaricin ld1: a bacteriocin produced by food isolate of lactobacillus plantarum ld1.
AB  == plantaricin ld1, a bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus plantarum ld1, was characterized for biochemical and antimicrobial properties. bacteriocin showed stability at high temperatures (100 degrees c for 20 min and 121 degrees c for 15 min under 15 psi pressure), in a ph range of 2.0-8.0 and also in the presence of  organic solvents, surfactants and detergents. the crude preparation was not affected by catalase, amylase and lipase but activity was reduced in the presence of pepsin, trypsin and proteinase k showing proteinaceous nature of the compound. the molecular weight of bacteriocin was found to be approximately 6.5 kda, and antimicrobial activity was confirmed by bioassay. it inhibited not only related strains but also other gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria such as lactobacillus curvatus nrrl b-4562, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis nrrl b-1821, enterococcus faecium nrrl b-2354, enterobacter cloacae nrrl b-14298, micrococcus  luteus, staphylococcus aureus, urogenic escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhi, shigella flexneri and vibrio sp. these properties of plantaricin ld1 suggest its applications not only in food safety but in therapeutics as well.

TI  == further in vitro evaluation of antiradical and antimicrobial activities of phytol.
AB  == the antiradical activity of phytol was evaluated by electron paramagnetic resonance towards hydroxyl radical (.oh), superoxide anion radical (.o2(-)), methoxy radical (.ch2oh), carbon-dioxide anion radical (.co2(-)), as well as towards nitric-oxide radical (.no) and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (.dpph) radical. it reduced the production of all tested radicals showing more promising  activity against .co2(-), .ch2oh and .dpph radicals (56%, 50% and 48%, respectively) in comparison with .no, .o2(-) and .oh radicals (38%, 23% and 15%,  respectively). the antimicrobial activity of phytol was evaluated by the microdilution method against eight bacterial and eight fungal strains. to varying degrees, it was proven to be active against all tested bacteria and fungi (mic 0.003-0.038 mg/ml and mbc 0.013-0.052 mg/ml, mic 0.008-0.016 mg/ml and mfc 0.090-0.520 mg/ml, respectively). according to the obtained results, medical foods containing phytol may support development of new therapies for heart disease.

TI  == a novel c-type lysozyme from mytilus galloprovincialis: insight into innate immunity and molecular evolution of invertebrate c-type lysozymes.
AB  == a c-type lysozyme (named as mgclyz) gene was cloned from the mussel mytilus galloprovincialis. blast analysis indicated that mgclyz was a salivary c-type lysozyme which was mainly found in insects. the nucleotide sequence of mgclyz was predicted to encode a polypeptide of 154 amino acid residues with the signal peptide comprising the first 24 residues. the deduced mature peptide of mgclyz was of a calculated molecular weight of 14.4 kd and a theoretical isoelectric point (pi) of 8.08. evolution analysis suggested that bivalve branch of the invertebrate c-type lysozymes phylogeny tree underwent positive selection during  evolution. by quantitative real-time rt-pcr (qrt-pcr) analysis, mgclyz transcript was widely detected in all examined tissues and responded sensitively to bacterial challenge in hemocytes and hepatopancreas. the optimal temperature and  ph of recombinant mgclyz (rmgclyz) were 20 degrees c and 4, respectively. the rmgclyz displayed lytic activities against gram-positive bacteria including micrococcus luteus and staphyloccocus aureus, and gram-negative bacteria including vibrio anguillarum, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas putida, proteus mirabilis and bacillus aquimaris. these results suggest that mgclyz perhaps play  an important role in innate immunity of m. galloprovincialis, and invertebrate c-type lysozymes might be under positive selection in a species-specific manner during evolution for undergoing adaptation to different environment and diverse pathogens.

TI  == diversity of the bacterial and fungal microflora from the midgut and cuticle of phlebotomine sand flies collected in north-western iran.
AB  == background: phlebotomine sand flies are the vectors of the leishmaniases, parasitic diseases caused by leishmania spp. little is known about the prevalence and diversity of sand fly microflora colonizing the midgut or the cuticle. particularly, there is little information on the fungal diversity. this information is important for development of vector control strategies. methodology/principal findings: five sand fly species: phlebotomus papatasi, p. sergenti, p. kandelakii, p. perfiliewi and p. halepensis were caught in bileh savar and kaleybar in north-western iran that are located in endemic foci of visceral leishmaniasis. a total of 35 specimens were processed. bacterial and fungal strains were identified by routine microbiological methods. we characterized 39 fungal isolates from the cuticle and/or the midgut. they belong  to six different genera including penicillium (17 isolates), aspergillus (14), acremonium (5), fusarium (1), geotrichum (1) and candida (1). we identified 33 gram-negative bacteria: serratia marcescens (9 isolates), enterobacter cloacae (6), pseudomonas fluorescens (6), klebsiella ozaenae (4), acinetobacter sp. (3),  escherichia coli (3), asaia sp. (1) and pantoea sp. (1) as well as gram-positive  bacteria bacillus subtilis (5) and micrococcus luteus (5) in 10 isolates. conclusion/significance: our study provides new data on the microbiotic diversity of field-collected sand flies and for the first time, evidence of the presence of asaia sp. in sand flies. we have also found a link between physiological stages (unfed, fresh fed, semi gravid and gravid) of sand flies and number of bacteria that they carry. interestingly pantoea sp. and klebsiella ozaenae have been isolated in old world sand fly species. the presence of latter species on sand fly cuticle and in the female midgut suggests a role for this arthropod in dissemination of these pathogenic bacteria in endemic areas. further experiments  are required to clearly delineate the vectorial role (passive or active) of sand  flies.

TI  == validation of aedes aegypti aag-2 cells as a model for insect immune studies.
AB  == background: the understanding of mosquito immune responses can provide valuable tools for development of novel mosquito control strategies. aiming the study at insect innate immunity, continuous insect cell lines have been established and used as research tools due to the fact that they constitute more homogeneous, sensitive, and reproducible systems than the insects from which they originated.  more recently, aag-2, an aedes aegypti cell lineage, began to be frequently used  as a model for studies of mosquito immunity. nevertheless, to our knowledge, no study has systematically characterized the responses of aag-2 cell line against different kinds of pathogens and compared its response to those exhibited by whole mosquitoes. for this reason, in this study we characterized gene expression profiles of the aag-2 cell line in response to different kinds of immune challenges, such as gram negative and positive bacteria, fungi and viruses, comparing the obtained results with the ones already described in the literature  for whole mosquitoes. methods: aedes aegypti aag-2 cells were exposed to different immune stimuli (gram-positive and gram negative heat inactivated bacteria, zymosan or sindbis virus) for 24 hours and the expression of selected marker genes from toll, imd and jak/stat pathways was analyzed by qpcr. also, cells were incubated with fluorescent latex beads for evaluation of its phagocytosis capacity. results: aag-2 cells were stimulated with two concentrations of heat-killed gram negative (enterobacter cloacae) or gram positive (micrococcus luteus) bacteria, zymosan or infected with sindbis virus and the expression of key genes from the main immune related pathways, toll, imd  and jak/stat, were investigated. our results suggest that toll and imd pathways are activated in response to both gram positive and negative bacteria and zymosan in aag-2 cells, displaying an immune profile similar to those described in the literature for whole mosquitoes. the same stimuli were also capable of activating jak/stat pathway in aag-2 cells. infection with sindbis virus led to an up-regulation of the transcription factor stat but was not able to induce the expression of any other gene from any of the pathways assayed. we also showed that this cell line is able to phagocytose latex beads in culture. conclusions: our results characterize the expression profile of aag-2 cells in response to different immune stimuli and demonstrate that this cell lineage is immune-competent and closely resembles the response described for whole ae. aegypti mosquitoes. hence, our findings support the use of aag-2 as a tool to comprehend ae. aegypti immune response both at cellular and humoral levels.

TI  == antimicrobial peptide gene induction, involvement of toll and imd pathways and defense against bacteria in the red flour beetle, tribolium castaneum.
AB  == using tribolium castaneum, we quantitatively investigated the induction of nine antimicrobial peptide (amp) genes by live gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli and enterobacter cloacae), gram-positive bacteria (micrococcus luteus and bacillus subtilis) and the budding yeast (saccharomyces cerevisiae). then, five representative amp genes were selected, and the involvement of the toll and imd pathways in their induction by e. coli, m. luteus and s. cerevisiae was examined  by utilizing rna interference of either myd88 or imd. results indicated: robust and acute induction of three genes by the two bacterial species was mediated mainly by the imd pathway; slow and sustained induction of one gene by the two bacteria was mediated mainly by the toll pathway; induction of the remaining one  gene by the two bacteria was mediated by both pathways; induction of the five genes by the yeast was mediated by the toll and/or imd pathways depending on respective genes. these results suggest that more promiscuous activation and usage of the two pathways may occur in t. castaneum than in drosophila melanogaster. in addition, the imd pathway was revealed to dominantly contribute  to defense against two bacterial species, gram-negative e. cloacae and gram-positive b. subtilis that possesses dap-type peptidoglycan.

TI  == focusing and mobilization of bacteria in capillary electrophoresis.
AB  == an isotachophoretic method has been developed for mobilizing and focusing bacteria. this allows quantification and detection of bacteria in a narrow zone.  very good linearity was obtained for micrococcus lysodeikticus (also called micrococcus luteus, studied as a model of gram+ bacteria) in the range of 0.4 x 10(8) cells/ml to 2.9 x 10(8) cells/ml, with correlation coefficients for peak height and peak area as a function of cell concentration of 0.999 and 0.998, respectively. this method is usable on both bare and hydroxypropyl cellulose-coated fused silica capillaries. the best results were obtained using 13.6 mm tris, 150 mm boric acid as terminating electrolyte, and 4.5 mm tris, 50 mm boric acid, and 3.31 mm hcl as leading electrolyte. with a 33.5 cm x100 mum i.d. capillary, short migration times were obtained while maintaining very low electrical current in order to minimize any joule heating and lysis of the bacteria. a uv area imaging detector (actipix d100, paraytec) was used with a 109 cm x 100 mum i.d. capillary having three loops and four detection windows to monitor the migration behavior of m. luteus and to show the stability of the zone of the focused bacteria along the capillary. similar results were obtained for erwinia carotovora (a model of gram- bacteria), and for enterobacter cloacae and  vibrio splendidus.

TI  == antibacterial effects of the essential oils of commonly consumed medicinal herbs  using an in vitro model.
AB  == the chemical composition and antibacterial activity of essential oils from 10 commonly consumed herbs: citrus aurantium, c. limon, lavandula angustifolia, matricaria chamomilla, mentha piperita, m. spicata, ocimum basilicum, origanum vulgare, thymus vulgaris and salvia officinalis have been determined. the antibacterial activity of these oils and their main components; i.e. camphor, carvacrol, 1,8-cineole, linalool, linalyl acetate, limonene, menthol, a-pinene, b-pinene, and thymol were assayed against the human pathogenic bacteria bacillus  subtilis, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli o157:h7, micrococcus flavus, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella enteritidis, s. epidermidis, s. typhimurium, and staphylococcus aureus. the highest and broadest  activity was shown by o. vulgare oil. carvacrol had the highest antibacterial activity among the tested components.

TI  == growth, encystment and survival of acanthamoeba castellanii grazing on different  bacteria.
AB  == free-living amoebae of the genus acanthamoeba are widely distributed in soil and  water collections, where trophozoites (vegetative, multiplicative stages) feed mainly by phagocytosis and thus control bacterial populations in the environment. here, we examined the growth, encystment and survival of acanthamoeba castellanii receiving different bacteria (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter cloacae, bacillus subtilis, bacillus megaterium, micrococcus luteus, and staphylococcus aureus) in nonnutrient saline. all bacteria assayed induced a  dose-dependent proliferative response, in most cases maximized with a bacterial dose of 1 x 10(9) ml(-1); except for m. luteus, trophozoites grew better with viable than with heat-killed bacteria. in addition, acanthamoeba growth was improved by adding bacteria on alternate days. single-dose experiments indicated  a temporal association between the growth of trophozoite and bacterial consumption, and higher consumption of m. luteus, e. coli and p. aeruginosa, bacterial species that allowed the highest trophozoite yields. long-term acanthamoeba-bacteria incubation revealed that encystment was significantly delayed by almost all the bacteria assayed (including s. aureus, which elicited a poor growth response) and that the presence of bacteria markedly increased cyst yield; final cyst recovery clearly depended on both the dose and the type of the  bacterium given, being much higher with e. coli, m. luteus and p. aeruginosa.

TI  == mitracarpus frigidus aerial parts exhibited potent antimicrobial, antileishmanial, and antioxidant effects.
AB  == the crude extract and the hexane, ch(2)cl(2), etoac, n-buoh, and hydromethanolic  fractions of the aerial parts of mitracarpus frigidus were evaluated against promastigote forms of two species of leishmania (l. chagasi and l. amazonensis),  11 strains of bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella enterica sorovar tythimurium, shigella sonnei, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, micrococcus luteus, enterococcus faecalis, enterobacter cloacae, streptococcus pyogenes and bacillus cereus) and two yeasts (candida albicans and  cryptococcus neoformans). the antioxidant activity (dpph radical scavenging activity and reducing power), cytotoxicity against mammalian cells, and the contents of phenolics and flavonoids were determined. phytochemical analysis of the major groups of phytoconstituents is also reported. all samples showed antioxidant activity which was positively correlated to the content of phenolic compounds. s. sonnei, b. cereus and c. neoformans were susceptible to all extracts tested, except for the n-buoh and hydromethanolic fractions, which demonstrated no antimicrobial activity. the lowest mic was recorded for the ch(2)cl(2) fraction against c. neoformans (mic of 10 microg/ml), followed by b. cereus, s. sonnei, and e. cloacae (mic of 20, 39 and 39 microg/ml, respectively). the ch(2)cl(2) fraction was the most effective against l. chagasi (ic(50) of 6.7  microg/ml), and the hydromethanolic fraction exhibited the best activity against  l. amazonensis (ic(50) of 9 microg/ml). a cytotoxic effect on mammalian cells was observed only for the crude extract and ch(2)cl(2) fraction at the concentrations of 130 and 31 microg/ml, respectively. these results suggest that m. frigidus has interesting antimicrobial, antileishmanial and antioxidant activities.

TI  == susceptibility of pseudomonas aeruginosa to a photodynamic effect of the arginine hematoporphyrin derivative.
AB  == the photodynamic effect of the arginine hematoporphyrin derivative (hpd-arg(2)) on the growth of selected pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolates is described as compared to the effect of hematoporphyrin derivative (hpd). growth inhibition  of hpd-arg(2) of three gram-positive strains (staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis and micrococcus luteus) and five laboratory strains of gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, proteus vulgaris, p. aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae) was observed as well. serratia marcescens strain was resistant to light-activated hpd-arg(2) or hpd. the antimicrobial activity of light-activated hpd-arg(2) against p. aeruginosa may offer an additional option in the anti-pseudomonal therapy of wounds.

TI  == [bacteria-reducing properties of copper-containing and non-copper-containing materials. ii. relationship between microbiocide effect of copper-containing materials and copper ion concentration after contamination with moist and dry hands].
AB  == the bactericide quality of different materials containing copper (copper, brass,  brass-sheet) was tested and particularly the effect of humidity and copper-concentration was examined. in first examinations (i. communication) (19)  the materials were contaminated by hands, which were dipped into a suspension of  different microorganisms (micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa). the survival rate of the microorganisms on the surfaces was determined after defined  exposure times (0, 5, 30, 60, 120 min). the following ways of contaminating the test materials were chosen: single contamination with wet hands, repeated contamination with wet and dry hands. in this examination the results were tested for statistical significance and in parallel experiments the copper-concentration on the surfaces of the materials was determined. materials containing copper contaminated with wet hands show a significant bactericide effect after an exposure time of 120 min. the bactericide effect on micrococcus luteus and pseudomonas aeruginosa is inhibited after contamination with dry hands. this results can not be explained by a different copper-concentration on the surfaces  of the materials, because a statistically significant difference of copper-ion concentrations between contamination with wet and dry hands could not be obtained.

TI  == [bacterial reducing qualities of copper-containing and non-copper-containing materials. i. contamination and sedimentation in humid and dry conditions].
AB  == in this examination the bactericide qualities of different materials were tested. particularly the effect of humidity was examined. 3 materials containing copper ("copper", "brass" and "brass sheet") and 2 materials not containing copper ("polyamide b" and "high-grade steel") were tested. the surfaces of the 5 types of material were contaminated with a suspension of 2 different bacteria species (staphylococcus aureus and micrococcus luteus). after defined exposure times the  survival rate of the microorganisms on the surfaces was determined by the standardized method of the "guidelines of the german society of hygiene and microbiology". additionally the sedimentation of airborne microorganisms on the materials was tested by determining the number of colony-forming-units after defined exposure times. in further examinations the materials were contaminated by hands, which were dipped into a suspension of different microorganisms (micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae and pseudomonas aeruginosa). the following ways of contaminating the test materials were chosen: single contamination with wet hands, repeated contamination with wet and dry hands. after defined exposure times the survival rate of the microorganisms on the surfaces was determined. the results show, a bactericide quality of copper depends on the percent of copper-content of the tested materials, exposure time, humidity, frequency of contamination and bacteria species. humidity and only single contamination cause  a reduction of bacteria. reduction of gram-negative bacteria is more easily than  reduction of gram-positive bacteria. enterococcus faecium shows the highest, pseudomonas aeruginosa the lowest reduction rate of bacteria in the following sequence: enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa.

TI  == induction of immunity by latex beads and by hemolymph transfer in galleria mellonella.
AB  == injection of sterile latex beads into the hemocoel of last instar larvae of galleria mellonella provoked a strong defense reaction. cellular defense by hemocytes was followed by enhanced antibacterial activity in hemolymph. latex-injected insects showed increased survival rates after a challenge injection with high doses of bacteria. factors which stimulate the production of  antibacterial activity could be demonstrated soon after injection by transfer of  hemolymph from preinjected to untreated larvae. a large induction capacity in donor hemolymph was accompanied by a strong decrease in the total hemocyte count  of free floating hemocytes, resulting from a decrease in number of plasmatocytes  and granular cells, the cell types involved in the cellular defense against the injected latex beads. the results presented support the hypothesis that during cellular defense reactions, factors are released from the hemocytes which stimulate the production of antibacterial substances.

TI  == antibacterial activity in the hemolymph of myriapods (arthropoda).
AB  == the hemolymphs of two diplopod (chicobolus sp. and rhapidostreptus virgator) and  two chilopod species (lithobius forficatus and scolopendra cingulata) were tested for the presence of antibacterial substances using petri dish tests. the native hemolymph of all species had substances acting on living micrococcus luteus, whereas only rhapidostreptus, scolopendra, and lithobius were effective against lyophilized micrococcus. the antibacterial activity against living micrococcus increased after inoculation with bacteria (enterobacter cloacae beta-12) in chicobolus and rhapidostreptus and also against lyophilized micrococcus in the latter. thus, these effects appear to be inducible. none of the myriapods tested  had any bacteriostatic effect on escherichia coli d-31 whereas the growth of gram-negative e. cloacae was inhibited. the antibacterial substances in the diplopod species were unstable when heated but were resistant to freezing. at least two antibacterial substances (a lysozyme-like one and another substance) are considered to occur in myriapoda.

TI  == defence reactions of glossina morsitans morsitans against different species of bacteria and trypanosoma brucei brucei.
AB  == tsetse flies, glossina morsitans morsitans, fed on rats infected with trypanosoma brucei brucei showed wide fluctuations in total and differential haemocyte counts. similar fluctuations occurred in controls fed on non-infected rats and also between the two groups without showing any difference which could be attributed to the infection. trypanosome infection of the tsetse haemocoel occurred in 16.25% of the flies, starting from the second day after feeding on the infected rats, but salivary glands and proboscis became infected only after the eleventh day. about 2% of bloodstream forms of t. b. brucei injected into tsetse haemocoels completed their developmental cycle successfully. injection of  tsetse homogenates into teneral g. m. morsitans prior to exposure to trypanosome-infected feed increased t. b. brucei infections in the flies significantly. injection of live escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae and acinetobacter calcoaceticus into tsetse induced a remarkable increase in two pre-existing haemolymph proteins with molecular weights of about 70 and 17 kilodaltons, while live bacillus subtilis and micrococcus luteus induced a very weak response or sometimes none at all. t. b. brucei also failed to induce any increase in these proteins. inoculation of g. m. morsitans with live e. coli und  t. b. brucei prior to feeding on trypanosome-infected rats had no effect on the salivary gland and proboscis infection rates by t. b. brucei. injection of live t. b. brucei into the haemocoels of tsetse caused no change in total haemocyte counts, but the trypanosomes disappeared from the haemolymph so rapidly that by 48 h post-injection, only about 1% were left.

TI  == antibacterial and antimycotic effect of a newly discovered secretion from larvae  of an endoparasitic insect, pimpla turionellae l. (hym.).
AB  == the larvae of pimpla turionellae, that develop in pupae of various lepidoptera, discharged through their anus up to 8 microliters/h of a hyaline liquid, which is termed "anal secretion". it exerted a strong bacteriostatic effect on enterobacter cloacae, a highly virulent intestinal microorganism isolated from the midgut of the host pupa, pieris brassicae. growth inhibition of escherichia coli, micrococcus luteus and pseudomonas phaseolicola was also evident, but less  pronounced. inhibition depended upon the concentration of the anal secretion. this was also true regarding the effect on growth of beauveria bassiana, a fungus pathogenic on insects. the antimycotic action of the anal secretion was less effective against chaetomium pululiferum, a soil-inhabiting fungus. growing hyphae of b. bassiana were malformed, exhibiting the so-called "curling effect",  when treated with anal secretion. parenteral injection of a low dose of enterobacter cloacae resulted in 100% mortality of non parasitized pupae of pieris brassicae; however, simultaneous injection of 3 microliters of anal secretion resulted in higher survival.
