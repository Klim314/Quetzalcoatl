TI  == breast abscess bacteriologic features in the era of community-acquired methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus epidemics.
AB  == hypothesis: increasing rates of community-acquired methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) infections have also affected the microbial profile  of breast abscesses. objective: to update the decade-old bacteriologic description of breast abscesses to improve the choice of initial antibacterial drug therapy. design: retrospective case series. setting: county hospital emergency department. patients: forty-four women (mean age, 41 years; age range,  20-63 years) with breast abscesses. methods: all cultures from the breast abscesses of patients were reviewed. main outcome measures: the microbiologic features and sensitivities of breast abscesses. results: of 46 specimens only 28  showed bacterial yield (61%). of these, 11 (39%) were polymicrobial, for an average of 1.4 isolates per specimen. the most common organism was s aureus, present in 12 of 37 aerobic cultures (32%), with mrsa in 7 (58%). the remaining organisms included coagulase-negative staphylococcus (16%), diphtheroids (16%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (8%), proteus mirabilis (5%), and other isolates (22%). all mrsa was sensitive to clindamycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and linezolid. only 2 patients (29%) were sensitive to levofloxacin. two anaerobic cultures were positive for propionibacterium acnes and peptostreptococcus anaerobius. conclusions: staphylococcus aureus is the most common pathogenic organism in modern breast abscesses. many breast abscesses have community-acquired mrsa, with more than 50% of all s aureus and 19% of all cultures being mrsa. this finding parallels the local and national increases in mrsa reported in other soft-tissue infections. with increasing bacterial resistance and more minimally invasive management of breast abscesses, understanding the current bacteriologic profile of these abscesses is essential to determining the correct empirical antibiotic drug therapy.

TI  == vitreous and aqueous penetration of orally administered gatifloxacin in humans.
AB  == objective: to investigate the penetration of gatifloxacin, a novel extended-spectrum fourth-generation fluoroquinolone antibiotic, into the vitreous and aqueous humor after oral administration. methods: a prospective, nonrandomized study of 24 consecutive patients scheduled for pars plana vitrectomy between september 2001 and may 2002 at the cullen eye institute. aqueous, vitreous, and serum samples were obtained and analyzed from 24 patients  after administration of two 400-mg gatifloxacin tablets taken 12 hours apart before the operation. assays were performed using high-performance liquid chromatography. results: mean +/- sd gatifloxacin concentrations in serum (n = 23), vitreous (n = 23), and aqueous (n = 11) were 5.14 +/- 1.36 micro g/ml, 1.34  +/- 0.34 micro g/ml, and 1.08 +/- 0.54 micro g/ml respectively. mean +/- sd sampling times after oral administration of the second gatifloxacin tablet for serum, vitreous, and aqueous were 3.2 +/- 1.0 hours, 4.0 +/- 1.0 hours, and 3.9 +/- 1.1 hours, respectively. the percentages of serum gatifloxacin concentration  achieved in the vitreous and aqueous were 26.17% and 21.02%, respectively. mean inhibitory vitreous and aqueous mic(90 ) levels were achieved against many pathogens, including staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, propionibacterium acnes, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, bacillus cereus, proteus mirabilis, and other organisms. conclusions: orally administered gatifloxacin achieves therapeutic levels in the noninflamed human eye, and the activity spectrum appropriately encompass the bacterial species most frequently involved in the various causes of endophthalmitis. because of its broad-spectrum coverage, low mic(90) levels for the organisms of concern, and good tolerability, gatifloxacin  represents a major advance in the prophylaxis or treatment of postoperative, posttraumatic, and bleb-associated bacterial endophthalmitis.

TI  == vitreous penetration of orally administered gatifloxacin in humans.
AB  == purpose: to investigate the penetration of gatifloxacin, a novel extended-spectrum fluoroquinolone antibiotic, into the vitreous humor after oral  administration. methods: a prospective, nonrandomized clinical study of 20 consecutive patients scheduled for pars plana vitrectomy surgery between september 2001 and february 2002 at the cullen eye institute, houston, texas. aqueous, vitreous, and serum samples were obtained and analyzed from 20 patients  after oral administration of two 400-mg gatifloxacin tablets taken 12 hours apart before surgery. assays were performed using high-performance liquid chromatography. results: mean gatifloxacin concentrations in serum (n = 19), vitreous (n = 19), and aqueous (n = 10) 4.98 +/- 1.14 micrograms/ml, 1.35 +/- 0.36 microgram/ml, and 1.09 +/- 0.57 micrograms/ml, respectively. mean sampling times after oral administration of the second gatifloxacin tablet for serum, vitreous, and aqueous were 2.99 +/- 0.73 hours, 3.79 +/- 0.81 hours, and 3.71 +/- 0.87 hours, respectively. the percentages of serum gatifloxacin concentration achieved in the vitreous and aqueous were 27.13% and 21.85%, respectively. mean inhibitory vitreous and aqueous mic90 levels were achieved against a wide spectrum of pathogens, including staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, propionibacterium acnes, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, bacillus cereus, neisseria gonorrhoeae, proteus mirabilis, and other organisms. conclusions: gatifloxacin is a novel fourth-generation fluoroquinolone antibiotic that has mic90 levels significantly lower than those of other fluoroquinolone agents. furthermore, it penetrates well into the vitreous cavity in the noninflamed eye. potential uses for oral gatifloxacin may include prophylaxis against endophthalmitis in open-globe injuries, surgical prophylaxis against postoperative endophthalmitis,  and adjunctive therapy for the current management of bacterial endophthalmitis.

TI  == [amyloidosis associated with chronic granulomatous disease in a patient with a renal transplant and recurrent urinary tract infections].
AB  == chronic granulomatous disease is a group of syndromes which share a defect in a component of the phagocyte nadph-oxidase complex. without this enzyme activity, phagocytic cells cannot produce superoxide, peroxide, and other potent microbicidal radicals, and are less able to kill ingested pathogens. the clinical picture is characterised by recurrent life-threatening bacterial and fungal infections and abnormal tissue granuloma formation. on the other hand, amyloidosis is a systemic disease with renal involvement occurring in the majority of cases. recurrent amyloidosis is a rare but well documented event in renal transplant recipients. however, graft loss secondary to amyloidosis has been noted infrequently. in addition, de novo amyloidosis has not been previously associated with graft loss. we report here a renal transplant recipient with chronic granulomatous disease and history of recurrent urinary tract infections,  who developed nephrotic syndrome and progressive renal insufficiency secondary to de novo aa amyloidosis leading to graft loss 66 months after transplantation.

TI  == [development of a vaccine for treatment of urinary tract infections].
AB  == receiving uroinfections are predominantly treated with antibiotics and chemotherapeutics. an effective alternative treatment can be immunotherapy with inactivated bacteria. the authors have focused on the development of polybacterial vaccine with both specific and nonspecific immunostimulatory activity. the vaccine contains killed bacteria which most frequently occur as an  etiological agent in urinary tract infections. determining for the selection of particular strains for the vaccine preparation were their immunostimulatory properties evaluated after intraperitoneal application of killed cells to mice. the results were evaluated according to weight gain of liver and spleen and verified by histological examination of these organs. the final form of the vaccine urvakol contains immunogenically most active strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus faecalis, representing specific effective part of the preparation, adjuvant activity is provided by propionibacterium acnes.

TI  == in vitro viability of external eye microbial flora in hydroxy-propyl-methylcellulose.
AB  == the aim of this study was to verify the in vitro influence of various dilutions of a viscoelastic substance containing 2% hydroxy-propyl-methylcellulose (hpmc) on the viability of some microbial strains representative of the normal flora of  the external eye. pure reference strain cultures of candida albicans, pseudomonas aeruginosa, propionibacterium acnes, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and a fresh clinical isolate of proteus mirabilis were selected for this study. serial twofold dilutions of 2% hpmc, prepared so as to obtain a final concentration ranging from 50 to 0.78% of the product in sterile saline solution  (0.85% nacl), were taken out with a pipette that delivered 1.0 ml per tube. one hundred microliters of the abovementioned microbial inocula, used for the evaluation of the positive control of the test organism, were dispensed into each tube. after 24 h of incubation, 100 microl of samples were taken from each tube and plated into the specific medium for the growth of the test organism. after 24-48 h of incubation, these agar plates were examined and the colony-forming-unit count of each test organism was compared to the corresponding total colony count, acting as a positive control, in order to determine the quantitative variation of the test organism grown in the presence of the viscoelastic compounds. c. albicans and p. aeruginosa showed a statistically significant increase in growth with hpmc dilutions varying from 1:2 to 1:16. p. acnes and p. mirabilis growth was significantly reduced by all dilutions except for the 1:128 one. s. epidermidis growth was also significantly reduced in the presence of hpmc dilutions varying from 1:2 to 1:64. s. aureus growth was not significantly influenced. the viability of p. aeruginosa in hpmc dilutions needs  to be carefully considered because of the ability of this organism to induce endophthalmitis, and the possibility that during cataract surgery, a small amount of hpmc may be left in the eye, trapped behind the intraocular lens optic.

TI  == [meropenem: microbiologic perspective].
AB  == meropenem is a beta-lactamic carbapenem derived from thienamycin and is structurally characterized by the presence of a beta-methyl group in position c1  which confers stability to the molecule versus renal dehydropeptidase 1 (dhp-1),  thereby making the coadministration of an enzyme inhibitor unnecessary. its esterochemical configuration of the lateral chain in c2 (dimethyl carbomoilpyrrolidenethium) increases the activity versus gram negative bacteria (enterobacteria and pseudomonas) and moreover, may explain the reduction in the proconvulsive effect observed in imipenem/cilastatin. meropenem has great bactericide power and has a very wide spectrum of activity depending on it low molecular weight and zwiterionic structure, stability versus almost all the clinically important beta-lactamases and high affinity for the pbps. it covers gram positive aerobes (staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococci, streptococci including streptococcus pneumoniae resistant to penicillin, enterococcus faecalis, rhodococcus equi, listeria monocytogenes) and gram negative bacteria (enterobacteria, p. aeruginosa, acinetobacter, aeromonas, plesiomonas, vibrio, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria, moraxella) and anaerobes  (bacteroides, prevotella, porphyromonas, fusobacterium, clostridium, peptostreptococcus, and propionibacterium acnes), being more active than imipenem versus gram negatives: p. aeruginosa (2-4-fold), enterobacteria (2-32-fold) and h. influenzae (4-8-fold) and less active versus the gram positives (enterococci,  streptococci and staphylococci). meropenem has no activity on enterococcus faecium, s. aureus resistant to methycillin, stenotrophomonas maltophilia and other genera producers of chromosomic methalo-beta-lactamases (carbapenemases). resistance may be due to impermeability given the loss of the oprd porin (oprd2 in enterobacteria and p. aeruginosa) loss of different membrane proteins (proteus mirabilis, proteus rettgeri, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes), modifications of the pbps (gram positive) and the production of carbapenemases (chromosomic methalo-beta-lactamases).

TI  == evaluation of minocycline and cefuzonam for antimicrobial activity against clinical isolates.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of minocycline (mino) and that of cefuzonam (czon) were assessed with clinical isolates of 19 species, and compared with that of other antibiotics. mino was highly active against methicilli-sensitive staphylococcus aureus (mssa), neisseria gonorrhoeae, moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, helicobacter pylori, flavobacterium meningosepticum, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, peptostreptococcus spp. and propionibacterium acnes, but not as effective against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas cepacia and alcaligenes xylosoxidans. czon was highly active against mssa, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae, n. gonorrhoeae, m(b). catarrhalis, h. influenzae, h. pylori, p. mirabilis, peptostreptococcus spp. and p. acnes, but not effective against mrsa. it was minimally active against gram-negative rods (e. coli, k. pneumoniae, etc.) and bacteria that do not ferment glucose.

TI  == [antimicrobial activities of cefuroxime against recent clinical isolates].
AB  == antimicrobial activity of cefuroxime axetil (cxm-ax) was compared with those of other cephem antibiotics against clinically isolated strains obtained mainly from outpatients of our center in a period from january to september of 1990 and 1993. minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined and the following results were  obtained. 1. the results suggested that, compared with reports of studies conducted with clinical isolates in early 1980's, mic80 of cxm were equal to or lower against staphylococcus spp., streptococcus pyogenes, escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, peptostreptococcus spp., and propionibacterium acnes, except for streptococcus pneumoniae, mic80 which was slightly higher. 2. mic90 of comparator drugs reflected those of new resistant organisms recently appeared, such as benzylpenicillin (pcg)-insensitive s. pneumoniae (pisp), cephem-resistant e. coli and klebsiella spp., new quinolone-resistant h. influenzae and n. gonorrhoeae. methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) was detected also from specimens of community acquired infections. from the nature of mrsa detected in those situations mrsa appeared to present a continuing problem. 3. mic90 against strains obtained from  patients with community acquired infections was a good index of increases of multidrug-resistant organisms in the past. therefore, the determination of mic90  is important in examining changes with time of sensitivities or resistances of clinically isolated strains to antimicrobial drugs. 4. antimicrobial activities of cxm against recent clinical isolates showed the existence of problems as mentioned above. however, mic of cxm as well as those of comparator drugs indicated that antimicrobial activities of cxm against staphylococcus spp., streptococcus spp., h. influenzae appeared to be relatively strong, and it is concluded that cefuroxime axetil still is one of the clinically useful oral antimicrobial drugs in the 1990's.

TI  == recurrent postoperative endophthalmitis.
AB  == we treated five patients for postoperative endophthalmitis who demonstrated an initially good response to intravitreal management of their infection and then suffered a later recurrence. four of the five patients received a single intravitreal injection of antibiotics as the only intravitreal therapy, and the fifth patient received a single antibiotic injection in addition to a partial vitrectomy. all recurrent infections occurred between 10 and 21 days after the original intravitreal injection of antibiotics. at the time of the recurrence, all five patients remained culture positive with the same organism that was initially isolated. the bacterial species isolated were s. epidermidis, group d streptococcus, p. acnes, p. mirabilis, and p. aeruginosa. all patients were ultimately sterilized with repeated intravitreal injections of antibiotics, vitrectomy, and/or intraocular lens removal. factors that were related to recurrent infection were marginal susceptibility of the organism to the originally injected antibiotics, infection with a slowly replicating organism, and infection with a gram-negative bacillus. a single intravitreal injection of antibiotics may only partially treat bacterial endophthalmitis. patients should be observed for at least 3 weeks following treatment of endophthalmitis for recurrence of their infection, and aggressive management, including vitrectomy and repeated intravitreal injections of antibiotics, should be used to treat recurrent infections.

TI  == antitumor effect of normal intestinal microflora on ehrlich ascites tumor.
AB  == in order to investigate the antitumor activity of intestinal microflora, the constitution of normal flora was examined in humans, guinea pigs and mice. it was clarified that eubacterium, bifidobacterium and bacteroides were the predominant  bacterial genera in humans. in addition, neither clostridium nor enterobacteriaceae was detected in guinea pigs and neither clostridium nor bifidobacterium was present in mice. total bacterial counts in tumor-bearing mice were reduced in comparison with those in normal mice. especially, in the ileum of tumor-bearing mice, the incidence of anaerobic bacterial genera was strikingly decreased. from the bacteria found, 59 living and killed strains isolated from intestinal microflora were examined for antitumor activity against ehrlich ascites tumor. it was observed that 11 of the tested strains had antitumor activity. four of these were toxic to the host, and in particular, all mice injected with pseudomonas aeruginosa (tym-8) died within several days. eubacterium lentum (tyh-11), propionibacterium acnes (tym-28), proteus mirabilis  (tym-7) and serratia marcescens (ty-142), in which antitumor activity was recognized with living and formalin-killed bacteria, cured the tumor-bearing mice, and the culture supernatant of s. marcescens contained apparent antitumor activity.

TI  == in vitro study of the antibacterial activity of ofloxacin against recent clinical isolates.
AB  == the in vitro activity of ofloxacin, a new broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent, was studied by a standardized single disc method. a total of 990 clinical isolates were tested, including 20 strains of anaerobic bacteria. ofloxacin was highly active against 683 strains (70.41%), had intermediate activity against 109 (11.23%) and had no activity against 178 (18.35%). ofloxacin was highly active against e. coli, klebsiella sp., citrobacter sp., proteus mirabilis, proteus morganii, salmonella sp., campylobacter jejuni, haemophilus influenzae, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, eubacterium sp., propionibacterium acnes and streptococcus sp. pseudomonas sp., serratia sp. and proteus vulgaris had percentages of resistance to ofloxacin of 37.11%, 32% and 33.33% respectively. high percentages of resistance to ofloxacin  were found only for providencia sp., proteus rettgeri and bacteroides fragilis. with regard to streptococcus faecalis, the results obtained with the disc procedure were not reliable and mic determination was necessary to assess the behaviour of the drug.

TI  == response of bacterial antigen in palmoplantar pustulosis.
AB  == motilities of leukocytes in response to bacterial antigens or sera were examined  in tissues from patients with palmoplantar pustulosis (ppp). accelerated migration towards bacterial antigens was detected in the case of staphylococcus epidermidis in 9 of 19 patients, to propionibacterium acnes in 5 of 19, to proteus mirabilis and staphylococcus aureus in 3 of 19, while no acceleration was found in neutrophils from the controls. a significantly accelerated migration of  normal lymphocytes in response to both patients' and control sera was nil. inhibition of migration of guinea pig peritoneal exudate cells mixed with lymphocytes from ppp patients was detected in 12 out of 14 patients with the addition of s. epidermidis antigen and 8 of 14 with the addition of p. acnes antigen, while no such inhibition was detected in all 7 controls. the accelerated migration of neutrophils and inhibition of macrophages may participate in the development of ppp.

TI  == [growth of non-sporing anaerobes in an oxygen-free blood culture system (author's transl)].
AB  == the efficacy of the commercially available vacutainer blood culture system to support the growth of non-sporing anaerobes was compared with two laboratory-prepared blood culture media (supplemented thioglycollate medium and brain heart infusion). the media were inoculated with 10, 100 and 1000 organisms  of the species tested, and the number of colony-forming units was determined at intervals of 8-10 hrs. analogous experiments were performed with batches of the media to which 10% vol/vol of human blood had been added. from the results obtained with strains of bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides splanchnicus, sphaerophorus necrophorus, peptostreptococcus anaerobius and propionibacterium acnes it became obvious that growth of non-sporing anaerobes was significantly enhanced in the vacutainer culture tubes, whereas enterobacteriaceae and streptococcus spp. grew equally well in all the media tested.
