TI  == new hybrid materials based on poly(ethyleneoxide)-grafted polysilazane by hydrosilylation and their anti-fouling activities.
AB  == the objective of this work was to develop new coating materials based on poly(ethyleneoxide) (peo), which was grafted onto polysilazane (psz) by hydrosilylation. three types of peo with different molecular weights (350, 750, 2000 g/mol) were studied. the kinetics and yields of this reaction have been surveyed by (1)h and (13)c nmr spectroscopy. the peo grafting-density onto psz by hydrosilylation increases with a reduction of the s-h/allyl ratio and a decrease  of the peo chain-length. the peo-graft-psz (psz-peo) hybrid coatings, which can be used to prevent the adhesion of marine bacteria on surfaces, were applied by moisture curing at room temperature. the anti-adhesion performance, and thus the  anti-fouling activity, of the coatings against three marine bacteria species, clostridium sp. sr1, neisseria sp. lc1 and neisseria sp. sc1, was examined. the anti-fouling activity of the coatings depends on the grafting density and the chain length of peo. the shortest peo(350 g/mol)-graft-psz with the highest graft density was found to have the best anti-fouling activity. as the density of grafted peo(750 g/mol) and peo(2000 g/mol) chains onto the psz surface is approximately equal, the relative effectiveness of these two types of peo is controlled by the length of the peo chain. the peo(2000 g/mol)-graft-psz coatings are more efficient than the peo(750 g/mol)-graft-psz coatings for the bacterial anti-adhesion.

TI  == adrenal gland hemorrhage in patients with fatal bacterial infections.
AB  == a wide spectrum of adrenal gland pathology is seen during bacterial infections. hemorrhage is particularly associated with meningococcemia, while abscesses have  been described with several neonatal infections. we studied adrenal gland histopathology of 65 patients with bacterial infections documented in a variety of tissues by using immunohistochemistry. the infections diagnosed included neisseria meningitidies, group a streptococcus, rickettsia rickettsii, streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, ehrlichia sp., bacillus anthracis, leptospira sp., clostridium sp., klebsiella sp., legionella sp., yersinia pestis, and treponema pallidum. bacteria were detected in the adrenal of 40 (61%) cases. adrenal hemorrhage was present in 39 (60%) cases. bacteria or bacterial antigens were observed in 31 (79%) of the cases with adrenal hemorrhage including 14 with n. meningitidis, four with r. rickettsii, four with s. pneumoniae, three with group a streptococcus, two with s. aureus, two with b. anthracis, one with t. pallidum, and one with legionella sp. bacterial antigens were observed in nine of 26 non-hemorrhagic adrenal glands that showed inflammatory foci (four cases), edema (two cases), congestion (two cases), or necrosis (one case). hemorrhage is the most frequent adrenal gland pathology observed in fatal bacterial infections. bacteria and bacterial antigens are frequently seen in adrenal glands with hemorrhage and may play a pathogenic role. although n. meningitidis is the most frequent bacteria associated with adrenal gland pathology, a broad collection of bacteria can also cause adrenal lesions.

TI  == the effect of decreasing alkalinity on microbial community dynamics in a sulfate-reducing bioreactor as analyzed by pcr-sscp.
AB  == pcr-single-strand conformation polymorphism (sscp) and southern blotting techniques were adopted to investigate microbial community dynamics in a sulfate-reducing bioreactor caused by decreasing influent alkalinity. experimental results indicated that the sulfate-removal rate approached 87% in 25 d under the conditions of influent alkalinity of 4000 mg/l (as caco3) and sulfate-loading rate of 4.8 g/(l*d), which indicated that the bioreactor started  up successfully. the analysis of microbial community structure in this stage showed that lactococcus sp., anaerofilum sp. and kluyvera sp. were dominant populations. it was found that when influent alkalinity reduced to 1000 mg/l, sulfate-removal rate decreased rapidly to 35% in 3 d. then influent alkalinity was increased to 3000 mg/l, the sulfate-removal rate rose to 55%. under these conditions, the populations of dysgonomonas sp., sporobacte sp., obesumbacterium  sp. and clostridium sp. got to rich, which predominated in the community together with lactococcus sp., anaerofilum sp. and kluyvera sp. however, when the alkalinity was decreased to 1500 mg/l, the sulfate-removal rate rose to and kept  stable at 70% and populations of dysgonomonas sp., sporobacter sp. and obesumbacterium sp. died out, while some strains of desulfovibrio sp. and clostridium sp. increased in concentration. in order to determine the minimum alkalinity value that the system could tolerate, the influent alkalinity was decreased from 1500 to 400 mg/l secondly. this resulted in the sulfate-removal rate, ph value and effluent alkalinity dropping quickly. the amount of petrotoga  sp., prevotella sp., kluyvera sp. and neisseria sp. reduced obviously. the result data from southern blotting indicated that the amount of sulfate-reducing bacteria (srbs) decreased with influent alkalinity dropping. analysis of the microbial community structure and diversity showed that the srbs populations were very abundant in the inoculated activated sludge and the alkalinity decrease caused the reduction of the populations noted. most of resident populations in the bioreactor were fermentative acidogenic bacteria (fabs), among which the phylum firmicute was in the majority, but srbs were very few. this community structure demonstrates the cooperation between srbs and fabs, which sustains the  system's high sulfate-removal and operation stability.

TI  == detection of bacterial dna in latin american patients with reactive arthritis by  polymerase chain reaction and sequencing analysis.
AB  == objective: bacteria and/or their antigens are thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of reactive arthritis (rea). polymerase chain reaction (pcr) using the 16s ribosomal rna-pcr method was used to identify bacterial dna in synovial fluid (sf) and tissue (st) in a well defined group of patients with chronic rea.  in addition, species found were identified by means of sequence analysis. methods: we examined 15 st and 5 sf samples of 15 patients with rea, 5 st samples of 5 patients with osteoarthritis (oa), and 8 sf from 8 patients with closed traumatic knee injuries using a nested pcr with universal 16s rrna primers. in addition, a nested pcr was developed to detect dna sequences of salmonella sp. and mycoplasma sp. automated sequencing and comparative data analysis (genbank) were also performed to identify the species. results: bacterial dna was identified in 8 cases, 5 st and 3 sf; chlamydia trachomatis (n = 2), pseudomonas  sp. (n = 3), and bacillus cereus (n = 2) were the most common microorganisms identified. a variety of microorganisms including clostridium sp., lactobacillus  sp., pseudomonas migulae, p. fluorescens, and p. putida, and neisseria meningitidis serogroup b were also identified. in half of the cases (4/8) 2 to 3  bacterial antigens were identified simultaneously. conclusion: bacterial dna is present in the joints in patients with chronic rea. a wide spectrum of bacteria including some not previously associated with rea were identified. further studies are needed to establish their exact role in the pathogenesis of rea and related arthritides.

TI  == comparative genomics and evolution of genes encoding bacterial (p)ppgpp synthetases/hydrolases (the rel, rela and spot proteins).
AB  == in the gram-negative model organism escherichia coli, the effector molecule of the stringent response, (p)ppgpp, is synthesized by two different enzymes, rela and spot, whereas in the gram-positive model organism bacillus subtilis only one  enzyme named rel is responsible for this activity. rel and spot also possess (p)ppgpp hydrolase activity. blast searches were used to identify orthologous genes in databases. the construction and bootstrapping of phylogenetic trees allowed classification of these orthologs. four groups could be distinguished: with the exception of neisseria and bordetella (beta subdivision), the rela and spot groups are exclusively found in the gamma subdivision of proteobacteria. two rel groups representing the actinobacterial and the bacillus/clostridium group were also identified. the spot proteins are related to the gram positive rel proteins. rela proteins carry substitutions in the hd domain (aravind and koonin, 1998, tibs 23: 469-472) responsible for ppgpp degradation. a theory for the evolution of the specialized, paralogous rela and spot genes is presented: after  gene duplication of an ancestral rellike gene, the spot and rela genes evolved from the duplicated genes. the distribution pattern of the paralogous rela and spot proteins supports a new model of linear bacterial evolution (gupta, 2000, fems microbiol. rev. 24: 367-402). this model postulates that the gamma subdivision of proteobacteria represents the most recently evolved bacterial lineage. however, two paralogous, closely related genes of porphyromonas gingivalis (cytophaga-flavobacterium-bacteroides phylum) encoding proteins with functions probably identical to the rela and spot proteins do not fit in this model. completely sequenced genomes of several obligately parasitic organisms (treponema pallidum, chlamydia species, rickettsia prowazekii) and the obligate aphid symbiont buchnera sp. aps as well as archaea do not contain rel-like genes  but they are present in the arabidopsis genome. in crosslinking experiments using different analogs of ppgpp as crosslinking reagents and rna polymerase preparations of escherichia coli, binding of ppgpp to distinct regions at the c-terminus of the beta subunit (the rpob gene product) and/or at the n-terminus of the beta subunit (the rpoc gene product) was observed previously. rpob and rpoc sequences of the species which do not possess a rel like gene do not exhibit specific insertions or deletions in the ppgpp binding regions.

TI  == [susceptibility of bacteria isolated from clinical material to ciprofloxacin].
AB  == the aim of the study was to evaluate susceptibility to ciprofloxacin of bacteria  species isolated from different specimens of clinical materials. the investigated strains (830) were identified using conventional methods. the antibacterial activity of ciprofloxacin was studied by the method of drug dilution in mueller-hinton agar. among aerobic bacteria, only 5 strains (0.6%) were resistant to ciprofloxacin in concentration 4 micrograms/ml; two belonged to e. coli species, two to s. aureus and one was a streptococcus group b., corynebacterium sp. mic90 = 0.12 microgram/ml turned out to be most resistant, next, gram-negative rods mic90 = 0.5 microgram/ml, coagulase-negative and positive staphylococci and neisseria sp. mic90 = 1.0 microgram/ml. enterococcus faecalis and anaerobes were the least susceptible to ciprofloxacin. their mic90 was 2 and  16 micrograms/ml respectively. among 20 anaerobic strains, up to 10 were resistant to ciprofloxacin, mainly from bacteroides and clostridium genus.

TI  == in vitro activity of two new aryl-fluoroquinolone antimicrobial agents, difloxacin (a-56619) and a-56620 compared to that of other antimicrobial agents.
AB  == the in vitro activity of difloxacin (a-56619) and a-56620, two new aryl-difluoroquinolones, was compared to that of other new quinolones and several parenteral and oral antimicrobial agents. a-56620 inhibited 90% of enterobacteriaceae at less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, staphylococcus aureus 0.25 micrograms/ml, hemolytic streptococci 2 micrograms/ml, pseudomonas aeruginosa 2 micrograms/ml, bacteroides sp. and clostridium at 8 micrograms/ml. a-56620 was equal or 2-fold more active than norfloxacin and ofloxacin, and 2-8-fold less active than ciprofloxacin. difloxacin had similar in vitro activity with many isolates but usually was 2-8-fold less active than a-56620. both agents inhibited beta-lactamase positive haemophilus influenzae (mic 0.015 micrograms/ml) and neisseria gonorrhoeae (mk less than or equal to 0.008 micrograms/ml). both agents were more active against streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae than norfloxacin, ofloxacin and enoxacin, but not more active than ciprofloxacin. they inhibited enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii and serratia marcescens resistant to cephalosporins and methicillin-resistant s. aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. spontaneously resistant mutants were seen with enterobacteriaceae, p. aeruginosa and s. aureus  at a frequency similar to that found for other new quinolones. these agents show  overall in vitro activity comparable to other quinolones in clinical trial or recently approved for clinical use.

TI  == [in vitro activity of a new 3d-generation cephalosporin, cefodizime, on hospital  bacteria].
AB  == minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of cefodizime were evaluated by agar dilution for 746 bacterial strains isolated in two hospitals. for enterobacteriaceae mics ranged from 0.008 micrograms/ml to more than 128 micrograms/ml (mode mic: 0.25); mode mics varied across species, ranging from 0.016 micrograms/ml for proteus mirabilis to 1 microgram/ml for citrobacter; mics ranged from 0.12 to 8 for most enterobacter and from 1 to 64 for serratia. the rare cefotaxime-resistant strains, most of which were citrobacter or enterobacter, also showed resistance to cefodizime. cefodizime was noticeably less active against pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter, with mics ranging from 32 to more than 128. haemophilus sp. and gonococci, regardless of beta-lactamase-production status, as well as neisseria meningitidis, were highly  susceptible (mic less than or equal to 0.008-0.016). cefodizime was moderately active against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (mic: 2 to 16 micrograms/ml) and failed to inhibit methicillin-resistant strains. enterococci were slightly susceptible or resistant. whereas the other streptococci and pneumococci had low  mics (0.03-0.12). a fairly wide range of mics was found for anaerobes, with lower values for clostridium (0.008 to 1) than for bacteroids (8 to 128 mu g/ml). our results show that cefodizime has the same properties as other third-generation cephalosporins: cefotaxime-resistant enterobacteriaceae strains also exhibit resistance to cefodizime.

TI  == [multicenter study of the in vitro effect of imipenem (n-formimidoyl-thienamycin) on hospital bacteria].
AB  == minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of imipenem were evaluated by agar dilution for 2 895 bacterial strains isolated in 9 hospitals. imipenem proved highly active against enterobacteriaceae, with an mic less than or equal to 0.25  for 63% of the 1 556 tested strains, less than or equal to 1 for 89.6% and less than or equal to 4 for 99%. the different groups of enterobacteriaceae exhibited  similar mode mics (0.12 to 0.25), with the exception of serratia (0.25-0.5), p. mirabilis (0.5), indole-positive proteus (2), and providencia (1). mics of most cefotaxime-resistant strains were within the susceptibility range. imipenem also  exhibited satisfactory activity against p. aeruginosa (mode mic 1-2) and acinetobacter sp. (mode mic: 0.25-0.5). mics ranged from 0.03 to 4 (mode mic: 0.5) for haemophilus sp. and 0.25 to 1 for gonococci, regardless of beta-lactamase-production status. mics for meningococci were less than or equal to 0,06. methicillin-susceptible staphylococci had low mics, ranging from 0.008 to 0.5 (mode mic : 0.016); mics for methicillin-resistant strains varied widely,  from 0.016 to 64, and were higher after incubation at 30 degrees c. streptococci, except for enterococci, and pneumococci were highly susceptible (usually 0.008-0.03); mics for enterococci varied from 0,12 to 32 (mode mic: 1-2). except  for four c. difficile strains, all tested anaerobic strains were inhibited by concentrations less than or equal to 1 (mode mics: 0.06 for c. perfringens and 0.03 for b. fragilis).

TI  == [in vitro activity of ceftriaxone on hospital bacteria. results of a multicenter  study].
AB  == minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of ceftriaxone were determined by agar dilution for 2 099 strains isolated in six teaching hospitals. mics were less than 1 microgram/ml for the great majority of enterobacteriaceae, with mode mics  varying across groups from less than 0.008 micrograms/ml for proteus (mirabilis and indole-positive) to 0.25 for enterobacter. only a few resistant strains were  found, mainly among enterobacter and citrobacter. ceftriaxone proved noticeably less active against p. aeruginosa and acinetobacter (mode mics: 16 micrograms/ml). haemophilus sp. and gonococci, regardless of beta-lactamase production status, as well as neisseria meningitidis, were highly susceptible (mic less than 0.008-0.032). ceftriaxone was moderately active against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (mic: 2 to 8 micrograms/ml) and failed to inhibit methicillin resistant strains. enterococci were slightly susceptible or resistant, whereas the other streptococci and pneumococci had low mics (0.03-0.25). a fairly wide range of mics was found for anaerobes (clostridium: 0.06-2, bacteroides: 0.5-32). our data show that its particularly strong activity against proteus, haemophilus and neisseria sets ceftriaxone apart from the other  third-generation cephalosporins.

TI  == [in vitro activity of ceftizoxime on hospital bacteria. results of a multicenter  study].
AB  == the susceptibility to ceftizoxime of all bacterial strains isolated from seven university-affiliated hospitals over one month was tested with disk-diffusion technique. additionally, the mic of 1937 strains selected at random was evaluated by the agar dilution method. the majority of enterobacteriaceae are inhibited at  a concentration of less than 1 microgram/ml with a mode mic varying from 0.008 to 0.12 among the various groups. a few enterobacter and citrobacter strains are resistant. little activity was demonstrated by ceftizoxime on pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter sp. (mode mic 32 and 8 micrograms/ml respectively).  haemophilus sp. (mic 0.01-0.03) and neisseria (mic less than 0,008-0,016) are very susceptible to the drug. the mic of methicillin-sensitive strains of staphylococcus aureus varies from 1 to 4 micrograms/ml ; enterococci are less susceptible, whereas other streptococci and pneumococci have low mics (less than  0.008-0.025). the susceptibility of anaerobic pathogens varies widely between species, and within species ; mic ranges from 0.008 to 32 micrograms/ml for clostridium sp. and 0.25 to 128 micrograms/ml for bacteroides sp.

TI  == microbial flora of the lower genital tract of women in labour in zaria, nigeria.
AB  == nine genera of microbes isolated from the lower genital tract of 187 women in labour in zaria have been identified. the work was undertaken to establish the nature of microorganisms in the lower genital tract of women in labour as a basis for further study. the isolates in order of prevalence were: candida albicans (20.9%), klebsiella sp (15.0%), escherichia coli (9.1%), streptococcus faecalis (6.4%), haemolytic streptococci (other than streptococcus pyogenes (2.7%), streptococcus viridans (2.1%), staphylococcus aureus (2.1%), aeromonas hydrophila (2.1%), proteus mirabilis (1.1%), peptostreptococcus putridus (1.1%), streptococcus pyogenes (0.5%), and streptococcus pneumoniae (0.5%). neisseria gonorrhoeae, haemophilus sp, lactobacillus sp, and clostridium sp were sought but not found. chlamydia, viruses, and t-strains of mycoplasma and trichomonas were not sought. it appears from this study that the lower genital tract of most women in zaria at the time of labour is heavily colonised by pathogens. for this reason alone prolonged labour and trauma to the genital tract at the time of delivery should be avoided.
