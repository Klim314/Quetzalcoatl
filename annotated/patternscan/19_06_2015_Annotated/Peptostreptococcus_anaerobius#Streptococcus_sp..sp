TI  == antimicrobial activity of preparation bioaron c.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of sirupus bioaron c, a preparation, whose main ingredient is an extract from the leaves of aloe arborescens, was tested against  different microorganisms isolated from patients with upper respiratory tract infections. the experiments were performed on 40 strains: 20 strains of anaerobic bacteria, 13 strains of aerobic bacteria and 7 strains of yeast-like fungi from the genus candida and on 18 reference strains (atcc). the antimicrobial activity  of bioaron c (mbc and mfc) was determined at undiluted concentration. bioaron c proved to be very effective against the microorganisms causing infections. at the concentration recommended by the producer, the preparation showed biocidal activity (mbc, mfc) against the strains of the pathogenic microorganisms, which cause respiratory infections most frequently, including, among others, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, parvimonas micra, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus anginosus, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and candida albicans, already after 15 min. the mic of bioaron c against most of the tested microorganisms was 5 to 100 times lower than the usually applied concentration. the great antimicrobial activity means that the preparation may be used in the prevention and treatment of infections of the upper respiratory tract. bioaron c  may be an alternative or complement to classical therapy, especially in children.

TI  == efficacy and safety of intravenous azithromycin followed by oral azithromycin for the treatment of acute pelvic inflammatory disease and perihepatitis in japanese  women.
AB  == pelvic inflammatory disease (pid) is mainly caused by ascending infection from the vaginal flora including the sexually transmitted organisms, neisseria gonorrhoeae and chlamydia trachomatis, and lower genital tract endogenous anaerobes, leading to serious consequences including infertility and ectopic pregnancy. to evaluate the efficacy and safety of azithromycin in the treatment of pid that requires initial intravenous therapy, we conducted a multicenter, unblinded, non-comparative phase 3 trial. intravenous azithromycin (500 mg, once  daily) for 1 or 2 days followed by oral azithromycin (250 mg once daily) to complete a total of 7 days treatment was administered to 60 japanese women with acute pid. the clinical and bacteriological responses were assessed at the end of treatment, and on days 15 and 29. the most commonly detected baseline causative pathogens were c. trachomatis (12 strains), prevotella bivia (10 strains), streptococcus agalactiae (7 strains), n. gonorrhoeae and peptostreptococcus anaerobius (6 strains each). the clinical success rate on day 15 was 94.1% (48/51 subjects including perihepatitis). the clinical efficacy and bacterial eradication rates against c. trachomatis and n. gonorrhoeae (including 2 quinolone-resistant strains) were both 100%. common treatment-related adverse events were diarrhoea, injection site pain, and nausea. all adverse events were mild or moderate in severity. azithromycin intravenous-to-oral switch therapy demonstrated excellent clinical and bacteriological effects for pid caused by various etiologic agents including quinolone-resistant strains and strains with low susceptibility to azithromycin at in vitro testing. the therapy was well tolerated in the treatment of pid in japanese women. registration number: nct00871494.

TI  == bacteriological evaluation of tonsillar microbial flora according to age and tonsillar size in recurrent tonsillitis.
AB  == although numerous studies based on the bacteriology of the tonsil have been carried out, none of them analyzed the variation of tonsillar flora with respect  to both age and tonsillar size. the purpose of this study was to isolate the facultative and obligate anaerobes both from the surface and the core of tonsils  in recurrent tonsillitis as well as to analyze the variation of isolated bacterial strains according to age and tonsillar size. a prospective study was performed on 111 patients who underwent tonsillectomy. we analyzed the differences between the bacterial pathogens in recurrent tonsillitis and semi-growth estimates with regard to age and tonsillar grade. among 111 cases, 604 bacterial strains of 21 different from the tonsil superficial and core were isolated. the most common facultative anaerobic species isolated from the surface and core were coagulase-negative staphylococci, alpha-hemolytic streptococci and  diphtheroid bacilli in all subgroups except patients below 8 years old. the most  commonly obligate anaerobic species isolated from the core were propionibacterium acnes, prevotella melaninogenica and peptostreptococcus anaerobius. we found no significant difference in the cultured bacteria with respect to age and tonsillar size. the study subgroups did not differ in the occurrence of semiquantitative growth estimates of 3-4+. our study demonstrates that there is polymicrobial aerobic and anaerobic flora in tonsils with regardless of patient's age and tonsillar size. this polymicrobial spectrum of bacteria may contribute to recurrence and to the failure of conservative treatment of these cases and therefore leads to surgical therapy.

TI  == subgingival microflora in inflammatory bowel disease patients with untreated periodontitis.
AB  == objective: to analyze the subgingival microflora composition of inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) patients with untreated chronic periodontitis and compare them with systemically healthy controls also having untreated chronic periodontitis. method: thirty ibd patients [15 with crohn's disease (cd) and 15 with ulcerative colitis (uc)] and 15 control individuals participated in the study. all patients had been diagnosed with untreated chronic periodontitis. from every patient, subgingival plaque was collected from four gingivitis and four periodontitis sites with paper points. samples from the same category (gingivitis or periodontitis) in each patient were pooled together and stored at -70 degrees  c until analysis using a checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique for 74 bacterial species. results: multiple-comparison analysis showed that the groups differed in bacterial counts for bacteroides ureolyticus, campylobacter gracilis, parvimonas micra, prevotella melaninogenica, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus mutans, and treponema denticola (p<0.001). cd  patients had significantly higher levels of these bacteria than uc patients either in gingivitis or in periodontitis sites (p<0.05). cd patients harbored higher levels of p. melaninogenica, s. aureus, s. anginosus, and s. mutans compared with controls both at gingivitis and at periodontitis sites (p<0.05). uc patients harbored higher levels of s. aureus (p=0.01) and p. anaerobius (p=0.05)  than controls only in gingivitis sites. conclusion: our study showed that even with similar clinical periodontal parameters, ibd patients harbor higher levels of bacteria that are related to opportunistic infections in inflamed subgingival  sites that might be harmful for the crucial microbe-host interaction.

TI  == effects of adding polyclonal antibody preparations on ruminal fermentation patterns and digestibility of cows fed different energy sources.
AB  == nine ruminally cannulated cows fed different energy sources were used to evaluate an avian-derived polyclonal antibody preparation (pap-mv) against the specific ruminal bacteria streptococcus bovis, fusobacterium necrophorum, clostridium aminophilum, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and clostridium sticklandii and monensin (mon) on ruminal fermentation patterns and in vivo digestibility. the experimental design was three 3 x 3 latin squares distinguished by the main energy source in the diet [dry-ground corn grain (cg), high-moisture corn silage  (hmcs), or citrus pulp (cipu)]. inside each latin square, animals received one of the feed additives per period [none (con), mon, or pap-mv]. dry matter intake and ruminal fermentation variables such as ph, total short-chain fatty acids (tscfa), which included acetate, propionate, and butyrate, as well as lactic acid and nh(3)-n concentration were analyzed in this trial. total tract dm apparent digestibility and its fractions were estimated using chromic oxide as an external marker. each experimental period lasted 21 d. ruminal fluid sampling was carried  out on the last day of the period at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 h after the morning meal. ruminal ph was higher (p = 0.006) 4 h postfeeding in mon and pap-mv groups when compared with con. acetate:propionate ratio was greater in pap-mv compared with mon across sampling times. polyclonal antibodies did not alter (p > 0.05) tscfa, molar proportion of acetate and butyrate, or lactic acid and nh(3)-n concentration. ruminal ph was higher (p = 0.01), 4 h postfeeding in cipu diets compared with cg and hmcs. there was no interaction between feed additive and energy source (p > 0.05) for any of the digestibility coefficients analyzed. starch digestibility was less (p = 0.008) in pap-mv when compared with con and mon. in relation to energy sources, ndf digestibility was greater (p = 0.007) in  cg and cipu vs. the hmcs diet. the digestibility of adf was greater (p = 0.002) in cipu diets followed by cg and hmcs. feeding pap-mv or monensin altered ruminal fermentation patterns and digestive function in cows; however, those changes were independent of the main energy source of the diet.

TI  == competition between yogurt probiotics and periodontal pathogens in vitro.
AB  == objective: to investigate the competition between probiotics in bio-yogurt and periodontal pathogens in vitro. material and methods: the antimicrobial activity  of bio-yogurt was studied by agar diffusion assays, using eight species of putative periodontal pathogens and a 'protective bacteria' as indicator strains.  four probiotic bacterial species (lactobacillus bulgaricus, streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus acidophilus, and bifidobacterium) were isolated from  yogurt and used to rate the competitive exclusion between probiotics and periodontal pathogens. results: fresh yogurt inhibited all the periodontal pathogens included in this work, showing inhibition zones ranging from 9.3 (standard deviation 0.6) mm to 17.3 (standard deviation 1.7) mm, whereas heat-treated yogurt showed lower antimicrobial activity. in addition, neither fresh yogurt nor heat-treated yogurt inhibited the 'protective bacteria', streptococcus sanguinis. the competition between yogurt probiotics and periodontal pathogens depended on the sequence of inoculation. when probiotics were inoculated first, bifidobacterium inhibited porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas circumdentaria, and prevotella nigrescens; l. acidophilus inhibited p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. circumdentaria, p. nigrescens, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius; l. bulgaricus inhibited p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, and p. nigrescens; and s. thermophilus inhibited p. gingivalis, f. nucleatum, and p. nigrescens. however, their antimicrobial properties were reduced when both species (probiotics and periodontal pathogens)  were inoculated simultaneously. when periodontal pathogens were inoculated first, prevotella intermedia inhibited bifidobacterium and s. thermophilus. conclusions: the results demonstrated that bio-yogurt and the probiotics that it contains are  capable of inhibiting specific periodontal pathogens but have no effect on the periodontal protective bacteria.

TI  == comparative evaluation of the antimicrobial efficacy of aloe vera tooth gel and two popular commercial toothpastes: an in vitro study.
AB  == aloe vera (aloe barbadensis miller) has been suggested for a wide variety of ailments but its use in dentistry is limited. this article reviews the uses of the plant and describes an in vitro investigation that compared the antimicrobial effectiveness of aloe vera tooth gel with two popular, commercially available dentifrices. the preliminary results showed that aloe vera tooth gel and the toothpastes were equally effective against candida albicans, streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus acidophilus, enterococcus faecalis, prevotella intermedia,  and peptostreptococcus anaerobius. aloe vera tooth gel demonstrated enhanced antibacterial effect against s. mitis.

TI  == the ability of non-bacteriocin producing streptococcus bovis strains to bind and  transfer bovicin hc5 to other sensitive bacteria.
AB  == streptococcus bovis hc5 produces a broad spectrum lantibiotic (bovicin hc5), but  s. bovis jb1 does not have antimicrobial activity. preliminary experiments revealed an anomaly. when s. bovis jb1 cells were washed in stationary phase s. bovis hc5 cell-free culture supernatant, the s. bovis jb1 cells were subsequently able to inhibit hyper-ammonia producing ruminal bacteria (clostridium sticklandii, clostridium aminophilum and peptostreptococcus anaerobius). other non-bacteriocin producing s. bovis strains also had the ability to bind and transfer semi-purified bovicin hc5. bovicin hc5 that was bound to s. bovis jb1 was much more resistant to pronase e than cell-free bovicin hc5, but it could be  inactivated if the incubation period was 24 h. acidic nacl treatment (100 mm, ph  2.0) liberates half of the bovicin hc5 from s. bovis hc5, but it did not prevent  bovicin hc5 from binding to s. bovis jb1. acidic nacl liberated some bovicin hc5  from s. bovis jb1, but the decrease in activity was only 2-fold. bovicin hc5 is a positively charged peptide, and the ability of s. bovis jb1 to bind bovicin hc5 could be inhibited by either calcium or magnesium (100 mm). acidic nacl-treated s. bovis jb1 cells were unable to accumulate potassium, but they were still able  to bind bovicin hc5 and prevent potassium accumulation by untreated s. bovis jb1  cells. based on these results, bovicin hc5 bound to s. bovis jb1 cells still acts as a pore-forming lantibiotic.

TI  == in vitro bactericidal activity of recombinant human beta-defensin-3 against pathogenic bacterial strains in human tooth root canal.
AB  == human beta-defensin-3 (hbd3), an endogenous antimicrobial peptide, has strong broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. this study aimed to obtain recombinant hbd3 (rhbd3) and to test the hypothesis that the antimicrobial characteristics of hbd3 may offer an advantage over conventional medicine in reducing intracanal bacteria. genetic engineering was used to obtain active rhbd3 and analysis revealed that it exhibited a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity at low micromolar concentrations against not only staphylococcus aureus and escherichia  coli but also against some critical pathogenic microbes in infected root canals,  including fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella melaninogenica, peptostreptococcus  anaerobius, streptococcus mutans, actinomyces naeslundii, enterococcus faecalis and candida albicans. in an in vitro antibacterial experiment, rhbd3 significantly eliminated pathogenic bacteria in root canals. the ratio of bacterial death was up to 98%. we conclude that hbd3 has the potential to eliminate bacteria effectively and rapidly in the local microenvironment of the root canal system and that it may contribute to successful endodontic treatment.

TI  == changes in abundance of lactobacillus spp. and streptococcus suis in the stomach, jejunum and ileum of piglets after weaning.
AB  == this present study investigated the changes in bacterial community composition, with an emphasis on lactobacillus spp. and streptococcus suis populations as potentially beneficial and harmful groups, in the stomach, jejunum and ileum of piglets after weaning (21 days postpartum) by 16s rrna gene-based methods. denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis showed that, after weaning, predominant bands related to lactobacillus spp. disappeared and were replaced by  potential pathogenic species, such as peptostreptococcus anaerobius, moraxella cuniculi, s. suis and porphyromonas catoniae. real-time pcr revealed that the abundances of lactobacilli and lactobacillus sobrius as a proportion of total bacterial abundance were significantly lower in the stomach, jejunum and ileum of weaned piglets than in 21-day-old piglets. a specific and sensitive real-time pcr assay was developed for quantification of the important pathogen s. suis within gastrointestinal microbiota. the assay showed that s. suis predominated in the stomach samples of weaned piglets with population levels up to 10(7) copies g(-1) digesta, while it was not detected in the stomach before weaning. streptococcus suis was not dominant in the jejunum and ileum digesta before weaning, but became dominant after weaning, with population levels up to 10(7) copies g(-1) digesta.  the results demonstrated for the first time the postweaning dominance of the potentially harmful s. suis in piglet intestine. the results also suggest that the defensive barrier of the stomach can be impaired as s. suis became dominant while the proportion of lactobacillus populations decreased after weaning, which  may further result in an increase of s. suis abundance in the intestine.

TI  == production of antagonistic substance by eikenella corrodens isolated from the oral cavity of human beings with and without periodontal disease.
AB  == aims: antagonistic abilities may confer ecological advantages for micro-organisms in competitive ecosystems. however, reports regarding this phenomenon in eikenella corrodens are not available. methods and results: nineteen e. corrodens strains, isolated from the oral cavity of human beings without periodontal disease (n = 5) and with aggressive (n = 9) and chronic (n = 5) periodontitis, as well as a reference strain (e. corrodens atcc23834), were evaluated for antagonistic activity. the following indicators were used: porphyromonas gingivalis fdc381, prevotella intermedia atcc25611, actinomyces israelii atcc12102, eubacterium lentum atcc25559, peptostreptococcus anaerobius atcc27337, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans fdcy4, fusobacterium nucleatum atcc10953, streptococcus sanguinis atcc10557, streptococcus uberis atcc9927, streptococcus mutans im/ufrj, staphylococcus aureus atcc33591 and candida albicans atcc18804. all the strains showed antagonism against at least one of the indicator strains.  this phenomenon was more frequently observed for strains isolated from patients with chronic periodontitis (36.4%), than those from healthy subjects (20.6%) and  those with aggressive periodontitis (10.8%). conclusions: the heterogeneous antagonistic spectrum exhibited by e. corrodens isolates suggests their ability to produce more than one antagonistic substance, whose ecological relevance is yet to be demonstrated. significance and impact of the study: this is the first description of antagonistic compound production by e. corrodens and its relationships with the clinical status of the patients.

TI  == [microbiocenosis of stomach in children with chronic gastritis].
AB  == qualitative and quantitative composition of gastric microflora has been studied in 30 children with chronic gastritis. bacteriological study of gastric biopsies  and parietal mucus in 10 children with chronic gastritis not associated with helicobacter pylori more frequently revealed conditionally pathogenic bacteria--escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus viridans, s. pyogenes (group a), peptostreptococcus anaerobius, p. prevotii and their associations. in 20 studied patients with h.pylori-associated chronic gastritis composition of local microflora was less diverse--conditionally pathogenic, lacto- and bifidobacteria often were absent. study showed that eradication of h.  pylori led to appearance of conditionally pathogenic bacteria in stomach microflora, which were frequently isolated in associations. not effective treatment was associated with disappearance of lacto- and bifidobacteria and frequent isolation of candida albicans.

TI  == coaggregation interactions between oral and endodontic enterococcus faecalis and  bacterial species isolated from persistent apical periodontitis.
AB  == interactions between enterococcus faecalis and other species found in root canal  infections might be important for the development and persistence of periapical disease. the aim of this study was to investigate the coaggregation interactions  between e. faecalis clinical isolates and species previously shown to survive and induce apical periodontitis in monkeys: peptostreptococcus anaerobius, prevotella oralis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and streptococcus anginosus. intergeneric coaggregation assays were conducted in duplicate with observations scored immediately at 0 h, 1 h and 24 h after mixing of combinations of strains. all e.  faecalis strains (n = 53) coaggregated with f. nucleatum; e. faecalis did not coaggregate with p. anaerobius or s. anginosus. one strain, e. faecalis e1, coaggregated with p. oralis, with aggregates visible at 1 h. coaggregation interactions between e. faecalis and f. nucleatum observed in this study suggest  a potential role for this combination in endodontic infections.

TI  == an in vitro time-kill assessment of linezolid and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == linezolid is a novel oxazolidinone antibacterial agent active against staphylococci (including methicillin-resistant strains), enterococci (including vancomycin-resistant strains), streptococci (including penicillin-intermediate and -resistant streptococcus pneumoniae), and other aerobic and facultative bacteria. the agent has also demonstrated activity against a broad spectrum of gram-positive and gram-negative anaerobic bacteria. previous time-kill assessments have shown linezolid to be generally bacteriostatic against staphylococci and enterococci, and bactericidal against streptococci. in this study, an anaerobic glovebox technique was employed to conduct time-kill assessments for four strains of anaerobic gram-positive, and seven strains of anaerobic gram-negative bacteria. the time-kill experiment was performed using anaerobe broth medium. the drugs were tested at four-fold the minimum inhibitory  concentration (mic), or at the higher concentration of 8mg/l for linezolid, 2mg/l for clindamycin, and 8mg/l for metronidazole. samples for viable count were taken at 0, 6, and 24h, and plated using the bioscience international autospiral dw. exposure of samples to the aerobic environment during plating was held to less than 30min. plates were counted after a 48h anaerobic incubation (37 degrees c).  the species tested included bacteroides fragilis (2), b. distasonis, b. thetaiotaomicron, fusobacterium nucleatum, f. varium, prevotella melaninogenica,  clostridium perfringens, eubacterium lentum and peptostreptococcus anaerobius (2). the activity of linezolid was compared to that of metronidazole and clindamycin, two standard anti-anaerobe agents. as expected, the control agents were very active in these assays. metronidazole yielded log(10)cfu/ml reductions  of 3.0 or greater for nine of ten strains; clindamycin yielded log(10)cfu/ml reductions of 2.0 or greater for six of 11 strains, and 3.0 or greater for three  strains. linezolid also produced significant in vitro killing in this model achieving log(10)cfu/ml reductions of 2.0 or greater for six of 11 strains, and 3.0 or greater for four strains. the profile of activity was similar to that of clindamycin indicating that additional developmental studies of linezolid with anaerobic bacteria are warranted.

TI  == evaluation of 4 swab transport systems for the recovery of atcc and clinical strains with characterized resistance mechanisms.
AB  == despite limitations of swab transport systems (sts), many clinical samples and bacterial isolates are sent on these devices. we evaluated the performance of 4 commercial sts: m40 transystem (s1, copan italia, bovezzo, italy), uni-ter (s2, meus, piove di sacco, italy), euromed (s3, lab service, surbo, italy), and eurotubo (s4, deltalab, rubi, spain). survival of atcc and clinical strains with  characterized resistance mechanisms, stored at room temperature and using the roll-plate method (nccls m40-a) after holding times of 0, 6, 24, 48, and 72 h, and 7 days, was assessed. after 24 h, only s1 was able to maintain streptococcus  pneumoniae (atcc 6305), haemophilus influenzae (10211), and neisseria meningitidis (13090) viability with a percentage range of recovery with respect to the baseline count at zero time of 104-184%. neisseria gonorrhoeae (43069) was uncultivable after 6 h with all sts except s1 (46% recovery). eighteen percent recovery after 24 h and 7% after 6 h was observed for fusobacterium nucleatum (25586) and peptostreptococcus anaerobius (27337), respectively, but only with s1. resistance mechanisms in clinical isolates do not affect survival with any of the sts.

TI  == [two cases of bartholin's gland abscesses caused by streptococcus pneumoniae and  haemophilus influenzae].
AB  == most of bartholin's gland abscesses have been thought to be caused by microorganisms found in opportunistic infections. however, we have encountered two very interesting cases of bartholin's gland abscesses caused by streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae, two major pathogens of respiratory tract infections. in the first case, since abscess formation was not observed due to disintegration, cefdinir (cfdn), 300 mg/day, t.i.d. for 5 days was administered.  the treatment improved clinical symptoms, but relapse occurred 3 days after the administration was discontinued. microbiological examination of pus revealed the  presence of streptococcus pneumoniae and finegoldia magna, and it also showed that the isolated s. pneumoniae was penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp). after an incision and drainage of abscess, cefteram pivoxil (cftm-pi), 300 mg/day t.i.d. for 7 days, was administered, and the cure was confirmed. in the second case, after an incision and drainage of bartholin's gland abscess, amoxicillin (ampc), 750 mg/day, t.i.d. for 5 days, was administered. the treatment improved clinical symptoms temporarily. however, the symptoms deteriorated 7 days after the operation, and the patient was diagnosed with relapse. microbiological examination of pus revealed the presence of haemophilus influenzae and peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and it also showed that the isolated h. influenzae was beta-lactamase-nonproducing ampicillin-resistant h. influenzae (blnar). after performing additional incision and drainage of abscess again, cftm-pi, 300 mg/day, t.i.d. for 7 days, was administered, and the cure was confirmed. in addition, the analysis of these two cases using pk/pd theory revealed that the time above mic reached 100% with administration of cftm-pi 300mg, t.i.d. suggesting that the dosage is sufficient for treating these infections. there are other cases of external genitalia infections caused by microorganisms usually associated with respiratory tract infections like cases that we are reporting here. therefore, it is necessary to consider a possible infection by drug-resistant bacteria even for a case of external genitalia infection. in addition, it was thought that adjusting dosage and method for administration of antibacterial agents based on pk/pd theory would help to rovide efficient treatment.

TI  == apical periodontitis development and bacterial response to endodontic treatment.  experimental root canal infections in monkeys with selected bacterial strains.
AB  == in six monkeys, 160 root canals were inoculated with a combination of four bacterial strains belonging to species streptococcus milleri, peptostreptococcus  anaerobius, prevotella oralis, and fusobacterium nucleatum. in two other monkeys, 24 root canals were inoculated with a five-strain combination consisting of these strains and a strain of enterococcus faecalis. all strains were previously isolated from an infected monkey root canal. after 8-12 months, survival of the strains was recorded bacteriologically, and the reaction in the periapical region was radiographed. from 180 of 184 root canals, one or more of the bacterial strains were reisolated. the two facultative strains were more frequently reisolated than the anaerobic strains. apical periodontitis was registered in the periapical region of more than 96% of root canals with reisolated bacteria but in none of those without reisolated bacteria. endodontic treatment was carried out in two sessions with an interval of 14 d without interappointment dressings, and  the effect was evaluated bacteriologically before and after each treatment. the chemo-mechanical treatment reduced significantly the number of strains and bacterial cells. the facultative bacteria were more resistant to the treatment than the anaerobic bacteria. the five-strain combination had a higher survival rate than the four-strain combination.

TI  == the use of pcr for the identification and characterisation of bacteriocin genes from bacterial strains isolated from rumen or caecal contents of cattle and sheep.
AB  == pcr primers were designed to amplify the gene that encodes bovicin 255 from streptococcus gallolyticus lrc0255 and the bacteriocin genes from butyrivibrio fibrisolvens strains ar10 and or79a (bvid and bvi79a) in order to screen for their incidence in rumen and caecal b. fibrisolvens and streptococcus bovis-like  isolates from new zealand and north american ruminants. none of the b. fibrisolvens-like strains (n=34) isolated from new zealand or north america had the genes encoding for butyrivibriocins ar10 (bvid) or or79 (bvi79a). however, seven s. bovis isolates from new zealand ruminants and three from north american  animals had the bovicin 255 gene. sequence comparison of cloned bovicin 255 pcr products indicated a 92.9-95.7% similarity to that of the corresponding bovicin 255 gene sequence of s. gallolyticus. four of the new zealand bovicin 255 positive s. bovis isolates were from the caecal contents of the same sheep and had identical pfge profiles. two other s. bovis isolates sharing the same pfge profile were isolated from a separate animal from the same flock. pfge analysis of the north american strains indicated that all three were closely related as two of three had identical pfge profiles with the remaining isolate differing only by a single band position. the 16s rrna gene sequences of the 10 isolates were at least 99.8% identical to s. bovis. all 10 s. bovis isolates having the gene for bovicin 255 produced bacteriocin activity that inhibited the growth of peptostreptococcus anaerobius d1 in a deferred antagonism plating (dap) assay. certain s. bovis isolates obtained from ruminants have bacteriocin activity associated with a distinct bovicin 255 gene sequence but it appears that bacteriocin production by the rumen anaerobe b. fibrisolvens may be uncommon in strains isolated from cattle and sheep in new zealand.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of telithromycin.
AB  == background: telithromycin is one of the ketolides, characterised by a 3-keto group instead of l-cladinose and a c(11)-c(12) carbamate link by an alkyl chain to a pyridinum and imidazolium ring side chain. we evaluated in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of telithromycin against gynaecological pathogens. methods: in the vitro study, the antibacterial activity of telithromycin against  180 isolates (isolated in the year 2000) of streptococcus agalactiae (n = 33), enterococcus faecalis (n = 22), neisseria gonorrhoeae (n = 30), peptostreptococcus anaerobius (n = 20), finegoldia magna (n = 20), bacteroides fragilis (n = 25) and prevotella bivia (n = 30) was compared with that of erythromycin a, clarithromycin, azithromycin, ampicillin and levofloxacin. in the in vivo study, the efficacy of telithromycin was evaluated using experimental intra-abdominal abscesses in mice caused by b. fragilis (minimum inhibitory concentration of telithromycin 0.5 mg/l). results: in the in vitro study, telithromycin inhibited more than 50% of clinical isolates of s. agalactiae, e. faecalis, n. gonorrhoeae, p. anaerobius, f. magna, b. fragilis and p. bivia at concentrations of 0.016, 0.063, 0.063, 0.032, 0.032, 0.5 and 0.25 mg/l, respectively. telithromycin inhibited more than 90% of these clinical isolates at concentrations of 0.016, 4, 0.125, 0.063, 0.063, 4 and 1 mg/l, respectively. in the in vivo study, telithromycin inhibited abscess formation and significantly decreased viable cell counts in abscesses in comparison with the untreated group. conclusions: these in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities suggest that telithromycin could be a potential candidate for the treatment of bacterial infections complicated by chlamydial infection.

AB  == self-etching primers are now considered the new generation of dentin bonding systems that modify and incorporate the bacteria-containing smear layer into their bonding mechanism. the antibacterial effects of the self-etching primers clearfil se bond, mac bond, imperva fl bond, one-up bondf and prompt l-pop were evaluated using the bacteria streptococcus mutans atcc25175, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, peptostreptococcus prevotii, peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus catenaforme, lactobacillus jensenii, actinomyces odontolyticus, porphyromonas endodontalis, clostridium ramosum, prevotella oris, prevotella denticola and fusobacterium nucleatum, with a disk diffusion method. a single-bottle total-etch dentin adhesive (excite) was used for comparisons and chlorhexidine (0.2%) was used as the positive control. after  incubation, zones of inhibited bacterial growth were observed. one-up bondf, prompt l-pop and excite showed growth inhibition for all bacterial strains. the bonding agents of clearfil se bond, mac bond and imperva fl bond were unable to inhibit the growth of lactobacillus jensenii and actinomyces odontolyticus, while the primers of these systems produced inhibition halos to all tested microorganisms greater than that of chlorhexidine.

TI  == [yearly changes in antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates between 1996 and 2000--i. gram-positive bacteria].
AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2000 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, and  penicillins. fifteen species, 1,062 strains, of gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from january to december, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa; n = 127), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa; n = 123), staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 104), staphylococcus haemolyticus (n = 58), streptococcus pyogenes (n = 100), streptococcus agalactiae (n = 50), streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 125), enterococcus faecalis (n = 150), enterococcus faecium (n = 50), enterococcus avium (n = 50), and peptostreptococcus spp. (p. anaerobius, p. asaccharolyticus, p. magnus, p. micros, p. prevotii; n = 125). czop possessed stable antibacterial activities against all strains tested throughout 5 years. the mic90 of czop against mrsa and s. haemolyticus tended to decrease while against s. pneumoniae and peptostreptococcus spp., tended to increase year by year. however, the mic90 just changed a little and were consistent with the results from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. increases in the mic90 against s. pneumoniae were also observed with cefpirome (cpr), cefepime (cfpm), flomoxef (fmox), sulbactam/cefoperazone (sbt/cpz), and imipenem (ipm). increases in the mic90 against peptostreptococcus spp. were also  observed with ceftazidime (caz), cpr, cfpm, fmox, sbt/cpz, and ipm. the decreases in the sensitivities were not always considered to depend upon generation of resistant bacteria because the annual mic range of each antibacterial agent was almost generally wide every year and the annual sensitivity of each strain to the agents extremely varied. in conclusion, the annual antibacterial activities of czop against the gram-positive bacteria did not considerably change. it, therefore, was suggested that czop had maintained high antibacterial activity during 5 years of post-marketing.

TI  == in vitro antagonistic effect of lactobacillus on organisms associated with bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == objective: to assess antagonistic properties of lactobacillus strains isolated from the vaginas of healthy women as compared to the most common bacterial agents related to vaginosis. study design: antagonistic activity of different lactobacillus strains isolated from the vaginas of healthy women not treated for  infections with an antibiotic for the previous three months was screened using an agar slab method. the activity was tested against test organisms associated with  bacterial vaginosis and/or urinary tract infections: staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, gardnerella vaginalis, peptostreptococcus anaerobius and prevotella bivia. results: many of the 146 lactobacillus strains tested exerted apparent antagonistic activities against gram-positive aerobic cocci and gram-negative rods, such as s aureus and  e coli, and a marked number of lactobacillus strains inhibited facultative bacteria, such as gardnerella vaginalis and the anaerobes p anaerobius and p bivia. only a few lactobacilli were able to inhibit growth of e faecalis and s agalactiae. indicator bacteria growth inhibition probably relies upon several different complementary mechanisms. the specific indicator bacteria species determines which mechanism predominates. conclusion: lactobacillus strains taken  from normal vaginal flora demonstrated antagonistic activity against a variety of bacteria related to vaginal and urinary tract infections. the specific occurrence rates of active lactobacillus strains are different, and this difference is dependent on the indicator bacteria species.

TI  == endodontic pathogens stimulate monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and interleukin-8 in mononuclear cells.
AB  == microbial infection of the dental pulp leads to the recruitment of leukocytes and the formation of lesions of endodontic origin. the chemokines interleukin-8 (il-8) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (mcp-1) are relatively specific chemoattractants for neutrophils and monocytes, respectively. in the present studies, peripheral blood mononuclear cells were stimulated by streptococcus mutants, porphyromonas endodontalis, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius, which are associated with lesions of endodontic origin. each of these bacteria induced a dose-dependent increase in il-8 and mcp-1, determined by elisa. the levels induced are physiologically relevant. however, low doses of p. endodontalis were  less effective in inducing il-8 or mcp-1 expression, compared with s. mutants or  p. anaerobius. thus, these bacteria can induce significant levels of the chemokines il-8 and mcp-1, which could contribute to the recruitment of neutrophils or monocytes in vivo. the expression of these mediators may contribute to the development of endodontic infections, particularly with regard  to inflammatory leukocyte recruitment.

TI  == bacterial interference in the nasopharynx following antimicrobial therapy of acute otitis media.
AB  == the effect on the nasopharyngeal bacterial flora of therapy for 10 days with co-amoxiclav or cefprozil was studied in 50 children with acute otitis media. before therapy, potential pathogens (streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis) were isolated in 14 (56%) of those treated  with co-amoxiclav and 15 (60%) of those treated with cefprozil. following therapy, the reduction in the number of these pathogens was the same in the two groups. however, differences between the groups were noted in the recovery of organisms with interfering capability, namely alpha-haemolytic streptococci, peptostreptococcus anaerobius and prevotella melaninogenica. fifty interfering organisms were recovered from each group before therapy. after therapy with co-amoxiclav or cefprozil their number declined to 11 and 42, respectively (p< 0.001).

TI  == bacteriologic findings in tonsillitis and pericoronitis.
AB  == bacteriologic samples from 31 young men were cultured quantitatively for aerobes  and anaerobes; these samples included 31 specimens of tonsils (16 infected and 15 healthy), 16 specimens from pericoronal pockets of lower third molars (11 infected and 5 symptom-free), and 6 postoperative specimens from lower-third-molar extraction sockets. anaerobes were isolated more often from infected third molars than from infected tonsils (14.5 isolates vs. 8.4 isolates, respectively; p < .001). infected tonsil samples contained significantly more anaerobic species if an adjacent partly erupted lower third molar was present rather than absent (10.3 isolates vs. 6.9 isolates, respectively; p < .05). eubacterium aerofaciens, clostridium species, peptostreptococcus micros, and prevotella oris were frequently isolated. streptococcus salivarius was found more frequently in tonsillar specimens, whereas corynebacterium species, prevotella denticola, capnocytophaga species, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and lactobacillus species were more common in pericoronal pocket samples. thus, partial eruption of lower third molars increases the number of anaerobic bacterial species on tonsils and many species can be isolated simultaneously from both tonsils and lower third molars.

TI  == antibacterial effects of some root end filling materials.
AB  == in addition to having good sealing ability, root end filling materials should "ideally" have some antibacterial activity to prevent bacterial growth. this investigation compared the antibacterial effects of amalgam, zinc oxide-eugenol,  super eba and a mineral trioxide aggregate on nine facultative bacteria streptococcus fecalis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, lactobacillus species, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, bacillus subtilis, and escherichia coli b and seven strict anaerobic bacteria, prevotella (bacteroides) buccae, bacteroides fragilis, prevotella (bacteroides) intermedia, prevotella (bacteroides) melaninogenica, fusobacterium  necrophorum, fusobacterium nucleatum, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius. after growing these bacteria on solid media, freshly mixed and 24-h set test materials  were placed on the surface of these inoculated media and incubated in the appropriate atmosphere for 24 to 48 h at 37 degrees c. impregnated discs with the super eba liquid were used as positive controls. the antibacterial effects of each material were measured in millimeters and the data were analyzed using one-way and two-way analysis of variance and scheffe tests to determine the statistical differences between the antibacterial effects of the test materials.  impregnated discs with super eba liquid caused varying degrees of growth inhibition for both facultative and strict anaerobic bacteria. both types of amalgam had no antibacterial effect against any of the bacteria tested in this study. mineral trioxide aggregate had an antibacterial effect on some of the facultative bacteria and no effect on any of the strict anaerobic bacteria. zinc  oxide-eugenol and super eba pastes had some antibacterial effects on both types of bacteria tested.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == sinus disease has been assumed to exist in children with respiratory tract allergies. we consecutively evaluated 375 patients (245 male, 130 female) with childhood onset asthma, between 5 and 15 years of age (mean 7.8 years of age). abnormal waters radiographs were found in 205 patients (54.7%) which included mucosal wall thickening greater than 6 mm (67.3%), complete opacification (22.9%) and air-fluid levels (9.8%). the level of immunoglobulin (ig) e was found to be much higher in non-sinusitis asthmatic children than in asthmatic children with sinusitis (1207 iu/ml vs. 644 iu/ml). the igg, iga, igm and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (esr) values were not significantly different in the two groups. all patients were treated with antibiotics for 3 to 6 weeks. five patients required surgical intervention after antibiotic treatment had little success. streptococcus viridans was isolated from 4 patients following surgical aspirates and peptostreptococcus anaerobius was isolated in only one patient. in  conclusion, sinusitis in children may be an aggravating factor for chronic reactive lower airway disease. optimal treatment may decrease the need of asthmatic medication.

AB  == the antibacterial activity of a new parenteral cephalosporin, fk037 was assessed  against recent aerobic and anaerobic strains isolated from patients in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology during the period between january 1992 and june 1993. the mics of fk037 for 90% of the clinical isolates tested were 0.10 microgram/ml for escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae, 0.20 microgram/ml for streptococcus agalactiae, 0.39 microgram/ml for gardnerella vaginalis, 0.78 microgram/ml for staphylococcus epidermidis, peptostreptococcus anaerobius and mobiluncus spp., 1.56 micrograms/ml for peptostreptococcus magnus, 3.13 micrograms/ml for methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, 25 micrograms/ml for methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), bacteroides fragilis and prevotella disiens, 100 micrograms/ml for bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and prevotella bivia; and > 100 micrograms/ml for enterococcus faecalis. fk037 was superior in potency  to ceftazidime against all strains except e. faecalis, p. anaerobius and p. bivia. it was 4- to 16-fold more active than cefotaxime against aerobic gram-positive bacteria and p. disiens, and its activity was similar to that of cefotaxime against the other strains. fk037 had 4- to 16-fold stronger activity than flomoxef against mrsa, s. agalactiae and e. coli and a similar activity to flomoxef against the other strains except g. vaginalis and b. fragilis that were  4-fold more sensitive to flomoxef than to fk037.

AB  == an in-vitro study was undertaken to investigate the survival on bacteriological swabs of three potentially pathogenic organisms found in oro-facial infections, by using simulated clinical specimens incubated in the presence or absence of amies transport medium. standard inocula of pure cultures of streptococcus milleri, prevotella melaninogenica and peptostreptococcus anaerobius were soaked  on to swabs and plated out on to solid media at various intervals up to 3 days, enabling an estimate of their viability to be made following further incubation.  differential survival of the three test organisms was observed, with streptococcus milleri being generally the hardiest and peptostreptococcus anaerobius the least hardy, whilst survival was consistently enhanced by the presence of a transport medium. recovery of prevotella melaninogenica was improved by incubation for 5 days. we conclude that transport swabs should be used in preference to plain swabs whenever immediate laboratory culture cannot be assured, to avoid loss of anaerobic bacteria.

AB  == in eight experiments utilizing 28 animals each, germfree rats with and without ischemically or hemorrhagically strangulated closed loop intestinal segments were contaminated with either one of four common intestinal anaerobic bacteria, or a combination of two or three bacteria previously found to be innocuous in pure culture. the results showed that: a) in pure culture, bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides melaninogenicus, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius were innocuous; b) fusobacterium necrophorum alone was a very lethal organism that produced intense, confluent, intraperitoneal, fibrous adhesions after four to six days; and c) mixed inoculum of klebsiella pneumoniae, bacteroides fragilis, and/or streptococcus faecalis was found to be lethal for gnotobiotic rats with intestinal strangulation. it is concluded that fusobacterium necrophorum is so patent that it should be specifically treated with antibiotics when suspected or  known to be present in clinical specimens. this gnotobiotic animal model will be  useful to delineate the lethality of known combinations of intestinal bacteria.

TI  == a rapid diagnosis of anaerobic infection in the oro-maxillary region by gas-liquid chromatography.
AB  == the relationship between volatile fatty acids (vfas) in pus and infecting bacterial species was examined in order to establish a rapid identification system for anaerobic microorganisms in purulent inflammation in the oro-maxillary region. vfas were detected by the direct injection of pus into gas-liquid chromatography (glc). bacterial examination was carried out by anaerobic culture  using blood agar plates. the bacterial identification was carried out mainly according to the vpi manual. analysis of the direct vfa patterns of each sample resulted in 5 groups. the following bacterial species were the main isolates in each group: streptococcus intermedius in group a, peptostreptococcus micros in group b, fusobacterium nucleatum in group c, bacteroides gingivalis in group d, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius in group e. the profile of vfas produced in the pyg culture medium of the above isolated bacteria was compared with the direct vfa patterns. agreement ratios between direct and pyg vfa patterns were as follows: group a, 47.1%; groups b and c, 45.0%; group d, 87.5%; and group e, 62.9%. the acetic acid concentration was more than 14 x 10(-4) meq/ml in group b, the butyric acid concentration was more than 7 x 10(-4) meq/ml in group c, and the iso-caproic acid concentration was more than 14 x 10(-4) meq/ml in group e. in these cases, it was found that the agreement ratios between the direct and pyg fva pattern were high. in group d, irrespective of the concentration of iso-valeric acid detected, the agreement ratio was very high. the antibiotic susceptibility of the isolates was studied. efficiency rates of abpc, pipc, ccl,  cez, cmz, sbt/cpz, jm, cldm, mino and gm were relatively low and resistant rates  were high for the gram-negative rods.

TI  == quantitative bacteriology of a case of acute parotitis.
AB  == it is generally assumed that the microorganisms responsible for acute suppurative parotitis are facultative anaerobes, primarily staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus viridans. a quantitative microbiologic investigation of an aspirate of pus from the case we report revealed a microbial flora (5.1 x 10(6) cfu/ml) consisting entirely of strict anaerobes (fusobacterium nucleatum and peptostreptococcus anaerobius). the strain of f. nucleatum was sensitive to metronidazole but resistant to penicillin, amoxicillin, and erythromycin (minimum inhibitory concentration greater than 16 micrograms/ml). p. anaerobius was sensitive to the antibiotics tested. it is concluded that a high concentration of viable anaerobic bacteria may be present in acute suppurative parotitis and thus  pus obtained from cases of sialadenitis should be cultured with microbiologic methods capable of isolating strict anaerobes. additionally, antibiotic sensitivity should be determined routinely.

TI  == [studies on anaerobic infection in oro-maxillary region--rapid diagnosis by gas-liquid chromatography and antibiotic susceptibilities of anaerobic bacteria].
AB  == subject material for this study was pus collected from patients with purulent inflammation in the oro-maxillary region. direct gas-liquid chromatography (glc)  analysis was made, bacterial isolation and identification were carried out, and comparisons were made with results from glc analysis and anaerobic isolates in a  pyg medium. in addition, antibiotic susceptibilities of anaerobic bacteria were examined. results 1. anaerobic bacteria were isolated from 85 of 100 cases of obstructive abscesses. of the 85, 49 were cases of mixed infection involving both anaerobic and aerobic bacteria; and 64 cases were involved with more than 2 species of anaerobic bacteria. of the 184 strains of anaerobic isolates, 53 were  bacteroides sp. and 51 were peptostreptococcus sp. the 2 groups accounted for more than half of the isolates. 2. group a, in which no vfa was detected, accounted for 17 out of 100 cases. group b, in which acetic acid was detected, accounted for 20 cases; and group c, in which butyric acid was detected, accounted for 20 cases; and group d, in which iso-valeric acid was detected, accounted for 8 cases. direct glc analysis revealed iso-caproic and caproic acids in the 35 cases constituting group e. 3. whereas the percentage of anaerobic bacteria was 64.7% in group a and 60% in group b, significantly higher percentages were noted in group c (95%), group d (100%) and group e (100%). the following species were isolated as major member in the groups; group a--streptococcus intermedius, group b--peptostreptococcus micros, group c--fusobacterium nucleatum, group d--bacteroides gingivalis, and group e--peptostreptococcus anaerobius. 4. in all cases, the sum of vfa produced in the pyg medium by anaerobic isolates was classified into group a' to e'. ratios of agreement between vfa as revealed by direct glc and vfa as revealed by pyg.glc were as follows: group a-a'; 47.1%, group b-b' and c-c'; 45%, group d-d'; 87.5%,  and group e-e'; 62.9%. 5. in group b, no propionic acid was detected. the 2 cases in which acetic acid occurred in a concentration greater than 14 x 10(-4) meq/ml  belonged to group b'. in group c, no isobutyric acid was detected; and the 5 cases in which butyric acid was detected in a concentration of more than 7 x 10(-4) meq/ml belonged to group c'. varelic acid was not detected in group d; and 7 out of the 8 cases in which iso-valeric acid, irrespective of concentration, was detected belonged to group d'.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == preformed enzyme profiles of reference strains of gram-positive anaerobic cocci.
AB  == the preformed (constitutive) enzyme profiles of 30 type strains and reference strains of gram-positive anaerobic cocci were determined with two commercial systems, rapid ana and a prototype system from api. both systems identified peptostreptococcus anaerobius, ps. asaccharolyticus, ps. indolicus, ps. magnus and ps. micros accurately, except for one strain of ps. magnus misidentified as ps. micros by the rapid ana system. the indole-negative, butyrate-producing cocci (classified at present as ps. prevotii and ps. tetradius) produced several different, unique patterns with the prototype api system, but the results with rapid ana were often misleading. eight strains of hare group cocci produced previously described profiles. four strains of streptococci produced profiles easily distinguished from those of the gram-positive anaerobic cocci. we conclude that most gram-positive anaerobic cocci can be identified rapidly and reliably to the species level by their preformed enzyme profiles, providing that their underlying classification is sound. problems were encountered with the butyrate-producing cocci, which appear to be a more heterogeneous group of organisms than is currently acknowledged; further taxonomic studies on these organisms are required.

TI  == bactericidal effects of photoradiation therapy with hematoporphyrin derivative.
AB  == hematoporphyrin derivative (hpd) localizes selectively in malignant and rapidly metabolizing tissues and undergoes a cytotoxic reaction when exposed to light of  a specific wavelength. hpd has been studied extensively with regard to the diagnosis and treatment of tumors but not with regard to bactericidal activity. this investigation assessed the effect of light-activated hpd on various microorganisms, on human polymorphonuclear leukocytes, and on the interactions of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and bacteria. light-activated hpd was 99.9% bactericidal against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus faecalis, bacteroides fragilis, streptococcus m-g intermedius, streptococcus mutans, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, peptococcus magnus, and clostridium perfringens, but did not affect escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, or candida albicans. photoactivation of hpd rendered 98% of polymorphonuclear leukocytes inviable. combinations of light-activated hpd and polymorphonuclear leukocytes had a 4-log (99.99%) bactericidal effect on both intra- and extracellular s. aureus. the ability of hpd to localize in inflammatory tissues may have therapeutic applications in the  treatment of abscesses.

TI  == pathogenicity of anaerobic gram-positive cocci.
AB  == the pathogenicity of 20 strains of facultative or anaerobic gram-positive cocci (agpc) was investigated by injecting them alone or mixed with other flora into mice, utilizing the subcutaneous abscess model. abscesses induced by a mixture of two organisms were uniformly larger than those induced by single organisms. the relationships among seven agpc strains, eight aerobes, and two bacteroides spp. were determined by treating the infected animals with antibiotics and observing the effect of therapy directed against one or both organisms present in the abscess. a total of 70 different combinations were tested. as judged by their responses to antimicrobial therapy, facultative cocci or agpc were relatively more important than the other species in 6 combinations, equally important in 35  combinations, and less important in 29 combinations. the agpc most often found to be equal to or more important than the other bacteria were peptococcus magnus, streptococcus constellatus, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius. proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus were frequently found to be of more importance than the agpc.

TI  == circulating antibodies after experimental chronic infection in the root canal of  teeth in monkeys.
AB  == root canals of 49 teeth with necrotic pulp tissue in five monkeys were infected with streptococcus faecalis ss liquefaciens, actinomyces bovis, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and bacteroides oralis in various combinations. after 6 months the root canals and the periapical tissues were subjected to radiographic, bacteriologic, and histologic examinations. signs of periapical inflammation were radiographically registered in 41 teeth, most frequently in teeth inoculated with a mixed flora. in 11 out of 16 teeth infected separately with strep. faecalis ss liquefaciens, apical periodontitis was observed. sera from the monkeys prior to and after the experimental inoculation were analyzed by means of gel diffusion, hemagglutination (ha), and complement binding test for antibodies against different antigen preparations of the homologous bacterial strains used for the inoculation. detectable antibodies were seen with antigens of b. oralis in all five monkeys. agglutinating antibodies were demonstrated with lipopolysaccharide-antigen of b. oralis in titers between  1:40 and 1:320. a marked reduction of the antibody level against lipopolysaccharide (lps) antigen after mercaptoethanol treatment indicated that a main part of the antibodies registered was of igm-class. the study shows that certain antigens of bacterial origin from infected root canals, while affecting the periapical tissues, also stimulate the production of circulating antibodies.

TI  == microorganisms associated with abscesses of sheep and goats in the south of iran.
AB  == a total of 86 abscesses (45 and 41) abscesses of sheep and goats, respectively) were examined for their causal agents; 44 of these abscesses were located subcutaneously, and the remaining 42 were in lungs, livers, intestines, and udders. a total of 23 different types of microorganisms were isolated from 78 abscesses; bacteria were not detected in the remaining eight abscesses. microorganisms isolated were: species of the genera corynebacterium, staphylococcus, and streptococcus and pasteurella, escherichia coli, and other gram-negative rods. peptostreptococcus anaerobius and eubacterium tortuosum were  isolated in pure culture from one abscess each in goats. two to four different microorganisms were associated with 25 of the 86 abscesses. it was determined that 11 isolates of corynebacterium pyogenes, 2 isolates of pasteurella haemolytica, 1 of p multocida, and 1 of c pseudotuberculosis were lethal to mice. two of the c pyogenes isolates from subcutaneous spreading abscesses of goats were pathogenic for rabbits; these two isolates produced similar suppurative inflammation in goats experimentally, but did not cause death. as determined by experimental inoculation, goats were more susceptible than sheep to the two isolates. in nature, subcutaneous abscesses of goats associated with c pyogenes were of a more diffusive type which resulted in generalization of the infection and death of the animals. postmortem examination of ten goats dying of field infection showed the presence of larvae of the warble-fly przhevalskiana silenus  at the site of infection.

TI  == antigenic relationships and rapid identification of peptostreptococcus species.
AB  == antisera against whole cells of each peptostreptococcus species (p. anaerobius, p. micros, p. parvulus, and p. productus) were produced in rabbits. when these antisera were reacted against sonically disrupted cells and culture supernatant fluids in ouchterlony tests, lines of identity were obtained among the antigens from all the species and uninoculated culture medium. when the antisera were subsequently absorbed with the dehydrated culture medium used to grow the peptostreptococci, all cross-reactions in heterologous antigen-antibody combinations were eliminated, leaving only species-specific precipitin arcs. these absorbed antisera, specific for each peptostreptococcus species by ouchterlony tests, were used for rapid identification studies. staphylococcus aureus-bearing protein a was sensitized with each absorbed antiserum. these reagents produced specific coagglutination reactions with suspensions of each peptostreptococcus reference strain and with 16 clinical isolates. no cross-reactions occurred with the streptococcus intermedius, peptococcus magnus,  or peptococcus asaccharolyticus strains tested.

TI  == differentiation of peptococcus and peptostreptococcus by gas-liquid chromatography of cellular fatty acids and metabolic products.
AB  == gas-liquid chromatographic (glc) profiles of cellular fatty acids and metabolic products were useful in identifying strains of peptococcus saccharolyticus, peptococcus asaccharolyticus, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, peptostreptococcus micros, and streptococcus intermedius. the glc results supported the recent taxonomic decision to transfer aerotolerant peptostreptococcus species to the genus streptococcus. because inconsistencies in the results prevented our differentiating peptococcus prevotii. peptococcus magnus, and peptococcus variabilis by glc, additional strains will have to been examined. these glc techniques are amenable to routine use; however, for interlaboratory results to be meaningful, the classification and nomenclature of the anaerobic gram-positive cocci should be standardized.

TI  == extractable antigen shared by peptostreptococcus anaerobius strains.
AB  == extracts from several species of gram-positive cocci were prepared by a modification of the rantz-randall autoclave method and tested for reactions with  rabbit anti-peptostreptococcus anaerobius (atcc 27337 and vpi 5737) sera in a capillary precipitin test. antigen preparations from two reference strains of p.  anaerobius (atcc 27337 and vpi 5737) and six clinical isolates of p. anaerobius reacted with the p. anaerobius antisera. these extracts formed a line of identity by immunodiffusion and displayed at least one precipitin line by immunoelectrophoresis. absorption of the antisera with either the autoclaved extract or a 10% whole-cell suspension from each of the eight p. anaerobius strains removed the precipitin line(s) observed during immunodiffusion and immunoelectrophoresis. extracts prepared to other species of peptococcus, peptostreptococcus, and streptococcus did not react with the p. anaerobius antisera in a capillary precipitin test. in addition antisera to lancefield groups a to g did not react with the extracts from the eight p. anaerobius strains. preliminary chemical analysis of the extracts from the eight strains showed that they contained approximately 0.2 mg of carbohydrate per ml and 3.6 mg of protein per ml. the rabbit anti-p. anaerobius sera used in this study detected a common antigen(s) shared by strains of p. anaerobius, but did not react with autoclave extracts prepared from other species of gram-positive cocci. this extractable antigen could be used in a capillary precipitin test to rapidly identify p. anaerobius strains isolated in the clinical microbiology laboratory.

AB  == the capacity of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria to survive on cotton swabs placed  into a dry gassed-out co2-filled tube (dgt), dry sterile aerobic tube (dat), and  a tube containing a modified stuarts' transport medium (mst), was assessed. pseudomonas aeruginosa increased in numbers by 2 and 3 logs when stored in mst and dat, respectively. the viability of p. aeruginosa, although retarded when compared to msa and dat, was not adversely affected by the co2 environment in the dgt. the mst maintained relatively constant numbers of streptococcus pyogenes during the 48-h storage period. the dat and the dgt were unable to maintain the viability of s. pyogenes. staphylococcus aureus, when stored in a dgt, dat, or mst, was maintained in relatively constant numbers throughout the entire storage  period. of the four anaerobic bacteria evaluated (bacteroides fragilis ssp. thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides melaninogenicus ssp. asaccharolyticus, fusobacterium nucleatum, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius), only b. fragilis ssp. thetaiotamicron survived the 48-h storage period in the dgt. under these test conditions the dgt did not adequately maintain the viability of the majority of anaerobic bacteria tested (when held on cotton swabs). however, the mst did maintain the viability of all species tested for at least the first 2 h of storage.
