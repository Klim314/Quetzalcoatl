TI  == are airways structural abnormalities more frequent in children with recurrent lower respiratory tract infections?
AB  == we report bronchoscopic changes observed in children with recurrent lower airways infections (rlai) and findings in control children undergoing bronchoscopy for causes other than rlai. patients and methods: retrospective case-control cohorts  study. the clinical records of children who had fiberoptic bronchoscopy (fb) for  a history of rlai without any known underlying disorder between 2007 and 2013 and of control children who required fb for other causes were reviewed. clinical features, bronchospic findings and bronchoalveolar lavage (bal) results were assessed. results: cases were 62 (32 female) children aged 5 years (1-12) and controls 29 children aged 4.5 years (0.5-14). airway malacia was observed in 32 (52%) vs. 4 (13%) (p = 0.001), profuse respiratory secretions in 34(55%) vs. 6 (20%) (p = 0.007). endobronchial obstruction: 4 (6.4%) and tracheobronchomegaly were observed only in cases. in cases with profuse respiratory secretions there was a higher prevalence of airways malacia: 64.7% vs. 35.7% (p = 0.04) and of positive bal cultures: 45.5% vs. 13.3% (p = 0.04). isolated organisms in cases were non-typable haemophilus influenzae and streptococcus pneumoniae most frequently. pneumocystiis jirovecii, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus mitis were isolated in controls. conclusions: half of the children with rlai had  tracheo and/or bronchomalacia, their frequency being in keeping with previous reports and far higher than that observed in controls. it was associated with profuse respiratory secretions and with a higher frequency of positive bal cultures mostly for non typable h. influenzae and s. pneumoniae which were not isolated in controls.

TI  == cluster of bacteria associated with peri-implantitis.
AB  == background: information on the microbiota in peri-implantitis is limited. we hypothesized that neither gender nor a history of periodontitis/smoking or the microbiota at implants differ by implant status. materials and methods: baseline  microbiological samples collected at one implant in each of 166 participants with peri-implantitis and from 47 individuals with a healthy implant were collected and analyzed by dna-dna checkerboard hybridization (78 species). clinical and radiographic data defined implant status. results: nineteen bacterial species were found at higher counts from implants with peri-implantitis including aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter gracilis, campylobacter rectus, campylobacter showae, helicobacter pylori, haemophilus influenzae, porphyromonas gingivalis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus anaerobius, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus mitis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, and treponema socranskii (p < .001). receiver operating characteristic curve analysis identified t. forsythia, p. gingivalis, t. socranskii, staph. aureus, staph. anaerobius, strep. intermedius, and strep. mitis in peri-implantitis comprising 30% of the total microbiota. when adjusted for gender (not significant [ns]), smoking status (ns), older age (p = .003), periodontitis  history (p < .01), and t. forsythia (likelihood ratio 3.6, 95% confidence interval 1.4, 9.1, p = .007) were associated with peri-implantitis. conclusion: a cluster of bacteria including t. forsythia and staph. aureus are associated with  peri-implantitis.

TI  == microbiological etiology and susceptibility of bacterial conjunctivitis isolates  from clinical trials with ophthalmic, twice-daily besifloxacin.
AB  == introduction: bacterial conjunctivitis is a contagious infection of the surface of the eye usually treated empirically with topical antibiotics. since the etiologic agent is rarely identified, it is important to monitor which bacteria cause conjunctivitis and determine their antibacterial resistance profiles. methods: a total of 496 bacterial samples were isolated during a randomized, double-masked, vehicle-controlled, parallel-group study conducted in the united states with besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension 0.6% dosed twice daily. species were determined by standard biochemical and/or molecular identification methods.  minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined according to clinical and laboratory standards institute standards. results: the most prevalent species was haemophilus influenzae, followed by staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, the streptococcus mitis group, and streptococcus pneumoniae. one species  identified in this study, which was not previously noted as a common cause of bacterial conjunctivitis, was dolosigranulum pigrum. ampicillin resistance was common among h. influenzae isolates, while macrolide resistance was high among s. pneumoniae, s. epidermidis, and s. aureus. the latter two species also included a number of isolates resistant to methicillin and ciprofloxacin. conclusion: antibiotic resistance among isolates remains a concern and the appearance of an emerging ocular pathogen, d. pigrum, suggests the need for continued observation. the topical ophthalmic fluoroquinolones continue to provide a good balance of low to moderate (i.e., manageable) levels of resistance plus broad-spectrum coverage  for empiric treatment of ocular infections.

TI  == [etiology and epidemic characteristics of hospital acquired pneumonia in children].
AB  == objective: to investigate the etiology and epidemic characteristics of hospital acquired pneumonia (hap) in children. method: a retrospective hospital infection  study was performed in 52,639 children admitted to our hospital from january 2005 to december 2008. result: six hundred and ninety eight patients were diagnosed as hap. the incidence of hap was 1.33%, among which, 108 (15.47%) cases were early-onset hap and 590 (84.53%) were late-onset hap. the hap patients aged 3 days to 15 years (503 male and 195 female). the proportion of patients younger than 1 year was 51.4%. main underlying diseases were cytomegalovirus hepatitis, congenital heart disease, malignant tumor, granulocytopenia or agranulocytosis, prematurity and low birth weight. there was significant difference in the incidences among different departments with the highest one seen in icu, followed by departments of infectious diseases, hematology and digestive diseases. two hundred and thirty one stains of pathogens were identified from sputum of 355 cases. one hundred and fifty six (67.5%) strains were gram-negative bacteria, which accounted for the highest proportion. there were 30 (13.0%) gram-positive bacterial strains, and 29 (12.6%) respiratory tract virus strains, and 15 (6.5%)  fungal strains, and 1 (0.4%) mycoplasma strain. the predominant bacterial pathogens were klebsiella pneumoniae, followed by stenotrophomonas maltophilia, burkholderia cepacia, escherichia coli and acinetobacter baumannii. the isolation rates of klebsiella pneumoniae and escherichia coli with positive extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) were 94.8% and 85.7%, respectively. those two bacteria were universally resistant to the third and forth generations  cephalosporins. the main pathogens of early-onset hap were respiratory syncytial  virus (rsv), streptococcus mitis, streptococcus pneumonia, haemophilus influenzae and klebsiella pneumoniae, while the main pathogens of late-onset hap were esbls-positive klebsiella pneumonia, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, burkholderia cepacia, escherichia coli and acinetobacter baumannii. conclusion: hap in children is most common in children younger than 1 year and with underlying diseases. the main pathogens are gram-negative bacteria. rsv was an important pathogen of hap. the pathogens of early-onset hap are different from those of late-onset hap. these results may be of some help in prevention and control of hap in children and in guiding for rational application of antibiotics, especially the empirical antibiotic choice.

TI  == the impact of the stone age diet on gingival conditions in the absence of oral hygiene.
AB  == background: the objective of this study was to assess the oral microbiota and clinical data in subjects without access to traditional oral hygiene methods and  who ate a diet available in the stone age. methods: ten subjects living in an environment replicating the stone age for 4 weeks were enrolled in this study. bleeding on probing (bop), gingival and plaque indices, and probing depth (pd) were assessed at baseline and at 4 weeks. microbiologic samples were collected at the mesio-buccal subgingival aspects of all teeth and from the dorsum of the tongue and were processed by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization methods. results: no subject had periodontitis. mean bop decreased from 34.8% to 12.6% (p <0.001).  mean gingival index scores changed from 0.38 to 0.43 (not statistically significant) and mean plaque scores increased from 0.68 to 1.47 (p <0.001). pd at sites of subgingival sampling decreased (mean difference: 0.2 mm; p <0.001). at week 4, the total bacterial count was higher (p <0.001) for 24 of 74 species, including bacteroides ureolyticus, eikenella corrodens, lactobacillus acidophilus, capnocytophaga ochracea, escherichia coli, fusobacterium nucleatum naviforme, haemophilus influenzae, helicobacter pylori, porphyromonas endodontalis, staphylococcus aureus (two strains), streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus anginosis, and streptococcus mitis. bacterial counts from tongue samples were higher at baseline (p <0.001) for 20 species, including tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans; serotype a), and streptococcus  spp. conclusions: the experimental gingivitis protocol is not applicable if the diet (e.g., stone age) does not include refined sugars. although plaque levels increased, bop and pd decreased. subgingival bacterial counts increased for several species not linked to periodontitis, whereas tongue bacterial samples decreased during the study period.

TI  == sites in the ch3 domain of human iga1 that influence sensitivity to bacterial iga1 proteases.
AB  == the influence of regions, other than the hinge, on the susceptibility of human iga1 to cleavage by diverse bacterial iga1 proteases, was examined using iga1 mutants bearing amino acid deletions, substitutions, and domain swaps. iga1 lacking the tailpiece retained its susceptibility to cleavage by all of the iga1  proteases. the domain swap molecule alpha1alpha2gamma3, in which the ch3 domain of iga1 was exchanged for that of human igg1, was resistant to cleavage with the  type 1 and 2 serine iga1 proteases of neisseria meningitidis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and haemophilus influenzae, but remained sensitive to cleavage with  the metallo-iga1 proteases of streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguis, and streptococcus mitis. substitution of the iga1 calpha3  domain motif pro440 -phe443 into the corresponding position in the cgamma3 domain of alpha1alpha2gamma3 resulted now in sensitivity to the type 2 iga1 protease of  n. meningitidis, indicating the possible requirement of these amino acids for sensitivity to this protease. for the h. influenzae type 2 protease, resistance of an iga1 mutant in which the ch3 domain residues 399-409 were exchanged with those from igg1, but sensitivity of mutant hubovalpha3 in which the calpha3 domain of bovine iga replaces that of human iga1, suggests that ch3 domain residues glu403, gln406, and thr409 influence sensitivity to this enzyme. hence,  unlike the situation with the metallo-iga1 proteases of streptococcus spp., the sensitivity of human iga1 to cleavage with the serine iga1 proteases of neisseria and haemophilus involves their binding to different sites specifically in the ch3 domain.

TI  == the influences of hinge length and composition on the susceptibility of human iga to cleavage by diverse bacterial iga1 proteases.
AB  == the influences of iga hinge length and composition on its susceptibility to cleavage by bacterial iga1 proteases were examined using a panel of iga hinge mutants. the iga1 proteases of streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus sanguis strains sk4 and sk49, neisseria meningitidis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and haemophilus influenzae cleaved iga2-iga1 half hinge, an ab featuring half of the  iga1 hinge incorporated into the equivalent site in iga1 protease-resistant iga2, whereas those of streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, and s. sanguis strain sk1 did not. hinge length reduction by removal of two of the four c-terminal proline residues rendered iga2-iga1 half hinge resistant to all streptococcal iga1 metalloproteinases but it remained sensitive to cleavage by the serine-type  iga1 proteases of neisseria and haemophilus spp. the four c-terminal proline residues could be substituted by alanine residues or transferred to the n-terminal extremity of the hinge without affect on the susceptibility of the ab  to cleavage by serine-type iga1 proteases. however, their removal rendered the ab resistant to cleavage by all the iga1 proteases. we conclude that the serine-type iga1 proteases of neisseria and haemophilus require the fab and fc regions to be  separated by at least ten (or in the case of n. gonorrhoeae type i protease, nine) amino acids between val(222) and cys(241) (iga1 numbering) for efficient access and cleavage. by contrast, the streptococcal iga1 metalloproteinases require 12 or more appropriate amino acids between the fab and fc to maintain a minimum critical distance between the scissile bond and the start of the fc.

TI  == effect of mutations in the human immunoglobulin a1 (iga1) hinge on its susceptibility to cleavage by diverse bacterial iga1 proteases.
AB  == components of the human immunoglobulin a1 (iga1) hinge governing sensitivity to cleavage by bacterial iga1 proteases were investigated. recombinant antibodies with distinct hinge mutations were constructed from a hybrid comprised of human iga2 bearing half of the human iga1 hinge region. this hybrid antibody and all the mutant antibodies derived from it were resistant to cleavage by the iga1 proteases from streptococcus oralis and streptococcus mitis biovar 1 strains but  were cleaved to various degrees by those of streptococcus pneumoniae, some streptococcus sanguis strains, and the type 1 and 2 iga1 proteases of haemophilus influenzae, neisseria meningitidis, and neisseria gonorrhoeae. remarkably, those  proteases that cleave a pro-ser peptide bond in the wild-type iga1 hinge were able to cleave mutant antibodies lacking a pro-ser peptide bond in the hinge, and those that cleave a pro-thr peptide bond in the wild-type iga1 hinge were able to cleave mutant antibodies devoid of a pro-thr peptide bond in the hinge. thus, the enzymes can cleave alternatives to their preferred postproline peptide bond when  such a bond is unavailable. peptide sequence analysis of a representative antibody digestion product confirmed this conclusion. the presence of a cleavable peptide bond near the ch2 end of the hinge appeared to result in greater cleavage than if the scissile bond was at the ch1 end of the hinge. proline-to-serine substitution at residue 230 in a hinge containing potentially cleavable pro-ser and pro-thr peptide bonds increased the resistance of the antibody to cleavage by many iga1 proteases.

TI  == design of a multiplex pcr for streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, mycoplasma pneumoniae and chlamydophila pneumoniae to be used on sputum samples.
AB  == a multiplex pcr (mpcr) was developed for simultaneous detection of specific genes for streptococcus pneumoniae (lyta), mycoplasma pneumoniae (p1), chlamydophila pneumoniae (ompa), and haemophilus influenzae (16s rrna, with verification pcr for p6). when the protocol was tested on 257 bacterial strains belonging to 37 different species, no false negatives and only one false positive were noted. one streptococcus mitis out of thirty was positive for lyta. in a pilot application study of 81 sputum samples from different patients with suspected lower respiratory tract infection (lrti), mpcr identified s. pneumoniae in 25 samples,  h. influenzae in 29, m. pneumoniae in 3, and c. pneumoniae in 1. all samples culture positive for s. pneumoniae (n=15) and h. influenzae (n=15) were mpcr positive for the same bacteria. in a pilot control study with nasopharyngeal swabs and aspirates from 10 healthy adults, both culture and mpcr were negative.  no pcr inhibition was found in any of the mpcr-negative sputum or nasopharyngeal  samples. whether all samples identified as positive by mpcr are truly positive in an aetiological perspective regarding lrti remains to be evaluated in a well-defined patient material. in conclusion, the mpcr appears to be a promising  tool in the aetiological diagnostics of lrti.

TI  == acute epiglottitis in adults: the royal melbourne hospital experience.
AB  == background: to examine the common presentations and management of acute epiglottitis in adults. method: retrospective clinical study of 17 consecutive adult patients who presented to the royal melbourne hospital between january 1988 and december 2000 was undertaken. results: the mean patient age was 47 years (range 20-87 years) and the male-to-female ratio was 1.8 : 1.0. peak incidence occurred in september during early spring. all patients presented with sore throat and dysphagia; however, respiratory distress was only noted in 65%. the most common signs were temperature and tachycardia. four patients (23%) required  endotracheal intubation, which was performed electively in three and as an emergency in one. three of 14 blood cultures were positive, two yielded haemophilus influenzae type b and one yielded streptococcus mitis. one of the four throat cultures was positive for haemophilus influenzae type b. twelve patients underwent awake flexible laryngoscopy under topical anaesthetic as part  of their initial assessment, and there were no complications associated with this procedure. there was no mortality. conclusions: the diagnosis of acute epiglottitis in the adult population is difficult as respiratory distress may be  absent. patients who have a significant sore throat with no obvious aetiology should have direct visualization of their larynx by flexible laryngoscopy. lateral x-ray of neck is of limited value. once diagnosed, these patients should  be hospitalized and monitored as airway obstruction may develop rapidly.

TI  == immunoglobulins in nasal secretions of healthy humans: structural integrity of secretory immunoglobulin a1 (iga1) and occurrence of neutralizing antibodies to iga1 proteases of nasal bacteria.
AB  == certain bacteria, including overt pathogens as well as commensals, produce immunoglobulin a1 (iga1) proteases. by cleaving iga1, including secretory iga1, in the hinge region, these enzymes may interfere with the barrier functions of mucosal iga antibodies, as indicated by experiments in vitro. previous studies have suggested that cleavage of iga1 in nasal secretions may be associated with the development and perpetuation of atopic disease. to clarify the potential effect of iga1 protease-producing bacteria in the nasal cavity, we have analyzed  immunoglobulin isotypes in nasal secretions of 11 healthy humans, with a focus on iga, and at the same time have characterized and quantified iga1 protease-producing bacteria in the nasal flora of the subjects. samples in the form of nasal wash were collected by using a washing liquid that contained lithium as an internal reference. dilution factors and, subsequently, concentrations in undiluted secretions could thereby be calculated. iga, mainly in the secretory form, was found by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to be the dominant isotype in all subjects, and the vast majority of iga (median, 91%) was  of the a1 subclass, corroborating results of previous analyses at the level of immunoglobulin-producing cells. levels of serum-type immunoglobulins were low, except for four subjects in whom levels of igg corresponded to 20 to 66% of total iga. cumulative levels of iga, igg, and igm in undiluted secretions ranged from 260 to 2,494 (median, 777) microg ml(-1). iga1 protease-producing bacteria (haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, or streptococcus mitis biovar  1) were isolated from the nasal cavities of seven subjects at 2.1 x 10(3) to 7.2  x 10(6) cfu per ml of undiluted secretion, corresponding to 0.2 to 99.6% of the flora. nevertheless, alpha-chain fragments characteristic of iga1 protease activity were not detected in secretions from any subject by immunoblotting. neutralizing antibodies to iga1 proteases of autologous isolates were detected in secretions from five of the seven subjects but not in those from two subjects harboring iga1 protease-producing s. mitis biovar 1. alpha-chain fragments different from fc(alpha) and fd(alpha) were detected in some samples, possibly reflecting nonspecific proteolytic activity of microbial or host origin. these results add to previous evidence for a role of secretory immunity in the defense  of the nasal mucosa but do not help identify conditions under which bacterial iga1 proteases may interfere with this defense.

TI  == detection of the phosphorylcholine epitope in streptococci, haemophilus and pathogenic neisseriae by immunoblotting.
AB  == the phosphorylcholine (pc) determinant in streptococcus pneumoniae is known to be linked to the cell wall polysaccharides (c-ps) and to the lipoteichoic acid (lta) (forssman antigen) of the plasma membrane. western blotting with two pc specific  murine monoclonal antibodies (mabs) designated 145,f-2 (igm) and 147,a-1 (iga) showed a similar ladder-like pattern for all examined strains of s. pneumoniae and streptococcus mitis. purified antigens run in parallel indicated that this ladder pattern is due to the pc of lta. unlike other techniques, western blotting thus enables the identification of only one of the streptococcal structures carrying the pc epitope. gram-negative organisms were also examined, and six of 11 haemophilus influenzae strains reacted with the mabs. for this species, unlike the streptococci, only one fast moving band was detected. analyses by thin-layer  chromatography (tlc) detected the pc epitope in lipopolysaccharide (lps) fraction from h. influenzae. some strains of the neisseriaceae family were also positive by western blotting, but tlc and immunostaining did not detect the pc determinant in lps.

AB  == known numbers (cfu/ml) of middle ear pathogens (s. pneumoniae, h. influenzae, m.  catarrhalis, s. aureus and beta-haemolytic streptococci group a) and non-pathogens (alpha-haemolytic s. mitis) were inoculated into one end of a micropipet containing a 35 mm long pillar of culture-negative middle ear effusion. the micropipets with the effusion/bacterial suspension were incubated at 37 degrees c and kept at various inclinations to the horizontal plane (15 degrees, 30 degrees and -75 degrees). all s. aureus, m. catarrhalis, alpha- and beta-haemolytic streptococci isolates examined survived in this medium for 18 h.  the majority of alpha- and beta-haemolytic streptococci isolates penetrated the mee, irrespective of the inclination of the micropipet, whereas the number of s.  pneumoniae (p<0.01) and h. influenzae (p = ns) isolates penetrating the substrate increased when the micropipets were inclined at -75 degrees to the horizontal. none of the s. aureus and m. catarrhalis isolates penetrated the mee pillar during the incubation. the present in vitro study demonstrated that mee possesses an antibacterial property and is able to selectively hinder bacterial penetration.

TI  == increased proportions of bacteria capable of cleaving iga1 in the pharynx of infants with atopic disease.
AB  == based on the observation that children with a history of atopic disease show significantly increased levels of cleaved secretory iga in nasopharyngeal secretions, we have previously formulated the hypothesis that bacteria-induced local deficiencies of the immune barrier of the upper respiratory tract may be a  contributing factor in the development and perpetuation of atopic diseases. to evaluate this hypothesis, 25 infants were subjected to clinical, bacteriologic, and immunologic examination at the age of 18 mo, 30 mo, and 5 y. the 11 infants,  who showed clinical and immunologic evidence of atopic disease at the age of 18 mo, harbored significantly higher proportions of iga1 protease-producing bacteria (median, 36%; range, 14-64%) than the 14 healthy infants (median, 5%; range, 0.4-14%). no statistically significant differences were observed at the two subsequent examinations, but healthy children showed a statistically significant  increase in proportions of iga1 protease-producing bacteria in the pharynx with increasing age. iga1 protease-producing bacteria detected included streptococcus  mitis biovar 1, haemophilus influenzae, haemophilus parahaemolyticus, streptococcus pneumoniae, and neisseria meningitidis, of which the first mentioned species was mainly responsible for the difference observed at the 18-mo examination. percentage proportions of iga1 protease-producing bacteria were significantly related to passive smoking which may stimulate the premature and more pronounced pharyngeal colonization of the atopic infants with the iga1 protease-producing variant of s. mitis biovar 1. the results of the study support the hypothesis that iga1 protease-producing bacteria colonizing the upper respiratory tract jeopardize the local immune barrier and, thereby, may facilitate the penetration of potential allergens resulting in atopic disease.

TI  == microorganisms on toothbrushes at day-care centers.
AB  == the microflora on 44 toothbrushes at 4 day-care centers in the city of goteborg have been investigated as a presumptive risk factor for transmission of microorganisms by children. non-supervised toothbrushing without the use of toothpaste was performed at the day-care centers twice a day. streptococci, predominantly s. salivarius, s. sanguis, and s. mitis, were the most frequently recorded group of microorganisms and generally constituted the greatest part of the flora (on average, 50%). beta-hemolytic streptococci were not found in any sample. haemophilus species were noted in 82% of the samples. h. parainfluenzae being the most frequent, and h. influenzae being identified in only one sample. anaerobes constituted on average a third of the microflora. staphylococci were identified in 86% of the samples, s. epidermidis dominating. fungi including molds were found in 50% of the samples, and from one day-care center large numbers of enteric organisms were identified. thus this study shows that unsupervised toothbrushing at day-care centers can be questioned, more from a general hygienic point of view than from the risk of transmitting serious pathogens.

TI  == the bacterial etiology of conjunctivitis in early infancy. eye prophylaxis study  group.
AB  == the authors conducted this study to determine the etiologic agents of conjunctivitis in early infancy. from 1985 to 1990, 630 infants enrolled in a randomized, controlled, double-masked study of eye prophylaxis were observed for  60 days after delivery for signs of conjunctivitis. the following isolates were categorized as pathogens: haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria cinerea, klebsiella pneumoniae, and chlamydia trachomatis. using conditional logistic regression for analysis of 97 infant pairs, the authors identified isolates categorized as pathogens almost exclusively among cases (odds ratio (or) = 18.0, 95% confidence interval (ci) 2.3-128). among the microorganisms which have not usually been regarded as pathogens in the etiology  of infant conjunctivitis, streptococcus mitis was the only microorganism associated with an increased risk of conjunctivitis (or = 5.3, 95% ci 1.8-15.0).  the findings concerning the species of bacteria most often associated with conjunctivitis, as well as the finding that method of delivery is unimportant, suggest that bacteria were transmitted to the infants' eyes after birth and not from the birth canal.

TI  == meningitis--a complication of spinal anesthesia.
AB  == during a five-year period, 17 of 1429 patients admitted with meningitis had had recent spinal anesthesia in cairo, egypt. ten of the 17 had positive cerebrospinal fluid cultures: 8 were pseudomonas aeruginosa, 1 was staphylococcus aureus, and 1 was streptococcus mitis. these organisms were not cultured from patients who had not had spinal anesthesia. two patients with negative cultures had lumbar spine x-ray changes consistent with tuberculosis. antibiotic therapy was based upon the sensitivity of cultured organisms. four of the 17 patients died. these data strongly suggest that meningitis in patients with recent spinal  anesthesia is commonly due to unusual or nosocomial organisms. aggressive, meticulous bacteriologic evaluation of these patients is essential.

TI  == hydrogen peroxide-mediated antagonism against serratia marcescens by streptococcus mitis.
AB  == the alpha-hemolytic streptococcus mitis strain no. 17-1, isolated from the oral cavity of an healthy female adult, antagonized the growth of all 24 test strains  of serratia marcescens examined; furthermore, this strain inhibited the growth of various strains of staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, s. agalactiae, s. pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, listeria monocytogenes, and corynebacterium diphtheriae. however, strans of escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa proved refractory. the mechanism of microbial antagonism was due to production and release of hydrogen peroxide under aerobic atmospheric conditions, which was neutralized through incorporation of bovine liver catalase into the solid assay medium.
