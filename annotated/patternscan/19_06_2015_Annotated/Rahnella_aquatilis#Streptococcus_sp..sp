TI  == culture-independent identification of pathogenic bacteria and polymicrobial infections in the genitourinary tract of renal transplant recipients.
AB  == renal transplant recipients are predisposed to urinary tract infections caused by both common uropathogens and opportunistic bacteria resulting frequently in significant polymicrobial infections. in this study, a culture-independent 16s rrna-based approach was established to identify unusual, fastidious, or anaerobic bacteria and to investigate bacterial diversity in urinary tract specimens. similarly sized amplicons encompassing the v6 to v8 region of the 16s rrna were analyzed with denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (dhplc) (wave system). artificial mixtures of single amplicons from commonly encountered uropathogenic bacteria produced distinct peak profiles whose identities were confirmed by sequencing individually collected peak products. we evaluated the application of the method on 109 urinary tract specimens from renal transplant recipients; 100% correlation was found for culture-positive specimens, and dhplc  generated peak profiles. however, for culture-negative specimens, dhplc facilitated the detection of novel peak profiles. dna sequencing of these individual peaks was used to identify the bacteria involved. thus, in pcr-positive but culture-negative samples the method allowed detection of previously known uropathogens such as corynebacterium urealyticum and gardnerella vaginalis, but also unusual agents including anaerococcus lactolyticus, bacteroides vulgatus, dialister invisus, fusobacterium nucleatum, lactobacillus iners, leptotrichia amnionii, prevotella buccalis, prevotella ruminicola, rahnella aquatilis, and streptococcus intermedius were detected as single pathogens or as constituents of polymicrobial infections. the method described is reproducible and rapidly and enables both dhplc-based profiling and sequence-based investigation of microbial communities and polymicrobial infections. a detailed understanding of infections found in recipients of renal transplants will guide antibiotic therapy regimens and provide new perspectives for decreasing the risk of graft rejection.

TI  == [study on bacteremia due to community-acquired infection in infants and children  without underlying diseases].
AB  == between july 1988 and june 1998, 22 pediatric patients without underlying diseases were diagnosed as bacteremia caused by community-acquired infection in asahikawa kosei hospital. the age range of the patients was from 7 days to 4 years. their diseases were meningitis in 6, urinary tract infection in 6, respiratory tract infection in 4, skin infection in 2, and unknown origin in 4. the causative organisms were escherichia coli in 7, haemophilus influenzae in 4,  streptococcus pneumoniae in 4, staphylococcus aureus in 2, streptococcus pyogenes in 1, streptococcus agalactiae in 1, listeria monocytogenes in 1, moraxella catarrhalis in 1, and rahnella aquatilis in 1. though 21 patients recovered with  antimicrobial treatment, only one patient with h. influenzae meningitis had lateral deafness and paresis in the lower limbs as sequelae.
