TI  == altered bacterial profiles in saliva from adults with caries lesions: a case-cohort study.
AB  == the aim of this study was to learn whether presence of caries in an adult population was associated with a salivary bacterial profile different from that of individuals without untreated caries. stimulated saliva samples from 621 participants of the danish health examination survey were analyzed using the human oral microbe identification microarray technology. samples from 174 individuals with dental caries and 447 from a control cohort were compared using  frequency and levels of identified bacterial taxa/clusters as endpoints. differences at taxon/cluster level were analyzed using mann-whitney's test with benjamini-hochberg correction for multiple comparisons. principal component analysis was used to visualize bacterial community profiles. a reduced bacterial  diversity was observed in samples from subjects with dental caries. five bacterial taxa (veillonella parvula, veillonella atypica, megasphaera micronuciformis, fusobacterium periodontium and achromobacter xylosoxidans) and one bacterial cluster (leptotrichia sp. clones c3mkm102 and gt018_ot417/462) were less frequently found in the caries group (adjusted p value <0.01) while two bacterial taxa (solobacterium moorei and streptococcus salivarius) and three bacterial clusters (streptococcus parasanguinis i and ii and sp. clone be024_ot057/411/721, streptococcus parasanguinis i and ii and sinensis_ot411/721/767, streptococcus salivarius and sp. clone fo042_ot067/755) were present at significantly higher levels (adjusted p value <0.01). the principal component analysis displayed a marked difference in the bacterial community profiles between groups. presence of manifest caries was associated with a reduced diversity and an altered salivary bacterial community profile. our data support recent theories that ecological stress-induced changes of commensal  microbial communities are involved in the shift from oral health to tooth decay.

TI  == identification of veillonella tobetsuensis in tongue biofilm by using a species-specific primer pair.
AB  == veillonella atypica, veillonella denticariosi, veillonella dispar, veillonella parvula, and veillonella rogosae have been reported to be isolated from human oral cavities. the recently detected veillonellatobetsuensis in human tongue biofilms was proposed as a novel veillonella sp. in this study, to determine the  distribution and frequency of v. tobetsuensis, we established a method for the detection and identification of v. tobetsuensis by using polymerase chain reaction (pcr) using a species-specific primer pair. the primer pair for v. tobetsuensis was designed on the basis of the nucleotide sequence of the 70-kda heat shock protein (dnak) gene of v. tobetsuensis jcm 17976(t) (=atcc baa-2400(t)). the primer pair generated a specific pcr product for v. tobetsuensis but not for other oral veillonella spp. with the pcr procedure using the primer pair, we could detect less than 10 ng of genomic dna extracted from v. tobetsuensis. thus, the pcr method using this primer pair is suitable for the specific detection and identification of v. tobetsuensis. the distribution and frequency of v. tobetsuensis were investigated by pcr using this species-specific primer pair. v. tobetsuensis was detected in 5 of 27 subjects. v. tobetsuensis was recovered from 19% (5/27) of subjects with other veillonella species. and, prevalence of v. tobetsuensis ranged from 7.6% to 20.0% in these subjects. v. tobetsuensis is likely to coexist with other veillonella spp. in tongue biofilm.  in this study, the species-specific pcr primer pair for v. tobetsuensis was designed using partial sequences of the dnak gene. this is the first report using a species-specific primer pair for pcr to determine the distribution and frequency of v. tobetsuensis in tongue biofilm.

TI  == comparisons of subgingival microbial profiles of refractory periodontitis, severe periodontitis, and periodontal health using the human oral microbe identification microarray.
AB  == background: this study compared the subgingival microbiota of subjects with refractory periodontitis (rp) to those in subjects with treatable periodontitis (grs = good responders) or periodontal health (ph) using the human oral microbe identification microarray (homim). methods: at baseline, subgingival plaque samples were taken from 47 subjects with periodontitis and 20 individuals with ph and analyzed for the presence of 300 species by homim. the subjects with periodontitis were classified as having rp (n = 17) based on mean attachment loss (al) and/or more than three sites with al >or=2.5 mm after scaling and root planing, surgery, and systemically administered amoxicillin and metronidazole or  as grs (n = 30) based on mean attachment gain and no sites with al >or=2.5 mm after treatment. significant differences in taxa among the groups were sought using the kruskal-wallis and chi(2) tests. results: more species were detected in patients with disease (gr or rp) than in those without disease (ph). subjects with rp were distinguished from grs or those with ph by a significantly higher frequency of putative periodontal pathogens, such as parvimonas micra (previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros), campylobacter gracilis, eubacterium nodatum, selenomonas noxia, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella spp., treponema spp., and eikenella corrodens, as well as unusual species (pseudoramibacter alactolyticus,  tm7 spp. oral taxon [ot] 346/356, bacteroidetes sp. ot 272/274, solobacterium moorei, desulfobulbus sp. ot 041, brevundimonas diminuta, sphaerocytophaga sp. ot 337, shuttleworthia satelles, filifactor alocis, dialister invisus/pneumosintes,  granulicatella adiacens, mogibacterium timidum, veillonella atypica, mycoplasma salivarium, synergistes sp. cluster ii, and acidaminococcaceae [g-1] sp. ot 132/150/155/148/135) (p <0.05). species that were more prevalent in subjects with ph than in patients with periodontitis included actinomyces sp. ot 170, actinomyces spp. cluster i, capnocytophaga sputigena, cardiobacterium hominis, haemophilus parainfluenzae, lautropia mirabilis, propionibacterium propionicum, rothia dentocariosa/mucilaginosa, and streptococcus sanguinis (p <0.05). conclusion: as determined by homim, patients with rp presented a distinct microbial profile compared to patients in the gr and ph groups.

TI  == molecular identification of the first human isolate belonging to the veillonella  ratti-veillonella criceti group based on 16s rdna and dnak gene sequencing.
AB  == anaerobic gram-negative cocci belonging to the genus veillonella are currently subdivided into eight species. among them, four have been isolated either from human flora or from clinical samples during infectious processes: veillonella atypica, v. dispar, v. parvula and v. montpellierensis. to date, the four other species have only been found in animals. in particular, v. ratti and v. criceti,  since their characterization, have been exclusively reported from mouth and intestine of rodents. we report here for the first time a human isolate belonging to the v. ratti-v. criceti group recovered in mixed aerobic-anaerobic flora from  a semen sample in a 24-year-old man attending the urology unit of our hospital for infertility. identification of the isolate was based on 16s ribosomal dna and dnak gene sequencing. since then, two strains of veillonella sp. recovered from semen samples remained unidentified to the species level, and 16s rdna-based phylogenetic analysis revealed that they might represent novel taxa within the genus veillonella. taken together, these observations suggest that host restriction may not exist in the genus veillonella and that bacterial diversity remains underestimated both within this genus and in human semen.

TI  == intra-chromosomal heterogeneity between the four 16s rrna gene copies in the genus veillonella: implications for phylogeny and taxonomy.
AB  == among the seven species characterized within the genus veillonella, three (veillonella dispar, veillonella parvula and veillonella atypica) have so far been isolated from human flora and during infectious processes. sequencing and analysis of 16s rdna (rrs) has been described as the best method for identification of veillonella strains at the species level since phenotypic characteristics are unable to differentiate between species. rrs sequencing for the three species isolated from humans showed more than 98 % identity between them. four rrs copies were found in the reference strains and in all the clinical isolates studied. the sequences of each rrs were determined for the clinical strain adv 360.1, and they showed a relatively high level of heterogeneity (1.43  %). in the majority of cases, polymorphic positions corresponded to nucleotides allowing differentiation between the three species isolated from humans. moreover, variability observed between rrs copies was higher than that between 16s rdna sequences of v. parvula and v. dispar. phylogenetic analysis showed that polymorphism between rrs copies affected the position of strain adv 360.1 in the  tree. variable positions occurred in stems and loops belonging to variable and hypervariable regions of the 16s rrna secondary structure but did not change the  overall structure of the 16s rrna. pcr-rflp experiments performed on 27 clinical  isolates of veillonella sp. suggested that inter-rrs heterogeneity occurs widely  among the members of the genus veillonella: these results, together with the lack of phenotypic criteria for species differentiation, give preliminary arguments for unification of v. dispar and v. parvula.
