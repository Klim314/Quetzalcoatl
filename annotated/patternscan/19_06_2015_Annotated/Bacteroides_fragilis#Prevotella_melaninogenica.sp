TI  == discovery of beta-1,4-d-mannosyl-n-acetyl-d-glucosamine phosphorylase involved in the metabolism of n-glycans.
AB  == a gene cluster involved in n-glycan metabolism was identified in the genome of bacteroides thetaiotaomicron vpi-5482. this gene cluster encodes a major facilitator superfamily transporter, a starch utilization system-like transporter consisting of a tonb-dependent oligosaccharide transporter and an outer membrane  lipoprotein, four glycoside hydrolases (alpha-mannosidase, beta-n-acetylhexosaminidase, exo-alpha-sialidase, and endo-beta-n-acetylglucosaminidase), and a phosphorylase (bt1033) with unknown function. it was demonstrated that bt1033 catalyzed the reversible phosphorolysis of beta-1,4-d-mannosyl-n-acetyl-d-glucosamine in a typical sequential bi bi mechanism. these results indicate that bt1033 plays a crucial role as a key enzyme in the n-glycan catabolism where beta-1,4-d-mannosyl-n-acetyl-d-glucosamine is liberated from n-glycans by sequential glycoside hydrolase-catalyzed reactions, transported into the cell, and intracellularly converted into alpha-d-mannose 1-phosphate and n-acetyl-d-glucosamine. in addition, intestinal anaerobic bacteria such as bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides helcogenes, bacteroides salanitronis, bacteroides vulgatus, prevotella denticola, prevotella dentalis, prevotella melaninogenica, parabacteroides distasonis, and alistipes finegoldii were also suggested to possess the similar metabolic pathway for n-glycans. a notable feature of the new metabolic pathway for n-glycans is the more efficient use of atp-stored energy, in comparison with the conventional pathway where beta-mannosidase and atp-dependent hexokinase participate, because it is possible to directly phosphorylate the d-mannose residue of beta-1,4-d-mannosyl-n-acetyl-d-glucosamine to enter glycolysis. this is the first report of a metabolic pathway for n-glycans that includes a phosphorylase. we propose 4-o-beta-d-mannopyranosyl-n-acetyl-d-glucosamine:phosphate alpha-d-mannosyltransferase as the systematic name and beta-1,4-d-mannosyl-n-acetyl-d-glucosamine phosphorylase as the short name for bt1033.

TI  == anaerobic gram-negative bacilli
AB  == at present there are over two dozen genera of gram-negative anaerobic bacilli. in most clinical infections, only the genera bacteroides, prevotella, and fusobacterium need be considered. these genera are prevalent in the body as members of the normal flora (fig.20-1), constituting one-third of the total anaerobic isolates from clinical specimens, and may become involved in infections throughout the body (fig.20-2). within the bacteroides group, b fragilis is the most common pathogen, followed by b thetaiotaomicron and other members of the b fragilis group. among the bile-sensitive prevotella species, the ones most commonly encountered clinically are p melaninogenica, p oris, and p buccae. porphyromonas species seem to be much less pathogenic except in dental infections. fusobacterium nucleatum is the fusobacterium species most often found as a pathogen, but f necrophorum occasionally produces serious disease. these genera contain numerous other species that rarely or never infect humans.

TI  == evaluation of new gyrb-based real-time pcr system for the detection of b. fragilis as an indicator of human-specific fecal contamination.
AB  == a rapid and specific gyrb-based real-time pcr system has been developed for detecting bacteroides fragilis as a human-specific marker of fecal contamination. its specificity and sensitivity was evaluated by comparison with other 16s rrna gene-based primers using closely related bacteroides and prevotella. many studies have used 16s rrna gene-based method targeting bacteroides because this genus is  relatively abundant in human feces and is useful for microbial source tracking. however, 16s rrna gene-based primers are evolutionarily too conserved among taxa  to discriminate between human-specific species of bacteroides and other closely related genera, such as prevotella. recently, one of the housekeeping genes, gyrb, has been used as an alternative target in multilocus sequence analysis (mlsa) to provide greater phylogenetic resolution. in this study, a new b. fragilis-specific primer set (bf904f/bf958r) was designed by alignments of 322 gyrb genes and was compared with the performance of the 16s rrna gene-based primers in the presence of b. fragilis, bacteroides ovatus and prevotella melaninogenica. amplicons were sequenced and a phylogenetic tree was constructed  to confirm the specificity of the primers to b. fragilis. the gyrb-based primers  successfully discriminated b. fragilis from b. ovatus and p. melaninogenica. real-time pcr results showed that the gyrb primer set had a comparable sensitivity in the detection of b. fragilis when compared with the 16s rrna primer set. the host-specificity of our gyrb-based primer set was validated with  human, pig, cow, and dog fecal samples. the gyrb primer system had superior human-specificity. the gyrb-based system can rapidly detect human-specific fecal  source and can be used for improved source tracking of human contamination.

TI  == preliminary report on anaerobic culture at mymensingh medical college hospital in bangladesh.
AB  == puerperal sepsis is an important cause of maternal morbidity and mortality in developing countries. this study was undertaken to isolate and identify the anaerobic bacterial agents of puerperal sepsis among the patients admitted in mymensingh medical college hospital (mmch) during the period from july 2006 to june 2007. endocervical swabs/secretions were collected from 50 cases of puerperal sepsis and were cultured anaerobically. anaerobiasis was done by using  gas pack (bd gas pak tm ez) in anaerobic jar. out of 50 samples, 42(84%) yielded  growth in cultures. among 42 culture positive cases, 20(40%) were aerobic organisms and 22(44%) were mixed, i.e., aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. the isolated anaerobic organisms were peptostreptococcus 14(63.63%), bacteroides fragilis 3(13.64%), prevotella melaninogenica 3(13.64%) and clostridium perfringens 2(9.09%). as a preliminary study, it was observed that anaerobic culture could be carried out with available logistic arrangement. so, it was recommended to design further study on anaerobic bacterial isolation with particular emphasis on their antimicrobial susceptibility.

TI  == rapid identification of non-sporing anaerobes using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and an identification strategy.
AB  == purpose: the non-sporing anaerobes cause a wide spectrum of infections. they are  difficult to culture and their identification is tedious and time-consuming. rapid identification of anaerobes is highly desirable. towards this end, the potential of nuclear magnetic resonance (nmr) spectroscopy for providing a fingerprint within the proton spectrum of six genera belonging to anaerobes reflecting their characteristic metabolites has been investigated. methods: nmr analysis was carried out using mercury plus varian 300 mhz (7.05 t) nmr spectrophotometer on six different anaerobes. these included bacteroides fragilis, prevotella melaninogenica, prevotella denticola, fusobacterium necrophorum, peptococcus niger and peptostreptococcus spp. after the nmr analysis (256/512 scans), the different peaks were noted. the eight pus specimens, which yielded pure culture of anaerobe, also were analysed similarly. results: the major resonances of multiplex of amino acids/lipid at 0.9 ppm along with lactate/lipid at 1.3 ppm, acetate at 1.92 ppm and multiplex of lysine at 3.0 ppm  remained constant to label the organism as an anaerobe. there was a difference found in the mr spectra of different genera and species. a simple algorithm was developed for the identification of the six different anaerobes studied. the mr spectra of the pure culture of the organism matched the mr spectra of pus from which the organism was isolated. conclusions: mr-based identification was of value in the identification of anaerobes. however, a larger database of the peaks produced by anaerobes needs to be created for identification of all genera and species. it could then have the potential of diagnosing an anaerobic infection in vivo and thus expedite management of deep-seated abscesses.

TI  == role of anaerobes in acute pelvic inflammatory disease.
AB  == pouch of douglas aspirates were collected from 50 women with history and examination suggestive of acute pelvic inflammatory disease (pid) and 20 healthy  women admitted for tubal ligation served as control. a total of 57 microorganisms were isolated from 37 patients out of 50 in study group. of 37 positive cultures  21(56.7%) were monomicrobial and 16(43.2%) were polymicrobial. most common symptom in study group was lower abdominal pain (90%), vaginal discharge (70%) and irregular bleeding (40%) and 30% patients had history of intrauterine contraceptive device (iucd) implantation. the predominant aerobic isolates were escherichia coli, coagulase negative staphylococcus (cons), staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae while common anaerobes were bacteroides fragilis, prevotella melaninogenica, fusobacterium nucleatum and peptostreptococcus spp. our study shows that cefotaxime, cefuroxime and gentamicin may be used for gram negative aerobic bacilli; cloxacillin, cephaloridine and erythromycin for aerobic gram positive cocci and amikacin and ceftazidime for pseudomonas aeruginosa. thus for optimum therapy of acute pid it is beneficial to keep in mind major conceptual changes and therapeutic realities that have influenced current understanding of acute pid and have affected the choice of therapy.

TI  == activities of four frog skin-derived antimicrobial peptides (temporin-1dra, temporin-1va and the melittin-related peptides ar-23 and rv-23) against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the activities of two antimicrobial peptides belonging to the temporin family (temporin-1dra from rana draytonii and temporin-1va from rana virgatipes) and two peptides with structural similarity to the bee venom peptide melittin (ar-23 from rana tagoi and rv-23 from r. draytonii) were evaluated against a range of reference strains and clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria. these peptides were selected because they show broad-spectrum growth inhibitory activity against reference strains of several medically important aerobic microorganisms and against clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus. all peptides showed relatively high potency (minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) </=25 microm) against the gram-positive bacilli propionibacterium acnes and clostridium tertium and the gram-positive cocci peptostreptococcus anaerobius. activity was lower and more variable against clostridium septicum, clostridium perfringens and peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus. growth of the gram-negative  bacilli bacteroides fragilis and fusobacterium spp. was poorly inhibited, but all the peptides were active (mic</=25 microm) against prevotella melaninogenica. the clinical utility of the melittin-related peptides is limited by their toxicities, but temporin-1dra and temporin-1va have relatively low haemolytic activity against human erythrocytes and so represent candidates for drug development, particularly for topical therapy of infected surface lesions.

TI  == an in vitro time-kill assessment of linezolid and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == linezolid is a novel oxazolidinone antibacterial agent active against staphylococci (including methicillin-resistant strains), enterococci (including vancomycin-resistant strains), streptococci (including penicillin-intermediate and -resistant streptococcus pneumoniae), and other aerobic and facultative bacteria. the agent has also demonstrated activity against a broad spectrum of gram-positive and gram-negative anaerobic bacteria. previous time-kill assessments have shown linezolid to be generally bacteriostatic against staphylococci and enterococci, and bactericidal against streptococci. in this study, an anaerobic glovebox technique was employed to conduct time-kill assessments for four strains of anaerobic gram-positive, and seven strains of anaerobic gram-negative bacteria. the time-kill experiment was performed using anaerobe broth medium. the drugs were tested at four-fold the minimum inhibitory  concentration (mic), or at the higher concentration of 8mg/l for linezolid, 2mg/l for clindamycin, and 8mg/l for metronidazole. samples for viable count were taken at 0, 6, and 24h, and plated using the bioscience international autospiral dw. exposure of samples to the aerobic environment during plating was held to less than 30min. plates were counted after a 48h anaerobic incubation (37 degrees c).  the species tested included bacteroides fragilis (2), b. distasonis, b. thetaiotaomicron, fusobacterium nucleatum, f. varium, prevotella melaninogenica,  clostridium perfringens, eubacterium lentum and peptostreptococcus anaerobius (2). the activity of linezolid was compared to that of metronidazole and clindamycin, two standard anti-anaerobe agents. as expected, the control agents were very active in these assays. metronidazole yielded log(10)cfu/ml reductions  of 3.0 or greater for nine of ten strains; clindamycin yielded log(10)cfu/ml reductions of 2.0 or greater for six of 11 strains, and 3.0 or greater for three  strains. linezolid also produced significant in vitro killing in this model achieving log(10)cfu/ml reductions of 2.0 or greater for six of 11 strains, and 3.0 or greater for four strains. the profile of activity was similar to that of clindamycin indicating that additional developmental studies of linezolid with anaerobic bacteria are warranted.

AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2001 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems and carbapenems. a total of 3,245 strains in 32 species of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from january to december, and consisted of moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii, citrobacter koseri, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabillis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia spp. (p. alcalifaciens, p. rettgeri, p. stuartii), pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas putida, burkholderia cepacia, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, haemophilus influenzae, acinetobactor baumannii, acinetobactor lwoffii, bacteroides fragilis  group (b. fragilis, b. vulgatus, b. distasonis, b. ovatus, b. thetaiotaomicron),  and prevotella spp. (p. melaninogenica, p. intermedia, p. bivia, p. oralis, p. denticola). czop possessed stable antibacterial activities against m. (b.) catarrhalis, e. coli, c. freundii, c. koseri, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, e. aerogenes, e. cloacae, s. marcescens, p. mirabilis, p. vulgaris, m. morganii, providencia spp., p. aeruginosa, and a. lwoffii throughout 6 years. the mic90 of  czop against those strains were consistent with those obtained from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. on the other hand, the mic90 of czop against h. influenzae yearly obviously increased with approximately 64-time difference during the study period. the mic90 of cefpirome, cefepime, and flomoxef against h. influenzae also yearly tended to rise. the present results demonstrated that czop had maintained the antibacterial activity against almost gram-negative strains tested. however, the decrease in antibacterial activities of czop against b. cepacia, and h. influenzae was suggested.

TI  == [effect of a polyoxydonium immunoregulator on the biological properties of microorganisms].
AB  == the effect of the synthetic immunomodulator polyoxydonium (po) on some biological properties of pathogenic bacteria (shigella flexneri, salmonella enteritidis), opportunistic bacteria (klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, bacteroides fragilis, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, prevotella melaninogenica, propionibacterium propionicum, clostridium difficile) and fungi (candida albicans), isolated during enteric infections, enteric dysbiosis, pyoinflammatory diseases, was evaluated in a number of in vitro experiments. the study revealed that the recommended therapeutic concentration of po decreased antilysozyme activity (ala) and the anticomplement  activity in klebsiella, shigella, propionibacterium, clostridium, bacteroids, fungi of the genus candida, but increased ala in nonhemolytic escherichia. under  the action of po an increased sensitivity of the microorganisms under study to definite antibiotics of the lincosamide, fluoroquinolon, carbapenem and cephalosporin groups was noted. the data obtained in this study reveal one of the possible mechanisms of the corrective action of po on the microbiocenosis of the  intestine in dysbiosis, enteric infections and pyoinflammatory diseases.

TI  == evaluation of the rapid id 32a system for identification of anaerobic gram-negative bacilli, excluding the bacteroides fragilis group.
AB  == objective: to evaluate the rapid id 32a system (biomerieux, marcy-l'etoile, france) for the identification of anaerobic gram-negative bacilli, excluding the  bacteroides fragilis group. methods: five hundred and twenty-eight identified clinical isolates of non-b. fragilis group anaerobic gram-negative bacilli were tested in the rapid id 32a system, and identifications were compared with those obtained with conventional biochemical tests and gas-liquid chromatography. results: the rapid id 32a system correctly identified 280 (60.9%) of the 460 isolates tested for which taxa were included in the database, without the need for additional testing. a further 97 (21.1%) isolates were correctly identified to species level following the performance of complementary tests recommended by  the manufacturer. fifty-nine (12.8%) isolates were identified at the genus level  only, and 21 (4.6%) were misidentified at the species level. three isolates of prevotella were not identified by the system. of the 68 isolates belonging to taxa not included in the database, no identification was obtained for 33 (48.5%), while 35 (51.5%) were misidentified. conclusions: the rapid id 32a system provided a rapid and reliable method for the identification of non-b. fragilis group, anaerobic gram-negative bacilli to the genus level, while the success of species-level identification varied with different taxa. there was poor discrimination between fusobacterium nucleatum and f. necrophorum, between porphyromonas asaccharolytica and porphyromonas endodontalis, and between prevotella buccalis, prevotella denticola, prevotella loescheii, prevotella melaninogenica and prevotella oralis. the need to perform conventional complementary tests on 149 (32.4%) of the 460 isolates compromised the usefulness of the system for rapid species identification.

TI  == induction of oxidative dna damage in anaerobes.
AB  == we compared oxidative dna damage in strictly anaerobic prevotella melaninogenica, aerotolerant anaerobic bacteroides fragilis, and facultative anaerobic salmonella typhimurium after exposure to o2 or h2o2. using hplc with electrochemical detection, we measured 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8ohdg) as a damage marker. o2 induced 8ohdg in p. melaninogenica but not in b. fragilis, which shows catalase activity, or in s. typhimurium. in p. melaninogenica, with catalase, o2 induced less 8ohdg; superoxide dismutase had no effect; with glucose and glucose oxidase, o2 induced more 8ohdg. h2o2 also markedly increased 8ohdg. o2 was suggested to induce 8ohdg through h2o2. o2 or h2o2 decreased survival only in p. melaninogenica. highly sensitive to oxidative stress, p. melaninogenica could prove useful for investigating oxidative dna damage.

AB  == lipopolysaccharides (lpss) of 11 bacterial strains from the type species of the genera bacteroides (b. fragilis), prevotella (pr. melaninogenica), porphyromonas  (po. gingivalis), campylobacter (c. fetus subsp. fetus), and wolinella (w. succinogenes), and from the type strains of b. distasonis, b. forsythus, b. ureolyticus, po. levii, po. macacae, and c. gracilis, were extracted with hot water-phenol (westphal method). s-form lpss, obtained from all organisms, were well resolved with tricine-sodium-dodecyl-sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by silver staining. lipid a was not stained. also  profiles from lps of escherichia coli, serotypes 0111:b4 and 055:b5, could be distinguished. while w. succinogenes showed a relatively short s-form lps on electrophoregrams, the other bacteria, including b. fragilis, exhibited long-ladder lpss. po. gingivalis displayed the largest number of bands and the longest o-chain. the long o-chain of this bacterium may be important for its virulence.

TI  == characterization of saccharolytic bacteroides and prevotella isolates from infected dog and cat bite wounds in humans.
AB  == saccharolytic, nonpigmented, anaerobic gram-negative rods isolated from infected  dog and cat bite wounds in humans have been poorly characterized, and most are not included in the databases of kits used for anaerobic identification; thus, they are problematic for clinical laboratories to identify. fifty strains isolated from such wounds were characterized with commercial kits for preformed-enzyme detection, carbohydrate fermentation, and other biochemical tests. pcr fingerprinting was performed on these strains to further characterize  subgroups within these species. bacteroides tectum is a frequent isolate in bite  wounds and resembles prevotella bivia in colony morphology and saccharolytic activity, except that it grows in 20% bile and hydrolyzes esculin. profile numbers generated by various kits associate b. tectum with p. bivia, prevotella oralis group, or prevotella melaninogenica. pcr fingerprinting identified at least four subgroups and confirmed the heterogeneous nature of this species. prevotella heparinolytica was also frequently isolated from these bite wounds. it produces indole and generates a profile number in preformed-enzyme kits that is usually associated with bacteroides uniformis. however, it is bile sensitive and  quite distinct from the bacteroides fragilis group of anaerobes. the pcr fingerprint profiles generated by strains of p. heparinolytica were very similar  to that of the type strain and to each other. prevotella zoogleoformans, occasionally isolated from dog and cat bite wounds in humans, resembles p. heparinolytica except for a negative indole test. clinical laboratories should be aware of the characteristics of these animal species when identifying isolates from animal bite wounds in humans.

TI  == deep-neck space abscesses.
AB  == objective: despite a reduction in the incidence, deep-neck space infections are still seen today with definite potential for significant morbidity and even mortality. design: the authors present their experience in the management of 16 patients with 19 deep-neck space abscesses. the distribution of the abscesses were: 5 ludwig's angina, 4 parapharyngeal abscesses, 3 retropharyngeal abscesses, 3 in the sub-mandibular triangle, 3 in the deep anterior triangle, and 1 in the deep posterior triangle. results: the source of infection was odontogenic in six  patients, pharyngeal in three, otogenic in one, and could not be identified in the other six patients. most cases presented with pain and neck swelling. plain x-ray films, computed tomography, ultrasonography, and magnetic resonance imaging were the main diagnostic procedures. positive culture was obtained in only nine cases (56.2%). no predominant single organism was identified. antimicrobial therapy and surgical drainage were the mainstay of treatment. two cases were complicated by internal jugular-vein thrombophlebitis. all the patients survived  without major residual sequelae. conclusions: the etiology, presentation, and management of deep-neck space infections are briefly reviewed.

TI  == enhancement of growth of group a beta-hemolytic streptococci in mixed infections  with aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == objective: to evaluate the potential for mutual enhancement of growth of group a  beta-hemolytic streptococci (gabhs), and 11 commonly associated aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms frequently isolated in tonsillar infections. methods: enhancement was assessed by measuring the relative increase in colony-forming units (cfu) of gabhs and each of the 11 microorganisms inducing a subcutaneous abscess in mice. results: of the 11 combinations of gabhs and aerobe or anaerobe, gabhs was enhanced in 10 cases and the other microorganism in 5, namely, staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus influenzae type b, klebsiella pneumoniae, prevotella melaninogenica and bacteroides fragilis. conclusions: these findings confirm the mutual symbiotic enhancement of growth of gabhs in the presence of other aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.

TI  == the in vitro activity of trospectomycin against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the authors evaluated the activity of trospectomycin, a new aminocyclitol which is characterized by good antibacterial and broad spectrum activity, in comparison with clindamycin and ampicillin on a sample of recent isolates: bacteroides fragilis (15 strains), bacteroides urealyticus (5 strains), bacteroides vulgatus  (5 strains), bacteroides spp. (15 strains), prevotella melaninogenica (6 strains), porphyromonas asaccharolytica (7 strains), mobiluncus spp. (3 strains), peptococcus niger (3 strains), peptococcus variabilis (9 strains), peptococcus spp (30 strains), peptostreptococcus anaerobius (5 strains), peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus (3 strains), peptostreptococcus spp. (25 strains) and propionibacterium spp. (7 strains). the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) were determined for all strains by microtiter serial dilutions in wilkins-chalgren broth in an anaerobic chamber in  an atmosphere of 10% h2, 10% co2, 80% n2. all the drugs tested exert their activity against gram-positive and gram-negative anaerobic isolates. in particular, trospectomycin is quite active against gram-positive cocci (mic 90 =  4 - 8 mg/l), gram-negative rods (mic 90 = 8 - 16 mg/l), gram-positive rods (mic 90 = 4 mg/l) and mobiluncus spp. (mic 90 = 0.5 mg/l).

TI  == immunological detection of bacteroides fragilis in clinical samples.
AB  == a monospecific polyclonal antiserum, prepared against bacteroides fragilis common polysaccharide antigen purified by polyacrylamide gel immunoblot detected b. fragilis, b. thetaiotaomicron, b. ovatus and prevotella melaninogenica in pus samples from various anatomical sites by immunofluorescence microscopy of the pus. with standard clinical laboratory culture methods, 36% of 147 samples were positive for one or more of the above bacteria. of these, b. fragilis accounted for 33%. by immunofluorescent labelling of pus with the common antigen antiserum  the detection of these bacteria in the samples increased to 50%. all nine of the  blood cultures in which b. fragilis was detected by culture contained bacteria positive for the common antigen. immunofluorescent labelling of pus samples with  a selection of monoclonal antibodies specific for surface polysaccharides which are known to be antigenically variable in culture in vitro and in an animal model of infection showed that these polysaccharides are also variable in natural infection. the results indicate that the common polysaccharide antigen, in contrast to the variable surface polysaccharides, is a suitable target for the immunodetection of b. fragilis in clinical samples from a range of anatomical sites.

TI  == antibacterial effects of some root end filling materials.
AB  == in addition to having good sealing ability, root end filling materials should "ideally" have some antibacterial activity to prevent bacterial growth. this investigation compared the antibacterial effects of amalgam, zinc oxide-eugenol,  super eba and a mineral trioxide aggregate on nine facultative bacteria streptococcus fecalis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, lactobacillus species, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, bacillus subtilis, and escherichia coli b and seven strict anaerobic bacteria, prevotella (bacteroides) buccae, bacteroides fragilis, prevotella (bacteroides) intermedia, prevotella (bacteroides) melaninogenica, fusobacterium  necrophorum, fusobacterium nucleatum, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius. after growing these bacteria on solid media, freshly mixed and 24-h set test materials  were placed on the surface of these inoculated media and incubated in the appropriate atmosphere for 24 to 48 h at 37 degrees c. impregnated discs with the super eba liquid were used as positive controls. the antibacterial effects of each material were measured in millimeters and the data were analyzed using one-way and two-way analysis of variance and scheffe tests to determine the statistical differences between the antibacterial effects of the test materials.  impregnated discs with super eba liquid caused varying degrees of growth inhibition for both facultative and strict anaerobic bacteria. both types of amalgam had no antibacterial effect against any of the bacteria tested in this study. mineral trioxide aggregate had an antibacterial effect on some of the facultative bacteria and no effect on any of the strict anaerobic bacteria. zinc  oxide-eugenol and super eba pastes had some antibacterial effects on both types of bacteria tested.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == prevotella and porphyromonas infections in children.
AB  == from 1974 to 1994, 504 isolates of prevotella and porphyromonas spp. were obtained from 435 (21%) of 2033 specimens from 418 children. they included 160 (32%) pr. melaninogenica, 105 (21%) pr. intermedia, 84 (17%) p. asaccharolytica,  58 (12%) pr. orisbuccae, and 58 (12%) pr. oralis. most prevotella and porphyromonas spp. were isolated from abscesses (176), pulmonary infections (85), ear infections (82), wound infections (44), peritonitis (38), paronychia (15) and chronic sinusitis (14). predisposing conditions were noted in 111 (27%) of the cases; these included previous surgery in 41 (10%), foreign body in 36 (9%), neurological deficiencies in 29 (7%), immunodeficiency in 21 (5%), steroid therapy in 12 (4%), diabetes in 8 (2%) and malignancy in 7 (2%). prevotella and porphyromonas spp. were the only isolates in 14 (3%) patients, and mixed infection was encountered in 404 (97%). the micro-organisms most commonly isolated with prevotella and porphyromonas spp. were anaerobic cocci (393 isolates), fusobacterium spp. (108), bacteroides spp. (b. fragilis group) (95), escherichia coli (56) and other gram-negative anaerobic bacilli (52). most bacteroides spp. and e. coli were isolated from intra-abdominal infections and skin and soft tissue infections around the rectal area, whereas most fusobacterium spp. were isolated from oropharyngeal, pulmonary and head and neck  sites. beta-lactamase production was detected in 191 (38%) prevotella and porphyromonas isolates from all body sites. all patients received antimicrobial therapy, and surgical drainage was performed in 173 (41%) cases. four patients died from their infection. these data illustrate the spectrum and importance of prevotella and porphyromonas spp. in infections in children.

TI  == phylogeny of bacteroides, prevotella, and porphyromonas spp. and related bacteria.
AB  == the phylogenetic structure of the bacteroides subgroup of the cytophaga-flavobacter-bacteroides (cfb) phylum was examined by 16s rrna sequence  comparative analysis. approximately 95% of the 16s rrna sequence was determined for 36 representative strains of species of prevotella, bacteroides, and porphyromonas and related species by a modified sanger sequencing method. a phylogenetic tree was constructed from a corrected distance matrix by the neighbor-joining method, and the reliability of tree branching was established by bootstrap analysis. the bacteroides subgroup was divided primarily into three major phylogenetic clusters which contained most of the species examined. the first cluster, termed the prevotella cluster, was composed of 16 species of prevotella, including p. melaninogenica, p. intermedia, p. nigrescens, and the ruminal species p. ruminicola. two oral species, p. zoogleoformans and p. heparinolytica, which had been recently placed in the genus prevotella, did not fall within the prevotella cluster. these two species and six species of bacteroides, including the type species b. fragilis, formed the second cluster, termed the bacteroides cluster. the third cluster, termed the porphyromonas cluster, was divided into two subclusters. the first contained porphyromonas gingivalis, p. endodontalis, p. asaccharolytica, p. circumdentaria, p. salivosa,  [bacteroides] levii (the brackets around genus are used to indicate that the species does not belong to the genus by the sensu stricto definition), and [bacteroides] macacae, and the second subcluster contained [bacteroides] forsythus and [bacteroides] distasonis. [bacteroides] splanchnicus fell just outside the three major clusters but still belonged within the bacteroides subgroup. with few exceptions, the 16 s rrna data were in overall agreement with  previously proposed reclassifications of species of bacteroides, prevotella, and  porphyromonas. suggestions are made to accommodate those species which do not fit previous reclassification schemes.

AB  == the polar lipid composition of representative strains of bacteroides fragilis, prevotella intermedia, p. melaninogenica and capnocytophaga ochracea was determined. samples were analysed by fab-ms. forty major peaks had m/z values expected for known carboxylate anions, ranging from m/z 211 (tridecenoate) to m/z 381 (pentacontanoate). a further fifty-five major peaks were studied between m/z  561 and m/z 722. forty-five anionic phospholipids of several series were identified. the pearson coefficient of linear correlation revealed the similarity of the p. intermedia spectra from repeat experiments (r = 0.98), as opposed to inter-species comparisons (0.55, 0.22, 0.20). thus, fab-ms rapidly yields data on molecular species within phospholipid families not readily obtained by other means. the data obtained may have chemotaxonomic potential.

AB  == to assess the in vitro activity of cefpodoxime against anaerobic respiratory tract and oropharyngeal pathogens 77 strains belonging to 18 gram-negative and 7  gram-positive species were studied by means of agar dilution tests. for comparison cefuroxime, amoxicillin, amoxicillin + clavulanic acid and clindamycin were also tested. cefpodoxime was found to be active at concentrations of less than or equal to 0.125 mg/l against prevotella oralis, prevotella buccalis, prevotella bivia, porphyromonas asaccharolytica, bacteroides corporis, bacteroides gracilis, fusobacterium necrophorum, fusobacterium naviforme and propionibacterium acnes. prevotella oris, prevotella buccae, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, and ruminococcus bromii were inhibited at concentrations of less than or equal to 1 mg/l and prevotella denticola, prevotella melaninogenica, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides pneumosintes, and peptostreptococcus micros at concentrations of less than or equal to 4 mg/l. strains of veillonella parvula were inhibited by cefpodoxime at 0.25-8 mg/l, and single strains of peptostreptococcus anaerobius and peptostreptococcus magnus showed mics of 32 and 64 mg/l, respectively. the results obtained warrant the use of cefpodoxime in therapy of anaerobic and mixed aerobic-anaerobic infections of the upper and lower respiratory tract and similar infections not involving bacteroides fragilis.

TI  == prevotella, a new genus to include bacteroides melaninogenicus and related species formerly classified in the genus bacteroides.
AB  == it was recently proposed that the genus bacteroides should be restricted to bacteroides fragilis (the type species) and closely related organisms (viz., b. caccae, b. distasonis, b. eggerthii, b. merdae, b. ovatus, b. stercoris, b. thetaiotaomicron, b. uniformis, and b. vulgatus). by contrast, the moderately saccharolytic, predominantly oral bacteroides species, which include b. melaninogenicus, b. oralis, and related species, form a phenotypically and phylogenetically coherent group of species which differ so significantly from the emended description of the genus bacteroides that they should not be classified in the same genus. therefore, we formally propose that these species be reclassified in a new genus, prevotella. the type species is prevotella melaninogenica.

AB  == treatment efficacy of various antimicrobial regimens against anaerobes was studied in semipermeable chambers simulating a closed-space, locally neutropenic  infection site in rabbits. bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides melaninogenicus, clostridium perfringens, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius were inoculated (at a  mean of 5.3 log10 cfu/ml in prereduced pooled rabbit serum) into the chambers (one isolate per chamber) in triplicate. antimicrobial therapy consisted of cefoperazone, cefoperazone plus sulbactam, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, metronidazole (against the gram-negative anaerobes), or penicillin g (against the gram-positive anaerobes), beginning 4 hours after organism inoculation and continuing every 6 hours for 16 doses. with the use of anaerobic techniques for specimen acquisition, transport, and culture, quantitative bacterial findings were measured at the start of therapy and at various time points thereafter. antibiotic concentrations were measured in blood and chamber fluid by liquid chromatography or bioassay methods. at the end of the study in vivo organisms were reduced by at least 3 log10 cfu/ml from drug-free growth control chambers by all the antimicrobial regimens tested except for cefoperazone against b. fragilis and ciprofloxacin against the three isolates tested. the addition of sulbactam to cefoperazone inhibited b. fragilis beta-lactamase activity and eradicated b. fragilis in vivo. in vivo results with this model confirmed in vitro susceptibilities of all tested antimicrobials except ciprofloxacin and should provide useful indications of the potential clinical efficacy of other new agents against anaerobes.

AB  == the relationships between capsulate and non-capsulate bacteroides fragilis strains and escherichia coli, and between capsulate and non-capsulate strains of  the b. melaninogenicus group and streptococcus pyogenes, were studied in a subcutaneous abscess model in mice. selective antimicrobial agents directed against either aerobic or anaerobic bacteria were used alone or in combination to explore the effect of eradication of one component of the mixed infection. single agent therapy effective against both aerobic and anaerobic flora was also employed. single therapy of mixed infection directed at the elimination of only one organism (s. pyogenes, e. coli or bacteroides sp.) caused significant reductions in the numbers of sensitive organisms and also smaller yet significant decreases in the numbers of insensitive organisms. however, the abscesses were not eliminated after such therapy. combination therapy or use of a single agent (cefoxitin) directed against the aerobic and anaerobic components of the infection was more effective. non-capsulate bacteroides spp. became capsulate after passage in mice mixed with either s. pyogenes or e. coli. therapy directed  at the elimination of s. pyogenes and e. coli did not prevent the emergence of capsulate bacteroides spp. these data demonstrate the synergy between all members of the b. fragilis group and e. coli and between the b. melaninogenicus group and s. pyogenes, and reiterate the need to direct antimicrobial therapy at the eradication of the aerobic and anaerobic components of mixed infections.

TI  == significance of encapsulated bacteroides melaninogenicus and bacteroides fragilis groups in mixed infections.
AB  == organisms of the bacteroides melaninogenicus and bacteroides fragilis groups are  often found mixed with facultatively anaerobic organisms in infections. the relative importance of these bacteroides groups and facultative anaerobic pathogens in mixed infections was investigated in a subcutaneous abscess model in mice. this was determined by observing the effect of antimicrobial therapy directed against one or both organisms present in the abscess. clindamycin or metronidazole was used for treatment of infections caused by bacteroides species, and either gentamicin, penicillin, ampicillin, or oxacillin was used for treatment of infections caused by facultative flora. in almost all instances the  aerobic counterparts in the infection were more important than the unencapsulated bacteroides species. on the other hand, encapsulated b. melaninogenicus group organisms were found to be more important in abscess formation than were group a  streptococci, streptococcus pneumoniae, klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, and staphylococcus aureus. encapsulated b. fragilis group organisms were found to be more important than or as important as escherichia coli and group d streptococci and less important than s. aureus, group a streptococci, and k. pneumoniae in induction of subcutaneous abscesses. this study demonstrates that encapsulated bacteroides species are a factor that should be considered in the treatment of mixed infections with antibiotics.

TI  == synergism between penicillin, clindamycin, or metronidazole and gentamicin against species of the bacteroides melaninogenicus and bacteroides fragilis groups.
AB  == clinical isolates of the bacteroides melaninogenicus and bacteroides fragilis groups were tested for in vitro and in vivo susceptibility to penicillin, clindamycin, and metronidazole, used singly or in combination with gentamicin. the in vitro tests consisted of determinations of minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) carried out with or without constant amounts of gentamicin. when used alone, gentamicin had negligible effects on the bacteria but significantly reduced the mics of penicillin, clindamycin, and metronidazole against 11, 10, and 3, of the 15 strains of the b. melaninogenicus group, respectively. the 15 strains of the b. fragilis group were all beta-lactamase producers and were highly resistant to penicillin or the combination of penicillin and gentamicin. however, gentamicin reduced the mics of clindamycin and metronidazole against 1 and 7 strains of this group, respectively. the in vivo tests were carried out in mice and consisted of measurements of the effects  of the antimicrobial agents on the sizes and bacterial content of abscesses induced by subcutaneous injection of bacterial suspensions. the results of the in vivo tests were generally consistent with those obtained in vitro with strains of the b. melaninogenicus group. synergism between gentamicin and penicillin, clindamycin, or metronidazole was shown in 13, 10, and 3 strains of this group, respectively. in vivo synergism was not clearly demonstrated with the strains of  the b. fragilis group, possibly because clindamycin and metronidazole used alone  were highly efficacious. we suggest that the synergistic effect of gentamicin is  due to its increased transport into the bacterial cell in the presence of penicillin and, possibly, other antimicrobial agents. the newly recognized in vitro and in vivo synergism between penicillin and other antimicrobial agents and an aminoglycoside in b. melaninogenicus may have clinical implications that deserve to be investigated.

TI  == numerical taxonomy of some non-saccharolytic and saccharolytic bacteroides species.
AB  == various bacteroides spp. were examined by physiological tests, presence of specific enzymes, antibiotic sensitivity, menaquinone composition and a few miscellaneous tests. the data matrix containing 58 strains and 55 unit characters was examined using gower's similarity coefficients (sg) and included matching negative character states and multistate characters. the highly saccharolytic strains were separated from the less saccharolytic and non-fermentative strains at the 55% similarity level; while at the slightly higher level of 63% strains of capnocytophaga (formerly bact. ochraceus) were recovered as a compact phenon distinct from other saccharolytic species. the phenogram was divided into 6 clusters at 72% similarity level. most of the 'bact. fragilis group' of species clustered in one phenon while bact. melaninogenicus ssp. melaninogenicus, bact. bivius and a new species, bact. denticola, formed another group. another phenon comprised the saccharolytic non-pigmented species closely related to bact. oralis such as bact. buccalis and bact. pentosaceus. the less saccharolytic strains of bact. melaninogenicus ssp. intemedius and bact. disiens were recovered in a distinct phenon. the low affinity (less than 55% similarity) between the two subspecies of bact. melaninogenicus emphasised the need for reclassifying these taxa into separate species. the non-fermentative and very weakly saccharolytic strains formed good taxospecies. the separation of this cluster into three subclusters is in excellent agreement with chemotaxonomic data now available.

AB  == killing of proteus mirabilis by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes was tested in  the presence of different bacteroides species. in vitro experiments showed that anaerobic bacteria interfered with the killing of aerobic bacteria. however, this inhibitory effect was not a property of all bacteroides species. bacteroides gingivalis w83 showed the greatest inhibitory effect of the five bacteroides strains tested. killing of p. mirabilis was inhibited by the culture supernatant  of b. gingivalis but not by washed cells. two factors were found in the supernatant of b. gingivalis to account for the inhibitory effect. one was heat stable with a molecular weight of less than 3,500 and inhibited the killing activity of leukocytes, and the other was heat labile and partly inactivated the  complement system. the killing experiments paralleled chemiluminescence measurements.

AB  == the role of mycobacteria in the cavitation of large pneumoconiotic masses is well established. in other cases softness is attributed to an ischaemic or aseptic necrosis. five cases are described in which cavitation of the pulmonary masses was caused by anaerobic bacteria, confirmed by the growth of such bacterial in cultures after transtracheal or transpleural puncture. repeated cultures for mycobacteria gave negative results. two cases were acute, having serious complications such as bronchopleural fistula, empyema, and serious respiratory insufficiency. the role of anaerobes in cavitary pneumoconiosis has not been recognised previously, probably because of the special conditions required to culture these bacteria and the infrequent use of transtracheal puncture in the diagnosis of this entity. the prevalence of anaerobes as agents capable of cavitating pneumoconiotic masses remains to be established.

TI  == opsonization of four bacteroides species: role of the classical complement pathway and immunoglobulin.
AB  == previous investigators have suggested that opsonization of two bacteroides species is mediated exclusively by the alternative complement pathway and requires immunoglobulins. in this study, the nature of the opsonic factors in nonimmune human serum for four species of bacteroides was investigated by measuring uptake of [(3)h]thymidine-labeled bacteria by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes. normal human serum, c2-deficient serum, immunoglobulin-deficient serum, and serum chelated with ethylene glycol-bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-n,n-tetraacetic acid (egta), mgegta, and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (edta) were used as opsonic sources. heat inactivation of each of these sera significantly reduced its opsonic activity for all four bacteroides species, suggesting that serum complement was essential for effective opsonization. all strains were opsonized in the absence of the classical complement pathway; however, kinetics studies revealed that opsonization proceeded at a significantly faster rate when the classical complement pathway was intact. although two strains were opsonized in immunoglobulin-deficient sera, opsonization was less efficient and appeared to occur via the alternative complement pathway. unexpectedly, all strains were well opsonized by the classical complement pathway in 10% serum which had been effectively chelated with egta or edta. the explanation for this finding is unknown; however, it is possible that cell wall cations of bacteroides species may participate in the activation of complement in chelated serum, resulting in effective opsonization. it was also found that bacteroides, when incubated with an escherichia coli strain in normal serum, could compete for opsonins and thereby reduce phagocytosis of e. coli. it is possible that competition for opsonins among bacterial species contributes to the synergistic role these organisms share in mixed floral infections.

AB  == representative strains of two subspecies of bacteroides melaninogenicus (subspecies melaninogenicus and subspecies intermedius) and bacteroides asaccharolyticus as well as b. asaccharolyticus strain 536b isolated from a human perirectal abscess and bacteroides fragilis atcc 25285 were examined by glutaraldehyde-osmium fixation, ruthenium red fixation and staining, and thorium  hydroxyde staining as well as by the physical preparative techniques of critical  point drying--transmission electron microscopy (cpd--tem) and scanning electron microscopy (sem). all strains, with the exception of b. fragilis 25285, possessed an electron-dense material external to their outer membranes. ruthenium red staining further revealed a layer, external to the surface of the outer membrane, that was distinct for each species examined. thorium hydroxide, as well as cpd--tem and sem, showed the cells to be interconnected by thin fibers that not only connected adjacent cells but also traversed several microns to connect cell  aggregates.

TI  == anaerobic isolates in chronic recurrent suppurative otitis media. treatment with  carbenicillin alone and in combination with gentamicin.
AB  == tympanocentesis was performed in 32 pediatric patients with chronic recurrent suppurative otitis media. the aspirate was cultured aerobically and anaerobically. aerobes were isolated from ten patients (31.2%); anaerobes from one patient; and both aerobes and anaerobes from 21 patients (65.6%). there were  46 aerobic isolates. the aerobes commonly recovered were pseudomonas aeruginosa (24 isolates) proteus sp. (5) and staphylococcus aureus (3). there were 32 anaerobes isolated including anaerobic gram-positive cocci (19 isolates) and bacteroides sp., the latter of which included bacteroides fragilis group and bacteroides melaninogenicus (9). the patients were treated by parenteral carbenicillin 300 to 400 mg per kg per day given in four dosages administered for a period of 12 to 21 days (average 17 days). an aminoglycoside (gentamicin) was added in 15 patients. the clinical response was good in 17 patients and poor in 15. there were no side effects or adverse reactions noted during therapy. the above findings demonstrate the polymicrobial etiology of chronic recurrent suppurative otitis media and suggest that treatment directed against the aerobic  and anaerobic isolates is efficacious in more than half of the cases.

TI  == antibiotic susceptibility of anaerobic bacteria with special reference to bacteroides fragilis.
AB  == it was shown that recent swedish clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria are susceptible to many antibiotics by the agar dilution method with the exception of the bacteroides group versus beta-lactam antibiotics or tetracyclines. strains of b. fragilis were inhibited by 4--greater than 128 micrograms benzylpenicillin or  cephalothin/ml, 1.0--64 micrograms cefoxitin/ml, 0.064--2 micrograms clindamycin  or metronidazole/ml, 2--8 micrograms chloramphenicol/ml, 2--16 micrograms fusidic acid/ml and 0.032--32 micrograms doxycycline/ml. resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics was partly due to the production of beta-lactamase. growth of beta-lactamase producing strains in the presence of enzyme inhibitors such as clavulanic acid or cp-45899 together with cephaloridine lowered the mic's manyfold. cefoxitin with relative resistance to beta-lactamases inhibited the majority of the strains at 8 micrograms/ml. cefoxitin-resistant strains (mic greater than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml) were also resistant to the new cephalosporins bl-s786 and hr-756 as well as to the new cefamycins a, b, cl619-183, cs-1170 and sq-14359 and to thienamycin. cefamycin cl619-183, only showed a slightly higher in vitro activity than cefoxitin. resistance to the cefamycins could not be correlated to the production of beta-lactamases.

TI  == metronidazole in the prophylaxis and treatment of anaerobic infection.
AB  == the influence of prophylactic metronidazole on vaginal carriage rates of anaerobes and the development of postoperative anaerobic infection was studied in 104 women who underwent abdominal hysterectomy. metronidazole prophylaxis in 54 patients led to a decrease in the anaerobe vaginal carriage rate from 65% pre-operatively to 17% and 28% on the 3rd and 7th postoperative days respectively. in the control group (50 patients) no significant decrease in anaerobe yield was noted, corresponding percentages being 72%, 64%, and 74%. postoperative infection occurred in 36 patients (28 controls; 8 on prophylactic metronidazole). wound swabs from all 8 patients in the latter group yielded aerobes, and in 1 patient mixed infection (aerobes/anaerobes) occurred. in 7 of these patients (including the patient with mixed infection), the infection resolved spontaneously, while the 8th patient responded to therapy with metronidazole, kanamycin and ampicillin. in the control patients, 21 cases of postoperative wound infection and 4 of vault infection were seen; wound swabs from patients in the former group yielded aerobes in only 6 cases, and mixed growth of aerobes/anaerobes in 10 cases. postoperative wound/vault infections in  control patients cleared spontaneously in 18 cases and responded to imidazole therapy, with or without ampicillin and kanamycin, in 7 cases.

TI  == beta-lactamases in bacteroides.
AB  == bacteroides fragilis is responsible for most anaerobic infections in man. most isolates of b. fragilis show resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics. this resistance might be due to beta-lactamase production or permeability barrier in the cell wall. b. fragilis produce beta-lactamase with mainly cephalosporinase activity. other bacteroides species such as b. clostridiformis, b. melaninogenicus and b. oralis also produce beta-lactamase but with different biochemical characteristics.

TI  == quantitative evaluation of three commercial blood culture media for growth of anaerobic organisms.
AB  == the ability of three different commercial blood culture media--brain heart infusion broth (pfizer), thiol broth (difco), and prs-peptone broth (becton, dickinson & co.)--to support the growth of five different anaerobes is described. inocula of 100 and 1,000 colony-forming units per ml were used to evaluate potential differences in survival, lag time, growth rate, and doubling times of each anaerobe in each medium. in addition, each medium was evaluated for its ability to neutralize the antibacterial effects of whole blood. the results of this study indicate that the prs-peptone broth is superior to brain heart infusion and thiol broths. shorter lag times and accelerated generation times and growth rates were noted for more different anaerobes in the prs-peptone broth. neither the size of inoculum nor the addition of normal whole blood appeared to alter the survival or growth characteristics of the anaerobes in any medium. however, the addition of normal whole blood did extend the lag time of each anaerobe by approximately 1 to 2 h in each medium.

TI  == inhibition of phagocytosis in vitro by obligate anaerobes.
AB  == a variety of species of obligate anaerobes have been shown to interfere with the  phagocytosis and killing of proteus mirabilis and other aerobic bacteria in vitro. although all the obligate anaerobes examined showed this activity, the effect was greatest with strains of bacteroides melaninogenicus and b. fragilis.  in contrast, none of the 36 aerobes tested acted in this way. these observations  suggest that the presence of obligate anaerobes may be fundamental to the pathogenesis of some types of infections.

AB  == anaerobic isolates were tested for bacterial inhibitory activity. of 144 isolates, 102 were from oropharynegeal washings, and 42 were from clinical specimens. thirteen facultative bacterial species (seven members of the enterobacteriaceae and six species of gram-positive cocci) were used as indicators of inhibition. eleven anaerobic species were isolated from oral secretions. all isolates of bacteroides melaninogenicus, the most commonly recovered species, consistently inhibited several species of indicator bacteria.  bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides oralis, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius had unprecictable inhibitory activity, whereas most of the other oral anaerobes were  noninhibitory. the 42 clinical species were generally noninhibitory.

TI  == the polysaccharide capsule of bacteroides fragilis subspecies fragilis: immunochemical and morphologic definition.
AB  == a large-molecular-weight capsular polysaccharide was isolated from strains of bacteroides fragilis subspecies fragilis. by means of electron microscopy and staining with ruthenium red, the thick polysaccharide capsule was also visualized. with use of a radioactive antigen-binding assay, antibody to this capsular polysaccharide was demonstrated in antisera prepared in rabbits to each  of eight strains of b. fragilis fragilis. antibody of similar specificity was not found in antisera prepared to bacteroides melaninogenicus or to strains of bacteroides fragilis subspecies vulgatus and bacteroides fragilis subspecies distasonis; such antibody was found in antisera to only one of two strains of bacteroides fragilis subspecies thetaiotaomicron. the radioactive antigen-binding assay is a sensitive test for the detection of antibody to capsular polysaccharide. this polysaccharide antigen may form the basis of a serogrouping  system for b. fragilis.

TI  == survival of anaerobic and aerobic bacteria on cotton swabs in three transport systems.
AB  == the capacity of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria to survive on cotton swabs placed  into a dry gassed-out co2-filled tube (dgt), dry sterile aerobic tube (dat), and  a tube containing a modified stuarts' transport medium (mst), was assessed. pseudomonas aeruginosa increased in numbers by 2 and 3 logs when stored in mst and dat, respectively. the viability of p. aeruginosa, although retarded when compared to msa and dat, was not adversely affected by the co2 environment in the dgt. the mst maintained relatively constant numbers of streptococcus pyogenes during the 48-h storage period. the dat and the dgt were unable to maintain the viability of s. pyogenes. staphylococcus aureus, when stored in a dgt, dat, or mst, was maintained in relatively constant numbers throughout the entire storage  period. of the four anaerobic bacteria evaluated (bacteroides fragilis ssp. thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides melaninogenicus ssp. asaccharolyticus, fusobacterium nucleatum, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius), only b. fragilis ssp. thetaiotamicron survived the 48-h storage period in the dgt. under these test conditions the dgt did not adequately maintain the viability of the majority of anaerobic bacteria tested (when held on cotton swabs). however, the mst did maintain the viability of all species tested for at least the first 2 h of storage.
