TI  == characterization of the zinc-containing metalloprotease encoded by zpx and development of a species-specific detection method for enterobacter sakazakii.
AB  == enterobacter sakazakii causes a severe form of neonatal meningitis that occurs as sporadic cases as well as outbreaks. the disease has been epidemiologically associated with consumption of reconstituted, dried infant formulas. very little  information is available regarding pathogenicity of the organism and production of virulence factors. clinical and environmental strains were screened for production of factors which have activity against chinese hamster ovary (cho) cells in tissue culture. polymyxin b lysate and sonicate preparations but not culture supernatants from the strains caused "rounding" of cho cells. subsequent  studies showed that the cho cell-rounding factor is a proteolytic enzyme that has activity against azocasein. the cell-bound protease was isolated by using a combination of polymyxin b lysis, followed by sonication of cells harvested from  tryptone broth. the protease was purified to homogeneity by sequential ammonium sulfate precipitation, gel filtration chromatography with sephadex g-100, hydrophobic interaction chromatography with phenyl-sepharose cl-4b, and a second  gel filtration with sephadex g-100. in addition to activity against azocasein, the purified protease also exhibits activity against azocoll and insoluble casein but not elastin. the protease has a molecular weight of 38,000 and an isoelectric point of 4.4. it is heat labile and for maximal activity against azocasein has an optimum temperature of 37 degrees c and a ph range of 5 to 7. proteolytic activity is inhibited by ortho-phenanthroline and zincov but is not affected by phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, n-ethylmaleimide, and trypsin inhibitors, which demonstrates that the protease is a zinc-containing metalloprotease. the metalloprotease does not hemagglutinate chicken or sheep erythrocytes. twenty-three to 27 of the first 42 n-terminal amino acid residues of the metalloprotease are identical to proteases produced by serratia proteamaculans, pectobacterium carotovorum, and anabaena sp. pcr analysis using primers designed  from a consensus nucleotide sequence showed that 135 e. sakazakii strains possessed the metalloprotease gene, zpx, and 25 non-e. sakazakii strains did not. the cloned zpx gene of strain 29544 consists of 1,026 nucleotides, and the deduced amino acid sequence of the metalloprotease has 341 amino acid residues, which corresponds to a theoretical protein size of 37,782 with a theoretical pi of 5.23. the sequence possesses three well-characterized zinc-binding and active-site motifs present in other bacterial zinc metalloproteases.
