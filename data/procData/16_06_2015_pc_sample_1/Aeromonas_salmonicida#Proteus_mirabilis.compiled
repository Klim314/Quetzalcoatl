TI  - Degradation of propanil by bacterial isolates and mixed populations from a pristine lake.
AB  - The microbial transformation rates of propanil, a commonly used herbicide, were investigated using water from a pristine lake in northeast Georgia. Microbial degradation rates were measured using natural water microflora, the natural water microflora amended with five bacterial species (Aerobacter aerogenes, Aeromonas hydrophila, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Proteus mirabilis, and Aeromonas salmonicida) isolated from the same lake, and the five isolates individually. Transformation rate constants for propanil were compared for the mixed microbial assemblages and isolates at similar initial bacterial concentrations (approximately 5.0 x 10(-3) bacteria/mL). Degradation started within 60 hours and was completed by 160 hours in all experiments. The mean first-order rate constant for natural microflora was -(4.80 +/- 0.620) x 10(-3) h-1. Natural waters amended with the bacterial isolates yielded rate constants ranging from -(0.39 +/- 0.186) x 10(-3) h-1 to -(2.13 +/- 0.029) x 10(-3) h-1 with an overall mean of -(1.63 +/- 0.242) x 10(-3) h-1. After 660 hours following the first amendment of propanil, (i.e., 500 hours after propanil degradation was complete), each sample was again amended with propanil. Subsequent degradation rates ranged from -(21.3 +/- 0.186) x 10(-3) h-1 to -(64.2 +/- 0.786) x 10(-3) h-1 and the mean rate constant was -(37.5 +/- 0.922) x 10(-3) h-1. No significant differences were observed between first-order rate constants among isolates following the first or the second addition of propanil. After the second spike, however, the average of rate constants was approximately 20 times greater than that following the first spike. Rates for the individual isolates varied greatly from one isolate to another, ranging from virtually no degradation with A. calcoaceticus to -(21.6 +/- 0.332) x 10(-3) h-1 for the composite treatment of all isolates.
TI  - Freeze-substitution of gram-negative eubacteria: general cell morphology and envelope profiles.
AB  - Freeze-substitution was performed on strains of Escherichia coli, Pasteurella multocida, Campylobacter fetus, Vibrio cholerae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas putida, Aeromonas salmonicida, Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus pleuropneumoniae, Caulobacter crescentus, and Leptothrix discophora with a substitution medium composed of 2% osmium tetroxide and 2% uranyl acetate in anhydrous acetone. A thick periplasmic gel ranging from 10.6 to 14.3 nm in width was displayed in E. coli K-12, K30, and His 1 (a K-12 derivative containing the K30 capsule genes), P. multocida, C. fetus, P. putida, A. salmonicida, H. pleuropneumoniae, and P. mirabilis. The other bacteria possessed translucent periplasms in which a thinner peptidoglycan layer was seen. Capsular polysaccharide, evident as electron-dense fibers radiating outward perpendicular to the cell surface, was observed on E. coli K30 and His 1 and P. mirabilis cells. A more random arrangement of fibers forming a netlike structure was apparent surrounding cells of H. pleuropneumoniae. For the first time a capsule, distinct from the sheath, was observed on L. discophora. In all instances, capsular polysaccharide was visualized in the absence of stabilizing agents such as homologous antisera or ruthenium red. Other distinct envelope structures were observed external to the outer membrane including the sheath of L. discophora and the S layers of A. salmonicida A450 and C. crescentus CB15A. We believe that the freeze-substitution technique presents a more accurate image of the structural organization of these cells and that it has revealed complex ultrastructural relationships between cell envelope constituents previously difficult to visualize by more conventional means of preparation.
