TI  == production of a mixture of antimicrobial organic acids from lactose by co-culture of bifidobacterium longum and propionibacterium freudenreichii.
AB  == the antimicrobial activities of standard solutions of three organic acids (lactic, acetic, and propionic acids) were compared using micrococcus luteus, pseudomonas sp. and staphylococcus aureus as test microorganisms. at the same concentrations of the undissociated form, the antimicrobial activities of acetic  and propionic acids were higher than that of lactic acid, irrespective of test microorganisms. in a single cultivation of bifidobacterium longum, a mixture of lactic (17 g/l) and acetic (20 g/l) acids was produced from 50 g/l lactose and its antimicrobial activities against m. luteus, pseudomonas sp., and s. aureus correspond to that of 32, 19, and 25 g/l of acetic acid, respectively. to increase the total antimicrobial activity, a co-culture of b. longum and propionibacterium freudenreichii, in which lactic acid produced once from lactose by b. longum was converted to acetic and propionic acids by p. freudenreichii, was done using tpy medium containing commercially available peptones as a nitrogen source. by the sequential conversion of lactose using the two microorganisms, the culture supernatant containing a mixture of acetic (27 g/l) and propionic (13 g/l) acids without lactic acid was produced. the antimicrobial  activities of the mixture against m. luteus, pseudomonas sp., and s. aureus were  35, 30, and 26 g/l as a concentration of acetic acid, respectively, higher than that obtained in the cultivation of b. longum alone. when the medium containing an enzymatic hydrolyzate of whey proteins with a protease was used in the co-culture of b. longum and p. freudenreichii, the culture supernatant containing the mixture of organic acids was also obtained in the same manner as the co-culture using tpy medium and the activities were 43, 29, and 29 g/l as a concentration of acetic acid for m. luteus, pseudomonas sp. and s. aureus, respectively.

TI  == enhancement of lysozyme trypsin-mediated decay of intestinal bifidobacteria and lactobacilli.
AB  == lysozyme-mediated lysis of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli was studied in in vitro tests using the agar gel plate and turbidometric micrococcus luteus (lysodeikticus) procedure as a standard. suspensions of the strains bifidobacterium infantis, b. infantis liberorum, b. breve, b. longum, b. ssp, and lactobacillus acidophilus proved to be resistant to egg white lysozyme and human  milk lysozyme when incubated at 37 degrees c in concentrations of 5, 50, and 500  mg lysozyme/l, respectively, through 30 and 60 min. heat treatment at 100 degrees c for 1 h and pretreatment with ether, acetone, ascorbic acid, and hydrogen peroxide failed to incline the bacteria to the lytic effects of lysozyme. consecutive incubation of the lysozyme-pretreated bacteria with trypsin resulted  in a significantly enhanced bacteriolysis in all strains of bacteria, with the exception of b. longum. the mode of action of lysozyme and proteolytic enzymes on bifidobacteria and lactobacilli offers an explanation for the release of microbial building blocks and their colonic absorption and retention in the breast-fed baby.
