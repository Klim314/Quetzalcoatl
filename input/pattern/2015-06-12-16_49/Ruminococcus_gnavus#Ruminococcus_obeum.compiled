TI  - High temporal and inter-individual variation detected in the human ileal microbiota.
AB  - The diversity and temporal stability of the predominant bacteria in the human ileum was studied with the use of ileal effluent samples of seven individuals with Brooke ileostomies. The total number of bacteria within the ileal effluent was in the range of 10(7) -10(8) bacteria per gram (wet weight). The diversity of the bacteria in the ileal effluent showed marked differences compared with that in faecal samples from age-matched healthy adults. The ileal effluent had a higher relative abundance of species within the orders Lactobacillales and Clostridiales, mainly Streptococcus bovis-related species, and the Veillonella group, and a lower proportion of species related to Ruminococcus gnavus, R. obeum and Bacteroides plebeius. In addition, inter-individual differences were found, indicative of a highly personal ileal microbiota profile. Furthermore, temporal profiles showed large fluctuations per individual over a period of 9-28 days (average similarity over a period of 9 days was as low as 44%), and differences between morning and afternoon profiles were observed. Parallel cloning and sequencing efforts revealed several phylotypes that were not identified in previous studies (12 out of 65 phylotypes showed less than 97% sequence similarity with previously reported sequences). Achaea were found to be below detection limit by quantitative PCR. Overall, the results indicate that the microbiota of the human ileum is relatively unstable, less complex and consisting of different dominating phylotypes when compared with the colonic microbiota.
TI  - 16S rDNA sequencing of Ruminococcus albus and Ruminococcus flavefaciens: design of a signature probe and its application in adult sheep.
AB  - The ruminococci are an important group of fibrolytic bacteria inhabiting the rumen. Seventeen strains of presumptively identified Ruminococcus were evaluated by a combination of nearly complete and partial 16S rDNA sequence that identified all strains as either Ruminococcus albus or Ruminococcus flavefaciens. All sequences fell into cluster IV of the clostridia, while other species of ruminococci (e.g. Ruminococcus obeum, Ruminococcus gnavus, Ruminococcus lactaris) fall into cluster XIVa of the clostridia. Ruminococcus cluster IV sequences were used to design a 16S rRNA oligonucleotide probe to assess the relative abundance of target populations in a stable ruminal environment. A stable population (animals fed eight times per day) was established in sheep so that statistically robust comparisons could be made in the absence of variation due to diurnal rumen fluctuations. The steady state populations were sampled six times over a 24 d period and direct microscopic counts (DC), total culturable counts (TCC), and total cellulolytic counts (CEL) were determined. DC and culturable data (TCC and CEL) were compared with relative abundance estimates of Ruminococcus IV and Fibrobacter succinogenes. A combination of the Ruminococcus and F. succinogenes probes accounted for 4.0% of the bacterial population and cellulolytic bacteria (measured by most-probable numbers) were 5.2% of the total culturable count. These data suggest that a major portion of the Ruminococcus and Fibrobacter diversity has been cultured and is represented by available sequences. Steady state populations were measured over several days in three sheep and an estimate of variation in DC, TCC, CEL and 16S-based data were obtained. These variance estimates could be used to determine the theoretical sample sizes required to obtain statistically significant differences under different experimental conditions.
TI  - Phylogenetic analysis by 16S ribosomal DNA sequence comparison reveals two unrelated groups of species within the genus Ruminococcus.
AB  - Phylogenetic analysis of the genus Ruminococcus based on 16S rDNA sequence data showed the genus to be phylogenetically heterogenous. Ruminococcus species fall within the radiation of the Bacillus/Clostridium subphylum of the Gram-positive line of descent. Two distinct and unrelated clusters are recovered. One group contains R. flavefaciens, R. albus, R. bromii, and R. callidus. The second group constitutes R. gnavus, R. hansenii, R. lactaris, R. obeum, R. productus and R. torques which together with some Clostridium species may constitute a new genus.
