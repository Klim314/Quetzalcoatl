TI  - Molecular Detection of Fastidious and Common Bacteria as Well as Plasmodium spp.  in Febrile and Afebrile Children in Franceville, Gabon.
AB  - Malaria was considered as the main cause of fever in Africa. However, with the roll back malaria initiative, the causes of fever in Africa may change. This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of bacteria and Plasmodium spp. in febrile and afebrile (controls) children from Franceville, Gabon. About 793 blood samples from febrile children and 100 from controls were analyzed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) coupled with sequencing. Plasmodium spp. was the microorganism most detected in febrile (74.5%, 591/793) and controls (13%, 13/100), P < 0.0001. Its coinfection with bacteria was found only in febrile children (P = 0.0001). Staphylococcus aureus was the most prevalent bacterium in febrile children (2.8%, 22/793) and controls (3%, 3/100). Eight cases of Salmonella spp. (including two Salmonella enterica serovar Paratyphi) and two of Streptococcus pneumoniae were found only among febrile children. Borrelia spp. was found in 2 controls while Rickettsia felis was detected in 10 children (in 8 febriles and 2 afebriles). No DNA of other targeted microorganisms was detected. Plasmodium spp. remains prevalent while Salmonella spp., Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pneumoniae were common bacteria in Gabon. Two fastidious bacteria, Rickettsia felis and Borrelia spp., were found. Inclusion of controls should improve the understanding of the causes of fever in sub-Saharan Africa.
TI  - Potential probiotic attributes of a new strain of Bacillus coagulans CGMCC 9951 isolated from healthy piglet feces.
AB  - A new strain of Bacillus coagulans CGMCC 9551, which has a broad range of antibacterial activities against six main pathogenic bacteria including Escherichia coli O8, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar enteritidis, Streptococcus suis, Listeria monocytogenes and Pasteurella multocida, was isolated from healthy piglet feces. In adhesion assay, the isolate exhibited a stronger adhesion to pig intestinal mucus than that of B. subtilis JT143 and L. acidophilus LY24 respectively isolated from BioPlus((R))2B and FloraFIT((R)) Probiotics (P < 0.05). The adhesion activity reached 44.5 +/- 3.2, 48.9 +/- 2.6, 42.6 +/- 3.3 and 37.6 +/- 2.4 % to jejunum, ileum, transverse colon and sigmoid colon, separately. The survival rate of B. coagulans CGMCC 9551 was reduced by only 20 % at 4 h exposure under 0.9 % w/v bile salt. The strain was fully resistant to pH 2 for 2 h with 90.1 +/- 3.5 % survival and susceptible to 15 antibiotics commonly used in veterinary medicine. Additionally, the bacteria showed amylase, protease and cellulase activities. The safety assessment demonstrated the lack of toxicity potential in B. coagulans CGMCC 9551 by ligated rabbit ileal loop assay, acute and subchronic toxicity test. These results implied that that the new strain of B. coagulans CGMCC 9951 isolated from healthy piglet feces has promising probiotic characteristics and offers desirable opportunities for its successful commercialization as one excellent candidate probiotic.
TI  - Management of severe non-TB bacterial infection in HIV-infected adults.
AB  - Despite widespread antiretroviral therapy use, severe bacterial infections (SBI)  in HIV-infected adults continue to cause significant morbidity and mortality globally. Four main pathogens account for the majority of documented SBI: Streptococcus pneumoniae, non-typhoidal strains of Salmonella enterica, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. The epidemiology of SBI is dynamic, both in developing countries where, despite dramatic successes in antiretroviral therapy, coverage is far from complete, and in settings in both resource-poor and resource-rich countries where antiretroviral therapy failure is becoming increasingly common. Throughout the world, this complexity is further compounded by rapidly emerging antimicrobial resistance, making management of SBI very challenging in these vulnerable patients. We review the causes and treatment of SBI in HIV-infected people and discuss future developments in this field.
TI  - Preparation and testing of a Vi conjugate vaccine using pneumococcal surface protein A (PspA) from Streptococcus pneumoniae as the carrier protein.
AB  - In the current study pneumococcal surface protein A (PspA) was conjugated to Vi capsular polysaccharide from Salmonella Typhi to make available a vaccine against typhoid fever that has the potential to also provide broad protection from Streptococcus pneumoniae. High yielding production processes were developed for the purification of PspAs from families 1 and 2. The purified PspAs were conjugated to Vi with high recovery of both Vi and PspA. The processes developed especially for PspA family 2 could readily be adapted for large scale production under cGMP conditions. Previously we have shown that conjugation of diphtheria toxoid (DT) to Vi polysaccharide improves the immune response to Vi but can also enhance the response to DT. In this study it was shown that conjugation of PspA to Vi enhanced the anti-PspA response and that PspA was a suitable carrier protein as demonstrated by the characteristics of a T-cell dependent response to the Vi. We propose that a bivalent vaccine consisting of PspA from families 1 and 2 bound to Vi polysaccharide would protect against typhoid fever and has the potential to also protect against pneumococcal disease and should be considered for use in developing countries.
TI  - Activity of Kaempferia pandurata (Roxb.) rhizome ethanol extract against MRSA, MRCNS, MSSA, Bacillus subtilis and Salmonella typhi.
AB  - Temu kunci (Kaempferia pandurata (Roxb.)) has a number of benefits and one of these is antibacterial. The rhizome is said to have antibacterial activity against Streptococcus mutans, Lactocillus sp. and Candida albicans. The aim of the study is to test the antibacterial activity of Kaempferia pandurata (Roxb.) rhizome ethanol extract on methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), methicillin-resistant coagulase negative Staphylococci (MRCNS), methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), Bacillus subtilis and Salmonella typhi. Antimicrobial activity of the extract was assayed by the microdilution method using Mueller Hinton Broth with sterilized 96 round-bottomed microwells to determine the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) as well as to determine the time-kill activity. The MIC of the extract was 16 ppm for both Bacillus subtilis and MRSA; 8 ppm for both MSSA and Salmonella typhi and 4 ppm for MRCNS. Ethanol extract of Kaempferia pandurata (Roxb.) showed antibacterial activity against all the tested bacteria and was the most potent against MRCNS, with MIC 4 ppm. The killing profile test of the extract displayed bactericidal activity at 8-16 ppm against MRSA, MSSA, Bacillus subtilis and Salmonella typhi and bacteriostatic activity at 4 ppm towards MRCNS.
TI  - Synthesis, characterization, theoretical, anti-bacterial and molecular docking studies of quinoline based chalcones as a DNA gyrase inhibitor.
AB  - A series of fourteen (A1-A14) new qunioline based chalcones were synthesized by condensing 2,7-dichloro-8-methyl-3-formyl quinoline with acetophenone and acetylthiophenes, and subsequently characterized by IR, NMR and Mass spectroscopy. All the compounds were screened for antibacterial activities and found potentially active antibacterial agents. Bioassay, theoretical and dockings studies with DNA gyrase (the enzyme required for super coiling of DNA of bacteria) results showed that the type and positions of the substituents seemed to be critical for their antibacterial activities. The bromo and chloro substituted chalcone displayed high anti-bacterial activity. The A4 and A6 showed high interaction with DNA gyrase, contributing high free binding energy (DeltaG -8.18 and -8.88 kcal).
TI  - Safety and immunogenicity of an oral DNA vaccine encoding Sip of Streptococcus agalactiae from Nile tilapia Oreochromis niloticus delivered by live attenuated Salmonella typhimurium.
AB  - Attenuated Salmonella typhimurium SL7207 was used as a carrier for a reconstructed DNA vaccine against Streptococcus agalactiae. A 1.02 kb DNA fragment, encoding for a portion of the surface immunogenic protein (Sip) of S. agalactiae was inserted into pVAX1. The recombinant plasmid pVAX1-sip was transfected in EPC cells to detect the transient expression by an indirect immunofluorescence assay, together with Western blot analysis. The pVAX1-sip was transformed by electroporation into SL7207. The stability of pVAX1-sip into Salmonella was over 90% after 50 generations with antibiotic selection in vitro while remained stable over 80% during 35 generations under antibiotic-free conditions. The LD50 of SL/pVAX1-sip was 1.7 x 10(11) CFU/fish by intragastric administration which indicated a quite low virulence. Tilapias were inoculated orally at 10(8) CFU/fish, the recombinant bacteria were found present in intestinal tract, spleens and livers and eventually eliminated from the tissues 4 weeks after immunization. Fish immunized at 10(7), 10(8) and 10(9) CFU/fish with different immunization times caused various levels of serum antibody and an effective protection against lethal challenge with the wild-type strain S. agalactiae. Integration studies showed that the pVAX1-sip did not integrate with tilapia chromosomes. The DNA vaccine SL/pVAX1-sip was proved to be safe and effective in protecting tilapias against S. agalactiae infection.
TI  - Antimicrobial function of SHbetaAP, a novel hemoglobin beta chain-related antimicrobial peptide, isolated from the liver of skipjack tuna, Katsuwonus pelamis.
AB  - A 2.3 kDa of antimicrobial peptide was purified from an acidified liver extract of skipjack tuna, Katsuwonus pelamis, by preparative acid-urea-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and C18 reversed-phase HPLC. A comparison of the amino acid sequence of the purified peptide with those of other known polypeptides revealed high homology with the C-terminus of hemoglobin beta-chain; thus, this peptide was designated as the Skipjack Hemoglobin beta chain-related Antimicrobial Peptide (SHbetaAP). SHbetaAP showed potent antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria, such as Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus iniae (minimal effective concentrations [MECs], 6.5-57.0 mug/mL), Gram-negative bacteria, such as Escherichia coli D31, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enterica, Shigella sonnei, and two Vibrio parahaemolyticus species (MECs, 2.0-19.0 mug/mL), and against Candida albicans (MEC; 12.0 mug/mL) without significant hemolytic activity. Antimicrobial activity of this peptide was heatstable and pH resistant but is sensitive to proteases and salt. SHbetaAP did not show membrane permeabilization and killing ability. The secondary structural prediction and the homology modeling expected that this peptide formed an amphipathic alpha-helical structure. This is the first report the purification of a novel antimicrobial peptide related to the C-terminus of hemoglobin beta-chain from marine fish.
TI  - Eco-friendly synthesis and in vitro antibacterial activities of some novel chalcones.
AB  - Chalcone derivatives have been synthesized by reaction of 1-(2,5-dimethyl-furan-3-yl)-ethanone with corresponding active aldehyde in ethanolic NaOH in microwave oven. The structure of these compounds was established by elemental analysis, IR, 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, and EI-MS spectral analysis. The anti-bacterial activity of these compounds was first tested in vitro by the disc diffusion assay against two Gram-positive and two Gram-negative bacteria, and then the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined with the reference of standard drug Chloramphenicol. The results showed that pyrazol containing chalcone (compound 8) inhibited both types of bacteria (Gram-positive and Gram-negative) better than chloramphenicol.
TI  - Bacterial meningitis in Malawian infants <2 months of age: etiology and susceptibility to World Health Organization first-line antibiotics.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Neonatal meningitis is an important cause of morbidity in sub-Saharan Africa and requires urgent empiric treatment with parenteral administered antibiotics. Here we describe the etiology, antimicrobial susceptibility and suitability of the World Health Organization first-line recommended antibiotics (penicillin and gentamicin) for bacterial meningitis in young infants in Malawi. METHODS: We reviewed all cerebrospinal fluid samples received from infants </=2 months of age with clinically suspected meningitis between January 1, 2002, and December 31, 2008, at the Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital in Blantyre, Malawi. RESULTS: We identified 259 culture-positive isolates from 259 infants </=2 months of age. Sixty isolates were from neonates </=7 days old, in whom the most common pathogens were Group B Streptococcus (27/60; 45.0%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (13/60; 21.7%) and nontyphoidal Salmonella enterica (7/60; 11.7%). One hundred and ninety one isolates were from young infants who were >7 days and </=2 months of age. In this group, the most common isolates were S. pneumoniae (80/191; 41.9%), Group B Streptococcus (38/191; 19.9%) and nontyphoidal Salmonella enterica (34/191; 17.8%). More isolates were susceptible to ceftriaxone than to the combination of penicillin and gentamicin (218/220; 99.1% vs. 202/220; 91.8%, Fisher's exact test P = 0.006). In particular, Gram-negative isolates were significantly more susceptible to ceftriaxone than to gentamicin (72/74; 97.3% vs. 63/74; 85.1%, Fisher's exact test P = 0.020). Penicillin and gentamicin provided less coverage for Gram-negative than Gram-positive isolates (74/86; 86.0% vs. 155/163; 95.1%, chi = 6.24, P = 0.012). CONCLUSIONS: In view of these results, the World Health Organization recommendations for empiric penicillin and gentamicin for suspected neonatal meningitis should be reevaluated.
TI  - A new plant-derived antibacterial is an inhibitor of efflux pumps in Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - An in-depth evaluation was undertaken of a new antibacterial natural product (1)  recently isolated and characterised from the plant Hypericum olympicum L. cf. uniflorum. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined for a panel of bacteria, including: meticillin-resistant and -susceptible strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus; vancomycin-resistant and -susceptible Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium; penicillin-resistant and -susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae; group A streptococci (Streptococcus pyogenes); and Clostridium difficile. MICs were 2-8 mg/L for most staphylococci and all enterococci, but were >/=16 mg/L for S. haemolyticus and were >32 mg/L for all species in the presence of blood. Compound 1 was also tested against Gram-negative bacteria, including Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium but was inactive. The MIC for Mycobacterium bovis BCG was 60 mg/L, and compound 1 inhibited the ATP-dependent Mycobacterium tuberculosis MurE ligase [50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) = 75 muM]. In a radiometric accumulation assay with a strain of S. aureus overexpressing the NorA multidrug efflux pump, the presence of compound 1 increased accumulation of (14)C-enoxacin in a concentration-dependent manner, implying inhibition of efflux. Only moderate cytotoxicity was observed, with IC50 values of 12.5, 10.5 and 8.9 muM against human breast, lung and fibroblast cell lines, respectively, highlighting the potential value of this chemotype as a new antibacterial agent and efflux pump inhibitor.
TI  - Antipathogenic activity of probiotics against Salmonella Typhimurium and Clostridium difficile in anaerobic batch culture systems: is it due to synergies in probiotic mixtures or the specificity of single strains?
AB  - Probiotics are currently being investigated for prevention of infections caused by enteric pathogens. The aim of this in vitro study was to evaluate the influence of three single probiotics: Lactobacillus casei NCIMB 30185 (PXN 37), Lactobacillus acidophilus NCIMB 30184 (PXN 35), Bifidobacterium breve NCIMB 30180 (PXN 25) and a probiotic mixture containing the above strains plus twelve other strains belonging to the Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Lactococcus, Streptococcus and Bacillus genera on the survival of Salmonella Typhimurium and Clostridium difficile using pH-controlled anaerobic batch cultures containing mixed faecal bacteria. Changes in relevant bacterial groups and effects of probiotic addition on survival of the two pathogens were assessed over 24 h. Quantitative analysis of bacterial populations revealed that there was a significant increase in lactobacilli and/or bifidobacteria numbers, depending on probiotic addition, compared with the control (no added probiotic). There was also a significant reduction in S. Typhimurium and C. difficile numbers in the presence of certain probiotics compared with controls. Of the probiotic treatments, two single strains namely L. casei NCIMB 30185 (PXN 37), and B. breve NCIMB 30180 (PXN 25) were the most potent in reducing the numbers of S. Typhimurium and C. difficile. In addition, the supplementation with probiotics into the systems influenced some fermentations parameters. Acetate was found in the largest concentrations in all vessels and lactate and formate were generally detected in higher amounts in vessels with probiotic addition compared to controls.
TI  - A Phase I, dose-escalation trial in adults of three recombinant attenuated Salmonella Typhi vaccine vectors producing Streptococcus pneumoniae surface protein antigen PspA.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Live, attenuated, orally-administered Salmonella strains are excellent vectors for vaccine antigens and are attractive as vaccines based on previous use of S. Typhimurium in animals. A Phase I dose escalation trial was conducted to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of three newly constructed recombinant attenuated Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi vaccine (RASV) vectors synthesizing Streptococcus pneumoniae surface protein A (PspA). METHODS: The 3 S. Typhi strains used as vectors to deliver PspA were S. Typhi ISP1820; S. Typhi Ty2 RpoS(-); and S. Typhi Ty2 RpoS(+). Sixty healthy adults (median age 25.2 years) were enrolled into 4 Arms (total 15 subjects per Arm); within each Arm, subjects were randomized 1:1:1 into 3 Groups of 5. All subjects in the same Group received the same vaccine vector, and all subjects in the same Arm received the same titer of vaccine (10(7), 10(8), 10(9) or 10(10)CFU). Adverse events, safety, shedding, and IgG and IgA titers against Salmonella outer membrane proteins (OMPs), lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and PspA were evaluated. RESULTS: In the highest dose group, no subject experienced severe reactions or serious adverse events. Most adverse events were mild; one subject had a positive blood culture. No subject shed vaccine in stool. No statistically significant differences for post vaccination ELISA or ELISPOT results between Groups were detected. However, a limited number of >/= 4 fold increases from baseline for IgA anti-OMPs, IgA and IgG anti-LPS, and IgA anti-PspA occurred for a few individuals as measured by ELISA, and IgA anti-OMPs as measured by ELISPOT assay. CONCLUSIONS: All three S. Typhi vectored pneumococcal vaccines were safe and well-tolerated. Immunogenicity was limited possibly due to pre-existing high antibody titers prior to vaccination. Increases in IgA were most often observed.
TI  - On-chip microbial culture for the specific detection of very low levels of bacteria.
AB  - Microbial culture continues to be the most common protocol for bacterial detection and identification in medicine and agronomics. Using this process may take days to identify a specific pathogen for most bacterial strains. Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) detection is an emerging alternative technology that can be used for the detection of bacteria using protein microarrays although typical limits of detection are in the range of 10(3)-10(6) cfu mL(-1), which is not compatible with most Food Safety regulation requirements. In this work, we combine concomitant "on-chip" microbial culture with sensitive SPR detection of bacteria thus allowing rapid specific detection of bacteria pathogens - including Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Escherichia coli O157:H7 - cultured on a protein microarray. This Culture-Capture-Measure (CCM) approach significantly decreases both the number of processing steps and the overall assay time for bacterial detection. Signal analysis of SPR responses allowed the fast and quantitative assessment of bacterial concentrations initially present in the sample as low as 2.8 +/- 19.6 cfu per milliliter. Altogether, our results show how simple, easy-to-operate, fluidic-less and lo-tec microarrays can be used with unprocessed samples and yield - in a single assay - both qualitative and quantitative information regarding bacterial contamination.
TI  - Multiple antigen-presenting system (MAPS) to induce comprehensive B- and T-cell immunity.
AB  - Vaccines are among the most effective approaches to prevent and control many infectious diseases. Because of safety and reproducibility concerns, whole-cell vaccines (WCVs), made from live or killed microorganisms and including hundreds of antigenic components, have been mostly replaced by acellular or subunit vaccines composed of well-defined, purified antigen components. The efficacy of acellular vaccines is inferior to that of WCVs, however, for two major reasons: limited antigen diversity and reduced immunogenicity, especially in a lack of activation of antigen-specific T-cell immunity, which plays an important role in protection against mucosal and intracellular pathogens. Here we present the multiple antigen-presenting system (MAPS), which enables the creation of a macromolecular complex that mimics the properties of WCVs by integrating various antigen components, including polysaccharides and proteins, in the same construct and that induces multipronged immune responses, including antibody, Th1, and Th17 responses. Using antigens from various pathogens (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Salmonella typhi, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis), we demonstrate the versatility of the MAPS system and its feasibility for the design of unique defined-structure subunit vaccines to confer comprehensive protection via multiple immune mechanisms. Moreover, MAPS can serve as a tool for structure-activity analysis of cellular immunogens.
TI  - Computational analysis of bacterial RNA-Seq data.
AB  - Recent advances in high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) have enabled tremendous leaps forward in our understanding of bacterial transcriptomes. However, computational methods for analysis of bacterial transcriptome data have not kept pace with the large and growing data sets generated by RNA-seq technology. Here, we present new algorithms, specific to bacterial gene structures and transcriptomes, for analysis of RNA-seq data. The algorithms are implemented in an open source software system called Rockhopper that supports various stages of bacterial RNA-seq data analysis, including aligning sequencing reads to a genome, constructing transcriptome maps, quantifying transcript abundance, testing for differential gene expression, determining operon structures and visualizing results. We demonstrate the performance of Rockhopper using 2.1 billion sequenced reads from 75 RNA-seq experiments conducted with Escherichia coli, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Salmonella enterica, Streptococcus pyogenes and Xenorhabdus nematophila. We find that the transcriptome maps generated by our algorithms are highly accurate when compared with focused experimental data from E. coli and N. gonorrhoeae, and we validate our system's ability to identify novel small RNAs, operons and transcription start sites. Our results suggest that Rockhopper can be used for efficient and accurate analysis of bacterial RNA-seq data, and that it can aid with elucidation of bacterial transcriptomes.
TI  - Evaluation of regulated delayed attenuation strategies for Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi vaccine vectors in neonatal and infant mice.
AB  - We developed regulated delayed attenuation strategies for Salmonella vaccine vectors. In this study, we evaluated the combination of these strategies in recombinant attenuated Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium vaccine vectors with similar genetic backgrounds in vitro and in vivo. Our goal is to develop a vaccine to prevent Streptococcus pneumoniae infection in newborns; thus, all strains delivered a pneumococcal antigen PspA and the impact of maternal antibodies was evaluated. The results showed that all strains with the regulated delayed attenuated phenotype (RDAP) displayed an invasive ability stronger than that of the S. Typhi vaccine strain, Ty21a, but weaker than that of their corresponding wild-type parental strains. The survival curves of different RDAP vaccine vectors in vitro and in vivo exhibited diverse regulated delayed attenuation kinetics, which was different from S. Typhi Ty21a and the wild-type parental strains. Under the influence of maternal antibody, the persistence of the S. Typhimurium RDAP strain displayed a regulated delayed attenuation trend in nasal lymphoid tissue (NALT), lung, and Peyer's patches, while the persistence of S. Typhi RDAP strains followed the curve only in NALT. The bacterial loads of S. Typhi RDAP strains were lower in NALT, lung, and Peyer's patches in mice born to immune mothers than in those born to naive mothers. In accordance with these results, RDAP vaccine strains induced high titers of IgG antibodies against PspA and against Salmonella lipopolysaccharides. Immunization of mothers with S. Typhi RDAP strains enhanced the level of vaginal mucosal IgA, gamma interferon (IFN-gamma), and interleukin 4 (IL-4) and resulted in a higher level of protection against S. pneumoniae challenge.
TI  - A prospective study of the causes of febrile illness requiring hospitalization in children in Cambodia.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Febrile illnesses are pre-eminent contributors to morbidity and mortality among children in South-East Asia but the causes are poorly understood. We determined the causes of fever in children hospitalised in Siem Reap province, Cambodia. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A one-year prospective study of febrile children admitted to Angkor Hospital for Children, Siem Reap. Demographic, clinical, laboratory and outcome data were comprehensively analysed. Between October 12(th) 2009 and October 12(th) 2010 there were 1225 episodes of febrile illness in 1180 children. Median (IQR) age was 2.0 (0.8-6.4) years, with 850 (69%) episodes in children <5 years. Common microbiological diagnoses were dengue virus (16.2%), scrub typhus (7.8%), and Japanese encephalitis virus (5.8%). 76 (6.3%) episodes had culture-proven bloodstream infection, including Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (22 isolates, 1.8%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (13, 1.1%), Escherichia coli (8, 0.7%), Haemophilus influenzae (7, 0.6%), Staphylococcus aureus (6, 0.5%) and Burkholderia pseudomallei (6, 0.5%). There were 69 deaths (5.6%), including those due to clinically diagnosed pneumonia (19), dengue virus (5), and melioidosis (4). 10 of 69 (14.5%) deaths were associated with culture-proven bloodstream infection in logistic regression analyses (odds ratio for mortality 3.4, 95% CI 1.6-6.9). Antimicrobial resistance was prevalent, particularly in S. enterica Typhi, (where 90% of isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin, and 86% were multi-drug resistant). Comorbid undernutrition was present in 44% of episodes and a major risk factor for acute mortality (OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.1-4.2), as were HIV infection and cardiac disease. CONCLUSION: We identified a microbiological cause of fever in almost 50% of episodes in this large study of community-acquired febrile illness in hospitalized children in Cambodia. The range of pathogens, antimicrobial susceptibility, and co-morbidities associated with mortality described will be of use in the development of rational guidelines for infectious disease treatment and control in Cambodia and South-East Asia.
TI  - Development and application of a multiplex PCR assay for rapid detection of 4 major bacterial pathogens in ducks.
AB  - Infections with Pasteurella multocida, Salmonella enterica, Riemerella anatipestifer, and Escherichia coli result in high morbidity and mortality, which cause significant economic loss in the poultry industry. It can be difficult to distinguish these pathogens based on clinical signs because these pathogens can cause similar clinical signs and coinfections can occur. Thus, rapid and sensitive detection of these 4 major bacterial pathogens are important in ducks. The aim of this study was to develop a multiplex PCR (mPCR) assay for simultaneously detecting and identifying these 4 pathogenic bacteria in a single tube reaction. The target genes used were KMT1 of P. multocida, the invasion protein gene of S. enterica, 16S rDNA of R. anatipestifer, and the alkaline phosphatase gene of E. coli. The detection limit of the assay for all bacterial DNA was 10 pg. The mPCR did not produce any nonspecific amplification products when tested against other related pathogens, including Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Clostridium perfringens, Mycoplasma gallinarum, Mycoplasma synoviae, and Mycoplasma gallisepticum, which can also infect ducks. We applied mPCR to field samples, and the results were the same as the single PCR results. These results suggest that mPCR for the 4 bacteria is a useful and rapid technique to apply to field samples.
TI  - CD137 expressed on neutrophils plays dual roles in antibacterial responses against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial infections.
AB  - Severe sepsis and septic shock caused mainly by bacterial infections are life-threatening conditions that urge the development of novel therapies. However, host responses to and pathophysiology of sepsis have not been clearly understood, which remains a major obstacle for the development of effective therapeutics. Recently, we have shown that stimulation of a costimulatory molecule, CD137, enhanced survival of mice infected with the Gram-positive (G(+)) intracellular bacterium Listeria monocytogenes but decreased survival in a polymicrobial sepsis model. Herein, we report that CD137 deficiency or blocking of CD137 signaling decreased antibacterial responses of mice infected with G(+) bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Enterococcus faecalis) but increased these responses in mice infected with Gram-negative (G(-)) bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium). Consistent with these findings, stimulation of CD137 by administration of agonistic antibody enhanced responses against G(+) bacteria, whereas it decreased these responses against G(-) bacteria. Neutrophils were responsible for CD137-mediated opposite roles in control of G(+) and G(-) bacterial infections. Stimulation of CD137 enhanced activities of neutrophils against S. aureus but decreased these activities against E. coli, while CD137 blocking produced opposite results with the stimulation of CD137 in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, we found that combined signaling of CD137 and Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) induced synergistic production of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) by neutrophils, but combined signaling of CD137 and TLR4 did not. Our data strongly suggest that CD137 may play a dual role in sepsis in association with TLRs.
TI  - Synthesis and characterization of bactericidal silver nanoparticles using cultural filtrate of simulated microgravity grown Klebsiella pneumoniae.
AB  - Silver nanoparticles were synthesized by biological method using cultural filtrate of Klebsiella pneumoniae cultured under simulated microgravity and silver nitrate solution as precursor. The nanoparticles exhibited typical plasmon absorption maximum of silver nanoparticles between 405 and 407 nm. Spherical silver nanoparticles were found to have size between 15 and 37 nm by TEM analysis. XRD pattern corresponding to planes (111), (200), (220) (311) revealed the crystalline nature of the biosynthesized silver nanoparticles. FTIR spectrum proposed stabilization of silver nanoparticles by the protein molecules present in the cultural filtrate. The silver nanoparticles exhibited high bactericidal activity against Salmonella enterica, Escherichia coli and moderate bactericidal activity against Streptococcus pyogenes.
TI  - Facile water promoted synthesis of 1,2,3-triazolyl dihydropyrimidine-2-thione hybrids - highly potent antibacterial agents.
AB  - An elegant and efficient synthesis of hitherto novel 1,2,3-triazolyl dihydropyrimidine-2-thione hybrids has been accomplished for the first time in a green solvent viz. water. The hybrid molecules exhibit significant antibacterial activity when screened against four human pathogens viz. Streptococcus pneumonia, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella typhi. In comparison to the commercially marketed tetracycline, some of them were equally potent and a few more potent.
TI  - Bloodstream infection among children presenting to a general hospital outpatient  clinic in urban Nepal.
AB  - BACKGROUND: There are limited data on the etiology and characteristics of bloodstream infections in children presenting in hospital outpatient settings in South Asia. Previous studies in Nepal have highlighted the importance of murine typhus as a cause of febrile illness in adults and enteric fever as a leading bacterial cause of fever among children admitted to hospital. METHODS: We prospectively studied a total of 1084 febrile children aged between 2 months and 14 years presenting to a general hospital outpatient department in Kathmandu Valley, Nepal, over two study periods (summer and winter). Blood from all patients was tested by conventional culture and by real-time PCR for Rickettsia typhi. RESULTS: Putative etiological agents for fever were identified in 164 (15%) patients. Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S. Typhi) was identified in 107 (10%), S. enterica serovar Paratyphi A (S. Paratyphi) in 30 (3%), Streptococcus pneumoniae in 6 (0.6%), S. enterica serovar Typhimurium in 2 (0.2%), Haemophilus influenzae type b in 1 (0.1%), and Escherichia coli in 1 (0.1%) patient. S. Typhi was the most common organism isolated from blood during both summer and winter. Twenty-two (2%) patients were PCR positive for R. typhi. No significant demographic, clinical and laboratory features distinguished culture positive enteric fever and murine typhus. CONCLUSIONS: Salmonella infections are the leading cause of bloodstream infection among pediatric outpatients with fever in Kathmandu Valley. Extension of immunization programs against invasive bacterial disease to include the agents of enteric fever and pneumococcus could improve the health of children in Nepal.
TI  - Triterpene saponins of Maesa lanceolata stem wood.
AB  - Phytochemical analysis of aqueous MeOH extract of Maesa lanceolata stem wood has  led to the isolation of four new triterpene saponins characterized as 16alpha,21beta-diacetoxy-22alpha-angeloyl-28-hydroxyolean-12-ene 3-O-[alpha-rhamnopyranosyl-(1'''' --> 6''')-beta-glucopyranosyl-(1''' --> 3')][beta-glucopyranosyl-(1'' --> 2')]-beta-glucuronopyranoside (1), 16alpha-acetoxy-21beta-hydroxy-22alpha-angeloyl-13beta,28-oxydoolean-28alpha-ol 3-O-[alpha-rhamnopyranosyl-(1'''' --> 6''')-beta-glucopyranosyl-(1''' --> 4')][beta-glucopyranosyl-(1'' --> 2')]-alpha-arabinopyranoside (2), 16alpha-acetoxy-21beta,22alpha-diangeloyl-13beta,28-epoxyoleanane 3-O-[alpha-rhamnopyranosyl-(1'''' --> 6''')-beta-glucopyranosyl-(1''' --> 4')][beta-glucopyranosyl-(1'' --> 2')]-beta-xylopyranoside (3), and 16alpha,22alpha-diacetoxy-13beta,28-oxydoolean-28alpha-ol 3-O-[beta-glucopyranosyl-(1'' --> 2')][beta-glucopyranosyl-(1''' --> 3')]-beta-glucuronopyranoside (4), together with the known compounds beta-acetylamyrin, physcion, emodin, chrysophanol, ursolic acid, 16alpha-hydroxy-12-oleanene 3-O-glucoside, beta-amyrin, sitosterol 3-O-beta-glucoside, stigmasterol, and 3beta,28-dihydroxyolean-12-ene. Their structural elucidation was accomplished by homo- and heteronuclear 2D NMR technique as well as comparison with data from known compounds. The in vitro antibacterial activity of the aqueous MeOH extract was also investigated and zones of inhibition ranging from 32 +/- 1.1 to 14 +/- 0.2 mm were observed. Among the isolates, compound 1 was the most active with an minimum inhibitory concentration value of 25 mug/ml against Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Diverse phosphorylation patterns of B cell receptor-associated signaling in naive and memory human B cells revealed by phosphoflow, a powerful technique to study signaling at the single cell level.
AB  - Following interaction with cognate antigens, B cells undergo cell activation, proliferation, and differentiation. Ligation of the B cell receptor (BCR) leads to the phosphorylation of BCR-associated signaling proteins within minutes of antigen binding, a process with profound consequences for the fate of the cells and development of effector immunity. Phosphoflow allows a rapid evaluation of various signaling pathways in complex heterogenous cell subsets. This novel technique was used in combination with multi-chromatic flow cytometry (FC) and fluorescent-cell barcoding (FCB) to study phosphorylation of BCR-associated signaling pathways in naive and memory human B cell subsets. Proteins of the initiation (Syk), propagation (Btk, Akt), and integration (p38MAPK and Erk1/2) signaling units were studied. Switched memory (Sm) CD27+ and Sm CD27- phosphorylation patterns were similar when stimulated with anti-IgA or -IgG. In contrast, naive and unswitched memory (Um) cells showed significant differences following IgM stimulation. Enhanced phosphorylation of Syk was observed in Um cells, suggesting a lower activation threshold. This is likely the result of higher amounts of IgM on the cell surface, higher pan-Syk levels, and enhanced susceptibility to phosphatase inhibition. All other signaling proteins evaluated also showed some degree of enhanced phosphorylation in Um cells. Furthermore, both the phospholipase C-gamma2 (PLC-gamma2) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways were activated in Um cells, while only the PI3K pathway was activated on naive cells. Um cells were the only ones that activated signaling pathways when stimulated with fluorescently labeled S. Typhi and S. pneumoniae. Finally, simultaneous evaluation of signaling proteins at the single cell level (multiphosphorylated cells) revealed that interaction with gram positive and negative bacteria resulted in complex and diverse signaling patterns. Phosphoflow holds great potential to accelerate vaccine development by identifying signaling profiles in good/poor responders.
TI  - Characterization of lactic acid bacteria from naturally-fermented Manzanilla Alorena green table olives.
AB  - Manzanilla Alorena (or Alorena) table olives are naturally fermented traditional  green olives with a denomination of protection (DOP). The aim of this study was to search for lactic acid bacteria (LAB) with technological properties of interest for possible inclusion in a starter or protective culture preparation or also as probiotics. A collection of 144 LAB obtained from Alorena green table olives naturally-fermented by four small-medium enterprises (SMEs) from Malaga (Spain), including lactobacilli (81.94%), leuconostocs (10.42%) and pediococci (7.64%) were studied. REP-PCR clustering and further identification of strains by sequencing of phes and rpo genes revealed that all lactobacilli from the different SMEs were Lactobacillus pentosus. Pediococci were identified as Pediococcus parvulus (SME1) and leuconostocs as Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides (SME1 and SME4). Genotyping revealed that strains were not clonally related and exhibited a considerable degree of genomic diversity specially for lactobacilli and also for leuconostocs. Some strains exhibit useful technological properties such as production of antimicrobial substances active against pathogenic bacteria such as Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans and Salmonella enterica, utilization of raffinose and stachyose, production of bile salt hydrolase, phytase and haeme-dependent catalase activities, growth at 10 degrees C and in the presence of 6.5% NaCl, good acidifying capacity and also resistance to freezing. However, none of the isolates showed protease or amylase activity, and also did not exhibit biogenic amine production from histidine, ornithine, cysteine or tyrosine. On the basis of data obtained, selected strains with potential traits were tested for their survival at low pH and their tolerance to bile salts, and the survival capacity demonstrated by some of the analysed strains are encouraging to further study their potential as probiotics.
TI  - Antibacterial activity and dual mechanisms of peptide analog derived from cell-penetrating peptide against Salmonella typhimurium and Streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  - A number of research have proven that antimicrobial peptides are of greatest potential as a new class of antibiotics. Antimicrobial peptides and cell-penetrating peptides share some similar structure characteristics. In our study, a new peptide analog, APP (GLARALTRLLRQLTRQLTRA) from the cell-penetrating peptide ppTG20 (GLFRALLRLLRSLWRLLLRA), was identified simultaneously with the antibacterial mechanism of APP against Salmonella typhimurium and Streptococcus pyogenes. APP displayed potent antibacterial activity against Gram-negative and Gram-positive strains. The minimum inhibitory concentration was in the range of 2 to 4 muM. APP displayed higher cell selectivity (about 42-fold increase) as compared to the parent peptide for it decreased hemolytic activity and increased antimicrobial activity. The calcein leakage from egg yolk L-alpha-phosphatidylcholine (EYPC)/egg yolk L-alpha-phosphatidyl-DL-glycerol and EYPC/cholesterol vesicles demonstrated that APP exhibited high selectivity. The antibacterial mechanism analysis indicated that APP induced membrane permeabilization in a kinetic manner for membrane lesions allowing O-nitrophenyl-beta-D-galactoside uptake into cells and potassium release from APP-treated cells. Flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that APP induced bacterial live cell membrane damage. Circular dichroism, fluorescence spectra, and gel retardation analysis confirmed that APP interacted with DNA and intercalated into the DNA base pairs after penetrating the cell membrane. Cell cycle assay showed that APP affected DNA synthesis in the cell. Our results suggested that peptides derived from the cell-penetrating peptide have the potential for antimicrobial agent development, and APP exerts its antibacterial activity by damaging bacterial cell membranes and binding to bacterial DNA to inhibit cellular functions, ultimately leading to cell death.
TI  - The Asd(+)-DadB(+) dual-plasmid system offers a novel means to deliver multiple protective antigens by a recombinant attenuated Salmonella vaccine.
AB  - We developed means to deliver multiple heterologous antigens on dual plasmids with non-antibiotic-resistance markers in a single recombinant attenuated vaccine strain of Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium. The first component of this delivery system is a strain of S. Typhimurium carrying genomic deletions in alr, dadB, and asd, resulting in obligate requirements for diaminopimelic acid (DAP) and d-alanine for growth. The second component is the Asd(+)-DadB(+) plasmid pair carrying wild-type copies of asdA and dadB, respectively, to complement the mutations. To evaluate the protection efficacy of the dual-plasmid vaccine, S. Typhimurium strain chi9760 (a strain with multiple attenuating mutations: Deltaasd Deltaalr DeltadadB DeltarecF) was transformed with Asd(+) and DadB(+) plasmids specifying pneumococcal antigens PspA and PspC, respectively. Both plasmids were stable in chi9760 for 50 generations when grown in nonselective medium. This was significantly (P < 0.05) greater than the stability seen in its recF(+) counterpart chi9590 and could be attributed to reduced interplasmid recombination in chi9760. Oral immunization of BALB/c mice with 1 x 10(9) CFU of chi9760 (carrying Asd(+)-PspA and DadB(+)-PspC plasmids) elicited a dominant Th1-type serum IgG response against both antigens and protected mice against intraperitoneal challenge with 200 50% lethal doses (LD(50)s) of virulent Streptococcus pneumoniae strain WU2 or intravenous challenge with 100 LD(50)s of virulent S. pneumoniae strain L81905 or intranasal challenge with a lethal dose of S. pneumoniae A66.1 in a pneumonia model. Protection offered by chi9760 was superior to that offered by the mixture of two strains, chi9828 (Asd(+)-PspA) and chi11026 (DadB(+)-PspC). This novel dual-plasmid system marks a remarkable improvement in the development of live bacterial vaccines.
TI  - The antimicrobial effects of propolis collected in different regions in the Basque Country (Northern Spain).
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of 19 propolis extracts prepared in different solvents (ethanol and propylene glycol) (EEP/PEP), was evaluated against some bacterial and fungal isolates using the agar-well diffusion method. It was verified that all the samples tested showed antimicrobial activity, although results varied considerably between samples. Results revealed that both types of propolis extracts showed highly sensitive antimicrobial action against Gram-positive bacteria and fungi at a concentration of 20% (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans, Candida albicans and Saccharomyces cerevisae) with a minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) ranging from 0.5 to 1.5 mg/ml, with a moderate effect against Streptococcus pyogenes (MIC from 17 to 26 mg/ml). To our knowledge, this is the first study showing elevated antimicrobial activity against Gram-negative bacteria [Salmonella enterica (MIC from 0.6 to 1.4 mg/ml)] and lesser activity against Helicobacter pylori (MIC from 6 to 14 mg/ml), while Escherichia coli was resistant. This concluded that the Basque propolis had a strong and dose-dependent activity against most of the microbial strains tested, while database comparison revealed that phenolic substances were responsible for this inhibition, regardless of their geographical origin and the solvent employed for extraction. Statistical analysis showed no significant differences (P </= 0.05) between EEP and PEP extracts.
TI  - Antimicrobial and synergistic effects of silver nanoparticles synthesized using soil fungi of high altitudes of eastern himalaya.
AB  - Fifty three fungi isolated from soils of different microhabitats of eastern Himalayan range (3,400~3,600 msl) were screened for mycosynthesis of silver nanaoparticles (AgNPs) and their efficacy as antimicrobials were assessed in combination with commonly used antibiotics. Three isolates Aspergillus terreus SP5, Paecilomyces lilacinus SF1 and Fusarium sp. MP5 identified based on morphological and 18S rRNA gene sequences were found to synthesize AgNPs. These nanoparticles were characterized by visual observation followed by UV-visible spectrophotometric analysis. The AgNPs synthesized by Aspergillus terreus SP5, Paecilomyces lilacinus SF1 and Fusarium sp. MP5 showed absorbance maxima at 412, 419, and 421 nm respectively in the visible region. Transmission electron microscopy micrograph showed formation of spherical AgNPs of 5~50 nm size. The antimicrobial activity of the mycosynthesized nanoparticles were investigated alone and in combination with commonly used antibiotics for analysis of growth inhibition zone against test organisms, namely, Staphylococcus aureus MTCC96, Streptococcus pyogenes MTCC1925, Salmonella enterica MTCC735 and Enterococcus faecalis MTCC2729. The mycosynthesized nanoparticles showed potent antibacterial activity and interestingly their syngergistic effect with erythromycin, methicillin, chloramphenicol and ciprofloxacin was significantly higher as compared to inhibitions by AgNPs alone. The present study indicates that silver nanoparticles synthesized using soil borne indigenous fungus of high altitudes show considerable antimicrobial activity, deserving further investigation for potential applications.
TI  - Diversity and Biological Activities of Endophytic Fungi of Emblica officinalis, an Ethnomedicinal Plant of India.
AB  - In the present study, an attempt to evaluate the antimicrobial and antioxidant activity of fungal endophytes inhabiting Emblica officinalis has been made keeping in view the medicinal importance of the selected host plant in Indian traditional practices. A total of four endophytic fungi belonging to Phylum Ascomycetes were isolated from different parts of the plant which were characterized morphologically and by using rDNA-internal transcribed spacer. The most frequently isolated endophyte was Phomopsis sp. The antioxidant activity by 2, 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and reducing power assay, and total phenol were evaluated using ethanolic extract of endophytic fungi. DPPH activities in all the ethanolic extract increased with the increase in concentrations. Endophytes, Phomopsis sp. and Xylaria sp. showed highest antioxidant activity and also had the higher levels of phenolics. Antimicrobial activity of fungal extract were tested against four bacteria namely, Escherichia coli MTCC730, Enteroccocus faecalis MTCC2729, Salmonella enterica ser. paratyphi MTCC735 and Streptococcus pyogenes MTCC1925, and the fungus Candida albicans MTCC183. In general, the fungal extracts inhibited the growth of test organisms except E. coli.
TI  - Phosphate groups of lipid A are essential for Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium virulence and affect innate and adaptive immunity.
AB  - Lipid A is a key component of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria and stimulates proinflammatory responses via the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-MD2-CD14 pathway. Its endotoxic activity depends on the number and length of acyl chains and its phosphorylation state. In Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, removal of the secondary laurate or myristate chain in lipid A results in bacterial attenuation and growth defects in vitro. However, the roles of the two lipid A phosphate groups in bacterial virulence and immunogenicity remain unknown. Here, we used an S. Typhimurium msbB pagL pagP lpxR mutant, carrying penta-acylated lipid A, as the parent strain to construct a series of mutants synthesizing 1-dephosphorylated, 4'-dephosphorylated, or nonphosphorylated penta-acylated lipid A. Dephosphorylated mutants exhibited increased sensitivity to deoxycholate and showed increased resistance to polymyxin B. Removal of both phosphate groups severely attenuated the mutants when administered orally to BALB/c mice, but the mutants colonized the lymphatic tissues and were sufficiently immunogenic to protect the host from challenge with wild-type S. Typhimurium. Mice receiving S. Typhimurium with 1-dephosphorylated or nonphosphorylated penta-acylated lipid A exhibited reduced levels of cytokines. Attenuated and dephosphorylated Salmonella vaccines were able to induce adaptive immunity against heterologous (PspA of Streptococcus pneumoniae) and homologous antigens (lipopolysaccharide [LPS] and outer membrane proteins [OMPs]).
TI  - Sialidase specificity determined by chemoselective modification of complex sialylated glycans.
AB  - Sialidases hydrolytically remove sialic acids from sialylated glycoproteins and glycolipids. Sialidases are widely distributed in nature and sialidase-mediated desialylation is implicated in normal and pathological processes. However, mechanisms by which sialidases exert their biological effects remain obscure, in part because sialidase substrate preferences are poorly defined. Here we report the design and implementation of a sialidase substrate specificity assay based on chemoselective labeling of sialosides. We show that this assay identifies components of glycosylated substrates that contribute to sialidase specificity. We demonstrate that specificity of sialidases can depend on structure of the underlying glycan, a characteristic difficult to discern using typical sialidase assays. Moreover, we discovered that Streptococcus pneumoniae sialidase NanC strongly prefers sialosides containing the Neu5Ac form of sialic acid versus those that contain Neu5Gc. We propose using this approach to evaluate sialidase preferences for diverse potential substrates.
TI  - Community-acquired bacterial bloodstream infections in developing countries in south and southeast Asia: a systematic review.
AB  - Information about community-acquired bacteraemia in developing countries in south and southeast Asia is scarce. We aimed to establish the case fraction of bacteraemia in febrile patients admitted to hospital. We searched four databases and identified studies of south and southeast Asia published between 1990 and 2010 that prospectively assessed patients admitted to hospital and from whom a blood culture was taken. We reviewed 17 eligible studies describing 40,644 patients. Pathogenic organisms were isolated from 3506 patients (9%; range 1-51%); 1784 (12%) of 14,386 adults and 1722 (7%) of 26,258 children. Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi was the most common bacterial pathogen, accounting for 532 of 1798 (30%) isolates in adults and 432 of 1723 (25%) in children. Other commonly isolated organisms in adults were Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and other gram-negative organisms, and in children were Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. A substantial case fraction of bacteraemia occurs in patients admitted to hospital with fever in this region. Management could be improved if diagnostic microbiology facilities were more widely available. The prevailing organisms causing bacteraemia and their susceptibility patterns could inform empirical treatment regimens and prevention strategies.
TI  - Mitsuokella jalaludinii inhibits growth of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium.
AB  - Salmonella continues to be a significant human health threat, and the objective of this study was to identify microorganisms with the potential to improve porcine food-safety through their antagonism of Salmonella. Anaerobic culture supernatants of 973 bacterial isolates from the gastrointestinal tract and feces of swine were screened for their capacity to inhibit the growth of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. Growth inhibition of 1000-fold or greater was observed from 16 isolates, and 16S rRNA sequencing identified the isolates as members of the genera Mitsuokella, Escherichia/Shigella, Anaerovibrio, Selenomonas, and Streptococcus. Four isolates were identified as Mitsuokella jalaludinii, and the mechanism of Salmonella Typhimurium growth inhibition by M. jalaludinii was further investigated. M. jalaludinii stationary phase culture supernatants were observed to significantly inhibit growth, and featured the production of lactic, succinic, and acetic acids. Aerobic and anaerobic S. Typhimurium growth was restored when the pH of the culture supernatants (pH 4.6) was increased to pH 6.8. However, S. Typhimurium growth in fermentation acid-free media was the same at pH 4.6 and pH 6.8 - indicating a synergistic effect between fermentation acid production and low pH as the cause of S. Typhimurium growth inhibition. Furthermore, exposure of S. Typhimurium to M. jalaludinii culture supernatants inhibited Salmonella invasion of HEp-2 cells by 10-fold. The results identify M. jalaludinii as a possible inhibitor of Salmonella growth and invasion in swine, and thus a potential probiotic capable of improving food safety.
TI  - Essential oil composition, cytotoxic and antibacterial activities of five Etlingera species from Borneo.
AB  - Essential oils obtained by hydrodistillation from the rhizomes of Etlingera pyramidosphaera (K. Schum.) R. M. Sm, E. megalocheilos (Griff.) A.D. Poulsen, comb. nov., E. coccinea (Blume) S. Sakai & Nagam, E. elatior (Jack) R. M. Sm, and E. brevilabrum (Valeton) R. M. Sm were analyzed by GCMS. The highest oil yield was obtained from E. pyramidosphaera (0.45%), followed by E. elatior (0.38%), E. coccinea (0.30%), E. brevilabrum (0.28%) and E. megalocheilos (0.25%). The major constituents of the essential oils were oxygenated monoterpenes, followed by sesquiterpenes, oxygenated sesquiterpenes, oxygenated diterpenes and diterpenes. The essential oils from E. pyramidosphaera and E. brevilabrum exhibited the best cytotoxicity against MCF 7 (LC50: 7.5 +/- 0.5 mg mL(-1)) and HL 60 (LC50: 5.0 mg mL(-1)), respectively. Strong inhibition was also observed for the essential oils of E. coccinea and E. megalocheilos against Staphylococcus aureus (MIC: 8.0 +/- 0.5 mg mL(-1), and 5.0 +/- 0.5 mg mL(-1)) and Streptococcus pyrogenes (MIC: 6.0 +/- 0.5 mg mL(-1) and 8.0 +/- 0.5 mg mL(-1)).
TI  - A bivalent vaccine to protect against Streptococcus pneumoniae and Salmonella typhi.
AB  - Pneumococcal and Salmonella typhi infections are two major diseases for children  in developing countries. For typhoid fever, licensed Vi polysaccharide vaccines are ineffective in children <2-year old. While investigational Vi conjugate vaccines have been shown effective in clinical trials, they are currently only available to restricted areas. Pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide conjugate vaccines are highly effective in children, but suffer from some limitations including cost and limited serotype coverage. We have previously shown that a fusion conjugate vaccine, consisting of pneumococcal fusion protein PsaA and pneumolysoid (PdT) conjugated to a polysaccharide, results in enhanced antibody and CD4+ Th17 cell responses as well as protection against pneumococcal colonization and disease in mice. Here we applied this approach to develop a bivalent vaccine against pneumococcus and S. typhi. Two species-conserved pneumococcal antigens (SP1572 or SP2070) were fused to the nonhemolytic pneumolysoid PdT. SP1572-PdT was then conjugated to Vi polysaccharide and SP2070-PdT was conjugated to the pneumococcal cell wall polysaccharide (CWPS; also conserved). Mice immunized with this bivalent conjugate were protected against pneumococcal colonization and sepsis challenges, and made anti-Vi antibody concentrations higher by 40-fold compared to mice that received equimolar mixtures of the antigens. An enhanced killing of Vi-bearing Salmonellae in vitro was demonstrated from plasma of mice that received the fusion conjugate but not the mixture of antigens. Our results support further evaluation of this bivalent immunogen for the prevention of pneumococcal colonization and disease, and of typhoid fever.
TI  - Antimicrobial and Safety Properties of Lactobacilli Isolated from two Cameroonian Traditional Fermented Foods.
AB  - Twenty-one Lactobacillus isolates from "Sha'a" (a maize - based fermented beverage) and "Kossam" (traditionally fermented cow milk) were selected in accordance with their antagonistic activities and tested for their bacteriocinogenic potential as well as safety properties. These isolates were preliminarily identified as Lactobacillus plantarum (62%), Lactobacillus rhamnosus (24%), Lactobacillus fermentum (10%) and Lactobacillus coprophilus (4%) based on phenotypic characteristics and rep-PCR genomic fingerprinting. Twelve (57.1%) out of the 21 strains tested were found to be bacteriocin producers, as revealed by the sensitivity of their antimicrobial substances to proteolytic enzymes (Trypsin, Proteinase K) and inhibition of other Lactobacillus spp. These bacteriocinogenic strains showed no positive haemolytic and gelatinase activities and proved to be sensitive to penicillin G, ampicillin, tetracycline, erythromycin, amoxicillin, chloramphenicol, co-trimoxazole and doxycyclin, but resistant to ciprofloxacin and gentamicin. The bacteriocins showed a broad inhibitory activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria, several of which are classified as especially dangerous by the World Health Organization, as well as Multidrug-resistant strains. These include Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovare Typhi, Bacillus cereus, Streptococcus mutans, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Shigella flexneri. These Lactobacillus strains are promising candidates for use as protective cultures in food fermentation.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of clarithromycin loaded PLGA nanoparticles.
AB  - Novel drug delivery systems such as nanoparticles (NPs) have been proved to enhance the effectiveness of many drugs. Clarithromycin is a broad spectrum macrolide antibiotic, used in many infectious conditions like upper and lower respiratory tract infections, and skin and other soft tissue infections. This paper describes the preparation and enhanced in vitro antibacterial activities of clarithromycin loaded poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles. A modified quasi-emulsion solvent diffusion (MQESD) method was used to prepare clarithromycin (CLR) NPs. The antibacterial activity of the NPs was evaluated using the agar well diffusion method against Escherichia coli (PTCC 1330), Haemophilus influenzae (PTCC 1623), Salmonella typhi (PTCC 1609), Staphylococcus aureus (PTCC 1112) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (PTCC 1240). The inhibition zone diameters related to each nano formulation were compared with those for untreated CLR at the same concentrations. The results indicated that the mean inhibition zone diameters of NPs against all the bacteria tested were significantly higher than those of untreated CLR, particularly in the case of S. aureus. The increased potency of CLR NPs may be related to some physicochemical properties of NPs like modified surface characteristics, lower drug degradation, and increased drug adsorption and uptake.
TI  - Antibacterial potential of sponge endosymbiont marine Enterobacter sp at Kavaratti Island, Lakshadweep archipelago.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To isolate antibacterial potential of sponge endosymbiotic bacteria from marine sponges at Lakshadweep archipelago. Also to identify the potent bacteria by 16s rDNA sequencing and determine the antibacterial activity against clinical pathogens by MIC.

The crude extracts of potential bacteria LB3 was tested against clinical pathogens by MIC. The LB3 strain was identified by 16s rDNA sequencing, 1 111 bp was submitted in NCBI (HQ589912) and constructed phylogenetic tree. RESULTS: Sponge sample was identified as Dysidea granulosa (D. granulosa) and potential bacteria LB3 identified as Enterobacter sp TTAG. Preliminary screening of sponge isolates against clinical pathogens, LB3 strain was selected as potential producer of secondary metabolites and crude extract was implies on MIC of LB3 have confirmed with lowest concentration of 5.0 mg/mL in broth medium influence of crude extract on growth inhibitory activity after 5 h of incubation period and completed the inhibitory activity at 15 h. CONCLUSIONS: The present study concluded that phylogenetic analysis of endosymbiotic bacteria Enterobacter sp from sponge D. granulosa of Lakshadweep islands showed significant antibacterial activity against clinical bacterial pathogens.
TI  - Inhibition of bacterial carbonic anhydrases and zinc proteases: from orphan targets to innovative new antibiotic drugs.
AB  - Zinc-containing enzymes, such as carbonic anhydrases (CAs) and metalloproteases (MPs) play critical functions in bacteria, being involved in various steps of their life cycle, which are important for survival, colonization, acquisition of nutrients for growth and proliferation, facilitation of dissemination, invasion and pathogenicity. The development of resistance to many classes of clinically used antibiotics emphasizes the need of new antibacterial drug targets to be explored. There is a wealth of data regarding bacterial CAs and zinc MPs present in many pathogenic species, such as Neisseria spp., Helycobacter pylori Escherichia coli, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Brucella spp., Streptococcus pneumoniae, Salmonella enterica, Haemophilus influenzae, Listeria spp, Vibrio spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Legionella pneumophila, Streptomyces spp., Clostridium spp., Enterococcus spp., etc. Some of these enzymes have been cloned, purified and characterized by crystallographic techniques. However, for the moment, few potent and specific inhibitors for bacterial MPs have been reported except for Clostridium histolyticum collagenase, botulinum and tetanus neurotoxin and anthrax lethal factor, which will be reviewed in this article. Bacteria encode alpha-,beta-, and/or gamma-CA families, but up to now only the first two classes have been investigated in some detail in different species. The alpha-CAs from Neisseria spp. and H. pylori as well as the beta-class enzymes from E. coli, H. pylori, M. tuberculosis, Brucella spp., S. pneumoniae, S. enterica and H. influenzae have been cloned and characterized. The catalytic/inhibition mechanisms of these CAs are well understood as X-ray crystal structures are available for some of them, but no adducts of these enzymes with inhibitors have been characterized so far. In vitro and in vivo studies with various classes of inhibitors, such as anions, sulfonamides and sulfamates have been reported. Only for Neisseria spp., H. pylori, B. suis and S. pneumoniae CAs it has been possible to evidence inhibition of bacterial growth in vivo. Thus, bacterial CAs and MPs represent at this moment very promising targets for obtaining antibacterials devoid of the resistance problems of the clinically used such agents but further studies are needed to validate these and other less investigated enzymes as novel drug targets.
TI  - Palmitoylation state impacts induction of innate and acquired immunity by the Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium msbB mutant.
AB  - Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), composed of lipid A, core, and O-antigen, is a major virulence factor of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, with lipid A being a major stimulator to induce the proinflammatory response via the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-MD2-CD14 pathway. While Salmonella msbB mutants lacking the myristate chain in lipid A were investigated widely as an anticancer vaccine, inclusion of the msbB mutation in a Salmonella vaccine to deliver heterologous antigens has not yet been investigated. We introduced the msbB mutation alone or in combination with mutations in other lipid A acyl chain modification genes encoding PagL, PagP, and LpxR into wild-type S. enterica serovar Typhimurium. The msbB mutation reduced virulence, while the pagL, pagP, and lpxR mutations did not affect virulence in the msbB mutant background when administered orally to BALB/c mice. Also, all mutants exhibited sensitivity to polymyxin B but did not display sensitivity to deoxycholate. LPS derived from msbB mutants induced less inflammatory responses in human Mono Mac 6 and murine macrophage RAW264.7 cells in vitro. However, an msbB mutant did not decrease the induction of inflammatory responses in mice compared to the levels induced by the wild-type strain, whereas an msbB pagP mutant induced less inflammatory responses in vivo. The mutations were moved to an attenuated Salmonella vaccine strain to evaluate their effects on immunogenicity. Lipid A modification caused by the msbB mutation alone and in combination with pagL, pagP, and lpxR mutations led to higher IgA production in the vaginal tract but still retained the same IgG titer level in serum to PspA, a test antigen from Streptococcus pneumoniae, and to outer membrane proteins (OMPs) from Salmonella.
TI  - Rapid biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles from Bacillus megaterium (NCIM 2326) and their antibacterial activity on multi drug resistant clinical pathogens.
AB  - The notion to fight against multi drug resistant pathogens is a great deal in the field of nanomedicine. The identifiable antimicrobial action of metal bionanoparticles on many microorganisms is reported earlier. As silver bionanoparticles (Ag-BNPs) are known to have efficient antibacterial properties they are synthesized in ecofriendly and biocompatible way. The present study is focused on the extracellular biosynthesis of highly stable Ag-BNPs from bacterial strain Bacillus megaterium (NCIM 2326) by bio-reduction of silver ion using the culture supernatant, and to determine the antibacterial efficacy on multi drug resistant clinical pathogens such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and Salmonella typhi. The biosynthesis process is rapid and Ag-BNPs are formed within few minutes if AgNO(3) comes to contact with cell filtrate. Furthermore the synthesized Ag-BNPs are characterized by UV-vis spectroscopy, Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC) and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR).
TI  - Bacterial carbonic anhydrases as drug targets: toward novel antibiotics?
AB  - Carbonic anhydrases (CAs, EC 4.2.1.1) are metalloenzymes which catalyze the hydration of carbon dioxide to bicarbonate and protons. Many pathogenic bacteria encode such enzymes belonging to the alpha-, beta-, and/or gamma-CA families. In the last decade, the alpha-CAs from Neisseria spp. and Helicobacter pylori as well as the beta-class enzymes from Escherichia coli, H. pylori,Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Brucella spp., Streptococcus pneumoniae, Salmonella enterica, and Haemophilus influenzae have been cloned and characterized in detail. For some of these enzymes the X-ray crystal structures were determined, and in vitro and in vivo inhibition studies with various classes of inhibitors, such as anions, sulfonamides and sulfamates reported. Although efficient inhibitors have been reported for many such enzymes, only for Neisseria spp., H. pylori, B. suis, and S. pneumoniae enzymes it has been possible to evidence inhibition of bacterial growth in vivo. Thus, bacterial CAs represent promising targets for obtaining antibacterials devoid of the resistance problems of the clinically used such agents but further studies are needed to validate these and other less investigated enzymes as novel drug targets.
TI  - Effect of deletion of genes involved in lipopolysaccharide core and O-antigen synthesis on virulence and immunogenicity of Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium.
AB  - Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a major virulence factor of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium and is composed of lipid A, core oligosaccharide (C-OS), and O-antigen polysaccharide (O-PS). While the functions of the gene products involved in synthesis of core and O-antigen have been elucidated, the effect of removing O-antigen and core sugars on the virulence and immunogenicity of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium has not been systematically studied. We introduced nonpolar, defined deletion mutations in waaG (rfaG), waaI (rfaI), rfaH, waaJ (rfaJ), wbaP (rfbP), waaL (rfaL), or wzy (rfc) into wild-type S. Typhimurium. The LPS structure was confirmed, and a number of in vitro and in vivo properties of each mutant were analyzed. All mutants were significantly attenuated compared to the wild-type parent when administered orally to BALB/c mice and were less invasive in host tissues. Strains with DeltawaaG and DeltawaaI mutations, in particular, were deficient in colonization of Peyer's patches and liver. This deficiency could be partially overcome in the DeltawaaI mutant when it was administered intranasally. In the context of an attenuated vaccine strain delivering the pneumococcal antigen PspA, all of the mutations tested resulted in reduced immune responses against PspA and Salmonella antigens. Our results indicate that nonreversible truncation of the outer core is not a viable option for developing a live oral Salmonella vaccine, while a wzy mutant that retains one O-antigen unit is adequate for stimulating the optimal protective immunity to homologous or heterologous antigens by oral, intranasal, or intraperitoneal routes of administration.
TI  - Contribution of a Streptococcus mutans antigen expressed by a Salmonella vector vaccine in dendritic cell activation.
AB  - A Salmonella vector vaccine expressing the saliva-binding region (SBR) of the adhesin AgI/II of Streptococcus mutans has been shown to induce a mixed Th1/Th2 anti-SBR immune response in mice and to require Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), TLR4, and MyD88 signaling for the induction of mucosal anti-SBR antibody responses. Since dendritic cells (DC) are critical in innate and adaptive immunity, the present study assessed the role of SBR expression by the vector vaccine in DC activation. Bone marrow-derived DC from wild-type and TLR2, TLR4, and MyD88 knockout mice were stimulated with Salmonella vector BRD509, the SBR-expressing Salmonella vector vaccine BRD509(pSBRT7), or SBR protein, and the DC responses to different stimuli were compared by assessing costimulatory molecule expression, cytokine production, and signaling pathways. The DC response to both BRD509(pSBRT7) and BRD509 was dependent mainly on TLR4. BRD509(pSBRT7) and BRD509 induced upregulation of CD80, CD86, CD40, and major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC II) expression. Lower levels of interleukin-10 (IL-10) and IL-12p40 were produced by BRD509(pSBRT7)-stimulated DC than by BRD509-stimulated DC. Furthermore, BRD509(pSBRT7)-stimulated DC showed decreased p38 phosphorylation compared to that induced by DC stimulated with BRD509. However, BRD509(pSBRT7)-treated DC produced a higher level of IL-6 than BRD509-stimulated cells. The low IL-12p40 and high IL-6 cytokine profile expressed by BRD509(pSBRT7)-stimulated DC may represent a shift toward a Th2 response, as suggested by the increased expression in Jagged-1. These results provide novel evidence that a heterologous protein expressed by a Salmonella vector vaccine can differentially affect DC activation.
TI  - Susceptibility of bacterial isolates from community-acquired infections in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia to macrolide antibiotics.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the literature on the susceptibility of common community pathogens in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia to the macrolide antibiotics. METHODS: Inclusion criteria required that isolates were collected since 2004 to ensure results were of contemporary relevance. The data were aggregated by region, age group and sterility of site of culture sample. RESULTS: A total of 51 studies were identified, which reported the macrolide antimicrobial susceptibilities of common bacterial pathogens isolated since 2004. In general, there was less macrolide resistance in African than in Asian isolates. Most African studies reported high levels of macrolide susceptibility in Streptococcus pneumoniae, whereas most Chinese studies reported high levels of resistance. There was very little information available for Gram-negative organisms. CONCLUSIONS: Susceptibility of the pneumococcus to macrolides in SSA remains high in many areas, and good activity of azithromycin has been shown against Salmonellae spp. in Asia. In urban areas where high antibiotic consumption is prevalent, there was evidence of increased resistance to macrolides. However, there is no information on susceptibility from large areas in both continents.
TI  - Microbiological identification and analysis of swine tonsils collected from carcasses at slaughter.
AB  - The primary objective of this 7-month study was to determine the prevalence of porcine pathogens of the tonsil of the soft palate of swine at slaughter. Additional objectives were to determine if sampling the carcasses of normal or abnormal hogs provided different microbiological profiles and if the slaughter plant provides a feasible sampling frame and environment for detecting and monitoring important pathogens in tonsils that have health implications for both swine and humans. A total of 395 samples were collected from 264 farms. Of these, 180 tonsils were collected from normal carcasses and 215 tonsils were collected from carcasses that were diverted to the hold rail. Laboratory testing included bacteriological culture and identification as well as real time-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PPRSV) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) for porcine circovirus-2 (PCV-2). The most commonly isolated bacteria included: Streptococcus suis (53.7%), Arcanobacterium pyogenes (29.9%), Pasteurella multocida (27.3%), and Streptococcus porcinus (19.5%). Virus screening revealed evidence of PRRSV and PCV-2 in 22.0% and 11.9% of the samples, respectively. Salmonella Typhimurium and Yersinia enterocolitica were isolated in 0.5% and 1.8% of the samples, respectively. Tonsils collected from the hold rail were more likely to be positive for Staphylococcus hyicus [odds ratio (OR) = 7.51, confidence interval (CI) = 2.89 to 19.54], Streptococcus porcinus (OR = 9.93, CI = 4.27 to 23.10), and Streptococcus suis (OR = 2.16, CI = 1.45 to 3.24). Tonsils collected from abnormal carcasses were less likely to be positive for Staphylococcus aureus (OR = 0.05, CI = 0.005 to 0.482).
TI  - Salmonella synthesizing 1-dephosphorylated [corrected] lipopolysaccharide exhibits low endotoxic activity while retaining its immunogenicity.
AB  - The development of safe live, attenuated Salmonella vaccines may be facilitated by detoxification of its LPS. Recent characterization of the lipid A 1-phosphatase, LpxE, from Francisella tularensis allowed us to construct recombinant, plasmid-free strains of Salmonella that produce predominantly 1-dephosphorylated lipid A, similar to the adjuvant approved for human use. Complete lipid A 1-dephosphorylation was also confirmed under low pH, low Mg(2+) culture conditions, which induce lipid A modifications. LpxE expression in Salmonella reduced its virulence in mice by five orders of magnitude. Moreover, mice inoculated with these detoxified strains were protected against wild-type challenge. Candidate Salmonella vaccine strains synthesizing pneumococcal surface protein A (PspA) were also confirmed to possess nearly complete lipid A 1-dephosphorylation. After inoculation by the LpxE/PspA strains, mice produced robust levels of anti-PspA Abs and showed significantly improved survival against challenge with wild-type Streptococcus pneumoniae WU2 compared with vector-only-immunized mice, validating Salmonella synthesizing 1-dephosphorylated lipid A as an Ag-delivery system.
TI  - N-Benzyl-3-sulfonamidopyrrolidines are a New Class of Bacterial DNA Gyrase Inhibitors.
AB  - This paper characterizes N-benzyl-3-sulfonamidopyrrolidines (gyramides) as DNA gyrase inhibitors. Gyramide A was previously shown to exhibit antimicrobial activity that suggested it inhibited bacterial cell division. In this study, we conducted target identification studies and identified DNA gyrase as the primary target of gyramide A. The gyramide A resistance-determining region in DNA gyrase is adjacent to the DNA cleavage gate and is a new site for inhibitor design. We studied the antibiotic effects of gyramides A-C in combination with the Gram-negative efflux pump inhibitor MC-207,110 (60 muM). The gyramides had a minimum inhibitory concentration of 10-40 muM against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enterica, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pneumoniae; the compounds were ineffective against Enterococcus faecalis. The IC(50) of gyramides A-C against E. coli DNA gyrase was 0.7- 3.3 muM. The N-benzyl-3-sulfonamidopyrrolidines described in this manuscript represent a starting point for development of antibiotics that bind a new site in DNA gyrase.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of different honeys against pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - To study the antimicrobial activity of honey, 60 samples of various botanical origin were evaluated for their antimicrobial activities against 16 clinical pathogens and their respective reference strains. The microbiological quality of honeys and the antibiotic susceptibility of the various isolates were also examined. The bioassay applied for determining the antimicrobial effect employs the well-agar diffusion method and the estimation of minimum active dilution which produces a 1mm diameter inhibition zone. All honey samples, despite their origin (coniferous, citrus, thyme or polyfloral), showed antibacterial activity against the pathogenic and their respective reference strains at variable levels. Coniferous and thyme honeys showed the highest activity with an average minimum dilution of 17.4 and 19.2% (w/v) followed by citrus and polyfloral honeys with 20.8 and 23.8% respectively. Clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus subsp. aureus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica subsp. Enterica, Streptococcus pyogenes, Bacillus cereus and Bacillus subtilis were proven to be up to 60% more resistant than their equal reference strains thus emphasizing the variability in the antibacterial effect of honey and the need for further research.
TI  - Antibacterial activity in spices and local medicinal plants against clinical isolates of Karachi, Pakistan.
AB  - CONTEXT: Development of resistance in human pathogens against conventional antibiotic necessitates searching indigenous medicinal plants having antibacterial property. Twenty-seven medicinal plants used actively in folklore, ayurvedic and traditional system of medicine were selected for the evaluation of their antimicrobial activity for this study. Eleven plants chosen from these 27 are used as spices in local cuisine. OBJECTIVE: Evaluation of the effectiveness of some medicinal plant extracts against clinical isolates. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Nonedible plant parts were extracted with methanol and evaporated in vacuo to obtain residue. Powdered edible parts were boiled three times and cooled in sterile distilled water for 2 min each and filtrate collected. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of plant extracts and filtrates/antibiotics was evaluated against clinical isolates by microbroth dilution method. RESULTS: Water extract of Syzygium aromaticum L. (Myrtaceae) buds, methanol extracts of Ficus carica L. (Moraceae) and Olea europaea L. (Oleaceae) leaves and Peganum harmala L. (Nitrariaceae) seeds had MIC ranges of 31.25-250 microg/ml. S. aromaticum inhibited growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. F. carica and O. europaea inhibited growth of S. aureus, S. epidermidis, and S. pyogenes whereas P. harmala was effective against S. aureus, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and Candida albicans. Ampicillin, velosef, sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline and ceftazidime, cefotaxime, cefepime, which are used as control, had MIC >/= 50 and 1.5 microg/ml, respectively, for organisms sensitive to extracts. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Mono/multiextract from identified plants will provide an array of safe antimicrobial agents to control infections by drug-resistant bacteria.
TI  - Ultra-fast and sensitive detection of non-typhoidal Salmonella using microwave-accelerated metal-enhanced fluorescence ("MAMEF").
AB  - Certain serovars of Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica cause invasive disease (e.g., enteric fever, bacteremia, septicemia, meningitis, etc.) in humans and constitute a global public health problem. A rapid, sensitive diagnostic test is needed to allow prompt initiation of therapy in individual patients and for measuring disease burden at the population level. An innovative and promising new rapid diagnostic technique is microwave-accelerated metal-enhanced fluorescence (MAMEF). We have adapted this assay platform to detect the chromosomal oriC locus common to all Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovars. We have shown efficient lysis of biologically relevant concentrations of Salmonella spp. suspended in bacteriological media using microwave-induced lysis. Following lysis and DNA release, as little as 1 CFU of Salmonella in 1 ml of medium can be detected in <30 seconds. Furthermore the assay is sensitive and specific: it can detect oriC from Salmonella serovars Typhi, Paratyphi A, Paratyphi B, Paratyphi C, Typhimurium, Enteritidis and Choleraesuis but does not detect Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae or Acinetobacter baumanii. We have also performed preliminary experiments using a synthetic Salmonella oriC oligonucleotide suspended in whole human blood and observed rapid detection when the sample was diluted 1:1 with PBS. These pre-clinical data encourage progress to the next step to detect Salmonella in blood (and other ordinarily sterile, clinically relevant body fluids).
TI  - Invasive bacterial and fungal infections among hospitalized HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected children and infants in northern Tanzania.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the contribution of paediatric HIV and of HIV co-infections to admissions to a hospital in Moshi, Tanzania, using contemporary laboratory methods. METHODS: During 1 year, we enrolled consecutively admitted patients aged >/=2 months and <13 years with current or recent fever. All patients underwent standardized clinical history taking, a physical examination and HIV antibody testing; standard aerobic blood cultures and malaria film were also done, and hospital outcome was recorded. Early infant HIV diagnosis by HIV-1 RNA PCR was performed on those aged <18 months. HIV-infected patients also received serum cryptococcal antigen testing and had their CD4-positive T-lymphocyte count and percent determined. RESULTS: A total of 467 patients were enrolled whose median age was 2 years (range 2 months-13 years); Of those patients, 57.2% were female and 12.2% were HIV-infected. Admission clinical diagnosis of HIV disease was made in 10.7% and of malaria in 60.4%. Of blood cultures, 5.8% grew pathogens; of these 25.9% were Salmonella enterica (including 6 Salmonella Typhi) and 22.2%Streptococcus pneumoniae. Plasmodium falciparum was identified on blood film of 1.3%. HIV infection was associated with S. pneumoniae (odds ratio 25.7, 95% CI 2.8, 234.0) bloodstream infection (BSI), but there was no evidence of an association with Escherichia coli or P. falciparum; Salmonella Typhi BSI occurred only among HIV-uninfected participants. The sensitivity and specificity of an admission clinical diagnosis of malaria were 100% and 40.3%; and for an admission diagnosis of bloodstream infection, they were 9.1% and 86.4%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Streptococcus pneumoniae is a leading cause of bloodstream infection among paediatric admissions in Tanzania and is closely associated with HIV infection. Malaria was over-diagnosed clinically, whereas invasive bacterial disease was underestimated. HIV and HIV co-infections contribute to a substantial proportion of paediatric febrile admissions, underscoring the value of routine HIV testing.
TI  - High burden of antimicrobial resistance in Asia.
AB  - Antimicrobial resistance is associated with high mortality rates and high medical costs. Marked variations in the resistance profiles of bacterial and fungal pathogens as well as the quality of public hygiene have had a considerable impact on the effectiveness of antimicrobial agents in Asian countries. In Asia, one of the epicentres of antimicrobial drug resistance, there is an alarming number of antibiotic-resistant species, including penicillin- and erythromycin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae, multidrug-resistant (MDR) Acinetobacter baumannii, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (particularly mediated by CTX-M-9, CTX-M-14 and CTX-M-15), New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase 1 (NDM-1)-producing Enterobacteriaceae, MDR Salmonella enterica serotypes Choleraesuis and Typhi, carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii (OXA-58 and OXA-23 carbapenemases) and azole-resistant Candida glabrata. A few clones of MDR A. baumannii and hospital-acquired meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) have been widely disseminated in hospital settings in Asia, and K. pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing K. pneumoniae strains have been widely distributed in China. In addition, the emergence of extensively drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (XDR-TB) has illustrated the need for regular monitoring of resistance profiles of clinical isolates as well as the deliberative use of fluoroquinolones. Continuous surveillance of resistance data from clinical isolates as well as implementation of strict infection control policies in healthcare settings are required to mitigate the progression of antimicrobial resistance.
TI  - The airway antigen sampling system: respiratory M cells as an alternative gateway for inhaled antigens.
AB  - In this study, we demonstrated a new airway Ag sampling site by analyzing tissue  sections of the murine nasal passages. We revealed the presence of respiratory M cells, which had the ability to take up OVA and recombinant Salmonella typhimurium expressing GFP, in the turbinates covered with single-layer epithelium. These M cells were also capable of taking up respiratory pathogen group A Streptococcus after nasal challenge. Inhibitor of DNA binding/differentiation 2 (Id2)-deficient mice, which are deficient in lymphoid tissues, including nasopharynx-associated lymphoid tissue, had a similar frequency of M cell clusters in their nasal epithelia to that of their littermates, Id2(+/-) mice. The titers of Ag-specific Abs were as high in Id2(-/-) mice as in Id2(+/-) mice after nasal immunization with recombinant Salmonella-ToxC or group A Streptococcus, indicating that respiratory M cells were capable of sampling inhaled bacterial Ag to initiate an Ag-specific immune response. Taken together, these findings suggest that respiratory M cells act as a nasopharynx-associated lymphoid tissue-independent alternative gateway for Ag sampling and subsequent induction of Ag-specific immune responses in the upper respiratory tract.
TI  - Detection of Salmonella typhi agglutinins in sera of patients with other febrile  illnesses and healthy individuals.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Widal test is frequently applied for the detection of Salmonella agglutinins to diagnose Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi infection. There are however a number of controversies challenging the diagnostic utility of this test. This study was performed to determine the prevalence of Salmonella agglutinins in patients with other febrile illnesses and healthy blood donors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sera from 50 healthy blood donors were compared for the presence of Salmonella agglutinins in various groups of patients with other febrile illnesses using Widal test in the division of Serology and Immunology at King Khalid University Hospital, Riyadh. The patient groups of other febrile illnesses included infections with Beta-hemolytic streptococcus (n = 50), Brucella (n = 46), Helicobacter pylori (n = 24), Treponema pallidum (n = 30), Toxoplasma (n = 44), and other parasites (n = 20). RESULTS: Majority of the patients and normal individuals were tested positive for Widal test at dilution of less than 1 : 40 both for the O (62.5%) and H (64.6%) antigen. A decreasing trend in Widal reactivity was observed with increasing dilutions of the serum samples. At 1 : 160 titer, which is generally considered as a cut off point for positive Widal test, 6.4 and 11% individuals had positive Widal test for O and H Salmonella antigens, respectively. CONCLUSION: Detection of a significant number of positive Widal tests in conditions where it is expected to be nonreactive appears to be a serious problem in making a correct diagnosis of typhoid fever, thus challenging the diagnostic utility of the Widal test.
TI  - Bacillus spp. of human origin: a potential siderophoregenic probiotic bacteria.
AB  - Bacillus spp. ST13, isolated from human stool, was evaluated for siderophoregenic and probiotic qualities prior to its possible application for iron nutrition in humans and animals. It was tested for siderophore production in iron-limiting conditions and found to produce catecholate type of siderophore on the basis of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), FT-IR, NMR, and mass spectra analysis. The isolate was screened for probiotic properties as per WHO and FAO guidelines. The strain ST13 can survive stomach acidity, bile salt and partially simulated gastrointestinal tract conditions. It was susceptible to most of the antibiotic tested and showed antimicrobial activity against enteric pathogens like Salmonella typhimurium, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus. Strain ST13 showed close similarity with Bacillus subtilis using 16S r-RNA gene sequence analysis and biochemical characterization. The methanolic extract of ST13 siderophore was evaluated for DPPH radical scavenging activity, which showed 94.55 +/- 0.9% of radical scavenging effect.
TI  - Identification of bacterial DNA in noninfectious pleural fluid with a highly sensitive PCR method.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial DNA due to bacterial translocation has been identified in noninfectious ascitic fluid samples. OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the possible presence of bacterial DNA in the pleural fluid of patients with pleural effusions of noninfectious origin, using a highly sensitive PCR-based method. METHODS: Pleural fluid samples from 175 patients (average age +/- SD: 69 +/- 14 years) with noninfectious pleural effusion (62 transudates, 113 exudates) were analyzed. Bacterial DNA was detected using nested PCR with amplification of a fragment of the gene r16S, with 2 amplification protocols, i.e. low sensitivity (10 and 40 cycles) and high sensitivity (40 and 40 cycles). RESULTS: With the less sensitive amplification process, only 1 sample was positive (Haemophilus parainfluenzae in a patient with hepatic hydrothorax). With the highly sensitive nested PCR method, bacterial DNA was identified in the pleural fluid, of both transudative and exudative origin, of 75 of the 175 patients (43%). In cases of isolation of a single bacterium, the more frequent were Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica and Streptococcus pneumoniae. CONCLUSIONS: Regardless of its origin, bacterial DNA can be identified in almost half of noninfectious pleural effusions by using a highly sensitive PCR-based method. The possible clinical significance or prognostic value of these findings deserves to be evaluated.
TI  - Facile synthesis and antibacterial activity of naturally occurring 5-methoxyfuroflavone.
AB  - A convenient synthesis of 5-methoxyfuroflavone (6, pongaglabol methyl ether), a constituent of some Pongamia or Millettia genus, was achieved by starting from 2,4-dihydroxy-6-methoxyacetophenone via a chalcone precursor, followed by treatment with 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-1,4-benzoquinone (DDQ). This five-step reaction (total yield: 21.6%) is more facile with that of previously utilized procedures using each different starting material. Antibacterial activities of the above compound and its precursor chalcones, which also belongs to the class of furoflavonoids, were tested by the disc diffusion method against Shigella dysenteriae, Salmonella typhi, Streptococcus-beta-haemolyticus, and Staphylococcus aureus. 5-Methoxyfuroflavone showed moderate bactericidal activity against all tested bacterial strains, whereas its corresponding chalcone compound revealed a selective activity.
TI  - The burden of vaccine-preventable invasive bacterial infections and pneumonia in  children admitted to hospital in urban Nepal.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Protein-polysaccharide vaccines have made a significant impact on the burden of disease caused by encapsulated bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis, and have the potential to do so for Salmonella Typhi. Nepal is one of many resource-poor nations with limited information on the epidemiology of childhood infections caused by these pathogens. METHODS: Over a 21-month period, we studied children aged </=12 years admitted to an urban hospital in Nepal with suspected bacteremia, meningitis, or pneumonia. Patan Hospital is a non-profit hospital with the second largest pediatric unit in the Kathmandu Valley. RESULTS: Of 2039 children enrolled in the study, 142 (7.5%) included in the analysis had positive blood cultures. The agents of enteric fever, Salmonella Typhi and Salmonella Paratyphi, accounted for 59/142 (42%) of all bacteremias and were the most frequently cultured pathogens in children >/=1 year of age. S. pneumoniae was isolated in 16% of positive blood cultures and was the most common cause of bacteremia in children <1 year of age. Pneumonia accounted for 51% of admissions in children >/=2 months, with 44% of these children having radiographically defined primary endpoint pneumonia. S. pneumoniae was the most commonly identified pathogen in cases of pneumonia and meningitis. The S. pneumoniae serotype distribution indicated that the 10-valent and 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccines would cover 44% and 47%, respectively, of all S. pneumoniae cultured from blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) isolates and 62% and 67%, respectively, of isolates associated with pneumonia. H. influenzae type b was isolated infrequently from blood or CSF cultures, but is likely to be more important as a cause of pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS: The data on the burden of invasive bacterial infections and pneumonia from this study suggest that vaccines in development against Salmonella Typhi and the pneumococcus have the potential to significantly improve the health of children in Nepal.
TI  - Immunization with Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium-derived outer membrane  vesicles delivering the pneumococcal protein PspA confers protection against challenge with Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - Gram-negative bacteria produce outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) that serve a variety of functions related to survival and pathogenicity. Periplasmic and outer membrane proteins are naturally captured during vesicle formation. This property has been exploited as a method to derive immunogenic vesicle preparations for use as vaccines. In this work, we constructed a Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium strain that synthesized a derivative of the pneumococcal protein PspA engineered to be secreted into the periplasmic space. Vesicles isolated from this strain contained PspA in the lumen. Mice intranasally immunized with the vesicle preparation developed serum antibody responses against vesicle components that included PspA and Salmonella-derived lipopolysaccharide and outer membrane proteins, while no detectable responses developed in mice immunized with an equivalent dose of purified PspA. Mucosal IgA responses developed against the Salmonella components, while the response to PspA was less apparent in most mice. Mice immunized with the vesicle preparation were completely protected against a 10x 50% lethal dose (LD(5)(0)) challenge of Streptococcus pneumoniae and significantly protected against a 200x LD(5)(0) challenge, while control mice immunized with purified PspA or empty vesicles were not protected. These results establish that vesicles can be used to mucosally deliver an antigen from a Gram-positive organism and induce a protective immune response.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of traditional medicinal plants used by Haudenosaunee peoples of New York State.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The evolution and spread of antibiotic resistance, as well as the evolution of new strains of disease causing agents, is of great concern to the global health community. Our ability to effectively treat disease is dependent on the development of new pharmaceuticals, and one potential source of novel drugs is traditional medicine. This study explores the antibacterial properties of plants used in Haudenosaunee traditional medicine. We tested the hypothesis that extracts from Haudenosaunee medicinal plants used to treat symptoms often caused by bacterial infection would show antibacterial properties in laboratory assays, and that these extracts would be more effective against moderately virulent bacteria than less virulent bacteria. METHODS: After identification and harvesting, a total of 57 different aqueous extractions were made from 15 plant species. Nine plant species were used in Haudenosaunee medicines and six plant species, of which three are native to the region and three are introduced, were not used in traditional medicine. Antibacterial activity against mostly avirulent (Escherichia coli, Streptococcus lactis) and moderately virulent (Salmonella typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus) microbes was inferred through replicate disc diffusion assays; and observed and statistically predicted MIC values were determined through replicate serial dilution assays. RESULTS: Although there was not complete concordance between the traditional use of Haudenosaunee medicinal plants and antibacterial activity, our data support the hypothesis that the selection and use of these plants to treat disease was not random. In particular, four plant species exhibited antimicrobial properties as expected (Achillea millefolium, Ipomoea pandurata, Hieracium pilosella, and Solidago canadensis), with particularly strong effectiveness against S. typhimurium. In addition, extractions from two of the introduced species (Hesperis matronalis and Rosa multiflora) were effective against this pathogen. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that further screening of plants used in traditional Haudenosaunee medicine is warranted, and we put forward several species for further investigation of activity against S. typhimurium (A. millefolium, H. matronalis, I. pandurata, H. pilosella, R. multiflora, S. canadensis).
TI  - A report from the 20th European Congress of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious  Diseases (April 10-13, 2010 - Vienna, Austria).
AB  - Effective antimicrobials currently in use in Europe and throughout the world are  fast losing ground as many pathogens acquire resistance to newly introduced drugs. Multidrug and panresistance have now been identified in many pathogens, as iteratively discussed throughout this year's meeting of the European Congress of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ECCMID). As extensively discussed in an oral session entitled Worldwide Dissemination of Resistances by 10 specialists from across Europe and the world, important drug resistances have now been identified in Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella enterica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumanii and virtually all known pathogens (Roede, B.M. et al., Abst O127; Huenger, F. et al., Abst O395; Mera, R.M. et al., Abst O483). While many other issues were discussed, including the role of healthcare professionals and of hand hygiene in controlling the spread of infections (Derde, L. et al., Abst O464), microbial resistance was indeed the main topic of discussion in the many oral and poster presentations at the Austria Center in Vienna. The war against the superbugs has been declared and initiatives have been taken for tracking and destroying difficult to treat pathogens. Treatments of the diseases caused by these multidrug- and panresistant organisms continue, as manifested by new research and population surveys. However, with antimicrobial resistances as leitmotiv background music, other very recent scientific achievements and findings in diagnostics and treatment for infectious diseases took center stage in Vienna, including important information on novel drugs for infectious diseases and the use and comparative effectiveness of extant drugs, as summarized in the following report.
TI  - A low-cost approach to measure the burden of vaccine preventable diseases in urban areas.
AB  - We piloted a low-cost approach to measure the disease burden of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Hib and Salmonella Typhi by leveraging the existing infrastructure of high performing microbiology laboratories at two large paediatric hospitals in Dhaka Bangladesh, and assessing the hospital utilization of the catchment population of these hospitals for different syndromes. S. Typhi was the most common bacterium identified in culture and accounted for an estimated 211 hospitalizations per 100,000 children <5 years of age per year. Meningitis due to S. pneumoniae was the most common cause of mortality accounting for 8.0 deaths per 100,000 children <5 years of age per year. This low-cost approach can provide data to support vaccine introduction and the health impact of newly introduced vaccines.
TI  - Regulated delayed expression of rfc enhances the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of a heterologous antigen delivered by live attenuated Salmonella enterica vaccines.
AB  - The Salmonella rfc gene encodes the O-antigen polymerase. We constructed three strains in which we replaced the native rfc promoter with the arabinose-dependent araC P(BAD) promoter so that rfc expression was dependent on exogenously supplied arabinose provided during in vitro growth. The three mutant strains were designed to synthesize different amounts of Rfc by altering the ribosome-binding sequence and start codon. We examined these strains for a number of in vitro characteristics compared to an isogenic Deltarfc mutant and the wild-type parent strain. One promoter-replacement mutation, DeltaP(rfc174), yielded an optimal profile, exhibiting wild-type characteristics when grown with arabinose, and Deltarfc characteristics when grown without arabinose. In addition, when administered orally, the DeltaP(rfc174) strain was completely attenuated in for virulence in mice. The DeltaP(rfc174) mutation was introduced into attenuated Salmonella vaccine strain chi9241 (DeltapabA DeltapabB DeltaasdA) followed by introduction of an Asd(+) balanced-lethal plasmid to designed for expression of the pneumococcal surface protein PspA. Mice immunized with either chi9241 or its DeltaP(rfc174) derivative expressing pspA were protected against S. pneumoniae challenge.
TI  - Live recombinant Salmonella Typhi vaccines constructed to investigate the role of rpoS in eliciting immunity to a heterologous antigen.
AB  - We hypothesized that the immunogenicity of live Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi vaccines expressing heterologous antigens depends, at least in part, on its rpoS status. As part of our project to develop a recombinant attenuated S. Typhi vaccine (RASTyV) to prevent pneumococcal diseases in infants and children, we constructed three RASTyV strains synthesizing the Streptococcus pneumoniae surface protein PspA to test this hypothesis. Each vector strain carried ten engineered mutations designed to optimize safety and immunogenicity. Two S. Typhi vector strains (chi9639 and chi9640) were derived from the rpoS mutant strain Ty2 and one (chi9633) from the RpoS(+) strain ISP1820. In chi9640, the nonfunctional rpoS gene was replaced with the functional rpoS gene from ISP1820. Plasmid pYA4088, encoding a secreted form of PspA, was moved into the three vector strains. The resulting RASTyV strains were evaluated for safety in vitro and for immunogenicity in mice. All three RASTyV strains were similar to the live attenuated typhoid vaccine Ty21a in their ability to survive in human blood and human monocytes. They were more sensitive to complement and were less able to survive and persist in sewage and surface water than their wild-type counterparts. Adult mice intranasally immunized with any of the RASTyV strains developed immune responses against PspA and Salmonella antigens. The RpoS(+) vaccines induced a balanced Th1/Th2 immune response while the RpoS(-) strain chi9639(pYA4088) induced a strong Th2 immune response. Immunization with any RASTyV provided protection against S. pneumoniae challenge; the RpoS(+) strain chi9640(pYA4088) provided significantly greater protection than the ISP1820 derivative, chi9633(pYA4088). In the pre-clinical setting, these strains exhibited a desirable balance between safety and immunogenicity and are currently being evaluated in a Phase 1 clinical trial to determine which of the three RASTyVs has the optimal safety and immunogenicity profile in human hosts.
TI  - Septicemic salmonellosis in a two-humped camel calf (Camelus bactrianus).
AB  - A 1-week old, two-humped female camel (Camelus bactrianus) calf with continual whining, epiphora, anorexia, muscle twitching, and lateral recumbency was referred to a veterinary hospital. Although she died shortly after preliminary clinical examination, but necropsy was performed and tissue samples were taken for further microbiological and pathological examinations. On bacteriological investigation, Salmonella typhimurium and Streptococcus agalactiae were isolated. Histopathologically, lesions consisted of hyperemia and hemorrhage in all serosal and mucosal surfaces, gastroenteritis, and purulent ascites, associated with suppurative omphalitis. Acute nutmeg liver demonstrated centrilobular congestion and moderate fatty changes without any inflammatory cell infiltration. The abomasal and intestinal mucosa were hemorrhagic and erosive. The brain was hyperemic with severe fibrinopurulent meningoencephalitis. Except for dromedary camels and llamas, there has been no previous report of an acute, fatal septicemia in a two-humped camel calf due to S. typhimurium accompanied by S. agalactiae.
TI  - Enhanced protection against nasopharyngeal carriage of Streptococcus pneumoniae elicited by oral multiantigen DNA vaccines delivered in attenuated Salmonella typhimurium.
AB  - Developing carrier systems and choosing appropriate antigens are essential steps  in improving the safety and efficacy of Streptococcus pneumoniae DNA vaccines, which have enhanced the mucosal protection against nasopharyngeal colonization. In this study, we reconstructed a Salmonella-based balanced-lethal host-eukaryotic vector system, which was used as carrier to orally deliver the Streptococcus pneumoniae multiantigen DNA vaccines encoding psaA (pneumococcal surface adhesion A) and pspA' (N-terminal of pneumococcal surface protein A) genes. The results showed that the multiantigen DNA vaccines using the new vector system as carrier afforded better protection than the vaccination with injected intramuscularly (i.m.) against Streptococcus pneumoniae D39 colonization infection in BALB/c mice models. This finding has associated with a high level of sIgA in the nasal mucosa as well as systemic IgG antibodies and a shift toward a Th1-mediated immune response. These studies have demonstrated the feasibility and advantage of using the new Salmonella-based balanced-lethal host-eukaryotic vector system as carrier to deliver S. pneumoniae DNA vaccines.
TI  - Community-acquired bloodstream infections in Africa: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
AB  - Data on the prevalence and causes of community-acquired bloodstream infections in Africa are scarce. We searched three databases for studies that prospectively studied patients admitted to hospital with at least a blood culture, and found 22 eligible studies describing 58 296 patients, of whom 2051 (13.5%) of 15 166 adults and 3527 (8.2%) of 43 130 children had bloodstream infections. 1643 (29.1%) non-malaria bloodstream infections were due to Salmonella enterica (58.4% of these non-typhoidal Salmonella), the most prevalent isolate overall and in adults, and 1031 (18.3% overall) were due to Streptococcus pneumoniae, the most common isolate in children. Other common isolates included Staphylococcus aureus (531 infections; 9.5%) and Escherichia coli (412; 7.3%). Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex accounted for 166 (30.7%) of 539 isolates in seven studies that used mycobacterial culture techniques. HIV infection was associated with any bloodstream infection, particularly with S enterica and M tuberculosis complex bacteraemia. Where recorded, patients with bloodstream infections had an in-hospital case fatality of 18.1%. Our results show that bloodstream infections are common and associated with high mortality. Improved clinical microbiology services and reassessment of empirical treatment guidelines that account for the epidemiology of bloodstream infections might contribute to better outcomes.
TI  - Immunomodulatory activity of Lactobacillus rhamnosus strains isolated from goat milk: impact on intestinal and respiratory infections.
AB  - The immune stimulation induced by Lactobacillus rhamnosus CRL1505 (Lr05) and L. rhamnosus CRL1506 (Lr06) on the resistance to infection with an intestinal pathogen (Salmonella typhimurium) and a respiratory pathogen (Streptococcus pneumoniae) was studied in swiss-albine mice experimental models. The cytokine profiles that induced the innate and specific immune response in both infectious processes were investigated. Both strains were able to improve resistance against the intestinal pathogen. Only Lr05 was able to induce a significant decrease in the number of S. pneumoniae in the lung, prevent its dissemination into the blood and induce a significant increase in Th1 (INF-gamma) and Th2 (IL-6, IL-4 and IL-10) cytokine levels in the bronchoalveolar lavages (BAL). The changes in the cytokines profiles in BAL were associated with an increase in the number and activity of phagocytic cells and with the increase in specific antibodies in serum and BAL, which would explain the increased resistance to the challenge. The administration of Lr06 did not induce significant effects at the respiratory mucosal level. The results described in the present paper showed that certain LAB strains can share certain functional properties, although some of them can perform a functional role better than others, so that it is important to perform careful studies on specific strains, according to their therapeutic use.
TI  - Synthesis of Ag/CNT hybrid nanoparticles and fabrication of their nylon-6 polymer nanocomposite fibers for antimicrobial applications.
AB  - Ag-coated CNTs hybrid nanoparticles (Ag/CNTs) were prepared by ultrasonic irradiation of dimethylformamide (DMF) and silver (I) acetate precursors in the presence of CNTs. The morphology of Ag/CNTs was characterized using x-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) techniques. The Nylon-6 powder and 1 wt% Ag/CNTs mixture was dispersed uniformly using a noncontact spinning technique. The dried mixture was melted in a single screw extrusion machine and then extruded through an orifice. Extruded filaments were later stretched and stabilized by sequentially passing them through a set of tension adjusters and a secondary heater. The Nylon-6/Ag/CNT hybrid polymer nanocomposite (HPNC) fibers, which were of approximately 80 microm size, were tested for their tensile properties. The failure stress and modulus of the extruded HPNC fibers (doped with 1% Ag/CNTs) was about 72.19 % and 342.62% higher than the neat extruded Nylon-6 fiber, respectively. DSC results indicated an increase in the thermal stability and crystallization for HPNC fibers. The antibacterial activity of the Ag-coated CNTs, commercial Ag, neat Nylon-6 and plain CNTs were evaluated. Ag-coated CNTs at 25 microg demonstrated good antimicrobial activity against four common bacterial pathogens as tested by the Kirby-Bauer assay. The mean diameters of the zones of inhibition were 27.9 +/- 6.72 mm, 19.4 +/- 3.64 mm, 21.9 +/- 4.33 mm, and 24.1 +/- 4.14 mm, respectively, for Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. By comparison, those obtained using the broad spectrum antibiotic amoxicillin-clavulanic acid were 37.7 +/- 2.13 mm, 28.6 +/- 4.27 mm, 22.6 +/- 1.27 mm, and 27.0 +/- 1.41 mm, respectively, for the same strains. The zones of inhibition obtained for Nylon-6 Ag-coated CNT powder at 25 microg were also high, ranging from 15.2 to 25.3 mm in contrast to commercial silver or neat Nylon-6, which did not inhibit the bacterial strains tested. Further, the Nylon-6 nanocomposite fibers infused with Ag/CNTs inhibited bacterial growth by 11-20%. Our results suggest that nylon nanocomposite fibers infused with Ag-coated CNTs have significant antimicrobial activity.
TI  - NDP52, a novel autophagy receptor for ubiquitin-decorated cytosolic bacteria.
AB  - Autophagy functions as a cell-autonomous effector mechanism of innate immunity by separating bacteria from cytosolic resources and delivering them for lysosomal destruction. How cytosolic bacteria are targeted for autophagy is incompletely understood. We recently discovered that Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium and Streptococcus pyogenes are detected by NDP52 (nuclear dot protein 52 kDa), after these bacteria enter the cytosol of human cells and become decorated with polyubiquitinated proteins. NDP52 binds the bacterial ubiquitin coat as well as ATG8/LC3 and delivers cytosolic bacteria into autophagosomes. In the absence of NDP52 ubiquitin-coated bacteria accumulate outside ATG8/LC3(+) autophagosomes. Cells lacking NDP52 fail to restrict bacterial proliferation, as do cells depleted of TBK1, an IKK family kinase colocalizing with NDP52 at the bacterial surface. Our findings demonstrate the existence of a receptor for the selective autophagy of cytosolic bacteria, suggesting that cells are able to differentiate between antibacterial and other forms of autophagy.
TI  - Immunogenicity of a live recombinant Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium vaccine expressing pspA in neonates and infant mice born from naive and immunized mothers.
AB  - We are developing a Salmonella vectored vaccine to prevent infant pneumonia and other diseases caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae. One prerequisite for achieving this goal is to construct and evaluate new recombinant attenuated Salmonella vaccine (RASV) strains suitable for use in neonates and infants. Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium strain chi9558(pYA4088) specifies delivery of the pneumococcal protective antigen PspA and can protect adult mice from challenge with S. pneumoniae. This strain is completely safe for oral delivery to day-old and infant mice. Here we assess the colonizing ability, immunogenicity, and protective efficacy of chi9558(pYA4088) in neonatal mice. Colonization was assessed in mice 0, 2, 4, or 7 days of age after oral inoculation. In the presence of maternal antibodies, the colonization of lymphoid tissues was delayed, but the immune responses were enhanced in mice born to immunized mothers. Both oral and intranasal routes were used to assess immunogenicity. All orally or intranasally immunized neonatal and infant mice born to either immunized or naive mothers developed PspA-specific mucosal and systemic immune responses. Mice born to immunized mothers produced higher titers of PspA-specific antibodies in the blood and mucosa and greater numbers of PspA-specific interleukin-4 (IL-4)-secreting cells than mice born to naive mothers. More importantly, mice born to immune mothers showed a significant increase in protection against S. pneumoniae challenge. These results suggest that strain chi9558(pYA4088) can circumvent some of the limitations of the immature immune system in neonatal and infant mice, generating enhanced protective immune responses in the presence of maternal antibodies.
TI  - Biochemical characterization of the RNase II family of exoribonucleases from the  human pathogens Salmonella typhimurium and Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - Maturation, turnover, and quality control of RNA are performed by many different  classes of ribonucleases. Escherichia coli RNase II is the prototype of the RNase II family of ribonucleases, a ubiquitous family of hydrolytic, processive 3' --> 5' exonucleases crucial in RNA metabolism. RNase R is a member of this family that is modulated in response to stress and has been implicated in virulence. In this work, RNase II-like proteins were characterized in the human pathogens Salmonella typhimurium and Streptococcus pneumoniae. By sequence analysis, only one member of the RNase II family was identified in S. pneumoniae, while both RNase II and RNase R were found in Sa. typhimurium. These enzymes were cloned, expressed, purified, and characterized with regard to their biochemical features and modular architecture. The specificity of substrates and the final products generated by the enzymes were clearly demonstrated. Sa. typhimurium RNase II and RNase R behaved essentially as their respective E. coli counterparts. We have shown that the only hydrolytic RNase found in S. pneumoniae was able to degrade structured RNAs as is the case with E. coli RNase R. Our results further showed that there are differences with regard to the activity and ability to bind RNA from enzymes belonging to two distinct pneumococcal strains, and this may be related to a single amino acid substitution in the catalytic domain. Since ribonucleases have not been previously characterized in S. pneumoniae or Sa. typhimurium, this work provides an important first step in the understanding of post-transcriptional control in these pathogens.
TI  - Regulated delayed expression of rfaH in an attenuated Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium vaccine enhances immunogenicity of outer membrane proteins and a heterologous antigen.
AB  - RfaH is a transcriptional antiterminator that reduces the polarity of long operons encoding secreted and surface-associated cell components of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, including O antigen and lipopolysaccharide core sugars. A DeltarfaH mutant strain is attenuated in mice (50% lethal dose [LD(50)], >10(8) CFU). To examine the potential for using rfaH in conjunction with other attenuating mutations, we designed a series of strains in which we replaced the native rfaH promoter with the tightly regulated arabinose-dependent araC P(BAD) promoter so that rfaH expression was dependent on exogenously supplied arabinose provided during in vitro growth. Following colonization of host lymphoid tissues, where arabinose was not available, the P(BAD) promoter was no longer active and rfaH was not expressed. In the absence of RfaH, O antigen and core sugars were not synthesized. We constructed three mutant strains that expressed different levels of RfaH by altering the ribosome-binding sequence and start codon. One mutation, DeltaP(rfaH178), was introduced into the attenuated vaccine strain chi9241 (DeltapabA DeltapabB DeltaasdA) expressing the pneumococcal surface protein PspA from an Asd(+) balanced-lethal plasmid. Mice immunized with this strain and boosted 4 weeks later induced higher levels of serum immunoglobulin G specific for PspA and for outer membrane proteins from other enteric bacteria than either an isogenic DeltarfaH derivative or the isogenic RfaH(+) parent. Eight weeks after primary oral immunization, mice were challenged with 200 LD(50) of virulent Streptococcus pneumoniae WU2. Immunization with DeltaP(rfaH178) mutant strains led to increased levels of protection compared to that of the parent chi9241 and of a DeltarfaH derivative of chi9241.
TI  - PspA family fusion proteins delivered by attenuated Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium extend and enhance protection against Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - Pneumococcal surface protein A (PspA) is highly immunogenic and can induce a protective immune response against pneumococcal infection. PspA is divided into two major families based on serological variability: family 1 and family 2. To provide broad protection, PspA proteins from pneumococcal strains Rx1 (family 1) and EF5668 (family 2) were combined to form two PspA fusion proteins, PspA/Rx1-EF5668 and PspA/EF5668-Rx1. Each protein was fused to a type II secretion signal and delivered by a recombinant attenuated Salmonella vaccine (RASV). Both PspA/Rx1-EF5668 and PspA/EF5668-Rx1 were synthesized in the RASV and secreted into the periplasm and supernatant. The fusion proteins reacted strongly with both anti-PspA/Rx1 and anti-PspA/EF5668 antisera. Oral immunization of BALB/c mice with RASV synthesizing either PspA fusion protein elicited serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) and mucosal IgA responses against both families of PspA. Analysis of IgG isotypes (IgG2a and IgG1) indicated a strong Th1 bias to the immune responses to both proteins. Sera from mice immunized with RASV synthesizing PspA/Rx1-EF5668 bound to the surface and directed C3 complement deposition on representative strains from all five PspA clades. Immunization with RASV synthesizing either protein protected mice against intraperitoneal challenge with Streptococcus pneumoniae WU2 strain (family 1), intravenous challenge with S. pneumoniae 3JYP2670 strain (family 2), and intranasal challenge with S. pneumoniae A66.1 (family 1). The PspA/Rx1-EF5668 protein elicited significantly greater protection than PspA/EF5668-Rx1, PspA/Rx1, or PspA/EF5668. These results indicate an RASV synthesizing a PspA fusion protein representing both PspA families constitutes an effective antipneumococcal vaccine, extending and enhancing protection against multiple strains of S. pneumoniae.
TI  - The interaction of the antimicrobial peptide cLEAP-2 and the bacterial membrane.
AB  - Chicken Liver Expressed Antimicrobial Peptide-2 (cLEAP-2) is known to have killing activities against Salmonella spp., but the mechanism by which killing occurs remains to be elucidated. The ability of cLEAP-2 to disrupt the outer membrane of several Salmonella spp. was assessed using the fluorescent probe N-phenyl-1-naphthylamine (NPN). A rapid dose-dependent permeabilization of the outer membranes of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium phoP, and S. enterica serovar Typhimurium SL1344 was observed although no significant permeabilisation of the S. enteriditis membrane was detected. These data suggested that the ability of the mature cLEAP-2 peptide to permeabilise the Salmonella outer membrane is important in mediating its killing activities. The ability of the peptide to kill Gram-positive bacteria, specifically Streptococcus spp. and Staphylococcus spp. was also investigated using recombinant peptide and a time-kill assay. Of the strains analysed the Streptococcus pyogenes M1 strain appeared the most resistant to LEAP-2 killing although S. pyogenes mutants deficient in Sortase and M1 activities showed increased sensitivity to the mature peptide. This suggested the involvement of specific Streptococcus cell wall proteins including M1 in the resistance of the bacteria to cLEAP-2 killing. cLEAP-2 showed no significant toxicity towards mammalian erythrocytes indicating selectivity for bacterial over eukaryote cell membranes. These data provide further support for mature cLEAP-2 functioning in protecting the chicken against microbial attack.
TI  - Correlations between carbon metabolism and virulence in bacteria.
AB  - Bacteria have developed several mechanisms which allow the preferred utilization  of the most efficiently metabolizable carbohydrates when these organisms are exposed to a mixture of carbon sources. Interestingly, the same or similar mechanisms are used by some pathogens to control various steps of their infection process. The efficient metabolism of a carbon source might serve as signal for proper fitness. Alternatively, the presence of a specific carbon source might indicate to bacterial cells that they thrive in infection-related organs, tissues or cells and that specific virulence genes should be turned on or switched off. Frequently, virulence gene regulators are affected by changes in carbon source availability. For example, expression of the gene encoding the Streptococcus pyogenes virulence regulator Mga is controlled by the classical carbon catabolite repression (CCR) mechanism operative in Firmicutes. The activity of PrfA, the major virulence regulator in Listeria monocytogenes, seems to be controlled by the phosphorylation state of phosphotransferase system(PTS) components. In Vibrio cholerae synthesis of HapR, which regulates the expression of genes required for motility, is controlled via the Crp/cAMP CCR mechanism, whereas synthesis of Salmonella enterica HilE, which represses genes in a pathogenicity island, is regulated by the carbohydrate-responsive, PTS-controlled Mlc.
TI  - Immunisation of the equine uterus against Streptococcus equi subspecies zooepidemicus using an intranasal attenuated Salmonella vector.
AB  - Attenuated Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium MGN707, expressing the SzP protective protein of the MB9 serovar of Streptococcus equi subspecies zooepidemicus (SzP-MB9) was tested for its safety and efficacy as a nebulised intranasal vaccine against streptococcal uterine infections in mares. In a preliminary study, vaccinated mares (n=5) displayed serum, nasal and uterine responses (P<0.05) to S. Typhimurium lipopolysaccharide (St-LPS). Subsequently, vaccinated mares (expressor group, n=7), but not mares vaccinated with the vector only (control group, n=7), displayed significant increases in SzP-MB9 antibodies in serum, nasal and uterine washes (P<0.05). Assuming the uteri of all nine mares were free of streptococci prior to challenge with 6.3 x 10(9) colony forming units of S. e. zooepidemicus MB9, significantly fewer S. e. zooepidemicus were cultured from the uterine flushings of expressor-vaccinated mares (n=4) compared to control-vaccinated mares (n=5) (P<0.001). The only adverse reaction to vaccination was nasal haemorrhage in one mare.
TI  - [Impaired autophagy in Crohn's disease patients: an opened gate to invasive bacteria?].
AB  
TI  - Quinine is bactericidal.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the antibacterial properties of Quinine dihydrochloride and its MIC. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A Quasi-Experimental study was conducted at the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre, Karachi from July 2006 to November 2006. Two hundred samples of pus, blood, sputum and ascitic fluid, from hospitalized adult patients from Medicine ward (W-7) having different Bacterial infections were studied. Proforma was filled to document the demographic details. Samples were collected from different sites, isolated, identified and checked for antimicrobial susceptibility of quinine dihydrochloride by standard methods. RESULTS: Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella typhi were inhibited at MIC of 125 g/ml. Streptococcus pyogenes was inhibited at MIC of 31.25 g/ml of quinine dihydrochloride (Dilution ranges from 31.25 g/ml to 1000 g/ml). CONCLUSION: The concomitant antimalarial and antibacterial action of Quinine dihydrochloride may be beneficial in developing countries adding to cost effectiveness of treatment provided to patients belonging to low socioeconomic group.
TI  - Purified recombinant phage lysin LySMP: an extensive spectrum of lytic activity for swine streptococci.
AB  - Bacteriophage lysin has attracted considerable attentions as possible antimicrobial agents for solution of antibiotic resistance. SMP was a Streptococcus suis serotype 2 bacteriophage isolated from nasal swabs of healthy Bama minipigs. The putative SMP bacteriophage lysin, designated LySMP, was recombinantly expressed in Escherichia coli BL21, and chromatographically purified. Treated with 0.8% of beta-mercaptoethanol, LySMP exhibited an extensive lysin spectrum than those of whole phage against bacteria investigated. S. suis serotype 2, S. suis serotype 7 and S. suis serotype 9 strains were recovered from diseased pigs between 1998 and 2005 in China. Fifteen of seventeen strains of S. suis serotype 2 could be lysed, as well as S. suis serotype 7 and 9, Streptococcus equi ssp. zooepidemicus and Staphylococcus aureus. But E. coli and Salmonella enterica were not affected. Purified LySMP showed high degrading efficiency against PMSF or lysozyme treated cells comparing to PBS washed cells. Optimum pH and temperature conditions for the lysin were investigated by turbidity reduction assay. The lysin exerted efficient lysis activity at 37 degrees C, pH 5.2. The turbidity of bacterium investigated was observed to decrease by 1.2-68% in 30 min. Result indicated that putative LySMP could be a candidate antimicrobial agent in controlling S. suis infection.
TI  - A multiplex real-time PCR for differential detection and quantification of Salmonella spp., Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium and Enteritidis in meats.
AB  - Salmonella (S.) Typhimurium and S. Enteritidis are the major causative agents of  food-borne illnesses worldwide. Currently, a rapid detection system using multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been applied for other food-borne pathogens such as Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus spp. A multiplex real-time PCR was developed for the simultaneous detection of Salmonella spp., especially S. Typhimurium and S. Enteritidis, in beef and pork. For the specific and sensitive multiplex real-time PCR, three representative primers and probes were designed based on sequence data from Genbank. Among the three DNA extraction methods (boiling, alkaline lysis, and QIAamp DNA Mini Kit), the QIAamp DNA Mini Kit was the most sensitive in this study. The optimized multiplex real-time PCR was applied to artificially inoculated beef or pork. The detection sensitivity of the multiplex real-time PCR was increased. The specificity of the multiplex real-time PCR assay, using 128 pure-cultured bacteria including 110 Salmonella isolates and 18 non-Salmonella isolates, was 100%, 100% and 99.1% for Salmonella spp., S. Typhimurium and S. Enteritidis, respectively. The sensitivity was 100%, 100% and 91.7% for Salmonella spp., S. Typhimurium and S. Enteritidis, respectively. The multiplex real-time PCR assay developed in this study could detect up to 0.54 +/- 0.09 and 0.65 +/- 0.07 log(10) CFU/ml for S. Typhimurium and S. Enteritidis for beef, 1.45 +/- 0.21 and 1.65 +/- 0.07 log(10) CFU/ml for S. Typhimurium and S. Enteritidis for pork, respectively, with all conditions optimized. Our results indicated that the multiplex real-time PCR assay developed in this study could sensitively detect Salmonella spp. and specifically differentiate S. Typhimurium from S. Enteritidis in meats.
TI  - Synthesis and biological evaluation of some thiazolidinone derivatives of steroid as antibacterial agents.
AB  - Steroidal thiazolidinone derivatives were prepared by the multi-step reactions of steroid. It is prepared from steroidal thiosemicarbazones with ethyl bromoacetate in dioxane. Steroidal thiosemicarbazones were prepared by the reaction of thiosemicarbazide with steroidal ketones. The structures of these compounds were elucidated by IR, (1)H NMR, Fab mass spectrometries and their purities were confirmed by elemental analyses. The antibacterial activity of these compounds was evaluated by the disk diffusion assay against two gram-positive and two gram-negative bacteria and then the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of compounds was determined. The results showed that steroidal thiazolidinone derivatives are better in inhibiting the growth as compared to steroidal thiosemicarbazone derivatives of both types of the bacteria (gram-positive and gram-negative). Compounds 7 and 8 are better antibacterial agents as compared to standard drug Amoxicillin.
TI  - Comparative structural and molecular characterization of ribitol-5-phosphate-containing Streptococcus oralis coaggregation receptor polysaccharides.
AB  - The antigenically related coaggregation receptor polysaccharides (RPS) of Streptococcus oralis strains C104 and SK144 mediate recognition of these bacteria by other members of the dental plaque biofilm community. In the present study, the structure of strain SK144 RPS was established by high resolution NMR spectroscopy as [6Galfbeta1-6GalNAcbeta1-3Galalpha1-2ribitol-5-PO(4)(-)-6Galfbeta1-3Galbeta1](n), thereby indicating that this polysaccharide and the previously characterized RPS of strain C104 are identical, except for the linkage between Gal and ribitol-5-phosphate, which is alpha1-2 in strain SK144 versus alpha1-1 in strain C104. Studies to define the molecular basis of RPS structure revealed comparable genes for six putative transferases and a polymerase in the rps loci of these streptococci. Cell surface RPS production was abolished by disrupting the gene for the first transferase of strain C104 with a nonpolar erm cassette. It was restored in the resulting mutant by plasmid-based expression of either wcjG, the corresponding gene of S. pneumoniae for serotype 10A capsular polysaccharide (CPS) biosynthesis or wbaP for the transferase of Salmonella enterica that initiates O-polysaccharide biosynthesis. Thus, WcjG, like WbaP, appears to initiate polysaccharide biosynthesis by transferring galactose-1-phosphate to a lipid carrier. In further studies, the structure of strain C104 RPS was converted to that of strain SK144 by replacing the gene (wefM) for the fourth transferase in the rps locus of strain C104 with the corresponding gene (wcrC) of strain SK144 or Streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 10A. These findings identify genetic markers for the different ribitol-5-phosphate-containing types of RPS present in S. oralis and establish a close relationship between these polysaccharides and serogroup 10 CPSs of S. pneumoniae.
TI  - Evaluation of new generation Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium vaccines with regulated delayed attenuation to induce immune responses against PspA.
AB  - Increasing the immunogenicity to delivered antigens by recombinant attenuated Salmonella vaccines (RASV) has been the subject of intensive study. With this goal in mind, we have designed and constructed a new generation of RASV that exhibit regulated delayed attenuation. These vaccine strains are phenotypically wild type at the time of immunization and become attenuated after colonization of host tissues. The vaccine strains are grown under conditions that allow expression of genes required for optimal invasion and colonization of host tissues. Once established in the host, these virulence genes are turned off, fully attenuating the vaccine strain. In this study, we compared 2 of our newly developed regulated delayed attenuation Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium strains chi9088 and chi9558 with the Deltacya Deltacrp Deltaasd strain chi8133, for their abilities to express and present a secreted form of the alpha-helical region of pneumococcal surface protein A (PspA) to the mouse immune system. All 3 strains induced high levels of serum antibodies specific for PspA as well as to Salmonella antigens in orally immunized mice. However, both RASVs expressing delayed attenuation elicited significantly greater anti-PspA immune responses, including serum IgG and T cell secretion of IL-4 and IFN-gamma, than other groups. Also, vaccination with delayed attenuation strains resulted in a greater degree of protection against Streptococcus pneumoniae challenge than in mice vaccinated with chi8133 (71-86% vs. 21% survival, P </= 0.006). Together, the results demonstrate that the regulated attenuation strategy results in highly immunogenic antigen delivery vectors for oral vaccination.
TI  - A sopB deletion mutation enhances the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of a heterologous antigen delivered by live attenuated Salmonella enterica vaccines.
AB  - SopB is a virulence factor of Salmonella encoded by SPI-5. Salmonella sopB deletion mutants are impaired in their ability to cause local inflammatory responses and fluid secretion into the intestinal lumen and also can enhance the immunogenicity of a vectored antigen. In this study, we evaluated the effects on immunogenicity and the efficacy of a sopB deletion mutation on two Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium vaccine strains with different attenuating mutations expressing a highly antigenic alpha-helical region of the Streptococcus pneumoniae surface protein PspA from an Asd(+)-balanced lethal plasmid. After oral administration to mice, the two pairs of strains induced high levels of serum antibodies specific for PspA as well as to Salmonella antigens. The levels of antigen-specific serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) and mucosal IgA were higher in mice immunized with sopB mutants. Enzyme-linked immunospot assay results indicated that the spleen cells from mice immunized with a sopB mutant showed higher interleukin-4 and gamma interferon secretion levels than did the mice immunized with the isogenic sopB(+) strain. The sopB mutants also induced higher numbers of CD4(+) CD44(hi) CD62L(hi) and CD8(+) CD44(hi) CD62L(hi) central memory T cells. Eight weeks after primary oral immunization, mice were challenged with 100 50% lethal doses of virulent S. pneumoniae WU2. Immunization with either of the sopB mutant strains led to increased levels of protection compared to that with the isogenic sopB(+) parent. Together, these results demonstrate that the deletion of sopB leads to an overall enhancement of the immunogenicity and efficacy of recombinant attenuated Salmonella vaccine strains.
TI  - Non-typhoidal Salmonella septic arthritis in an immunocompetent child with a pharyngeal streptococcal infection.
AB  - We report the case of an immunocompetent child who showed monoarticular arthritis and fever, preceded by pharyngitis and arthralgias. Because group A beta-hemolytic Streptococcus had been detected in the pharyngeal swab, erythromycin was given on admission. However, based on ultrasound examination, therapy with ceftriaxone and joint fluid drainage were promptly performed, and a rapid and full recovery followed. Meanwhile, Salmonella enterica infection was revealed in blood and joint fluid. Our case suggests that septic arthritis caused by a non-typhoidal Salmonella infection may occur without gastrointestinal manifestations and concomitantly with a pharyngeal streptococcal infection.
TI  - Mitracarpus frigidus aerial parts exhibited potent antimicrobial, antileishmanial, and antioxidant effects.
AB  - The crude extract and the hexane, CH(2)Cl(2), EtOAc, n-BuOH, and hydromethanolic  fractions of the aerial parts of Mitracarpus frigidus were evaluated against promastigote forms of two species of Leishmania (L. chagasi and L. amazonensis), 11 strains of bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enterica sorovar Tythimurium, Shigella sonnei, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterobacter cloacae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Bacillus cereus) and two yeasts (Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans). The antioxidant activity (DPPH radical scavenging activity and reducing power), cytotoxicity against mammalian cells, and the contents of phenolics and flavonoids were determined. Phytochemical analysis of the major groups of phytoconstituents is also reported. All samples showed antioxidant activity which was positively correlated to the content of phenolic compounds. S. sonnei, B. cereus and C. neoformans were susceptible to all extracts tested, except for the n-BuOH and hydromethanolic fractions, which demonstrated no antimicrobial activity. The lowest MIC was recorded for the CH(2)Cl(2) fraction against C. neoformans (MIC of 10 microg/ml), followed by B. cereus, S. sonnei, and E. cloacae (MIC of 20, 39 and 39 microg/ml, respectively). The CH(2)Cl(2) fraction was the most effective against L. chagasi (IC(50) of 6.7 microg/ml), and the hydromethanolic fraction exhibited the best activity against L. amazonensis (IC(50) of 9 microg/ml). A cytotoxic effect on mammalian cells was observed only for the crude extract and CH(2)Cl(2) fraction at the concentrations of 130 and 31 microg/ml, respectively. These results suggest that M. frigidus has interesting antimicrobial, antileishmanial and antioxidant activities.
TI  - Regulated programmed lysis of recombinant Salmonella in host tissues to release protective antigens and confer biological containment.
AB  - We have devised and constructed a biological containment system designed to cause programmed bacterial cell lysis with no survivors. We have validated this system, using Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium vaccines for antigen delivery after colonization of host lymphoid tissues. The system is composed of two parts. The first component is Salmonella typhimurium strain chi8937, with deletions of asdA and arabinose-regulated expression of murA, two genes required for peptidoglycan synthesis and additional mutations to enhance complete lysis and antigen delivery. The second component is plasmid pYA3681, which encodes arabinose-regulated murA and asdA expression and C2-regulated synthesis of antisense asdA and murA mRNA transcribed from the P22 P(R) promoter. An arabinose-regulated c2 gene is present in the chromosome. chi8937(pYA3681) exhibits arabinose-dependent growth. Upon invasion of host tissues, an arabinose-free environment, transcription of asdA, murA, and c2 ceases, and concentrations of their gene products decrease because of cell division. The drop in C2 concentration results in activation of P(R), driving synthesis of antisense mRNA to block translation of any residual asdA and murA mRNA. A highly antigenic alpha-helical domain of Streptococcus pneumoniae Rx1 PspA was cloned into pYA3681, resulting in pYA3685 to test antigen delivery. Mice orally immunized with chi8937(pYA3685) developed antibody responses to PspA and Salmonella outer membrane proteins. No viable vaccine strain cells were detected in host tissues after 21 days. This system has potential applications with other Gram-negative bacteria in which biological containment would be desirable.
TI  - Skim milk enhances the preservation of thawed -80 degrees C bacterial stocks.
AB  - The results from bacterial strain recovery efforts following hurricanes Katrina and Rita are reported. Over 90% of strains frozen in 10% skim milk were recovered whereas various recovery rates were observed for glycerol-stored stocks (56% and 94% of Escherichia coli, depending upon the laboratory). These observations led to a viability comparison of Streptococcus pyogenes, Campylobacter jejuni, Borrelia burgdorferi, Salmonella enterica subsp. Typhimurium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and E. coli strains stored in glycerol or skim milk. In all bacteria examined, 10% skim milk resulted in significantly longer viability after thawing than 15% glycerol solutions currently used in most laboratories.
TI  - Analysis of type II secretion of recombinant pneumococcal PspA and PspC in a Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium vaccine with regulated delayed antigen synthesis.
AB  - Recombinant attenuated Salmonella vaccines (RASVs) have been used extensively to  express and deliver heterologous antigens to host mucosal tissues. Immune responses can be enhanced greatly when the antigen is secreted to the periplasm or extracellular compartment. The most common method for accomplishing this is by fusion of the antigen to a secretion signal sequence. Finding an optimal signal sequence is typically done empirically. To facilitate this process, we constructed a series of plasmid expression vectors, each containing a different type II signal sequence. We evaluated the utilities of these vectors by fusing two different antigens, the alpha-helix domains of pneumococcal surface protein A (PspA) and pneumococcal surface protein C (PspC), to the signal sequences of beta-lactamase (bla SS), ompA, and phoA and the signal sequence and C-terminal peptide of beta-lactamase (bla SS+CT) on Asd(+) plasmids under the control of the P(trc) promoter. Strains were characterized for level of expression, subcellular antigen location, and the capacity to elicit antigen-specific immune responses and protection against challenge with Streptococcus pneumoniae in mice. The immune responses to each protein differed depending on the signal sequence used. Strains carrying the bla SS-pspA and bla SS+CT-pspC fusions yielded the largest amounts of secreted PspA and PspC, respectively, and induced the highest serum IgG titers, although all fusion proteins tested induced some level of antigen-specific IgG response. Consistent with the serum antibody responses, RASVs expressing the bla SS-pspA and bla SS+CT-pspC fusions induced the greatest protection against S. pneumoniae challenge.
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial activity of 3-arylamino-1-chloropropan-2-ols.
AB  - A series of nine 3-arylamino-1-chloropropan-2-ols 2a-2i were synthesized and their anti-fungal activity against pathogenic strains of Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus niger and Candida albicans, and antibacterial activity against four pathogenic bacterial strains of Salmonella typhi, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pneumonae and Staphylococcus aureus were evaluated using different assay systems. 1-Chloro-3-(4'-chlorophenylamino)-propan-2-ol was found to be the most active anti-fungal compound against three pathogenic strains under study, i.e., A. fumigatus, A. flavus and A. niger; the compound showed more than 90% inhibition of growth of A. fumigatus at a concentration of 5.85 microg/ml in disc diffusion assay. Interestingly, 1-chloro-3-(4'-chlorophenylamino)-propan-2-ol did not show any toxicity up to a concentration of 4000 microg/ml. Although 1-chloro-3-(4'-chlorophenylamino)-propan-2-ol was about 8 times less active than the standard compound amphotericin B, its toxicity was many more fold less than the toxicity of amphotericin B. Further, 1-chloro-3-(2',6'-dichlorophenylamino)-propan-2-ol and 1-chloro-3-(3',5'-dichlorophenylamino)-propan-2-ol were found to be the most active compounds against C. albicans. In the anti-microbial assay, 1-chloro-3-(2',4'-dichlorophenylamino)-propan-2-ol and 1-chloro-3-(3',5'-dichlorophenylamino)-propan-2-ol were found to be the most active compounds against Salmonella typhi and 1-chloro-3-(3',4'-dichlorophenylamino)-propan-2-ol was found to be the most active compound against P. aeruginosa. Although, the activities of 1-chloro-3-(2',4'-dichlorophenylamino)-propan-2-ol and 1-chloro-3-(3',5'-dichlorophenylamino)-propan-2-ol are about half the activity of the standard anti-bacterial compound tetracycline, these compounds also were many fold less toxic than the standard drug.
TI  - Secreted enteric antimicrobial activity localises to the mucus surface layer.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The intestinal mucosa is constantly exposed to a dense and highly dynamic microbial flora and challenged by a variety of enteropathogenic bacteria. Antibacterial protection is provided in part by Paneth cell-derived antibacterial peptides such as the alpha-defensins. The mechanism of peptide-mediated antibacterial control and its functional importance for gut homeostasis has recently been appreciated in patients with Crohn's ileitis. In the present study, the spatial distribution of antimicrobial peptides was analysed within the small intestinal anatomical compartments such as the intestinal crypts, the overlaying mucus and the luminal content. METHODS: Preparations from the different intestinal locations as well as whole mouse small intestine were extracted and separated by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. Antibacterial activity was determined in extracts, and the presence of antimicrobial peptides/proteins was confirmed by N-terminal sequencing, mass spectrometry analysis and immunodetection. RESULTS: The secreted antibacterial activity was largely confined to the layer of mucus, whereas only minute amounts of activity were noted in the luminal content. The extractable activity originating from either crypt/mucus/lumen compartments respectively (given as a percentage) was for Listeria monocytogenes, 48 (4)/44 (4)/8 (8); Enterococcus faecalis, 44 (10)/49 (3)/7 (7); Bacterium megaterium, 56 (4)/42 (3)/2 (1); Streptococcus pyogenes, 48 (4)/46 (3)/6 (6); Escherichia coli, 46 (4)/47 (3)/7 (7); and Salmonella enterica sv. Typhimurium, 38 (3)/43 (7)/19 (10). A spectrum of antimicrobial peptides was identified in isolated mucus, which exhibited strong and contact-dependent antibacterial activity against both commensal and pathogenic bacteria. CONCLUSION: These findings show that secreted antimicrobial peptides are retained by the surface-overlaying mucus and thereby provide a combined physical and antibacterial barrier to prevent bacterial attachment and invasion. This distribution facilitates high local peptide concentration on vulnerable mucosal surfaces, while still allowing the presence of an enteric microbiota.
TI  - Development of a protein secretion system with the application of sec-dependent protein secretion components.
AB  - In order to induce high levels of protein secretion, we have constructed a recombinant plasmid, designated pBP244, into which was incorporated key components of the type-II Sec-dependent secretion system, including LepB (signal peptidase), SecA (ATPase), and SecB (chaperone). The biological activities of the LepB, SecA, and SecB components expressed from genes harbored by pBP244 appeared to play their normal roles. In order to evaluate the protein secretion, a pspA (Streptococcus pneumoniae surface protein A) gene was cloned into pBP244, resulting in pBP438. S. typhimurium harboring pBP438 grown until the stationary phase, secreted a higher level of PspA into the culture supernatants than did the strain harboring pYA3494. The strain harboring pBP438 secreted a supernatant amount 1.71-fold, a periplasmic space amount 1.47-fold, and an outer membrane amount 1.49-fold higher than that of pYA3494. S. typhimurium chi8554 kept the Asd+ plasmid pBP244 and pBP438 for 60 generations in LB broth harboring DAP, thereby indicating that pBP244 and pBP438 were quite stable in the Salmonella strain.
TI  - Improved diagnosis specificity in bone and joint infections using molecular techniques.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The microbiological diagnosis of osteoarticular infections currently  relies on microbiological cultures, to specifically target treatment. However, these conventional methods sometimes lack of sensitivity and of specificity to establish definitive diagnosis. This study was conducted to determine whether molecular method could improve bacterial bone and joint infection diagnosis. METHODS: We evaluated the performance of nucleic acid extraction with the semi-automated NucliSens miniMAG instrument coupled to 16S rDNA sequencing on 76 samples collected from 51 patients with suspected infections: prosthetic-joint infection (15), spondylodiscitis (7) acute septic arthritis (11) and 18 controls. No pre-treatment of the sample was done before nucleic acid extraction. Classification in infected group required an accumulation of arguments. RESULTS: Our molecular method identified a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria including Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis, Salmonella enterica, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and fastidious bacteria like Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Fusobacterium nucleatum. The overall PCR sensitivity was 73.3%: 53.8% for prosthetic-joint infections and 88.2% for infections without prostheses. The overall PCR specificity was 95.2%, whereas culture specificity was only 85.7%. CONCLUSIONS: The instrument was simple to use and provided nucleic acids free of PCR inhibitors and free of contamination by foreign bacterial DNA. Our study highlights the need for still improved molecular diagnostic sensitivity.
TI  - Bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances from Campylobacter spp.
AB  - Twenty-five Campylobacter isolates were screened for production of antimicrobial  substances using a deferred antagonism assay. Sixteen isolates showed activity against either Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis or Candida albicans. The inhibitory activity was sensitive to treatment with pronase E, trypsin and pepsin, suggesting that the antimicrobial compound(s) are proteinaceous. Activity spectra of isolates included S. aureus, Micrococcus luteus, Streptococcus sp., Bacillus subtilis, a drug-resistant clinical isolate of S. aureus and one isolate of C. albicans. Producing isolates showed cross-immunity and inhibitory activity was only observed on solid media. The findings of this study suggest that Campylobacter produces proteinaceous inhibitory substances.
TI  - Identification and characterization of starter lactic acid bacteria and probiotics from Columbian dairy products.
AB  - AIMS: Considering the significant rise in the probiotic market in Columbia, and given the lack of reports concerning the microbial population and strain performance in products from different producers, this study aims at determining the number of viable starter bacteria and probiotics in bio-yoghurts available at the Columbian market, identifying the species and analysing the performance of the isolated strains in bile acid resistance, antagonistic activity against pathogens, and adherence capacity to human intestinal epithelial cells. METHODS AND RESULTS: Seven bio-yoghurts were analysed for the bacterial species present. Species identification was carried out using 16S rRNA gene targeted PCR. The cultured bacteria were tested for bile acid resistance, adherence to a human intestinal epithelial cell line, and antagonism against the pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. A total of 17 different strains were identified. Based on plate counting, all bio-yoghurts have at least total viable cells of approximately 10(7) CFU ml(-1). Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus were the most frequently isolated bacteria. Viable Bifidobacterium was only recovered from one product. However, after PCR analysis, DNA of this genus was confirmed in five out of seven products. Major differences were found for S. typhimurium antagonism. The adherence capacity to Caco-2 cells was observed in 10 of the isolated strains. In general, low survival to simulated gastric juice was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Some of the isolated strains have probiotic potential, although not all of them were present in the advised amount to exert beneficial health effects. However, the full correct scientific name of the isolated bacteria and their viable counts were not included on the product label. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This is the first report describing the identification and functionality of starter bacteria and probiotics present in dairy products on the Columbian market.
TI  - Recombining population structure of Plesiomonas shigelloides (Enterobacteriaceae) revealed by multilocus sequence typing.
AB  - Plesiomonas shigelloides is an emerging pathogen that is widespread in the aquatic environment and is responsible for intestinal diseases and extraintestinal infections in humans and other animals. Virtually nothing is known about its genetic diversity, population structure, and evolution, which severely limits epidemiological control. We addressed these questions by developing a multilocus sequence typing (MLST) system based on five genes (fusA, leuS, pyrG, recG, and rpoB) and analyzing 77 epidemiologically unrelated strains from several countries and several ecological sources. The phylogenetic position of P. shigelloides within family Enterobacteriaceae was precisely defined by phylogenetic analysis of the same gene portions in other family members. Within P. shigelloides, high levels of nucleotide diversity (average percentage of nucleotide differences between strains, 1.49%) and genotypic diversity (64 distinct sequence types; Simpson's index, 99.7%) were found, with no salient internal phylogenetic structure. We estimated that homologous recombination in housekeeping genes affects P. shigelloides alleles and nucleotides 7 and 77 times more frequently than mutation, respectively. These ratios are similar to those observed in the naturally transformable species Streptococcus pneumoniae with a high rate of recombination. In contrast, recombination within Salmonella enterica, Escherichia coli, and Yersinia enterocolitica was much less frequent. P. shigelloides thus stands out among members of the Enterobacteriaceae. Its high rate of recombination results in a lack of association between genomic background and O and H antigenic factors, as observed for the 51 serotypes found in our sample. Given its robustness and discriminatory power, we recommend MLST as a reference method for population biology studies and epidemiological tracking of P. shigelloides strains.
TI  - Outbreaks where food workers have been implicated in the spread of foodborne disease. Part 1. Description of the problem, methods, and agents involved.
AB  - Food workers in many settings have been responsible for foodborne disease outbreaks for decades, and there is no indication that this is diminishing. The Committee on Control of Foodborne Illnesses of the International Association for Food Protection was tasked with collecting and evaluating any data on worker-associated outbreaks. A total of 816 reports with 80,682 cases were collected from events that occurred from 1927 until the first quarter of 2006. Most of the outbreaks reviewed were from the United States, Canada, Europe, and Australia, with relatively few from other parts of the world, indicating the skewed set of data because of availability in the literature or personal contact. Outbreaks were caused by 14 agents: norovirus or probable norovirus (338), Salmonella enterica (151), hepatitis A virus (84), Staphylococcus aureus (53), Shigella spp. (33), Streptococcus Lancefield groups A and G (17), and parasites Cyclospora, Giardia, and Cryptosporidium (23). Streptococcal, staphylococcal, and typhoid outbreaks seem to be diminishing over time; hepatitis A virus remains static, whereas norovirus and maybe nontyphoidal Salmonella are increasing. Multiple foods and multi-ingredient foods were identified most frequently with outbreaks, perhaps because of more frequent hand contact during preparation and serving.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Quercus ilex bark's extracts.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of different extracts of Quercus ilex bark (Fagaceae)  was studied in vitro against seven reference strains of bacteria by using a disc-diffusion method and agar-dilution method. The ethyl acetate extract (QE), n-butanol extract (QB) and final aqueous layer (QA) were effective against all bacterial strains tested at MICs ranging from 128 to 512 microg/ml. The n-hexane extract (QH) and dichloromethane extract (QD) showed no activity.
TI  - TBK1 protects vacuolar integrity during intracellular bacterial infection.
AB  - TANK-binding kinase-1 (TBK1) is an integral component of Type I interferon induction by microbial infection. The importance of TBK1 and Type I interferon in antiviral immunity is well established, but the function of TBK1 in bacterial infection is unclear. Upon infection of murine embryonic fibroblasts with Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (Salmonella), more extensive bacterial proliferation was observed in tbk1(-/-) than tbk1(+/+) cells. TBK1 kinase activity was required for restriction of bacterial infection, but interferon regulatory factor-3 or Type I interferon did not contribute to this TBK1-dependent function. In tbk1(-/-)cells, Salmonella, enteropathogenic Escherichia coli, and Streptococcus pyogenes escaped from vacuoles into the cytosol where increased replication occurred, which suggests that TBK1 regulates the integrity of pathogen-containing vacuoles. Knockdown of tbk1 in macrophages and epithelial cells also resulted in increased bacterial localization in the cytosol, indicating that the role of TBK1 in maintaining vacuolar integrity is relevant in different cell types. Taken together, these data demonstrate a requirement for TBK1 in control of bacterial infection distinct from its established role in antiviral immunity.
TI  - Acid adaptation affects the viability of Salmonella typhimurium during the lactic fermentation of skim milk and product storage.
AB  - In this study, Salmonella typhimurium was acid adapted at pH 5.5 for 4 h. The viability of the acid-adapted and non-adapted cells of S. typhimurium was investigated both during the lactic fermentation of skim milk with Streptococcus thermophilus or Lactobacillus bulgaricus, and during the storage of lactic fermented milk products at 5 degrees C. It was found that the viable population of S. typhimurium, regardless of acid adaptation, increased in skim milk during the initial 24 h of lactic fermentation and then declined. However, the viable population of acid-adapted S. typhimurium was significantly higher (P<.05) than that of non-adapted cell at the end of 48 h of fermentation. Acid-adapted cells of S. typhimurium were also found to have survived better than non-adapted cells in the S. thermophilus-prepared fermented milk and two commercial lactic fermented milk products. The viability of the acid-adapted and non-adapted S. typhimurium at 5 and 37 degrees C in cell-free fermented milks that had their pHs adjusted to 6.4 and skim milk (pH 6.4) was further investigated. Results revealed that acid adaptation, in addition to enhancing acid tolerance, reduced the susceptibility of S. typhimurium to refrigerated temperature and other detrimental factors which might be present in lactic fermented milk products. These responses all contribute to the enhanced survival of acid-adapted S. typhimurium in the lactic fermented milk products observed in the present study.
TI  - In vivo induced antigen technology (IVIAT) and change mediated antigen technology (CMAT).
AB  - In this chapter, an overview of in vivo induced antigen technology (IVIAT) and change mediated antigen technology (CMAT) will be presented, including a discussion of the advantages and limitations of these methods. Over fifteen different microbial pathogens have been or are known to be currently studied with these methods. Salient data obtained from the application of IVIAT and/or CMAT to a selection of human and plant pathogens will be summarized. This includes recent reports on Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A) in neurological disorders and invasive diseases, Xylella fastidiosa in Pierce's disease, Xanthomonas campestris in bean blight, Salmonella enterica serovar typhi in typhoid fever and Leishmania spp. related infections. Special emphasis will be given to those targets that have been further investigated for the development of novel vaccine, diagnostic and/or antibiotherapy strategies. This encompasses a new point-of-care serological diagnostic test for chronic periodontal diseases. Finally, Mycobacterium tuberculosis in vivo induced products will be described as providing a rational basis for differentiating subjects with primary, dormant or secondary tuberculosis infections, from control subjects who have or did not have prior vaccination with BCG.
TI  - Mutagenicity and antimutagenic effect of soymilk fermented with lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria.
AB  - In this study, soymilk was first fermented with lactic acid bacteria (Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus acidophilus) and bifidobacteria (Bifidobacterium infantis, Bifidobacterium longum) both individually and simultaneously. Mutagenicity and the suppression of fermented soymilk against the mutagenesis induced by 4-nitroquinoline-N-oxide (4-NQO), a direct-acting mutagen, and 3,2'-dimethyl-4-amino-biphenyl (DMAB), an indirect-acting mutagen, on Salmonella typhimurium TA 100, was then investigated. It was found that the fermented soymilk shows no mutagenic activity on Sal. typhimurium TA 100. Fermentation, in general, significantly (p<0.05) enhanced the antimutagenicity of soymilk. The levels of increased antimutagenicity of fermented soymilk varied with the starter organism and the type of mutagen tested. Although unfermented soymilk exerted lower antimutagenic activity against DMAB than 4-NQO, the fermented soymilk, generally, showed a higher antimutagenic activity against DMAB than 4-NQO. Among the various fermented soymilk tested, soymilk fermented with both Str. themophilus and B. infantis simultaneously exhibited the highest antimutagenicity of 85.07% and 85.78%, respectively, against 4-NQO and DMAB Further investigation on this fermented soymilk revealed that both the antimutagenic factors formed during fermentation and the cells of the starter organisms contributed to the increased antimutagenic activity against DMAB, while the former led to the increased activity against 4-NQO.
TI  - Manganese transport and the role of manganese in virulence.
AB  - Two areas of research have recently converged to highlight important roles for Mn(2+) in pathogenesis: the recognition that both bacterial Nramp homologs and members of LraI family of proteins are Mn(2+) transporters. Their mutation is associated with decreased virulence of various bacterial species. Thus, Mn(2+) appears to be essential for bacterial virulence. This review describes what is currently known about Mn(2+) transport in prokaryotes and how prokaryotic Mn(2+) transport is regulated. Some of the phenotypes that arise when microorganisms lack Mn(2+) are then discussed, with an emphasis on those phenotypes involving pathogenesis. The concluding section describes possible enzymatic roles for Mn(2+) that might help explain why Mn(2+) is necessary for virulence.
TI  - Immunogenicity of Salmonella vector vaccines expressing SBR of Streptococcus mutans under the control of a T7-nirB (dual) promoter system.
AB  - The purpose of the present study was to determine if a Salmonella vector expressing the cloned saliva-binding region (SBR) of Streptococcus mutans or SBR linked to the A2 and B subunits of cholera toxin (CTA2/B) under the control of both the T7 and nirB promoters (T7-nirB dual promoter) was more effective in inducing mucosal and systemic anti-SBR antibody responses than Salmonella clones expressing the same antigens but under the control of either the nirB or T7 promoter. Mice were immunized by the intranasal route on days 0, 18 and 320 with Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium strain BRD 509 containing one of six plasmids encoding SBR or SBR-CTA2/B under the control of the T7-nirB, T7, or nirB promoter. Serum, saliva and vaginal wash samples were collected throughout the experiment and assessed for antibody activity by ELISA. Evidence is provided that Salmonella clones expressing SBR or SBR-CAT2/B under the control of either the T7 or T7-nirB promoter induced a high and persistent mucosal and systemic anti-SBR antibody response. All Salmonella clones induced good anti-SBR responses following the boost on day 320.
TI  - TLR4-dependent hepcidin expression by myeloid cells in response to bacterial pathogens.
AB  - Hepcidin is an antimicrobial peptide secreted by the liver during inflammation that plays a central role in mammalian iron homeostasis. Here we demonstrate the endogenous expression of hepcidin by macrophages and neutrophils in vitro and in vivo. These myeloid cell types produced hepcidin in response to bacterial pathogens in a toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-dependent fashion. Conversely, bacterial stimulation of macrophages triggered a TLR4-dependent reduction in the iron exporter ferroportin. In vivo, intraperitoneal challenge with Pseudomonas aeruginosa induced TLR4-dependent hepcidin expression and iron deposition in splenic macrophages, findings mirrored in subcutaneous infection with group A Streptococcus where hepcidin induction was further observed in neutrophils migrating to the tissue site of infection. Hepcidin expression in cultured hepatocytes or in the livers of mice infected with bacteria was independent of TLR4, suggesting the TLR4-hepcidin pathway is restricted to myeloid cell types. Our findings identify endogenous myeloid cell hepcidin production as a previously unrecognized component of the host response to bacterial pathogens.
TI  - Feline cholecystitis and acute neutrophilic cholangitis: clinical findings, bacterial isolates and response to treatment in six cases.
AB  - Clinicopathological findings from six cats with confirmed cholecystitis or acute  neutrophilic cholangitis are presented. Historical findings included lethargy and anorexia or inappetence of up to five days duration. On physical examination all cats were pyrexic and four out of six were jaundiced and had cranial abdominal pain. Bile samples were obtained by cholecystocentesis at exploratory coeliotomy (two cases) or by percutaneous, ultrasound-guided cholecystocentesis (four cases). Gall bladder rupture and bile peritonitis occurred subsequent to ultrasound-guided cholecystocentesis in one case. The most common bacterial isolate was Escherichia coli (four cases); E coli was isolated alone in two cases, in combination with a Streptococcus species (one case) and in combination with a Clostridium species (one case). Streptococcus species alone was isolated from one case, as was Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. The latter is the first reported case of Salmonella-associated cholecystitis in a cat. Concurrent pancreatic or intestinal disease was detected histologically in three cases. All cases were treated with antimicrobials based on in vitro susceptibility results. Treatment was successful in five cases. One cat with concurrent diffuse epitheliotropic intestinal lymphoma was euthanased. Percutaneous ultrasound-guided cholecystocentesis is an effective, minimally-invasive technique enabling identification of bacterial isolates in cats with inflammatory hepatobiliary disease.
TI  - [Incidence and impact of HIV infection among patients with bacterial pleurisy in  Lome (Togo)].
AB  - A prospective study was made in the Tokoin university hospital in Lome (Togo) to  determine the incidence and the impact of HIV among patients with bacterial pleurisy. Two hundred cases of bacterial pleurisy were consecutively included over 17 months. The HIV diagnostic was performed using ELISA (Vironostika HIV Uni-Form II plus O and HIV1 and 2 Bispot Immunocomb II). The 200 cases of pleurisy included 152 (76%) tuberculous pleural effusion and 48 (24%) pleural empyema. Staphylococcus aureus (32%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (14.9%), and Pseudomonas (14.9%) were the main causes of pleural empyema. The HIV incidence was 61% (122/200). The mortality rate ranged from 26.2% in the HIV positive group to 5.1% in HIV negative group (P = 0.0001). The bacterial aspect of pleural empyema was heterogeneous in both groups but Salmonella Enteritidis and Salmonella Typhimurium were identified only among patients with HIV.
TI  - In vitro inhibitory activities of essential oils from two Korean thymus species against antibiotic-resistant pathogens.
AB  - The in vitro inhibitory activities of essential oils from Thymus magnus and T. quinquecostatus as well as their main constituents were evaluated against susceptible and resistant species of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella enteritidis, and Salmonella typhimurium. Notably, the essential oil fraction of T. magnus and its main components displayed significant inhibitory action against both antibiotic-susceptible and resistant strains of S. pneumoniae, S. aureus, and S. typhimurium with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) ranging from 0.125 to 8 mg/mL. The differential MIC values imply that the oil fraction and its main components exhibit distinct patterns of activity against the tested bacterial species. Moreover, the disk diffusion test revealed that the inhibitory activities of oil fraction and components were dose-dependent. Data from the checkerboard titer test confirmed synergism between the antibiotic, norfloxacin, and T. magnus oil or thymol, particularly against the resistant strains of S. aureus.
TI  - Investigations on anti-Aspergillus properties of bacterial products.
AB  - AIMS: To investigate the anti-Aspergillus properties of bacterial products. METHODS AND RESULTS: In the present study, 12 bacterial strains were screened for antifungal activity against Aspergilli. The culture supernatant and lysates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli (BL21, DH5alpha, HB101, XL Blue), Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptomyces thermonitrificans, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella typhi were examined for antifungal activity in protein concentration ranging from 1000.0 to 7.8 microg ml-1 using microbroth dilution assay. The lysate of Salm. typhi and E. coli BL21 exhibited the maximum activity against Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus niger. Their in vitro minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were found to be 15.6-31.2 microg ml-1 by microbroth dilution and spore germination inhibition assays. In disc diffusion assay, a concentration of 3.1 microg disc-1 of Salm. typhi lysate showed significant activity against Aspergilli. Escherichia coli BL21 exhibited similar activity at 6.2 microg disc-1. The work on identification of molecule endowed with antimycotic properties is in progress. CONCLUSION: The products of Salm. typhi and E. coli demonstrated significant activity against Aspergillus species. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This is the first time that E. coli has been reported for anti-Aspergillus activity. It could be an important source of biologically active compounds useful for developing better new antifungal drugs/or probiotics.
TI  - NMR assays for carbohydrate-based vaccines.
AB  - Antibodies against the cell surface carbohydrates of many microbial pathogens protect against infection. This was initially exploited by the development of purified polysaccharide vaccines, but glycoconjugate vaccines, in which the cell surface carbohydrate of a microbial pathogen is covalently attached to an appropriate carrier protein, are proving the most effective means to generate this protective immunity. Carbohydrate-based vaccines against Haemophilus influenzae Type b, Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi (S. Typhi) are already licensed, and many similar products are in various stages of development. For many of these vaccines, biological assays are not available or are inappropriate and NMR spectroscopy is proving a valuable tool for the characterisation and quality control of existing and novel products. This review highlights some of the areas in which NMR spectroscopy is currently used, and where further developments may be expected.
TI  - Role of the AcrAB-TolC efflux pump in determining susceptibility of Haemophilus influenzae to the novel peptide deformylase inhibitor LBM415.
AB  - Haemophilus influenzae isolates vary widely in their susceptibilities to the peptide deformylase inhibitor LBM415 (MIC range, 0.06 to 32 microg/ml); however, on average, they are less susceptible than gram-positive organisms, such as Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Insertional inactivation of the H. influenzae acrB or tolC gene in strain NB65044 (Rd strain KW20) increased susceptibility to LBM415, confirming a role for the AcrAB-TolC pump in determining resistance. Consistent with this, sequencing of a PCR fragment generated with primers flanking the acrRA region from an LBM415-hypersusceptible H. influenzae clinical isolate revealed a genetic deletion of acrA. Inactivation of acrB or tolC in several clinical isolates with atypically reduced susceptibility to LBM415 (MIC of 16 microg/ml or greater) significantly increased susceptibility, confirming that the pump is also a determinant of decreased susceptibility in these clinical isolates. Examination of acrR, encoding the putative repressor of pump gene expression, from several of these strains revealed mutations introducing frameshifts, stop codons, and amino acid changes relative to the published sequence, suggesting that loss of pump repression leads to decreased susceptibility. Supporting this, NB65044 acrR mutants selected by exposure to LBM415 at 8 microg/ml had susceptibilities to LBM415 and other pump substrates comparable to the least sensitive clinical isolates and showed increased expression of pump genes.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of blood isolates from a teaching hospital in north India.
AB  - Bloodstream infections are associated with significant patient morbidity and mortality worldwide. In this study, we examined antimicrobial susceptibility patterns by reviewing the data on 5,704 blood samples that were collected from patients with fever/sepsis admitted to Government Medical College and Hospital, Chandigarh, India, over a period of 1 year from August 2003 to July 2004. Among the 567 qualifying samples, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (19.75%), Escherichia coli (15.17%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (14.99%), and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (12.87%) were the most frequently isolated Gram-negative bacteria other than Citrobacter, Acinetobacter, Proteus, and Enterobacter spp. collectively accounting for 80.96% of the isolates. Staphylococus aureus (13.86%) and Enterococcus feacalis (2.35%) were most frequently isolated Gram-positive bacteria other than other Streptococcus and Staphylococcus spp. collectively accounting for 18% of the isolates. Among the antibiotics used for susceptibility testing of Gram-negative isolates, amikacin showed higher activity (76.61%) against Enterobacteriaceae and ciprofloxacin (65.17%) against non-fermenters. However, cefoperazone + sulbactum showed the highest activity (82.66%) among all Gram-negative isolates. For Gram-positive isolates, vancomycin (100%), ciprofloxacin (89.74%) showed the highest activity against Staphylococcus spp. Combinations of antibiotics are often prescribed as emperic therapy for bacteremia, especially for Gram-negative pathogens. Hence the antibiotic susceptibility patterns of blood isolates reported here may be a useful guide for physicians initiating emperic therapy with antibiotics.
TI  - Host-pathogen interactions: a proteomic view.
AB  - Host-pathogen interactions reflect the balance of host defenses and pathogen virulence mechanisms. Advances in proteomic technologies now afford opportunities to compare protein content between complex biologic systems ranging from cells to animals and clinical samples. Thus, it is now possible to characterize host-pathogen interactions from a global proteomic view. Most reports to date focus on cataloging protein content of pathogens and identifying virulence-associated proteins or proteomic alterations in host response. A more in-depth understanding of host-pathogen interactions has the potential to improve our mechanistic understanding of pathogenicity and virulence, thereby defining novel therapeutic and vaccine targets. In addition, proteomic characterization of the host response can provide pathogen-specific host biomarkers for rapid pathogen detection and characterization, as well as for early and specific detection of infectious diseases. A review of host-pathogen interactions focusing on proteomic analyses of both pathogen and host will be presented. Relevant genomic studies and host model systems will be also be discussed.
TI  - The glucosyl-1-phosphate transferase WchA (Cap8E) primes the capsular polysaccharide repeat unit biosynthesis of Streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 8.
AB  - The gene wchA (cap8E) belongs to the cps8 locus that is involved in biosynthesis  of the capsular polysaccharide (CPS) repeat unit (RU) of the virulent Streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 8. We report here the biochemical characterization of the membrane-associated protein WchA (Cap8E), overexpressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)/pLysS. Our results demonstrate that the recombinant enzyme transfers in vitro a glucosyl-1-phosphate from UDP-glucose to an endogenous phosphoryl-polyprenol, thereby priming the RU biosynthetic pathway of S. pneumoniae CPS 8. We also show that the C-terminal half of WchA is the glycosyltransferase domain as observed for the galactosyl-1-phosphate transferase WbaP from Salmonella enterica, previously described to prime the first step of O-antigen biosynthesis. These results demonstrate that WchA plays a prominent function in the capsule biosynthesis and explain the key role it occupies in the pneumococcal capsule variation.
TI  - Bacterial defenses against oxidants: mechanistic features of cysteine-based peroxidases and their flavoprotein reductases.
AB  - Antioxidant defenses include a group of ubiquitous, non-heme peroxidases, designated the peroxiredoxins, which rely on an activated cysteine residue at their active site to catalyze the reduction of hydrogen peroxide, organic hydroperoxides, and peroxynitrite. In the typical 2-Cys peroxiredoxins, a second cysteinyl residue, termed the resolving cysteine, is also involved in intersubunit disulfide bond formation during the course of catalysis by these enzymes. Many bacteria also express a flavoprotein, AhpF, which acts as a dedicated disulfide reductase to recycle the bacterial peroxiredoxin, AhpC, during catalysis. Mechanistic and structural studies of these bacterial proteins have shed light on the linkage between redox state, oligomeric state, and peroxidase activity for the peroxiredoxins, and on the conformational changes accompanying catalysis by both proteins. In addition, these studies have highlighted the dual roles that the oxidized cysteinyl species, cysteine sulfenic acid, can play in eukaryotic peroxiredoxins, acting as a catalytic intermediate in the peroxidase activity, and as a redox sensor in regulating hydrogen peroxide-mediated cell signaling.
TI  - Phages and the evolution of bacterial pathogens: from genomic rearrangements to lysogenic conversion.
AB  - Comparative genomics demonstrated that the chromosomes from bacteria and their viruses (bacteriophages) are coevolving. This process is most evident for bacterial pathogens where the majority contain prophages or phage remnants integrated into the bacterial DNA. Many prophages from bacterial pathogens encode virulence factors. Two situations can be distinguished: Vibrio cholerae, Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, and Clostridium botulinum depend on a specific prophage-encoded toxin for causing a specific disease, whereas Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium harbor a multitude of prophages and each phage-encoded virulence or fitness factor makes an incremental contribution to the fitness of the lysogen. These prophages behave like "swarms" of related prophages. Prophage diversification seems to be fueled by the frequent transfer of phage material by recombination with superinfecting phages, resident prophages, or occasional acquisition of other mobile DNA elements or bacterial chromosomal genes. Prophages also contribute to the diversification of the bacterial genome architecture. In many cases, they actually represent a large fraction of the strain-specific DNA sequences. In addition, they can serve as anchoring points for genome inversions. The current review presents the available genomics and biological data on prophages from bacterial pathogens in an evolutionary framework.
TI  - [Purulent pericarditis with pericardial tamponade caused by Streptococcus agalactiae and Salmonella enterica no typhi].
AB  - Purulent pericarditis (PP) is an uncommon condition with high mortality. In the preantibiotic period, Staphyloccocus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae were the most common etiologic agents. We describe the case of a 75-year old man with septic shock, PP and cardiac tamponade caused by Streptococcus agalactiae and Salmonella enterica no-typhi. To our knowledge this association of pathogenic organisms has not been previously reported in the literature. The pathogenesis is here reviewed, and in our patient presumably, purulent pericarditis occurred via hematogeneus spread undergoing upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. The patient's course was complicated and he died on 34th hospital day. After this case report it is considered that differential etiologic diagnosis of PP should include these agents, especially in immunodepressed patients with predisposing factors.
TI  - Application of oligonucleotide array technology for the rapid detection of pathogenic bacteria of foodborne infections.
AB  - A rapid and accurate method for detection for common pathogenic bacteria in foodborne infections was established by using oligonucleotide array technology. Nylon membrane was used as the array support. A mutation region of the 23S rRNA gene was selected as the discrimination target from 14 species (genera) of bacteria causing foodborne infections and two unrelated bacterial species. A pair of universal primers was designed for PCR amplification of the 23S rRNA gene. Twenty-one species (genera)-specific oligonucleotide detection probes were synthesized and spotted onto the nylon membranes. The 23S rRNA gene amplification products of 14 species of pathogenic bacteria were hybridized to the oligonucleotide array. Hybridization results were analyzed with digoxigenin-linked enzyme reaction. Results indicated that nine species of pathogenic bacteria (Escherichia coli, Campylobacter jejuni, Shigella dysenteriae, Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Proteus vulgaris, Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes and Clostridium botulinum) showed high sensitivity and specificity for the oligonucleotide array. Two other species (Salmonella enterica and Yersinia enterocolitica) gave weak cross-reaction with E. coli, but the reaction did not affect their detection. After redesigning the probes, positive hybridization results were obtained with Staphylococcus aureus, but not with Clostridium perfringens and Streptococcus pyogenes. The oligonucleotide array can also be applied to samples collected in clinical settings of foodborne infections. The superiority of oligonucleotide array over other tests lies on its rapidity, accuracy and efficiency in the diagnosis, treatment and control of foodborne infections.
TI  - The etiology of febrile illness in adults presenting to Patan hospital in Kathmandu, Nepal.
AB  - In Nepal, many infections remain poorly characterized, partly due to limited diagnostic facilities. We studied consecutive febrile adults presenting to a general hospital in Kathmandu, Nepal. Of the 876 patients enrolled, enteric fever and pneumonia were the most common clinical diagnoses. Putative pathogens were identified in 323 (37%) patients, the most common being Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi and S. enterica serotype Paratyphi A (117), Rickettsia typhi (97), Streptococcus pneumoniae (53), Leptospira spp. (36), and Orientia tsutsugamushi (28). Approximately half of the Salmonella isolates were resistant to nalidixic acid. No clinical predictors were identified to reliably distinguish between the different infections. These findings confirm the heavy burden of enteric fever and pneumonia in Kathmandu, and highlight the importance of murine typhus, scrub typhus, and leptospirosis. Given the lack of reliable clinical predictors, the development of cheap and accurate diagnostic tests are likely to be of great clinical utility in this setting.
TI  - Efficacy of vaccines against bacterial diseases in swine: what can we expect?
AB  - This paper discusses what can be expected with regard to efficacy of antibacterial vaccines used in swine, based on the present knowledge of pathogen-host interactions. First, vaccination against bacteria that mainly cause disease by production of exotoxins is considered. Vaccines containing the inactivated toxin or a non-toxic but antigenic recombinant protein derived from the exotoxin can be expected to provide protection against disease. The degree of protection induced by such vaccines varies, however, depending amongst other things on the pathogenesis of the disease. Vaccination against clostridial infections, Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae infections, progressive atrophic rhinitis and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, is considered. The second part of the article deals with vaccination against extracellular bacteria. Protection against these bacteria is generally mediated by antibodies against their surface antigens and certain secreted antigens, but cellular immunity may also play a role. Efficacy of vaccines against swine erysipelas, Streptococcus suis infections, Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae infections and swine dysentery is discussed. Finally, vaccination against facultatively intracellular bacteria is considered. For protection against these bacteria cell-mediated immunity plays an important role, but antibodies may also be involved. It is generally accepted that live-attenuated vaccines are more suitable for induction of cell-mediated immunity than inactivated vaccines, although this also depends on the adjuvant used in the vaccine. As an example, vaccination against Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium is discussed.
TI  - Testing two Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus acidophilus strains for their suitability as a lipoid probiotic.
AB  - Two strains of lactobacilli (Lactobacillus acidophilus T-135 and Lactobacillus plantarum 4/97) were selected in order to study their inhibitory properties against frequent udder pathogens (Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus uberis, Salmonella enteritidis and Bacillus pumilus), their production of organic acids as well as their ability to survive on the teat skin, the teat duct mucosa and in a lipoid emulsion. Both strains inhibited the tested pathogenic microbes and survived on the investigated surfaces and in an emulsion for more than 6 hours and 11 days, respectively.
TI  - Bacterial responses to neutrophil phagocytosis.
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review focuses on adaptive bacterial interactions with neutrophils, emphasizing information communicated within the past year about bacterial factors that respond to contact with or phagocytosis by PMN. RECENT FINDINGS: Since the discovery of type III and IV secretion, progress in the analysis of bacterial interactions with host phagocytes has been extensive but largely focused on the macrophage. The remarkable growth of information about bacterial subversion of macrophage metabolism has been summarized in several excellent reviews. The scope of progress on neutrophil-bacteria interactions is more limited and dominated by recent studies of the granulocyte pathogen, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, the agent of granulocytic ehrlichiosis. SUMMARY: For many pathogens, contact with or ingestion by phagocytes elicits a vigorous but varied microbial response. The response repertoire includes activation of type III and type IV secretion systems that inject effector molecules into the host cell. Effectors modify host cell signaling and metabolic pathways to favor survival of the microbe. Whereas microbial secretory structures are few in kind and relatively conserved, effector molecules are numerous and variable. Effectors may promote phagocytosis by nonphagocytic cells or suppress phagocytosis by macrophages and neutrophils. They may suppress assembly or misdirect localization of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase that is responsible for generating toxic oxidants, and they may suppress phagosome-lysosome fusion. Phagocytosed bacteria may also up-regulate the expression of defensive proteins that attenuate the effects of phagocyte-derived antimicrobial toxins. These pathogenic stratagems probably have their origins in the competition among single-celled organisms, eukaryotes versus prokaryotes, that arose early in evolution.
TI  - Bacterial polysaccharides as vaccines--immunity and chemical characterization.
AB  - Studies on protective immunity and biochemical characterization of bacterial capsular polysaccharides have led to significant contributions to understanding of the mechanisms of infectious diseases and development of effective vaccines. Immunity to encapsulated bacteria is related to antibody response to polysaccharide (PS) antigen, interactions with T- and B-lymphocytes, and host defense mechanisms. Meningococcal, pneumococcal and Salmonella vi PSs and Haemophilus type b PS-protein conjugate vaccines have been licensed and provided effective immunity for prevention of these bacterial infections. Capsular PSs are cell-surface polymers consisting of oligosaccharide repeating units. Many PSs are highly polar and hydrophilic and interfere with cell-to-cell interactions with phagocytes. Most pneumococcal PSs are negatively charged and possess acidic components such as D-glucuronic acid and phosphate in phosphodiester bonds. Extensive immunologic cross-reactivity has been observed among bacterial capsular PSs. In infants the antibody responses to most capsular PSs are generally poor. Enhanced immunogenicity of PS antigens can be achieved through PS-protein conjugate vaccines, immunization during a critical period of perinatal development and effective antigen delivery system.
TI  - M1 protein triggers a phosphoinositide cascade for group A Streptococcus invasion of epithelial cells.
AB  - Invasion of nonphagocytic cells by bacteria provides a favorable niche for persistence and evasion of host defenses and antibiotics. M protein is a major virulence factor because it promotes high-frequency invasion of epithelial cells by group A Streptococcus (GAS) and also renders the bacterium resistant to phagocytosis. In this study, we investigated the role of M1 protein from serotype M1 strain 90-226 in regulating mammalian signal transduction and cytoskeletal rearrangement for bacterial entry. LY294002 and wortmannin, which are inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-K) blocked invasion of epithelial cells by GAS by 75 and 80%, respectively, but failed to inhibit invasion by Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. Also, epithelial cells transiently transfected with dominant negative p85 and p110 genes, the regulatory and catalytic subunits of PI 3-K, respectively, were less able to be invaded by GAS. To separate the influence of other streptococcal virulence factors from M protein, Lactococcus lactis was engineered to express M1 protein on its surface. L. lactis(pLM1) invaded epithelial cells efficiently in vitro, and PI 3-K inhibitors blocked 90% of this invasion. Purified soluble M1 protein stimulated the formation of stress fibers and actin tuffs on epithelial cells. LY294002 and wortmannin inhibited these cellular changes. A phosphoinositide analogue also inhibited the invasion of epithelial cells by GAS. Therefore, M1 protein, either directly or via bound fibronectin, initiates signals that depend on the lipid kinase PI 3-K pathway, which paves the way for cytoskeletal rearrangement that internalize the bacterium.
TI  - Activity of faropenem and imipenem for ciprofloxacin-resistant bacteria.
AB  - AIM: To determine whether an association exists between ciprofloxacin and faropenem resistance in bacteria including multiply drug-resistant isolates. METHODS: The MICs were determined for 150 fluoroquinolone-resistant bacteria, plus 20 nalidixic acid-resistant strains of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. RESULTS: Faropenem was very active against Escherichia coli and Streptococcus pneumoniae, but 5/31 Staphylococcus aureus and 2/26 Bacteroides fragilis required > or =16 mg/L for inhibition. Of 30 multiply drug-resistant isolates with a phenotype suggestive of enhanced efflux, only for one strain (a Bacteroides fragilis) was the faropenem MIC higher than that associated with the other isolates of the same species. CONCLUSIONS: Faropenem was in general as active as imipenem. There was no association between resistance to ciprofloxacin and faropenem or imipenem resistance.
TI  - The role of mutators in the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
AB  - Bacteria contain a number of error prevention and error correction systems that maintain genome stability. However, strains exhibiting elevated mutation frequencies have recently been reported amongst natural populations of pathogenic Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Neisseria meningitidis, Helicobacter pylori and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The majority of naturally occurring, strong mutators contain defects in the methyl-directed mismatch repair (MMR) system, with mutations in mutS predominating. MMR-deficient strains possess superior genetic backgrounds for the selection of some antibiotic-resistance mutations since mutation frequencies up to 1000-fold higher than normal strains have been reported, and resistance levels achieved in mutators can be greater than those arising in non-mutator hosts. MMR is a major constraint to interspecies recombination events. Removal of this barrier, as in the case of MMR defective mutators, also enhances the frequency of horizontal gene transfer, which is an important mechanism of acquired drug resistance in bacteria. Permanent global mutator status is associated with loss of fitness as mutators accumulate deleterious mutations more frequently than non-mutators. Fitness limitations of mutators may be overcome simply by the high bacterial cell densities that can be achieved during acute infection or by the adoption of transient mutator status. Mutators are a risk factor during the treatment of bacterial infections as they appear to enhance the selection of mutants expressing high- and low-level antibiotic resistance and have the capacity to refine existing plasmid-located resistance determinants.
TI  - Adrenomedullin expression by gastric epithelial cells in response to infection.
AB  - Many surface epithelial cells express adrenomedullin, a multifunctional peptide found in a wide number of body and cell systems. Recently, we and others have proposed that adrenomedullin has an important novel role in host defense. This peptide has many properties in common with other cationic antimicrobial peptides, including the human beta-defensins. Upon exposure of human gastric epithelial cells to viable cells of invasive or noninvasive strains of Helicobacter pylori, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, or Streptococcus bovis, a significant increase in adrenomedullin secretion from these cells was demonstrated. Adrenomedullin gene expression was also increased in response to these microorganisms. Similar observations were noted when these cells were incubated with proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin 1 alpha (IL-1 alpha), IL-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha and lipopolysaccharide. In cultured cells and an animal infection model, increased adrenomedullin peptide and gene expression was demonstrated when exposed to E. coli or Mycobacterium paratuberculosis, respectively. The data suggest there is a strong association between epithelial infection, inflammation, and adrenomedullin expression, which may have clinical relevance. The regulation of adrenomedullin expression may have therapeutic applications, such as improving or enhancing mucosal immunity.
TI  - Immune responses dependent on antigen location in recombinant attenuated Salmonella typhimurium vaccines following oral immunization.
AB  - The subcellular location of a recombinant antigen in recombinant attenuated Salmonella vaccines may influence immunogenicity dependent on exposure of the recombinant antigen to cells involved in systemic immune responses. It has been shown that a recombinant attenuated Salmonella vaccine secreting the recombinant Streptococcus pneumoniae PspA (rPspA) antigen specified by pYA3494 induced protective anti-rPspA-specific immune responses (Kang et al. (2002) Infect. Immun. 70, 1739-1749). A recombinant plasmid pYA3496 specifying a His(6)-tagged rPspA (His(6)-rPspA) protein (no apparent signal sequence) caused the rPspA antigen to localize to the cytoplasm of Salmonella. Salmonella vaccines carrying pYA3494 or pYA3496 expressed similar amounts of rPspA. After a single oral immunization in BALB/c mice with 10(9) colony-forming units (CFU) of the recombinant Salmonella vaccines carrying pYA3494 or pYA3496, IgG antibody responses were stimulated to both rPspA and Salmonella lipopolysaccharide (LPS) antigens. The anti-rPspA IgG titer induced by Salmonella carrying pYA3494 (1.9 x 10(7)) was 10(4) times higher than induced by Salmonella carrying pYA3496 (<2.4 x 10(3)).
TI  - The World Health Organization's External Quality Assurance System Proficiency Testing Program has improved the accuracy of antimicrobial susceptibility testing and reporting among participating laboratories using NCCLS methods.
AB  - A total of 150 laboratories in 33 countries that followed the NCCLS testing procedures participated in the World Health Organization's External Quality Assurance System for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EQAS-AST) from January 1998 through March 2001. Laboratories tested seven bacterial isolates for antimicrobial resistance and reported the results to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, Ga. The results were compared to the results generated at the CDC with the NCCLS broth microdilution and disk diffusion reference methods. Although there were few testing errors with Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Enteritidis, drugs that are not appropriate for therapy of Salmonella infections were tested and reported by 136 (91%) of 150 laboratories. In addition, 29 (20%) of 150 laboratories used the Staphylococcus aureus breakpoints to report oxacillin results for Staphylococcus saprophyticus. For a vanB-containing Enterococcus faecalis strain, 124 (83%) of 150 laboratories correctly reported vancomycin results that were +/-1 doubling dilution from the reference MIC or +/-3 mm from the reference disk diffusion result. Of the laboratories that tested Streptococcus agalactiae by disk diffusion, 17% reported nonsusceptible results for penicillin in error. While 110 laboratories (73%) tested the S. pneumoniae challenge isolate against a fluoroquinolone, 83% tested it against ciprofloxacin, for which there are no NCCLS interpretive criteria. Ten of 12 laboratories testing levofloxacin and 4 of 4 laboratories testing ofloxacin by an MIC method correctly reported resistant results for the isolate. Feedback letters sent to participating laboratories highlighted areas of susceptibility testing in individual laboratories that needed improvement. The positive impact of the feedback letters and the overall effectiveness of the EQAS program were documented in repeat testing challenges with pneumococci and staphylococci. The 31 and 19% increases in the numbers of laboratories using appropriate testing methods for pneumococci and staphylococci, respectively, in 2000 versus 1998 indicate that laboratory performance is improving.
TI  - [Recombinant Salmonella typhimurium anticaries vaccine. II. Construction and confirmation of expressing plasmid carrying a region of S. mutans pac gene].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to construct prokaryotic expressing plasmids carrying A region of S. mutans pac gene. METHODS: The A region of pac gene was amplified by using PCR from plasmid pPC41 containing S. mutans surface protein pac gene. The new expression plasmid was constructed by using A region of pac gene and expressing plasmids pET17-b and directed cloning technique. The recombinant plasmid was identified by agarose gel electrophoresis after it was cut by using BamHI and EcoRV. RESULTS: The expressing plasmid carrying pac gene A region was acquired. CONCLUSION: The recombinant plasmid provides useful experimental materials for further research work.
TI  - Common themes among bacteriophage-encoded virulence factors and diversity among the bacteriophages involved.
AB  - There are common themes among bacteriophage-encoded virulence factors, which include the well-characterized bacterial toxins and proteins that alter antigenicity as well as several new classes of bacteriophage-encoded proteins such as superantigens, effectors translocated by a type III secretion system, and proteins required for intracellular survival and host cell attachment. These virulence factors are encoded by a diversity of bacteriophages, members of the viral families Siphoviridae, Podoviridae, Myoviridae and Inoviridae, with some bacteriophages having characteristics of more than one virus family. The location of virulence genes within the bacteriophage genomes is non-random and consistent with an origin via imprecise prophage excision or as either transferable cassettes or integral components of the bacteriophage genome.
TI  - Prevalence of antimicrobial resistance among pigeon isolates of Streptococcus gallolyticus, Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium.
AB  - Thirty-three Streptococcus gallolyticus, 60 Escherichia coli and 18 Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium var. Copenhagen strains isolated from homing pigeons (Columba livia) were tested for susceptibility to the antimicrobials most commonly used to treat pigeons. Minimal inhibitory concentrations were determined using the agar dilution technique. Aminoglycosides (gentamicin and kanamycin), trimethoprim and flumequine were relatively inactive against the streptococci tested. Acquired tetracycline resistance amounted to 85%, and lincomycin and macrolide (erythromycin) resistance to 48 and 45%, respectively. Fluoroquinolone (enrofloxacin) resistance was found in four S. gallolyticus strains. All strains were susceptible to ampicillin. With the E. coli strains, resistance was found to all antibiotics tested. Over one-half of them were resistant to tetracycline and to broad-spectrum penicillins (ampicillin); however, none showed extended spectrum beta-lactamase activity, implying that the cephalosporins (ceftiofur) remained active. Resistance to trimethoprim, aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolone ranked next. In contrast to the S. gallolyticus and E. coli strains, the S. enterica strains were susceptible to all the antimicrobials tested.
TI  - Hydrogen peroxide-mediated killing of Caenorhabditis elegans by Streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  - Caenorhabditis elegans is currently introduced as a new, facile, and cheap model  organism to study the pathogenesis of gram-negative bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. The mechanisms of killing involve either diffusible exotoxins or infection-like processes. Recently, it was shown that also some gram-positive bacteria kill C. elegans, although the precise mechanisms of killing remained open. We examined C. elegans as a pathogenesis model for the gram-positive bacterium Streptococcus pyogenes, a major human pathogen capable of causing a wide spectrum of diseases. We demonstrate that S. pyogenes kills C. elegans, both on solid and in liquid medium. Unlike P. aeruginosa and S. enterica serovar Typhimurium, the killing by S. pyogenes is solely mediated by hydrogen peroxide. Killing required live streptococci; the killing capacity depends on the amount of hydrogen peroxide produced, and killing can be inhibited by catalase. Major exotoxins of S. pyogenes are not involved in the killing process as confirmed by using specific toxin inhibitors and knockout mutants. Moreover, no accumulation of S. pyogenes in C. elegans is observed, which excludes the involvement of infection-like processes. Preliminary results show that S. pneumoniae can also kill C. elegans by hydrogen peroxide production. Hydrogen peroxide-mediated killing might represent a common mechanism by which gram-positive, catalase-negative pathogens kill C. elegans.
TI  - Biodegradable microparticles for the mucosal delivery of antibacterial and dietary antigens.
AB  - Mucosal administration of antigen is known to be appropriate for vaccine purposes as well as tolerance induction. Biodegradable poly(DL-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) microparticles were used to deliver both antibacterial phosphorylcholine (PC) and dietary antigen beta lactoglobulin (BLG) by mucosal route. In a first study, the protective immunity elicited by intragastric vaccination with PC encapsulated in microparticles was evaluated in a mouse model against intestinal infection by Salmonella typhimurium and pulmonary infection by Streptococcus pneumoniae. A significant rise in anti-PC immunoglobulin A (IgA) titers, as measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, was observed in the intestinal secretions after oral immunization with PC-loaded microparticles compared with the titers of mice immunized with free PC-thyr or blank microparticles. This antibody response correlated with a highly significant resistance to oral challenge by S. typhimurium. IgA in pulmonary secretion were not able to protect against S. pneumoniae infection. BALB/c mice were, therefore, immunized intranasally (i.n.). Immunization was followed by a rise in anti-PC IgA and IgG titers in serum and in pulmonary secretions by both free and encapsulated PC-Thyr. The survival rates were 91 and 76% in the two groups of mice, respectively. In a second study and in order to prevent allergy against milk by inducing oral tolerance, one of the major allergenic milk protein, BLG was entrapped into microparticles. Oral administration of microparticles containing BLG reduced significantly (by 10000) the amount of protein necessary to decrease both specific anti BLG IgE and DTH response. These studies demonstrate the ability of microparticles to induce both mucosal immunity and oral tolerance.
TI  - Isolation of Salmonella enterica serotype Worthington from a splenic abscess in a patient with chronic myeloid leukemia.
AB  - Splenic abscesses are caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus and bacteria belonging to the family Enterobacteriaceae. We report a case of splenic abscess caused by an unusual serotype of Salmonella. A 55 year old man was admitted with complaints of fever and abdominal pain. On the basis of clinical findings and laboratory reports, a diagnosis of chronic myeloid leukemia was made. Ultrasonography of the abdomen revealed a single large cystic lesion in the spleen. Percutaneous drainage of the abscess was carried out. Salmonella enterica serotype Worthington was isolated from a pus sample taken from the abscess. The isolate was resistant to ampicillin, gentamicin, cefotaxime, chloramphenicol and tetracycline, and sensitive to amikacin and norfloxacin. Serotype Worthington is an emerging pathogen. This is the first report of isolation of this serotype from a splenic abscess. In seriously ill patients, such infections should be treated with a combination of antibiotics to circumvent problems with multidrug resistance.
TI  - Immune responses to recombinant pneumococcal PspA antigen delivered by live attenuated Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium vaccine.
AB  - Attenuated Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium expressing recombinant antigens from other pathogens elicits primarily a Th1-type dominant immune response to both recombinant and Salmonella antigens. The immunogenicity and appropriate subcellular location of the recombinant antigen in the Salmonella vaccine strain may contribute to augmenting immune responses by facilitating adequate exposure of recombinant antigen to antigen-presenting cells for processing. To allow for secretion from gram-negative bacteria and overexpression of antigen, a DNA fragment encoding a highly antigenic alpha-helical region of PspA (pneumococcal surface protein A) was subcloned downstream from the beta-lactamase signal sequence in the multicopy Asd(+) pYA3493 vector to create pYA3494. pYA3493 was derived from a class of Asd(+) vectors with reduced expression of Asd to minimize selective disadvantage and enhance immunization of expressed recombinant antigens. The S. enterica serovar Typhimurium vaccine strain was constructed by the introduction of deletion mutations Delta crp-28 and Delta asdA16. Approximately 50% of the recombinant PspA (rPspA) expressed in a Salmonella strain harboring pYA3494 was detected in the combined supernatant and periplasmic fractions of broth-grown recombinant Salmonella. After a single oral immunization in BALB/c mice with 10(9) CFU of the recombinant Salmonella vaccine strain carrying pYA3494, immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody responses were stimulated to both the heterologous antigen rPspA and Salmonella lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and outer membrane proteins (OMPs). About half, and even more at later times after immunization, of the antibodies induced to rPspA were IgG1 (indicating a Th2-type response), whereas 60 to 70% of the antibodies to LPS and 80 to 90% of those to OMPs were IgG2a (indicating a Th1-type response). A sublethal infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae WU2 boosted PspA antibody levels and maintained IgG2a/IgG1 ratios similar to those seen before the challenge. Oral immunization with Salmonella-PspA vaccine protected 60% of immunized mice from death after intraperitoneal challenge with 50 times the 50% lethal dose of virulent S. pneumoniae WU2.
TI  - Toward a structural understanding of the dehydratase mechanism.
AB  - dTDP-D-glucose 4,6-dehydratase (RmlB) was first identified in the L-rhamnose biosynthetic pathway, where it catalyzes the conversion of dTDP-D-glucose into dTDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-D-glucose. The structures of RmlB from Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium in complex with substrate deoxythymidine 5'-diphospho-D-glucose (dTDP-D-glucose) and deoxythymidine 5'-diphosphate (dTDP), and RmlB from Streptococcus suis serotype 2 in complex with dTDP-D-glucose, dTDP, and deoxythymidine 5'-diphospho-D-pyrano-xylose (dTDP-xylose) have all been solved at resolutions between 1.8 A and 2.4 A. The structures show that the active sites are highly conserved. Importantly, the structures show that the active site tyrosine functions directly as the active site base, and an aspartic and glutamic acid pairing accomplishes the dehydration step of the enzyme mechanism. We conclude that the substrate is required to move within the active site to complete the catalytic cycle and that this movement is driven by the elimination of water. The results provide insight into members of the SDR superfamily.

TI  - Correlation of the antibacterial activities of cationic peptide antibiotics and cationic steroid antibiotics.
AB  - The antibacterial activities of cationic steroid antibiotics and cationic peptide antibiotics have been compared. Depolarization of bacterial membranes, activation of bacterial stress-related gene promoters, and changes in bacterial morphologies caused by these antibiotics suggest that cationic steroid and peptide antibiotics share mechanistic aspects. Modified cationic steroid antibiotics display improved selectivity for prokaryotic cells over eukaryotic cells presumably due to increased charge recognition.
TI  - Mouthrinses: a comparative microbiological study.
AB  - This study was performed in order to evaluate the efficacy of different mouthrinses whose use is extended in Spain. Six different antiseptic mouthrinses were studied by means of determination of Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) values against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella typhimurium, Bacillus subtilis, Streptococcus mutans, Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. Also in vivo experiments were carried out in volunteers by the use of mouthrinses and evaluation of bacterial populations before and after the treatment. Finally, the kinetics of bacterial death was determined. Results suggested that the determination of MIC values is not a reliable method to evaluate the antibacterial effect of such products. On the other hand those rinsing solutions based on the effect of oxygen, such as those containing carbamide peroxide have a greater efficacy against anaerobic bacteria compared with rinses whose active molecule is a disinfectant. Finally, the kinetics of bacterial death demonstrates that the essential oil rinse kills bacteria much faster. All tested mouthrinses were active as antibacterial although those based on oxygen production or essential oils were more active than solutions based on chlorhexidine and Triclosan.
TI  - Maintenance of an unfolded polypeptide by a cognate chaperone in bacterial type III secretion.
AB  - Many bacterial pathogens use a type III protein secretion system to deliver virulence effector proteins directly into the host cell cytosol, where they modulate cellular processes. A requirement for the effective translocation of several such effector proteins is the binding of specific cytosolic chaperones, which typically interact with discrete domains in the virulence factors. We report here the crystal structure at 1.9 A resolution of the chaperone-binding domain of the Salmonella effector protein SptP with its cognate chaperone SicP. The structure reveals that this domain is maintained in an extended, unfolded conformation that is wound around three successive chaperone molecules. Short segments from two different SptP molecules are juxtaposed by the chaperones, where they dimerize across a hydrophobic interface. These results imply that the chaperones associated with the type III secretion system maintain their substrates in a secretion-competent state that is capable of engaging the secretion machinery to travel through the type III apparatus in an unfolded or partially folded manner.
TI  - Effect of attenuated Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium expressing a Streptococcus mutans antigen on secondary responses to the cloned protein.
AB  - Attenuated Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium has been used for targeted delivery of recombinant antigens to gut- and nose-associated lymphoid tissues. Contradictory reports have described the effect of preexisting immunity to the antigen delivery vehicle. We decided to examine this discrepancy by studying the effect of immunizing mice by the intranasal (i.n.) route with Salmonella expressing an insoluble protein and to study the ability to augment recall responses by boosting with either Salmonella-expressed protein or purified soluble protein alone. The glucan-binding domain (GLU) of the enzyme glucosyltransferase (GTF), which is an important virulence factor of Streptococcus mutans, was recombinantly expressed in the insoluble phase in S. enterica serovar Typhimurium, and the immunogenicity of this construct was studied in mice. We examined the induction of primary immune responses by insoluble GLU polypeptide delivered in Salmonella at week 1 (groups 1 and 2) and recall responses after a week 15 boost with either Salmonella expressing GLU (group 1) or purified GLU polypeptide (groups 2 and 3). Group 4 served as the control and received phosphate-buffered saline alone by the i.n. route. Significant anti-GLU serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels were seen in groups 1, 2, and 3 at week 18 (P < 0.001), i.e., 3 weeks after the booster immunization. Mice in group 2, who received Salmonella followed by GLU, had the highest GLU-specific IgG levels among all groups. The serum IgG levels persisted in all responding groups for at least 7 weeks after the boost (week 22). The IgG2a/IgG1 subclass ratio of serum anti-GLU antibodies in group 1 significantly increased after the boost. These results support the induction of a type 1-like immune response to GLU after primary and booster immunizations with Salmonella expressing GLU. On the other hand, group 2 mice, which received Salmonella expressing GLU as the primary dose and soluble protein as the booster dose, exhibited a shift from a type 1-like to a more type 2-like immune response to GLU following the boost. These results indicate that S. enterica serovar Typhimurium is an excellent delivery vehicle for the insoluble and recombinantly expressed GLU of GTF and that this construct was especially effective in priming the host for a secondary response to soluble GLU polypeptide.
TI  - Conserved DegP protease in gram-positive bacteria is essential for thermal and oxidative tolerance and full virulence in Streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  - The DegP protease, a multifunctional chaperone and protease, has been shown to be essential for virulence in gram-negative pathogens such as Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Brucella abortus, Yersinia enterocolitica, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The function of DegP in pathogenesis appears to be the degradation of damaged proteins that accumulate as a result of the initial host response to infection, which includes the release of reactive oxygen intermediates. Additionally, the DegP protease plays a major role in monitoring and maintaining the Escherichia coli periplasm and influences E. coli pilus biogenesis. We report here the identification of highly homologous enzymes in Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis. Moreover, the phenotype of an insertionally inactivated degP allele in S. pyogenes is similar to that reported for E. coli, with temperature sensitivity for growth and enhanced sensitivity to reactive oxygen intermediates. Virulence studies in a mouse model of streptococcal infection indicate that a functional DegP protease is required for full virulence. These results suggest DegP as an attractive broad-spectrum target for future anti-infective drug development.
TI  - New antioxidant and antimicrobial ellagic acid derivatives from Pteleopsis hylodendron.
AB  - Bioassay-guided isolation of two new compounds, 3,4-methylenedioxy-3'-O-methyl-4'-O-glucoside ellagic acid (1) and the pteleoellagic acid derivative (2), from the stem bark of Pteleopsis hylodendron is reported along with 3,4-methylenedioxy-3'-O-methyl ellagic acid (3), 3,3'-di-O-methyl ellagic acid (4) and 3,3',4'-tri-O-methyl ellagic acid (5), which were obtained for the first time from this plant. The structures of these compounds were elucidated with the help of spectroscopic studies. Compounds 1 and 4 were found to have significant antioxidant activity, while compounds 1-4 showed antibacterial activity against different pathogenic bacteria.
TI  - Activities of cholic acid-derived antimicrobial agents against multidrug-resistant bacteria.
AB  - Cationic cholic acid derivatives displayed potent and broad-spectrum activity against multidrug-resistant Gram-negative and -positive bacteria. Specific examples were effective permeabilizers of the outer membranes of many strains of multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria and sensitized these to hydrophobic antibiotics. We also prepared a new cholic acid derivative with improved apparent selectivity for prokaryote membranes.
TI  - Induction of protective immunity against Streptococcus mutans colonization after  mucosal immunization with attenuated Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium expressing an S. mutans adhesin under the control of in vivo-inducible nirB promoter.
AB  - The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the effectiveness of an attenuated Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium vaccine strain expressing the saliva-binding region (SBR) of the Streptococcus mutans antigen I/II adhesin, either alone or linked with the mucosal adjuvant cholera toxin A2 and B subunits (CTA2/B) and under the control of the anaerobically inducible nirB promoter, in inducing a protective immune response against S. mutans infection. BALB/c mice were immunized by either the intranasal or the intragastric route with a single dose of 10(9) or 10(10) Salmonella CFU, respectively. The Salmonella vaccine strain expressing an unrelated antigen (fragment C of tetanus toxin [TetC]) was also used for immunization as a control. Samples of serum and secretion (saliva and vaginal washes) were collected prior to and following immunization and assessed for antibody activity by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Anti-SBR antibodies were detected in the serum and saliva of experimental animals by week 3 after immunization. A booster immunization at week 17 after the initial immunization resulted in enhanced immune responses to the SBR. The serum immunoglobulin G subclass profiles were indicative of T helper type 1 responses against both the vector and the SBR antigen. To determine the effectiveness of these responses on the protection against S. mutans infection, mice were challenged after the second immunization with a virulent strain of S. mutans which was resistant to tetracycline and erythromycin. Prior to the challenge, mice were treated for 5 days with tetracycline, erythromycin, and penicillin. S. mutans was initially recovered from all of the challenged mice. This bacterium persisted at high levels for at least 5 weeks in control TetC-immunized or nonimmunized mice despite the reappearance of indigenous oral organisms. However, mice immunized with Salmonella clones expressing SBR or SBR-CTA2/B demonstrated a significant reduction in the number of S. mutans present in plaque compared to the control groups. These results provide evidence for the effectiveness of the Salmonella vector in delivering the SBR antigen for the induction of mucosal and systemic immune responses to SBR. Furthermore, the induction of a salivary anti-SBR response corresponded with protection against S. mutans colonization of tooth surfaces.
TI  - Evaluation of avian-specific probiotic and Salmonella enteritidis-, Salmonella typhimurium-, and Salmonella heidelberg-specific antibodies on cecal colonization and organ invasion of Salmonella enteritidis in broilers.
AB  - Salmonella Enteritidis colonizes the intestinal tract of poultry and causes foodborne illness in humans. Reduction of Salmonella Enteritidis colonization in the intestinal tract of poultry reduces potential carcass contamination during slaughter. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of an avian-specific probiotic combined with Salmonella Enteritidis-, Salmonella Typhimurium-, and Salmonella Heidelberg-specific antibodies on the cecal colonization and organ invasion of Salmonella Enteritidis in broiler as well as on body weights. The treatment group was defined as chicks spray-vaccinated with Avian Pac Plus at the hatchery and given Avian Pac Plus for the first 3 days after placement. An intermediate treatment was given at 10 and 14 days, 2 days prior to vaccination and 2 days postvaccination. All birds were vaccinated with Newcastle disease vaccine, La Sota virus (one drop/eye) at 12 days of age. A final treatment was given 3 days preslaughter. The control group was defined as chicks not given Avian Pac Plus at any time. Six hours after oral administration of the probiotic suspension (treatment group) or water (control group) at placement, the chicks were challenged with Salmonella Enteritidis. All chickens were orally inoculated with 0.25 ml of Salmonella Enteritidis that contained 4 x 10(7) CFU/1.0 ml. Cecal colonization and organ invasion were evaluated for Salmonella Enteritidis on days 0, 1, 3, 7, 10, 17, 24, 31, 38, and 41. The probiotic-treated group had a significantly lower concentration of Salmonella Enteritidis cecal colonization at days 3, 7, 10, 17, 24, 31, 38, and 41 when compared to the nontreated, control group (P < 0.05). Similarly, there was a significant difference (P < 0.05) in the isolation of Salmonella Enteritidis from the internal organs (liver and spleen) when probiotic-treated and nonprobiotic-treated groups were compared. There was no significant difference (P > 0.05) in the mean body weight between the two experimental groups at each collection period. These results indicated that a combination of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Streptococcus faecium, and Salmonella Enteritidis, Salmonella Typhimurium, and Salmonella Heidelberg-Specific antibodies have a beneficial effect in reducing the colonization of Salmonella Enteritidis in market-aged broilers.
TI  - Molecular characterization of Streptococcus pneumoniae type 4, 6B, 8, and 18C capsular polysaccharide gene clusters.
AB  - Capsular polysaccharide (CPS) is a major virulence factor in Streptococcus pneumoniae. CPS gene clusters of S. pneumoniae types 4, 6B, 8, and 18C were sequenced and compared with those of CPS types 1, 2, 14, 19F, 19A, 23F, and 33F. All have the same four genes at the 5' end, encoding proteins thought to be involved in regulation and export. Sequences of these genes can be divided into two classes, and evidence of recombination between them was observed. Next is the gene encoding the transferase for the first step in the synthesis of CPS. The predicted amino acid sequences of these first sugar transferases have multiple transmembrane segments, a feature lacking in other transferases. Sugar pathway genes are located at the 3' end of the gene cluster. Comparison of the four dTDP-L-rhamnose pathway genes (rml genes) of CPS types 1, 2, 6B, 18C, 19F, 19A, and 23F shows that they have the same gene order and are highly conserved. There is a gradient in the nature of the variation of rml genes, the average pairwise difference for those close to the central region being higher than that for those close to the end of the gene cluster and, again, recombination sites can be observed in these genes. This is similar to the situation we observed for rml genes of O-antigen gene clusters of Salmonella enterica. Our data indicate that the conserved first four genes at the 5' ends and the relatively conserved rml genes at the 3' ends of the CPS gene clusters were sites for recombination events involved in forming new forms of CPS. We have also identified wzx and wzy genes for all sequenced CPS gene clusters by use of motifs.
TI  - [Microbiological monitoring of beach water: old and new parameters].
AB  - The survival of fecal coliforms, fecal streptococci, Salmonella enteritidis and Staphylococcus aureus in sea water (35@1000 salinity) in the dark and at room temperature was evaluated. Staphylococcus aureus has been regarded for a long time as the new parameter to add to the classic ones in order to define the quality and suitability to recreational use. At the sperimental condition considered the survival of fecal coliforms, fecal streptococci, Salmonella enteritidis, and Staphylococcus aureus resulted equal to 48 h, 88 h, 56 h, and 96 h respectively. Fecal coliforms resulted the most sensitive bacteria to osmotic shock while Staphylococcus aureus the most adaptable species. Our results seem to indicate the opportunity of reconsidering the microbiological parameters used for the control of beach water.
TI  - Borrelia burgdorferi and other bacterial products induce expression and release of the urokinase receptor (CD87).
AB  - The urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR, CD87) is a highly glycosylated 55- to 60-kDa protein anchored to the cell membrane through a glycosylphosphatidylinositol moiety that promotes the acquisition of plasmin on the surface of cells and subsequent cell movement and migration by binding urokinase-type plasminogen activator. uPAR also occurs in a soluble form in body fluids and tumor extracts, and both membrane and soluble uPAR are overexpressed in patients with tumors. uPAR may be a factor in inflammatory disorders as well. We investigated whether Borrelia burgdorferi could stimulate up-regulation of cell membrane uPAR in vitro. B. burgdorferi, purified native outer surface protein A, and a synthetic outer surface protein A hexalipopeptide stimulated human monocytes to up-regulate membrane uPAR as measured by immunofluorescence/FACS and Western blot. The presence of soluble uPAR in culture supernatants, measured by Ag capture ELISA, was also observed. LPS from Salmonella typhimurium and lipotechoic acid from Streptococcus pyogenes also induced the up-regulation of both membrane and soluble uPAR protein by monocytes. Up-regulation of uPAR was induced by conditioned medium from B. burgdorferi/monocyte cocultures. The up-regulation of uPAR by B. burgdorferi was concomitant with an increase in uPAR mRNA, indicating that synthesis was de novo. The expression and release of uPAR in response to B. burgdorferi and other bacterial components suggests a role in the pathogenesis of Lyme disease as well as in other bacterial infections.

TI  - Bifidobacterium strains from resident infant human gastrointestinal microflora exert antimicrobial activity.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The gastrointestinal microflora exerts a barrier effect against enteropathogens. The aim of this study was to examine if bifidobacteria, a major species of the human colonic microflora, participates in the barrier effect by developing antimicrobial activity against enterovirulent bacteria. METHODS: Antibacterial activity was examined in vitro against a wide range of Gram negative and Gram positive pathogens. Inhibition of Salmonella typhimurium SL1334 cell association and cell invasion was investigated in vitro using Caco-2 cells. Colonisation of the gastrointestinal tract in vivo by bifidobacteria was examined in axenic C3/He/Oujco mice. Antimicrobial activity was examined in vivo in axenic C3/He/Oujco mice infected by the lethal S typhimurium C5 strain. RESULTS: Fourteen human bifidobacterium strains isolated from infant stools were examined for antimicrobial activity. Two strains (CA1 and F9) expressed antagonistic activity against pathogens in vitro, inhibited cell entry, and killed intracellular S typhimurium SL1344 in Caco-2 cells. An antibacterial component(s) produced by CA1 and F9 was found to be a lipophilic molecule(s) with a molecular weight of less than 3500. In the axenic C3/He/Oujco mice, CA1 and F9 strains colonised the intestinal tract and protected mice against S typhimurium C5 lethal infection. CONCLUSION: Several bifidobacterium strains from resident infant human gastrointestinal microflora exert antimicrobial activity, suggesting that they could participate in the "barrier effect" produced by the indigenous microflora.
TI  - Human C-reactive protein is protective against fatal Salmonella enterica serovar  typhimurium infection in transgenic mice.
AB  - C-reactive protein (CRP) is an acute-phase protein with a well-known association  with infection and other inflammatory conditions. We have shown that expression of human CRP by CRP transgenic (CRPtg) mice is protective against lethal infection by Streptococcus pneumoniae, an effect likely mediated by CRP's ability to bind to this gram-positive pathogen. In the present study we tested whether CRPtg mice are resistant to infection with Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, a gram-negative pathogen that causes the murine equivalent of typhoid fever. CRPtg mice experimentally infected with a virulent Typhimurium strain lived longer and had significantly lower mortality than their non-tg littermates. The greater resistance of CRPtg mice could be attributed to significantly increased early (0 to 4 h) blood clearance of salmonellae and significantly decreased numbers of bacteria in the liver and spleen on day 7 postinfection. In addition, 14 days after infection with an avirulent Salmonella strain, the serum titer of anti-Salmonella immunoglobulin G antibodies was higher in CRPtg than non-tg mice. This study provides unequivocal evidence that CRP plays an important role in vivo in host defense against salmonellae during the early stages of infection. In addition, as the beneficial effect of CRP includes enhancement of the host's humoral immune response, CRP may also contribute indirectly to host defense during later stages of infection.
TI  - Lupene-type triterpenes from Periploca aphylla.
AB  - Two new lupane derivatives, 3beta,6alpha-dihydroxylup-20(29)-ene (1) and 6alpha-hydroxylup-20(29)-en-3beta-octadecanoate (2), have been isolated from the stems of Periploca aphylla, in addition to beta-sitosterol and lupeol. The structures of 1 and 2 were determined by spectral and chemical methods. Compound 1 showed strong inhibition of alpha-glucosidase type VI and a moderate antibacterial activity.
TI  - Construction and characterization of a Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium clone expressing a salivary adhesin of Streptococcus mutans under control of the anaerobically inducible nirB promoter.
AB  - Attenuated Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium has been used for targeted delivery of recombinant antigens to the gut-associated lymphoid tissues. One potential problem associated with this vaccine approach is the likelihood of in vivo instability of the plasmid constructs caused by constitutive hyperexpression of the heterologous immunogen. The aim of this study was to generate and characterize an expression system encoding the saliva-binding region (SBR) of Streptococcus mutans antigen I/II adhesin, either alone or linked with the mucosal adjuvant cholera toxin A2/B subunits (CTA2/B), under the control of the inducible nirB promoter. This promoter is activated in an anaerobic environment and within macrophages, which are the primary antigen-presenting cells involved in phagocytosis and processing of Salmonella. The gene encoding the chimeric SBR-CTA2/B was amplified by PCR using primers containing appropriate restriction sites for subcloning into pTETnirB, which contains the nirB promoter. The resulting plasmid was introduced into serovar Typhimurium by electroporation. Production of the SBR-CTA2/B chimeric protein under anaerobic conditions was verified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay of whole-cell lysates on plates coated with G(M1) ganglioside and developed with antibodies to SBR. Similar procedures were followed for cloning the gene encoding SBR in serovar Typhimurium under nirB control. Anaerobic expression of SBR was confirmed by Western blotting of whole-cell lysates probed with anti-SBR antibodies. The resulting serovar Typhimurium strains were administered by either the oral or the intranasal route to mice, and colonization was assessed by microbiologic analysis of dissociated spleens, Peyer's patches (PP), and nasal tissues. High numbers of the recombinant strains persisted in PP and spleen for at least 21 days following oral challenge. A single intranasal administration of the Salmonella clones to mice also resulted in the colonization of the nasal tissues by the recombinant bacteria. Salmonellae were recovered from nasal lymphoid tissues, superficial lymph nodes, internal jugular lymph nodes, PP, and spleens of mice for at least 21 days after challenge. This study provides quantitative evidence for colonization by Salmonella strains expressing a recombinant protein under the control of the inducible nirB promoter in PP or nasal tissues following a single oral or nasal administration of the bacteria, respectively.
TI  - Effects of the hinge region of cecropin A(1-8)-magainin 2(1-12), a synthetic antimicrobial peptide, on liposomes, bacterial and tumor cells.
AB  - A 20-residue hybrid peptide (CA(1-8)-MA(1-12): KWKLFKKIGIGKFLHSAKKF-NH(2)) incorporating 1-8 residues of cecropin A (CA) and 1-12 residues of magainin 2 (MA) has potent antibiotic activity without hemolytic activity. In order to investigate the effects of the flexible hinge sequence, Gly-Ile-Gly of CA(1-8)-MA(1-12) (CA-MA) on antibiotic activity, CA-MA and its three analogues, CA-MA1, CA-MA2 and CA-MA3 were synthesized. The Gly-Ile-Gly sequence of CA-MA was deleted in CA-MA1 and replaced with Pro and Gly-Pro-Gly in CA-MA2 and CA-MA3, respectively. CA-MA1 and CA-MA3 caused a significant decrease in the bactericidal rate against Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis and the tumoricidal activity against four different tumor cells, and the PC/PS (4:1, w/w) vesicle-aggregating and disrupting activities. However, CA-MA2 showed a similar bactericidal rate and antitumor, vesicle-aggregating and disrupting activities, as compared with CA-MA. These results suggested that the flexibility or beta-turn induced by Gly-Ile-Gly or Pro in the central part of CA-MA may be important in the electrostatic interaction of the cationic short alpha-helical region in the N-terminus with the cell membrane surface and the hydrophobic interaction of amphipathic alpha-helical region in the C-terminus with the hydrophobic acyl chains in the cell membrane. CA-MA3 exhibited lower activity in antibacterial, antitumor, and vesicle-aggregating and disrupting activities than CA-MA and CA-MA2. This result suggested that the excessive beta-turn structure by Gly-Pro-Gly in CA-MA3 seems to interrupt the ion channel/pore formation on the lipid bilayer. It was concluded that the appropriate flexibility or beta-turn structure provided by the central hinge is responsible for the effective antibiotic activity of the antimicrobial peptides with the helix-hinge-helix structure.
TI  - Novel functions of human alpha(1)-protease inhibitor after S-nitrosylation: inhibition of cysteine protease and antibacterial activity.
AB  - alpha(1)-Protease inhibitor (alpha(1)PI), the most abundant serine protease inhibitor found in human plasma (at 30-60 microM), is a glycoprotein (53 kDa) having a single cysteine residue at position 232 (Cys(232)). We have found that Cys(232) of human alpha(1)PI was readily S-nitrosylated by nitric oxide (NO) without affecting inhibitory activity to trypsin or elastase. S-nitrosylated alpha(1)PI (S-NO-alpha(1)PI) not only retained inhibitory activity against these serine proteases, but also gained thiol protease inhibitory activity against a Streptococcus pyogenes protease; the parental alpha(1)PI did not have this activity. Furthermore, S-NO-alpha(1)PI exhibited bacteriostatic activity against Salmonella typhimurium at concentrations of 0.1-10 microM, which were 20- to 3000-fold stronger than those of the other NO-generating compounds or S-nitroso compounds such as S-nitrosoalbumin and S-nitrosoglutathione. NO appears to be transferred into the bacterial cells from S-NO-alpha(1)PI via transnitrosylation, as evidenced by electron spin resonance spectroscopy with an NO spin trap. Thus, we conclude that S-NO-alpha(1)PI may be generated from the reaction between alpha(1)PI and NO under inflammatory conditions, in which production of both is known to increase. As a result, new functions, i.e., antibacterial and thiol protease inhibitory activities of alpha(1)PI, were generated.
TI  - Streptococcus mutans H2O2-forming NADH oxidase is an alkyl hydroperoxide reductase protein.
AB  - Nox-1 from Streptococcus mutans, the bacteria which cause dental caries, was previously identified as an H2O2-forming reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) oxidase. Nox-1 is homologous with the flavoprotein component, AhpF, of Salmonella typhimurium alkyl hydroperoxide reductase. A partial open reading frame upstream of nox1, homologous with the other (peroxidase) component, ahpC, from the S. typhimurium system, was also identified. We report here the complete sequence of S. mutans ahpC. Analyses of purified AhpC together with Nox-1 have verified that these proteins act as a cysteine-based peroxidase system in S. mutans, catalyzing the NADH-dependent reduction of organic hydroperoxides or H2O2 to their respective alcohols and/or H2O. These proteins also catalyze the four-electron reduction of O2 to H2O2, clarifying the role of Nox-1 as a protective protein against oxygen toxicity. Major differences between Nox-1 and AhpF include: (i) the absolute specificity of Nox-1 for NADH; (ii) lower amounts of flavin semiquinone and a more prominent FADH2 to NAD+ charge transfer absorbance band stabilized by Nox-1; and (iii) even higher redox potentials of disulfide centers relative to flavin for Nox-1. Although Nox-1 and AhpC from S. mutans were shown to play a protective role against oxidative stress in vitro and in vivo in Escherichia coli, the lack of a significant effect on deletion of these genes from S. mutans suggests the presence of additional antioxidant proteins in these bacteria.
TI  - Polyosides (encapsulated bacteria).
AB  - The polysaccharide capsule which surrounds bacterial species such as Haemophilus  influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis and Salmonella typhi is a potent virulence factor by protecting the bacteria from phagocytosis. The host responds with antibody production and specific antibodies plus complement binding to the capsule facilitate opsonization of the micro-organism, which is phagocytized and eliminated. Purified capsular polysaccharides elicit T-independent antibody responses without a memory function, but are often poorly immunogenic in infants where much of the invasive H. influenzae type b (Hib) and pneumococcal infections is seen. Therefore purified polysaccharides have found limited use as vaccines. However, covalent linkage of the capsular polysaccharide, or fractions thereof, to immunogenic carrier proteins creates glycoconjugates which are T-dependent antigens and which elicit antibodies also in infants and which prime for boosting either with the glycoconjugate or the capsular polysaccharide. In the last decade Hib glycoconjugate vaccines have been successfully introduced and in countries with very high immunization coverage the disease has been virtually eliminated and a decline of over 95% has been seen in countries with slightly lower vaccine rates. World-wide use of Hib glycoconjugate vaccines offers the possibility of elimination of invasive Hib disease. Pneumococcal (11 serotypes with coverage of approximately 85% of invasive disease), meningococcal (A, C, W 135, Y but not B) and S. typhi glycoconjugates are in advanced development and offer the prospect of being as successful as the Hib glycoconjugates.
TI  - Cloning and characterization of the gene encoding O-acetylserine lyase from Streptococcus suis.
AB  - We have cloned and sequenced a gene encoding O-acetylserine lyase from Streptococcus suis. The gene encodes a protein of 309 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 32,038 Da. The deduced amino acid sequence showed more extensive similarities to the CysK proteins than to the CysM proteins of other bacteria. The cloned gene was inserted into a pTrcHisB histidine hexamer expression vector. A 38-kDa fusion protein was expressed in a cysMK auxotrophic mutant of Salmonella typhimurium and complemented the auxotrophic properties of the mutant. Furthermore, the transformants could grow in minimal defined media supplemented with not only sulfide but also thiosulfate as a sole sulfur source. These data indicated that the cloned gene encodes a protein that was a functional homolog of the CysM in S. typhimurium.
TI  - Synthesis of bromoindolyl 4,7-di-O-methyl-Neu5Ac: specificity toward influenza A  and B viruses.
AB  - N-Acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) was converted into the methyl ester methyl ketoside-8,9-epoxy derivative (8). Methylation of 8 followed by deprotection gave 4,7-di-O-methyl-Neu5Ac (10). Compound 10 was converted into the corresponding methyl ester-chloroacetate derivative, which was subsequently coupled to 5-bromo-indol-3-ol to give the chromogenic product (13). Deprotection of 13 gave 5-bromo-indol-3-yl 4,7-di-O-methyl-Neu5Ac (5). The product 5 was specifically cleaved by sialidase from either influenza A or influenza B virus to give an indigo-blue precipitate, but was not cleaved by several bacterial or viral sialidases tested. The properties of product 5 relative to a fluorescent substrate for sialidase were also documented.
TI  - Incidence of Haemophilus influenzae type b meningitis among children less than 5  years of age in Slovakia.
AB  - Owing partly to a lack of disease burden data, Eastern and Central European countries have not introduced universal infant immunization against Haemophilus influenzae type b. To determine the incidence of Haemophilus influenzae type b meningitis among children less than 5 years of age, data were examined from eight districts in Slovakia that formed part of a national Haemophilus influenzae type b surveillance system. All invasive isolates of Haemophilus influenzae type b identified from these districts during 24 months (1996-1997) were sent to a single central laboratory for serotype confirmation. Thirty-five cases of confirmed Haemophilus influenzae type b meningitis were identified, for a disease incidence among children under 5 years of 17.3 per 100,000 population per year. Only 13 cases were identified during 1996, the first full year of the surveillance system. Records were available for review at six of the eight district laboratories and showed that, using World Health Organization definitions, almost half of the cases of probable bacterial meningitis were culture negative, suggesting that the true incidence of Haemophilus influenzae type b meningitis may be considerably higher than 17.3. The rate of Haemophilus influenzae type b meningitis among children less than 5 years of age in Slovakia is comparable to that found in Western Europe and North America during the prevaccine era. Thus, universal, publicly funded infant vaccination in Slovakia can be expected to have the same dramatic effect on Haemophilus influenzae type b disease morbidity and mortality as has been demonstrated in other countries that have adopted this approach.
TI  - Bactericidal action of 308 nm excimer-laser radiation: an in vitro investigation.
AB  - The aim of the present study was to investigate the influence of 308 nm excimer-laser radiation on bacterial growth. Six different bacterial strains (Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus faecalis, Lactococcis lactis, Salmonella typhimurium, and Deinococcus radiodurans) were exposed in vitro to various doses and energy densities of laser radiation. To exclude bacterial killing by supraphysiological heating, the temperature change in the samples during irradiation was measured. Extended antimicrobial effects of XeCl excimer-laser radiation depending on the time of radiation, the energy density of the laser beam, and the irradiated bacterial strain were observed. Reduction of bacterial growth is independent of temperature and not linked to any ablative tissue removal. In almost all cases, a 99.9% reduction of bacteria was reached by total radiation times < 100 ms. The proven antimicrobial effects of 308 nm excimer-laser radiation may be of significant clinical importance in endodontics and periodontology in the future.

TI  - Untreatable infections?--The challenge of the 21st century.
AB  - The triumph of antibiotics over bacterial pathogens that has occurred in the latter half of this century looks increasingly threatened as we approach the new millennium. Increasing resistance in important pathogens such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Shigella, and Streptococcus pneumoniae threatens the lives of millions. The increasing problems with drug resistance in (C. diphtheriae, Salmonella typhi and the pneumococcus in Vietnam are presented as examples of the challenge confronting tropical countries.
TI  - Bacterial resistance to ultrasonic waves under pressure at nonlethal (manosonication) and lethal (manothermosonication) temperatures.
AB  - The decimal reduction times of Streptococcus faecium, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella enteritidis, and Aeromonas hydrophila corresponding to heat treatment at 62 degrees C were 7.1, 0.34, 0.024, and 0.0096 min, and those corresponding to manosonication treatment (40 degrees C, 200 kPa, 117 microm) were 4.0, 1.5, 0.86, and 0.90 min, respectively. The manosonication decimal reduction times of the four species investigated decreased sixfold when the amplitude was increased from 62 to 150 microm and fivefold when the relative pressure was raised from 0 to 400 kPa. In L. monocytogenes, S. enteritidis, and A. hydrophila, the lethal effect of manothermosonication was the result of the addition of the lethal effects of heat and manosonication, whereas in S. faecium it was a synergistic effect.
TI  - Community-acquired septicaemia in southern Viet Nam: the importance of multidrug-resistant Salmonella typhi.
AB  - In a prospective study conducted between mid 1993 and 1994, 437 adults and children were admitted with community-acquired septicaemia to an infectious diseases hospital in southern Viet Nam. Gram-negative aerobes accounted for 90% of isolates and were predominantly Salmonella typhi (67%), Sal. para-typhi A (3%), Escherichia coli (10%), and Klebsiella spp. (5%). Other Salmonella spp. (1%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1%), Neisseria meningitidis (0.5%) and Haemophilus influenzae (0.2%) were uncommon. Staphylococcus aureus (5.5%) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (2%) were the most common Gram-positive isolates. Patients with enteric fever were younger (median age 16 years, range 1-63) than the other patients (median age 43 years, range 1-88) (P < 0.001) and had a lower mortality rate (0.3% vs. 23%; relative risk 69.5, 95% confidence interval 9.5-507.8; P < 0.0001). Over 70% of the Sal. typhi isolated were multi-drug-resistant, and 4% were resistant to nalidixic acid. Multidrug-resistant Sal. typhi is a major cause of community-acquired septicaemia in Viet Nam.
TI  - Decontamination of drinking water by direct heating in solar panels.
AB  - A device was developed for direct heating of water by solar radiation in a flow-through system of copper pipes. An adjustable thermostat valve prevents water below the chosen temperature from being withdrawn. The results show that it is possible to eliminate coliform and thermotolerant coliform bacteria from naturally contaminated river water by heating to temperatures of 65 degrees C or above. Artificial additions of Salmonella typhimurium, Streptococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli to contaminated river water were also inactivated after heating to 65 degrees C and above. The total viable count could be reduced by a factor of 1000. The heat-resistant bacteria isolated from the Mlalakuva River (Tanzania) were spore-forming bacteria which exhibited greater heat resistance than commonly used test bacteria originating from countries with colder climates. To provide a good safety margin it is recommended that an outlet water temperature of 75 degrees C be used. At that temperature the daily production was about 501 of decontaminated water per m2 of solar panel, an amount that could be doubled by using a heat exchanger to recycle the heat.
TI  - Characterization of a bacteriocin produced by Streptococcus thermophilus 81.
AB  - A new bacteriocin, produced by Streptococcus thermophilus 81 has been isolated, purified and characterized. By its heat sensitivity and broad inhibitory spectrum it does not resemble any other S. thermophilus bacteriocin. The mode of action is bacteriostatic. This peptide of 32 amino acids is efficient against several Bacillus species, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis and Yersinia enterocolitica. This bacteriocin is heat labile but its activity was not altered by pH variation from 3 to 10. Six months of storage at 40 degrees C did not influence the activity. The inactivation by detergents and the inability to resolve the protein in SDS-PAGE supposes a more complex structure or a possible stabilizing effect of other molecules. The low sensitivity of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus to the isolated bacteriocin suggests that S. thermophilus 81 may be used in yoghurt starters.
TI  - Evaluation of an avian-specific probiotic and Salmonella typhimurium-Specific antibodies on the colonization of Salmonella typhimurium in broilers.
AB  - Salmonella typhimurium colonizes the intestinal tract of poultry and causes food-borne illness in humans. Reduction of S. typhimurium colonization in the intestinal tract of poultry reduces potential carcass contamination during slaughter. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of an avian-specific probiotic and S. typhimurium-specific antibodies on the colonization of S. typhimurium in broilers and on body weights. Broiler chicks were spray-vaccinated at the hatchery with the commercial product. Avian Pac Plus, which contains Lactobacillus acidophilus, Streptococcus faecium, ad S. typhimurium-specific antibodies. At placement, these chicks were administered Avian Pac plus in the water. Six hours postplacement, chicks were orally challenged with 1.8 x 10 (7) CFU of S. typhimurium. Chicks were administered Avian Pac Plus for two additional days postchallenge. Chicks were evaluated for S. typhimurium colonization and shedding every 3 to 4 days for the first 2 weeks and every 7 days for 6 weeks. The mean cecal and colonic concentration of S. typhimurium from the Avian Pac Plus-treated group was significantly lower at day 31 (P = 0.0001), day 38 (P = 0.0005), and day 43 (P = 0.0001) than the nontreated control group. These results indicated that a combination of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Streptococcus faecium, and S typhimurium-specific antibodies have a beneficial effect in reducing the colonization of S. typhimurium in market-aged broilers.
TI  - A live recombinant avirulent oral Salmonella vaccine expressing pneumococcal surface protein A induces protective responses against Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - A live oral recombinant Salmonella vaccine strain expressing pneumococcal surface protein A (PspA) was developed. The strain was attenuated with Deltacya Deltacrp mutations. Stable expression of PspA was achieved by the use of the balanced-lethal vector-host system, which employs an asd deletion in the host chromosome to impose an obligate requirement for diaminopimelic acid. The chromosomal Deltaasd mutation was complemented by a plasmid vector possessing the asd+ gene. A portion of the pspA gene from Streptococcus pneumoniae Rx1 was cloned onto a multicopy Asd+ vector. After oral immunization, the recombinant Salmonella-PspA vaccine strain colonized the Peyer's patches, spleens, and livers of BALB/cByJ and CBA/N mice and stimulated humoral and mucosal antibody responses. Oral immunization of outbred New Zealand White rabbits with the recombinant Salmonella strain induced significant anti-PspA immunoglobulin G titers in serum and vaginal secretions. Polyclonal sera from orally immunized mice detected PspA on the S. pneumoniae cell surface as revealed by immunofluorescence. Oral immunization of BALB/cJ mice with the PspA-producing Salmonella strain elicited antibody to PspA and resistance to challenge by the mouse-virulent human clinical isolate S. pneumoniae WU2. Immune sera from orally immunized mice conferred passive protection against otherwise lethal intraperitoneal or intravascular challenge with strain WU2.
TI  - Identification of a specific chaperone for SptP, a substrate of the centisome 63  type III secretion system of Salmonella typhimurium.
AB  - Salmonella typhimurium uses of a type III protein secretion system encoded at centisome 63 of its chromosome to deliver effector molecule into the host cell. These proteins stimulate host cell responses such as reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and activation of transcription factors. One of these effector proteins is SptP, a tyrosine phosphatase that causes disruption of the host cell actin cytoskeleton. A characteristic feature of many substrates of type III secretion systems is their association with specific cytoplasmic chaperones which appears to be required for secretion and/or translocation of these proteins into the host cell. We report here the identification of SicP, a 13-kDa acidic polypeptide that is encoded immediately upstream of sptP. A loss-of-function mutation in sicP resulted in drastically reduced levels of SptP but did not affect sptP expression, indicating that SicP exerts its effect posttranscriptionally. Pulse-chase experiments demonstrated that the loss of SicP leads to increased degradation of SptP. In addition, we show that SicP binds to SptP directly and that the binding site is located between residues 15 and 100 of the tyrosine phosphatase. Taken together, these results indicate that SicP acts as a specific chaperone for SptP.
TI  - Host mutations (miaA and rpsL) reduce tetracycline resistance mediated by Tet(O)  and Tet(M).
AB  - The effects of mutations in host genes on tetracycline resistance mediated by the Tet(O) and Tet(M) ribosomal protection proteins, which originated in Campylobacter spp. and Streptococcus spp., respectively, were investigated by using mutants of Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli. The miaA, miaB, and miaAB double mutants of S. typhimurium specify enzymes for tRNA modification at the adenosine at position 37, adjacent to the anticodon in tRNA. In S. typhimurium, this involves biosynthesis of N6-(4-hydroxyisopentenyl)-2-methylthio-adenosine (ms2io6A). The miaA mutation reduced the level of tetracycline resistance mediated by both Tet(O) and Tet(M), but the latter showed a greater effect, which was ascribed to the isopentenyl (i6) group or to a combination of the methylthioadenosine (ms2) and i6 groups but not to the ms2 group alone (specified by miaB). In addition, mutations in E. coli rpsL genes, generating both streptomycin-resistant and streptomycin-dependent strains, were also shown to reduce the level of tetracycline resistance mediated by Tet(O) and Tet(M). The single-site amino acid substitutions present in the rpsL mutations were pleiotropic in their effects on tetracycline MICs. These mutants affect translational accuracy and kinetics and suggest that Tet(O) and Tet(M) binding to the ribosome may be reduced or slowed in the E. coli rpsL mutants in which the S12 protein is altered. Data from both the miaA and rpsL mutant studies indicate a possible link between stability of the aminoacyl-tRNA in the ribosomal acceptor site and tetracycline resistance mediated by the ribosomal protection proteins.
TI  - Risks for bacteremia and urinary tract infections in young febrile children with  bronchiolitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the risks for bacteremia and urinary tract injections (UTI) in young febrile children with and without bronchiolitis. DESIGN: A prospective cohort study. SETTING: The emergency departments of 3 pediatric referral hospitals. PATIENTS: A convenience sample of 432 previously healthy febrile patients aged 24 months or younger. Patients were divided into groups, based on the presence (n = 163, bronchiolitis group) or absence (n = 269, control group) of wheezing and/or retractions on examination. Blood cultures were obtained from all patients, and urine cultures were obtained from female patients, and male patients aged 6 months or younger. Chest radiographs were obtained on patients with lower respiratory tract signs, and those with lobar pneumonias were excluded (7 wheezing and 8 nonwheezing patients), leaving 156 patients with bronchiolitis and 261 control patients. OUTCOME MEASURES: Growth of any bacterial pathogens from the blood or 10(4) colony-forming units per milliliter or more from the urine. RESULTS: None of the 156 patients with bronchiolitis had bacteremia (95% confidence interval, 0%-1.9%) vs 2.7% of the 261 controls (95% confidence interval, 1.1%-5.4%; P = .049); 1.9% of the patients with bronchiolitis had UTI vs 13.6% of the controls (odds ratio, 0.12; 95% confidence interval, 0.02-0.55; P = .001). None of the subset of patients with bronchiolitis aged 2 months or younger (n = 36) had bacteremia or UTI; however, there were not enough of these younger patients to make statistically conclusive comparisons. CONCLUSIONS: Previously healthy febrile children aged 24 months or younger with bronchiolitis are unlikely to have bacteremia or UTI. Therefore, routine cultures of the blood and urine in these patients are unnecessary. More data are needed regarding the subset of febrile infants aged 2 months or younger with bronchiolitis.
TI  - Surface warfare against pathogens using mucosal vaccines.
AB  
TI  - Protective immunity against Salmonella typhimurium elicited in mice by oral vaccination with phosphorylcholine encapsulated in poly(DL-lactide-co-glycolide) microspheres.
AB  - Encapsulation of vaccines in biodegradable microspheres provides excellent mucosal immunogens with a high potential for immunization against bacterial infections. We tested the protective immunity elicited by intragastric vaccination with phosphorylcholine (PC) encapsulated in poly(DL-lactide-co-glycolide) (DL-PLG) microspheres against Salmonella typhimurium in a mouse model of invasive intestinal infection. We chose PC as the antigen because it was found to elicit an immune response after intestinal exposure of mice to PC-bearing S. typhimurium and because anti-PC immunity protects mice against Streptococcus pneumoniae, another PC-bearing microorganism. Mice were primed intragastrically on days 1, 2, and 3 and boosted on days 28, 29, and 30 with PC (280 microg) coupled to porcine thyroglobulin (PC-thyr) encapsulated in DL-PLG microspheres, free PC-thyr, or blank microspheres. A significant rise in anti-PC immunoglobulin A (IgA) titers, as measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, was observed in the intestinal secretions after immunization with PC-loaded microspheres, compared to the titers of mice immunized with free PC-thyr or blank microspheres. This antibody response peaked 14 days after the last boost and correlated with a highly significant resistance to oral challenge by S. typhimurium C5 (P < 10(-3)). Control mice were primed intraperitoneally on day 1 with 15 microg of PC in complete Freund's adjuvant and boosted on days 10, 14, and 20 with the same dose without adjuvant but via the same route. In these mice, the levels of anti-PC IgA in intestinal secretions were equivalent to those of the mice intragastrically immunized with PC-loaded microspheres, but protection was significantly weaker, suggesting that either the IgAs were not functional or that other immune mechanisms are important in protection. Taken together, our results highlight the potential of antigen encapsulation in DL-PLG microspheres for eliciting protective immunity against invasive intestinal bacterial diseases and suggest that a similar strategy could be used against diseases caused by other PC-bearing microorganisms.
TI  - A novel pathway for O-polysaccharide biosynthesis in Salmonella enterica serovar  Borreze.
AB  - The plasmid-encoded gene cluster for O:54 O-polysaccharide synthesis in Salmonella enterica serovar Borreze (rfbO:54) contains three genes that direct synthesis of a ManNAc homopolymer with alternating beta1,3 and beta1,4 linkages. In Escherichia coli K-12, RfbAO:54 adds the first ManNAc residue to the Rfe (UDP-GlcpNAc::undecaprenylphosphate GlcpNAc-1-phosphate transferase)- modified lipopolysaccharide core. Hydrophobic cluster analysis of RfbAO:54 indicates this protein belongs to the ExoU family of nonprocessive beta-glycosyltransferases. Two putative catalytic residues and a potential substrate-binding motif were identified in RfbAO:54. Topological analysis of RfbBO:54 predicts four transmembrane domains and a large central cytoplasmic domain. The latter shares homology with a similar domain in the processive beta-glycosyltransferases Cps3S of Streptococcus pneumoniae and HasA of Streptococcus pyogenes. Hydrophobic cluster analysis of RfbBO:54 and Cps3S indicates both possess the structural features characteristic of the HasA family of processive beta-glycosyltransferases. Four potential catalytic residues and a putative substrate-binding motif were identified in RfbBO:54. In Deltarfb E. coli K-12, RfbAO:54 and RfbBO:54 direct synthesis of smooth O:54 lipopolysaccharide, indicating that this O-polysaccharide involves a novel pathway for O-antigen transport. Based on sequence and structural conservation, 15 new ExoU-related and 17 new HasA-related transferases were identified.
TI  - Construction and oral immunogenicity of a Salmonella typhimurium strain expressing a streptococcal adhesin linked to the A2/B subunits of cholera toxin.
AB  - A major adhesin from the oral pathogen Streptococcus mutans has been shown to be  mucosally immunogenic upon genetic fusion with the cholera toxin A2/B subunits. To take advantage of the ability of Salmonella typhimurium to deliver cloned antigens to the mucosal inductive sites that would obviate the need for antigen purification, we expressed this chimeric construct in an attenuated S. typhimurium strain under the control of bacteriophage T7 transcription. Residual expression of the temperature-regulated T7 RNA polymerase at 30 degrees C allowed production of the chimeric protein at 2-3% of the total soluble protein, but it was increased five to six times following induction at 37 degrees C. Oral administration of a single dose of 10(9) recombinant Salmonella to mice resulted in serum IgG and salivary IgA antibody responses to Salmonella, cholera toxin, and the streptococcal adhesin, which were generally enhanced after a booster immunization.
TI  - Oral immunization with recombinant Salmonella typhimurium expressing surface protein antigen A (SpaA) of Streptococcus sobrinus: effects of the Salmonella virulence plasmid on the induction of protective and sustained humoral responses in rats.
AB  - Recombinant strains of Salmonella typhimurium have been studied as antigen delivery systems to determine their effectiveness as multivalent vaccines. Here we compare the efficacy of two strains of S. typhimurium. chi 4072 (pYA2905) and chi 3987 (pYA2905), expressing SpaA of Streptococcus sobrinus 6715 as oral vaccines for dental caries. Both strains are attenuated delta cya delta crp delta asd mutants with their Asd phenotypes complemented by the Asd+ plasmid pYA2905, which also encodes a peptide fragment of SpaA. S. typhimurium chi 3987 (pYA2905), unlike S. typhimurium chi 4072 (pYA2905), contains the 100 kb S. typhimurium virulence plasmid. Fischer rats were orally immunized with approximately 10(9) S. typhimurium chi 3987 (pYA2905) or chi 4072 (pYA2905) and then challenged with cariogenic S. sobrinus 6715. Rats orally immunized with either strain of recombinant Salmonella developed salivary IgA anti-SpaA responses and had lower levels of S. sobrinus-induced dental caries than nonimmunized, infected animals. In a second series of experiments, the kinetics and isotype of the serum and salivary antibody responses were determined in rats orally immunized with S. typhimurium chi 3987 (pYA2905) or chi 4072 (pYA2905) on weeks 0 and 8. IgG and IgM serum antibody responses to SpaA and S. typhimurium were detected after the primary and secondary immunizations, and the secondary immunization boosted serum IgG anti-Salmonella activity. In general, animals immunized with chi 3987 (pYA2905) had higher serum anti-SpaA, as well as serum and salivary anti-Salmonella, responses than animals immunized with chi 4072 (pYA2905). This study demonstrates the effective use of two recombinant S. typhimurium strains as oral vaccines for inducing protective and sustained immune responses against a mucosal pathogen and suggests that the recombinant Salmonella vaccine strain carrying the virulence plasmid induced similar or higher protective immune responses than the strain lacking the virulence plasmid.
TI  - Detection of bacteria in equine synovial fluid by use of the polymerase chain reaction.
AB  - Equine synovial fluid aliquots were inoculated with Salmonella enteritidis, Escherichia coli, Actinobacillus equuli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus zooepidemicus to obtain approximate concentrations of 1000, 100, 10, and 1 colony forming U/mL. Synovial fluid aliquots were also inoculated with an unquantitated inoculum of Bacteroides fragilis and Clostridium perfringens. Inoculated synovial fluid was incubated in trypticase-soy broth or Columbia broth for approximately 12 hours. Then aliquots were removed for DNA extraction and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis for detection of a 531 base-pair segment of bacterial DNA corresponding to a region of the 16S ribosomal gene. Duplicate samples of inoculated synovial fluid were prepared for microbial culture. Bacteria were detected in all samples inoculated with bacteria but not in control synovial fluid samples. Under experimental conditions there was no difference between microbial culture and PCR analyses for detection of bacteria. Experimentally, PCR was able to detect bacteria in synovial fluid within 24 hours of inoculation.
TI  - A human temporal bone study of acute bacterial meningogenic labyrinthitis.
AB  - It is well established that sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) is an important sequela of acute bacterial meningitis. Previous human temporal bone histopathologic studies have suggested that such hearing loss is due to labyrinthitis. This study involved a detailed and systematic evaluation of the auditory and vestibular end-organs in 41 human temporal bones from patients with acute bacterial meningitis, aimed at describing the spectrum of histopathologic changes within the labyrinth, ascertaining likely routes for spread of infection from the meninges to the inner ear, and comparing the data from humans with those described in a rabbit model of meningogenic labyrinthitis. Our study revealed the following: (a) Suppurative labyrinthitis occurred in 20 (49%) bones. Of these 20 bones, the cochlea was affected in all, whereas the vestibular organs were involved in 10. Eosinophilic staining of inner ear fluids without the presence of inflammatory cells (so-called "serous" labyrinthitis) occurred in 14 of the remaining 21 bones. This staining occurred primarily within the vestibular system. Its significance and pathogenesis remains unknown; (b) Sensory and neural structures of the inner ear appeared intact in the majority of specimens, including bones with suppurative labyrinthitis and those with eosinophilic staining of inner ear fluids. This finding raises the possibility of preventing or reversing SNHL by therapeutic intervention. Spiral ganglion cells were severely degenerated in 12% of bones, indicating a retrocochlear site of hearing loss in addition to the cochlea. This subset of patients may perform poorly after cochlear implantation; (c) It has been traditionally assumed that irreversible and permanent SNHL is caused by suppurative labyrinthitis, whereas reversible SNHL is caused by serous labyrinthitis. Our findings question the validity of these assumptions; (d) The data were consistent with the hypothesis that both the cochlear modiolus and cochlear aqueduct can serve as potential pathways for spread of infection from the meninges to the inner ear; (e) There were many similarities in the histopathology of the inner ear in humans when compared with the rabbit model of meningogenic labyrinthitis. A notable difference was that the cochlear aqueduct appeared to be the sole pathway for spread of infection in the rabbit, whereas in the human, both the modiolus and aqueduct were possible pathways.
TI  - Antimutagenicity of yogurt.
AB  - Yogurt is milk fermented by a mixture of two bacteria: Lactobacillus delbrueckii  ssp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus. Epidemiological studies have correlated a reduced risk of colon cancer with yogurt consumption. Independent studies have established that yogurt and extracts thereof are antimutagenic. Although multiple explanations can account for yogurt's putative anticarcinogenicity, we are interested in testing the hypothesis that antimutagenic compounds produced during fermentation are responsible. We recently reported on the antimutagenicity of an acetone extract of yogurt against the experimental carcinogens N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) and 3.2'dimethyl-4-aminobiphenyl (DMAB) (Mutation Res. (1995) 334, 213-224). We are now aware that palmitic acid is an active ingredient against MNNG.

TI  - [Bioantimutagenic effect of the culture fluid of Streptococcus faecalis on mutagenesis induced by 2-nitrofluorene in Salmonella typhimurium TA 1538 and TA 98].
AB  - Streptococcus faecalis growing in rich organic media or synthetic medium containing 0.1% trypton and 0.05% yeast extract was shown to form substances with a bioantimutagenic activity against the mutagenicity of 2-nitrofluorene and 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide, which induce frameshift and base-pair substitution mutations, respectively. The maximum accumulation of antimutagens in the medium was observed within 16-24 h of growth. The modified Ames test showed that the culture liquid of Str. faecalis possessed a higher antimutagenic activity for Salmonella typhimurium strain TA 1538 than for strain TA 98 with an enhanced SOS response. Fractionation of the culture liquid revealed that the bioantimutagenic activity is localized in the fraction of peptides with molecular masses of less than 12 kDa.
TI  - In situ prosthetic graft replacement for mycotic thoracoabdominal aneurysms.
AB  - Infected aortic aneurysms remain a difficult surgical problem associated with high morbidity and mortality. We report three cases of mycotic thoracoabdominal aneurysms treated by debridement of infected aortic tissue, in situ prosthetic graft replacement, and intensive antibiotic therapy. One early death occurred in a patient with systemic sepsis related to Salmonella enteritidis infection of the thoracic aorta secondary to a colovesical fistula. The two other patients remain alive at 2 years without further complications of the surgery. Bacteriology is as follows: Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Salmonella enteritidis. In all patients the operation was performed immediately after the diagnosis was confirmed. Antibiotic therapy was begun intraoperatively and was continued for at least 6 months. Two patients were followed regularly, and there have been no septic recurrences in our 2-year follow-up period. In situ prosthetic graft replacement in conjunction with intensive antibiotic therapy is a viable option in the treatment of mycotic thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms.
TI  - Regulation of glycerol and maltose uptake by the IIAGlc-like domain of IINag of the phosphotransferase system in Salmonella typhimurium LT2.
AB  - In Enterobacteriaceae the nonphosphorylated form of IIAGlc of the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system (PTS) can inhibit the uptake and subsequent metabolism of glycerol and maltose by binding to, and inhibiting, glycerol kinase and the MalK protein of the maltose transport system, respectively. In this report we show that the IIAGlc-like domain of the membrane-bound IIN-acetylglucosamine (IINag) of the PTS can replace IIAGlc in a Salmonella typhimurium crr mutant strain that lacks all soluble IIAGlc. The inhibition was most severe in cells which were partially induced for the glycerol or maltose uptake systems. The Streptococcus thermophilus lactose transporter LacS, which also contains a IIAGlc-like domain, could not replace IIAGlc. Neither IINag nor LacS could replace IIAGlc in activation of adenylate cyclase.
TI  - [Antimutagenic action of bacterial culture liquid on mutagenesis induced by 2-nitrofluorene in Salmonella typhimurium strains].
AB  - It was shown that cell extracts and cells of Streptococcus faecalis decrease the  mutagenic effect of 2-nitrofluorene in Salmonella typhimurium strain TA1538 by 73 and 48%, respectively. Cell extracts and cells of Bifidobacterium bifidum and Propionibacterium shermanii exhibited weak antimutagenic activity. No antimutagenic effect was found in Escherichia coli AB1157, Lactobacillus delbrueckii, or Streptococcus thermophilus. Antimutageneicity of the cell extract of Str. faecalis is both associated with extracellular factors interacting with 2-nitrofluorene (desmutagenesis) and with factors affecting intracellular processes of mutagen biotransformation and mutation induction. Thiol compounds produced by growing Str. faecalis may be desmutagenic factors. A relatively heat-stable substance or substances of a peptide nature with a MM less than 12 kDa are antimutagenic factors affecting intracellular processes of mutagenesis.
TI  - Oral immunization with recombinant Salmonella typhimurium expressing surface protein antigen A of Streptococcus sobrinus: dose response and induction of protective humoral responses in rats.
AB  - An attenuated, recombinant Salmonella typhimurium mutant, chi 4072(pYA2905), expressing the surface protein antigen A (SpaA) of Streptococcus sobrinus was investigated for its effectiveness in inducing protective immune responses against S. sobrinus-induced dental caries in an experimental caries model. Fischer rats were orally immunized with either 10(8) or 10(9) CFU of S. typhimurium chi 4072(pYA2905). Persistence of salmonellae in Peyer's patches and spleens and the induction of immune responses were determined. Maximum numbers of salmonellae were recovered from Peyer's patches of rats within the first week of immunization, with higher numbers recovered from rats given 10(9) CFU than from those given 10(8) CFU. Serum anti-Salmonella and anti-SpaA responses increased more rapidly in rats given 10(9) CFU than in rats given 10(8) CFU. The salivary antibody response to SpaA increased with time, but the response varied in the two groups. In a separate study, rats were orally immunized with the recombinant Salmonella mutant and then challenged with cariogenic S. sobrinus 6715. The levels of serum and salivary antibody and caries activity were assessed at the termination of the experiment. Higher levels of salivary immunoglobulin A antibody to SpaA and Salmonella carrier were detected in rats given 10(9) CFU than in those given 10(8) CFU, and these responses were higher than those in nonimmunized controls. Mandibular molars from immunized rats had lower numbers of recoverable streptococci and less extensive carious lesions than those from nonimmunized, control rats. These data indicate that oral immunization with an attenuated recombinant S. typhimurium expressing SpaA of S. sobrinus induces the production of antigen-specific mucosal antibody and confers protection against dental caries.
TI  - Antimutagenicity of an acetone extract of yogurt.
AB  - Reconstituted non-fat dry milk powder, fermented by a mixture of Streptococcus thermophilus CH3 and Lactobacillus bulgaricus 191R to produce yogurt, was freeze-dried and extracted in acetone. After evaporation of the acetone, the extract was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and tested for antimutagenicity. In the Ames test, significant dose-dependent activity was observed against N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG), 4-nitro-quinoline-N-oxide (4NQO), 3,2'-dimethyl-4-aminobiphenyl (DMAB), 9,10-dimethyl-1,2-benz[a]anthracene (DMBA), and 3-amino-1-methyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole acetate (Trp-P-2). Weak activity was observed against 1,2,7,8-diepoxyoctane (DEO), and no activity was observed against methyl methanesulfonate (MMS), ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS), or aflatoxin B1 (AFB1). In a related assay (Saccharomyces cerevisiae D7), significant antimutagenic activity was detected against MNNG and 4NQO. Activity against the experimental colon carcinogens MNNG and DMAB was examined further, as assayed in the Ames test (Salmonella typhimurium TA100). Compounds responsible for both activities were less soluble in aqueous solutions than in DMSO. Adjustment of yogurt pH to 3, 7.6, or 13 prior to freeze-drying and acetone extraction did not significantly alter the amount of anti-MNNG activity recovered. In contrast, extractability of anti-DMAB activity was significantly greater at acidic pH. Conjugated linoleic acid, a known dairy anticarcinogen, failed to inhibit mutagenesis caused by either mutagen, suggesting that other yogurt-derived compound(s) are responsible. Unfermented milk was treated with lactic acid, yogurt bacteria without subsequent growth, or both, to determine if formation of antimutagenic activity required bacterial growth. Extracts of the milk treatments exhibited the same weak antimutagenicity observed in unfermented milk, approximately 2.5-fold less than in the yogurt extracts, suggesting that antimutagenic activity is associated with bacterial growth.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of a substance produced by the fungus Pycnoporus sanguineus (Fr.) Murr.
AB  - A fraction obtained from the culture fluids of Pycnoporus sanguineus fungus was shown to contain a compound with biological activity against strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Staphylococcus aureus and members of the genus Streptococcus. The fraction was clearly more active on Gram-positive cocci than on Gram-negative bacilli.
TI  - [Antimutagenic action of bacteria on mutagenesis induced by 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide in Salmonella typhimurium].
AB  - It is shown that in the presence of culture liquid and cells of Propionibacterium shermanii, P. pentosaceum, P. thoenii, P. coccoides, P. acnes, Lactobacillus delbrueckii, Streptococcus thermophilus, Str. faecalis, Bifidobacterium bifidum, and Escherichia coli AB 1157 the mutagenicity of 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (4-NQO) in Salmonella typhimurium TA 100 decreases significantly. The highest antimutagenic (desmutagenic) activity was found in culture liquid from all strains tested in the logarithmic growth phase; on aging of the cultures their antimutagenic activity decreased. The cells passaged in the medium containing 4-NQO demonstrate a higher antimutagenic activity than the control cells, and this effect is not related to the cell mutation. Young cultures of all studied propionic bacteria and of Str. faecalis release thiol compounds into medium. Thiol accumulation in culture liquid from P. shermanii between 10 and 24 h was accompanied by culture transition to the active growth. Over 24 h thiol content decreased. The maximal thiol accumulation by 24 h coincided with the maximal desmutagenic activity of the culture. It is suggested that desmutagenesis of the bacteria studied towards 4-NQO is connected with their production of reducing (possibly, sulfur-containing) compounds that inactivate electrophilic groups of the mutagen.
TI  - Molecular, genetic, and topological characterization of O-antigen chain length regulation in Shigella flexneri.
AB  - The rfb region of Shigella flexneri encodes the proteins required to synthesize the O-antigen component of its cell surface lipopolysaccharides (LPS). We have previously reported that a region adjacent to rfb was involved in regulating the length distribution of the O-antigen polysaccharide chains (D. F. Macpherson et al., Mol. Microbiol. 5:1491-1499, 1991). The gene responsible has been identified in Escherichia coli O75 (called rol [R. A. Batchelor et al., J. Bacteriol. 173:5699-5704, 1991]) and in E. coli O111 and Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium strain LT2 (called cld [D. A. Bastin et al., Mol. Microbiol. 5:2223-2231, 1991]). Through a combination of subcloning, deletion, and transposon insertion analysis, we have identified a gene adjacent to the S. flexneri rfb region which encodes a protein of 36 kDa responsible for the length distribution of O-antigen chains in LPS as seen on silver-stained sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. DNA sequence analysis identified an open reading frame (ORF) corresponding to the rol gene. The corresponding protein was almost identical in sequence to the Rol protein of E. coli O75 and was highly homologous to the functionally identical Cld proteins of E. coli O111 and S. enterica serovar typhimurium LT2. These proteins, together with ORF o349 adjacent to rfe, had almost identical hydropathy plots which predict membrane-spanning segments at the amino- and carboxy-terminal ends and a hydrophilic central region. We isolated a number of TnphoA insertions which inactivated the rol gene, and the fusion end points were determined. The PhoA+ Rol::PhoA fusion proteins had PhoA fused within the large hydrophilic central domain of Rol. These proteins were located in the whole-membrane fraction, and extraction with Triton X-100 indicated a cytoplasmic membrane location. This finding was supported by sucrose density gradient fractionation of the whole-cell membranes and of E. coli maxicells expressing L-[35S]methionine-labelled Rol protein. Hence, we interpret these data to indicate that the Rol protein is anchored into the cytoplasmic membrane via its amino- and carboxy-terminal ends but that the majority of the protein is located in the periplasmic space. To confirm that rol is responsible for the effects on O-antigen chain length observed with the cloned rfb genes in E. coli K-12, it was mutated in S. flexneri by insertion of a kanamycin resistance cartridge. The resulting strains produced LPS with O antigens of nonmodal chain length, thereby confirming the function of the rol gene product. We propose a model for the function of Rol protein in which it acts as a type of molecular chaperone to facilitate the interaction of the O-antigen ligase (RfaL) with the O-antigen polymerase (Rfc) and polymerized, acyl carrier lipid-linked, O-antigen chains. Analysis of the DNA sequence of the region identified a number of ORFs corresponding to the well-known gnd and hisIE genes. The rol gene was located immediately downstream of two ORFs with sequence similarity to the gene encoding UDPglucose dehydrogenase (HasB) of Streptococcus pyogenes. The ORFs arise because of a deletion or frameshift mutation within the gene we have termed udg (for UDPglucose dehydrogenase).
TI  - The history of live bacterial vaccines.
AB  - Recent developments have made it possible to construct non-reverting live bacterial vaccine candidates with defined deletions of two or more genes. Such vaccines have proven safe and immunogenic in human volunteers. Since the virulent parent strains are only pathogenic to man (S. typhi, S. flexneri, and V. cholerae), they pose no threat to the environment. Besides holding promise as efficacious vaccines for protection against typhoid fever, bacillary dysentery and cholera, the attenuated strains are well suited as vectors for delivery of heterologous antigenic epitopes from micro-organisms such as Helicobacter pylori, Neisseira gonorrhoeae, rotavirus, HIV and many others. Instead of using a virulent parent bacterium as the starting organism for making a vector, attempts have recently been made to employ non-pathogenic bacteria of the normal human flora, such as Streptococcus gordonii for delivery of foreign antigens. At present, the feasibility of this approach for human beings remains to be proven.

TI  - Oral immunization with recombinant Salmonella typhimurium expressing surface protein antigen A of Streptococcus sobrinus: persistence and induction of humoral responses in rats.
AB  - Recombinant Salmonella typhimurium has been used as an oral vaccine for various microbial pathogens. Here we report immune responses in Fischer rats orally immunized with a recombinant S. typhimurium strain encoding surface protein antigen A (SpaA) of Streptococcus sobrinus. The attenuated S. typhimurium chi 4072 delta cya delta crp delta asd mutant used in this study contains the Asd+ plasmid pYA2905 expressing a fragment of the SpaA protein. Salmonella cells were cleared from spleens by 7 days and from Peyer's patches by 14 days in rats receiving a single oral immunization of 10(9) CFU of chi 4072. In animals receiving multiple (i.e., days 0 and 7 or days 0, 7, and 21) immunizations, Salmonella cells were cleared from the Peyer's patches by 25 days following the initial immunization. Antigen-specific systemic and mucosal antibody responses were greater in rats receiving multiple immunizations than in those receiving a single immunization. Serum anti-Salmonella activity was potentiated following boosting on day 21. Mucosal immunoglobulin A antibody responses were also greater in rats receiving multiple immunizations than in rats receiving a single immunization. Anti-Salmonella and anti-Streptococcus immunoglobulin A activity persisted longer in rats boosted on day 21 than in rats immunized on days 0 and 7. These data indicate that oral immunization of rats with the recombinant S. typhimurium chi 4072(pYA2905) vaccine induces systemic as well as mucosal antibody responses specific to the Salmonella cells and to the cloned SpaA protein. This is the first report of the use of an attenuated mutant of the murine pathogen S. typhimurium as an oral vaccine in rats.
TI  - UDP-glucose dehydrogenase from bovine liver: primary structure and relationship to other dehydrogenases.
AB  - The primary structure of bovine liver UDP-glucose dehydrogenase (UDPGDH), a hexameric, NAD(+)-linked enzyme, has been determined at the protein level. The 52-kDa subunits are composed of 468 amino acid residues, with a free N-terminus and a Ser/Asn microhetergeneity at one position. The sequence shares 29.6% positional identity with GDP-mannose dehydrogenase from Pseudomonas, confirming a similarity earlier noted between active site peptides. This degree of similarity is comparable to the 31.1% identity vs. the UDPGDH from type A Streptococcus. Database searching also revealed similarities to a hypothetical sequence from Salmonella typhimurium and to "UDP-N-acetyl-mannosaminuronic acid dehydrogenase" from Escherichia coli. Pairwise identities between bovine UDPGDH and each of these sequences were all in the range of approximately 26-34%. Multiple alignment of all 5 sequences indicates common ancestry for these 4-electron-transferring enzymes. There are 27 strictly conserved residues, including a cysteine residue at position 275, earlier identified by chemical modification as the expected catalytic residue of the second half-reaction (conversion of UDP-aldehydoglucose to UDP-glucuronic acid), and 2 lysine residues, at positions 219 and 338, one of which may be the expected catalytic residue for the first half-reaction (conversion of UDP-glucose to UDP-aldehydoglucose). A GXGXXG pattern characteristic of the coenzyme-binding fold is found at positions 11-16, close to the N-terminus as with "short-chain" alcohol dehydrogenases.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Azotobacter vinelandii mutS: nucleotide sequence and mutant analysis.
AB  - An Azotobacter vinelandii homolog to the Salmonella typhimurium mutS gene was discovered upstream of the fdxA gene. The product of this gene is much more similar to S. typhimurium MutS than either is to the HexA protein of Streptococcus pneumoniae. An A. vinelandii delta mutS mutant strain was shown to have a spontaneous mutation frequency 65-fold greater than that of the wild type.
TI  - Neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis: a clinical study.
AB  - Necrotizing enterocolitis was found in 77 infants over a 5 year period. Diagnosis of NEC was established on 4.9 + 4.8 days in babies with birth weight of 1667 + 577 grams and the gestational age of 33.3 + 2.6 weeks. Definite disease occurred in 33 (42.9%) babies while there was strong suspicion in another 44 (57.1%) babies. Prefeed gastric residue (98.7%), abdominal distension (97.3%), lethargy (78.7%), hypotonia (60%) and jaundice (48%) were the main presenting features. However, blood in stools and abdominal wall erythema were found in 38.7% babies. About one third of infants had a positive blood culture. Pneumatosis intestinalis was present in 83.9% of babies and pneumoperitoneum was seen in 35.5% of neonates with NEC. Ileo-ceco-colic region was the commonest site of involvement. Overall survival was 61% and survival with Stage III was only 13%. Birth weight less than 1500 g, gestational age less than 32 weeks, erythema of the abdominal wall, intra-abdominal mass, portal venous gas in abdominal X-ray and Gram negative septicemia were associated with higher mortality.
TI  - Structural features of polysaccharides that induce intra-abdominal abscesses.
AB  - The capsular polysaccharide complex from Bacteroides fragilis promotes the formation of intra-abdominal abscesses--a pathologic host response to infecting microorganisms. This complex consists of two distinct polysaccharides, each with repeating units that have positively charged amino groups and negatively charged carboxyl or phosphate groups. Analysis of these polysaccharides as well as other charged carbohydrates before and after chemical modification revealed that these oppositely charged groups are required for the induction of intra-abdominal abscesses in a rat model.
TI  - Immune responses to Streptococcus sobrinus surface protein antigen A expressed by recombinant Salmonella typhimurium.
AB  - In this study, we used a vaccine strain of Salmonella typhimurium to express antigenic determinants of the SpaA antigen of Streptococcus sobrinus, which is involved in the caries-forming process. We cloned either a single repeat (pYA2901) or three tandem repeats (pYA2905) of the 0.48-kb fragment of the spaA gene, which codes for an important component of the SpaA protein, plus a 1.2-kb minor antigenic determinant and measured the resulting immune responses to SpaA in orally immunized BALB/c mice. The single or triple repeat of the spaA gene fragment was inserted into the Asd+ vector pYA292 and was transformed into the S. typhimurium delta cya delta crp vaccine strain chi 4072 containing delta asd in the chromosome. Female BALB/c mice were then orally immunized with two doses of the S. typhimurium containing either of the two SpaA constructs, and the immune responses to the expressed SpaA protein were assessed. Significant serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) anti-SpaA titers were detected in mice immunized with chi 4072(pYA2905) but not chi 4072(pYA2901). Salivary anti-SpaA IgA titers were minimal and were only detected in mice immunized with S. typhimurium expressing the SpaA encoded by pYA2905. Intestinal anti-SpaA IgA titers, however, were detected in both groups of mice, particularly in mice immunized with chi 4072(pYA2905). An oral booster 26 weeks after the initial series of immunizations resulted in increased serum IgG titers in both chi 4072(pYA2901)- and chi 4072(pYA2905)-immunized animals, particularly in the chi 4072(pYA2905)-immunized animals. No anamnestic IgA response was detected in the saliva following the booster immunization.
TI  - Escherichia coli heat-labile toxin subunit B fusions with Streptococcus sobrinus  antigens expressed by Salmonella typhimurium oral vaccine strains: importance of the linker for antigenicity and biological activities of the hybrid proteins.
AB  - A set of vectors possessing the genes for aspartate semialdehyde dehydrogenase (asd) and the B subunit of the heat-labile enterotoxin of Escherichia coli (LT-B) has been developed. These vectors allow operon or gene fusions of foreign gene epitopes at the C-terminal end of LT-B. Two groups of vectors have been constructed with and without leader sequences to facilitate placing of the foreign antigen in different cell compartments. Two Streptococcus sobrinus genes coding for principal colonization factors, surface protein antigen A (SpaA), and dextranase (Dex), have been fused into the 3' end of the LT-B gene. Resulting protein fusions of approximately 120 to 130 kDa are extremely well recognized by antibodies directed against both SpaA and Dex as well as against LT-B domains and retain the enzymatic activity of dextranase and the biological activity of LT-B in that they bind to GM1 gangliosides. Maximum antigenicity was obtained with the vector possessing an intervening linker of at least six amino acids with two proline residues. Some of the fusion proteins also exhibited another property of LT-B in that they were exported into the periplasm where they oligomerized. LT-B-SpaA and LT-B-Dex hybrid proteins are expressed stably and at a high level in avirulent Salmonella typhimurium vaccine strains which are being used to investigate their immunogenicity and types of induced immune responses. The fusion vectors will also be useful for production and purification of LT-B fusion antigens to be used and evaluated in other vaccine compositions.
TI  - Immunization of mice with Salmonella typhimurium C5 aroA expressing a genetically toxoided derivative of the pneumococcal toxin pneumolysin.
AB  - An attenuated Salmonella strain expressing a genetically toxoided derivative of the pneumococcal toxin pneumolysin was constructed by first transforming a methylation-positive, restriction-negative Salmonella with plasmid pJCP20M, a derivative of pBR322 containing the modified pneumolysin gene. Plasmid DNA was then extracted and transformed into Salmonella typhimurium C5 aroA. The transformant (denoted JM8) was capable of constitutively expressing the modified pneumolysin gene in vitro and stably maintained the recombinant plasmid containing the pneumococcal DNA, even in the absence of antibiotic selection. When JM8, or the parental Salmonella C5 aroA carrying pBR322 (denoted JM6), were administered orally to mice, both strains were capable of at least transient colonization of the Peyer's patches. Sera from JM8 mice (but not those fed JM6) had significant anti-pneumolysin IgG and IgA ELISA titres. Intraperitoneal administration of JM8 resulted in higher anti-pneumolysin IgG titres, but lower specific IgA levels.
TI  - Antigenotoxic properties of lactic acid bacteria in the S. typhimurium mutagenicity assay.
AB  - A high percentage of human tumors is reported to be related to dietary habits. One way to improve the nutritional impact is to increase the intake of protective factors, such as inhibitors of DNA damage and other types of anticarcinogens. Specific strains of lactic acid bacteria used to ferment milk are promising candidates that may be antimutagenic and anticarcinogenic. We have studied the antimutagenicity of 10 isolated strains of beneficial lactic acid bacteria. Four types of fermented milk products were also studied for their protective properties. The effect of these bacteria on the yield of revertants induced by nitrosated beef extract was investigated in the Salmonella typhimurium mutagenicity assay. Eight of 10 isolated Lactobacillus strains reduced the yield of his+ revertants almost back to the levels of the untreated controls. Different fermented fresh yogurts containing viable bacteria (probably Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus or Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacteria) showed protective effects as well. The degree of suppressing revertants was independent of the yogurt's fat content. In contrast, yogurt products that had been heat treated were not inhibitory. The other fresh fermented milk products (e.g., buttermilk, kefir, and "Dickmilch") were not antimutagenic in this study. The results imply that some bacteria used in milk processing have an antimutagenic potential and that this property is specific for the bacterial strain.
TI  - Cloning and sequencing of the melB gene encoding the melibiose permease of Salmonella typhimurium LT2.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of the melB gene coding for the Na+ (Li+)/melibiose symporter of Salmonella typhimurium LT2 was determined, and its amino acid sequence was deduced. It consists of 1428 bp, corresponding to a protein of 476 amino acid residues (calculated molecular weight 52,800). The amino acid sequence is homologous to that of the melibiose permease of Escherichia coli K12, with 85% identical residues. All, except one, of the amino acid residues that have been reported to be important for cation or substrate recognition in the melibiose permease of E. coli are conserved in the melibiose permease of S. typhimurium. In addition, part of the sequence resembles the lactose permease of Streptococcus thermophilus, the animal glucose transporter (GLUT1), the plasmid-coded raffinose permease (RafB), and the NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase chain 4 (Nuo4) of Aspergillus amstelodami.
TI  - A new alpha-helical coiled coil protein encoded by the Salmonella typhimurium virulence plasmid.
AB  - A new protein of Salmonella typhimurium was identified and characterized. The gene (tlpA) encoding this protein (TlpA) was isolated from the large virulence-associated plasmid of S. typhimurium and sequenced in order to predict the primary structure of TlpA. tlpA encodes a 371-amino acid soluble protein with a calculated M(r) of 41600 and pI of 4.63. Secondary structure predictions and sequence statistics of TlpA indicated a predominant alpha-helical configuration and presence of heptapeptide repeat motifs characteristic of coiled coil proteins. Purified TlpA was shown to have biochemical properties similar to those of coiled coil proteins, including adoption of an alpha-helical configuration and a tendency to form homodimers. Furthermore, TlpA possessed heat resistance, evidence for a chain register and altered mobility in urea/sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels which are characteristics of tropomyosins. TlpA shows 32% overall sequence similarity with rat cardiac myosin and 36% similarity with horse platelet beta-tropomyosin over 226 residues, whereas selected regions possessed significant sequence identities with myosins, tropomyosins, and alpha-helical surface proteins of Streptococcus pyogenes. Our results indicate that TlpA represents a new member of prokaryotic coiled coil proteins.
TI  - Flavin-linked peroxide reductases: protein-sulfenic acids and the oxidative stress response.
AB  - Sequence analyses of the Streptococcus faecalis NADH peroxidase and the flavoprotein component of the Salmonella typhimurium alkyl hydroperoxide reductase indicate clear evolutionary links with members of the flavoprotein disulfide reductase family. However, chemical and spectroscopic evidence demonstrate that the non-flavin redox center in NADH peroxidase is an unusual stabilized cysteine-sulfenic acid (Cys-SOH) derivative, and not a cystine disulfide as found in the disulfide reductases. This redox-active element, when appropriately stabilized by the respective protein environment, appears to play key roles in both the catalytic and regulatory aspects of the bacterial response to oxidative stress.
TI  - Antimutagenicity of milk cultured with lactic acid bacteria against N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine.
AB  - The antimutagenic effect of cultured milk using 71 strains of lactic acid bacteria belonging to the genus Lactobacillus, Streptococcus, Lactococcus, and Bifidobacterium on the mutagenicity of N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine was investigated in vitro using Salmonella typhimurium TA 100 as an indicator bacterium. Each cultured milk sample displayed its characteristic antimutagenic effect on the mutagenicity of N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine. The milk cultured with Lactobacillus acidophilus LA 106 (LA2) showed the highest inhibition of 77% against the mutagenicity of N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine among the strains tested. Changes in the antimutagenic effect of the milk cultured by Lb. acidophilus LA 106 (LA2) during incubation were also examined using N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine as a mutagen.
TI  - Salmonella neck abscess associated with jugular vein thrombosis.
AB  - An unusual case of synergistic infection caused by Salmonella paratyphi and anaerobic streptococcus resulting in necrotizing cervical infection associated with deep neck abscess and internal jugular vein thrombosis, is presented. Salmonella acting as an oxygen consumer in the infected tissues, facilitates the growth of anaerobic cocci, hence the development of a devastating soft tissue infection. The precipitating cause was a tonsillar infection developing due to 'post-anginal sepsis'. The aetiopathogenesis of the cervical infection is discussed.
TI  - Altering the conserved nucleotide binding motif in the Salmonella typhimurium MutS mismatch repair protein affects both its ATPase and mismatch binding activities.
AB  - The Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli MutS protein is one of several methyl-directed mismatch repair proteins that act together to correct replication errors. MutS is homologous to the Streptococcus pneumoniae HexA mismatch repair protein and to the Duc1 and Rep1 proteins of human and mouse. Homology between the deduced amino acid sequence of both MutS and HexA, and the type A nucleotide binding site consensus sequence, suggested that ATP binding and hydrolysis play a role in their mismatch repair functions. We found that MutS does indeed weakly hydrolyze ATP to ADP and Pi, with a Km of 6 microM and kcat of 0.26. To show that this activity is intrinsic to MutS, we made a site-directed mutation, which resulted in the invariant lysine of the nucleotide binding consensus sequence being changed to an alanine. The mutant MutS allele was unable to complement a mutS::Tn10 mutation in vivo, and was dominant over wild type when present in high copy number. The purified mutant protein had reduced ATPase activity, with the Km affected more severely than the kcat. Like the wild type MutS protein, the mutant protein is able to bind heteroduplex DNA specifically, but the mutant protein does so with a reduced affinity.
TI  - Requirement of the conformational stability of a Salmonella ribosomal vaccine for its mouse protection.
AB  - The 43-kDa non-O antigenic component isolated from the crude ribosomal fraction of Salmonella typhimurium [9] was further purified by affinity chromatography (43-kDa protein: 43-kDp). Immunization with 43-kDp did not induce complete mouse protection in CF1 mice to 500 LD50 of S. typhimurium, although it elicited a substantial IgG antibody response. The 43-kDp exhibited the mitogenicity to splenocytes (CF1 and C3H/HeJ) and B cell-rich populations (CF1). Complexing 43-kDp with the compact ribosomes of Streptococcus pyogenes by formaldehyde (complex vaccine: CV) elicited both IgM and IgG antibodies to 43-kDp. CV induced a boosting effect to enhance IgG antibody response. Moreover, CV generated delayed-type hypersensitivity to salmonella antigens and also conferred complete protection against 500 LD50 challenge of S. typhimurium to CF1 mice. These abilities of CV were reduced or impaired by RNase digestion. CV was able to induce partial or complete protection in inbred mouse strains (C3H/HeN, C3H/HeJ, DBA/2 and A/J). These data, in addition to other reports, suggest that conformational stability between ribosomes and contaminating substances such as 43-kDp or O-antigens might be required for the overall effects of the ribosomal vaccine.
TI  - [The adhesion of pathogenic microflora on carbon sorbents].
AB  - The adsorbing activity of granulated carbonic sorbents SKN and KAU, as well as their oxidated forms, containing protogenic carboxylic and phenolic groups with respect to Shigella flexneri, Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa pathogenic strains has been studied. As shown in this study, the process of interaction between microorganisms and carbonic sorbents has two stages. At the first stage the main role is played by long-distance electrostatic forces and at the second stage, by Van der Waals short-distance forces, as well as bonds formed between cell structures and surface groupings of carbonaceous materials. In the mechanism of interaction between microbial cells and carbons the geometry of carbon surface plays an important role. KAU(0)-1 exhibits the highest degree of adhesion with respect to pathogenic bacteria.
TI  - Inhibition of Clostridium tyrobutyricum by bacteriocin-like substances produced by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria were selected for their inhibitory activity against Clostridium tyrobutyricum under conditions that eliminate the effects of lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide. Four strains were isolated belonging to the species Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis. The sensitivity of the inhibitory substances to pronase and trypsine indicates that they are proteins or peptides different from nisin. Their resistance to phospholipase D indicates that they are also different from lactostrepcin. The inhibitory substances are produced during the exponential phase of growth. Their activity is bactericidal and directed toward some strains of Clostridium tyrobutyricum, Lactobacillus helveticus, and Streptococcus thermophilus, but strains used as dairy starters, Lactobacillus lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus, and Propionibacterium shermanii, are not all affected by the inhibition.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence and analysis of the Vibrio alginolyticus sucrose uptake-encoding region.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of the Vibrio alginolyticus sucrose uptake-encoding region was determined, and contained two genes, scrA and scrK. The scrA gene encodes an enzyme IISucrose (EIIScr) protein of the phosphoenolpyruvate dependent phosphotransferase system and the scrK gene encodes a fructokinase. The deduced amino acid (aa) sequence for the V. alginolyticus EIIScr protein was homologous with the EIIScr proteins from Streptococcus mutans, Salmonella typhimurium (pUR400 system) and Bacillus subtilis. The deduced aa sequence for the V. alginolyticus fructokinase was homologous with the Escherichia coli enzymes, 6-phosphofructokinase (isoenzyme 2) and ribokinase. Transposon phoA mutagenesis experiments indicated that the EIIScr protein was a membrane-bound protein with a region that extended into the periplasm.
TI  - Cloning and characterization of the asd gene of Salmonella typhimurium: use in stable maintenance of recombinant plasmids in Salmonella vaccine strains.
AB  - The asd mutants of Salmonella typhimurium have an obligate requirement for diaminopimelic acid (DAP) and will undergo lysis in environments deprived of DAP. This has allowed the development of a balanced-lethal system for the expression of heterologous antigens in vaccine strains using vectors containing the wild-type asd gene from Streptococcus mutans and asd mutant Salmonella hosts [Nakayama et al., Biotechnology 6 (1988) 693-697]. We have cloned the asd gene from S. typhimurium, characterized the gene product and used this gene to construct Asd+ expression cloning vectors. In addition we have constructed an asd cassette and a transposon derived from Tn5 that allow the rapid modification of other vectors for use with delta asd vaccine strains of S. typhimurium adding versatility to the Asd+ vector/delta asd host system of plasmid maintenance.
TI  - Evaluation of thiol broth for the culture of Salmonella typhi and other bacteria  from blood.
AB  - Thiol broth is known to neutralize various antimicrobial agents. Positivity of growth of various species of bacteria from blood in thiol broth was reported as similar to that in tryptic soy broth (TSB). As blood cultures are often used for the diagnosis of typhoid fever, and as patients may receive antimicrobial therapy before blood culture, the positivity and rapidity of growth of Salmonella typhi in thiol broth were compared to those in TSB. Routine blood culture samples from Yonsei Medical Center patients were inoculated in 50-ml amounts of TSB and thiol broth. The media were prepared from dehydrated products and did not contain CO2, but TSB contained 0.025% sodium polyanethol sulfonate (SPS). Growth of S. paratyphi-A, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter sp., Serratia marcescens and alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus were similar in both media. However, greater positivity and shorter incubation time for macroscopic detection were noted in TSB with S. typhi, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. It is concluded that thiol broth is inferior to TSB plus SPS for the culture of S. typhi from blood.
TI  - [Control of the mutagenicity of a new immunomodulator].
AB  - New immunostimulator STP, peptide isolated from the cultivation medium of Streptococcus species producer strain TOM-1606 by chromatographic purification, was controlled for mutagenicity. The preparation, introduced into mice in doses of 6.7 X 10(2) - 6.7 X 10(4) micrograms/kg, i.e. exceeding the stimulating dose 1000-fold, did not induce the appearance of micronuclei in polychromatophilic erythrocytes of the marrow, the fixation of the material being made 24, 48 and 72 hours after the injection. In Ames' test on Salmonella typhimurium strains TA 98 and TA 100 neither native STP, nor STP activated with the microsomal fraction of rat liver enzymes did not increase the frequency of reversions to histidine independence. The absence of mutagenic properties in STP was demonstrated by the parallel pronounced genotoxic action of a number of known mutagens used as positive controls.
TI  - Sandwich enzyme immunoassays for detection of Salmonella typhi.
AB  - Enzyme immunoassays were developed using monoclonal antibodies raised against somatic (O), flagellar (H) and capsular (Vi) antigens of Salmonella typhi. The assay based on anti-O monoclonal antibodies could specifically detect S. typhi and soluble lipopolysaccharide (LPS) isolated from S. typhi. Anti-H MoAbs detected motile S. typhi and soluble flagellar antigen. Monoclonal antibodies against capsular polysaccharide could detect Vi-containing S. typhi as well as soluble Vi antigen. The three assays reported here detected S. typhi with 100% sensitivity in blood culture broths obtained from bacteriologically confirmed typhoid patients and were negative with blood specimens containing Salmonella senftenberg, E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis or Streptococcus (alpha-hemolytic) derived from patients with pyrexia. The assays, however, did not demonstrate the presence of soluble antigens in sera and urine samples obtained from typhoid patients.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence of the Streptococcus pneumoniae hexB mismatch repair gene: homology of HexB to MutL of Salmonella typhimurium and to PMS1 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
AB  - The Hex mismatch repair system of Streptococcus pneumoniae acts both during transformation (a recombination process that directly produces heteroduplex DNA) to correct donor strands and after DNA replication to remove misincorporated nucleotides. The hexB gene product is one of at least two proteins required for mismatch repair in this organism. The nucleotide sequence of a 2.7-kilobase segment from the S. pneumoniae chromosome that includes the 1.95-kilobase hexB gene was determined. The gene encodes a 73.5-kilodalton protein (649 residues). The spontaneous hex Rx chromosomal mutant allele with which a mutator phenotype has been associated is shown to result from a single base substitution (TAC to TAA) leading to a truncated HexB polypeptide (484 residues). The HexB protein is homologous to the MutL protein, which is required for methyl-directed mismatch repair in Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli, and to the PMS1 gene product, which is likely to be involved in a mismatch correction system in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The conservation of HexB-like proteins among procaryotic and eucaryotic organisms indicates that these proteins play an important common role in the repair process. This finding also suggests that the Hex, Mut, and PMS systems evolved from a common ancestor and that functionally similar mismatch repair systems could be widespread among procaryotic as well as eucaryotic organisms.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence of the Salmonella typhimurium mutL gene required for mismatch repair: homology of MutL to HexB of Streptococcus pneumoniae and to PMS1 of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
AB  - The mutL gene of Salmonella typhimurium LT2 is required for dam-dependent methyl-directed DNA mismatch repair. We have cloned and sequenced the mutL gene of S. typhimurium LT2 and compared its sequence with those of the hexB gene product of the gram-positive bacterium Streptococcus pneumoniae and the PMS1 gene product of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. MutL was found to be quite similar to the HexB mismatch repair protein of S. pneumoniae and to the mismatch repair protein PMS1 of the yeast S. cerevisiae. The significant similarities among these proteins were confined to their amino-terminal regions and suggest common evolution of the mismatch repair machinery in those organisms. The DNA sequence for mutL predicted a gene encoding a protein of 618 amino acid residues with a molecular weight of 67,761. The assignment of reading frame was confirmed by the construction of a chimeric protein consisting of the first 30 amino acids of LacZ fused to residues 53 through 618 of MutL. Interestingly, the presence of excess amounts of this fusion protein in wild-type mutL+ cells resulted in a trans-dominant effect causing the cell to exhibit a high spontaneous mutation frequency.
TI  - Biocidal activity of ozone versus formaldehyde against poultry pathogens inoculated in a prototype setter.
AB  - Ozone was evaluated as an alternative hatchery disinfectant to replace formaldehyde in the event that the Environmental Protection Agency regulates the use of formaldehyde under the Toxic Substances Control Act. Cultures of Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, and Bacillus species previously isolated from poultry hatcheries and selected culture collections of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas fluorescences, Salmonella typhimurium, Proteus species, and Aspergillus fumigatus were spread-plated on open petri plates and independently fumigated with ozone or formaldehyde in a prototype laboratory poultry setter. Ozone (1.52% to 1.65% by weight) resulted in bacterial reductions of greater than 4 to 7 log10 and fungal reductions of greater than 4 log10, whereas formaldehyde achieved reductions of greater than 7 log10 and greater than 5 log10, respectively, after 8 min of exposure to either disinfectant. Potential mutagenic effects were observed in ozonated E. coli colonies resulting in decreased superoxide dismutase activity and increased catalase activity when compared with nonozonated control colonies. In this study ozone reduced microorganism counts but not as much as formaldehyde. Ozone may be used as a disinfectant against selected microorganisms, although further testing under actual hatchery conditions is needed before making recommendations to the industry.
TI  - Effect of immune globulin intravenous on opsonization of bacteria by classic and  alternative complement pathways in premature serum.
AB  - The mechanisms involved in the effect of immune globulin intravenous (IGIV) on bacterial opsonization by both complement pathways in premature serum were elucidated in this study. Of the bacteria used, Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella enteritidis were nonencapsulated while Streptococcus pyogenes and Escherichia coli 07 K1 were encapsulated. As demonstrated by indirect immunofluorescence, IGIV showed specific antibody titers of 1:32 for S. aureus and S. enteritidis and of 1:8 for S. pyogenes and E. coli 07 K1. IGIV alone had no direct opsonic activity against these organisms. Addition of IGIV did not alter the opsonic activity of normal adult serum against these organisms. In contrast, addition of IGIV promoted the opsonic activity of premature serum against the nonencapsulated bacteria to levels matching that in normal adult serum. The IGIV preparation significantly improved the opsonization of bacteria by the classic (from 39 to 68% of that in adult serum) and alternative (from 22 to 97% of that in adult serum) complement pathways in premature serum. IGIV also markedly augmented C3 deposition on the bacteria by both complement pathways. These studies suggest that IGIV containing high titers of specific antibodies promote opsonization of bacteria by the enhancement of complement pathway activation, especially the alternative pathway, in premature serum.
TI  - Effect of various adjuvants on the antibody response of mice to pneumococcal polysaccharides.
AB  - Adjuvant effects on the serum antibody response to pneumococcal polysaccharide (pps) types 3 and 14 were studied in BALB/c mice. First, dose responses were established for the two pps types and were found to be entirely different. High (5 micrograms) and low (0.005 microgram) doses of pps 3 induced antigen-specific unresponsiveness and suppression, while 0.1 microgram induced an optimal response. The secondary response to a single dose of killed pneumococci or 0.1 microgram of pps 3 injected 2 weeks later was not higher than the primary response. Nu/Nu, athymic BALB/c mice showed high but not low dose tolerance to pps 3. In contrast, no convincing evidence for high dose tolerance to pps 14 was obtained: 25 micrograms of pps 14 induced an optimal response, whereas 0.2-0.5 microgram induced antigen-specific suppression. Secondary anti-pps 14 IgM and IgG responses, even after optimal primary doses, were only slightly higher than primary responses to a single dose of killed bacteria. Athymic BALB/c mice showed lower IgG antibody responses than euthymic mice to pps 14. Injection of detoxified endotoxin (D-LPS) 2-4 days after antigen enhanced both primary and secondary responses and reversed high dose tolerance induction. Injection of D-LPS also at least partially prevented the induction of low dose tolerance as did injection of interleukin-1, but normuramyl dipeptide (nor-MDP) failed to affect the responses to pps 3 and 14. Coupling of muramyl tripeptide to pps 3 rendered the pps more immunogenic. Administration of emulsified pps in squalene arlacel, particularly with nor-MDP incorporated in the mixture, appeared to induce a better 7S antibody response than did pps in saline, but these serum antibody levels were not sustained at a high level. Pretreatment with IgD or simultaneous injection of IgD with pps 14 enhanced both primary and secondary responses. The response to pps 3 was only slightly enhanced and low dose tolerance was not prevented by pretreatment with IgD.
TI  - Recombinant avirulent Salmonella vaccine strains with stable maintenance and high level expression of cloned genes in vivo.
AB  - Salmonella typhimurium strains with deletion (delta) of the adenylate cyclase (cya) and cyclic AMP receptor protein (crp) genes are avirulent for mice and induce a high level of protective immunity to oral challenge with up to 10,000 times what would be a lethal dose of wild-type virulent S. typhimurium cells. This immunity begins as early as seven days after immunization and lasts for at least four months. S. typhimurium delta cya delta crp mutants stably maintain plasmids and give high-level expression of cloned gene products; in this they appear superior to other avirulent S. typhimurium strains. S. typhimurium delta cya delta crp strains with a delta asd mutation (abolishing production of aspartate beta-semialdehyde dehydrogenase), have an obligate requirement for diaminopimelic acid (DAP). This strain can be used in conjunction with plasmid vectors lacking antibiotic resistance markers but having the wild-type asd+ gene from Streptococcus mutans to complement the delta asd chromosomal mutation. The Asd+ plasmid vector can be used to express a diversity of colonization and virulence antigens from other pathogens. In the delta cya delta crp delta asd S. typhimurium vaccine strain, the plasmid is completely stable in the absence of any exogenous selective pressure either in vitro or in vivo.
TI  - Bacterial hydrophobicity, an overall parameter for the measurement of adhesion potential to soil particles.
AB  - The adhesion of Salmonella typhimurium to the mineral particles quartz, albite, feldspar, and magnetite was shown to correlate with the hydrophobicity of the cell surface as measured by hydrophobic interaction chromatography. The same effects were also seen for seven other selected test strains, including Streptococcus faecalis, Streptococcus faecium, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, Shigella sonnei, and Shigella boydii. When the test strain of Salmonella typhimurium, was repeatedly cultivated in Luria broth, thus selecting for different degrees of fimbriation and roughness of the cell surface, varied cell hydrophobicity but constant negative and positive charge values were obtained. High hydrophobicity values always coincided with enhanced adhesion to the mineral particles. The negative charge of the bacterial surface as measured by electrostatic interaction chromatography appeared to play no role in the adhesion event. However, the positive charges on the cell surface contributed to the adhesion process. This was especially evident for cells exhibiting a high degree of hydrophobicity. Alteration of the pH between 4 and 9 did not significantly affect the adhesion process.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance in the tropics. 2. Some thoughts on the epidemiology and clinical significance of bacterial resistance to antimicrobial agents.
AB  - This paper discusses the prevalence of antibiotic resistance in Enterobacteriaceae, respiratory infections and gonorrhoeae in tropical countries, assesses its significance and clinical relevance, and considers how the spread of such resistance might be halted by educative policies.

TI  - Inactivation of bacteria by Purogene.
AB  - The bacteriocidal efficacy of Purogene, a stabilized aqueous solution of chlorine dioxide (ClO2) was examined using bacteria of concern to public health. The organisms tested were: Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Yersinia enterocolitica, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes Group A, Salmonella typhimurium and Bacillus subtilis. The test organisms responded differently to inactivation by Purogene. At least a 4 log reduction in bacterial counts was noted when Purogene was applied at a concentration of 0.75 mg/l. Since Purogene is a stabilized complex, it was necessary to provide a chemical environment suitable for the release of ClO2 in this solution. This was done by varying the pH of Purogene from 3.5 to 8.6 (pH of Purogene is 8.6) while keeping the pH of the experimental medium constant (pH 7.0). The results showed that Purogene was most efficacious at the lowest pH tested (pH 3.5). This indicates that as chlorine dioxide solutions were reduced to chlorite (which predominates at pH 8.6), their bacteriocidal efficacy was reduced, suggesting free chlorine dioxide as the active disinfecting species.
TI  - Avirulent Salmonella typhimurium delta cya delta crp oral vaccine strains expressing a streptococcal colonization and virulence antigen.
AB  - Salmonella typhimurium SR-11 strains lacking adenylate cyclase and the cyclic AMP receptor protein (CRP) due to deletion (delta) mutations in the cya and crp genes, respectively, are avirulent for mice and induce high level protective immunity against subsequent challenge with wild-type virulent S. typhimurium SR-11 cells. The avirulence of these delta cya delta crp mutants has been enhanced by elimination of the 100 kb virulence plasmid pStSR100 without impairing immunogenicity. The present report confirms the avirulence and immunogenicity of these mutant strains, demonstrates that immunization of both four- and eight-week-old mice has no adverse effect on weight gain, and that immunity lasts at least ninety days following initial immunization. Avirulent S. typhimurium strains have been endowed with the ability to produce several streptococcal colonization and virulence antigens for the purpose of constructing recombinant bivalent oral vaccine strains. Important antigenic determinants of the Streptococcus sobrinus surface protein antigen A (SpaA), presumed to be a critical colonization antigen of S. sobrinus, are expressed at high level by the delta cya delta crp S. typhimurium strains. The recombinant vaccine strains are stable in vitro and in animals (for a period of at least eight days) where they localize to the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT).
TI  - Nucleotide sequence of the Salmonella typhimurium mutS gene required for mismatch repair: homology of MutS and HexA of Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - The mutS gene product of Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium is one of at least four proteins required for methyl-directed mismatch repair in these organisms. A functionally similar repair system in Streptococcus pneumoniae requires the hex genes. We have sequenced the S. typhimurium mutS gene, showing that it encodes a 96-kilodalton protein. Amino-terminal amino acid sequencing of purified S. typhimurium MutS protein confirmed the initial portion of the deduced amino acid sequence. The S. typhimurium MutS protein is homologous to the S. pneumoniae HexA protein, suggesting that they arose from a common ancestor before the gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria diverged. Overall, approximately 36% of the amino acids of the two proteins are identical when the sequences are optimally aligned, including regions of stronger homology which are of particular interest. One such region is close to the amino terminus. Another, located closer to the carboxy terminus, includes homology to a consensus sequence thought to be diagnostic of nucleotide-binding sites. A third one, adjacent to the second, is homologous to the consensus sequence for the helix-turn-helix motif found in many DNA-binding proteins. We found that the S. typhimurium MutS protein can substitute for the E. coli MutS protein in vitro as it can in vivo, but we have not yet been able to demonstrate a similar in vitro complementation by the S. pneumoniae HexA protein.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence of the hexA gene for DNA mismatch repair in Streptococcus pneumoniae and homology of hexA to mutS of Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium.
AB  - The Hex system of heteroduplex DNA base mismatch repair operates in Streptococcus pneumoniae after transformation and replication to correct donor and nascent DNA strands, respectively. A functionally similar system, called Mut, operates in Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium. The nucleotide sequence of a 3.8-kilobase segment from the S. pneumoniae chromosome that includes the 2.7-kilobase hexA gene was determined. An open reading frame that could encode a 17-kilodalton polypeptide (OrfC) was located just upstream of the gene encoding a polypeptide of 95 kilodaltons corresponding to HexA. Shine-Dalgarno sequences and putative promoters were identified upstream of each protein start site. Insertion mutations showed that only HexA functioned in mismatch repair and that the promoter for hexA transcription was located within the OrfC-coding region. The HexA polypeptide contains a consensus sequence for ATP- or GTP-binding sites in proteins. Comparison of the entire HexA protein sequence to that of MutS of S. typhimurium, which was determined by Haber et al. in the accompanying paper (L. T. Haber, P. P. Pang, D. I. Sobell, J. A. Mankovitch, and G. C. Walker, J. Bacteriol. 170:197-202, 1988), showed the proteins to be homologous, inasmuch as 36% of their amino acid residues were identical. This homology indicates that the Hex and Mut systems of mismatch repair evolved from an ancestor common to the gram-positive streptococci and the gram-negative enterobacteria. It is the first direct evidence linking the two systems.
TI  - Adherence of specific yogurt micro-organisms to human peripheral blood lymphocytes.
AB  - Yogurt lactic-acid-bacteria (LAB) consisting of Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus were evaluated for their capacity to bind to human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL). These micro-organisms adhere to human T lymphocytes, and bind to B lymphocytes, in high and low frequencies, respectively. In addition, a quantitative analysis of LAB binding to PBL was carried out using the same parameters previously applied to a Salmonella model. The effect of yogurt LAB on the natural anti-bacterial activity exerted by PBL was examined. Lymphocyte pretreatment with bacteria did not affect such functions. These findings are discussed in the light of the well known ability of yogurt LAB to modulate the immune response.
TI  - [The use of UV rays for the disinfection of water. I. Microbiologic studies of drinking water].
AB  - As a physical disinfection method without chemicals required the ultraviolet irradiation was tested for disinfection of drinking water. The survival was measured as a function of exposure to radiation for S. enteritidis, E. cloacae, C. freundii, S. marcescens, E. coli, K. pneumoniae und S. faecium. The bacteria were grown in trypton soya broth until they were well into the exponential phase. Two different UV-disinfection units were tested. Both consist of cylindrical shaped chambers with one low-pressure mercury-discharge lamp with their longitudinal axis parallel to the chambers. With 10(6) cfu/ml the experiments were done with three different rates of flow of 7,2 m3/h, 4,0 m3/h and 2,0 m3/h. The minimum exposures to radiation necessary to cause a 99.999% reduction were 10-86 mWs/cm2 depending on the test bacterium and on the UV-disinfection unit. The minimum doses ranged for S. enteritidis up to 13 mWs/cm2, for E. coli up to 21 mWs/cm2, for K. pneumoniae up to 39 mWs/cm2, for S. faecium up to 42 mWs/cm2, for E. cloacae up to 43 mWs/cm2, for C. freundii up to 72 mWs/cm2, and for S. marcescens up to 86 mWs/cm2.
TI  - Ceftriaxone in the treatment of bacterial meningitis in adults.
AB  - Twenty-six adults with acute bacterial meningitis were enrolled in an open randomized comparative study. The organisms isolated from CSF were Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhi. 13 patients (group A) were treated once daily with intravenous ceftriaxone (Rocephin). The 13 patients in group B received ampicillin or ampicillin plus chloramphenicol in 4 doses/day. The mean duration of therapy in groups A and B was 9.9 and 12.3 days, respectively. This difference in the duration of therapy was statistically significant. All patients from group A showed clinical improvement and all were bacteriologically cured. In group B only 12 patients were clinically and bacteriologically cured; 1 patient had to be withdrawn from the therapy because CSF culture remained positive after 48 h of therapy. Ceftriaxone was well tolerated in all patients; ampicillin or ampicillin plus chloramphenicol were associated with diarrhea and skin rash in 6 patients.
TI  - Enhancement of host resistance against Salmonella typhimurium infection by a diet supplemented with yogurt.
AB  - The effect of a diet supplemented with yogurt containing live lactobacilli (LAB)  - Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus - on the response of inbred mice to infection with Salmonella typhimurium was elaborated. The results of our experiments were consistent with the hypothesis that modifications of the microflora influence the adherence of S. typhimurium to intestinal mucosa, the natural antibacterial activity of the Peyer's patches lymphocytes, the accumulation of the macrophages in the liver, the proliferative responses of the splenocytes. The relationship between modifications of the immune response following ingestion of yogurt with live LAB and increased defense mechanisms was confirmed by the bacterial counts in livers and spleens and by the reduced mortality to S. typhimurium infection.
TI  - [Extraintestinal isolation of Salmonella in chickens: epidemiologic study of 3 salmonellosis outbreaks after ingestion of raw eggs].
AB  - A taxonomic analysis of the malolactic microflora present in nine grape samples from different zones of Galicia, was carried out. Nineteen strains were isolated and identified as Lactobacillus plantarum (42%), L. brevis (10.6%), L. casei (5.25%), L. hilgardii (5.25%), Streptococcus cremoris (5.25%), Leuconostoc lactis (5.25%), L. oenos (10.6%), and Pediococcus acidilactici (15.8%).
TI  - Mycotic carotid aneurysm.
AB  - Mycotic aneurysms of the extracranial internal carotid artery are rare; they usually appear as an enlarging pulsatile neck mass with associated pain, tenderness, and fever. This case report illustrates the need for prompt diagnosis and urgent surgical intervention. The most common organisms found with these aneurysms have been Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. We report a case of a mycotic internal carotid artery aneurysm resulting from Salmonella enteritidis. A 20-year review of both the foreign and English language literature revealed only one other case of a mycotic carotid aneurysm resulting from Salmonella infection. The cornerstone of therapy in the past had been proximal ligation. More recently, primary reconstructive procedures with either an end-to-end anastomosis or an interposition vein graft have been described. The present case was managed with an end-to-end technique with the use of a Pruitt-Inahara shunt.
TI  - Anti-infectious activity of liposomal muramyl dipeptides in immunodeficient CBA/N mice.
AB  - Two muramyl dipeptides, N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanyl-D-isoglutamine and its adjuvant-inactive isomer N-acetylmuramyl-D-alanyl-D-isoglutamine, were examined for their ability to protect mice carrying the CBA/N immune deficiency gene (xid) against lethal bacterial challenge. Prophylactic treatment with N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanyl-d-isoglutamine gave significant protection against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Salmonella typhimurium, and Salmonella enteritidis infection. N-Acetylmuramyl-D-alanyl-D-isoglutamine was unable to confer protection. Incorporation of the lipophilic glycerol dipalmitate derivatives of the two muramyl dipeptides within liposomal carriers resulted in a significant enhancement of anti-infectious activity, both with respect to number of survivors and length of survival. Liposomal muramyl dipeptides were 10- to 15-fold more potent than free muramyl dipeptide; enhanced potency was most evident with N-acetylmuramyl-D-alanyl-D-isoglutamine. Prophylactic treatment with liposomes containing the lipophilic muramyl dipeptides resulted in enhanced clearance of bacteria from the blood (greater than 3-fold increase in rate) when compared with that of hydrosoluble N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanyl-D-isoglutamine, indicating a correlation between reticuloendothelial stimulation and anti-infectious activity.
TI  - Differentiation and interaction of secretory immunoglobulin A and a calcium-dependent parotid agglutinin for several bacterial strains.
AB  - Previous studies have suggested that both secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) and various nonimmunoglobulin salivary glycoproteins are capable of agglutinating a variety of bacteria. The present study was designed to compare the nature of the agglutinins for Streptococcus mutans and Salmonella typhimurium in parotid saliva and colostrum. S. mutans was aggregated by saliva and colostrum, whereas S. typhimurium was aggregated only by saliva as detected by a spectrophotometric method. The principal salivary agglutinin for both S. mutans and S. typhimurium was calcium dependent and could be desorbed in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 6.8). In contrast, the colostral agglutinin was calcium independent and not readily desorbed. The agglutinin activities of saliva and colostrum for S. mutans were additive, suggesting independent target sites on the bacterial surface. The agglutinin activity of colostrum was totally associated with sIgA as was suggested by blocking of the agglutinating activity with anti-alpha-chain serum and the absence of blocking with an antibody specific for salivary agglutinin. Interestingly, anti-alpha-chain serum removed all agglutinating activity from saliva, but not from the phosphate-buffered saline-desorbed agglutinin. Dialysis of parotid saliva against 0.1 M disodium EDTA eliminated the agglutinin blocking activity of anti-alpha-chain serum but not that of the antiagglutinin antibody. The ability of anti-alpha-chain serum to block agglutination of the EDTA-dialyzed saliva could be restored by the addition of calcium chloride, suggesting that sIgA and salivary agglutinin are associated through a calcium-mediated interaction. These results indicate that bacterial agglutinating activity of colostrum, as detected spectrophotometrically, is mediated by sIgA, and that of saliva is mainly dependent upon a calcium-dependent nonimmunoglobulin agglutinin. The agglutinating activities of sIgA and parotid agglutinin seem to be additive, and their calcium-dependent association may favor the enhancement of their respective activities.

TI  - A survey of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus zooepidemicus, Salmonella spp., Bordetella bronchiseptica and Sendai virus in guinea pig colonies in Japan.
AB  - S. pneumoniae, S. zooepidemicus, Salmonella spp., B. bronchiseptica and Sendai virus were examined in a total of 45 guinea pig colonies (17 institutional and 28 breeder's colonies) of Hartley strain, and found to be positive in 6, 3, 5, 20 and 14 colonies, respectively. Sendai virus was highly prevalent among guinea pigs, showing so high rates positive as 80 to 100% of animals obtained from 11 of the 14 contaminated colonies. B. bronchiseptica was also shown to be prevalent within contaminated colonies by indication of rates positive more than 40% of animals examined in 14 of the 20 colonies. Infection rates of other 3 pathogens, however, ranged from lower than 20% to higher than 80% according to colonies. All strains of Salmonella isolated in this survey were identified as S. typhimurium and those of S. pneumoniae as serotype 19F.
TI  - Antimutagenic properties of lactic acid-cultured milk on chemical and fecal mutagens.
AB  - The antimutagenic properties of milk cultured with Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus were examined using streptomycin-dependent strains of Salmonella in an in vitro assay system. The mutagens utilized for testing included 2-(2-furyl)-3-(5-nitro-2-furyl) acrylamide, 4-nitroquinoline-N-oxide, and fecal mutagenic extracts from cats, monkeys, dogs, and other mammals. Both types of cultured milk exhibited antimutagenic activity on all mutagens used. Antimutagenic activities of the cultured milks with 2-(2-furyl)-3-(5-nitro-2-furyl) acrylamide and 4-nitroquinoline-N-oxide increased with incubation time but were thermolabile beyond 55 degrees C for 10 min.
TI  - In vivo repackaging of recombinant cosmid molecules for analyses of Salmonella typhimurium, Streptococcus mutans, and mycobacterial genomic libraries.
AB  - Strains of Escherichia coli K-12 were constructed that permitted the amplification of in vitro-packaged recombinant cosmid-transducing particles by in vivo repackaging of recombinant cosmid molecules. Thermal induction of these thermoinducible, excision-defective lysogens containing recombinant cosmid molecules yielded high titers of packaged recombinant cosmids and low levels of PFU. These strains were used to amplify packaged recombinant cosmid libraries of Mycobacterium leprae, Mycobacterium vaccae, Salmonella typhimurium, and Streptococcus mutans DNA. Contiguous and noncontiguous libraries were compared for the successful identification of cloned genes. Construction of noncontiguous libraries allowed the dissociation of desired genes from genes that were deleterious to the survival of a cosmid recombinant and permitted selection for unlinked traits that resulted in a selected phenotype. In vivo repackaging of recombinant cosmids permitted amplification of the original in vitro-packaged collection of transducing particles, storage of cosmid libraries as phage lysates, facilitation of complementation screening, expression analysis of repackaged recombinant cosmids after UV-irradiated cells were infected, in situ enzyme or immunological screening, and facilitation of recovery of recombinant cosmid molecules containing transposon inserts.
TI  - Comparison of inflammatory reactions induced by intraarticular injection of bacterial cell wall polymers.
AB  - Cell wall polymers isolated from group A streptococci, as well as lipopolysaccharide from Salmonella typhimurium and synthetic muramyl dipeptide, were injected into the ankle joints of rats. The inflammatory responses were assessed by gross and histologic examination, and edema was measured by accumulation of radiolabeled albumin in the limbs. The isolated group-specific polysaccharide induced extensive edema of the articular and periarticular tissue immediately after injection, and this resolved in 24 hours. The peptidoglycan moiety did not produce early edema, but induced an acute exudative reaction followed by a proliferative synovitis which resolved after 5 days. Reactions induced by covalently bound complexes of peptidoglycan and the group-specific polysaccharide (PG-APS) varied, depending on the size of the complex. Small fragments, derived from mutanolysin digestion, caused both an acute edematous reaction and transient arthritis. Larger fragments did not cause the immediate edematous reaction, but induced an acute arthritis that appeared within 24 hours and evolved into a chronic process. Episodes of recurrent inflammation, a distinctive feature of joint inflammation induced by systemic injection of PG-APS polymers, were not observed following intraarticular injection of any of the cell wall polymers. The relative susceptibility of different rat strains to arthritis induced by intraarticular injection paralleled the responses to systemic injection of PG-APS. These results demonstrate that variations in arthropathogenicity are due, in part, to inherent differences in the phlogistic activities of different cell wall polymers, and that the genetic control of susceptibility involves regulation of the inflammatory responses rather than the quantity of cell wall distributed to the joint.
TI  - Efficiency of various bacterial suspensions derived from cecal floras of conventional chickens in reducing the population level of Salmonella typhimurium in gnotobiotic mice and chicken intestines.
AB  - The antagonistic effect exerted towards Salmonella typhimurium by the flora issued from conventional chickens was studied in gnotobiotic animals. In germfree chickens and mice inoculated with S. typhimurium, the highest bacterial counts were observed in ceca, and were not significantly different in either host. The protection afforded by the inoculation of cecal flora issued from a conventional chicken was more effective when this flora was inoculated first into germfree chickens than when it was given only after inoculation with S. typhimurium. Administration of a cecal flora from a 15-day-old chick to gnotobiotic mice and chicken resulted in the inhibition of a further intestinal colonization by S. typhimurium in both hosts. Sixteen strains were isolated among the predominant populations of the fecal flora from chicken flora recipient mice. Association of 14 strains of strictly anaerobic bacteria with 2 strains of Escherichia coli and Streptococcus faecium only decreased the number of S. typhimurium in the ileum of gnotobiotic mice, but not in their cecum. Anaerobe cultures were obtained from 10(-6) and 10(-8) dilutions prepared from the fecal flora of gnotobiotic recipient mice. Antagonistic bacteria were present only in cultures from the 10(-6) dilution. Cecal concentrations of volatile fatty acids were shown not to be the sole factor implicated in the antagonistic effect against S. typhimurium.

AB  - HR 810 or cefpirome is a new amino thiazole cephalosporin whose specific characteristic is a cyclopentenopyridinium group in position 3 of the cephem nucleus. This structure is responsible for a broad spectrum of activity, covering Enterobacteriaceae, including cephalosporinase-producing Enterobacter spp. and Citrobacter spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and group D Streptococci.
TI  - Regulation of a cya-lac fusion by cyclic AMP in Salmonella typhimurium.
AB  - cya-lac and crp-lac operon fusions were isolated in Salmonella typhimurium by using the phage Mu d1(lac cts Apr). Both transduction and reversion analyses have indicated that lac expression is controlled by the appropriate promoter, e.g., either crpp or cyap. By using chromosomal mobilization techniques, we found that cya had a clockwise direction of transcription on the standard S. typhimurium map. The cya-lac fusions could be complemented by Escherichia coli F'133, which covers cya, with a resultant 17 to 38% decrease in cya expression. Cyclic AMP was found to be able to repress the expression of the cya-lac fusion ninefold when present at 25 mM. This repression was not seen in crp backgrounds, and hence is mediated by the cAMP receptor protein. Repression of cya was also found upon growth on carbon sources known to elicit high cyclic AMP levels.

TI  - Characterization of oral streptococci that activate the dietary glycoside rutin to a mutagen.
AB  - Oral streptococci are described that hydrolyze the dietary glycoside rutin (CAS:  153-18-4), resulting in mutagenic activity. Bacteria that hydrolyze rutin were isolated from the mouth of each of 10 healthy volunteers. The activity was inducible, and the product was mutagenic in the Salmonella mutagenicity assay. These bacteria were present in the greatest proportion on the dorsum of the tongue where they formed 1.5% of the total cultivable microflora. The appearance of the colonies, cell morphology, and biochemical characteristics were those of Streptococcus milleri. However, rutin hydrolysis did not occur with any of 30 isolates of this species from blood of patients with bacteremia, with any of 4 stock strains, or with any of 14 strains of streptococci from the other 4 major oral species. Therefore, activation of rutin to a mutagen is not a universal function of the normal oral flora, but it can be accomplished by some strains of S. milleri.
TI  - Neutrophil bactericidal dysfunction towards oxidant radical-sensitive microorganisms during experimental iron deficiency.
AB  - We developed a clear-cut nutritional iron deficiency anemia without concomittant  malnutrition in rats given a low iron diet, and we restored normal iron and hemoglobin levels in these same animals with iron dextran injections. The neutrophil function studies performed during and after a period of iron deficiency showed the following: Phagocytosis of Staphylococcus aureus 502A, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Salmonella typhimurium was not altered by iron deficiency or by the administration of iron; phagocytosis of Candida albicans was moderately abnormal during iron deficiency, and became normal with the restoration of iron sufficiency. Microbicidal activity towards Staphylococcus aureus 502A and Candida albicans, two catalase-positive microorganisms, was markedly decreased (to 50% of control values) and returned to normal when iron sufficiency was restored. Killing of a catalase-negative organism, Streptococcus pneumoniae was normal in iron-deficient rats. This pattern of differential bactericidal activities suggested an abnormality of the oxidant radical-generating machinery in neutrophils of iron-deficient animals. Indeed, iron deficiency caused a marked decrease of neutrophil nitroblue tetrazolium dye reduction, which disappeared after iron administration. Neutrophil myeloperoxidase activity was slightly decreased in iron deficient rats and returned to normal after iron administration. Microbicidal activity towards a gram-negative, catalase-positive organism, Salmonella typhimurium, was equal in iron deficient and iron sufficient animals. Our combined results suggest that a definite microbicidal defect is the consequence of nutritional iron deficiency, apart from any protein-calorie malnutrition. This defect affects the disposal in PMNs of two catalase-positive microorganisms (which require intracellular production of oxidant radicals for their destruction) but not of a catalase-negative bacterial species.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Bacteremia in hospitalized black South African children. A one-year study emphasizing nosocomial bacteremia and bacteremia in severely malnourished children.
AB  - During a one-year period, 315 of 5,397 children admitted to the general pediatric wards of a hospital had bacteremia. The commonest causative organisms were Streptococcus pneumoniae, Salmonella enteritidis, Hemophilus influenzae, and Escherichia coli. Most episodes of bacteremia were associated with gastroenteritis, pneumonia, or meningitis. Seventy-eight episodes occurred in children with severe protein-energy malnutrition, and 46 episodes were hospital acquired. The overall case fatality rate was 23.2%, being highest in children with severe malnutrition and in those with other underlying conditions. The high proportion of bacteremias due to S pneumoniae and S enteritidis possibly reflects infections occurring in a lower socioeconomic group living in a temperate climate in crowded conditions. The most appropriate antimicrobial therapy for children who have suspected bacteremia in association with gastroenteritis or severe malnutrition is a combination of ampicillin sodium and gentamicin sulfate.
TI  - [Immunostimulation in an animal model using intestinal bacteria preparations].
AB  - The treatment of mice with an injection preparation consisting of killed R-tribes of non-pathogenous E. coli caused an increase in microbicidic activities in the animal's blood and effects a significant protection against consecutive infections with Salmonella typhimurium. The enhancement of the animal' resistance capacity appears to be non-specific, and connected with the activity of leucocytes. Oral application of preparations of intestinal bacteria led to increased resistance against consecutive infections with Salmonella typhimurium and Haemophilus influenzae. Three different oral vaccines have been used: Streptococcus faecalis and E. coli, a viable vaccine of non-pathogenous Streptococcus faecalis and a viable vaccine of E. coli. The enhancement of the resistance can be attributed to an induction of the chemotactic efficiency of the animal neutrophilic cells. The chemotactic response of these cells seems to be enhanced. The mode of action of both the other oral vaccines remains obscure.
TI  - Medical treatment of multiple streptococcal liver abscesses.
AB  - We describe four cases of multiple, cryptogenic, and streptococcal liver abscesses which were cured with antibiotic therapy. Two of the patients were referred for medical management as a last resort after open surgical drainage failed to eradicate the suppurative process. The other two patients were treated from the time of diagnosis with antimicrobial agents alone. Blood cultures or needle aspirates of the abscesses yielded a pure growth of streptococci in all instances. All isolates were susceptible to penicillin G. Cryptogenic streptococcal abscesses may represent a subset of multiple hepatic abscesses particularly amenable to successful medical therapy consisting of a minimum of 6 weeks parenteral antibiotic therapy followed by a period of oral antibiotics until clinical, biochemical, and radiological resolution of the abscesses has occurred.
TI  - Mutagenicity and cytotoxicity of the carcinogen-mutagen aflatoxin B1 in Streptococcus pneumoniae (Pneumococcus) and Salmonella typhimurium: dependence on DNA repair functions.
AB  - Strains R6, R6x and R6uvr-1 of Streptococcus pneumoniae (Pneumococcus) are sensitive to the cytotoxic effects of the mutagen/carcinogen aflatoxin B1 (AFB1). R6uvr-1 is more prone to the cytotoxic effects of AFB1 than the repair-proficient parental strain, R6. The same differential susceptibility of strains R6, R6x and R6uvr-1 was observed when UV light replaced metabolically activated AFB1. All pneumococcal strains were immutable by AFB1. AFB1 mutagenesis in Salmonella typhimurium strains was dependent on a functional RecA gene product. The enhancing effects of delta uvrB and plasmid pKM101 were found to be additive. Data presented are consistent with the following: (i) AFB1 toxic effects are due mainly to DNA binding of AFB1; (ii) AFB1 mutagenesis is dependent on error-prone DNA repair; (iii) Pneumococcus lacks an active error-prone (SOS) DNA-repair system.

TI  - Mothers of infants with neonatal group B streptococcal septicemia are poor responders to bacterial carbohydrate antigens.
AB  - Serum antibodies against various carbohydrate antigens were studied in 16 mothers of infants with serious infections caused by group B streptococci (GBS) (the study group), and compared with a control group of 29 urogenital carriers of GBS who gave birth to neonatally healthy infants. Using a radioimmunoassay for the determination of antibodies to GBS types Ia, Ib, II and III, it was found that the study group had significantly lower levels of IgG antibodies to each of the 4 GBS types than the control group. The IgG levels against Salmonella BO and DO, Yersinia enterocolitica 03, Francisella tularense and Streptococcus pneumonia types 3, 6, 9, 19 and 23 purified carbohydrate antigens were determined using an ELISA technique. Significantly more individuals in the study group than in the control group had low levels of IgG antibodies against 8 of 9 carbohydrate antigens. No difference was found in IgM levels against 3 of 4 antigens studied, while the study group showed significantly more IgM antibodies against Salmonella DO than the controls. These results indicate that mothers of GBS-infected infants might be poor IgG antibody responders to bacterial carbohydrate antigens in general.
TI  - Fluorescent bacterial rosetting of lymphocyte subpopulations. I. Methodology.
AB  - Fluorochrome-labelled bacteria were tested for their rosette-forming properties with human lymphocytes in suspension. Acridine orange stained human buffy coat cells or isolated mononuclear cells are rosetted with tetramethyl-rhodamine-isothiocyanate (TRITC)-labelled bacterial strains alone (mono-bacterial rosetting test) or simultaneously with a TRITC-labelled strain and a mutant or taxonomically different strain, labelled with fluorescein-isothiocyanate (double bacterial rosetting test [D-BRT]). Suspensions are centrifuged, washed, finally counterstained with ethidium bromide and examined by fluorescence microscopy. The bacterial binding properties of B cells may be studied by using anti-Ig pretreated mononuclear cells and TRITC bacteria (anti-Ig/BRT). In this study the methodology for bacterial staining, mono-, double- and anti-Ig/BRT is given. Estimation of rosette-forming cells is very accurate, easy and quick due to the bright fluorescence of the bacterial 'beads'. Furthermore, broad applicability of the bacterial rosetting phenomenon to study lymphocyte heterogeneity is gained with the fluorescent assay system.
TI  - Antibacterial properties of alafosfalin combined with cephalexin.
AB  - The phosphonopeptide alafosfalin (L-alanyl-L-1-aminoethylphosphonic acid) exhibited synergy in vitro and in animal studies against a range of bacterial genera when combined with cephalexin. Alafosfalin also showed synergy with mecillinam and, to a much lesser extent, with ampicillin. Synergy with cephalexin was more pronounced when the bacteria were relatively insensitive to the beta-lactam component. The action of this combination involved both an inhibitory and a bacteriolytic mechanism which was abolished by concurrent treatment with the aminopeptidase inhibitor, bestatin. Regrowth of subpopulation resistant to either component was markedly reduced by the combination. The potential of alafosfalin combined with cephalexin for use in therapy is discussed.
TI  - Mode of antibiotic action of 4-hydroxy-3-nitrosobenzaldehyde from Streptomyces viridans.
AB  - The free ligand, deferroviridomycin A, and its iron(II) complex, viridomycin A, were detected in culture supernatant fluids of Streptomyces viridans 1671 and were structurally characterized as 4-hydroxy-3-nitrosobenzaldehyde and tris(4-hydroxy-3-nitrosobenzaldehydato-N3,O4)ferrate(II), respectively. We investigated the antibiotic activity of the above compounds and of the chemically synthesized bis copper(II), tris cobalt(III), and tris nickel(II) complexes against Escherichia coli NIHJ, Salmonella typhimurium LT-2Z, Staphylococcus aureus 209P, Streptococcus faecium 10541, and Bacillus cereus, T. The free ligand and its kinetically labile copper(II) and nickel(II) complexes displayed activity against all of the above organisms, whereas the kinetically inert iron(II) and cobalt(III) complexes displayed activity only against S. aureus and B. cereus. The antibiotic activity of the substitutionally labile metal complexes was attributed to dissociation of the free ligand. The mode of antibiotic action of the free ligand against E. coli appears to be interference with the structural and functional integrity of the cell membrane.
TI  - A genetic locus responsible for salmonella susceptibility in BSVS mice is not responsible for the limited T-dependent immune responsiveness of BSVS mice.
AB  - BSVS mice are known to be highly susceptible to salmonella infection. We have shown that the bulk of the difference in susceptibility between BSVS and salmonella-resistant A/J mice is the result of a genetic difference at a single locus not closely linked to H-2, Igh-C, or Hbb, and not X-linked. We have backcrossed the A/J allele at this locus into BSVS mice for 8 successive generations and have demonstrated that the salmonella resistance afforded by this allele is not the result of a restoration of the generalized poor T-dependent responsiveness of BSVS mice. The salmonella resistance locus we have examined with these 2 strains is probably the same as the Ity locus described by others.
TI  - Heparin inhibits phagocytosis by polymorphonuclear leukocytes.
AB  - Phagocytosis of unopsonized Salmonella typhimurium 395, MR-10, opsonized Salmonella typhimurium 395 MS, and Staphylococcus epidermidis by rabbit polymorphonuclear leukocytes was inhibited by heparin at concentrations as low as 0.5 U/ml. Inhibition was dose dependent and nearly complete at 20 U/ml. Provided that heparin concentrations did not exceed 100 U/ml, inhibition could be largely reversed by washing. Heparin also reversibly inhibited the adherence of polymorphonuclear leukocytes to glass. In contrast, hexose monophosphate shunt activity of polymorphonuclear leukocytes stimulated by noningested S. typhimurium MR-10 or Streptococcus pyogenes B14 was not inhibited by heparin at concentrations as high as 100 U/ml.
TI  - Bacterial food-poisoning versus coliforms-faecal streptococci and gamma radiation survival/dose.
AB  - All the species tested were sensitive to gamma radiation treatment, even at a dose as low as 0.001 Mrad. The spore-former Bacillus cereus (PCJ 213) proved to be more resistant than the rest of the tested species, while the Gram-negative organisms were more susceptible to irradiation treatment. The tolerance among those organisms is depicted by the descending order: Proteus vulgaris, irregular VI, Escherichia coli I, E. coli III, and Salmonella typhi-murium. Yet all the tested faecal streptococci species, with the exception of Streptococcus bovis, may be regarded as holding an intermediate position between the more resistant B. cereus (PCJ 213) and the more sensitive Gram-negative organisms.
TI  - Microorganisms isolated from blood and cerebrospinal fluid in a general hospital. Clinical implications.
AB  - This study is a review of 1,040 significant positive blood cultures from 415 patients, and 44 positive cerebrospinal fluid cultures from 44 patients treated at the Meir General Hospital during the period 1976-78. The most frequent isolates from blood cultures were Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae. The most frequent isolates from cerebrospinal fluid cultures were Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria meningitidis, which were present in similar proportions. E. coli was predominant in the division of medicine, Staph. aureus in the division of pediatrics and Klebsiella in the division of surgery. Fifty percent of the E. coli isolates were sensitive to ampicillin and carbenicillin; about 80%, to cephalothin and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim; and 100%, to gentamicin. Only 7% of the Klebsiella isolates were sensitive to apicillin; 72% were sensitive to cephalothin and 87%, to gentamicin. Only 18% of Staph. aureus isolates were sensitive to penicillin, but about 95% were sensitive to methicillin or cephalothin. Two of 10 salmonellae isolates and 13% of H. influenzae were resistant to ampicillin.
TI  - Effects of infection and endotoxin on rat hepatic RNA production and distribution.
AB  - Rat liver was quantitatively subfractionated into free ribosomal, bound ribosomal, nuclear, and soluble fractions to determine the effects of infection and endotoxin treatment on hepatic RNA production and distribution. A 4-h pulse label of [14C]orotic acid was used to monitor newly transcribed RNA; distribution was determined by measuring RNA content at various times after infection or endotoxin treatment. A significant increase in the rate of RNA synthesis was seen by 12 h and continued through 20 h in response to Streptococcus pneumoniae infection. During the peak hours of the RNA response, redistribution of RNA into the bound ribosomal fraction takes place at the expense of the free ribosomes. However, in Salmonella typhimurium and its endotoxin, more involvement of the free ribosoma fraction during the early stages of the infection was apparent. These data suggest that the hepatic RNA response takes place in two stages, an early "endotoxin" response, resulting in redistribution of cytoplasmic RNA into free ribosomes, and a later "infection" response, involving the mobilization of the bound ribosomes.

TI  - Treatment failures secondary to in vivo development of drug resistance by microorganisms.
AB  - In two patients development of resistance to antibiotics by initially sensitive infecting organisms was associated with relapse or persistence of active infection. The first patient developed Staphylococcus epidermidis resistant to chloramphenicol during therapy with this agent for an infection that followed a cerebrospinal fluid shunt, and the second patient developed bacteremia due to ampicillin-resistant Salmonella during therapy with ampicillin. Treatment failure resulting from in vivo development of resistance to antimicrobial agents has been described for most of the major classes of antiinfective drugs and for numerous microorganisms. Although in many of these instances reinfection with a resistant organism cannot be excluded, there are many examples of apparent mutation or initial infection with both sensitive and resistant bacterial populations that is followed by selective multiplication of the resistant population or acquisition of resistance by an initially sensitive infecting organism. This phenomenon can be a cause of treatment failure and has appeared in patients in whom, by available tests, drug levels were found adequate. Isolation days after the institution of antimicrobial therapy of what appears to be the same organism as was initially recovered should prompt repeated sensitivity tests, at least to the agents being administered, if the patient's clinical course has not been one of satisfactory improvement.
TI  - [Inactivation of viruses and bacteria in sewage sludge by gamma radiation (author's transl)].
AB  - The kinetics of inactivation and the resistance to gamma radiation of microorganisms usually to be found in raw sludge were examined with five viruses, three bacteria and a fungus serving as prototypes in comparative studies. All these infectious agents could reliably be inactivated by gamma rays in raw sewage sludge but they were clearly more resistant to gamma rays compared to irradiation in a liquid suspension. The reduction of the virus content required a much higher radiation dose compared to bacteria and the fungus used, excluding Streptococcus faecalis which was exceptionally resistant. Considering the content of pathogenic viruses and other agents in raw sewage sludge, the required radiation dose necessary to comply with average to strict demands for the hygienisation of sewage sludge is discussed. The radiation dose of 500 to 1,000 krad seems therefore to be sufficient.
TI  - Infections in sickle cell anemia: pathogenesis and control.
AB  - Splenic dysfunction accounts for the greatest deficit in immune function in children with homozygous SCD. This dysfunction, coupled with the natural immunologic immaturity of all young children subjects the young child with SCD to an immense risk of severe pyogenic infections. To data, experience would suggest that pneumococcal vaccines may provide only modest protection in the child with SCD less than 5 years of age. Antipneumococcal antibody responses are poor in children less than two years of age. All reported failures of pneumococcal vaccine among children with SCD have occurred in children less than three years of age and offending pneumococci have been of groups 6 and 23. Prophylactic antibiotic regimens have yet to be submitted to rigid scientific investigation and their utility in eliminating the risk of pneumococcal sepsis in asplenic hosts is unknown.

TI  - Influence of antilymphocyte and antipolymorphonuclear sera on the pyrogenic effect of scarlet fever toxin.
AB  - The role played by lymphocytes in the pyretic response to scarlet fever toxin (ET) was studied in vivo using antilymphocyte serum (ALS). Two i.v. injections of ALS inhibited the pyretic response to a subsequent ET injection in rabbits. The course of endotoxin fever remained uninfluenced by ALS. Antipolymorphonuclear serum had no effect on the pyretic response to either of the toxins. Pretreatment with ALS also inhibited the skin reaction after i.d. injection of ET. These findings are further evidence a mediating role of lymphocytes in the biological effects of ET, among other things in the release of endogenous pyrogen.
TI  - Effect of scarlet fever toxin on the phagocytic activity of the reticuloendothelial system.
AB  - In normal rabbits and mice, one i.v. injection of scarlet fever toxin (ET) (30 000 STD per kg of rabbit weight or 20-g mouse) elicited a similar biphasic change in carbon clearance rate - early depression followed by a stimulating phase - as has been described for Gram-negative endotoxins. Prolonged depression without a subsequent stimulation phase was obtained in mice by raising the ET dose. The reasons of the discrepancy between these findings and those of Hanna and Watson (1965b) are discussed. Pyrogenic tolerance to ET is not accompanied by accelerated carbon clearance and is not impaired by RES blockade. A possible mechanism of ET tolerance is suggested.
TI  - Protection of mice against Babesia microti with cord factor, COAM, zymosan, glucan, Salmonella and Listeria.
AB  - Cord factor (trehalose 6-6' dimycolate). COAM (chlorite-oxidized oxyamylose), zymosan, glucan, Salmonella enteritidis 11RX and Listeria monocytogenes were found to protect mice against subsequent infection with Babesia microti, an intra-erythrocytic protozoan parasite. This protection was not observed after injection of Staphylococcus epidermidis, a viridans group Streptococcus, thioglycollate, or colloidal carbon. All the agents which protect against B. microti have also been reported to induce non-specific protection against experimental tumours. The parasites appear to die inside circulating red cells. This implies that these can exert non-specific protection against this parasite through the mediation of a soluble factor.
TI  - A simplified procedure for measuring the class of anti-bacterial antibodies by mixed reverse passive antiglobulin haemagglutination (MRPAH).
AB  - A modified procedure is described for performing the MRPAH (mixed reverse passive antiglobulin haemagglutination) reaction as a simple micro-method to measure the classes of bacterial antibodies. This 'bacterial dilution procedure' gave results closely correlated with those obtained by the 'serum (sample) dilution procedure' previously reported and with great economy of materials, labour and time. The method was used to investigate human serum antibodies to Br. abortus and S. enteritidis and serum and secretory antibodies to Strep. mutans. The good reproducibility of the MRPAH reaction was demonstrated by re-examining brucellosis sera tested one year previously. MRPAH was sufficiently sensitive to demonstrate the small amounts of IgG and IgM antibodies to Strep. mutans in human colostrum and early milk. A rise of antibody levels in the different immunoglobulin classes G, A and M was readily demonstrated in sera from individuals with salmonellosis.
TI  - Early splenomegaly in homozygous sickle-cell disease: An indicator of susceptibility to infection.
AB  - 135 children with homozygous sickle-cell (SS) disease diagnosed at birth have been followed for 1--5 years. Severe bacterial infections were confined to those in whom the spleen was first palpable at or before 1 year of age and were commonest in those in whom the spleen was first palpable at or before age 6 months. Regular follow-up of children with SS disease diagnosed at birth will identify children particularly at risk of severe infections.

TI  - Immunogenicity of gonococcal Gc2 polysaccharide: comparative studies with pneumococcal type III polysaccharide and Salmonella typhosa Vi antigen.
AB  - A plaque assay technique was used to assess the immunogenicity of a gonococcal cell wall polysaccharide (Gc2 antigen) in BALB/c mice. The Gc2 antigen was shown to be immunogenic, and the kinetics of the response differed from that of a pneumococcal polysaccharide (SSS-III) and a polysaccharide antigen of Salmonella typhosa (Vi antigen). In addition, using antithymocyte sera, the T-lymphocyte dependency of these antigens was investigated. The immune response to the Gc2 antigen was demonstrated to be dependent on a population of helper T cells, whereas the response to SSS-III appears to be regulated by suppressor T cells. There appears to be marked differences in the immune response of mice to different bacterial polysaccharides.
TI  - Serum opsonic deficiency produced by Streptococcus pneumoniae and by capsular polysaccharide antigens.
AB  - The opsonic requirements for phagocytosis of S. pneumoniae types 6, 7, 18, and 23 were determined in normal and C2 deficient serum, and in normal serum chelated with magnesium ethyleneglycoltetraacetic acid. All four strains were effectively opsonized via the alternative complement pathway, a finding suggesting that the capsular polysaccharides of these strains activated complement via the alternative pathway. Since bacteremic pneumococcal disease is often associated with circulating capsular polysaccharide, it was considered that this cellular component may activate complement in vivo and impair host defenses by producing an opsonic defect for pneumococci. To examine this hypothesis, serum was incubated with suspensions of whole S. pneumoniae types 6, 7, 18, or 23 or with purified capsular polysaccharide from each of these types, and residual complement activity and opsonic capacity were measured. Hemolytic C 3--9 complement activity and opsonic capacity for 3H-thymidine labeled Salmonella typhimurium, a species effectively opsonized via the alternative pathway, were reduced in serum following incubation. Polysaccharide concentrations as low as 1 microgram/ml inhibited serum opsonic capacity for salmonella. Whole pneumococci and pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide also inhibited the opsonic activity of human C2 deficient serum for salmonella, further evidence for activation of complement via the alternative pathway. Pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide markedly inhibited the opsonic capacity of normal serum for the homologous pneumoccal type. Thus, amounts of pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide, similar to those found in the serum of patients with pneumococcal disease, bring about decomplementation of serum via activation of the alternative pathway and inhibit pneumococcal opsonization.
TI  - Protective ability of Salmonella ribosomal protein and RNA in inbred mice.
AB  - Ribosomal vaccines prepared from Salmonella typhimurium were effective immunogens in A/J, C3H/HeDub, and C3H/HeJ mice. Purified ribosomal components were also tested as immunogens in the inbred mice. Protein isolated from a Salmonella ribosomal fraction could protect all three mouse strains. Although purified RNA was shown to be protective for A/J and C3H/HeDub mice, it was not protective for C3H/HeJ mice. Protective immunity could be induced in A/J and C3H/HeDub mice by various immunostimulants. Immunity in C3H/HeJ mice, however, could only be induced by Salmonella ribosomes or protein isolated from the Salmonella ribosomal fraction.
TI  - Effects of surface-active agents on neutrophil receptors.
AB  - An easily performed assay to identify the C3b and Fc receptors on human neutrophils was developed. Salmonella typhimurium were treated with fluorescein and then incubated in nonimmune fresh human serum, which led to C3b fixation via activation of the alternative pathway. Similarly, type II pneumococci were treated with fluorescein and opsonized with type-specific rabbit antiserum. Neutrophils bearing C3b and Fc receptors formed rosettes with the respective bacteria, which were easily readable because of their bright fluorescence. Incubation of neutrophils at 37 degrees C with C3-coated bacteria generated 54 +/ 4% C3b rosettes, whereas neutrophils incubated with immunoglobulin G-coated bacteria yielded 75 +/ 7% rosettes. Incubation at 4 degrees C inhibited the formation of C3b rosettes but not Fc rosettes. Heat inactivation of the fresh human serum at 56 degrees C for 30 min completely inhibited the formation of the C3b rosettes, and addition of heat-aggregated immunoglobulin G to the polymorphonuclear leukocyte blocked the ability of the polymorphonuclear leukocyte to bind immunoglobulin G-coated bacteria. Addition of 1.0 mM N-ethylmaleimide, 0.1 mg of trypsin per ml, 10 mM H2O2, O2- generated by xanthine-xanthine oxidase, and 8 times 10(-4) M hydrocortisone inhibited the C3b receptor, but did not inhibit the Fc receptor. In neutrophils, the selective effect of the various inhibitors suggests that the Fc and C3b receptors are distinct entities.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of cefamandole in vitro.
AB  - Cefamandole, a new cephalosporin derivative, was found to have a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity against a cross-section of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria isolated clinically. Gram-positive cocci, except for Streptococcus faecalis, were extremely susceptible to cefamandole; penicillin G-resistant Staphylococcus aureus also was highly susceptible. Minimal bactericidal concentrations for gram-positive cocci approximated the minimal inhibitory concentrations. Strains of Haemophilus influenzae were very susceptible to the drug. Most strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, and Proteus species were inhibited by low concentrations of cefamandole, Salmonella typhi, including ampicillin- and chloramphenicol-resistant strains, was inhibited by low concentrations of cefamandole. Susceptible bacteria became increasingly resistant as the inoculum size was increased. Strains of Pseudomonas were resistant to cefamandole.
TI  - The hygienic quality of vegetables grown in or imported into the Netherlands: a tentative survey.
AB  - Samples of 61 home grown and 199 imported vegetables of different varieties were  examined for Escherichia coli, faecal streptococci and, when E. coli was present, for salmonellas. Eleven per cent of samples contained greater than 10(4) E. coli per 100 g, and 14% greater than 10(6) faecal streptococci per 100 g. Salmonellas were isolated from 23 out of 103 samples examined. Salmonellas were isolated from 8% of 76 samples with E. coli less than 10(4)/100 g, but from 63% of 27 samples with E. coli exceeding 10(4)/100 g; from 6% of 65 samples containing less than 10(6) faecal streptococci/100 g but from 51% of 37 samples containing more than 10(6)/100 g. S. typhi was isolated from one sample of vegetables imported from the tropics. To our knowledge this is the first isolation of S. typhi from food in the Netherlands. Products from tropical countries were found to present the highest level of contamination. The hygienic quality of Dutch products is sometimes inferior to that of similar imported products, although the different seasons of sampling may have influenced the result. For the prevention of risk to the consumer of vegetables, good kitchen hygiene would appear to be the most important factor.

TI  - [Morphologic characteristics of the large bodies in cultures of the L-forms of bacteria according to scanning electron microscope studies].
AB  - Large bodies appear at the time of protoplast and spheroplast formation and are revealed at all the L-transformation stages and at the initial stage of reversion. They can be represented both by a single giant cell and by a conglomerate of different cells connected with one another. They are not only spheroid, but can be of the most varied shape, and structurally they are connected with other L-colony elements: filamentous structures, spheroid cells, elementary bodies and the so-called acellular material. At the early L-transformation stage the large bodies probably appear as a result of coalescence of lysed cells and represent polygenome formations. Elementary bodies and spheroid cells form within the large bodies and on their surface at the late stage of L-transformation. In case of reversion bacterial cells form from them.
TI  - Bacteriology of the human biliary tract and the duodenum.
AB  - Using the modern anaerobic transport media and meticulous culture techniques, 74  patients undergoing biliary tract surgery were studied. The biliary system was found to be sterile in 58 patients (78%). Fifteen patients had 35 isolates of aerobic and facultative bacteria. The most common ones were Klebsiella, Enterococcus, and Escherichia coli. The only anaerobe isolated was Clostridium perfringens. Eight of 17 patients (47%) with acute cholecystitis and five of 49 patients (10%) with chronic cholecystitis, harbored bacteria in the biliary system. This study suggests that anaerobes are rare in the human biliary system; therefore, if antibiotic therapy is considered, aerobic coverage should suffice.

AB  - Compounds that compete with folic acid (folic acid antagonists [FAAs]) become limited in their usefulness in the treatment of leukemia, malaria, and bacterial infections by the rapid development of resistance. Assays of the plasma levels of certain of these FAAs led to the observation, in about 25% of the determinations, that a higher density of growth of Streptococcus faecium var. durans (ATCC 8043) was obtained at an FAA concentration just below the completely inhibitory level than at one-half this concentration. This and other considerations suggested that FAAs may act not only as selective agents for resistant organisms but also as mutagens. Seven FAAs including amethopterin, pyrimethamine, trimethoprim, chlorguanide triazine, an experimental quinazoline, WR-158,122, and two experimental triazines, WR-99,210 and WR-38,839, were tested for mutagenicity in the Salmonella reversion assay developed by Ames et al. (1975). All were found to be negative for strains TA1535, TA1537, TA1538, TA98, and TA100, both with and without microsomal activation. These compounds were then tested as mutagens for three traits in the folic acid-requiring S. faecium. FAAs were shown to cause mutations to folic acid independence, rifampin resistance, and FAA resistance. It is postulated that the FAAs induce mutations by causing thymine deprivation in the folic acid-requiring host.
TI  - Salmonella in surface waters of central New York state.
AB  - Six tributary streams and southern Cayuga Lake in central New York state were sampled for the presence of Salmonella on swabs immersed for 4 days. Of a total of 322 swabs, 39% yielded salmonellae. Swabs were cultured in tetrathionate enrichment at 41.5 degrees C. Isolations were made from brilliant green agar. Salmonellae were isolated from many sites on the streams and from some lake sites. Twenty-five serotypes (11 somatic antigen groups) and a distinct biotype of S. typhimurium (H2S negative) were found. Most frequent isolates, in order of decreasing occurrence, were S. typhimurium, S. thompson, S. oranienburg, and S. enteritidis. Several uncommon isolates also appeared. When tested for mouse infectivity, the isolates generally showed little or no virulence. The incidence of clinical salmonellosis among humans was low in the area and the variety of serotypes had not been noted among cattle. The presence of Salmonella in waters ranging in classification from potable to agricultural and industrial indicated the existence of a low level and undefined reservoirs of the bacteria in the region.

TI  - Immune function in ankylosing spondylitis: apparent relationship between streptococcal responses and HLA B27.
AB  - Immune function has been evaluated in 54 patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and 26 controls. Cell-mediated immunity was assessed by skin testing with ubiquitous antigens, and humoral immunity by antibody responses to tetanus toxoid and Salmonella typhi vaccinations, and resting titres of anti-Streptolysin O, anti-E Coli, and isohemagglutinins. The AS patients had reduced delayed hypersensitivity responses to Candida, augmented responses to Streptococcal antigen and relatively low ASO titres. There was no generalized depression of humoral immunity, as indicated by the normal tetanus and Salmonella O responses and hyper-response to Salmonella H antigen. The E. Coli and isohemagglutinin titres were normal. These results indicate that patients with AS present a complex immunological profile, including exaggerated responses to some antigens and impaired responses to others. In view of the very high incidence of HLA-B27 in AS, it is possible that these findings are related to the effects of HLA associated immune response genes.
TI  - [Bacterial recombination].
AB  - The most perspective trends in studying the mechanisms of genetic exchanges in bacteria are discussed. They are the following. 1. Comparison of the recombination stages in various biological phenomena such as transformation, transduction (generalized), conjugation (common and single-stranded) and transfection. 2. Characterization of genetic determinants and basic enzymes of the recombination process in Rec-systems of different bacteria. 3. Determination of some peculiar features of the intragenic recombination and finding a possible approach to their research. 4. Analysis of some plastic properties of the DNA structure and their application to the modern ideas in the formulation of a molecular mechanism of genetic recombination.
TI  - [Antibiotic sensitivity tests (author's transl)].
AB  - Sensitivity to antibacterial agents may be studied using quantitative dilution tests and qualitative diffusion tests. There is a strongly felt need for standardized testing methods. Currently, the so-called Bauer-Kirby method appears to be the most suitable test, also for use in veterinary medicine. When this technique is adopted, results are classifid as "sensitive", "resistant" and "showing diminished sensitivity". Interpretations are based on pharmacological, bacteriological and clinical criteria. In some situations, in vitro results have not been sufficiently tested in the field. This would appear to be particularly so in local conditions and treatment.
TI  - Automatic quantitative radiometric assay of bacterial metabolism.
AB  - In a two-compartment scintillation vial, suspensions of bacteria were cultured with 1 muCi of [U-14C] glucose and the released 14C02 was measured continuously, cumulatively, and automatically in a liquid-scintillation counter modified to maintain sample temperature at 37 degrees C. We could follow the metabolism of bacterial populations through their early phase of exponential growth with good precision. The data were obtained conveniently, with use of conventional reagents, glassware, and counting equipment. From analysis of the exponential portion of the curves for cumulative activity vs. time, we could measure cell replication rate precisely in units of time. The resulting values were demonstrably independent of some common experimental variables, including the number of bacteria in the inoculum and counting system sensitivity. Sensitivity of the bacteria to antibiotics was measured to within a few percent by noting the relative prolongation of replication time in the presence of those inhibitors. The digital data from the scintillation counter are susceptible to on- or off-line computer analysis, thus providing the prospect for a totally-automated analytical system. The method shows promise for the mechanized quantitative analysis of bacterial growth, and its inhibition.
TI  - A regional quality control program in microbiology. II. Advantages of simulated clinical specimens.
AB  - A regional quality control program was established using simulated clinical specimens introduced into the routine workload of participating laboratories in such a way that they were not detected as quality control specimens. Comparison of performance between these specimens and lyophilized cultures showed that additional information was obtainable with the former. In particular, it was observed that common pathogens such as Escherichia coli are poorly identified in clinical material. The examination of urines was inferior to examination of other types of specimens. The implications of these findings for the practice of diagnostic bacteriology are discussed.
TI  - The effect of bacterial infections on ketone concentrations in rat liver and blood and on free fatty acid concentrations in rat blood.
AB  - The concentrations of cytoplasmic lactate and pyruvate and the NAD+/NADH ratio and the concentrations of mitochondrial acetoacetate, beta-hydroxybutyrate, and the NAD+/NADH ratio were determined in normal, fed, and fasted rats, and in rats infected with Streptococcus pneumoniae, Francisella tularensis, and Salmonella typhimurium. The various infections were found to have little or no effect on the cytoplasmic parameters. In normal rats, fasting caused a marked increase in blood and hepatic ketone concentration and in serum free fatty acid content. Fasted infected rats, however, did not show the increase in ketone bodies or serum free fatty acids normally associated with fasting alone. The mitochondrial NAD+/NADH ratio increased as the infections progressed, reversing the normal trend. The introduction of an infection during the fasting state when ketone bodies and serum free fatty acids were elevated caused a marked depression in their concentration. These data have led to a postulation of decreased lipolysis in the infected host to account for the lowered hepatic and blood ketone bodies and the decreased level of serum free fatty acids.
TI  - Stimulation of lymphocyte proliferation by killed mycobacteria and other bacterial species.
AB  - Killed mycobacteria and some mycobacterial fractions induced spleen cells from normal C3H mice to incorporate tritiated thymidine to a relatively high degree. Thymocytes under the same conditions were not activated. However, incorporation of thymidine was significantly increased when mixtures of thymus and spleen cells were cultured in the presence of the inducers. A similar activation of spleen cells was displayed in the presence of gram-positive and gram-negative non-mycobacterial species.
TI  - Survival of bacteria in seawater using a diffusion chamber apparatus in situ.
AB  - A microbiological survival chamber for in situ environmental studies involving microorganisms of public health significance was developed. The autoclavable chamber was provided with a supportive base for proper flow orientation and a battery-powered stirring mechanism for continuous internal agitation. The performance of the chamber and its ancillary units was evaluated in estuarine waters by diffusion studies and survival tests with eight species of bacteria isolated from environmental sources. Polycarbonate filter membranes were found superior to cellulosic filter membranes. Continuous mixing enhanced diffusion and ensured uniform cell suspension. Salmonella enteritidis and Klebsiella pneumoniae exhibited somewhat greater viability than Escherichia coli under similar conditions. Of three indicator organisms tested, Streptococcus faecalis was the most persistent. In general, the data obtained indicate the usefulness of the chamber in measurements of microbial survival in the natural marine environment.
TI  - Effect of capsular polysaccharide of Klebsiella pneumoniae on host resistance to  bacterial infections. I. Induction of increased susceptibility to infections in mice.
AB  - When Klebsiella pneumoniae capsular polysaccharide (CPS-K) from type 1, Kasuya strain, was injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) immediately before i.p. bacterial challenge, the survival time of mice infected with Salmonella enteritidis NUB 1 (virulent strain) was shortened and the mortality rate for mice infected with S. enteritidis NUB 31 (avirulent strain) was enhanced. The promotion of infection with S. enteritidis NUB 1 by CPS-K depended upon its dose, the effect of CPS-K being demonstrable up to as little as 0.2 mug per mouse. In the case of S. enteritidis NUB 31, the effect of CPS-K was detectable only when more than 20 mug per mouse was injected. As a result of enumeration of bacterial populations in the peritoneal washing, blood, liver and spleen, it was revealed that CPS-K promoted in vivo growth of S. enteritidis NUB 1 and NUB 31. In addition, CPS-K enhanced the mortality rate in mice infected with Streptococcus pyogenes or Streptococcus pneumoniae. The peak CPS-K effect on infection with S. enteritidis NUB 1 was seen when given immediately before bacterial challenge. The active substance responsible for the infection-promoting effect of CPS-K was neutral CPS-K, which is distinct from the O antigen and from acidic CPS-K (the type-specific capsular antigen). Preparations of neutral CPS-K isolated from the other three strains of K. pneumoniae exhibited a marked infection-promoting effect comparable with that of preparations from the Kasuya strain. Neutral CPS-K, with identical antigenicity to that from the Kasuya strain, has already been found to exert a strong adjuvant effect on antibody responses to various antigens in mice. No parallelism exists between infection-promoting activity and adjuvant activity of neutral CPS-K.
TI  - Defective lipid disposal mechanisms during bacterial infection in rhesus monkeys.
AB  - Mechanisms producing hypertriglyceridemia during bacterial sepsis have not been well defined. In this study lipid disposal mechanisms were assessed in 76 infected and 19 control male rhesus monkeys by the ability to dispose of triglycerides after: (1) oral lipid loading; (2) intravenous lipid loading; and (3) by lipolytic enzyme activity tests as measured by postheparin lipolytic activity (PHLA). Studies were performed both before and 48 hr after intravenous inoculation with either Salmonella typhimurium or Diplococcus pneumoniae when illness was uniformly severe and fasting serum triglyceride elevations were increased maximally. S. typhimurium-infected monkeys demonstrated significant fasting hypertriglyceridemia (p is less than 0.001), reduced clearance of orally and intravenously administered lipid and markedly reduced PHLA. During this gram-negative sepsis, mild lethargy, slight diarrhea, and a 2% mortality were observed. During D. pneumoniae sepsis, average fasting triglyceride concentrations were slightly, but not significantly elevated. While oral lipid clearance was impaired, intravenous lipid clearance was unimpaired, and PHLA was slightly reduced. Marked lethargy, agitation, and a 20% mortality were present during this gram-positive infection. Results of this study support the concept that an impairment of lipid disposal mechanisms, particularly during gram-negative sepsis with S. typhimurium, may significantly contribute to the observed hypertriglyceridemia.
TI  - On the mode of action of 5-diazouracil on bacterial cell division.
AB  - Cell division by strains of Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium is inhibited by 5-diazouracil (5-DU). Division recovers in the presence of the inhibitor after a period which is temperature-dependent. Recovery is probably due to breakdown of 5-DU and the rate of this breakdown is apparently increased at alkaline pH. Growth with 5-DU caused only a slight reduction in the rate of murein synthesis and no alteration in the properties or composition of membranes of S. typhimurium. The agent caused chaining in Streptococcus fecalis and inhibition of the penicillin-induced lysis of S. typhimurium. These effects may have been due to direct inhibition of lysin activity but an indirect effect seems more likely. The most marked effect of 5-DU on S. typhimurium was to cause a transient inhibition of DNA synthesis. Since 5-DU did not stop uncoupled cell division (i.e. division occurring independently of DNA replication) and since lon- strains were more sensitive to 5-DU than lon+ strains, it was concluded that 5-DU acts on cell division via an inhibitory effect on DNA replication.

TI  - The effect of cooling and warming rates on the survival of a variety of bacteria.
AB  - Cooling and warming rates affect bacterial survival profoundly with all bacteria  tested (Azotobacter chroococcum, Klebsiella aerogenes, Salmonella typhimurium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus faecalis) behaving similarly. Most bacteria were sensitive to salt on freezing and thawing. Viabilities of population frozen and thawed in saline were always less (by at least 20%) than comparable ones frozen in water alone. Under these conditions, S. faecalis was resistant to the presence of sodium chloride; viabilities of populations frozen in the presence or absence of sodium chloride were always less than 5% different. The implications of these results in light of the organisms' shape, Gram stain, and respiration are discussed.

TI  - Non-specific immunity after local immunization.
AB  - The most important advantage of local immunization is the non-specific effect. The active protection test in mice shows an immunity against oral infection with virulent Salmonella typhimurium bacteria after oral immunization with heterologous inactivated enterobacteria. We observed the same non-specific protection in a viral model. After oral immunization with inactivated S. typhimurium bacteria, the mice are protected against oral infection with a virulent parapoliomyelitis virus. In the phagocytosis test after local immunization a non-specific effect is also demonstrated. The rate of phagocytosis of macrophages against streptococci rises significantly after oral immunization or after inhalation with heat-killed S. typhimurium bacteria.

All these cases are from the families living in suburban areas of the city under crowded circumstances, which show the importance of population density in the epidemiology of this particular disease.

TI  - Abnormal forms of bacteria produced by antibiotics.
AB  - Subinhibitory concentrations of antibiotics can produce in vitro aberrant forms of bacteria that are similar to those observed in specimens and cultures from patients being treated with antibacterial agents. Eight species of bacteria were grown on membranes placed on agar containing subinhibitory concentrations of nine antibiotics. The resulting organisms were examined by Gram stain and electron microscopy. Gram stains showed filamentous and granular forms of enterobacteria with bipolar staining, giant staphylococci, and rodlike pneumococci. Electron micrographs showed changes in the number and distribution of ribosomes in enterobacteria and septum abnormalities in cocci. Such abnormal forms can occasionally simulate the appearance of quite different species, and they may indicate the presence of a subinhibitory antibiotic concentration at the site of infection as a result of prior antibacterial therapy.

AB  - Survival times for enteric bacteria and fecal streptococci were investigated using filter-sterilized water from a northern Illinois river and temperatures of 0 degrees, 5 degrees, 10 degrees, and 20 degrees C. Survival of Salmonella typhimurium was essentially the same as Escherichia coli over normal seasonal temperatures. Fecal streptococci generally exhibited classic survival patterns.
TI  - Systematic difference in the methylation of ribosomal ribonucleic acid from gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - A survey of gram-positive and gram-negative organisms was performed to compare the distributionof N6-methylated adenine. It was found that (i) all the gram-positive strains tested, Staphylococcus aureus, Sarcina lutea, Bacillus stearothermophilus, Bacillus subtilis, and Bacillus megaterium, contain neither N6-monomethyl adenine (m6A) nor N6-dimethyladenine (m26A) in 23S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA). In the case of S. aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes, strains which are clinically resistant to erythromycin contain m26A. (ii) The gram-negative strains Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae all contain m6A but not m23A in 23S rRNA. These observations suggest the existence of at least one systematic structural difference between the ribosomes of the two classes of bacteria. Because of the demonstrated relationship between N6-dimethylation of adenine in 23S rRNA and clinical resistance to macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin B-type antibiotics in staphylococci and streptococci, the observed systematic differences found in rRNA methylation combined with greater cellular permeability may be related to the relatively greater efficacy of macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin B-type antibiotics in treating infections caused by gram-positive organisms.
TI  - Use of limulus assay to compare the biological activity of peptidoglycan and endotoxin.
AB  - The gelation of a lysate prepared from the amebocytes of Limulus polyphemus, the  horseshoe crab, has been used to detect endotoxin-like material in clinical studies and in "in vitro" experiments. The investigation of blood samples from 54 hospitalized patients suspected of having endotoxemia, revealed a positive limulus test in 14. Infections due to gram-positive organisms were not associated with positive assays. These results were in agreement with the observation that living gram-positive microorganisms - in contrast to gram-negative bacteria - did not initiate lysate gelation when studied "in vitro". Only very high concentrations of peptidoglycan, isolated from the cell walls of various gram-positive bacteria, induced the reaction. Therefore, these findings support the view, that the limulus test is relatively specific for the detection of gram-negative bacterial endotoxin and endotoxemia.
TI  - [Palatine tonsils and immunity. IV. Lymphocyte blast transformation in various lymphoid organs of animals immunized with microbial antigens].
AB  - For the purpose of ascertaining the peculiarities of cellular differentiation of  lymphoid cells of the palatine tonsils experiments were conducted on rabbits immunized intravenously and subcutaneously with streptococcus and paratyphoid B antigens; a study was made (in the blast-transformation reaction) of a comparative response of the lymphocytes of the palatine tonsils, the thymus, the spleen, the appendix and the regional lymph node. In case of stimulation with the specific microbial antigens and PHA the proliferative response was greater in the culture of the splenic lymphocytes and the regional lymph node than in the culture of the lymphocytes of the palatine tonsils and the appendix. The thymus lymphocytes responded to PHA only. A conclusion was drawn that the paratyphoid B and streptococcus antigens penetrating into the lymphoid tissue by hematogenic route stimulated a relatively low percentage of lymphocytes of the palatine tonsils and the appendix in comparison with the regional lymph node and the spleen.
TI  - Accelerated host metabolism of L-thyroxine during acute infection: role of the leukocyte and peripheral leukocytosis.
AB  - Metabolism of thyroid hormones is accelerated during acute infection in man and in experimental animals. The pathogenetic mechanisms mediating this phenomenon are uncertain, but activated leukocytes of the infected host have been implicated as potentially important sites of hormone degradation. The present studies were conducted in an attempt to assess the in vivo contribution of leukocytes and peripheral leukocytosis to the enhancement of L-thyroxine (T4) clearance seen during infection, and to evaluate further the possible roles of fever and of changes in the extracellular binding of T4. In 10 rhesus monkeys inoculated with virulent yellow fever (YF) virus, peripheral disposal of T4 was significantly accelerated (2-fold) during the febrile phase of the illness. This experimental viral infection was not accompanied by neutrophilic leukocytosis nor by detectable changes in serum free T4 levels, suggesting that neither an increased circulating neutrophil mass nor diminished extracellular binding of T4 contributed appreciably to the increase in metabolism of T4. A pathogenetic role for fever in the enhancement of T4 degradation was not specifically excluded in these infected monkeys. However, the failure of T4 turnover to increase during other febrile infections, such as that which followed inoculation of monkeys with Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, indicates that the acceleration of peripheral disposal of T4 seen in infection is not a simple concomitant of fever. In monkeys with bacterial sepsis and in those inoculated iv with zymosan particles, T4 turnover was similarly accelerated in the absence of detectable changes in serum free T4 levels, suggesting a pathogenetic role for enhances cellular uptake and metabolism of hormone. However, in these monkeys deiodination of T4 by leukocytes did not appear to account for the increase in T4 disposal. During sepsis and following zymosan administration, T4 turnover was markedly increased in both intact monkeys with a neutrophilic leukocytosis and in those with irradiation-induced neutropenia. Therefore, the cellular sites of increased T4 degradation during infection remain uncertain. Fixed tissue macrophages serve as the major site of clearance of YF virus, circulating bacteria and zymosan particles. Accordingly, a relationship between activation of these phagocytic cells and the acceleration of T4 metabolism seemed possible but was not established by our studies.

TI  - Deregulation of mouse antibody-forming cells in vivo in cell culture by streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin.
AB  - An unregulated, elevated rebound of antibody levels in rabbits was shown to follow late (10 to 15 days) after steptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin (SPE)-induced immunosuppression. Because of that result we have suggested that SPE acts by preferentially inhibiting a regulatory cell which normally limits the extent of full expression of antibody formation by B-cells. We are currently testing this hypothesis in mice. NIH (Swiss Webster) mice (+/+) or NIH (Swiss Webster) mice heterozygous (+/nu) for the mutant athymic nude gene and phenotypically normal showed an elevated plaque-forming cell (PFC) response to sheep erythrocytes (SE) late (10 to 15 days) after immunosuppressive SPE treatment similar to that described in rabbits. Homozygous nude mice (nu/nu) that are phenotypically athymic normally show a reduced early (4 day) PFC response to SE (a T-cell-dependent antigen) as compared with +/nu littermates or +/+ parent strain mice. This cryptic early 4-day response was improved by injection of purified endotoxin (a B-cell mitogen), but these relatively elevated nude PFC responses had decreased to normal control (SE only)nude PFC levels before 10 days. In similar SE-injected nude mice treated instead with SPE, no elevation at 4 days was observed and, more pertinently, the late (10 to 15 day) elevated rebound of PFC levels observed in normal response controls (+/nu or +/+) was not observed. Similar experiments were subsequently conducted in Marbrook-type spleen PFC cultures during periods of 12 days. The results of these experiments paralleled the in vivo results above, and in addition showed that SPE induced a large proliferation of either +/+ or +/nu cells (T-and B-cells) in culture but had no such effect on nu/nu cells (B-cells) in culture. Purified endotoxin, the Bcell mitogen, had a better sparing effect on nu/nu cells in this respect. These results are consistent with our premise that SPE inhibits preferentially the function of a regulator of the antibody response. The regulator appears to be a T-cell and is likely a suppressor T-cell.

The test solution had no effect on Klebsiella ozaenae, Brucella canis, Cornynebacterium pyogenes, Coryne, renale, Streptococcus equi and staphylococcus aureus.

These analogies of the toxins prompted comparative pyrogenic studies. When American Dutch rabbits were immunized by repeated intravenous injections of small amounts of staphylococcal enterotoxin, they exhibited a decreased febrile response upon challenge when compared with control animals not previously injected. The same animals responded similarly to control groups when challenged with streptococcal exotoxin A, B, or C. No cross-reactivity was observed in reciprocal cross-tests, using animals immune to the streptococcal toxins and challenging with staphylococcal enterotoxin. No cross-reactivity between either the streptococcal or staphylococcal toxins and bacterial endotoxin was observed.

TI  - Drug resistance among pathogenic bacteria from animals in Ontario.
AB  - Prevalence of antimicrobial drug resistance among over 3000 clinical isolates of  animal pathogens in Ontario during 1971-72 has been studied. A high number of multiple resistance patterns is prevalent among members of Enterobacteriaceae, especially Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium. The most common resistance pattern among bovine strains was against not less than six drugs in common use. Among different animal species the bovine population was found to be the source of a high percentage of chloramphenicol resistant E. coli and S. typhimurium organisms. All the isolates resistant to this drug were in addition resistant to three or more other antibiotics of established therapeutic value. All the multiple resistant isolates of S. typhimurium tested had R factors and they transferred most of the resistance determinants including that for chloramphenicol to a recipient E. coli in vitro.Penicillin resistance among Staphylococcus aureus of bovine mammary origin did not appear to be high. Antimicrobial drug susceptibility patterns of staphylococci, streptococci and Corynebacterium sp indicate effective in vitro activity with many antimicrobial agents.
TI  - Amino acid flux and protein synthesis after exposure of rats to either Diplococcus pneumoniae or Salmonella typhimurium.
AB  - At 26 h after inoculation of rats with Diplococcus pneumoniae, the serum concentrations of 10 and 20 individual amino acids were lower than corresponding values observed in pair-fed controls. In contrast, only 2 of 20 serum amino acids were similarly decreased in rats inoculated with Salmonella typhimurium. Despite these serum differences, a greater accumulation of labeled non-metabolizable amino acids occurred in the livers of rats infected with S. typhimurium. These data suggested a greater increase in the flux of amino acids from muscle to liver in the rats infected with S. typhimurium as compared to those infected with D. pneumoniae. A similar increase in serum protein synthesis was observed in rats infected with D. pneumoniae or S. typhimurium. However, with the latter infection, a larger percentage of the amino acids appeared to be utilized as a source of energy in addition to their role as precursors of proteins.

TI  - Genetic control of the antibody response to type 3 pneumococcal polysaccharide in mice. II. Relationship between IgM immunoglobulin levels and the ability to give an IgM antibody response.
AB  - Serum IgM immunoglobulin levels and antibody responses to an optimally immunogenic dose of Type III pneumococcal polysaccharide (SSS-III) were assessed for F(1), F(2), and backcross progeny derived from crosses between high responding BALB/cAnN (B) and low responding CBA/HN (C) mice. The results obtained confirmed our original hypothesis, namely, that a major component, present on the X chromosome, governs the ability to respond to SSS-III in a decisive manner. Although all low responding C mice had low IgM levels, both intermediate and high responders had high IgM levels of the same magnitude. Treatment with bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) resulted in a significant increase in the IgM levels of low responding C mice. While the IgM levels attained were similar to those of high responding B mice, not given LPS, no antibody specific for LPS appeared to be produced. These findings suggest that C mice are unable to make an IgM antibody response to SSS-III and other polysaccharide antigens, despite the fact that they possess the capacity to synthesize normal amounts of IgM immunoglobulin.
TI  - Comparative survival of indicator bacteria and enteric pathogens in well water.
AB  - The comparative survival of various fecal indicator bacteria and enteric pathogens was studied in a stable well water supply by using membrane chambers. There was more variation in the 29 coliform cultures and they died more rapidly, as a group, than the 20 enterococcus cultures that were examined. The comparative survival of the organisms tested follows: Aeromonas sp. > the shigellae (Shigella flexneri, S. sonnei, and S. dysenteriae) > fecal streptococci > coliforms = some salmonellae (Salmonella enteritidis ser. paratyphi A and D, S. enteritidis ser. typhimurium) > Streptococcus equinus > Vibrio cholerae > Salmonella typhi > Streptococcus bovis > Salmonella enteritidis ser. paratyphi B. S. bovis had a more rapid die-off than did S. equinus, but both had significantly shorter half-lives than the other streptococci. The natural populations of indicator bacteria from human and elk fecal material declined similarly to the pure cultures tested, whereas the die-off of fecal streptococci exceeded the coliforms from bovine fecal material.

Anaerobic PMN were able to kill Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus, viridans streptococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium perfringens, and Peptococcus magnus normally. Organisms that were not killed normally by anaerobic PMN included Staphylococcus aureus (strains Wood 46 and 502a), Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, and Salmonella typhimurium. These findings suggest that mechanisms other than those dependent on hydrogen peroxide may be important in the killing of some bacteria.

AB  - Increasing awareness of the need for a uniform quality control program prompted an evaluation of a commercially available set (Bact-Chek) of eight organisms. A protocol was designed in which this set of control cultures was tested simultaneously in the clinical microbiology laboratory of a 400-bed hospital (the Berkshire Medical Center) and in the reference laboratories of the Bacteriology Section of the Center for Disease Control. The results indicate that the Bact-Chek organisms are essentially as advertised: they constitute a basic set of cultures for a quality control program in clinical microbiology. Ninety per cent of the media and reagents (excluding mycobacterial media and reagents) in the clinical laboratory were checked with this set of eight cultures. Additional cultures not in the set were used to check the remaining 10% of the media and reagents.

AB  - Sera from normal rabbits were shown to have antibodies that bound radiolabeled test antigens derived from many taxonomically unrelated bacteria. Sera from rabbits that had been immunized with sonically treated material of 12 different bacteria, including M. bovis strain BCG, had antibodies that bound not only radiolabeled homologous test antigens but also radiolabeled antigens from many unrelated bacteria. Binding by normal and immunized sera to radiolabeled test antigens was inhibited by homologous unlabeled test antigens but not by substances such as bovine serum albumin, polyvinylpyrrolidone, sheep erythrocytes, and endotoxin. The broad range of shared or cross-reactivity among antigens in bacteria may explain the presence of antibodies to many bacteria in sera from normal humans and previously unimmunized experimental animals. The presence of these antibodies raises the question whether resistance to many bacterial infections may be partly due to immune mechanisms, whether cellular or humoral, that have been stimulated by unrelated bacteria.

AB  - Epicillin exhibits excellent therapeutic activity when administered orally or subcutaneously to mice infected with a variety of pathogenic bacteria. These included single strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, non-penicillinase-producing Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, Salmonella schottmuelleri, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, strains of microorganisms selected as typical of those that frequently cause serious clinical infections. In oral chemotherapeutic comparisons of tetracycline, chloramphenicol, cephalexin, ampicillin, and epicillin, the latter, with but minor exceptions, exhibited activity comparable to that of most of the other antibiotics studied. Oral administration to mice of a loading dose of epicillin or ampicillin resulted in similar peak blood levels and decay curves. The concentration in urine and the excretion rates were significantly higher in epicillin than in ampicillin-treated animals. Presumptive evidence suggests that the inter-pretation of zone diameters obtained with 10-mug epicillin discs should be the same as is used for 10-mug ampicillin discs.

TI  - An enzyme-based theory of obligate anaerobiosis: the physiological function of superoxide dismutase.
AB  - The distribution of catalase and superoxide dismutase has been examined in various micro-organisms. Strict anaerobes exhibited no superoxide dismutase and, generally, no catalase activity. All aerobic organisms containing cytochrome systems were found to contain both superoxide dismutase and catalase. Aerotolerant anaerobes, which survive exposure to air and metabolize oxygen to a limited extent but do not contain cytochrome systems, were found to be devoid of catalase activity but did exhibit superoxide dismutase activity. This distribution is consistent with the proposal that the prime physiological function of superoxide dismutase is protection of oxygen-metabolizing organisms against the potentially detrimental effects of the superoxide free radical, a biologically produced intermediate resulting from the univalent reduction of molecular oxygen.
TI  - Vitamin B12 uptake by intestinal microorganisms: mechanism and relevance to syndromes of intestinal bacterial overgrowth.
AB  - The mechanism of bacterial uptake of vitamin B(12), the spectrum of microorganisms capable of such uptake, and the factors involved were the subject of this study. Bacterial uptake of vitamin B(12) was found to be at least a two stage process. A primary uptake phase which was rapid (1 min or less), pH dependent, nontemperature dependent, did not require viable organisms and was insensitive to either the metabolic inhibitor dinitrophenol or to the sulfhydryl inhibitor N-ethyl-maleimide. Protein denaturation (formalin treatment or autoclaving) abolished all B(12) uptake. This primary uptake phase is thought to represent adsorption to binding or "receptor" sites on the cell wall. Second stage uptake was slower, pH and temperature dependent, required living bacteria, and was abolished by either dinitrophenol or N-ethyl-maleimide. This phase is dependent upon metabolic processes and may reflect transfer of B(12) from surface "receptor" sites into the bacterial cell. Although differences among organisms were observed in total 1 hr uptake, number of surface "receptor" sites, and relative avidities for B(12), all organisms except Streptococcus fecalis shared the two stage mechanism. Two Gram-positive organisms. Bacillus subtilis and Group A streptococcus, demonstrated the highest 1 hr vitamin B(12) uptake values; Gram-negative bacteria required 2,000-10,000 the number of organisms for comparable uptake. Binding constants (K(m)) varied from 5.05 +/-1.67 x 10(-10)M for B. subtilis to 6.18 +/-3.08 x 10(-9)M for Klebsiella pneumoniae which approximate the Km for human intrinsic factor (0.38 x 10(-10)M). Competition between bacteria and intrinsic factor for vitamin B(12) may be inferred from the similarity of these constants. These observations suggest that a variety of enteric and nonenteric organisms, not requiring exogenous B(12), may play a role in the pathogenesis of the vitamin B(12) malabsorption found in the intestinal bacterial overgrowth syndromes.

The combinations have remarkable antibacterial properties: 3.0 x 10(5)Escherichia coli cells per ml were killed when passed through a 3.8-g column of commercially available resin treated with triiodide (volume 4 ml after treatment). In an attempt to deplete the resin-triiodide complex, 1.14 x 10(9)E. coli cells in 15 liters were passed through the column with no significant loss of effectiveness. The antibacterial capabilities of the resin-triiodide columns ranged from 10(6)Salmonella typhimurium per ml to 1.1 x 10(4)Streptococcus faecalis per ml. Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were also tested and killed at concentrations of 1.8 x 10(4) and 1.3 x 10(5) per ml, respectively. The cells were not filtered from the water. They emerged from the column in nonviable form. This was demonstrated by using (14)C-labeled bacteria. The irreversible nature of the antibacterial action was revealed when attempts to wash the damaged cells did not restore viability.

The isoenzymes could be demonstrated by an alternative histochemical technique. Different isoenzyme patterns were found to be determined by the beta-galactosidase structural gene and not by the cytoplasm within which the beta-galactosidase was formed. In addition, the beta-galactosidases from strains which form isoenzymes were more stable to heat and urea treatments than the enzyme formed by those organisms which produce reduced amounts of, or no, isoenzyme.

TI  - Idiotypy of rabbit antibodies. I. Comparison of idiotypy of antibodies against Salmonella typhi with that of antibodies against other bacteria in the same rabbits, or of antibodies against Salmonella typhi in various rabbits.
AB  - Sera of rabbits immunized against Salmonella typhi have been studied for the idiotypy of certain of their components, i.e., the property of these components to possess an antigenic specificity which is different in individual rabbits, and which varies with the antigens against which these rabbits have been immunized. The reagent used (precipitating anti-idiotypic sera) have been prepared by injecting rabbits with bacteria agglutinated by anti-S. typhi sera (immunizing sera) as was done in the first observations by the authors of the phenomenon in the rabbit. These first observations have been confirmed and extended. In contrast to allotypy, the anti-idiotypic sera precipitate the corresponding immunizing sera, but not the sera taken in the immunizing rabbits prior to their immunization against S. typhi, nor the immunizing sera absorbed with the somatic antigen of S. typhi, demonstrating that idiotypes are antibodies. The idiotypic specificities of the antibodies of one rabbit against S. typhi are not detected in the antibodies of the same rabbit against another noncross-reacting Salmonella (S. tranoroa) and vice versa; nor are they detected in the anti-pneumococcal antibodies of the same rabbit. Each anti-idiotypic serum fails to precipitate anti-S. typhi sera of rabbits other than the immunizing one except for certain extremely faint reactions, the significance of which has not been established. The idiotypic specificities of anti-S. typhi antibodies of three rabbits were not found in anti-S. typhi antibodies of their parents. This lack of a sign of hereditary transmission of idiotypic specificities contrasts with allotypy. The apparent role of random chance in the determinism of the idiotypic patterns or of the idiotypic determinants has been discussed. Unless it were admitted that antibodies with similar functions do not exist in different individuals, idiotypy apparently adds an order of magnitude to the antibody variability which had been previously envisaged. In one given individual, the heterogeneity of the idiotypic specificities seems to be less extended than that of the antibody functions. The possible relationships between these two levels of molecular variability and between the corresponding levels of cellular variability have been discussed.

The bactericidal concentration for Salmonella typhosa was 1:400. In the presence of 5.0% horse serum, it increased to 1:250. The bacteriostatic concentration varied from organism to organism; Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus required 4,000 mug/ml for complete bacteriostasis, whereas Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Salmonella paratyphi-A, and Shigella required only 2,000 mug/ml for complete inhibition. A 4.0% concentration of the emulsion killed the spores of Bacillus subtilis within 6 hr.

Metabolites elaborated by the equivalent of less than a single cell of B. cereus, S. faecalis, P. vulgaris, or E. coli B were sensed by the electron capture detector. The flame ionization detector was generally not as sensitive. Volatile metabolites were identified, and their concentrations were determined.

TI  - In vivo and in vitro action of norethindrone on staphylococci.
AB  - Norethindrone has been examined in vitro for antibacterial activity against 10 microorganisms. Turbidimetric techniques were used to assay the antibacterial activity of norethindrone. The organisms tested included Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Micrococcus conglomeratus, Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus faecalis, Salmonella typhosa, Shigella flexnerii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Proteus vulgaris. Bacteriostatic action was shown only against the gram-positive microorganisms when they were grown anaerobically in Tryptic Soy Broth containing 10 to 50 mug of norethindrone per ml. The bacteriostatic action of norethindrone was exerted primarily during the first 8 hr of incubation and it was reduced by the presence of oxygen. Mestranol at a concentration of 1 to 10 mug/ml failed to exert any significant action on S. aureus. However, incorporation of 5 mug of mestranol per ml in the culture medium enhanced the bacteriostatic action of norethindrone on staphylococci. Enhancement of the bacteriostatic action of norethindrone could not be obtained by the addition of a concentration of 5 mug/ml of testosterone, 17alpha-estradiol, and 17beta-estradiol. Progesterone and 4-pregnen-20beta-ol-3-one under similar conditions showed an additive bacteriostatic effect when they were incorporated into the culture medium containing norethindrone. In vivo studies indicated that female, adult New Zealand rabbits, injected subcutaneously with two injections of 10 to 20 mug of norethindrone, 24 hr apart, and challenged intradermally with S. aureus 4 hr after the second injection, had fewer lesions with smaller areas of swelling and erythema as compared to control, nontreated rabbits. The protective effect of norethindrone on the development of staphylococcal lesion seemed related to hormone concentration. Thus, it was demonstrated with doses of 20, 15, and 10 mug, but not with doses of 1 and 5 mug. When the lesions were excised 48 to 92 hr after infection and when viable cell counts were made, rabbits treated with norethindrone showed significantly lower staphylococcal counts than the control rabbits. During the 1st day after infection with S. aureus, leukocytic counts of the norethindrone-treated rabbits remained normal, whereas control animals showed elevated leukocytic counts.

AB  - Studies of experimental infections in embryonated eggs demonstrated that prior allantoic infection with avirulent staphylococci afforded significant protection against subsequent challenge with virulent strains. All strains of coagulase-positive and coagulase-negative staphylococci tested that were relatively avirulent for embryonated eggs were capable of producing interference. The interference induced afforded protection not only against challenge with virulent staphylococci, but also against Diplococcus pneumoniae, Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, and one strain of influenza virus (A(2)J 305). Prior allantoic infection with avirulent staphylococci also protected against intravenous as well as allantoic infection with challenge strains.Interference required infection with viable bacteria. The onset of interference appeared within a few minutes after injection of the interfering strain, but was not maximal until 24 hours had elapsed between injection of the interfering and challenge strains. The protection afforded by the production of interference could not be overcome by increased inoculum size of the challenge strain and extended even to challenge with 10(9) bacteria. Studies of in vitro and in vivo growth of challenge strains in allantoic fluid demonstrated that some interfering strains inhibited growth of the challenge strains. Other strains produced interference without producing prolonged inhibition of the growth of challenge strains. Similarly, interference could not be attributed to attenuated virulence of the challenge organisms. All interfering strains studied produced enhanced bactericidal activity of whole blood from the affected embryos, but whether this affected leukocyte activity, opsonization, or other host defense mechanisms has yet to be determined.

AB  - Heat-killed strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus albus can induce  in guinea pigs a state of altered reactivity to skin homografts which is indistinguishable from that which results from sensitization with homologous tissues or Group A streptococci. Challenge of suitably prepared recipients with first-set skin homografts obtained from unrelated randomly selected donors elicits white graft reactions or accelerated rejection of such grafts. Other bacteria tested included Lancefield streptococcal groups B, C, D, E, G, H, L, and O, pneumococcus Types II, III, XIV and a rough strain, Corynebacterium xerosis, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Aerobacter aerogenes, Salmonella typhimurium, Proteus vulgaris, Neisseria catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, and two human virulent strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. None of these microorganisms was active in the induction of homograft sensitivity in the guinea pig. Pretreatment of recipients with Gram-negative bacterial suspensions was associated with a slight increase in the mean survival time of first-set skin homografts. Results of this study suggest the presence in staphylococci, as well as in Group A streptococci, of antigens related in their biologic effects to tissue transplantation antigens.

Caffeine was more antibacterial than theophylline, and the latter more than theobromine. Caffeine citrate exhibited greater inhibitory effect than did pure caffeine. The effect was both bacteriostatic and bactericidal against susceptible organisms. The susceptibility of organisms to xanthines differed greatly even in related species. The morphology of Aerobacter aerogenes and A. cloacae was affected under the influence of caffeine; filamentation of cells followed sublethal doses. Potentiation was seen with antibiotics and caffeine; resistant strains were killed with a lower dose of drug in the presence of caffeine. This potentiating effect was pronounced with the tetracyclines; with streptomycin, the effect was the contrary.

AB  - A new antibiotic was isolated from fermentations of Streptomyces erythreus designed for erythromycin A production. Isolation of this compound was accomplished by use of ion-exchange chromatography and countercurrent distribution. It crystallized from methyl isobutyl ketone in colorless acicular plates which melted at 127 to 130 C. The empirical formula was C(42)H(75)NO(14) with a molecular weight of 820. Electrometric titration in 66% dimethylformamide showed an apparent pKa of 8.4. Nuclear magnetic resonance, infrared, and ultraviolet absorption indicated a close resemblance of the compound to known erythromycins, although its chromatographic behavior and solubility differed from those of the known erythromycins. Its antimicrobial spectrum was similar to erythromycin A, but the minimal inhibitory concentrations were much higher.

AB  - The effect of aqueous extracts of carob (Ceratonia siliqua) pods, gallotannic acid, gallic acid, and catechol on several microorganisms was studied. Carob pod extract and tannic acid showed a strong antimicrobial activity toward some cellulolytic bacteria. On the basis of tannin content, to which antimicrobial effect was related, carob pod extracts inhibited Cellvibrio fulvus and Clostridium cellulosolvens at 15 mug/ml, Sporocytophaga myxococcoides at 45 mug/ml, and Bacillus subtilis at 75 mug/ml. The inhibiting concentrations for tannic acid were found to be 12, 10, 45, and 30 mug/ml, respectively. Gallic acid and catechol were much less effective. Tannic acid and the tannin fraction of carob extract exerted both bacteriostatic and bactericidal effects on C. fulvus. Respiration of C. fulvus in the presence of bactericidal concentrations of tannic acid or tannin fraction of carob extract was inhibited less than 30%. A partial formation of "protoplasts" by C. fulvus was obtained after 2 hr of incubation in a growth medium to which 20% sucrose, 0.15% MgSO(4).7H(2)O, and 10 to 50 mug/ml of tannic acid or 500mug/ml of penicillin, or both, had been added. Tannic acid and the tannin fraction of carob extract protected C. fulvus from metabolic lysis in sucrose solution. Although the growth of other microorganisms tested was only slightly affected, the morphology of some of them was drastically changed in the presence of subinhibitory concentrations of carob pod extracts of tannic acid. It is suggested that the site of action of tannins on sensitive microorganisms is primarily the cell envelope.

TI  - CELL WALL REPLICATION IN SALMONELLA TYPHOSA.
AB  - Changes in the fluorescence of the cell wall of Salmonella typhosa (TY2 W) were studied during growth after direct labeling with fluorescein conjugated homologous or "anti-O" globulins. Fluorescence decreased evenly with culture growth and cell division, but the addition ofchloramphenicol resulted in large, nondividing cells that showed increasing interruption of fluorescence of the wall marker. The process thus differs from the equatorial origin and discrete hemispherical addition of new wall previously described in Streptococcus pyogenes. These findings, in addition to demonstrating the formation of new wall in the presence of chloramphenicol, appear consistent only with the concept that wall replication in the salmonellas occurs by means of diffuse intercalation of new materials among old.

The nucleotidases were found to be very active in Proteus vulgaris, in which organism they were studied in detail. The relative activities, the pH optima, and the effect of metal ions were investigated. It was concluded that bacterial 3- and 5-nucleotidases are distinct and separate enzymes.

TI  - MODIFICATION OF HOST RESPONSES TO BACTERIAL ENDOTOXINS. I. SPECIFICITY OF PYROGENIC TOLERANCE AND THE ROLE OF HYPERSENSITIVITY IN PYROGENICITY, LETHALITY, AND SKIN REACTIVITY.
AB  - Evidence is presented suggesting that the apparent non-specificity of pyrogenic tolerance observed with Gram-negative bacterial endotoxins is due to related antigenic determinants associated with the macromolecular toxins. This is based on results obtained in rabbits from pyrogenic cross-tolerance tests with selected endotoxins. In these tests, purified endotoxins from Escherichia coli (COO8) and Chromobacterium violaceum (CV) gave results one might expect with non-reciprocal cross-reacting antigens in classical immune systems. Additional evidence for an immune mechanism in tolerance is suggested by the highly significant anamnestic response observed. Lipid A, a toxic derivative of the purified COO8 endotoxin, failed to induce pyrogenic tolerance against the parent toxin. These results are explained by assuming that endotoxins have two interdependent activities associated with different portions of the macromolecule; one is assumed to be responsible for the primary toxicity, and the other is involved in secondary toxicity. The latter is dependent on the hypersensitive state of the host. Additional evidence for the role of hypersensitivity in secondary toxicity is based on the observation that adult rabbits are highly sensitive to the pyrogenic, lethal, and skin-reacting activities of endotoxin in contrast to young animals which are more resistant to all of these attributes of toxicity. In adults, the host responses to pyrogenicity, lethality, and skin reactivity could be partially inhibited by the early exposure of the animals to massive doses of endotoxin equivalent to a LD(50). The pyrogenic tolerance shown in these animals was specific indicating that the inhibition of the hypersusceptibility to endotoxin involved an immunological mechanism. A mechanism of endotoxin tolerance is proposed and discussed based on the induction of specific antibodies capable of assisting the RES in the clearance and destruction of endotoxin. It is suggested that the present inconsistencies relative to the chemical nature and biological activities of endotoxins might be explained on the basis of these two activities and the failure to recognize the importance of the immunological state of the host in which the toxins are tested.
