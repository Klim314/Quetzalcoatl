TI  == development of bacterial and bifidobacterial communities in feces of newborn babies.
AB  == microbial 16s rdna from babies' fecal samples were amplified by pcr, and analysed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge), cloning and sequencing. pcr-dgge profiles were used to follow in time the colonization of the intestine by bacteria. four healthy babies, one baby who received antibiotics and their parents participated to the present study to determine the extent to which administration of antibiotics can modify the bacterial colonization of neonatal human gut and verify the influence of parental factors on the formation of the fecal bacterial community. in the healthy babies, escherichia coli or bacteria belonging to clostridium spp. were the initial colonizers rapidly followed by bifidobacterium, bacteroides, clostridium, streptococcus, enterococcus and actinomyces. bifidobacterium species appeared already after five days in the breast-fed babies while there was a delay in the baby who received a formula based diet during only one day after birth. in each baby two or three bifidobacterial species including b. infantis were found. the observed variations in species were not associated with the feeding changes. the comparison of dgge profiles of the babies and their parents patterns showed bands with equal migration suggesting a vertical transmission determined by genetic and environmental factors. the brief appearance of pioneer bacteria determined as being e. coli and enterococcus spp. in the profile from the baby under antibiotic therapy, was succeeded by a small stable community consisting of ruminococcus species. no bifidobacterium sequences were detectable in this antibiotic-treated  baby in spite of a partly breast-milk diet.

TI  == ischaemic mouse thigh model for evaluation of pathogenicity of non-clostridial anaerobes.
AB  == a mouse thigh model has been devised in which the growing culture of non-clostridial anaerobe in the ischaemic tissue produces inflammatory swelling and death. the swelling of the right thigh served as an index of pathogenicity of the test strain in comparison to the negatively reacting left thigh which received injection of the control strain of bifidobacterium infantis. actinomyces naeslundii exceptionally caused death in all animals within 24 h. mortality and thigh swelling were pronounced (greater than 75%) in case of fusobacterium gonidiaformans and propionibacterium acnes but less (less than 50%) in acidaminococcus fermentans. high (less than 75%) rate of thigh swelling was also  encountered in case of bacteroides oralis, bacteroides corrodens, fusobacterium necrophorum, fusobacterium prausnitzii, fusobacterium plauti, peptococcus prevotii, streptococcus intermedius, eubacterium lentum and propionibacterium freudenreichii ss. shermanii.
