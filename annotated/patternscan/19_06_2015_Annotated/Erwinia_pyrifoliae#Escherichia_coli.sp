TI  == identification and genetics of 6-thioguanine secreted by erwinia species and its  interference with the growth of other bacteria.
AB  == we identified a compound in culture supernatants of erwinia species, such as erwinia amylovora, e. pyrifoliae, e. billingiae, e. tasmaniensis, e. persicina and e. rhapontici absorbing at 340 nm, which was associated before with the yellow pigment produced by e. amylovora on media containing copper ions. the compound was purified from e. tasmaniensis strain et1/99 supernatants by chromatography on dowex-1 and dowex-50 columns and identified by hplc/ms and nmr  analysis as 6-thioguanine (6tg). its signal at 167 da matched with the expected molecular mass. by random mutagenesis with minitn5, we obtained mutants defective in the genes for pyrimidine and purine metabolism. a specific gene cluster with ycf genes described by us before, absent in the corresponding region of escherichia coli, was identified in the genome sequence of three erwinia species  and named tgs region for thioguanine synthesis. clones of the tgs gene cluster promoted 6tg synthesis and secretion in e. coli, when the bacteria were grown in  minimal medium supplemented with amino acids. 6tg was bacteriostatic for e. coli  and salmonella typhimurium strains, with cell growth resumed after prolonged incubation. similar results were obtained with p. agglomerans strains. bacteria from the genus pectobacterium were barely and rahnella or gibbsiella species were not inhibited by 6tg. adenine and guanine relieved the toxic effect of 6tg on e.  coli. non-producing strains were fully virulent on host plants. 6tg synthesis may help erwinias to interfere with growth of some microorganisms in the environment.

TI  == expression of lysozymes from erwinia amylovora phages and erwinia genomes and inhibition by a bacterial protein.
AB  == genes coding for lysozyme-inhibiting proteins (ivy) were cloned from the chromosomes of the plant pathogens erwinia amylovora and erwinia pyrifoliae. the  product interfered not only with activity of hen egg white lysozyme, but also with an enzyme from e. amylovora phage phiea1h. we have expressed lysozyme genes  from the genomes of three erwinia species in escherichia coli. the lysozymes expressed from genes of the e. amylovora phages phiea104 and phiea116, erwinia chromosomes and arabidopsis thaliana were not affected by ivy. the enzyme from bacteriophage phiea1h was fused at the n- or c-terminus to other peptides. compared to the intact lysozyme, a his-tag reduced its lytic activity about 10-fold and larger fusion proteins abolished activity completely. specific protease cleavage restored lysozyme activity of a gst-fusion. the bacteriophage-encoded lysozymes were more active than the enzymes from bacterial  chromosomes. viral lyz genes were inserted into a broad-host range vector, and transfer to e. amylovora inhibited cell growth. inserted in the yeast pichia pastoris, the phiea1h-lysozyme was secreted and also inhibited by ivy. here we describe expression of unrelated cloned 'silent' lyz genes from erwinia chromosomes and a novel interference of bacterial ivy proteins with a viral lysozyme.

TI  == molecular adaptation of a plant-bacterium outer membrane protease towards plague  virulence factor pla.
AB  == background: omptins are a family of outer membrane proteases that have spread by  horizontal gene transfer in gram-negative bacteria that infect vertebrates or plants. despite structural similarity, the molecular functions of omptins differ  in a manner that reflects the life style of their host bacteria. to simulate the  molecular adaptation of omptins, we applied site-specific mutagenesis to make epo of the plant pathogenic erwinia pyrifoliae exhibit virulence-associated functions of its close homolog, the plasminogen activator pla of yersinia pestis. we addressed three virulence-associated functions exhibited by pla, i.e., proteolytic activation of plasminogen, proteolytic degradation of serine protease inhibitors, and invasion into human cells. results: pla and epo expressed in escherichia coli are both functional endopeptidases and cleave human serine protease inhibitors, but epo failed to activate plasminogen and to mediate invasion into a human endothelial-like cell line. swapping of ten amino acid residues at two surface loops of pla and epo introduced plasminogen activation capacity in epo and inactivated the function in pla. we also compared the structure of pla and the modeled structure of epo to analyze the structural variations that could rationalize the different proteolytic activities. epo-expressing bacteria managed to invade human cells only after all extramembranous residues that differ between pla and epo and the first transmembrane beta-strand had been changed. conclusions: we describe molecular adaptation of a protease from an environmental setting towards a virulence factor detrimental for humans. our results stress the evolvability of bacterial beta-barrel surface structures and the environment as a source of progenitor virulence molecules of human pathogens.

TI  == the omptins of yersinia pestis and salmonella enterica cleave the reactive center loop of plasminogen activator inhibitor 1.
AB  == plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (pai-1) is a serine protease inhibitor (serpin) and a key molecule that regulates fibrinolysis by inactivating human plasminogen  activators. here we show that two important human pathogens, the plague bacterium yersinia pestis and the enteropathogen salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, inactivate pai-1 by cleaving the r346-m347 bait peptide bond in the reactive center loop. no cleavage of pai-1 was detected with yersinia pseudotuberculosis,  an oral/fecal pathogen from which y. pestis has evolved, or with escherichia coli. the cleavage and inactivation of pai-1 were mediated by the outer membrane  proteases plasminogen activator pla of y. pestis and pgte protease of s. enterica, which belong to the omptin family of transmembrane endopeptidases identified in gram-negative bacteria. cleavage of pai-1 was also detected with the omptins epo of erwinia pyrifoliae and kop of klebsiella pneumoniae, which both belong to the same omptin subfamily as pla and pgte, whereas no cleavage of  pai-1 was detected with omptins of shigella flexneri or e. coli or the yersinia chromosomal omptins, which belong to other omptin subfamilies. the results reveal a novel serpinolytic mechanism by which enterobacterial species expressing omptins of the pla subfamily bypass normal control of host proteolysis.

TI  == autoinducer-2 of the fire blight pathogen erwinia amylovora and other plant-associated bacteria.
AB  == autoinducers are important for cellular communication of bacteria. the luxs gene  has a central role in the synthesis of autoinducer-2 (ai-2). the gene was identified in a shotgun library of erwinia amylovora and primers designed for pcr amplification from bacterial dna. supernatants of several erwinia amylovora strains were assayed for ai-2 activity with a vibrio harveyi mutant and were positive. many other plant-associated bacteria also showed ai-2 activity such as  erwinia pyrifoliae and erwinia tasmaniensis. the luxs genes of several bacteria were cloned, sequenced, and complemented escherichia coli strain dh5alpha and a salmonella typhimurium mutant, both defective in luxs, for synthesis of ai-2. assays to detect ai-2 activity in culture supernatants of several pseudomonas syringae pathovars failed, which may indicate the absence of ai-2 or synthesis of another type. several reporter strains did not detect synthesis of an acyl homoserine lactone (ahl, ai-1) by erwinia amylovora, but confirmed ahl-synthesis  for erwinia carotovora ssp. atroseptica and pantoea stewartii.

TI  == erwinia pyrifoliae sp. nov., a novel pathogen that affects asian pear trees (pyrus pyrifolia nakai)
AB  == a novel pathogen from asian pears (pyrus pyrifolia nakai) was analysed by sequencing the 16s rdna and the adjacent intergenic region, and the data were compared to related enterobacteriaceae. the 16s rdna of the asian pear pathogen was almost identical with the sequence of erwinia amylovora, in contrast to the 16s-23s rrna intergenic transcribed spacer region of both species. a dendrogram was deduced from determined sequences of the spacer regions including those of several related species such as erwinia amylovora, enterobacter pyrinus, pantoea  stewartii subsp. stewartii and escherichia coli. dendrograms derived from 121 biochemical characteristics including biotype 100 data placed the asian pear pathogen close to erwinia amylovora and more distantly to other members of the species erwinia and to the species pantoea and enterobacter. another dna relatedness study was performed by dna hybridizations and estimation of delta tm  values. the asian pear strains constituted a tight dna hybridization group (89-100%) and were barely related to strains of erwinia amylovora (40-50%) with a delta tm in the range of 5.2-6.8. the g + c content of dna from the novel pathogen is 52 mol%. therefore, it is proposed that strains isolated from asian pears constitute a new species and the name erwinia pyrifoliae is suggested; the  type strain is strain ep 16/96t (= cfbp 4172t = dsm 12163t).
