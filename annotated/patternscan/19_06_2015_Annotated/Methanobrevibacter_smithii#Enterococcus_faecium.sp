TI  == evaluation of the nifh gene marker of methanobrevibacter smithii for the detection of sewage pollution in environmental waters in southeast queensland, australia.
AB  == this study aimed at evaluating the host-specificity and -sensitivity of the nifh  gene marker of methanobrevibacter smithii by screening 272 fecal and wastewater samples from 11 animal species including humans in southeast queensland (seq), australia. in addition, environmental water samples (n = 21) were collected during the dry and wet weather conditions and tested for the presence of the nifh marker along with other sewage-associated markers, namely, enterococci surface protein (esp) found in enterococci faecium, bacteroides hf183, adenoviruses (avs), and polyomaviruses (pvs). the overall host-specificity of the nifh marker  to differentiate between human and animal feces was 0.96 (maximum value of 1), while the overall sensitivity of this marker in human sourced feces and wastewater was 0.81 (maximum value of 1). among the 21 environmental water samples tested, 2 (10%), 3 (14%), 12 (57%), 6 (29%), and 6 (29%) were positive for the nifh, esp, hf183, avs and pvs markers, respectively. the prevalence of the nifh marker in environmental water samples, however, was low compared to other markers, suggesting that the use of this marker alone may not be sensitive  enough to detect fecal pollution in environmental waters. the nifh marker, however, appears to be sewage-specific in seq, australia, and therefore, it is recommended that this marker should be used as an additional marker in combination with the hf183 or viral markers such as avs or pvs for accurate and sensitive detection of fecal pollution in seq waterways.

TI  == microbial equol production attenuates colonic methanogenesis and sulphidogenesis  in vitro.
AB  == hydrogen gas produced during colonic fermentation is excreted in breath and flatus, or removed by hydrogen-consuming bacteria such as methanogens and sulphate-reducing bacteria. however, recent research has shown that h2 is also consumed by equol-producing bacteria during the reduction of daidzein into equol. in this study, the interactions between methanogens, sulphate-reducing, and equol-producing bacteria were investigated under in vitro simulated intestinal conditions. in the presence of daidzein, the equol-producing bacterial consortium epc4 gave rise to equol production in cultures of methanobrevibacter smithii or desulfovibrio sp. as well as in faecal samples with methanogenic or sulphate-reducing abilities. moreover, this supplementation significantly (p<0.001) decreased the methanogenesis and sulphidogenesis. the attenuation did not occur in the absence of a daidzein source. additionally, there was no influence of soy germ powder, daidzein or equol as such, excluding a possible inhibition by these compounds. finally, a stronger decrease was observed with increasing amounts of epc4 and a constant equol production, suggesting that the observed effect was only partly caused by the action of daidzein as a hydrogen sink. these findings are of relevance since abdominal discomfort such as bloating and flatulence, are related to colonic gas production, whereas equol has potential health benefits.
