TI  == roxithromycin. a review of its antibacterial activity, pharmacokinetic properties and clinical efficacy.
AB  == roxithromycin is an acid-stable orally administered antibacterial macrolide structurally related to erythromycin. it has an in vitro antibacterial profile similar to that of erythromycin, with activity against staphylococcus aureus, s.  epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, branhamella catarrhalis, mycoplasma pneumoniae, legionella pneumophila, chlamydia trachomatis, gardnerella vaginalis, haemophilus ducreyi, some anaerobes and other less common pathogens. roxithromycin has a pharmacokinetic profile that is characterised by excellent enteral absorption achieving high concentrations in most tissues and body fluids. the results of clinical studies with roxithromycin have confirmed the potential for its use in a variety of infections, which was suggested by its antibacterial  activity in vitro and pharmacokinetic profile. clinical efficacy has been confirmed in the treatment of respiratory tract infections, including community-acquired and atypical pneumonias, ear, nose and throat infections, genitourinary tract infections, and skin and soft tissue infections. in a relatively small number of patients roxithromycin has generally been shown to be  as effective as erythromycin and other appropriate antibacterial drugs in some of the above indications. roxithromycin is well tolerated and has less potential than erythromycin to produce clinically significant drug interactions. thus, roxithromycin is an orally active drug which should prove a useful alternative when selecting antibacterial therapy for indications where macrolides are appropriate.

TI  == the clinical use of macrolides.
AB  == macrolides are active against streptococcus pneumoniae, legionella spp. and mycoplasma pneumoniae, the main causes of community-acquired pneumonia they may therefore be used for the empirical treatment of community-acquired pneumonia, although emergent resistance in str. pneumoniae limits their use in some parts of the world. in patients with bronchitis the use of macrolides reduces the severity and duration of symptoms. macrolides have also been used successfully in the treatment of otitis media and sinusitis; combination with sulphonamides may be desirable. they may be effective in eradicating the carrier state of str. pyogenes, bordetella pertussis, corynebacterium diptheriae, and neisseria meningitidis. macrolides provide alternative therapy for the prophylaxis of recurrent acute rheumatic fever and of infective endocarditis after dental treatment. the cure rate with macrolides of streptococcal skin infections and of  minor staphylococcal infections is equal to that achieved with penicillins. in diarrhoea due to campylobacter jejuni, the administration of macrolides shortens  the duration of the faecal excretion of organisms and may give clinical improvement in severe disease. macrolides are the drugs of choice for infections  due to chlamydia trachomatis in pregnancy and for haemophilus ducreyi infections. they are effective alternative therapy to benzylpenicillin for the treatment of n. gonorrhoeae and treponema pallidum infections.
