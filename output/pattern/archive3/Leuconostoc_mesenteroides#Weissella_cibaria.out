in vitro and in vivo evaluation of lactic acid bacteria of aquatic origin as probiotics for turbot (scophthalmus maximus l.) farming.
turbot (scophthalmus maximus l.) is an important commercial marine flatfish. its  production may be affected by bacterial diseases that cause severe economical losses, mainly tenacibaculosis and vibriosis, provoked by tenacibaculum maritimum and vibrio splendidus, respectively. an alternative or complementary strategy to chemotherapy and vaccination for the control of these diseases is the use of probiotics. in this work, we report the in vitro and in vivo potential of eight lactic acid bacteria (lab), previously isolated from fish, seafood and fish products intended for human consumption, as turbot probiotics. seven out of the eight lab exerted direct antimicrobial activity against, at least, four strains of t. maritimum and v. splendidus. all lab survived in seawater at 18 degrees c for 7 days, and withstood exposure to ph 3.0 and 10% (v/v) turbot bile; however, they differed in cell surface hydrophobicity (8.2-21.7%) and in their ability to adhere to turbot skin (1.2-21.7%) and intestinal (0.7-2.1%) mucus. most of the tested strains inhibited the binding of turbot pathogens to the mucus. leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. cremoris smm69 and weissella cibaria p71 were selected based on their strong antimicrobial activity against t. maritimum and v. splendidus, good probiotic properties, and different adhesion ability to skin mucus and capacity to inhibit the adhesion of turbot pathogens to mucus. these two lab strains were harmless when administered by bath to turbot larvae and juveniles; moreover, real-time pcr on the transcription levels of the immunity-related genes encoding il-1beta, tnf-alpha, lysozyme, c3, mhc-ialpha and mhc-iialpha in five organs (head-kidney, spleen, liver, intestine and skin) revealed the ability of these lab to stimulate their expression in turbot juveniles, especially the non-specific immunity associated genes in mucosal tissues. based on our results, lc. cremoris smm69 and w. cibaria p71 may be considered as suitable probiotic candidates for turbot farming.
antifungal activity of strains of lactic acid bacteria isolated from a semolina ecosystem against penicillium roqueforti, aspergillus niger and endomyces fibuliger contaminating bakery products.
thirty samples of italian durum wheat semolina and whole durum wheat semolina, generally used for the production of southern italy's traditional breads, were subjected to microbiological analysis in order to explore their lactic acid bacteria (lab) diversity and to find strains with antifungal activity. a total of 125 presumptive lab isolates (gram-positive and catalase-negative) were characterized by repetitive extragenic palindromic-pcr (rep-pcr) and sequence analysis of the 16s rrna gene, leading to the identification of the following species: weissella confusa, weissella cibaria, leuconostoc citreum, leuconostoc mesenteroides, lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus rossiae and lactobacillus plantarum. the rep-pcr results delineated 17 different patterns whose cluster analysis clearly differentiated w. cibaria from w. confusa isolates. seventeen strains, each characterized by a different rep-pcr pattern, were screened for their antifungal properties. they were grown in a flour-based medium, comparable to a real food system, and the resulting fermentation products (fps) were tested against fungal species generally contaminating bakery products, aspergillus niger, penicillium roqueforti and endomyces fibuliger. the results of the study indicated a strong inhibitory activity - comparable to that obtained with the common preservative calcium propionate (0.3% w/v) - of ten lab strains against the most widespread contaminant of bakery products, p. roqueforti. the screening also highlighted the unexplored antifungal activity of l. citreum, l. rossiae and w. cibaria (1 strain), which inhibited all fungal strains to the same or a higher extent compared with calcium propionate. the fermentation products of these three strains were characterized by low ph values, and a high content of lactic and acetic acids.
