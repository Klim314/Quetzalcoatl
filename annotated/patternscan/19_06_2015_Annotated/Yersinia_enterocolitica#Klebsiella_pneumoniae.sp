TI  == antimicrobial impacts of essential oils on food borne-pathogens.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of twelve essential oil (pine oil, eucalyptus, thyme,  sage tea, lavender, orange, laurel, lemon, myrtle, lemon, rosemary and juniper) was tested by a disc diffusion method against food borne pathogens (escherichia coli, salmonella paratyphi a, klebsiella pneumoniae, yersinia enterocolitica, pseudomonas aeruginosa, aeromonas hydrophila, campylobacter jejuni, enterococcus  faecalis, staphylococcus aureus). the major components in essential oils were monoterpenes hydrocarbons, alpha-pinene, limonene; monoterpene phenol, carvacrol  and oxygenated monoterpenes, camphor, 1,8-cineole, eucalyptol, linalool and linalyl acetate. although the antimicrobial effect of essential oils varied depending on the chemical composition of the essential oils and specific microorganism tested, majority of the oils exhibited antibacterial activity against one or more strains. the essential oil with the lowest inhibition zones was juniper with the values varied from 1.5 to 6 mm. however, the components of essential oil of thyme and pine oil are highly active against food borne pathogen, generating the largest inhibition zones for both gram negative and positive bacteria (5.25-28.25 mm vs. 12.5-30 mm inhibition zones). these results  indicate the possibility use of the essential oils on food system as antimicrobial agents against food-borne pathogen. the article also offers some promising patents on applications of essential oils on food industry as antimicrobial agent.

TI  == aerobic bacterial microbiota isolated from the cloaca of the european pond turtle (emys orbicularis) in poland.
AB  == we conducted a comparative analysis of the aerobic cloacal bacteria of european pond turtles (emys orbicularis) living in their natural environment and juvenile  turtles reared under controlled conditions in a breeding center. we included 130  turtles in the study. the aerobic bacteria isolated from the cloaca of the juvenile turtles were less diverse and more prevalent than the bacteria isolated  from free-living adults. we isolated 17 bacterial species from juvenile captive turtles, among which the dominant species were cellulomonas flavigena (77/96), enterococcus faecalis (96/96), escherichia coli (58/96), and proteus mirabilis (41/96). from the adult, free-living turtles, we isolated 36 bacterial species, some of which are a potential threat to public health (e.g., salmonella enterica  serovars newport, daytona, and braenderup; listeria monocytogenes; yersinia enterocolitica; yersinia ruckeri; klebsiella pneumoniae; vibrio fluvialis; and serratia marcescens), and pathogens that are etiologic agents of diseases of ectothermic animals (e.g., aeromonas sobria, aeromonas caviae, hafnia alvei, edwardsiella tarda, and citrobacter braakii; the last two species were isolated from both groups of animals). the cloacal bacterial biota of the european pond turtle was characterized by numerous species of bacteria, and its composition varied with turtle age and environmental conditions. the small number of isolated bacteria that are potential human pathogens may indicate that the european pond turtle is of relatively minor importance as a threat to public health.

TI  == antibacterial, antiviral, and antifungal properties of wines and winery byproducts in relation to their flavonoid content.
AB  == grapes produce organic compounds that may be involved in the defense of the plants against invading phytopathogens. these metabolites include numerous phenolic compounds that are also active against human pathogens. grapes are used  to produce a variety of wines, grape juices, and raisins. grape pomace, seeds, and skins, the remains of the grapes that are a byproduct of winemaking, also contain numerous bioactive compounds that differ from those found in grapes and wines. this overview surveys and interprets our present knowledge of the activities of wines and winery byproducts and some of their bioactive components  against foodborne (bacillus cereus, campylobacter jejuni, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella enterica, staphylococcus aureus, yersinia enterocolitica, vibrio cholerae, vibrio vulnificus), medical (helicobacter pylori, klebsiella pneumoniae), and oral pathogenic bacteria, viruses (adeno, cytomegalo, hepatitis, noro, rota), fungi (candida albicans, botrytis cinerea), parasites (eimeria tenella, trichomonas vaginalis), and microbial toxins (ochratoxin a, shiga toxin) in culture, in vivo, and in/on food (beef, chicken, frankfurters, hot dogs, lettuce, oysters, peppers, pork, sausages, soup, spinach) in relation to composition and sensory properties. also covered are antimicrobial wine marinades, antioxidative and immunostimulating aspects, and adverse effects  associated with wine consumption. the collated information and suggested research needs might facilitate and guide further studies needed to optimize the use of wines and byproducts to help improve microbial food safety and prevent or treat animal and human infections.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of several plant extracts and oils against some gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == background: medicinal plants are considered new resources for producing agents that could act as alternatives to antibiotics in the treatment of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. the aim of this study was to evaluate the antibacterial activity of 28 plant extracts and oils against four gram-negative bacterial species. methods: experimental, in vitro, evaluation of the activities  of 28 plant extracts and oils as well as some antibiotics against e. coli o157:h7, yersinia enterocolitica o9, proteus spp., and klebsiella pneumoniae was  performed. the activity against 15 isolates of each bacterium was determined by disc diffusion method at a concentration of 5%. microdilution susceptibility assay was used in order to determine the minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of the plant extracts, oils, and antibiotics. results: among the evaluated herbs, only origanum syriacum l., thymus syriacus boiss., syzygium aromaticum l., juniperus foetidissima wild, allium sativum l., myristica fragrans houtt, and cinnamomum zeylanicum l. essential oils and laurus nobilis l. plant extract showed anti-bacterial activity. the mic50 values of these products against the gram-negative organisms varied from 1.5 (proteus spp. and k. pneumoniae( and 6.25 microl/ml (yersinia enterocolitica o9 ) to 12.5 microl/ml (e. coli o:157). conclusion: among the studied essential oils, o. syriacum l., t. syriacus boiss., c. zeylanicum l., and s. aromaticum l. essential oils were the most effective. moreover, cephalosporin and ciprofloxacin were the most effective antibiotics against almost all the studied bacteria. therefore, o. syriacum l., t. syriacus boiss., c. zeylanicum l., and s. aromaticum l. could act as bactericidal agents against gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == intestinal microbial community diversity between healthy and orally infected rabbit with entamoeba histolytica by eric-pcr.
AB  == enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (eric)-pcr was applied to analyze the difference of intestinal microbial community diversity between healthy and orally infected rabbits with entamoeba histolytica. the dynamic changes in different parts of digestive system including the duodenum, jejunum, ileum, caecum, and rectum in healthy and infected rabbits at different time points were  also tested. the intestinal microbial community of the control healthy rabbits was steady, and the total number of eric-pcr bands in the control healthy rabbit  was the least in the rectum and the most in the caecum. eric-pcr bands of orally  inoculated rabbits did not obviously change until 24 h after postinoculation (p.i.). the numbers of the eric-pcr bands gradually decreased from 24 to 72 h p.i., and then, with the development of disease, the band numbers gradually increased until 6 days p.i. sequence analysis showed that the nucleotide sequence homologies of the fragment about 1,200 bp of infected ileum sampled at 32 h p.i.  were above 95 % with sinorhizobium meliloti enterobacterial, erwinia amylovora and salmonella typhimurium, and the nucleotide sequence homologies of the fragment about 300 bp of infected ileum sampled at 48 h p.i. were more than 90 %  with xanthomonas campestris enterobacterial, yersinia enterocolitica subsp., shigella flexneri, s. meliloti enterobacterial, yersinia pestis, klebsiella pneumoniae subsp., and escherichia coli. the prominent bacteria had changed after e. histolytica infection. the dnastar of staple of eric-pcr showed that aerobe and facultative aerobe (e. coli, shigella, and salmonella) became preponderant bacilli in the intestine of orally infected rabbits with e. histolytica.

TI  == a rapid subtractive immunization method to prepare discriminatory monoclonal antibodies for food e. coli o157:h7 contamination.
AB  == to detect food e. coli o157:h7 contamination rapidly and accurately, it is essential to prepare high specific monoclonal antibodies (mabs) against the pathogen. cyclophosphamide (cy)-mediated subtractive immunization strategy was performed in mice to generate mabs that react with e. coli o157:h7, but not with  other affiliated bacteria. specificity of 19 mabs was evaluated by elisa and/or dot-immunogold filtration assay (digfa). immunogloubin typing, affinity and binding antigens of 5 selected mabs were also analysed. mabs 1d8, 4a7, 5a2 were found to have high reactivity with e. coli o157:h7 and no cross-reactivity with 80 other strains of bacteria including salmonella sp., shigella sp., proteus sp., yersinia enterocolitica, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacter freundii and other non-e. coli o157:h7 enteric bacteria. their ascetic titers reached 1:10(6) with e. coli o157:h7 and affinity constants ranged from 1.57 x 10(10) to 2.79 x 10(10) l/mol. the antigens recognized by them were different localized proteins. furthermore, immune-colloidal gold probe coated with mab 5a2 could specifically distinguish minced beef contaminated by e. coli o157:h7 from 84 other bacterial contaminations. the cy-mediated subtractive immunization procedure coupled with hybridoma technology is a rapid and efficient approach to prepare discriminatory mabs for detection of e. coli o157:h7 contamination in food.

TI  == development of a dna microarray for detection and identification of legionella pneumophila and ten other pathogens in drinking water.
AB  == the safety and accessibility of drinking water are major concerns throughout the  world. consumption of water contaminated with infectious agents, toxic chemicals  or radiological hazards represents a significant health risk and is strongly associated with mortality. therefore, we have developed an oligonucleotide-based  microarray using the sequences of 16s-23s rdna internal transcribed spacer regions (its) and the gyrase subunit b gene (gyrb) found in the most prevalent and devastating waterborne pathogenic agents. this new diagnostic contains 26 specific probes and can simultaneously detect aeromonas hydrophila, klebsiella pneumoniae, legionella pneumophila, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella spp., shigella spp., staphylococcus aureus, vibrio choleraeo, vibrio parahaemolyticus,  yersinia enterocolitica and leptospira interrogans. testing was carried out against a total of 218 bacterial strains, including 53 representative strains, 103 clinical isolates and 62 strains of other bacterial species belonging to 10 genera and 48 species. the results were specific and reproducible, with a detection sensitivity of 0.1 ng dna or 10(4)cfu/ml achieved for pure cultures of  each target organism. the diluted cultures and real drinking water samples were tested by the microarray with 100% accuracy. this novel diagnostic method is superior in time- and labor-efficiency to conventional bacterial culture and antiserum agglutination, and can be readily applied to epidemiological surveillance and other food safety applications.

TI  == antibacterial activity of artemisia nilagirica leaf extracts against clinical and phytopathogenic bacteria.
AB  == background: the six organic solvent extracts of artemisia nilagirica were screened for the potential antimicrobial activity against phytopathogens and clinically important standard reference bacterial strains. methods: the agar disk diffusion method was used to study the antibacterial activity of a. nilagirica extracts against 15 bacterial strains. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of the plant extracts were tested using two fold agar dilution method at concentrations ranging from 32 to 512 microg/ml. the phytochemical screening of extracts was carried out for major phytochemical derivatives in a. nilagirica. results: all the extracts showed inhibitory activity for gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria except for klebsiella pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis and staphylococcus aureus. the hexane extract was found to be effective against all phytopathogens with low mic of 32 microg/ml and the methanol extract exhibited a higher inhibition activity against escherichia coli, yersinia enterocolitica, salmonella typhi, enterobacter aerogenes, proteus vulgaris, pseudomonas aeruginosa (32 microg/ml), bacillus subtilis (64 microg/ml) and shigella flaxneri (128 microg/ml). the phytochemical screening of extracts answered for the major derivative of alkaloids, amino acids, flavonoids, phenol,  quinines, tannins and terpenoids. conclusion: all the extracts showed antibacterial activity against the tested strains. of all, methanol and hexane extracts showed high inhibition against clinical and phytopathogens, respectively. the results also indicate the presence of major phytochemical derivatives in the a. nilagirica extracts. hence, the isolation and purification  of therapeutic potential compounds from a. nilagirica could be used as an effective source against bacterial diseases in human and plants.

TI  == neonatal enteral feeding tubes as loci for colonisation by members of the enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == background: the objective of this study was to determine whether neonatal nasogastric enteral feeding tubes are colonised by the opportunistic pathogen cronobacter spp. (enterobacter sakazakii) and other enterobacteriaceae, and whether their presence was influenced by the feeding regime. methods: one hundred and twenty-nine tubes were collected from two neonatal intensive care units (nicu). a questionnaire on feeding regime was completed with each sample. enterobacteriaceae present in the tubes were identified using conventional and molecular methods, and their antibiograms determined. results: the neonates were  fed breast milk (16%), fortified breast milk (28%), ready to feed formula (20%),  reconstituted powdered infant formula (pif, 6%), or a mixture of these (21%). eight percent of tubes were received from neonates who were 'nil by mouth'. organisms were isolated from 76% of enteral feeding tubes as a biofilm (up to 107 cfu/tube from neonates fed fortified breast milk and reconstituted pif) and in the residual lumen liquid (up to 107 enterobacteriaceae cfu/ml, average volume 250 mul). the most common isolates were enterobacter cancerogenus (41%), serratia marcescens (36%), e. hormaechei (33%), escherichia coli (29%), klebsiella pneumoniae (25%), raoultella terrigena (10%), and s. liquefaciens (12%). other organisms isolated included c. sakazakii (2%),yersinia enterocolitica (1%),citrobacter freundii (1%), e. vulneris (1%), pseudomonas fluorescens (1%), and p. luteola (1%). the enteral feeding tubes were in place between < 6 h (22%)  to > 48 h (13%). all the s. marcescens isolates from the enteral feeding tubes were resistant to amoxicillin and co-amoxiclav. of additional importance was that a quarter of e. hormaechei isolates were resistant to the 3rd generation cephalosporins ceftazidime and cefotaxime. during the period of the study, k. pneumoniae and s. marcescens caused infections in the two nicus. conclusion: this study shows that neonatal enteral feeding tubes, irrespective of feeding regime,  act as loci for the bacterial attachment and multiplication of numerous opportunistic pathogens within the enterobacteriaceae family. subsequently, these organisms will enter the stomach as a bolus with each feed. therefore, enteral feeding tubes are an important risk factor to consider with respect to neonatal infections.

TI  == bacterial contamination of blood and blood components in three major blood transfusion centers, accra, ghana.
AB  == reports from studies conducted in several countries indicate a high incidence of  bacterial contamination of donor blood. the prevalence of bacterial contamination of blood and its products in ghana is not known. this study was conducted to determine the prevalence of bacterial contamination of blood and its products at  the three major blood transfusion centers in the greater accra region of ghana. stored whole blood and its products were cultured on different media, and isolates were identified using standard biochemical and bacteriological methods.  the susceptibility of the isolates to selected antimicrobial agents was also determined by the disc diffusion method. the overall prevalence rate was 9% (28/303; whole blood, 13% [24/192]; plasma, 3% [2/79]; platelet, 9% [2/22]). the  gram-positive bacteria isolated were coagulase-negative staphylococcus, s. aureus, and bacillus spp., and the gram-negative organisms were yersinia enterocolitica, citrobacter freundii, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and klebsiella pneumoniae. the gram-positive bacteria were sensitive to cloxacillin, erythromycin, tetracycline, and gentamicin but resistant to penicillin, ampicillin, cefuroxime, and cotrimoxazole, while the gram-negative bacteria were sensitive to amikacin and gentamicin but resistant to chloramphenicol, tetracycline, ampicillin, cefuroxime, cefotaxime (except y. enterocolitica), and cotrimoxazole. our results suggest that bacterial contamination of blood and its products is prevalent in ghana.

TI  == cationic compounds with activity against multidrug-resistant bacteria: interest of a new compound compared with two older antiseptics, hexamidine and chlorhexidine.
AB  == use of antiseptics and disinfectants is essential in infection control practices  in hospital and other healthcare settings. in this study, the in vitro activity of a new promising compound, para-guanidinoethylcalix[4]arene (cx1), has been evaluated in comparison with hexamidine (hx) and chlorhexidine (chx), two older cationic antiseptics. the mics for 69 clinical isolates comprising methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-sensitive s. aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons) (with or without meca), vancomycin-resistant enterococci, enterobacteriaceae producing various beta-lactamases and non-fermenting bacilli (pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumanii, stenotrophomonas maltophilia) were determined. cx1 showed similar activity against s. aureus, cons and enterococcus spp., irrespective of the presence of meca or van genes, or associated resistance genes, with very good activity against cons (mic <1 mg/l). variable activities were observed against enterobacteriaceae; the mics determined seemed to be dependent both on the genus  (mics of 2, 8 and 64 mg/l for escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and yersinia enterocolitica, respectively) and on the resistance phenotype production of [extended spectrum beta-lactase (esbls) or other beta-lactamases; overproduction of ampc]. poor activity was found against non-fermenting bacilli,  irrespective of the resistance phenotype. chx appeared to be the most active compound against all strains, with broad-spectrum and conserved activity against  multidrug-resistant strains. hx showed a lower activity, essentially against gram-positive strains. consequently, the differences observed with respect to cx1 suggest that they are certainly not the consequence of antibiotic resistance phenotypes, but rather the result of membrane composition modifications (e.g. of  lipopolysaccharide), or of the presence of (activated) efflux-pumps. these results raise the possibility that cx1 may be a potent new antibacterial agent of somewhat lower activity but significantly lower toxicity than chx.

TI  == determination of emitted airborne microorganisms from a bio-pak wastewater treatment plant.
AB  == results of a study conducted to assess the degree of airborne microbial contamination generated by a wastewater treatment plant (wwtp) with bioreactor "bio-pak" closed treatment system and evaluation of the dispersion of potential pathogens are described. over the year aerosol samples were collected simultaneously with sedimentation and impact methods from several plant sites and the surroundings. external upwind sites were used as control. total colony-forming counts of heterotrophic psychrophilic, psychrotrophic, mesophilic, haemolytic bacteria, as well as members of the enterobacteriaceae family, staphylococcus, enterococcus and pseudomonas genera, actinomycetes and fungi (moulds, yeasts and yeast-like fungi) were determined. their highest concentrations ranged up to 10(1)-10(3)cfu/m(3) (with the exception of moulds exceeding 2x10(4)) were determined in air sampled inside the bioreactor, its vicinity, and near the grate chamber. higher species diversity of the family enterobacteriaceae (including shigella spp., yersinia enterocolitica, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae ozaenae) in the air sampled inside or near the bioreactor may imply a health risk for staff exposed for longer periods of time.  notwithstanding, no increased emission of the analysed groups of microorganisms,  including faecal bacteria, were found outside the wwtp.

TI  == bacterial particle endocytosis by epithelial cells is selective and enhanced by tumor necrosis factor receptor ligands.
AB  == bacterial pathogens use virulence strategies to invade epithelial barriers, but active processes of epithelial cells may also contribute to the endocytosis of microbial particles. to focus on the latter, we studied the uptake of fixed and fluorescently labeled bacterial particles in intestinal and bronchoepithelial cell cultures and found it to be enhanced in caco-2bbe and nci-h292 cells after treatment with tumor necrosis factor alpha and an agonist antibody against the lymphotoxin beta receptor. confocal fluorescence microscopy, flow cytometry, and  transmission electron microscopy revealed that staphylococcus aureus and yersinia enterocolitica were readily endocytosed, although there was scant uptake of shigella sonnei, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, and klebsiella pneumoniae particles. endocytosed staphylococcus was often associated with cytoplasmic claudin-4 vesicles; this was not found for yersinia, suggesting that  cytokine treatment upregulated two distinct endocytosis pathways. interestingly,  when staphylococcus and yersinia were coincubated with epithelial monolayers, the cells were unlikely to take up yersinia unless they had also endocytosed large numbers of staphylococcus particles, although the two bacteria were apparently processed in distinct compartments. cytokine treatment induced an upregulation and redistribution of beta1 integrin to the apical surface of nci-h292 cells; consistent with this effect, treatment with anti-beta1 integrin antibody blocked  uptake of both yersinia and staphylococcus in nci-h292 and caco-2bbe cells. our results suggest that capture of bacterial particles by mucosal epithelial cells is selective and that different endocytic mechanisms are enhanced by proinflammatory cytokines.

TI  == isolation and purification of enterocin e-760 with broad antimicrobial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == strain nrrl b-30745, isolated from chicken ceca and identified as enterococcus durans, enterococcus faecium, or enterococcus hirae, was initially identified as  antagonistic to campylobacter jejuni. the isolate produced a 5,362-da bacteriocin (enterocin) that inhibits the growth of salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis,  s. enterica serovar choleraesuis, s. enterica serovar typhimurium, s. enterica serovar gallinarum, escherichia coli o157:h7, yersinia enterocolitica, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae, shigella dysenteriae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, listeria monocytogenes, campylobacter jejuni, and 20  other campylobacter species isolates. the enterocin, e-760, was isolated and purified by cation-exchange and hydrophobic-interaction chromatographies. the proteinaceous nature of purified enterocin e-760 was demonstrated upon treatment  with various proteolytic enzymes. specifically, the antimicrobial peptide was found to be sensitive to beta-chymotrypsin, proteinase k, and papain, while it was resistant to lysozyme and lipase. the enterocin demonstrated thermostability  by retaining activity after 5 min at 100 degrees c and was stable at ph values between 5.0 and 8.7. however, activity was lost below ph 3.0 and above ph 9.5. administration of enterocin e-760-treated feed significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the colonization of young broiler chicks experimentally challenged and colonized  with two strains of c. jejuni by more than 8 log(10) cfu. enterocin e-760 also significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the colonization of naturally acquired campylobacter species in market age broiler chickens when administered in treated feed 4 days prior to analysis.

TI  == the yompc protein of yersinia enterocolitica: molecular and physiological characterization.
AB  == the structural gene coding for yompc has been identified in the genome of a pathogenic strain of yersinia enterocolitica o:9, and was subsequently cloned and sequenced. detailed alignment of the deduced amino acid sequence showed that yompc is a member of the ompc porin family with the highest degree of homology to klebsiella pneumoniae. the mutant lacking yompc porin was constructed by insertional inactivation of the yompc gene which resulted from the integration of suicide vector at the yompc locus. in intact cells of y. enterocolitica, loss of  the yompc protein reduced the outer membrane permeability for beta-lactam antibiotics and tetracycline and resulted in a 2-5-fold increase in resistance to these compounds, depending on their chemical properties. mutation in the ompr regulatory gene resulted in the loss of both yompc and yompf porins, which led to a greater increase of resistance to antibiotics, as compared with the yompc mutant strain. moreover, the binding assay with hep-2 cells suggests that yompc may play a role in the adhesion properties of y. enterocolitica strains.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of extracts of chemical races of the lichen pseudevernia furfuracea and their physodic acid, chloroatranorin, atranorin, and olivetoric acid constituents.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity and the mic values of the ethanol, chloroform, diethyl ether, and acetone extracts of the chemical races of pseudevernia furfuracea (var. furfuracea and var. ceratea) and their physodic acid, chloroatranorin, atranorin, and olivetoric acid constituents have been investigated against some microorganisms. nearly all extracts of both chemical races showed antimicrobial activity against aeromonas hydrophila, bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, listeria monocytogenes, proteus vulgaris, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus faecalis, yersinia enterocolitica, candida albicans, candida glabrata, alternaria alternata, ascochyta rabiei, aspergillus niger, fusarium culmorum, fusarium moniliforme, fusarium oxysporum, fusarium solani, and penicillium notatum. there  was no antimicrobial activity of the extracts against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas syringae, salmonella typhimurium, alternaria citri, alternaria tenuissima, and gaeumannomyces graminis. chloroatranorin and olivetoric acid were active against the same microorganisms with few exceptions. physodic acid was active against about the same bacteria and yeasts and inactive against all of the filamentous fungi tested. also no activity of atranorin against the filamentous fungi was observed.

TI  == photochemical treatment of plasma with amotosalen and long-wavelength ultraviolet light inactivates pathogens while retaining coagulation function.
AB  == background: the intercept blood system, a photochemical treatment (pct) process,  has been developed to inactivate pathogens in platelet concentrates. these studies evaluated the efficacy of pct to inactivate pathogens in plasma and the effect of pct on plasma function. study design and methods: jumbo (600 ml) plasma units were inoculated with high titers of test pathogens and treated with 150 micromol per l amotosalen and 3 j per cm(2) long-wavelength ultraviolet light. the viability of each pathogen before and after treatment was measured with biological assays. plasma function was evaluated through measurement of coagulation factors and antithrombotic protein activities. results: the levels of inactivation expressed as log-reduction were as follows: cell-free human immunodeficiency virus-1 (hiv-1), greater than 6.8; cell-associated hiv-1, greater than 6.4; human t-lymphotropic virus-i (htlv-i), 4.5; htlv-ii, greater than 5.7; hepatitis b virus (hbv) and hepatitis c virus, greater than 4.5; duck hbv, 4.4 to 4.5; bovine viral diarrhea virus, 6.0; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, 5.5; west nile virus, 6.8; bluetongue virus, 5.1; human adenovirus 5, 6.8; klebsiella pneumoniae, greater than 7.4; staphylococcus epidermidis and yersinia enterocolitica, greater than 7.3; treponema pallidum, greater than 5.9; borrelia burgdorferi, greater than 10.6; plasmodium falciparum, 6.9; trypanosoma cruzi, greater than 5.0; and babesia microti, greater than 5.3.  retention of coagulation factor activity after pct was expressed as the proportion of pretreatment (baseline) activity. retention was 72 to 73 percent of baseline fibrinogen and factor (f)viii activity and 78 to 98 percent for fii, fv, fvii, f ix, fx, fxi, fxiii, protein c, protein s, antithrombin, and alpha2-antiplasmin. conclusion: pct of plasma inactivated high levels of a wide range of pathogens while maintaining adequate coagulation function. pct has the potential to reduce the risk of transfusion-transmitted diseases in patients requiring plasma transfusion support.

TI  == elimination and multiplication of bacteria during preparation and storage of buffy coat-derived platelet concentrates.
AB  == background: the prevalence of bacterial contamination of random-donor platelet concentrates (pcs) is considerably lower than that of blood donations. which key  steps of the preparation procedure contribute to the elimination of bacteria was  investigated. study design and methods: ten bacteria species were used. blood donations were spiked with bacteria and stored at 22 degrees c for 8 hours. the buffy coats were kept for 6 hours. pcs were prepared from pools of 4 buffy coats. at each preparation step and during pc storage, bacteria contents were measured.  in additional experiments, the titers of spiked blood and buffy coats were determined after storage at 20, 22, or 24 degrees c for 8 and up to 24 hours, respectively. results: enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, and yersinia enterocolitica were completely inactivated during storage in blood or buffy coats. titer reduction was between 3.32 and 4.62 log. bacillus cereus, propionibacterium acnes, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis did not multiply. compared with their values in spiked blood the titers in the pcs were reduced by 1.7 to 2.8 log. klebsiella pneumoniae was the only species that grew in blood. with the exception of p. acnes, those species that were not removed by the preparation process multiplied in the pcs. remarkable donor-to-donor variations of the bactericidal activities of buffy coats were detected when the storage time was prolonged to 24 hours. conclusions: bacteria are significantly eliminated by the preparation procedure for random donor pcs. also, blood and buffy coats are bactericidal for  most species. when buffy-coat storage is prolonged, it cannot, however, be predicted whether specific strains vanish or multiply.

TI  == basics of flow cytometry-based sterility testing of platelet concentrates.
AB  == background: flow cytometry (facs) is a common technique in blood banking. it is used, for example, for the enumeration of residual white blood cells in plasma and in cellular blood products. it was investigated whether it can also be applied for sterility testing of buffy coat-derived platelet concentrates (pcs).  study design and methods: plasma-reduced pcs were spiked with bacteria and stored at 20 to 24 or 37 degrees c for various times. the following 10 species were used: bacillus cereus, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, propionibacterium acnes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, serratia marcescens, and yersinia enterocolitica. bacterial dna was stained with thiazole orange. after the platelets were lysed, bacteria were enumerated by facs. results: all bacteria species used were detectable by facs. the lower detection limit was approximately 100 bacteria per microl, that is, 10(5) per ml. in general, the titers measured were 1.2- to 3-fold higher than those determined by colony forming assay. in one  case (k. pneumoniae) in which the dot plot of the bacteria cloud overlapped with  that of bacteria debris, they were consistently lower. when pc samples were inoculated with approximately 1 colony-forming unit per ml of bacteria and kept at 37 degrees c, most species were detected within 21 hours or less. exceptions were e. cloacae and p. acnes, which were detected after 24 to 40 and 64 hours, respectively. at 20 to 24 degrees c, the detection times were strongly prolonged. conclusion: sterility testing of pcs by facs is a feasible approach. the present  data suggest incubating pc samples for 20 to 24 hours at 37 degrees c before testing. for slow-growing bacteria, the incubation period must be prolonged by 1  to 2 days.

TI  == photochemical treatment of platelet concentrates with amotosalen and long-wavelength ultraviolet light inactivates a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == background: bacterial contamination of platelet (plt) concentrates can result in  transfusion-transmitted sepsis. a photochemical treatment (pct) process with amotosalen hcl and long-wavelength ultraviolet light (uva), which cross-links nucleic acids, was developed to inactivate bacteria and other pathogens in plt concentrates. study design and methods: high titers of pathogenic aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive bacteria (10 species), aerobic gram-negative bacteria (7  species), and spirochetes (2 species) were added to single-donor plt concentrates containing 3.0 x 10(11) to 6.0 x 10(11) plts in approximately 300 ml of 35 percent plasma and 65 percent plt additive solution (intersol, baxter healthcare) or saline. after pct with 150 micro mol per l amotosalen and 3 j per cm(2) uva, residual bacterial levels were detected by sensitive microbiologic methods. results: the level of inactivation of viable bacteria was expressed as log reduction. log reduction of gram-positive bacteria for staphylococcus epidermidis was > 6.6; for staphylococcus aureus, 6.6; for streptococcus pyogenes, > 6.8; for listeria monocytogenes, > 6.3; for corynebacterium minutissimum, > 6.3; for bacillus cereus (vegetative), > 5.5; for lactobacillus sp., > 6.4; for bifidobacterium adolescentis, > 6.0; for propionibacterium acnes, > 6.2; and for  clostridium perfringens, > 6.5. log reduction of gram-negative bacteria for escherichia coli was > 6.4; for serratia marcescens, > 6.7; for klebsiella pneumoniae, > 5.6; for pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4.5; for salmonella choleraesuis,  > 6.2; for yersinia enterocolitica, > 5.9; and for enterobacter cloacae, 5.9. log reduction of spirochetes for treponema pallidum was 6.8 to 7.0, and for borrelia  burgdorferi, > 6.9. conclusion: pct inactivates high levels of a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria. the inactivation of bacteria in plt concentrates offers the potential to prospectively prevent plt-transfusion-associated bacteremia.

TI  == highly divergent rfah orthologs from pathogenic proteobacteria can substitute for escherichia coli rfah both in vivo and in vitro.
AB  == the transcriptional enhancer protein rfah positively regulates production of virulence factors in escherichia coli and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium via a cis element, ops. genes coding for rfah orthologs were identified in conceptually translated genomes of bacterial pathogens, including vibrio and yersinia spp. we cloned the rfah genes from vibrio cholerae, yersinia enterocolitica, s. enterica serovar typhimurium, and klebsiella pneumoniae into e. coli expression vectors. purified rfah orthologs, including the most divergent one from v. cholerae, were readily recruited to the e. coli transcription elongation complex. postrecruitment stimulation of transcript elongation appeared to vary with the degree of similarity to e. coli rfah. v. cholerae rfah was particularly defective in reducing downstream pausing and termination; this defect was substantially alleviated by an increase in its concentration. when overexpressed episomally, all of the rfah genes complemented the disruption of the chromosomal copy of the e. coli gene. thus, despite the apparently accelerated divergent evolution of the rfah proteins, the mechanism of their action is conserved well enough to make them transcriptionally active in the e. coli system.

TI  == comparative immune responses to candidate arthritogenic bacteria do not confirm a dominant role for klebsiella pneumonia in the pathogenesis of familial ankylosing spondylitis.
AB  == objective: using humoral immune responses, klebsiella pneumoniae has been implicated as a candidate microbial trigger in ankylosing spondylitis (as) by several investigators but refuted by others. the objective of this case-control study was to compare the cellular (t-cell proliferation) and humoral (igg and iga, by elisa) immune responses of affected individuals in multiplex as families  with those of unaffected family members and normal healthy controls in order to find out whether affected individuals exhibit a predominant immune response to k. pneumoniae. methods: twenty-five families with two or more individuals affected with as and 34 normal healthy controls matched with the affected family members for age, sex and ethnicity were enrolled in the study. all affected (n = 57) and  unaffected (n = 37) family members had a detailed clinical evaluation. peripheral blood was drawn to determine t-lymphocyte proliferation and the igg and iga (by elisa analysis) immune responses to k. pneumoniae, salmonella typhimurium, yersinia enterocolitica and chlamydia trachomatis. immune responses to each of the four candidate organisms were compared in affected and unaffected individuals. each individual was classified by the predominant antigenic immune response that they showed when comparison was made among the same concentrations  of the four candidate microbial antigens. this stratification was then used (i) to compare immune responses in affected and unaffected family members and (ii) to compare clinical characteristics of affected family members. results: there was no difference in mean stimulation indices or antibody responses between affected  and unaffected family members for each of the candidate organisms. in terms of predominant cellular immune responses to these organisms, there was no difference between affected and unaffected family members with respect to k. pneumoniae, c.  trachomatis or y. enterocolitica. however, a higher percentage of affected family members (25.9%) exhibited a predominant response to s. typhimurium compared with  unaffected family members (5.9%, p < 0.02). in assessing antibody titres, k. pneumoniae was the predominant amongst these four organisms, but there was no difference between affected family members, unaffected family members and normal  healthy controls. there was no relationship between immune responses and clinical characteristics. conclusion: our analysis of affected and unaffected family members in familial as demonstrated no significant differences with respect to cellular or humoral immune responses to k. pneumoniae and three control microbes. in addition, k. pneumoniae did not exhibit a predominant immune response in affected individuals. thus we find no supportive evidence to implicate a causal role for k. pneumoniae in familial as.

AB  == to determine the function of the waae gene in the biosynthesis of the inner-core  lps of klebsiella pneumoniae, a waae non-polar mutant has been constructed. data  obtained from the comparative chemical analysis of lps samples obtained from the  wild-type, the mutant strain and the complemented mutant demonstrated that the waae gene is involved in substitution of alpha-l-glycero-d-manno-heptopyranose i  (l,d-heppi) at the o-4 position by a beta-d-glucopyranose (beta-d-glcp) residue.  in addition, dna amplification and nucleotide sequence determination studies revealed that waae homologues located between the waaa and coad genes are present in clinical isolates of enterobacteriaceae containing the structure beta-d-glcp-(1-->4)-alpha-l,d-heppi (k. pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis and yersinia enterocolitica), as well as in strains of serratia marcescens and enterobacter aerogenes of unknown lps-core structures. complementation studies using non-polar waae mutants prove that all the waae homologues perform the same  function. furthermore, k. pneumoniae, ser. marcescens and p. mirabilis non-polar  waae mutants showed reduced adhesion and pathogenicity. in addition, the ser. marcescens and p. murabilis waae mutants showed reduced swarming motility and ability to form biofilms in vitro. all these characteristics were rescued by reintroduction of the waae gene independently of its origin. an easy dna amplification method to detect this gene was established, which also helps in finding the potential presence of this structural feature [beta-d-glcp-(1-->4)-alpha-l,d-heppi] in the inner-core lps of enterobacteriaceae members with unknown lps-core structures.

TI  == development of an elisa using a recombinant 41 kda partial protein (p45n') for the detection of riemerella anatipestifer infections in ducks.
AB  == riemerella anatipestifer, a gram-negative bacillus, is the causative agent of duck septicemia, a disease which could incur much economic loss in the duck industry. an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) has been developed to facilitate early detection of r. anatipestifer infection in ducks. the antigen used was a recombinant 41 kda n-terminal fragment (rp45n') of a newly characterized r. anatipestifer potential surface protein, p45, which was expressed in escherichia coli as an n-terminal gst fusion protein. the rp45n'-based elisa successfully detected p45 antibodies in the sera of 20 ducks immunized with bacterin preparations of r. anatipestifer serotypes 1, 10 15, 19 and the atcc11845 strain. antibodies to p45 were also detected in the sera of 25% (75/296) of white pekin ducks which were imported into singapore from three different farms. successful discrimination was obtained between sera from infected ducks and that of specific-pathogen free ducks (p<0.01). the rp45n'-gst  antigen did not cross-react with antibodies in sera from guinea pigs which were infected with other gram-negative and gram-positive bacterial pathogens, including aeromonas hydrophila, citrobacter freundii, e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pastuerella multocida, proteus mirabilis, salmonella spp., serratia maccescens, shigella sonnei and yersinia enterocolitica. in addition, the dna sequence encoding p45 was detected in r. anatipestifer serotypes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 and the atcc11845 strain, suggesting that  p45 is probably also universally expressed in these r. anatipestifer serotypes. thus, the elisa described is applicable to the detection of r. anatipestifer infection in ducks.

TI  == genetic characterization of the klebsiella pneumoniae waa gene cluster, involved  in core lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis.
AB  == a recombinant cosmid containing genes involved in klebsiella pneumoniae c3 core lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis was identified by its ability to confer bacteriocin 28b resistance to escherichia coli k-12. the recombinant cosmid contains 12 genes, the whole waa gene cluster, flanked by kbl and coad genes, as  was found in e. coli k-12. pcr amplification analysis showed that this cluster is conserved in representative k. pneumoniae strains. partial nucleotide sequence determination showed that the same genes and gene order are found in k. pneumoniae subsp. ozaenae, for which the core chemical structure is known. complementation analysis of known waa mutants from e. coli k-12 and/or salmonella enterica led to the identification of genes involved in biosynthesis of the inner core backbone that are shared by these three members of the enterobacteriaceae. k. pneumoniae orf10 mutants showed a two-log-fold reduction in a mice virulence assay and a strong decrease in capsule amount. analysis of a constructed k. pneumoniae waae deletion mutant suggests that the waae protein is involved in the transfer of the branch beta-d-glc to the o-4 position of l-glycero-d-manno-heptose i, a feature shared by k. pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and yersinia enterocolitica.

AB  == rsmb(ecc) specifies a nontranslatable rna regulator that controls exoprotein production and pathogenicity in soft rot-causing erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora. this effect of rsmb(ecc) rna is mediated mostly by neutralizing the function of rsma(ecc), an rna-binding protein of e. carotovora subsp. carotovora, which acts as a global negative regulator. to determine the occurrence of functional homologs of rsmb(ecc) in non-soft-rot-causing erwinia species, we cloned the rsmb genes of e. amylovora (rsmb(ea)) and e. herbicola pv. gypsophilae (rsmb(ehg)). we show that rsmb(ea) in e. amylovora positively regulates extracellular polysaccharide (eps) production, motility, and pathogenicity. in e. herbicola pv. gypsophilae, rsmb(ehg) elevates the levels of transcripts of a cytokinin (etz) gene and stimulates the production of eps and yellow pigment as well as motility. rsma(ea) and rsma(ehg) have more than 93% identity to rsma(ecc) and, like the latter, function as negative regulators by affecting the transcript stability of the target gene. the rsmb genes reverse the negative effects of rsma(ea), rsma(ehg), and rsma(ecc), but the extent of reversal is highest with homologous combinations of rsm genes. these observations and findings that rsmb(ea) and rsmb(ehg) rna bind rsma(ecc) indicate that the rsmb effect is channeled via rsma. additional support for this conclusion comes from the observation that the rsmb genes are much more effective as positive regulators in a rsma(+) strain of e. carotovora subsp. carotovora than in its rsma(-) derivative. e. herbicola pv. gypsophilae produces a 290-base rsmb transcript that is not subject to processing. by contrast, e. amylovora produces 430- and 300-base rsmb transcripts, the latter presumably derived by processing of the primary transcript as previously noted with the transcripts of rsmb(ecc). southern blot hybridizations revealed the presence of rsmb homologs in e. carotovora, e. chrysanthemi, e. amylovora, e. herbicola, e. stewartii and e. rhapontici, as well as in other enterobacteria such as escherichia coli, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, serratia marcescens, shigella flexneri,  enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, yersinia enterocolitica, and y. pseudotuberculosis. a comparison of rsmb sequences from several of these enterobacterial species revealed a highly conserved 34-mer region which is predicted to play a role in positive regulation by rsmb rna.

TI  == [diagnostic value of a novel nutrient medium for isolation and cultivation of pathogens causing enteric yersiniosis and pseudotuberculosis].
AB  == a new nutrient medium for isolation and cultivation of the causative agents of enteric yersiniosis and pseudotuberculosis was found to have advantages over endo medium in its differentiating and inhibiting properties. this medium permitted the easy differentiation of yersinia pseudotuberculosis from y. enterocolitica, as well as from escherichia coli, shigella flexneri, klebsiella pneumoniae, k. rhinoscleromatis, hafnia, enterobacter and citrobacter by color; from proteus inconstans by swarming. in addition, weakly swarming of p. vulgaris differed by their light bluish color and pseudomonas aeruginosa, by the brilliance and size of colonies. endo medium could be used only for differentiation of e. coli from lactose-negative yersinia colonies, klebsiella (by mucous growth) and, to a certain extent, all proteus species (by swarming). the medium under test and the  control medium inhibited the growth of staphylococcus aureus. in contrast to endo medium, the medium under test partially inhibited the growth of k. rhinoscleromatis and the swarming of p. inconstans. the new medium is now introduced into practice.

TI  == infections in e-beta thalassemia.
AB  == infection is a major complication and the leading cause of death in thalassemia,  especially e-beta thalassemia. the spectrum of infections in e-beta thalassemia include mild and severe infections, therapy-related infections such as yersinia enterocolitica infection associated with desferrioxamine (dfo) therapy, and transfusion-transmitted disease, as well as unique infections such as with pythiosis. prospective studies in thailand indicate that patients with e-beta thalassemia had more frequent episodes of both mild and severe infections. the former included upper respiratory tract infection, acute gastroenteritis, cutaneous abscess, and gingivitis. severe infections occurred more commonly in patients with splenectomy and included septicemia, pneumonia, biliary tract infection, salmonellosis, and urinary tract infection. responsible organisms were escherichia coli (26%), klebsiella pneumoniae (23%), salmonella (15%), and streptococcus pneumoniae (13%). other organisms included pseudomonas, staphylococci, burkholderia pseudomallei (melioidosis), and aeromonas. patients undergoing dfo therapy are at risk for y. enterocolitica infection which may be localized to mesenteric nodes and tonsils or occur as a generalized form such as  septicemia. recently, we have seen a unique infection so-called vascular pythiosis. patients usually presented with clinical features of vascular occlusion of lower limbs from ascending arteritis and thrombosis. the causative organism, pythium insidiosum, is fungus-like, in the kingdom stramenopila, and in the class oomycetes. the mortality rate is high and the only effective treatment  has been early amputation or possibly immunotherapy. the predisposing factors of  infections in thalassemia include splenectomy, iron overload, anemia, and granulocyte dysfunctions. general management of infections in thalassemia consist of prevention, i.e., immunization with pneumococcal and hepatitis vaccines, oral  penicillins especially in patients with splenectomy, removal of predisposing factors such as gallstones, iron overload, and appropriate antibiotics.

TI  == leukocytoclastic vasculitis complicating klebsiella pneumoniae bacteremia.
AB  == a 79-year old woman, with a history of hypertension, presented with clinical features of congestive heart failure, fever, a purpuric rash, and left lower quadrant abdominal tenderness. contrast computed tomography scan of the abdomen showed features of acute diverticulitis, and blood culture was subsequently positive for klebsiella pneumoniae. histological examination of a biopsy of the rash confirmed a diagnosis of leukocytoclastic vasculitis (lcv). the bacteremia responded to intravenous amoxycillin/clavulanic acid and gentamicin and the rash  subsided. this case represents the first case of lcv complicating k. pneumoniae bacteremia in the english literature. the english literature on bacteria-associated lcv is reviewed. taking aside organisms such as rickettsia that cause endothelial invasion, the associated bacterial species tends to be subacute or chronic pathogens e.g. mycoplasma pneumoniae, mycobacterium tuberculosis, and yersinia enterocolitica; or the disease process is of a subacute or chronic nature e.g. endocarditis, bronchiectesis, and cystic fibrosis, leading to prolonged exposure to pathogens that apparently cause acute  pyogenic infections, such as k. pneumoniae.

TI  == biochemical sequence analyses of ges-1, a novel class a extended-spectrum beta-lactamase, and the class 1 integron in52 from klebsiella pneumoniae.
AB  == klebsiella pneumoniae ori-1 was isolated in 1998 in france from a rectal swab of  a 1-month-old girl who was previously hospitalized in cayenne hospital, cayenne,  french guiana. this strain harbored a ca. 140-kb nontransferable plasmid, ptk1, that conferred an extended-spectrum cephalosporin resistance profile antagonized  by the addition of clavulanic acid, tazobactam, or imipenem. the gene for ges-1 (guiana extended-spectrum beta-lactamase) was cloned, and its protein was expressed in escherichia coli dh10b, where this pi-5. 8 beta-lactamase of a ca. 31-kda molecular mass conferred resistance to oxyimino cephalosporins (mostly to  ceftazidime). ges-1 is weakly related to the other plasmid-located ambler class a extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls). the highest percentage of amino acid identity was obtained with the carbenicillinase gn79 from proteus mirabilis; with yent, a chromosome-borne penicillinase from yersinia enterocolitica; and with l-2, a chromosome-borne class a cephalosporinase from stenotrophomonas maltophilia (36% amino acid identity each). however, a dendrogram analysis showed that ges-1 clustered within a class a esbl subgroup together with esbls veb-1 and per-1. sequencing of a 7,098-bp dna fragment from plasmid ptk1 revealed that the  ges-1 gene was located on a novel class 1 integron named in52 that was characterized by (i) a 5' conserved segment containing an inti1 gene possessing two putative promoters, p(1) and p(2), for coordinated expression of the downstream antibiotic resistance genes and an atti1 recombination site; (ii) five antibiotic gene cassettes, bla(ges-1), aac(6')ib' (gentamicin resistance and amikacin susceptibility), dfrxvb (trimethoprim resistance), a novel chloramphenicol resistance gene (cmla4), and aada2 (streptomycin-spectinomycin resistance); and (iii) a 3' conserved segment consisting of qacedelta1 and suli.  the bla(ges-1) and aada2 gene cassettes were peculiar, since they lacked a typical 59-base element. this work identified the second class a esbl gene of a non-tem, non-shv series which was located in the plasmid and integron, thus providing it additional means for its spread and its expression.

TI  == cloning and sequencing of the gene that codes for the klebsiella pneumoniae groel-like protein associated with ankylosing spondylitis.
AB  == ankylosing spondylitis (as) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the sacroiliac joints and vertebral column of unknown aetiology, but strongly related to the presence of the hla-b27 antigen. the participation of bacterial infections as triggering factors have also been suggested. we have associated the 60 kda heat shock protein of klebsiella pneumoniae (hsp60kp) with as since we have previously demonstrated that most of the patients have igg antibodies and active t cells that recognize preferentially this protein, but we have not yet identified the epitopes involved in the recognition. in order to know the amino acid sequence of hsp60kp, and to be able to analyse in the future the relevant epitopes; we amplified by pcr and cloned the gene coding for this protein into the smai site of puc19. the nucleotide sequence of the gene was obtained by the sanger method using both manual and automatic techniques. amino acid sequence of the hsp60kp was deduced by translating the nucleotide sequence of the gene. the antigenic analysis of this sequence was compared to the antigenic analysis of the reported  sequences of escherichia coli groel and yersinia enterocolitica hsp60. using a software to predict hla class i motifs, the nonapeptide (krgidkavl) residues 117-125 of hsp60kp showed a much higher affinity for hla-b27 than the similar nonapeptide of e. coli groel and y. enterocolitica hsp60. the only difference between the three peptides was in position nine. this finding could explain the association of as only with the hsp60 of klebsiella pneumoniae. on the other hand, hydrophilicity analysis, which indicates b cell epitopes, showed three similar strongly antigenic regions in the three proteins.

TI  == dna shuffling of a family of genes from diverse species accelerates directed evolution.
AB  == dna shuffling is a powerful process for directed evolution, which generates diversity by recombination, combining useful mutations from individual genes. libraries of chimaeric genes can be generated by random fragmentation of a pool of related genes, followed by reassembly of the fragments in a self-priming polymerase reaction. template switching causes crossovers in areas of sequence homology. our previous studies used single genes and random point mutations as the source of diversity. an alternative source of diversity is naturally occurring homologous genes, which provide 'functional diversity'. to evaluate whether natural diversity could accelerate the evolution process, we compared the efficiency of obtaining moxalactamase activity from four cephalosporinase genes evolved separately with that from a mixed pool of the four genes. a single cycle  of shuffling yielded eightfold improvements from the four separately evolved genes, versus a 270- to 540-fold improvement from the four genes shuffled together, a 50-fold increase per cycle of shuffling. the best clone contained eight segments from three of the four genes as well as 33 amino-acid point mutations. molecular breeding by shuffling can efficiently mix sequences from different species, unlike traditional breeding techniques. the power of family shuffling may arise from sparse sampling of a larger portion of sequence space.

TI  == rfah and the ops element, components of a novel system controlling bacterial transcription elongation.
AB  == the rfah protein controls the transcription of a specialized group of escherichia coli and salmonella operons that direct the synthesis, assembly and export of the lipopolysaccharide core, exopolysaccharide, f conjugation pilus and haemolysin toxin. rfah is a specific regulator of transcript elongation; its loss increases  transcription polarity in these operons without affecting initiation from the operon promoters. the operons of the rfah-dependent regulon contain a short conserved 5' sequence, the ops element, deletion of which increases operon polarity to an extent similar to that caused by loss of rfah. the ops element is  also present upstream of polysaccharide gene clusters of shigella flexneri, yersinia enterocolitica, vibrio cholerae and klebsiella pneumoniae and the rp4 fertility operon of pseudomonas aeruginosa, suggesting that this is a widely spread control system. the mechanistic coupling of rfah and the ops element has been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo, and we suggest that the ops element recruits rfah and potentially other factors to the rna polymerase complex, modifying the complex to increase its processivity and allowing transcription to  proceed over long distances.

TI  == nested polymerase chain reaction strategy simultaneously targeting dna sequences  of multiple bacterial species in inflammatory joint diseases. ii. examination of  sacroiliac and knee joint biopsies of patients with spondyloarthropathies and other arthritides.
AB  == objective: bacteria play a crucial pathogenetic role in reactive arthritis (rea)  and other forms of spondyloarthropathy (spa) and in lyme arthritis. although there is evidence of local persistence of bacterial antigens no definitive method revealing microbes in peripheral joints has been established. we detected dna of  individual bacteria in synovial material by pcr. applying molecular technology we screened simultaneously for 8 bacterial genomes in arthritis and sacroiliitis. methods: sacroiliac (si) biopsy specimens taken from the si joint of 8 patients with ankylosing spondylitis (as, n = 5) and undifferentiated spa (uspa, n = 3) by computed tomography guided biopsy were investigated for presence of bacterial dna. similarly, synovial membrane samples obtained by office arthroscopy from 15  patients with rea (n = 5), uspa (n = 3), undifferentiated oligoarthritis (uoligo, n = 3), and rheumatoid arthritis (ra, n = 4) were screened. nested pcr was performed for dna of the following bacteria: chlamydia trachomatis, c. pneumoniae, yersinia enterocolitica, salmonella enteritidis, campylobacter jejuni, shigella flexneri, klebsiella pneumoniae, and borrelia burgdorferi. results: no bacterial dna was found in the si biopsies of patients with uspa and  as. dna of b. burgdorferi (n = 2) and c. trachomatis (n = 1) was detected in 3 patients with uoligo, but not in patients with rea or ra. dna of other microbes including k. pneumoniae was not found. patients' mean disease duration was 5.3 years (2 mo-8.4 yrs). conclusion: we found bacterial dna in peripheral joints of  patients with uoligo, while in patients with rea, as, and uspa no bacterial dna was detected in peripheral or si joints. the failure to detect bacterial dna in patients with spa suggests autoimmune mechanisms operate in later stages of disease.

AB  == objective: bacteria play a crucial pathogenetic role in lyme arthritis (la), reactive arthritis (rea), other forms of spondyloarthropathy (spa), and possibly  in undifferentiated oligoarthritis (uoligo). polymerase chain reaction (pcr) technology has been applied to detect bacterial dna of individual microbes in synovial fluid (sf) of patients with arthritides. we screened for dna sequences of 8 bacterial species simultaneously in sf of patients with inflammatory joint disease. methods: we examined 104 sf samples of 96 patients with rea (n = 13), undifferentiated spa (uspa, n = 10), uoligo (n = 50), juvenile chronic arthritis  (jca, n = 13), and rheumatoid arthritis (ra, n = 10). a nested pcr approach was developed to detect dna sequences of 8 bacteria: chlamydia trachomatis, c. pneumoniae, yersinia enterocolitica, salmonella enteritidis, campylobacter jejuni, shigella flexneri, klebsiella pneumoniae, and borrelia burgdorferi. the detection limit was determined at 10 bacterial/sample. serology and lymphocyte proliferation assay were done in parallel in most patients. results: in 12 cases  bacterial dna of b. burgdorferi (n = 7), c. trachomatis (n = 2), c. jejuni (n = 2), and c. pneumoniae (n = 1) was detected in patients with uoligo (n = 9) and jca (n = 3), while no evidence of bacterial dna was found in patients with rea, uspa, and ra. shigella flexneri dna was detected in 4 cases, but the significance of this finding remains uncertain due to the high sequence homology of this species with escherichia coli. dna of y. enterocolitica, s. enteritidis, or k. pneumoniae was not found. a positive serologic response was found in 7/9 pcr positive patients. in 11/96 cases antibodies to 2 or more bacteria were found in  parallel (11.5%). antigen specific lymphocyte proliferation was observed in 5/9 pcr positive patients. conclusion: bacterial dna was detected in peripheral joint of patients with uoligo and jca, but not in rea, uspa, or ra in this study. the detection of bacterial dna in synovial material by pcr technology gives useful diagnostic information, especially when antibodies against several microbes are present or antibodies are not detectable. failure to detect bacterial dna in patients with rea and uspa with longstanding disease suggests that in later stages autoimmune mechanisms may operate.

TI  == a bifunctional urease enhances survival of pathogenic yersinia enterocolitica and morganella morganii at low ph.
AB  == to infect a susceptible host, the gastrointestinal pathogen yersinia enterocolitica must survive passage through the acid environment of the stomach.  in this study, we showed that y. enterocolitica serotype o8 survives buffered acidic conditions as low as ph 1.5 for long periods of time provided urea is available. acid tolerance required an unusual cytoplasmically located urease that was activated 780-fold by low-ph conditions. acid tolerance of helicobacter species has also been attributed to urease activity, but in that case urease was  not specifically activated by low-ph conditions. a ure mutant strain of y. enterocolitica was constructed which was hypersensitive to acidic conditions when urea was available and, unlike the parental strain, was unable to grow when urea  was the sole nitrogen source. examination of other urease-producing gram-negative bacteria indicated that morganella morganii survives in acidic conditions but escherichia coli 1021, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, providencia stuartii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa do not. consistent with these results, biochemical evidence demonstrated that y. enterocolitica and m. morganii ureases  were activated in vitro by low ph with an unusually low activity optimum of ph 5.5. in whole cells activation occurred as medium values decreased below ph 3.0 for y. enterocolitica and ph 5.5 for m. morganii, suggesting that in vivo activation occurs as a result of cytoplasmic acidification. dna sequence analysis of portions of the m. morganii ure locus showed that the predicted primary structure of the enzyme structural subunits is most similar to those of y. enterocolitica urease. one region of similarity between these two ureases located near the active site is distinct from most other ureases but is present in the urease of lactobacillus fermentum. this region of similarity may be responsible for the unique properties of the y. enterocolitica and m. morganii ureases since  the l. fermentum urease also has been shown to have a low ph optimum for activity.

TI  == phylogenetic tree and sequence similarity of beta-lactamases.
AB  == beta-lactamases are the main cause of beta-lactam resistance in many pathogenic bacteria. these enzymes can be detected in a variety of pathogenic as well as non-pathogenic bacteria. the cyanobacteria are also known to produce a beta-lactamase. recently, the amino acid sequences and the three-dimensional structures of some of these beta-lactamases have been clarified. on the basis of  the amino acid sequences of 47 beta-lactamases and the computer-aided analysis, a phylogenetic tree is proposed in this paper. according to the tree, beta-lactamases are classified into six groups. group 1 beta-lactamases are mainly composed of plasmid-mediated enzymes from gram-negative bacteria. however, chromosome-derived beta-lactamases from klebsiella pneumoniae and rhodopseudomonas capsulata take part in this group. group 2 enzymes consist of a  part of the chromosome-encoded beta-lactamases from streptomyces, and chromosome-mediated enzymes from yersinia enterocolitica, citrobacter diversus, and klebsiella oxytoca. chromosome-encoded beta-lactamases from gram-negative bacteria form group 3. group 4 is composed of metalloenzymes, whereas group 5 consists of oxa type beta-lactamases. chromosome-encoded beta-lactamases from gram-positive bacteria form group 6. comparison of the amino acid sequences among these groups confirmed the phylogenetic tree and the classification: the beta-lactamases in each group have its particular conserved amino acid sequences. in addition, the tree provides more detailed classification and time-scale mutual relationships and predicts new types of beta-lactamases that may be found. furthermore, the classification deduced from the tree is generally in accord with the one based on the amino acid sequences reported previously. however, the class a beta-lactamases are clearly divided into three groups: groups 1, 2, and 6. rdf2 analysis shows that some combinations between beta-lactamases and beta-lactam-interacting proteins as well as eukaryotic proteins have a low but significant evolutionary relatedness.

AB  == biogenesis of the toxin-coregulated pilus (tcp) of vibrio cholerae 01 is essential for successful bacterial colonization of the small intestine. pilus assembly requires the products of at least seven genes located on the chromosome  adjacent to the pilin-encoding gene, tcpa. previously reported tnphoa insertions  in the tcp-assembly-deficient v. cholerae strains, kp2.21 and kp4.2, were isolated from the chromosome for further analysis. nucleotide sequencing of the tcpe::phoa and tcpf::phoa fusions and corresponding clones of the region containing the intact genes revealed the presence of two open reading frames (orfs) of 340 and 338 amino acids, designated tcpe and tcpf, respectively. the partial sequence of an orf downstream from the tcpf coding sequence was determined to correspond to the global virulence regulator, toxt. proteins corresponding to the observed orfs were visualized with the t7 promoter/rna polymerase expression system. computer-generated alignment algorithms predict that a homology exists between tcpe and the klebsiella pneumoniae pullulanase secretion proteins puld and pulf, the xanthomonas campestris extracellular enzyme secretion factor xpsf, the bacillus subtilis dna competence protein comg-orf2, and the yersinia enterocolitica yop secretion determinant yscc. these observations provide a model to investigate further the relationship between the  secretion mechanisms utilized by these seemingly diverse virulence determinants.  additionally, an extreme c-terminal segment of tcpe shows striking homology to the transmembrane segment of the eukaryotic integrin beta-1 chain, which could imply a role for tcpe in not only tcp secretion, but also host cell interaction.

TI  == mxid, an outer membrane protein necessary for the secretion of the shigella flexneri lpa invasins.
AB  == the invasive phenotype of shigella flexneri is conferred by a 220 kb virulence plasmid, pwr100, that encodes both the lpa proteins, which are involved in the entry process, and factors which are required for the export and correct localization of the lpa proteins. we have characterized the mxid gene, whose expression, like that of the ipa operon, is regulated by temperature. after inactivation of mxid, the mutant strain was unable to invade hela cells and to provoke keratoconjunctivitis in guinea-pigs. analysis of culture supernatants indicated that wild-type s. flexneri secretes about nine polypeptides and that secretion of several of these, including lpaa, lpab, and lpac, is abolished in the mxid mutant. examination of the membrane proteins of the wild-type and mxid strains suggested that mxid is an outer membrane protein. amino acid sequence comparison revealed that mxid is homologous to the yscc protein of yersinia enterocolitica and to the c-terminal region of the puld protein of klebsiella pneumoniae. both yscc and puld are involved in extracellular protein secretion. these results indicate that mxid is an essential component of the lpa secretion apparatus.

TI  == comparative antimicrobial activity of lomefloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and enoxacin against > 500 bacterial isolates.
AB  == an agar dilution technique was used to compare the antimicrobial activities of lomefloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and enoxacin against 544 strains of bacterial isolates. among the five quinolone agents tested, ciprofloxacin was the most active. enoxacin was the most active after ciprofloxacin against escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, proteus mirabilis, shigella spp., yersinia enterocolitica, and haemophilus influenzae with an mic90 of < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml. ofloxacin was the most active agent after ciprofloxacin against klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter diversus, and legionella pneumophila with an mic of < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml. ciprofloxacin inhibited staphylococcus spp. and streptococcus spp., at < or = 0.5 micrograms/ml and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. norfloxacin  and enoxacin had the same antimicrobial activity (mic90) against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae and some other gram-positive species, but these activities were weak when compared with ciprofloxacin. the results of this in vitro study show that ciprofloxacin is very active against gram-negative and gram-positive species.

TI  == antibacterial spectrum of lactoferricin b, a potent bactericidal peptide derived  from the n-terminal region of bovine lactoferrin.
AB  == a physiologically diverse range of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria was found to be susceptible to inhibition and inactivation by lactoferricin b, a peptide produced by gastric pepsin digestion of bovine lactoferrin. the list of susceptible organisms includes escherichia coli, salmonella enteritidis, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris, yersinia enterocolitica, pseudomonas aeruginosa, campylobacter jejuni, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus mutans, corynebacterium diphtheriae, listeria monocytogenes and clostridium perfringens.  concentrations of lactoferricin b required to cause complete inhibition of growth varied within the range of 0.3 to 150 micrograms/ml, depending on the strain and  the culture medium used. the peptide showed activity against e. coli o111 over the range of ph 5.5 to 7.5 and was most effective under slightly alkaline conditions. its antibacterial effectiveness was reduced in the presence of na+, k+, mg2+ or ca2+ ions, or in the presence of various buffer salts. lactoferricin  b was lethal, causing a rapid loss of colony-forming capability in most of the species tested. pseudomonas fluorescens, enterococcus faecalis and bifidobacterium bifidum strains were highly resistant to this peptide.

TI  == molecular mimickry between hla b27 and yersinia, salmonella, shigella and klebsiella within the same region of hla alpha 1-helix.
AB  == two new examples of amino acid homology between hla b27 and microbes triggering hla b27-associated diseases are described. an outer membrane protein yada (yersinia adhesin, previously called yop1) of yersinia enterocolitica and y. pseudotuberculosis shares a linear tetrapeptide with hla b27. a cationic outer membrane protein omph of salmonella typhimurium shares homology with five amino acids of hla b27 in a non-linear fashion. the four amino acids of yada are also notably included in the hexapeptide identical between klebsiella pneumoniae nitrogenase and hla b27, and three of them occur in the pentapeptide shared by a  shigella flexneri protein and hla b27. antibodies against synthetic peptides including hla b27 homologues sequences of yada and omph were observed in one-third of the patients with hla b27 associated diseases. antibodies were directed against a flanking sequence next to the amino acid sequences shared by arthritis-triggering microbes and hla b27. the area of identity in each example of this molecular mimicry (yersinia, salmonella, shigella and klebsiella) is located in the same place on the hla b27 molecule: between amino acids 70 to 78 in the variable region of alpha 1-helix. this area of hla b27 molecule includes sites predicted to be important for binding processed antigens.

TI  == analysis of virc, an operon involved in the secretion of yop proteins by yersinia enterocolitica.
AB  == upon incubation at 37 degrees c in the absence of ca2+ ions, pathogenic yersiniae release large amounts of pyv plasmid-encoded proteins called yops that are involved in pathogenesis. yersinia enterocolitica also expresses an outer membrane protein that is considered an adhesin and called yada (previously called p1 or yopa). the production of yops is coordinately regulated by a 20-kb region of the plasmid referred to as the ca2+ dependence region and containing at least  four loci called vira, virb, virc, and virf. the virf gene encodes a key transcriptional activator of yop genes. we have shown here that virf is also required for transcription of yada and that virb is necessary for full transcription of the yop and yada genes. in contrast, mutations in genes vira and virc had only a weak influence on the transcription of yop and yada genes. these  mutations did not affect the production of yada but they completely inhibited the translocation of yops from the intracellular compartment to the extracellular milieu. we inferred from these data that vira and virc are involved in the specific transport of yops. we analyzed the 8.5-kb virc region and showed that it is most probably a single operon containing 13 open reading frames called ysca to yscm (for yop secretion). protein yscc has a putative signal sequence and shares  significant homology with outer membrane proteins involved in the secretion of pullulanase by klebsiella pneumoniae (puld) or in the assembly of filamentous bacteriophages (gene iv product). at least the putative products of yscd, yscj, and yscl were shown to be required for the export of yops. yscj turned out to be  ylpb, a lipoprotein that we had detected previously. the yscm gene shares homology with yoph, the adjacent gene on the pyv plasmid. its product does not appear to be necessary for the production of yops. transcription of the virc operon was subjected to the same regulation as the yop genes.

TI  == production and characterization of a monoclonal antibody specific for enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli of serotypes o157:h7 and o26:h11.
AB  == a monoclonal antibody (mab 4e8c12) specific for escherichia coli o157:h7 and o26:h11 was produced by immunizing balb/c mice with a rough strain of e. coli o157:h7. the antibody reacted strongly by a direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with each of 36 strains of e. coli o157:h7. no cross-reactivity was observed with strains of salmonella spp., yersinia enterocolitica, shigella dysenteriae, proteus spp., escherichia hermanii, klebsiella pneumoniae, campylobacter jejuni, serratia marcescens, citrobacter spp., enterobacter cloacae, hafnia alvei, aeromonas hydrophila, and all except five strains of e. coli other than serotype o157:h7 (including strains of serotype o157 but not h7). the e. coli strains (all of serotype o26:h11) that reacted with the antibody were enterohemorrhagic e. coli (ehec) that were isolated from patients with hemolytic  uremic syndrome or hemorrhagic colitis and produced verotoxin similar to that of  e. coli o157:h7. mab 4e8c12 belongs to the subclass immunoglobulin g2a and has a  kappa light chain. tricine-sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of outer membrane proteins of e. coli of different serotypes followed by western immunoblot analysis revealed that mab 4e8c12 reacted specifically with two proteins of ehec strains of serotypes o157:h7 and o26:h11 with apparent molecular weights of 5,000 to 6,000. these proteins appeared to be  markers specific for ehec strains of serotypes o157:h7 and o26:h11. this mab, because of its specificity, may be a useful reagent of an immunoassay for the rapid detection of these types of ehec isolates in clinical and food specimens.

TI  == [value of microbiologic studies for diagnosis of post-enteritis reactive arthritis].
AB  == reactive arthritis may develop within a period of some days until upto 3 weeks after infections with yersinia enterocolitica, yersinia pseudotuberculosis, campylobacter jejuni/coli, shigella and salmonella. intestinal infections with klebsiella pneumoniae, clostridium perfringens, clostridium difficile, cryptosporidium, strongyloides stercoralis, taenia saginata and schistosoma mansoni are, in some cases, considered to be responsible for reactive arthritis.  detection of pathogenic bacteria in feces is generally most successful in the early stage of the infection. a large spectrum of special tests is required in order to detect all the causative agents and to ensure reliable results. it is therefore necessary that the laboratory is provided with information about the diagnostic object and the tentative diagnosis. the detection of serum antibodies  to y. enterocolitica, y. pseudotuberculosis, c. jejuni/coli, and schistosoma may  suggest connections between infection and reactive arthritis.

TI  == hemolysin as a marker for serratia.
AB  == all serratia marcescens strains (total of 33) of different sources were hemolytic including clinical strains previously classified as being nonhemolytic. dna fragments of the two hemolysin genes hybridized with the chromosomal dna of s. marcescens, s. liquefaciens, s. kiliensis, s. grimesii, s. proteamaculans, s. plymutica, s. rubridaea which were also hemolytic. the restriction pattern of the hemolysin locus differed in each strain. s. ficaria and s. marinorubra expressed  a different hemolysin which was much smaller than the s. marcescens hemolysin since it diffused through dialysis membranes. the dna of the latter strains did not hybridize with the s. marcescens hemolysin dna probes. some s. marcescens strains, s. kiliensis and s. liquefaciens also expressed in addition the small hemolysin. no hybridization was found with dna of escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella arerogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, shigella dysenteriae, yersinia enterocolitica, yersinia pseudotuberculosus, listeria sp.,  aeromonas sp., legionella sp. and a meninococcus sp., indicating that the hemolysin dna probes are specific for serratia, or that the hemolysin genes occur rarely in genera other than serratia.

AB  == the polyclonal b cell activation (pba) process induced by klebsiella pneumoniae k34 (klebs) and yersinia enterocolitica 03 (yers) was investigated. both heat-inactivated bacteria and their cell wall biostructures (klebsm, muriene, protein i etc.) stimulate human blood b cells to differentiate into immunoglobulin-secreting cells without prior proliferation and without t cells. klebs-activated b cells secrete mainly igm and to a lesser degree igg (mainly igg2). the pba process was regulated by cd4+ cells and monocytes, but not by cd8+ cells. while interleukin 2 is able both to induce proliferation and to enhance differentiation in klebs-activated b cell cultures, the low-molecular-weight b cell growth factor (bcgf) did not lead to a significant amount of 3h-thymidine uptake. in addition, in klebs-activated b cell cultures various anti-polynucleotide autoantibodies and the 16/6 idiotype were detectable. thus, bacteria that induce nonsuppurative sequelae (e.g. klebs, yers) can use several mechanisms to overcome tolerance in their host.

TI  == survival of coliforms and bacterial pathogens within protozoa during chlorination.
AB  == the susceptibility of coliform bacteria and bacterial pathogens to free chlorine  residuals was determined before and after incubation with amoebae and ciliate protozoa. viability of bacteria was quantified to determine their resistance to free chlorine residuals when ingested by laboratory strains of acanthamoeba castellanii and tetrahymena pyriformis. cocultures of bacteria and protozoa were  incubated to facilitate ingestion of the bacteria and then were chlorinated, neutralized, and sonicated to release intracellular bacteria. qualitative susceptibility of protozoan strains to free chlorine was also assessed. protozoa  were shown to survive and grow after exposure to levels of free chlorine residuals that killed free-living bacteria. ingested coliforms escherichia coli,  citrobacter freundii, enterobacter agglomerans, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella  pneumoniae, and klebsiella oxytoca and bacterial pathogens salmonella typhimurium, yersinia enterocolitica, shigella sonnei, legionella gormanii, and campylobacter jejuni had increased resistance to free chlorine residuals. bacteria could be cultured from within treated protozoans well after the time required for 99% inactivation of free-living cells. all bacterial pathogens were  greater than 50-fold more resistant to free chlorine when ingested by t. pyriformis. escherichia coli ingested by a cyclidium sp., a ciliate isolated from a drinking water reservoir, were also shown to be more resistant to free chlorine. the mechanism that increased resistance appeared to be survival within  protozoan cells. this study indicates that bacteria can survive ingestion by protozoa. this bacterium-protozoan association provides bacteria with increased resistance to free chlorine residuals which can lead to persistence of bacteria in chlorine-treated water. we propose that resistance to digestion by predatory protozoa was an evolutionary precursor of pathogenicity in bacteria and that today it is a mechanism for survival of fastidious bacteria in dilute and inhospitable aquatic environments.

AB  == the aetiology of ankylosing spondylitis (as) may involve certain enterobacteria.  it is therefore interesting that serum polymeric iga, a precursor of secretory iga, was statistically elevated in active as (n = 35) and that levels were comparable to those found in yersiniosis (n = 12); this might indicate antigenic  stimulation by bacteria which are present in the intestines of as patients. however, specific serum iga to the incriminated enterobacteria klebsiella, shigella and yersinia, as determined by elisa, was not raised in the above as patients. nor were these titres raised in patients with idiopathic reactive arthritis (n = 21). in contrast, yersiniosis (n = 12) and shigellosis (n = 96) patients displayed marked increases in specific serum iga titres to the respective infectants. it is proposed that as may involve a set of enterobacteria rather than a few suspected species. thus, despite the lack of raised group averages, screening of individual patients for specific iga to several indicated  bacteria might disclose whether or not raised serum iga is related to enterobacterial activity. apart from this, the above supports other reports indicating that serum iga may be a useful parameter to assist in monitoring of disease activity in as. finally, it is suggested that study of a homogeneous group of reactive arthritis patients might facilitate aetiological research of seronegative arthropathies such as as.

AB  == the antibacterial effects produced by ticarcillin disodium plus clavulanate potassium, a combination of the broad-spectrum penicillin ticarcillin, and the beta-lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid as the potassium salt, have been measured in vitro and in experimental infection studies. the presence of clavulanic acid resulted in a significant enhancement of the activity of ticarcillin against a wide range of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria. these included ticarcillin-resistant strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, p. vulgaris, yersinia enterocolitica, and the anaerobe bacteroides fragilis. in addition, beta-lactamase-producing isolates of  hemophilus influenzae, branhamella catarrhalis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and staphylococcus aureus were susceptible to ticarcillin and clavulanate. clavulanic acid did not influence the activity of ticarcillin against ticarcillin-susceptible bacteria. the bactericidal effects of the antibiotic combination were measured in an in vitro kinetic model in which the drug concentrations were varied to simulate those measured in humans after intravenous dosing with ticarcillin (3.0 g) and clavulanate potassium (100 mg clavulanic acid). in these tests, ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid had pronounced bactericidal activity against ticarcillin-resistant bacteria. the protection of ticarcillin by clavulanic acid from inactivation by bacterial beta-lactamases in  vivo was demonstrated in experimental infection models in which the efficacy of the ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid combination against infections caused by beta-lactamase-producing bacteria was correlated with the presence of effective concentrations of both antibiotic and inhibitor at the site of infection.

TI  == pathogenesis of yersinia-triggered reactive arthritis: immunological, microbiological and clinical aspects.
AB  == when a patient develops reactive arthritis after yersinia enteritis, the following conditions are often fulfilled: the patient is hla-b27-positive; however, some b27-negative individuals develop severe arthritis and some positives do not, in the initial phase, the diarrhea is milder, the anti-yersinia antibody response of igg class is more vigorous and persists longer, the anti-yersinia antibody response of iga class is more vigorous and persists much longer, the anti-yersinia antibodies of iga1 and iga2 subclass, those with j-chain and, especially, those with secretory piece are produced more vigorously, indicating local immunostimulation close to the intestinal epithelium, in the early phase, yersinia-igm immune complexes are found in the circulation, and the  lymphocyte transformation response against not only yersinia but also against other gram-negative enteric bacteria is weaker. when all these aspects are considered together a strong suspicion arises that the patients who are destined  to develop reactive arthritis fail in their first line of defense against the invading organism when contracting a yersinia enteritis. this may lead to persistence of the microorganism within the body, e.g., in the intestinal epithelium or in the mesenteric lymphoid tissues, maintaining a stimulus for a prolonged--apparently futile and perhaps harmful--antibody production. finally, the initiating and decisive factor should not be forgotten: the yersinia. why and how it triggers the process is at present one of the enigmas of the pathogenesis  of reactive arthritis.

AB  == in 2 cases of rea seen during the acute phase and shown serologically to be due to y. enterocolitica 0:3, the lt test showed a marked response using as antigen a freeze dried preparation of the causative organism. the test result correlated with the activity of the disease when repeated during a flare in the 1st case, and during remission in both. patients with rea/rs in general showed a significantly higher response to the yersinia and klebsiella antigens tested when compared to as, suggesting an overall difference in cell-mediated immunity to these enteric bacteria. as cases reacted significantly less than controls to k. pneumoniae under suboptimal conditions. k. pneumoniae was shown to enhance the lt response to yersinia, possibly through an adjuvant effect. this was found with as, rea and in controls, though whether it is of relevance in the etiopathogenesis of as or rea/rs remains far from clear. acute non-traumatic synovitis of the knee, occurring de novo, or in association with psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease, or as part of rs, may be accompanied by evidence of heightened reactivity to streptococci both by blood and synovial fluid mononuclear cells. in 1 case with serological evidence of streptococcal infection and erythema nodosum, these changes were found to parallel disease activity. rea  can, it appears, follow recent streptococcal infection, and be associated with b27.

TI  == a heat-modifiable outer membrane protein carries an antigen specific for the species yersinia enterocolitica and yersinia pseudotuberculosis.
AB  == the outer membranes of gram-negative bacteria are considered to be of importance  in host-bacteria interaction, in protective immunity, and occasionally in subclassification within a species. in this study, the outer membranes of several strains of yersinia enterocolitica and y. pseudotuberculosis were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page). it was found that the appearance of the major proteins depended on the temperature at which they were solubilized in sds. a protein was identified with the use of two-dimensional gels and preparative sds-page, which was equivalent to the "heat-modifiable protein" (protein ii) of other enterobacteriaceae species. a monoclonal antibody, 4g1, was generated against an isolated preparation of this y. enterocolitica protein. this antibody was tested with whole cell bacterial antigens of 46 individual bacterial strains. the reactive strains included only y. enterocolitica and y. pseudotuberculosis. in addition, the reactivity of the 4g1 monoclonal antibody preparation could be absorbed only with y. enterocolitica and y. pseudotuberculosis, and not with other strains of bacteria. the reactivity of this 4g1 monoclonal antibody was also tested by the western blot technique. six individual strains were tested: a y. enterocolitica serotype 0:3, a y. enterocolitica serotype 0:9, an escherichia coli, a salmonella typhimurium, a shigella flexneri, and a klebsiella pneumoniae. the 4g1 antibody reacted with only the proteins of the two y. enterocolitica strains. in conclusion, the equivalent of the heat-modifiable protein was present in y. enterocolitica and y. pseudotuberculosis. moreover, this protein also carried a species-specific antigenic determinant.

TI  == lymphocyte proliferative responses to bacterial antigens in b27-associated arthropathies.
AB  == lymphocyte transformation tests to yersinia enterocolitica 0:3 and 0:6, klebsiella pneumoniae and streptococcus faecalis antigens have been carried out in ankylosing spondylitis, reactive arthritis/reiter's disease and controls. ankylosing spondylitis cases gave significantly lower responses than reactive arthritis/reiter's to yersinia enterocolitica 0:6 (p = 0.003) and klebsiella pneumoniae (p = 0.008), and less than controls to s. faecalis (p = 0.008). it appears, therefore, that within the b27 arthritis population there is heterogeneity of cell-mediated response to certain enteric bacteria, with the hyporesponders manifesting ankylosing spondylitis and the hyper-responders reactive arthritis/reiter's disease.

TI  == susceptibility of chemostat-grown yersinia enterocolitica and klebsiella pneumoniae to chlorine dioxide.
AB  == the resistance of bacteria to antimicrobial agents could be influenced by growth  environment. the susceptibility of two enteric bacteria, yersinia enterocolitica  and klebsiella pneumoniae, to chlorine dioxide was investigated. these organisms  were grown in a defined medium in a chemostat and the influence of growth rate, temperature, and cell density on the susceptibility was studied. all inactivation experiments were conducted with a dose of 0.25 mg of chlorine dioxide per liter in phosphate-buffered saline at ph 7.0 and 23 degrees c. the results indicated that populations grown under conditions that more closely approximate natural aquatic environments, e.g., low temperatures and growth at submaximal rates caused by nutrient limitation, were most resistant. the conclusion from this study is that antecedent growth conditions have a profound effect on the susceptibility of bacteria to disinfectants, and it is more appropriate to use the chemostat-grown bacteria as test organisms to evaluate the efficacy of a certain disinfectant.

TI  == toxins which activate guanylate cyclase: heat-stable enterotoxins.
AB  == certain enteropathogenic bacteria, including strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and yersinia enterocolitica, elicit their diarrhoeagenic effects by elaborating small molecular weight, heat-stable enterotoxins (sts). structural and functional characteristics indicate that st peptides are heterogeneous and two major subtypes, sta and stb, have been identified. molecules of sta, unlike those of stb, are methanol-soluble and elicit their pathogenic effects by activating host cell guanylate cyclase activity and thereby increasing tissue cyclic gmp content: this increase in cyclic gmp causes fluid secretion. sta binds to specific proteinaceous receptors on intestinal cells but  the nature of sta-receptor coupling to guanylate cyclase is poorly understood. the actions of sta, including binding to its receptor, activation of guanylate cyclase and stimulation of electrolyte transport, are rapid, reversible and tissue-specific. sta activates only particulate and not soluble guanylate cyclase. it alters the vmax but not the apparent km of this enzyme for mg-gtp or  mn-gtp. at concentrations above 0.5-1 mm, calcium inhibits the sta activation of  guanylate cyclase. the effects of calmodulin antagonists such as chlorpromazine on the activation of guanylate cyclase by sta are less clear. inhibitors of phospholipid and arachidonic acid cascade pathways interfere with both basal and  sta-stimulated guanylate cyclase. membrane integrity is essential for sta activation of guanylate cyclase and the sta-receptor complex may activate the enzyme by intramembrane protein-protein interactions and/or perturbations. interference with membrane phospholipid could alter such coupling.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of mt-141, a new semisynthetic cephamycin, compared with those of five cephalosporins.
AB  == the in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of mt-141 were compared with those of cefoxitin, cefmetazole, moxalactam, cefotaxime, and cefoperazone. the mics of mt-141 for 90% of bacterial isolates were lower than the reference drugs  against clinical isolates of campylobacter jejuni, clostridium difficile, and bacteroides fragilis, whereas against clinical isolates of other gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic bacteria, the mics of mt-141 were similar to or higher than those of the reference drugs. in contrast, the bactericidal activity  of mt-141 after 6- and 24-h exposures was superior to all of the reference drugs  against 9 to 10 of the 12 bacterial strains studied, including escherichia coli,  klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella enteritidis, indol-positive proteus species, serratia marcescens, yersinia enterocolitica, pseudomonas cepacia, and clostridium perfringens. in the treatment of systemic infections in mice, mt-141  was again superior against 9 of the 12 strains tested, showing a good correlation with the bactericidal activity. it was found that the 50% effective doses of the  six cephalosporins studied correlated better with the mbcs than with the mics. as the serum levels of mt-141 in mice after subcutaneous administration were similar to those of the reference drugs, it was concluded that the bactericidal activity  of mt-141 was a dominant factor in its in vivo activity.

TI  == bacteria associated with crabs from cold waters with emphasis on the occurrence of potential human pathogens.
AB  == a diverse array of bacterial species, including several potential human pathogens, was isolated from edible crabs collected in cold waters. crabs collected near kodiak island, alaska, contained higher levels of bacteria than crabs collected away from regions of human habitation. the bacteria associated with the crabs collected near kodiak included yersinia enterocolitica, klebsiella pneumoniae, and coagulase-negative staphylococcus species; the pathogenicity of these isolates was demonstrated in mice. although coliforms were not found, the bacterial species associated with the tissues of crabs collected near kodiak indicate possible fecal contamination that may have occurred through contact with sewage. compared with surrounding waters and sediments, the crab tissues contained much higher proportions of gram-positive cocci. as revealed by indirect plate counts and direct scanning electron microscopic observations, muscle and hemolymph tissues contained much lower levels of bacteria than shell and gill tissues. after the death of a crab, however, the numbers of bacteria associated with hemolymph and muscle tissues increased significantly. microcosm studies showed that certain bacterial populations, e.g., vibrio cholerae, can be bioaccumulated in crab gill tissues. the results of this study indicate the need  for careful review of waste disposal practices where edible crabs may be contaminated with microorganisms that are potential human pathogens and the need  for surveillance of shellfish for pathogenic microorganisms that naturally occur  in marine ecosystems.

AB  == total serum immunoglobulins and class specific serum antibodies to klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella typhimurium, yersinia enterocolitica and pseudomonas aeruginosa were measured in 107 patients with ankylosing spondylitis (as) and 110 healthy tissue typed controls by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). the specificity of this technique was confirmed by the use of specific bacterial murine antisera and by cross-absorption of human sera by specific bacteria. total serum iga in as patients correlated with both erythrocyte sedimentation rate (esr) (p less than 0.001) and c-reactive protein (p less than 0.05) and was significantly elevated compared to healthy individuals (p less than 0.001). a significant elevation of iga antibodies to k. pneumoniae was detected in the serum of as patients with active disease when compared to healthy controls (p less than 0.01). these studies support the involvement of an enterobacterial micro-organism in the pathogenesis of as and further relate to the role of hla-b27 in this disease.

TI  == in vitro lymphoproliferative response to yersinia: depressed response in arthritic patients years after yersinia infection.
AB  == the persistence of lymphocyte transformation response to yersinia was studied three to six years after yersinia infection in subjects who had or had not suffered from reactive arthritis. in persons who had had arthritis, significantly weaker response to yersinia was found than in those who had recovered without developing arthritis. the same held true also for the response to klebsiella. these results support and extend our earlier observations of a depressed lymphocyte transformation response to yersinia during the course of yersinia arthritis. this phenomenon may be linked to the individual's susceptibility to arthritic complications after yersinia infection.

TI  == comparison of two methods for same-day identification of enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == two commercial methods, api 20e (as modified for same-day enterobacterial identification) and micro-id, were evaluated for ability to provide useful same-day information of 368 clinically isolated enterobacteriaceae. organisms included escherichia coli (54), shigella (7), edwardsiella tarda (1), salmonella  enteritidis (10), citrobacter (30), klebsiella (55), enterobacter (68), hafnia alvei (2), serratia (33), proteus (64), morganella morganii (24), providencia (18), and yersinia enterocolitica (2). methods were those of manufacturers without supplemental tests. api at five hours identified 78.5% of strains to species, 9.5% to genus only, 10.1% as part of a spectrum of identifications (si), and 1.9% incorrect. micro-id at four hours yielded 90.0% correct identification to species and 3.3% to genus only, 4.0% si, and 2.7% incorrect. api identification of many serratia, citrobacter, providencia strains was to genus only; most incorrect results occurred in serratia marcescens. micro-id identified most organisms to species; incorrect identifications were mainly s. marcescens and klebsiella pneumoniae. both systems provided excellent identification of e. coli. both methods sacrifice a degree of accuracy that varies with the species tested, as compared to overnight systems, but both provide rapid information of potential clinical value.

TI  == comparative activity of cefotaxime and selected beta-lactam antibiotics against haemophilus influenzae and aerobic gram-negative bacilli.
AB  == the activity of cefotaxime was compared with that of ampicillin, moxalactam, and  cefoperozone against 50 isolates of haemophilus influenzae and with that of ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalothin, cefoxitin, cefamandole, cefazolin, and several other established and investigational beta-lactam antibiotics against several hundred isolates of gram-negative aerobic enteric bacilli. minimal inhibitory concentrations of the drugs were determined by the agar plate dilution technique for h. influenzae and by the microtiter broth dilution technique for the other pathogens. cefotaxime was the most active agent against h. influenzae;  it was 20 times more active than ampicillin. it was also the most active agent against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, nontyphoid salmonella species, and yersinia enterocolitica. cefotaxime was among the most active agents against  enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter species, shigella species, proteus mirabilis, and acinetobacter calcoaceticus. none of the new cephalosporins or penicillin inhibited greater than 90% of the isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa at concentrations of less than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml; these drugs were, however, more active than carbenicillin.

TI  == rapid isolation of yersinia spp. from feces.
AB  == direct plating or cold enrichment or both have been used to isolate yersinia spp. from feces. freeze-shock double enrichment and koh treatment have been recommended for recovery of yersinia enterocolitica from surface waters and food, respectively. these techniques were evaluated as alternatives for rapid recovery  of yersinia spp. from feces. stool samples were homogenized in buffered saline and autoclaved. escherichia coli. klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were each added to the suspension at a final concentration of 1.5 x 10(6) colony-forming units per ml. yersinia cells were then added to a final concentration of 1.5 x 10(3), 1.5 x 10(4), 1.5 x 10(5), or 1.5 x 10(6) colony-forming units per ml. a total of 21 strains of y. enterocolitica, 2 of yersinia kristensenii, and 1 each of yersinia intermedia and yersinia fredriksenii were tested. for freeze-shock double enrichment, seeded stool samples were frozen overnight (-70 degrees c), transferred successively to m-tetrathionate broth (6 h. 37 degrees c) and selenite broth (2 h 37 degrees c),  and plated on macconkey, salmonella-shigella, and cellobiose-arginine-lysine agars for quantitation. for koh treatment, seeded stool samples were mixed with 0.5% koh at a ratio of 1:2 for 2 min and plated as described above. e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and p. aeruginosa were virtually eliminated after either method was used. all yersinia strains were recovered after koh treatment even at the lowest  initial concentration (1.5 x 10(3) colony-forming units per ml). however, after freeze-shock double enrichment, not all strains were retrievable, and those isolates which were recovered were grown only from samples containing the highest number of yersinia strains (1.5 x 10(6) colony-forming units per ml). koh treatment of stool samples seems to be a viable substitute for more protracted methods of recovering yersinia spp.

TI  == diffusion-in-gel enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (dig-elisa): optimal conditions for quantitation of antibodies.
AB  == in the diffusion-in-gel enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (dig-elisa) the quantitation of antibodies is based on their ability to form a diffusion gradient over an antigen-coated polystyrene surface. the antigen-antibody reaction is then visualized by an enzyme-conjugated anti-immunoglobulin. the enzyme-substrate reaction is finally performed by pouring a substrate-containing gel over the polystyrene surface. in this study with bovine serum albumin as antigen and a corresponding rabbit antiserum, the diffusion time of antiserum was shown to be the most critical variable of the method, while the antigen concentration used for coating, the conjugate binding time and the enzyme-substrate reaction time had a minor influence on the quantitation of antibodies. high antibody levels were measured with greater accuracy than low levels, but the standard deviation was below 10%. it was also shown that different sera containing antibodies to salmonella typhi o lps, klebsiella pneumoniae k1 and o4 lps, escherichia coli o2  lps, yersinia enterocolitica y3 lps, cardiolipin and pneumococcus could be quantitated with the same accuracy.

TI  == [characteristics and function of enterotoxins of gram negative bacteria (author's transl)].
AB  == several factors are important for the pathogenesis of bacterial intestinal disease: 1. colonisation of the intestine; 2. exo(= entero)toxin production without penetration into the intestinal wall; 3. invasion of the intestinal wall  with or without (?) simultaneous formation of enterotoxin. these factors are of different importance for the various infective agents. whereas cholera is exclusively caused by an enterotoxin, this is of minor importance for the pathogenesis of shigella dysentery. the enterotoxins of vibrio cholerae, escherichia coli, and shigella dysenteriae 1 have been intensively studied. additional enterotoxic substances have been demonstrated in other gramnegative organisms (salmonella typhimurium, yersinia enterocolitica, klebsiella pneumoniae, vibrio parahaemolyticus, aeromonas hydrophila), which, however, are not yet characterized sufficiently. future studies will aim to the elucidation of the structure and function of these toxins on the molecular level, and their importance for the pathogenesis of intestinal disease.

AB  == as scored by several specified plating procedures, clinical and environmental strains of yersinia enterocolitica, yersinia pseudotuberculosis, and klebsiella pneumoniae "oxytocum" showed detectable, albeit generally weak, ability to digest polygalacturonic (pectic) acid. none of these bacterial strains had the vigorous  and rapid pectolytic activity on these polygalacturonic acid-containing media that is typical of soft-rot erwinia species, although some of the oxytocum strains came fairly close. analyses of the pectolytic enzyme contents of the cells and culture supernatants of the yersinia and klebsiella species revealed that readily detectable quantities of cell-bound polygalacturonic acid trans-eliminase and hydrolytic polygalacturonase were formed by the yersinia and  klebsiella species; however, the total units of enzyme activity produced by these bacteria were, in general, lower than were produced by soft-rot erwinia species.  furthermore, unlike the situation in soft-rot erwinia cultures, these pectolytic  enzymes of yersinia and klebsiella species were not excreted rapidly and massively into the growth medium. cultures of other enterobacteria (citrobacter species, enterobacter species, erwinia amylovora, erwinia herbicola, escherichia  coli, proteus species, salmonella typhimurium, and serratia marcescens) showed no pectolytic ability whatsoever by any of the plating procedures used and (to the extent they were so examined) produced no pectolytic enzymes detectable either in their cells or culture supernatants. this slow or weak release of pectolytic enzymes by yersinia and klebsiella species has a bearing on clinical laboratory procedures suitable for detecting their pectolytic activity; methods adequate for this purpose are detailed.
