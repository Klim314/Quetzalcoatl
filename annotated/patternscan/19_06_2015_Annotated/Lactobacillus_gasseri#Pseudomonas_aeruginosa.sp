TI  == cd1d-dependent regulation of bacterial colonization in the intestine of mice.
AB  == the accumulation of certain species of bacteria in the intestine is involved in both tissue homeostasis and immune-mediated pathologies. the host mechanisms involved in controlling intestinal colonization with commensal bacteria are poorly understood. we observed that under specific pathogen-free or germ-free conditions, intragastric administration of pseudomonas aeruginosa, e. coli, staphylococcus aureus, or lactobacillus gasseri resulted in increased colonization of the small intestine and bacterial translocation in mice lacking cd1d, an mhc class i-like molecule, compared with wt mice. in contrast, activation of cd1d-restricted t cells (nkt cells) with alpha-galactosylceramide caused diminished intestinal colonization with the same bacterial strains. we also found prominent differences in the composition of intestinal microbiota, including increased adherent bacteria, in cd1d-/- mice in comparison to wt mice under specific pathogen-free conditions. germ-free cd1d-/- mice exhibited a defect in paneth cell granule ultrastructure and ability to degranulate after bacterial colonization. in vitro, nkt cells were shown to induce the release of lysozyme from intestinal crypts. together, these data support a role for cd1d in  regulating intestinal colonization through mechanisms that include the control of paneth cell function.

TI  == characterization of the amylovorin locus of lactobacillus amylovorus dce 471, producer of a bacteriocin active against pseudomonas aeruginosa, in combination with colistin and pyocins.
AB  == lactobacillus amylovorus dce 471 produces amylovorin l, a bacteriocin with an antibacterial activity against some strains of the lactobacillus lineage. based on the sequence of one active peptide, a gene encoding active amylovorin l was cloned and sequenced. genome walking allowed us to sequence a larger fragment of  7577 bp of genomic dna, with 12 predicted orfs. the previously characterized amylovorin l peptide-encoding gene is preceded by another gene encoding a small polypeptide with a typical bacteriocin-processing double-glycine site, suggesting that amylovorin l is a two-component class iib bacteriocin (amylovorin lalpha/beta). lalpha and lbeta show the highest similarity to gassericin t from lactobacillus gasseri sbt2055 and blpn from streptococcus pneumoniae r6, respectively, and to lafa and lafx, which form the lactacin f bacteriocin of lactobacillus johnsonii ncc 533. as for other lactic acid bacteria bacteriocins,  amylovorin l showed no activity against the gram-negative opportunistic pathogen  pseudomonas aeruginosa on its own, but showed synergistic inhibitory activity when used in combination with the peptide antibiotic colistin, and, remarkably, with the p. aeruginosa soluble bacteriocins, pyocins s1 and s2.

TI  == some probiotic properties of vaginal lactobacilli isolated from healthy women.
AB  == lactobacilli have long been considered to be protective flora in the vagina. in this study, samples were taken from the lateral vaginal wall of 19 healthy women, and 58 strains of lactobacillus spp. were isolated from 10 of these women. the identification results revealed that lactobacillus gasseri was the predominant lactobacilli in healthy women. the amounts of lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide (h(2)o(2)) produced by lactobacillus spp. were determined. the vaginal ph levels  induced by lactobacillus spp. strains ranged from 1.00 to 2.15. the titratable acidity of the strains ranged from 0.27 to 1.33%. the h(2)o(2) concentration produced in the lactobacilli strains ranged between 1.01 microg/ml and 15.50 microg/ml. the antimicrobial effects of the lactobacilli against the pathogenic bacteria escherichia coli atcc 11230, staphylococcus aureus atcc 2392, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 29212 and salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis rskk 171 were also determined by the agar diffusion methods.
