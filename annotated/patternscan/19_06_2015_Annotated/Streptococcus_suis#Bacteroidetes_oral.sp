TI  == predominant bacteria recovered from a periodontitis site in a hamster model raised by silk-ligature with porphyromonas gingivalis infection.
AB  == we isolated oral bacteria that coexisted with porphyromonas gingivalis in a hamster periodontitis model. as predominant bacteria in the periodontitis site, collinsella-reltaed strains, eubacterium-reltaed strains, streptococcus suis-related strains, and veillonella parvula-reltaed strains were detected. in addition, actinomyces, bacteroides, and p. gingivalis were also isolated predominantly. the results suggest that the bacterial composition of the periodontitis site in hamsters is complex, as in human periodontitis.
