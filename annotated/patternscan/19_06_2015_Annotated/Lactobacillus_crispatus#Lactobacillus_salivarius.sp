TI  == rapid species-level identification of vaginal and oral lactobacilli using maldi-tof ms analysis and 16s rdna sequencing.
AB  == background: lactobacillus represents a large genus with different implications for the human host. specific lactobacilli are considered to maintain vaginal health and to protect from urogenital infection. the presence of lactobacillus species in carious lesions on the other hand is associated with progressive caries. despite their clinical significance, species-level identification of lactobacilli still poses difficulties and mostly involves a combination of different phenotypic and genotypic methods. this study evaluated rapid maldi-tof  ms analysis of vaginal and oral lactobacillus isolates in comparison to 16s rdna  analysis. results: both methods were used to analyze 77 vaginal and 21 oral lactobacillus isolates. the concordance of both methods was at 96% with five samples discordantly identified. fifteen different lactobacillus species were found in the vaginal samples, primarily l. iners, l. crispatus, l. jensenii and l. gasseri. in the oral samples 11 different species were identified, mostly l. salivarius, l. gasseri, l. rhamnosus and l. paracasei. overall, the species found belonged to six different phylogenetic groups. for several samples, maldi-tof ms  analysis only yielded scores indicating genus-level identification. however, in most cases the species found agreed with the 16s rdna analysis result. conclusion: maldi-tof ms analysis proved to be a reliable and fast tool to identify lactobacilli to the species level. even though some results were ambiguous while 16s rdna sequencing yielded confident species identification, accuracy can be improved by extending reference databases. thus, mass spectra analysis provides a suitable method to facilitate monitoring clinically relevant  lactobacillus species.

TI  == characterization of the most abundant lactobacillus species in chicken gastrointestinal tract and potential use as probiotics for genetic engineering.
AB  == the count and diffusion of lactobacilli species in the different gastrointestinal tract (gi) regions of broilers were investigated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, and the probiotic characteristics of six l. reuteri species isolated from broilers' gi tract were also investigated to obtain the potential target for genetic engineering. lactobacilli had the highest diversity  in the crop and the lowest one in the cecum. compared with the lower gi tract, more lactobacilli were found in the upper gi tract. lactobacillus reuteri, l. johnsonii, l. acidophilus, l. crispatus, l. salivarius, and l. aviarius were the  predominant lactobacillus species and present throughout the gi tract of chickens. lactobacillus reuteri was the most abundant lactobacillus species. lactobacillus reuteri xc1 had good probiotic characteristics that would be a potential and desirable target for genetic engineering.

TI  == body fluid identification by integrated analysis of dna methylation and body fluid-specific microbial dna.
AB  == identification of body fluids found at crime scenes provides important information that can support a link between sample donors and actual criminal acts. previous studies have reported that dna methylation analysis at several tissue-specific differentially methylated regions (tdmrs) enables successful identification of semen, and the detection of certain bacterial dna can allow for identification of saliva and vaginal fluid. in the present study, a method for detecting bacterial dna was integrated into a previously reported multiplex methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme-polymerase chain reaction. the developed multiplex pcr was modified by the addition of a new semen-specific marker and by  including amplicons for the 16s ribosomal rna gene of saliva- and vaginal fluid-specific bacteria to improve the efficacy to detect a specific type of body fluid. using the developed multiplex system, semen was distinguishable by unmethylation at the usp49, dact1, and pfn3 tdmrs and by hypermethylation at l81528, and saliva could be identified by detection of saliva-specific bacteria,  veillonella atypica and/or streptococcus salivarius. additionally, vaginal fluid  and menstrual blood were differentiated from other body fluids by hypomethylation at the pfn3 tdmr and the presence of vaginal fluid-specific bacteria, lactobacillus crispatus and/or lactobacillus gasseri. because the developed multiplex system uses the same biological source of dna for individual identification profiling and simultaneously analyses various types of body fluid  in one pcr reaction, this method will facilitate more efficient body fluid identification in forensic casework.

TI  == the effects of bee pollen extracts on the broiler chicken's gastrointestinal microflora.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of bee pollen ethanolic extracts on the in vivo gastrointestinal tract microflora colonization of broiler chickens. a completely randomized experiment based on six treatments (different concentrations of bee pollen - 0, 5, 15, 25, 35 and 45 g kg(-1) diet) was used during 7 weeks. the highest count of faecal enterococci was found in the experimental group with the addition of 15 g of pollen (8.85 +/- 0.87 log cfu g(-1)) per 1 kg of feed mixture. the highest count of lactobacilli was detected in the experimental group with 35 g of pollen per 1 kg of feed mixture and the highest number of the enterobacteriaceae genera count was found in the control group (8.43 +/- 0.15 log cfu g(-1)). moreover, the maldi tof ms biotyper identified the following genera: escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella  oxytoca, as well as lactobacillus acidophilus, l. crispatus, l. fermentum and l.  salivarius from the lactobacilli group and enterococcus avium, e. casseliflavus,  e. cecorum, e. faecalis, e. faecium, e. gallinarum, e. hirae and e. malodoratus from the enterococci group. additionally, the in vitro antimicrobial activities of pollen against five bacteria species isolated from gastrointestinal tracts of  chickens were tested. the best antimicrobial effect of the pollen extract was detected against k. oxytoca.

TI  == isolation and characterization of bacteriocin-producing bacteria from the intestinal microbiota of elderly irish subjects.
AB  == aims: to isolate and characterize bacteriocins produced by predominant species of lactic acid bacteria from faeces of elderly subjects. methods and results: screening over 70,000 colonies, from faecal samples collected from 266 subjects,  using the indicator organisms lactobacillus bulgaricus lmg 6901 and listeria innocua dpc 3572, identified 55 antimicrobial-producing bacteria. genomic fingerprinting following apai digestion revealed 15 distinct strains. the antimicrobial activities associated with 13 of the 15 strains were sensitive to protease treatment. the predominant antimicrobial-producing species were identified as lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus crispatus and enterococcus spp. a number of previously characterized bacteriocins, including abp-118 and salivaricin b (from lact. salivarius), enterocin b (enterococcus faecium), lactacin b (lact. acidophilus),  gassericin t and a variant of gassericin a (lact. gasseri), were identified. interestingly, two antimicrobial-producing species, not generally associated with intestinally derived microorganisms were also isolated: lactococcus lactis producing nisin z and streptococcus mutans producing mutacin ii. conclusion: these data suggest that bacteriocin production by intestinal isolates against our chosen targets under the screening conditions used was not frequent (0.08%). significance and impact of the study: the results presented are important due to  growing evidence indicating bacteriocin production as a potential probiotic trait by virtue of strain dominance and/or pathogen inhibition in the mammalian intestine.

TI  == dietary inclusion of feathers affects intestinal microbiota and microbial metabolites in growing leghorn-type chickens.
AB  == feather pecking in laying hens is a serious behavioral problem that is often associated with feather eating. the intake of feathers may influence the gut microbiota and its metabolism. the aim of this study was to determine the effect  of 2 different diets, with or without 5% ground feathers, on the gut microbiota and the resulting microbial fermentation products and to identify keratin-degrading bacteria in chicken digesta. one-day-old lohmann-selected leghorn chicks were divided into 3 feeding groups: group a (control), b (5% ground feathers in the diet), and c, in which the control diet was fed until wk 12 and then switched to the 5% feather diet to study the effect of time of first  feather ingestion. the gut microbiota was analyzed by cultivation and denaturing  gradient gel electrophoresis of ileum and cecum digesta. short-chain fatty acids, ammonia, and lactate concentrations were measured as microbial metabolites. the concentration of keratinolytic bacteria increased after feather ingestion in the  ileum (p < 0.001) and cecum (p = 0.033). bacterial species that hydrolyzed keratin were identified as enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus reuteri-like species (97% sequence homology), and lactobacillus salivarius-like species (97% sequence homology). molecular analysis of cecal dna  extracts showed that the feather diet lowered the bacterial diversity indicated by a reduced richness (p < 0.001) and shannon (p = 0.012) index. the pattern of microbial metabolites indicated some changes, especially in the cecum. this study showed that feather intake induced an adaptation of the intestinal microbiota in  chickens. it remains unclear to what extent the changed metabolism of the microbiota reflects the feather intake and could have an effect on the behavior of the hens.

TI  == in vitro screening of lactobacilli isolated from chicken excreta to control salmonella enteritidis and typhimurium.
AB  == 1. the aim of this work was to select lactic acid bacteria (lab) strains from chicks and hens of egg-laying strains for potential use to control salmonellae. 2. nineteen lab strains obtained from culture collections, and 24 strains isolated from excreta of laying hens and chicks, were evaluated for inhibitory capacities against two salmonella serotypes using a "spot-the-lawn" technique and other in vitro properties that could be predictive of antimicrobial activity. 3.  the size of the inhibition zone differed slightly between salmonella serotypes, however, the mean size of the salmonella inhibition zone differed greatly among the lab strains. lactobacillus salivarius, l. plantarum, l. rhamnosus and l. reuteri exhibited powerful inhibitory effects to each salmonella strain. 4. the result of the acid tolerance test showed that all l. salivarius, l. kitasatonis strains and each of l. ingluviei cannot survive in a low ph environment. in the bile acid tolerance assay, growth was inhibited in all strains, except l. kitasatonis he4, and a large inhibition was observed in most of the l. salivarius and l. crispatus strains. 5. the results demonstrate that some lab of poultry origin were able to inhibit the growth of salmonella and survive simulated passage through the gastrointestinal tract. the selected lab could act in the lower gastrointestinal tract to prevent salmonellosis in poultry.

TI  == qualitative and semiquantitative analysis of lactobacillus species in the vaginas of healthy fertile and postmenopausal chinese women.
AB  == the present study aimed to investigate the prevalence and quantity of lactobacillus species in the vaginas of healthy chinese women. vaginal samples from 92 fertile and 22 postmenopausal healthy chinese women were analysed using a 16s rrna gene clone library and species-specific pcr followed by sequencing and real-time pcr. a total of 13 different lactobacillus species were detected. species-specific pcr showed that 3% of the fertile women were colonized by one species of lactobacillus and 97% were colonized by two or more species. among the postmenopausal women, 91% were colonized by one species of lactobacillus and 9% were colonized by two species. in the fertile women, l. iners (82.61%), l. crispatus (70.65%) and l. gasseri (67.39%) were more prevalent than l. jensenii (40.22%), l. acidophilus (39.13%), l. brevis (23.91%), l. plantarum (5.43%), l. johnsonii (3.26%), l. fermentum (2.17%), l. salivarius (2.17%), l. rhamnosus (1.09%), l. reuteri (1.09%) and l. paracasei (1.09%); l. delbrueckii was not detected. in the postmenopausal women, l. fermentum, l. rhamnosus, l. reuteri and l. delbrueckii were not detected, and the other 10 species were detected in just  a few samples. the prevalence of these species according to the clone library differed from the prevalence indicated by the species-specific pcr. according to  the semiquantitative analysis, the total lactobacillus dna concentrations were higher in fertile women than in postmenopausal women. sixty-one per cent of the fertile women were predominantly colonized by l. iners, 35% by l. crispatus, and  2% by l. gasseri. associations between pairs of lactobacillus species in fertile  women were significant (p<0.05) between the following pairs: l. iners and l. gasseri, l. iners and l. jensenii, l. iners and l. acidophilus, l. gasseri and l. acidophilus, and l. gasseri and l. jensenii. in conclusion, this study provided detailed information on lactobacillus species colonizing the vaginas of healthy chinese fertile and postmenopausal women. the study also showed that the diversity of lactobacillus species in fertile women was higher than in postmenopausal women. according to our study, different techniques, such as species-specific pcr and comparison against a 16s rrna gene clone library, resulted in different findings regarding species prevalence. these findings highlight the importance of standardization of techniques used for evaluation of  bacterial communities. according to our findings regarding species associations,  l. iners and l. gasseri may have influences on colonization and proliferation of  other vaginal lactobacillus species.

TI  == pcr-based identification of eight lactobacillus species and 18 hr-hpv genotypes in fixed cervical samples of south african women at risk of hiv and bv.
AB  == vaginal lactobacilli assessed by pcr-based microarray and pcr-based genotyping of hpv in south african women at risk for hiv and bv. vaginal lactobacilli can be defined by microarray techniques in fixed cervical samples of south african women. cervical brush samples suspended in the coagulant fixative boonfix of one  hundred women attending a health centre for hiv testing in south africa were available for this study. in the ndlovu medical centre in elandsdoorn, south africa, identification of 18 hr-hpv genotypes was done using the inno-lipa method. an inventory of lactobacilli organisms was performed using microarray technology. on the basis of the lactobacillus and lactobacillus biofilm scoring,  the cases were identified as leiden bacterial vaginosis (bv) negative (bv-; n = 41), leiden bv intermediate (bv+/-; n = 25), and leiden bv positive (bv+; n = 34). fifty-one women were hiv positive and 49 hiv negative. out of the 51 hiv positive women, 35 were hpv infected. these 51 hiv positive women were frequently infected with hpv16 and hpv18. in addition, hpv35, hpv52, hpv33, and hpv66 were often detected in these samples. lactobacillus salivarius and lactobacillus iners were the most prevalent lactobacilli as established by the microarray technique.  in women with hpv infection, the prevalence of lactobacillus crispatus was significantly reduced. in both hiv and hpv infection, a similar (but not identical) shift in the composition of the lactobacillus flora was observed. we conclude that there is a shift in the composition of vaginal lactobacilli in hiv-infected women. because of the prominence of hpv35, hpv52, hpv33, and hpv66,  vaccination for exclusively hpv16 and hpv18 might be insufficient in south african hiv+ women.

TI  == identification and characterization of potential performance-related gut microbiotas in broiler chickens across various feeding trials.
AB  == three broiler feeding trials were investigated in order to identify gut bacteria  consistently linked with improvements in bird performance as measured by feed efficiency. trials were done in various geographic locations and varied in diet composition, broiler breed, and bird age. gut microbial communities were investigated using microbial profiling. eight common performance-linked operational taxonomic units (otus) were identified within both the ilea (180, 492, and 564-566) and ceca (140-142, 218-220, 284-286, 312, and 482) across trials. otu 564-566 was associated with lower performance, while otus 140-142, 482, and 492 were associated with improved performance. targeted cloning and sequencing of these eight otus revealed that they represented 26 bacterial species or phylotypes which clustered phylogenetically into seven groups related  to lactobacillus spp., ruminococcaceae, clostridiales, gammaproteobacteria, bacteroidales, clostridiales/lachnospiraceae, and unclassified bacteria/clostridia. where bacteria were identifiable to the phylum level, they belonged predominantly to the firmicutes, with bacteroidetes and proteobacteria also identified. some of the potential performance-related phylotypes showed high sequence identity with classified bacteria (lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus aviarius, lactobacillus crispatus, faecalibacterium prausnitzii, escherichia coli, gallibacterium anatis, clostridium lactatifermentans, ruminococcus torques, bacteroides vulgatus, and alistipes finegoldii). the 16s rrna gene sequence information generated will allow quantitative assays to be developed which will enable elucidations of which of these phylotypes are truly performance related. this information could be used to monitor strategies to improve feed efficiency and feed formulation for optimal gut health.

TI  == screening for lactobacilli with probiotic properties in the infant gut microbiota.
AB  == lactobacilli are believed to be beneficial for the human hosts and are currently  being evaluated as potentially probiotic bacteria. in this study, lactobacillus strains were isolated from infant faeces and were examined in vitro for potential probiotic properties. faecal specimens from 63 healthy, full-term infants were collected at 4, 30 and 90 days after delivery. seventy-four lactobacillus strains were isolated and one or more different phenotypes from each infant (n = 44) were selected for further testing. the bacterial isolates were identified mainly as l. gasseri, l. crispatus, lactobacillus paracasei, l. salivarius, l. fermentum after amplification and sequencing of 16s rrna gene. the strains were examined for acid and bile tolerance, adhesion to caco-2 cells, antibiotic susceptibility and antimicrobial activity against selected enteric pathogens. the great majority of  the isolated lactobacilli were susceptible to ampicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic  acid, tetracycline, erythromycin, cephalothin, chloramphenicol and rifampicin. resistance to vancomycin or bacitracin was detected to 34% of the strains. twenty strains out of forty-four exhibited significant tolerance to bile salts. those strains were subsequently tested for resistance to low ph conditions (ph 2 and 3). interestingly, 85% (17 strains) of the tested lactobacilli remained unaffected at ph 3 after 3 h of incubation, 6 strains were found resistant at ph  2 after 1.5 h and only 2 strains found resistant after 3 h of incubation. two of  the strains were able to adhere to caco-2 cells. in conclusion, two isolates fulfilled the in vitro probiotic criteria and are good candidates for further in  vivo evaluation.

TI  == inducer bacteria, unique signal peptides, and low-nutrient media stimulate in vitro bacteriocin production by lactobacillus spp. and enterococcus spp. strains.
AB  == bacteriocins (bcn) are antimicrobial peptides that provide potential to control bacterial infections in a variety of applications. we previously reported on three class iia bcn molecules produced by lactobacillus salivarius b-30514 (or-7), enterococcus faecium b-30746 (e 50-52), and enterococcus durans/faecium/hirae b-30745 (e-760). these bcn are notably effective against a wide array of pathogenic bacteria. to commercially apply such bcn, adequate quantities must be produced and harvested. we determined that a combination of host producer synthesized signal peptides (sp) in the presence of both producer and inducer bacteria grown in a dilute fermentation medium enabled marked increases in the synthesis of bcn. these sp contained 24-30 amino acid residues with sizes ranging from 2095 to 3065 da having the unique terminal carboxyl sequence of vkglt. the inducer bacterial isolates used were lactobacillus acidophilus b-30510 and lactobacillus crispatus b-30884. we used a nutrient-limited medium of 10% brucella broth (containing 0.01% glucose) to enhance bcn production. using the combination of these above three parameters enabled us to reproducibly harvest at least 200 mg of bcn/l of the spent fermentation broth. this information can be used to assist in the production of bcn.

TI  == vaginal lactobacilli as potential probiotics against candida spp.
AB  == urogenital infections affect millions of people every year worldwide. the treatment of these diseases usually requires the use of antimicrobial agents, and more recently, the use of probiotic lactic acid bacteria (lab) cultures for the management of vaginal infections has been extensively studied. in this work, 11 vaginal lactobacilli isolates, previously obtained from healthy patients, were studied to screen microorganisms with probiotic properties against candida spp. the lab were tested for their ability of auto-aggregation, co-aggregation with c. albicans, c. glabrata, c. krusei, and c. tropicalis, adhesion to caco-2 epithelial cells and production of lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide (h2o2). all  lactobacilli isolates tested were able to auto-aggregate (ranging from 25.3% to 75.4% assessed at 4 hours of incubation) and to co-aggregate with the four candida species into different degrees; among them l. crispatus showed the highest scores of co-aggregation. the highest amount of lactic acid was produced  by l. salivarius (13.9 g/l), followed by l. johnsonii (6.5 g/l), l. acidophilus (5.5 g/l), and l. jensenii (5.4 g/l). all isolates produced h2o2, but the highest levels (3 - 10 mg/l) were observed for l. acidophilus, l. crispatus, l. gasseri,  l. johnsonii, and l. vaginalis. only l. agilis, l. jensenii, l. johnsonii and l.  ruminus were able to adhere to epithelial caco-2 cells. among the isolates evaluated, l agilis, l. jensenii, l. johnsonii, and l. ruminus exhibited simultaneously several desirable properties as potential probiotic strains justifying future studies to evaluate their technological properties in different pharmaceutical preparations for human use.

TI  == identification of the most abundant lactobacillus species in the crop of 1- and 5-week-old broiler chickens.
AB  == bacteria from crops of 1- and 5-week-old broiler chickens fed with two brands (diets a and b) of wheat-based diets were isolated on lactobacillus-selective medium and identified (n = 300) based on partial 16s rrna gene sequence. the most abundant lactobacillus species were l. reuteri (33%), l. crispatus (18.7%), and l. salivarius (13.3%). regardless of farm and feed, l. reuteri was the most abundant species (p < 0.005) in the crops of the younger chickens. however, the amount of l. reuteri was significantly reduced in the crops of the 5-week-old chickens regardless of the feed (p = 0.016). the diversity of l. reuteri isolates was studied by fatty acid analysis, and the 94 l. reuteri isolates could be arranged into several clusters. the nisin sensitivities of the l. reuteri isolates were determined because nisin is a candidate coccidiostat. sensitive isolates were found more frequently in younger chickens (77%) than in 5-week-old  chickens (23%), whereas chickens fed with commercial feed b had a higher proportion of nisin-resistant isolates (73%) than did chickens fed with feed a (45%). nisin-resistant strains are potential candidates for adjunct cultures for  maintaining l. reuteri in its natural niche in the crop and are potential targets for genetic engineering with nisin-selectable food-grade vectors. the diversity of the l. reuteri population suggested that one should consider including several strains representing different clusters and nisin resistance phenotypes in candidate probiotic feed supplements for chickens.

TI  == changes in the diversity of pig ileal lactobacilli around weaning determined by means of 16s rrna gene amplification and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis.
AB  == our study aimed to provide a comprehensive characterization of changes in porcine intestinal lactobacillus populations around the time of weaning based on 16s rrna gene amplification and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). dna was extracted from the ileal contents of piglets at weaning (28 days of age) and after 1, 2, 5 and 11 days. pcr amplicons (v2-v3 fragments of 16s rrna genes) were separated using dgge. predominant bands were excised and sequenced after reamplification. a band corresponding to lactobacillus salivarius was present 1 and 2 days post-weaning (pw), while lactobacillus crispatus was detected only 1 and 11 days pw. lactobacillus sobrius gave the most dominant band in all animals. the number of bands decreased from 13+/-3 at weaning to 9+/-1 at 5 days pw, but the species richness had recovered by 11 days pw. the similarity of profiles between sampling days was high for 1 and 2 days pw (>91%), but was low for 5 and  11 days pw (<59%). the diversity of the profiles was lower 5 days pw, based on the shannon diversity index (0.83+/-0.076 vs. 1.02+/-0.127 at weaning, p=0.042),  but had recovered to preweaning values by 11 days pw. the application of group-specific dgge showed that the lactobacillus community within the porcine ileum undergoes dramatic, partly reversible changes as a consequence of weaning.

TI  == isolation and molecular characterization of antibiotic-resistant lactic acid bacteria from poultry and swine meat products.
AB  == the transfer via the food chain from animals to humans of microbes that are resistant to antimicrobial agents is of increasing concern. to determine the contributions of nonpathogenic microflora to the occurrence and spread of antibiotic resistance (ar) genes in the food chain, 123 lactic acid bacteria were isolated from 29 samples of raw and processed pork and chicken meat products that had previously tested positive for one or more ar genes that encode clinically relevant ars: tet(m), tet(o), tet(k), erm(a), erm(b), erm(c), aac (6')-ie aph (2")-ia, meca, and blaz. all of the isolates were initially tested for their ar gene profiles by pcr. the 59 isolates carrying a tet, erm, or blaz gene were taken through molecular identification, analyzed by determination of the mic, and subjected to genetic fingerprinting. lactococcus garvieae was the predominant species (28 isolates), followed by lactobacillus plantarum (11 isolates) and l. salivarius (6 isolates), whereas lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, lactobacillus  johnsonii, l. reuteri, l. crispatus, and l. brevis were identified at lower frequencies. the tet(m) and erm(b) genes were the most frequently detected. assessment of multiple resistances in 18 tet positive (tet+) isolates revealed that tet(m) plus erm(b) and tet(k) plus erm(b) were the most frequent ar gene patterns. partial sequencing of the tet(m) open reading frame of three selected strains showed high sequence similarities (> 99%) with tet(m) genes previously found in human pathogens (listeria monocytogenes and neisseria meningitidis). southern hybridization with plasmid profiles revealed these strains contained tet(m)-carrying plasmids.

TI  == cloacal lactobacillus isolates from broilers often display resistance toward tetracycline antibiotics.
AB  == lactobacillus crispatus, l. reuteri, l. amylovorus, l. gallinarum, and l. salivarius subsp. salivarius strains isolated from cloacal swabs of broiler chickens derived from 20 different farms in belgium were tested for susceptibility to tetracycline and minocycline. acquired resistance percentages to these antibiotics were extremely high for l. crispatus, l. reuteri, l. gallinarum, and l. salivarius subsp. salivarius (75%-100%). l. amylovorus on the  contrary, displayed lower resistance percentages (25%) toward minocycline and tetracycline. in several strains, resistance against the tetracycline antibiotics was associated with the presence of the resistance genes tet(k), tet(l), tet(m),  tet(w), and tet(z). to our knowledge, this is the first report of tet(z) in lactobacilli and tet(k), tet(l), and tet(w) in lactobacilli identified to species level. our findings strengthen the evidence of intestinal lactobacillus species acting as a pool of antimicrobial resistance genes urging the need for prudent use of tetracycline antibiotics in poultry production.

TI  == influence of intensive and extensive breeding on lactic acid bacteria isolated from gallus gallus domesticus ceca.
AB  == in the present study, lactic acid bacteria (lab) from the cecum of chickens bred  either under intensive (commercial broilers) or extensive (free-range) conditions were isolated, identified and some of their probiotic characteristics determined. the lab identified by 16s-23s rrna pcr-ardra were mainly of lactobacillus species and to a lesser extent of enterococcus spp. for all animals. free-range chickens  showed a higher presence of lactobacillus acidophilus while lactobacillus reuteri and lactobacillus johnsonii were more frequently recovered from commercial broilers. lactobacillus crispatus was found only in commercial broilers, lactobacillus vaginalis and lactobacillus agilis only in free-range chickens and  lactobacillus salivarius in both types. enterococcus isolates from ceca of commercial broilers showed a higher resistance to antimicrobial drugs. lactobacillus isolates from free-range chickens presented a higher frequency of in vitro antagonistic activity against selected pathogens than from commercial broilers. all lab isolates had predominantly non-hydrophobic surfaces, but with variations depending on age of the chickens and breeding conditions. animal breeding caused variation on composition, antimicrobial susceptibility, antagonistic activity and surface hydrophobicity of lab from chicken cecum. lab isolates from ceca of free-range chickens have potential as probiotic agents, which may be used in the future as replacing the use of antimicrobials as growth  promoters.

TI  == characterisation of prototype nurmi cultures using culture-based microbiological  techniques and pcr-dgge.
AB  == undefined nurmi-type cultures (ntcs) have been used successfully to prevent salmonella colonisation in poultry for decades. such cultures are derived from the caecal contents of specific-pathogen-free birds and are administered via drinking water or spray application onto eggs in the hatchery. these cultures consist of many non-culturable and obligately anaerobic bacteria. due to their undefined nature it is difficult to obtain approval from regulatory agencies to use these preparations as direct fed microbials for poultry. in this study, 10 batches of prototype ntcs were produced using an identical protocol over a period of 2 years. traditional microbiological techniques and a molecular culture-independent methodology, polymerase chain reaction combined with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge), were applied to characterise  these cultures and also to examine if the constituents of the ntcs were identical. culture-dependent analysis of these cultures included plating on a variety of selective and semi-selective agars, examination of colony morphology,  gram-staining and a series of biochemical tests (api, biomerieux, france). two sets of pcr-dgge studies were performed. these involved the amplification of universal and subsequently lactic acid bacteria (lab)-specific hypervariable regions of a 16s rrna gene by pcr. resultant amplicons were subjected to dgge. sequence analysis was performed on subsequent bands present in resultant dgge profiles using the basic local alignment search tool (blast). microbiological culturing techniques tended to isolate common probiotic bacterial species from the genera lactobacillus, lactococcus, bifidobacterium, enterococcus, clostridium, escherichia, pediococcus and enterobacterium as well as members of the genera, actinomyces, bacteroides, propionibacterium, capnocytophaga, proteus, and klebsiella. bacteroides, enterococcus, escherichia, brevibacterium, klebsiella, lactobacillus, clostridium, bacillus, eubacterium, serratia, citrobacter, enterobacter, pectobacterium and pantoea spp. in addition to unculturable bacteria were identified as constituents of the ntcs using universal pcr-dgge analysis. a number of the sequences detected by lab-specific pcr-dgge were homologous to those of a number of lactobacillus spp., including l. fermentum, l. pontis, l. crispatus, l. salivarius, l. casei, l. suntoryeus, l. vaginalis, l. gasseri, l. aviaries, l. johnsonii, l. acidophilus, and l. mucosae  in addition to a range of unculturable lactobacilli. while ntcs are successful due to their complexity, the presence of members of lactobacillus spp. amongst other probiotic genera, in these samples possibly lends to the success of the ntc cultures as probiotics or competitive exclusion products in poultry over the decades. pcr-dgge proved to be an effective tool in detecting non-culturable organisms present in these complex undefined cultures. in conclusion, while the culture-dependent identification methods or pcr-dgge alone cannot comprehensively elucidate the bacterial species present in such complex cultures, their complementarity provides useful information on the identity of the constituents of ntcs and will aid in future development of defined probiotics. moreover, for the purpose of analysing prototype ntcs during their development, pcr-dgge overcomes the limitations associated with conventional culturing methods including their low sensitivities, inability to detect unculturable bacteria and  unknown species, very slow turnabout time and poor reproducibility. this study demonstrated that pcr-dgge is indeed more valuable in detecting predominant microbial populations between various ntcs than as an identification methodology, being more applicable as a quality control method used to analyse for batch-to-batch variation during ntc production.

TI  == viability of vaginal probiotic lactobacilli during refrigerated and frozen storage.
AB  == the viability of six different strains of probiotic vaginal lactobacillus was examined in two different cryoprotective media, during refrigerated versus frozen storage, and using two traditional types of stock cultures for starting the biomass production. freezing at -20 degrees c and -70 degrees c had much less adverse effect on viability than did storage at 7 degrees c, and the reduction in viability was greater at -20 degrees c than at -70 degrees c. the strains showed  variation in the extent of the viability losses during both types of storage. milk-yeast extract (mye) was shown to be the more suitable protective medium to maintain viability of the strains during the storage. the vaginal lactobacillus strains are most stable in mye at -70 degrees c with only a small decrease of the viability observed under these conditions. the viable cell counts of lactobacillus paracasei crl 1251 and crl 1289, l. crispatus crl 1266 and l. salivarius crl 1328 remained around 1 x 10(8) cfu/ml after 24 months of storage at -70 degrees c, or up to 18 months for l. acidophilus crl 1259.

TI  == cloacal lactobacillus isolates from broilers show high prevalence of resistance towards macrolide and lincosamide antibiotics.
AB  == eighty-seven lactobacillus strains isolated from cloacal swabs of broiler chickens derived from 20 different farms in belgium were identified to species level and tested for susceptibility to macrolide and lincosamide antibiotics. five different lactobacillus species were identified as being predominantly present in the cloacae of broilers: lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus salivarius subsp. salivarius, lactobacillus amylovorus, lactobacillus gallinarum  and lactobacillu sreuteri. acquired resistance prevalence to macrolides and lincosamides was very high in the investigated lactobacilli: 89% of the strains were resistant to either or both lincosamide and macrolide class antibiotics. the vast majority of these resistant strains (96%) displayed constitutive resistance. more than one-half of the macrolide and/or lincosamide resistant strains carried  an erm(b), erm(c), mef(a), lnu(a) gene or a combination of these genes.

TI  == use of polymerase chain reaction techniques and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for differentiation of oral lactobacillus species.
AB  == background/aims: the genus lactobacillus has been associated with dental caries in humans, although it is seldom speciated due to lack of simple and nonlaborious identification methods. a considerable heterogeneity among lactobacillus species  has been demonstrated. the purpose of this study was to develop simple methods combining restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of polymerase chain reaction (pcr)-amplified 16s rrna (16s rrna gene pcr-rflp) and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) for the identification of 13 reference strains of lactobacillus. methods: the 16s rrna gene sequences were  amplified by pcr using universal primers and digestion of pcr products with the restriction endonucleases, hpaii and haeiii. the 16s rrna gene pcr-rflp is reproducible and has been proved to be useful for differentiating lactobacillus strains to species level. seventy-seven lactobacillus isolates from a thai population were used to show the applicability of the identification test. results: pcr-rflp alone had limitations, because the rflp patterns of lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus rhamnosus and of lactobacillus acidophilus  and lactobacillus crispatus showed similar patterns; however, these could be differentiated by sds-page. of the 77 isolates, 38 were identified as lactobacillus fermentum, 25 as l. rhamnosus, 5 as lactobacillus salivarius, 5 as  l. casei, 3 as l. acidophilus and 1 as lactobacillus plantarum. conclusion: 16s rrna gene pcr-rflp, using hpaii and haeiii, together with sds-page protein profiles could be an alternative method for the identification of oral lactobacillus strains to species level, and may be applicable for large-scale studies on the association of lactobacillus to dental caries.

TI  == effect of some pharmaceutical excipients on the survival of probiotic vaginal lactobacilli.
AB  == lactobacilli are the predominant microorganisms of the vaginal bacterial microbiota, and they play a major role in the maintenance of a healthy urogenital tract. in consequence, the interest in their potential use as probiotics has significantly increased during the last decade. in the present study we assessed  the influence of different excipients on the survival of 4 probiotic vaginal lactobacilli incorporated into glycerinated gelatin ovules and stored at 5 degrees c for 60 d. results showed that viability after storage was a strain-dependent characteristic, but inclusion of ascorbic acid significantly increased survival in 3 of the 4 strains tested. the best survival was observed for lactobacillus salivarius crl 1328 in ovules containing skimmed milk. no significant differences in viability were observed between control ovules (glycerogelatin base without excipients) and those containing lactose or tween 80 for any of the strains tested. lactobacillus acidophilus crl 1259 and lactobacillus crispatus crl 1266 were, respectively, the most resistant and sensitive strains to the storage with the different substances. in conclusion, these results provide a basis for selecting excipients to improve the survival of lactobacilli in a probiotic product, in an attempt to ensure the delivery of an adequate number of viable cells to the urogenital tract.

TI  == susceptibility to some antifungal drugs of vaginal lactobacilli isolated from healthy women.
AB  == samples were taken from the lateral vaginal wall of 19 healthy women. lactobacilli were isolated from ten of these women. fifty-eight lactobacillus isolates were identified as l. gasseri, l. vaginalis, l. acidophilus, l. delbrueckii spp. lactis, l. crispatus, l. plantarum, l. cellobiosus, l. jensenii, l. salivarius, l. curvatus, l. brevis and l. oris. the inhibitory effect of isoconazole and oxiconazole in 0.2, 0.1 and 0.05 microg/ml concentrations on 58 lactobacillus spp. and candida albicans (ajd 180) were investigated, using an agar diffusion method. although both antifungal drugs showed a large inhibitory effect on c. albicans, oxiconazole had a very low inhibitory effect on lactobacillus isolates. the natural resistance of lactobacilli to anti-fungal drugs may enable the development of an antifungal drug(s)/ probiotic combination  for antifungal activity and lactobacilli replacement therapy.

TI  == quantitative analysis of diverse lactobacillus species present in advanced dental caries.
AB  == our previous analysis of 65 advanced dental caries lesions by traditional culture techniques indicated that lactobacilli were numerous in the advancing front of the progressive lesion. production of organic acids by lactobacilli is considered to be important in causing decalcification of the dentinal matrix. the present study was undertaken to define more precisely the diversity of lactobacilli found in this environment and to quantify the major species and phylotypes relative to  total load of lactobacilli by real-time pcr. pooled dna was amplified by pcr with lactobacillus genus-specific primers for subsequent cloning, sequencing, and phylogenetic analysis. based on 16s ribosomal dna sequence comparisons, 18 different phylotypes of lactobacilli were detected, including strong representation of both novel and gastrointestinal phylotypes. specific pcr primers were designed for nine prominent species, including lactobacillus gasseri, l. ultunensis, l. salivarius, l. rhamnosus, l. casei, l. crispatus, l. delbrueckii, l. fermentum, and l. gallinarum. more than three different species were identified as being present in most of the dentine samples, confirming the widespread distribution and numerical importance of various lactobacillus spp. in carious dentine. quantification by real-time pcr revealed various proportions of  the nine species colonizing carious dentine, with higher mean loads of l. gasseri and l. ultunensis than of the other prevalent species. the findings provide a basis for further characterization of the pathogenicity of lactobacillus spp. in  the context of extension of the carious lesion.

TI  == detection and identification of lactobacillus species in crops of broilers of different ages by using pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis.
AB  == the microflora of the crop was investigated throughout the broiler production period (0 to 42 days) using pcr combined with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge) and selective bacteriological culture of lactobacilli  followed by amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis (ardra). the birds were  raised under conditions similar to those used in commercial broiler production. lactobacilli predominated and attained populations of 10(8) to 10(9) cfu per gram of crop contents. many of the lactobacilli present in the crop (61.9% of isolates) belonged to species of the lactobacillus acidophilus group and could not be differentiated by pcr-dgge. a rapid and simple ardra method was developed  to distinguish between the members of the l. acidophilus group. haeiii-ardra was  used for preliminary identification of isolates in the l. acidophilus group and to identify lactobacillus reuteri and lactobacillus salivarius. msei-ardra generated unique patterns for all species of the l. acidophilus group, identifying lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus johnsonii, and lactobacillus gallinarum among crop isolates. the results of our study provide comprehensive knowledge of the lactobacillus microflora in the crops of birds of different ages using nucleic acid-based methods of detection and identification based on current taxonomic criteria.

TI  == inhibition of staphylococcus aureus by the commensal bacteria of human milk.
AB  == aims: to study the bacterial diversity in expressed human milk with a focus on detecting bacteria with an antimicrobial activity against staphylococcus aureus,  known as a causative agent of maternal breast infections and neonatal infections. methods and results: random isolates (n = 509) were collected from breast milk samples (n = 40) of healthy lactating women, genotypically identified, and tested for antimicrobial activity against staph. aureus. commensal staphylococci (64%) and oral streptococci (30%), with staph. epidermidis, strep. salivarius, and strep. mitis as the most frequent isolates, were the predominant bacterial species in breast milk. one-fifth of staph. epidermidis and half of strep. salivarius isolates suppressed growth of staph. aureus. enterococci (ent. faecalis), isolated from 7.5% of samples, and lactic acid bacteria (lab) (lactobacillus rhamnosus, lact. crispatus, lactococcus lactis, leuconoctoc mesenteroides), isolated from 12.5% of samples, were also effective against staph. aureus. one l. lactis isolate was shown to produce nisin, a bacteriocin used in food industry to prevent bacterial pathogens and spoilage. conclusions: expressed breast milk contains commensal bacteria, which inhibit staph. aureus. significance and impact of the study: the strains inhibitory against the pathogen staph. aureus have potential use as bacteriotherapeutic agents in preventing neonatal and maternal breast infections caused by this bacterium.

TI  == isolation, selection, and characterization of lactic acid bacteria for a competitive exclusion product to reduce shedding of escherichia coli o157:h7 in cattle.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) were selected on the basis of characteristics indicating that they would be good candidates for a competitive exclusion product (cep) that would inhibit escherichia coli o157:h7 in the intestinal tract of live cattle. fecal samples from cattle that were culture negative for e. coli o157:h7  were collected. lab were isolated from cattle feces by repeated plating on deman  rogosa sharpe agar and lactobacillus selection agar. six hundred eighty-six pure  colonies were isolated, and an agar spot test was used to test each isolate for its inhibition of a four-strain mixture of e. coli o157:h7. three hundred fifty-five isolates (52%) showed significant inhibition. seventy-five isolates showing maximum inhibition were screened for acid and bile tolerance. most isolates were tolerant of acid at ph levels of 2, 4, 5, and 7 and at bile levels  of 0.05, 0.15, and 0.3% (oxgall) and were subsequently identified with the api system. lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus delbreukii, lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus cellobiosus, leuconostoc spp., and pediococcus acidilactici were the most commonly identified lab. nineteen strains were further tested for antibiotic resistance and inhibition of e. coli o157:h7 in manure and rumen fluid. four of these 19 strains showed susceptibility to all of the antibiotics, 13 significantly reduced e. coli counts in manure, and 15 significantly reduced e. coli counts in rumen fluid (p < 0.05) during at least one of the sampling periods. one of the strains, m35, was selected as the best candidate for a cep. a 16s rrna sequence analysis of m35 revealed its close homology to lactobacillus crispatus. the cep developed will be used in cattle-feeding trials.

TI  == phylogenetic analysis of cecal microbiota in chicken by the use of 16s rdna clone libraries.
AB  == the chicken cecum contains a great many bacteria, most of which are strict anaerobes. a strictly anaerobe culture-based method was used in the present study, in conjunction with the 16s rdna clone library, to elucidate bacterial diversity and the phylogenetic relationship of cecal microbiota in the chicken. a comparative 16s rdna sequence analysis of cultivated strains and retrieved clones from cecal contents was performed. approximately 90% of the bacterial cells detected by microscopy did not form colonies on a medium 10 in plate-in-bottle. the 19 isolated strains yielded 11 distinct rdna sequences, 58% of which were classified as low g + c gram-positive bacteria, 26% were related to bacteroides spp., and 16% were classified as proteobacteria. based on the sequence analysis of 164 clones, 24% were identified to belong to 8 known species and 76% were considered to be 65 novel phylotypes. approximately 94% of cloned sequences were  classified into low g + c gram-positive bacteria, 4% were related to bacteroides  spp., and 2% were classified into proteobacteria. clostridium subcluster xiva (38%), clostridium cluster iv (13%), lactobacillus spp. (24%), and bacteroides spp. (4%) were the major groups constituting the cecal microbiota in chicken, in  which the clostridium subcluster xiva was the most phylogenetically diverse group in chicken cecum. the 16s rdna sequences of lactobacillus acidophilus, l. crispatus, l. salivarius, and l. reuteri were the most frequently found in the lactobacillus group in chicken cecum.

TI  == colonization of the stratified squamous epithelium of the nonsecreting area of horse stomach by lactobacilli.
AB  == selective adhesion to only certain epithelia is particularly common among the bacterial members of the indigenous microflora of mammals. we have found that the stratified squamous epithelium of the nonsecreting area of horse stomach is colonized by gram-positive rods. the microscopic features of a dense layer of these bacteria on the epithelium were found to be similar to those reported in mice, rats, and swine. adhering microorganisms were isolated and identified as lactobacillus salivarius, l. crispatus, l. reuteri, and l. agilis by dna-dna hybridization and 16s rrna gene sequencing techniques. these lactobacilli associated with the horse, except for l. reuteri, were found to adhere to horse epithelial cells in vitro but not to those of rats. a symbiotic relationship of these lactobacilli with the horse is suggested.

TI  == rapid identification of 11 human intestinal lactobacillus species by multiplex pcr assays using group- and species-specific primers derived from the 16s-23s rrna intergenic spacer region and its flanking 23s rrna.
AB  == rapid and reliable two-step multiplex polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assays were established to identify human intestinal lactobacilli; a multiplex pcr was used for grouping of lactobacilli with a mixture of group-specific primers followed by four multiplex pcr assays with four sorts of species-specific primer mixtures for identification at the species level. primers used were designed from nucleotide sequences of the 16s-23s rrna intergenic spacer region and its flanking 23s rrna  gene of members of the genus lactobacillus which are commonly isolated from human stool specimens: lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus delbrueckii (ssp. bulgaricus and ssp. lactis), lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus jensenii, lactobacillus paracasei (ssp. paracasei and ssp. tolerans), lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus rhamnosus and lactobacillus salivarius (ssp. salicinius and ssp. salivarius). the established two-step multiplex pcr assays were applied  to the identification of 84 lactobacillus strains isolated from human stool specimens and the pcr results were consistent with the results from the dna-dna hybridization assay. these results suggest that the multiplex pcr system established in this study is a simple, rapid and reliable method for the identification of common lactobacillus isolates from human stool samples.
