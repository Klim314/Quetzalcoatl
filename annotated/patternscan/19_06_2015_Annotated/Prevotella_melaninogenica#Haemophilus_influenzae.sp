TI  == chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma-associated proteobacteria, but not commensal prevotella spp., promote toll-like receptor 2-independent lung inflammation and pathology.
AB  == recent studies of healthy human airways have revealed colonization by a distinct  commensal bacterial microbiota containing gram-negative prevotella spp. however,  the immunological properties of these bacteria in the respiratory system remain unknown. here we compare the innate respiratory immune response to three gram-negative commensal prevotella strains (prevotella melaninogenica, prevotella nanceiensis and prevotella salivae) and three gram-negative pathogenic proteobacteria known to colonize lungs of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) and asthma (haemophilus influenzae b, non-typeable haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis). the commensal prevotella spp.  and pathogenic proteobacteria were found to exhibit intrinsic differences in innate inflammatory capacities on murine lung cells in vitro. in vivo in mice, non-typeable h. influenzae induced severe toll-like receptor 2 (tlr2)-independent copd-like inflammation characterized by predominant airway neutrophilia, expression of a neutrophilic cytokine/chemokine profile in lung tissue, and lung  immunopathology. in comparison, p. nanceiensis induced a diminished neutrophilic  airway inflammation and no detectable lung pathology. interestingly, the inflammatory airway response to the gram-negative bacteria p. nanceiensis was completely tlr2-dependent. these findings demonstrate weak inflammatory properties of gram-negative airway commensal prevotella spp. that may make colonization by these bacteria tolerable by the respiratory immune system.

TI  == molecular mapping to species level of the tonsillar crypt microbiota associated with health and recurrent tonsillitis.
AB  == the human palatine tonsils, which belong to the central antigen handling sites of the mucosal immune system, are frequently affected by acute and recurrent infections. this study compared the microbiota of the tonsillar crypts in children and adults affected by recurrent tonsillitis with that of healthy adults and children with tonsillar hyperplasia. an in-depth 16s rrna gene based pyrosequencing approach combined with a novel strategy that included phylogenetic analysis and detection of species-specific sequence signatures enabled identification of the major part of the microbiota to species level. a complex microbiota consisting of between 42 and 110 taxa was demonstrated in both children and adults. this included a core microbiome of 12 abundant genera found  in all samples regardless of age and health status. yet, haemophilus influenzae,  neisseria species, and streptococcus pneumoniae were almost exclusively detected  in children. in contrast, streptococcus pseudopneumoniae was present in all samples. obligate anaerobes like porphyromonas, prevotella, and fusobacterium were abundantly present in children, but the species diversity of porphyromonas and prevotella was larger in adults and included species that are considered putative pathogens in periodontal diseases, i.e. porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, and tannerella forsythia. unifrac analysis showed that recurrent tonsillitis is associated with a shift in the microbiota of the tonsillar crypts. fusobacterium necrophorum, streptococcus intermedius and prevotella melaninogenica/histicola were associated with recurrent tonsillitis in adults, whereas species traditionally associated with acute tonsillitis like pyogenic streptococci and staphylococcus aureus were scarce. the findings suggest that recurrent tonsillitis is a polymicrobial infection in which interactions within consortia of taxa play an etiologic role. the study contributes to the human microbiome data, to the understanding of the etiology of infections affecting the tonsils, and forms a basis for further insight into the consequences of the intense microbe-host interactions that take place in the tonsils.

TI  == human serum activity of telithromycin, azithromycin and amoxicillin/clavulanate against common aerobic and anaerobic respiratory pathogens.
AB  == telithromycin is a new ketolide antimicrobial with a good in vitro activity against both aerobic and anaerobic respiratory pathogens. in this study, we evaluated the antibacterial activity over time of telithromycin (800mg), azithromycin (500mg), and amoxicillin/clavulanate (875/125mg) in serum following  single oral doses of these agents to 10 healthy subjects. inhibitory and bactericidal titers were determined at 2, 6, 12, and 24h after each dose and the  median titer was used to determine antibacterial activity. against two azithromycin-resistant strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, both telithromycin (mic=0.25 and 0.5 microg/ml) and amoxicillin/clavulanate exhibited inhibitory and cidal activity for at least 6h. all three antibiotics provided prolonged (>or=12h) inhibitory activity against strains of hemophilus influenzae (telithromycin mic=4.0 microg/ml). both telithromycin and amoxicillin/clavulanate exhibited rapid and prolonged inhibitory activity (>or=12h) against each of the anaerobes studied (finegoldia [peptostreptococcus] magna peptostreptococcus micros, prevotella bivia, and prevotella melaninogenica). moreover, both agents provided bactericidal activity against both prevotella species. in this ex vivo pharmacodynamic study, we found that telithromycin provided rapid and prolonged antibacterial activity in serum against macrolide-resistant strains of s. pneumoniae, beta-lactamase-positive and -negative strains of h. influenzae, and common respiratory anaerobic pathogens. these findings suggest that telithromycin could have clinical utility in the treatment of community-acquired mixed aerobic-anaerobic respiratory tract infections, including chronic sinusitis and aspiration pneumonia.

TI  == [yearly changes in antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates between 1996 and 2001--ii. gram-negative bacteria].
AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2001 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems and carbapenems. a total of 3,245 strains in 32 species of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from january to december, and consisted of moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii, citrobacter koseri, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabillis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia spp. (p. alcalifaciens, p. rettgeri, p. stuartii), pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas putida, burkholderia cepacia, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, haemophilus influenzae, acinetobactor baumannii, acinetobactor lwoffii, bacteroides fragilis  group (b. fragilis, b. vulgatus, b. distasonis, b. ovatus, b. thetaiotaomicron),  and prevotella spp. (p. melaninogenica, p. intermedia, p. bivia, p. oralis, p. denticola). czop possessed stable antibacterial activities against m. (b.) catarrhalis, e. coli, c. freundii, c. koseri, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, e. aerogenes, e. cloacae, s. marcescens, p. mirabilis, p. vulgaris, m. morganii, providencia spp., p. aeruginosa, and a. lwoffii throughout 6 years. the mic90 of  czop against those strains were consistent with those obtained from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. on the other hand, the mic90 of czop against h. influenzae yearly obviously increased with approximately 64-time difference during the study period. the mic90 of cefpirome, cefepime, and flomoxef against h. influenzae also yearly tended to rise. the present results demonstrated that czop had maintained the antibacterial activity against almost gram-negative strains tested. however, the decrease in antibacterial activities of czop against b. cepacia, and h. influenzae was suggested.

TI  == bactericidal activities of methoxyfluoroquinolones gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin  against aerobic and anaerobic respiratory pathogens in serum.
AB  == gatifloxacin (bristol-myers squibb) and moxifloxacin (bayer) are new methoxyfluoroquinolones with broad-spectrum activity against aerobic and anaerobic pathogens of the respiratory tract. in this investigation, we analyzed  the bactericidal activity in serum over time of these antimicrobials against three aerobic (streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, and staphylococcus aureus) and four anaerobic (peptostreptococcus micros, peptostreptococcus magnus, fusobacterium nucleatum, and prevotella melaninogenica) bacteria associated with respiratory tract infections. serum samples were obtained from 11 healthy male subjects following a single 400-mg oral dose of gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin. these samples were collected prior to and at 2, 6, 12, and 24 h after the dose of each drug. gatifloxacin exhibited bactericidal activity for a median of 12 h against streptococcus pneumoniae (mic  = 0.5 micro g/ml), peptostreptococcus micros (mic = 0.25 micro g/ml), and f. nucleatum (mic = 0.5 micro g/ml) and 24 h against h. influenzae (mic = 0.03 micro g/ml), staphylococcus aureus (mic = 0.125 micro g/ml), peptostreptococcus magnus  (mic = 0.125 micro g/ml), and prevotella melaninogenica (mic = 0.5 micro g/ml). moxifloxacin exhibited bactericidal activity for a median of 24 h against streptococcus pneumoniae (mic = 0.125 micro g/ml), h. influenzae (mic = 0.015 micro g/ml), staphylococcus aureus (mic = 0.06 micro g/ml), f. nucleatum (mic = 0.5 micro g/ml), prevotella melaninogenica (mic =0.5 micro g/ml), peptostreptococcus magnus (mic = 0.125 micro g/ml), and peptostreptococcus micros (mic = 0.25 micro g/ml). the results from this pharmacodynamic study suggest that these fluoroquinolones would have prolonged killing activity against these organisms in vivo and may have clinical utility in the treatment of mixed aerobic-anaerobic respiratory tract infections.

(b.) catarrhalis, e. coli, c. freundii, c. koseri, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, e. aerogenes, e. cloacae, s. marcescens, p. mirabilis, p. vulgaris, m. morganii, providencia spp., p. aeruginosa, and a. lowffii throughout 5 years. the mic90 of czop against those strains were consistent with those obtained from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. on the other hand, the mic90 of czop against h. influenzae  yearly obviously increased with approximately 65-time difference during study period. the mic90 of cefpirome, cefepime, and flomoxef against h. influenzae also yearly tended to rise. the present results demonstrated that czop had maintained  the antibacterial activity against almost gram-negative strains tested. however,  the decrease in the antibacterial activity of czop against h. influenzae was suggested.

TI  == cleavage of a recombinant human immunoglobulin a2 (iga2)-iga1 hybrid antibody by  certain bacterial iga1 proteases.
AB  == to understand more about the factors influencing the cleavage of immunoglobulin a1 (iga1) by microbial iga1 proteases, a recombinant human iga2/iga1 hybrid molecule was generated. in the hybrid, termed iga2/a1 half hinge, a seven-amino-acid sequence corresponding to one half of the duplicated sequence making up the iga1 hinge was incorporated into the equivalent site in iga2. insertion of the iga1 half hinge into iga2 did not affect antigen binding capacity or the functional activity of the hybrid molecule, as judged by its ability to bind to iga fcalpha receptors and trigger respiratory bursts in neutrophils. although the iga2/a1 hybrid contained only half of the iga1 hinge, it was found to be cleaved by a variety of different bacterial iga1 proteases, including representatives of those that cleave iga1 in the different duplicated halves of the hinge, namely, those of prevotella melaninogenica, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. sanguis, neisseria meningitidis types 1 and 2, n. gonorrhoeae types 1 and 2, and haemophilus influenzae type 2. thus, for these enzymes the recognition site for iga1 cleavage is contained within half of the iga1 hinge region; additional distal elements, if required, are provided by either an iga1 or an iga2 framework. in contrast, the iga2/a1 hybrid appeared to be resistant to cleavage with s. oralis and some h. influenzae type 1 iga1 proteases, suggesting  these enzymes require additional determinants for efficient substrate recognition.

TI  == bacterial interference in the nasopharynx following antimicrobial therapy of acute otitis media.
AB  == the effect on the nasopharyngeal bacterial flora of therapy for 10 days with co-amoxiclav or cefprozil was studied in 50 children with acute otitis media. before therapy, potential pathogens (streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis) were isolated in 14 (56%) of those treated  with co-amoxiclav and 15 (60%) of those treated with cefprozil. following therapy, the reduction in the number of these pathogens was the same in the two groups. however, differences between the groups were noted in the recovery of organisms with interfering capability, namely alpha-haemolytic streptococci, peptostreptococcus anaerobius and prevotella melaninogenica. fifty interfering organisms were recovered from each group before therapy. after therapy with co-amoxiclav or cefprozil their number declined to 11 and 42, respectively (p< 0.001).

TI  == enhancement of growth of group a beta-hemolytic streptococci in mixed infections  with aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == objective: to evaluate the potential for mutual enhancement of growth of group a  beta-hemolytic streptococci (gabhs), and 11 commonly associated aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms frequently isolated in tonsillar infections. methods: enhancement was assessed by measuring the relative increase in colony-forming units (cfu) of gabhs and each of the 11 microorganisms inducing a subcutaneous abscess in mice. results: of the 11 combinations of gabhs and aerobe or anaerobe, gabhs was enhanced in 10 cases and the other microorganism in 5, namely, staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus influenzae type b, klebsiella pneumoniae, prevotella melaninogenica and bacteroides fragilis. conclusions: these findings confirm the mutual symbiotic enhancement of growth of gabhs in the presence of other aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.

TI  == quantitative bacteriology of tonsils removed from children with tonsillitis hypertrophy and recurrent tonsillitis with and without hypertrophy.
AB  == the aerobic and anaerobic bacterial species and their numbers were studied in tonsillar specimens from children who had undergone elective tonsillectomy: 6 patients with recurrent tonsillitis (rt), 9 with recurrent tonsillitis with hypertrophy (rth), and 8 with obstructive tonsillar hypertrophy (oth). mixed flora were present in all tonsils, yielding an average of 6.7 isolates (5.6 aerobic or facultative and 1.1 anaerobic bacteria). the highest recovery rate of  organisms per tonsil was in patients with oth (7.7 per tonsil), compared to 6.3 per tonsil in rt and 5.9 per tonsil in rth. the predominant aerobic and facultative organisms were haemophilus influenzae (22 isolates), neisseria sp (16), staphylococcus aureus (14), and eikenella corrodens (14), and the predominant anaerobic bacteria were fusobacterium sp (8), bacteroides sp (7), and prevotella melaninogenica (5). the number of bacteria per gram of tonsillar tissue varied between 10(4) and 10(8). a higher concentration of s aureus and h influenzae was found in hypertrophic tonsils (rth and oth) as compared to rt. these findings suggest the presence of an increased bacterial load and supports an etiologic role for h influenzae and s aureus in hypertrophic tonsils with and  without inflammation (rth and oth). further studies to elucidate the effect of selective antimicrobial therapy directed at these organisms may offer an alternative management of hypertrophic tonsils.

TI  == bacteriologic findings in peritonsillar abscesses in young adults.
AB  == aspirated pus samples from 124 patients with peritonsillar abscess were cultured  quantitatively for aerobes and anaerobes. a total of 98% of the samples yielded bacteria. of the 550 isolates obtained (mean, 4.4 per patient), 143 were aerobes  (representing 16 species or groups) and 407 were anaerobes (representing 40 species or groups). aerobes were isolated from 86% of patients-alone in 20 cases  and together with anaerobes in 87. the most common aerobic isolates were streptococcus pyogenes (isolated from 45% of patients), streptococcus milleri group organisms (27%), haemophilus influenzae (11%), and viridans streptococci (11%). anaerobes were isolated from 82% of the samples and as a sole finding from 15 abscesses. fusobacterium necrophorum and prevotella melaninogenica were both isolated from 38% of patients, prevotella intermedia from 32%, peptostreptococcus micros from 27%, fusobacterium nucleatum from 26%, and actinomyces odontolyticus  from 23%. the rate of previous tonsillar/peritonsillar infections was lowest (25%) among patients infected with s. pyogenes and highest (52%) among those infected with f. necrophorum (p < .01). recurrences and/or related tonsillectomies were more common among patients infected with f. necrophorum than among those infected with s. pyogenes (57% vs. 19%; p < .0001) or with s. milleri group organisms (43% vs. 19%; p < .05). beta-lactamase was produced by only 38% of the 73 isolates of prevotella species tested; however, 56% of the 36 patients  studied harbored one or more such strains.

TI  == significance of encapsulated bacteroides melaninogenicus and bacteroides fragilis groups in mixed infections.
AB  == organisms of the bacteroides melaninogenicus and bacteroides fragilis groups are  often found mixed with facultatively anaerobic organisms in infections. the relative importance of these bacteroides groups and facultative anaerobic pathogens in mixed infections was investigated in a subcutaneous abscess model in mice. this was determined by observing the effect of antimicrobial therapy directed against one or both organisms present in the abscess. clindamycin or metronidazole was used for treatment of infections caused by bacteroides species, and either gentamicin, penicillin, ampicillin, or oxacillin was used for treatment of infections caused by facultative flora. in almost all instances the  aerobic counterparts in the infection were more important than the unencapsulated bacteroides species. on the other hand, encapsulated b. melaninogenicus group organisms were found to be more important in abscess formation than were group a  streptococci, streptococcus pneumoniae, klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, and staphylococcus aureus. encapsulated b. fragilis group organisms were found to be more important than or as important as escherichia coli and group d streptococci and less important than s. aureus, group a streptococci, and k. pneumoniae in induction of subcutaneous abscesses. this study demonstrates that encapsulated bacteroides species are a factor that should be considered in the treatment of mixed infections with antibiotics.

TI  == pathogenicity of encapsulated bacteroides melaninogenicus group, b. oralis and b. ruminicola subsp. brevis in abscesses in mice.
AB  == the pathogenicity of 27 clinical isolates of the bacteroides melaninogenicus (bm) group and four clinical isolates of b. oralis and b. ruminicola subsp. brevis were investigated by inoculating them into mice and subsequently determining their ability to cause subcutaneous (sc) or intraperitoneal abscesses. only 11 isolates of bm group and one b. ruminicola induced abscesses in mice, and all were found to be heavily encapsulated on recovery from the abscesses (more than 50 per cent of the organisms were encapsulated). when the other 23 isolates, however, were injected sc in combination with either klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, staphylococcus  aureus or streptococcus pyogenes, abscesses were formed in 16 of the 23 combinations. the bacteroides spp. recovered from the mixed infection were heavily encapsulated. capsules also formed in bacteroides if the organisms were injected together with capsular material or formalin killed cells of k. pneumoniae or encapsulated bacteroides sp. once non-encapsulated or only slightly encapsulated strains acquired a capsule, they could induce abscesses on reinoculation into mice.

TI  == should fiberoptic bronchoscopy aspirates be cultured?
AB  == the reliability of fiberoptic bronchoscopy as a method to study the bacteriology  of the lower respiratory tract was tested. the procedure used was suction aspiration through the inner channel after topical anesthesia with lidocaine. to  detect contamination by oropharyngeal bacteria, the aspirates were cultured in patients with no evidence of active infection, comparison was made with results of transtracheal aspiration cultures, and the aspirate was tested for the presence of an oral dye marker. results with all 3 methods of analysis indicated  contamination with oropharyngeal bacteria that were presumably introduced during  instrumentation through the upper airways. an additional factor studied was the effect of topical anesthetics. analysis of aspirates showed that as much as 96 per cent of the specimen was anesthetic solution. lidocaine also proved toxic to  lower respiratory tract pathogens, although there were significant differences between bacterial species. it was concluded that fiberoptic bronchoscopy as performed in this study does not reliably reflect the bacteriology of the lower respiratory tract.
