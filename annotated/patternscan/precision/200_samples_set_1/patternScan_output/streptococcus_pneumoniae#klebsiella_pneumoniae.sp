TI  == [analysis on the sensitivity to beta-lactam antibiotics of respiratory-infectious isolates on the second survey on the sensitivity of isolates conducted by the japanese society of chemotherapy in 2007--concerning the aspect of pk/pd break points].
AB  == sensitivity to beta-lactam antibiotics of isolates clinically obtained from respiratory infection sites in adults on the second survey on sensitivity of isolates conducted by the japanese society of chemotherapy in 2007 was investigated according to the classification of the "guideline for treatment for  adult nosocomial pneumonia in 2008". among the primary antibacterial drugs for mild (a) and moderate (b) nosocomial pneumonia in adults, beta-lactam antibiotics; ceftriaxone (ctrx), sulbactam/ampicillin (sbt/abpc), panipenem/betamipron (papm/bp), tazobactam/piperacillin (taz/pipc), imipenem/cilastatin (ipm/cs), meropenem (mepm), doripenem (drpm), biapenem (bipm) were studied to evaluate their clinical efficacy. the covering rate was analyzed  using the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) and break point of pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (pk/pd). consequently, the results with methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa), streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis and klebsiella pneumoniae revealed  the mic90 of all antibacterial drugs to be at low levels, while almost 100% of isolates were within the range of pk/pd break points except bipm and sbt/abpc to  h. influenzae, and sbt/abpc to k. pneumoniae. however, the analysis of p. aeruginosa didn't reach 100% for the covering rates of isolates, indicating that  these drugs did not have a complete inhibitory action to restrict bacterial proliferation. the analysis of all 5 carbapenem drugs showed superiority to taz/pipc in mic90 while covering rates of isolates at pk/pd break points showed inferiority to taz/pipc. this tendency was found to be more significant in covering the rates of isolates on the regular dose with maximal bactericidal action and on the maximum dose. this is because the maximum dose approved in japan is as low as half that in ipm/cs and 1/3 that in mepm in western countries.

TI  == in vitro activity of tigecycline against 2423 clinical isolates and comparison of the available interpretation breakpoints.
AB  == mics to tigecycline and 12 antimicrobials were performed by microdilution method, against 2423 nonduplicate pathogens recently isolated in 17 greek hospitals. the  food and drug administration (fda) and european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing (eucast) criteria were used comparatively for interpretation of tigecycline mics. tigecycline exhibited potent in vitro activity against the majority of the isolates tested. (mic(90) values of 0.5, 1,  2, 0.125, 1, 0.25, 0.125, and 1 mg/l were observed for escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter spp., moraxella catarrhalis, acinetobacter spp., staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus spp., and streptococcus pneumoniae isolates, respectively.) tigecycline activity was the same, irrespective of the resistance profile to other antimicrobials (gram-negative pathogens susceptible or resistant to imipenem, enterococcus spp., s. aureus, or s. pneumoniae isolates, susceptible or resistant to vancomycin, methicillin or penicillin, respectively). interpretation using eucast and fda breakpoints differed among isolates of k. pneumoniae and enterobacter spp. having tigecycline mics of 2 to 4 mg/l. in conclusion, tigecycline exhibited potent activity against pathogens recently isolated in a region that experiences high antimicrobial resistance rates. indications that the available criteria might categorize differently tigecycline susceptibility status in k. pneumoniae and enterobacter spp. isolates were also detected.

TI  == tigecycline in combination with other antimicrobials: a review of in vitro, animal and case report studies.
AB  == tigecycline has been investigated in combination with other antibacterials against a wide range of susceptible and multiresistant gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. combinations have been analysed in vitro, in animal models and in human case reports. in vitro, tigecycline combined with other antimicrobials produces primarily an indifferent response (neither synergy nor antagonism). nevertheless, synergy occurred when tigecycline was combined with rifampicin against 64-100% of enterococcus spp., streptococcus pneumoniae, enterobacter spp. and brucella melitensis isolates. combinations of tigecycline with amikacin also showed synergy for 40-100% of enterobacter spp., klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus spp. and stenotrophomonas maltophilia isolates. moreover, bactericidal synergisms occurred with tigecycline plus amikacin against problematic acinetobacter baumannii and proteus vulgaris, and with colistin against k. pneumoniae. data from animal experiments and case reports, although limited, displayed consistent beneficial activity of tigecycline in combination with other antibacterials against multiresistant organisms, including vancomycin  against penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae in experimental meningitis, gentamicin against pseudomonas aeruginosa in experimental pneumonia, daptomycin against enterococcus faecium endocarditis, and colistin against k. pneumoniae bacteraemia and p. aeruginosa osteomyelitis. antagonism was extremely rare in vitro and was not reported in vivo. thus, tigecycline may be combined with a second antimicrobial as part of a combination regimen.

TI  == in vivo pharmacodynamics of ceftobiprole against multiple bacterial pathogens in  murine thigh and lung infection models.
AB  == ceftobiprole medocaril is the parenteral prodrug of ceftobiprole, a novel pyrrolidinone broad-spectrum cephalosporin with in vitro and in vivo bactericidal activities against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae (prsp). we have used murine thigh and lung infection models in neutropenic and normal mice to characterize the in vivo pharmacokinetic (pk)-pharmacodynamic (pd) activities of ceftobiprole against multiple strains of s. aureus (including mrsa), s. pneumoniae (including prsp), and gram-negative bacilli. serum levels of ceftobiprole following the administration of multiple doses were determined by a microbiological assay. in vivo bactericidal activities and postantibiotic effects (paes) of ceftobiprole against mrsa and prsp strains were determined from serial cfu/thigh values following single doses of ceftobiprole (40 and 160 mg/kg of body weight). dose fractionation studies were used to determine which pk-pd index correlated best with activity. magnitudes of the pk-pd indices were calculated from mics and pk parameters. a sigmoid dose-response model was used to estimate the dose (mg/kg/24 h) required to achieve a static and 2-log(10) kill effects over 24 h. pk results  showed area under the concentration-time curve/dose values of 1.8 to 2.8 and half-lives of 0.29 to 0.51 h. mics ranged from 0.015 to 2 microg/ml. ceftobiprole demonstrated time-dependent killing; its in vivo paes varied from 3.8 h to 4.8 h  for mrsa and from 0 to 0.8 h for prsp. the time above mic (t > mic) correlated best with efficacy for both mrsa and prsp. the t > mic values required for the static doses were significantly longer (p < 0.001) for enterobacteriaceae (36 to  45%) than for s. aureus (14 to 28%) and s. pneumoniae (15 to 22%). the drug showed activities in the lung model similar to those in the thigh model. the presence of neutrophils significantly enhanced the activity of ceftobiprole against s. pneumoniae but only slightly against klebsiella pneumoniae. based on its pd profile, ceftobiprole is a promising new beta-lactam agent with activity against gram-negative and gram-positive organisms including mrsa and prsp.

TI  == in vivo evaluation of a dual-action antibacterial, ro 23-9424, compared to cefotaxime and fleroxacin.
AB  == the dual-action antibacterial r 23-9424 (desacetylcefotaxime linked to the quinolone fleroxacin) is a new antibacterial agent with excellent in vitro activity. it was evaluated for in vivo efficacy in comparison with the cephalosporin cefotaxime and the quinolone component, fleroxacin. ro 23-9424 demonstrated significant activity against all strains tested in systemic infections, including those strains resistant in vivo to cefotaxime (staphylococcus aureus 753, serratia marcescens sm and pseudomonas aeruginosa 8780) and fleroxacin (streptococcus pneumoniae 6301 and streptococcus pyogenes. in prophylactic studies, ro 23-9424 compared favorably with fleroxacin against escherichia coli and with cefotaxime against s. pyogenes, but ro 23-9424 was considerably more active than cefotaxime against e. coli and more active than fleroxacin against s. pyogenes. in a murine pneumonia model, ro 23-9424 was equivalent in activity to cefotaxime against s. pneumoniae and more active than cefotaxime against klebsiella pneumoniae. fleroxacin was inactive against s. pneumoniae and about 20-fold more active than ro 23-9424 against k. pneumoniae. in a murine meningitis infection caused by s. pneumoniae, ro 23-9424 was 3 times  as active as cefotaxime, while fleroxacin was inactive. when meningitis was induced by k. pneumoniae, ro 23-9424 was as active as the quinolone, while cefotaxime was inactive. in a neutropenic (immunocompromised) model, ro 23-9424 was more active than cefotaxime against p. aeruginosa and 5-fold less active than fleroxacin. in the control normal (immunocompetent) mouse infection, ro 23-9424 was 3-fold more active than cefotaxime, but 10-fold less active than fleroxacin.

TI  == cerebrospinal fluid glucose and leukocyte responses in experimental meningitis.
AB  == the fall in cerebrospinal fluid (csf) glucose and csf leukocyte response was studied in cats with experimental meningitis. klebsiella pneumoniae or streptococcus pneumoniae were injected intracisternally, and the latter organisms were incubated with csf in vitro. when 10(6)-10(9)k. pneumoniae were incubated with 4 ml of csf, the time time necessary for the glucose to decrease to less than 10 mg/dl ranged from 6.5 to 2.5 h, at a rate proportional to the size of the inoculum. when the same numbers of bacteria were injected intracisternally, the time ranged from 9 to 3 h, and the csf leukocyte response did not exceed 1200 wbc/mm3. at this time, only minimal histological changes in brain and choroid plexus were seen. twenty hours after intrathecal k. pneumoniae, large numbers of  leukocytes (up to 4 x 10(4)/mm3) were recovered from the csf. regardless of the number of leukocytes, however, hypoglycorrhachia occurred when the csf contained  more than 10(7) bacteria/ml. at this interval, large numbers of leukocytes were seen invading the stroma of the choroid plexus, leptomeninges and perivascular spaces. when 10(8) s. pneumoniae were injected intracisternally, csf glucose concentration decreased as rapidly as with k. pneumoniae. the spinal fluid leukocyte response to s. pneumoniae was, however, greater than that to k. pneumoniae. these results suggest that under the conditions of these studies, hypoglycorrhachia of bacterial meningitis is the result of metabolism of the bacteria with little contribution from the leukocytes.
