TI  - Role of probiotics in the prevention and treatment of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections.
AB  - Meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a multidrug-resistant micro-organism and is the principal nosocomial pathogen worldwide. Following initial in vitro experiments demonstrating that Lactobacillus acidophilus CL1285((R)) and Lactobacillus casei LBC80R((R)) commercial strains exhibit antibacterial activity against clinical MRSA isolates, we conducted a literature search to find any evidence of probiotic efficacy in decolonisation or treatment of S. aureus infection. As summarised below, many strains of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria isolated from a variety of sources inhibited the growth of S. aureus and clinical isolates of MRSA in vitro. The most active strains were Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Propionibacterium freudenreichii, Propionibacterium acnes, Lactobacillus paracasei, L. acidophilus, L. casei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Lactobacillus fermentum and Lactococcus lactis. Their effects were mediated both by direct cell competitive exclusion as well as production of acids or bacteriocin-like inhibitors. L. acidophilus also inhibited S. aureus biofilm formation and lipase production. In vitro antimicrobial activity did not necessarily assure efficacy in vivo in animal infectious models, e.g. S. aureus 8325-4 was most sensitive in vitro to L. acidophilus, whilst in vivo Bifidobacterium bifidum best inhibited experimental intravaginal staphylococcosis in mice. On the other hand, L. plantarum, which showed the highest inhibition activity against S. aureus in vitro, was also very effective topically in preventing skin wound infection with S. aureus in mice. Very few clinical data were found on the interactions between probiotics and MRSA, but the few identified clinical cases pointed to the feasibility of elimination or reduction of MRSA colonisation with probiotic use.
TI  - The genome sequence of Propionibacterium acidipropionici provides insights into its biotechnological and industrial potential.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Synthetic biology allows the development of new biochemical pathways  for the production of chemicals from renewable sources. One major challenge is the identification of suitable microorganisms to hold these pathways with sufficient robustness and high yield. In this work we analyzed the genome of the propionic acid producer Actinobacteria Propionibacterium acidipropionici (ATCC 4875). RESULTS: The assembled P. acidipropionici genome has 3,656,170 base pairs (bp) with 68.8% G + C content and a low-copy plasmid of 6,868 bp. We identified 3,336 protein coding genes, approximately 1000 more than P. freudenreichii and P. acnes, with an increase in the number of genes putatively involved in maintenance of genome integrity, as well as the presence of an invertase and genes putatively involved in carbon catabolite repression. In addition, we made an experimental confirmation of the ability of P. acidipropionici to fix CO2, but no phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase coding gene was found in the genome. Instead, we identified the pyruvate carboxylase gene and confirmed the presence of the corresponding enzyme in proteome analysis as a potential candidate for this activity. Similarly, the phosphate acetyltransferase and acetate kinase genes, which are considered responsible for acetate formation, were not present in the genome. In P. acidipropionici, a similar function seems to be performed by an ADP forming acetate-CoA ligase gene and its corresponding enzyme was confirmed in the proteome analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Our data shows that P. acidipropionici has several of the desired features that are required to become a platform for the production of chemical commodities: multiple pathways for efficient feedstock utilization, ability to fix CO2, robustness, and efficient production of propionic acid, a potential precursor for valuable 3-carbon compounds.
TI  - The complete genome of Propionibacterium freudenreichii CIRM-BIA1, a hardy actinobacterium with food and probiotic applications.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Propionibacterium freudenreichii is essential as a ripening culture in Swiss-type cheeses and is also considered for its probiotic use. This species exhibits slow growth, low nutritional requirements, and hardiness in many habitats. It belongs to the taxonomic group of dairy propionibacteria, in contrast to the cutaneous species P. acnes. The genome of the type strain, P. freudenreichii subsp. shermanii CIRM-BIA1 (CIP 103027(T)), was sequenced with an 11-fold coverage. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The circular chromosome of 2.7 Mb of the CIRM-BIA1 strain has a GC-content of 67% and contains 22 different insertion sequences (3.5% of the genome in base pairs). Using a proteomic approach, 490 of the 2439 predicted proteins were confirmed. The annotation revealed the genetic basis for the hardiness of P. freudenreichii, as the bacterium possesses a complete enzymatic arsenal for de novo biosynthesis of aminoacids and vitamins (except panthotenate and biotin) as well as sequences involved in metabolism of various carbon sources, immunity against phages, duplicated chaperone genes and, interestingly, genes involved in the management of polyphosphate, glycogen and trehalose storage. The complete biosynthesis pathway for a bifidogenic compound is described, as well as a high number of surface proteins involved in interactions with the host and present in other probiotic bacteria. By comparative genomics, no pathogenicity factors found in P. acnes or in other pathogenic microbial species were identified in P. freudenreichii, which is consistent with the Generally Recognized As Safe and Qualified Presumption of Safety status of P. freudenreichii. Various pathways for formation of cheese flavor compounds were identified: the Wood-Werkman cycle for propionic acid formation, amino acid degradation pathways resulting in the formation of volatile branched chain fatty acids, and esterases involved in the formation of free fatty acids and esters. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: With the exception of its ability to degrade lactose, P. freudenreichii seems poorly adapted to dairy niches. This genome annotation opens up new prospects for the understanding of the P. freudenreichii probiotic activity.
TI  - Safety assessment of dairy microorganisms: Propionibacterium and Bifidobacterium.
AB  - The genera Propionibacterium and Bifidobacterium are clustered in the class Actinobacteria and form the anaerobic branch of coryneform bacteria. The dairy propionibacteria comprising four species P. freudenreichii, P. acidipropionici, P. jensenii and P. thoenii are industrially important as starter cultures in hard-cheese ripening and recently also as protective bio-preservatives and probiotics. These four species are considered as safe whereas cutaneous Propionibacterium species (also named "acnes group") are pathogens. In contrast, bifidobacteria in fermented dairy products and milk powder are exclusively used as probiotics; selected strains of several species (out of more than thirty) contribute to this task. It has been only rarely found that commensal bifidobacteria have been connected with certain dental and other infections. Consequently, only one single species, Bifidobacterium dentium, is recognized as pathogenic. Genome sequence analysis of Bifidobacterium longum and molecular biological analysis of other probiotic strains confirmed so far the absence of virulence and pathogenecity factors. However, tetracycline resistance genes tet(W), although probably not easy transferable, were found in Bifidobacterium strains, also in Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis, the worldwide most used industrial strain. Conclusively, strains from the Propionibacterium and Bifidobacterium species in dairy food generally represent so far no health hazards.
TI  - Isolation of aminopeptidase N genes of food associated propionibacteria and observation of their transcription in skim milk and acid whey.
AB  - In this study consensus oligonucleotides PN5/PN3 were designed by aligning the aminopeptidase N genes (pepN) of various actinobacteria and applied to the isolation of the pepN genes of dairy propionibacteria (PAB) and closely related species associated with food. This allowed sequencing of a pepN gene region from Propionibacterium jensenii LMG 16541. The sequence of this gene was completed by inverse PCR. Consensus primer pairs NU1/D1 and NU2/D1 were derived from the alignment of the new sequence with its homologues in Propionibacterium acnes and other actinobacteria; these were used to start sequencing of the pepN genes of Propionibacterium freudenreichii, Propionibacterium thoenii, Propionibacterium microaerophilum, Propionibacterium acidipropionici, Propioni bacterium cyclohexanicum and Propionibacterium microaerophilum. Reverse transcription coupled with PN5/PN3 and NU1/D1 PCR tests indicated that the pepN genes of P. jensenii and P. freudenreichii are expressed during growth in skim milk and acid whey.
TI  - Inter- and intrageneric relationships of the genus Propionibacterium as determined by 16S rRNA sequences.
AB  - The intra- and intergeneric position of Propionibacterium was determined by comparing reverse transcriptase sequences of 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid. Propionibacterium jensenii. P. thoenii and P. acidipropionici formed a phylogenetically tight cluster, while P. freudenreichii, P. acnes and P. propionicus were as remotely related among each other as each of them was to the first three species. The genus Propionibacterium represents a well defined taxon that stands isolated among other major groups of the actinomycetes. Its phylogenetic neighbours are the genera Nocardioides and Terrabacter.
TI  - Ischaemic mouse thigh model for evaluation of pathogenicity of non-clostridial anaerobes.
AB  - A mouse thigh model has been devised in which the growing culture of non-clostridial anaerobe in the ischaemic tissue produces inflammatory swelling and death. The swelling of the right thigh served as an index of pathogenicity of the test strain in comparison to the negatively reacting left thigh which received injection of the control strain of Bifidobacterium infantis. Actinomyces naeslundii exceptionally caused death in all animals within 24 h. Mortality and thigh swelling were pronounced (greater than 75%) in case of Fusobacterium gonidiaformans and Propionibacterium acnes but less (less than 50%) in Acidaminococcus fermentans. High (less than 75%) rate of thigh swelling was also encountered in case of Bacteroides oralis, Bacteroides corrodens, Fusobacterium necrophorum, Fusobacterium prausnitzii, Fusobacterium plauti, Peptococcus prevotii, Streptococcus intermedius, Eubacterium lentum and Propionibacterium freudenreichii ss. shermanii.
TI  - Role of respiratory-burst products from polymorphonuclear leukocytes in the antitumor activity of Propionibacterium acnes vaccine.
AB  - Tumor cells injected into Balb/c mice together with heat-killed 48-h P. acnes cells were rendered nontumorigenic as early as 12 h after injection, as determined by the inability of the tumor cells to give rise to tumors when transferred to a new host. Determination of tumor cell antigen levels by ELISA indicated that the tumour antigens had virtually disappeared by 24 h after injection of tumor cells and P. acnes. In contrast, in control animals injected with tumor cells only, there was an initial drop in tumor antigen levels at 12 h, after which the level rose steadily and tumors developed in 7-10 days. Since the cellular exudate at 12 h was almost entirely composed of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN), we tested the ability of PMN, stimulated by phagocytosis of 48-h P. acnes cells, to produce substances toxic to tumor cells. Results indicated that the supernatant fluid from a phagocytosis mixture of PMN and P. acnes contained material toxic to tumor cells and also to Chinese hamster ovary cells. Tests with scavengers and inhibitors of oxygen-derived radicals suggested that the toxic material is either hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) or hydroxyl radicals (OH). Suspensions of 12-h P. acnes, P. acnes cells walls, P. freudenreichii, or latex beads were ineffective in preventing tumor growth, and induced little toxicity when phagocytosed. We conclude that in this test system 48-h P. acnes prevents tumor growth by stimulating the production of toxic oxygen metabolites during phagocytosis by PMN.
TI  - Production of hyaluronidase by propionibacteria from different origins.
AB  - 114 strains of anaerobic and microaerophilic coryneform bacteria from different origins were investigated for production of free extracellular hyaluronidase (hyaluronate glycanohydrolase, EC 3.2.1.36). A quantitative technique was applied measuring the release of N-acetyl-glucosamine groups from purified human potassium hyaluronate. The strains belonged to the following species: Propionibacterium acnes, P. avidum, P. granulosum, P. lymphophilum, the formerly so-called Corynebacterium parvum, P. freudenreichii subsp. freudenreichii and shermanii, P. thoenii, P. acidi-propionici, C. minutissimum, and Arachnia propionica. All together, 59 out of 114 (approximately 51.8%) tested strains showed clearly measurable hyaluronidase activities. P. acnes, the propionibacterium species most frequently found in acne vulgaris lesions, proved to be the most active species tested, 44 out of 64 (approximately 68.8%) P. acnes strains being positive. 5 strains producing hyaluronate glycanohydrolase activities of more than 60 mU/ml in thioglycollate broth cultures could be detected. P. avidum and P. granulosum strains were positive in only 45.0% and 33.3%, respectively, and their mean hyaluronidase activities were significantly lower. Differences in hyaluronidase activities of P. acnes strains isolated from acne vulgaris lesions and strains from normal human skin could not be found. The possible pathogenic role of propionibacteria hyaluronidase in acne vulgaris is discussed.
TI  - Cell wall composition and deoxyribonucleic acid similarities among the anaerobic  coryneforms, classical propionibacteria, and strains of Arachnia propionica.
AB  - Eighty strains of anaerobic coryneforms were compared with 29 strains of classical propionibacteria and 8 strains of Arachnia propionica by cell wall analysis, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) base compositions, and nucleotide sequence similarities. The anaerobic coryneforms have DNA base compositions in the range of 58 to 64% guanine + cytosine (GC) and show at least three homology groups. The largest group corresponds to organisms identified as Propionibacterium acnes and shows about 50% homology to strains in the P. avidum homology group. The third group, P. granulosum, shows low levels of similarities to the other two. All strains of anaerobic coryneforms have some combination of galactose, glucose, or mannose as cell wall sugars, and most have alanine (ala), glutamic acid (glu), glycine (gly), and l-alpha-epsilon-diaminopimelic acid (l-DAP) as amino acids of peptidoglycan. However, a few strains in the P. acnes and P. avidum homology groups have meso-DAP and minimal amounts of glycine. Two serological types, based on cell wall antigens, were found in the P. acnes homology group. One type had galactose, glucose, and mannose as cell wall sugars, the other glucose and mannose only. The classical propionibacteria have DNA base compositions in the range of 65 to 68% GC and show four homology groups which correspond closely to van Niel's classification as given in the 7th edition of Bergey's Manual. The P. jensenii group showed about 50% homology to the P. thoenii group and about 30 to 35% to the P. acidi-propionici group. The P. freudenreichii strains showed a rather lower level of similarity (8 to 25%) to the other homology groups. Most of the strains of classical propionibacteria also have some combination of galactose, glucose, or mannose as cell wall sugars and ala, glu, gly, and l-DAP as peptidoglycan amino acids, but P. shermanii and P. freudenreichii strains, which form a single homology group, have galactose, mannose, and rhamnose as cell wall sugars and ala, glu, and meso-DAP in their peptidoglycan. There is a rather low level of DNA homology (10 to 20%) between the anaerobic coryneforms and classical propionibacteria. However, the strains of A. propionica which have a GC content of 64 to 65% and form a single homology group, show no homology to either of the other two major groups.
