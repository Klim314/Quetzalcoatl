TI  == susceptibility to some antifungal drugs of vaginal lactobacilli isolated from healthy women.
AB  == samples were taken from the lateral vaginal wall of 19 healthy women. lactobacilli were isolated from ten of these women. fifty-eight lactobacillus isolates were identified as l. gasseri, l. vaginalis, l. acidophilus, l. delbrueckii spp. lactis, l. crispatus, l. plantarum, l. cellobiosus, l. jensenii, l. salivarius, l. curvatus, l. brevis and l. oris. the inhibitory effect of isoconazole and oxiconazole in 0.2, 0.1 and 0.05 microg/ml concentrations on 58 lactobacillus spp. and candida albicans (ajd 180) were investigated, using an agar diffusion method. although both antifungal drugs showed a large inhibitory effect on c. albicans, oxiconazole had a very low inhibitory effect on lactobacillus isolates. the natural resistance of lactobacilli to anti-fungal drugs may enable the development of an antifungal drug(s)/ probiotic combination  for antifungal activity and lactobacilli replacement therapy.
