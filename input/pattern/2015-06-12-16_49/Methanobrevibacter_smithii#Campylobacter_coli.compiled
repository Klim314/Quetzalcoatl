TI  - A DNA microarray for the versatile diagnosis of infectious diarrhea.
AB  - Several bacteria, viruses, and parasites cause diarrhea as coinfecting pathogens. We designed a DNA microarray comprising 60-bp probes spotted 194 times for the multiplex detection of 33 enteropathogenic bacteria and seven enteropathogenic viruses, and the archaeon Methanobrevibacter smithii was used as an internal positive control. Nine pathogen-free stool specimens were used as negative controls. One of these control specimens was further spiked with Salmonella enterica as a positive control. The microarray was then tested with 40 pathological stool specimens, comprising S. enterica (n = 30), Campylobacter jejuni (n = 4), pathogenic Escherichia coli (n = 2), and adenovirus (n = 4). M. smithii was detected in 47/49 (95.9%) specimens, no pathogen was detected in negative controls and S. enterica was identified in the S. enterica-spiked positive control. The overall specificity was 100% and the overall sensitivity was 97.5% because one S. enterica sample was missed by the microarray. The multiplexed detection of C. jejuni spiked into an adenovirus-positive stool sample gave positive results, with fluorescence values of 14.3 and 9.1, respectively. These data indicate that using the protocol developed in this article, the DNA array allows for the multiplexed detection of some enteropathogens in stool samples.
TI  - Culture-based indicators of fecal contamination and molecular microbial indicators rarely correlate with Campylobacter spp. in recreational waters.
AB  - Campylobacter spp. are the leading cause of gastroenteritis worldwide. Most human infections result from contaminated food; however, infections are also caused by recreational waterway contamination. Campylobacter culture is technically challenging and enumeration by culture-based methods is onerous. Thus, we employed qPCR to quantify Campylobacter spp. in fresh- and marine-water samples, raw sewage and animal feces. Multiplex PCR determined whether Campylobacter jejuni or C. coli, most commonly associated with human disease, were present in qPCR-positive samples. Campylobacters were detected in raw sewage, and in feces of all avian and mammalian species tested. Campylobacter-positive concentrations ranged from 68 to 2.3 x 10(6) cells per 500 mL. Although C. jejuni and C. coli were rare in waterways, they were prevalent in sewage and feces. Campylobacter-specific qPCR screening of environmental waters did not correlate with the regulatory EPA method 1600 (Enterococcus culture), nor with culture-independent, molecular-based microbial source tracking indicators, such as human polyomavirus, human Bacteroidales and Methanobrevibacter smithii. Our results suggest that neither the standard EPA method nor the newly proposed culture-independent methods are appropriate surrogates for Campylobacter contamination in water. Thus, assays for specific pathogens may be necessary to protect human health, especially in waters that are contaminated with sewage and animal feces.
