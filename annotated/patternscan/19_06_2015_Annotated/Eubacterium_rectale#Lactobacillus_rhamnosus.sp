TI  == intra-individual diversity and similarity of salivary and faecal microbiota.
AB  == in the present study, polyphasic analysis [cultivation, combined with the fingerprinting of individual isolates, and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge)] was applied to study whether similar features concerning  the diversity and temporal stability of selected bacterial groups could be detected intra-individually in two different niches - the oral cavity and the colon - from ten adult volunteers consuming probiotics. the predominant bacterial microbiota, clostridium coccoides-eubacterium rectale group and bifidobacterial populations, were generally stable in salivary and faecal samples, with the greater diversity seen in faeces. furthermore, different species predominated at  the two different sites. lactobacillus group dgge profiles were unstable, yet the intra-individual profiles from faecal and salivary samples collected at the same  time resembled each other. the ingested probiotic product did not affect the stability of the bacterial groups studied. the culture-based analysis showed that most subjects harboured identical indigenous lactobacillus genotypes in saliva and faeces (lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus paracasei and lactobacillus plantarum group). thus, identical indigenous lactobacilli were able to inhabit both ends of the orogastrointestinal tract, whereas the composition of the other bacterial groups studied varied between the  two sites.

TI  == effect of a milk formula containing probiotics on the fecal microbiota of asian infants at risk of atopic diseases.
AB  == the fecal microbiota of 37 infants with (n = 20) or without (n = 17) probiotic administration was evaluated on d 3, and at 1, 3, and 12 mo by fluorescence in situ hybridization-flow cytometry (fish-fc), pcr, and bacteriological culture methods. they represent consecutive subjects of an ongoing double-blind, placebo-controlled trial on a probiotic formula (lgg and bifidobacterium longum)  administered during the first 6 mo of life. despite varying composition in each baby, there was a general bacterial colonization pattern in the first year. bifidobacteria increased markedly (p = 0.0003) with a parallel decrease in enterobacteriaceae (p < 0.001) and bacteroides-prevotella (p = 0.005) populations. eubacterium rectale-clostridium coccoides (p < 0.001) and atopobium  (p = 0.039) groups also gradually increased. this overall pattern was unaffected  by probiotic administration (p > 0.05). b. longum (p = 0.005) and lactobacillus rhamnosus (p < 0.001) were detected more frequently in probiotic group during supplementation, but no difference after supplementation had ceased (p > 0.05). cultured lactic acid bacteria were also more numerous in the probiotic-administered babies during treatment period (log cfu/g 8.4 versus 7.4;  p = 0.035). our results indicate that supplemented strains could be detected but  did not persist in the bowel once probiotic administration had ceased.
