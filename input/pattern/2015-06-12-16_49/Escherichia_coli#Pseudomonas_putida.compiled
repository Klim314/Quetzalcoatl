TI  - Variation in bacterial ATP concentration during rapid changes in extracellular pH and implications for the activity of attached bacteria.
AB  - In this study we investigated the relationship between a rapid change in extracellular pH and the alteration of bacterial ATP concentration. This relationship is a key component of a hypothesis indicating that bacterial bioenergetics - the creation of ATP from ADP via a proton gradient across the cytoplasmic membrane - can be altered by the physiochemical charge-regulation effect, which results in a pH shift at the bacteria's surface upon adhesion to another surface. The bacterial ATP concentration was measured during a rapid change in extracellular pH from a baseline pH of 7.2 to pH values between 3.5 and 10.5. Experiments were conducted with four neutrophilic bacterial strains, including the Gram-negative Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida and the Gram-positive Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus epidermidis. A change in bulk pH produced an immediate response in bacterial ATP, demonstrating a direct link between changes in extracellular pH and cellular bioenergetics. In general, the shifts in ATP were similar across the four bacterial strains, with results following an exponential relationship between the extracellular pH and cellular ATP concentration. One exception occurred with S. epidermidis, where there was no variation in cellular ATP at acidic pH values, and this finding is consistent with this species' ability to thrive under acidic conditions. These results provide insight into obtaining a desired bioenergetic response in bacteria through (i) the application of chemical treatments to vary the local pH and (ii) the selection and design of surfaces resulting in local pH modification of attached bacteria via the charge-regulation effect.
TI  - Structural and kinetic characterization of recombinant 2-hydroxymuconate semialdehyde dehydrogenase from Pseudomonas putida G7.
AB  - The first enzyme in the oxalocrotonate branch of the naphthalene-degradation lower pathway in Pseudomonas putida G7 is NahI, a 2-hydroxymuconate semialdehyde dehydrogenase which converts 2-hydroxymuconate semialdehyde to 2-hydroxymuconate in the presence of NAD+. NahI is in family 8 (ALDH8) of the NAD(P)+-dependent aldehyde dehydrogenase superfamily. In this work, we report the cloning, expression, purification and preliminary structural and kinetic characterization of the recombinant NahI. The nahI gene was subcloned into a T7 expression vector and the enzyme was overexpressed in Escherichia coli ArcticExpress as a hexa-histidine-tagged fusion protein. After purification by affinity and size-exclusion chromatography, dynamic light scattering and small-angle X-ray scattering experiments were conducted to analyze the oligomeric state and the overall shape of the enzyme in solution. The protein is a tetramer in solution and has nearly perfect 222 point group symmetry. Protein stability and secondary structure content were evaluated by a circular dichroism spectroscopy assay under different thermal conditions. Furthermore, kinetic assays were conducted and, for the first time, KM (1.3+/-0.3muM) and kcat (0.9s-1) values were determined at presumed NAD+ saturation. NahI is highly specific for its biological substrate and has no activity with salicylaldehyde, another intermediate in the naphthalene-degradation pathway.
TI  - Three Pseudomonas putida FNR Family Proteins with Different Sensitivities to O2.
AB  - The Escherichia coli Fumarate-Nitrate Reduction regulator (FNR) protein is the paradigm for bacterial O2-sensing transcription factors. However, unlike E. coli, some bacterial species possess multiple FNR proteins that presumably have evolved to fulfill distinct roles. Here, three FNR proteins (ANR, PP_3233 and PP_3287) from a single bacterial species, Pseudomonas putida KT2440, have been analyzed. Under anaerobic conditions, all three proteins had spectral properties resembling those of [4Fe-4S] proteins. The reactivity of the ANR [4Fe-4S] cluster with O2 was similar to that of E. coli FNR and during conversion to the apo-protein, via a [2Fe-2S] intermediate, cluster sulfur was retained. Like ANR, reconstituted PP_3233 and PP_3287 were converted to [2Fe-2S] forms when exposed to O2, but their [4Fe-4S] clusters reacted more slowly. Transcription from an FNR-dependent promoter with a consensus FNR-binding site in P. putida and E. coli strains expressing only one FNR protein was consistent with the in vitro responses to O2. Taken together the experimental results suggest that the local environments of the iron-sulfur clusters in the different P. putida FNR proteins influence their reactivity with O2, such that ANR resembles E. coli FNR and is highly-responsive to low concentrations of O2, whereas PP_3233 and PP_3287 have evolved to be less sensitive to O2.
TI  - The production of omega-hydroxy palmitic acid using fatty acid metabolism and cofactor optimization in Escherichia coli.
AB  - Hydroxylated fatty acids (HFAs) are used as important precursors for bulk and fine chemicals in the chemical industry. Here, to overproduce long-chain (C16-C18) fatty acids and hydroxy fatty acid, their biosynthetic pathways including thioesterase (Lreu_0335) from Lactobacillus reuteri DSM20016, beta-hydroxyacyl-ACP dehydratase (fabZ) from Escherichia coli, and a P450 system (i.e., CYP153A from Marinobacter aquaeolei VT8 and camA/camB from Pseudomonas putida ATCC17453) were overexpressed. Acyl-CoA synthase (fadD) involved in fatty acid degradation by beta-oxidation was also deleted in E. coli BW25113. The engineered E. coli FFA4 strain without the P450 system could produce 503.0 mg/l of palmitic (C16) and 508.4 mg/l of stearic (C18) acids, of which the amounts are ca. 1.6- and 2.3-fold higher than those of the wild type. On the other hand, the E. coli HFA4 strain including the P450 system for omega-hydroxylation could produce 211.7 mg/l of omega-hydroxy palmitic acid, which was 42.1 +/- 0.1 % of the generated palmitic acid, indicating that the hydroxylation reaction was the rate-determining step for the HFA production. For the maximum production of omega-hydroxy palmitic acid, NADH, i.e., an essential cofactor for P450 reaction, was overproduced by the integration of NAD+-dependent formate dehydrogenase (FDH) from Candida boidinii into E. coli chromosome and the deletion of alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH). Finally, the NADH-level-optimized E. coli strain produced 610 mg/l of omega-hydroxy palmitic acid (omega-HPA), which was almost a threefold increase in its yield compared to the same strain without NADH overproduction.
TI  - Quantitatively predicting bacterial adhesion using surface free energy determined with a spectrophotometric method.
AB  - Bacterial adhesion onto solid surfaces is of importance in a wide spectrum of problems, including environmental microbiology, biomedical research, and various industrial applications. Despite many research efforts, present thermodynamic models that rely on the evaluation of the adhesion energy are often elusive in predicting the bacterial adhesion behavior. Here, we developed a new spectrophotometric method to determine the surface free energy (SFE) of bacterial cells. The adhesion behaviors of five bacterial species, Pseudomonas putida KT2440, Salmonella Typhimurium ATCC 14028, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, and Escherichia coli DH5alpha, onto two model substratum surfaces, i.e., clean glass and silanized glass surfaces, were studied. We found that bacterial adhesion was unambiguously mediated by the SFE difference between the bacterial cells and the solid substratum. The lower the SFE difference, the higher degree of bacterial adhesion. We therefore propose the use of the SFE difference as an accurate and simple thermodynamic measure for quantitatively predicting bacterial adhesion. The methodological advance and thermodynamic simplification in the paper have implications in controlling bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation on solid surfaces.
TI  - Phenotypic knockouts of selected metabolic pathways by targeting enzymes with camel-derived nanobodies (Vs).
AB  - Surveying the dynamics of metabolic networks of Gram-negative bacteria often requires the conditional shutdown of enzymatic activities once the corresponding proteins have been produced. We show that given biochemical functions can be entirely suppressed in vivo with camel antibodies (VHHs, nanobodies) that target active sites of cognate enzymes expressed in the cytoplasm. As a proof of principle, we raised VHHs against 2,5-dihydroxypyridine dioxygenase (NicX) of Pseudomonas putida, involved in nicotinic acid metabolism. Once fused to a thioredoxin domain, the corresponding nanobodies inhibited the enzyme both in Escherichia coli and in P. putida cells, which then accumulated the metabolic substrate of NicX. VHHs were further engineered to track the antigen in vivo by C-terminal fusion to a fluorescent protein. Conditional expression of the resulting VHHs allows simultaneously to track and target proteins of interest and enables the design of transient phenotypes without mutating the genetic complement of the bacteria under study.
TI  - Making variability less variable: matching expression system and host for oxygenase-based biotransformations.
AB  - Variability in whole-cell biocatalyst performance represents a critical aspect for stable and productive bioprocessing. In order to investigate whether and how oxygenase-catalyzed reactions are affected by such variability issues in solvent-tolerant Pseudomonas, different inducers, expression systems, and host strains were tested for the reproducibility of xylene and styrene monooxygenase catalyzed hydroxylation and epoxidation reactions, respectively. Significantly higher activity variations were found for biocatalysts based on solvent-tolerant Pseudomonas putida DOT-TIE and S12 compared with solvent-sensitive P. putida KT2440, Escherichia coli JM101, and solvent-tolerant Pseudomonas taiwanensis VLB120. Specific styrene epoxidation rates corresponded to cellular styrene monooxygenase contents. Detected variations in activity strictly depended on the type of regulatory system employed, being high with the alk- and low with the lac-system. These results show that the occurrence of clonal variability in recombinant gene expression in Pseudomonas depends on the combination of regulatory system and host strain, does not correlate with a general phenotype such as solvent tolerance, and must be evaluated case by case.
TI  - Marine hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria as whole-cell biosensors for n-alkanes.
AB  - Whole-cell biosensors offer potentially useful, cost-effective systems for the in-situ monitoring of seawater for hydrocarbons derived from accidental spills. The present work compares the performance of a biosensor system for the detection of alkanes in seawater, hosted in either Escherichia coli (commonly employed in whole-cell biosensors but not optimized for alkane assimilation) or different marine bacteria specialized in assimilating alkanes. The sensor system was based on the Pseudomonas putida AlkS regulatory protein and the PalkB promoter fused to a gene encoding the green fluorescent protein. While the E. coli sensor provided the fastest response to pure alkanes (25-fold induction after 2 h under the conditions used), a sensor based on Alcanivorax borkumensis was slower, requiring 3-4 h to reach similar induction values. However, the A. borkumensis sensor showed a fourfold lower detection threshold for octane (0.5 muM), and was also better at sensing the alkanes present in petrol. At petrol concentrations of 0.0125%, the A. borkumensis sensor rendered a sevenfold induction, while E. coli sensor showed no response. We discuss possible explanations to this behaviour in terms of the cellular adaptations to alkane uptake and the basal fluorescence produced by each bacterial strain, which was lowest for A. borkumensis.
TI  - Improved n-butanol tolerance in Escherichia coli by controlling membrane related  functions.
AB  - As the increasing demand from both chemical and fuel markets, the interest in producing n-butanol using biological route has been rejuvenated to engineer an economical fermentation process, competing with the currently-dominant chemical synthesis. n-Butanol has been traditionally produced from the ABE fermentation of Clostridium acetobutylicum. This system, however, is not economically feasible due to its limited efficiency and the lack of genetic modification tools for further improvements. Alternatively, n-butanol synthesis pathway was successfully transferred into Escherichia coli and rapidly improved to reach a level of production comparable to the native producer. Nevertheless, the toxicity of n-butanol has become a common issue that either approach has to deal with. Previously, we reported our success in improving n-butanol tolerance in E. coli by engineering an Artificial Transcription Factor (ATF) that can modify the expression level of multiple targets simultaneously and improved the n-butanol tolerance of MG1655 strain to 1.5% (vol/vol) n-butanol. However, it was observed that some possible n-butanol tolerance mechanisms did not occurred upon the ATF expression, especially the membrane-related functions such as the homeoviscous adaptation, iron uptaking system, and efflux pump system. In this work, we attempted to enhance the n-butanol tolerance associated with the ATF by combining it with the membrane-related functions in E. coli, including the overexpression of fatty acid synthesis genes, iron-uptaking protein FeoA, and introducing a SrpABC efflux pump from Pseudomonas putida into E. coli. The synergistic effect of this combinatorial approach led to 4, 5, and 9-fold improved growths in the cultures containing 1, 1.5, and 2% (vol/vol) n-butanol, respectively, of an MG1655 knockout strain engineered for n-butanol production, and expanded the tolerance limit to 2% (vol/vol) n-butanol.
TI  - Bacterial cell surface properties: role of loosely bound extracellular polymeric  substances (LB-EPS).
AB  - This study investigated the effect of loosely bound extracellular polymeric substances (LB-EPS) on the comprehensive surface properties of four bacteria (Bacillus subtilis, Streptococcus suis, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida). The removal of LB-EPS from bacterial surfaces by high-speed centrifugation (12,000xg) was confirmed by SEM images. Viability tests showed that the percentages of viable cells ranged from 95.9% to 98.0%, and no significant difference was found after treatment (P>0.05). FTIR spectra revealed the presence of phosphodiester, carboxylic, phosphate, and amino functional groups on bacteria surfaces, and the removal of LB-EPS did not alter the types of cell surface functional groups. Potentiometric titration results suggested the total site concentrations on the intact bacteria were higher than those on LB-EPS free bacteria. Most of the acidity constants (pKa) were almost identical, except the increased pKa values of phosphodiester groups on LB-EPS free S. suis and E. coli surfaces. The electrophoretic mobilities and hydrodynamic diameters of the intact and LB-EPS free bacteria were statistically unchanged (P>0.05), indicating LB-EPS had no influence on the net surface charges and size distribution of bacteria. However, LB-ESP could enhance cell aggregation processes. The four LB-EPS free bacteria all exhibited fewer hydrophobicity values (26.1-65.0%) as compared to the intact cells (47.4-69.3%), suggesting the removal of uncharged nonpolar compounds (e.g., carbohydrates) in LB-EPS. These findings improve our understanding of the changes in cell surface characterizations induced by LB-EPS, and have important implications for assessing the role of LB-EPS in bacterial adhesion and transport behaviors.
TI  - Construction of a novel phenol synthetic pathway in Escherichia coli through 4-hydroxybenzoate decarboxylation.
AB  - Phenol is a bulk chemical with lots of applications in the chemical industry. Fermentative production of phenol had been realized in both Pseudomonas putida and Escherichia coli by recruiting tyrosine phenol-lyase (TPL). The TPL pathway needs tyrosine as the direct precursor for phenol production. In this work, a novel phenol synthetic pathway was created in E. coli by recruiting 4-hydroxybenzoate decarboxylase, which can convert 4-hydroxybenzoate to phenol and carbon dioxide. Activating 3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate-7-phosphate (DAHP) synthase and chorismate pyruvate lyase (UbiC) through plasmid overexpression led to 7- and 69-fold increase of phenol production, respectively, demonstrating that these two enzymes were the rate-limiting steps for phenol production. Genetically stable strains were then obtained by gene integration and gene modulation directly in chromosome. Phenol titer increased 147-fold (from 1.7 to 250 mg/L) after modulating the DAHP synthase, UbiC, and 4-hydroxybenzoate decarboxylase genes in chromosome. Five solvents were tested for two-phase extractive fermentation to eliminate phenol toxicity to E. coli cells. Tributyrin and dibutyl phthalate were the best two solvents for improving phenol production, leading to 23 and 30 % increase of total phenol production, respectively. Two-phase fed-batch fermentation of the best strain Phe009 was performed in a 7 L fermentor, which produced 9.51 g/L phenol with a yield of 0.061 g/g glucose.
TI  - Biosynthesis of poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyalkanoates) by recombinant Escherichia coli from glucose.
AB  - The polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) copolymers consisting of short-chain-length (scl)  and medium-chain-length (mcl) monomers have various properties ranging from stiff to flexible depending on the molar fraction of the monomer compositions. It has been reported that PhaG, which is first known as a (R)-3-hydroxyacyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP)-CoA transferase, actually functions as a 3-hydroxyacyl-ACP thioesterase, and the product of PP0763 gene from Pseudomonas putida KT2440 has a (R)-3-hydroxyacyl (3HA)-CoA ligase activity (Appl. Environ. Microbiol., 78, 519-527, 2012). In this study, we found a new (R)-3HA-CoA ligase (the product of PA3924 gene) from Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO. The PA3924 gene was coexpressed with PHA synthase 1 gene (phaC1Ps) and phaGPs gene from Pseudomonas sp. 61-3, and beta-ketothiolase gene (phbARe) and acetoacetyl-CoA reductase gene (phbBRe) from Ralstonia eutropha in Escherichia coli LS5218 at 25 degrees C. As a result, the copolymer containing 94.6 mol% 3-hydroxybutyrate (3HB) and 5.4 mol% mcl-3-hydroxyalkanoates (3HA) consisting of C8, C10, C12 and C14 was synthesized by recombinant E. coli LS5218 from glucose as the sole carbon source. The concentration of P(3HB-co-3HA) (scl-co-mcl-PHA) synthesized by the recombinant E. coli LS5218 harboring phaC1Ps, phaGPs, phbABRe and the PA3924 genes was approximately 7-fold higher than that of the recombinant LS5218 harboring phaC1Ps, phaGPs, phbABRe and the PP0763 genes. The number-average molecular weight of the P(3HB-co-5.4% 3HA) copolymer was 233 x 103, which was relatively high molecular weight. In addition, the physical and the mechanical properties of the copolymer were demonstrated to improve the brittleness of P(3HB) homopolymer.
TI  - ArsH is an organoarsenical oxidase that confers resistance to trivalent forms of  the herbicide monosodium methylarsenate and the poultry growth promoter roxarsone.
AB  - Environmental organoarsenicals are produced by microorganisms and are introduced  anthropogenically as herbicides and antimicrobial growth promoters for poultry and swine. Nearly every prokaryote has an ars (arsenic resistance) operon, and some have an arsH gene encoding an atypical flavodoxin. The role of ArsH in arsenic resistance has been unclear. Here we demonstrate that ArsH is an organoarsenical oxidase that detoxifies trivalent methylated and aromatic arsenicals by oxidation to pentavalent species. Escherichia coli, which does not have an arsH gene, is very sensitive to the trivalent forms of the herbicide monosodium methylarsenate [MSMA or MAs(V)] and antimicrobial growth promoter roxarsone [Rox(V)], as well as to phenylarsenite [PhAs(III), also called phenylarsine oxide or PAO]. Pseudomonas putida has two chromosomally encoded arsH genes and is highly resistant to the trivalent forms of these organoarsenicals. A derivative of P. putida with both arsH genes deleted is sensitive to MAs(III), PhAs(III) or Rox(III). P. putida arsH expressed in E. coli conferred resistance to each trivalent organoarsenical. Cells expressing PpArsH oxidized the trivalent organoarsenicals. PpArsH was purified, and the enzyme in vitro similarly oxidized the trivalent organoarsenicals. These results suggest that ArsH catalyzes a novel biotransformation that confers resistance to environmental methylated and aromatic arsenicals.
TI  - Pyrosequencing analysis of microbial community and food-borne bacteria on restaurant cutting boards collected in Seri Kembangan, Malaysia, and their correlation with grades of food premises.
AB  - This study adopts the pyrosequencing technique to identify bacteria present on 26 kitchen cutting boards collected from different grades of food premises around Seri Kembangan, a city in Malaysia. Pyrosequencing generated 452,401 of total reads of OTUs with an average of 1.4x10(7) bacterial cells/cm(2). Proteobacteria, Firmicutes and Bacteroides were identified as the most abundant phyla in the samples. Taxonomic richness was generally high with >1000 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) observed across all samples. The highest appearance frequencies (100%) were OTUs closely related to Enterobacter sp., Enterobacter aerogenes, Pseudomonas sp. and Pseudomonas putida. Several OTUs were identified most closely related to known food-borne pathogens, including Bacillus cereus, Cronobacter sakazaki, Cronobacter turisensis, Escherichia coli, E. coli O157:H7, Hafnia alvei, Kurthia gibsonii, Salmonella bongori, Salmonella enterica, Salmonella paratyphi, Salmonella tyhpi, Salmonella typhimurium and Yersinia enterocolitica ranging from 0.005% to 0.68% relative abundance. The condition and grade of the food premises on a three point cleanliness scale did not correlate with the bacterial abundance and type. Regardless of the status and grades, all food premises have the same likelihood to introduce food-borne bacteria from cutting boards to their foods and must always prioritize the correct food handling procedure in order to avoid unwanted outbreak of food-borne illnesses.
TI  - Transferable antibiotic resistance plasmids from biogas plant digestates often belong to the IncP-1epsilon subgroup.
AB  - Manure is known to contain residues of antibiotics administered to farm animals as well as bacteria carrying antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). These genes are often located on mobile genetic elements. In biogas plants (BGPs), organic substrates such as manure and plant material are mixed and fermented in order to provide energy, and resulting digestates are used for soil fertilization. The fate of plasmid carrying bacteria from manure during the fermentation process is unknown. The present study focused on transferable antibiotic resistance plasmids from digestates of seven BGPs, using manure as a co-substrate, and their phenotypic and genotypic characterization. Plasmids conferring resistance to either tetracycline or sulfadiazine were captured by means of exogenous plasmid isolation from digestates into Pseudomonas putida KT2442 and Escherichia coli CV601 recipients, at transfer frequencies ranging from 10(-5) to 10(-7). Transconjugants (n = 101) were screened by PCR-Southern blot hybridization and real-time PCR for the presence of IncP-1, IncP-1epsilon, IncW, IncN, IncP-7, IncP-9, LowGC, and IncQ plasmids. While 61 plasmids remained unassigned, 40 plasmids belonged to the IncP-1epsilon subgroup. All these IncP-1epsilon plasmids were shown to harbor the genes tet(A), sul1, qacEDelta1, intI1, and integron gene cassette amplicons of different size. Further analysis of 16 representative IncP-1epsilon plasmids showed that they conferred six different multiple antibiotic resistance patterns and their diversity seemed to be driven by the gene cassette arrays. IncP-1epsilon plasmids displaying similar restriction and antibiotic resistance patterns were captured from different BGPs, suggesting that they may be typical of this environment. Our study showed that BGP digestates are a potential source of transferable antibiotic resistance plasmids, and in particular the broad host range IncP-1epsilon plasmids might contribute to the spread of ARGs when digestates are used as fertilizer.
TI  - Enzyme fusion for whole-cell biotransformation of long-chain sec-alcohols into esters.
AB  - Enzyme fusion was investigated as a strategy to improve productivity of a two-step whole-cell biocatalysis. The biotransformation of long-chain sec-alcohols into esters by an alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenases (BVMOs) was used as the model reaction. The recombinant Escherichia coli, expressing the fusion enzymes between the ADH of Micrococcus luteus NCTC2665 and the BVMO of Pseudomonas putida KT2440 or Rhodococcus jostii RHA1, showed significantly greater bioconversion activity with long-chain sec-alcohols (e.g., 12-hydroxyoctadec-9-enoic acid (1a), 13-hydroxyoctadec-9-enoic acid (2a), 14-hydroxyicos-11-enoic acid (4a)) when compared to the recombinant E. coli expressing the ADH and BVMOs independently. For instance, activity of the recombinant E. coli expressing the ADH-Gly-BVMO, in which glycine-rich peptide was used as the linker, with 1a was increased up to 22 mumol g dry cells-1 min-1. This value is over 40 % greater than the recombinant E. coli expressing the ADH and BVMO independently. The substantial improvement appeared to be driven by an increase in the functional expression of the BVMOs and/or an increase in mass transport efficiency by localizing two active sites in close proximity.
TI  - Prediction of distal residue participation in enzyme catalysis.
AB  - A scoring method for the prediction of catalytically important residues in enzyme structures is presented and used to examine the participation of distal residues in enzyme catalysis. Scores are based on the Partial Order Optimum Likelihood (POOL) machine learning method, using computed electrostatic properties, surface geometric features, and information obtained from the phylogenetic tree as input features. Predictions of distal residue participation in catalysis are compared with experimental kinetics data from the literature on variants of the featured enzymes; some additional kinetics measurements are reported for variants of Pseudomonas putida nitrile hydratase (ppNH) and for Escherichia coli alkaline phosphatase (AP). The multilayer active sites of P. putida nitrile hydratase and of human phosphoglucose isomerase are predicted by the POOL log ZP scores, as is the single-layer active site of P. putida ketosteroid isomerase. The log ZP score cutoff utilized here results in over-prediction of distal residue involvement in E. coli alkaline phosphatase. While fewer experimental data points are available for P. putida mandelate racemase and for human carbonic anhydrase II, the POOL log ZP scores properly predict the previously reported participation of distal residues.
TI  - Development of a growth-dependent selection system for identification of L-threonine aldolases.
AB  - Threonine aldolases (TAs) are useful enzymes for the synthesis of beta-hydroxy-alpha-amino acids due to their capability to catalyze asymmetric aldol reactions. Starting from two prochiral compounds, an aldehyde and glycine, two chiral stereocenters were formed in a single step via C-C bond formation. Owing to poor diastereoselectivity and low activity, the enzymatic synthesis of beta-hydroxy-alpha-amino acids by TAs is still a challenge. For identification of new TAs, a growth-dependent selection system in Pseudomonas putida KT2440 has been developed. This bacterium is able to use aromatic compounds such as benzaldehyde, which is the cleavage product of the TA-mediated retro-aldol reaction of phenylserine, as sole carbon source via the beta-ketoadipate pathway. With DL-threo-beta-phenylserine as sole carbon source, this strain showed only slight growth in minimal medium. This growth deficiency can be restored by introducing and expressing genes encoding TAs. In order to develop a highly efficient selection system, the gene taPp of P. putida KT2440 encoding a TA was successfully deleted by replacement with an antibiotic resistance cassette. Different growth studies were carried out to prove the operability of the selection system. Genes encoding for L- and D-specific TAs (L-TA genes of Escherichia coli (ltaE) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (gly1) and D-TA gene of Achromobacter xylosoxidans (dtaAX)) were introduced into the selection strain P. putida KT2440DeltataPp, followed by cultivation on minimal medium supplemented with DL-threo-beta-phenylserine. The results demonstrate that only the selection strains with plasmid-encoded L-TAs were able to grow on this racemic amino acid, whereas the corresponding strain harboring the gene coding for a D-specific TA showed no growth. In summary, it can be stated that a powerful screening tool was developed to identify easily by growth new L-specific threonine aldolases or other enzymes from genomic or metagenomic libraries liberating benzaldehyde.
TI  - Detoxification of the veterinary antibiotic chloramphenicol using electron beam irradiation.
AB  - Electron beam irradiation has shown potential as an alternative process for the treatment of industrial effluents that contain toxic organic chemicals. This study investigated the effectiveness of electron beam in degrading chloramphenicol (CAP) in aqueous solution. The degradation efficiency was 32.4 % at 1 kGy, 86.9 % at 5 kGy, and 100 % at 10 kGy. The total organic carbon (TOC) of CAP in aqueous solution declined 4.6 % at 1 kGy, 12.1 % at 5 kGy, and 17.1 % at 10 kGy of irradiation with electron beam. The CAP degradation products after irradiation were CAP1 ([M + H] m/z 307.1), CAP2 ([M + H] m/z 291.1), and CAP3 ([M + H] m/z 321.1). The degradation products were tested for microbial toxicity against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas putida, and Bacillus subtilis and did not show any toxic antimicrobial effects caused by the CAP degradation products after irradiation with electron beam. The results of this study suggest that electron beam irradiation is the best technology for the comprehensive treatment of veterinary antibiotics at wastewater treatment plants.
TI  - Isolation of oxygenase genes for indigo-forming activity from an artificially polluted soil metagenome by functional screening using Pseudomonas putida strains as hosts.
AB  - Metagenomes contain the DNA from many microorganisms, both culturable and non-culturable, and are a potential resource of novel genes. In this study, a 5.2-Gb metagenomic DNA library was constructed from a soil sample (artificially polluted with four aromatic compounds, i.e., biphenyl, phenanthrene, carbazole, and 3-chlorobenzoate) in Escherichia coli by using a broad-host-range cosmid vector. The resultant library was introduced into naphthalene-degrading Pseudomonas putida-derived strains having deficiencies in their naphthalene dioxygenase components, and indigo-forming clones on the indole-containing agar plates were screened. Cosmids isolated from 29 positive clones were classified by their various properties (original screening hosts, hosts showing indigo-forming activity, and digestion patterns with restriction enzymes), and six representative cosmids were chosen. Sequencing and in vitro transposon mutagenesis of the six cosmids resulted in the identification of genes encoding putative class B and D flavoprotein monooxygenases, a multicomponent hydroxylase, and a reductase that were responsible for the indigo-forming activity in the host cells. Among them, the genes encoding the multicomponent hydroxylase were demonstrated to be involved in phenol degradation. Furthermore, two genes encoding ring-cleavage dioxygenases were also found adjacent to the genes responsible for the indigo formation, and their functions were experimentally confirmed.
TI  - Detection and characterization of a bacteriocin, putadicin T01, produced by Pseudomonas putida isolated from hot spring water.
AB  - Pseudomonas strains isolated from hot spring water were tested for bacteriocin-like substance (BLS) production using a target panel of closely related microorganisms and other Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Molecular identification was carried out through specific PCR and 16S RNA sequence analysis. Isolates were identified as Brevundimonas diminuta and Pseudomonas putida, the latter exhibited antimicrobial activity. Pseudomonas putida strains produce an inhibitory substance against other Pseudomonas strains and other species including food-borne pathogens. The BLS was sensitive to the proteolytic action of proteinase K, pronase E and trypsin but resistant to alpha-amylase, RNase and lipase C, reflecting its proteinaceous nature. The BLS was stable at 100 degrees C and also after thermal treatment at 121 degrees C for 15 min. Additionally, it was stable within a wide range of pH (2-10). The substance from P. putida T01 strain was bactericidal to Escherichia coli. SDS-PAGE analysis of the partial purified supernatant of strain T01 revealed a BLS with an approximate molecular mass of 8 kDa. Therefore, the results of this study show that P. putida strain T01 produces a BLS with a higher activity spectrum, which may find application in human medicine and in minimally processed food preservation.
TI  - Functional expression of L-lysine alpha-oxidase from Scomber japonicus in Escherichia coli for one-pot synthesis of L-pipecolic acid from DL-lysine.
AB  - L-Pipecolic acid is a key component of biologically active molecules and a pharmaceutically important chiral building block. It can be stereoselectively produced from L-lysine by a two-step bioconversion involving L-lysine alpha-oxidase and (1)-piperideine-2-carboxylae (Pip2C) reductase. In this study, we focused on an L-lysine alpha-oxidase from Scomber japonicus that was originally identified as an apoptosis-inducing protein (AIP) and applied the enzyme to one-pot fermentation of L-pipecolic acid in Escherichia coli. A synthetic gene coding for an AIP was expressed in E. coli, and the recombinant enzyme was purified and characterized. The purified enzyme was determined to be a homodimer with a molecular mass of 133.9 kDa. The enzyme essentially exhibited the same substrate specificity as the native enzyme. Optimal temperature and pH for the enzymatic reaction were 70 degrees C and 7.4, respectively. The enzyme was stable below 60 degrees C and at a pH range of 5.5-7.5 but was markedly inhibited by Co(2+). To establish a one-pot fermentation system for the synthesis of optically pure L-pipecolic acid from DL-lysine, an E. coli strain carrying a plasmid encoding AIP, Pip2C reductase from Pseudomonas putida, lysine racemase from P. putida, and glucose dehydrogenase from Bacillus subtilis was constructed. The one-pot process produced 45.1 g/L of L-pipecolic acid (87.4 % yield from DL-lysine) after a 46-h reaction with high optical purity (>99.9 % enantiomeric excess).
TI  - Expression levels of chaperones influence biotransformation activity of recombinant Escherichia coli expressing Micrococcus luteus alcohol dehydrogenase and Pseudomonas putida Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenase.
AB  - We demonstrated for the first time that the archaeal chaperones (i.e., gamma-prefoldin and thermosome) can stabilize enzyme activity in vivo. Ricinoleic acid biotransformation activity of recombinant Escherichia coli expressing Micrococcus luteus alcohol dehydrogenase and the Pseudomonas putida KT2440 Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenase improved significantly with co-expression of gamma-prefoldin or recombinant themosome originating from the deep-sea hyperthermophile archaea Methanocaldococcus jannaschii. Furthermore, the degree of enhanced activity was dependent on the expression levels of the chaperones. For example, whole-cell biotransformation activity was highest at 12 micromol/g dry cells/min when gamma-prefoldin expression level was approximately 46% of the theoretical maximum. This value was approximately two-fold greater than that in E. coli, where the gamma-prefoldin expression level was zero or set to the theoretical maximum. Therefore, it was assumed that the expression levels of chaperones must be optimized to achieve maximum biotransformation activity in whole-cell biocatalysts.
TI  - Biodegradation of hexachlorobenzene by a constructed microbial consortium.
AB  - A consortium comprised of an engineered Escherichia coli DH5alpha and a natural pentachlorophenol (PCP) degrader, Sphingobium chlorophenolicum ATCC 39723, was assembled for degradation of hexachlorobenzene (HCB), a persistent organic pollutant. The engineered E. coli strain, harbouring a gene cassette (camA (+) camB (+) camC) that encodes the F87W/Y96F/L244A/V247L mutant of cytochrome P-450cam (CYP101), oxidised HCB to PCP. The resulting PCP was then further completely degraded by ATCC 39723. The results showed that almost 40 % of 4 muM HCB was degraded by the consortium at a rate of 0.033 nmol/mg (dry weight)/h over 24 h, accompanied by transient accumulation and immediate consumption of the intermediate PCP, detected by gas chromatography. In contrast, in the consortium comprised of Pseudomonas putida PaW340 harbouring camA (+) camB (+) camC and ATCC 39723, PCP accumulated in PaW340 cells but could not be further degraded, which may be due to a permeability barrier of Pseudomonas PaW340 for PCP transportation. The strategy of bacterial co-culture may provide an alternative approach for the bioremediation of HCB contamination.
TI  - De novo production of the monoterpenoid geranic acid by metabolically engineered  Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Production of monoterpenoids as valuable chemicals using recombinant  microbes is a growing field of interest. Unfortunately, antimicrobial activity of most monoterpenoids hampers a wide application of microorganisms for their production. Strains of Pseudomonas putida, a fast growing and metabolically versatile bacterium, often show an outstanding high tolerance towards organic solvents and other toxic compounds. Therefore, Pseudomonas putida constitutes an attractive alternative host in comparison to conventionally used microorganisms. Here, metabolic engineering of solvent tolerant Pseudomonas putida as a novel microbial cell factory for de novo production of monoterpenoids is reported for the first time, exemplified by geranic acid production from glycerol as carbon source. The monoterpenoic acid is an attractive compound for application in the flavor, fragrance, cosmetics and agro industries. RESULTS: A comparison between Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Pseudomonas putida concerning the ability to grow in the presence of geranic acid revealed that the pseudomonad bears a superior resilience compared to the conventionally used microbes. Moreover, Pseudomonas putida DSM 12264 wildtype strain efficiently oxidized externally added geraniol to geranic acid with no further degradation. Omitting external dosage of geraniol but functionally expressing geraniol synthase (GES) from Ocimum basilicum, a first proof-of-concept for de novo biosynthesis of 1.35 mg/L geranic acid in P. putida DSM 12264 was achieved. Doubling the amount of glycerol resulted in twice the amount of product. Co-expression of the six genes of the mevalonate pathway from Myxococcus xanthus to establish flux from acetyl-CoA to the universal terpenoid precursor isopentenylpyrophosphate yielded 36 mg/L geranic acid in shake flask experiments. In the bioreactor, the recombinant strain produced 193 mg/L of geranic acid under fed-batch conditions within 48 h. CONCLUSION: Metabolic engineering turned Pseudomonas putida DSM 12264, a versatile monoterpenoid oxidation biocatalyst, into an efficient microbial cell factory for de novo geranic acid production. Improvements by metabolic and process engineering are expected to further increase the product concentration. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first example of a de novo production of a monoterpenoid with Pseudomonas putida and of a microbial monoterpenoic acid synthesis in general.
TI  - Enhancement of protocatechuate decarboxylase activity for the effective production of muconate from lignin-related aromatic compounds.
AB  - The decarboxylation reaction of protocatechuate has been described as a bottleneck and a rate-limiting step in cis,cis-muconate (ccMA) bioproduction from renewable feedstocks such as sugar. Because sugars are already in high demand in the development of many bio-based products, our work focuses on improving protocatechuate decarboxylase (Pdc) activity and ccMA production in particular, from lignin-related aromatic compounds. We previously had transformed an Escherichia coli strain using aroY, which had been used as a protocatechuate decarboxylase encoding gene from Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae A170-40, and inserted other required genes from Pseudomonas putida KT2440, to allow the production of ccMA from vanillin. This recombinant strain produced ccMA from vanillin, however the Pdc reaction step remained a bottleneck during incubation. In the current study, we identify a way to increase protocatechuate decarboxylase activity in E. coli through enzyme production involving both aroY and kpdB; the latter which encodes for the B subunit of 4-hydroxybenzoate decarboxylase. This permits expression of Pdc activity at a level approximately 14-fold greater than the strain with aroY only. The expression level of AroY increased, apparently as a function of the co-expression of AroY and KpdB. Our results also imply that ccMA may inhibit vanillate demethylation, a reaction step that is rate limiting for efficient ccMA production from lignin-related aromatic compounds, so even though ccMA production may be enhanced, other challenges to overcome vanilate demethylation inhibition still remain.
TI  - Development of recombinant methioninase to target the general cancer-specific metabolic defect of methionine dependence: a 40-year odyssey.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: All tested cancer cell types are methionine dependent in that the cells arrest and eventually die when deprived of methionine, a condition that is generally nontoxic to normal cells. Methionine dependence is the only known general metabolic defect in cancer. Methionine-deprived cancer cells arrest at the S/G2 phase, an unusual position for cell cycle arrest. In order to exploit the cancer-specific metabolic defect of methionine dependence, methioninases were developed. AREAS COVERED: The present Expert Opinion describes the phenomena of methionine dependence and a methioninase cloned from Pseudomonas putida (chemical name: l-methionine alpha-deamino-gamma-mercaptomethane lyase [EC 4.4.1.11]). The cloned methioninase, termed recombinant methioninase, or rMETase, has been tested in mouse models of human cancer as well as in macaque monkeys and a pilot Phase I trial of human cancer patients. Efficacy of rMETase has been demonstrated against various cancer types in mouse models. EXPERT OPINION: The most promising application of rMETase therapy is in sequential combination therapy, whereby the cancer cells within a tumor are trapped in S/G2 by methioninase treatment and then treated with chemotherapeutic agents active against cells in S/G2.
TI  - Complete genome sequence analysis of two Pseudomonas plecoglossicida phages, potential therapeutic agents.
AB  - Pseudomonas plecoglossicida is a lethal pathogen of ayu (Plecoglossus altivelis)  in Japan and is responsible for substantial economic costs to ayu culture. Previously, we demonstrated the efficacy of phage therapy against P. plecoglossicida infection using two lytic phages (PPpW-3 and PPpW-4) (S. C. Park, I. Shimamura, M. Fukunaga, K. Mori, and T. Nakai, Appl Environ Microbiol 66:1416-1422, 2000, http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.66.4.1416-1422.2000; S. C. Park and T. Nakai, Dis Aquat Org 53:33-39, 2003, http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/dao053033). In the present study, the complete genome sequences of these therapeutic P. plecoglossicida phages were determined and analyzed for deleterious factors as therapeutic agents. The genome of PPpW-3 (myovirus) consisted of 43,564 bp with a GC content of 61.1% and 66 predicted open reading frames (ORFs). Approximately half of the genes were similar to the genes of the Escherichia coli phage vB_EcoM_ECO1230-10 (myovirus). The genome of PPpW-4 (podovirus) consisted of 41,386 bp with a GC content of 56.8% and 50 predicted ORFs. More than 70% of the genes were similar to the genes of Pseudomonas fluorescens phage varphiIBB-PF7A and Pseudomonas putida phage varphi15 (podoviruses). The whole-genome analysis revealed that no known virulence genes were present in PPpW-3 and PPpW-4. An integrase gene was found in PPpW-3, but other factors used for lysogeny were not confirmed. The PCR detection of phage genes in phage-resistant variants provided no evidence of lysogenic activity in PPpW-3 and PPpW-4. We conclude that these two lytic phages qualify as therapeutic agents.
TI  - Quantitative analysis of chemotaxis towards toluene by Pseudomonas putida in a convection-free microfluidic device.
AB  - Chemotaxis has been shown to be beneficial for the migration of soil-inhabiting bacteria towards industrial chemical pollutants, which they degrade. Many studies have demonstrated the importance of this microbial property under various circumstances; however, few quantitative analyses have been undertaken to measure the two essential parameters that characterize the chemotaxis of bioremediation bacteria: the chemotactic sensitivity coefficient chi(0) and the chemotactic receptor constant K(c). The main challenge to determine these parameters is that chi(0) and K(c) are coupled together in non-linear mathematical models used to evaluate them. In this study we developed a method to accurately measure these parameters for Pseudomonas putida in the presence of toluene, an important pollutant in groundwater contamination. Our approach uses a multilayer microfluidic device to expose bacteria to a convection-free linear chemical gradient of toluene that is stable over time. The bacterial distribution within the gradient is measured in terms of fluorescence intensity, and is then used to fit the parameters Kc and chi(0) with mathematical models. Critically, bacterial distributions under chemical gradients at two different concentrations were used to solve for both parameters independently. To validate the approach, the chemotaxis parameters of Escherichia coli strains towards alpha-methylaspartate were experimentally derived and were found to be consistent with published results from related work.
TI  - New transposon tools tailored for metabolic engineering of gram-negative microbial cell factories.
AB  - Re-programming microorganisms to modify their existing functions and/or to bestow bacteria with entirely new-to-Nature tasks have largely relied so far on specialized molecular biology tools. Such endeavors are not only relevant in the burgeoning metabolic engineering arena but also instrumental to explore the functioning of complex regulatory networks from a fundamental point of view. A la carte modification of bacterial genomes thus calls for novel tools to make genetic manipulations easier. We propose the use of a series of new broad-host-range mini-Tn5-vectors, termed pBAMDs, for the delivery of gene(s) into the chromosome of Gram-negative bacteria and for generating saturated mutagenesis libraries in gene function studies. These delivery vectors endow the user with the possibility of easy cloning and subsequent insertion of functional cargoes with three different antibiotic-resistance markers (kanamycin, streptomycin, and gentamicin). After validating the pBAMD vectors in the environmental bacterium Pseudomonas putida KT2440, their use was also illustrated by inserting the entire poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) synthesis pathway from Cupriavidus necator in the chromosome of a phosphotransacetylase mutant of Escherichia coli. PHB is a completely biodegradable polyester with a number of industrial applications that make it attractive as a potential replacement of oil-based plastics. The non-selective nature of chromosomal insertions of the biosynthetic genes was evidenced by a large landscape of PHB synthesis levels in independent clones. One clone was selected and further characterized as a microbial cell factory for PHB accumulation, and it achieved polymer accumulation levels comparable to those of a plasmid-bearing recombinant. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the new mini-Tn5-vectors can be used to confer interesting phenotypes in Gram-negative bacteria that would be very difficult to engineer through direct manipulation of the structural genes.
TI  - Degradation and changes in toxicity and biodegradability of tetracycline during ozone/ultraviolet-based advanced oxidation.
AB  - Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) composed of O3, H2O2 and ultraviolet (UV) were applied to degrade tetracycline (TC). Degradation efficiency was evaluated in terms of changes in absorbance (ABS) and total organic carbon (TOC). The change in biotoxicity was monitored with Escherichia coli and Vibrio fischeri. The improvement in biodegradability during oxidation was demonstrated through 5-day biochemical oxygen demand/chemical oxygen demand ratio and aerobic biological treatment. The combination of O3/H2O2/UV and O3/UV showed the best performance for the reductions in ABS and TOC. However, mineralization and detoxification were not perfect under the experimental conditions that were used in this study. Therefore, for the ultimate treatment of TC compounds, it is suggested that AOP treatment is followed by biological treatment, utilizing enhanced biodegradability. In this study, aerobic biological treatment by Pseudomonas putida was performed for O3/UV-treated TC. It was confirmed that O3/UV treatment improved TOC reduction and facilitated complete mineralization in biological treatment.
TI  - Silver, zinc oxide and titanium dioxide nanoparticle ecotoxicity to bioluminescent Pseudomonas putida in laboratory medium and artificial wastewater.
AB  - Bacteria based ecotoxicology assessment of manufactured nanoparticles is largely  restricted to Escherichia coli bioreporters in laboratory media. Here, toxicity effects of model OECD nanoparticles (Ag NM-300K, ZnO NM-110 and TiO2 NM-104) were assessed using the switch-off luminescent Pseudomonas putida BS566::luxCDABE bioreporter in Luria Bertani (LB) medium and artificial wastewater (AW). IC50 values approximately 4 mg L(-1), 100 mg L(-1) and >200 mg L(-1) at 1 h were observed in LB for Ag NM-300K, ZnO NM-110 and TiO2 NM-104, respectively. Similar results were obtained in AW for Ag NM-300K (IC50 approximately 5 mg L(-1)) and TiO2 NM-104 (IC50>200 mg L(-1)) whereas ZnO NM-110 was significantly higher (IC50>200 mg L(-1)). Lower ZnO NM-110 toxicity in AW compared to LB was associated with differences in agglomeration status and dissolution rate. This work demonstrates the importance of nanoecotoxicological studies in environmentally relevant matrices.
TI  - Cloning and expression of a trehalose synthase from Pseudomonas putida KT2440 for the scale-up production of trehalose from maltose.
AB  - Trehalose synthase (TreS) is considered to be a potential biocatalyst for trehalose production. We aimed to scale-up produce the TreS protein in Escherichia coli and further investigate the bioconversion capacity of TreS. The treS gene from Pseudomonas putida KT2440 was amplified and expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3). The recombinant TreS showed a molecular mass of 67 kDa. Activity analysis suggested that TreS had optimal activity at a temperature of 55 degrees C, a pH of 7.4, with a substrate concentration of 30%. High-pressure liquid chromatography results indicated that this enzyme had the ability to catalyze 59% maltose into trehalose, with about 5.1% glucose as by-product. Purification analysis showed that trehalose crystals with a purity of 98% were obtained by cooling trehalose solution. The TreS from P. putida KT2440 might be a candidate for trehalose production. Further study is needed to improve the trehalose conversion rate.
TI  - Proteomic characterization of the outer membrane vesicle of Pseudomonas putida KT2440.
AB  - Outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) are produced by various pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii. In this study, we isolated OMVs from a representative soil bacterium, Pseudomonas putida KT2440, which has a biodegradative activity toward various aromatic compounds. Proteomic analysis identified the outer membrane proteins (OMPs) OprC, OprD, OprE, OprF, OprH, OprG, and OprW as major components of the OMV of P. putida KT2440. The production of OMVs was dependent on the nutrient availability in the culture media, and the up- or down-regulation of specific OMPs was observed according to the culture conditions. In particular, porins (e.g., benzoate-specific porin, BenF-like porin) and enzymes (e.g., catechol 1,2-dioxygenase, benzoate dioxygenase) for benzoate degradation were uniquely found in OMVs prepared from P. putida KT2440 that were cultured in media containing benzoate as the energy source. OMVs of P. putida KT2440 showed low pathological activity toward cultured cells that originated from human lung cells, which suggests their potential as adjuvants or OMV vaccine carriers. Our results suggest that the protein composition of the OMVs of P. putida KT2440 reflects the characteristics of the total proteome of P. putida KT2440.
TI  - Surface free energy activated high-throughput cell sorting.
AB  - Cell sorting is an important screening process in microbiology, biotechnology, and clinical research. Existing methods are mainly based on single-cell analysis as in flow cytometric and microfluidic cell sorters. Here we report a label-free bulk method for sorting cells by differentiating their characteristic surface free energies (SFEs). We demonstrated the feasibility of this method by sorting model binary cell mixtures of various bacterial species, including Pseudomonas putida KT2440, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, Salmonella Typhimurium ATCC 14028, and Escherichia coli DH5alpha. This method can effectively separate 10(10) bacterial cells within 30 min. Individual bacterial species can be sorted with up to 96% efficiency, and the cell viability ratio can be as high as 99%. In addition to its capacity of sorting evenly mixed bacterial cells, we demonstrated the feasibility of this method in selecting and enriching cells of minor populations in the mixture (presenting at only 1% in quantity) to a purity as high as 99%. This SFE-activated method may be used as a stand-alone method for quickly sorting a large quantity of bacterial cells or as a prescreening tool for microbial discrimination. Given its advantages of label-free, high-throughput, low cost, and simplicity, this SFE-activated cell sorting method has potential in various applications of sorting cells and abiotic particles.
TI  - Mechanism of the 6-hydroxy-3-succinoyl-pyridine 3-monooxygenase flavoprotein from Pseudomonas putida S16.
AB  - 6-Hydroxy-3-succinoyl-pyridine (HSP) 3-monooxygenase (HspB), a flavoprotein essential to the pyrrolidine pathway of nicotine degradation, catalyzes pyridine-ring beta-hydroxylation, resulting in carbon-carbon cleavage and production of 2,5-dihydroxypyridine. Here, we generated His6-tagged HspB in Escherichia coli, characterized the properties of the recombinant enzyme, and investigated its mechanism of catalysis. In contrast to conclusions reported previously, the second product of the HspB reaction was shown to be succinate, with isotope labeling experiments providing direct evidence that the newly introduced oxygen atom of succinate is derived from H2O. Phylogenetic analysis reveals that HspB is the most closely related to two p-nitrophenol 4-monooxygenases, and the experimental results exhibit that p-nitrophenol is a substrate of HspB. The reduction of HspB (with maxima at 375 and 460 nm, and a shoulder at 485 nm) by NADH was followed by stopped-flow spectroscopy, and the rate constant for reduction was shown to be stimulated by HSP. Reduced HspB reacts with oxygen to form a C(4a)-(hydro)peroxyflavin intermediate with an absorbance maximum at approximately 400 nm within the first few milliseconds before converting to the oxidized flavoenzyme species. The formed C(4a)-hydroperoxyflavin intermediate reacts with HSP to form an intermediate that hydrolyzes to the products 2,5-dihydroxypyridine and succinate. The investigation on the catalytic mechanism of a flavoprotein pyridine-ring beta-position hydroxylase provides useful information for the biosynthesis of pyridine derivatives.
TI  - High-level conversion of L-lysine into 5-aminovalerate that can be used for nylon 6,5 synthesis.
AB  - L-Lysine is a potential feedstock for the production of bio-based precursors for  engineering plastics. In this study, we developed a microbial process for high-level conversion of L-lysine into 5-aminovalerate (5AVA) that can be used as a monomer in nylon 6,5 synthesis. Recombinant Escherichia coli WL3110 strain expressing Pseudomonas putida delta-aminovaleramidase (DavA) and lysine 2-monooxygenase (DavB) was grown to high density in fed-batch culture and used as a whole cell catalyst. High-density E. coli WL3110 expressing DavAB, grown to an optical density at 600 nm (OD600 ) of 30, yielded 36.51 g/L 5AVA from 60 g/L L-lysine in 24 h. Doubling the cell density of E. coli WL3110 improved the conversion yield to 47.96 g/L 5AVA from 60 g/L of L-lysine in 24 h. 5AVA production was further improved by doubling the L-lysine concentration from 60 to 120 g/L. The highest 5AVA titer (90.59 g/L; molar yield 0.942) was obtained from 120 g/L L-lysine by E. coli WL3110 cells grown to OD600 of 60. Finally, nylon 6,5 was synthesized by bulk polymerization of -caprolactam and delta-valerolactam prepared from microbially synthesized 5AVA. The hybrid system demonstrated here has promising possibilities for application in the development of industrial bio-nylon production processes.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of cobalt imidazolate metal-organic frameworks.
AB  - Two cobalt imidazolate metal-organic frameworks were evaluated as a bactericidal  material against the growth of the Gram-negative bacteria Pseudomonas putida and Escherichia coli. Under the most unfavourable conditions, within the exponential growth phase and in the culture media for both microorganisms, the growth inhibition reached over 50% for concentrations of biocidal material in the 5-10mgL(-1) range. The release of metal gives excellent durability with the antibacterial effect persisting after 3months. Both cobalt-based materials can be prepared with simple, cheap and easily accessible commercial ligands, leading to a more affordable possible future application as antimicrobial materials.
TI  - Wound healing potential of antibacterial microneedles loaded with green tea extracts.
AB  - This study evaluates the utility of an antibacterial microneedle composed of green tea (GT) extract and hyaluronic acid (HA), for the efficient delivery of GT. These microneedles have the potential to be a patient-friendly method for the conventional sustained release of drugs. In this study, a fabrication method using a mold-based technique to produce GT/HA microneedles with a maximum area of ~50mm(2) with antibacterial properties was used to manufacture transdermal drug delivery systems. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometry was carried out to observe the potential modifications in the microneedles, when incorporated with GT. The degradation rate of GT in GT/HA microneedles was controlled simply by adjusting the HA composition. The effects of different ratios of GT in the HA microneedles were determined by measuring the release properties. In HA microneedles loaded with 70% GT (GT70), a continuous higher release rate was sustained for 72h. The in vitro cytotoxicity assays demonstrated that GT/HA microneedles were not generally cytotoxic to Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO-K1), human embryonic kidney cells (293T), and mouse muscle cells (C2C12), which were treated for 12 and 24h. Antimicrobial activity of the GT/HA microneedles was demonstrated by ~95% growth reduction of gram negative [Escherichia coli (E. coli), Pseudomonas putida (P. putida), and Salmonella typhimurium (S. typhimurium)] and gram positive bacteria [Staphylococcus aureus (S. Aureus) and Bacillus subtilis (B. subtilis)], with GT70. Furthermore, GT/HA microneedles reduced bacterial growth of infected wound sites in the skin and improved wound healing process of skin in rat model.
TI  - Metabolic engineering of Escherichia coli for poly(3-hydroxypropionate) production from glycerol and glucose.
AB  - A new poly(3-hydroxypropionate) (P3HP) biosynthetic pathway employing beta-alanine as an intermediate from an inexpensive carbon source was developed in recombinant Escherichia coli. After a series of systematic optimization, the genes for L-aspartate decarboxylase and its maturation factor (panD and panM, from E. coli), beta-alanine-pyruvate transaminase (pp0596, from Pseudomonas putida), 3-hydroxy acid dehydrogenase and 3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA synthase (ydfG and prpE respectively, from E. coli), and polyhydroxyalkanoate synthase (phaC1, from Cupriavidus necator) were cloned and expressed in E. coli. Under shake-flask conditions, the recombinant strain produced 0.5 g P3HP l(-1) from glycerol and glucose, up to 10.2 % of CDW. Though the content of P3HP was low, this pathway has some advantages over other reported pathways, such as being redox neutral, does not require any coenzyme, and can use a wide range of carbon sources.
TI  - Whole-cell biotransformation with recombinant cytochrome P450 for the selective oxidation of Grundmann's ketone.
AB  - 25-Hydroxy-Grundmann's ketone is a key building block in the chemical synthesis of vitamin D3 and its derivatives through convergent routes. Generally, the chemical synthesis of this compound involves tedious procedures and results in a mixture of several products. Recently, the selective hydroxylation of Grundmann's ketone at position C25 by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 154E1 from Thermobifida fusca YX was described. In this study a recombinant whole-cell biocatalyst was developed and applied for hydroxylation of Grundmann's ketone. Biotransformation was performed by Escherichia coli cells expressing CYP154E1 along with two redox partner systems, Pdx/PdR and YkuN/FdR. The system comprising CYP154E1/Pdx/PdR showed the highest production of 25-hydroxy-Grundmann's ketone and resulted in 1.1mM (300mgL(-1)) product concentration.
TI  - Decomposition reaction of the veterinary antibiotic ciprofloxacin using electron  ionizing energy.
AB  - The application of electron ionizing energy for degrading veterinary antibiotic ciprofloxacin (CFX) in aqueous solution was elucidated. The degradation efficiency of CFX after irradiation with electron ionizing energy was 38% at 1 kGy, 80% at 5kGy, and 97% at 10 kGy. Total organic carbon of CFX in aqueous solution after irradiation with electron ionizing energy decreased 2% at 1 kGy, 18% at 5 kGy, and 53% at 10 kGy. The CFX degradation products after irradiation with electron ionizing energy were CFX1 ([M+H] m/z 330), CFX2 ([M+H] m/z 314), and CFX3 ([M+H] m/z 263). CFX1 had an F atom substituted with OH and CFX2 was expected to originate from CFX via loss of F or H2O. CFX3 was expected to originate from CFX via loss of the piperazynilic ring. Among the several radicals, hydrate electron (eaq(-)) is expected to play an important role in degradation of veterinary antibiotic during irradiation with electron ionizing energy. The toxicity of the degraded products formed during irradiation with electron ionizing energy was evaluated using microbes such as Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas putida, and Bacillus subtilis, and the results revealed that the toxicity decreased with irradiation. These results demonstrate that irradiation technology using electron ionizing energy is an effective was to remove veterinary antibiotics from an aquatic ecosystem.
TI  - Oxidative stress response in Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - Pseudomonas putida is widely distributed in nature and is capable of degrading various organic compounds due to its high metabolic versatility. The survival capacity of P. putida stems from its frequent exposure to various endogenous and exogenous oxidative stresses. Oxidative stress is an unavoidable consequence of interactions with various reactive oxygen species (ROS)-inducing agents existing in various niches. ROS could facilitate the evolution of bacteria by mutating genomes. Aerobic bacteria maintain defense mechanisms against oxidative stress throughout their evolution. To overcome the detrimental effects of oxidative stress, P. putida has developed defensive cellular systems involving induction of stress-sensing proteins and detoxification enzymes as well as regulation of oxidative stress response networks. Genetic responses to oxidative stress in P. putida differ markedly from those observed in Escherichia coli and Salmonella spp. Two major redox-sensing transcriptional regulators, SoxR and OxyR, are present and functional in the genome of P. putida. However, the novel regulators FinR and HexR control many genes belonging to the E. coli SoxR regulon. Oxidative stress can be generated by exposure to antibiotics, and iron homeostasis in P. putida is crucial for bacterial cell survival during treatment with antibiotics. This review highlights and summarizes current knowledge of oxidative stress in P. putida, as a model soil bacterium, together with recent studies from molecular genetics perspectives.
TI  - A stress-responsive Escherichia coli protein, CysQ is a highly effective solubility enhancer for aggregation-prone heterologous proteins.
AB  - When used as an N-terminal fusion expression partner, the Escherichia coli stress-responsive protein, CysQ dramatically increased the cytoplasmic solubility of various aggregation-prone heterologous proteins: Pseudomonas putida cutinase (CUT), human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (hG-CSF), human ferritin light chain (hFTN-L), arginine deiminase (ADI), human interleukin-2 (IL2), human activation induced cytidine deaminase (AID), and deletion mutant of human glutamate decarboxylase (GAD448-585). As compared with well-known fusion tags such as glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and maltose-binding protein (MBP), the performance of CysQ as solubility enhancer was evidently better than GST and was similar to or better than MBP for the seven heterologous proteins above. This is likely due to the intrinsic ability of CysQ to form its native conformation, probably promoting the binding of molecular chaperones during the folding of CysQ-fusion protein. When used as a substrate, p-nitrophenyl butyrate (PNB) was successfully hydrolyzed to p-nitrophenol by CysQ-CUT fusion mutant. Even after CysQ was removed, the solubility of hFTN-L and hG-CSF, the secondary structure of hG-CSF, and self-assembly activity of hFTN-L were successfully maintained. Conclusively, it seems that CysQ is a highly effective solubility enhancer and fusion expression partner for the production of a variety of bio-active recombinant proteins.
TI  - Continuous-flow extractive desorption electrospray ionization coupled to normal phase separations and for direct lipid analysis from cell extracts.
AB  - Normal phase liquid chromatography is a common mode for chiral separations. Many  chiral amines are used as drugs or are important intermediates for drug synthesis. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry is well known for its high sensitivity. However, when using normal phase liquid chromatography, electrospray ionization is hampered by the poor ionization efficiency of analytes from organic eluents. Continuous-flow extractive desorption electrospray ionization, which introduces the eluents through a hypodermic needle into the electrospray plume is demonstrated here for its success to interface normal phase liquid chromatography to mass spectrometry detection. Such an approach was shown to be as or more sensitive than ultraviolet detection for a selected set of aromatic amine-functionalized enantiomers. Also demonstrated is the direct infusion of cell extracts to monitor phospholipids from three different bacterial cells. Despite their presence in non-electrospray-ionization-friendly extraction solvents, continuous-flow extractive desorption electrospray ionization enabled the sensitive detection of phospholipids and the ability to tune ion forms through incorporation of different spray modifiers.
TI  - Fructose 1-phosphate is the one and only physiological effector of the Cra (FruR) regulator of Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - Fructose-1-phosphate (F1P) is the preferred effector of the catabolite repressor/activator (Cra) protein of the soil bacterium Pseudomonas putida but its ability to bind other metabolic intermediates in vivo is unclear. The Cra protein of this microorganism (Cra(PP)) was submitted to mobility shift assays with target DNA sequences (the PfruB promoter) and candidate effectors fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP), glucose 6-phosphate (G6P), and fructose-6-phosphate (F6P). 1 mM F1P was sufficient to release most of the Cra protein from its operators but more than 10 mM of FBP or G6P was required to free the same complex. However, isothermal titration microcalorimetry failed to expose any specific interaction between Cra(PP) and FBP or G6P. To solve this paradox, transcriptional activity of a PfruB-lacZ fusion was measured in wild-type and DeltafruB cells growing on substrates that change the intracellular concentrations of F1P and FBP. The data indicated that PfruB activity was stimulated by fructose but not by glucose or succinate. This suggested that Cra(PP) represses expression in vivo of the cognate fruBKA operon in a fashion dependent just on F1P, ruling out any other physiological effector. Molecular docking and dynamic simulations of the Cra-agonist interaction indicated that both metabolites can bind the repressor, but the breach in the relative affinity of Cra(PP) for F1P vs FBP is three orders of magnitude larger than the equivalent distance in the Escherichia coli protein. This assigns the Cra protein of P. putida the sole role of transducing the presence of fructose in the medium into a variety of direct and indirect physiological responses.
TI  - Cultivation to improve in vivo solubility of overexpressed arginine deiminases in Escherichia coli and the enzyme characteristics.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Overexpression of foreign genes in Escherichia coli cells is an efficient means to obtain recombinant proteins. The technique is, however, often hampered by misfolding, degradation, aggregation and formation in inclusion bodies of products. RESULTS: In this study, we reported that in vivo solubility of overexpressed arginine deiminases (ADI) improved by changing the cultivation conditions. ADI is enzymes that convert L-arginine to L-citrulline. After codon optimization, we synthesized the ADI gene of Pseudomonas putida and constructed it for overexpression in E. coli cells. The rADI products were mainly in inclusion body forms. We performed a series of optimization to enhance solubility of the protein. Co-expression with the GroES-GroEL chaperone team increased approximately 5-fold of the rADI activity. In addition the combination of L-arginine and D-glucose in the Luria-Bertani (LB) growth medium further increased the total activity to about 15 times. Separate L-arginine and D-glucose or the addition of other saccharides or amino acids had no such effects. The solubilization effects of the combination of L-arginine and D-glucose were further confirmed in the overexpression of another ADI from Listeria welshimeri. The enzymatic and conversion characteristics of the rADI products were further determined. CONCLUSIONS: Combined addition of L-arginine and D-glucose in the LB medium significantly improved in vivo solubility of rADI proteins. The present study suggested a new strategy to increase the solubilization of overexpressed recombinant proteins in E. coli cells.
TI  - Assessment of planctomycetes cell viability after pollutants exposure.
AB  - In this study, the growth of six different planctomycetes, a particular ubiquitous bacterial phylum, was assessed after exposure to pollutants. In addition and for comparative purposes, Pseudomonas putida, Escherichia coli and Vibrio anguillarum were tested. Each microorganism was exposed to several concentrations of 21 different pollutants. After exposure, bacteria were cultivated using the drop plate method. In general, the strains exhibited a great variation of sensitivity to pollutants in the order: V. anguillarum > planctomycetes > P. putida > E. coli. E. coli showed resistance to all pollutants tested, with the exception of phenol and sodium azide. Copper, Ridomil(R) (fungicide), hydrazine and phenol were the most toxic pollutants. Planctomycetes were resistant to extremely high concentrations of nitrate, nitrite and ammonium but they were the only bacteria sensitive to Previcur N(R) (fungicide). Sodium azide affected the growth on plates of E. coli, P. putida and V. anguillarum, but not of planctomycetes. However, this compound affected planctomycetes cell respiration but with less impact than in the aforementioned bacteria. Our results provide evidence for a diverse response of bacteria towards pollutants, which may influence the structuring of microbial communities in ecosystems under stress, and provide new insights on the ecophysiology of planctomycetes.
TI  - Occurrence of multi-antibiotic resistant Pseudomonas spp. in drinking water produced from karstic hydrosystems.
AB  - Aquatic environments could play a role in the spread of antibiotic resistance genes by enabling antibiotic-resistant bacteria transferred through wastewater inputs to connect with autochthonous bacteria. Consequently, drinking water could be a potential pathway to humans and animals for antibiotic resistance genes. The aim of this study was to investigate occurrences of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas spp. in drinking water produced from a karst, a vulnerable aquifer with frequent increases in water turbidity after rainfall events and run-offs. Water samples were collected throughout the system from the karstic springs to the drinking water tap during three non-turbid periods and two turbid events. E. coli densities in the springs were 10- to 1000-fold higher during the turbid events than during the non-turbid periods, indicating that, with increased turbidity, surface water had entered the karstic system and contaminated the spring water. However, no E. coli were isolated in the drinking water. In contrast, Pseudomonas spp. were isolated from the drinking water only during turbid events, while the densities in the springs were from 10- to 100-fold higher than in the non-turbid periods. All the 580 Pseudomonas spp. isolates obtained from the sampling periods were resistant (to between 1 and 10 antibiotics), with similar resistance patterns. Among all the Pseudomonas isolated throughout the drinking water production system, between 32% and 86% carried the major resistance pattern: ticarcillin, ticarcillin-clavulanic acid, cefsulodin, and/or aztreonam, and/or sulfamethoxazol-trimethoprim, and/or fosfomycin. Finally, 8 Pseudomonas spp. isolates, related to the Pseudomonas putida and Pseudomonas fluorescens species, were isolated from the drinking water. Thus, Pseudomonas could be involved in the dissemination of antibiotic resistance via drinking water during critical periods.
TI  - ATR-FTIR spectroscopic evidence for biomolecular phosphorus and carboxyl groups facilitating bacterial adhesion to iron oxides.
AB  - Attenuated total reflectance (ATR) Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy has been used to probe the binding of bacteria to hematite (alpha-Fe2O3) and goethite (alpha-FeOOH). In situ ATR-FTIR experiments with bacteria (Pseudomonas putida, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli), mixed amino acids, polypeptide extracts, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), and a suite of model compounds were conducted. These compounds represent carboxyl, catecholate, amide, and phosphate groups present in siderophores, amino acids, polysaccharides, phospholipids, and DNA. Due in part to the ubiquitous presence of carboxyl groups in biomolecules, numerous IR peaks corresponding to outer-sphere or unbound (1400 cm(-1)) and inner-sphere (1310-1320 cm(-1)) coordinated carboxyl groups are noted following reaction of bacteria and biomolecules with alpha-Fe2O3 and alpha-FeOOH. However, the data also reveal that the presence of low-level amounts (i.e., 0.45-0.79%) of biomolecular phosphorous groups result in strong IR bands at approximately 1043 cm(-1), corresponding to inner-sphere Fe-O-P bonds, underscoring the importance of bacteria associated P-containing groups in biomolecule and cell adhesion. Spectral comparisons also reveal slightly greater P-O-Fe contributions for bacteria (Pseudomonad, E. coli) deposited on alpha-FeOOH, as compared to alpha-Fe2O3. This data demonstrates that slight differences in bacterial adhesion to Fe oxides can be attributed to bacterial species and Fe-oxide minerals. However, more importantly, the strong binding affinity of phosphate in all bacteria samples to both Fe-oxides results in the formation of inner-sphere Fe-O-P bonds, signifying the critical role of biomolecular P in the initiation of bacterial adhesion.
TI  - Reaction and catalyst engineering to exploit kinetically controlled whole-cell multistep biocatalysis for terminal FAME oxyfunctionalization.
AB  - The oxyfunctionalization of unactivated C-H bonds can selectively and efficiently be catalyzed by oxygenase-containing whole-cell biocatalysts. Recombinant Escherichia coli W3110 containing the alkane monooxygenase AlkBGT and the outer membrane protein AlkL from Pseudomonas putida GPo1 have been shown to efficiently catalyze the terminal oxyfunctionalization of renewable fatty acid methyl esters yielding bifunctional products of interest for polymer synthesis. In this study, AlkBGTL-containing E. coli W3110 is shown to catalyze the multistep conversion of dodecanoic acid methyl ester (DAME) via terminal alcohol and aldehyde to the acid, exhibiting Michaelis-Menten-type kinetics for each reaction step. In two-liquid phase biotransformations, the product formation pattern was found to be controlled by DAME availability. Supplying DAME as bulk organic phase led to accumulation of the terminal alcohol as the predominant product. Limiting DAME availability via application of bis(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (BEHP) as organic carrier solvent enabled almost exclusive acid accumulation. Furthermore, utilization of BEHP enhanced catalyst stability by reducing toxic effects of substrate and products. A further shift towards the overoxidized products was achieved by co-expression of the gene encoding the alcohol dehydrogenase AlkJ, which was shown to catalyze efficient and irreversible alcohol to aldehyde oxidation in vivo. With DAME as organic phase, the aldehyde accumulated as main product using resting cells containing AlkBGT, AlkL, as well as AlkJ. This study highlights the versatility of whole-cell biocatalysis for synthesis of industrially relevant bifunctional building blocks and demonstrates how integrated reaction and catalyst engineering can be implemented to control product formation patterns in biocatalytic multistep reactions.
TI  - Chemoselective biocatalytic reduction of conjugated nitroalkenes: new application for an Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) expression strain.
AB  - Chemoselective reduction of activated carbon-carbon double bond in conjugated nitroalkenes was achieved using Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) whole cells. Nine different substrates have been used furnishing the reduced products in moderate to good yields. 1-Nitro-4-phenyl-1,3-butadiene and (2-nitro-1-propenyl)benzene were successfully biotransformed with corresponding product yields of 54% and 45% respectively. Using this simple and environmentally friendly system 2-(2-nitropropyl)pyridine and 2-(2-nitropropyl)naphthalene were synthesized and characterized for the first time. High substrate conversion efficiency was coupled with low enantioselectivity, however 29% enantiomeric excess was detected in the case of 2-(2-nitropropyl)pyridine. It was shown that electronic properties of the aromatic ring, which affected polarity of the double bond, were not highly influential factors in the reduction process, but the presence of the nitro functionality was essential for the reaction to proceed. 1-Phenyl-4-nitro-1,3-butadiene could not be biotransformed by whole cells of Pseudomonas putida KT2440 or Bacillus subtilis 168 while it was successfully reduced by E. coli DH5alpha but with lower efficiency in comparison to E. coli BL21(DE3). Knockout mutant affected in nemA gene coding for N-ethylmaleimide reductase (BL21DeltanemA) could still catalyze bioreductions suggesting multiple active reductases within E. coli BL21(DE3) biocatalyst. The described biocatalytic reduction of substituted nitroalkenes provides an efficient route for the preparation of the corresponding nitroalkanes and introduces the new application of the strain traditionally utilized for recombinant protein expression.
TI  - Enhancement of thermo-stability and product tolerance of Pseudomonas putida nitrile hydratase by fusing with self-assembling peptide.
AB  - Self-assembling amphipathic peptides (SAPs) are the peptides that can spontaneously assemble into ordered nanostructures. It has been reported that the attachment of SAPs to the N- or C-terminus of an enzyme can benefit the thermo-stability of the enzyme. Here, we discovered that the thermo-stability and product tolerance of nitrile hydratase (NHase) were enhanced by fusing with two of the SAPs (EAK16 and ELK16). When the ELK16 was fused to the N-terminus of beta-subunit, the resultant NHase (SAP-NHase-2) became an active inclusion body; EAK16 fused NHase in the N-terminus of beta-subunit (SAP-NHase-1) and ELK16 fused NHase in the C-terminus of beta-subunit (SAP-NHase-10) did not affect NHase solubility. Compared with the deactivation of the wild-type NHase after 30 min incubation at 50 degrees C, SAP-NHase-1, SAP-NHase-2 and SAP-NHase-10 retained 45%, 30% and 50% activity; after treatment in the buffer containing 10% acrylamide, the wild-type retained 30% activity, while SAP-NHase-1, SAP-NHase-2 and SAP-NHase-10 retained 52%, 42% and 55% activity. These SAP-NHases with enhanced thermo-stability and product tolerance would be helpful for further industrial applications of the NHase.
TI  - Engineering cellular robustness of microbes by introducing the GroESL chaperonins from extremophilic bacteria.
AB  - The cellular robustness is a big concern for efficient microbial production of biofuels and biochemicals. In this study, the groESL genes from extremophilic bacteria were found to serve as transplantable stress-response elements to improve diverse types of stress-tolerances of other microbes. By overexpressing the groESL from the solvent-tolerant Pseudomonas putida in Escherichia coli, its thermo-tolerance and ethanol-tolerance were significantly increased. Meanwhile, the groESL from the thermophilic Thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis endowed Clostridium acetobutylicum with improved corn cob hydrolysates (CCH)-tolerance as well as elevated butanol productivity. The chaperonins GroESL have been widely considered as cellular stress-response proteins and overexpression of native groESL has been proven to improve cellular tolerances facing various stresses. Here we found that the groESL genes from extremophilic bacteria were superior to the native ones, possibly because they have adapted to the environmental stresses during long-term natural evolution. Moreover, our results also revealed that different extreme groESL genes performed quite different in different microbes. Thus the relation and compatibility between the extremophiles and the host must be considered for selection of the proper groESL for engineering microbial robustness.
TI  - Studying bacterial hydrophobicity and biofilm formation at liquid-liquid interfaces through interfacial rheology and pendant drop tensiometry.
AB  - Bacterial adsorption to interfaces is a key factor in biofilm formation. One major limitation to understanding biofilm formation and development is the accurate measurement of bacterial cell adhesion to hydrophobic interfaces. With this study, bacterial attachment and biofilm growth over time at water-oil interface was monitored through interfacial rheology and tensiometry. Five model bacteria (Pseudomonas putida KT2442, Pseudomonas putida W2, Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, and Bacillus subtilis) were allowed to adsorb at the water-oil interface either in their non-growing or growing state. We found that we were able to observe the initial kinetics of bacterial attachment and the transient biofilm formation at the water-oil interface through interfacial rheology and tensiometry. Electrophoretic mobility measurements and bacterial adhesion to hydrocarbons (BATH) tests were performed to characterize the selected bacteria. To validate interfacial rheology and tensiometry measurements, we monitored biofilm formation utilizing both confocal laser scanning microscopy and light microscopy. Using this combination of techniques, we were able to observe the elasticity and tension development over time, from the first bacterial attachment up to biofilm formation.
TI  - A tricistronic heat shock operon is important for stress tolerance of Pseudomonas putida and conserved in many environmental bacteria.
AB  - Small heat shock proteins (sHsps) including the well-studied IbpA protein from Escherichia coli are molecular chaperones that bind to non-native proteins and prevent them from aggregation. We discovered an entirely unexplored tricistronic small heat shock gene cluster in Pseudomonas putida. The genes pp3314, pp3313 and pp3312 (renamed to hspX, hspY and hspZ respectively) are transcribed in a single transcript. In addition to sigma(32) -dependent transcriptional control, translation of the first and second gene of the operon is controlled by RNA thermometers with novel architectures. Biochemical analysis of HspY, HspZ and P. putida IbpA demonstrated that they assemble into homo-oligomers of different sizes whose quaternary structures alter in a temperature-dependent manner. IbpA and HspY are able to prevent the model substrate citrate synthase from thermal aggregation in vitro. Increased stress sensitivity of a P. putida strain lacking HspX, HspY and HspZ revealed an important role of these sHsps in stress adaptation. The hspXYZ operon is conserved among metabolically related bacteria that live in hostile environments including polluted soils. This heat shock operon might act as a protective system to promote survival in such ecological niches.
TI  - Expanding ester biosynthesis in Escherichia coli.
AB  - To expand the capabilities of whole-cell biocatalysis, we have engineered Escherichia coli to produce various esters. The alcohol O-acyltransferase (ATF) class of enzyme uses acyl-CoA units for ester formation. The release of free CoA upon esterification with an alcohol provides the free energy to facilitate ester formation. The diversity of CoA molecules found in nature in combination with various alcohol biosynthetic pathways allows for the biosynthesis of a multitude of esters. Small to medium volatile esters have extensive applications in the flavor, fragrance, cosmetic, solvent, paint and coating industries. The present work enables the production of these compounds by designing several ester pathways in E. coli. The engineered pathways generated acetate esters of ethyl, propyl, isobutyl, 2-methyl-1-butyl, 3-methyl-1-butyl and 2-phenylethyl alcohols. In particular, we achieved high-level production of isobutyl acetate from glucose (17.2 g l(-1)). This strategy was expanded to realize pathways for tetradecyl acetate and several isobutyrate esters.
TI  - Robustness of Pseudomonas putida KT2440 as a host for ethanol biosynthesis.
AB  - Expansion of the burgeoning biofuels agenda involves not only the design of suitable genetic and metabolic devices but also their deployment into suitable hosts that can endure the stress brought about by the products themselves. The microorganisms that are easiest to genetically manipulate for these endeavors (e.g. Escherichia coli) are often afflicted by an undesirable sensitivity to the very product that they are engineered to synthesize. In this context, we have examined the resistance to the stress arising from ethanol synthesis and/or its addition to cultures of recombinant Pseudomonas putida, using as a benchmark the same trait in an E. coli strain. To this end, ethanologenic strains of these two species were constructed by functionally expressing pdc (pyruvate decarboxylase) and adhB (alcohol dehydrogenase) from Zymomonas mobilis. Recombinants were compared under anoxic conditions as ethanol producers, and cell survival, stress resistance, and phenotypic stability were quantified in each case. P. putida consistently outperformed E. coli in every ethanol tolerance test conducted - whether the alcohol was produced endogenously or added exogenously. These results highlight the value of this bacterium as a microbial cell factory for the production of biofuels owing to its naturally pre-evolved ability to withstand different kinds of chemical stresses.
TI  - Survey of antibiotic-resistant bacteria isolated from bottlenose dolphins Tursiops truncatus in the southeastern USA.
AB  - Contamination of coastal waters can carry pathogens and contaminants that cause diseases in humans and wildlife, and these pathogens can be transported by water to areas where they are not indigenous. Marine mammals may be indicators of potential health effects from such pathogens and toxins. Here we isolated bacterial species of relevance to humans from wild bottlenose dolphins Tursiops truncatus and assayed isolated bacteria for antibiotic resistance. Samples were collected during capture-release dolphin health assessments at multiple coastal and estuarine sites along the US mid-Atlantic coast and the Gulf of Mexico. These samples were transported on ice and evaluated using commercial systems and aerobic culture techniques routinely employed in clinical laboratories. The most common bacteria identified were species belonging to the genus Vibrio, although Escherichia coli, Shewanella putrefaciens, and Pseudomonas fluorescens/putida were also common. Some of the bacterial species identified have been associated with human illness, including a strain of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) identified in 1 sample. Widespread antibiotic resistance was observed among all sites, although the percentage of resistant isolates varied across sites and across time. These data provide a baseline for future comparisons of the bacteria that colonize bottlenose dolphins in the southeastern USA.
TI  - Biochemical analysis of recombinant AlkJ from Pseudomonas putida reveals a membrane-associated, flavin adenine dinucleotide-dependent dehydrogenase suitable for the biosynthetic production of aliphatic aldehydes.
AB  - The noncanonical alcohol dehydrogenase AlkJ is encoded on the alkane-metabolizing alk operon of the mesophilic bacterium Pseudomonas putida GPo1. To gain insight into the enzymology of AlkJ, we have produced the recombinant protein in Escherichia coli and purified it to homogeneity using His6 tag affinity and size exclusion chromatography (SEC). Despite synthesis in the cytoplasm, AlkJ was associated with the bacterial cell membrane, and solubilization with n-dodecyl-beta-D-maltoside was necessary to liberate the enzyme. SEC and spectrophotometric analysis revealed a dimeric quaternary structure with stoichiometrically bound reduced flavin adenine dinucleotide (FADH2). The holoenzyme showed thermal denaturation at moderate temperatures around 35 degrees C, according to both activity assay and temperature-dependent circular dichroism spectroscopy. The tightly bound coenzyme was released only upon denaturation with SDS or treatment with urea-KBr and, after air oxidation, exhibited the characteristic absorption spectrum of FAD. The enzymatic activity of purified AlkJ for 1-butanol, 1-hexanol, and 1-octanol as well as the n-alkanol derivative omega-hydroxy lauric acid methyl ester (HLAMe) was quantified in the presence of the artificial electron acceptors phenazine methosulfate (PMS) and 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol (DCPIP), indicating broad substrate specificity with the lowest activity on the shortest alcohol, 1-butanol. Furthermore, AlkJ was able to accept as cosubstrates/oxidants the ubiquinone derivatives Q0 and Q1, also in conjunction with cytochrome c, which suggests coupling to the bacterial respiratory chain of this membrane-associated enzyme in its physiological environment. Using gas chromatographic analysis, we demonstrated specific biocatalytic conversion by AlkJ of the substrate HLAMe to the industrially relevant aldehyde, thus enabling the biotechnological production of 12-amino lauric acid methyl ester via subsequent enzymatic transamination.
TI  - Cyclic-AMP and bacterial cyclic-AMP receptor proteins revisited: adaptation for different ecological niches.
AB  - Escherichia coli cyclic-AMP receptor protein (CRP) represents one of the paradigms of bacterial gene regulation. Yet despite decades of intensive study, new information continues to emerge that prompts reassessment of this classic regulatory system. Moreover, in recent years CRPs from several other bacterial species have been characterized, allowing the general applicability of the CRP paradigm to be tested. Here the properties of the E. coli, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Pseudomonas putida CRPs are considered in the context of the ecological niches occupied by these bacteria. It appears that the cyclic-AMP-CRP regulatory system has been adapted to respond to distinct external and internal inputs across a broad sensitivity range that is, at least in part, determined by bacterial lifestyles.
TI  - Enhanced organic solvent tolerance of Escherichia coli by 3-hydroxyacid dehydrogenase family genes.
AB  - A 3-hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenase-encoding gene mmsB has been identified as one of the key genes responsible for the enhanced organic solvent tolerance (OST) of Pseudomonas putida JUCT1. In this study, the OST-related effect of two 3-hydroxyacid dehydrogenase family genes (mmsB and zwf) was investigated in Escherichia coli JM109. It was noted that the growth of E. coli JM109 was severely hampered in 4% decalin after zwf knockout. Additionally, its complementation resulted in significantly enhanced solvent tolerance compared with its parent strain. Furthermore, E. coli JM109 carrying mmsB showed better OST capacity than that harboring zwf. To construct E. coli strains with an inheritable OST phenotype, mmsB was integrated into the genome of E. coli JM109 by red-mediated recombination. Using E. coli JM109(DE3) (DeltaendA::mmsB) as host strain, whole-cell biocatalysis was successfully carried out in an aqueous/butyl acetate biphasic system with a remarkably improved product yield.
TI  - Improving kinetic or thermodynamic stability of an azoreductase by directed evolution.
AB  - Protein stability arises from a combination of factors which are often difficult  to rationalise. Therefore its improvement is better addressed through directed evolution than by rational design approaches. In this study, five rounds of mutagenesis/recombination followed by high-throughput screening ( approximately 10,000 clones) yielded the hit 1B6 showing a 300-fold higher half life at 50 degrees C than that exhibited by the homodimeric wild type PpAzoR azoreductase from Pseudomonas putida MET94. The characterization using fluorescence, calorimetry and light scattering shows that 1B6 has a folded state slightly less stable than the wild type (with lower melting and optimal temperatures) but in contrast is more resistant to irreversible denaturation. The superior kinetic stability of 1B6 variant was therefore related to an increased resistance of the unfolded monomers to aggregation through the introduction of mutations that disturbed hydrophobic patches and increased the surface net charge of the protein. Variants 2A1 and 2A1-Y179H with increased thermodynamic stability (10 to 20 degrees C higher melting temperature than wild type) were also examined showing the distinctive nature of mutations that lead to improved structural robustness: these occur in residues that are mostly involved in strengthening the solvent-exposed loops or the inter-dimer interactions of the folded state.
TI  - CRP-cyclic AMP dependent inhibition of the xylene-responsive sigma(54)-promoter Pu in Escherichia coli.
AB  - The expression of sigma(54)-dependent Pseudomonas putida Pu promoter is activated by XylR activator when cells are exposed to a variety of aromatic inducers. In this study, the transcriptional activation of the P. putida Pu promoter was recreated in the heterologous host Escherichia coli. Here we show that the cAMP receptor protein (CRP), a well-known carbon utilization regulator, had an inhibitory effect on the expression of Pu promoter in a cAMP-dependent manner. The inhibitory effect was not activator specific. In vivo KMnO4 and DMS footprinting analysis indicated that CRP-cAMP poised the RNA polymerase at Pu promoter, inhibiting the isomerization step of the transcription initiation even in the presence of an activator. Therefore, the presence of PTS-sugar, which eliminates cAMP, could activate the poised RNA polymerase at Pu promoter to transcribe. Moreover, the activation region 1 (AR1) of CRP, which interacts directly with the alphaCTD (C-terminal domain of alpha-subunit) of RNA polymerase, was found essential for the CRP-mediated inhibition at Pu promoter. A model for the above observations is discussed.
TI  - Biofilm models for the food industry: hot spots for plasmid transfer?
AB  - Biofilms represent a substantial problem in the food industry, with food spoilage, equipment failure, and public health aspects to consider. Besides, biofilms may be a hot spot for plasmid transfer, by which antibiotic resistance can be disseminated to potential foodborne pathogens. This study investigated biomass and plasmid transfer in dual-species (Pseudomonas putida and Escherichia coli) biofilm models relevant to the food industry. Two different configurations (flow-through and drip-flow) and two different inoculation procedures (donor-recipient and recipient-donor) were tested. The drip-flow configuration integrated stainless steel coupons in the setup while the flow-through configuration included a glass flow cell and silicone tubing. The highest biomass density [10 log (cells cm-(2))] was obtained in the silicone tubing when first the recipient strain was inoculated. High plasmid transfer ratios, up to 1/10 (transconjugants/total bacteria), were found. Depending on the order of inoculation, a difference in transfer efficiency between the biofilm models could be found. The ease by which the multiresistance plasmid was transferred highlights the importance of biofilms in the food industry as hot spots for the acquisition of multiresistance plasmids. This can impede the treatment of foodborne illnesses if pathogens acquire this multiresistance in or from the biofilm.
TI  - Expression, Purification and Characterization of the Proline Dehydrogenase Domain of PutA from Pseudomonas putida POS-F84.
AB  - The objective of the present work was to express a truncated form of Pseudomonas  putida PutA that shows proline dehydrogenase (ProDH) activity. The putA gene encoding ProDH enzyme was cloned into pET23a vector and expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL-21 (DE3) plysS. The recombinant P. putida enzyme was biochemically characterized and its three dimensional structure was also predicted. ProDH encoding sequence showed an open reading frame of 1,035-bp encoding a 345 amino acid residues polypeptide chain. Purified His-tagged enzyme gave a single band with a molecular mass of 40 kDa on SDS-PAGE. The molecular mass of the isolated enzyme was found to be about 40 kDa by gel filtration. This suggested that the enzyme of interest consists of one subunit. The K m and V max values of recombinant P. putida ProDH were estimated to be 31 mM and 132 mumol/min, respectively. The optimum pH and temperature for the catalytic activity of the enzyme was about pH 8.5 and 30 degrees C. The modeling analysis of the three dimensional structure elucidated that Ser-165, Lys-195 and Ala-252 were key residues for the ProDH activity. This study provides data on the cloning, sequencing and recombinant expression of PutA ProDH domain from P. putida POS-F84.
TI  - PCR-based amplification and heterologous expression of Pseudomonas alcohol dehydrogenase genes from the soil metagenome for biocatalysis.
AB  - The amplification of useful genes from metagenomes offers great biotechnological  potential. We employed this approach to isolate alcohol dehydrogenase (adh) genes from Pseudomonas to aid in the synthesis of optically pure alcohols from various ketones. A PCR primer combination synthesized by reference to the adh sequences of known Pseudomonas genes was used to amplify full-length adh genes directly from 17 samples of DNA extracted from soil. Three such adh preparations were used to construct Escherichia coli plasmid libraries. Of the approximately 2800 colonies obtained, 240 putative adh-positive clones were identified by colony-PCR. Next, 23 functional adh genes named using the descriptors HBadh and HPadh were analyzed. The adh genes obtained via this metagenomic approach varied in their DNA and amino acid sequences. Expression of the gene products in E. coli indicated varying substrate specificity. Two representative genes, HBadh-1 and HPadh-24, expressed in E. coli and Pseudomonas putida, respectively, were purified and characterized in detail. The enzyme products of these genes were confirmed to be useful for producing anti-Prelog chiral alcohols.
TI  - Virtual screening of mandelate racemase mutants with enhanced activity based on binding energy in the transition state.
AB  - Mandelate racemase (MR) is a promising candidate for the dynamic kinetic resolution of racemates. However, the poor activity of MR towards most of its non-natural substrates limits its widespread application. In this work, a virtual screening method based on the binding energy in the transition state was established to assist in the screening of MR mutants with enhanced catalytic efficiency. Using R-3-chloromandelic acid as a model substrate, a total of 53 mutants were constructed based on rational design in the two rounds of screening. The number of mutants for experimental validation was brought down to 17 by the virtual screening method, among which 14 variants turned out to possess improved catalytic efficiency. The variant V26I/Y54V showed 5.2-fold higher catalytic efficiency (k(cat)/K(m)) towards R-3-chloromandelic acid than that observed for the wild-type enzyme. Using this strategy, mutants were successfully obtained for two other substrates, R-mandelamide and R-2-naphthylglycolate (V26I and V29L, respectively), both with a 2-fold improvement in catalytic efficiency. These results demonstrated that this method could effectively predict the trend of mutational effects on catalysis. Analysis from the energetic and structural assays indicated that the enhanced interactions between the active sites and the substrate in the transition state led to improved catalytic efficiency. It was concluded that this virtual screening method based on the binding energy in the transition state was beneficial in enzyme rational redesign and helped to better understand the catalytic properties of the enzyme.
TI  - Interspecies signalling: Pseudomonas putida efflux pump TtgGHI is activated by indole to increase antibiotic resistance.
AB  - In Gram-negative bacteria, multidrug efflux pumps are responsible for the extrusion of chemicals that are deleterious for growth. Some of these efflux pumps are induced by endogenously produced effectors, while abiotic or biotic signals induce the expression of other efflux pumps. In Pseudomonas putida, the TtgABC efflux pump is the main antibiotic extrusion system that respond to exogenous antibiotics through the modulation of the expression of this operon mediated by TtgR. The plasmid-encoded TtgGHI efflux pump in P. putida plays a minor role in antibiotic resistance in the parental strain; however, its role is critical in isogenic backgrounds deficient in TtgABC. Expression of ttgGHI is repressed by the TtgV regulator that recognizes indole as an effector, although P. putida does not produce indole itself. Because indole is not produced by Pseudomonas, the indole-dependent antibiotic resistance seems to be part of an antibiotic resistance programme at the community level. Pseudomonas putida recognizes indole added to the medium or produced by Escherichia coli in mixed microbial communities. Transcriptomic analyses revealed that the indole-specific response involves activation of 43 genes and repression of 23 genes. Indole enhances not only the expression of the TtgGHI pump but also a set of genes involved in iron homeostasis, as well as genes for amino acid catabolism. In a ttgABC-deficient P. putida, background ampicillin and other bactericidal compounds lead to cell death. Co-culture of E. coli and P. putida DeltattgABC allowed growth of the P. putida mutant in the presence of ampicillin because of induction of the indole-dependent efflux pump.
TI  - Biochemical and structural analysis of RraA proteins to decipher their relationships with 4-hydroxy-4-methyl-2-oxoglutarate/4-carboxy-4-hydroxy-2-oxoadipate aldolases.
AB  - 4-Hydroxy-4-methyl-2-oxoglutarate (HMG)/4-carboxy-4-hydroxy-2-oxoadipate (CHA) aldolases are class II (divalent metal ion dependent) pyruvate aldolases from the meta cleavage pathways of protocatechuate and gallate. The enzyme from Pseudomonas putida F1 is structurally similar to a group of proteins termed regulators of RNase E activity A (RraA) that bind to the regulatory domain of RNase E and inhibit the ribonuclease activity in certain bacteria. Analysis of homologous RraA-like proteins from varying species revealed that they share sequence conservation within the active site of HMG/CHA aldolase. In particular, the P. putida F1 HMG/CHA aldolase has a D-X20-R-D motif, whereas a G-X20-R-D-X2-E/D motif is observed in the structures of the RraA-like proteins from Thermus thermophilus HB8 (TtRraA) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae S288C (Yer010Cp) that may support metal binding. TtRraA and Yer010Cp were found to contain HMG aldolase and oxaloacetate decarboxylase activities. Similar to the P. putida F1 HMG/CHA aldolase, both TtRraA and Yer010Cp enzymes required divalent metal ions for activity and were competitively inhibited by oxalate, a pyruvate enolate analogue, suggesting a common mechanism among the enzymes. The RraA from Escherichia coli (EcRraA) lacked detectable C-C lyase activity. Upon restoration of the G-X20-R-D-X2-E/D motif, by site-specific mutagenesis, the EcRraA variant was able to catalyze oxaloacetate decarboxylation. Sequence analysis of RraA-like gene products found across all the domains of life revealed conservation of the metal binding motifs that can likely support a divalent metal ion-dependent enzyme reaction either in addition to or in place of the putative RraA function.
TI  - Identification of 3-sulfinopropionyl coenzyme A (CoA) desulfinases within the Acyl-CoA dehydrogenase superfamily.
AB  - In a previous study, the essential role of 3-sulfinopropionyl coenzyme A (3SP-CoA) desulfinase acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (Acd) in Advenella mimigardefordensis strain DPN7(T) (AcdDPN7) during degradation of 3,3'-dithiodipropionic acid (DTDP) was elucidated. DTDP is a sulfur-containing precursor substrate for biosynthesis of polythioesters (PTEs). AcdDPN7 showed high amino acid sequence similarity to acyl-CoA dehydrogenases but was unable to catalyze a dehydrogenation reaction. Hence, it was investigated in the present study whether 3SP-CoA desulfinase activity is an uncommon or a widespread property within the acyl-CoA dehydrogenase superfamily. Therefore, proteins of the acyl-CoA dehydrogenase superfamily from Advenella kashmirensis WT001, Bacillus cereus DSM31, Cupriavidus necator N-1, Escherichia coli BL21, Pseudomonas putida KT2440, Burkholderia xenovorans LB400, Ralstonia eutropha H16, Variovorax paradoxus B4, Variovorax paradoxus S110, and Variovorax paradoxus TBEA6 were expressed in E. coli strains. All purified acyl-CoA dehydrogenases appeared as homotetramers, as revealed by size exclusion chromatography. AcdS110, AcdB4, AcdH16, and AcdKT2440 were able to dehydrogenate isobutyryl-CoA. AcdKT2440 additionally dehydrogenated butyryl-CoA and valeryl-CoA, whereas AcdDSM31 dehydrogenated only butyryl-CoA and valeryl-CoA. No dehydrogenation reactions were observed with propionyl-CoA, isovaleryl-CoA, succinyl-CoA, and glutaryl-CoA for any of the investigated acyl-CoA dehydrogenases. Only AcdTBEA6, AcdN-1, and AcdLB400 desulfinated 3SP-CoA and were thus identified as 3SP-CoA desulfinases within the acyl-CoA dehydrogenase family, although none of these three Acds dehydrogenated any of the tested acyl-CoA thioesters. No appropriate substrates were identified for AcdBL21 and AcdWT001. Spectrophotometric assays provided apparent Km and Vmax values for active substrates and indicated the applicability of phylogenetic analyses to predict the substrate range of uncharacterized acyl-CoA dehydrogenases. Furthermore, C. necator N-1 was found to utilize 3SP as the sole source of carbon and energy.
TI  - Periplasmic glucose-binding protein from Pseudomonas putida CSV86--identification of the glucose-binding pocket by homology-model-guided site-specific mutagenesis.
AB  - Glucose transport in Pseudomonas putida CSV86 is mediated via a periplasmic glucose-binding protein (GBP)-dependent putative glucose ABC transporter. Here we describe a homology model and functional characterization of GBP from CSV86 (ppGBP). A whole-cell [(14)C]-glucose uptake study revealed that glucose is transported by the high-affinity intracellular phosphorylative pathway. ppGBP was cloned, over-expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to apparent homogeneity. The purified ppGBPs from both E. coli and CSV86 were found to be specific for glucose. A homology model of ppGBP was constructed that resembles the class II family of periplasmic binding proteins. The model showed highest structural similarity to GBP of Thermus thermophilus (ttGBP, rmsd 0.64 A). Structural analysis and molecular docking studies predicted W35, W36, E41, K92, K339 and H379 of ppGBP as putative glucose-binding residues. Alanine substitution of these residues resulted in significantly reduced [(14)C]-glucose binding activity. Analysis of the operonic arrangement and structural comparative studies suggested that ppGBP and ttGBP probably originated from a common ancestor. Structural adaptations that inhibit binding of di- or trisaccharides at the glucose-binding pocket of ppGBP were also identified.
TI  - Functional assembly of camphor converting two-component Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenases with a flavin reductase from E. coli.
AB  - The major limitation in the synthetic application of two-component Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenases was addressed by identifying the 28-kDa flavin-reductase Fre from Escherichia coli as a suitable supplier of reduced FMN for these enzymes. Coexpression of Fre with either 2,5- or 3,6-diketocamphane monooxygenase from Pseudomonas putida NCIMB 10007 significantly enhanced the conversion of camphor and norcamphor serving as representative ketones. With purified enzymes, full conversion was achieved, while only slight amounts of product were formed in the absence of this flavin reductase. Fusion of the genes of Fre and DKCMOs into single open reading frame constructs resulted in unstable proteins exhibiting flavin reducing, but poor oxygenating activity, which led to overall decreased conversion of camphor.
TI  - Production of medium chain length fatty alcohols from glucose in Escherichia coli.
AB  - Metabolic engineering offers the opportunity to produce a wide range of commodity chemicals that are currently derived from petroleum or other non-renewable resources. Microbial synthesis of fatty alcohols is an attractive process because it can control the distribution of chain lengths and utilize low cost fermentation substrates. Specifically, primary alcohols with chain lengths of 12 to 14 carbons have many uses in the production of detergents, surfactants, and personal care products. The current challenge is to produce these compounds at titers and yields that would make them economically competitive. Here, we demonstrate a metabolic engineering strategy for producing fatty alcohols from glucose. To produce a high level of 1-dodecanol and 1-tetradecanol, an acyl-ACP thioesterase (BTE), an acyl-CoA ligase (FadD), and an acyl-CoA/aldehyde reductase (MAACR) were overexpressed in an engineered strain of Escherichia coli. Yields were improved by balancing expression levels of each gene, using a fed-batch cultivation strategy, and adding a solvent to the culture for extracting the product from cells. Using these strategies, a titer of over 1.6 g/L fatty alcohol with a yield of over 0.13 g fatty alcohol/g carbon source was achieved. These are the highest reported yield of fatty alcohols produced from glucose in E. coli.
TI  - Selective steroid oxyfunctionalisation by CYP154C5, a bacterial cytochrome P450.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cytochrome P450 monooxygenases--able to regio- and stereoselectively  hydroxylate non-activated carbon atoms--are important enzymes for the synthesis of valuable intermediates in the production of steroid hormones in the pharmaceutical industry. However, up to now only a few bacterial enzymes able to hydroxylate steroids have been reported. CYP154C5 from Nocardia farcinica IFM 10152, a bacterial P450 monooxygenase, was previously shown to convert testosterone to 16alpha-hydroxytestosterone. Since the hydroxylation at 16alpha-position is of special interest for the pharmaceutical industry, we have studied this enzyme in more detail to investigate its activity and selectivity in bioconversions of further steroids. RESULTS: CYP154C5 was coexpressed in Escherichia coli together with putidaredoxin and putidaredoxin reductase from Pseudomonas putida as redox partners for electron transfer and applied in bioconversions of various pregnanes and androstanes [pregnenolone (1), dehydroepiandrosterone (2), progesterone (3), androstenedione (4), testosterone (5) and nandrolone (6)]. Structure elucidation of the formed products revealed an exclusive regio- and stereoselectivity of CYP154C5, always yielding the corresponding 16alpha-hydroxylated steroids. Application of whole cells expressing the three components, P450, Pdx and PdR, in steroid biotransformations resulted in significantly higher conversions and total turnover numbers (TTN) compared to reactions using cell-free extracts. Additionally, considerably higher substrate loads (up to 15 mM) were tolerated by the whole-cell system. Furthermore, turnover numbers (TON) were determined for the six different steroids using whole cells. Thus, testosterone was found to be the worst substrate with a TON of only 0.8 mumol substrate consumed min-1 mumol(-1) CYP154C5, while progesterone and pregnenolone were converted the fastest resulting in TON of 3.3 mumol substrate consumed min(-1) mumol(-1) CYP154C5. CONCLUSION: CYP154C5 from N. farcinica constitutes a promising catalyst due to its high regio- and stereoselectivity in the hydroxylation of different steroids as well as its efficient expression in E. coli at high yields. Using this enzyme, 16alpha-hydroxylated steroids, which are important precursors for the synthesis of high value steroidal drugs in the pharmaceutical industry, can be selectively produced on preparative scale with TTN (mumol substrate consumed mumol(-1) CYP154C5) exceeding 2000.
TI  - Expression, purification, and characterization of formaldehyde dehydrogenase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - As a member of zinc-containing medium-chain alcohol dehydrogenase family, formaldehyde dehydrogenase (FDH) can oxidize toxic formaldehyde to less active formate with NAD(+) as a cofactor and exists in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Most FDHs are well known to be glutathione-dependent in the catalysis of formaldehyde oxidation, but the enzyme from Pseudomonas putida is an exception, which is independent of glutathione. To identify novel glutathione-independent FDHs from other bacterial strains and facilitate the corresponding structural and enzymatic studies, high-level soluble expression and efficient purification of these enzymes need to be achieved. Here, we present molecular cloning, expression, and purification of the FDH from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is a Gram-negative pathogenic bacterium causing opportunistic human infection. The FDH of P. aeruginosa shows high sequence identity (87.97%) with that of P. putida. Our results indicated that coexpression with molecular chaperones GroES, GroEL, and Tig has significantly attenuated inclusion body formation and improved the solubility of the recombinant FDH in Escherichiacoli cells. A purification protocol including three chromatographic steps was also established to isolate the recombinant FDH to homogeneity with a yield of approximately 3.2 mg from 1L of cell culture. The recombinant P. aeruginosa FDH was properly folded and biologically functional, as demonstrated by the mass spectrometric, crystallographic, and enzymatic characterizations of the purified proteins.
TI  - The novel bacterial N-demethylase PdmAB is responsible for the initial step of N,N-dimethyl-substituted phenylurea herbicide degradation.
AB  - The environmental fate of phenylurea herbicides has received considerable attention in recent decades. The microbial metabolism of N,N-dimethyl-substituted phenylurea herbicides can generally be initiated by mono-N-demethylation. In this study, the molecular basis for this process was revealed. The pdmAB genes in Sphingobium sp. strain YBL2 were shown to be responsible for the initial mono-N-demethylation of commonly used N,N-dimethyl-substituted phenylurea herbicides. PdmAB is the oxygenase component of a bacterial Rieske non-heme iron oxygenase (RO) system. The genes pdmAB, encoding the alpha subunit PdmA and the beta subunit PdmB, are organized in a transposable element flanked by two direct repeats of an insertion element resembling ISRh1. Furthermore, this transposable element is highly conserved among phenylurea herbicide-degrading sphingomonads originating from different areas of the world. However, there was no evidence of a gene for an electron carrier (a ferredoxin or a reductase) located in the immediate vicinity of pdmAB. Without its cognate electron transport components, expression of PdmAB in Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas putida, and other sphingomonads resulted in a functional enzyme. Moreover, coexpression of a putative [3Fe-4S]-type ferredoxin from Sphingomonas sp. strain RW1 greatly enhanced the catalytic activity of PdmAB in E. coli. These data suggested that PdmAB has a low specificity for electron transport components and that its optimal ferredoxin may be the [3Fe-4S] type. PdmA exhibited low homology to the alpha subunits of previously characterized ROs (less than 37% identity) and did not cluster with the RO group involved in O- or N-demethylation reactions, indicating that PdmAB is a distinct bacterial RO N-demethylase.
TI  - Pseudomonas putida AlkA and AlkB proteins comprise different defense systems for  the repair of alkylation damage to DNA - in vivo, in vitro, and in silico studies.
AB  - Alkylating agents introduce cytotoxic and/or mutagenic lesions to DNA bases leading to induction of adaptive (Ada) response, a mechanism protecting cells against deleterious effects of environmental chemicals. In Escherichia coli, the Ada response involves expression of four genes: ada, alkA, alkB, and aidB. In Pseudomonas putida, the organization of Ada regulon is different, raising questions regarding regulation of Ada gene expression. The aim of the presented studies was to analyze the role of AlkA glycosylase and AlkB dioxygenase in protecting P. putida cells against damage to DNA caused by alkylating agents. The results of bioinformatic analysis, of survival and mutagenesis of methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) or N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) treated P. putida mutants in ada, alkA and alkB genes as well as assay of promoter activity revealed diverse roles of Ada, AlkA and AlkB proteins in protecting cellular DNA against alkylating agents. We found AlkA protein crucial to abolish the cytotoxic but not the mutagenic effects of alkylans since: (i) the mutation in the alkA gene was the most deleterious for MMS/MNNG treated P. putida cells, (ii) the activity of the alkA promoter was Ada-dependent and the highest among the tested genes. P. putida AlkB (PpAlkB), characterized by optimal conditions for in vitro repair of specific substrates, complementation assay, and M13/MS2 survival test, allowed to establish conservation of enzymatic function of P. putida and E. coli AlkB protein. We found that the organization of P. putida Ada regulon differs from that of E. coli. AlkA protein induced within the Ada response is crucial for protecting P. putida against cytotoxicity, whereas Ada prevents the mutagenic action of alkylating agents. In contrast to E. coli AlkB (EcAlkB), PpAlkB remains beyond the Ada regulon and is expressed constitutively. It probably creates a backup system that protects P. putida strains defective in other DNA repair systems against alkylating agents of exo- and endogenous origin.
TI  - Photocatalytic bacterial inactivation by TiO2-coated surfaces.
AB  - The aim of this study was the evaluation of the photoactivated antibacterial activity of titanium dioxide (TiO2)-coated surfaces. Bacterial inactivation was evaluated using TiO2-coated Petri dishes. The experimental conditions optimized with Petri dishes were used to test the antibacterial effect of TiO2-coated ceramic tiles. The best antibacterial effect with Petri dishes was observed at 180, 60, 30 and 20 min of exposure for Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas putida and Listeria innocua, respectively. The ceramic tiles demonstrated a photoactivated bactericidal effect at the same exposure time. In general, no differences were observed between the antibacterial effect obtained with Petri dishes and tiles. However, the photochemical activity of Petri dishes was greater than the activity of the tiles.Results obtained indicates that the TiO2-coated surfaces showed a photoactivated bactericidal effect with all bacteria tested highlighting that the titania could be used in the ceramic and building industry for the production of coated surfaces to be placed in microbiologically sensitive environments, such as the hospital and food industry.
TI  - Degradation of chloroanilines by toluene dioxygenase from Pseudomonas putida T57.
AB  - In this study, we investigated the ability of Pseudomonas putida toluene dioxygenase to oxidize chloroanilines. Toluene-induced P. putida T57 cells degraded 4-chloroaniline (4CA) more rapidly than toluene-non-induced cells, suggesting that toluene dioxygenase pathway was involved in 4CA degradation. Escherichia coli harboring P. putida T57 genes encoding toluene dioxygenase complex (todC1C2BA) showed 4CA degradation activity, demonstrating that toluene dioxygenase oxidizes 4CA. Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and mass spectrometry (MS) analyses identified 4-chlorocatechol and 2-amino-5-chlorophenol as reaction products, suggesting that toluene dioxygenase catalyzes both 1,2- and 2,3-dioxygenation of 4CA. A plasmid containing the entire tod operon (todC1C2BADE) was introduced to P. putida T57 to enhance its ability to degrade 4CA. Resulting P. putida T57 (pHK-C1C2BADE) showed 250-fold higher 4CA degradation activity than P. putida T57 parental strain. P. putida T57 (pHK-C1C2BADE) degraded 2-chloroaniline (2CA), 3-chloroaniline (3CA), and 3,4-dichloroaniline (34DCA) as well as 4CA, but not 3,5-dichloroaniline (35DCA). The order of the degradation rate was: 4CA > 3CA > 2CA > 34DCA.
TI  - Crude glycerol as feedstock for the sustainable production of p-hydroxybenzoate by Pseudomonas putida S12.
AB  - Crude glycerol is a promising renewable feedstock in bioconversion processes for  the production of fuels and chemicals. Impurities present in crude glycerol can however, negatively impact the fermentation process. Successful crude glycerol utilization requires robust microbial production hosts that tolerate and preferably, can utilize such impurities. We investigated utilization of crude, unpurified glycerol as a substrate for the production of aromatic compounds by solvent tolerant Pseudomonas putida S12. In high-cell density fed-batch fermentations, P. putida S12 surprisingly performed better on crude glycerol than on purified glycerol. By contrast, growth of Escherichia coli was severely compromised under these high cell density cultivation conditions on crude glycerol. For P. putida S12 the biomass-to-substrate yield, maximum biomass production rate and substrate uptake rate were consistently higher on crude glycerol. Moreover, production of p-hydroxybenzoate by engineered P. putida S12palB5 on crude glycerol showed a 10% yield improvement over production on purified glycerol. P. putida S12 is a favorable host for bioconversion processes utilizing crude glycerol as a substrate. Its intrinsic stress-tolerance properties provide the robustness required for efficient growth and metabolism on this renewable substrate.
TI  - Cumate-inducible gene expression system for sphingomonads and other Alphaproteobacteria.
AB  - Tunable promoters represent a pivotal genetic tool for a wide range of applications. Here we present such a system for sphingomonads, a phylogenetically diverse group of bacteria that have gained much interest for their potential in bioremediation and their use in industry and for which no dedicated inducible gene expression system has been described so far. A strong, constitutive synthetic promoter was first identified through a genetic screen and subsequently combined with the repressor and the operator sites of the Pseudomonas putida F1 cym/cmt system. The resulting promoter, termed PQ5, responds rapidly to the inducer cumate and shows a maximal induction ratio of 2 to 3 orders of magnitude in the different sphingomonads tested. Moreover, it was also functional in other Alphaproteobacteria, such as the model organisms Caulobacter crescentus, Paracoccus denitrificans, and Methylobacterium extorquens. In the noninduced state, expression from PQ5 is low enough to allow gene depletion analysis, as demonstrated with the essential gene phyP of Sphingomonas sp. strain Fr1. A set of PQ5-based plasmids has been constructed allowing fusions to affinity tags or fluorescent proteins.
TI  - Structure of formaldehyde dehydrogenase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa: the binary complex with the cofactor NAD+.
AB  - Formaldehyde dehydrogenase (FDH) is a member of the zinc-containing medium-chain  alcohol dehydrogenase family which oxidizes toxic formaldehyde to formate using NAD(+) as an electron carrier. Three-dimensional structures have been reported for FDHs from several different species. Most FDHs are dependent on glutathione for catalysis, but the enzyme from Pseudomonas putida is an exception. In this structural communication, the recombinant production, crystallization and X-ray structure determination at 2.7 A resolution of FDH from P. aeruginosa are described. Both the tetrameric assembly and the NAD(+)-binding mode of P. aeruginosa FDH are similar to those of P. putida FDH, which is in good agreement with the high sequence identity (87.97%) between these two proteins. Preliminary enzymatic kinetics studies of P. aeruginosa FDH also revealed a conserved glutathione-independent `ping-pong' mechanism of formaldehyde oxidization.
TI  - Improving the lethal effect of cpl-7, a pneumococcal phage lysozyme with broad bactericidal activity, by inverting the net charge of its cell wall-binding module.
AB  - Phage endolysins are murein hydrolases that break the bacterial cell wall to provoke lysis and release of phage progeny. Recently, these enzymes have also been recognized as powerful and specific antibacterial agents when added exogenously. In the pneumococcal system, most cell wall associated murein hydrolases reported so far depend on choline for activity, and Cpl-7 lysozyme constitutes a remarkable exception. Here, we report the improvement of the killing activity of the Cpl-7 endolysin by inversion of the sign of the charge of the cell wall-binding module (from -14.93 to +3.0 at neutral pH). The engineered variant, Cpl-7S, has 15 amino acid substitutions and an improved lytic activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae (including multiresistant strains), Streptococcus pyogenes, and other pathogens. Moreover, we have demonstrated that a single 25-mug dose of Cpl-7S significantly increased the survival rate of zebrafish embryos infected with S. pneumoniae or S. pyogenes, confirming the killing effect of Cpl-7S in vivo. Interestingly, Cpl-7S, in combination with 0.01% carvacrol (an essential oil), was also found to efficiently kill Gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida, an effect not described previously. Our findings provide a strategy to improve the lytic activity of phage endolysins based on facilitating their pass through the negatively charged bacterial envelope, and thereby their interaction with the cell wall target, by modulating the net charge of the cell wall-binding modules.
TI  - Function of a glutamine synthetase-like protein in bacterial aniline oxidation via gamma-glutamylanilide.
AB  - Acinetobacter sp. strain YAA has five genes (atdA1 to atdA5) involved in aniline  oxidation as a part of the aniline degradation gene cluster. From sequence analysis, the five genes were expected to encode a glutamine synthetase (GS)-like protein (AtdA1), a glutamine amidotransferase-like protein (AtdA2), and an aromatic compound dioxygenase (AtdA3, AtdA4, and AtdA5) (M. Takeo, T. Fujii, and Y. Maeda, J. Ferment. Bioeng. 85:17-24, 1998). A recombinant Pseudomonas strain harboring these five genes quantitatively converted aniline into catechol, demonstrating that catechol is the major oxidation product from aniline. To elucidate the function of the GS-like protein AtdA1 in aniline oxidation, we purified it from recombinant Escherichia coli harboring atdA1. The purified AtdA1 protein produced gamma-glutamylanilide (gamma-GA) quantitatively from aniline and l-glutamate in the presence of ATP and MgCl2. This reaction was identical to glutamine synthesis by GS, except for the use of aniline instead of ammonia as the substrate. Recombinant Pseudomonas strains harboring the dioxygenase genes (atdA3 to atdA5) were unable to degrade aniline but converted gamma-GA into catechol, indicating that gamma-GA is an intermediate to catechol and a direct substrate for the dioxygenase. Unexpectedly, a recombinant Pseudomonas strain harboring only atdA2 hydrolyzed gamma-GA into aniline, reversing the gamma-GA formation by AtdA1. Deletion of atdA2 from atdA1 to atdA5 caused gamma-GA accumulation from aniline in recombinant Pseudomonas cells and inhibited the growth of a recombinant Acinetobacter strain on aniline, suggesting that AtdA2 prevents gamma-GA accumulation that is harmful to the host cell.
TI  - Functional characterization of the bacterial iac genes for degradation of the plant hormone indole-3-acetic acid.
AB  - Pseudomonas putida 1290 is a model organism for the study of bacterial degradation of the plant hormone indole-3-acetic acid (IAA). This property is encoded by the iac gene cluster. Insertional inactivation and/or deletion of individual iac genes and heterologous expression of the gene cluster in Escherichia coli were combined with mass spectrometry to demonstrate that iac-based degradation of IAA is likely to involve 2-hydroxy-IAA, 3-hydroxy-2-oxo-IAA, and catechol as intermediates. The first gene of the cluster, iacA encodes for the first step in the pathway, and also can convert indole to indoxyl to produce the blue pigment indigo. Transcriptional profiling of iac genes in P. putida 1290 revealed that they were induced in the presence of IAA. Based on results with an iacR knockout, we propose that this gene codes for a repressor of iacA expression and that exposure to IAA relieves this repression. Transformation of P. putida KT2440 (which cannot degrade IAA) with the iac gene cluster conferred the ability to grow on IAA as a sole source of carbon and energy, but not the ability to chemotaxi towards IAA. We could show such tactic response for P. putida 1290, thus representing the first demonstration of bacterial chemotaxis towards IAA. We discuss the ecological significance of our findings, and specifically the following question: under what circumstances do bacteria with the ability to degrade, recognize, and move towards IAA have a selective advantage?
TI  - Identification, structure, and function of a novel type VI secretion peptidoglycan glycoside hydrolase effector-immunity pair.
AB  - Bacteria employ type VI secretion systems (T6SSs) to facilitate interactions with prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Despite the widespread identification of T6SSs among Gram-negative bacteria, the number of experimentally validated substrate effector proteins mediating these interactions remains small. Here, employing an informatics approach, we define novel families of T6S peptidoglycan glycoside hydrolase effectors. Consistent with the known intercellular self-intoxication exhibited by the T6S pathway, we observe that each effector gene is located adjacent to a hypothetical open reading frame encoding a putative periplasmically localized immunity determinant. To validate our sequence-based approach, we functionally investigate a representative family member from the soil-dwelling bacterium Pseudomonas protegens. We demonstrate that this protein is secreted in a T6SS-dependent manner and that it confers a fitness advantage in growth competition assays with Pseudomonas putida. In addition, we determined the 1.4 A x-ray crystal structure of this effector in complex with its cognate immunity protein. The structure reveals the effector shares highest overall structural similarity to a glycoside hydrolase family associated with peptidoglycan N-acetylglucosaminidase activity, suggesting that T6S peptidoglycan glycoside hydrolase effector families may comprise significant enzymatic diversity. Our structural analyses also demonstrate that self-intoxication is prevented by the immunity protein through direct occlusion of the effector active site. This work significantly expands our current understanding of T6S effector diversity.
TI  - A cell wall recycling shortcut that bypasses peptidoglycan de novo biosynthesis.
AB  - We report a salvage pathway in Gram-negative bacteria that bypasses de novo biosynthesis of UDP N-acetylmuramic acid (UDP-MurNAc), the first committed peptidoglycan precursor, and thus provides a rationale for intrinsic fosfomycin resistance. The anomeric sugar kinase AmgK and the MurNAc alpha-1-phosphate uridylyl transferase MurU, defining this new cell wall sugar-recycling route in Pseudomonas putida, were characterized and engineered into Escherichia coli, channeling external MurNAc directly to peptidoglycan biosynthesis.
TI  - New dye-decolorizing peroxidases from Bacillus subtilis and Pseudomonas putida MET94: towards biotechnological applications.
AB  - This work provides spectroscopic, catalytic, and stability fingerprints of two new bacterial dye-decolorizing peroxidases (DyPs) from Bacillus subtilis (BsDyP) and Pseudomonas putida MET94 (PpDyP). DyPs are a family of microbial heme-containing peroxidases with wide substrate specificity, including high redox potential aromatic compounds such as synthetic dyes or phenolic and nonphenolic lignin units. The genes encoding BsDyP and PpDyP, belonging to subfamilies A and B, respectively, were cloned and heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli. The recombinant PpDyP is a 120-kDa homotetramer while BsDyP enzyme consists of a single 48-kDa monomer. The optimal pH of both enzymes is in the acidic range (pH 4-5). BsDyP has a bell-shape profile with optimum between 20 and 30 degrees C whereas PpDyP shows a peculiar flat and broad (10-30 degrees C) temperature profile. Anthraquinonic or azo dyes, phenolics, methoxylated aromatics, and also manganese and ferrous ions are substrates used by the enzymes. In general, PpDyP exhibits higher activities and accepts a wider scope of substrates than BsDyP; the spectroscopic data suggest distinct heme microenvironments in the two enzymes that might account for the distinctive catalytic behavior. However, the Bs enzyme with activity lasting for up to 53 h at 40 degrees C is more stable towards temperature or chemical denaturation than the PpDyP. The results of this work will guide future optimization of the biocatalytis towards their utilization in the fields of environmental or industrial biotechnology.
TI  - [The new gene encoding TrfA-type replication initiator has been found on caprolactam/salicylate degradation plasmid pBS270].
AB  - The mini-replicon of pseudomonads' caprolactam/salicylate degradation plasmid pBS270 (105 kb, contains incompatibility determinants of P-7 group) has been obtained and its nucleotide sequence has been determined. The new gene encoding TrfA-like replication initiator has been found on this replicon. Poor homology of this replication initiator with known proteins of TrfA-family allows us to classify obtained replicon as IncP-1-like. The pBS270mini reveals chimeric nature.
TI  - Microbial production of the aromatic building-blocks (S)-styrene oxide and (R)-1,2-phenylethanediol from renewable resources.
AB  - (S)-Styrene oxide and (R)-1,2-phenylethanediol are chiral aromatic molecular building blocks used commonly as precursors to pharmaceuticals and other specialty chemicals. Two pathways have been engineered in Escherichia coli for their individual biosynthesis directly from glucose. The novel pathways each constitute extensions of the previously engineered styrene pathway, developed by co-expressing either styrene monooxygenase (SMO) or styrene dioxygenase (SDO) to convert styrene to (S)-styrene oxide and (R)-1,2-phenylethanediol, respectively. StyAB from Pseudomonas putida S12 was determined to be the most effective SMO. SDO activity was achieved using NahAaAbAcAd of Pseudomonas sp. NCIB 9816-4, a naphthalene dioxygenase with known broad substrate specificity. Production of phenylalanine, the precursor to both pathways, was systematically enhanced through a number of mutations, most notably via deletion of tyrA and over-expression of tktA. As a result, (R)-1,2-phenylethanediol reached titers as high as 1.23 g/L, and at 1.32 g/L (S)-styrene oxide titers already approach their toxicity limit. As with other aromatics, product toxicity was strongly correlated with a model of membrane accumulation and disruption. This study additionally demonstrates that greater flux through the styrene pathway can be achieved if its toxicity is addressed, as achieved in this case by reacting styrene to less toxic products.
TI  - Role for ferredoxin:NAD(P)H oxidoreductase (FprA) in sulfate assimilation and siderophore biosynthesis in Pseudomonads.
AB  - Pyridine-2,6-bis(thiocarboxylate) (PDTC), produced by certain pseudomonads, is a  sulfur-containing siderophore that binds iron, as well as a wide range of transition metals, and it affects the net hydrolysis of the environmental contaminant carbon tetrachloride. The pathway of PDTC biosynthesis has not been defined. Here, we performed a transposon screen of Pseudomonas putida DSM 3601 to identify genes necessary for PDTC production (Pdt phenotype). Transposon insertions within genes for sulfate assimilation (cysD, cysNC, and cysG [cobA2]) dominated the collection of Pdt mutations. In addition, two insertions were within the gene for the LysR-type transcriptional activator FinR (PP1637). Phenotypic characterization indicated that finR mutants were cysteine bradytrophs. The Pdt phenotype of finR mutants could be complemented by the known target of FinR regulation, fprA (encoding ferredoxin:NADP(+) oxidoreductase), or by Escherichia coli cysJI (encoding sulfite reductase). These data indicate that fprA is necessary for effective sulfate assimilation by P. putida and that the effect of finR mutation on PDTC production was due to deficient expression of fprA and sulfite reduction. fprA expression in both P. putida and P. aeruginosa was found to be regulated by FinR, but in a manner dependent upon reduced sulfur sources, implicating FinR in sulfur regulatory physiology. The genes and phenotypes identified in this study indicated a strong dependence upon intracellular reduced sulfur/cysteine for PDTC biosynthesis and that pseudomonads utilize sulfite reduction enzymology distinct from that of E. coli and possibly similar to that of chloroplasts and other proteobacteria.
TI  - Anti-biofilm forming and anti-quorum sensing activity of selected essential oils  and their main components on food-related micro-organisms.
AB  - AIMS: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of clary sage, juniper, lemon and marjoram essential oils (EOs) and their major components on the formation of bacterial and yeast biofilms and on the inhibition of AHL-mediated quorum sensing (QS). METHODS AND RESULTS: Biofilm formation was measured by crystal violet and resazurin staining, and QS inhibition was detected by paper disc diffusion assay. Marjoram EO inhibited Bacillus cereus, Pichia anomala, Pseudomonas putida and mixed-culture biofilm formation of Ps. putida and Escherichia coli and showed the best QS inhibitor effect on Chromobacterium violaceum. For B. cereus, all components showed better antibiofilm capacity than the parent EOs. Lemon EO inhibited E. coli and mixed-culture biofilms, and cinnamon was effective against the mixed forms. Scanning electron microscopy showed the loss of three-dimensional structures of biofilms. CONCLUSIONS: The EOs and components used seem to be good candidates for prevention of biofilm formation and inhibition of the AHL-mediated QS mechanism. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Biofilm formation on foods and food industrial equipment is a serious problem causing food spoilage and emergence of foodborne diseases. This article highlights the importance of studying EOs as potential disinfectants and food preservatives.
TI  - Functional characterization and application of a tightly regulated MekR/P mekA expression system in Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - A methyl ethyl ketone (MEK)-inducible system based on the broad-host-range plasmid pBBR1MCS2 and on the P mekA promoter region of the MEK degradation operon of Pseudomonas veronii MEK700 was characterized in Escherichia coli JM109 and Pseudomonas putida KT2440. For validation, beta-galactosidase (lacZ) was used as a reporter. The novel system, which is positively regulated by MekR, a member of the AraC/XylS family of regulators, was shown to be subject to carbon catabolite repression by glucose, which, however, could not be attributed to the single action of the global regulators Crc and PtsN. An advantage is its extremely tight regulation accompanied with three magnitudes of fold increase of gene expression after treatment with MEK. The transcriptional start site of P mekA was identified by primer extension, thereby revealing a potential stem-loop structure at the 5' end of the mRNA. Since MekR was highly insoluble, its putative binding site was identified through sequence analysis. The operator seems to be composed of a 15-bp tandem repeat (CACCN5CTTCAA) separated by a 6-bp spacer region, which resembles known binding patterns of other members of the AraC/XylS family. Subsequent mutational modifications of the putative operator region confirmed its importance for transcriptional activation. As the -35 promoter element seems to be overlapped by the putative operator, a class II activation mechanism is assumed.
TI  - Engineered Escherichia coli for short-chain-length medium-chain-length polyhydroxyalkanoate copolymer biosynthesis from glycerol and dodecanoate.
AB  - Short-chain-length medium-chain-length polyhydroxyalkanoate (SCL-MCL PHA) copolymers are promising as bio-plastics with properties ranging from thermoplastics to elastomers. In this study, the hybrid pathway for the biosynthesis of SCL-MCL PHA copolymers was established in recombinant Escherichia coli by co-expression of beta-ketothiolase (PhaARe) and NADPH-dependent acetoacetyl-CoA reductase (PhaBRe) from Ralstonia eutropha together with PHA synthases from R. eutropha (PhaCRe), Aeromonas hydrophila (PhaCAh), and Pseudomonas putida (PhaC2Pp) and with (R)-specific enoyl-CoA hydratases from P. putida (PhaJ1Pp and PhaJ4Pp), and A. hydrophila (PhaJAh). When glycerol supplemented with dodecanoate was used as primary carbon source, E. coli harboring various combinations of PhaABCJ produced SCL-MCL PHA copolymers of various monomer compositions varying from C4 to C10. In addition, polymer property analysis suggested that the copolymers produced from this recombinant source have thermal properties (lower glass transition and melting temperatures) superior to polyhydroxybutyrate homopolymer.
TI  - Engineering of a hybrid biotransformation system for cytochrome P450sca-2 in Escherichia coli.
AB  - P450sca-2 is an industrially important enzyme that stereoselectively converts mevastatin into pravastatin. However, little information or engineering efforts have been reported for this enzyme or its redox partner. In this study, we successfully reconstituted the P450sca-2 activity in Escherichia coli by co-expression with putidaredoxin reductase (Pdr) and putidaredoxin (Pdx) from the Pseudomonas putida cytochrome P450cam system. With an HPLC-based screening assay, random mutagenesis was applied to yield a mutant (R8-5C) with a pravastatin yield of the whole-cell biotransformation 4.1-fold that of the wild type. P450sca-2 wild-type and R8-5C were characterized in terms of mevastatin binding and hydroxylation, electron transfer, and circular dichroism spectroscopy. R8-5C showed an active P450 expression level that was 3.8-fold that of the wild type, with relatively smaller changes in the apparent k(cat)/K(M) with respect to the substrate mevastatin (1.3-fold) or Pdx (1.5-fold) compared with the wild type. Thus, the increase in the pravastatin yield of the whole-cell biotransformation primarily came from the improved active P450 expression, which has resulted largely from better heme incorporation, although none of the six mutations of R8-5C are located near the heme active site. These results will facilitate further engineering of this P450sca-2 system and provide useful clues for improving other hybrid P450 systems.
TI  - Short ROSE-like RNA thermometers control IbpA synthesis in Pseudomonas species.
AB  - The bacterial small heat shock protein IbpA protects client proteins from aggregation. Due to redundancy in the cellular chaperone network, deletion of the ibpA gene often leads to only a mild or no phenotypic defect. In this study, we show that a Pseudomonas putida ibpA deletion mutant has a severe growth defect under heat stress conditions and reduced survival during recovery revealing a critical role of IbpA in heat tolerance. Transcription of the ibpA gene depends on the alternative heat shock sigma factor sigma(32). Production of IbpA protein only at heat shock temperatures suggested additional translational control. We conducted a comprehensive structural and functional analysis of the 5' untranslated regions of the ibpA genes from P. putida and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Both contain a ROSE-type RNA thermometer that is substantially shorter and simpler than previously reported ROSE elements. Comprised of two hairpin structures only, they inhibit translation at low temperature and permit translation initiation after a temperature upshift. Both elements regulate reporter gene expression in Escherichia coli and ribosome binding in vitro in a temperature-dependent manner. Structure probing revealed local melting of the second hairpin whereas the first hairpin remained unaffected. High sequence and structure conservation of pseudomonal ibpA untranslated regions and their ability to confer thermoregulation in vivo suggest that short ROSE-like thermometers are commonly used to control IbpA synthesis in Pseudomonas species.
TI  - Characterization of flavin-based fluorescent proteins: an emerging class of fluorescent reporters.
AB  - Fluorescent reporter proteins based on flavin-binding photosensors were recently  developed as a new class of genetically encoded probes characterized by small size and oxygen-independent maturation of fluorescence. Flavin-based fluorescent proteins (FbFPs) address two major limitations associated with existing fluorescent reporters derived from the green fluorescent protein (GFP)-namely, the overall large size and oxygen-dependent maturation of fluorescence of GFP. However, FbFPs are at a nascent stage of development and have been utilized in only a handful of biological studies. Importantly, a full understanding of the performance and properties of FbFPs as a practical set of biological probes is lacking. In this work, we extensively characterize three FbFPs isolated from Pseudomonas putida, Bacillus subtilis, and Arabidopsis thaliana, using in vitro studies to assess probe brightness, oligomeric state, maturation time, fraction of fluorescent holoprotein, pH tolerance, redox sensitivity, and thermal stability. Furthermore, we validate FbFPs as stable molecular tags using in vivo studies by constructing a series of FbFP-based transcriptional constructs to probe promoter activity in Escherichia coli. Overall, FbFPs show key advantages as broad-spectrum biological reporters including robust pH tolerance (4-11), thermal stability (up to 60 degrees C), and rapid maturation of fluorescence (<3 min.). In addition, the FbFP derived from Arabidopsis thaliana (iLOV) emerged as a stable and nonperturbative reporter of promoter activity in Escherichia coli. Our results demonstrate that FbFP-based reporters have the potential to address key limitations associated with the use of GFP, such as pH-sensitive fluorescence and slow kinetics of fluorescence maturation (10-40 minutes for half maximal fluorescence recovery). From this view, FbFPs represent a useful new addition to the fluorescent reporter protein palette, and our results constitute an important framework to enable researchers to implement and further engineer improved FbFP-based reporters with enhanced brightness and tighter flavin binding, which will maximize their potential benefits.
TI  - Particle-cell contact enhances antibacterial activity of silver nanoparticles.
AB  - BACKGROUND: It is generally accepted that antibacterial properties of Ag nanoparticles (AgNPs) are dictated by their dissolved fraction. However, dissolution-based concept alone does not fully explain the toxic potency of nanoparticulate silver compared to silver ions. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Herein, we demonstrated that the direct contact between bacterial cell and AgNPs' surface enhanced the toxicity of nanosilver. More specifically, cell-NP contact increased the cellular uptake of particle-associated Ag ions - the single and ultimate cause of toxicity. To prove that, we evaluated the toxicity of three different AgNPs (uncoated, PVP-coated and protein-coated) to six bacterial strains: Gram-negative Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas fluorescens, P. putida and P. aeruginosa and Gram-positive Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus. While the toxicity of AgNO3 to these bacteria varied only slightly (the 4-h EC50 ranged from 0.3 to 1.2 mg Ag/l), the 4-h EC50 values of protein-coated AgNPs for various bacterial strains differed remarkably, from 0.35 to 46 mg Ag/l. By systematically comparing the intracellular and extracellular free Ag(+) liberated from AgNPs, we demonstrated that not only extracellular dissolution in the bacterial test environment but also additional dissolution taking place at the particle-cell interface played an essential role in antibacterial action of AgNPs. The role of the NP-cell contact in dictating the antibacterial activity of Ag-NPs was additionally proven by the following observations: (i) separation of bacterial cells from AgNPs by particle-impermeable membrane (cut-off 20 kDa, approximately 4 nm) significantly reduced the toxicity of AgNPs and (ii) P. aeruginosa cells which tended to attach onto AgNPs, exhibited the highest sensitivity to all forms of nanoparticulate Ag. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings provide new insights into the mode of antibacterial action of nanosilver and explain some discrepancies in this field, showing that "Ag-ion" and "particle-specific" mechanisms are not controversial but, rather, are two faces of the same coin.
TI  - Strategy for successful expression of the Pseudomonas putida nitrile hydratase activator P14K in Escherichia coli.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Activators of Nitrile hydratase (NHase) are essential for functional  NHase biosynthesis. However, the activator P14K in P. putida is difficult to heterogeneously express, which retards the clarification of the mechanism of P14K involved in the maturation of NHase. Although a strep tag containing P14K (strep-P14K) was over-expressed, its low expression level and low stability affect the further analysis. RESULTS: We successfully expressed P14K through genetic modifications according to N-end rule and analyzed the mechanism for its difficult expression. We found that mutation of the second N-terminal amino-acid of the protein from lysine to alanine or truncating the N-terminal 16 amino-acid sequence resulted in successful expression of P14K. Moreover, fusion of a pelB leader and strep tag together (pelB-strep-P14K) at the N-terminus increased P14K expression. In addition, the pelB-strep-P14K was more stable than the strep-P14K. CONCLUSIONS: Our results are not only useful for clarification of the role of P14K involved in the NHase maturation, but also helpful for heterologous expression of other difficult expression proteins.
TI  - Bacterial tethering analysis reveals a "run-reverse-turn" mechanism for Pseudomonas species motility.
AB  - We have developed a program that can accurately analyze the dynamic properties of tethered bacterial cells. The program works especially well with cells that tend to give rise to unstable rotations, such as polar-flagellated bacteria. The program has two novel components. The first dynamically adjusts the center of the cell's rotational trajectories. The second applies piecewise linear approximation to the accumulated rotation curve to reduce noise and separate the motion of bacteria into phases. Thus, it can separate counterclockwise (CCW) and clockwise (CW) rotations distinctly and measure rotational speed accurately. Using this program, we analyzed the properties of tethered Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas putida cells for the first time. We found that the Pseudomonas flagellar motor spends equal time in both CCW and CW phases and that it rotates with the same speed in both phases. In addition, we discovered that the cell body can remain stationary for short periods of time, leading to the existence of a third phase of the flagellar motor which we call "pause." In addition, P. aeruginosa cells adopt longer run lengths, fewer pause frequencies, and shorter pause durations as part of their chemotactic response. We propose that one purpose of the pause phase is to allow the cells to turn at a large angle, where we show that pause durations in free-swimming cells positively correlate with turn angle sizes. Taken together, our results suggest a new "run-reverse-turn" paradigm for polar-flagellated Pseudomonas motility that is different from the "run-and-tumble" paradigm established for peritrichous Escherichia coli.
TI  - Inhibitory effect of Pseudomonas putida nitrogen-related phosphotransferase system on conjugative transfer of IncP-9 plasmid from Escherichia coli.
AB  - Conjugative plasmid transfer systems have been well studied, but very little is known about the recipient factors that control horizontal transmission. A self-transmissible IncP-9 naphthalene catabolic plasmid, NAH7, carries the traF gene, whose product is considered to be a host-range modifier of NAH7, because its traF deletion mutant (NAH7dF) is transmissible from Pseudomonas putida to P. putida and Escherichia coli and from E. coli to E. coli, but not from E. coli to P. putida. In this study, transposon mutagenesis of P. putida KT2440 was performed to isolate the mutants that could receive NAH7dF from E. coli. The mutants had the transposon insertions in ptsP or ptsO, encoding two of three components of the nitrogen-related phosphotransferase system (PTS(Ntr) ). The KT2440 derivative lacking ptsN, encoding the remaining component of PTS(Ntr) , was also able to receive NAH7dF. These results indicated that the PTS(Ntr) in P. putida is involved in inhibition of conjugative transfer of NAH7dF from E. coli. Our further experiments using site-directed mutants suggested the indirect involvement of the phosphorylated form of PtsO in the inhibition of the conjugative transfer. Conjugative transfer of NAH7 and another IncP-9 plasmid, pWW0, from E. coli was partially inhibited by the PtsO function in KT2440.
TI  - Anthranilate degradation by a cold-adapted Pseudomonas sp.
AB  - An alpine soil bacterium Pseudomonas sp. strain PAMC 25931 was characterized as eurypsychrophilic (both psychrophilic and mesotolerant) with a broad temperature range of 5-30 degrees C both for anthranilate (2-aminobenzoate) degradation and concomitant cell growth. Two degradative gene clusters (antABC and catBCA) were detected from a fosmid clone in the PAMC 25931 genomic library; each cluster was confirmed to be specifically induced by anthranilate. When expressed in Escherichia coli, the recombinant AntABC (anthranilate 1,2-dioxygenase, AntDO) converted anthranilate into catechol, exhibiting strict specificity toward anthranilate. Recombinant CatA (catechol 1,2-dioxygenase, C12O) from the organism was active over a broad temperature range (5-37 degrees C). However, CatA rapidly lost the enzyme activity when incubated at above 25 degrees C. For example, 1 h-preincubation at 37 degrees C resulted in 100% loss of enzyme activity, while a counterpart from mesophilic Pseudomonas putida mt-2 did not show any negative effect on the initial enzyme activity. These results suggest that CatA is a new cold-adapted thermolabile enzyme, which might be a product through the adaptation process of PAMC 25931 to naturally cold environments and contribute to its ability to grow on anthranilate there.
TI  - Broad host range vectors for expression of proteins with (Twin-) Strep-tag, His-tag and engineered, export optimized yellow fluorescent protein.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In current protein research, a limitation still is the production of  active recombinant proteins or native protein associations to assess their function. Especially the localization and analysis of protein-complexes or the identification of modifications and small molecule interaction partners by co-purification experiments requires a controllable expression of affinity- and/or fluorescence tagged variants of a protein of interest in its native cellular background. Advantages of periplasmic and/or homologous expressions can frequently not be realized due to a lack of suitable tools. Instead, experiments are often limited to the heterologous production in one of the few well established expression strains. RESULTS: Here, we introduce a series of new RK2 based broad host range expression plasmids for inducible production of affinity- and fluorescence tagged proteins in the cytoplasm and periplasm of a wide range of Gram negative hosts which are designed to match the recently suggested modular Standard European Vector Architecture and database. The vectors are equipped with a yellow fluorescent protein variant which is engineered to fold and brightly fluoresce in the bacterial periplasm following Sec-mediated export, as shown from fractionation and imaging studies. Expression of Strep-tag(R)II and Twin-Strep-tag(R) fusion proteins in Pseudomonas putida KT2440 is demonstrated for various ORFs. CONCLUSION: The broad host range constructs we have produced enable good and controlled expression of affinity tagged protein variants for single-step purification and qualify for complex co-purification experiments. Periplasmic export variants enable production of affinity tagged proteins and generation of fusion proteins with a novel engineered Aequorea-based yellow fluorescent reporter protein variant with activity in the periplasm of the tested Gram-negative model bacteria Pseudomonas putida KT2440 and Escherichia coli K12 for production, localization or co-localization studies. In addition, the new tools facilitate metabolic engineering and yield assessment for cytoplasmic or periplasmic protein production in a number of different expression hosts when yields in one initially selected are insufficient.
TI  - A new large-DNA-fragment delivery system based on integrase activity from an integrative and conjugative element.
AB  - During the past few decades, numerous plasmid vectors have been developed for cloning, gene expression analysis, and genetic engineering. Cloning procedures typically rely on PCR amplification, DNA fragment restriction digestion, recovery, and ligation, but increasingly, procedures are being developed to assemble large synthetic DNAs. In this study, we developed a new gene delivery system using the integrase activity of an integrative and conjugative element (ICE). The advantage of the integrase-based delivery is that it can stably introduce a large DNA fragment (at least 75 kb) into one or more specific sites (the gene for glycine-accepting tRNA) on a target chromosome. Integrase recombination activity in Escherichia coli is kept low by using a synthetic hybrid promoter, which, however, is unleashed in the final target host, forcing the integration of the construct. Upon integration, the system is again silenced. Two variants with different genetic features were produced, one in the form of a cloning vector in E. coli and the other as a mini-transposable element by which large DNA constructs assembled in E. coli can be tagged with the integrase gene. We confirmed that the system could successfully introduce cosmid and bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) DNAs from E. coli into the chromosome of Pseudomonas putida in a site-specific manner. The integrase delivery system works in concert with existing vector systems and could thus be a powerful tool for synthetic constructions of new metabolic pathways in a variety of host bacteria.
TI  - High specificity in CheR methyltransferase function: CheR2 of Pseudomonas putida  is essential for chemotaxis, whereas CheR1 is involved in biofilm formation.
AB  - Chemosensory pathways are a major signal transduction mechanism in bacteria. CheR methyltransferases catalyze the methylation of the cytosolic signaling domain of chemoreceptors and are among the core proteins of chemosensory cascades. These enzymes have primarily been studied Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium, which possess a single CheR involved in chemotaxis. Many other bacteria possess multiple cheR genes. Because the sequences of chemoreceptor signaling domains are highly conserved, it remains to be established with what degree of specificity CheR paralogues exert their activity. We report here a comparative analysis of the three CheR paralogues of Pseudomonas putida. Isothermal titration calorimetry studies show that these paralogues bind the product of the methylation reaction, S-adenosylhomocysteine, with much higher affinity (KD of 0.14-2.2 muM) than the substrate S-adenosylmethionine (KD of 22-43 muM), which indicates product feedback inhibition. Product binding was particularly tight for CheR2. Analytical ultracentrifugation experiments demonstrate that CheR2 is monomeric in the absence and presence of S-adenosylmethionine or S-adenosylhomocysteine. Methylation assays show that CheR2, but not the other paralogues, methylates the McpS and McpT chemotaxis receptors. The mutant in CheR2 was deficient in chemotaxis, whereas mutation of CheR1 and CheR3 had either no or little effect on chemotaxis. In contrast, biofilm formation of the CheR1 mutant was largely impaired but not affected in the other mutants. We conclude that CheR2 forms part of a chemotaxis pathway, and CheR1 forms part of a chemosensory route that controls biofilm formation. Data suggest that CheR methyltransferases act with high specificity on their cognate chemoreceptors.
TI  - The solution structures of two prophage homologues of the bacteriophage lambda Ea8.5 protein reveal a newly discovered hybrid homeodomain/zinc-finger fold.
AB  - A cluster of genes in the exoxis region of bacteriophage lambda are capable of inhibiting the initiation of DNA synthesis in Escherichia coli. The most indispensible gene in this region is ea8.5. Here, we report the nuclear magnetic resonance structures of two ea8.5 orthologs from enteropathogenic E. coli and Pseudomonas putida prophages. Both proteins are characterized by a fused homeodomain/zinc-finger fold that escaped detection by primary sequence search methods. While these folds are both associated with a nucleic acid binding function, the amino acid composition suggests otherwise, leading to the possibility that Ea8.5 associates with other viral and host proteins.
TI  - [Selection of initiation replication mutants of IncP-9 plasmid pBS267].
AB  - A minireplicon containing the rep gene and oriV site of the gamma subgroup of the IncP-9 caprolactam pBS267 biodegradation plasmid was cloned for the first time. It was established that a minimized variant of pBS267 plasmid cannot be sustained in E. coli and is inherited in an unstable way in bacteria Pseudomonas. Using in vitro mutagenesis, mutant variants of the minireplicon were produced, characterized by an increased number of copies in cells, the ability to replicate in E. coli, and relatively stable inheritance in P. putida cells. The obtained constructs are the basis for a study of the replication mechanisms of IncP-9 group plasmids, as well as use as vectors for molecular cloning in a wide range of gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - The impact of the conjugative IncP-1 plasmid pKJK5 on multispecies biofilm formation is dependent on the plasmid host.
AB  - Horizontal gene transfer by conjugation has been reported to increase overall biofilm formation. Biofilm is considered a hot spot for plasmid transfer, and it has been found that social interactions during biofilm formation can increase the biomass. In this study, we demonstrate a contrast to previous studies by showing that the conjugative IncP-1 plasmid pKJK5 influences biofilm formation negatively. The results showed that a co-culture (Pseudomonas putida, Kluyvera sp., and Escherichia coli) formed significantly more biofilm than the strains did individually. When pKJK5 was inserted into P. putida, biofilm formation was significantly reduced compared with the co-culture without plasmid. A nonconjugative version of pKJK5 was also used, and the biofilm formation was restored. Visualization with the BioFlux 1000 facility showed that the presence of pKJK5-containing P. putida in the co-culture led to a changed biofilm structure, where the cells showed a higher tendency to attach to other cells rather than surfaces. This study thus indicates that the presence of conjugative plasmids in some species may decrease the surface-associated biofilm formation of a mixed co-culture by facilitating cell-cell attachment with reduced surface attachment as the consequence.
TI  - Transcription factor-based screens and synthetic selections for microbial small-molecule biosynthesis.
AB  - Continued advances in metabolic engineering are increasing the number of small molecules being targeted for microbial production. Pathway yields and productivities, however, are often suboptimal, and strain improvement remains a persistent challenge given that the majority of small molecules are difficult to screen for and their biosynthesis does not improve host fitness. In this work, we have developed a generalized approach to screen or select for improved small-molecule biosynthesis using transcription factor-based biosensors. Using a tetracycline resistance gene 3' of a small-molecule inducible promoter, host antibiotic resistance, and hence growth rate, was coupled to either small-molecule concentration in the growth medium or a small-molecule production phenotype. Biosensors were constructed for two important chemical classes, dicarboxylic acids and alcohols, using transcription factor-promoter pairs derived from Pseudomonas putida, Thauera butanivorans, or E. coli. Transcription factors were selected for specific activation by either succinate, adipate, or 1-butanol, and we demonstrate product-dependent growth in E. coli using all three compounds. The 1-butanol biosensor was applied in a proof-of-principle liquid culture screen to optimize 1-butanol biosynthesis in engineered E. coli, identifying a pathway variant yielding a 35% increase in 1-butanol specific productivity through optimization of enzyme expression levels. Lastly, to demonstrate the capacity to select for enzymatic activity, the 1-butanol biosensor was applied as synthetic selection, coupling in vivo 1-butanol biosynthesis to E. coli fitness, and an 120-fold enrichment for a 1-butanol production phenotype was observed following a single round of positive selection.
TI  - Decaffeination and measurement of caffeine content by addicted Escherichia coli with a refactored N-demethylation operon from Pseudomonas putida CBB5.
AB  - The widespread use of caffeine (1,3,7-trimethylxanthine) and other methylxanthines in beverages and pharmaceuticals has led to significant environmental pollution. We have developed a portable caffeine degradation operon by refactoring the alkylxanthine degradation (Alx) gene cluster from Pseudomonas putida CBB5 to function in Escherichia coli. In the process, we discovered that adding a glutathione S-transferase from Janthinobacterium sp. Marseille was necessary to achieve N 7 -demethylation activity. E. coli cells with the synthetic operon degrade caffeine to the guanine precursor, xanthine. Cells deficient in de novo guanine biosynthesis that contain the refactored operon are ''addicted'' to caffeine: their growth density is limited by the availability of caffeine or other xanthines. We show that the addicted strain can be used as a biosensor to measure the caffeine content of common beverages. The synthetic N-demethylation operon could be useful for reclaiming nutrient-rich byproducts of coffee bean processing and for the cost-effective bioproduction of methylxanthine drugs.
TI  - [Investigation of the presence of New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1 (NDM-1) by PCR in carbapenem-resistant gram-negative isolates].
AB  - Bacteria producing New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1 (NDM-1) exhibit high level  resistance to beta-lactams including carbapenems. This broad-spectrum resistance limits treatment options for infections caused by NDM-1 producers. NDM-1 was first isolated from an Indian patient in Sweden; since then, NDM-1 producing isolates have been identified in many countries including Turkey. In this study, we investigated the presence of NDM-1 by PCR method in various gram-negative isolates recovered from clinical specimens in tertiary care hospitals in Samsun, Turkey. A total of 210 carbapenem-resistant gram-negative isolates (132 Acinetobacter baumannii, 54 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 5 Pseudomonas putida, 8 Enterobacter cloacae, 3 Enterobacter aerogenes, 3 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 2 Providencia rettgeri, 2 Escherichia coli and 1 Citrobacter freundii) were included in the study. Identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing of the isolates were performed by using Vitek-2 Compact (bioMerieux, France) and BD Phoenix (BD Diagnostic Systems, MD) automated systems. The results of antibiotic susceptibility testing were interpreted according to the CLSI recommendations. In our study, NDM-1 gene was not detected in any of the clinical isolates by PCR. There was only one case study that reported the presence of NDM-1 in clinical isolates from Turkey [Poirel L et al. Antimicrob Agents Chemother 2012;56:2784]. Our data, together with the others, indicated that the existence of NDM-1 in clinical isolates is not common in Turkey. However, since NDM-1 is a plasmid-encoded enzyme, there is always a risk of spread of this resistance through the bacterial strains in our country. Therefore, continuous surveillance and investigation of carbapenem-resistant isolates with resistance patterns suggestive of NDM-1 may enable to identify NDM-1 producing isolates. Meanwhile special care should be given on rational antibiotic use and establishment of appropriate infection control policies to prevent the spread of NDM-1 producers and other potential resistant strains.
TI  - Effects of shear on initial bacterial attachment in slow flowing systems.
AB  - Initial bacterial attachment, likely affected by local shear, could influence biofilm formation. However, there are contradictory reports for the shear effects on attachment of different bacteria onto different surfaces. In this study, four bacteria, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas putida, and Escherichia coli, were examined for their attachment to glass and octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) modified glass under different shears. Polystyrene particles were used to verify that their shear dependent attachment on glass and OTS could be interpreted using an analysis based on the extended Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (XDLVO) theory. In particular, the critical shear force (F(c-shear)) could correlate with the maximum attractive force (F(MAX)(XDLVO)) toward the secondary energy minimum as F(c-shear)=cF(MAX)(XDLVO). For these particles, c of ~1 was obtained, the value was within the coefficient range (0.1-1) of substances sliding over glass. For S. epidermidis, E. coli and P. aeruginosa on glass, c was 0.3, <0.6 and 0.2, respectively. When considering potential protein adsorption on OTS during bacterial attachment, c of these species on OTS was slightly above 1. A greatly enhanced attachment of P. aeruginosa on OTS was also observed, probably due to the presence of flagella. For P. putida, the attachment first decreased slightly or maintained with shear and then increased. Such behaviors were probably caused by the increased secretion of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) at higher shears by P. putida. The results from this study suggested that, without complications from surface features/EPS, the analysis based on the XDLVO theory could provide a basis for understanding shear effect on initial bacterial attachment.
TI  - A phthalate family oxygenase reductase supports terpene alcohol oxidation by CYP238A1 from Pseudomonas putida KT2440.
AB  - CYP238A1, one of the two P450 enzymes in the genome of Pseudomonas putida KT2440, has been produced heterologously in Escherichia coli, purified, and found to bind acyclic and cyclic terpene alcohols such as farnesol, nerolidol, linalool, and terpineol. The other P450 enzyme in this organism (gene locus: PP1950) was also produced in E. coli but no substrate has been identified from a limited screen. A phthalate family oxygenase reductase (PFOR) encoded by the PP1957 gene, just downstream of the PP1955 gene for CYP238A1, accepts electrons from the reduced form of both nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate and is able to support monooxygenase activity of CYP238A1, both in vitro and in E. coli, in which both enzymes are produced. CYP238A1 oxidizes cis- and trans-nerolidol to the 9-hydroxy product, with no evidence of attack at the olefinic double bonds. The NADH turnover rate of 170 nmol(nmol-P450)(-)(1) Min(-)(1) for CYP238A1 with cis-nerolidol as substrate at a PP1957:CYP238A1 concentration ratio of 8:1 suggests that this PFOR could function as the physiological redox partner for CYP238A1. The physiological role of CYP238A1 may be related to the PP1955 gene being part of an island/cluster of inducible genes associated with energy metabolism and response to xenobiotics.
TI  - Microbial utilization of aqueous co-products from hydrothermal liquefaction of microalgae Nannochloropsis oculata.
AB  - Hydrothermal liquefaction of algae biomass is a promising technology for the production of sustainable biofuels, but the non-oil, aqueous co-product of the process has only been examined to a limited extent. The aqueous phase from liquefaction of the alga Nannochloropsis oculata (AqAl) was used to make growth media for model heterotrophic microorganisms Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas putida, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Growth rates, yields, and carbon/nitrogen/phosphorus uptake were measured. E. coli and P. putida could grow using AqAl as the sole C, N, and P source in media containing 10 vol.%-40 vol.% AqAl with the best growth occurring at 20 vol.%. S. cerevisiae could grow under these conditions only if the media were supplemented with glucose. The results indicate that in a biorefinery utilizing algae liquefaction, the aqueous co-product may be recycled via microbial cultures with significantly less dilution than previously published methods.
TI  - From waste to plastic: synthesis of poly(3-hydroxypropionate) in Shimwellia blattae.
AB  - In recent years, glycerol has become an attractive carbon source for microbial processes, as it accumulates massively as a by-product of biodiesel production, also resulting in a decline of its price. A potential use of glycerol in biotechnology is the synthesis of poly(3-hydroxypropionate) [poly(3HP)], a biopolymer with promising properties which is not synthesized by any known wild-type organism. In this study, the genes for 1,3-propanediol dehydrogenase (dhaT) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (aldD) of Pseudomonas putida KT2442, propionate-coenzyme A (propionate-CoA) transferase (pct) of Clostridium propionicum X2, and polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) synthase (phaC1) of Ralstonia eutropha H16 were cloned and expressed in the 1,3-propanediol producer Shimwellia blattae. In a two-step cultivation process, recombinant S. blattae cells accumulated up to 9.8% +/- 0.4% (wt/wt [cell dry weight]) poly(3HP) with glycerol as the sole carbon source. Furthermore, the engineered strain tolerated the application of crude glycerol derived from biodiesel production, yielding a cell density of 4.05 g cell dry weight/liter in a 2-liter fed-batch fermentation process.
TI  - Camphor pathway redux: functional recombinant expression of 2,5- and 3,6-diketocamphane monooxygenases of Pseudomonas putida ATCC 17453 with their cognate flavin reductase catalyzing Baeyer-Villiger reactions.
AB  - Whereas the biochemical properties of the monooxygenase components that catalyze  the oxidation of 2,5-diketocamphane and 3,6-diketocamphane (2,5-DKCMO and 3,6-DKCMO, respectively) in the initial catabolic steps of (+) and (-) isomeric forms of camphor (CAM) metabolism in Pseudomonas putida ATCC 17453 are relatively well characterized, the actual identity of the flavin reductase (Fred) component that provides the reduced flavin to the oxygenases has hitherto been ill defined. In this study, a 37-kDa Fred was purified from a camphor-induced culture of P. putida ATCC 17453 and this facilitated cloning and characterization of the requisite protein. The active Fred is a homodimer with a subunit molecular weight of 18,000 that uses NADH as an electron donor (Km = 32 muM), and it catalyzes the reduction of flavin mononucleotide (FMN) (Km = 3.6 muM; kcat = 283 s(-1)) in preference to flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) (Km = 19 muM; kcat = 128 s(-1)). Sequence determination of approximately 40 kb of the CAM degradation plasmid revealed the locations of two isofunctional 2,5-DKCMO genes (camE25-1 for 2,5-DKCMO-1 and camE25-2 for 2,5-DKCMO-2) as well as that of a 3,6-DKCMO-encoding gene (camE36). In addition, by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, the CAM plasmid was established to be linear and approximately 533 kb in length. To enable functional assessment of the two-component monooxygenase system in Baeyer-Villiger oxidations, recombinant plasmids expressing Fred in tandem with the respective 2,5-DKCMO- and 3,6-DKCMO-encoding genes in Escherichia coli were constructed. Comparative substrate profiling of the isofunctional 2,5-DCKMOs did not yield obvious differences in Baeyer-Villiger biooxidations, but they are distinct from 3,6-DKCMO in the stereoselective oxygenations with various mono- and bicyclic ketone substrates.
TI  - A comparative analysis of the properties of regulated promoter systems commonly used for recombinant gene expression in Escherichia coli.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Production of recombinant proteins in bacteria for academic and commercial purposes is a well established field; however the outcomes of process developments for specific proteins are still often unpredictable. One reason is the limited understanding of the performance of expression cassettes relative to each other due to different genetic contexts. Here we report the results of a systematic study aiming at exclusively comparing commonly used regulator/promoter systems by standardizing the designs of the replicon backbones. RESULTS: The vectors used in this study are based on either the RK2- or the pMB1- origin of replication and contain the regulator/promoter regions of XylS/Pm (wild-type), XylS/Pm ML1-17 (a Pm variant), LacI/PT7lac, LacI/Ptrc and AraC/PBAD to control expression of different proteins with various origins. Generally and not unexpected high expression levels correlate with high replicon copy number and the LacI/PT7lac system generates more transcript than all the four other cassettes. However, this transcriptional feature does not always lead to a correspondingly more efficient protein production, particularly if protein functionality is considered. In most cases the XylS/Pm ML1-17 and LacI/PT7lac systems gave rise to the highest amounts of functional protein production, and the XylS/Pm ML1-17 is the most flexible in the sense that it does not require any specific features of the host. The AraC/PBAD system is very good with respect to tightness, and a commonly used bioinformatics prediction tool (RBS calculator) suggested that it has the most translation-efficient UTR. Expression was also studied by flow cytometry in individual cells, and the results indicate that cell to cell heterogeneity is very relevant for understanding protein production at the population level. CONCLUSIONS: The choice of expression system needs to be evaluated for each specific case, but we believe that the standardized vectors developed for this study can be used to more easily identify the nature of case-specific bottlenecks. By then taking into account the relevant characteristics of each expression cassette it will be easier to make the best choice with respect to the goal of achieving high levels of protein expression in functional or non-functional form.
TI  - Biotransformation of isoflavone using enzymatic reactions.
AB  - The roles of cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (CYPs) from Streptomyces spp. which are called the "treasure islands" for natural products for medicine and antibiotics are not well understood. Substrate specificity studies on CYPs may give a solution for elucidation of their roles. Based on homology sequence information, the CYP105D7 of a soluble cytochrome P450 known as heme protein from Streptomyces avermitilis MA4680 was expressed using the T7 promoter of the bacterial expression vector pET24ma, over-expressed in Escherichia coli system and characterized. An engineered whole cell system for daidzein hydroxylation was constructed using an exogenous electron transport system from ferredoxin reductase (PdR) and ferredoxin (Pdx). Also, an in vitro reaction study showed the purified CYP105D7 enzyme, using NADH-dependent-reducing equivalents of a redox partner from Pseudomonas putida, hydroxylated daidzein at the 3' position of the B ring to produce 7,3,'4' trihydroxyisoflavone. The hydroxylated position was confirmed by GC-MS analysis. The turnover number of the enzyme was 0.69 mumol 7,3,'4'-trihydroxyisoflavone produced per mumol P450 per min. This enzyme CYP105D7 represents a novel type of 3'-hydroxylase for daidzein hydroxylation. A P450 inhibitor such as coumarin significantly (ca.98%) inhibited the daidzein hydroxylation activity.
TI  - A thermostable and organic-solvent tolerant esterase from Pseudomonas putida ECU1011: catalytic properties and performance in kinetic resolution of alpha-hydroxy acids.
AB  - A novel esterase, rPPE01, from Pseudomonas putida ECU1011 was heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli and identified for enzymatic resolution of hydroxy acids via O-deacetylation. alpha-Acetoxy carboxylates were converted with approximately 50% yield and excellent enantioselectivity (E>200) at a substrate concentration of 100 mM. The half-lives of rPPE01 were 14 days at 50 degrees C and 30 days at 30 degrees C, indicating the enzyme has relatively high thermostability. Another remarkable advantage of rPPE01 is that both the activity and thermostability were enhanced significantly in the presence of hydrophobic alkanes and ethers. rPPE01 retained 159% of its initial activity after incubation with 50% (v/v) n-heptane at 30 degrees C for 60 days. The attractive organic-solvent tolerance, good thermostability and high enantioselectivity towards alpha-acetoxy carboxylates endow rPPE01 with the potential of practical application for the production of enantiopure hydroxy acids.
TI  - Oxidative decarboxylation of mandelic acid derivative by recombinant Escherichia  coli: a novel method of ethyl vanillin synthesis.
AB  - The benzoylformate decarboxylase gene (mdlC) from Pseudomonas putida was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). The recombinant strain together with E. coli/pET30a-mdlB converted (S)-3-ethoxy-4-hydroxymandelic acid (S-EMA) into ethyl vanillin without ethyl vanillin degradation. 4 g ethyl vanillin/l was obtained from 10 g EMA/l within 12 h at 30 degrees C. This is the first report on the biotransformation of (S)-EMA to ethyl vanillin.
TI  - Regulated expression systems for the development of whole-cell biocatalysts expressing oxidative enzymes in a sequential manner.
AB  - This work reports the preparation of two recombinant strains each containing two  enzymatic activities mutually expressed through regulated systems for production of functionalized epoxides in one-pot reactions. One strain was Pseudomonas putida PaW340, containing the gene coding for styrene monooxygenase (SMO) from Pseudomonas fluorescens ST under the auto-inducing Ptou promoter and the TouR regulator of Pseudomonas sp. OX1 and the gene coding for naphthalene dihydrodiol dehydrogenase (NDDH) from P. fluorescens N3 under the Ptac promoter inducible by IPTG. The second strain was Escherichia coli JM109, in which the expression of SMO was under the control of the Pnah promoter and the NahR regulator of P. fluorescens N3 inducible by salicylate, while the gene expressing NDDH was under the control of the Plac promoter inducible by IPTG. SMO and NDDH activities were tested in bioconversion experiments using cinnamyl alcohol as reference substrate. The application that we selected is one example of the sequential use of the two enzymatic activities which require a temporal control of the expression of both genes.
TI  - Targeted disinfection of E. coli via bioconjugation to photoreactive TiO2.
AB  - The selective control of pathogenic bacteria is an ongoing challenge. A strategy  is proposed that combines targeted binding of the bacterium, using antibodies, with their photoactivated oxidative destruction. Photoactive colloidal TiO2 was first derivatized with E. coli antibodies (EA-TiO2). When mixtures of the organisms E. coli and Pseudomonas putida ( P. putida ) were exposed to modified EA-TiO2, the particles preferentially selected E. coli for surface binding. Two consequences arose from surface bioconjugation: bacteria were found to flocculate upon mixing at appropriate ratios of EA-TiO2/ E. coli , and EA-TiO2-bound E. coli underwent cell death after exposure to UV light. In the former case, flocculation of the bacteria was optimal at ~50 EA-TiO2 particles per E. coli . Selective flocculation provides an alternative strategy for pathogen removal. With respect to UV disinfection, as few as 26 EA-TiO2 particles per E. coli gave a 10 000-fold decrease in viable bacteria. Thus, it is possible to selectively target and kill one type of bacteria in a mixture of pathogens. The results give support to the proposal that photocatalytic TiO2 most effectively delivers an oxidizing agent when the titania is bound to the bacterial surface.
TI  - Proteomic analysis of Pseudomonas putida reveals an organic solvent tolerance-related gene mmsB.
AB  - Organic solvents are toxic to most microorganisms. However, some organic-solvent-tolerant (OST) bacteria tolerate the destructive effects of organic solvent through various accommodative mechanisms. In this work, we developed an OST adapted strain Pseudomonas putida JUCT1 that could grow in the presence of 60% (v/v) cyclohexane. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was used to compare and analyze the total cellular protein of P. putida JUCT1 growing with or without 60% (v/v) cyclohexane. Under different solvent conditions, five high-abundance protein spots whose intensity values show over 60% discrepancies were identified by MALDI-TOF/TOF spectra. Specifically, they are arginine deiminase, carbon-nitrogen hydrolase family putative hydrolase, 3-hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenase, protein chain elongation factor EF-Ts, and isochorismatase superfamily hydrolase. The corresponding genes of the latter three proteins, mmsB, tsf, and PSEEN0851, were separately expressed in Escherichia coli to evaluate their effect on OST properties of the host strain. In the presence of 4% (v/v) cyclohexane, E. coli harboring mmsB could grow to 1.70 OD(660), whereas cell growth of E. coli JM109 (the control) was completely inhibited by 2% (v/v) cyclohexane. Transformants carrying tsf or PSEEN0851 also showed an increased resistance to cyclohexane and other organic solvents compared with the control. Of these three genes, mmsB exhibited the most prominent effect on increasing OST of E. coli. Less oxidation product of cyclohexane was detected because mmsB transformants might help keep a lower intracellular cyclohexane level. This study demonstrates a feasible approach for elucidating OST mechanisms of microorganisms, and provides molecular basis to construct organic-solvent-tolerant strains for industrial applications.
TI  - Taxis of Pseudomonas putida F1 toward phenylacetic acid is mediated by the energy taxis receptor Aer2.
AB  - The phenylacetic acid (PAA) degradation pathway is a widely distributed funneling pathway for the catabolism of aromatic compounds, including the environmental pollutants styrene and ethylbenzene. However, bacterial chemotaxis to PAA has not been studied. The chemotactic strain Pseudomonas putida F1 has the ability to utilize PAA as a sole carbon and energy source. We identified a putative PAA degradation gene cluster (paa) in P. putida F1 and demonstrated that PAA serves as a chemoattractant. The chemotactic response was induced during growth with PAA and was dependent on PAA metabolism. A functional cheA gene was required for the response, indicating that PAA is sensed through the conserved chemotaxis signal transduction system. A P. putida F1 mutant lacking the energy taxis receptor Aer2 was deficient in PAA taxis, indicating that Aer2 is responsible for mediating the response to PAA. The requirement for metabolism and the role of Aer2 in the response indicate that P. putida F1 uses energy taxis to detect PAA. We also revealed that PAA is an attractant for Escherichia coli; however, a mutant lacking a functional Aer energy receptor had a wild-type response to PAA in swim plate assays, suggesting that PAA is detected through a different mechanism in E. coli. The role of Aer2 as an energy taxis receptor provides the potential to sense a broad range of aromatic growth substrates as chemoattractants. Since chemotaxis has been shown to enhance the biodegradation of toxic pollutants, the ability to sense PAA gradients may have implications for the bioremediation of aromatic hydrocarbons that are degraded via the PAA pathway.
TI  - Appraising freeze-drying for storage of bacteria and their ready access in a rapid toxicity assessment assay.
AB  - Direct toxicity assessment (DTA) techniques seek to measure the impact of toxic chemicals on biological materials resident in the environment. This study features the use of freeze-dried bacterial cells in combination with a rapid DTA analyser, SciTOX. The effects of three factors-cryoprotectant type, bacterial strain, and storage temperature-were tested in order to validate the shelf life of the freeze-dried cells. Three freeze-dried Gram-negative bacterial strains, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida, were tested by using the bacteria in the SciTox() DTA assay and recording their responses to two standard toxicants: 2,4-dicholorophenol and 3,5-dichlorophenol. Each freeze-dried strain of bacteria was prepared in two forms--either pre-treatment with polyethylene glycol (PEG) or with sucrose/Tween 80--prior to storing at either 4 or -20 degrees C for three different storage periods (1, 2 or 3 months). While the sucrose/Tween 80 pre-treated freeze-dried cells exhibited better cell viability, we concluded that PEG was a more suitable cryoprotectant for the bacteria used in the DTA assay because of EC50 parity with fresh cell and zero-time freeze-dried cell assays. The results showed that freeze-dried cells, with appropriate materials and conditions, can give reproducible DTA results for up to 3 months. The availability of a biocomponent that can be activated by simple rehydration makes the deployment of this technology much easier for an end user.
TI  - Synthesis of multifunctional bioresponsive polymers for the management of chronic wounds.
AB  - Novel multifunctional bioresponsive gelatin and alginate based hydrogels with in-built antioxidant regenerating system and antimicrobial properties were successfully synthesized. These hydrogels are based on the versatile reactions catalyzed by cellobiose dehydrogenase (CDH). CDH uses cellobiose and cello-oligosacharides as electron donors to reduce oxidized phenolic antioxidants, quinones, or molecular oxygen to H(2)O(2) (a well-known antimicrobial agent). The antioxidant regenerating system consisting of CDH and cellobiose increased the ability of catechol to quench nitric oxide (NO), superoxide (O(2)(-)) and hydroxyl radicals (OH*) in solution and when incorporated into hydrogels. The CDH loaded into the hydrogels free of oxidized phenolic antioxidants and quinones reduced molecular to H(2)O(2) resulting in the complete inhibition of the growth of Stapylococcus aeureus, Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas putida, Escherichia coli and Cellulomonasmicrobium cellulans. This study therefore presents a new concept for synthesizing multifunctional bioresponsive chronic wound dressing polymers with in-built continuous antioxidant system able to continuously quench [reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNOS)], and antimicrobial properties able to prevent microbial colonization of wound.
TI  - Bacteriostatic effect of sequential hydrodynamic and ultrasound-induced stress.
AB  - AIMS: To elucidate the mechanism of action of a nonchemical microbial control technology employing coupled hydrodynamic and ultrasound-induced stress. METHODS & RESULTS: The effects of a laboratory model system using a commercial nonchemical device on Pseudomonas putida revealed growth and respiration were inhibited without a loss of viability from the treated population. Damage to cell membranes was evident using fluorescent microscopy and a reporter strain containing lux genes fused with a membrane damage stress-response promoter. Other reporter strains also indicated the possible involvement of DNA and protein repair systems. A consequence of treatment was a reduced ability to form biofilms. CONCLUSIONS: The nonchemical device caused a biostatic effect on treated cells induced by sublethal damage to several cellular systems, including cell membranes. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The study demonstrates that biostasis can be an effective mechanism for microbial control in some industrial systems and provides insight into understanding and applying this device and other nonchemical microbial control technologies to real-world problems of microbial contamination.
TI  - The biology of habitat dominance; can microbes behave as weeds?
AB  - Competition between microbial species is a product of, yet can lead to a reduction in, the microbial diversity of specific habitats. Microbial habitats can resemble ecological battlefields where microbial cells struggle to dominate and/or annihilate each other and we explore the hypothesis that (like plant weeds) some microbes are genetically hard-wired to behave in a vigorous and ecologically aggressive manner. These 'microbial weeds' are able to dominate the communities that develop in fertile but uncolonized--or at least partially vacant--habitats via traits enabling them to out-grow competitors; robust tolerances to habitat-relevant stress parameters and highly efficient energy-generation systems; avoidance of or resistance to viral infection, predation and grazers; potent antimicrobial systems; and exceptional abilities to sequester and store resources. In addition, those associated with nutritionally complex habitats are extraordinarily versatile in their utilization of diverse substrates. Weed species typically deploy multiple types of antimicrobial including toxins; volatile organic compounds that act as either hydrophobic or highly chaotropic stressors; biosurfactants; organic acids; and moderately chaotropic solutes that are produced in bulk quantities (e.g. acetone, ethanol). Whereas ability to dominate communities is habitat-specific we suggest that some microbial species are archetypal weeds including generalists such as: Pichia anomala, Acinetobacter spp. and Pseudomonas putida; specialists such as Dunaliella salina, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Lactobacillus spp. and other lactic acid bacteria; freshwater autotrophs Gonyostomum semen and Microcystis aeruginosa; obligate anaerobes such as Clostridium acetobutylicum; facultative pathogens such as Rhodotorula mucilaginosa, Pantoea ananatis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa; and other extremotolerant and extremophilic microbes such as Aspergillus spp., Salinibacter ruber and Haloquadratum walsbyi. Some microbes, such as Escherichia coli, Mycobacterium smegmatis and Pseudoxylaria spp., exhibit characteristics of both weed and non-weed species. We propose that the concept of nonweeds represents a 'dustbin' group that includes species such as Synodropsis spp., Polypaecilum pisce, Metschnikowia orientalis, Salmonella spp., and Caulobacter crescentus. We show that microbial weeds are conceptually distinct from plant weeds, microbial copiotrophs, r-strategists, and other ecophysiological groups of microorganism. Microbial weed species are unlikely to emerge from stationary-phase or other types of closed communities; it is open habitats that select for weed phenotypes. Specific characteristics that are common to diverse types of open habitat are identified, and implications of weed biology and open-habitat ecology are discussed in the context of further studies needed in the fields of environmental and applied microbiology.
TI  - Cloning of a novel nicotine oxidase gene from Pseudomonas sp. strain HZN6 whose product nonenantioselectively degrades nicotine to pseudooxynicotine.
AB  - Pseudomonas sp. strain HZN6 utilizes nicotine as its sole source of carbon, nitrogen, and energy. However, its catabolic mechanism has not been elucidated. In this study, self-formed adaptor PCR was performed to amplify the upstream sequence of the pseudooxynicotine amine oxidase gene. A 1,437-bp open reading frame (designated nox) was found to encode a nicotine oxidase (NOX) that shows 30% amino acid sequence identity with 6-hydroxy-l-nicotine oxidase from Arthrobacter nicotinovorans. The nox gene was cloned into a broad-host-range cloning vector and transferred into the non-nicotine-degrading bacteria Escherichia coli DH5alpha (DH-nox) and Pseudomonas putida KT2440 (KT-nox). The transconjugant KT-nox obtained nicotine degradation ability and yielded an equimolar amount of pseudooxynicotine, while DH-nox did not. Reverse transcription-PCR showed that the nox gene is expressed in both DH5alpha and KT2440, suggesting that additional factors required for nicotine degradation are present in a Pseudomonas strain(s), but not in E. coli. The mutant of strain HZN6 with nox disrupted lost the ability to degrade nicotine, but not pseudooxynicotine. These results suggested that the nox gene is responsible for the first step of nicotine degradation. The (RS)-nicotine degradation results showed that the two enantiomers were degraded at approximately the same rate, indicating that NOX does not show chiral selectivity. Site-directed mutagenesis revealed that both the conserved flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)-binding GXGXXG motif and His456 are essential for nicotine degradation activity.
TI  - The Entner-Doudoroff pathway empowers Pseudomonas putida KT2440 with a high tolerance to oxidative stress.
AB  - Glucose catabolism of Pseudomonas putida is carried out exclusively through the Entner-Doudoroff (ED) pathway due to the absence of 6-phosphofructokinase. In order to activate the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas (EMP) route we transferred the pfkA gene from Escherichia coli to a P. putida wild-type strain as well as to an eda mutant, i.e. lacking 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate aldolase. PfkA(E. coli) failed to redirect the carbon flow from the ED route towards the EMP pathway, suggesting that ED was essential for sugar catabolism. The presence of PfkA(E. coli) was detrimental for growth, which could be traced to the reduction of ATP and NAD(P)H pools along with alteration of the NAD(P)H/NADP(+) ratio. Pseudomonas putida cells carrying PfkA(E. coli) became highly sensitive to diamide and hydrogen peroxide, the response to which is very demanding of NADPH. The inhibitory effect of PfkA(E. coli) could in part be relieved by methionine, the synthesis of which relies much on NADPH. These results expose the role of the ED pathway for generating the redox currency (NADPH) that is required for counteracting oxidative stress. It is thus likely that environmental bacteria that favour the ED pathway over the EMP pathway do so in order to gear their aerobic metabolism to endure oxidative-related insults.
TI  - Engineering Escherichia coli for renewable production of the 5-carbon polyamide building-blocks 5-aminovalerate and glutarate.
AB  - Through metabolic pathway engineering, novel microbial biocatalysts can be engineered to convert renewable resources into useful chemicals, including monomer building-blocks for bioplastics production. Here we describe the systematic engineering of Escherichia coli to produce, as individual products, two 5-carbon polyamide building blocks, namely 5-aminovalerate (AMV) and glutarate. The modular pathways were derived using "parts" from the natural lysine degradation pathway of Pseudomonas putida KT2440. Endogenous over-production of the required precursor, lysine, was first achieved through metabolic deregulation of its biosynthesis pathway by introducing feedback resistant mutants of aspartate kinase III and dihydrodipicolinate synthase. Further disruption of native lysine decarboxylase activity (by deleting cadA and ldcC) limited cadaverine by-product formation, enabling lysine production to 2.25 g/L at a glucose yield of 138 mmol/mol (18% of theoretical). Co-expression of lysine monooxygenase and 5-aminovaleramide amidohydrolase (encoded by davBA) then resulted in the production of 0.86 g/L AMV in 48 h. Finally, the additional co-expression of glutaric semialdehyde dehydrogenase and 5-aminovalerate aminotransferase (encoded by davDT) led to the production of 0.82 g/L glutarate under the same conditions. At this output, yields on glucose were 71 and 68 mmol/mol for AMV and glutarate (9.5 and 9.1% of theoretical), respectively. These findings further expand the number and diversity of polyamide monomers that can be derived directly from renewable resources.
TI  - Microbiological investigation of Raphanus sativus L. grown hydroponically in nutrient solutions contaminated with spoilage and pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - The survival of eight undesired (spoilage/pathogenic) food related bacteria (Citrobacter freundii PSS60, Enterobacter spp. PSS11, Escherichia coli PSS2, Klebsiella oxytoca PSS82, Serratia grimesii PSS72, Pseudomonas putida PSS21, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia PSS52 and Listeria monocytogenes ATCC 19114(T)) was investigated in mineral nutrient solution (MNS) during the crop cycle of radishes (Raphanus sativus L.) cultivated in hydroponics in a greenhouse. MNSs were microbiologically analyzed weekly by plate count. The evolution of the pure cultures was also evaluated in sterile MNS in test tubes. The inoculated trials contained an initial total mesophilic count (TMC) ranging between 6.69 and 7.78Log CFU/mL, while non-sterile and sterile control trials showed levels of 4.39 and 0.97Log CFU/mL, respectively. In general, all inoculated trials showed similar levels of TMC in MNS during the experimentation, even though the levels of the inoculated bacteria decreased. The presence of the inoculums was ascertained by randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis applied on the isolates collected at 7-day intervals. At harvest, MNSs were also analyzed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). The last analysis, except P. putida PSS21 in the corresponding trial, did not detect the other bacteria, but confirmed that pseudomonads were present in un-inoculated MNSs. Despite the high counts detected (6.44 and 7.24CFU/g), only C. freundii PSS60, Enterobacter spp. PSS11 and K. oxytoca PSS82 were detected in radishes in a living form, suggesting their internalization.
TI  - Quantitative, non-disruptive monitoring of transcription in single cells with a broad-host range GFP-luxCDABE dual reporter system.
AB  - A dual promoter probe system based on a tandem bi-cistronic GFP-luxCDABE reporter cassette is described and implemented. This system is assembled in two synthetic, modular, broad-host range plasmids based on pBBR1 and RK2 origins of replication, allowing its utilization in an extensive number of gram-negative bacteria. We analyze the performance of this dual cassette in two hosts, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida, by examining the induction properties of the lacI(q)-Ptrc expression system in the first host and the Pb promoter of the benzoate degradation pathway in the second host. By quantifying the bioluminescence signal produced through the expression of the lux genes, we explore the dynamic range of induction for the two systems (Ptrc-based and Pb-based) in response to the two inducers. In addition, by quantifying the fluorescence signals produced by GFP expression, we were able to monitor the single-cell expression profile and to explore stochasticity of the same two promoters by flow cytometry. The results provided here demonstrate the power of the dual GFP-luxCDABE cassette as a new, single-step tool to assess promoter properties at both the population and single-cell levels in gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Metabolic engineering of Escherichia coli for the production of 5-aminovalerate and glutarate as C5 platform chemicals.
AB  - 5-Aminovalerate (5AVA) is the precursor of valerolactam, a potential building block for producing nylon 5, and is a C5 platform chemical for synthesizing 5-hydroxyvalerate, glutarate, and 1,5-pentanediol. Escherichia coli was metabolically engineered for the production of 5-aminovalerate (5AVA) and glutarate. When the recombinant E. coli WL3110 strain expressing the Pseudomonas putidadavAB genes encoding delta-aminovaleramidase and lysine 2-monooxygenase, respectively, were cultured in a medium containing 20g/L of glucose and 10g/L of L-lysine, 3.6g/L of 5AVA was produced by converting 7g/L of L-lysine. When the davAB genes were introduced into recombinant E. coli strainXQ56allowing enhanced L-lysine synthesis, 0.27 and 0.5g/L of 5AVA were produced directly from glucose by batch and fed-batch cultures, respectively. Further conversion of 5AVA into glutarate could be demonstrated by expression of the P. putida gabTD genes encoding 5AVA aminotransferase and glutarate semialdehyde dehydrogenase. When recombinant E. coli WL3110 strain expressing the davAB and gabTD genes was cultured in a medium containing 20g/L glucose, 10g/L L-lysine and 10g/L alpha-ketoglutarate, 1.7g/L of glutarate was produced.
TI  - Whole-cell-based CYP153A6-catalyzed (S)-limonene hydroxylation efficiency depends on host background and profits from monoterpene uptake via AlkL.
AB  - Living microbial cells are considered to be the catalyst of choice for selective  terpene functionalization. However, such processes often suffer from side product formation and poor substrate mass transfer into cells. For the hydroxylation of (S)-limonene to (S)-perillyl alcohol by Pseudomonas putida KT2440 (pGEc47DeltaB)(pCom8-PFR1500), containing the cytochrome P450 monooxygenase CYP153A6, the side products perillyl aldehyde and perillic acid constituted up to 26% of the total amount of oxidized terpenes. In this study, it is shown that the reaction rate is substrate-limited in the two-liquid phase system used and that host intrinsic dehydrogenases and not CYP153A6 are responsible for the formation of the undesired side products. In contrast to P. putida KT2440, E. coli W3110 was found to catalyze perillyl aldehyde reduction to the alcohol and no oxidation to the acid. Furthermore, E. coli W3110 harboring CYP153A6 showed high limonene hydroxylation activities (7.1 U g CDW-1). The outer membrane protein AlkL was found to enhance hydroxylation activities of E. coli twofold in aqueous single-phase and fivefold in two-liquid phase biotransformations. In the latter system, E. coli harboring CYP153A6 and AlkL produced up to 39.2 mmol (S)-perillyl alcohol L tot-1 within 26 h, whereas no perillic acid and minor amounts of perillyl aldehyde (8% of the total products) were formed. In conclusion, undesired perillyl alcohol oxidation was reduced by choosing E. coli's enzymatic background as a reaction environment and co-expression of the alkL gene in E. coli represents a promising strategy to enhance terpene bioconversion rates.
TI  - Evidence for lignin oxidation by the giant panda fecal microbiome.
AB  - The digestion of lignin and lignin-related phenolic compounds from bamboo by giant pandas has puzzled scientists because of the lack of lignin-degrading genes in the genome of the bamboo-feeding animals. We constructed a 16S rRNA gene library from the microorganisms derived from the giant panda feces to identify the possibility for the presence of potential lignin-degrading bacteria. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the phylotypes of the intestinal bacteria were affiliated with the phyla Proteobacteria (53%) and Firmicutes (47%). Two phylotypes were affiliated with the known lignin-degrading bacterium Pseudomonas putida and the mangrove forest bacteria. To test the hypothesis that microbes in the giant panda gut help degrade lignin, a metagenomic library of the intestinal bacteria was constructed and screened for clones that contained genes encoding laccase, a lignin-degrading related enzyme. A multicopper oxidase gene, designated as lac51, was identified from a metagenomic clone. Sequence analysis and copper content determination indicated that Lac51 is a laccase rather than a metallo-oxidase and may work outside its original host cell because it has a TAT-type signal peptide and a transmembrane segment at its N-terminus. Lac51 oxidizes a variety of lignin-related phenolic compounds, including syringaldazine, 2,6-dimethoxyphenol, ferulic acid, veratryl alcohol, guaiacol, and sinapinic acid at conditions that simulate the physiologic environment in giant panda intestines. Furthermore, in the presence of 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS), syringic acid, or ferulic acid as mediators, the oxidative ability of Lac51 on lignin was promoted. The absorbance of lignin at 445 nm decreased to 36% for ABTS, 51% for syringic acid, and 51% for ferulic acid after incubation for 10 h. Our findings demonstrate that the intestinal bacteria of giant pandas may facilitate the oxidation of lignin moieties, thereby clarifying the digestion of bamboo lignin by the animal.
TI  - Characterization of the transcriptional stimulatory properties of the Pseudomonas putida RapA protein.
AB  - RNA polymerase-associated factors can significantly affect its performance at specific promoters. Here we identified a Pseudomonas putida RNA polymerases-associated protein as a homolog of Escherichia coli RapA. We found that P. putida RapA stimulates the transcription from promoters dependent on a variety of sigma-factors (sigma(70), sigma(S), sigma(54), sigma(32), sigma(E)) in vitro. The level of stimulation varied from 2- to 10-fold, with the maximal effect observed with the sigma(E)-dependent PhtrA promoter. Stimulation by RapA was apparent in the multi-round reactions and was modulated by salt concentration in vitro. However, in contrast to findings with E. coli RapA, P. putida RapA-mediated stimulation of transcription was also evident using linear templates. These properties of P. putida RapA were apparent using either E. coli- or P. putida-derived RNA polymerases. Analysis of individual steps of transcription revealed that P. putida RapA enhances the stability of competitor-resistant open-complexes formed by RNA polymerase at promoters. In vivo, P. putida RapA can complement the inhibitory effect of high salt on growth of an E. coli RapA null strain. However, a P. putida RapA null mutant was not sensitive to high salt. The in vivo effects of lack of RapA were only detectable for the sigma(E)-PhtrA promoter where the RapA-deficiency resulted in lower activity. The presented characteristics of P. putida RapA indicate that its functions may extend beyond a role in facilitating RNA polymerase recycling to include a role in transcription initiation efficiency.
TI  - Effect of rhamnolipids on initial attachment of bacteria on glass and octadecyltrichlorosilane-modified glass.
AB  - Bacterial attachment on solid surfaces has various implications in environmental, industrial and medical applications. In this study, the effects of rhamnolipid biosurfactants on initial attachment of bacteria on hydrophilic glass and hydrophobic octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) modified glass were evaluated under continuous-flow conditions. The bacteria investigated were three Gram-negative species Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas putida, and Escherichia coli, and two Gram-positive species Staphylcoccus epidermidis and Bacillus subtilis. Rhamnolipids, at 10 and 200 mg/l, significantly reduced the attachment of all but S. epidermidis on both glass and OTS-modified glass. For S. epidermidis rhamnolipids reduced the attachment on OTS-modified glass but not on glass. Studies were further done to identify the mechanism(s) by which rhamnolipids reduced the cell attachment. The following potential properties of rhamnolipids were investigated: inhibition of microbial growth, change of cell surface hydrophobicity, easier detachment of cells already attached to substratum, and modification of substratum surface properties. Results showed that rhamnolipids were ineffective for the latter two effects. Rhamnolipids, up to 200mg/l, inhibited the growth of B. subtilis, S. epidermidis and P. aeruginosa PAO1 but not the growth of E. coli, P. putida and P. aeruginosa E0340. Also, rhamnolipids tended to increase the hydrophobicity of P. aeruginosa PAO1 and E. coli, decrease the hydrophobicity of P. putida and S. epidermidis, and have no clear effect on the hydrophobicity of B. subtillis. These trends however did not correlate with the observed trend of cell attachment reduction. The responsible mechanism(s) remained unknown.
TI  - Engineering an anaerobic metabolic regime in Pseudomonas putida KT2440 for the anoxic biodegradation of 1,3-dichloroprop-1-ene.
AB  - Pseudomonas putida KT2440, a microbial cell factory of reference for industrial whole-cell biocatalysis, is unable to support biochemical reactions that occur under anoxic conditions, limiting its utility for a large number of relevant biotransformations. Unlike (facultative) anaerobes, P. putida resorts to NADH oxidation via an oxic respiratory chain and completely lacks a true fermentation metabolism. Therefore, it cannot achieve the correct balances of energy and redox couples (i.e., ATP/ADP and NADH/NAD(+)) that are required to sustain an O(2)-free lifestyle. To overcome this state of affairs, the acetate kinase (ackA) gene of the facultative anaerobe Escherichia coli and the pyruvate decarboxylase (pdc) and alcohol dehydrogenase II (adhB) genes of the aerotolerant Zymomonas mobilis were knocked-in to a wild-type P. putida strain. Biochemical and genetic assays showed that conditional expression of the entire enzyme set allowed the engineered bacteria to adopt an anoxic regime that maintained considerable metabolic activity. The resulting strain was exploited as a host for the heterologous expression of a 1,3-dichloroprop-1-ene degradation pathway recruited from Pseudomonas pavonaceae 170, enabling the recombinants to degrade this recalcitrant chlorinated compound anoxically. These results underscore the value of P. putida as a versatile agent for biotransformations able to function at progressively lower redox statuses.
TI  - Novel acid resistance genes from the metagenome of the Tinto River, an extremely  acidic environment.
AB  - Microorganisms that thrive in acidic environments are endowed with specialized molecular mechanisms to survive under this extremely harsh condition. In this work, we performed functional screening of six metagenomic libraries from planktonic and rhizosphere microbial communities of the Tinto River, an extremely acidic environment, to identify genes involved in acid resistance. This approach has revealed 15 different genes conferring acid resistance to Escherichia coli, most of which encoding putative proteins of unknown function or previously described proteins not known to be related to acid resistance. Moreover, we were able to assign function to one unknown and three hypothetical proteins. Among the recovered genes were the ClpXP protease, the transcriptional repressor LexA and nucleic acid-binding proteins such as an RNA-binding protein, HU and Dps. Furthermore, nine of the retrieved genes were cloned and expressed in Pseudomonas putida and Bacillus subtilis and, remarkably, most of them were able to expand the capability of these bacteria to survive under severe acid stress. From this set of genes, four presented a broad-host range as they enhance the acid resistance of the three different organisms tested. These results expand our knowledge about the different strategies used by microorganisms to survive under extremely acid conditions.
TI  - Production of natural fragrance aromatic acids by coexpression of trans-anethole  oxygenase and p-anisaldehyde dehydrogenase genes of Pseudomonas putida JYR-1 in Escherichia coli.
AB  - A gene encoding p-anisaldehyde dehydrogenase (PAADH), which catalyzes the oxidation of p-anisaldehyde to p-anisic acid, was identified to be clustered with the trans-anethole oxygenase (tao) gene in Pseudomonas putida JYR-1. Heterologously expressed PAADH in Escherichia coli catalyzed the oxidation of vanillin, veratraldehyde, and piperonal to the corresponding aromatic acids vanillic acid, veratric acid, and piperonylic acid, respectively. Coexpression of trans-anethole oxygenase (TAO) and PAADH in E. coli also resulted in the successful transformation of trans-anethole, isoeugenol, O-methyl isoeugenol, and isosafrole to p-anisic acid, vanillic acid, veratric acid, and piperonylic acid, respectively, which are compounds found in plants as secondary metabolites. Because of the relaxed substrate specificity and high transformation rates by coexpressed TAO and PAADH in E. coli , the engineered strain has potential to be applied in the fragrance industry.
TI  - Coupling a detergent lysis/cleanup methodology with intact protein fractionation  for enhanced proteome characterization.
AB  - The expanding use of surfactants for proteome sample preparations has prompted the need to systematically optimize the application and removal of these MS-deleterious agents prior to proteome measurements. Here we compare four detergent cleanup methods (trichloroacetic acid (TCA) precipitation, chloroform/methanol/water (CMW) extraction, a commercial detergent removal spin column method (DRS) and filter-aided sample preparation (FASP)) to provide efficiency benchmarks with respect to protein, peptide, and spectral identifications in each case. Our results show that for protein-limited samples, FASP outperforms the other three cleanup methods, while at high protein amounts, all the methods are comparable. This information was used to investigate and contrast molecular weight-based fractionated with unfractionated lysates from three increasingly complex samples ( Escherichia coli K-12, a five microbial isolate mixture, and a natural microbial community groundwater sample), all of which were prepared with an SDS-FASP approach. The additional fractionation step enhanced the number of protein identifications by 8% to 25% over the unfractionated approach across the three samples.
TI  - The ability of soil bacteria to receive the conjugative IncP1 plasmid, pKJK10, is different in a mixed community compared to single strains.
AB  - Horizontal gene transfer by conjugation is common among bacterial populations in  soil. It is well known that the host range of plasmids depends on several factors, including the identity of the plasmid host cell. In the present study, however, we demonstrate that the composition of the recipient community is also determining for the dissemination of a conjugative plasmid. We isolated 15 different bacterial strains from soil and assessed the conjugation frequencies of the IncP1 plasmid, pKJK10, by flow cytometry, from two different donors, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida, to either 15 different bacterial strains or to the mixed community composed of all the 15 strains. We detected transfer of pKJK10 from P. putida to Stenotrophomonas rhizophila in a diparental mating, but no transfer was observed to the mixed community. In contrast, for E. coli, transfer was observed only to the mixed community, where Ochrobactrum rhizosphaerae was identified as the dominating plasmid recipient. Our results indicate that the presence of a bacterial community impacts the plasmid permissiveness by affecting the ability of strains to receive the conjugative plasmid.
TI  - Structural basis for outer membrane sugar uptake in pseudomonads.
AB  - Substrate-specific outer membrane channels of gram-negative bacteria mediate uptake of many small molecules, including carbohydrates. The mechanism of sugar uptake by enterobacterial channels, such as Escherichia coli LamB (maltoporin), has been characterized in great detail. In pseudomonads and related organisms, sugar uptake is not mediated by LamB but by OprB channels. Beyond the notion that OprB channels seem to prefer monosaccharides as substrates, very little is known about OprB-mediated sugar uptake. Here I report the X-ray crystal structure of an OprB channel from Pseudomonas putida F1. The structure shows that OprB forms a monomeric, 16-stranded beta-barrel with a constriction formed by extracellular loops L2 and L3. The side chains of two highly conserved arginine residues (Arg(83) and Arg(110)) and a conserved glutamate (Glu(106)) line the channel constriction and interact with a bound glucose molecule. Liposome swelling uptake assays show a strong preference for monosaccharide transport over disaccharides. Moreover, substrates with a net negative charge are disfavored by the channel, probably due to the negatively charged character of the constriction. The architecture of the eyelet and the absence of a greasy slide provide an explanation for the observed specificity of OprB for monosaccharides rather than the oligosaccharides preferred by LamB and related enterobacterial channels.
TI  - High cell density cultivation of Pseudomonas putida strain HKT554 and its application for optically active sulfoxide production.
AB  - Culture conditions with Pseudomonas putida strain HKT554, expressing naphthalene  dioxygenase, known as the biocatalyst showing wide substrate specificity, were optimized for high cell density cultivation (HCDC). Culture in a medium TK-B modified from that for HCDC of Escherichia coli with glucose fed-batch and dissolved oxygen stat resulted in a high cell density growth of 114 g dry cell/l at 40 h of cultivation. This system was further applied for S-(+)-methyl phenyl sulfoxide (MPSO) production from methyl phenyl sulfide. Addition of nonpolar organic solvent, such as n-hexadecane, greatly enhanced the MPSO production due to the prevention of substrate evaporation, resulting in a MPSO production up to 39 mM in 30 h with a conversion rate of 95.7 mol%.
TI  - Characterization of ergothionase from Burkholderia sp. HME13 and its application  to enzymatic quantification of ergothioneine.
AB  - We identified ergothionase, which catalyzes conversion of ergothioneine to thiolurocanic acid and trimethylamine, in a newly isolated ergothioneine-utilizing strain, Burkholderia sp. HME13. The enzyme was purified and its N-terminal amino acid sequence was determined. Based on the amino acid sequence, the gene encoding the enzyme was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The recombinant enzyme was purified to homogeneity and characterized. The enzyme consisted of four identical 55-kDa subunits. The enzyme showed maximum activity at pH 8.0 and 65 degrees C and was stable between pH 7.0 and pH 10.0 and up to 60 degrees C. The enzyme acted on ergothioneine (K m: 19 muM, V max: 270 mumol/min/mg), but not D-histidine, L-histidine, D-tyrosine, L-tyrosine, D-phenylalanine, or L-phenylalanine. The enzyme was activated by BaCl2 and strongly inhibited by CuSO4, ZnSO4, and HgCl2. The amino acid sequence of ergothionase showed 23 % similarity to histidine ammonia-lyase (HAL) from Pseudomonas putida and 17 % similarity to phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) from parsley. However, the tripeptide sequence, Ala-Ser-Gly, which is important for catalysis in both HAL and PAL, was not conserved in ergothionase. The application of ergothionase for the quantification of ergothioneine contained in practical food and blood samples was investigated by performing a recovery test. Satisfactory recovery data (98.7-104 %) were obtained when ergothioneine was added to extract of tamogitake and hemolysis blood.
TI  - Complete nucleotide sequence of plasmid pND6-2 from Pseudomonas putida ND6 and characterization of conjugative genes.
AB  - Pseudomonas putida ND6 was shown to be capable of growth using naphthalene as sole carbon and energy sources. One plasmid from this strain, pND6-1, which was associated with the metabolism of naphthalene, was characterized; and the complete nucleotide sequence (101,858bp) and annotation of the plasmid were reported previously. In this paper, another plasmid (117,003bp) from P. putida ND6, pND6-2, was sequenced and 136 putative coding sequences (CDSs) were annotated. Among them, 9 CDSs were predicted to be involved in replication and partition of the plasmid, 32 CDSs encoded proteins associated with plasmid conjugative transfer, 2 CDSs encoded transcriptional regulators, 9 CDSs were necessary for DNA-associated function (including metabolism, recombination and repair), and 5 CDSs encoded proteins associated with other functions. The filter matting experiment indicated that pND6-2 is a helper plasmid, which could assist the naphthalene catabolic plasmid pND6-1 without any conjugative genes being transferred from P. putida ND6 to Escherichia coli AD256.
TI  - Ecotoxicological evaluation of waste water from nitrocellulose production.
AB  - The present study evaluated the toxic potential and physicochemical characteristics of waste water generated in nitrocellulose production, including effluents from delignification, bleaching, nitration and mixture (composed of these three effluents), from a plant in the Paraiba Valley, Sao Paulo, Brazil. The test organisms used for toxicity assays were Daphnia similis, Danio rerio, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas putida and Pseudokircheneriella subcaptata. The results showed that the effluents analyzed present acute and chronic toxicity for the organisms tested. Nitration effluent was the least toxic, while delignification and bleaching effluents were the most toxic. The naturally occurring pollutants in wood fiber and cotton, like lignin, probably contributed to effluents toxicity, in addition to higher concentrations of total dissolved solids, which are in non-compliance with Brazilian legislation, conductivity, chemical oxygen demand and color. The discharge of nitrocellulose effluent into an aquatic environment should only occur after appropriate treatment, due to their toxic characteristics.
TI  - Strong stimulation of recombinant protein production in Escherichia coli by combining stimulatory control elements in an expression cassette.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The XylS/Pm expression system has been used to produce recombinant proteins at industrial levels in Escherichia coli. Activation of transcription from the Pm promoter takes place in the presence of benzoic acid or derivatives of it. Previous mutagenesis studies resulted in identification of several variants of the expression control elements xylS (X), Pm (P) and the 5'-untranslated region (U) that individually gave rise to strongly stimulated expression. The goal of this study was to test if combination of such stimulatory mutations in the same expression vectors would lead to further increase of expression levels. RESULTS: We combined X, P and U variants that were originally identified due to their ability to strongly stimulate expression of the reporter gene bla (resistance to penicillin). Combination of optimized elements stimulated bla expression up to 75-fold (X, P and U combined) relative to the wild-type system, while accumulated transcript levels increased about 50-fold. This is much more than for the elements individually. We also tested combination of the variant elements on two other and unrelated genes, celB (encoding phosphoglucomutase) and the human growth factor gene gm-csf. Protein production from these genes is much more efficient than from bla in the wild-type system, but expression was still significantly stimulated by the combination of X, P and U variants, although not to the same extent as for bla. We also integrated a single copy of the expression cassette with each gene into the E. coli chromosome and found that the expression level from this single copy was higher for bla than for the wild-type plasmid system, while it was lower for celB and gm-csf. CONCLUSION: Our results show that combination of stimulatory expression control elements can be used to further increase production of different proteins in E. coli. For one reporter gene (bla) this allowed for more protein production from a single gene copy integrated on the chromosome, compared to the wild-type plasmid system. The approach described here should in principle be applicable for improvement of any expression cassette.
TI  - Deepening TOL and TOU catabolic pathways of Pseudomonas sp. OX1: cloning, sequencing and characterization of the lower pathways.
AB  - Pseudomonas sp. OX1 is able to metabolize toluene and o-xylene through the TOU catabolic pathway, whereas its mutant M1 strain was found to be able to use m- and p-xylene as carbon and energy source, using the TOL catabolic pathway. Here we report the complete nucleotide sequence of the phe lower operon of the TOU catabolic pathway, and the sequence of the last four genes of the xyl-like lower operon of the TOL catabolic pathway. DNA sequence analysis shows the gene order within the operons to be pheCDEFGHI (phe operon) and xyl-likeQKIH (xyl-like operon), identical to the order found for the isofunctional genes of meta operons in the toluene/xylene pathway of TOL plasmid pWW0 from Pseudomonas putida mt-2 and the phenol/methylphenol pathway of pVIl50 from Pseudomonas sp. CF600. The nucleotide and the deduced amino acid sequences are homologous to the equivalent gene and enzyme sequences from other Pseudomonas meta pathways. Recombinant 2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde dehydrogenase (HMSD) and 2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde hydrolase (HMSH), coded by pheCD genes, respectively, and ADA and HOA enzymes from both phe and xyl operons were expressed in E. coli and steady-state kinetic analysis was carried out. The analysis of the kinetic parameters of HMSD and HMSH showed that the enzymes from Pseudomonas sp. OX1 are more specialized to channel metabolites into the two branches of the lower pathway than homologous enzymes from other pseudomonads. The kinetics parameters of recombinant ADA from phe and xyl-like operon were found to be similar to those of homologous enzymes from other Pseudomonas strains. In addition, the enzyme from xyl-like operon showed a substrate affinity three times higher than the enzyme from phe operon.
TI  - Production of medium-chain-length polyhydroxyalkanoates by sequential feeding of  xylose and octanoic acid in engineered Pseudomonas putida KT2440.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pseudomonas putida KT2440 is able to synthesize large amounts of medium-chain-length polyhydroxyalkanoates (mcl-PHAs). To reduce the substrate cost, which represents nearly 50% of the total PHA production cost, xylose, a hemicellulose derivate, was tested as the growth carbon source in an engineered P. putida KT2440 strain. RESULTS: The genes encoding xylose isomerase (XylA) and xylulokinase (XylB) from Escherichia coli W3110 were introduced into P. putida KT2440. The recombinant KT2440 exhibited a XylA activity of 1.47 U and a XylB activity of 0.97 U when grown on a defined medium supplemented with xylose. The cells reached a maximum specific growth rate of 0.24 h(-1) and a final cell dry weight (CDW) of 2.5 g L(-1) with a maximal yield of 0.5 g CDW g(-1) xylose. Since no mcl-PHA was accumulated from xylose, mcl-PHA production can be controlled by the addition of fatty acids leading to tailor-made PHA compositions. Sequential feeding strategy was applied using xylose as the growth substrate and octanoic acid as the precursor for mcl-PHA production. In this way, up to 20% w w(-1) of mcl-PHA was obtained. A yield of 0.37 g mcl-PHA per g octanoic acid was achieved under the employed conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Sequential feeding of relatively cheap carbohydrates and expensive fatty acids is a practical way to achieve more cost-effective mcl-PHA production. This study is the first reported attempt to produce mcl-PHA by using xylose as the growth substrate. Further process optimizations to achieve higher cell density and higher productivity of mcl-PHA should be investigated. These scientific exercises will undoubtedly contribute to the economic feasibility of mcl-PHA production from renewable feedstock.
TI  - Construction and application of an Escherichia coli bioreporter for aniline and chloroaniline detection.
AB  - Aniline and chlorinated anilines (CAs) are classified as priority pollutants; therefore, an effective method for detection and monitoring is required. In this study, a green-fluorescence protein-based bioreporter for the detection of aniline and CAs was constructed in Escherichia coli DH5alpha, characterized and tested with soil and wastewater. The sensing capability relied on the regulatory control between a two-component regulatory protein, TodS/TodT, and the P( todX ) promoter of Pseudomonas putida T-57 (PpT57), since the gene expression of todS, todT, and todC2 are positively induced with 4-chloroaniline. The bioreporter system (DH5alpha/pPXGFP-pTODST) is markedly unique with the two co-existing plasmids. The inducibility of the fluorescence response was culture-medium- and time-dependent. Cells grown in M9G medium exhibited a low background fluorescence level and were readily induced by 4CA after 3-h exposure, reaching the maximum induction level at 9 h. When tested with benzene, toluene, ethyl-benzene and xylene, aniline and CAs, the response data were best fit by a sigmoidal dose-response relationship, from which the K((1/2)) value was determined for the positive effectors. 3CA and 4CA were relatively powerful inducers, while some poly-chlorinated anilines could also induce green fluorescence protein expression. The results indicated a broader recognition range of PpT57'sTodST than previously reported for P. putida. The test results with environmental samples were reliable, indicating the potential application of this bioreporter in the ecotoxicology assessment and bioremediation of areas contaminated with aniline- and/or CAs.
TI  - The oxidation of alkylaryl sulfides and benzo[b]thiophenes by Escherichia coli cells expressing wild-type and engineered styrene monooxygenase from Pseudomonas putida CA-3.
AB  - Nine different sulfur-containing compounds were biotransformed to the corresponding sulfoxides by Escherichia coli Bl21(DE3) cells expressing styrene monooxygenase (SMO) from Pseudomonas putida CA-3. Thioanisole was consumed at 83.3 mumoles min(-1) g cell dry weight(-1) resulting mainly in the formation of R-thioanisole sulfoxide with an enantiomeric excess (ee) value of 45 %. The rate of 2-methyl-, 2-chloro- and 2-bromo-thioanisole consumption was 2-fold lower than that of thioanisole. Surprisingly, the 2-methylthioanisole sulfoxide product had the opposite (S) configuration to that of the other 2-substituted thioanisole derivatives and had a higher ee value (84 %). The rate of oxidation of 4-substituted thioanisoles was higher than the corresponding 2-substituted substrates but the ee values of the products were consistently lower (10-23 %). The rate of benzo[b]thiophene and 2-methylbenzo[b]thiophene sulfoxidation was approximately 10-fold lower than that of thioanisole. The ee value of the benzo[b]thiophene sulfoxide could not be determined as the product racemized rapidly. E. coli cells expressing an engineered SMO (SMOeng R3-11) oxidised 2-substituted thioanisoles between 1.8- and 2.8-fold faster compared to cells expressing the wild-type enzyme. SMOeng R3-11 oxidised benzo[b]thiophene and 2-methylbenzo[b]thiophene 10.1 and 5.6 times faster that the wild-type enzyme. The stereospecificity of the reaction catalysed by SMOeng was unchanged from that of the wild type. Using the X-ray crystal structure of the P. putida S12 SMO, it was evident that the entrance of substrates into the SMO active site is limited by the binding pocket bottleneck formed by the side chains of Val-211 and Asn-46 carboxyamide group.
TI  - Microbial D-xylonate production.
AB  - D-Xylonic acid is a versatile platform chemical with reported applications as complexing agent or chelator, in dispersal of concrete, and as a precursor for compounds such as co-polyamides, polyesters, hydrogels and 1,2,4-butanetriol. With increasing glucose prices, D-xylonic acid may provide a cheap, non-food derived alternative for gluconic acid, which is widely used (about 80 kton/year) in pharmaceuticals, food products, solvents, adhesives, dyes, paints and polishes. Large-scale production has not been developed, reflecting the current limited market for D-xylonate. D-Xylonic acid occurs naturally, being formed in the first step of oxidative metabolism of D-xylose by some archaea and bacteria via the action of D-xylose or D-glucose dehydrogenases. High extracellular concentrations of D-xylonate have been reported for various bacteria, in particular Gluconobacter oxydans and Pseudomonas putida. High yields of D-xylonate from D-xylose make G. oxydans an attractive choice for biotechnical production. G. oxydans is able to produce D-xylonate directly from plant biomass hydrolysates, but rates and yields are reduced because of sensitivity to hydrolysate inhibitors. Recently, D-xylonate has been produced by the genetically modified bacterium Escherichia coli and yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Kluyveromyces lactis. Expression of NAD(+)-dependent D-xylose dehydrogenase of Caulobacter crescentus in either E. coli or in a robust, hydrolysate-tolerant, industrial Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain has resulted in D-xylonate titres, which are comparable to those seen with G. oxydans, at a volumetric rate approximately 30% of that observed with G. oxydans. With further development, genetically modified microbes may soon provide an alternative for production of D-xylonate at industrial scale.
TI  - Evaluation of the sensitivity of freshwater organisms used in toxicity tests of wastewater from explosives company.
AB  - Explosives industries are a source of toxic discharge. The aim of this study was  to compare organisms sensitivity (Daphnia similis, Danio rerio, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida) in detecting acute toxicity in wastewater from two explosives, 2,4,6-TNT (TNT) and nitrocellulose. The samples were collected from an explosives company in the Paraiba Valley, Sao Paulo, Brazil. The effluents from TNT and nitrocellulose production were very toxic for tested organisms. Statistical tests indicated that D. similis and D. rerio were the most sensitive organisms for toxicity detection in effluents from 2,4,6-TNT and nitrocellulose production. The P. putida bacteria was the organism considered the least sensitive in indicating toxicity in effluents from nitrocellulose.
TI  - Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) revealing chemical variation during biofilm formation: from initial attachment to mature biofilm.
AB  - Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) has recently been proved to be a promising technique for characterizing the chemical composition of the biofilm matrix. In the present study, to fully understand the chemical variations during biofilm formation, SERS based on silver colloidal nanoparticles was applied to evaluate the chemical components in the matrix of biofilm at different growth phases, including initial attached bacteria, colonies, and mature biofilm. Meanwhile, atomic force microscopy was also applied to study the changes of biofilm morphology. Three model bacteria, including Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas putida, and Bacillus subtilis, were used to cultivate biofilms. The results showed that the content of carbohydrates, proteins, and nucleic acids in the biofilm matrix increased significantly along with the biofilm growth of the three bacteria judging from the intensities and appearance probabilities of related marker peaks in the SERS spectra. The content of lipids, however, only increased in the Gram-negative biofilms (E. coli and P. putida) rather than the Gram-positive biofilm (B. subtilis). Our findings strongly suggest the SERS has significant potential for studying chemical variations during biofilm formation.
TI  - Effects of low-density static magnetic fields on the growth and activities of wastewater bacteria Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - The aim of this study was to explore the influence of a moderate static magnetic  field (SMF) of different densities on Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida that are commonly found in wastewater treatment plants. In line with literature reports that SMF increases the efficiency of wastewater treatment the findings of this study indicated that SMF negatively influenced the growth but positively influenced the enzymatic activities and ATP levels of the two model bacteria. The inhibitory effect of SMF on growth of E. coli and P. putida was most pronounced at their optimal growth temperature (37 degrees C and 28 degrees C respectively) and was reversible shortly after the SMF had been terminated. Finally, the results suggested that the induced energy metabolism reflected in higher dehydrogenase activities and ATP levels may be more important for survival, and adaptation to SMF induced stress than the increase in the expression of the rpoS gene.
TI  - Class 1 integron gene cassettes in multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria in  southern China.
AB  - Non-duplicate multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria (n=1447) isolated from January 2008 to December 2009 were investigated for the presence of integrons as well as characterisation of gene cassettes. Among 825 strains carrying the class 1 integrase gene intI1, 461 gene cassette-positive isolates were found. Thirty-eight distinct gene cassette arrays were identified by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and DNA sequencing analyses. In addition, several novel gene cassette arrays detected in this study were reported for the first time in some species: one in Escherichia coli, six in Klebsiella pneumoniae, six in Enterobacter cloacae, three in Enterobacter aerogenes, one in Proteus mirabilis, one in Acinetobacter spp., one in Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and one in Pseudomonas putida. Among them, three cassettes, including HAD-like, DeltaMFS-1 and qnrVC-like genes, were originally detected in integrons.
TI  - Pseudomonas putida PydR, a RutR-like transcriptional regulator, represses the dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase gene in the pyrimidine reductive catabolic pathway.
AB  - The pyrimidine reductive catabolic pathway is important for the utilization of uracil and thymine as sources of nitrogen and carbon. The pathway is controlled by three enzymes: dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD), dihydropyrimidinase and beta-alanine synthase. The putative DPD genes, pydX and pydA, are tandemly arranged in the Pseudomonas putida genome. Intriguingly, a putative transcriptional regulator, PydR, homologous to Escherichia coli RutR, a repressor of the Rut-dependent pyrimidine degradation pathway, is located downstream of pydX and pydA. In this study, we show that a pydA strain of P. putida fails to grow on a minimal media containing uracil or thymine as a sole nitrogen source, demonstrating the physiological importance of DPD in the reductive pathway. The expression of pydA and DPD activity in the absence of uracil were significantly higher in a pydR strain than in the wild-type strain, indicating that PydR acts as a repressor of the pyrimidine reductive pathway in P. putida. Phylogenetic analysis of RutR and PydR suggests that these homologous repressors may have evolved from a common ancestral protein that regulates pyrimidine degradation.
TI  - A chemoreceptor from Pseudomonas putida forms active signalling complexes in Escherichia coli.
AB  - Chemoreceptors sense environmental stimuli and transmit the information to the flagellar motors via a histidine kinase that controls the phosphorylation level of the effector protein CheY. The cytoplasmic domain of chemoreceptors consists of a long alpha-helical hairpin that forms, in the dimer, a coiled-coil four-helix bundle. Even though the sequence and general structure of the cytoplasmic domain are strongly conserved within Eubacteria and Archaea, the total length of the alpha-helical hairpin is variable and defines seven classes of chemoreceptors. In this work we assessed the functional properties of a Pseudomonas receptor when assembled in signalling complexes with Escherichia coli proteins. Our results show that the foreign receptor does not confer fully chemotactic abilities upon E. coli cells, but is able to form active ternary complexes that respond to the specific stimuli by modulating the activity of the associated kinase. The observed responses are subject to adaptation, depending on the presence of the methylation enzymes CheR and/or CheB. The ability of foreign receptors to signal through signalling complexes with non-cognate proteins would allow the use of the well-studied E. coli system to reveal the detection specificity of uncharacterized chemoreceptors from other micro-organisms.
TI  - Ecotoxicity and biodegradability of antielectrostatic dicephalic cationic surfactants.
AB  - Four series of dicephalic cationic surfactants, considered as new antielectrostatic agents have been investigated in order to establish their toxicity and biodegradability. Among them N,N-bis[3,3'-(dimethylamine)propyl]alkylamides, N,N-bis[3,3'-(dimethylamine)propyl]alkylamide dihydrochlorides, N,N-bis[3,3'-(trimethylammonio)propyl]alkylamide dibromides and N,N-bis[3,3'-(trimethylammonio)propyl]alkylamide dimethylsulphates with different hydrophobic chain length (n-C(9)H(19) to n-C(15)H(31)) and type of counterion (chloride, bromide and methylsulfate) have been studied. The inhibitory effect against microorganisms has been examined using model gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, and yeasts. None of the tested surfactants have shown antimicrobial activity against gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas putida) and yeasts (Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Rhodotorula glutinis) at a concentration below 1000 mug mL(-1), however some of them were moderately active against gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis). The Microtox(R) test was successfully applied to measure EC(50) values of the studied dicephalic cationic surfactants. Their toxicity to Vibrio fischeri depended upon the alkanoyl chain length with the EC(50) values in a range of 2.6-980 mg L(-1). N,N-bis[3,3'-(dimethylamine)propyl]alkylamide dihydrochlorides 2a-b and N,N-bis[3,3'-(trimethylammonio)propyl]alkylamide dibromides 3a-b comprising n-decanoyl and n-dodecanoyl hydrophobic tails appeared to be the least toxic. Furthermore, the biodegradability under aerobic conditions of 2a-b, 3a-b was evaluated using OECD Method 301F. According to the obtained results 2a, 3a-3b can be considered as almost readily biodegradable and they are not expected to be persistent in the environment. Additionally, partial biodegradation was observed for 2b, indicating its possible biodegradation in wastewater treatment systems.
TI  - MhbT is a specific transporter for 3-hydroxybenzoate uptake by Gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Klebsiella pneumoniae M5a1 is capable of utilizing 3-hydroxybenzoate via gentisate, and the 6.3-kb gene cluster mhbRTDHIM conferred the ability to grow on 3-hydroxybenzoate to Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida PaW340. Four of the six genes (mhbDHIM) encode enzymes converting 3-hydroxybenzoate to pyruvate and fumarate via gentisate. MhbR is a gene activator, and MhbT is a hypothetical protein belonging to the transporter of the aromatic acid/H(+) symporter family. Since a transporter for 3-hydrxybenzoate uptake has not been characterized to date, we investigated whether MhbT is responsible for the uptake of 3-hydroxybenzoate, its metabolic intermediate gentisate, or both. The MhbT-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion protein was located on the cytoplasmic membrane. P. putida PaW340 containing mhbRDeltaTDHIM could not grow on 3-hydroxybenzoate; however, supplying mhbT in trans allowed the bacterium to grow on the substrate. K. pneumoniae M5a1 and P. putida PaW340 containing recombinant MhbT transported (14)C-labeled 3-hydroxybenzoate but not (14)C-labeled gentisate and benzoate into the cells. Site-directed mutagenesis of two conserved amino acid residues (Asp-82 and Asp-314) and a less-conserved residue (Val-311) among the members of the symporter family in the hydrophilic cytoplasmic loops resulted in the loss of 3-hydroxybenzoate uptake by P. putida PaW340 carrying the mutant proteins. Hence, we demonstrated that MhbT is a specific 3-hydroxybenzoate transporter.
TI  - Biotransformation of flavone by CYP105P2 from Streptomyces peucetius.
AB  - Biocatalytic transfer of oxygen in isolated cytochrome P450 or whole microbial cells is an elegant and efficient way to achieve selective hydroxylation. Cytochrome P450 CYP105P2 was isolated from Streptomyces peucetius that showed a high degree of amino acid identity with hydroxylases. Previously performed homology modeling, and subsequent docking of the model with flavone, displayed a reasonable docked structure. Therefore, in this study, in a pursuit to hydroxylate the flavone ring, CYP105P2 was co-expressed in a two-vector system with putidaredoxin reductase (camA) and putidaredoxin (camB) from Pseudomonas putida for efficient electron transport. HPLC analysis of the isolated product, together with LCMS analysis, showed a monohydroxylated flavone, which was further established by subsequent ESI/MS-MS. A successful 10.35% yield was achieved with the whole-cell bioconversion reaction in Escherichia coli. We verified that CYP105P2 is a potential bacterial hydroxylase.
TI  - Identification and biochemical evidence of a medium-chain-length polyhydroxyalkanoate depolymerase in the Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus predatory hydrolytic arsenal.
AB  - The obligate predator Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus HD100 shows a large set of proteases and other hydrolases as part of its hydrolytic arsenal needed for its predatory life cycle. We present genetic and biochemical evidence that open reading frame (ORF) Bd3709 of B. bacteriovorus HD100 encodes a novel medium-chain-length polyhydroxyalkanoate (mcl-PHA) depolymerase (PhaZ(Bd)). The primary structure of PhaZ(Bd) suggests that this enzyme belongs to the alpha/beta-hydrolase fold family and has a typical serine hydrolase catalytic triad (serine-histidine-aspartic acid) in agreement with other PHA depolymerases and lipases. PhaZ(Bd) has been extracellularly produced using different hypersecretor Tol-pal mutants of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida as recombinant hosts. The recombinant PhaZ(Bd) has been characterized, and its biochemical properties have been compared to those of other PHA depolymerases. The enzyme behaves as a serine hydrolase that is inhibited by phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. It is also affected by the reducing agent dithiothreitol and nonionic detergents like Tween 80. PhaZ(Bd) is an endoexohydrolase that cleaves both large and small PHA molecules, producing mainly dimers but also monomers and trimers. The enzyme specifically degrades mcl-PHA and is inactive toward short-chain-length polyhydroxyalkanoates (scl-PHA) like polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB). These studies shed light on the potentiality of these predators as sources of new biocatalysts, such as an mcl-PHA depolymerase, for the production of enantiopure hydroxyalkanoic acids and oligomers as building blocks for the synthesis of biobased polymers.
TI  - Genetic bioaugmentation as an effective method for in situ bioremediation: functionality of catabolic plasmids following conjugal transfers.
AB  - Genetic bioaugmentation is an in situ bioremediation method that stimulates horizontal transfer of catabolic plasmids between exogenous donor cells and indigenous bacteria to increase the biodegradation potential of contaminants. A critical outcome of genetic bioaugmentation is the expression of an active catabolic phenotype upon plasmid conjugation. Using a pWW0-derivative TOL plasmid, we showed that certain genetic characteristics of the recipient bacteria, including genomic guanine-cytosine (G + C) content and phylogeny, may limit the expression of the transferred catabolic pathway. However, such genetic limitations observed in transconjugants could be overcome by the presence of an additional carbon source. Glucose and Luria-Bertani broth were shown to enhance the toluene degradation rates of transconjugants; these enhancement effects were dependent on transconjugant genomic G + C contents. Based on these observations, thorough genetic characterization of the indigenous microbial community in the contaminated environment of interest may provide a predictive tool for assessing the success of genetic bioaugmentation.
TI  - Outer membrane protein AlkL boosts biocatalytic oxyfunctionalization of hydrophobic substrates in Escherichia coli.
AB  - The outer membrane of microbial cells forms an effective barrier for hydrophobic  compounds, potentially causing an uptake limitation for hydrophobic substrates. Low bioconversion activities (1.9 U g(cdw)(-1)) have been observed for the omega-oxyfunctionalization of dodecanoic acid methyl ester by recombinant Escherichia coli containing the alkane monooxygenase AlkBGT of Pseudomonas putida GPo1. Using fatty acid methyl ester oxygenation as the model reaction, this study investigated strategies to improve bacterial uptake of hydrophobic substrates. Admixture of surfactants and cosolvents to improve substrate solubilization did not result in increased oxygenation rates. Addition of EDTA increased the initial dodecanoic acid methyl ester oxygenation activity 2.8-fold. The use of recombinant Pseudomonas fluorescens CHA0 instead of E. coli resulted in a similar activity increase. However, substrate mass transfer into cells was still found to be limiting. Remarkably, the coexpression of the alkL gene of P. putida GPo1 encoding an outer membrane protein with so-far-unknown function increased the dodecanoic acid methyl ester oxygenation activity of recombinant E. coli 28-fold. In a two-liquid-phase bioreactor setup, a 62-fold increase to a maximal activity of 87 U g(cdw)(-1) was achieved, enabling the accumulation of high titers of terminally oxyfunctionalized products. Coexpression of alkL also increased oxygenation activities toward the natural AlkBGT substrates octane and nonane, showing for the first time clear evidence for a prominent role of AlkL in alkane degradation. This study demonstrates that AlkL is an efficient tool to boost productivities of whole-cell biotransformations involving hydrophobic aliphatic substrates and thus has potential for broad applicability.
TI  - Novel polymer anchored Cr(III) Schiff base complexes: synthesis, characterization and antimicrobial properties.
AB  - New polymer-bound Schiff bases and Cr(III) complexes have been synthesized by the reaction of 4-benzyloxybenzaldehyde, polymer-bound with 2-aminophenol, 2-amino-4-chlorophenol and 2-amino-4-methylphenol. The structure of polymeric-Schiff bases and their Cr(III) complexes have been characterized by elemental analyses, magnetic measurements, IR, UV-Vis, TG-DTA and (1)H-NMR. All these compounds have also been investigated for antibacterial activity by the well-diffusion method against Staphylococcus aureus (RSKK-07035), Shigella dysenteria type 10 (RSKK 1036), Listeria monocytogenes 4b(ATCC 19115, Escherichia coli (ATCC 1230), Salmonella typhi H (NCTC 901.8394), Staphylococcus epidermis (ATCC 12228), Brucella abortus (RSKK-03026), Micrococcs luteus (ATCC 93419, Bacillus cereus sp., Pseudomonas putida sp. and for antifungal activity against Candida albicans (Y-1200-NIH).
TI  - ATP-dependent RecG helicase is required for the transcriptional regulator OxyR function in Pseudomonas species.
AB  - The oxyR gene appears to reside in an operon with the recG helicase gene in many  bacteria, including pathogenic Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas putida. Analysis of P. putida transcriptomes shows that many OxyR-controlled genes are regulated by the ATP-dependent RecG helicase and that RecG alone modulates the expression of many genes. We found that purified RecG binds to the promoters of many OxyR-controlled genes and that expression of these genes was not induced under conditions of oxidative stress in recG mutants of P. aeruginosa, P. putida, and Escherichia coli. In vitro data revealed that promoters containing palindromic sequences are essential for RecG binding and that single-strand binding proteins and ATP are also needed for RecG to promote transcription, whereas a magnesium ion has the opposite effect. The OxyR tetramer preferentially binds to promoters after RecG has generated linear DNA in the presence of ATP; otherwise, the OxyR dimer has higher affinity. This study provides new insights into the mechanism of bacterial transcription by demonstrating that RecG might be required for the induction of the OxyR regulon by unwinding palindromic DNA for transcription. This work describes a novel bacterial transcriptional function by RecG helicase with OxyR and may provide new targets for controlling Pseudomonas species pathogen.
TI  - Isolation of a gene responsible for the oxidation of trans-anethole to para-anisaldehyde by Pseudomonas putida JYR-1 and its expression in Escherichia coli.
AB  - A plasmid, pTA163, in Escherichia coli contained an approximately 34-kb gene fragment from Pseudomonas putida JYR-1 that included the genes responsible for the metabolism of trans-anethole to protocatechuic acid. Three Tn5-disrupted open reading frame 10 (ORF 10) mutants of plasmid pTA163 lost their abilities to catalyze trans-anethole. Heterologously expressed ORF 10 (1,047 nucleotides [nt]) under a T7 promoter in E. coli catalyzed oxidative cleavage of a propenyl group of trans-anethole to an aldehyde group, resulting in the production of para-anisaldehyde, and this gene was designated tao (trans-anethole oxygenase). The deduced amino acid sequence of TAO had the highest identity (34%) to a hypothetical protein of Agrobacterium vitis S4 and likely contained a flavin-binding site. Preferred incorporation of an oxygen molecule from water into p-anisaldehyde using (18)O-labeling experiments indicated stereo preference of TAO for hydrolysis of the epoxide group. Interestingly, unlike the narrow substrate range of isoeugenol monooxygenase from Pseudomonas putida IE27 and Pseudomonas nitroreducens Jin1, TAO from P. putida JYR-1 catalyzed isoeugenol, O-methyl isoeugenol, and isosafrole, all of which contain the 2-propenyl functional group on the aromatic ring structure. Addition of NAD(P)H to the ultrafiltered cell extracts of E. coli (pTA163) increased the activity of TAO. Due to the relaxed substrate range of TAO, it may be utilized for the production of various fragrance compounds from plant phenylpropanoids in the future.
TI  - Implantation of unmarked regulatory and metabolic modules in Gram-negative bacteria with specialised mini-transposon delivery vectors.
AB  - Engineering of robust and safe microbial cell factories requires genetic tools somewhat different from those traditionally used for laboratory-adapted microorganisms. We took advantage of the properties of broad-host-range mini-Tn5 vectors and two regulated expression systems (LacI(Q)/P(trc) and XylS/Pm), together with FRT-flanked, excisable antibiotic resistance determinants, to generate a set of vectors for the delivery of gene(s) into the chromosome of Gram-negative bacteria. This arrangement of modular elements allows the cloning and subsequent markerless insertion of expression cargoes and leaves behind an antibiotic-sensitive host upon the action of the yeast Flp recombinase. We engineered a Pseudomonas putida KT2440 Pm::gfp strain that displayed strong fluorescence upon exposure to 3-methylbenzoate, a XylS effector, and allowed us to examine the performance of the Pm promoter at the single cell level. We also reconstructed a device for sugar transport and phosphorylation in Escherichia coli independent of the native phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system by the stable implantation of genes derived from the obligate anaerobe Zymomonas mobilis. In both cases, the information carried by the implanted genes was stably inherited in the absence of any selective pressure. Deliverable expression systems such as those described here will enhance the applicability of various Gram-negative bacteria in biocatalysis and environmental bioremediation.
TI  - Cloning and sequencing of a gene encoding of aldehyde oxidase in Pseudomonas sp.  AIU 362.
AB  - We have cloned a gene encoding an aldehyde oxidase (ALOD) oxidized glyoxal but not glyoxylic acid from Pseudomonas sp. AIU 362. The ALOD gene contained an open reading frame consisting of 888 nucleotides corresponding to 295 amino acid residues. The deduced amino acid sequence exhibited a high similarity to those of 3-hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenases (3-HIBDHs). We expressed the cloned gene as an active product in Escherichia coli BL21 cells. The productivity (total units per culture broth volume) of the recombinant ALOD expressed in E. coli BL21 was 20,000-fold higher than that of ALOD in Pseudomonas sp. AIU 362. The recombinant ALOD exhibited ALOD activity and 3-HIBDH activity. The 3-HIBDH from Pseudomonas putida KT2440 also exhibited ALOD activity. Thus, the ALOD from Pseudomonas sp. AIU 362 and 3-HIBDH from P. putida KT2440 were classified into the same enzyme group.
TI  - Production and characterization of poly(3-hydroxypropionate-co-4-hydroxybutyrate) with fully controllable structures by recombinant Escherichia coli containing an engineered pathway.
AB  - Copolyesters of 3-hydroxypropionate (3HP) and 4-hydroxybutyrate (4HB), abbreviated as P(3HP-co-4HB), was synthesized by Escherichia coli harboring a synthetic pathway consisting of five heterologous genes including orfZ encoding 4-hydroxybutyrate-coenzyme A transferase from Clostridium kluyveri, pcs' encoding the ACS domain of tri-functional propionyl-CoA ligase (PCS) from Chloroflexus aurantiacus, dhaT and aldD encoding dehydratase and aldehyde dehydrogenase from Pseudomonas putida KT2442, and phaC1 encoding PHA synthase from Ralstonia eutropha. When grown on mixtures of 1,3-propanediol (PDO) and 1,4-butanediol (BDO), compositions of 4HB in microbial P(3HP-co-4HB) were controllable ranging from 12 mol% to 82 mol% depending on PDO/BDO ratios. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra clearly indicated the polymers were random copolymers of 3HP and 4HB. Their mechanical and thermal properties showed obvious changes depending on the monomer ratios. Morphologically, P(3HP-co-4HB) films only became fully transparent when monomer 4HB content was around 67 mol%. For the first time, P(3HP-co-4HB) with adjustable monomer ratios were produced and characterized.
TI  - Novel fiber optic detection method for in situ analysis of fluorescently labeled  biosensor organisms.
AB  - This research presents a novel, time-resolved fiber-optic "Optrode" system for accurate real-time in situ detection of fluorescent proteins produced by biosensor organisms. The Optrode fluorescence detection system was able to identify, characterize, differentiate, and quantify red and green fluorescently labeled organisms, individually and in mixed aqueous cultures. Detection was also possible in sand systems, where a consistent reduction in signal intensity indicates that signal collection volume was reduced by one-third. The optrode was shown to be sensitive enough to detect fluorescently labeled cell concentrations of 1.9 x 10(4) CFU/mL, indicating it is suitable for detecting typical concentrations of degrader organisms reported in bioremediation trials. The effect of fluorophore photobleaching was characterized for different fluorescent proteins and demonstrated a linear relationship to cell concentration, meaning the effect can be accounted for within methods of fluorescence collection and analysis. Proof of concept is provided for all aspects of this research, which represents an important step toward the goal of achieving a complete, nondestructive, in situ monitoring system to characterize all aspects of microbial activity and gene expression.
TI  - Predatory Bacteriovorax communities ordered by various prey species.
AB  - The role of predation in altering microbial communities has been studied for decades but few examples are known for bacterial predators. Bacteriovorax are halophilic prokaryotes that prey on susceptible gram-negative bacteria. We recently reported novel observations on the differential selection of Bacteriovorax phylotypes by two different prey, Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Vibrio vulnificus. However, the conclusion is restricted by the limited number of prey tested. In this study, we have conducted two independent investigations involving eight species of prey bacteria while using V. vulnificus and V. parahaemolytics as reference strains. Water samples collected from Dry Bar, Apalachicola Bay were used to establish microcosms which were respectively spiked with prey strains Vibrio cholerae, Escherichia coli or Pseudomonas putida to examine the response of native Bacteriovorax to freshwater bacteria. Indigenous Vibrio sp., Pseudoalteromonas sp., Photobacterium sp. and a clinical strain of V. vulnificus were also tested for the impact of saltwater prey on the Bacteriovorax community. At 24 hour intervals, optical density of the microcosm samples and the abundance of Bacteriovorax were measured over five days. The predominant Bacteriovorax plaques were selected and analyzed by 16S rRNA gene amplification and sequencing. In addition, the impacts of prey on predator population and bacterial community composition were investigated using culture independent denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. Strikingly, Cluster IV was found consistently as the predominant phylotype produced by the freshwater prey. For all saltwater prey, subgroups of Bacteriovorax phylotype IX were the major predators recovered. The results suggest that prey is an important factor along with temperature, salinity and other environmental parameters in shaping Bacteriovorax communities in aquatic systems.
TI  - Heterologous expression and genetic engineering of the tubulysin biosynthetic gene cluster using Red/ET recombineering and inactivation mutagenesis.
AB  - Although the tubulysin (tub) biosynthetic gene cluster has been located in two myxobacterial strains, it appears in both cases to be incomplete as obvious candidates for acyl transfer and oxidation functions are lacking. Here, we report the engineering of a heterologous expression system for the tub biosynthetic pathway from strain Cystobacter sp. SBCb004. The entire tub core cluster was reconstituted from two cosmids using Red/ET recombineering and heterologous expression achieved in strains Pseudomonas putida and Myxococcus xanthus. Availability of the heterologous expression system and the natural producer strain SBCb004 provided a platform for the functional investigation of various biosynthetic genes by targeted inactivation. In addition, BLAST analysis of SBCb004 genome data was used to identify multiple candidate monooxygenases, whose involvement in tubulysin assembly was evaluated using a combination of knockout mutagenesis and heterologous expression.
TI  - Novel broad host range shuttle vectors for expression in Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis and Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - Novel shuttle vectors named pEBP were constructed to allow the gene expression in different bacterial hosts including Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis and Pseudomonas putida. These vectors share the inducible promoters P(T7) and P(Xyl) and a cos site to enable packaging of plasmid DNA into phage, and carry different multiple cloning sites and antibiotic resistance genes. Vector pEBP41 generally replicates episomally while pEBP18 replicates episomally in Gram-negative bacteria only, but integrates into the chromosome of B. subtilis. Plasmid copy numbers determined for E. coli and P. putida were in the range of 5-50 per cell. The functionality of pEBP18 and pEBP41 was confirmed by expression of two lipolytic enzymes, namely lipase A from B. subtilis and cutinase from the eukaryotic fungus Fusarium solani pisi in three different host strains. Additionally, we report here the construction of a T7 RNA polymerase-based expression strain of P. putida.
TI  - Non-enzymatic palladium recovery on microbial and synthetic surfaces.
AB  - The use of microorganisms as support for reduction of dissolved Pd(II) to immobilized Pd(0) nanoparticles is an environmentally friendly approach for Pd recovery from waste. To better understand and engineer Pd(0) nanoparticle synthesis, one has to consider the mechanisms by which Pd(II) is reduced on microbial surfaces. Escherichia coli, Shewanella oneidensis, and Pseudomonas putida were used as model organisms in order to elucidate the role of microbial cells in Pd(II) reduction under acidic conditions. Pd(II) was reduced by formate under acidic conditions, and the process occurred substantially faster in the presence of cells as compared to cell-free controls. We found no difference between native (untreated) and autoclaved cells, and could demonstrate that even a non-enzymatic protein (bovine serum albumin) stimulated Pd(II) reduction as efficiently as bacterial cells. Amine groups readily interact with Pd(II), and to specifically test their role in surface-assisted Pd(II) reduction by formate, we replaced bacterial cells with polystyrene microparticles functionalized with amine or carboxyl groups. Amine-functionalized microparticles had the same effect on Pd(II) reduction as bacterial cells, and the effect could be hampered if the amine groups were blocked by acetylation. The interaction with amine groups was confirmed by infrared spectroscopy on whole cells and amine-functionalized microparticles. In conclusion, bio-supported Pd(II) reduction on microbial surfaces is possibly mediated by a non-enzymatic mechanism. We therefore suggest the use of amine-rich biomaterials rather than intact cells for Pd bio-recovery from waste.
TI  - Metabolic and regulatory rearrangements underlying efficient D-xylose utilization in engineered Pseudomonas putida S12.
AB  - Previously, an efficient D-xylose utilizing Pseudomonas putida S12 strain was obtained by introducing the D-xylose isomerase pathway from Escherichia coli, followed by evolutionary selection. In the present study, systemic changes associated with the evolved phenotype were identified by transcriptomics, enzyme activity analysis, and inverse engineering. A key element in improving the initially poor D-xylose utilization was the redistribution of 6-phospho-D-gluconate (6-PG) between the Entner-Doudoroff pathway and the oxidative pentose phosphate (PP) pathway. This redistribution increased the availability of 6-PG for oxidative decarboxylation to D-ribose-5-phosphate, which is essential for the utilization of D-xylose via the nonoxidative PP pathway. The metabolic redistribution of 6-PG was procured by modified HexR regulation, which in addition appeared to control periplasmic sugar oxidation. Because the absence of periplasmic D-xylonate formation was previously demonstrated to be essential for achieving a high biomass yield on D-xylose, the aberrant HexR control appeared to underlie both the improved growth rate and biomass yield of the evolved D-xylose utilizing P. putida strain. The increased oxidative PP pathway activity furthermore resulted in an elevated NADH/NAD(+) ratio that caused the metabolic flux to be redirected from the TCA cycle to the glyoxylate shunt, which was also activated transcriptionally. Clearly, these findings may serve as an important case in point to engineer and improve the utilization of non-natural carbon sources in a wide range of industrial microorganisms.
TI  - Whole-cell hydroxylation of n-octane by Escherichia coli strains expressing the CYP153A6 operon.
AB  - CYP153A6 is a well-studied terminal alkane hydroxylase which has previously been  expressed in Pseudomonas putida and Escherichia coli by using the pCom8 plasmid. In this study, CYP153A6 was successfully expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) by cloning the complete operon from Mycobacterium sp. HXN-1500, also encoding the ferredoxin reductase and ferredoxin, into pET28b(+). LB medium with IPTG as well as auto-induction medium was used to express the proteins under the T7 promoter. A maximum concentration of 1.85 muM of active CYP153A6 was obtained when using auto-induction medium, while with IPTG induction of LB cultures, the P450 concentration peaked at 0.6-0.8 muM. Since more biomass was produced in auto-induction medium, the specific P450 content was often almost the same, 0.5-1.0 mumol P450 g (DCW)(-)(1), for both methods. Analytical scale whole-cell biotransformations of n-octane were conducted with resting cells, and it was found that high P450 content in biomass did not necessarily result in high octanol production. Whole cells from LB cultures induced with IPTG gave higher specific and volumetric octanol formation rates than biomass from auto-induction medium. A maximum of 8.7 g octanol L (BRM)(-)(1) was obtained within 24 h (0.34 g L (BRM)(-)(1) h(-)(1)) with IPTG-induced cells containing only 0.20 mumol P450 g (DCW)(-)(1), when glucose (22 g L (BRM)(-)(1)) was added for cofactor regeneration.
TI  - Broad diversity of conjugative plasmids in integron-carrying bacteria from wastewater environments.
AB  - In this study we assessed the occurrence, diversity and conjugative potential of  plasmids in integron-carrying Aeromonas and Enterobacteriaceae from wastewaters. Sixty-six strains were included as donors in mating assays using rifampicin-resistant Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida recipient strains. The diversity of plasmids from donors and transconjugants (resistant to tetracycline or streptomycin) was evaluated by restriction analysis and replicon typing targeting 19 incompatibility groups. Restriction patterns revealed a diverse plasmid pool present in these strains. Plasmids were assigned to FrepB (Aeromonas salmonicida, Aeromonas veronii, Aeromonas sp., E. coli, Enterobacter sp.), FIC (A. salmonicida, Aeromonas sp.), FIA (Shigella sp.), I1 (A. veronii, Aeromonas sp., E. coli), HI1 (E. coli) and U (Aeromonas media) replicons. Nevertheless, 50% of the plasmids could not be assigned to any replicon type. Among integron-positive transconjugants, FrepB, I1 and HI1 replicons were detected. Results showed that wastewaters enclose a rich plasmid pool associated with integron-carrying bacteria, capable of conjugating to different bacterial hosts. Moreover, replicons detected in this study in Aeromonas strains expand our current knowledge of plasmid diversity in this genus.
TI  - Novel, highly specific N-demethylases enable bacteria to live on caffeine and related purine alkaloids.
AB  - The molecular basis for the ability of bacteria to live on caffeine as a sole carbon and nitrogen source is unknown. Pseudomonas putida CBB5, which grows on several purine alkaloids, metabolizes caffeine and related methylxanthines via sequential N-demethylation to xanthine. Metabolism of caffeine by CBB5 was previously attributed to one broad-specificity methylxanthine N-demethylase composed of two subunits, NdmA and NdmB. Here, we report that NdmA and NdmB are actually two independent Rieske nonheme iron monooxygenases with N(1)- and N(3)-specific N-demethylation activity, respectively. Activity for both enzymes is dependent on electron transfer from NADH via a redox-center-dense Rieske reductase, NdmD. NdmD itself is a novel protein with one Rieske [2Fe-2S] cluster, one plant-type [2Fe-2S] cluster, and one flavin mononucleotide (FMN) per enzyme. All ndm genes are located in a 13.2-kb genomic DNA fragment which also contained a formaldehyde dehydrogenase. ndmA, ndmB, and ndmD were cloned as His(6) fusion genes, expressed in Escherichia coli, and purified using a Ni-NTA column. NdmA-His(6) plus His(6)-NdmD catalyzed N(1)-demethylation of caffeine, theophylline, paraxanthine, and 1-methylxanthine to theobromine, 3-methylxanthine, 7-methylxanthine, and xanthine, respectively. NdmB-His(6) plus His(6)-NdmD catalyzed N(3)-demethylation of theobromine, 3-methylxanthine, caffeine, and theophylline to 7-methylxanthine, xanthine, paraxanthine, and 1-methylxanthine, respectively. One formaldehyde was produced from each methyl group removed. Activity of an N(7)-specific N-demethylase, NdmC, has been confirmed biochemically. This is the first report of bacterial N-demethylase genes that enable bacteria to live on caffeine. These genes represent a new class of Rieske oxygenases and have the potential to produce biofuels, animal feed, and pharmaceuticals from coffee and tea waste.
TI  - Evolution of an alkane-inducible biosensor for increased responsiveness to short-chain alkanes.
AB  - Synthetic alkane-inducible biosensors have applications as detectors for environmental hydrocarbon contamination and as novel inducible expression systems with low-cost inducers. Here, we have assembled and evolved an alkane-responsive biosensor with a fluorescence output signal in Escherichia coli by utilizing regulatory machinery from Pseudomonas putida's alkane metabolism. Within our system, the transcriptional regulator, AlkSp, is activated by the presence of alkanes and binds to the P(alkB) promoter, stimulating transcription of a Green Fluorescent Protein reporter. Through two successive rounds of directed evolution via error prone PCR and fluorescence activated cell sorting, we isolated alkS mutants enabling up to a 5 fold increase in fluorescence output signal in response to short-chain alkanes such as hexane and pentane. Further characterization of selected mutants demonstrated altered responsiveness to a wide range of linear alkanes (pentane to dodecane). Sequence analysis highlighted the S470T mutation as a likely candidate responsible for increased effectiveness of the AlkS protein for short-chain alkanes. This work represents the first evolution of a synthetic biosensor system for alkanes.
TI  - Identification and characterization of an indigo-producing oxygenase involved in  indole 3-acetic acid utilization by Acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  - Acinetobacter baumannii harbours a gene cluster similar to the iac locus of Pseudomonas putida 1290, which can catabolize the plant hormone indole 3-acetic acid (IAA) as an energy source. However, there has been no evidence showing that IAA can be utilized by A. baumannii. This study showed that A. baumannii can grow in M9 minimal medium containing IAA as the sole carbon source. A mutagenesis study indicated that iacA, encoded in the iac locus of A. baumannii, is involved in the catabolism of IAA. As shown by western blotting analysis, the IacA protein was detected in A. baumannii grown in M9 minimal medium with IAA but not with pyruvate, suggesting that the expression of iacA is regulated by the presence of IAA. In vitro studies have shown that IacA can oxidize indole, an IAA-like molecule, converting it to indoxyl, which spontaneously dimerises to form indigo. In this study, we show that the crude extracts from either wild-type A. baumannii or Escherichia coli overexpressing IacA can oxidize IAA. These results imply that the iac gene cluster of A. baumannii is involved in IAA degradation and that the iacA gene is upregulated when cells encounter IAA in their native environments.
TI  - Selective enumeration of viable Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas spp. in milk within 7 h by multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization following microcolony formation.
AB  - Rapid and simultaneous enumeration of viable Enterobacteriaceae and viable Pseudomonas spp. in milk was achieved by using multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with oligonucleotide probes based on 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequences in combination with a microcolony growth method (multicolor microcolony-FISH; MMC-FISH). The procedure of MMC-FISH method is rather simple; that is milk clearing, filtration of cells, incubation, hybridization and enumeration. Enumeration of targeted bacteria in logarithmic growth phase, stationary phase, or in a starved state in milk by MMC-FISH required 5-7 h, while it took 1-3 days to test for Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida by the conventional culture method. The numbers of E. coli and P. putida in each phase or in a starved state in milk determined by MMC-FISH were almost the same or greater than the number of colony forming units determined by the plate counting method. The MMC-FISH allows rapid examination of contamination in milk by viable Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas spp. with growth potential.
TI  - Completing the series of BVMOs involved in camphor metabolism of Pseudomonas putida NCIMB 10007 by identification of the two missing genes, their functional expression in E. coli, and biochemical characterization.
AB  - The camphor-degrading Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenases (BVMOs) from Pseudomonas putida NCIMB 10007 have been of interest for over 40 years. So far the FMN- and NADH-dependent type II BVMO 3,6-diketocamphane 1,6-monooxygenase (3,6-DKCMO) and the FAD- and NADPH-dependent type I BVMO 2-oxo-3-4,5,5-trimethylcyclopentenylacetyl-CoA monooxygenase (OTEMO) have not been entirely studied, since it was not possible to produce those enzymes in satisfactory amounts and purity. In this study, we were able to clone and recombinantly express both enzymes and subsequently use them as biocatalysts for various mono- and bicyclic ketones. Full conversion could be reached with both enzymes towards (+/-)-cis-bicyclo[3.2.0]hept-2-en-6-one and with 3,6-DKCMO towards (-)-camphor. Further OTEMO gave full conversion with norcamphor. OTEMO was found to have a pH optimum of 9 and a temperature optimum of 20 degrees C and converted (+/-)-cis-bicyclo[3.2.0]hept-2-en-6-one with a k cat/K M value of 49.3 mM-1 s-1.
TI  - A T7 RNA polymerase-based toolkit for the concerted expression of clustered genes.
AB  - Bacterial genes whose enzymes are either assembled into complex multi-domain proteins or form biosynthetic pathways are frequently organized within large chromosomal clusters. The functional expression of clustered genes, however, remains challenging since it generally requires an expression system that facilitates the coordinated transcription of numerous genes irrespective of their natural promoters and terminators. Here, we report on the development of a novel expression system that is particularly suitable for the homologous expression of multiple genes organized in a contiguous cluster. The new expression toolkit consists of an Omega interposon cassette carrying a T7 RNA polymerase specific promoter which is designed for promoter tagging of clustered genes and a small set of broad-host-range plasmids providing the respective polymerase in different bacteria. The uptake hydrogenase gene locus of the photosynthetic non-sulfur purple bacterium Rhodobacter capsulatus which consists of 16 genes was used as an example to demonstrate functional expression only by T7 RNA polymerase but not by bacterial RNA polymerase. Our findings clearly indicate that due to its unique properties T7 RNA polymerase can be applied for overexpression of large and complex bacterial gene regions.
TI  - Efficacy of multiple metals against copper-resistant bacterial strains.
AB  - AIMS: The antibacterial efficacy of zeolites containing copper (Cu) or silver (Ag) ions or a combination was assessed against several reported copper-resistant (Cu(R)) bacterial strains. METHODS AND RESULTS: Comparison strains were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection that had no documented metal resistance. Reductions in bacterial populations were determined after exposure time intervals of 3, 6 and 24 h. All three Cu(R) strains of Salmonella enterica exhibited resistance to Cu, Ag and Cu/Ag after three and 6 h of exposure. Both the Cu(R) and comparison strain of Enterococcus faecium were resistant to both metals and the metal combination. Cu(R) Pseudomonas putida was significantly reduced by all zeolites within 3 h. The Cu(R) Escherichia coli strain was more sensitive to Cu, but more resistant to Ag than the comparison strain; however, significant reductions were achieved within 3 h with both Cu and Cu/Ag, and within 24 h with Ag. CONCLUSIONS: Some strains with reported resistance to Cu were also resistant to Ag, suggestive of a shared resistance mechanism such as an indiscriminate Cu efflux pump. Ent. faecium appears to have innate resistance to both metals. In general, Ent. faecium was the most resistant species to the individual metals and the combination of metals, Ps. putida the least resistant, and the Salmonella strains were more resistant than E. coli. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Several of the comparison strains with no reported copper resistance were resistant to one or both metals. This may call into question the methods for determining bacterial metal resistance, which typically use nutrient-rich media containing metals to assess the ability of the bacteria to grow in comparison with a wild-type strain. Nevertheless, all the Cu(R) strains evaluated in this study, with the exception of Ent. faecium, were reduced using the Cu and Ag zeolite combination.
TI  - Cloning, Baeyer-Villiger biooxidations, and structures of the camphor pathway 2-oxo-Delta(3)-4,5,5-trimethylcyclopentenylacetyl-coenzyme A monooxygenase of Pseudomonas putida ATCC 17453.
AB  - A dimeric Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenase (BVMO) catalyzing the lactonization of 2-oxo-Delta(3)-4,5,5-trimethylcyclopentenylacetyl-coenzyme A (CoA), a key intermediate in the metabolism of camphor by Pseudomonas putida ATCC 17453, had been initially characterized in 1983 by Ougham and coworkers (H. J. Ougham, D. G. Taylor, and P. W. Trudgill, J. Bacteriol. 153:140-152, 1983). Here we cloned and overexpressed the 2-oxo-Delta(3)-4,5,5-trimethylcyclopentenylacetyl-CoA monooxygenase (OTEMO) in Escherichia coli and determined its three-dimensional structure with bound flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) at a 1.95-A resolution as well as with bound FAD and NADP(+) at a 2.0-A resolution. OTEMO represents the first homodimeric type 1 BVMO structure bound to FAD/NADP(+). A comparison of several crystal forms of OTEMO bound to FAD and NADP(+) revealed a conformational plasticity of several loop regions, some of which have been implicated in contributing to the substrate specificity profile of structurally related BVMOs. Substrate specificity studies confirmed that the 2-oxo-Delta(3)-4,5,5-trimethylcyclopentenylacetic acid coenzyme A ester is preferred over the free acid. However, the catalytic efficiency (k(cat)/K(m)) favors 2-n-hexyl cyclopentanone (4.3 x 10(5) M(-1) s(-1)) as a substrate, although its affinity (K(m) = 32 muM) was lower than that of the CoA-activated substrate (K(m) = 18 muM). In whole-cell biotransformation experiments, OTEMO showed a unique enantiocomplementarity to the action of the prototypical cyclohexanone monooxygenase (CHMO) and appeared to be particularly useful for the oxidation of 4-substituted cyclohexanones. Overall, this work extends our understanding of the molecular structure and mechanistic complexity of the type 1 family of BVMOs and expands the catalytic repertoire of one of its original members.
TI  - Bacterial chemotaxis toward a NAPL source within a pore-scale microfluidic chamber.
AB  - Chemotaxis toward chemical pollutants provides a mechanism for bacteria to migrate to locations of high contamination, which may improve the effectiveness of bioremediation. A microfluidic device was designed to mimic the dissolution of an organic-phase contaminant from a single pore into a larger macropore representing a preferred pathway for microorganisms that are carried along by groundwater flow. The glass windows of the microfluidic device allowed direct image analysis of bacterial distributions within the vicinity of the organic contaminant. Concentrations of chemotactic bacteria P. putida F1 near the organic/aqueous interface were 25% greater than those of a nonchemotactic mutant in the vicinity of toluene for a fluid velocity of 0.5 m/d. For E. coli responding to phenol, the bacterial concentrations were 60% greater than the controls, also at a velocity of 0.5 m/d. Velocities in the macropore were varied over a range from 0.5 to 10 m/d, the lower end of which is typical of groundwater velocities. The accumulation of chemotactic bacteria near the NAPL chemoattractant source decreased as the fluid velocity increased. Good agreement between computer-based simulations, generated using reasonable values of the model parameters, and the experimental data for P. putida strains confirmed the contribution due to chemotaxis. The experimental data for E. coli required a larger chemotactic sensitivity coefficient than that for P. putida, which was consistent with parameter values reported in the literature.
TI  - Ecotoxicological evaluation of wastewater from 2.4.6-TNT production.
AB  - During the manufacture of explosives, large amounts of water are used to remove unwanted by-products generated. This water in turn, ends up in wastewater treatment plants or water bodies. The aim of this study was to evaluate the toxic potential of effluent generated by 2.4.6-Trinitrotoluene (TNT) production, yellow water, red water and mixture of yellow and red water, produced from a plant located in the Paraiba Valley, Sao Paolo state, Brazil. Daphnia similis, Danio rerio, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas putida and Pseudokircheneriella subcaptata were used as test organisms. Physicochemical parameters such as color, pH, conductivity, total dissolved solids, dissolved oxygen, chemical oxygen demand (COD) and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) were evaluated. Effluent from 2.4.6-TNT production was extremely toxic to all test organisms. The physicochemical parameters evaluated showed high levels of conductivity (from 41.533 to 42.344 muS /cm) and chemical oxygen demand (COD of 8471 to 27.364 mg/L) for the effluents analyzed.
TI  - Expression, purification and preliminary crystallographic studies of NahF, a salicylaldehyde dehydrogenase from Pseudomonas putida G7 involved in naphthalene degradation.
AB  - Pseudomonas putida G7 is one of the most studied naphthalene-degrading species. The nah operon in P. putida, which is present on the 83 kb metabolic plasmid NAH7, codes for enzymes involved in the conversion of naphthalene to salicylate. The enzyme NahF (salicylaldehyde dehydrogenase) catalyzes the last reaction in this pathway. The nahF gene was subcloned into the pET28a(TEV) vector and the recombinant protein was overexpressed in Escherichia coli Arctic Express at 285 K. The soluble protein was purified by affinity chromatography followed by gel filtration. Crystals of recombinant NahF (6xHis-NahF) were obtained at 291 K and diffracted to 2.42 A resolution. They belonged to the hexagonal space group P6(4)22, with unit-cell parameters a = b = 169.47, c = 157.94 A. The asymmetric unit contained a monomer and a crystallographic twofold axis generated the dimeric biological unit.
TI  - Roles of long and short replication initiation proteins in the fate of IncP-1 plasmids.
AB  - Broad-host-range IncP-1 plasmids generally encode two replication initiation proteins, TrfA1 and TrfA2. TrfA2 is produced from an internal translational start site within trfA1. While TrfA1 was previously shown to be essential for replication in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, its role in other bacteria within its broad host range has not been established. To address the role of TrfA1 and TrfA2 in other hosts, efficiency of transformation, plasmid copy number (PCN), and plasmid stability were first compared between a mini-IncP-1beta plasmid and its trfA1 frameshift variant in four phylogenetically distant hosts: Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas putida, Sphingobium japonicum, and Cupriavidus necator. TrfA2 was sufficient for replication in these hosts, but the presence of TrfA1 enhanced transformation efficiency and PCN. However, TrfA1 did not contribute to, and even negatively affected, long-term plasmid persistence. When trfA genes were cloned under a constitutive promoter in the chromosomes of the four hosts, strains expressing either both TrfA1 and TrfA2 or TrfA1 alone, again, generally elicited a higher PCN of an IncP1-beta replicon than strains expressing TrfA2 alone. When a single species of TrfA was produced at different concentrations in E. coli cells, TrfA1 maintained a 3- to 4-fold higher PCN than TrfA2 at the same TrfA concentrations, indicating that replication mediated by TrfA1 is more efficient than that by TrfA2. These results suggest that the broad-host-range properties of IncP-1 plasmids are essentially conferred by TrfA2 and the intact replication origin alone but that TrfA1 is nonetheless important to efficiently establish plasmid replication upon transfer into a broad range of hosts.
TI  - Fis regulates the competitiveness of Pseudomonas putida on barley roots by inducing biofilm formation.
AB  - An important link between the environment and the physiological state of bacteria is the regulation of the transcription of a large number of genes by global transcription factors. One of the global regulators, Fis (factor for inversion stimulation), is well studied in Escherichia coli, but the role of this protein in pseudomonads has only been examined briefly. According to studies in Enterobacteriaceae, Fis regulates positively the flagellar movement of bacteria. In pseudomonads, flagellar movement is an important trait for the colonization of plant roots. Therefore we were interested in the role of the Fis protein in Pseudomonas putida, especially the possible regulation of the colonization of plant roots. We observed that Fis reduced the migration of P. putida onto the apices of barley roots and thereby the competitiveness of bacteria on the roots. Moreover, we observed that overexpression of Fis drastically reduced swimming motility and facilitated P. putida biofilm formation, which could be the reason for the decreased migration of bacteria onto the root apices. It is possible that the elevated expression of Fis is important in the adaptation of P. putida during colonization of plant roots by promoting biofilm formation when the migration of bacteria is no longer favoured.
TI  - The Fe(II)/alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent taurine dioxygenases from Pseudomonas putida and Escherichia coli are tetramers.
AB  - Fe(II)/alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent oxygenases are versatile catalysts associated with a number of different biological functions in which they use the oxidizing power of activated dioxygen to convert a variety of substrates. A mononuclear nonheme iron center is used to couple the decarboxylation of the cosubstrate alpha-ketoglutarate with a two-electron oxidation of the substrate, which is a hydroxylation in most cases. Although Fe(II)/alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent oxygenases have diverse amino acid sequences and substrate specifity, it is assumed that they share a common mechanism. One representative of this enzyme family is the Fe(II)/alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent taurine dioxygenase that catalyzes the hydroxylation of taurine yielding sulfite and aminoacetaldehyde. Its mechanism has been studied in detail becoming a model system for the whole enzyme family. However, its oligomeric state and architecture have been disputed. Here, we report the biochemical and kinetic characterization of the Fe(II)/alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent taurine dioxygenase from Pseudomonas putida KT2440 (TauD(Pp) ). We also present three crystal structures of the apo form of this enzyme. Comparisons with taurine dioxygenase from Escherichia coli (TauD(Ec) ) demonstrate that both enzymes are quite similar regarding their spectra, structure and kinetics, and only minor differences for the accumulation of intermediates during the reaction have been observed. Structural data and analytical gel filtration, as well as sedimentation velocity analytical ultracentrifugation, show that both TauD(Pp) and TauD(Ec) are tetramers in solution and in the crystals, which is in contrast to the earlier description of taurine dioxygenase from E. coli as a dimer. Database The atomic coordinates and structure factors have been deposited with the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank (entry 3PVJ, 3V15, 3V17) Structured digital abstract * tauDpp and tauDpp bind by molecular sieving (View interaction) * tauDpp and tauDpp bind by x-ray crystallography (View interaction) * tauDEc and tauDEc bind by molecular sieving (View interaction).
TI  - Production and characterization of a recombinant single-chain antibody (scFv) for tracing the sigma54 factor of Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - The number of alternative sigma factor molecules per bacterial cell determines either stochasticity or evenness of transcription of cognate promoters. An approach for examining the abundance of sigmas in any sample of bacterial origin is explained here which relies on the production of a recombinant highly specific, high-affinity single-chain variable Fv domain (scFv) targeted towards unique protein sites of the factor. Purposely, a super-binder scFv recognizing a distinct epitope of the less abundant sigma sigma(54) of Pseudomonas putida (also known as sigma(N)) was obtained and its properties examined in detail. To this end, an scFv library was generated from mRNA extracted from lymphocytes of mice immunized with the purified sigma(54) protein of this bacterium. The library was displayed on a phage system and subjected to various rounds of panning with purified sigma(54) for capturing extreme binders. The resulting high-affinity anti-sigma(54) phage antibody (Phab) clone named C2 strongly attached a small region located between positions 172 and 183 of the primary amino acid sequence of sigma(54) that overlaps its core RNA polymerase-binding region. The purified scFv-C2 detected minute amounts of sigma(54) in whole cell protein extracts not only of P. putida but also Escherichia coli cells and putatively in other bacteria as well. The affinity constant of the purified antibody was measured by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and found to have a K(D) (k(off)/k(on)) in the range of 2x10(-9)M. The considerable affinity and specificity of this recombinant antibody makes it a tool of choice for quantitative studies on gene expression of sigma(54)-dependent promoters in P. putida and other Gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Engineering whole-cell biosensors with no antibiotic markers for monitoring aromatic compounds in the environment.
AB  - A cornerstone of Synthetic Biology is the engineering of gene regulatory networks. Construction of such biological circuits has been used not only to elucidate the dynamics of gene expression but also for designing whole-cell biosensors that translate environmental signals into quantifiable outputs. To this end, distinct components of given regulatory systems are rationally rewired in a way that translates an external stimulus (for instance, the presence of one chemical species) into a measurable readout typically fluorescence or luminescence. Various biosensors for BTEX (a mixture of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes) are based on XylR, the main transcriptional regulator of the TOL pathway of Pseudomonas putida mt-2. In the presence of its natural effectors (e.g., m-xylene, toluene or 3-methylbenzylalcohol), XylR triggers expression of the upper pathway genes by means of the Pu promoter. Available biosensors combine the xylR gene and a direct fusion between the cognate Pu promoter and the luxCDABE operon, all components stably integrated in the chromosome of P. putida. A versatile development of the same biosensing concept is described, aimed at increasing the sensitivity of the genetic circuit toward XylR inducers. The new platform utilizes mini-transposon vectors tailored for engineering an artificial expression cascade that operates as an amplifier of the signal/response ratio of the biosensor. This strategy was applied to the construction of a strain that carries a transcriptional fusion between the Pu promoter and T7 RNA polymerase (which becomes under the control of XylR and its effectors), along with a T7 promoter controlling expression of the luxCDABE operon. This simple regulatory architecture produced a dramatic increase of bioluminescence emission in respect to the strain that carries only the direct fusion between the Pu promoter and the luxCDABE reporter.
TI  - Bacterial dioxygenase- and monooxygenase-catalysed sulfoxidation of benzo[b]thiophenes.
AB  - Asymmetric heteroatom oxidation of benzo[b]thiophenes to yield the corresponding  sulfoxides was catalysed by toluene dioxygenase (TDO), naphthalene dioxygenase (NDO) and styrene monooxygenase (SMO) enzymes present in P. putida mutant and E. coli recombinant whole cells. TDO-catalysed oxidation yielded the relatively unstable benzo[b]thiophene sulfoxide; its dimerization, followed by dehydrogenation, resulted in the isolation of stable tetracyclic sulfoxides as minor products with cis-dihydrodiols being the dominant metabolites. SMO mainly catalysed the formation of enantioenriched benzo[b]thiophene sulfoxide and 2-methyl benzo[b]thiophene sulfoxides which racemized at ambient temperature. The barriers to pyramidal sulfur inversion of 2- and 3-methyl benzo[b]thiophene sulfoxide metabolites, obtained using TDO and NDO as biocatalysts, were found to be ca.: 25-27 kcal mol(-1). The absolute configurations of the benzo[b]thiophene sulfoxides were determined by ECD spectroscopy, X-ray crystallography and stereochemical correlation. A site-directed mutant E. coli strain containing an engineered form of NDO, was found to change the regioselectivity toward preferential oxidation of the thiophene ring rather than the benzene ring.
TI  - Whole-cell bio-oxidation of n-dodecane using the alkane hydroxylase system of P.  putida GPo1 expressed in E. coli.
AB  - The alkane-1-monoxygenase (alkB) complex of Pseudomonas putida GPo1 has been extensively studied in the past and shown to be capable of oxidising aliphatic C(5)-C(12) alkanes to primary alcohols both in the wild-type organism by growth on C(5)-C(12) alkanes as sole carbon source and in vitro. Despite this, successful n-dodecane oxidation for the production of 1-dodecanol or dodecanoic acid has proven elusive in the past when using alkB-expressing recombinants. This article demonstrates, for the first time in vivo, by using the Escherichia coli GEC137 pGEc47DeltaJ strain, that n-dodecane oxidation using this enzyme for the production of primary alcohols and carboxylic acids is feasible and in fact potentially more promising than n-octane oxidation due to lower product and substrate toxicity. Yields are reported of 1-dodecanol of up to 2 g/L(organic) and dodecanoic acid up to 19.7 g/L(organic) in a 2 L stirred tank reactor with 1L aqueous phase and 200 mL of n-dodecane as a second phase. The maximum volumetric rate of combined alcohol and acid production achieved was 1.9 g/L(organic)/h (0.35 g/L(total)/h). The maximum specific activity of combined alcohol and acid production was 7-fold lower on n-dodecane (3.5 mumol/min/g(dcw)) than on n-octane (21 mumol/min/g(dcw)); similar to the 5-fold difference observed between wild-type growth rates using the two respective alkanes as sole carbon source. Despite this, both total volumetric rate and final yield exceeded n-octane oxidation by 3.5-fold under the same conditions, due to the lower toxicity of n-dodecane and its oxidation products to E. coli compared to the 8-carbon equivalents. Substrate access limitations and the overoxidation of 1-dodecanol to dodecanoic acid were identified as the most important limitations to be addressed.
TI  - Screening of bacterial cytochrome P450s responsible for regiospecific hydroxylation of (iso)flavonoids.
AB  - Screening of cytochrome P450 monoxygenases responsible for the regiospecific hydroxylation of flavones, isoflavones and chalcones was attempted using a P450 library constructed from Streptomyces avermitilis MA4680, Bacillus and Nocardia farcinica IFM10152 strains. As electron transfer redox partners with the P450s in Escherichia coli system, putidaredoxin reductase (PdR) and putidaredoxin (Pdx) from Pseudomonas putida were used. Among the 50 soluble P450s in the library screened, three cytochrome P450s, i.e. CYP107Y1, CYP125A2 and CYP107P2 from S. avermitilis MA4680 showed good hydroxylation activities towards flavones and isoflavones. However, low product yields prevented us from identifying complete structure of the products. By using S. avermitilis MA4680 as their expression host, further analysis identified that CYP107Y1(SAV2377), CYP125A2(SAV5841) and CYP107P2(SAV4539) showed good regiospecific hydroxylation activities towards genistein (4',5,7-trihydroxyisoflavone), chrysin (5,7-dihydroxyisoflavone) and apigenin (4',5,7-dihydroxyisoflavone) to produce 3',4',5,7,-tetrahydroxyisoflavone, B-ring hydroxylated 5,7-dihydroxyflavone and 3',4',5,7,-tetrahydroxyflavone, respectively. Analyses of the reaction products were performed using HPLC, ESI-MS-MS and GC-MS and 1H NMR.
TI  - First report of a bifunctional chitinase/lysozyme produced by Bacillus pumilus SG2.
AB  - Bacillus pumilus SG2 isolated from high salinity ecosystem in Iran produces two chitinases (ChiS and ChiL) and secretes them into the medium. In this study, chiS and chiL genes were cloned in pQE-30 expression vector and were expressed in the cytoplasm of Escherichia coli strain M15. The recombinant proteins were purified using Ni-NTA column. The optimum pH and optimum temperature for enzyme activity of ChiS were pH 6, 50 degrees C; those of ChiL were pH 6.5, 40 degrees C. The purified chitinases showed antifungal activity against Fusarium graminearum, Rhizoctonia solani, Magnaporthe grisea, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, Trichoderma reesei, Botrytis cinerea and Bipolaris sp. Moreover, purified ChiS was identified as chitinase/lysozyme, which are capable of degrading the chitin component of fungal cell walls and the peptidoglycan component of cell walls with many kinds of bacteria (Xanthomonas translucens pv. hordei, Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. citri, Bacillus licheniformis, E. coli C600, E. coli TOP10, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas putida). Strong homology was found between the three-dimensional structures of ChiS and a chitinase/lysozyme from Bacillus circulans WL-12. This is the first report of a bifunctional chitinase/lysozyme from B. pumilus.
TI  - New molecular variants of epsilon and beta IncP-1 plasmids are present in estuarine waters.
AB  - In this work the presence of broad-host-plasmids in an estuary in Portugal has been investigated. Pseudomonas putida KT2442 was used as model recipient bacteria in biparental matings with tetracycline and mercury to select for resistance phenotypes. As a result, 7 transconjugants were shown to carry broad-host-plasmids from the IncP-1 group, as seen by PCR amplification of the trfA gene. Sequence analysis confirmed the isolation of 4 plasmids from beta-1 subgroup and 3 assigned to the recently described epsilon subgroup. To our knowledge this is the first report concerning the detection and isolation of IncP-1beta and epsilon plasmids in estuarine waters. Moreover it is shown that, even though the retrieved plasmids are phylogenetically close to previously characterized plasmids, such as pB10 and pKJK5, respectively, they constitute new molecular variants.
TI  - Development of a new strategy for production of medium-chain-length polyhydroxyalkanoates by recombinant Escherichia coli via inexpensive non-fatty acid feedstocks.
AB  - Pseudomonas putida KT2440 is capable of producing medium-chain-length polyhydroxyalkanoates (MCL-PHAs) when grown on unrelated carbon sources during nutrient limitation. Transcription levels of genes putatively involved in PHA biosynthesis were assessed by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) in P. putida grown on glycerol as a sole carbon source. The results showed that two genes, phaG and the PP0763 gene, were highly upregulated among genes potentially involved in the biosynthesis of MCL-PHAs from unrelated carbon sources. Previous studies have described phaG as a 3-hydroxyacyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP)-coenzyme A (CoA) transferase, and based on homology, the PP0763 gene was predicted to encode a medium-chain-fatty-acid CoA ligase. High expression levels of these genes during PHA production in P. putida led to the hypothesis that these two genes are involved in PHA biosynthesis from non-fatty acid carbon sources, such as glucose and glycerol. The phaG(pp) and PP0763 genes from P. putida were cloned and coexpressed with the engineered Pseudomonas sp. 61-3 PHA synthase gene phaCl (STQK)(ps) in recombinant Escherichia coli. Up to 400 mg liter(-1) MCL-PHAs was successfully produced from glucose. This study has produced the largest amount of MCL-PHAs reported from non-fatty acid carbon sources in recombinant E. coli to date and opens up the possibility of using inexpensive feedstocks to produce MCL-PHA polymers.
TI  - Recombinant production of cathelicidin-derived antimicrobial peptides in Escherichia coli using an inducible autocleaving enzyme tag.
AB  - Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), such as the linear amphipathic cathelicidins, are  produced widely in the natural world and are active against a broad range of pathogenic microorganisms. Their potential as a new range of antibiotics has prompted numerous studies of AMP structure and function. Most such studies are performed with chemically synthesised peptides, but a simple and rapid biosynthetic route would offer a more cost-effective alternative for the production of AMPs and analysis of their structure/function relationships. The cysteine protease domain (CPD) from Vibrio cholerae MARTX toxin possesses an autocleaving ability that is inducible by inositol hexakisphosphate (IP(6)). When coupled with a hexa-histidine tag and fused to the C-terminus of an AMP, this AMP-CPD fusion may be expressed in Escherichia coli and purified using immobilized metal affinity chromatography. A brief on-column induction of cleavage liberates the AMP, and subsequent polishing using hydrophobic interaction resin allows for purification of the peptide within a day. We used this system to express and purify several 18-residue cathelicidin variants and tested their activity on E. coli, Pseudomonas putida, Bacillus subtilis and Candida albicans. This approach to linear AMP production may aid rapid construction and purification of structural variants for subsequent functional analysis.
TI  - Formation of repressor-inducer-operator ternary complex: negative cooperativity of d-camphor binding to CamR.
AB  - A repressor composed of homodimeric subunits, as is often found in bacteria, possesses two effector-binding sites per molecule, enabling sophisticated regulation by the cooperative binding of two effector molecules. Positive cooperativity generates a narrower region of effector concentration for switching, but little is known about the role of negative cooperativity. d-camphor, an inducer for Pseudomonas putida cytochrome P450cam hydroxylase operon (camDCAB), binds to the homodimeric cam repressor (CamR). Here, we report solid evidence that the complex of CamR and an operator DNA is not dissociated by the first binding of d-camphor but, at a higher concentration, is dissociated by the second binding. d-camphor thus binds to the CamR in two steps with negative cooperativity, yielding two distinct dissociation constants of K(d1 ) =( ) 0.064 +/- 0.030 and K(d2 ) =( ) 14 +/- 0.3 mum, as well as the Hill coefficient of 0.56 +/- 0.05 (<1). The first binding guarantees the high specificity of the inducer by the high affinity, although the second binding turns on the gene expression at a 200-fold higher concentration, a more suitable switching point for the catabolism of d-camphor.
TI  - Transposon-based and plasmid-based genetic tools for editing genomes of gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - A good part of the contemporary synthetic biology agenda aims at reprogramming microorganisms to enhance existing functions and/or perform new tasks. Moreover, the functioning of complex regulatory networks, or even a single gene, is revealed only when perturbations are entered in the corresponding dynamic systems and the outcome monitored. These endeavors rely on the availability of genetic tools to successfully modify a la carte the chromosome of target bacteria. Key aspects to this end include the removal of undesired genomic segments, systems for the production of directed mutants and allelic replacements, random mutant libraries to discover new functions, and means to stably implant larger genetic networks into the genome of specific hosts. The list of gram-negative species that are appealing for such genetic refactoring operations is growingly expanding. However, the repertoire of available molecular techniques to do so is very limited beyond Escherichia coli. In this chapter, utilization of novel tools is described (exemplified in two plasmids systems: pBAM1 and pEMG) tailored for facilitating chromosomal engineering procedures in a wide variety of gram-negative microorganisms.
TI  - Optimization of Fenton process for decoloration and COD removal in tobacco wastewater and toxicological evaluation of the effluent.
AB  - Decoloration and chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal in tobacco wastewater by Fenton process has been optimized under 25 +/- 2 degrees C. The results showed that the optimal range of conditions were pH 4.13-4.66, Fe(2+) 0.29-0.34 g/L and H2O2 > or = 2.73 g/L. Within this range, up to 95% of colour and 90% of COD was removed. In an enlarged system, setting the optimal conditions as pH 4.50, Fe(2+) 0.34 g/L and H2O2 4.00 g/L, the colour removal rate was 96.03 +/- 2.57%, with COD removal rate of 93.30 +/- 2.92%. The residual COD of 73.67 +/- 19.70 mg/L in effluent had hit the State's first-class standard for the industrial discharge in China (< 100 mg/L COD, GB8978-1996). The ecological safety of Fenton process has also been evaluated. When reaction completed, the content of hydroxyl free radical (OH) was 3.26 +/- 0.44 mg/L. There was no inhibition of Fenton effluent in growth of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas putida, Pseudomonas sp. HF-1, Acinetobacter sp. TW and Sphingomonas sp. TY. No oxidative stress was induced on strain HF-1 by Fenton effluent. Thus, Fenton process was one of high-efficiency and ecologically safe strategy for tobacco wastewater advanced treatment.
TI  - The Crp regulator of Pseudomonas putida: evidence of an unusually high affinity for its physiological effector, cAMP.
AB  - Although the genome of Pseudomonas putida KT2440 encodes an orthologue of the crp gene of Escherichia coli (encoding the cAMP receptor protein), the regulatory scope of this factor seems to be predominantly co-opted in this bacterium for controlling non-metabolic functions. In order to investigate the reasons for such a functional divergence in otherwise nearly identical proteins, the Crp regulator of P. putida (Crp(P. putida)) was purified to apparent homogeneity and subject to a battery of in vitro assays aimed at determining its principal physicochemical properties. Analytical ultracentrifugation indicated effector-free Crp(P. putida) to be a dimer in solution that undergoes a significant change in its hydrodynamic shape in the presence of cAMP. Such a conformational transition was confirmed by limited proteolysis of the protein in the absence or presence of the inducer. Thermodynamic parameters calculated by isothermal titration calorimetry revealed a tight cAMP-Crp(P. putida) association with an apparent K(D) of 22.5 +/- 2.8 nM, i.e. much greater affinity than that reported for the E. coli's counterpart. The regulator also bound cGMP, but with a K(D) = 2.6 +/- 0.3 microM. An in vitro transcription system was then set up with purified P. putida's RNA polymerase for examining the preservation of the correct protein-protein architecture that makes Crp to activate target promoters. These results, along with cognate gel retardation assays indicated that all basic features of the reference Crp(E. coli) protein are kept in the P. putida's counterpart, albeit operating under a different set of parameters, the extraordinarily high affinity for cAMP being the most noticeable.
TI  - Production of 3-hydroxypropionate homopolymer and poly(3-hydroxypropionate-co-4-hydroxybutyrate) copolymer by recombinant Escherichia coli.
AB  - Conversion of 3-hydroxypropionate (3HP) from 1,3-propanediol (PDO) was improved by expressing dehydratase gene (dhaT) and aldehyde dehydrogenase gene (aldD) of Pseudomonas putida KT2442 under the promoter of phaCAB operon from Ralstonia eutropha H16. Expression of these genes in Aeromonas hydrophila 4AK4 produced up to 21 g/L 3HP in a fermentation process. To synthesize homopolymer poly(3-hydroxypropionate) (P3HP), and copolymer poly(3-hydroxypropionate-co-3-hydroxybutyrate) (P3HP4HB), dhaT and aldD were expressed in E. coli together with the phaC1 gene encoding polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) synthase gene of Ralstonia eutropha, and pcs' gene encoding the ACS domain of the tri-functional propionyl-CoA ligase (PCS) of Chloroflexus aurantiacus. Up to 92 wt% P3HP and 42 wt% P3HP4HB were produced by the recombinant Escherichia coli grown on PDO and a mixture of PDO+1,4-butanediol (BD), respectively.
TI  - Growth independent rhamnolipid production from glucose using the non-pathogenic Pseudomonas putida KT2440.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rhamnolipids are potent biosurfactants with high potential for industrial applications. However, rhamnolipids are currently produced with the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa during growth on hydrophobic substrates such as plant oils. The heterologous production of rhamnolipids entails two essential advantages: Disconnecting the rhamnolipid biosynthesis from the complex quorum sensing regulation and the opportunity of avoiding pathogenic production strains, in particular P. aeruginosa. In addition, separation of rhamnolipids from fatty acids is difficult and hence costly. RESULTS: Here, the metabolic engineering of a rhamnolipid producing Pseudomonas putida KT2440, a strain certified as safety strain using glucose as carbon source to avoid cumbersome product purification, is reported. Notably, P. putida KT2440 features almost no changes in growth rate and lag-phase in the presence of high concentrations of rhamnolipids (> 90 g/L) in contrast to the industrially important bacteria Bacillus subtilis, Corynebacterium glutamicum, and Escherichia coli. P. putida KT2440 expressing the rhlAB-genes from P. aeruginosa PAO1 produces mono-rhamnolipids of P. aeruginosa PAO1 type (mainly C(10):C(10)). The metabolic network was optimized in silico for rhamnolipid synthesis from glucose. In addition, a first genetic optimization, the removal of polyhydroxyalkanoate formation as competing pathway, was implemented. The final strain had production rates in the range of P. aeruginosa PAO1 at yields of about 0.15 g/g(glucose) corresponding to 32% of the theoretical optimum. What's more, rhamnolipid production was independent from biomass formation, a trait that can be exploited for high rhamnolipid production without high biomass formation. CONCLUSIONS: A functional alternative to the pathogenic rhamnolipid producer P. aeruginosa was constructed and characterized. P. putida KT24C1 pVLT31_rhlAB featured the highest yield and titer reported from heterologous rhamnolipid producers with glucose as carbon source. Notably, rhamnolipid production was uncoupled from biomass formation, which allows optimal distribution of resources towards rhamnolipid synthesis. The results are discussed in the context of rational strain engineering by using the concepts of synthetic biology like chassis cells and orthogonality, thereby avoiding the complex regulatory programs of rhamnolipid production existing in the natural producer P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Characterization of the chipsi subcomplex of Pseudomonas aeruginosa DNA polymerase III.
AB  - BACKGROUND: DNA polymerase III, the main enzyme responsible for bacterial DNA replication, is composed of three sub-assemblies: the polymerase core, the beta-sliding clamp, and the clamp loader. During replication, single-stranded DNA-binding protein (SSB) coats and protects single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and also interacts with the chipsi heterodimer, a sub-complex of the clamp loader. Whereas the chi subunits of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are about 40% homologous, P. aeruginosa psi is twice as large as its E. coli counterpart, and contains additional sequences. It was shown that P. aeruginosa chipsi together with SSB increases the activity of its cognate clamp loader 25-fold at low salt. The E. coli clamp loader, however, is insensitive to the addition of its cognate chipsi under similar conditions. In order to find out distinguishing properties within P. aeruginosa chipsi which account for this higher stimulatory effect, we characterized P. aeruginosa chipsi by a detailed structural and functional comparison with its E. coli counterpart. RESULTS: Using small-angle X-ray scattering, analytical ultracentrifugation, and homology-based modeling, we found the N-terminus of P. aeruginosa psi to be unstructured. Under high salt conditions, the affinity of the chipsi complexes from both organisms to their cognate SSB was similar. Under low salt conditions, P. aeruginosa chipsi, contrary to E. coli chipsi, binds to ssDNA via the N-terminus of psi. Whereas it is also able to bind to double-stranded DNA, the affinity is somewhat reduced. CONCLUSIONS: The binding to DNA, otherwise never reported for any other psi protein, enhances the affinity of P. aeruginosa chipsi towards the SSB/ssDNA complex and very likely contributes to the higher stimulatory effect of P. aeruginosa chipsi on the clamp loader. We also observed DNA-binding activity for P. putida chipsi, making this activity most probably a characteristic of the psi proteins from the Pseudomonadaceae.
TI  - Cloning and characterization of a bifunctional glycosyl hydrolase from an antagonistic Pseudomonas putida strain P3(4).
AB  - A fluorescent pseudomonad strain P3(4) showing chitinolysis on chitinase detection agar and antagonism against Fusarium oxysporum f.sp dianthi causing vascular wilt of carnation was isolated from pea rhizosphere soil. PCR primers specific for glycosyl hydrolase family 5 (GH5) of Pseudomonas putida isolate KT2440 amplified a 947 bp fragment of the GH5 gene from P3(4). Cloning of this gene into Escherichia coli M15 using an expression vector pQE-30UA and screening on chitin and chitosan detection agar identified one positive clone (Pchi(+) ). Sequence analysis of the cloned insert revealed an open reading frame of 947 nucleotides corresponding to a protein of 315 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 38.0 kDa. The deduced amino acid sequence of the open reading frame (gene product/GH) showed 83-84% homology to the GH5 of P. putida strains F1 and KT2440, respectively. The purified enzyme was homogenous, as examined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and was visualized as single fluorescent band in native gel assay with 4-methylumbelliferyl-N -acetyl-beta;-D-glucosaminide and glycol chitosan, respectively. For hydrolysis of 4-nitrophenyl-N -acetyl-beta;-D-glucosaminide (pNP-(GlcNAc) and colloidal chitosan, the enzyme had an optimal temperature of 40 degrees C, and was stable within the temperature range of 10 degrees C to 40 degrees C. The enzyme showed an optimal pH of 3.5, with maximum stabilities at 5.0 and 5.5 for hydrolysis of pNP-(GlcNAc) and colloidal chitosan, respectively. Fe(3+) and Cu(2+) stimulated chitinase and chitosanase activities by 74.2 and 51.4%, respectively. The purified GH displayed 70 and 45% inhibition of spore germination of the pathogenic fungi, Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. dianthi and Alternaria solani, respectively.
TI  - An efficient design strategy for a whole-cell biosensor based on engineered ribosome binding sequences.
AB  - In prokaryotes, the ribosome binding sequence (RBS), located in the 5' untranslated region (5' UTR) of an mRNA, plays a critical role in enhancing mRNA translation and stability. To evaluate the effect of the RBS on the sensitivity and signal intensity of an environmental whole-cell biosensor, three Escherichia coli-based biosensors that respond to benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and the xylenes (BTEX) were constructed; the three biosensors have the same Pu promoter and xylR regulator from the Pseudomonas putida TOL plasmid but differ in the engineered RBS in their reporter genes. The results from time and dose-dependent induction of luminescence activity by 2-chlorotoluene showed that the BTEX-SE and BTEX-SD biosensors with engineered RBS had signal intensities approximately 10-35 times higher than the primary BTEX-W biosensor. The limits of detection (LOD) of the BTEX-SE and BTEX-SD biosensors were also significantly lower than the LOD of the BTEX-W biosensor (20 +/- 5 mumol L(-1) and 25 +/- 5 mumol L(-1) vs. 120 +/- 10 mumol L(-1)). Moreover, the BTEX-SE and BTEX-SD biosensors responded three times more rapidly to the analytes. These results suggest that rationally designed RBS in the 5' UTR of a reporter gene may be a promising strategy for increasing the sensitivity, signal intensity, and response speed of whole-cell biosensors.
TI  - Anti-quorum sensing activity of essential oils from Colombian plants.
AB  - Essential oils from Colombian plants were characterised by GC-MS, and assayed for anti-quorum sensing activity in bacteria sensor strains. Two major chemotypes were found for Lippia alba, the limonene-carvone and the citral (geranial-neral). For other species, the main components included alpha-pinene (Ocotea sp.), beta-pinene (Swinglea glutinosa), cineol (Elettaria cardamomun), alpha-zingiberene (Zingiber officinale) and pulegone (Minthostachys mollis). Several essential oils presented promising inhibitory properties for the short chain AHL quorum sensing (QS) system, in Escherichia coli containing the biosensor plasmid pJBA132, in particular Lippia alba. Moderate activity as anti-QS using the same plasmid, were also found for selected constituents of essential oils studied here, such as citral, carvone and alpha-pinene, although solely at the highest tested concentration (250 microg mL(-1)). Only citral presented some activity for the long chain AHL QS system, in Pseudomonas putida containing the plasmid pRK-C12. In short, essential oils from Colombian flora have promising properties as QS modulators.
TI  - Fluorescent DNA chemosensors: identification of bacterial species by their volatile metabolites.
AB  - Polyfluorophores built on a DNA scaffold (ODFs) were synthesized and tested for fluorescence responses to the volatiles from M. tuberculosis, E. coli and P. putida in closed Petri dishes. Two sensors in a pattern-based response could distinguish the bacterial strains accurately, suggesting the use of ODFs in rapid identification of infectious agents.
TI  - Synergistic action of azoreductase and laccase leads to maximal decolourization and detoxification of model dye-containing wastewaters.
AB  - The azoreductase PpAzoR from Pseudomonas putida shows a broader specificity for decolourization of azo dyes than CotA-laccase from Bacillus subtilis. However, the final products of PpAzoR activity exhibited in most cases a 2 to 3-fold higher toxicity than intact dyes themselves. We show that addition of CotA-laccase to PpAzoR reaction mixtures lead to a significant drop in the final toxicity. A sequential enzymatic process was validated through the use of 18 representative azo dyes and three model wastewaters that mimic real dye-containing effluents. A heterologous Escherichia coli strain was successfully constructed co-expressing the genes coding for both PpAzoR and CotA. Whole-cell assays of recombinant strain for the treatment of model dye wastewater resulted in decolourization levels above 80% and detoxification levels up to 50%. The high attributes of this strain, make it a promising candidate for the biological treatment of industrial dye containing effluents.
TI  - Optimization of fixation methods for observation of bacterial cell morphology and surface ultrastructures by atomic force microscopy.
AB  - Fixation ability of five common fixation solutions, including 2.5% glutaraldehyde, 10% formalin, 4% paraformaldehyde, methanol/acetone (1:1), and ethanol/acetic acid (3:1) were evaluated by using atomic force microscopy in the present study. Three model bacteria, i.e., Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas putida, and Bacillus subtilis were applied to observe the above fixation methods for the morphology preservation of bacterial cells and surface ultrastructures. All the fixation methods could effectively preserve cell morphology. However, for preserving bacterial surface ultrastructures, the methods applying aldehyde fixations performed much better than those using alcohols, since the alcohols could detach the surface filaments (i.e., flagella and pili) significantly. Based on the quantitative and qualitative assessments, the 2.5% glutaraldehyde was proposed as a promising fixation solution both for observing morphology of both bacterial cell and surface ultrastructures, while the methonal/acetone mixture was the worst fixation solution which may obtain unreliable results.
TI  - The potential for reductive mobilization of arsenic [As(V) to As(III)] by OSBH(2) (Pseudomonas stutzeri) and OSBH(5) (Bacillus cereus) in an oil-contaminated site.
AB  - Microbial reduction of arsenate [As(V)] plays an important role in arsenic (As) mobilization in aqueous environments. In this study, we investigated reduction of arsenate by different bacterial isolates such as OSBH(1) (GU329913), OSBH(2) (GU329914), OSBH(3) (GU329915), OSBH(4) (GU329916) and OSBH(5) (GU329917), isolated from the oil sludge of a sewage treatment plant operated by the China Petroleum Refinery Company in Kaohsiung, southern Taiwan. Bacterial strains of pure culture were identified by 16S rRNA analysis (>/=99 % nucleotide similarity). Morphological and 16S rRNA analysis show that the isolate OSBH(1) is similar to E. coli, OSBH(2) is similar to P. stutzeri, OSBH(3) is similar to P. putida, OSBH(4) is similar to P. aeruginosa, and OSBH(5) is similar to B. Cereus. The As(V) was transformed to As(III) in the presence of isolates OSBH(2) and OSBH(5) by a detoxification process. The potential reduction rates of As(V) were higher in the presence of isolate OSBH(5) compared to the isolate OSBH(2). The microbial growth (cell/mL) of isolate OSBH(5) was significantly higher in culture medium compared to OSBH(2). The bacterial isolates such as OSBH(1), OSBH(3) and OSBH(4) were found to be incapable of transforming the As(V). It is concluded that the activity of the oil-degrading bacterial isolates described in this work contributes to the mobilization of As in the more toxic As(III) form that affects biotic life.
TI  - Comparison of microbial hosts and expression systems for mammalian CYP1A1 catalysis.
AB  - Mammalian cytochrome P450 enzymes are of special interest as biocatalysts for fine chemical and drug metabolite synthesis. In this study, the potential of different recombinant microorganisms expressing rat and human cyp1a1 genes is evaluated for such applications. The maximum specific activity for 7-ethoxyresorufin O-deethylation and gene expression levels were used as parameters to judge biocatalyst performance. Under comparable conditions, E. coli is shown to be superior over the use of S. cerevisiae and P. putida as hosts for biocatalysis. Of all tested E. coli strains, E. coli DH5alpha and E. coli JM101 harboring rat CYP1A1 showed the highest activities (0.43 and 0.42 U g(-)(1)(CDW), respectively). Detection of active CYP1A1 in cell-free E. coli extracts was found to be difficult and only for E. coli DH5alpha, expression levels could be determined (41 nmol g(-)(1)(CDW)). The presented results show that efficient expression of mammalian cyp1a1 genes in recombinant microorganisms is troublesome and host-dependent and that enhancing expression levels is crucial in order to obtain more efficient biocatalysts. Specific activities currently obtained are not sufficient yet for fine chemical production, but are sufficient for preparative-scale drug metabolite synthesis.
TI  - Impacts of gene bioaugmentation with pJP4-harboring bacteria of 2,4-D-contaminated soil slurry on the indigenous microbial community.
AB  - Gene bioaugmentation is a bioremediation strategy that enhances biodegradative potential via dissemination of degradative genes from introduced microorganisms to indigenous microorganisms. Bioremediation experiments using 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D)-contaminated soil slurry and strains of Pseudomonas putida or Escherichia coli harboring a self-transmissible 2,4-D degradative plasmid pJP4 were conducted in microcosms to assess possible effects of gene bioaugmentation on the overall microbial community structure and ecological functions (carbon source utilization and nitrogen transformation potentials). Although exogenous bacteria decreased rapidly, 2,4-D degradation was stimulated in bioaugmented microcosms, possibly because of the occurrence of transconjugants by the transfer of pJP4. Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis revealed that, although the bacterial community structure was disturbed immediately after introducing exogenous bacteria to the inoculated microcosms, it gradually approached that of the uninoculated microcosms. Biolog assay, nitrate reduction assay, and monitoring of the amoA gene of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria and nirK and nirS genes of denitrifying bacteria showed no irretrievable depressive effects of gene bioaugmentation on the carbon source utilization and nitrogen transformation potentials. These results may suggest that gene bioaugmentation with P. putida and E. coli strains harboring pJP4 is effective for the degradation of 2,4-D in soil without large impacts on the indigenous microbial community.
TI  - Detection of genetically modified microorganisms in soil using the most-probable-number method with multiplex PCR and DNA dot blot.
AB  - The principal objective of this study was to detect genetically modified microorganisms (GMMs) that might be accidentally released into the environment from laboratories. Two methods [plate counting and most-probable-number (MPN)] coupled with either multiplex PCR or DNA dot blots were compared using genetically modified Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas putida, and Acinetobacter oleivorans harboring an antibiotic-resistance gene with additional gfp and lacZ genes as markers. Alignments of sequences collected from databases using the Perl scripting language (Perl API) and from denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis revealed that the gfp, lacZ and antibiotic-resistance genes (kanamycin, tetracycline, and ampicillin) in GMMs differed from the counterpart genes in many sequenced genomes and in soil DNA. Thus, specific multiplex PCR primer sets for detection of plasmid-based gfp and lacZ antibiotic-resistance genes could be generated. In the plate counting method, many antibiotic-resistant bacteria from a soil microcosm grew as colonies on antibiotic-containing agar plates. The multiplex PCR verification of randomly selected antibiotic-resistant colonies with specific primers proved ineffective. The MPN-multiplex PCR method and antibiotic-resistant phenotype could be successfully used to detect GMMs, although this method is quite laborious. The MPN-DNA dot blot method screened more cells at a time in a microtiter plate containing the corresponding antibiotics, and was shown to be a more efficient method for the detection of GMMs in soil using specific probes in terms of labor and accuracy.
TI  - Kinetic, crystallographic, and mechanistic characterization of TomN: elucidation  of a function for a 4-oxalocrotonate tautomerase homologue in the tomaymycin biosynthetic pathway.
AB  - The biosynthesis of the C ring of the antitumor antibiotic agent, tomaymycin, is  proposed to proceed through five enzyme-catalyzed steps from l-tyrosine. The genes encoding these enzymes have recently been cloned and their functions tentatively assigned, but there is limited biochemical evidence supporting the assignments of the last three steps. One enzyme, TomN, shows 58% pairwise sequence similarity with 4-oxalocrotonate tautomerase (4-OT), an enzyme found in a catabolic pathway for aromatic hydrocarbons. The TomN sequence includes three amino acids (Pro-1, Arg-11, and Arg-39) that have been identified as critical catalytic residues in 4-OT. However, the proposed substrate for TomN is very different from that processed by 4-OT. To establish the function and mechanism of TomN and its relationship with 4-OT, we conducted kinetic, mutagenic, and structural studies. The kinetic parameters for TomN, and four alanine mutants, P1A, R11A, R39A, and R61A, were determined using 2-hydroxymuconate, the substrate for 4-OT. The TomN-catalyzed reaction using this substrate compares favorably to that of 4-OT. In addition, the kinetic parameters for the P1A, R11A, and R39A mutants of TomN parallel the trends observed for the corresponding 4-OT mutants, implicating an analogous mechanism. A high-resolution crystal structure (1.4 A) of TomN shows that the overall structure and the active site region are highly similar to those of 4-OT with a root-mean-square deviation of 0.81 A. Moreover, key active site residues are positionally conserved. The combined results suggest that the tentative assignment for TomN and the proposed sequence of events in the biosynthetic pathway leading to the formation of the C ring of tomaymycin might not be correct. An alternative pathway that awaits biochemical confirmation is proposed.
TI  - Response of Pseudomonas putida KT2440 to increased NADH and ATP demand.
AB  - Adenosine phosphate and NAD cofactors play a vital role in the operation of cell  metabolism, and their levels and ratios are carefully regulated in tight ranges. Perturbations of the consumption of these metabolites might have a great impact on cell metabolism and physiology. Here, we investigated the impact of increased ATP hydrolysis and NADH oxidation rates on the metabolism of Pseudomonas putida KT2440 by titration of 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP) and overproduction of a water-forming NADH oxidase, respectively. Both perturbations resulted in a reduction of the biomass yield and, as a consequence of the uncoupling of catabolic and anabolic activities, in an amplification of the net NADH regeneration rate. However, a stimulation of the specific carbon uptake rate was observed only when P. putida was challenged with very high 2,4-dinitrophenol concentrations and was comparatively unaffected by recombinant NADH oxidase activity. This behavior contrasts with the comparably sensitive performance described, for example, for Escherichia coli or Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The apparent robustness of P. putida metabolism indicates that it possesses a certain buffering capacity and a high flexibility to adapt to and counteract different stresses without showing a distinct phenotype. These findings are important, e.g., for the development of whole-cell redox biocatalytic processes that impose equivalent burdens on the cell metabolism: stoichiometric consumption of (reduced) redox cofactors and increased energy expenditures, due to the toxicity of the biocatalytic compounds.
TI  - Development of a simple method for biotoxicity measurement using ultramicroelectrode array under non-deaerated condition.
AB  - In this paper, a mediated method by using ferricyanide under non-deaerated condition for biotoxicity measurement was proposed. Ultramicroelectrode array (UMEA) was employed for effectively amplify the electrochemical signal from the total limiting currents to distinguish a little change in toxicity. Five species of microorganisms including two bacilli (Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae), two pseudomonas (Pseudomonas fluorescens and Pseucomonas putida) and one fungus (Trichosporon cutaneum) were employed. 3,5-dichlorophenol (DCP) was taken as the reference toxicant. The IC50 values we obtained were similar with the values obtained using in the deaerated method. E. coli was used as model test microorganism. The final concentration of ferricyanide is 45 mM, E. coli OD600 8 and 1 h incubation were taken in optimum conditions in this study. Four heavy metal ions (Cr(6+), Hg(2+), Cd(2+) and Bi(3+)) were examined under the optimum conditions. Comparison with the results reported previously has confirmed that this method provided a simple and rapid alternative to toxicity screening of chemicals, especially advantageous for in situ monitoring of water system.
TI  - Pseudomonas putida esterase contains a GGG(A)X-motif confering activity for the kinetic resolution of tertiary alcohols.
AB  - An esterase from Pseudomonas putida JD1 (PPE) was successfully cloned, actively expressed in Escherichia coli, and characterized. It was discovered that PPE is more active towards short-chain esters, hydrolyzed delta-valerolactone, and epsilon-caprolactone and was most active at 37 degrees C and pH 8. After purification to homogeneity by Ni-NTA-assisted affinity chromatography, the kinetic parameters K(M) and k(cat) were determined for p-nitrophenyl acetate and butyrate, respectively, showing better catalytic efficiency for hydrolysis of the acetate residue. Investigation of the protein sequence revealed not only the classical catalytic triad for carboxylesterases, additionally the interesting GGG(A)X-motif, which is associated to activity towards tertiary alcohols, was found. Indeed, enzymatic activity was shown for a set of different tertiary alcohols with enantioselectivities up to E = 20, suggesting PPE to be a promising biocatalyst. In addition, PPE also hydrolyzed 4-hydroxyphenyl acetate, the product of a Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenase-catalyzed oxidation of 4-hydroxyacetophenone with a specific activity of 34.36 U/mg suggesting a physiological role in P. putida JD1.
TI  - Engineering of 2-Cys peroxiredoxin for enhanced stress-tolerance.
AB  - A typical 2-cysteine peroxiredoxin (2-Cys Prx)-like protein (PpPrx) that alternatively acts as a peroxidase or a molecular chaperone in Pseudomonas putida KT2440 was previously characterized. The dual functions of PpPrx are regulated by the existence of an additional Cys(112) between the active Cys(51) and Cys(171) residues. In the present study, additional Cys residues (Cys(31), Cys(112), and Cys(192)) were added to PpPrx variants to improve their enzymatic function. The optimal position of the additional Cys residues for the dual functionality was assessed. The peroxidase activities of the S31C and Y192C mutants were increased 3- to 4-fold compared to the wild-type, while the chaperone activity was maintained at > 66% of PpPrx. To investigate whether optimization of the dual functions could enhance stress-tolerance in vivo, a complementation study was performed. The S31C and Y192C mutants showed a much greater tolerance than other variants under a complex condition of heat and oxidative stresses. The optimized dual functions of PpPrx could be adapted for use in bioengineering systems and industries, such as to develop organisms that are more resistant to extreme environments.
TI  - Involvement of specialized DNA polymerases Pol II, Pol IV and DnaE2 in DNA replication in the absence of Pol I in Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - The majority of bacteria possess a different set of specialized DNA polymerases than those identified in the most common model organism Escherichia coli. Here, we have studied the ability of specialized DNA polymerases to substitute Pol I in DNA replication in Pseudomonas putida. Our results revealed that P. putida Pol I-deficient cells have severe growth defects in LB medium, which is accompanied by filamentous cell morphology. However, growth of Pol I-deficient bacteria on solid rich medium can be restored by reduction of reactive oxygen species in cells. Also, mutants with improved growth emerge rapidly. Similarly to the initial Pol I-deficient P. putida, its adapted derivatives express a moderate mutator phenotype, which indicates that DNA replication carried out in the absence of Pol I is erroneous both in the original Pol I-deficient bacteria and the adapted derivatives. Analysis of the spectra of spontaneous Rif(r) mutations in P. putida strains lacking different DNA polymerases revealed that the presence of specialized DNA polymerases Pol II and Pol IV influences the frequency of certain base substitutions in Pol I-proficient and Pol I-deficient backgrounds in opposite ways. Involvement of another specialized DNA polymerase DnaE2 in DNA replication in Pol I-deficient bacteria is stimulated by UV irradiation of bacteria, implying that DnaE2-provided translesion synthesis partially substitutes the absence of Pol I in cells containing heavily damaged DNA.
TI  - Initial bacterial attachment in slow flowing systems: effects of cell and substrate surface properties.
AB  - Bacterial biofilm can have significant effects on the behaviors and/or performance of natural and man-made systems. Understanding the factors governing initial bacterial attachment is critical to biofilm management. In this study, the initial attachment of three bacteria, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida, on two substrates, glass and octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) modified glass, was examined in flow chambers. The flow chambers were designed and operated to mimic slow moving water bodies and minimize the gravitational settlement of cells. The hydrophobicity of bacterial surface was evaluated by partitioning of cells to the water-hexadecane interface and the liquid contact angles on cell layers collected on filter papers. On the more hydrophilic glass surface, the attachment trend was found to be E. coli>P. putida>P. aeruginosa, while the opposite trend was observed on the hydrophobic, OTS modified surface. The attachment trend on glass could be explained by the magnitude of the negative interaction energy at secondary minima, as predicted by the extended Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (XDLVO) theory. The much higher attachments of P. aeruginosa and P. putida on the OTS-modified substrate, on the other hand, suggested that these cells could overcome the energy barrier between the primary and secondary minima of interaction energy to become attached to the primary minimum. The extent of primary-minimum attachment appeared to correlate with the scale of the energy barrier, with higher attachments in the bacteria-substrate combinations of lower energy barriers. The study generated important insights into the effects of cell and substrate surface properties on initial bacterial attachment.
TI  - Response surface methodology of nitrilase production by recombinant Escherichia coli.
AB  - Growth and nitrilase production by recombinant Escherichia coli cells harbouring  pET 21 (b) plasmid, for the expression of Pseudomonas putida nitrilase were improved using response surface methodology. Central composite design was used for obtaining ideal concentration of critical medium components which include fructose, tryptone, yeast extract and lactose. The optimal values for the concentration of fructose, tryptone, yeast extract and lactose were found to be 1.13, 2.26, 3.25 and 0.9 % (w/v), respectively. Here, fructose served as carbon source for the growth while lactose was preferably used as inducer for the expression of foreign protein. Yeast extract in the medium was used as a growth promoter while tryptone was added as a major nitrogen source. Using this optimized medium, an experimental growth of 6.67 (OD at 600 nm) and nitrilase activity of 27.13 U/ml was achieved. This approach for medium development led to an enhancement of the growth and enzyme activity by 1.4 and 2.2 times, respectively, as compared to the un-optimized medium.
TI  - Molecular determinants of azo reduction activity in the strain Pseudomonas putida MET94.
AB  - Azo dyes are the major group of synthetic colourants used in industry and are serious environmental pollutants. In this study, Pseudomonas putida MET94 was selected from 48 bacterial strains on the basis of its superior ability to degrade a wide range of structurally diverse azo dyes. P. putida is a versatile microorganism with a well-recognised potential for biodegradation or bioremediation applications. P. putida MET94 removes, in 24 h and under anaerobic growing conditions, more than 80% of the majority of the structurally diverse azo dyes tested. Whole cell assays performed under anaerobic conditions revealed up to 90% decolourisation in dye wastewater bath models. The involvement of a FMN dependent NADPH: dye oxidoreductase in the decolourisation process was suggested by enzymatic measurements in cell crude extracts. The gene encoding a putative azoreductase was cloned from P. putida MET94 and expressed in Escherichia coli. The purified P. putida azoreductase is a 40 kDa homodimer with broad substrate specificity for azo dye reduction. The presence of dioxygen leads to the inhibition of the decolourisation activity in agreement with the results of cell cultures. The kinetic mechanism follows a ping-pong bi-bi reaction scheme and aromatic amine products were detected in stoichiometric amounts by high-performance liquid chromatography. Overall, the results indicate that P. putida MET94 is a promising candidate for bioengineering studies aimed at generating more effective dye-reducing strains.
TI  - Microbial biosensors for organophosphate pesticides.
AB  - Organophosphates, amongst the most toxic substance known, are used widely in agriculture around the world. Their extensive use, however, has resulted in their occurrence in the water and food supply threatening humans and animals. Therefore, there is a need for determination of these neurotoxic compounds sensitively, selectively, and rapidly in the field. The present work is a brief review on the recent advancements in amperometric, potentiometric, and optical biosensors using genetically engineered microorganisms expressing organophosphate hydrolyzing enzyme intracellularly or anchored on the cell surface for the detection of organophosphate pesticides. The benefits and limitations associated with such microbial biosensors are delineated.
TI  - An improved procedure for the purification of catalytically active alkane hydroxylase from Pseudomonas putida GPo1.
AB  - Bacterial alkane hydroxylases are of high interest for bioremediation applications as they allow some bacteria to grow in oil-contaminated environments. Furthermore, they have tremendous biotechnological potential as they catalyse the stereo- and regio-specific hydroxylation of chemically inert alkanes, which can then be used in the synthesis of pharmaceuticals and other high-cost chemicals. Despite their potential, progress on the detailed characterization of these systems has so far been slow mainly due to the lack of a robust procedure to purify its membrane protein component, monooxygenase AlkB, in a stable and active form. This study reports a new method for isolating milligramme amounts of recombinant Pseudomonas putida GPo1 AlkB in a folded, catalytically active form to purity levels above 90%. AlkB solubilised and purified in the detergent lauryldimethylamine oxide was demonstrated to be active in catalysing the epoxidation reaction of 1-octene with an estimated K (m) value of 0.2 mM.
TI  - Identification of camphor oxidation and reduction products in Pseudomonas putida: new activity of the cytochrome P450cam system.
AB  - P450 enzymes are known for catalyzing hydroxylation reactions of non-activated C-H bonds. For example, P450(cam) from Pseudomonas putida oxidizes (1R)-(+)-camphor to 5-exo-hydroxy camphor and further to 5-ketocamphor. This hydroxylation reaction proceeds via a catalytic cycle in which the reduction of dioxygen (O(2)) is coupled to the oxidation of the substrate. We have observed that under conditions of low oxygen, P. putida and isolated P450(cam) reduce camphor to borneol. We characterized the formation of borneol under conditions of low oxygen or when the catalytic cycle is shunted by artificial oxidants like m-chloro perbenzoic acid, cumene hydroperoxide, etc. We also tested the toxicity of camphor and borneol with P. putida and Escherichia coli. We have found that in P. putida borneol is less toxic than camphor, whereas in E. coli borneol is more toxic than camphor. We discuss a potental ecological advantage of the camphor reduction reaction for P. putida.
TI  - Cyclic diguanylate turnover mediated by the sole GGDEF/EAL response regulator in  Pseudomonas putida: its role in the rhizosphere and an analysis of its target processes.
AB  - GGDEF and EAL/HD-GYP protein domains are responsible for the synthesis and hydrolysis of the bacterial secondary messenger cyclic diguanylate (c-di-GMP) through their diguanylate cyclase and phosphodiesterase activities, respectively. Forty-three genes in Pseudomonas putida KT2440 are putatively involved in the turnover of c-di-GMP. Of them only rup4959 (locus PP4959) encodes a GGDEF/EAL response regulator, which was identified in a genome wide analysis as preferentially induced while this bacterium colonizes roots and adjacent soil areas (the rhizosphere). By using fusions to reporter genes it was confirmed that the rup4959 promoter is active in the rhizosphere and inducible by corn plant root exudates and microaerobiosis. Transcription of rup4959 was strictly dependent on the alternative transcriptional factor sigma(S) . The inactivation of the rup4959-4957 operon altered the expression of 22 genes in the rhizosphere and had a negative effect upon oligopeptide utilization and biofilm formation. In multicopy or when overexpressed, rup4959 enhanced adhesin LapA-dependent biofilm formation, the development of wrinkly colony morphology, and increased Calcofluor stainable exopolysaccharides (EPS). Under these conditions the inhibition of swarming motility was total and plant root tip colonization considerably less efficient, whereas swimming was partially diminished. This pleiotropic phenotype, which correlated with an increase in the global level of c-di-GMP, was not acquired with increased levels of Rup4959 catalytic mutant at GGDEF as a proof of this response regulator exhibiting diguanylate cyclase activity. A screen for mutants in putative targets of c-di-GMP led to the identification of a surface polysaccharide specific to KT2440, which is encoded by the genes cluster PP3133-PP3141, as essential for phenotypes associated with increased c-di-GMP. Cellulose and alginate were discarded as the overproduced EPS, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) core and O-antigen were found to be essential for the development of wrinkly colony morphology.
TI  - Cell-based biosensor for measurement of phenol and nitrophenols toxicity.
AB  - A cost-effective whole cell biosensor based on electrochemical technique to detect toxicities of phenol and nitrophenols has been developed. This method relied on the inhibition effect for respiratory chain activity of microorganism by toxicant, which was measured by chronoamperometry using mediator (ferricyanide). The current signals produced by suspended microorganisms and reoxidation of ferrocyanide were transformed to inhibiting efficiency directly, and 50% inhibiting concentration (IC(50)) was chosen as the quantitative standard of toxicity. The test microorganisms used here consist of three bacilli (Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae and Alcaligenes faecalis), two pseudomonas (Pseudomonas fluorescens and Pseucomonas putida) and one fungus (Trichosporon cutaneum). 3,5-Dichlorophenol (DCP) was taken as the reference toxicant. The results showed that the microorganisms which belong to the same bacterial family had similar trends of inhibitions on respiratory activity and similar IC50 values. By comparing the IC(50) values, P. fluorescens was the most sensitive one to DCP toxicity, its IC(50) was estimated to be 4.2mg/L. pH 7.0 and together with the standard glucose-glutamic acid (GGA) as an exogenous material were taken for optimum conditions in this study. Here, P. fluorescens as model test microorganism was employed to assess toxicities of phenol and nitrophenols under the optimum conditions. IC(50) values of 291.4 mg/L for phenol, 64.1mg/L for 2-NP, 71.4 mg/L for 3-NP and 14.0mg/L for 4-NP were determined at 60 min, respectively. Comparison with the results of published data has confirmed that this cell biosensor is a sensitive and rapid alternative to toxicity screening of chemicals.
TI  - Rapid and flexible biochemical assays for evaluating 4'-phosphopantetheinyl transferase activity.
AB  - PPTases (phosphopantetheinyl transferases) are of great interest owing to their essential roles in activating fatty acid, polyketide and non-ribosomal peptide synthetase enzymes for both primary and secondary metabolism, as well as an increasing number of biotechnological applications. However, existing techniques for PPTase characterization and development are cumbersome and technically challenging. To address this, we have developed the indigoidine-synthesizing non-ribosomal peptide synthetase BpsA as a reporter for PPTase activity. Simple co-transformation allows rapid assessment of the ability of a PPTase candidate to activate BpsA in vivo. Kinetic parameters with respect to either CoA or BpsA as variable substrate can then be derived in vitro by continuously measuring the rate of indigoidine synthesis as the PPTase progressively converts BpsA from its apo into holo form. Subsequently, a competition assay, in which BpsA and purified carrier proteins compete for a limited pool of CoA, enables elucidation of kinetic parameters for a PPTase with those carrier proteins. We used this system to conduct a rapid characterization of three different PPTase enzymes: Sfp of Bacillus subtilis A.T.C.C.6633, PcpS of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1, and the putative PPTase PP1183 of Ps. putida KT2440. We also demonstrate the utility of this system for discovery and characterization of PPTase inhibitors.
TI  - Idling time of motile bacteria contributes to retardation and dispersion in sand  porous medium.
AB  - The motility of microorganisms affects their transport in natural systems by altering their interactions with the solid phase of the soil matrix. To assess the effect of these interactions on transport parameters, a series of breakthrough curves (BTCs) for motile and nonmotile bacteria, including E. coli and P. putida species, were measured from a homogeneously packed sand column under three different interstitial velocities of 1 m/d, 5 m/d, and 10 m/d. BTCs for the nonmotile bacteria were nearly identical for all three flow rates, except that the recovery percentage at 1 m/d was reduced by 5% compared to the higher flow rates. In contrast, for the motile bacteria, the recovery percentages were not affected by flow rate, but their BTCs exhibited a higher degree of retardation and dispersion as the flow velocity decreased, which was consistent with increased idling times of the motile strains. The smooth-swimming mutant E. coli HCB437, which is unable to change its swimming direction after encountering the solid surfaces and thus has the largest idling time, also exhibited the greatest degree of retardation and dispersion. All of the experimental observations were compared to results from an advection-dispersion transport model with three fitting parameters: retardation factor (R), longitudinal dispersivity (alpha(L)), and attachment rate coefficient (k(att)). In addition, the single-collector efficiency (eta(0)) and collision efficiency (alpha) were calculated according to the colloid filtration theory (CFT), and confirmed that motile bacteria had lower collision efficiencies than nonmotile bacteria. This is consistent with previously reported observations that motile bacteria can avoid attachment to a solid surface by their active swimming capabilities. By quantifying the effect of bacterial motility on various transport parameters, more robust fate and transport models can be developed for decision-making related to environmental remediation strategies and risk assessment.
TI  - Efficient production of soluble recombinant single chain Fv fragments by a Pseudomonas putida strain KT2440 cell factory.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recombinant antibody fragments have a wide range of applications in research, diagnostics and therapy. For many of these, small fragments like single chain fragment variables (scFv) function well and can be produced inexpensively in bacterial expression systems. Although Escherichia coli K-12 production systems are convenient, yields of different fragments, even those produced from codon-optimized expression systems, vary significantly. Where yields are inadequate, alternative production systems are needed. Pseudomonas putida strain KT2440 is a versatile biosafety strain known for good expression of heterologous genes, so we have explored its utility as a cell factory for production of scFvs. RESULTS: We have generated new broad host range scFv expression constructs and assessed their production in the Pseudomonas putida KT2440 host. Two scFvs bind either to human C-reactive protein or to mucin1, proteins of significant medical diagnostic and therapeutic interest, whereas a third is a model anti-lysozyme scFv. The KT2440 antibody expression systems produce scFvs targeted to the periplasmic space that were processed precisely and were easily recovered and purified by single-step or tandem affinity chromatography. The influence of promoter system, codon optimization for P. putida, and medium on scFv yield was examined. Yields of up to 3.5 mg/l of pure, soluble, active scFv fragments were obtained from shake flask cultures of constructs based on the original codon usage and expressed from the Ptac expression system, yields that were 2.5-4 times higher than those from equivalent cultures of an E. coli K-12 expression host. CONCLUSIONS: Pseudomonas putida KT2440 is a good cell factory for the production of scFvs, and the broad host range constructs we have produced allow yield assessment in a number of different expression hosts when yields in one initially selected are insufficient. High cell density cultivation and further optimization and refinement of the KT2440 cell factory will achieve additional increases in the yields of scFvs.
TI  - Expression and characterization of (R)-specific enoyl coenzyme A hydratases making a channeling route to polyhydroxyalkanoate biosynthesis in Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - We investigated the expression of (R)-specific enoyl coenzyme A hydratase (PhaJ)  in Pseudomonas putida KT2440 accumulating polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) from sodium octanoate in order to identify biosynthesis pathways of PHAs from fatty acids in pseudomonads. From a database search through the P. putida KT2440 genome, an additional phaJ gene homologous to phaJ4(Pa) from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, termed phaJ4(Pp), was identified. The gene products of phaJ1(Pp), which was identified previously, and phaJ4(Pp) were confirmed to be functional in recombinant Escherichia coli on PHA synthesis from sodium dodecanoate. Cytosolic proteins from P. putida grown on sodium octanoate were subjected to anion exchange chromatography and one of the eluted fractions with hydratase activity included PhaJ4(Pp), as revealed by western blot analysis. These results strongly suggest that PhaJ4(Pp) forms a channeling route from beta-oxidation to PHA biosynthesis in P. putida. Moreover, the substrate specificity of PhaJ1(Pp) was suggested to be different from that of PhaJ1(Pa) from P. aeruginosa although these two proteins share 67% amino acid sequence identity.
TI  - Integrative, xylE-based promoter probe vectors for use in Streptomyces.
AB  - Two promoter probe plasmid vectors, designated pIPP1 and pIPP2, were constructed  from the existing plasmids pXE4 and pSET152. pIPP1 and 2 use the xylE gene of Pseudomonas putida as a reporter and can be transferred to streptomycetes by conjugation from Escherichia coli. The function of these plasmids as promoter probes was demonstrated in Streptomyces antibioticus and Streptomyces coelicolor using the phenoxazinone synthase and polynucleotide phosphorylase promoters from S. antibioticus. xylE activity could be detected in colonies on agar plates or via the in vitro assay for catechol dioxygenase. The integration into the S. antibioticus chromosome of the constructs containing the phsA promoter was verified by Southern blotting. The presence of the bla locus in pIPP1 allows the recovery of putative promoters by marker rescue.
TI  - Complex evaluation of ecotoxicity and genotoxicity of antimicrobials oxytetracycline and flumequine used in aquaculture.
AB  - Ecotoxicity and genotoxicity of widely used veterinary antimicrobials oxytetracycline and flumequine was studied with six model organisms (Vibrio fischeri, Pseudomonas putida, Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata, Lemna minor, Daphnia magna, Escherichia coli). Overall median effective concentration (EC50) values ranged from 0.22 mg/L to 86 mg/L. Pseudomonas putida was the most sensitive organism (EC50 values for 16-h growth inhibition were 0.22 and 0.82 mg/L for oxytetracycline and flumequine, respectively), followed by duckweed Lemna minor (7-d growth inhibition, EC50 2.1 and 3.0 mg/L) and green alga Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata (4-d growth inhibition, EC50 3.1 and 2.6 mg/L). The least sensitive organism was Daphnia magna (48-h immobilization, lowest-observed-effect concentration [LOEC] of oxytetracycline of 400 mg/L). Oxytetracycline showed limited genotoxicity (SOS-chromotest with Escherichia coli, minimal genotoxic concentration of 500 mg/L), and flumequine was genotoxic at 0.25 mg/L. Based on the reported measured concentrations (MECs) and predicted no-effect concentrations (PNECs), oxytetracycline may be concluded to be of ecotoxicological concern (calculated risk quotient = 8), whereas flumequine seems to represent lower risk.
TI  - Quantification of ploidy in proteobacteria revealed the existence of monoploid, (mero-)oligoploid and polyploid species.
AB  - Bacteria are generally assumed to be monoploid (haploid). This assumption is mainly based on generalization of the results obtained with the most intensely studied model bacterium, Escherichia coli (a gamma-proteobacterium), which is monoploid during very slow growth. However, several species of proteobacteria are oligo- or polyploid, respectively. To get a better overview of the distribution of ploidy levels, genome copy numbers were quantified in four species of three different groups of proteobacteria. A recently developed Real Time PCR approach, which had been used to determine the ploidy levels of halophilic archaea, was optimized for the quantification of genome copy numbers of bacteria. Slow-growing (doubling time 103 minutes) and fast-growing (doubling time 25 minutes) E. coli cultures were used as a positive control. The copy numbers of the origin and terminus region of the chromosome were determined and the results were in excellent agreement with published data. The approach was also used to determine the ploidy levels of Caulobacter crescentus (an alpha-proteobacterium) and Wolinella succinogenes (an epsilon-proteobacterium), both of which are monoploid. In contrast, Pseudomonas putida (a gamma-proteobacterium) contains 20 genome copies and is thus polyploid. A survey of the proteobacteria with experimentally-determined genome copy numbers revealed that only three to four of 11 species are monoploid and thus monoploidy is not typical for proteobacteria. The ploidy level is not conserved within the groups of proteobacteria, and there are no obvious correlations between the ploidy levels with other parameters like genome size, optimal growth temperature or mode of life.
TI  - Regulatory exaptation of the catabolite repression protein (Crp)-cAMP system in Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - The genome of the soil bacterium Pseudomonas putida KT2440 encodes singular orthologues of genes crp (encoding the catabolite repression protein, Crp) and cyaA (adenylate cyclase) of Escherichia coli. The levels of cAMP formed by P. putida cells were below detection with a Dictyostelium biosensor in vivo. The cyaA(P. putida) gene was transcribed in vivo but failed to complement the lack of maltose consumption of a cyaA mutant of E. coli, thereby indicating that cyaA(P. putida) was poorly translated or rendered non-functional in the heterologous host. Yet, generation of cAMP by CyaA(P. putida) could be verified by expressing the cyaA(P. putida) gene in a hypersensitive E. coli strain. On the other hand, the crp(P. putida) gene restored the metabolic capacities of an equivalent crp mutant of E. coli, but not in a double crp/cyaA strain, suggesting that the ability to regulate such functions required cAMP. In order to clarify the breadth of the Crp/cAMP system in P. putida, crp and cyaA mutants were generated and passed through a battery of phenotypic tests for recognition of gross metabolic properties and stress-endurance abilities. These assays revealed that the loss of each gene led in most (but not all) cases to the same phenotypic behaviour, indicating a concerted functionality. Unexpectedly, none of the mutations affected the panel of carbon compounds that can be used by P. putida as growth substrates, the mutants being impaired only in the use of various dipeptides as N sources. Furthermore, the lack of crp or cyaA had little influence on the gross growth fingerprinting of the cells. The poor physiological profile of the Crp-cAMP system of P. putida when compared with E. coli exposes a case of regulatory exaptation, i.e. the process through which a property evolved for a particular function is co-opted for a new use.
TI  - Mining bacterial genomes for novel arylesterase activity.
AB  - One hundred and seventy-one genes encoding potential esterases from 11 bacterial  genomes were cloned and overexpressed in Escherichia coli; 74 of the clones produced soluble proteins. All 74 soluble proteins were purified and screened for esterase activity; 36 proteins showed carboxyl esterase activity on short-chain esters, 17 demonstrated arylesterase activity, while 38 proteins did not exhibit any activity towards the test substrates. Esterases from Rhodopseudomonas palustris (RpEST-1, RpEST-2 and RpEST-3), Pseudomonas putida (PpEST-1, PpEST-2 and PpEST-3), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PaEST-1) and Streptomyces avermitilis (SavEST-1) were selected for detailed biochemical characterization. All of the enzymes showed optimal activity at neutral or alkaline pH, and the half-life of each enzyme at 50 degrees C ranged from < 5 min to over 5 h. PpEST-3, RpEST-1 and RpEST-2 demonstrated the highest specific activity with pNP-esters; these enzymes were also among the most stable at 50 degrees C and in the presence of detergents, polar and non-polar organic solvents, and imidazolium ionic liquids. Accordingly, these enzymes are particularly interesting targets for subsequent application trials. Finally, biochemical and bioinformatic analyses were compared to reveal sequence features that could be correlated to enzymes with arylesterase activity, facilitating subsequent searches for new esterases in microbial genome sequences.
TI  - Efficient functional analysis system for cyanobacterial or plant cytochromes P450 involved in sesquiterpene biosynthesis.
AB  - Tractable plasmids (pAC-Mv-based plasmids) for Escherichia coli were constructed, which carried a mevalonate-utilizing gene cluster, towards an efficient functional analysis of cytochromes P450 involved in sesquiterpene biosynthesis. They included genes coding for a series of redox partners that transfer the electrons from NAD(P)H to a P450 protein. The redox partners used were ferredoxin reductases (CamA and NsRED) and ferredoxins (CamB and NsFER), which are derived from Pseudomonas putida and cyanobacterium Nostoc sp. strain PCC 7120, respectively, as well as three higher-plant NADPH-P450 reductases, the Arabidopsis thaliana ATR2 and two corresponding enzymes derived from ginger (Zingiber officinale), named ZoRED1 and ZoRED2. We also constructed plasmids for functional analysis of two P450s, alpha-humulene-8-hydroxylase (CYP71BA1) from shampoo ginger (Zingiber zerumbet) and germacrene A hydroxylase (P450NS; CYP110C1) from Nostoc sp. PCC 7120, and co-transformed E. coli with each of the pAC-Mv-based plasmids. Production levels of 8-hydroxy-alpha-humulene with recombinant E. coli cells (for CYP71BA1) were 1.5- to 2.3-fold higher than that of a control strain without the mevalonate-pathway genes. Level of the P450NS product with the combination of NsRED and NsFER was 2.9-fold higher than that of the CamA and CamB. The predominant product of P450NS was identified as 1,2,3,5,6,7,8,8a-octahydro-6-isopropenyl-4,8a-dimethylnaphth-1-ol with NMR analyses.
TI  - Tailor-made type II Pseudomonas PHA synthases and their use for the biosynthesis  of polylactic acid and its copolymer in recombinant Escherichia coli.
AB  - Previously, we have developed metabolically engineered Escherichia coli strains capable of producing polylactic acid (PLA) and poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-lactate) [P(3HB-co-LA)] by employing evolved Clostridium propionicum propionate CoA transferase (Pct(Cp)) and Pseudomonas sp. MBEL 6-19 polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) synthase 1 (PhaC1(Ps6-19)). Introduction of mutations four sites (E130, S325, S477, and Q481) of PhaC1( Ps6-19) have been found to affect the polymer content, lactate mole fraction, and molecular weight of P(3HB-co-LA). In this study, we have further engineered type II Pseudomonas PHA synthases 1 (PhaC1s) from Pseudomonas chlororaphis, Pseudomonas sp. 61-3, Pseudomonas putida KT2440, Pseudomonas resinovorans, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 to accept short-chain-length hydroxyacyl-CoAs including lactyl-CoA and 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA as substrates by site-directed mutagenesis of four sites (E130, S325, S477, and Q481). All PhaC1s having mutations in these four sites were able to accept lactyl-CoA as a substrate and supported the synthesis of P(3HB-co-LA) in recombinant E. coli, whereas the wild-type PhaC1s could not accumulate polymers in detectable levels. The contents, lactate mole fractions, and the molecular weights of P(3HB-co-LA) synthesized by recombinant E. coli varied depending upon the source of the PHA synthase and the mutants used. PLA homopolymer could also be produced at ca. 7 wt.% by employing the several PhaC1 variants containing E130D/S325T/S477G/Q481K quadruple mutations in wild-type E. coli XL1-Blue.
TI  - Spectroscopic studies and antibacterial activities of some new 16-membered octaazamacrocyclic complexes derived from thiocarbohydrazide and pentane-2,4-dione.
AB  - A series of macrocyclic complexes of the type [M(C12H20N8S2)X2]; where M=Co(II),  Ni(II), Cu(II), Zn(II); X=Cl-, NO3-, CH3COO- has been synthesized by template condensation of thiocarbohydrazide and pentane-2,4-dione in the presence of divalent metal salts in methanolic medium. The complexes have been characterized with the help of elemental analyses, conductance measurements, magnetic measurements, electronic, NMR, IR, EPR and MS spectral studies. The low value of molar conductance indicates them to be non-electrolytes. On the basis of various studies a distorted octahedral geometry may be proposed for all of these complexes. These metal complexes were also tested for their in vitro antibacterial activities against some Gram-positive bacterial strains, i.e., Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus stearothermophilus and two Gram-negative bacterial strains, i.e., Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas putida. The results obtained were compared with standard antibiotics, Chloramphenicol and Streptomycin and found that some of the synthesized complexes show good antibacterial activities as compared to the standard antibiotics.
TI  - Stability, bioavailability, and bacterial toxicity of ZnO and iron-doped ZnO nanoparticles in aquatic media.
AB  - The stability and bioavailability of nanoparticles is governed by the interfacial properties that nanoparticles acquire when immersed in a particular aquatic media as well as the type of organism or cell under consideration. Herein, high-throughput screening (HTS) was used to elucidate ZnO nanoparticle stability, bioavailability, and antibacterial mechanisms as a function of iron doping level (in the ZnO nanoparticles), aquatic chemistry, and bacterial cell type. zeta-Potential and aggregation state of dispersed ZnO nanoparticles was strongly influenced by iron doping in addition to electrolyte composition and dissolved organic matter; however, bacterial inactivation by ZnO nanoparticles was most significantly influenced by Zn(2+) ions dissolution, cell type, and organic matter. Nanoparticle IC(50) values determined for Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli were on the order of 0.3-0.5 and 15-43 mg/L (as Zn(2+)), while the IC(50) for Zn(2+) tolerant Pseudomonas putida was always >500 mg/L. Tannic acid decreased toxicity of ZnO nanoparticles more than humic, fulvic, and alginic acid, because it complexed the most free Zn(2+) ions, thereby reducing their bioavailability. These results underscore the complexities and challenges regulators face in assessing potential environmental impacts of nanotechnology; however, the high-throughput and combinatorial methods employed promise to rapidly expand the knowledge base needed to develop an appropriate risk assessment framework.
TI  - Expression, purification and functional characterization of a recombinant 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl-1,2-dioxygenase from Rhodococcus rhodochrous.
AB  - A 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl (2,3-DHBP) dioxygenase gene from a Rhodococcus sp. strain, named RrbphCI and involved in the degradation of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), was synthesized. RrbphCI was expressed in Escherichia coli and its encoded enzyme was purified. SDS-PAGE analysis indicated that the size of the protein encoded by RrbphCI was about 32 kDa. The activity of the 2,3-DHBP dioxygenase was 82.8 U/mg when the substrate was 2,3-DHBP, with optimum pH 8.0 at 30 degrees C, and optimum temperature was 40 degrees C at pH 8.0. The RrbphCI gene was transformed into Pseudomonas putida strain EG11, to determine the ability of the enzyme to degrade 2,3-DHBP. The wild type EG11 degraded 61.86% of supplied 2,3-DHBP and the transformed EG11 (hosting the RrbphCI gene) utilized 52.68% after 2 min of treatment at 30 degrees C. The overexpressed and purified enzyme was able to degrade 2,3-DHBP. The 2,3-DHBP dioxygenase is a key enzyme in the PCB degradation pathway. RrbphCI and its encoded 2,3-DHBP dioxygenase may have transgenic applications in bioremediation of PCBs.
TI  - Characterization of a novel immobilized biocatalyst obtained by matrix-assisted refolding of recombinant polyhydroxyoctanoate depolymerase from Pseudomonas putida KT2442 isolated from inclusion bodies.
AB  - Purification and matrix-assisted refolding of recombinant His-tagged polyhydroxyalkanoate (PhaZ) depolymerase from Pseudomonas putida KT2442 was carried out. His-tagged enzyme was overproduced as inclusion bodies in recombinant E. coli M15 (pREP4, pPAZ3), which were denatured by 8 M urea, immobilized on Ni(2+)-nitrilotriacetate-agarose matrix, and refolded by gradual removal of the chaotropic agent. The refolded enzyme could not be eluted with 1 M imidazole buffer, leading to an immobilized biocatalyst where PhaZ depolymerase was homogeneously distributed in the agarose support as shown by confocal scanning microscopy. Polyhydroxyoctanoate could not be hydrolyzed by this novel immobilized biocatalyst, whereas the attached enzyme was active in the hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl alkanoate esters, which differed in their alkyl chain length. Taking advantage of the observed esterase activity on p-nitrophenylacetate, functional characterization of immobilized PhaZ depolymerase was carried out. The immobilized enzyme was more stable than its soluble counterpart and showed optimal hydrolytic activity at 37 degrees C and 50 mM phosphate buffer pH 8.0. Kinetic parameters were obtained with both p-nitrophenylacetate and p-nitrophenyloctanoate, which had not been described so far for the soluble enzyme, representing an attractive and alternative chromogenic assay for the study of this paradigmatic enzyme.
TI  - Crystal structure of TtgV in complex with its DNA operator reveals a general model for cooperative DNA binding of tetrameric gene regulators.
AB  - The majority of bacterial gene regulators bind as symmetric dimers to palindromic DNA operators of 12-20 base pairs (bp). Multimeric forms of proteins, including tetramers, are able to recognize longer operator sequences in a cooperative manner, although how this is achieved is not well understood due to the lack of complete structural information. Models, instead of structures, of complete tetrameric assembly on DNA exist in literature. Here we present the crystal structures of the multidrug-binding protein TtgV, a gene repressor that controls efflux pumps, alone and in complex with a 42-bp DNA operator containing two TtgV recognition sites at 2.9 A and 3.4 A resolution. These structures represent the first full-length functional tetrameric protein in complex with its intact DNA operator containing two continuous recognition sites. TtgV binds to its DNA operator as a highly asymmetric tetramer and induces considerable distortions in the DNA, resulting in a 60 degrees bend. Upon binding to its operator, TtgV undergoes large conformational changes at the monomeric, dimeric, and tetrameric levels. The structures here reveal a general model for cooperative DNA binding of tetrameric gene regulators and provide a structural basis for a large body of biochemical data and a reinterpretation of previous models for tetrameric gene regulators derived from partial structural data.
TI  - Characterization of cytochrome P450 monooxygenase CYP154H1 from the thermophilic  soil bacterium Thermobifida fusca.
AB  - Cytochrome P450 monooxygenases are valuable biocatalysts due to their ability to  hydroxylate unactivated carbon atoms using molecular oxygen. We have cloned the gene for a new cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, named CYP154H1, from the moderately thermophilic soil bacterium Thermobifida fusca. The enzyme was overexpressed in Escherichia coli at up to 14% of total soluble protein and purified to homogeneity in three steps. CYP154H1 activity was reconstituted using putidaredoxin reductase and putidaredoxin from Pseudomonas putida DSM 50198 as surrogate electron transfer partners. In biocatalytic reactions with different aliphatic and aromatic substrates of varying size, the enzyme converted small aromatic and arylaliphatic compounds like ethylbenzene, styrene, and indole. Furthermore, CYP154H1 also accepted different arylaliphatic sulfides as substrates chemoselectively forming the corresponding sulfoxides and sulfones. The enzyme is moderately thermostable with an apparent melting temperature of 67 degrees C and exhibited still 90% of initial activity after incubation at 50 degrees C.
TI  - Biosynthesis of zeaxanthin in recombinant Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - Pseudomonas putida KT2440 strain was investigated for biosynthesis of the valuable xanthophyll zeaxanthin. A new plasmid was constructed harboring five carotenogenic genes from Pantoea ananatis and three genes from Escherichia coli under control of an L: -rhamnose-inducible promoter. Pseudomonas putida KT2440 wild type hardly tolerated the plasmids for carotenoid production. Mating experiments with E. coli S17-1 strains revealed that the carotenoid products are toxic to the Pseudomonas putida cells. Several carotenoid-tolerant transposon mutants could be isolated, and different gene targets for relief of carotenoid toxicity were identified. After optimization of cultivation conditions and product processing, 51 mg/l zeaxanthin could be produced, corresponding to a product yield of 7 mg zeaxanthin per gram cell dry weight. The effect of various additives on production of hydrophobic zeaxanthin was investigated as well. Particularly, the addition of lecithin during cell cultivation increased volumetric productivity of Pseudomonas putida by a factor of 4.7 (51 mg/l vs. 239 mg/l).
TI  - Development of microbial engineered whole-cell systems for environmental benzene  determination.
AB  - This paper reports the development of two recombinant bacterial systems that can  be used to monitor environmental benzene contamination based on Escherichia coli, which carry genes coding for benzene dioxygenase and benzene dihydrodiol dehydrogenase from Pseudomonas putida MST. E. coli strains express these two enzymes under the control of the Ptac promoter or without any induction. These activities can be detected electrochemically or colorimetrically and used to monitor benzene pollution in environmental air samples collected from an oil refinery assessing benzene by different laboratory experimental procedures. The procedures involving whole-cell bioassays determine the concentration of benzene through benzene dioxygenase activity, which allows for direct correlation of oxygen consumption, and through the benzene dihydrodiol dehydrogenase that causes catechol accumulation and restores NADH necessary for the activity of the first enzyme. Oxygen consumption and catechol production deriving from both enzymatic activities are related to benzene concentration and their measurements determined the sensitivity of the system. The results indicated that the sensitivity was enough to detect the benzene vapor at a lower concentration level of 0.01 mM in about 30 min. The possibility for on-line monitoring of benzene concentration by our new recombinant cells results from the fact that no particular treatment of environmental samples is required. This is a major advantage over other biosensors or assays. Moreover, the development of microbial cells that did not require any addition or effectors for the transcription of the specific enzymes, allowed these systems to be more versatile in automated environmental benzene monitoring.
TI  - Molecular characterization of a novel big defensin from clam Venerupis philippinarum.
AB  - Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are important mediators of the primary defense mechanism against microbial invasion. In the present study, a big defensin was identified from Venerupis philippinarum haemocytes (denoted as VpBD) by RACE and EST approaches. The VpBD cDNA contained an open reading frame (ORF) of 285 bp encoding a polypeptide of 94 amino acids. The deduce amino acid sequence of VpBD shared the common features of big defensin including disulfide array organization and helix structure, indicating that VpBD should be a new member of the big defensin family. The mRNA transcript of VpBD was up-regulated significantly during the first 24 hr after Vibrio anguillarum challenge, which was 7.4-fold increase compared to that of the control group. Then the expression decreased gradually from 24 hr to 96 hr, and the lowest expression level was detected at 96 hr post-infection, which was still 3.9-fold higher than that of control. The mature peptide of VpBD was recombined in Escherichia coli and purified for minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) determination. The rVpBD displayed broad-spectrum inhibitory activity towards all tested bacteria with the highest activity against Staphyloccocus aureus and Pseudomonas putida. These results indicated that VpBD was involved in the host immune response against bacterial infection and might contribute to the clearance of invading bacteria.
TI  - Correlation between catalytic activity and monomer-dimer equilibrium of bacterial alanine racemases.
AB  - From the reaction mechanism and crystal structure analysis, a bacterial alanine racemase is believed to work as a homodimer with a substrate, l-alanine or d-alanine. We analysed oligomerization states of seven alanine racemases, biosynthetic and catabolic, from Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. putida and P. fluorescens, with three different methods, gel filtration chromatography, native PAGE and analytical ultracentrifugation. All alanine racemases were proved to be in a dynamic equilibrium between monomeric and dimeric form with every methods used in this study. In both biosynthetic and catabolic alanine racemases, association constants for dimerization were high for the enzymes with high V(max) values. The enzymes with low V(max) values gave the low association constants. We proposed that alanine racemases are classified into two types; the enzymes with low and high-equilibrium association constants for dimerization.
TI  - Physiological relation between respiration activity and heterologous expression of selected benzoylformate decarboxylase variants in Escherichia coli.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The benzoylformate decarboxylase (BFD) from Pseudomonas putida is a biotechnologically interesting biocatalyst. It catalyses the formation of chiral 2-hydroxy ketones, which are important building blocks for stereoselective syntheses. To optimise the enzyme function often the amino acid composition is modified to improve the performance of the enzyme. So far it was assumed that a relatively small modification of the amino acid composition of a protein does not significantly influence the level of expression or media requirements. To determine, which effects these modifications might have on cultivation and product formation, six different BFD-variants with one or two altered amino acids and the wild type BFD were expressed in Escherichia coli SG13009 pKK233-2. The oxygen transfer rate (OTR) as parameter for growth and metabolic activity of the different E. coli clones was monitored on-line in LB, TB and modified PanG mineral medium with the Respiratory Activity MOnitoring System (RAMOS). RESULTS: Although the E. coli clones were genetically nearly identical, the kinetics of their metabolic activity surprisingly differed in the standard media applied. Three different types of OTR curves could be distinguished. Whereas the first type (clones expressing Leu476Pro-Ser181Thr or Leu476Pro) had typical OTR curves, the second type (clones expressing the wild type BFD, Ser181Thr or His281Ala) showed an early drop of OTR in LB and TB medium and a drastically reduced maximum OTR in modified PanG mineral medium. The third type (clone expressing Leu476Gln) behaved variable. Depending on the cultivation conditions, its OTR curve was similar to the first or the second type. It was shown, that the kinetics of the metabolic activity of the first type depended on the concentration of thiamine, which is a cofactor of BFD, in the medium. It was demonstrated that the cofactor binding strength of the different BFD-variants correlated with the differences in metabolic activity of their respective host strain. CONCLUSIONS: The BFD-variants with high cofactor binding affinity (wild type, His281Ala, Ser181Thr) obviously extract thiamine from the medium and bind it tightly to the enzyme. This might explain the hampered growth of these clones. In contrast, growth of clones expressing variants with low cofactor binding affinity (Leu476His, Leu476Pro, Leu476Pro-Ser181Thr) is not impaired. Leu476Gln has an intermediate cofactor binding strength, thus, growth of its host strain depends on the specific cultivation conditions. This paper shows that slight differences of the amino acid composition can affect protein expression and cultivation and might require an adaptation of media components. Effects such as the observed are hardly foreseeable and difficult to detect in conventional screening processes. Via small scale experiments with on-line measurements in shake flasks such effects influencing the cultivation and product formation can be detected and avoided.
TI  - Active community profiling via capillary electrophoresis single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis of amplified 16S rRNA and 16S rRNA genes.
AB  - Here, we report the validation and advancement of a high-throughput method for fingerprinting the active members of a microbial community. This method, termed active community profiling (ACP), provides information about both the composition and the activity of mixed microbial cultures via comparative measurements of amplified 16S rRNA (RNA) and 16S rRNA genes (DNA). Capillary electrophoresis is used to resolve single-strand conformation polymorphisms of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) products, producing electropherograms representative of the community structure. Active members of the community are distinguished by elevated RNA:DNA peak area ratios. Chemostat experiments with defined populations were conducted to validate the ACP approach. Using a pure culture of Escherichia coli, a direct correlation was found between the growth rate and the RNA:DNA peak ratio. In a second validation experiment, a binary culture of E. coli and Pseudomonas putida was subjected to a controlled environmental change consisting of a shift to anaerobic conditions. ACP revealed the expected cessation of growth of P. putida, an obligate aerobe, while the corresponding DNA-only analysis indicated no change in the culture. Finally, ACP was applied to a complex microbial community, and a novel binning approach was demonstrated for integrating the RNA and DNA electropherograms. ACP thus represents a significant advance from traditional DNA-based profiling techniques, which do not distinguish active from inactive or dead cells, and is well suited for high-throughput community analysis.
TI  - Growth behaviors of bacteria in biofouling cake layer in a dead-end microfiltration system.
AB  - The growth behaviors of three bacterial species, i.e. Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas putida and Aquabaculum hongkongensis, in biofouling cake layer (attached form) were investigated using an unstirred dead-end continuous microfiltration system, and were compared with those in suspended form. Results showed that all the three bacteria had larger average growth rates in suspended form than in attached form under high substrates levels. Under oligotrophic conditions, the average growth rates in the attached form were faster than those in the suspended form, especially for A. hongkongensis. The growth behaviors analysis presented the same results due to all the tested bacteria had higher maximum growth rate and saturation constant in suspended form than attached form, indicating the dominant growth mode would be shifted from attached form to suspended form with substrate concentration increase. Finally, total filtration resistance determined in the experiments increased significantly with the bacterial growth in filtration system.
TI  - A mutation in dnaK causes stabilization of the heat shock sigma factor sigma32, accumulation of heat shock proteins and increase in toluene-resistance in Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - Heat shock gene expression is regulated by the cellular level and activity of the stress sigma factor sigma(32) in Gram-negative bacteria. A toluene-resistant, temperature-sensitive derivative strain of Pseudomonas putida KT2442, designated KT2442-R2 (R2), accumulated several heat shock proteins (HSPs) under non-stress conditions. Genome sequencing of strain R2 revealed that its genome contains a number of point mutations, including a CGT to CCT change in dnaK resulting in an Arg445 to Pro substitution in DnaK. DNA microarray and real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analyses revealed that the mRNA levels of representative hsp genes (e.g. dnaK, htpG and groEL) were upregulated in R2 cells in the stationary phase. Wild-type and R2 cells showed similar heat shock responses at hsp mRNA and HSP levels; however, the sigma(32) level in the mutant was not downregulated in the shut-off stage. Strain R2 harbouring plasmid-borne dnaK grew at 37 degrees C, did not accumulate HSPs, and was more sensitive to toluene than strain R2. It is worth to note that that revertant of R2 able to grow at 37 degrees C were isolated and exhibited a replacement of Pro445 by Ser or Leu in DnaK. Thus, the mutation in dnaK causes the temperature-sensitive phenotype, improper stabilization of sigma(32) leading to HSP accumulation and increased toluene resistance in strain R2.
TI  - Construction and characterization of Escherichia coli whole-cell biosensors for toluene and related compounds.
AB  - The XylR regulatory protein is a transcriptional activator from the TOL plasmid of Pseudomonas putida mt-2 that is involved in the toluene and benzene degradation pathway. Here we describe the construction and laboratory characterization of recombinant biosensors (pGLPX plasmids) based on XylR and its cognate promoter (Pu). In the pGLPX plasmid, the reporter luc gene is under the control of the Pu promoter. We evaluated the ability of two distinct nucleotide sequences to function as SD elements and improve sensitivity of bioreporting. We also evaluated the effect of introducing the T(2)rrnbeta terminator on the specificity of the construct. E. coli transformed with pGLPX plasmids were used to sense toluene and its derivatives. The pattern of induction was different for each derivative. In general, more luciferase activity was induced by toluene and benzene than by TNT and DNT at most tested concentrations. The bioluminescence response of the reporter strains to the nitrotoluenes was significantly stronger at lower concentrations (>/= 50 mumol) than at higher concentrations. Our results show that the SD sequence (taaggagg) is crucially important for biosensor sensitivity. The presence of the T(2)rrnbeta terminator in the bioreporter plasmid prevents nonspecific responses and also reduces biosensor sensitivity upon exposure to inducers. These data suggest that pGLPX strains can be used as whole-cell biosensors to detect toluene and related compounds. Further investigation will be required to optimize the application of pGLPX biosensors.
TI  - Novel tools for the functional expression of metagenomic DNA.
AB  - The functional expression of environmental genes in a particular host bacterium is hampered by various limitations including inefficient transcription of target genes as well as improper assembly of the corresponding enzymes. Therefore, the identification of novel enzymes from metagenomic libraries by activity-based screening requires efficient expression and screening systems. In the following chapter, we present two novel tools to improve the functional expression of metagenomic genes. (1) Comparative screenings of metagenomic libraries demonstrated that different enzymes were detected when phylogenetically distinct expression host strains were used. Thus, we have developed a strategy, which comprises library construction using a shuttle vector that allows comparative expression and screening of metagenomic DNA in Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas putida, and Bacillus subtilis. (2) Expression studies have revealed that functional expression of environmental genes in heterologous expression hosts is often limited by insufficient promoter recognition. Therefore, a method is described allowing to enhance the expression capacity of E. coli by using the transposon MuExpress. This recombinant transposon is able to insert randomly into environmental DNA fragments thereby facilitating gene expression from its two inducible promoters.
TI  - Transfer of plasmid pJP4 from Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida to bacteria in activated sludge developed under different sludge retention times.
AB  - To add the knowledge on the plasmid-mediated bioaugmentation in the activated sludge process, conjugative transfer of a self-transmissible, broad host range, mercury resistance, and partial 2,4-dichlorophenoxyactic acid (2,4-D)-degrading plasmid pJP4 from Escherichia coli HB101 or Pseudomonas putida KT2440 to activated sludge bacteria were examined by filter mating. Activated sludge samples were collected from an actual wastewater treatment plant and laboratory reactors operated under different sludge retention times (SRTs) of 5, 10, and 15 days. Transfer of pJP4 was observed in all combinations of donor and activated sludge (recipient) with the transfer frequency from 6.5 x 10(-)(8) to 2.5 x 10(-)(4) transconjugants per recipient, except from E. coli HB101 to the activated sludge sample of SRT 5 days. Although plasmid pJP4 was transferred mainly to dominant bacteria belonging to Pseudomonas, the host range of pJP4 in the activated sludge varied depending on the donor strain. Phenotypically various transconjugants were isolated from activated sludge sampled from the reactors with longer SRT operations. All transconjugants exhibited high mercury resistance equivalent to the donor strains; some were capable of degrading 2,4-D. These results suggest that the behavior of plasmids can be controlled partially through selection of appropriate donor strains and operational conditions of the activated sludge process.
TI  - Scale-up of Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenase-catalyzed synthesis of enantiopure compounds.
AB  - Several Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenases converting a wide spectrum of substrates have been discovered, cloned, and characterized throughout the last few years. Still, only a few of them are applicable for large-scale conversion predominantly due to their sensitivity towards high substrate and/or product concentrations. The recently cloned and characterized 4-hydroxyacetophenone monooxygenase from Pseudomonas putida JD1 shows excellent enantioselectivity towards 3-phenyl-2-butanone with E > 100 but is inhibited by concentrations >10 mM of both substrate and product. This obstacle could be circumvented by in situ substrate feed and product removal using a hydrophobic Lewatit(R) adsorbent resin. Thus, the concentration of 3-phenyl-2-butanone could be increased from 1.4 to >26 mM without significant reduction in conversion.
TI  - Rapid and multiple in situ identification and analyses of physiological status of specific bacteria based on fluorescent in situ hybridization.
AB  - Quantitative analysis of the target microorganism in microbial communities is important for the assessment of bacterial activity in environment. Here we present a method of a combination of fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) method and live/dead staining which allows in situ identification and analysis of physiological status of specific bacteria.
TI  - Advanced tool for characterization of microbial cultures by combining cytomics and proteomics.
AB  - Flow cytometry approaches are applicable to recover sub-populations of microbial  cultures in a purified form. To examine the characteristics of each sorted cell population, Omics technologies can be used for comprehensively monitoring cellular physiology, adaptation reactions, and regulated processes. In this study, we combined flow cytometry and gel-free proteomic analysis to investigate an artificial mixed bacterial culture consisting of Escherichia coli K-12 and Pseudomonas putida KT2440. Therefore, a filter-based device technique and an on-membrane digestion protocol were combined in conjunction with liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. This combination enabled us to identify 903 proteins from sorted E. coli K-12 and 867 proteins from sorted P. putida KT2440 bacteria from only 5 x 10(6) cells of each. Comparative proteomic analysis of sorted and non-sorted samples was done to prove that sorting did not significantly influence the bacterial proteome profile. We further investigated the physicochemical properties, namely M (r), pI, hydropathicity, and transmembrane helices of the proteins covered. The on-membrane digestion protocol applied did not require conventional detergents or urea, but exhibited similar recovery of all protein classes as established protocols with non-sorted bacterial samples.
TI  - Design and characterization of an aequorin-based bacterial biosensor for detection of toluene and related compounds.
AB  - An aequorin-based Escherichia coli strain JM109 biosensor was constructed and characterized for its potential to detect toluene and related compounds in aqueous solutions. The biosensor was constructed based on a PGL2 plasmid carrying the lower pathway promoter (Pu) of the xyl operon of Pseudomonas putida mt-2, which was incorporated with transcriptional activator xylR and fused to aequorin cDNA named pGL2-aequorin. Binding of xylR protein to a subset of toluene-like compounds activates transcription at the Pu promoter, thus expression of aequorin is controlled by xylR and Pu. In this work we have compared the effect of Shine-Dalgarno (SD) and T2 rrnbeta terminator sequence in the expression of aequorin. According to the sensitivity of aequorin and increase in the signal-to-noise ratio, this reporter enzyme has reasonable sensitivity compared with other reporter systems. The results indicate higher expression of aequorin in the presence of SD and T2 rrnbeta. The activity of aequorin in recombinant whole-cell biosensor was linear from 1 to 500 mum of toluene. The bioluminescence response was specific for toluene-like molecules, so this biosensor cells would be able to detect toluene derivative contamination in environmental samples, accurately.
TI  - Bacterial phenylalanine and phenylacetate catabolic pathway revealed.
AB  - Aromatic compounds constitute the second most abundant class of organic substrates and environmental pollutants, a substantial part of which (e.g., phenylalanine or styrene) is metabolized by bacteria via phenylacetate. Surprisingly, the bacterial catabolism of phenylalanine and phenylacetate remained an unsolved problem. Although a phenylacetate metabolic gene cluster had been identified, the underlying biochemistry remained largely unknown. Here we elucidate the catabolic pathway functioning in 16% of all bacteria whose genome has been sequenced, including Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida. This strategy is exceptional in several aspects. Intermediates are processed as CoA thioesters, and the aromatic ring of phenylacetyl-CoA becomes activated to a ring 1,2-epoxide by a distinct multicomponent oxygenase. The reactive nonaromatic epoxide is isomerized to a seven-member O-heterocyclic enol ether, an oxepin. This isomerization is followed by hydrolytic ring cleavage and beta-oxidation steps, leading to acetyl-CoA and succinyl-CoA. This widespread paradigm differs significantly from the established chemistry of aerobic aromatic catabolism, thus widening our view of how organisms exploit such inert substrates. It provides insight into the natural remediation of man-made environmental contaminants such as styrene. Furthermore, this pathway occurs in various pathogens, where its reactive early intermediates may contribute to virulence.
TI  - Pmr, a histone-like protein H1 (H-NS) family protein encoded by the IncP-7 plasmid pCAR1, is a key global regulator that alters host function.
AB  - Histone-like protein H1 (H-NS) family proteins are nucleoid-associated proteins (NAPs) conserved among many bacterial species. The IncP-7 plasmid pCAR1 is transmissible among various Pseudomonas strains and carries a gene encoding the H-NS family protein, Pmr. Pseudomonas putida KT2440 is a host of pCAR1, which harbors five genes encoding the H-NS family proteins PP_1366 (TurA), PP_3765 (TurB), PP_0017 (TurC), PP_3693 (TurD), and PP_2947 (TurE). Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) demonstrated that the presence of pCAR1 does not affect the transcription of these five genes and that only pmr, turA, and turB were primarily transcribed in KT2440(pCAR1). In vitro pull-down assays revealed that Pmr strongly interacted with itself and with TurA, TurB, and TurE. Transcriptome comparisons of the pmr disruptant, KT2440, and KT2440(pCAR1) strains indicated that pmr disruption had greater effects on the host transcriptome than did pCAR1 carriage. The transcriptional levels of some genes that increased with pCAR1 carriage, such as the mexEF-oprN efflux pump genes and parI, reverted with pmr disruption to levels in pCAR1-free KT2440. Transcriptional levels of putative horizontally acquired host genes were not altered by pCAR1 carriage but were altered by pmr disruption. Identification of genome-wide Pmr binding sites by ChAP-chip (chromatin affinity purification coupled with high-density tiling chip) analysis demonstrated that Pmr preferentially binds to horizontally acquired DNA regions. The Pmr binding sites overlapped well with the location of the genes differentially transcribed following pmr disruption on both the plasmid and the chromosome. Our findings indicate that Pmr is a key factor in optimizing gene transcription on pCAR1 and the host chromosome.
TI  - Molecular characterization and heterologous expression of quinate dehydrogenase gene from Gluconobacter oxydans IFO3244.
AB  - The quinate dehydrogenase (QDH) from Gluconobacter oxydans IFO3244 exhibits high  affinity for quinate, suggesting its application in shikimate production. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the qdh gene revealed a full-length of 2475-bp encoding an 824-amino acid protein. The qdh gene has the unusual TTG translation initiation codon. Conserved regions and a signature sequence for the quinoprotein family were observed. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated relatedness of QDH from G. oxydans to other quinate/shikimate dehydrogenases with the highest similarity (56%) with that of Acinetobacter calcoaceticus ADP1 and lower similarity (36%) with a membrane-bound glucose dehydrogenase of Escherichia coli. The function of the gene coding for QDH was confirmed by heterologous gene expression in pyrroloquinoline quinone-synthesizing Pseudomonas putida HK5.
TI  - A process optimization for bio-catalytic production of substituted catechols (3-nitrocatechol and 3-methylcatechol.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Substituted catechols are important precursors for large-scale synthesis of pharmaceuticals and other industrial products. Most of the reported chemical synthesis methods are expensive and insufficient at industrial level. However, biological processes for production of substituted catechols could be highly selective and suitable for industrial purposes. RESULTS: We have optimized a process for bio-catalytic production of 3-substituted catechols viz. 3-nitrocatechol (3-NC) and 3-methylcatechol (3-MC) at pilot scale. Amongst the screened strains, two strains viz. Pseudomonas putida strain (F1) and recombinant Escherichia coli expression clone (pDTG602) harboring first two genes of toluene degradation pathway were found to accumulate 3-NC and 3-MC respectively. Various parameters such as amount of nutrients, pH, temperature, substrate concentration, aeration, inoculums size, culture volume, toxicity of substrate and product, down stream extraction, single step and two-step biotransformation were optimized at laboratory scale to obtain high yields of 3-substituted catechols. Subsequently, pilot scale studies were performed in 2.5 liter bioreactor. The rate of product accumulation at pilot scale significantly increased up to approximately 90-95% with time and high yields of 3-NC (10 mM) and 3-MC (12 mM) were obtained. CONCLUSION: The biocatalytic production of 3-substituted catechols viz. 3-NC and 3-MC depend on some crucial parameters to obtain maximum yields of the product at pilot scale. The process optimized for production of 3-substituted catechols by using the organisms P. putida (F1) and recombinant E. coli expression clone (pDTG602) may be useful for industrial application.
TI  - Novel, versatile, and tightly regulated expression system for Escherichia coli strains.
AB  - A novel tightly regulated gene expression system was developed for Escherichia coli by applying the regulatory elements of the Pseudomonas putida F1 cym and cmt operons to control target gene expression at the transcriptional level by using p-isopropylbenzoate (cumate) as an inducer. This novel expression system, referred to as the cumate gene switch, includes a specific expression vector, pNEW, that contains a partial T5 phage promoter combined with the Pseudomonas-based synthetic operator and the cymR repressor protein-encoding gene designed to express constitutively in the host strain. The induction of transcription relies on the addition of the exogenous inducer (cumate), which is nontoxic to the culture, water soluble, and inexpensive. The characteristics and potential of the expression system were determined. Using flow cytometry and fed-batch fermentations, we have shown that, with the newly developed cumate-regulated system, (i) higher recombinant product yields can be obtained than with the pET (isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside [IPTG])-induced expression system, (ii) expression is tightly regulated, (iii) addition of cumate quickly results in a fully induced and homogenous protein-expressing population in contrast to the bimodal expression profile of an IPTG-induced population, (iv) expression can be modulated by varying the cumate concentration, and (v) the cumate-induced population remains induced and fully expressing even at 8 h following induction, resulting in high yields of the target protein Furthermore, the cumate gene switch described in this article is applicable to a wide range of E. coli strains.
TI  - Flavonoid glucuronides and a chromone from the aquatic macrophyte Stratiotes aloides.
AB  - The first phytochemical analysis of the aquatic macrophyte Stratiotes aloides afforded two new flavonoid glucuronides, luteolin 7-O-beta-D-glucopyranosiduronic acid-(1-->2)-beta-D-glucopyranoside (1) and chrysoeriol 7-O-beta-D-glucopyranosiduronic acid-(1-->2)-beta-D-glucopyranoside (2), as well as the new 2-(2-hydroxypentyl)-5-carboxy-7-methoxychromone (5) and chrysoeriol 7-O-beta-(6-O-malonyl)glucopyranoside (3), which has been assigned via NMR data for the first time. Additionally, free amino acids such as tryptophan, arginine, leucine, isoleucine, phenylalanine, and tyrosine along with choline, cis-aconitic acid, the phenolic glycoside alpha-arbutine, the chlorophyll derivative phaeophorbide a, and the flavonoid glycoside luteolin 7-O-beta-(6-O-malonyl)glucopyranoside (4) were isolated. Despite the low quantities obtained in some cases (between 50-300 microg), the structures of all compounds were unambiguously elucidated by extensive NMR and MS experiments. With a delay of 2 days compound 1 (10 and 50 microM test concentration) strongly inhibited the growth of human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells in a dose-dependent manner, whereas only a moderate growth inhibition of human Patu 8902 carcinoma cells could be observed. Compounds 1 and 2 showed no activities against the bacteria Escherichia coli BW25113, Pseudomonas pudida KT2440, and Enterobacter cloacae subsp. dissolvens.
TI  - Efficacy of sanitized ice in reducing bacterial load on fish fillet and in the water collected from the melted ice.
AB  - This study investigated the efficacy of sanitized ice for the reduction of bacteria in the water collected from the ice that melted during storage of whole and filleted Tilapia fish. Also, bacterial reductions on the fish fillets were investigated. The sanitized ice was prepared by freezing solutions of PRO-SAN (an organic acid formulation) and neutral electrolyzed water (NEW). For the whole fish study, the survival of the natural microflora was determined from the water of the melted ice prepared with PRO-SAN and tap water. These water samples were collected during an 8 h storage period. For the fish fillet study, samples were inoculated with Escherichia coli K12, Listeria innocua, and Pseudomonas putida then stored on crushed sanitized ice. The efficacies of these were tested by enumerating each bacterial species on the fish fillet and in the water samples at 12 and 24 h intervals for 72 h, respectively. Results showed that each bacterial population was reduced during the test. However, a bacterial reduction of < 1 log CFU was obtained for the fillet samples. A maximum of approximately 2 log CFU and > 3 log CFU reductions were obtained in the waters sampled after the storage of whole fish and the fillets, respectively. These reductions were significantly (P < 0.05) higher in the water from sanitized ice when compared with the water from the unsanitized melted ice. These results showed that the organic acid formulation and NEW considerably reduced the bacterial numbers in the melted ice and thus reduced the potential for cross-contamination.
TI  - In silico genome-scale metabolic analysis of Pseudomonas putida KT2440 for polyhydroxyalkanoate synthesis, degradation of aromatics and anaerobic survival.
AB  - Genome-scale metabolic models have been appearing with increasing frequency and have been employed in a wide range of biotechnological applications as well as in biological studies. With the metabolic model as a platform, engineering strategies have become more systematic and focused, unlike the random shotgun approach used in the past. Here we present the genome-scale metabolic model of the versatile Gram-negative bacterium Pseudomonas putida, which has gained widespread interest for various biotechnological applications. With the construction of the genome-scale metabolic model of P. putida KT2440, PpuMBEL1071, we investigated various characteristics of P. putida, such as its capacity for synthesizing polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) and degrading aromatics. Although P. putida has been characterized as a strict aerobic bacterium, the physiological characteristics required to achieve anaerobic survival were investigated. Through analysis of PpuMBEL1071, extended survival of P. putida under anaerobic stress was achieved by introducing the ackA gene from Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli.
TI  - Cloning and characterization of a gene cluster involved in the catabolism of p-nitrophenol from Pseudomonas putida DLL-E4.
AB  - A 9.2-kb DNA fragment encoding the enzymes of a p-nitrophenol (PNP) catabolic pathway from Pseudomonas putida DLL-E4 was cloned and sequenced. Ten open reading frames (ORFs) were found and five ORFs were functionally verified. The pnpA and pnpC gene products were purified to homogeneity by Ni-NTA chromatography. PnpA is a flavin adenine dinucleotide-dependent single-component PNP 4-monooxygenase which converts p-nitrophenol to para-benzoquinone in the presence of NADH and FAD. PnpC is a 1,2,4-trihydroxybenzene (BT) 1,2-dioxygenase which converts BT to maleylacetate. The hydroquinone (HQ) dioxygenase (PnpC1C2) multi-component protein complex was expressed in Escherichia coli via plasmid pET-pnpC1C2 containing pnpC1 and pnpC2. This complex converts HQ to gamma-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde. pnpR is a lysR-type regulator gene. PnpR is a positive regulator involved in HQ degradation in pnp gene cluster. These results demonstrate that a pathway encoded by the pnp gene cluster is involved in degradation of HQ and BT in P. putida DLL-E4.
TI  - A preliminary crystallographic study of recombinant NicX, an Fe(2+)-dependent 2,5-dihydroxypyridine dioxygenase from Pseudomonas putida KT2440.
AB  - NicX from Pseudomonas putida KT2440 is an Fe(2+)-dependent dioxygenase that is involved in the aerobic degradation of nicotinic acid. The enzyme converts 2,5-dihydroxypyridine to N-formylmaleamic acid when overexpressed in Escherichia coli. Biophysical characterization of NicX by analytical gel-filtration chromatography revealed that it behaves as an oligomeric assembly in solution, with an apparent molecular weight that is consistent with a hexameric species. NicX was crystallized by the hanging-drop vapour-diffusion method at 291 K. Diffraction data were collected to a resolution of 2.0 A at the ESRF. The crystals most probably belong to the orthorhombic space group C222 or C222(1). The estimated Matthews coefficient was 2.4 A(3) Da(-1), corresponding to 50% solvent content, which is consistent with the presence of three protein molecules in the asymmetric unit. Analysis of the crystal data together with chromatographic results supports NicX being a hexameric assembly composed of two cyclic trimers. Currently, crystallization of recombinant selenomethionine-containing NicX is in progress.
TI  - Domain cross-talk during effector binding to the multidrug binding TTGR regulator.
AB  - A major mechanism of antibiotic resistance in bacteria is the active extrusion of toxic compounds through membrane-bound efflux pumps. The TtgR protein represses transcription of ttgABC, a key efflux pump in Pseudomonas putida DOT-T1E capable of extruding antibiotics, solvents, and flavonoids. TtgR contains two distinct and overlapping ligand binding sites, one is broad and contains mainly hydrophobic residues, whereas the second is deep and contains polar residues. Mutants in the ligand binding pockets were generated and characterized using electrophoretic mobility shift assays, isothermal titration calorimetry, and promoter expression. Several mutants were affected in their response to effectors in vitro: mutants H70A, H72A, and R75A did not dissociate from promoter DNA in the presence of chloramphenicol. Other mutants exhibited altered binding to the operator: L66A and L66AV96A mutants bound 3- and 15-fold better than the native protein, whereas the H67A mutant bound with 3-fold lower affinity. In vivo expression assays using a fusion of the promoter of ttgA to lacZ and antibiotic tolerance correlated with the in vitro observations, namely that mutant H67A leads to increased basal expression levels and enhances antibiotic tolerance, whereas mutants L66A and L66AV96A exhibit lower basal expression levels and decreased resistance to antibiotics. The crystal structure of TtgR H67A was resolved. The data provide evidence for the inter-domain communication that is predicted to be required for the transmission of the effector binding signal to the DNA binding domain and provide important information to understand TtgR/DNA/effector interactions.
TI  - Development of a homologous expression system for rubber oxygenase RoxA from Xanthomonas sp.
AB  - AIMS: Natural rubber (poly-[cis-1,4-isoprene]) can be cleaved into 12-oxo-4,8-dimethyltrideca-4,8-diene-1-al by rubber oxygenase A (RoxA) isolated from Xanthomonas sp. RoxA is a novel type of dihaem dioxygenase with unknown cleavage mechanism of the rubber carbon backbone. Analysis of mutant RoxA after mutagenesis could be a way to investigate the function of selected amino acids of RoxA during catalysis. Unfortunately, expression of functional RoxA in recombinant Escherichia coli or in recombinant gamma-Proteobacteria such as Pseudomonas putida was not possible in our hands. Therefore, expression of recombinant RoxA in the homologous host, Xanthomonas, was performed. METHODS AND RESULTS: A transformation system via electroporation was established, and a conjugation system was optimized for Xanthomonas sp. Inactivation of the chromosomal roxA gene by insertional mutagenesis resulted in inability of Xanthomonas sp. to produce active RoxA and to utilize rubber as a sole source of carbon and energy. When an intact copy of roxA was cloned under control of a rhamnose-inducible promoter in a broad host range vector and was transferred to Xanthomonas sp., high expression levels of functional RoxA in the presence of rhamnose were obtained. CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Purification of recombinantly expressed RoxA was simplified because of drastically shortened fermentation times and because separation of RoxA from remaining rubber latex particles was not necessary with rhamnose-induced cultures. About 6 mg purified RoxA were obtained from 1 l of cell-free culture fluid. Purified recombinant RoxA was highly active and revealed comparable spectral properties as RoxA purified from the wild type. The results of our study are the methodical basis for molecular biological manipulation in Xanthomonas sp. and will simplify investigation into the biochemical mechanisms by which rubber can be biodegraded in the environment by this novel extracellular dihaem dioxygenase RoxA.
TI  - Insights into multienzyme docking in hybrid PKS-NRPS megasynthetases revealed by  heterologous expression and genetic engineering.
AB  
TI  - Crystal structure of the leucine aminopeptidase from Pseudomonas putida reveals the molecular basis for its enantioselectivity and broad substrate specificity.
AB  - The zinc-dependent leucine aminopeptidase from Pseudomonas putida (ppLAP) is an important enzyme for the industrial production of enantiomerically pure amino acids. To provide a better understanding of its structure-function relationships, the enzyme was studied by X-ray crystallography. Crystal structures of native ppLAP at pH 9.5 and pH 5.2, and in complex with the inhibitor bestatin, show that the overall folding and hexameric organization of ppLAP are very similar to those of the closely related di-zinc leucine aminopeptidases (LAPs) from bovine lens and Escherichia coli. At pH 9.5, the active site contains two metal ions, one identified as Mn(2+) or Zn(2+) (site 1), and the other as Zn(2+) (site 2). By using a metal-dependent activity assay it was shown that site 1 in heterologously expressed ppLAP is occupied mainly by Mn(2+). Moreover, it was shown that Mn(2+) has a significant activation effect when bound to site 1 of ppLAP. At pH 5.2, the active site of ppLAP is highly disordered and the two metal ions are absent, most probably due to full protonation of one of the metal-interacting residues, Lys267, explaining why ppLAP is inactive at low pH. A structural comparison of the ppLAP-bestatin complex with inhibitor-bound complexes of bovine lens LAP, along with substrate modelling, gave clear and new insights into its substrate specificity and high level of enantioselectivity.
TI  - P450cam visits an open conformation in the absence of substrate.
AB  - P450cam from Pseudomonas putida is the best characterized member of the vast family of cytochrome P450s, and it has long been believed to have a more rigid and closed active site relative to other P450s. Here we report X-ray structures of P450cam crystallized in the absence of substrate and at high and low [K(+)]. The camphor-free structures are observed in a distinct open conformation characterized by a water-filled channel created by the retraction of the F and G helices, disorder of the B' helix, and loss of the K(+) binding site. Crystallization in the presence of K(+) alone does not alter the open conformation, while crystallization with camphor alone is sufficient for closure of the channel. Soaking crystals of the open conformation in excess camphor does not promote camphor binding or closure, suggesting resistance to conformational change by the crystal lattice. This open conformation is remarkably similar to that seen upon binding large tethered substrates, showing that it is not the result of a perturbation by the ligand. Redissolved crystals of the open conformation are observed as a mixture of P420 and P450 forms, which is converted to the P450 form upon addition of camphor and K(+). These data reveal that P450cam can dynamically visit an open conformation that allows access to the deeply buried active site without being induced by substrate or ligand.
TI  - Metabolic engineering for microbial production of polyhydroxyalkanoates consisting of high 3-hydroxyhexanoate content by recombinant Aeromonas hydrophila.
AB  - Polyhydroxyalkanoate synthase gene phaC(ah) in Aeromonas hydrophila strain 4AK4 was deleted and its function was replaced by phaC1(ps) cloned from Pseudomonas stutzeri strain 1317 which favors 3-hydroxyhexanoate (3HHx) and longer chain length monomers. Genes fadD and fadL encoding Escherichia coli acyl-CoA synthase and Pseudomonas putida KT2442 fatty acid transport protein, respectively, were introduced into the recombinant with new phaC1(ps). Accumulation of a series of novel medium-chain-length polyhydroxyalkanoates (mcl-PHA) consisting of 80-94 mol% 3HHx were observed. The recombinant accumulated 54% poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyhexanoate) in cell dry weight consisting of 94.5 mol% 3HHx or 51% poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyhexanoate-co-3-hydroxyoctanoate) consisting of 82 mol% 3HHx and 16 mol% of 3HO during a two-step cultivation process under nitrogen limitation when grown on sodium hexanoate or sodium octanoate. The two polyesters containing high percentage of 3HHx are physically characterized. They could be used as biodegradable pressure sensitive adhesives, coatings, polymer binding agents in organic-solvent-free paints or a source for chiral R-3-hydroxyhexanoate.
TI  - [Isolation and identification of a bacterial strain KHg2 with high resistance to  mercury and cloning and expression of its merA gene].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study was to isolate and identify merA gene from a bacterial strain with high resistance to mercury. METHODS: A bacterial strain with resistance to mercury was isolated from the river sediment of Liangshui river in Beijing. The strain was identified according to the sequence analysis of 16S rRNA gene and its physiological and biochemical properties. A pair of PCR primers was designed according to the merA gene sequences of some bacteria published in the GeneBank to amplify the complete merA gene using the genomic DNA of KHg2 as a template. The PCR-amplified DNA fragment was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). Mercury resistance of the expression strain was tested. RESULTS: A bacterial strain which could grew on LB medium plate containing 70 mg/L HgCl2 was isolated, it was named as KHg2. The strain KHg2 shares 96% sequence identity with the type strain DSM12223T of Bacillus silvestris. The morphological characteristics and the results of physiological and biochemical properties of the strain were agreement with that of Bacillus silvestris. One PCR fragment of 1680 bp was obtained from the strain, which shares 99% sequence identity with merA gene of Pseudomonas putida. The PCR-amplified DNA fragment was cloned into a pET-30a (+) vector to obtain a expression plasmid pZY2. The expression plasmid was transformed into E. coil host strain to obtain a expression strain E. coli BL21 (DE3) x pZY2, a protein of 33 kDa was expressed by the expression strain after induced with isopropyl-b-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG). The result of heavy metal resistance test showed that the expression strain could grew on LB medium containing 20 mg/L HgCl2, meanwhile a negative control, E. coli BL21 (DE3), harbouring pET-30a (+), could not grew on LB medium containing 20 mg/L HgCl2. CONCLUSION: The isolated strain KHg2 was closely related to Bacillus silvestris. A merA gene was cloned from the strain KHg2 and was expressed successfully in E. coli. The expression strain E. coli BL21 (DE3) x pZY2 has resistance to heavy metal mercury.
TI  - Modelling the interactions between Pseudomonas putida and Escherichia coli O157:H7 in fish-burgers: use of the lag-exponential model and of a combined interaction index.
AB  - AIMS: The objective of the current study was to examine the interactions between  Pseudomonas putida and Escherichia coli O157:H7 in coculture studies on fish-burgers packed in air and under different modified atmospheres (30 : 40 : 30 O(2) : CO(2) : N(2), 5 : 95 O(2) : CO(2) and 50 : 50 O(2) : CO(2)), throughout the storage at 8 degrees C. METHODS AND RESULTS: The lag-exponential model was applied to describe the microbial growth. To give a quantitative measure of the occurring microbial interactions, two simple parameters were developed: the combined interaction index (CII) and the partial interaction index (PII). Under air, the interaction was significant (P < 0.05) only within the exponential growth phase (CII, 1.72), whereas under the modified atmospheres, the interactions were highly significant (P < 0.001) and occurred both in the exponential and in the stationary phase (CII ranged from 0.33 to 1.18). PII values for E. coli O157:H7 were lower than those calculated for Ps. putida. CONCLUSIONS: The interactions occurring into the system affected both E. coli O157:H7 and pseudomonads subpopulations. The packaging atmosphere resulted in a key element. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The article provides some useful information on the interactions occurring between E. coli O157:H7 and Ps. putida on fish-burgers. The proposed index describes successfully the competitive growth of both micro-organisms, giving also a quantitative measure of a qualitative phenomenon.
TI  - Rationally engineered biotransformation of p-nitrophenol.
AB  - An operon encoding enzymes responsible for degradation of the EPA priority contaminant para-nitrophenol (PNP) from Pseudomonas sp. ENV2030 contains more genes than would appear to be necessary to mineralize PNP. To determine some necessary genes for PNP degradation, the genes encoding the proposed enzymes in the degradation pathway (pnpADEC) were assembled into a broad-host-range, BioBricks-compatible vector under the control of a constitutive promoter. These were introduced into Escherichia coli DH10b and two Pseudomonas putida strains, one with a knockout of the aromatic transport TtgB and the parent with the native transporter. The engineered strains were assayed for PNP removal. E. coli DH10b harboring several versions of the refactored pathway was able to remove PNP from the medium up to a concentration of 0.2 mM; above which PNP was toxic to E. coli. A strain of P. putida harboring the PNP pathway genes was capable of removing PNP from the medium up to 0.5 mM. When P. putida harboring the native PNP degradation cluster was exposed to PNP, pnpADEC were induced, and the resulting production of beta-ketoadipate from PNP induced expression of its chromosomal degradation pathway (pcaIJF). In contrast, pnpADEC were expressed constitutively from the refactored constructs because none of the regulatory genes found in the native PNP degradation cluster were included. Although P. putida harboring the refactored construct was incapable of growing exclusively on PNP as a carbon source, evidence that the engineered pathway was functional was demonstrated by the induced expression of chromosomal pcaIJF.
TI  - Characterization of the versatile monooxygenase CYP109B1 from Bacillus subtilis.
AB  - The oxidizing activity of CYP109B1 from Bacillus subtilis was reconstituted in vitro with various artificial redox proteins including putidaredoxin reductase and putidaredoxin from Pseudomonas putida, truncated bovine adrenodoxin reductase and adrenodoxin, flavodoxin reductase and flavodoxin from Escherichia coli, and two flavodoxins from B. subtilis (YkuN and YkuP). Binding and oxidation of a broad range of chemically different substrates (fatty acids, n-alkanes, primary n-alcohols, terpenoids like (+)-valencene, alpha- and beta-ionone, and the steroid testosterone) were investigated. CYP109B1was found to oxidize saturated fatty acids (conversion up to 99%) and their methyl and ethyl esters (conversion up to 80%) at subterminal positions with a preference for the carbon atoms C11 and C12 counted from the carboxyl group. For the hydroxylation of primary n-alcohols, the omega(-2) position was preferred. n-Alkanes were not accepted as substrates by CYP109B1. Regioselective hydroxylation of terpenoids alpha-ionone (approximately 70% conversion) and beta-ionone (approximately 91% conversion) yielded the allylic alcohols 3-hydroxy-alpha-ionone and 4-hydroxy-beta-ionone, respectively. Furthermore, indole was demonstrated to inhibit fatty acid oxidation.
TI  - Broad-host-range vectors for protein expression across gram negative hosts.
AB  - Expression of recombinant proteins across a range of different host organisms is  often necessary in metabolic engineering applications. Doing so can be facilitated by the use of vectors having origins of replication with a broad-host-range, the option for antibiotic resistance cassettes that are compatible with a particular host, in addition to sequences allowing for the effective transcription and translation of target proteins. We have created a modular set of broad-host-range expression vectors for protein expression in Gram negative bacteria. These vectors use the broad-host-range pBBR1 replicon as well as the arabinose-inducible P(BAD) promoter and are available with six different antibiotic resistance cassettes. We have demonstrated the use of these vectors in Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas putida, and Burkholderia cepacia.
TI  - Functional display of Pseudomonas and Burkholderia lipases using a translocator domain of EstA autotransporter on the cell surface of Escherichia coli.
AB  - Functional expression of the industrially important Pseudomonas and Burkholderia  lipases, such as those from P. aeruginosa, B. cepacia and P. fluorescens, was achieved on the cell surface of Escherichia coli using the C-terminal translocator moiety (EstATu) of autotransporter protein (EstA) from P. putida. In particular, lipases which required a lipase-specific foldase (Lif) for their proper folding were for the first time displayed in the active form by coexpression of the Lif protein.
TI  - Regioselective oxidation of indole- and quinolinecarboxylic acids by cytochrome P450 CYP199A2.
AB  - CYP199A2, a bacterial P450 monooxygenase from Rhodopseudomonas palustris, was previously reported to oxidize 2-naphthoic acid and 4-ethylbenzoic acid. In this study, we examined the substrate specificity and regioselectivity of CYP199A2 towards indole- and quinolinecarboxylic acids. The CYP199A2 gene was coexpressed with palustrisredoxin gene from R. palustris and putidaredoxin reductase gene from Pseudomonas putida to provide the redox partners of CYP199A2 in Escherichia coli. Following whole-cell assays, reaction products were identified by mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy.CYP199A2 did not exhibit any activity towards indole and indole-3-carboxylic acid, whereas this enzyme oxidized indole-2-carboxylic acid, indole-5-carboxylic acid, and indole-6-carboxylic acid. Indole-2-carboxylic acid was converted to 5- and 6-hydroxyindole-2-carboxylic acids at a ratio of 59:41. In contrast, the indole-6-carboxylic acid oxidation generated only one product, 2-indolinone-6-carboxylic acid,at a rate of 130 mol (mol P450)(-1) min(-1). Furthermore,CYP199A2 also oxidized quinoline-6-carboxylic acid,although this enzyme did not exhibit any activity towards quinoline and its derivatives with a carboxyl group at the C-2,C-3, or C-4 positions. The oxidation product of quinoline-6-carboxylic acid was identified to be 3-hydroxyquinoline-6-carboxylic acid, which was a novel compound. These results suggest that CYP199A2 may be a valuable biocatalyst for the regioselective oxidation of various aromatic carboxylic acids.
TI  - Non-UV germicidal activity of fresh TiO2 and Ag/TiO2.
AB  - Fresh TiO2 was found to possess a strong germicidal activity even without UV irradiation. Live Yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) cells in contact with fresh TiO2 were found deformed and dead after 15 min contact. The cause of germicidal activity was discussed from the observed cell deformation, lysis and increased absorption at 1680 cm(-1) in FT-IR spectra of the affected cells, which proved the oxidizing effect of fresh TiO2 to cells. The deformation caused by the stretching of cell wall and pressure built-up inside the cell, led to cell burst and release of intracellular materials. The degree of cell deformation was found positively related with the wetting property of TiO2. Cells are negatively charged, for Gram-negative cell (thinner cell wall), a higher germicidal effect was observed than Gram-positive cells. The germicidal effect of TiO2 gradually decreased after exposure to air at room temperature, as the wetting property decreased. This kind of germicidal activity was more effective compared to other germicidal process such as UVA/TiO2 or Ag+. This shed light on designing new germicidal material either maintained by visible light irradiation, or by oxidation effect generated by reactive oxygen species.
TI  - The sigma-factor FliA, ppGpp and DksA coordinate transcriptional control of the aer2 gene of Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - Here the sigma-factor requirement for transcription of three similar, but differentially regulated, aer genes of Pseudomonas putida KT2440 is investigated. Previous work has shown that the three Aer proteins, like chemoreceptors, colocalize to a single pole in a CheA-dependent manner. Lack of Aer2 - the most abundant of these three proteins - mediates defects in metabolism-dependent taxis and aerotaxis, while lack of Aer1 or Aer3 has no apparent phenotype. We show, using wild-type and mutant P. putida derivatives combined with P. putida reconstituted FliA- (sigma(28)) and sigma(70)-dependent in vitro transcription assays, that transcription of aer2 is coupled to motility through the flagella sigma-factor FliA, while sigma(70) is responsible for transcription of aer1 and aer3. By comparing activities of the wild-type and mutant forms of the aer2 promoter, we present evidence (i) that transcription from FliA-dependent Paer2 is enhanced by changes towards the Escherichia coli consensus for FliA promoters rather than towards that of P. putida, (ii) that the nature of the AT-rich upstream region is important for both output and sigma(70) discrimination of this promoter, and (iii) that Paer2 output is directly stimulated by the bacterial alarmone ppGpp and its cofactor DksA.
TI  - Expanding small-molecule functional metagenomics through parallel screening of broad-host-range cosmid environmental DNA libraries in diverse proteobacteria.
AB  - The small-molecule biosynthetic diversity encoded within the genomes of uncultured bacteria is an attractive target for the discovery of natural products using functional metagenomics. Phenotypes commonly associated with the production of small molecules, such as antibiosis, altered pigmentation, or altered colony morphology, are easily identified from screens of arrayed metagenomic library clones. However, functional metagenomic screening methods are limited by their intrinsic dependence on a heterologous expression host. Toward the goal of increasing the small-molecule biosynthetic diversity found in functional metagenomic studies, we report the phenotypic screening of broad-host-range environmental DNA libraries in six different proteobacteria: Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Burkholderia graminis, Caulobacter vibrioides, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas putida, and Ralstonia metallidurans. Clone-specific small molecules found in culture broth extracts from pigmented and antibacterially active clones, as well as the genetic elements responsible for the biosynthesis of these metabolites, are described. The host strains used in this investigation provided access to unique sets of clones showing minimal overlap, thus demonstrating the potential advantage conferred on functional metagenomics through the use of multiple diverse host species.
TI  - TnpR encoded by an ISPpu12 isoform regulates transposition of two different ISL3-like insertion sequences in Pseudomonas stutzeri after conjugative interaction.
AB  - Pseudomonas stutzeri AN10 has two ISL3-like insertion sequences (ISs). One of them has been recently described as ISPst9. In this study we show that the second IS, situated 4.5 kb upstream of ISPst9, is an isoform of ISPpu12 from Pseudomonas putida mt-2. Although both ISL3-like ISs are flanked by nearly identical (21/24 conserved residues) inverted repeats (IRs) and harbor similar transposases (93% amino acid identity), they differ in their accompanying genes. As described for ISPst9, the isoform of ISPpu12 also transposes by a conservative mechanism, forms circular double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) transposition intermediates, and is induced by interaction with the conjugative strain Escherichia coli S17-1lambda(pir) (conjugative interaction) but not with the nonconjugative E. coli DH5alpha. In fact, we demonstrate that ISPst9 transposition after conjugative interaction occurs only when ISPpu12 is present, indicating that ISPpu12 is upregulating transposition of both ISs under such conditions. We also demonstrate that this conjugative interaction-mediated induction of ISPpu12 is not exclusive to the P. stutzeri AN10 strain but is a more general phenomenon, at least in Pseudomonas. Mutation of TnpR, a MerR-like transcriptional regulator present in ISPpu12 but not in ISPst9, reduced the transcription of tnpA (ISPpu12 transposase-encoding gene) and decreased formation of circular dsDNA transposition intermediates after conjugative interaction. Complementation of the TnpR mutant restored the phenotype. In addition, the presence of TnpR in an ISPpu12-free genetic background did not induce ISPst9 after conjugative interaction. Thus, our results suggest that TnpR, after conjugative interaction, activates transcription of tnpA of ISPpu12. Then, TnpA of ISPpu12 would bind to IRs of both ISs, ISPpu12 and ISPst9, causing their transposition.
TI  - Molecular characterization of FinR, a novel redox-sensing transcriptional regulator in Pseudomonas putida KT2440.
AB  - FinR is required for the induction of fpr (ferredoxin-NADP(+) reductase) under superoxide stress conditions in Pseudomonas putida. Many proteobacteria harbour FinR homologues in their genome as a putative LysR-type protein. Three cysteine residues (at positions 150, 239 and 289 in P. putida FinR) are conserved in all FinR homologues. When these conserved cysteines, along with two other cysteine residues present in FinR, were individually mutated to serines, the FinR remained active, unlike SoxR and OxyR in Escherichia coli. The results of our in vitro DNA-binding assay with cellular extracts showed that FinR binds directly to the fpr promoter region. In order to identify the FinR functional domain for sensing superoxide stress, we employed random and site-directed mutagenesis of FinR. Among 18 single amino acid mutants, three mutants (T39A, R194A and E225A) abolished fpr induction without any alteration of their DNA-binding ability, whereas other mutants also abrogated their DNA-binding abilities. Interestingly, two mutants (L215P and D51A) appeared to be constitutively active, regardless of superoxide stress conditions. Ferrous iron depletion, ferric iron addition and fdxA (ferredoxin) gene deletion also participate in the regulation of fpr. These data indicate that FinR has unusual residues for redox sensing and that the redox-sensing mechanism of FinR differs from the well-known mechanisms of OxyR and SoxR.
TI  - Substitution of Glu122 by glutamine revealed the function of the second water molecule as a proton donor in the binuclear metal enzyme creatininase.
AB  - Creatininase is a binuclear zinc enzyme and catalyzes the reversible conversion of creatinine to creatine. It exhibits an open-closed conformational change upon substrate binding, and the differences in the conformations of Tyr121, Trp154, and the loop region containing Trp174 were evident in the enzyme-creatine complex when compared to those in the ligand-free enzyme. We have determined the crystal structure of the enzyme complexed with a 1-methylguanidine. All subunits in the complex existed as the closed form, and the binding mode of creatinine was estimated. Site-directed mutagenesis revealed that the hydrophobic residues that show conformational change upon substrate binding are important for the enzyme activity. We propose a catalytic mechanism of creatininase in which two water molecules have significant roles. The first molecule is a hydroxide ion (Wat1) that is bound as a bridge between the two metal ions and attacks the carbonyl carbon of the substrate. The second molecule is a water molecule (Wat2) that is bound to the carboxyl group of Glu122 and functions as a proton donor in catalysis. The activity of the E122Q mutant was very low and it was only partially restored by the addition of ZnCl(2) or MnCl(2). In the E122Q mutant, k(cat) is drastically decreased, indicating that Glu122 is important for catalysis. X-ray crystallographic study and the atomic absorption spectrometry analysis of the E122Q mutant-substrate complex revealed that the drastic decrease of the activity of the E122Q was caused by not only the loss of one Zn ion at the Metal1 site but also a critical function of Glu122, which most likely exists for a proton transfer step through Wat2.
TI  - Antibacterial and antifungal studies of macrocyclic complexes of trivalent transition metal ions with their spectroscopic approach.
AB  - A new series of complexes of the type [M(C24H16N4)X]X2, where M = Cr(III), Fe(III), and Mn(III), X = Cl-, NO3-, and CH3COO-, has been synthesized by template condensation of 1,8-diaminonaphthalene and glyoxal in the presence of trivalent metal salts in methanolic medium. The complexes have been characterized with the help of elemental analysis, conductance measurements, magnetic measurements, and electronic, NMR, IR, and mass spectral studies. On the basis of these studies, a five-coordinate square pyramidal geometry for all of these complexes has been proposed. All the synthesized metal complexes were also tested for their in vitro antimicrobial activities against some bacterial strains, viz. Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus stearothermophilus (gram-positive bacteria), Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas putida (gram-negative bacteria), and some fungal strains, viz. Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus niger. The results obtained were compared with standard antibiotics: chloramphenicol, streptomycin, and the antifungal drug cyclohexamide. Some of the tested complexes showed remarkable antimicrobial activities.
TI  - New metabolites in dibenzofuran cometabolic degradation by a biphenyl-cultivated  Pseudomonas putida strain B6-2.
AB  - A biphenyl (BP)-utilizing bacterium, designated B6-2, was isolated from soil and  identified as Pseudomonas putida. BP-grown B6-2 cells were capable of transforming dibenzofuran (DBF) via a lateral dioxygenation and meta-cleavage pathway. The ring cleavage product 2-hydroxy-4-(3'-oxo-3'H-benzofuran-2'-yliden)but-2-enoic acid (HOBB) was detected as a major metabolite. B6-2 growing cells could also cometabolically degrade DBF using BP as a primary substrate. A recombinant Escherichia coli strain DH10B (pUC118bphABC) expressing BP dioxygenase, BP-dihydrodiol dehydrogenase, and dihydroxybiphenyl dioxygenase was shown to be capable of transforming DBF to HOBB. Using purified HOBB that was produced by the recombinant as the substrate for B6-2, we newly identified a series of benzofuran derivatives as metabolites. The structures of these metabolites indicate that an unreported HOBB degradation pathway is employed by strain B6-2. In this pathway, HOBB is proposed to be transformed to 2-oxo-4-(3'-oxobenzofuran-2'-yl)butanoic acid and 2-hydroxy-4-(3'-oxobenzofuran-2'-yl)butanoic acid (D4) through two sequential double-bond hydrogenation steps. D4 is suggested to undergo reactions including decarboxylation and oxidation to produce 3-(3'-oxobenzofuran-2'-yl)propanoic acid (D6). 3-Hydroxy-3-(3'-oxobenzofuran-2'-yl)propanoic acid (D7) and 2-(3'-oxobenzofuran-2'-yl)acetic acid (D8) would represent metabolites involved in the processes of beta- and alpha-oxidation of D6, respectively. D7 and D8 are suggested to be transformed to their respective products 3-hydroxy-2,3-dihydrobenzofuran-2-carboxylic acid (D10) and 2-(3'-hydroxy-2',3'-dihydrobenzofuran-2'-yl)acetic acid. D10 is proposed to be transformed to salicylic acid (D14) via 2,3-dihydro-2,3-dihydroxybenzofuran, 2-oxo-2-(2'-hydroxyphenyl)acetic acid and 2-hydroxy-2-(2'-hydroxyphenyl)acetic acid. Further experimental results revealed that B6-2 was capable of growing with D14 as the sole carbon source. Because benzofuran derivatives may have biological, pharmacological, and toxic properties, the elucidation of this new pathway should be significant from both biotechnological and environmental views.
TI  - Bacterial ammeline metabolism via guanine deaminase.
AB  - Melamine toxicity in mammals has been attributed to the blockage of kidney tubules by insoluble complexes of melamine with cyanuric acid or uric acid. Bacteria metabolize melamine via three consecutive deamination reactions to generate cyanuric acid. The second deamination reaction, in which ammeline is the substrate, is common to many bacteria, but the genes and enzymes responsible have not been previously identified. Here, we combined bioinformatics and experimental data to identify guanine deaminase as the enzyme responsible for this biotransformation. The ammeline degradation phenotype was demonstrated in wild-type Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas strains, including E. coli K12 and Pseudomonas putida KT2440. Bioinformatics analysis of these and other genomes led to the hypothesis that the ammeline deaminating enzyme was guanine deaminase. An E. coli guanine deaminase deletion mutant was deficient in ammeline deaminase activity, supporting the role of guanine deaminase in this reaction. Two guanine deaminases from disparate sources (Bradyrhizobium japonicum USDA 110 and Homo sapiens) that had available X-ray structures were purified to homogeneity and shown to catalyze ammeline deamination at rates sufficient to support bacterial growth on ammeline as a sole nitrogen source. In silico models of guanine deaminase active sites showed that ammeline could bind to guanine deaminase in a similar orientation to guanine, with a favorable docking score. Other members of the amidohydrolase superfamily that are not guanine deaminases were assayed in vitro, and none had substantial ammeline deaminase activity. The present study indicated that widespread guanine deaminases have a promiscuous activity allowing them to catalyze a key reaction in the bacterial transformation of melamine to cyanuric acid and potentially contribute to the toxicity of melamine.
TI  - [Integration and expression of polyphosphate kinase gene in Pseudomonas putida].
AB  - In order to construct high accumulating-phosphate microorganism, the ppk gene from E. coli was inserted to the broad-host-range plasmid pBBR1MCS-2 to form plasmid pBBR1MCS-2-ppk. The complete ppk gene with promoter and terminator sequences from pBBR1MCS-2-ppk was then cloned and inserted to suicide plasmid pUTmini-Tn5 to form plasmid pUTmini-Tn5-ppk, which was transformed into Pseudomonas putida KT2440 by triparental conjugation. Finally, ppk gene was integrated into the chromosomal DNA of KT2440. The results of RT-PCR showed that the selected genetically engineered bacterium KT2440-PPK expressed ppk efficiently, while KT2440 as control expressed weakly. The results of artificial wastewater treatment showed after 1h inoculation, the concentration of poly-phosphate in KT2440-PPK came to the maximum approximately 3.05 mg/g, which was 15 times higher than that in KT2440 at the same experimental condition. And KT2440-PPK can remove more than 90% phosphate in artificial wastewater.
TI  - Antimicrobial effect of silver-impregnated cellulose: potential for antimicrobial therapy.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Silver has long been known to have antimicrobial activity. To incorporate this property into multiple applications, a silver-impregnated cellulose (SIC) with low cytotoxicity to human cells was developed. SIC differs from other silver treatment methods in that the leaching of silver particles is non-existent and the release of ionic silver is highly controlled. RESULTS: Candida albicans, Micrococcus luteu, Pseudomonas putida, and Escherichia coli were used for antimicrobial testing. No microbial cells were able to grow in the presence of SIC at concentrations above 0.0035 Ag w/v %. Even at a concentration of 0.00035 Ag w/v %, P. putida and M. luteu failed to grow, and C. albicans and E. coli exhibited diminished growth. To determine the cytotoxic effect of silver on human cells, five different concentrations of SIC were tested on human fibroblasts. In SIC concentrations of 0.035 Ag w/v % and below, no cytotoxicity was observed. CONCLUSION: The optimal concentration of SIC for a broad range of anti-microbial activity and low or negligible cytotoxicity was 0.0035 Ag w/v %. Although the highly controlled releasing characteristics of SIC would prove a substantial improvement over current technologies, further investigation for genotoxicity and other biocompatibility test will be required.
TI  - Identification and characterization of the metal ion-dependent L-alanoyl-D-glutamate peptidase encoded by bacteriophage T5.
AB  - Although bacteriophage T5 is known to have lytic proteins for cell wall hydrolysis and phage progeny escape, their activities are still unknown. This is the first report on the cloning, expression and biochemical characterization of a bacteriophage T5 lytic hydrolase. The endolysin-encoding lys gene of virulent coliphage T5 was cloned in Escherichia coli cells, and an electrophoretically homogeneous product of this gene was obtained with a high yield (78% of total activity). The protein purified was shown to be an L-alanoyl-D-glutamate peptidase. The enzyme demonstrated maximal activity in diluted buffers (25-50 mM) at pH 8.5. The enzyme was strongly inhibited by EDTA and BAPTA, and fully reactivated by calcium/manganese chlorides. It was found that, along with E. coli peptidoglycan, peptidase of bacteriophage T5 can lyse peptidoglycans of other Gram-negative microorganisms (Pectobacterium carotovorum, Pseudomonas putida, Proteus vulgaris, and Proteus mirabilis). This endolysin is the first example of an L-alanoyl-D-glutamate peptidase in a virulent phage infecting Gram-negative bacteria. There are, however, a great many sequences in databases that are highly similar to that of bacteriophage T5 hydrolase, indicating a wide distribution of endolytic L-alanoyl-D-glutamate peptidases. The article discusses how an enzyme with such substrate specificity could be fixed in the process of evolution.
TI  - Integrated bioprocessing for the pH-dependent production of 4-valerolactone from  levulinate in Pseudomonas putida KT2440.
AB  - Enzymes are powerful biocatalysts capable of performing specific chemical transformations under mild conditions, yet as catalysts they remain subject to the laws of thermodynamics, namely, that they cannot catalyze chemical reactions beyond equilibrium. Here we report the phenomenon and application of using extracytosolic enzymes and medium conditions, such as pH, to catalyze metabolic pathways beyond their intracellular catalytic limitations. This methodology, termed "integrated bioprocessing" because it integrates intracellular and extracytosolic catalysis, was applied to a lactonization reaction in Pseudomonas putida for the economical and high-titer biosynthesis of 4-valerolactone from the inexpensive and renewable source levulinic acid. Mutant paraoxonase I (PON1) was expressed in P. putida, shown to export from the cytosol in Escherichia coli and P. putida using an N-terminal sequence, and demonstrated to catalyze the extracytosolic and pH-dependent lactonization of 4-hydroxyvalerate to 4-valerolactone. With this production system, the titer of 4-valerolactone was enhanced substantially in acidic medium using extracytosolically expressed lactonase versus an intracellular lactonase: from <0.2 g liter(-1) to 2.1 +/- 0.4 g liter(-1) at the shake flask scale. Based on these results, the production of 4-hydroxyvalerate and 4-valerolactone was examined in a 2-liter bioreactor, and titers of 27.1 g liter(-1) and 8.2 g liter(-1) for the two respective compounds were achieved. These results illustrate the utility of integrated bioprocessing as a strategy for enabling production from novel metabolic pathways and enhancing product titers.
TI  - Micro-scale water potential gradients visualized in soil around plant root tips using microbiosensors.
AB  - Water availability and movement in soil are critical determinants of resource availability to, and interactions among, members of the soil community. However, it has been impossible to observe gradients in soil water potential empirically at millimetre spatial scales. Here we describe progress towards that goal using output from two microbial biosensors, Pantoea agglomerans BRT98/pPProGreen and Pseudomonas putida KT2442/pPProGreen, engineered with a reporter system based on the osmotically sensitive proU promoter from Escherichia coli. The proU-GFP construct in both microbiosensors produced green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a function total water potential in nonsterile soil. Controlled experiments in liquid culture showed that dramatically different microbiosensor growth rates (resulting from exposure to different salts as osmolytes) did not alter the GFP output as a function of water potential in either sensor, but P. agglomerans' GFP levels at a given water potential were strongly influenced by the type of carbon (energy) source available to the microbes. In non-sterile rhizosphere soil along Zea mays L. roots, though GFP expression was quite variable, microbiosensors reported statistically significantly more negative soil water potentials as a function of axial distance from root tips, reflecting the gradient in soil water potential hypothesized to develop during transpiration.
TI  - Phosphoproteomic analysis reveals the multiple roles of phosphorylation in pathogenic bacterium Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - Recent phosphoproteomic characterizations of Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Lactococcus lactis, Pseudomonas putida, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa have suggested that protein phosphorylation on serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues is a major regulatory post-translational modification in bacteria. In this study, we carried out a global and site-specific phosphoproteomic analysis on the Gram-positive pathogenic bacterium Streptococcus pneumoniae. One hundred and two unique phosphopeptides and 163 phosphorylation sites with distributions of 47%/44%/9% for Ser/Thr/Tyr phosphorylations from 84 S. pneumoniae proteins were identified through the combined use of TiO(2) enrichment and LC-MS/MS determination. The identified phosphoproteins were found to be involved in various biological processes including carbon/protein/nucleotide metabolisms, cell cycle and division regulation. A striking characteristic of S. pneumoniae phosphoproteome is the large number of multiple species-specific phosphorylated sites, indicating that high level of protein phosphorylation may play important roles in regulating many metabolic pathways and bacterial virulence.
TI  - Production of aromatic compounds in bacteria.
AB  - The aromatic class of chemicals includes a large number of industrially important products. In bacteria and plants, the shikimate pathway and related biosynthetic pathways are a source of aromatic compounds having commercial value. Bacterial strains for the production of aromatic compounds from simple carbon sources as raw material have been generated by applying metabolic engineering and random/combinatorial strategies that modify central metabolism, aromatic biosynthetic pathways, transport, and regulatory functions. These strategies are complemented with heterologous gene expression and protein engineering. Engineered Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida strains are enabling the development of sustainable processes for the manufacture of 2-phenylethanol, p-hydroxycinnamic acid, p-hydroxystyrene, p-hydroxybenzoate, anthranilate, and cyclohexadiene-transdiols, among other useful chemicals.
TI  - Carbon nanotube clusters as universal bacterial adsorbents and magnetic separation agents.
AB  - The magnetic susceptibility and high bacterial affinity of carbon nanotube (CNT)  clusters highlight their great potential as a magnetic bio-separation agent. This article reports the CNT clusters' capability as "universal" bacterial adsorbents and magnetic separation agents by designing and testing a multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWNT) cluster-based process for bacterial capturing and separation. The reaction system consisted of large clusters of MWNTs for bacterial capture and an external magnet for bio-separation. The designed system was tested and optimized using Escherichia coli as a model bacterium, and further generalized by testing the process with other representative strains of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. For all strains tested, bacterial adsorption to MWNT clusters occurred spontaneously, and the estimated MWNT clusters' adsorption capacities were nearly the same regardless of the types of strains. The bacteria-bound MWNT clusters also responded almost instantaneously to the magnetic field by a rare-earth magnet (0.68 Tesla), and completely separated from the bulk aqueous phase and retained in the system. The results clearly demonstrate their excellent potential as highly effective "universal" bacterial adsorbents for the spontaneous adsorption of any types of bacteria to the clusters and as paramagnetic complexes for the rapid and highly effective magnetic separations.
TI  - Expression, purification, crystallization and preliminary X-ray analysis of para-nitrophenol 4-monooxygenase from Pseudomonas putida DLL-E4.
AB  - Para-nitrophenol 4-monooxygenase (PnpA) plays an important role in bacterial degradation of para-nitrophenol by oxidative release of the nitro group from the aromatic ring to form p-benzoquinone. In order to understand the structural basis of the function of this enzyme, PnpA was cloned, expressed in Escherichia coli and purified. PnpA was crystallized by the hanging-drop vapour-diffusion technique with PEG 4000 as precipitant. The PnpA crystals belonged to space group P2(1)2(1)2(1), with unit-cell parameters a = 54.47, b = 77.56, c = 209.17 A, and diffracted to 2.24 A resolution.
TI  - Microbial utilization of the industrial wastewater pollutants 2-ethylhexylthioglycolic acid and iso-octylthioglycolic acid by aerobic gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Industrial wastewater from the production of sulfur containing esters and the resulting products of this synthesis, 2-ethylhexylthioglycolic acid (EHTG) and iso-octylthioglycolic acid (IOTG), were deployed in this study to enrich novel bacterial strains, since no wastewater and EHTG or IOTG degrading microorganisms were hitherto described or available. In addition, nothing is known about the biodegradation of these thiochemicals. The effect of this specific wastewater on the growth behaviour of microorganisms was investigated using three well-known Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas putida, and Ralstonia eutropha). Concentrations of 5% (v/v) wastewater in complex media completely inhibited growth of these three bacterial strains. Six bacterial strains were successfully isolated, characterized and identified by sequencing their 16S rRNA genes. Two isolates referred to as Achromobacter sp. strain MT-E3 and Pseudomonas sp. strain MT-I1 used EHTG or IOTG, respectively, as well as the wastewater as sole source of carbon and energy for weak growth. More notably, both isolates removed these sulfur containing esters in remarkable amounts from the cultures supernatant. One further isolate was referred to as Klebsiella sp. strain 58 and exhibited an unusual high tolerance against the wastewater's toxicity without utilizing the contaminative compounds. If cultivated with gluconic acid as additional carbon source, the strain grew even in presence of more than 40% (v/v) wastewater. Three other isolates belonging to the genera Bordetella and Pseudomonas tolerated these organic sulfur compounds but showed no degradation abilities.
TI  - The Escherichia coli rhamnose promoter rhaP(BAD) is in Pseudomonas putida KT2440  independent of Crp-cAMP activation.
AB  - We developed an expression vector system based on the broad host range plasmid pBBR1MCS2 with the Escherichia coli rhamnose-inducible expression system for applications in Pseudomonas. For validation and comparison to E. coli, enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) was used as a reporter. For further characterization, we also constructed plasmids containing different modifications of the rhaP(BAD) promoter. Induction experiments after the successful transfer of these plasmids into Pseudomonas putida KT2440 wild-type and different knockout strains revealed significant differences. In Pseudomonas, we observed no catabolite repression of the rhaP(BAD) promoter, and in contrast to E. coli, the binding of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) receptor protein (Crp)-cAMP to this promoter is not necessary for induction as shown by deletion of the Crp binding site. The crp(-) mutant of P. putida KT2440 lacked eGFP expression, but this is likely due to problems in rhamnose uptake, since this defect was complemented by the insertion of the L-rhamnose-specific transporter rhaT into its genome via transposon mutagenesis. Other global regulators like Crc, PtsN, and CyoB had no or minor effects on rhamnose-induced eGFP expression. Therefore, this expression system may also be generally useful for Pseudomonas and other gamma-proteobacteria.
TI  - Metabolomics data exploration guided by prior knowledge.
AB  - In metabolomics research, it is often important to focus the data analysis to specific areas of interest within the metabolome. In this paper, we describe the application of consensus principal component analysis (CPCA) and canonical correlation analysis (CCA) as a means to explore the relation between metabolome data and (i) biochemically related metabolites and (ii) an amino acid biosynthesis pathway. CPCA searches for major trends in the behavior of metabolite concentrations that are in common for the metabolites of interest and the remainder of the metabolome. CCA identifies the strongest correlations between the metabolites of interest and the remainder of the metabolome. CPCA and CCA were applied to two different microbial metabolomics data sets. The first data set, derived from Pseudomonas putida S12, was relatively simple as it contained metabolomes obtained under four environmental conditions only. The second data set, obtained from Escherichia coli, was much more complex as it consisted of metabolomes obtained under 28 different environmental conditions. In case of the simple and coherent P. putida S12 data set, CCA and CPCA gave similar results as the variation in the subset of the selected metabolites and the remainder of the metabolome was similar. In contrast, CCA and CPCA yielded different results in case of the E. coli data set. With CPCA the trends in the selected subset--the phenylalanine biosynthesis pathway--dominated the results. The main trends were related to high and low phenylalanine productivity, and the metabolites showing a similar behavior in concentration were metabolites regulating the phenylalanine biosynthesis route in the subset and metabolites related to general amino acid metabolism in the remainder of the metabolome. With CCA, neither subset truly dominated the data analysis. CCA described the differences between the wild type and the overproducing strain and the differences between the succinate and glucose grown cells. For the difference between the wild type and the overproducing strain, metabolites from the beginning and the end of aromatic amino acid pathways like erythrose-4-phosphate, tryptophan, and phenylalanine were important for the selected metabolites. CCA and CPCA proved to be complementary data analysis tools that enable the focusing of the data analysis on groups of metabolites that are of specific interest in relation to the remainder of the metabolome. Compared to an ordinary PCA, focusing the data analysis on biologically relevant metabolites lead especially for the complex E. coli data to a better biological interpretation of the data.
TI  - A cytochrome P450 class I electron transfer system from Novosphingobium aromaticivorans.
AB  - Cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes of the CYP101 and CYP111 families from Novosphingobium aromaticivorans are heme monooxygenases that catalyze the hydroxylation of a range of terpenoid compounds. CYP101D1 and CYP101D2 oxidized camphor to 5-exo-hydroxycamphor. CYP101B1 and CYP101C1 oxidized beta-ionone to predominantly 3-R-hydroxy-beta-ionone and 4-hydroxy-beta-ionone, respectively. CYP111A2 oxidized linalool to 8-hydroxylinalool. Physiologically, these CYP enzymes could receive electrons from Arx, a [2Fe-2S] ferredoxin equivalent to putidaredoxin from the CYP101A1 system from Pseudomonas putida. A putative ferredoxin reductase (ArR) in the N. aromaticivorans genome, with high amino acid sequence homology to putidaredoxin reductase, has been over-produced in Escherichia coli and found to support substrate oxidation by these CYP enzymes via Arx with both high activity and coupling of product formation to NADH consumption. The ArR/Arx electron-transport chain has been co-expressed with the CYP enzymes in an E. coli host to provide in vivo whole-cell substrate oxidation systems that could produce up to 6.0 g L(-1) of 5-exo-hydroxycamphor at rates of up to 64 microM (gram of cell dry weight)(-1) min(-1). These efficient biocatalytic systems have potential uses in preparative scale whole-cell biotransformations.
TI  - Distinct roles for NtrC and GlnK in nitrogen regulation of the Pseudomonas sp. strain ADP cyanuric acid utilization operon.
AB  - The Pseudomonas sp. strain ADP atzDEF operon encodes the enzymes involved in cyanuric acid mineralization, the final stage of the s-triazine herbicide atrazine degradative pathway. We have previously shown that atzDEF is under nitrogen control in both its natural host and Pseudomonas putida KT2442. Expression of atzDEF requires the divergently encoded LysR-type transcriptional regulator AtzR. Here, we take advantage of the poor induction of atzDEF in Escherichia coli to identify Pseudomonas factors involved in nitrogen control of atzDEF expression. Simultaneous production of P. putida NtrC and GlnK, along with AtzR, restored the normal atzDEF regulatory pattern. Gene expression analysis in E. coli and P. putida indicated that NtrC activates atzR expression, while the role of GlnK is to promote AtzR activation of atzDEF under nitrogen limitation. Activation of atzDEF in a mutant background deficient in GlnK uridylylation suggests that post-translational modification is not strictly required for transduction of the nitrogen limitation signal to AtzR. The present data and our previous results are integrated in a regulatory circuit that describes all the known responses of the atzDEF operon.
TI  - Biological activity studies on metal complexes of novel tridentate Schiff base ligand. Spectroscopic and thermal characterization.
AB  - Metal complexes of novel Schiff base (HL) ligand, prepared via condensation of 4-aminoantipyrine and 2-aminophenol, are prepared. The ligand is characterized based on elemental analysis, mass, IR and (1)H NMR spectra. Metal complexes are reported and characterized based on elemental analyses, IR, (1)H NMR, solid reflectance, magnetic moment, molar conductance, ESR spectra and thermal analyses (TG, DTG and DTA). From the elemental analyses, 1:1 [M]:[ligand] complexes are prepared with the general formulae [M(L)Cl(H(2)O)(2)] x yH(2)O (M = Mn(II), Co(II), Ni(II), Cu(II), Zn(II) and Cd(II), y = 3-4), [Fe(L)Cl(2)(H(2)O)] x 3 H(2)O and [Th(L)Cl(H(2)O)(2)]Cl(2) x 3 H(2)O. The molar conductance data reveal that all the metal chelates are non-electrolytes (except Th(IV) complex, it is 2:1 electrolyte). IR spectra show that HL is coordinated to the metal ions in a uninegatively tridentate manner with NNO donor sites of the azomethine-N, amino N and deprotonated phenolic-O. From the magnetic and solid reflectance spectra, it is found that the geometrical structures of these complexes are octahedral. The thermal behaviour of these chelates shows that the hydrated complexes losses water molecules of hydration in the first step followed immediately by decomposition of the anions and ligand molecules in the subsequent steps. The activation thermodynamic parameters are calculated from the DTG curves using Coats-Redfern method. The synthesized ligand, in comparison to its metal complexes is screened for its antibacterial activity against bacterial species, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas putida, Exiguobacterium acetylicum and Bacillus simplex. The activity data show that the metal complexes to be more potent/antibacterial than the parent Schiff base ligand against one or more bacterial species.
TI  - Transverse bacterial migration induced by chemotaxis in a packed column with structured physical heterogeneity.
AB  - The significance of chemotaxis in directing bacterial migration toward contaminants in natural porous media was investigated under groundwater flow conditions. A laboratory-scale column, with a coarse-grained sand core surrounded by a fine-grained annulus, was used to simulate natural aquifers with strata of different hydraulic conductivities. A chemoattractant source was placed along the central axis of the column to model contaminants trapped in the heterogeneous subsurface. Chemotactic bacterial strains, Escherichia coli HCB1 and Pseudomonas putida F1, introduced into the column by a pulse injection, were found to alter their transport behaviors under the influence of the attractant chemical emanating from the central source. For E. coil HCB1, approximately 18% more of the total population relative to the control without attractant exited the column from the coarse sand layer due to the chemotactic effects of alpha-methylaspartate under an average fluid velocity of 5.1 m/d. Although P. putida F1 demonstrated no observable changes in migration pathways with the model contaminant acetate under the same flow rate, when the flow rate was reduced to 1.9 m/d, approximately 6-10% of the population relative to the control migrated from the fine sand layer toward attractant into the coarse sand layer. Microbial transport properties were further quantified by a mathematical model to examine the significance of bacterial motility and chemotaxis under different hydrodynamic conditions, which suggested important considerations for strain selection and practical operation of bioremediation schemes.
TI  - Quorum sensing inhibition activity of garlic extract and p-coumaric acid.
AB  - AIMS: The goal of this work was to investigate the influence of DMSO, garlic extract and p-coumaric acid on bacterial quorum sensing (QS). METHODS AND RESULTS: The decreases in the QS responses of QS reporter strains Escherichia coli pSB401 and pSB536, Agrobacterium tumefaciens NTL4, Chromobacterium violaceum 5999 and wt 494, Pseudomonas putida IsoF/gfp and environmental Pseudomonas chlororaphis were quantified in relation to growth inhibitory effects. DMSO showed no significant QS-specific effects on the strains tested even at close-to-lethal concentrations. Garlic extracts antagonized the activity of QS receptors LuxR, AhyR and TraR, but were toxic at higher concentrations. P-coumaric acid fully inhibited QS responses of 5999, NTL4 and P. chlororaphis, with no influence on cell viability. CONCLUSIONS: The quorum sensing inhibition activity of garlic was extended to novel receptors, and p-coumaric acid was found to possess previously undescribed QS antagonist properties. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The results suggest that p-coumaric acid might act as QS inhibitor. Further studies are required to understand its role in the regulation of QS and investigate structurally related compounds.
TI  - Rational design of catechol-2, 3-dioxygenase for improving the enzyme characteristics.
AB  - Catechol-2, 3-dioxygenase (C23O) from Pseudomonas sp. CGMCC2953 identified in our laboratory, which is one of the key enzymes responsible for phenanthrene biodegradation, was expected to get better characteristics tolerant to environment for its further application. With the aim of improving the enzyme properties by introducing intermolecular disulfide bonds, X-ray structure of a C23O from Pseudomonas putida MT-2, a highly conserved homologous with the C23O from Pseudomonas sp. CGMCC2953, was directly used to find the potential sites for forming disulfide bonds between two monomers of the target C23O. Two sites, Ala229 and His294, were identified and mutated to cysteine, respectively, by using site mutagenesis. The expected disulfide bond between these two CYS residues was confirmed with both molecular modeling and experimental results. The optimum temperature of the mutated enzyme was widened from 40 to 40 approximately 50 degrees C. The mutated C23O became more alkalescency stable compared with the wild-type enzyme, e.g., 75% of the maximal enzyme activity retained even under pH 9.5 while 50% residue for the wild-type one. Improvement of thermostability of the mutated C230 with the redesigned disulfide was also confirmed.
TI  - Improved phosphate biosorption by bacterial surface display of phosphate-binding  protein utilizing ice nucleation protein.
AB  - The conventional enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR) system often deteriorates at low chemical oxygen demand (COD) or under aeration conditions. A new approach that incorporates phosphate-eutrophic wastewater remediation was introduced through immobilization of an intracellular phosphate-binding protein (PBP) onto the surface of Pseudomonas putida or Escherichia coli, using the N-terminal anchor (InaQ-N) of a newly identified ice nucleation protein from Pseudomonas syringae. A green fluorescent protein-fusion protein was expressed and used to confirm surface localization. The PBP was then targeted to the surface of E. coli JM109 and P. putida AB92019. The engineered P. putida and E. coli microorganisms were capable of absolute biosorption of total phosphates at rates of 60 and 80 mg L(-1), respectively, over 5 h. In the recombinant P. putida cells, a surface-immobilized PBP fusion that had three tandemly repeated InaQ-Ns exhibited the maximum increment in phosphate biosorption, at sixfold compared with the control strain. Even heat-killed recombinant cells of either P. putida or E. coli retained substantial biosorptive activities. The current study demonstrates that the bacterial surface display of PBP should be considered as a strong contender for generating organisms capable of functioning in EBPR systems under low COD, resulting in improved removal of eutrophic phosphorus from wastewaters.
TI  - Intra- and interspecies conjugal transfer of Tn916-like elements from Lactococcus lactis in vitro and in vivo.
AB  - Tetracycline-resistant Lactococcus lactis strains originally isolated from Polish raw milk were analyzed for the ability to transfer their antibiotic resistance genes in vitro, using filter mating experiments, and in vivo, using germfree rats. Four of six analyzed L. lactis isolates were able to transfer tetracycline resistance determinants in vitro to L. lactis Bu2-60, at frequencies ranging from 10(-5) to 10(-7) transconjugants per recipient. Three of these four strains could also transfer resistance in vitro to Enterococcus faecalis JH2-2, whereas no transfer to Bacillus subtilis YBE01, Pseudomonas putida KT2442, Agrobacterium tumefaciens UBAPF2, or Escherichia coli JE2571 was observed. Rats were initially inoculated with the recipient E. faecalis strain JH2-2, and after a week, the L. lactis IBB477 and IBB487 donor strains were introduced. The first transconjugants were detected in fecal samples 3 days after introduction of the donors. A subtherapeutic concentration of tetracycline did not have any significant effect on the number of transconjugants, but transconjugants were observed earlier in animals dosed with this antibiotic. Molecular analysis of in vivo transconjugants containing the tet(M) gene showed that this gene was identical to tet(M) localized on the conjugative transposon Tn916. Primer-specific PCR confirmed that the Tn916 transposon was complete in all analyzed transconjugants and donors. This is the first study showing in vivo transfer of a Tn916-like antibiotic resistance transposon from L. lactis to E. faecalis. These data suggest that in certain cases food lactococci might be involved in the spread of antibiotic resistance genes to other lactic acid bacteria.
TI  - Enzyme-assisted physicochemical enantioseparation processes-Part III: Overcoming  yield limitations by dynamic kinetic resolution of asparagine via preferential crystallization and enzymatic racemization.
AB  - The application of enantioseparation methods alone can only yield up to 50% of the desired chiral product. Thus enantioseparation becomes more attractive when accompanied by the racemization of the counter-enantiomer. Here we present first results of dynamic kinetic resolution of L-asparagine (L-Asn) via preferential crystallization and enzymatic racemization from a racemic, supersaturated solution on a 20 mL scale. An enzyme lyophilisate (WT amino acid racemase from P. putida KT2440 (E.C. 5.1.1.10), overexpressed in E. coli BL21(DE3)) was used for in situ racemization (enzyme concentrations varying from 0 to 1 mg/mL). When preferential crystallization was applied without any enzyme, a total of 31 mg of L-Asn monohydrate could be crystallized, before crystal formation of d-Asn started. Crystallization experiments accompanied by enzymatic racemization led to a significant increase of crystallized L-Asn (198 mg L-Asn monohydrate; >92%ee) giving the first experimental proof for this new process concept of dynamic kinetic resolution via preferential crystallization and enzymatic racemization. Measurements of the racemase activity before and after the crystallization process showed no significant differences, which would allow for enzyme recovery and recycling.
TI  - Bacterial attraction and quorum sensing inhibition in Caenorhabditis elegans exudates.
AB  - Caenorhabditis elegans, a bacterivorous nematode, lives in complex rotting fruit, soil, and compost environments, and chemical interactions are required for mating, monitoring population density, recognition of food, avoidance of pathogenic microbes, and other essential ecological functions. Despite being one of the best-studied model organisms in biology, relatively little is known about the signals that C. elegans uses to interact chemically with its environment or as defense. C. elegans exudates were analyzed by using several analytical methods and found to contain 36 common metabolites that include organic acids, amino acids, and sugars, all in relatively high abundance. Furthermore, the concentrations of amino acids in the exudates were dependent on developmental stage. The C. elegans exudates were tested for bacterial chemotaxis using Pseudomonas putida (KT2440), a plant growth promoting rhizobacterium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PAO1), a soil bacterium pathogenic to C. elegans, and Escherichia coli (OP50), a non-motile bacterium tested as a control. The C. elegans exudates attracted the two Pseudomonas species, but had no detectable antibacterial activity against P. aeruginosa. To our surprise, the exudates of young adult and adult life stages of C. elegans exudates inhibited quorum sensing in the reporter system based on the LuxR bacterial quorum sensing (QS) system, which regulates bacterial virulence and other factors in Vibrio fischeri. We were able to fractionate the QS inhibition and bacterial chemotaxis activities, thus demonstrating that these activities are chemically distinct. Our results demonstrate that C. elegans can attract its bacterial food and has the potential of partially regulating the virulence of bacterial pathogens by inhibiting specific QS systems.
TI  - MrdH, a novel metal resistance determinant of Pseudomonas putida KT2440, is flanked by metal-inducible mobile genetic elements.
AB  - We report here the identification and characterization of mrdH, a novel chromosomal metal resistance determinant, located in the genomic island 55 of Pseudomonas putida KT2440. It encodes for MrdH, a predicted protein of approximately 40 kDa with a chimeric domain organization derived from the RcnA and RND (for resistance-nodulation-cell division) metal efflux proteins. The metal resistance function of mrdH was identified by the ability to confer nickel resistance upon its complementation into rcnA mutant (a nickel- and cobalt-sensitive mutant) of Escherichia coli. However, the disruption of mrdH in P. putida resulted in an increased sensitivity to cadmium and zinc apart from nickel. Expression studies using quantitative reverse transcription-PCR showed the induction of mrdH by cadmium, nickel, zinc, and cobalt. In association with mrdH, we also identified a conserved hypothetical gene mreA whose encoded protein showed significant homology to NreA and NreA-like proteins. Expression of the mreA gene in rcnA mutant of E. coli enhanced its cadmium and nickel resistance. Transcriptional studies showed that both mrdH and mreA underwent parallel changes in gene expression. The mobile genetic elements Tn4652 and IS1246, flanking mrdH and mreA were found to be induced by cadmium, nickel, and zinc, but not by cobalt. This study is the first report of a single-component metal efflux transporter, mrdH, showing chimeric domain organization, a broad substrate spectrum, and a location amid metal-inducible mobile genetic elements.
TI  - NtrC-dependent regulatory network for nitrogen assimilation in Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - Pseudomonas putida KT2440 is a model strain for studying bacterial biodegradation processes. However, very little is known about nitrogen regulation in this strain. Here, we show that the nitrogen regulatory NtrC proteins from P. putida and Escherichia coli are functionally equivalent and that substitutions leading to partially active forms of enterobacterial NtrC provoke the same phenotypes in P. putida NtrC. P. putida has only a single P(II)-like protein, encoded by glnK, whose expression is nitrogen regulated. Two contiguous NtrC binding sites located upstream of the sigma(N)-dependent glnK promoter have been identified by footprinting analysis. In vitro experiments with purified proteins demonstrated that glnK transcription was directly activated by NtrC and that open complex formation at this promoter required integration host factor. Transcription of genes orthologous to enterobacterial codB, dppA, and ureD genes, whose transcription is dependent on sigma(70) and which are activated by Nac in E. coli, has also been analyzed for P. putida. Whereas dppA does not appear to be regulated by nitrogen via NtrC, the codB and ureD genes have sigma(N)-dependent promoters and their nitrogen regulation was exerted directly by NtrC, thus avoiding the need for Nac, which is missing in this bacterial species. Based upon these results, we propose a simplified nitrogen regulatory network in P. putida (compared to that in enterobacteria), which involves an indirect-feedback autoregulation of glnK using NtrC as an intermediary.
TI  - Variations in MIC value caused by differences in experimental protocol.
AB  - The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of an antibiotic for a microorganism quantifies the effectiveness in reducing growth or the bactericidal ability of the compound. Measurements of MIC's carried out using different protocols should be comparable. Several of the factors that influence the outcome of the measurement vary between protocols. Variations in the MIC estimate were examined for E. coli and amoxicillin as well as tetracycline and for Pseudomonas putida and enrofloxacin. Duration of the measurement, density of the starting culture, the use of optical density or cell counts to determine growth and the induction of resistance can cause differences of a factor of up to 8 in the MIC value. While this does not hamper the reporting of trends by researchers adhering to the same protocol, it may affect assessments based on the absolute value of the MIC of a given combination of microorganism and antibiotic.
TI  - Effect of cell-surface hydrophobicity on bacterial conversion of water-immiscible chemicals in two-liquid-phase culture systems.
AB  - The effect of bacterial cell-surface hydrophobicity on the bioconversion of water-immiscible chemicals in an aqueous-organic (A/O) two-liquid-phase culture system was investigated. Escherichia coli JM109 and Rhodococcus opacus B-4 were used as hydrophilic and hydrophobic whole-cell catalysts, respectively. Hydroxylation reactions of monoaromatics, including toluene (log P(ow)=2.9), ethylbenzene (3.1), n-propylbenzene (3.4), and sec-butylbenzene (3.7), were employed as model conversions. When the todC1C2BA genes encoding Pseudomonas putida toluene dioxygenase were expressed in E. coli JM109, the yield of hydroxylated monoaromatics decreased with increasing substrate hydrophobicity. By contrast, R. opacus transformants, which expressed the todC1C2BA genes, showed high performance in the hydroxylation of monoaromatics, irrespective of substrate hydrophobicity. When the R. opacus transformants were examined for their ability to hydroxylate monoaromatics in an aqueous single-liquid-phase culture, the reaction velocity was markedly lower than that observed in the A/O two-liquid-phase culture. These results suggested that R. opacus B-4 accessed the hydrophobic substrates in the oil phase, thus making it more effective for the bioconversion reactions.
TI  - Regioselective biooxidation of (+)-valencene by recombinant E. coli expressing CYP109B1 from Bacillus subtilis in a two-liquid-phase system.
AB  - BACKGROUND: (+)-Nootkatone (4) is a high added-value compound found in grapefruit juice. Allylic oxidation of the sesquiterpene (+)-valencene (1) provides an attractive route to this sought-after flavoring. So far, chemical methods to produce (+)-nootkatone (4) from (+)-valencene (1) involve unsafe toxic compounds, whereas several biotechnological approaches applied yield large amounts of undesirable byproducts. In the present work 125 cytochrome P450 enzymes from bacteria were tested for regioselective oxidation of (+)-valencene (1) at allylic C2-position to produce (+)-nootkatone (4) via cis- (2) or trans-nootkatol (3). The P450 activity was supported by the co-expression of putidaredoxin reductase (PdR) and putidaredoxin (Pdx) from Pseudomonas putida in Escherichia coli. RESULTS: Addressing the whole-cell system, the cytochrome CYP109B1 from Bacillus subtilis was found to catalyze the oxidation of (+)-valencene (1) yielding nootkatol (2 and 3) and (+)-nootkatone (4). However, when the in vivo biooxidation of (+)-valencene (1) with CYP109B1 was carried out in an aqueous milieu, a number of undesired multi-oxygenated products has also been observed accounting for approximately 35% of the total product. The formation of these byproducts was significantly reduced when aqueous-organic two-liquid-phase systems with four water immiscible organic solvents - isooctane, n-octane, dodecane or hexadecane - were set up, resulting in accumulation of nootkatol (2 and 3) and (+)-nootkatone (4) of up to 97% of the total product. The best productivity of 120 mg l-1 of desired products was achieved within 8 h in the system comprising 10% dodecane. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that the identification of new P450s capable of producing valuable compounds can basically be achieved by screening of recombinant P450 libraries. The biphasic reaction system described in this work presents an attractive way for the production of (+)-nootkatone (4), as it is safe and can easily be controlled and scaled up.
TI  - Metagenomics reveals diversity and abundance of meta-cleavage pathways in microbial communities from soil highly contaminated with jet fuel under air-sparging bioremediation.
AB  - The extradiol dioxygenase diversity of a site highly contaminated with aliphatic  and aromatic hydrocarbons under air-sparging treatment was assessed by functional screening of a fosmid library in Escherichia coli with catechol as substrate. The 235 positive clones from inserts of DNA extracted from contaminated soil were equivalent to one extradiol dioxygenase-encoding gene per 3.6 Mb of DNA screened, indicating a strong selection for genes encoding this function. Three subfamilies were identified as being predominant, with 72, 55 and 43 fosmid inserts carrying genes, related to those encoding TbuE of Ralstonia pickettii PK01 (EXDO-D), IpbC of Pseudomonas sp. JR1 (EXDO-K2) or DbtC of Burkholderia sp. DBT1 (EXDO-Dbt), respectively, whereas genes encoding enzymes related to XylE of Pseudomonas putida mt-2 were not observed. Genes encoding oxygenases related to isopropylbenzene dioxygenases were usually colocalized with genes encoding EXDO-K2 dioxygenases. Functional analysis of representative proteins indicated a subcluster of EXDO-D proteins to show exceptional high affinity towards different catecholic substrates. Based on V(max)/K(m) specificity constants, a task-sharing between different extradiol dioxygenases in the community of the contaminated site can be supposed, attaining a complementary and community-balanced catalytic power against diverse catecholic derivatives, as necessary for effective degradation of mixtures of aromatics.
TI  - In vitro evolution of styrene monooxygenase from Pseudomonas putida CA-3 for improved epoxide synthesis.
AB  - The styAB genes from Pseudomonas putida CA-3, which encode styrene monooxygenase, were subjected to three rounds of in vitro evolution using error-prone polymerase chain reaction with a view to improving the rate of styrene oxide and indene oxide formation. Improvements in styrene monooxygenase activity were monitored using an indole to indigo conversion assay. Each round of random mutagenesis generated variants improved in indigo formation with third round variants improved nine- to 12-fold over the wild type enzyme. Each round of in vitro evolution resulted in two to three amino acid substitutions in styrene monooxygenase. While the majority of mutations occurred in styA (oxygenase), mutations were also observed in styB (reductase). A mutation resulting in the substitution of valine with isoleucine at amino acid residue 303 occurred near the styrene and flavin adenine dinucleotide binding site of styrene monooxygenase. One mutation caused a shift in the reading frame in styA and resulted in a StyA variant that is 19 amino acids longer than the wild-type protein. Whole cells expressing the best styrene monooxygenase variants (round 3) exhibited eight- and 12-fold improvements in styrene and indene oxidation rates compared to the wild-type enzyme. In all cases, a single enantiomer, (S)-styrene oxide, was formed from styrene while (1S,2R)-indene oxide was the predominant enantiomer (e.e. 97%) formed from indene. The average yield of styrene oxide and indene oxide from their respective alkene substrates was 65% and 90%, respectively.
TI  - Discovery of 2-naphthoic acid monooxygenases by genome mining and their use as biocatalysts.
AB  - The large pool of cytochrome P450 (P450) open-reading frames identified in genome sequences has attracted much attention as a resource for new oxidation biocatalysts. P450 genes were cloned from genome-sequenced bacteria and coexpressed with putidaredoxin and its reductase genes to provide the redox partners of P450 in Escherichia coli. Whole-cell assays were performed with 2-naphthoic acid as a substrate. Hydroxylated naphthoic acid products were rapidly detected with two reagents showing different colors in the presence of the products. Two P450s, CYP199A1 and CYP199A2, were found to hydroxylate the substrate to 7- and 8-hydroxy-2-naphthoic acids. The CYP199A1 whole-cell biocatalyst converted 1 mM 2-naphthoic acid to 0.27 mM 7-hydroxy-2-naphthoic acid and 0.53 mM 8-hydroxy-2-naphthoic acid. CYP199A2 exhibited similar regioselectivity to CYP199A1. Furthermore, we found that 8-hydroxy-2-naphthoic acid emits near-white fluorescence when exposed to UV light. These P450s will provide a facile and environmentally friendly synthetic approach to the hydroxynaphthoic acids.
TI  - Competition triggers plasmid-mediated enhancement of substrate utilisation in Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - Competition between species plays a central role in the activity and structure of communities. Stable co-existence of diverse organisms in communities is thought to be fostered by individual tradeoffs and optimization of competitive strategies along resource gradients. Outside the laboratory, microbes exist as multispecies consortia, continuously interacting with one another and the environment. Survival and proliferation of a particular species is governed by its competitive fitness. Therefore, bacteria must be able to continuously sense their immediate environs for presence of competitors and prevailing conditions. Here we present results of our investigations on a novel competition sensing mechanism in the rhizosphere-inhabiting Pseudomonas putida KT2440, harbouring gfpmut3b-modified Kan(R) TOL plasmid. We monitored benzyl alcohol (BA) degradation rate, along with GFP expression profiling in mono species and dual species cultures. Interestingly, enhanced plasmid expression (monitored using GFP expression) and consequent BA degradation were observed in dual species consortia, irrespective of whether the competitor was a BA degrader (Pseudomonas aeruginosa) or a non-degrader (E. coli). Attempts at elucidation of the mechanistic aspects of induction indicated the role of physical interaction, but not of any diffusible compounds emanating from the competitors. This contention is supported by the observation that greater induction took place in presence of increasing number of competitors. Inert microspheres mimicking competitor cell size and concentration did not elicit any significant induction, further suggesting the role of physical cell-cell interaction. Furthermore, it was also established that cell wall compromised competitor had minimal induction capability. We conclude that P. putida harbouring pWW0 experience a competitive stress when grown as dual-species consortium, irrespective of the counterpart being BA degrader or not. The immediate effect of this stress is a marked increase in expression of TOL, leading to rapid utilization of the available carbon source and massive increase in its population density. The plausible mechanisms behind the phenomenon are hypothesised and practical implications are indicated and discussed.
TI  - Detection of pyrogens adsorbed to intraocular lenses: evaluation of limulus amoebocyte lysate and in vitro pyrogen tests.
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine the ability of the limulus amoebocyte lysate (LAL) assay and the in vitro pyrogen test (IPT) to detect pyrogens adsorbed to intraocular lenses (IOLs). SETTING: Berlin Eye Research Institute, Berlin, Germany. METHODS: Fifteen of each of the following IOLs were used: MicroSil MS 612 ASP, AcrySof SA60AT, Superflex, Sensar, XACT, and LS-106 IOLs. The challenge organism suspensions were 10(3) CFU/mL and 10(4) CFU/mL Escherichia coli, 10(3) CFU/mL and 10(4) CFU/mL Pseudomonas putida, and 10(5) CFU/mL and 10(6) CFU/mL Staphylococcus epidermidis. Two IOLs of each model were incubated at room temperature for at least 2 days in 0.6 mL of 1 of the suspensions. They were then gamma sterilized. The extract of 1 IOL was tested with the LAL assay; the other IOL was tested with the IPT. RESULTS: The LAL was negative for all incubated IOLs. The IPT was positive for all IOLs incubated in E coli and P putida suspensions, with the MicroSil MS 612 ASP, AcrySof SA60AT, XACT, and LS-106 IOLs showing a severe reaction. The Superflex and Sensar IOLs had a slight to moderate response for lower bacterial concentrations and a moderate to severe response for higher concentrations. For S epidermidis, all IOLs showed a slight IPT response except XACT IOLs, which showed a nonpyrogenic response. CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate that the LAL test may fail to detect pyrogens adsorbed to IOLs and the IPT reliably detects pyrogens with a dose-dependent response. This has relevance in the investigation of toxic anterior segment syndrome outbreaks.
TI  - Genotoxic and antibutyrylcholinesterasic activities of acid violet 7 and its biodegradation products.
AB  - Acid violet 7, a sulfonated azo dye was degraded by Pseudomonas putida mt-2 in mineral medium at concentrations up to 200 mg/L. The genotoxicity of AV7 and its biodegradation extracts was evaluated by using the DNA-strand scission assay. No genotoxicity was observed, even with or without exposition to UV irradiation, for biodegradation under shaking conditions, but increased significantly after biodegradation under static conditions. In addition, the ability of tested compounds to reduce human plasma butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) activity was evaluated in vitro. Genotoxicity and anti-BuChE activity generated by the azoreduction products [4'-aminoacetanilid (4'-AA) and 5-acetamido-2-amino-1-hydroxy-3,6-naphtalene disulfonic acid (5-ANDS)] were assessed and compared with that of the parent unsubstituted amines. 4'-AA exhibited a strong genotoxicity, which was imputed to the presence of the acetoxy (COCH3) substituent on the aromatic amine; however, the presence of sulphonic groups in 5-ANDS seems to be responsible for its BuChE inhibition activity. The present study demonstrates that P. putida mt-2, incubated under aerobic conditions, has a catabolism that enables it to degrade AV7 and, especially, to detoxify the dye mixtures.
TI  - Characterization of an unusual LOV domain protein in the alpha-proteobacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides.
AB  - The facultatively phototrophic purple bacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides 2.4.1 harbors a LOV (light, oxygen and voltage) domain protein, which shows a particular structure. LOV domains perceive blue light by a noncovalently bound flavin and transmit the signal to various coupled output domains. Proteins, that harbor a LOV core, function e.g. as phototropins or circadian clock regulators. Jalpha helices, which act as linker between the LOV core and the output domain, were shown to be involved in the light-dependent activation of the output domain. Like PpSB2 from Pseudomonas putida, the LOV domain protein of R. sphaeroides is not coupled to an effector domain and harbors an extended C-terminal alpha helix. We expressed the R. sphaeroides LOV domain recombinantly in Escherichia coli. The protein binds an FMN as a cofactor and shows a photocycle typical for LOV domain containing proteins. In R. sphaeroides, we detected the protein as well in the cytoplasm as in the membrane fraction, which was not reported for other bacterial LOV domain proteins.
TI  - Siccanin rediscovered as a species-selective succinate dehydrogenase inhibitor.
AB  - To identify antibiotics targeting to respiratory enzymes, we carried out matrix screening of a structurally varied natural compound library with Pseudomonas aeruginosa membrane-bound respiratory enzymes. We identified a succinate dehydrogenase inhibitor, siccanin (IC(50), 0.9 microM), which is a potent antibiotic against some pathogenic fungi like Trichophyton mentagrophytes and inhibits their mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase. We found that siccanin was effective against enzymes from P. aeruginosa, P. putida, rat and mouse mitochondria but ineffective or less effective against Escherichia coli, Corynebacterium glutamicum, and porcine mitochondria enzyme. Action mode was mixed-type for quinone-dependent activity and noncompetitive for succinate-dependent activity, indicating the proximity of the inhibitor-binding site to the quinone-binding site. Species-selective inhibition by siccanin is unique among succinate dehydrogenase inhibitors, and thus siccanin is a potential lead compound for new chemotherapeutics.
TI  - Preparation, physicochemical characterization and biological evaluation of cefodizime metal ion complexes.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Cefodizime is a broad spectrum cephalosporin belonging to the third generation agents. In this study, attention has been paid to the preparation, physicochemical characterization and biological evaluation of new Cu2+, Zn2+, Fe3+, Co2+ and Al3+ complexes of cefodizime. METHODS: The stoichiometrics and the mode of bonding of the complexes were deduced from their elemental and metal analysis, electrical conductivity measurements, UV-vis, infrared and Raman spectroscopic investigations. Study of the stoichiometry of these complexes referred to the formation of 1 : 1 ratios of metal to ligand. Antimicrobial activity of the complexes was determined using two strains of Gram-positive (Bacillus subtilis and Proteus vulgaris) and two strains of Gram-negative (Escherichia coli W3110 and Pseudomonas putida) bacteria. The minimal inhibitory concentration was determined as the lowest concentration inhibiting bacterial growth on solid Luria Bertani medium. KEY FINDINGS: The spectra gave evidence as to the position of binding. In addition, the aqueous solubility of cefodizime was strongly reduced by complexation. CONCLUSIONS: The antibacterial activity of cefodizime was not affected by complexation with Al3+ but it was reduced by complexation with the other tested metal ions against the bacteria under study.
TI  - Investigation of steric and functionality limits in the enzymatic dihydroxylation of benzoate esters. Versatile intermediates for the synthesis of pseudo-sugars, amino cyclitols, and bicyclic ring systems.
AB  - A series of benzoate esters (methyl, ethyl, n-Pr, i-Pr, n-Bu, t-Bu, allyl, and propargyl) were subjected to enzymatic dihydroxylation by E. coli JM 109(pDTG 601) strain in a whole-cell fermentation. The cis-cyclohexadienediols were obtained in yields of approximately 1g/L except for n-propyl- and i-propyl benzoate which were found to be poor substrates. n-Butyl and t-butyl benzoates were not oxidized at all. The absolute stereochemistry for all metabolites was determined by comparison with a standard prepared from (1S-cis)-3-bromo-3,5-cyclohexadiene-1,2-diol, whose absolute configuration is well established. The free diols were found to be quite stable compared to other cis-dihydrodiols of this type, however, their acetonides underwent a dimerization via a regio- and stereoselective Diels-Alder cycloaddition. The diol derived from ethyl benzoate was subjected to a stereo- and regioselective inverse electron demand Diels-Alder cycloadditions with several dienophiles. The new adducts were completely characterized. The hetero-Diels-Alder reaction of this diol with an acyl nitroso dienophile yielded regio- and stereoselectively a bicyclic oxazine, which upon reduction provided a useful derivative of amino shikimate that can be exploited in an approach to oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and other amino cyclitols. The diol was also converted to carba-alpha-L-galactopyranose to demonstrate its potential utility as a source of pseudo sugars. Experimental and spectral data are provided for all new compounds.
TI  - Inactivation of the Pseudomonas putida KT2440 dsbA gene promotes extracellular matrix production and biofilm formation.
AB  - To identify genes essential to biofilm formation in Pseudomonas putida KT2440, 12 mutants defective in oxidative stress-related or metabolic pathway-related genes were evaluated. Of them, only the dsbA mutant lacking the disulfide bond isomerase exhibited significantly increased attachment to the polystyrene surface. Visual evaluation by extracellular matrix staining and scanning electron microscopy indicated that the KT2440-DeltadsbA strain displays enhanced extracellular matrix production, rugose colony morphology on agar plates and floating pellicles in static culture. Accordingly, we propose that deletion of the dsbA gene may stimulate production of the extracellular matrix, resulting in those phenotypes. In addition, the lack of detectable fluorescence in the KT2440-DeltadsbA under UV light as well as in both the wild type and the KT2440-DeltadsbA when grown on Luria-Bertani plates containing ferrous iron suggests that the fluorescent molecule may be a fluorescent siderophore with its synthesis/secretion controlled by DsbA in KT2440. These phenotypic defects observed in the dsbA mutant were complemented by the full-length KT2440 and Escherichia coli dsbA genes. In contrast to the role of DsbA in other bacteria, our results provide the first evidence that disruption of P. putida KT2440 dsbA gene overproduces the extracellular matrix and thus promotes biofilm formation.
TI  - Engineering alternative butanol production platforms in heterologous bacteria.
AB  - Alternative microbial hosts have been engineered as biocatalysts for butanol biosynthesis. The butanol synthetic pathway of Clostridium acetobutylicum was first re-constructed in Escherichia coli to establish a baseline for comparison to other hosts. Whereas polycistronic expression of the pathway genes resulted in the production of 34 mg/L butanol, individual expression of pathway genes elevated titers to 200 mg/L. Improved titers were achieved by co-expression of Saccharomyces cerevisiae formate dehydrogenase while overexpression of E. coli glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase to elevate glycolytic flux improved titers to 580 mg/L. Pseudomonas putida and Bacillus subtilis were also explored as alternative production hosts. Polycistronic expression of butanol biosynthetic genes yielded butanol titers of 120 and 24 mg/L from P. putida and B. subtilis, respectively. Production in the obligate aerobe P. putida was dependent upon expression of bcd-etfAB. These results demonstrate the potential of engineering butanol biosynthesis in a variety of heterologous microorganisms, including those cultivated aerobically.
TI  - Tricistronic overexpression of cytochrome P450cam, putidaredoxin, and putidaredoxin reductase provides a useful cell-based catalytic system.
AB  - The catalytic turnover of cytochrome P450( cam ) from Pseudomonas putida requires two auxiliary reduction partners, putidaredoxin (Pd) and putidaredoxin reductase (PdR). We report the functional expression in Escherichia coli of tricistronic constructs consisting of P450( cam ) encoded by the first cistron and the auxiliary proteins, Pd and PdR by the second and the third. Transformed bacterial whole cells efficiently oxidized (1R)-(+)-camphor to 5-exo-hydroxycamphor and, interestingly, limonene to (-)-perillyl alcohol. These bioengineered E. coli cells possess a heterologous self-sufficient P450 catalytic system that may have advantages in terms of low cost and high yield for the production of fine chemicals.
TI  - Straining phenomena in bacteria transport through natural porous media.
AB  - BACKGROUND, AIM, AND SCOPE: Transport of bacteria through natural porous media is an issue of increasing concern arising in several very important environmental processes. These include the percolation of bacteria from fecal waste to drinking water reservoirs, thus leading to a risk for human health, or the bioremediation of contaminated soils in which the bacteria are expected to travel long distances underground in order to reach contaminated areas and degrade chemicals originating from accidental spills. An understanding of bacterial retention and transport mechanisms in porous media would be of great help in the development of models able to predict the distance covered by bacterial suspensions in these situations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Experiments were carried out preparing columns filled of soil and sand, introducing bacteria culture (Escherichia coli, Pseudomona putida, and Listeria innocua) solutions by the top of the column. Breakthrough curves were obtained to see the transport of the bacteria in the column. RESULTS: The transport of different bacteria in the two soils aimed at establishing the relative importance of straining in different conditions. This has enabled us to obtain certain parameters, such as the sticking coefficients derived from the filtration theory or bacterial recoveries after multi-step elution, which aid our understanding of how bacteria are retained by mechanisms different to those usually included in the physico-chemical filtration theory. DISCUSSION: Several indicators may be used to determine the degree of relevance of straining as a mechanism acting during bacterial transport through porous media. Usually, in natural media, neither straining nor physico-chemical filtration is the sole mechanism contributing to bacterial retention. The retention of bacteria by straining mechanisms can be assessed by means of elution profiles under varying conditions. The inversion of flow in our experiments gave rise to secondary elution peaks, probably originating from bacteria retained in narrow pores CONCLUSIONS: According to experimental observations, straining was shown to contribute highly to bacterial retention in all the soils tested, in particular in the soils with a broader grain size distribution and more irregular shape. In both media, an increase in ionic strength did not lead to significant differences in bacterial retention, possibly due to the lack of relevance of ionic repulsion as a barrier to physico-chemical attachment of particles RECOMMENDATION AND PERSPECTIVES: The study of bacteria transport in natural soil is an important step in the development of decontamination processes. The importance of the straining in the transport process has been revealed in the work carried out in this paper.
TI  - Affinity capillary electrophoresis with magnetic beads for multiplex quantitative analysis of bacterial 16S rRNA.
AB  - We have developed a novel method for microbial community analysis of bacterial 16S rRNAs based on affinity capillary electrophoresis using 16S rRNA-conjugated magnetic beads. We called this method magnetic beads affinity capillary electrophoresis (MB-ACE) which can be used for sequential and quantitative analysis of 16S rRNA. In this method, RNA extracted from a microbial community is biotin-modified and mixed with streptavidin-modified paramagnetic beads. This mixture is then injected into a capillary and localized in the middle of the capillary using a magnet held adjacent to the capillary. Subsequently, a fluorescent-labeled probe to detect the target 16S rRNA is injected into the capillary, and voltage is applied. The probe trapped on the RNA is dissociated by formamide and detected at its anodic end by measuring the fluorescence. Next, another fluorescent probe is injected, and thus the target 16S rRNA in the sample is quantified one by one. MB-ACE was used for the quantification of the 16S rRNAs of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida in samples that were prepared by mixing RNA extracted from activated sludge and 16S rRNAs prepared by in vitro transcription. The two types of 16S rRNAs were quantified, indicating that MB-ACE can be used for sequential quantitative analysis of bacterial 16S rRNAs.
TI  - Microbial production of 4-hydroxybutyrate, poly-4-hydroxybutyrate, and poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-4-hydroxybutyrate) by recombinant microorganisms.
AB  - 4-Hydroxybutyrate (4HB) was produced by Aeromonas hydrophila 4AK4, Escherichia coli S17-1, or Pseudomonas putida KT2442 harboring 1,3-propanediol dehydrogenase gene dhaT and aldehyde dehydrogenase gene aldD from P. putida KT2442 which are capable of transforming 1,4-butanediol (1,4-BD) to 4HB. 4HB containing fermentation broth was used for production of homopolymer poly-4-hydroxybutyrate [P(4HB)] and copolymers poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-4-hydroxybutyrate) [P(3HB-4HB)]. Recombinant A. hydrophila 4AK4 harboring plasmid pZL-dhaT-aldD containing dhaT and aldD was the most effective 4HB producer, achieving approximately 4 g/l 4HB from 10 g/l 1,4-BD after 48 h of incubation. The strain produced over 10 g/l 4HB from 20 g/l 1,4-BD after 52 h of cultivation in a 6-L fermenter. Recombinant E. coli S17-1 grown on 4HB containing fermentation broth was found to accumulate 83 wt.% of intracellular P(4HB) in shake flask study. Recombinant Ralstonia eutropha H16 grew to over 6 g/l cell dry weight containing 49 wt.% P(3HB-13%4HB) after 72 h.
TI  - Production, purification, and characterization of soluble NADH-flavin Oxidoreductase (StyB) from Pseudomonas putida SN1.
AB  - In recombinant strains, many proteins and enzymes are expressed as inactive and insoluble inclusion bodies. For soluble expression of an active form of StyB, an NADHflavin oxidoreductase, several recombinant Escherichia coli strains were developed and tested. Among them, strain BL21(DE3)pLysS effectively produced an active and soluble form of StyB as about 9% of the total protein content, when cultivated at 20 degrees with 0.5 mM IPTG. The solubly expressed StyB has the highest oxidoreductase activity at pH 6.5-7.5 and 37 degrees . Substrate dependence profiles of the StyB-catalyzed reaction showed that the maximum specific activity (Vm) and half saturation constant (Km) were 1,867+/-148 U/mg protein and 51.6+/-11 microM for NADH, and 1,274+/-34 U/mg protein and 8.2+/-1.2 microM for FAD, respectively. This indicates that solubly produced StyB has 6- to 9-fold higher oxidoreductase activities than the in vitro refolded StyB from inclusion bodies.
TI  - A facile one-pot green synthesis and antibacterial activity of 2-amino-4H-pyrans  and 2-amino-5-oxo-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-4H-chromenes.
AB  - A facile one-pot expeditious synthesis of 2-amino-4H-pyrans and 2-amino-5-oxo-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-4H-chromenes has been described under solvent-free conditions using magnesium oxide as a catalyst in very good yields. The reaction catalyst, magnesium oxide was reused and recycled without any loss of activity and product yield. All the synthesized compounds were screened for in vitro antibacterial activity, and compounds 3a, 3b, 3f, 4b, 4c, 4d, 4e and 4g showed complete inhibition of bacterial growth at 128 microg/mL or less and the rest of the compounds exhibited incomplete inhibition.
TI  - Linear alkylbenzene sulfonate tolerance in bacteria isolated from sediment of tropical water bodies polluted with detergents.
AB  - The discharge of untreated detergent-bearing waste introduces linear alklcylbenzene sulfonates (LAS) to the aquatic environment. The surfactant persists in some streams and rivers in Nigeria, some is adsorbed to suspended materials and end in the sediment of the receiving water bodies. In this study, bacteria isolated from sediments of some tropical detergent-effluent-polluted streams were tested for tolerance to LAS using the media dilution technique. LAS-tolerance was indicated by growth of the bacteria in the presence of the surfactant. The pH, concentrations of surfactant, population of heterotrophic bacteria and population of LAS-tolerant bacteria in the sediments were determined. A direct relationship (r = 0.9124) was found between the alkaline conditions (pH= 8.2-12.0) and high surfactant concentrations (45-132 mg/g) in the sediment. The sediments harboured a high population and a wide variety of bacteria; the populations of viable heterotrophic bacteria (VHB: 2.9 x 10(5) to 1.2 x 10(7) cfu/g) and LAS tolerant bacteria (LTB: 1.5 x 10(4) to 1.2 x 10(6) cfu/g) had a direct relationship (r = 0.9500). An inverse relationship resulted between each of them and the concentration of surfactant in the sediment, r(VHB/LAS) = -0.9303 and r(LTB/LAS) = -0.9143, respectively. Twelve bacteria species were isolated from the sediment: Alcaligenes odorans, Bacillus subtilis, Burkholderia cepacia, Citrobacter freundii, Citrobacter diversus, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, Micrococcus albus, Pseudomonas putida, Pseudomonas stutzeri, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcusfaecalis. Most of them were adapted to the surfactant with their maximum acceptable concentrations ranging between 0.03 and >1.0% (w/v). The sediments could serve as source of adapted organisms which can be used in bio-treatment of LAS-bearing waste.
TI  - A novel nicotine catabolic plasmid pMH1 in Pseudomonas sp. strain HF-1.
AB  - Attempts were made to acquire a plasmid-loss mutant via various methods (spontaneous mutation, SDS, and mitomycin C), among which the method involving mitomycin C (10 microg/mL) has been proven successful. Concomitant with the loss of the plasmid in Pseudomonas sp. strain HF-1, the cured derivative was identified as having a nicotine-negative (Nic-) phenotype, named mutant strain 6-13 (Nic-). After plasmids were transferred from strain HF-1 (named plasmid pMH1) to the mutant strain 6-13, the mutant strain acquired nicotine-degrading ability, called 6-13 transformant (Nic+). There were no differences in growth or nicotine-degrading efficiency between strain HF-1 (wild-type strain) and strain 6-13 transformant. After pMH1 was transferred to Escherichia coli strain Top10 (Nic-), a distant relative of Pseudomonas, it also gained nicotine-degrading ability, showing the highest nicotine degradation efficiency at pH 7.0, the optimal pH for growth of E. coli. The hsp gene, which encodes 6-hydroxy-3-succinoylpyridine hydroxylase, is involved in nicotine degradation in Pseudomonas putida strain S16 and was present in pMH1 but not in pAO1, the well-known nicotine degradation plasmid in Arthrobacter nicotinovorans. It was demonstrated that plasmid pMH1 is a novel nicotine-degrading plasmid.
TI  - Genetic and biochemical analyses of chlorobenzene degradation gene clusters in Pandoraea sp. strain MCB032.
AB  - Pandoraea sp. strain MCB032 was isolated as an emerging chlorobenzene degrader from a functionally stable bioreactor where species succession had occurred. In this study, two gene clusters encoding chlorobenzene metabolic functions have been cloned. Within the cbs gene cluster, CbsA and CbsB are similar to the chlorobenzene dioxygenase and the cis-chlorobenzene dihydrodiol dehydrogenase in Ralstonia sp. JS705 and shown to transform chlorobenzene to 3-chlorocatechol. The clc gene cluster shows strong similarity to the clc genes of Ralstonia sp. JS705 and encodes chlorocatechol 1,2-dioxygenase (ClcA) and other enzymes, which catalyze the conversion of chlorocatechol to 3-oxoadipate. The Michaelis constants (K (m)) values of ClcA for catechol, 3-methylcatechol and 3-chlorocatechol were determined as 10.0, 8.9 and 3.4 muM, respectively. CbsX, a putative transport protein present in the cbs cluster of strain MCB032 but not in those of other chlorobenzene degraders, shows 76 and 53% identities to two previously identified transport proteins involved in toluene degradation, TbuX from Ralstonia pickettii PKO1 and TodX from Pseudomonas putida F1. The presence of the transport protein in strain MCB032 likely provides a mechanistic explanation for its higher chlorobenzene affinity and may well be the basis for the competitive advantage of this strain in the bioreactor.
TI  - Heterologous production of polyketides in bacteria.
AB  - Polyketide natural products are among the most important microbial metabolites in human medicine and are widely used to treat both acute and degenerative diseases. The need to develop new drugs has prompted the idea of using heterologous systems for the expression of polyketide biosynthetic pathways. The basic idea behind this approach is to use heterologous bacterial systems with better growth and genetic characteristics that could support better production of a certain compound than the original host or that could allow the generation of novel analogues through combinatorial biosynthesis. Moreover, these hosts could be used to express "cryptic" secondary metabolic pathways or serve as surrogate hosts in metagenomics experiments in order to find potential new bioactive compounds. In this chapter we discuss recent advances in the heterologous production of polyketides in bacteria and describe some methodological improvements of the systems.
TI  - Characterization of a cryptic plasmid pSFKW33 from Shewanella sp. 33B.
AB  - A cryptic plasmid pSFKW33 from psychrotrophic bacterium Shewanella sp. 33B, an isolate from the Gulf of Gdansk (the Baltic Sea), was sequenced and characterized. It is an 8021bp circular molecule with 38% GC content, which shows a distinctive nucleotide sequence without homology to other known plasmids. The nucleotide sequence analysis predicts eight open reading frames. The deduced amino acid sequence of ORF-1 shared significant similarity with the phage integrase protein from Pseudomonas putida GB-1. The ORF2 product showed some similarity with the hypothetical protein Shal_1786 from Shewanella halifaxensis HAW-EB4. The ORF-3 product revealed high amino acid sequence homology with the Escherichia coli replication initiation protein similar to pi protein of R6K plasmid. Five repeat regions (three perfect 22-bp repeats and two imperfect motifs), a putative ribosome binding site, and -10 and -35 promotor sequences were identified upstream of the ORF-3 (rep). The rep module is very similar to several theta replicating iteron family plasmids, suggesting that pSFKW33 replication follows the same course. The ORF-5 product revealed significant identity with the entry exclusion protein 1 of plasmid pIS2 from enteropathogenic strain E. coli 0111:H. The ORF-6 product showed significant identity with the putative transcriptional regulator protein from Shewanella benthica KT99 belonging to HTH-XRE-family protein. The ORF-8 encoded protein that showed some similarity with the hypothetical protein KT99_00146 from Shewanella benthica KT99. The ORF-4 and ORF-7 encoded putative proteins of 189 and 118 amino acid residues, respectively, with no homologies to any known proteins. The absolute copy number of pSFKW33 was estimated to be five copies per chromosome by real-time PCR.
TI  - Increased diversity of predacious Bdellovibrio-like organisms (blos) as a function of eutrophication in Kumaon Lakes of India.
AB  - Predation by Bdellovibrio-like organisms (BLOs) results in bacterial community succession in aquatic ecosystems. The effects of nutrient loading on the distribution and phylogeny of BLOs remain largely unknown. To this end, we present our findings on BLO diversity from four north-Indian lakes that are variable in their trophic status; Nainital is eutrophic, both, Bhimtal and Naukuchiatal are mesotrophic and Sattal remains oligotrophic, respectively. Initially, total heterotrophic bacteria and BLOs were quantified by most probable number (MPN) analyses using Pseudomonas putida and Escherichia coli as prey bacteria. Total bacterial numbers were at least two-logs higher in the eutrophic lake samples compared with oligotrophic lake. Similarly, BLO numbers were approximately 39-fold higher using Pseudomonas sp., which is likely the preferred prey within these lakes. Conversely, significant differences were not observed between mesotrophic and oligotrophic BLO numbers when E. coli was used as the prey. PCR-RFLP of small subunit rDNA (SSU rDNA) of BLOs, followed by cloning, sequencing, and taxonomic categorization revealed distinct differences such that, eutrophic lake consisted of higher BLO diversity compared with mesotrophic and oligotrophic lake, most likely due to both, higher numbers and availability of a diverse population of prey bacteria resulting from nutrient loading in this ecosystem.
TI  - Microbial conversion of glucose to a novel chemical building block, 2-pyrone-4,6-dicarboxylic acid.
AB  - 2-Pyrone-4,6-dicarboxylic acid (PDC) is a catabolic intermediate in Sphingobium sp. SYK-6 (previously characterized as Sphingomonas paucimobilis SYK-6), which is a degrader of lignin-derived aromatic compounds. Recently, PDC has been also characterized as a novel starting material for several potentially useful synthetic polymers. In a previous study, we constructed a biosynthetic system in which PDC was generated efficiently from a chemically synthesized compound, protocatechuate. In order to develop an alternative system for production of PDC, we tried to generate it from glucose, which is a low-cost sugar that can be obtained from abundant cellulosic wastes and biomass crops. We designed a metabolic bypass to PDC from the shikimate pathway in recombinant Escherichia coli cells. PDC accumulated in the medium of recombinant E. coli cells that had been transformed with genes isolated from Emericella niger, E. coli, Pseudomonas putida, and Sphingobium sp. SYK-6. The yield of PDC depended on the combination of genes that we introduced into the cells and on the specific of host strain. Under optimal conditions, the yield and titer of PDC were, respectively, 17.3% and 0.35 mg/l when the concentration of glucose was 2 g/l and the culture volume was 50 ml. Our results open up the possibility of novel utilization of biomass as the source of a useful chemical building block.
TI  - Expression of arginine deiminase from Pseudomonas plecoglossicida CGMCC2039 in Escherichia coli and its anti-tumor activity.
AB  - Arginine deiminase (ADI), an arginine-degrading enzyme, has been studied as a potential anti-cancer agent in clinical trials for the treatment of arginine-auxotrophic tumors, such as hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) and melanomas. The arcA gene encoding ADI was cloned from a recently isolated strain Pseudomonas plecoglossicida CGMCC2039. The nucleotide sequence of ADI comprises an ORF of 1,254 bp encoding 417 amino acids. The deduced ADI protein sequence has a calculated molecular weight of 46.5 kDa and shows 97% and 85% identity to ADIs from P. putida and P. aeruginosa, respectively. The arcA from P. plecoglossicida CGMCC2039 was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 with a N-terminal His6-tag, and purified to homogeneity. A molecular mass of approximate 49 kDa was confirmed by SDS-PAGE analysis and specific activity was determined to be 4.76 U/mg (pH 6.0 and 37 degrees C). In vivo activity study showed that the rADI could effectively inhibit H22 tumor growth at a total dose of 5 U/mouse over a 2-week dosing period.
TI  - Cloning, expression, characterization, and biocatalytic investigation of the 4-hydroxyacetophenone monooxygenase from Pseudomonas putida JD1.
AB  - While the number of available recombinant Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenases (BVMOs)  has grown significantly over the last few years, there is still the demand for other BVMOs to expand the biocatalytic diversity. Most BVMOs that have been described are dedicated to convert efficiently cyclohexanone and related cyclic aliphatic ketones. To cover a broader range of substrate types and enantio- and/or regioselectivities, new BVMOs have to be discovered. The gene encoding a BVMO identified in Pseudomonas putida JD1 converting aromatic ketones (HAPMO; 4-hydroxyacetophenone monooxygenase) was amplified from genomic DNA using SiteFinding-PCR, cloned, and functionally expressed in Escherichia coli. Furthermore, four other open reading frames could be identified clustered around this HAPMO. It has been suggested that these proteins, including the HAPMO, might be involved in the degradation of 4-hydroxyacetophenone. Substrate specificity studies revealed that a large variety of other arylaliphatic ketones are also converted via Baeyer-Villiger oxidation into the corresponding esters, with preferences for para-substitutions at the aromatic ring. In addition, oxidation of aldehydes and some heteroaromatic compounds was observed. Cycloketones and open-chain ketones were not or poorly accepted, respectively. It was also found that this enzyme oxidizes aromatic ketones such as 3-phenyl-2-butanone with excellent enantioselectivity (E >>100).
TI  - Cyclopropane fatty acids are involved in organic solvent tolerance but not in acid stress resistance in Pseudomonas putida DOT-T1E.
AB  - Bacterial membranes constitute the first physical barrier against different environmental stresses. Pseudomonas putida DOT-T1E accumulates cyclopropane fatty acids (CFAs) in the stationary phase of growth. In this strain the cfaB gene encodes the main cyclopropane synthase responsible of the synthesis of CFAs, and its expression is mediated by RNA polymerase with sigma factor sigma(38). We generated a cfaB mutant of P. putida DOT-T1E and studied its response to solvents, acid pH and other stress conditions such as temperature changes, high osmolarity and the presence of antibiotics or heavy metals in the culture medium. A CfaB knockout mutant was more sensitive to solvent stress than the wild-type strain, but in contrast to Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica, the P. putida cfaB mutant was as tolerant to acid shock as the wild-type strain. The cfaB mutant was also as tolerant as the parental strain to a number of drugs, antibiotics and other damaging agents.
TI  - The construction of a whole-cell biosensor for phosphonoacetate, based on the LysR-like transcriptional regulator PhnR from Pseudomonas fluorescens 23F.
AB  - The phnA gene that encodes the carbon-phosphorus bond cleavage enzyme phosphonoacetate hydrolase is widely distributed in the environment, suggesting that its phosphonate substrate may play a significant role in biogeochemical phosphorus cycling. Surprisingly, however, no biogenic origin for phosphonoacetate has yet been established. To facilitate the search for its natural source we have constructed a whole-cell phosphonoacetate biosensor. The gene encoding the LysR-type transcriptional activator PhnR, which controls expression of the phosphonoacetate degradative operon in Pseudomonas fluorescens 23F, was inserted in the broad-host-range promoter probe vector pPROBE-NT, together with the promoter region of the structural genes. Cells of Escherichia coli DH5alpha that contained the resultant construct, pPANT3, exhibited phosphonoacetate-dependent green fluorescent protein fluorescence in response to threshold concentrations of as little as 0.5 microM phosphonoacetate, some 100 times lower than the detection limit of currently available non-biological analytical methods; the pPANT3 biosensor construct in Pseudomonas putida KT2440 was less sensitive, although with shorter response times. From a range of other phosphonates and phosphonoacetate analogues tested, only phosphonoacetaldehyde and arsonoacetate induced green fluorescent protein fluorescence in the E. coli DH5alpha (pPANT3) biosensor, although at much-reduced sensitivities (50 microM phosphonoacetaldehyde and 500 microM arsonoacetate).
TI  - Identification and characterization of catabolic para-nitrophenol 4-monooxygenase and para-benzoquinone reductase from Pseudomonas sp. strain WBC-3.
AB  - Pseudomonas sp. strain WBC-3 utilizes para-nitrophenol (PNP) as a sole source of  carbon, nitrogen, and energy. In order to identify the genes involved in this utilization, we cloned and sequenced a 12.7-kb fragment containing a conserved region of NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase genes. Of the products of the 13 open reading frames deduced from this fragment, PnpA shares 24% identity to the large component of a 3-hydroxyphenylacetate hydroxylase from Pseudomonas putida U and PnpB is 58% identical to an NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase from Escherichia coli. Both PnpA and PnpB were purified to homogeneity as His-tagged proteins, and they were considered to be a monomer and a dimer, respectively, as determined by gel filtration. PnpA is a flavin adenine dinucleotide-dependent single-component PNP 4-monooxygenase that converts PNP to para-benzoquinone in the presence of NADPH. PnpB is a flavin mononucleotide-and NADPH-dependent p-benzoquinone reductase that catalyzes the reduction of p-benzoquinone to hydroquinone. PnpB could enhance PnpA activity, and genetic analyses indicated that both pnpA and pnpB play essential roles in PNP mineralization in strain WBC-3. Furthermore, the pnpCDEF gene cluster next to pnpAB shares significant similarities with and has the same organization as a gene cluster responsible for hydroquinone degradation (hapCDEF) in Pseudomonas fluorescens ACB (M. J. Moonen, N. M. Kamerbeek, A. H. Westphal, S. A. Boeren, D. B. Janssen, M. W. Fraaije, and W. J. van Berkel, J. Bacteriol. 190:5190-5198, 2008), suggesting that the genes involved in PNP degradation are physically linked.
TI  - 13C-Methyl isocyanide as an NMR probe for cytochrome P450 active sites.
AB  - The cytochromes P450 (CYPs) play a central role in many biologically important oxidation reactions, including the metabolism of drugs and other xenobiotic compounds. Because they are often assayed as both drug targets and anti-targets, any tools that provide: (a) confirmation of active site binding and (b) structural data, would be of great utility, especially if data could be obtained in reasonably high throughput. To this end, we have developed an analog of the promiscuous heme ligand, cyanide, with a (13)CH(3)-reporter attached. This (13)C-methyl isocyanide ligand binds to bacterial (P450cam) and membrane-bound mammalian (CYP2B4) CYPs. It can be used in a rapid 1D experiment to identify binders, and provides a qualitative measure of structural changes in the active site.
TI  - Studying the mechanism of RNA separations using RNA chromatography and its application in the analysis of ribosomal RNA and RNA:RNA interactions.
AB  - DNA/RNA chromatography presents a versatile platform for the analysis of nucleic  acids. Although the mechanism of separation of double stranded (ds) DNA fragments is largely understood, the mechanism by which RNA is separated appears more complicated. To further understand the separation mechanisms of RNA using ion pair reverse phase liquid chromatography, we have analysed a number of dsRNA and single stranded (ss) RNA fragments. The high-resolution separation of dsRNA was observed, in a similar manner to dsDNA under non-denaturing conditions. Moreover, the high-resolution separation of ssRNA was observed at high temperatures (75 degrees C) in contrast to ssDNA. It is proposed that the presence of duplex regions/secondary structures within the RNA remain at such temperatures, resulting in high-resolution RNA separations. The retention time of the nucleic acids reflects the relative hydrophobicity, through contributions of the nucleic sequence and the degree of secondary structure present. In addition, the analysis of RNA using such approaches was extended to enable the discrimination of bacterial 16S rRNA fragments and as an aid to conformational analysis of RNA. RNA:RNA interactions of the human telomerase RNA component (hTR) were analysed in conjunction with the incorporation of Mg2+ during chromatography. This novel chromatographic procedure permits analysis of the temperature dependent formation of dimeric RNA species.
TI  - Transcriptional wiring of the TOL plasmid regulatory network to its host involves the submission of the sigma54-promoter Pu to the response regulator PprA.
AB  - Implantation of the regulatory circuit of the degradation pathway of TOL plasmid  pWW0 in the native transcriptional network of the host Pseudomonas putida involves interplay between plasmid- and chromosome-encoded factors. We have employed a reverse genetics approach to investigate such a molecular wiring by identifying host proteins that form stable complexes with Pu, the sigma(54)-dependent promoter of the upper TOL operon of pWW0. This approach revealed that the Pu upstream activating sequences (UAS), the target sites of the cognate activator XylR, form a specific complex with a host protein which, following DNA affinity purification and mass spectrometry analysis, was identified as the LytTR-type two-component response regulator PprA. Directed inactivation of pprA resulted in the upregulation of the Pu promoter in vivo, while expression of the same gene from a plasmid vector strongly repressed Pu activity. Such a downregulation of Pu by PprA could be faithfully reproduced both in vitro with purified components and in an in vivo reporter system assembled in Escherichia coli. The overlap of the PprA and XylR binding sites suggested that the basis for the inhibitory effect on Pu was a mutual exclusion mechanism between the two proteins to bind the UAS. We argue that the binding of the response regulator PprA to Pu (a case without precedents in sigma(54)-dependent transcription) helps to anchor the TOL regulatory subnetwork to the wider context of the host transcriptome, thereby allowing the entry of physiological signals that modulate the outcome of promoter activity.
TI  - Ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase from Pseudomonas putida functions as a ferric reductase.
AB  - Pseudomonas putida harbors two ferredoxin-NADP(+) reductases (Fprs) on its chromosome, and their functions remain largely unknown. Ferric reductase is structurally contained within the Fpr superfamily. Interestingly, ferric reductase is not annotated on the chromosome of P. putida. In an effort to elucidate the function of the Fpr as a ferric reductase, we used a variety of biochemical and physiological methods using the wild-type and mutant strains. In both the ferric reductase and flavin reductase assays, FprA and FprB preferentially used NADPH and NADH as electron donors, respectively. Two Fprs prefer a native ferric chelator to a synthetic ferric chelator and utilize free flavin mononucleotide (FMN) as an electron carrier. FprB has a higher k(cat)/K(m) value for reducing the ferric complex with free FMN. The growth rate of the fprB mutant was reduced more profoundly than that of the fprA mutant, the growth rate of which is also lower than the wild type in ferric iron-containing minimal media. Flavin reductase activity was diminished completely when the cell extracts of the fprB mutant plus NADH were utilized, but not the fprA mutant with NADPH. This indicates that other NADPH-dependent flavin reductases may exist. Interestingly, the structure of the NAD(P) region of FprB, but not of FprA, resembled the ferric reductase (Fre) of Escherichia coli in the homology modeling. This study demonstrates, for the first time, the functions of Fprs in P. putida as flavin and ferric reductases. Furthermore, our results indicated that FprB may perform a crucial role as a NADH-dependent ferric/flavin reductase under iron stress conditions.
TI  - Myxotyrosides A and B, Unusual rhamnosides from Myxococcus sp.
AB  - Myxobacteria are gliding bacteria of the delta-subdivision of the Proteobacteria  and known for their unique biosynthetic capabilities. Two examples of a new class of metabolites, myxotyrosides A (1) and B (2), were isolated from a Myxococcus sp. The myxotyrosides have a tyrosine-derived core structure glycosylated with rhamnose and acylated with unusual fatty acids such as (Z)-15-methyl-2-hexadecenoic and (Z)-2-hexadecenoic acid. The fatty acid profile of the investigated Myxococcus sp. (strain 131) is that of a typical myxobacterium with a high similarity to those described for M. fulvus and M. xanthus, with significant concentrations of neither 15-methyl-2-hexadecenoic acid nor 2-hexadecenoic acid being detected.
TI  - Pathogen prevalence and influence of composted dairy manure application on antimicrobial resistance profiles of commensal soil bacteria.
AB  - Composting manure, if done properly, should kill pathogenic bacteria such as Salmonella and Escherichia coli O157:H7, providing for an environmentally safe product. Over a 3-year period, samples of composted dairy manure, representing 11 composting operations (two to six samples per producer; 100 total samples), were screened for Salmonella and E. coli O157:H7 and were all culture negative. Nonpathogenic bacteria were cultured from these compost samples that could theoretically facilitate the spread of antimicrobial resistance from the dairy to compost application sites. Therefore, we collected soil samples (three samples per plot; 10 plots/treatment; 90 total samples) from rangeland that received either composted dairy manure (CP), commercial fertilizer (F), or no treatment (control, CON). Two collections were made appoximately 2 and 7 months following treatment application. Soil samples were cultured for Pseudomonas and Enterobacter and confirmed isolates subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Three species of Enterobacter (cloacae, 27 isolates; aeroginosa, two isolates; sakazakii, one isolate) and two species of Pseudomonas (aeruginosa, 11 isolates; putida, seven isolates) were identified. Five Enterobacter isolates were resistant to ampicillin and one isolate was resistant to spectinomycin. All Pseudomonas isolates were resistant to ampicillin, ceftiofur, florfenicol, sulphachloropyridazine, sulphadimethoxine, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and most isolates were resistant to chlortetracycline and spectinomycin. Pseudomonas isolates were resistant to an average of 8.6, 7.9, and 8 antibiotics for CON, CP, and F treatments, respectively. No treatment differences were observed in antimicrobial resistance patterns in any of the soil isolates examined. Results reported herein support the use of composted dairy manure as an environmentally friendly soil amendment.
TI  - The use of oxygen uptake rate to monitor discovery of microbial and enzymatic biocatalysts.
AB  - Arising from the requirement for discovery of novel biocatalysts with unusual properties, a process was developed which uniquely combines aspects of continuous culture with the measurement of oxygen uptake. This adaptation of the chemostat can be used to facilitate the isolation of a number of microorganisms with desirable properties, particularly those with useful metabolic capabilities and/or enzymes. The technique was also used to provide feedback on the metabolic status of a microbial population and increase the feed flow rate (i.e., dilution rate) thereby enabling the isolation of microorganisms with enhanced 1,3-propanediol dehydrogenase activity. The use of oxygen uptake as an indicator of cellular activity enables indirect measurement of substrate utilization and provides a real-time online assessment of the status of microbial enrichment or evolutionary processes and provides an opportunity, through the use of feedback systems, to control these processes. To demonstrate the utility of the technique, oxygen uptake rate (OUR) was compared with a range of conventional analytical techniques that are typically used to monitor enrichment/evolutionary processes and showed good correlation. Further validation was demonstrated by monitoring a characterizable microbial population shift using OUR. The population change was confirmed using off-line analytical techniques that are traditionally used to determine microbial activity. OUR was then used to monitor the enrichment of microorganisms capable of using a solvent (1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone) as the sole source of carbon for energy and biomass formation from a heterogeneous microbial population. After purification the microorganisms taken from the enrichment process were able to completely utilize 1 g L(-1) 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone within 24 h demonstrating that the technique had correctly indicated the enriched population was capable of growth on 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone. The technique improves on conventional microbial enrichment that utilizes continuous culture by providing a real-time assessment of the enrichment process and the opportunity to use the OUR output for automated control and variation of one or more growth parameters.
TI  - Methionine depletion with recombinant methioninase: in vitro and in vivo efficacy against neuroblastoma and its synergism with chemotherapeutic drugs.
AB  - Methionine starvation can modulate gene methylation, cell cycle transition and pathways related to survival following DNA damage. Methionine depletion by recombinant methioninase (rMETase) may have in vitro and in vivo efficacy against neuroblastoma (NB), especially when combined with chemotherapeutic drugs. rMETase from Pseudomonas putida was produced in Escherichia coli and purified by ion-exchange chromatography. rMETase alone inhibited the proliferation of 15/15 NB cell lines in vitro. Among these 15 cell lines, only 66N demonstrated rMETase-induced apoptosis. rMETase alone suppressed LAN-1 and NMB-7 xenografts (p < 0.01) and no toxicities were noted other than reversible weight loss. In vitro efficacy experiments combining rMETase and chemotherapeutic agents were carried out using SK-N-LD and SK-N-BE (1)N established at diagnosis, as well as LAN-1, SK-N-BE (2)C and NMB-7 established at relapse. Microtubule depolymerization agents including vincristine, vinorelbine, vinblatine and mebendazole showed synergism when tested in combination with rMETase in all 5 cell lines. Among DNA damaging agents, synergy with rMETase was observed only in cell lines established at diagnosis and not at relapse. Cell cycle analysis showed that rMETase arrested G2 phase and not M phase. In vivo efficacy experiments using LAN-1 and NMB-7 xenografts showed that rMETase rendered vincristine more effective than vincristine alone in tumor growth suppression (p < 0.001). In conclusion, methionine depletion inhibited NB proliferation and arrested tumor cells at G2 phase. rMETase synergized with microtubule depolymerization agents. Moreover, synergism between rMETase and DNA damaging agents was dependent on whether cell lines were established at diagnosis or at relapse.
TI  - Using directed evolution to probe the substrate specificity of mandelamide hydrolase.
AB  - Mandelamide hydrolase (MAH), a member of the amidase signature family, catalyzes  the hydrolysis of mandelamide to mandelate and ammonia. X-ray structures of several members of this family, but not that of MAH, have been reported. These reveal nearly superimposable conformations of the unusual Ser-cisSer-Lys catalytic triad. Conversely, the residues involved in substrate recognition are not conserved, implying that the binding pocket could be modified to change the substrate specificity, perhaps by directed evolution. Here we show that MAH is able to hydrolyze small aliphatic substrates such as lactamide, albeit with low efficiency. A selection method to monitor changes in mandelamide/lactamide preference was developed and used to identify several mutations affecting substrate binding. A homology model places some of these mutations close to the catalytic triad, presumably in the MAH active site. In particular, Gly202 appears to control the preference for aromatic substrates as the G202A variant showed three orders of magnitude decrease in k(cat)/K(m) for (R)- and (S)-mandelamide. This reduction in activity increased to six orders of magnitude for the G202V variant.
TI  - Cloning and characterization of uronate dehydrogenases from two pseudomonads and  Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain C58.
AB  - Uronate dehydrogenase has been cloned from Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato strain DC3000, Pseudomonas putida KT2440, and Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain C58. The genes were identified by using a novel complementation assay employing an Escherichia coli mutant incapable of consuming glucuronate as the sole carbon source but capable of growth on glucarate. A shotgun library of P. syringae was screened in the mutant E. coli by growing transformed cells on minimal medium containing glucuronic acid. Colonies that survived were evaluated for uronate dehydrogenase, which is capable of converting glucuronic acid to glucaric acid. In this manner, a 0.8-kb open reading frame was identified and subsequently verified to be udh. Homologous enzymes in P. putida and A. tumefaciens were identified based on a similarity search of the sequenced genomes. Recombinant proteins from each of the three organisms expressed in E. coli were purified and characterized. For all three enzymes, the turnover number (k(cat)) with glucuronate as a substrate was higher than that with galacturonate; however, the Michaelis constant (K(m)) for galacturonate was lower than that for glucuronate. The A. tumefaciens enzyme was found to have the highest rate constant (k(cat) = 1.9 x 10(2) s(-1) on glucuronate), which was more than twofold higher than those of both of the pseudomonad enzymes.
TI  - OxyR is involved in the expression of thioredoxin reductase TrxB in Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - OxyR regulates the expression of a peroxiredoxin (AhpC) and two catalases (KatA and KatB), which play roles in peroxide protection, at the transcription level in Pseudomonas putida KT2442. Proteome analysis indicated significantly increased amounts of the enzymes AhpC, KatA, KatB, and a peroxiredoxin reductase (AhpF) in the oxyR1 mutant cells; these increases reflected the upregulation of the expression of the genes encoding these enzymes. Additionally, although the effect of oxyR1 mutation on the trxB transcript level was not clearly evident, it increased the amount of thioredoxin reductase (TrxB) by fivefold. Primer extension analysis revealed that trxB was constitutively transcribed from the P1 site; however, hydrogen peroxide treatment lowered the transcription of trxB from P1 but induced its transcription from P2. Adjacent to the -35 base of the P2 initiation site, sequences similar to those involved in the proposed OxyR binding in Escherichia coli were found in a region to which OxyR was shown to bind. These observations suggest that in P. putida, OxyR regulates TrxB expression by promoting trxB transcription from the P2 site when oxidative stresses lowered the transcription from the constitutive P1 site.
TI  - sigma54-promoter discrimination and regulation by ppGpp and DksA.
AB  - The sigma(54)-factor controls expression of a variety of genes in response to environmental cues. Much previous work has implicated the nucleotide alarmone ppGpp and its co-factor DksA in control of sigma(54)-dependent transcription in the gut commensal Escherichia coli, which has evolved to live under very different environmental conditions than Pseudomonas putida. Here we compared ppGpp/DksA mediated control of sigma(54)-dependent transcription in these two organisms. Our in vivo experiments employed P. putida mutants and manipulations of factors implicated in ppGpp/DksA mediated control of sigma(54)-dependent transcription in combination with a series of sigma(54)-promoters with graded affinities for sigma(54)-RNA polymerase. For in vitro analysis we used a P. putida-based reconstituted sigma(54)-transcription assay system in conjunction with DNA-binding plasmon resonance analysis of native and heterologous sigma(54)-RNA polymerase holoenzymes. In comparison with E. coli, ppGpp/DksA responsive sigma(54)-transcription in the environmentally adaptable P. putida was found to be more robust under low energy conditions that occur upon nutrient depletion. The mechanism behind this difference can be traced to reduced promoter discrimination of low affinity sigma(54)-promoters that is conferred by the strong DNA binding properties of the P. putida sigma(54)-RNA polymerase holoenzyme.
TI  - A comparison of various methods to predict bacterial predilection for organic solvents used as reaction media.
AB  - Bacterial predilection for organic solvents is important in whole-cell biocatalysis in organic media. Although various methods of measuring bacterial hydrophobicity have been proposed, it is not fully determined whether they are applicable to the assessment of bacterial predilection for organic solvents in whole-cell biocatalytic processes. In this study, bacterial predilection for organic solvents was assessed by bacterial adhesion to hydrocarbon (BATH), contact angle measurement (CAM), hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC), and glass adhesion test (GAT). These methods were applied to the cultures of four bacterial species of industrial importance, namely, Rhodococcus opacus B-4, R. erythropolis PR4, Pseudomonas putida T-57, and Escherichia coli JM109, in organic media. Experimental results revealed that CAM assays could be used to predict the dispersibility of bacterial cells in anhydrous organic solvents. However, when bacteria were suspended in aqueous-organic (A/O) two-phase media, the results of BATH assays provided the most reliable assessment of bacterial predilection for organic solvents. This discrepancy noted between CAM and BATH assays was attributed to the effect of electrostatic interaction between bacteria and oil droplets. In A/O two-phase media, the accessibility of a water-immiscible dye, nile red, to the bacterial cell surface, correlated well with BATH assay results.
TI  - Speciation of selenite and selenate using living bacteria.
AB  - In this work, a reliable method is described for speciation of soluble inorganic  selenium ions, Se(IV) and Se(VI), which combines an uptake process by using living bacterial cells and electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry (ETAAS). A selective retention of either Se(IV) or Se(IV) plus Se(VI) can be carried out by using the uptake system made up of either Pseudomonas putida or Escherichia coli strains cultivated in a culture medium based on glucose (P. putida) and glucose plus dipotassium phosphate (E. coli) mixed together with the original sample solution containing the selenium species. Discrimination between inorganic selenium species is possible by combining the optimization of the bacterial cell, the growth conditions and the relative rates of their retention from the sample. In the general procedure, an equilibrium between the analyte in the solution and the uptake system is allowed to be established, and then the concentration of selenium is determined directly in the biomass by slurry sampling ETAAS. Nonetheless, a theoretical model is proposed to describe the retention process by the living bacterial cells, which also provides a feasible quantification of the extraction process before the adsorption equilibrium is reached and whenever the agitation conditions and the sampling time are under control. The detection limits for the inorganic selenium species at the best retention conditions are of 5.7 ng Se(IV) ml(-1) for P. putida and 6.1 ng Se(IV) ml(-1) and 6.3 ng Se(VI) ml(-1) for E. coli. The relative standard deviations of the adsorption/determination process are 2.9-6.3%.
TI  - High-titer production of monomeric hydroxyvalerates from levulinic acid in Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - Hydroxyacids represent an important class of compounds that see application in the production of polyesters, biodegradable plastics and antibiotics, and that serve as useful chiral synthetic building blocks for other fine chemicals and pharmaceuticals. An economical, high-titer method for the production of 4-hydroxyvalerate (4HV) and 3-hydroxyvalerate (3HV) from the inexpensive and renewable carbon source levulinic acid was developed. These hydroxyvalerates were produced by periodically feeding levulinate to Pseudomonas putida KT2440 expressing a recombinant thioesterase II (tesB) gene from Escherichia coli K12. The titer of 4HV in shake flask culture reached 13.9+/-1.2 g L(-1) from P. putida tesB(+) cultured at 32 degrees C in LB medium periodically supplemented with glucose and levulinate. The highest 3HV titer obtained was 5.3+/-0.1 g L(-1) in M9 minimal medium supplemented with glucose and levulinate.
TI  - Transfer of antibiotic multiresistant plasmid RP4 from escherichia coli to activated sludge bacteria.
AB  - In situ transfer of a self-transmissible, antibiotic-multiresistant plasmid RP4 from a laboratory Escherichia coli strain C600 to indigenous activated sludge bacteria was investigated using filter mating. The transfer frequency of RP4 from the donor E. coli to the bacteria that was sampled from two wastewater treatment plants was 5.1x10(-2) to 7.5x10(-1) and 4.6x10(-3) to 1.3x10(-2)/potential recipient. The isolated transconjugants showed resistance to Ap, Km, and Tc and the presence of a plasmid with a similar size to RP4. The traG gene on RP4 was also detected from all transconjugants. Reverse-transfer experiments from the transconjugants to E. coli HB101 indicated that RP4 maintained self-transmissibility in the transconjugants. The transconjugant strains were dominant bacteria in activated sludge including Pseudomonas fluorescens, P. putida, and Ochrobactrum anthropi and minor populations of enteric bacterial strains including Citrobacter freundii, E. coli, Enterobacter cloacae, E. asburiae, and Klebsiella pneumoniae ssp. pneumoniae. The transconjugant strains K. pneumoniae ssp. pneumonia, E. cloacae, and E. asburiae had several naturally occurring plasmids. These results suggest that in situ transfer of plasmids and the exchange of antibiotic-resistant genes can occur between released and indigenous bacteria in activated sludge.
TI  - Phage Mu-driven two-plasmid system for integration of recombinant DNA in the Methylophilus methylotrophus genome.
AB  - A phage Mu-driven two-plasmid system for DNA integration in Escherichia coli genome has been adjusted for Methylophilus methylotrophus. Constructed helper plasmids with broad-host-range replicons carry thermo-inducible genes for transposition factors MuA and MuB. Integrative plasmids that are only replicated in E. coli could be mobilized to M. methylotrophus and contained mini-Mu unit with a short terminus of Mu DNA, Mu-attL/R. Mini-Mu unit was integrated in the M. methylotrophus genome via mobilization of the integrative plasmid to the cells carrying the helper in conditions of thermo-induced expression of MuA and MuB. In this system, mini-Mu unit was mainly integrated due to replicative transposition, and the integrated copy could be amplified in the M. methylotrophus chromosome in the presence of helper plasmid. A kan-gene flanked by FRT sites was inserted in one of the mini-Mu units, and it could be readily excised by yeast FLP recombinase that is encoded by the designed plasmid. The multiple Mu-driven gene insertion was carried out by integration of the Bacillus amyloliquefaciens alpha-amylase gene followed by curing the KmR marker before integration of the second mini-Mu unit with Pseudomonas putida xylE gene encoding catechol 2,3-dioxygenase (C23O).
TI  - Spring constants and adhesive properties of native bacterial biofilm cells measured by atomic force microscopy.
AB  - Bacterial biofilms were imaged by atomic force microscopy (AFM), and their elasticity and adhesion to the AFM tip were determined from a series of tip extension and retraction cycles. Though the five bacterial strains studied included both Gram-negative and -positive bacteria and both environmental and laboratory strains, all formed simple biofilms on glass surfaces. Cellular spring constants, determined from the extension portion of the force cycle, varied between 0.16+/-0.01 and 0.41+/-0.01 N/m, where larger spring constants were measured for Gram-positive cells than for Gram-negative cells. The nonlinear regime in the extension curve depended upon the biomolecules on the cell surface: the extension curves for the smooth Gram-negative bacterial strains with the longest lipopolysaccharides on their surface had a larger nonlinear region than the rough bacterial strain with shorter lipopolysaccharides on the surface. Adhesive forces between the retracting silicon nitride tip and the cells varied between cell types in terms of the force components, the distance components, and the number of adhesion events. The Gram-negative cells' adhesion to the tip showed the longest distance components, sometimes more than 1 microm, whereas the shortest distance adhesion events were measured between the two Gram-positive cell types and the tip. Fixation of free-swimming planktonic cells by NHS and EDC perturbed both the elasticity and the adhesive properties of the cells. Here we consider the biochemical meaning of the measured physical properties of simple biofilms and implications to the colonization of surfaces in the first stages of biofilm formation.
TI  - Biosynthesis of the vitamin E compound delta-tocotrienol in recombinant Escherichia coli cells.
AB  - The biosynthesis of natural products in a fast growing and easy to manipulate heterologous host system, such as Escherichia coli, is of increasing interest in biotechnology. This procedure allows the investigation of complex natural product biosynthesis and facilitates the engineering of pathways. Here we describe the cloning and the heterologous expression of tocochromanol (vitamin E) biosynthesis genes in E. coli. Tocochromanols are synthesized solely in photosynthetic organisms (cyanobacteria, algae, and higher green plants). For recombinant tocochromanol biosynthesis, the genes encoding hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (hpd), geranylgeranylpyrophosphate synthase (crtE), geranylgeranylpyrophosphate reductase (ggh), homogentisate phytyltransferase (hpt), and tocopherol-cyclase (cyc) were cloned in a stepwise fashion and expressed in E. coli. Recombinant E. coli cells were cultivated and analyzed for tocochromanol compounds and their biosynthesis precursors. The expression of only hpd from Pseudomonas putida or crtE from Pantoea ananatis resulted in the accumulation of 336 mg L(-1) homogentisate and 84 microg L(-1) geranylgeranylpyrophosphate in E. coli cultures. Simultaneous expression of hpd, crtE, and hpt from Synechocystis sp. under the control of single tac-promoter resulted in the production of methyl-6-geranylgeranyl-benzoquinol (67.9 microg g(-1)). Additional expression of the tocopherol cyclase gene vte1 from Arabidopsis thaliana resulted in the novel formation of a vitamin E compound-delta-tocotrienol (15 microg g(-1))-in E. coli.
TI  - Protein engineering on biphenyl dioxygenase for conferring activity to convert 7-hydroxyflavone and 5,7-dihydroxyflavone (chrysin).
AB  - A central part (amino-acid position 268-397 of 458 amino-acid residues) of the biphenyl dioxygenase large (alpha) subunit, BphA1, from Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes strain KF707 was exchanged with the corresponding part of BphA1 from another biphenyl-degrading bacterium, Pseudomonas putida strain KF715, to construct hybrid BphA1, BphA1 (715-707). When expressed in Escherichia coli together with the bphA2A3A4BC genes from strain KF707, this enzyme was shown to possess activity for degrading both 1-phenylnaphthalene and 2-phenylnaphthalene. Between central parts of BphA1 from strains KF707 and KF715, the difference of amino-acid residues resided only in position 324-325. An attempt was made to improve the substrate preference of BphA1 by applying random amino-acid substitutions at these positions to BphA1 (715-707). After screening the mutant library to bioconvert several flavonoids, BphA1 (1-22; T324A and I325L) and BphA1 (2-2; T324L and I325I) were selected. When expressed in E. coli together with bphA2A3A4B from strain KF707, both BphA1 (1-22) and BphA1 (2-2) bioconverted the refractory flavonoids, 7-hydroxyflavone and 5,7-dihydroxyflavone (chrysin), which were hardly converted by any unmodified and artificially-modified shuffled biphenyl dioxygeneses, into their vicinal diol forms, i.e., 2-(2,3-dihydroxyphenyl)-7-hydroxy-chromen-4-one and 2-(2,3-dihydroxyphenyl)-5,7-dihydroxy-chromen-4-one, respectively. In addition, trans-chalcone was converted into 3-(2,3-dihydroxyphenyl)-1-phenylpropan-1-one and further into 1,3-bis-(2,3-dihydroxyphenyl)-propan-1-one. The antioxidative activity of these generated compounds was markedly higher than that of the original substrates used.
TI  - Type II hydride transferases from different microorganisms yield nitrite and diarylamines from polynitroaromatic compounds.
AB  - Homogenous preparations of XenB of Pseudomonas putida, pentaerythritol tetranitrate reductase of Enterobacter cloacae, and N-ethylmaleimide reductase of Escherichia coli, all type II hydride transferases of the Old Yellow Enzyme family of flavoproteins, are shown to reduce the polynitroaromatic compound 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT). The reduction of this compound yields hydroxylaminodinitrotoluenes and Meisenheimer dihydride complexes, which, upon condensation, yield stoichiometric amounts of nitrite and diarylamines, implying that type II hydride transferases are responsible for TNT denitration, a process with important environmental implications for TNT remediation.
TI  - Solution structure of the Pseudomonas putida protein PpPutA45 and its DNA complex.
AB  - Proline utilization A (PutA) is a membrane-associated multifunctional enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of proline to glutamate in a two-step process. In certain, gram-negative bacteria such as Pseudomonas putida, PutA also acts as an auto repressor in the cytoplasm, when an insufficient concentration of proline is available. Here, the N-terminal residues 1-45 of PutA from P. putida (PpPutA45) are shown to be responsible for DNA binding and dimerization. The solution structure of PpPutA45 was determined using NMR methods, where the protein is shown to be a symmetrical homodimer (12 kDa) consisting of two ribbon-helix-helix (RHH) structures. DNA sequence recognition by PpPutA45 was determined using DNA gel mobility shift assays and NMR chemical shift perturbations (CSPs). PpPutA45 was shown to bind a 14 base-pair DNA oligomer (5'-GCGGTTGCACCTTT-3'). A model of the PpPutA45-DNA oligomer complex was generated using Haddock 2.1. The antiparallel beta-sheet that results from PpPutA45 dimerization serves as the DNA recognition binding site by inserting into the DNA major groove. The dimeric core of four alpha-helices provides a structural scaffold for the beta-sheet from which residues Thr5, Gly7, and Lys9 make sequence-specific contacts with the DNA. The structural model implies flexibility of Lys9 which can make hydrogen bond contacts with either guanine or thymine. The high sequence and structure conservation of the PutA RHH domain suggest interdomain interactions play an important role in the evolution of the protein.
TI  - A novel and complete gene cluster involved in the degradation of aniline by Delftia sp. AN3.
AB  - A recombinant strain, Escherichia coli JM109-AN1, was obtained by constructing of a genomic library of the total DNA of Delftia sp. AN3 in E. coli JM109 and screening for catechol 2,3-dioxygenase activity. This recombinant strain could grow on aniline as sole carbon, nitrogen and energy source. Enzymatic assays revealed that the exogenous genes including aniline dioxygenase (AD) and catechol 2,3-dioxygenase (C230) genes could well express in the recombinant strain with the activities of AD and C230 up to 0.31 U/mg wet cell and 1.92 U/mg crude proteins, respectively. The AD or C230 of strain AN3 could only catalyze aniline or catechol but not any other substituted substrates. This recombinant strain contained a recombinant plasmid, pKC505-AN1, in which a 29.7-kb DNA fragment from Delftia sp. AN3 was inserted. Sequencing and open reading frame (orfs) analysis of this 29.7 kb fragment revealed that it contained at least 27 orfs, among them a gene cluster (consisting of at least 16 genes, named danQTA1A2BRDCEFG1HIJKG2) was responsible for the complete metabolism of aniline to TCA-cycle intermediates. This gene cluster could be divided into two main parts, the upper sequences consisted of 7 genes (danQTAIA2BRD) were predicted to encode a multi-component aniline dioxygenase and a LysR-type regulator, and the central genes (danCEFGIHIJKG2) were expected to encode meta-cleavage pathway enzymes for catechol degradation to TCA-cycle intermediates. Unlike clusters tad from Delftia tsuruhatensis AD9 and tdn from Pseudomonas putida UCC22, in this gene cluster, all the genes were in the same transcriptional direction. There was only one set of C230 gene (danC) and ferredoxin-like protein gene (danD). The presence of only one set of these two genes and specificity of AD and C230 might be the reason for strain AN3 could only degrade aniline. The products of danQTAIA2BRDC showed 99%-100% identity to those from Delftia acidovorans 7N, and 50%-85% identity to those of tad cluster from D. tsuruhatensis AD9 in amino acid residues. Besides this dan cluster, the 29.7 kb fragment also contained genes encoding the trans-membrane transporter and transposases which might be needed for transposition of the gene cluster. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and plasmid curing experiments suggested that the dan cluster might be encoded on the chromosome of strain AN3. The GenBank accession number for the dan cluster of Delftia sp. AN3 is DQ661649.
TI  - Bacterial partitioning proteins affect the subcellular location of broad-host-range plasmid RK2.
AB  - It has been demonstrated that plasmids are not randomly distributed but are located symmetrically in mid-cell, or (1/4), (3/4) positions in bacterial cells. In this work we compared the localization of broad-host-range plasmid RK2 mini-replicons, which lack an active partitioning system, in Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida cells. In E. coli the location of the plasmid mini-replicon cluster was at the cell poles. In contrast, in Pseudomonas cells, as a result of the interaction of chromosomally encoded ParB protein with RK2 centromere-like sequences, these mini-derivatives were localized in the proximity of mid-cell, or (1/4), (3/4) positions. The expression of the Pseudomonas parAB genes in E. coli resulted in a positional change in the RK2 mini-derivative to the mid-cell or (1/4), (3/4) positions. Moreover, in a P. putida parAB mutant, both RK2 mini-derivatives and the entire RK2 plasmid exhibited disturbances of subcellular localization. These observations raise the possibility that in certain bacteria chromosomally encoded partitioning machinery could affect subcellular plasmid positioning.
TI  - Characterisation of the metallo-beta-lactamase VIM-6 and its genetic support.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to characterise the metallo-beta-lactamase VIM-6 and the genetic environment of the bla(VIM-6) gene. The bla(VIM-6) gene was cloned into an Escherichia coli expression system and the purified VIM-6 enzyme was obtained. VIM-6 has an isoelectric point of 4.9 and a molecular weight of 28.368 Da. VIM-6 hydrolysed all tested penicillins, cephalosporins and carbapenems with the exception of aztreonam. In Pseudomonas putida, the bla(VIM-6) gene is the first in a class 1 integron also containing bla(OXA-10), aacA4, an open reading frame of unknown function, aadA and qacEDelta1.
TI  - Enantioselective nitrilase from Pseudomonas putida: cloning, heterologous expression, and bioreactor studies.
AB  - Nitrilases have attracted tremendous attention for the preparation of optically pure carboxylic acids. This article aims to address the production and utilization of a highly enantioselective nitrilase from Pseudomonas putida MTCC 5110 for the hydrolysis of racemic mandelonitrile to (R)-mandelic acid. The nitrilase gene from P. putida was cloned in pET 21b(+) and over-expressed as histidine-tagged protein in Escherichia coli. The histidine-tagged enzyme was purified from crude cell extracts of IPTG-induced cells of E. coli BL21 (DE3). Inducer replacement studies led to the identification of lactose as a suitable and cheap alternative to the costly IPTG. Effects of medium components, various physico-chemical, and process parameters (pH, temperature, aeration, and agitation) for the production of nitrilase by engineered E. coli were optimized and scaled up to a laboratory scale bioreactor (6.6 l). Finally, the recombinant E. coli whole-cells were utilized for the production of (R)-(-)-mandelic acid.
TI  - Characterization of the traD operon of naphthalene-catabolic plasmid NAH7: a host-range modifier in conjugative transfer.
AB  - Pseudomonas putida G7 carries a naphthalene-catabolic and self-transmissible plasmid, NAH7, which belongs to the IncP-9 incompatibility group. Adjacent to the putative origin of conjugative transfer (oriT) of NAH7 are three genes, traD, traE, and traF, whose functions and roles in conjugation were previously unclear. These three genes were transcribed monocistronically and thus were designated the traD operon. Mutation of the three genes in the traD operon resulted in 10- to 10(5)-fold decreases in the transfer frequencies of the plasmids from Pseudomonas to Pseudomonas and Escherichia coli and from E. coli to E. coli. On the other hand, the traD operon was essential for the transfer of NAH7 from E. coli to Pseudomonas strains. These results indicated that the traD operon is a host-range modifier in the conjugative transfer of NAH7. The TraD, TraE, and TraF proteins were localized in the cytoplasm, periplasm, and membrane, respectively, in strain G7 cells. Our use of a bacterial two-hybrid assay system showed that TraE interacted in vivo with other essential components for conjugative transfer, including TraB (coupling protein), TraC (relaxase), and MpfH (a channel subunit in the mating pair formation system).
TI  - A phylogenomic analysis of the shikimate dehydrogenases reveals broadscale functional diversification and identifies one functionally distinct subclass.
AB  - The shikimate dehydrogenases (SDH) represent a widely distributed enzyme family with an essential role in secondary metabolism. This superfamily had been previously subdivided into 4 enzyme groups (AroE, YdiB, SdhL, and RifI), which show clear biochemical and functional differences ranging from amino acid biosynthesis to antibiotic production. Despite the importance of this group, little is known about how such essential enzymatic functions can evolve and diversify. We dissected the enzyme superfamily with a phylogenomic analysis of approximately 250 fully sequenced genomes, making use of previously characterized representatives from each enzyme class, and the key substrate-binding residues known to distinguish substrate specificity. We identified 5 major evolutionary and functional SDH subgroups and several other potentially unique functional classes within this complex enzyme family and then validated the functional distinctiveness of each group by characterizing the 5 SDH homologs found in Pseudomonas putida KT2440 biochemically. We identified an entirely novel functionally distinct subgroup, which we designated Ael1 (AroE-like1) and also delineated a new group of shikimate/quinate dehydrogenases (YdiB2), which is phylogenetically distinct from the previously described Escherichia coli YdiB. The combination of biochemical, phylogenetic, and genomic approaches has revealed the broad extent to which the SDH enzyme superfamily has diversified. Five functional groups were validated with the potential for at least 5 additional subgroups. Our analysis also identified a new SDH functional group, which appears to have evolved recently from an ancestral AroE, illustrating a very prominent role of horizontal transmission and neofunctionalizaton in the evolutionary and functional diversification of this enzyme family.
TI  - Organoiodine (III)-mediated synthesis of 3-aryl/heteroaryl-5,7-dimethyl-1,2,4-triazolo[4,3-c]pyrimidines as antibacterial agents.
AB  - Synthesis of 12 new 3-aryl/heteroaryl-5,7-dimethyl-1,2,4-triazolo[4,3-c]pyrimidines (3a-l) has been accomplished by the oxidation of pyrimidinylhydrazones (2a-l) of various aryl/heteroaryl aldehydes using 1.1equiv. of iodobenzene diacetate (IBD) in dichloromethane. All the compounds 3a-l tested in vitro for their antibacterial activity against two Gram-positive bacteria namely, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus stearothermophilus and two Gram-negative bacteria Pseudomonas putida, Escherichia coli. Two compounds, namely 3-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-5,7-dimethyl-1,2,4-triazolo [4,3-c]pyrimidine (3j) and 3-(4-hydroxy-2-methoxyphenyl)-5,7-dimethyl-1,2,4-triazolo[4,3-c]pyrimidine (3l) were found to be equipotent or more potent than the commercially available antibiotics (chloramphenicol and streptomycin).
TI  - Purification, crystallization and preliminary crystallographic analysis of DehI,  a group I alpha-haloacid dehalogenase from Pseudomonas putida strain PP3.
AB  - Pseudomonas putida strain PP3 produces two dehalogenases, DehI and DehII, which belong to the group I and II alpha-haloacid dehalogenases, respectively. Group I dehalogenases catalyse the removal of halides from D-haloalkanoic acids and in some cases also the L-enantiomers, both substituted at their chiral centres. Studies of members of this group have resulted in the proposal of general catalytic mechanisms, although no structural information is available in order to better characterize their function. This work presents the initial stages of the structural investigation of the group I alpha-haloacid dehalogenase DehI. The DehI gene was cloned into a pET15b vector with an N-terminal His tag and expressed in Escherichia coli Nova Blue strain. Purified protein was crystallized in 25% PEG 3350, 0.4 M lithium sulfate and 0.1 M bis-tris buffer pH 6.0. The crystals were primitive monoclinic (space group P2(1)), with unit-cell parameters a = 68.32, b = 111.86, c = 75.13 A, alpha = 90, beta = 93.7, gamma = 90 degrees , and a complete native data set was collected. Molecular replacement is not an option for structure determination, so further experimental phasing methods will be necessary.
TI  - Engineering Pseudomonas putida S12 for efficient utilization of D-xylose and L-arabinose.
AB  - The solvent-tolerant bacterium Pseudomonas putida S12 was engineered to utilize xylose as a substrate by expressing xylose isomerase (XylA) and xylulokinase (XylB) from Escherichia coli. The initial yield on xylose was low (9% [g CDW g substrate(-1)], where CDW is cell dry weight), and the growth rate was poor (0.01 h(-1)). The main cause of the low yield was the oxidation of xylose into the dead-end product xylonate by endogenous glucose dehydrogenase (Gcd). Subjecting the XylAB-expressing P. putida S12 to laboratory evolution yielded a strain that efficiently utilized xylose (yield, 52% [g CDW g xylose(-1)]) at a considerably improved growth rate (0.35 h(-1)). The high yield could be attributed in part to Gcd inactivity, whereas the improved growth rate may be connected to alterations in the primary metabolism. Surprisingly, without any further engineering, the evolved D-xylose-utilizing strain metabolized l-arabinose as efficiently as D-xylose. Furthermore, despite the loss of Gcd activity, the ability to utilize glucose was not affected. Thus, a P. putida S12-derived strain was obtained that efficiently utilizes the three main sugars present in lignocellulosic hydrolysate: glucose, xylose, and arabinose. This strain will form the basis for a platform host for the efficient production of biochemicals from renewable feedstock.
TI  - Outer-membrane transport of aromatic hydrocarbons as a first step in biodegradation.
AB  - Bacterial biodegradation of hydrocarbons, an important process for environmental  remediation, requires the passage of hydrophobic substrates across the cell membrane. Here, we report crystal structures of two outer membrane proteins, Pseudomonas putida TodX and Ralstonia pickettii TbuX, which have been implicated in hydrocarbon transport and are part of a subfamily of the FadL fatty acid transporter family. The structures of TodX and TbuX show significant differences with those previously determined for Escherichia coli FadL, which may provide an explanation for the substrate-specific transport of TodX and TbuX observed with in vivo transport assays. The TodX and TbuX structures revealed 14-stranded beta-barrels with an N-terminal hatch domain blocking the barrel interior. A hydrophobic channel with bound detergent molecules extends from the extracellular surface and is contiguous with a passageway through the hatch domain, lined by both hydrophobic and polar or charged residues. The TodX and TbuX structures support a mechanism for transport of hydrophobic substrates from the extracellular environment to the periplasm via a channel through the hatch domain.
TI  - Modelling the simultaneous processes occurring during the BOD(5) test using synthetic waters as a pattern.
AB  - Synthetic waters imitating BOD(5) test conditions have been studied to model the  progress curves of cell growth, organic matter consumption and oxygen demand. Glucose and glutamic acid were used as organic matter and Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida as microorganisms. The concentrations of all the products were measured simultaneously over time and were fitted to the Logistic and Monod models. Following this, the goodness of fit was analysed. Discrimination between models allowed us to conclude that the Logistic model has acceptable accuracy to describe the kinetic behaviour inside a BOD(5) bottle, while the extra parameter in the Monod model would not be statistically justified. Thus, the logistic parameters were determined under different conditions by non-linear regression and their biological meaning was interpreted.
TI  - Attachment of ampicillin to expanded poly(tetrafluoroethylene): surface reactions leading to inhibition of microbial growth.
AB  - The broad spectrum antibiotic, ampicillin (AM), was reacted to expanded poly (tetrafluoroethylene) (ePTFE) surfaces and resulted in the formation of antimicrobial surfaces effective against gram-positive, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus thuringiensis, and Enterococcus faecalis, and gram-negative, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas putida, and Salmonella enterica bacteria. These ePTFE surface modifications were accomplished by utilization of microwave maleic anhydride (MA) plasma reactions leading to the formation of acid groups, followed by amidation reactions of heterofunctional NH 2/COOH-terminated polyethylene glycol (PEG). The final step, the attachment of AM to the PEG spacer, was achieved by amidation reactions between COOH-terminated PEG and NH 2 groups of AM. This approach protects the COOH-AM functionality and diminishes the possibility of hydrolysis of the antimicrobial active portion of AM. These studies also show that approximately 90% of AM molecules are still covalently attached to PEG-MA-ePTFE surfaces after exposure to the bacteria solutions. Even after a 24 h period, the AM volume concentration changes only from 2.25 to 2.04 microg/m3, and depending upon the bacteria type, the bacteria suspensions containing AM-PEG-MA-ePTFE specimens retain 85-99% of their initial optical density.
TI  - Localization of zearalenone detoxification gene(s) in pZEA-1 plasmid of Pseudomonas putida ZEA-1 and expressed in Escherichia coli.
AB  - The gene(s) encoding enzyme(s) involved in the initial reaction during degradation of zearalenone (ZEA) was characterized from the zearalenone utilizer Pseudomonas putida strain ZEA-1, where ZEA was transformed into product with less or no toxicity. A 5.5 kilobase-pair (kbp) Pst1-Kpn1 fragment containing gene(s) encoding for zearalenone degradation was cloned. The cloned gene(s) was actively expressed in Escherichia coli. ZEA degradation by recombinant E. coli was relatively rapid and effective, leaving no detectable ZEA after 24h. In further experiments, cell-free extract of E. coli has been used in the same way, both to confirm these observations and the enzymatic nature of the degradation activity.
TI  - Novel auto-inducing expression systems for the development of whole-cell biocatalysts.
AB  - Novel expression systems for the development of whole-cell biocatalysts were generated. Their novelty consists both in the host, Pseudomonas putida, and in the ability to auto-induce the expression of genes of interest at the exhaustion of the carbon source used for the biomass growth. The auto-induction relies on new expression vectors developed in this study and based on the activator TouR from Pseudomonas sp. OX1, which was shown to mediate the activation of target promoters in an effector-independent growth-phase-dependent manner when the carbon source is exhausted at the onset of the stationary phase. We validated the suitability of these expression systems through the production of (S)-styrene oxide by the styrene monooxygenase from Pseudomonas fluorescens ST. The yields of epoxides produced by these biocatalysts in flask experiments showed to be as efficient as those currently available based on inducible Escherichia coli systems. In addition, a larger scale of biomass production showed no reduction of biocatalysis efficiency. Therefore, the systems developed in this study constitute a valid alternative to current expression systems to use in bioconversion processes.
TI  - Transcription factors CysB and SfnR constitute the hierarchical regulatory system for the sulfate starvation response in Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - Pseudomonas putida DS1 is able to utilize dimethyl sulfone as a sulfur source. Expression of the sfnFG operon responsible for dimethyl sulfone oxygenation is directly regulated by a sigma(54)-dependent transcriptional activator, SfnR, which is encoded within the sfnECR operon. We investigated the transcription mechanism for the sulfate starvation-induced expression of these sfn operons. Using an in vivo transcription assay and in vitro DNA-binding experiments, we revealed that SfnR negatively regulates the expression of sfnECR by binding to the downstream region of the transcription start point. Additionally, we demonstrated that a LysR-type transcriptional regulator, CysB, directly activates the expression of sfnECR by binding to its upstream region. CysB is a master regulator that controls the sulfate starvation response of the sfn operons, as is the case for the sulfonate utilization genes of Escherichia coli, although CysB(DS1) appeared to differ from that of E. coli CysB in terms of the effect of O-acetylserine on DNA-binding ability. Furthermore, we investigated what effector molecules repress the expression of sfnFG and sfnECR in vivo by using the disruptants of the sulfate assimilatory genes cysNC and cysI. The measurements of mRNA levels of the sfn operons in these gene disruptants suggested that the expression of sfnFG is repressed by sulfate itself while the expression of sfnECR is repressed by the downstream metabolites in the sulfate assimilatory pathway, such as sulfide and cysteine. These results indicate that SfnR plays a role independent of CysB in the sulfate starvation-induced expression of the sfn operons.
TI  - Microbial production of medium-chain-length 3-hydroxyalkanoic acids by recombinant Pseudomonas putida KT2442 harboring genes fadL, fadD and phaZ.
AB  - Monomers of microbial polyhydroxyalkanoates, mainly 3-hydroxyhexanoic acid (3HHx) and 3-hydroxyoctanoic acid (3HO), were produced by overexpressing polyhydroxyalkanoates depolymerase gene phaZ, together with putative long-chain fatty acid transport protein fadL of Pseudomonas putida KT2442 and acyl-CoA synthetase (fadD) of Escherichia coli MG1655 in P. putida KT2442. FadL(Pp), which is responsible for free fatty acid transportation from the extracellular environment to the cytoplasm, and FadD(Ec), which activates fatty acid to acyl-CoA, jointly reinforce the fatty acid beta-oxidation pathway. Pseudomonas putida KT2442 (pYZPst01) harboring polyhydroxyalkanoates depolymerase gene phaZ of Pseudomonas stutzeri 1317 produced 1.37 g L(-1) extracellular 3HHx and 3HO in shake flask studies after 48 h in the presence of sodium octanoate as a sole carbon source, while P. putida KT2442 (pYZPst06) harboring phaZ(Pst), fadD(Ec) and fadL(Pp) achieved 2.32 g L(-1) extracellular 3HHx and 3HO monomer production under the same conditions. In a 48-h fed-batch fermentation process conducted in a 6-L fermentor with 3 L sodium octanoate mineral medium, 5.8 g L(-1) extracellular 3HHx and 3HO were obtained in the fermentation broth. This is the first time that medium-chain-length 3-hydroxyalkanoic acids (mcl-3HA) were produced using fadL(Pp) and fadD(Ec) genes combined with the polyhydroxyalkanoates depolymerase gene phaZ.
TI  - Distribution of the partitioning protein KorB on the genome of IncP-1 plasmid RK2.
AB  - The ParB family partitioning protein, KorB, of plasmid RK2 is central to a regulatory network coordinating replication, maintenance and transfer genes. Previous immunofluorescence microscopy indicated that the majority of KorB is localized in plasmid foci. The 12 identified KorB binding sites on RK2 are differentiated by: position relative to promoters; binding strength; and cooperativity with other repressors and so the distribution of KorB may be sequestered around a sub-set of sites. However, chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis showed that while RK2 DNA molecules appear to sequester KorB to create a higher local concentration, cooperativity between DNA binding proteins does not result in major differences in binding site occupancy. Thus under steady state conditions all operators are close to fully occupied and this correlates with gene expression on the plasmid being highly repressed.
TI  - [Study of ectoparasitism of ultramicrobacteria of the genus Kaistia, strains NF1  and NF3 by electron and fluorescence microscopy].
AB  - Transmission electron and fluorescence microscopy was used to study the character of the interaction of free-living ultramicrobacterial (UMB) strains NF1 and NF3, affiliated with the genus Kaistia, and seven species of gram-positive and gram-negative heterotrophic bacteria. Strains NF1 and NF3 were found to exhibit parasitic activity against gram-positive Bacillus subtilis and gram-negative Acidovorax delafildii. UMB cells are tightly attached to the envelopes of the victim cells and induce their lysis, thus demonstrating the features of typical ectoparasitism. The selectivity of parasitism of the studied UMB to the victim bacteria has been shown: only two soil microorganisms of the seven test objects, B. subtilis ATCC 6633 and an aerobic gram-negative bacterium A. delafildii 39, were found to be sensitive to UMB attack. Other bacteria (Micrococcus luteus VKM Ac-2230, Staphylococcus aureus 209-P, Pseudomonas putida BS394, Escherichia coli C 600, and Pantoea agglomerans ATCC 27155) were not attacked by UMB. It was established for the first time that free-living UMB may be facultative parasites not only of phototrophic bacteria, as we have previously demonstrated, but of heterotrophic bacteria as well. The UMB under study seem to play an important role in the regulation of the quantity of microorganisms and in the functioning of microbial communities in some natural ecotopes.
TI  - [Inheritance of biodegradation plasmids in the cells of homo- and heterologous hosts].
AB  - A systematic analysis of the inheritance of D plasmids of the IncP-9 group (alpha-, beta-, gamma-, delta-, epsilon-, zeta-, eta-, theta-subgroups), IncP-7, as well as of those of undefined systematic affiliation in the cells of homologous (Pseudomonas putida) and heterologous (Escherichia coli) hosts was performed for the first time. For this purpose, mini-Tn5 transposons determining resistance to kanamycin (or streptomycin) were introduced into all the D plasmids under study. It has been established that all IncP-9 plasmids can be transmitted to the cells of a heterologous host E. coli (with the exception of plasmid pSVS15 from theta-subgroup). IncP-7 plasmids and those of undefined systematic affiliation do not possess this property and can be transmitted and stably inherited only in P. putida. The distinctive feature of most IncP-9 plasmids (alpha-, beta-, gamma-, delta-, epsilon-, and zeta-subgroups) is strict dependence of their inheritance on the temperature factor. At 37 degrees C, the plasmids of delta-, zeta-, and theta-subgroups are unstable in P. putida cells, while in E. coli nearly all plasmids of this systematic group are unstable. The exceptions are the plasmids of eta- and gamma-subgroups. Inheritance of these plasmids does not depend on temperature. At 28 degrees C and 37 degrees C, the eta plasmid is not maintained stably (inheritance stability is 2%), while the gamma plasmid has almost 100% stability under the same conditions.
TI  - Biotransformation of chloroaromatics: the impact of bioavailability and substrate specificity.
AB  - The effect of surfactants on the biodegradation of mono-aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, chlorobenzene and 1,2-dichlorobenzene by an Escherichia coli JMI09(MI) recombinant strain, carrying a gene cluster containing the genes for benzene dioxygenase, cis-benzene dihydrodiol dehydrogenase, and catechol 2,3-dioxygenase from Pseudomonas putida ML2, has been investigated. We observed that the efficiency of the benzene dioxygenase catalyzed conversions to cis-dihydrodiols depends on the balance among real substrate specificity, bioavailability, and toxicity effects of highly concentrated aromatic hydrocarbons. The utilization of non ionic surfactants makes it possible to partly overcome the limiting step of biodegradation processes for scarcely water soluble hydrocarbons hindered by their limited bioavailability.Furthermore the cis-benzene dihydrodiol dehydrogenase and the extradiol catechol 2,3-dioxygenase, which in the presently analyzed biodegradative pathway should further degrade the pollutants, are known, the first to be selectively specific for the (lR,2R)-dihydrodiol derivative which is not produced by the benzene dioxygenase, the second, to be dead-end inhibited by the corresponding chlorinated catechois. In the present example this results in the accumulation of the corresponding chlorinated cis-dihydrodiols which can be useful for asymmetric synthesis.On the other hand the practical utilization of the system for bioremediation purposes requires the efficient conversion of the chlorinated catechols by specific intradiol ring-cleaving dioxygenases, the crystal structures of some of these last enzymes are currently under analysis in our laboratory to understand the structuralfunctional correlations. Preliminary data show overall structures similar to the catechol 1,2-dioxygenase from Acinetobacter sp. ADP1 thus suggesting that the substrate specificity differences are mainly related to subtle differences in the catalytic site.
TI  - Comparative genomics of the pIPO2/pSB102 family of environmental plasmids: sequence, evolution, and ecology of pTer331 isolated from Collimonas fungivorans Ter331.
AB  - Plasmid pTer331 from the bacterium Collimonas fungivorans Ter331 is a new member  of the pIPO2/pSB102 family of environmental plasmids. The 40 457-bp sequence of pTer331 codes for 44 putative ORFs, most of which represent genes involved in replication, partitioning and transfer of the plasmid. We confirmed that pTer331 is stably maintained in its native host. Deletion analysis identified a mini-replicon capable of replicating autonomously in Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida. Furthermore, plasmid pTer331 was able to mobilize and retromobilize IncQ plasmid pSM1890 at typical rates of 10(-4) and 10(-8), respectively. Analysis of the 91% DNA sequence identity between pTer331 and pIPO2 revealed functional conservation of coding sequences, the deletion of DNA fragments flanked by short direct repeats (DR), and sequence preservation of long DRs. In addition, we experimentally established that pTer331 has no obvious contribution in several of the phenotypes that are characteristic of its host C. fungivorans Ter331, including the ability to efficiently colonize plant roots. Based on our findings, we hypothesize that cryptic plasmids such as pTer331 and pIPO2 might not confer an individual advantage to bacteria, but, due to their broad-host-range and ability to retromobilize, benefit bacterial populations by accelerating the intracommunal dissemination of the mobile gene pool.
TI  - Solubility enhancement of aggregation-prone heterologous proteins by fusion expression using stress-responsive Escherichia coli protein, RpoS.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The most efficient method for enhancing solubility of recombinant proteins appears to use the fusion expression partners. Although commercial fusion partners including maltose binding protein and glutathione-S-transferase have shown good performance in enhancing the solubility, they cannot be used for the proprietory production of commercially value-added proteins and likely cannot serve as universal helpers to solve all protein solubility and folding issues. Thus, novel fusion partners will continue to be developed through systematic investigations including proteome mining presented in this study. RESULTS: We analyzed the Escherichia coli proteome response to the exogenous stress of guanidine hydrochloride using 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis and found that RpoS (RNA polymerase sigma factor) was significantly stress responsive. While under the stress condition the total number of soluble proteins decreased by about 7 %, but a 6-fold increase in the level of RpoS was observed, indicating that RpoS is a stress-induced protein. As an N-terminus fusion expression partner, RpoS increased significantly the solubility of many aggregation-prone heterologous proteins in E. coli cytoplasm, indicating that RpoS is a very effective solubility enhancer for the synthesis of many recombinant proteins. RpoS was also well suited for the production of a biologically active fusion mutant of Pseudomonas putida cutinase. CONCLUSION: RpoS is highly effective as a strong solubility enhancer for aggregation-prone heterologous proteins when it is used as a fusion expression partner in an E. coli expression system. The results of these findings may, therefore, be useful in the production of other biologically active industrial enzymes, as successfully demonstrated by cutinase.
TI  - Designing a whole-cell biotransformation system in Escherichia coli using cytochrome P450 from Streptomyces peucetius.
AB  - A biotransformation system was designed to co-express CYP107P3 (CSP4), cytochrome P450, from Streptomyces peuceticus, along with CamA (putidaredoxin reductase) and CamB (putidaredoxin) from Pseudomonas putida, the necessary reducing equivalents, in a class I type electron-transfer system in E. coli BL21 (DE3). This was carried out using two plasmids with different selection markers and compatible origins of replication. The study results showed that this biotransformation system was able to mediate the O-dealkylation of 7-ethoxycumarin.
TI  - Practical application of different enzymes immobilized on sepabeads.
AB  - The immobilization of an endoglucanase, benzoylformate decarboxylase (BFD) from Pseudomonas putida, as well as of lipase B from Candida antarctica (CALB) onto the carrier supports Sepabeads EC-EP, Sepabeads EC-EA, and Sepabeads EC-BU was accomplished. It is shown that via these immobilized biocatalysts the synthesis of both fine and bulk chemicals is possible. This is illustrated by the syntheses of polyglycerol esters and (S)-hydroxy phenyl propanone. The benefit of immobilization is illustrated by repetitive use in a bubble column reactor as well as in a stirred tank reactor. High stability of two biocatalysts was achieved and reusability up to eight times was demonstrated. The comparison of CALB immobilized on Sepabeads EC-EP to Novozym 435 shows similar activity.
TI  - Bacterial hosts for natural product production.
AB  - Four bacterial hosts are reviewed in the context of either native or heterologous natural product production. E. coli, B. subtilis, pseudomonads, and Streptomyces bacterial systems are presented with each having either a long-standing or more recent application to the production of therapeutic natural compounds. The four natural product classes focused upon include the polyketides, nonribosomal peptides, terpenoids, and flavonoids. From the perspective of both innate and heterologous production potential, each bacterial host is evaluated according to biological properties that would either hinder or facilitate natural product biosynthesis.
TI  - A novel gene, encoding 6-hydroxy-3-succinoylpyridine hydroxylase, involved in nicotine degradation by Pseudomonas putida strain S16.
AB  - Previous research suggested that Pseudomonas spp. may attack the pyrrolidine ring of nicotine in a way similar to mammalian metabolism, resulting in the formation of pseudooxynicotine, the direct precursor of a potent tobacco-specific lung carcinogen. In addition, the subsequent intermediates, 6-hydroxy-3-succinoylpyridine (HSP) and 2,5-dihydroxypyridine (DHP) in the Pseudomonas nicotine degradation pathway are two important precursors for drug syntheses. However, there is little information on the molecular mechanism for nicotine degradation via the pyrrolidine pathway until now. In this study we cloned and sequenced a 4,879-bp gene cluster involved in nicotine degradation. Intermediates N-methylmyosmine, pseudooxynicotine, 3-succinoylpyridine, HSP, and DHP were identified from resting cell reactions of the transformant containing the gene cluster and shown to be identical to those of the pyrrolidine pathway reported in wild-type strain Pseudomonas putida S16. The gene for 6-hydroxy-3-succinoylpyridine hydroxylase (HSP hydroxylase) catalyzing HSP directly to DHP was cloned, sequenced, and expressed in Escherichia coli, and the purified HSP hydroxylase (38 kDa) is NADH dependent. DNA sequence analysis of this 936-bp fragment reveals that the deduced amino acid shows no similarity with any protein of known function.
TI  - Genetic analyses and molecular characterization of the pathways involved in the conversion of 2-phenylethylamine and 2-phenylethanol into phenylacetic acid in Pseudomonas putida U.
AB  - In Pseudomonas putida U two different pathways (Pea, Ped) are required for the conversion of 2-phenylethylamine and 2-phenylethanol into phenylacetic acid. The 2-phenylethylamine pathway (PeaABCDEFGHR) catalyses the transport of this amine, its deamination to phenylacetaldehyde by a quinohaemoprotein amine dehydrogenase and the oxidation of this compound through a reaction catalysed by a phenylacetaldehyde dehydrogenase. Another catabolic route (PedS(1)R(1)ABCS(2)R(2)DEFGHI) is needed for the uptake of 2-phenylethanol and for its oxidation to phenylacetic acid via phenylacetaldehyde. This implies the participation of two different two-component signal-transducing systems, two quinoprotein alcohol dehydrogenases, a cytochrome c, a periplasmic binding protein, an aldehyde dehydrogenase, a pentapeptide repeat protein and an ABC efflux system. Additionally, two accessory sets of elements (PqqABCDEF and CcmABCDEFGHI) are necessary for the operation of the main pathways (Pea and Ped). PqqABCDEF is required for the biosynthesis of pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ), a prosthetic group of certain alcohol dehydrogenases that transfers electrons to an independent cytochrome c; whereas CcmABCDEFGHI is required for cytochrome c maturation. Our data show that the degradation of phenylethylamine and phenylethanol in P. putida U is quite different from that reported in Escherichia coli, and they demonstrate that PeaABCDEFGHR and PedS(1)R(1)ABCS(2)R(2)DEFGHI are two upper routes belonging to the phenylacetyl-CoA catabolon.
TI  - Pseudomonas syringae BetT is a low-affinity choline transporter that is responsible for superior osmoprotection by choline over glycine betaine.
AB  - The plant pathogen Pseudomonas syringae derives better osmoprotection from choline than from glycine betaine, unlike most bacteria that have been characterized. In this report, we identified a betaine/carnitine/choline family transporter (BCCT) in P. syringae pv. tomato strain DC3000 that mediates the transport of choline and acetylcholine. This transporter has a particularly low affinity (K(m) of 876 microM) and high capacity (V(max) of 80 nmol/min/mg of protein) for choline transport relative to other known BCCTs. Although BetT activity increased in response to hyperosmolarity, BetT mediated significant uptake under low-osmolarity conditions, suggesting a role in transport for both osmoprotection and catabolism. Growth studies with mutants deficient in BetT and other choline transporters demonstrated that BetT was responsible for the superior osmoprotection conferred to P. syringae by choline over glycine betaine when these compounds were provided at high concentrations (>100 microM). These results suggest that P. syringae has evolved to survive in relatively choline-rich habitats, a prediction that is supported by the common association of P. syringae with plants and the widespread production of choline, but genus- and species-specific production of glycine betaine, by plants. Among the three putative BCCT family transporters in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and six in Pseudomonas putida, different transporters were predicted to function based on similarity to Escherichia coli BetT than to P. syringae BetT. Functional P. putida and P. aeruginosa transporters were identified, and their possession of a long C-terminal tail suggested an osmoregulatory function for this tail; this function was confirmed for P. syringae BetT using deletion derivatives.
TI  - Analysis of the respiratory chain in Ethanologenic Zymomonas mobilis with a cyanide-resistant bd-type ubiquinol oxidase as the only terminal oxidase and its possible physiological roles.
AB  - The respiratory chain of the ethanologenic bacterium Zymomonas mobilis was investigated, in which the pyruvate-to-ethanol pathway has been demonstrated to be mainly responsible for NADH oxidation and the tricarboxylic acid cycle is incomplete. Membranes from cells cultivated under aerobic or anaerobic growth conditions showed dehydrogenase and oxidase activities for NADH, D-lactate and D-glucose and ubiquinol oxidase activity. Intriguingly, the NADH oxidase activity level of membrane fractions from cells grown aerobically was found to be higher than that of membrane fractions from Escherichia coli or Pseudomonas putida grown aerobically, indicating a crucial role of the respiratory chain in NADH oxidation in the organism. Cyanide-resistant terminal oxidase activity was observed and appeared to be due to a bd-type ubiquinol oxidase as the only terminal oxidase encoded by the entire genome. The terminal oxidase with a relatively strong ubiquinol oxidase activity exhibited remarkably weak signals of cytochrome d. Considering these findings and the presence of a type-II NADH dehydrogenase but not a type-I, a simple respiratory chain that generates less energymay have evolved in Z. mobilis.
TI  - Crystallization and preliminary X-ray diffraction studies of the ISC-like [2Fe-2S] ferredoxin (FdxB) from Pseudomonas putida JCM 20004.
AB  - The iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster-biosynthesis (ISC) system of the gamma-proteobacterium Pseudomonas putida JCM 20004 contains a constitutively expressed vertebrate-type [2Fe-2S] ferredoxin, FdxB, which lacks the conserved free cysteine residue near the Fe-S cluster site that has been proposed to function in the catalysis of biological Fe-S cluster assembly in other bacterial homologues. Recombinant FdxB was heterologously overproduced in Escherichia coli, purified and crystallized in its oxidized form by the hanging-drop vapour-diffusion and streak-seeding methods using 1.6 M trisodium citrate dihydrate pH 6.5. The thin needle-shaped crystals diffract to 1.90 A resolution and belong to the hexagonal space group P6(1)22, with unit-cell parameters a = 87.58, c = 73.14 A. The asymmetric unit contains one protein molecule.
TI  - Soj (ParA) DNA binding is mediated by conserved arginines and is essential for plasmid segregation.
AB  - Soj is a member of the ParA family of ATPases involved in plasmid and chromosomal segregation. It binds nonspecifically and cooperatively to DNA although the function of this binding is unknown. Here, we show that mutation of conserved arginine residues that map to the surface of Bacillus subtilis Soj caused only minimal effects on nucleotide-dependent dimerization but had dramatic effects on DNA binding. Using a model plasmid partitioning system in Escherichia coli, we find that Soj DNA-binding mutants are deficient in plasmid segregation. The location of the arginines on the Soj structure explains why DNA binding depends on dimerization and was used to orient the Soj dimer on the DNA, revealing the axis of Soj polymerization. The arginine residues are conserved among other chromosomal homologues, including the ParAs from Caulobacter crescentus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas putida, Streptomyces coelicolor, and chromosome I of Vibrio cholerae indicating that DNA binding is a common feature of members of this family.
TI  - Forest soil metagenome gene cluster involved in antifungal activity expression in Escherichia coli.
AB  - Using two forest soils, we previously constructed two fosmid libraries containing 113,700 members in total. The libraries were screened to select active antifungal clones using Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a target fungus. One clone from the Yuseong pine tree rhizosphere soil library, pEAF66, showed S. cerevisiae growth inhibition. Despite an intensive effort, active chemicals were not isolated. DNA sequence analysis and transposon mutagenesis of pEAF66 revealed 39 open reading frames (ORFs) and indicated that eight ORFs, probably in one transcriptional unit, might be directly involved in the expression of antifungal activity in Escherichia coli. The deduced amino acid sequences of eight ORFs were similar to those of the core genes encoding type II family polyketide synthases, such as the acyl carrier protein (ACP), ACP synthases, aminotransferase, and ACP reductase. The gene cluster involved in antifungal activity was similar in organization to the putative antibiotic production locus of Pseudomonas putida KT2440, although we could not select a similar active clone from the KT2440 genomic DNA library in E. coli. ORFs encoding ATP binding cassette transporters and membrane proteins were located at both ends of the antifungal gene cluster. Upstream ORFs encoding an IclR family response regulator and a LysR family response regulator were involved in the positive regulation of antifungal gene expression. Our results suggested the metagenomic approach as an alternative to search for novel antifungal antibiotics from unculturable soil bacteria. This is the first report of an antifungal gene cluster obtained from a soil metagenome using S. cerevisiae as a target fungus.
TI  - Interplay of different transporters in the mediation of divalent heavy metal resistance in Pseudomonas putida KT2440.
AB  - According to in silico analysis, the genome of Pseudomonas putida KT2440 encodes  at least four Zn/Cd/Pb efflux transporters-two P-type ATPases (CadA1 and CadA2) and two czc chemiosmotic transporters (CzcCBA1 and CzcCBA2). In this study we showed that all these transporters are functional, but under laboratory conditions only two of them were involved in the mediation of heavy metal resistance in P. putida KT2440. CadA2 conferred Cd(2+) and Pb(2+) resistance, whereas CzcCBA1 was involved in export of Zn(2+), Cd(2+), and possibly Pb(2+). CadA1, although nonfunctional in P. putida, improved Zn(2+) resistance and slightly improved Cd(2+) resistance when it was expressed in Escherichia coli. CzcCBA2 contributed to Zn resistance of a czcA1-defective P. putida strain or when the CzcA2 subunit was overexpressed in a transporter-deficient strain. It seemed that CzcA2 could complex with CzcC1 and CzcB1 subunits and therefore complement the loss of CzcA1. The CzcCBA2 transporter itself, however, did not function. Expression of cadA1, cadA2, and czcCBA1 was induced by heavy metals, and the expression levels were dependent on the growth medium and growth phase. Expression of cadA2 and czcCBA1 was nonspecific; both genes were induced by Zn(2+), Cd(2+), Pb(2+), Ni(2+), Co(2+), and Hg(2+). On the other hand, remarkably, expression of cadA1 was induced only by Zn(2+). Possible roles of distinct but simultaneously functioning transporters are discussed.
TI  - Molecular characterization of fprB (ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase) in Pseudomonas putida KT2440.
AB  - The fpr gene, which encodes a ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase, is known to participate in the reversible redox reactions between NADP+/NADPH and electron carriers, such as ferredoxin or flavodoxin. The role of Fpr and its regulatory protein, FinR, in Pseudomonas putida KT2440 on the oxidative and osmotic stress responses has already been characterized [Lee at al. (2006). Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 339, 1246-1254]. In the genome of P. putida KT2440, another Fpr homolog (FprB) has a 35.3% amino acid identity with Fpr. The fprB gene was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The diaphorase activity assay was conducted using purified FprB to identify the function of FprB. In contrast to the fpr gene, the induction of fprB was not affected by oxidative stress agents, such as paraquat, menadione, H2O2 and t-butyl hydroperoxide. However, a higher level of fprB induction was observed under osmotic stress. Targeted disruption of fprB by homologous recombination resulted in a growth defect under high osmotic conditions. Recovery of oxidatively damaged aconitase activity was faster for the fprB mutant than for the fpr mutant, yet still slower than that for the wild type. Therefore, these data suggest that the catalytic function of FprB may have evolved to augment the function of Fpr in P. putida KT2440.
TI  - Isolation and ars detoxification of arsenite-oxidizing bacteria from abandoned arsenic-contaminated mines.
AB  - The ecosystems of certain abandoned mines contain arsenic-resistant bacteria capable of performing detoxification when an ars gene is present in the bacterial genome. The ars gene has already been isolated from Pseudomonas putida and identified as a member of the membrane transport regulatory deoxyribonucleic acid family. The arsenite-oxidizing bacterial strains isolated in the present study were found to grow in the presence of 66.7 mM sodium arsenate (V; Na2HAsO4.7H2O), yet experienced inhibited growth when the sodium arsenite (III; NaAsO2) concentration was higher than 26 mM. Batch experiment results showed that Pseudomonas putida strain OS-5 completely oxidized 1 mM of As(III) to As(V) within 35 h. An arsB gene encoding a membrane transport regulatory protein was observed in arsenite-oxidizing Pseudomonas putida strain OS-5, whereas arsB, arsH, and arrA were detected in strain OS-19, arsD and arsB were isolated from strain RW-18, and arsR, arsD, and arsB were found in E. coli strain OS-80. The leader gene of arsR, -arsD, was observed in a weak acid position. Thus, for bacteria exposed to weak acidity, the ars system may cause changes to the ecosystems of As-contaminated mines. Accordingly, the present results suggest that arsR, arsD, arsAB, arsA, arsB, arsC, arsH, arrA, arrB, aoxA, aoxB, aoxC, aoxD, aroA, and aroB may be useful for arsenite-oxidizing bacteria in abandoned arsenic-contaminated mines.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of flavonoids extracted from bergamot (Citrus bergamia Risso) peel, a byproduct of the essential oil industry.
AB  - AIMS: To evaluate the antimicrobial properties of flavonoid-rich fractions derived from bergamot peel, a byproduct from the Citrus fruit processing industry and the influence of enzymatic deglycosylation on their activity against different bacteria and yeast. METHODS AND RESULTS: Bergamot ethanolic fractions were tested against Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas putida, Salmonella enterica), Gram-positive bacteria (Listeria innocua, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Lactococcus lactis) and the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Bergamot fractions were found to be active against all the Gram-negative bacteria tested, and their antimicrobial potency increased after enzymatic deglycosylation. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of the fractions and the pure flavonoids, neohesperidin, hesperetin (aglycone), neoeriocitrin, eriodictyol (aglycone), naringin and naringenin (aglycone), were found to be in the range 200 to 800 microg ml(-1). The interactions between three bergamot flavonoids were also evaluated. CONCLUSION: The enzyme preparation Pectinase 62L efficiently converted common glycosides into their aglycones from bergamot extracts, and this deglycosylation increased the antimicrobial potency of Citrus flavonoids. Pairwise combinations of eriodictyol, naringenin and hesperetin showed both synergistic and indifferent interactions that were dependent on the test indicator organism. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Bergamot peel is a potential source of natural antimicrobials that are active against Gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of guava (Psidium guajava L.) and Neem (Azadirachta indica A. Juss.) extracts against foodborne pathogens and spoilage bacteria.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of guava (Psidium guajava) and neem (Azadirachta indica) extracts against 21 strains of foodborne pathogens were determined--Listeria monocytogenes (five strains), Staphylococcus aureus (four strains), Escherichia coli O157:H7 (six strains), Salmonella Enteritidis (four strains), Vibrio parahaemolyticus, and Bacillus cereus, and five food spoilage bacteria: Pseudomonas aeroginosa, P. putida, Alcaligenes faecalis, and Aeromonas hydrophila (two strains). Guava and neem extracts showed higher antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria compared to Gram-negative bacteria except for V. parahaemolyticus, P. aeroginosa, and A. hydrophila. None of the extracts showed antimicrobial activity against E. coli O157:H7 and Salmonella Enteritidis. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of ethanol extracts of guava showed the highest inhibition for L. monocytogenes JCM 7676 (0.1 mg/mL), S. aureus JCM 2151 (0.1 mg/mL), S. aureus JCM 2179 (0.1 mg/mL), and V. parahaemolyticus IFO 12711 (0.1 mg/mL) and the lowest inhibition for Alcaligenes faecalis IFO 12669, Aeromonas hydrophila NFRI 8282 (4.0 mg/mL), and A. hydrophila NFRI 8283 (4.0 mg/mL). The MIC of chloroform extracts of neem showed similar inhibition for L. monocytogenes ATCC 43256 (4.0 mg/mL) and L. monocytogenes ATCC 49594 (5.0 mg/mL). However, ethanol extracts of neem showed higher inhibition for S. aureus JCM 2151 (4.5 mg/mL) and S. aureus IFO 13276 (4.5 mg/mL) and the lower inhibition for other microorganisms (6.5 mg/mL). No significant effects of temperature and pH were found on guava and neem extracts against cocktails of L. monocytogenes and S. aureus. The results of the present study suggest that guava and neem extracts possess compounds containing antibacterial properties that can potentially be useful to control foodborne pathogens and spoilage organisms.
TI  - Vanillin production using Escherichia coli cells over-expressing isoeugenol monooxygenase of Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - The isoeugenol monooxygenase gene of Pseudomonas putida IE27 was inserted into an expression vector, pET21a, under the control of the T7 promoter. The recombinant plasmid was introduced into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells, containing no vanillin-degrading activity. The transformed E. coli BL21(DE3) cells produced 28.3 g vanillin/l from 230 mM isoeugenol, with a molar conversion yield of 81% at 20 degrees C after 6 h. In the reaction system, no accumulation of undesired by-products, such as vanillic acid or acetaldehyde, was observed.
TI  - [Changes in electrophysical characteristics of Azospirillum brasilense Sp7 cells  during their interaction with polyclonal antibodies].
AB  - Electrooptical characteristics of Azospirillum brasilense Sp7 cells during their  specific interaction with polyclonal rabbit antibodies were studied. Dependence of optical density of cell suspension during electroorientation of cells from frequency of orienting field in interval 10, 100, 250, and 500 kHz was evaluated. Itwas shown that electrooptical (EO) characteristics of bacterial suspensions change during interaction of A. brasilense cells with antibodies, and maximal changes occur when frequency of oriented field amounts 100-250 kHz. During interaction of A. brasilense Sp7 with strain-specific polyclonal antibodies in the presence of Escherichia coli K-12 and Pseudomonas putida C-11 decrease of amplitude of analytic signal was observed but detection of A. brasilense Sp7 cells was possible. Possibility of detection of microorganisms by EO analysis during their interaction with antibodies was shown.
TI  - Purification and characterization of alkylcatechol 2,3-dioxygenase from butylphenol degradation pathway of Pseudomonas putida MT4.
AB  - Alkylcatechol 2,3-dioxygenase was purified from the cell extract of recombinant Escherichia coli JM109 harboring the alkylcatechol 2,3-dioxygenase gene (bupB) cloned from the butylphenol-degrading bacterium Pseudomonas putida MT4. The purified enzyme (BupB) showed relative meta-cleavage activities for the following catechols: catechol (100%), 4-methylcatechol (572%), 4-n-butylcatechol (185%), 4-n-hexylcatechol (53%), 4-n-heptylcatechol (45%), 4-n-nonylcatechol (10%), 4-tert-butylcatechol (0%), and 3-methylcatechol (33%). The kinetic parameters, namely, K(m) and V(max), for catechol, 4-methylcatechol, and 4-n-butylcatechol, were 23.4, 8.4, and 6.5 microM and 25.8, 76.9, and 18.0 U mg(-1), respectively. These results suggest that BupB has broad substrate specificity for 4-n-alkylcatechols.
TI  - Transport proteins PotD and Crr of Escherichia coli, novel fusion partners for heterologous protein expression.
AB  - The Escherichia coli proteome response to the stressor GdnHCl was analyzed through 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE). We identified PotD (spermidine/putrescine-binding periplasmic protein) and Crr [glucose-specific phosphotransferase (PTS) enzyme IIA component] as a stress-responsive protein. Even under a stress situation where the total number of soluble proteins decreased by about 10%, 3.5- and 2.2-fold increase was observed in the synthesis of PotD and Crr, respectively. As fusion partners, PotD and Crr dramatically increased the solubility of many aggregation-prone heterologous proteins [e.g. human minipro-insulin (mp-INS), human epidermal growth factor (EGF), human prepro-ghrelin (ppGRN), human interleukin-2(hIL-2), human activation induced cytidine deaminase (AID), human glutamate decarboxylase (GAD(448-585)), Pseudomonas putida cutinase (CUT), human ferritin light chain (hFTN-L), human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), and cold autoinflammatory syndrome1 protein (NALP3) Nacht domain (NACHT)] in the E. coli cytoplasm. Presumably PotD and Crr were very effective in shielding interactive surfaces of heterologous proteins associated with non-specific protein-protein interactions leading to the formation of inclusion bodies most likely due to intrinsic high folding efficiency, chaperone-like activity, or a combination of both factors. Both the stress-induced proteins were well suited for the production of a biologically active fusion mutant of P. putida cutinase that can be expected to be of biotechnological and commercial interest.
TI  - Solubilization of aggregation-prone heterologous proteins by covalent fusion of stress-responsive Escherichia coli protein, SlyD.
AB  - The proteome profile of Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) generated in response to heat  shock stress was analyzed by two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE), wherein we identified a FKBP-type peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerse (PPIases), SlyD, as a stress-responsive (i.e. aggregation-resistant) protein. Even under an imposed severe stress condition where 29 out of 858 soluble proteins were totally eliminated and the synthesis levels of 171 proteins decreased over 5-fold, a 3.37-fold increase induced by heat shock treatment was observed in the synthesis level of SlyD compared with a non-stress condition. As a fusion partner, as well as solubility enhancer, SlyD facilitated folding and significantly increased the solubility of many aggregation-prone heterologous proteins in E. coli cytoplasm. SlyD was very effective in sequestering interactive surfaces of heterologous proteins associated with non-specific protein-protein interactions and the formation of inclusion bodies, most likely as a result of intrinsic folding efficiencies and/or chaperone-like activities. SlyD was also shown to be suitable for the production of a biologically active fusion mutant of Pseudomonas putida cutinase that is of considerable biotechnological and commercial interest.
TI  - Non-UV based germicidal activity of metal-doped TiO2 coating on solid surfaces.
AB  - A stain-based screening method was developed to screen different catalyst coatings for their germicidal activity. A Baclight dead/live bacteria viability kit (invitrogen, molecular probes) was used for staining the cell. The screening was carried out following a standard procedure. This included loading cell suspension to solid surface and maintaining contact for 30 min, then staining with a mixture containing dyes. The stained cells were observed using an epifluorescent microscope and photographed with a CCD camera under UV. Metal-doped TiO2 coatings on Al plates were prepared and tested for non-UV germicidal activity without using UV. It was tested using model microorganisms such as Bakers Yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas putida, and Escherichia coli. On the basis of the germicidal activity of catalyst and the degree of damage caused to the cells, the stained cells may appear green (viable), green with red or yellow nuclei and yellow (compromised) or red (nonviable). According to their stained color, cells were counted to calculate the percentage of dead, live, and compromised cells. Compromised cells are cells that grow very slowly after reculturing indicating a degree of reversible cell damage. Screening the germicidal activity using this staining method is accurate and efficient, and requires less time than the culture-based method. A modification to the procedure for measuring germicidal activity of rough surfaces or fibrous coatings was developed. Both TiO2 and metal-doped TiO2 (Ag, Pt, Au, Cu) possess non-UV based germicidal activity. The germicidal activity of TiO2 was found to be related with its wetting property and can be improved by UV irradiation before testing. It is not greatly affected by contact time, indicating a fast acting germicidal activity.
TI  - Cosubstrate-induced dynamics of D-3-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase from Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - D-3-Hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase from Pseudomonas putida belongs to the family of short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases. We have determined X-ray structures of the D-3-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase from Pseudomonas putida, which was recombinantly expressed in Escherichia coli, in three different crystal forms to resolutions between 1.9 and 2.1 A. The so-called substrate-binding loop (residues 187-210) was partially disordered in several subunits, in both the presence and absence of NAD(+). However, in two subunits, this loop was completely defined in an open conformation in the apoenzyme and in a closed conformation in the complex structure with NAD(+). Structural comparisons indicated that the loop moves as a rigid body by about 46 degrees . However, the two small alpha-helices (alphaFG1 and alphaFG2) of the loop also re-orientated slightly during the conformational change. Probably, the interactions of Val185, Thr187 and Leu189 with the cosubstrate induced the conformational change. A model of the binding mode of the substrate D-3-hydroxybutyrate indicated that the loop in the closed conformation, as a result of NAD(+) binding, is positioned competent for catalysis. Gln193 is the only residue of the substrate-binding loop that interacts directly with the substrate. A translation, libration and screw (TLS) analysis of the rigid body movement of the loop in the crystal showed significant librational displacements, describing the coordinated movement of the substrate-binding loop in the crystal. NAD(+) binding increased the flexibility of the substrate-binding loop and shifted the equilibrium between the open and closed forms towards the closed form. The finding that all NAD(+) -bound subunits are present in the closed form and all NAD(+) -free subunits in the open form indicates that the loop closure is induced by cosubstrate binding alone. This mechanism may contribute to the sequential binding of cosubstrate followed by substrate.
TI  - The Acinetobacter sp. chnB promoter together with its cognate positive regulator  ChnR is an attractive new candidate for metabolic engineering applications in bacteria.
AB  - Over the last 10 years there has been an extremely fast development in the global characterization of bacteria at the genome, transcriptome, proteome and metabolome levels. To further explore and apply these complex data sets there is now a need for new biological tools that can be used to test or verify hypotheses generated on the basis of all the new information. Here, we report the integration of an expression cassette based on the Acinetobacter sp. chnB promoter and its cognate positive regulator chnR gene into a replicon derived from the broad-host-range plasmid RK2. Cyclohexanone was found to be the most efficient inducer of this system in Escherichia coli, using firefly luciferase as a reporter. To explore the potential of the system in another species, we show that the system can be used in combination with another similar expression cassette (Pm/xylS) to control the monomer composition of the industrially widely used exopolysaccharide alginate, produced by Pseudomonas fluorescens.
TI  - Cohabitation of two different lexA regulons in Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - In contrast to the vast majority of the members of the domain Bacteria, several Pseudomonas and Xanthomonas species have two lexA genes, whose products have been shown to recognize different LexA binding motifs, making them an interesting target for studying the interplay between cohabiting LexA regulons in a single species. Here we report an analysis of the genetic composition of the two LexA regulons of Pseudomonas putida KT2440 performed with a genomic microarray. The data obtained indicate that one of the two LexA proteins (LexA1) seems to be in control of the conventional Escherichia coli-like SOS response, while the other LexA protein (LexA2) regulates only its own transcriptional unit, which includes the imuA, imuB, and dnaE2 genes, and a gene (PP_3901) from a resident P. putida prophage. Furthermore, PP_3901 is also regulated by LexA1 and is required for DNA damage-mediated induction of several P. putida resident prophage genes. In silico searches suggested that this marked asymmetry in regulon contents also occurs in other Pseudomonas species with two lexA genes, and the implications of this asymmetry in the evolution of the SOS network are discussed.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of a benzoylformate decarboxylase and a NAD+/NADP+-dependent benzaldehyde dehydrogenase involved in D-phenylglycine metabolism in Pseudomonas stutzeri ST-201.
AB  - Following induction with D-phenylglycine both d-phenylglycine aminotransferase activity and benzoylformate decarboxylase activity were observed in cultures of Pseudomonas stutzeri ST-201. Induction with benzoylformate, on the other hand, induced only benzoylformate decarboxylase activity. Purification of the benzoylformate decarboxylase, followed by N-terminal sequencing, enabled the design of probes for hybridization with P. stutzeri ST-201 genomic DNA libraries. Sequencing of two overlapping genomic DNA restriction fragments revealed two open reading frames which were denoted dpgB and dpgC. Sequence alignments suggested that the genes encoded a thiamin-diphosphate-dependent decarboxylase and an aldehyde dehydrogenase, respectively. Both genes were isolated and expressed in Escherichia coli. The dpgB gene product was confirmed as a benzoylformate decarboxylase while the dpgC gene product was characterized as a NAD+/NADP+-dependent benzaldehyde dehydrogenase. In keeping with their high sequence identities (both greater than 85%) the kinetic properties of the two enzymes were similar to those of the homologous enzymes in the mandelate pathway of Pseudomonas putida ATCC 12633. However, Pseudomonas stutzeri ST-201 was unable to grow on either isomer of mandelate, and sequencing indicated that the dpgB gene did not form part of an operon. Thus it appears that the two enzymes form part of a d-phenylglycine, rather than mandelate, degrading pathway.
TI  - Preparation, crystallization and preliminary crystallographic analysis of old yellow enzyme from Trypanosoma cruzi.
AB  - Old yellow enzyme (OYE) is an NADPH oxidoreductase that contains a flavin mononucleotide as a prosthetic group. The OYE from Trypanosoma cruzi, which produces prostaglandin F(2alpha), a potent mediator of various physiological and pathological processes, from prostaglandin H2. The protein was recombinantly expressed and purified from Escherichia coli and was crystallized using the hanging-drop vapour-diffusion method. The crystal belongs to the monoclinic space group P2(1), with unit-cell parameters a = 56.3, b = 78.8, c = 78.8 A, beta = 93.4 degrees and two molecules per asymmetric unit. The crystals were suitable for X-ray crystallographic studies and diffracted to 1.70 A resolution. A Patterson search method is in progress using the structure of OYE from Pseudomonas putida as a starting model.
TI  - Ultrasound-mediated DNA transfer for bacteria.
AB  - In environmental microbiology, the most commonly used methods of bacterial DNA transfer are conjugation and electroporation. However, conjugation requires physical contact and cell-pilus-cell interactions; electroporation requires low-ionic strength medium and high voltage. These limitations have hampered broad applications of bacterial DNA delivery. We have employed a standard low frequency 40 kHz ultrasound bath to successfully transfer plasmid pBBR1MCS2 into Pseudomonas putida UWC1, Escherichia coli DH5alpha and Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW25 with high efficiency. Under optimal conditions: ultrasound exposure time of 10 s, 50 mM CaCl(2), temperature of 22 degrees C, plasmid concentration of 0.8 ng/microl, P. putida UWC1 cell concentration of 2.5 x 10(9) CFU (colony forming unit)/ml and reaction volume of 500 microl, the efficiency of ultrasound DNA delivery (UDD) was 9.8 +/- 2.3 x 10(-6) transformants per cell, which was nine times more efficient than conjugation, and even four times greater than electroporation. We have also transferred pBBR1MCS2 into E. coli DH5alpha and P. fluorescens SBW25 with efficiencies of 1.16 +/- 0.13 x 10(-6) and 4.33 +/- 0.78 x 10(-6) transformants per cell, respectively. Low frequency UDD can be readily scaled up, allowing for the application of UDD not only in laboratory conditions but also on an industrial scale.
TI  - Ecotoxicity and genotoxicity assessment of cytostatic pharmaceuticals.
AB  - The fate and effects of cytostatic (anticancer or antineoplastic) pharmaceuticals in the environment are largely unknown, but they can contaminate wastewater treatment effluents and consequently aquatic ecosystems. In this paper, we have focused on five cytostatic compounds used in high amounts (cyclophosphamide, cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil, doxorubicin, and etoposide), and we have investigated their ecotoxicity in bacterial Pseudomonas putida growth-inhibition test, algal Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata growth-inhibition test, and Dapnia magna acute immobilization test. Genotoxicity also was assessed with Escherichia coli SOS-chromotest (with and without metabolic activation) and the GreenScreen Assay using yeast S. cerevisiae. All tested compounds showed significant effects in most of the assays with lowest-observed-effect concentrations and concentrations causing 50% effects (EC50s) values ranging within microg/L to mg/L. The most toxic compound was 5-fluorouracil in the assays with P. putida (EC50 = 0.027 mg/L) and P. subcapitata (EC50 = 0.11 mg/L), although cisplatin and doxorubicin were the most toxic to D. magna (EC50 = 0.64 and 2.0 mg/L, respectively). These two chemicals were also the most genotoxic in the SOS-chromotest (minimum genotoxic concentrations [MGC] = 0.07-0.2 mg/L), and 5-fluorouracil was the most genotoxic in the eukaryotic yeast assay (MGC = 0.02 mg/L). Our investigation seems to indicate generally lower risks of acute effects at concentrations expected in the environment. However, some effective concentrations were relatively low and chronic toxicity of cytostatics (and/or their transformation products), as well as specific sources of human pharmaceuticals such as hospital effluents, require research attention.
TI  - [Screening of strain producing an novel esterase with high enantioselectivity and molecular cloning of the enzyme gene].
AB  - A novel strain producing an enantioselective lipolytic enzyme was isolated from soil samples, and identified as Pseudomonas putida NH33. A genomic library of P. putida NH33 was constructed and screened for esterase activity in E. coli. One positive clone was isolated, and subsequent analyses of the plasmid by restriction mapping revealed a 4.7kb DNA fragment carrying esterase gene. The nucleotide sequence of the DNA was found to contain an open reading frame of 1142 nucleotides encoding esterase of 381 amino acid residues and designated PPEst. The primary structure of the esterase exhibited 35%-40% homology to those of related enzymes from various sources and 80%-90% homology to esterases from the genus Pseudomonas. Amino acid sequence deduced from the nucleotide sequence contains of the consensus active site sequence, GXSXG, of serine esterase. The PPEst fragments were cloned into the expression vector pET-22b( + ) and transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3), and the recombinant protein fused with 6 x His at its C-terminus was purified to homogeneity by a single immobilized metal ion affinity chromatographic step. The molecular mass of the esterase was determined to be approximately 42kDa by SDS-PAGE. The purified enzyme could convert ethyl esters of 2-arylpropanoic acid to S-isomer of 2-arylpropanoic acids with an optical purity of > 99%. The result suggests that this esterase is excellent biocatalyst for synthesis of chiral pharmaceuticals. The enzyme is an novel esterase, and its nucleotide sequence has been submitted to GenBank under accession number AY896293.
TI  - [Cloning and expression of catA gene from Pseudomonas putida ND6 and study on the catechol cleavage pathway].
AB  - Catechol 1,2-dioxygenase gene, calA, from naphthalene-degrading plasmid pND6-1 of Pseudomonas putida ND6, was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. Enzymic properties of the expressed product were investigated. The results indicated that the Km and Vmax of the enzyme are 0.019 mol/L and 1.434 mol/(min x mg), respectively. The enzyme possessed a thermal stability and 93.7% activity was retained after incubating at 50 degrees C for 45 min. Fe2+ could enhance the enzyme activity by 292%. The enzyme displayed a lower activity against 4-chlorocatechol and belongs to group I of catechol 1,2-dioxygenases. When naphthalene was used as a substrate for growth of strain ND6, catechol 1, 2-dioxygenase and catechol 2,3-dioxygenase activities were both detected in their crude extract. However, when strain ND6 was grown on benzoate, rho-hydroxybenzoic acid or phenylacetic acid as a sole source of carbon the activity of catechol 1,2-dioxygenase was much higher than that of catechol 2,3-dioxygenase. These indicated that strain ND6 is able to metabolize naphthalene by catechol meta- and ortho-cleavage pathways. When benzoate, rho-hydroxybenzoic acid and phenylacetic acid were used as growth substrates, strain ND6 degrades these compounds only by catechol ortho-cleavage pathway.
TI  - The influence of green fluorescent protein incorporation on bacterial physiology: a note of caution.
AB  - AIMS: To investigate the effect of green flourescent protein (GFP) incorporation  on bacterial physiology. METHODS AND RESULTS: Comparisons were made between four different isogenic pairings of non-GFP-containing parents and their GFP-containing transformants with respect to growth rate and antimicrobial susceptibility. For the latter, sensitivities to 12 different antibiotics were measured initially by disc-diffusion assay, and then subsequently by generation of dose-dependent survival curves for 1 h exposure to different concentrations of tetracycline, ciprofloxacin and cetrimide USP. Whilst no significant difference in growth rate was observed, GFP-containing strains were uniformly and significantly more sensitive to all antimicrobial agents tested, excluding the beta-lactams, than their respective non-GFP-containing counterparts. CONCLUSIONS: GFP incorporation has a significant effect on bacterial physiology and can modulate antimicrobial susceptibility. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Transformation with GFP can affect the physiology of bacterial cells. This may therefore affect the quality and accuracy of data generated depending on the application for which GFP is used.
TI  - [The effect of long-term preservation of microbial cells immobilized in poly(vinyl alcohol) cryogel on their viability and biosynthesis of target metabolites].
AB  - The effect of cell storage at -18 degrees C for 18-24 months on reproductive capacity was investigated for various microorganisms (gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, yeasts, and filamentous fungi) immobilized in poly(vinyl alcohol) cryogel. To examine the viability of immobilized cells after defrosting, the bioluminescent method of intracellular ATP determination was used. A high level of metabolic activity of immobilized cells after various periods of storage was recorded for Streptomyces anulatus, Rhizopus orvzae, and Escherichia coli, which are producers of the antibiotic aurantin, L(+)-lactic acid, and the recombinant enzyme organophosphate hydrolase, respectively. It was shown that the initial concentration of immobilized cells in cryogel granules plays an important role in the survival of Str. anulatus and Pseudomonas putida after 1.5 years of storage. It was found that, after slow defrosting in the storage medium at 50C for 18 h of immobilized cells of the yeast Saccharomvces cerevisiae that had been stored for nine months, the number of reproductive cells increased due to the formation of ascospores.
TI  - P450 enzymes from the bacterium Novosphingobium aromaticivorans.
AB  - Twelve of the fifteen potential P450 enzymes from the bacterium Novosphingobium aromaticivorans, which is known to degrade a wide range of aromatic hydrocarbons, have been produced via heterologous expression in Escherichia coli. The enzymes were tested for their ability to bind a range of substrates including polyaromatic hydrocarbons. While two of the enzymes were found to bind aromatic compounds (CYP108D1 and CYP203A2), the others show binding with a variety of compounds including linear alkanes (CYP153C1) and mono- and sesqui-terpenoid compounds (CYP101B1, CYP101C1, CYP101D1, CYP101D2, CYP111A1, and CYP219A1). A 2Fe-2S ferredoxin (Arx-A), which is associated with CYP101D2, was also produced. The activity of five of the P450 enzymes (CYP101B1, CYP101C1, CYP101D1, CYP101D2, and CYP111A2) was reconstituted with Arx-A and putidaredoxin reductase (of the P450cam system from Pseudomonas putida) in a Class I type electron transfer system. Preliminary characterisation of the majority of the substrate oxidation products is reported.
TI  - Crystallization and diffraction data of 1H-3-hydroxy-4-oxoquinoline 2,4-dioxygenase: a cofactor-free oxygenase of the alpha/beta-hydrolase family.
AB  - 1H-3-Hydroxy-4-oxoquinoline 2,4-dioxygenase (QDO) from Pseudomonas putida 33/1 catalyses the oxygenolysis of 1H-3-hydroxy-4-oxoquinoline to form N-formylanthranilic acid and carbon monoxide without the aid of cofactors. Both N-terminally His6-tagged and native QDO were overexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified by conventional chromatographic procedures. Untagged QDO, but not His6-tagged QDO, was crystallized by the vapour-diffusion method, giving hexagonal bipyramid crystals belonging to space group P6(1)22. Selenomethionine-containing native QDO was prepared and crystallized under identical conditions. The unit-cell parameters were a = b = 90.1, c = 168.6 A, alpha = beta = 90, gamma = 120 degrees. Using synchrotron radiation, these crystals diffract to 2.5 A. The expression, purification and crystallization of QDO are reported here.
TI  - Identification and properties of an inducible phenylacyl-CoA dehydrogenase in Pseudomonas putida KT2440.
AB  - A novel acyl-CoA dehydrogenase that initiates beta-oxidation of the side chains of phenylacyl-CoA compounds by Pseudomonas putida was induced by growth with phenylhexanoate as carbon source. It was identified as the product of gene PP_0368, which was cloned and overexpressed in Escherichia coli. This phenylacyl-CoA dehydrogenase was found to be dimeric with a subunit molecular mass of 66 kDa, to contain FAD and to be active with phenylacyl-CoA substrates having side chains from four to at least 11 carbon atoms. The same enzyme was induced by the aliphatic alkanoate octanoate. The optimal aliphatic substrates for the enzyme were palmitoyl-CoA and stearoyl-CoA, a property shared with mammalian very-long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenases. The FAD in the enzyme was reduced by aromatic and aliphatic substrates, with changes to the oxidation-reduction potential. Chemical reduction by dithionite ion and oxidation by ferricyanide ion showed that the enzyme can accept four electrons: two to reduce the flavin and two to slowly reduce an unknown acceptor, which in its reduced form interacts with the oxidized flavin in a charge-transfer complex. The experiments identify for the first time an acyl-CoA dehydrogenase that oxidizes the activated forms of aromatic acids similar to those used to first demonstrate the biological beta-oxidation of fatty acids.
TI  - Escherichia coli malate dehydrogenase, a novel solubility enhancer for heterologous proteins synthesized in Escherichia coli.
AB  - Using 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis, the Escherichia coli proteome response to a heat-shock stress was analyzed and a 1.6-fold increase of malate dehydrogenase was observed even under the heat-shock condition where the total number of soluble proteins decreased by about 5%. We subsequently demonstrated that, as an N-terminus fusion expression partner, malate dehydrogenase facilitated the folding of, and dramatically increased the solubility of, many aggregation-prone heterologous proteins in E. coli cytoplasm. Therefore, malate dehydrogenase is well suited for production of a biologically active fusion mutant of cutinase (Pseudomonas putida origin) that is currently of considerable to biotechnology and commercial industries.
TI  - Gene cloning, expression, and substrate specificity of an imidase from the strain Pseudomonas putida YZ-26.
AB  - A gene-encoding imidase was isolated from Pseudomonas putdia YZ-26 genomic DNA using a combination of polymerase chain reaction and activity screening the recombinant. Analysis of the nucleotide sequence revealed that an open reading frame (ORF) of 879 bp encoded a protein of 293 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 33712.6 kDa. The deduced amino-acid sequence showed 78% identity with the imidase from Alcaligenes eutrophus 112R4 and 80% identity with N-terminal 20 amino-acid imidase from Blastobacter sp. A17p-4. Next, the ORF was subcloned into vector pET32a to form recombinant plasmid pEI. The enzyme was overexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity by Ni(2+)-NTA column, with 75% activity recovery. The subunit molecular mass of the recombinant imidase as estimated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was approximately 36 kDa, whereas its functional unit was approximately 141 kDa with four identical subunits determined by size-exclusion chromatography. The purified enzyme showed the highest activity and affinity toward succinimide, and some other substrates, such as dihydrouracil, hydantoin, succinimide, and maleimde, were investigated.
TI  - Cloning, expression and characterization of a Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenase from  Pseudomonas putida KT2440.
AB  - The gene encoding a Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenase and identified in Pseudomonas putida KT2440 was cloned and functionally expressed in Escherichia coli. The highest yield of soluble protein could be achieved by co-expression of molecular chaperones. In order to determine the substrate specificity, biocatalyses were performed using crude cell extract, growing and resting cells. Examination of aromatic, cyclic and aliphatic ketones revealed a high specificity towards short-chain aliphatic ketones. Interestingly, some open-chain ketones were converted to the alkylacetates, while for others formation of the ester products with oxygen on the other side of the keto group could also be detected yielding the corresponding methyl or ethyl esters.
TI  - Use of a PNA probe to block DNA-mediated PCR product formation in prokaryotic RT-PCR.
AB  - A novel method eliminating DNA-mediated PCR product formation in reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) amplification of specific RNA sequences is described. The method exploits the higher melting temperature values of peptide nucleic acid (PNA)/DNA duplexes compared with DNA/DNA duplexes by binding a sequence-specific PNA probe to a genomic sequence immediately overlapping one of the PCR-primer attachment sites within the sequence of interest. Hybridization of the blocking probe precludes primer attachment to DNA without affecting attachment of the same primer to the reverse transcription-generated cDNA sequence. A four-step PCR cycle is used that allows the PNA probe to hybridize to the DNA strand at a higher temperature just prior to the primer annealing step.
TI  - Model-based characterization of an amino acid racemase from Pseudomonas putida DSM 3263 for application in medium-constrained continuous processes.
AB  - The amino acid racemase with broad substrate specificity from Pseudomonas putida  DSM 3263 was overproduced and characterized with respect to application in an integrated multi-step process (e.g., dynamic kinetic resolution) that--theoretically--would allow for 100% chemical yield and 100% enantiomeric excess. Overexpression of the racemase gene in Escherichia coli delivered cell free extract with easily sufficient activity (20-50 U mg(-1) total protein) for application in an enzyme membrane reactor (EMR) setting. Model-based experimental analysis of a set of enzyme assays clearly indicated that racemization of the model substrates D- or L-methionine could be accurately described by reversible Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The corresponding kinetic parameters were determined from progress curves for the entire suitable set of aqueous-organic mixtures (up to 60% methanol and 40% acetonitrile) that are eligible for an integrated process scheme. The resulting kinetic expression could be successfully applied to describe enzyme membrane reactor performance under a large variety of settings. Model-based calculations suggested that a methanol content of 10% and an acetonitrile content of 20% provide maximum productivity in EMR operations. However product concentrations were decreased in comparison to purely aqueous operation due to decreasing solubility of methionine with increasing organic solvent content. Finally, biocatalyst stability was investigated in different solvent compositions following a model-based approach. Buffer without organic content provided excellent stability at moderate temperatures (20-35 degrees C) while addition of 20% acetonitrile or methanol drastically reduced the half-life of the racemase.
TI  - The transcriptional repressor TtgV recognizes a complex operator as a tetramer and induces convex DNA bending.
AB  - The TtgV repressor belongs to the large but infrequently investigated IclR family of transcriptional regulators. Although members of this family usually exhibit high effector specificity, TtgV possesses multidrug binding properties. The TtgV protein regulates the expression of the ttgGHI operon encoding the main solvent extrusion pump of the extremophile Pseudomonas putida DOT-T1E strain. Here we used a multidisciplinary approach to study the functional oligomeric state of TtgV during repression and derepression events, as well as the molecular basis of TtgV-DNA operator interactions. Analytical ultracentrifugation studies (AUC) show that TtgV is a tetramer in solution and that this oligomeric state does not change in the presence of effectors. We also show that the binding of effectors leads to the dissociation of TtgV as a tetramer from the DNA-TtgV complex. Previous dimethyl sulfate and DNase I footprints revealed that TtgV protected a 42 bp region. Based on AUC, electrophorectic mobility shift assays and isothermal titration calorimetry analyses we show that TtgV recognition specificity is restricted within this operator to a 34-nucleotide stretch and that TtgV may interact with intercalated inverted repeats that share no significant DNA sequence similarities within this short 34-nucleotide segment. Binding stoichiometry is one TtgV tetramer per operator, and affinity for its target DNA is around 200 nM. Circular dichroism analysis reveals that TtgV binding causes DNA distortion and atomic force microscopy imaging of TtgV-DNA operator complexes shows that TtgV induces a 57 degrees convex bend in its operator DNA. We propose that the mechanism of TtgV repression is based on the steric occlusion of the RNA polymerase binding site reinforced by DNA-bending of the ttgV-ttgG promoter region.
TI  - Isolation and endotoxin activities of lipopolysaccharides from cyanobacterial cultures and complex water blooms and comparison with the effects of heterotrophic bacteria and green alga.
AB  - Massive cyanobacterial water blooms are serious environmental and health problems worldwide. While some cyanobacterial toxins such as peptide microcystins have been investigated extensively, other toxic components of cyanobacteria (e.g. lipopolysaccharides, LPS) are poorly understood. The present study characterized endotoxin activities of LPS isolated from (i) laboratory cyanobacterial cultures, (ii) cyanobacterial water bloom samples dominated by Microcystis sp., Planktothrix sp., Aphanizomenon sp. and Anabaena sp., (iii) heterotrophic Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli, Kluyvera intermedia, Pseudomonas putida and Pseudomonas fluorescens and (iv) green alga Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata. Toxicity results derived with Limulus amebocyte lysate assay (LAL-test) showed that endotoxin activities of LPS from both cyanobacteria and heterotrophic bacteria were comparable and the values were within a similar range (1 x 10(3)-1 x 10(6) Endotoxin Units, EU, per mg of isolated LPS). The highest activities among the cyanobacterial samples were observed in the Aphanizomenon sp. dominated water bloom. The results also suggest generally higher endotoxin activities in complex natural samples than in laboratory cyanobacterial cultures. Further, experiments with the eukaryotic green alga P. subcapitata demonstrated a need for careful purification of the LPS extracts prior to testing with the LAL assay as several contaminants may overestimate endotoxin activities. This study shows relatively high pyrogenicity of LPS from various cyanobacteria. Further research should focus on detailed toxicological and ecotoxicological characterization of LPS in massive cyanobacterial water blooms.
TI  - Evaluation of genotoxicity and pro-oxidant effect of the azo dyes: acids yellow 17, violet 7 and orange 52, and of their degradation products by Pseudomonas putida mt-2.
AB  - Acids yellow 17, violet 7 and orange 52, very important commercial azo dyes used  in the textile, food, paper and cosmetic industries, were degraded by Pseudomonas putida mt-2 at concentrations up to 100mg/l. The culture media was completely decolorized under static incubation for 60 h, this faster than under continuous shaking incubation. SOS chromotest using Escherichia coli PQ37, with and without metabolic activation (S-9 preparations), was used to assess genotoxicity potential of these dyes before and after biodegradation. None of these dyes or their metabolites was found to be genotoxic in the absence of "Araclor-Induced rat liver microsome" preparations (S-9). However, in presence of the preparation S-9, the genotoxicity of the biodegradation products was highlighted. Metabolites resulting from static cultures were more genotoxic than those obtained in shaken conditions. In addition to genotoxic effects, metabolites have shown a significant ability to induce the formation of superoxide free radical anion (O(2)(*-)). The toxicities generated by the pure azo dyes and the pure azo-reduction products (sulfanilic acid, N,N'-dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine and 4'-aminoacetanilid) were compared. These results suggest that P. putida mt-2 degrades the studied azo dyes in two steps: an azo-reduction followed by an oxygen-dependent metabolization. Some of the derived metabolites would be responsible of genotoxicity and metabolic toxicity.
TI  - Sampling for metabolome analysis of microorganisms.
AB  - In the present work we investigated the most commonly applied methods used for sampling of microorganisms in the field of metabolomics in order to unravel potential sources of error previously ignored but of utmost importance for accurate metabolome analysis. To broaden the significance of our study, we investigated different Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, i.e., Bacillus subtilis, Corynebacterium glutamicum, Escherichia coli, Gluconobacter oxydans, Pseudomonas putida, and Zymononas mobilis, and analyzed metabolites from different catabolic and anabolic intracellular pathways. Quenching of cells with cold methanol prior to cell separation and extraction led to drastic loss (>60%) of all metabolites tested due to unspecific leakage. Using fast filtration, Gram-negative bacteria also revealed a significant loss (>80%) when inappropriate washing solutions with low ionic strength were applied. Adapting the ionic strength of the washing solution to that of the cultivation medium could almost completely avoid this problem. Gram-positive strains did not show significant leakage independent of the washing solution. Fast filtration with sampling times of several seconds prior to extraction appears to be a suitable approach for metabolites with relatively high intracellular level and low turnover such as amino acids or TCA cycle intermediates. Comparison of metabolite levels in the culture supernatant and the cell interior revealed that the common assumption of whole broth quenching protocols attributing the metabolites found exclusively to the intracellular pools may not be valid in many cases. In such cases a differential approach correcting for medium-contained metabolites is required.
TI  - A marine Mesorhizobium sp. produces structurally novel long-chain N-acyl-L-homoserine lactones.
AB  - Our study focused on a Mesorhizobium sp. that is phylogenetically affiliated by 16S rRNA gene sequence to other marine and saline bacteria of this genus. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry investigations of the extract obtained from solid-phase extraction of cultures of this bacterium indicated the presence of several N-acyl homoserine lactones (AHLs), with chain lengths of C(10) to C(16). Chromatographic separation of the active bacterial extract yielded extraordinarily large amounts of two unprecedented acylated homoserine lactones, 5-cis-3-oxo-C(12)-homoserine lactone (5-cis-3-oxo-C(12)-HSL) (compound 1) and 5-cis-C(12)-HSL (compound 2). Quorum-sensing activity of compounds 1 and 2 was shown in two different biosensor systems [Escherichia coli MT102(pSB403) and Pseudomonas putida F117(pKR-C12)]. Furthermore, it was shown that both compounds can restore protease and pyoverdin production of an AHL-deficient Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 lasI rhlI double mutant, suggesting that these signal molecules maybe used for intergenus signaling. In conclusion, these data indicate that the quorum-sensing activity of compounds 1 and 2 is modulated by the chain length and functional groups of the acyl moiety. Additionally, compound 1 showed antibacterial and cytotoxic activities.
TI  - Degradation of alkyl methyl ketones by Pseudomonas veronii MEK700.
AB  - Pseudomonas veronii MEK700 was isolated from a biotrickling filter cleaning 2-butanone-loaded waste air. The strain is able to grow on 2-butanone and 2-hexanol. The genes for degradation of short chain alkyl methyl ketones were identified by transposon mutagenesis using a newly designed transposon, mini-Tn5495, and cloned in Escherichia coli. DNA sequence analysis of a 15-kb fragment revealed three genes involved in methyl ketone degradation. The deduced amino acid sequence of the first gene, mekA, had high similarity to Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenases; the protein of the second gene, mekB, had similarity to homoserine acetyltransferases; the third gene, mekR, encoded a putative transcriptional activator of the AraC/XylS family. The three genes were located between two gene groups: one comprising a putative phosphoenolpyruvate synthase and glycogen synthase, and the other eight genes for the subunits of an ATPase. Inactivation of mekA and mekB by insertion of the mini-transposon abolished growth of P. veronii MEK700 on 2-butanone and 2-hexanol. The involvement of mekR in methyl ketone degradation was observed by heterologous expression of mekA and mekB in Pseudomonas putida. A fragment containing mekA and mekB on a plasmid was not sufficient to allow P. putida KT2440 to grow on 2-butanone. Not until all three genes were assembled in the recombinant P. putida was it able to use 2-butanone as carbon source. The Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenase activity of MekA was clearly demonstrated by incubating a mekB transposon insertion mutant of P. veronii with 2-butanone. Hereby, ethyl acetate was accumulated. To our knowledge, this is the first time that ethyl acetate by gas chromatographic analysis has been definitely demonstrated to be an intermediate of MEK degradation. The mekB-encoded protein was heterologously expressed in E. coli and purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography. The protein exhibited high esterase activity towards short chain esters like ethyl acetate and 4-nitrophenyl acetate.
TI  - Biodiversity of chloramphenicol-resistant mesophilic heterotrophs from Southeast  Asian aquaculture environments.
AB  - In the present study, samples of pond water, sediment and farmed species were collected at 12 fish and shrimp farms in Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam to determine the biodiversity and environmental distribution of chloramphenicol-resistant (CmR) mesophilic heterotrophs in Southeast Asian aquaculture sites. Following isolation on Iso-Sensitest agar supplemented with 35mug ml(-1) Cm and dereplication using (GTG)(5)-PCR fingerprinting, 557 genotypically unique CmR strains were subjected to polyphasic identification. The 557 mesophilic heterotrophic CmR isolates represented 18 different genera largely dominated by the genera Escherichia (40.2%), Pseudomonas (11.7%), Acinetobacter (11.1%), Klebsiella (7.5%) and Bacillus (5.9%). A total of 439 CmR isolates were further assigned to 31 described species or species groups, mainly including organisms that have been associated with various human opportunistic infections such as Escherichia coli (n=219), Pseudomonas putida (n=47), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=38) and Acinetobacter baumannii (n=23). Strains of Escherichia, and most notably, of E. coli, were the only common group of CmR heterotrophs irrespective of country, sample type or farm type. Together with other predominant but less widespread groups such as acinetobacters and pseudomonads, the results of this biodiversity study suggest that E. coli can be regarded as a potential indicator of Cm resistance in Southeast Asian aquaculture environments.
TI  - Characterization of a pseudomonad 2-nitrobenzoate nitroreductase and its catabolic pathway-associated 2-hydroxylaminobenzoate mutase and a chemoreceptor involved in 2-nitrobenzoate chemotaxis.
AB  - Pseudomonas fluorescens strain KU-7 is a prototype microorganism that metabolizes 2-nitrobenzoate (2-NBA) via the formation of 3-hydroxyanthranilate (3-HAA), a known antioxidant and reductant. The initial two steps leading to the sequential formation of 2-hydroxy/aminobenzoate and 3-HAA are catalyzed by a NADPH-dependent 2-NBA nitroreductase (NbaA) and 2-hydroxylaminobenzoate mutase (NbaB), respectively. The 216-amino-acid protein NbaA is 78% identical to a plasmid-encoded hypothetical conserved protein of Polaromonas strain JS666; structurally, it belongs to the homodimeric NADH:flavin mononucleotide (FMN) oxidoreductase-like fold family. Structural modeling of complexes with the flavin, coenzyme, and substrate suggested specific residues contributing to the NbaA catalytic activity, assuming a ping-pong reaction mechanism. Mutational analysis supports the roles of Asn40, Asp76, and Glu113, which are predicted to form the binding site for a divalent metal ion implicated in FMN binding, and a role in NADPH binding for the 10-residue insertion in the beta5-alpha2 loop. The 181-amino-acid sequence of NbaB is 35% identical to the 4-hydroxylaminobenzoate lyases (PnbBs) of various 4-nitrobenzoate-assimilating bacteria, e.g., Pseudomonas putida strain TW3. Coexpression of nbaB with nbaA in Escherichia coli produced a small amount of 3-HAA from 2-NBA, supporting the functionality of the nbaB gene. We also showed by gene knockout and chemotaxis assays that nbaY, a chemoreceptor NahY homolog located downstream of the nbaA gene, is responsible for strain KU-7 being attracted to 2-NBA. NbaY is the first chemoreceptor in nitroaromatic metabolism to be identified, and this study completes the gene elucidation of 2-NBA metabolism that is localized within a 24-kb chromosomal locus of strain KU-7.
TI  - Characterization of the last step of the aerobic phenylacetic acid degradation pathway.
AB  - Phenylacetic acid (PA) degradation in bacteria involves an aerobic hybrid pathway encoded by the paa gene cluster. It is shown here that succinyl-CoA is one of the final products of this pathway in Pseudomonas putida and Escherichia coli. Moreover, in vivo and in vitro studies revealed that the paaE gene encodes the beta-ketoadipyl-CoA thiolase that catalyses the last step of the PA catabolic pathway, i.e. the thiolytic cleavage of beta-ketoadipyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA. Succinyl-CoA is suggested as a common final product of aerobic hybrid pathways devoted to the catabolism of aromatic compounds.
TI  - Novel detection of Escherichia coli beta-D-glucuronidase activity using a microbially-modified glassy carbon electrode and its potential for faecal pollution monitoring.
AB  - The electrochemical detection of Escherichia coli beta-D-glucuronidase activity as a means of monitoring water pollution by faecal material was investigated using separate Moraxella- and Pseudomonas putida-modified glassy carbon electrodes. The former was more sensitive and selective. The Moraxella-modified biosensor was 100 times more rapid and sensitive than the spectrophotometric detection of beta-D-glucuronidase activity. The experimental limit of detection of the biosensor was two c.f.u. per 100 ml polluted water sample within 20 min. The biosensor gave a linear response to commercial beta-D-glucuronidase concentration between 0.2 ng and 2 microg ml(-1). The biosensor detected activity of beta-D-glucuronidase from viable but non-culturable (VBNC) cells and can therefore serve as a presence or absence device for rapid water quality monitoring.
TI  - Construction of an Escherichia-Pseudomonas shuttle vector containing an aminoglycoside phosphotransferase gene and a lacZ'' Gene for alpha-complementation.
AB  - A new 4.87 kb Escherichia-Pseudomonas shuttle vector has been constructed by inserting a 1.27 kb DNA fragment with a replication origin of a Pseudomonas plasmid pRO1614 into the 3.6 kb E. coli plasmid pBGS18. This vector, designated pJH1, contains an aminoglycoside phosphotransferase gene (aph) from Tn903, a lacZ'' gene for alpha-complementation and a versatile multiple cloning site possessing unique restriction sites for EcoRI, SacI, KpnI, SmaI, BamHI, XbaI, SalI, BspMI, PstI, SphI, and HindIII. When pJH1 was transformed into E. coli DH5alpha and into P. putida HK-6, it was episomally and stably maintained in both strains. In addition, the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) gene which was transcriptionally cloned into pJH1 rendered E. coli cells fluorescence when its transformants were illuminated at 488 nm.
TI  - Signal transduction pathway of TonB-dependent transporters.
AB  - Transcription of the ferric citrate import system is regulated by ferric citrate  binding to the outer membrane transporter FecA. A signal indicating transporter occupancy is relayed across the outer membrane to energy-transducing and regulatory proteins embedded in the cytoplasmic membrane. Because transcriptional activation is not coupled to ferric citrate import, an allosteric mechanism underlies this complex signaling mechanism. Using evolution-based statistical analysis we have identified a sparse but structurally connected network of residues that links distant functional sites in FecA. Functional analyses of these positions confirm their involvement in the mechanism that regulates transcriptional activation in response to ferric citrate binding at the cell surface. This mechanism appears to be conserved and provides the structural basis for the allosteric signaling of TonB-dependent transporters.
TI  - Biochemical evidence that phaZ gene encodes a specific intracellular medium chain length polyhydroxyalkanoate depolymerase in Pseudomonas putida KT2442: characterization of a paradigmatic enzyme.
AB  - Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) can be catabolized by many microorganisms using intra- or extracellular PHA depolymerases. Most of our current knowledge of these intracellular enzyme-coding genes comes from the analysis of short chain length PHA depolymerases, whereas medium chain length PHA (mcl-PHA) intracellular depolymerization systems still remained to be characterized. The phaZ gene of some Pseudomonas putida strains has been identified only by mutagenesis and complementation techniques as putative intracellular mcl-PHA depolymerase. However, none of their corresponding encoded PhaZ enzymes have been characterized in depth. In this study the PhaZ depolymerase from P. putida KT2442 has been purified and biochemically characterized after its overexpression in Escherichia coli. To facilitate these studies we have developed a new and very sensitive radioactive method for detecting PHA hydrolysis in vitro. We have demonstrated that PhaZ is an intracellular depolymerase that is located in PHA granules and that hydrolyzes specifically mcl-PHAs containing aliphatic and aromatic monomers. The enzyme behaves as a serine hydrolase that is inhibited by phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. We have modeled the three-dimensional structure of PhaZ complexed with a 3-hydroxyoctanoate dimer. Using this model, we found that the enzyme appears to be built up from a corealpha/beta hydrolase-type domain capped with a lid structure with an active site containing a catalytic triad buried near the connection between domains. All these data constitute the first biochemical characterization of PhaZ and allow us to propose this enzyme as the paradigmatic representative of intracellular endo/exo-mcl-PHA depolymerases.
TI  - Occurrence and diversity of integrons and beta-lactamase genes among ampicillin-resistant isolates from estuarine waters.
AB  - The aim of the present study was to assess the occurrence and molecular diversity of beta-lactamase genes and integrons among Gram-negative ampicillin-resistant bacteria from Ria de Aveiro. Ampicillin-resistant isolates were selected and subjected to genotyping using REP-PCR. Representatives from each REP pattern were affiliated with the following taxa by sequencing the 16S rRNA gene: Aeromonas caviae, A. hydrophila, A. media, A. molluscorum, A. veronii, A. salmonicida, Aeromonas sp., Pseudomonas putida, Pseudomonas sp., Escherichia coli, Escherichia sp., Shigella sonnei, Shigella sp., Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Raoultella ornithinolytica, R. terrigena, R. planticola, Citrobacter freundii, Morganella morganii and Enterobacter sp. Isolates affiliated with genera Escherichia or Shigella were identified as Escherichia coli using phenotypic-based tests. PCR was used to assess beta-lactamase encoding sequences (bla(TEM), bla(SHV), bla(CARB), bla(CTX-M), bla(IMP), bla(VIM), bla(CphA/IMIS), bla(OXA-A), bla(OXA-B), bla(OXA-C)), class 1 and class 2 integrases, and integron variable regions. Sequence analysis of PCR products was performed. beta-Lactamase genes were detected in 77.8% of the Enterobacteriaceae and in 10.5% of the Aeromonas. The most frequently detected gene was bla(TEM), followed by bla(SHV,)bla(OXA-B), bla(CphA/IMIS) and bla(CARB). Retrieved sequences shared high homology with previously described beta-lactamases. The intI1 gene was present in 29.6% of the Enterobacteriaceae and in 21% of the Aeromonas isolates. The intI2 gene was present in 4 isolates. A total of 13 cassettes included in 12 different cassette arrays were identified. The most frequently found resistance gene cassettes were aadA variants. Previous investigations based on cultivation-independent approaches revealed higher molecular diversity among beta-lactamase-encoding sequences in this estuary. This fact reinforces the hypothesis that cultivation-dependent approaches may underestimate the prevalence of antibiotic resistance genes in environmental samples and may introduce bias in the recovery of their molecular variants.
TI  - Characterization of alkylphenol degradation gene cluster in Pseudomonas putida MT4 and evidence of oxidation of alkylphenols and alkylcatechols with medium-length alkyl chain.
AB  - Alkylphenols (APs) are ubiquitous contaminants in aquatic environments and have endocrine disrupting and toxic effects on aquatic organisms. To investigate biodegradation mechanisms of APs, an AP degradation gene cluster was cloned from a butylphenol (BP)-degrading bacterium, Pseudomonas putida MT4. The gene cluster consisted of 13 genes named bupBA1A2A3A4A5A6CEHIFG. From the nucleotide sequences, bupA1A2A3A4A5A6 were predicted to encode a multicomponent phenol hydroxylase (PH), whereas bupBCEHIFG were expected to encode meta-cleavage pathway enzymes. A partial sequence of a putative NtrC-type regulatory gene, bupR, was also found upstream of the gene bupB. This result indicates that APs can be initially oxidized into alkylcatechols (ACs), followed by the meta-cleavage of the aromatic rings. To confirm this pathway, AP degradation tests were carried out using the recombinant P. putida KT2440 harboring the PH genes (bupA1A2A3A4A5A6). The recombinant strain oxidized 4-n-APs with an alkyl chain of up to C7 (< or = C7) efficiently and also several BPs including those with an alkyl chain with some degree of branching. Therefore, it was found that PH had a broad substrate specificity for APs with a medium-length alkyl chain (C3-C7). Moreover, the cell extract of a recombinant Escherichia coli harboring bupB (a catechol 2,3-dioxygenase gene) converted 4-n-ACs with an alkyl chain of < or = C9 into yellow meta-cleavage products with a maximum absorbance at 379 nm, indicating that the second step enzyme in this pathway is also responsible for the degradation of ACs with a medium-length alkyl chain. These results suggest that MT4 is a very useful strain in the biodegradation of a wide range of APs with a medium-length alkyl chain, which known nonylphenol-degrading Sphingomonas strains have never degraded.
TI  - Enzymatic generation of the antimetabolite gamma,gamma-dichloroaminobutyrate by NRPS and mononuclear iron halogenase action in a streptomycete.
AB  - Four adjacent open reading frames, cytC1-C4, were cloned from a cytotrienin-producing strain of a Streptomyces sp. by using primers derived from the conserved region of a gene encoding a nonheme iron halogenase, CmaB, in coronamic acid biosynthesis. CytC1-3 were active after expression in Escherichia coli, and CytC4 was active after expression in Pseudomonas putida. CytC1, a relatively promiscuous adenylation enzyme, installs the aminoacyl moieties on the phosphopantetheinyl arm of the holo carrier protein CytC2. CytC3 is a nonheme iron halogenase that will generate both gamma-chloro- and gamma,gamma-dichloroaminobutyryl-S-CytC2 from aminobutyryl-S-CytC2. CytC4, a thioesterase, hydrolytically releases the dichloroaminobutyrate, a known streptomycete antibiotic. Thus, this short four-protein pathway is likely the biosynthetic source of this amino acid antimetabolite. This four-enzyme system analogously converts the proS-methyl group of valine to the dichloromethyl product regio- and stereospecifically.
TI  - OxyR regulated the expression of two major catalases, KatA and KatB, along with peroxiredoxin, AhpC in Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - OxyR is known to activate/repress the expression of the oxyR regulon, which consists of several genes, which play important antioxidant role in Escherichia coli. To elucidate the role of OxyR in Pseudomonas putida KT2442, the oxyR1 mutation that caused the upregulation of ahpC in a toluene-resistant variant strain was introduced, because no null mutants in oxyR were isolated. This mutation was shown to cause the accumulation of a catalase (KatA) along with AhpC throughout the growth, and of a RpoS-dependent catalase/peroxidase (KatB) in the stationary phase. Following the identification of the transcription start site of two catalase genes, sequences similar to those involved in the proposed OxyR binding for E. coli were found upstream from each of the promoter regions of katA and katB, as well as ahpC. Purified OxyR was shown to bind to these sequences, under both reduced and oxidized states. Moreover, the oxyR1 mutation increased the transcription levels of these genes. These results are consistent with the conclusion, distinct from those observed in an opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, that OxyR controlled expression of all the principal peroxide-degrading enzymes in P. putida. The mutation did not cause any notable changes in the transcriptional levels of several antioxidant genes, including those of glutathione reductase, glutaredoxins and thioredoxins, which would involve maintenance of the cellular thiol-disulfide balance, suggesting that the transcriptional regulation of these antioxidant genes should be different from that of katA, katB and ahpC in P. putida.
TI  - Effects of stress and other environmental factors on horizontal plasmid transfer  assessed by direct quantification of discrete transfer events.
AB  - Selection pressure may affect the horizontal transfer of plasmids. The inability  to distinguish between gene transfer and the growth of transconjugants complicates testing. We have developed a method that enables the quantification of discrete transfer events. It uses large numbers of replicate matings (192 or 384) in microtiter wells and the counting of transfer-positive and transfer-negative wells. We applied the method to study the transfer of the IncP1 plasmid pRO103 between Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida strains. pRO103 encodes resistance to mercury and tetracycline and partial degradation of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D). The results showed positive correlation between transfer and donor metabolic activity, and an optimal temperature for transfer of 29 degrees C. On stimulation of donor activity, the optimal temperature was decreased to 24.5 degrees C. HgCl(2) above 1.0 microg L(-1) negatively affected transfer, whereas 2,4-D up to 0.3 mM had no effect. The negative effect of mercury was shown to be a result of stressing of the recipient. No effects of mercury on transfer could be detected by traditional filter mating. Thus, the method is superior to filter mating and, as the experimental design allows the manipulation of individual parameters, it is ideal for the assessment and comparison of effects of environmental factors on plasmid transfer.
TI  - Analysis of novel soluble chromate and uranyl reductases and generation of an improved enzyme by directed evolution.
AB  - Most polluted sites contain mixed waste. This is especially true of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) waste sites which hold a complex mixture of heavy metals, radionuclides, and organic solvents. In such environments enzymes that can remediate multiple pollutants are advantageous. We report here evolution of an enzyme, ChrR6 (formerly referred to as Y6), which shows a markedly enhanced capacity for remediating two of the most serious and prevalent DOE contaminants, chromate and uranyl. ChrR6 is a soluble enzyme and reduces chromate and uranyl intracellularly. Thus, the reduced product is at least partially sequestered and nucleated, minimizing the chances of reoxidation. Only one amino acid change, (Tyr)128(Asn), was responsible for the observed improvement. We show here that ChrR6 makes Pseudomonas putida and Escherichia coli more efficient agents for bioremediation if the cellular permeability barrier to the metals is decreased.
TI  - Biocatalytic conversion of avermectin into 4''-oxo-avermectin: discovery, characterization, heterologous expression and specificity improvement of the cytochrome P450 enzyme.
AB  - 4''-Oxo-avermectin is a key intermediate in the manufacture of the insecticide emamectin benzoate from the natural product avermectin. Seventeen Streptomyces strains with the ability to oxidize avermectin to 4''-oxo-avermectin in a regioselective manner have been discovered, and the enzymes responsible for this reaction were found to be CYPs (cytochrome P450 mono-oxygenases). The genes for these enzymes have been cloned, sequenced and compared to reveal a new subfamily of CYPs. The biocatalytic enzymes have been overexpressed in Escherichia coli, Streptomyces lividans and solvent-tolerant Pseudomonas putida strains using different promoters and vectors. FDs (ferredoxins) and FREs (ferredoxin:NADP(+) reductases) were also cloned from Streptomyces coelicolor and biocatalytic Streptomyces strains, and tested in co-expression systems to optimize the electron transport. Subsequent studies showed that increasing the biocatalytic conversion levels to commercial relevance results in the production of several side products in significant amounts. Chimaeric Ema CYPs were created by sequential rounds of GeneReassembly, a proprietary directed evolution method, and selected for improved substrate specificity by high-throughput screening.
TI  - Proteins with GGDEF and EAL domains regulate Pseudomonas putida biofilm formation and dispersal.
AB  - Microbial biofilm formation often causes problems in medical and industrial settings, and knowledge about the factors that are involved in biofilm development and dispersion is useful for creating strategies to control the processes. In this report, we present evidence that proteins with GGDEF and EAL domains are involved in the regulation of biofilm formation and biofilm dispersion in Pseudomonas putida. Overexpression in P. putida of the Escherichia coli YedQ protein, which contains a GGDEF domain, resulted in increased biofilm formation. Overexpression in P. putida of the E. coli YhjH protein, which contains an EAL domain, strongly inhibited biofilm formation. Induction of YhjH expression in P. putida cells situated in established biofilms led to rapid dispersion of the biofilms. These results support the emerging theme that GGDEF-domain and EAL-domain proteins are involved in regulating the transition of bacteria between a roaming lifestyle and a sessile biofilm lifestyle.
TI  - Structure and function of the 3-carboxy-cis,cis-muconate lactonizing enzyme from  the protocatechuate degradative pathway of Agrobacterium radiobacter S2.
AB  - 3-carboxy-cis,cis-muconate lactonizing enzymes participate in the protocatechuate branch of the 3-oxoadipate pathway of various aerobic bacteria. The gene encoding a 3-carboxy-cis,cis-muconate lactonizing enzyme (pcaB1S2) was cloned from a gene cluster involved in protocatechuate degradation by Agrobacterium radiobacter strain S2. This gene encoded for a 3-carboxy-cis,cis-muconate lactonizing enzyme of 353 amino acids - significantly smaller than all previously studied 3-carboxy-cis,cis-muconate lactonizing enzymes. This enzyme, ArCMLE1, was produced in Escherichia coli and shown to convert not only 3-carboxy-cis,cis-muconate but also 3-sulfomuconate. ArCMLE1 was purified as a His-tagged enzyme variant, and the basic catalytic constants for the conversion of 3-carboxy-cis,cis-muconate and 3-sulfomuconate were determined. In contrast, Agrobacterium tumefaciens 3-carboxy-cis,cis-muconate lactonizing enzyme 1 could not, despite 87% sequence identity to ArCMLE1, use 3-sulfomuconate as substrate. The crystal structure of ArCMLE1 was determined at 2.2 A resolution. Consistent with the sequence, it showed that the C-terminal domain, present in all other members of the fumarase II family, is missing in ArCMLE1. Nonetheless, both the tertiary and quaternary structures, and the structure of the active site, are similar to those of Pseudomonas putida 3-carboxy-cis,cis-muconate lactonizing enzyme. One principal difference is that ArCMLE1 contains an Arg, as opposed to a Trp, in the active site. This indicates that activation of the carboxylic nucleophile by a hydrophobic environment is not required for lactonization, unlike earlier proposals [Yang J, Wang Y, Woolridge EM, Arora V, Petsko GA, Kozarich JW & Ringe D (2004) Biochemistry43, 10424-10434]. We identified citrate and isocitrate as noncompetitive inhibitors of ArCMLE1, and found a potential binding pocket for them on the enzyme outside the active site.
TI  - Role of eukaryotic microbiota in soil survival and catabolic performance of the 2,4-D herbicide degrading bacteria Cupriavidus necator JMP134.
AB  - Cupriavidus necator (formerly Ralstonia eutropha) JMP134, harbouring the catabolic plasmid pJP4, is the best-studied 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) herbicide degrading bacterium. A study of the survival and catabolic performance of strain JMP134 in agricultural soil microcosms exposed to high levels of 2,4-D was carried out. When C. necator JMP134 was introduced into soil microcosms, the rate of 2,4-D removal increased only slightly. This correlated with the poor survival of the strain, as judged by 16S rRNA gene terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) profiles, and the semi-quantitative detection of the pJP4-borne tfdA gene sequence, encoding the first step in 2,4-D degradation. After 3 days of incubation in irradiated soil microcosms, the survival of strain JMP134 dramatically improved and the herbicide was completely removed. The introduction of strain JMP134 into native soil microcosms did not produce detectable changes in the structure of the bacterial community, as judged by 16S rRNA gene T-RFLP profiles, but provoked a transient increase of signals putatively corresponding to protozoa, as indicated by 18S rRNA gene T-RFLP profiling. Accordingly, a ciliate able to feed on C. necator JMP134 could be isolated after soil enrichment. In native soil microcosms, C. necator JMP134 survived better than Escherichia coli DH5alpha (pJP4) and similarly to Pseudomonas putida KT2442 (pJP4), indicating that species specific factors control the survival of strains harbouring pJP4. The addition of cycloheximide to soil microcosms strongly improved survival of these three strains, indicating that the eukaryotic microbiota has a strong negative effect in bioaugmentation with catabolic bacteria.
TI  - Microbial transformation of benzene to cis-3,5-cyclohexadien-1,2-diols by recombinant bacteria harboring toluene dioxygenase gene tod.
AB  - Toluene dioxygenase (TDO) catalyzes asymmetric cis-dihydroxylation of aromatic compounds. To achieve high efficient biotransformation of benzene to benzene cis-diols, Pseudomonas putida KT2442, Pseudomonas stutzeri 1317, and Aeromonas hydrophila 4AK4 were used as hosts to express TDO gene tod. Plasmid pSPM01, a derivative of broad-host plasmid pBBR1MCS-2 harboring tod from plasmid pKST11, was constructed and introduced into the above three strains. Their abilities to catalyze the biotransformation of benzene to benzene cis-diols, namely, cis-3,5-cyclohexadien-1,2-diols abbreviated as DHCD, were examined. In shake-flask cultivation under optimized culture media and growth condition, benzene cis-diols production by recombinant P. putida KT2442 (pSPM01), P. stutzeri 1317 (pSPM01), and A. hydrophila 4AK4 (pSPM01) were 2.68, 2.13, and 1.17 g/l, respectively. In comparison, Escherichia coli JM109 (pSPM01) and E. coli JM109 (pKST11) produced 0.45 and 0.53 g/l of DHCD, respectively. When biotransformation was run in a 6-l fermenter, DHCD production in P. putida KT2442 (pSPM01) was approximately 60 g/l; this is the highest DHCD production yield reported so far.
TI  - Biofilm formation and cellulose expression among diverse environmental Pseudomonas isolates.
AB  - The ability to form biofilms is seen as an increasingly important colonization strategy among both pathogenic and environmental bacteria. A survey of 185 plant-associated, phytopathogenic, soil and river Pseudomonas isolates resulted in 76% producing biofilms at the air-liquid (A-L) interface after selection in static microcosms. Considerable variation in biofilm phenotype was observed, including waxy aggregations, viscous and floccular masses, and physically cohesive biofilms with continuously varying strengths over 1500-fold. Calcofluor epifluorescent microscopy identified cellulose as the matrix component in biofilms produced by Pseudomonas asplenii, Pseudomonas corrugata, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Pseudomonas marginalis, Pseudomonas putida, Pseudomonas savastanoi and Pseudomonas syringae isolates. Cellulose expression and biofilm formation could be induced by the constitutively active WspR19 mutant of the cyclic-di-GMP-associated, GGDEF domain-containing response regulator involved in the P. fluorescens SBW25 wrinkly spreader phenotype and cellular aggregation in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA01. WspR19 could also induce P. putida KT2440, which otherwise did not produce a biofilm or express cellulose, as well as Escherichia coli K12 and Salmonella typhimurium LT2, both of which express cellulose yet lack WspR homologues. Statistical analysis of biofilm parameters suggest that biofilm development is a more complex process than that simply described by the production of attachment and matrix components and bacterial growth. This complexity was also seen in multivariate analysis as a species-ecological habitat effect, underscoring the fact that in vitro biofilms are abstractions of those surface and volume colonization processes used by bacteria in their natural environments.
TI  - Identification of novel benzoylformate decarboxylases by growth selection.
AB  - A growth selection system was established using Pseudomonas putida, which can grow on benzaldehyde as the sole carbon source. These bacteria presumably metabolize benzaldehyde via the beta-ketoadipate pathway and were unable to grow in benzoylformate-containing selective medium, but the growth deficiency could be restored by expression in trans of genes encoding benzoylformate decarboxylases. The selection system was used to identify three novel benzoylformate decarboxylases, two of them originating from a chromosomal library of P. putida ATCC 12633 and the third from an environmental-DNA library. The novel P. putida enzymes BfdB and BfdC exhibited 83% homology to the benzoylformate decarboxylase from P. aeruginosa and 63% to the enzyme MdlC from P. putida ATCC 12633, whereas the metagenomic BfdM exhibited 72% homology to a putative benzoylformate decarboxylase from Polaromonas naphthalenivorans. BfdC was overexpressed in Escherichia coli, and the enzymatic activity was determined to be 22 U/ml using benzoylformate as the substrate. Our results clearly demonstrate that P. putida KT2440 is an appropriate selection host strain suitable to identify novel benzoylformate decarboxylase-encoding genes. In principle, this system is also applicable to identify a broad range of different industrially important enzymes, such as benzaldehyde lyases, benzoylformate decarboxylases, and hydroxynitrile lyases, which all catalyze the formation of benzaldehyde.
TI  - TOL plasmid transfer during bacterial conjugation in vitro and rhizoremediation of oil compounds in vivo.
AB  - Molecular profiling methods for horizontal transfer of aromatics-degrading plasmids were developed and applied during rhizoremediation in vivo and conjugations in vitro. pWW0 was conjugated from Pseudomonas to Rhizobium. The xylE gene was detected both in Rhizobium galegae bv. officinalis and bv. orientalis, but it was neither stably maintained in orientalis nor functional in officinalis. TOL plasmids were a major group of catabolic plasmids among the bacterial strains isolated from the oil-contaminated rhizosphere of Galega orientalis. A new finding was that some Pseudomonas migulae and Pseudomonas oryzihabitans strains harbored a TOL plasmid with both pWW0- and pDK1-type xylE gene. P. oryzihabitans 29 had received the archetypal TOL plasmid pWW0 from Pseudomonas putida PaW85. As an application for environmental biotechnology, the biodegradation potential of oil-polluted soil and the success of bioremediation could be estimated by monitoring changes not only in the type and amount but also in transfer of degradation plasmids.
TI  - Kinetics of 1,4-dioxane biodegradation by monooxygenase-expressing bacteria.
AB  - 1,4-Dioxane is a probable human carcinogen, and an important emerging water contaminant. In this study, the biodegradation of dioxane by 20 bacterial isolates was evaluated, and 13 were found to be capable of transforming dioxane. Dioxane served as a growth substrate for Pseudonocardia dioxanivorans CB1190 and Pseudonocardia benzenivorans B5, with yields of 0.09 g protein g dioxane(-1) and 0.03 g protein g dioxane(-1), respectively. Cometabolic transformation of dioxane was observed for monooxygenase-expressing strains that were induced with methane, propane, tetrahydrofuran, or toluene including Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b, Mycobacterium vaccae JOB5, Pseudonocardia K1, Pseudomonas mendocina KR1, Ralstonia pickettii PKO1, Burkholderia cepacia G4, and Rhodococcus RR1. Product toxicity resulted in incomplete dioxane degradation for many of the cometabolic reactions. Brief exposure to acetylene, a known monooxygenase inhibitor, prevented oxidation of dioxane in all cases, supporting the hypothesis that monooxygenase enzymes participated in the transformation of dioxane by these strains. Further, Escherichia coli TG1/pBS(Kan) containing recombinant plasmids derived from the toluene-2- and toluene-4-monooxygenases of G4, KR1 and PKO1 were also capable of cometabolic dioxane transformation. Dioxane oxidation rates measured at 50 mg/L ranged from 0.01 to 0.19 mg hr(-1) mg protein(-1) for the metabolic processes, 0.1-0.38 mg hr(-1) mg protein(-1) for cometabolism by the monooxygenase-induced strains, and 0.17-0.60 mg hr(-1) mg protein(-1) for the recombinant strains. Dioxane was not degraded by M. trichosporium OB3b expressing particulate methane monooxygenase, Pseudomonas putida mt-2 expressing a toluene side-chain monooxygenase, and PseudomonasJS150 and Pseudomonas putida F1 expressing toluene-2,3-dioxygenases. This is the first study to definitively show the role of monooxygenases in dioxane degradation using several independent lines of evidence and to describe the kinetics of metabolic and cometabolic dioxane degradation.
TI  - System for determining the relative fitness of multiple bacterial populations without using selective markers.
AB  - A device for simultaneously measuring the relative fitness of multiple bacterial  populations was developed and evaluated. The new device eliminates the need to construct strains with selectively neutral markers so that strains can be readily distinguished, and it provides a means to perform multispecies competition experiments.
TI  - Enzymatic synthesis of L-pipecolic acid by Delta1-piperideine-2-carboxylate reductase from Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - L-Pipecolic acid is a chiral pharmaceutical intermediate. An enzymatic system for the synthesis of L-pipecolic acid from L-lysine by commercial L-lysine alpha-oxidase from Trichoderma viride and an extract of recombinant Escherichia coli cells coexpressing Delta1-piperideine-2-carboxylate reductase from Pseudomonas putida and glucose dehydrogenase from Bacillus subtilis is described. A laboratory-scale process provided 27 g/l of L-pipecolic acid in 99.7% e.e.
TI  - Increasing the catalytic performance of a whole cell biocatalyst harboring a cytochrome p450cam system by stabilization of an electron transfer component.
AB  - Catalytic activity of a recombinant Escherichia coli whole cell biocatalyst harboring a cytochrome P450cam monooxygenase system from Pseudomonas putida coupled with enzymatic co-factor regeneration was investigated. About 0.7 micromol camphor was hydroxylated per mg dry cells at 4 degrees C in 50 mM Tris/HCl buffer (pH 7.4) when utilizing a stable putidaredoxin (Pdx) mutant, C73S/C85S-Pdx (Cys73Ser, Cys85Ser double mutant), instead of wild-type Pdx, which was about two-fold improvement in the substrate conversion. Ten-micromole camphor was completely hydroxylated at 20 degrees C in 6 h by 15 mg dry cell weight of whole cell biocatalyst including C73S/C85S-Pdx. Thus, modulation of protein-protein interaction in multicomponent enzymatic catalysis in whole cells is important.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of an alcohol dehydrogenase gene from the octylphenol polyethoxylate degrader Pseudomonas putida S-5.
AB  - Octylphenol polyethoxylate (OPEO(n)) biodegradation by Pseudomonas putida S-5 under aerobic conditions is initiated by the oxidation of its terminal alcohol group by alcohol dehydrogenase. A DNA fragment, containing an alcohol dehydrogenase gene (adh1), was isolated using a combination of degenerate PCR and inverse PCR. The predicted translation product of adh1 showed significant sequence similarity to bacterial alcohol dehydrogenases. Furthermore, a flavin-binding motif and signature patterns conserved in type III FAD-dependent alcohol oxidases were detected. Two open reading frames (ORFs) were found upstream of adh1, encoding a putative acyl-CoA synthetase and a putative esterase. Downstream of adh1 and located on the opposite strand was an ORF encoding a putative aldehyde dehydrogenase. Transcription analysis using RT-PCR showed that adh1 is cotranscribed with the putative acyl-CoA synthetase and esterase genes during growth on OPEO(n). ADH1 overproduced in Escherichia coli exhibited activity not only toward various alcohols, including OPEO(n)s, but also toward primary aliphatic and aromatic aldehydes.
TI  - Characterization of a HMT2-like enzyme for sulfide oxidation from Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - The open reading frame pp0053, which has a high homology with the sequence of mitochondrial sulfide dehydrogenase (HMT2) conferring cadmium tolerance in fission yeast, was amplified from Pseudomonas putida KT2440 and expressed in Escherichia coli JM109(DE3). The isolated and purified PP0053-His showed absorption spectra typical of a flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)--binding protein. The PP0053-His catalyzed a transfer of sulfide-sulfur to the thiophilic acceptor, cyanide, which decreased the Km value of the enzyme for sulfide oxidation and elevated the sulfide-dependent quinone reduction. Reaction of the enzyme with cyanide elicited a dose-dependent formation of a charge transfer band, and the FAD-cyanide adduct was supposed to work for a sulfur transfer. The pp0053 deletion from P. putida KT2440 led to activity declines of the intracellular catalase and ubiquinone-H2 oxidase. The sulfide-quinone oxidoreductase activity in P. putida KT2440 was attributable to the presence of pp0053, and the activity showed a close relevance to enzymatic activities related to sulfur assimilation.
TI  - Molecular basis of substrate recognition in D-3-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase from Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - D-3-Hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase from Pseudomonas putida (EC 1.1.1.30) belongs to the family of short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases (SDRs). It catalyzes the reversible and stereospecific oxidation of D-3-hydroxybutyrate (D-3-HB) to acetoacetate with the aid of NAD(+) as coenzyme. This study contributes to understanding the mechanism and the high specificity of this enzyme towards its negatively charged and hydrophilic substrate. Sequence comparison of 44 bacterial HBDHs shows the residues Gln91, His141, Lys149, Lys192, and Gln193 to be strictly conserved. Site-directed mutagenesis of these amino acids to alanine and subsequent kinetic characterization of the mutated enzymes provides insight into the importance of these residues for substrate recognition and catalysis. Docking studies and molecular-dynamics simulations based on a three-dimensional structure model of a complex between P. putida HBDH and its coenzyme obtained by comparative molecular modeling were performed and provided deeper insight into the binding of the ligands at the molecular level. They show the residues Gln91, His141, Gln193, and, in particular, Lys149 to be involved in a hydrogen-bonding network with the carboxylate group of the substrate.
TI  - Characterization of the AlkS/P(alkB)-expression system as an efficient tool for the production of recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli fed-batch fermentations.
AB  - The availability of suitable, well-characterized, and robust expression systems remains an essential requirement for successful metabolic engineering and recombinant protein production. We investigated the suitability of the Pseudomonas putida GPo1-derived AlkS/P(alkB) expression system in strictly aqueous cultures. By applying the apolar inducer dicyclopropylketone (DCPK) to express green fluorescent protein (GFP) from this system in Escherichia coli and analyzing the resulting cultures on single-cell level by flow cytometry, we found that this expression system gives rise to a homogeneous population of cells, even though the overall system is expected to have a positive feed-back element in the expression of the regulatory gene alkS. Overexpressing E. coli's serine hydroxymethyltransferase gene glyA, we showed that the system was already fully turned on at inducer concentrations as low as 0.005% (v/v). This allows efficient mass production of recombinant enzymes even though DCPK concentrations decreased from 0.05% to 0.01% over the course of a fully aerated cultivation in aqueous medium. Therefore, we elaborated the optimum induction procedure for production of the biocatalytically promising serine hydroxymethyltransferase and found volumetric and specific productivity to increase with specific growth rate in glucose-limited fed-batch cultures. Acetate excretion as a result of recombinant protein production could be avoided in an optimized fermentation protocol by switching earlier to a linear feed. This protocol resulted in a production of a final cell dry weight (CDW) concentration of 52 g/L, producing recombinant GlyA with a maximum specific activity of 6.3 U/mg total protein.
TI  - IncP-9 replication initiator protein binds to multiple DNA sequences in oriV and  recruits host DnaA protein.
AB  - The minimal replicon from IncP-9 plasmid pM3, consisting of oriV and rep, is able to replicate in Pseudomonas putida but not in Escherichia coli, unless production of Rep protein is increased. The Rep protein, at 20kDa, is the smallest replication protein so far identified for a theta replicating plasmid. Rep was purified and shown to bind in three blocks across the oriV region that do not correlate with a single unique binding sequence. The block closest to rep is not necessary for oriV function. Rep forms at least two types of complex--one rendering the DNA entirely resistant to cleavage, the other occupying one side of the helix. No short segment of oriV showed the same affinity for Rep as the whole of oriV. The oriV region did not bind purified DnaA from E. coli, P. putida or P. aeruginosa but when Rep was present also, super-shifts were found with DnaA in a sequence-specific manner. Scrambling of the primary candidate DnaA box did not inactivate oriV but did increase the level of Rep required to activate oriV. The general pattern of Rep-DNA recognition sequences in oriV indicates that the IncP-9 system falls outside of the paradigms of model plasmids that have been well-studied to date.
TI  - Biotransformation of substituted pyridines with dioxygenase-containing microorganisms.
AB  - A series of 2-, 3- and 4-substituted pyridines was metabolised using the mutant soil bacterium Pseudomonas putida UV4 which contains a toluene dioxygenase (TDO) enzyme. The regioselectivity of the biotransformation in each case was determined by the position of the substituent. 4-Alkylpyridines were hydroxylated exclusively on the ring to give the corresponding 4-substituted 3-hydroxypyridines, while 3-alkylpyridines were hydroxylated stereoselectively on C-1 of the alkyl group with no evidence of ring hydroxylation. 2-Alkylpyridines gave both ring and side-chain hydroxylation products. Choro- and bromo-substituted pyridines, and pyridine itself, while being poor substrates for P. putida UV4, were converted to some extent to the corresponding 3-hydroxypyridines. These unoptimised biotransformations are rare examples of the direct enzyme-catalysed oxidation of pyridine rings and provide a novel synthetic method for the preparation of substituted pyridinols. Evidence for the involvement of the same TDO enzyme in both ring and side-chain hydroxylation pathways was obtained using a recombinant strain of Escherichia coli (pKST11) containing a cloned gene for TDO. The observed stereoselectivity of the side-chain hydroxylation process in P. putida UV4 was complicated by the action of an alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme in the organism which slowly leads to epimerisation of the initial (R)-alcohol bioproducts by dehydrogenation to the corresponding ketones followed by stereoselective reduction to the (S)-alcohols.
TI  - Cloning and expression of the gene for periplasmic poly(vinyl alcohol) dehydrogenase from Sphingomonas sp. strain 113P3, a novel-type quinohaemoprotein alcohol dehydrogenase.
AB  - A gene for periplasmic poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) dehydrogenase (PVADH) was cloned, based on the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified PVADH from Sphingomonas sp. 113P3 and the sequence of the gene for PVADH (pvaA, GenBank accession no. AB190288). The recombinant PVADH tagged with hexahistidine was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity. The recombinant enzyme had the same characteristics as the purified enzyme from Sphingomonas sp. strain 113P. In addition to PVA, the recombinant PVADH could oxidize glycols such as polypropylene glycols and 1,3-butane/cyclohexanediol and 2,4-pentanediol, but neither primary nor secondary alcohols. The amino acid sequence of the recombinant PVADH showed similarity with those of PVADH from Pseudomonas sp. strain VM15C, putative PVADHs from Azoarcus sp. EbN1, and Xanthomonas species (54-25 % identity), and the quinohaemoprotein alcohol dehydrogenases (QH-ADHs) from Comamonas testosteroni, Ralstonia eutropha and Pseudomonas putida (25-29 % identity). PVADHs from strains 113P3 and VM15C have a conserved superbarrel domain (SD), probable PQQ-binding amino acids in the SD and a haem-binding domain (HBD) (they should be designated QH-PVADHs), but the positions of the amino acid sequences for the HBD and SD are the reverse of those of QH-ADHs. A protein structure of QH-PVADHs is proposed. Results of dot-blot hybridization and RT-PCR indicated that the three genes encoding oxidized PVA hydrolase, PVADH and cytochrome c are expressed constitutively and form an operon.
TI  - Necrotrophic growth of Legionella pneumophila.
AB  - This study examined whether Legionella pneumophila is able to thrive on heat-killed microbial cells (necrotrophy) present in biofilms or heat-treated water systems. Quantification by means of plate counting, real-time PCR, and flow cytometry demonstrated necrotrophic growth of L. pneumophila in water after 96 h, when at least 100 dead cells are available to one L. pneumophila cell. Compared to the starting concentration of L. pneumophila, the maximum observed necrotrophic growth was 1.89 log units for real-time PCR and 1.49 log units for plate counting. The average growth was 1.57 +/- 0.32 log units (n = 5) for real-time PCR and 1.14 +/- 0.35 log units (n = 5) for plate counting. Viability staining and flow cytometry showed that the fraction of living cells in the L. pneumophila population rose from the initial 54% to 82% after 96 h. Growth was measured on heat-killed Pseudomonas putida, Escherichia coli, Acanthamoeba castellanii, Saccharomyces boulardii, and a biofilm sample. Gram-positive organisms did not result in significant growth of L. pneumophila, probably due to their robust cell wall structure. Although necrotrophy showed lower growth yields compared to replication within protozoan hosts, these findings indicate that it may be of major importance in the environmental persistence of L. pneumophila. Techniques aimed at the elimination of protozoa or biofilm from water systems will not necessarily result in a subsequent removal of L. pneumophila unless the formation of dead microbial cells is minimized.
TI  - Oxidative stress by biphenyl metabolites induces inhibition of bacterial cell separation.
AB  - Cell-cell separation of a polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)-degrading bacterium Comamonas testosteroni TK102 was monitored by flow cytometry. When monohydroxy metabolites of biphenyl (BP) (2-hydroxybiphenyl and 3-hydroxybiphenyl) were added to the culture, cell-cell separation of strain TK102 was inhibited at stationary phase. This inhibition was reproduced on non-PCB degrading bacteria such as Pseudomonas putida PpY101 and Escherichia coli MV1184, but was not observed on Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1. An opportunistic pathogen, P. aeruginosa PAO1, produces exopolysaccharide, which is known to scavenge damaging chemicals such as reactive oxygen species (ROS). The higher level of ROS and lipid peroxidants were detected in the cells treated by monohydroxybiphenyls. Fat-soluble vitamin E, which is a lipid radical scavenger, maintained bacterial cell separation during monohydroxybiphenyls treatment. Our results demonstrated that intracellular oxidative stress played an important role in the inhibition of bacterial cell separation during BP metabolism. This study shows that metabolites of environmental pollutants, such as monohydroxylated BP, inhibit bacterial cell separation by oxidative stress.
TI  - Genomic and functional analysis of the IncP-9 naphthalene-catabolic plasmid NAH7  and its transposon Tn4655 suggests catabolic gene spread by a tyrosine recombinase.
AB  - The naphthalene-catabolic (nah) genes on the incompatibility group P-9 (IncP-9) self-transmissible plasmid NAH7 from Pseudomonas putida G7 are some of the most extensively characterized genetic determinants for bacterial aerobic catabolism of aromatic hydrocarbons. In contrast to the detailed studies of its catabolic cascade and enzymatic functions, the biological characteristics of plasmid NAH7 have remained unclear. Our sequence determination in this study together with the previously deposited sequences revealed the entire structure of NAH7 (82,232 bp). Comparison of NAH7 with two other completely sequenced IncP-9 catabolic plasmids, pDTG1 and pWW0, revealed that the three plasmids share very high nucleotide similarities in a 39-kb region encoding the basic plasmid functions (the IncP-9 backbone). The backbone of NAH7 is phylogenetically more related to that of pDTG1 than that of pWW0. These three plasmids carry their catabolic gene clusters at different positions on the IncP-9 backbone. All of the NAH7-specified nah genes are located on a class II transposon, Tn4655. Our analysis of the Tn4655-encoded site-specific recombination system revealed that (i) a novel tyrosine recombinase, TnpI, catalyzed both the intra- and intermolecular recombination between two copies of the attI site, (ii) the functional attI site was located within a 119-bp segment, and (iii) the site-specific strand exchange occurred within a 30-bp segment in the 41-bp CORE site. Our results and the sequence data of other naphthalene-catabolic plasmids, pDTG1 and pND6-1, suggest a potential role of the TnpI-attI recombination system in the establishment of these catabolic plasmids.
TI  - In vivo drafting of single-chain antibodies for regulatory duty on the sigma54-promoter Pu of the TOL plasmid.
AB  - The identification of single-chain antibodies (scFvs) that interfere in vivo with the building of the complex that activate the prokaryotic, sigma54-dependent promoter Pu of the catabolic TOL plasmid pWW0 is reported. To this end, a phage M13 library of scFvs was raised against the cognate prokaryotic enhancer-binding activator, XylR. The scFv pool was then expressed intracellularly in a reporter Pu-lacZ strain of Escherichia coli designed to permit formation of intramolecular disulphide bonds in cytoplasmic proteins. This strain allowed the assembly of functional scFvs and the direct testing of their activity on the Pu promoter in vivo. Specifically, genetic screening for lacZ-minus colonies yielded a number of scFvs able to downregulate transcriptional output in live cells. Two antibody clones were purified and shown to inhibit the activity of the same promoter in vitro as well. These scFvs targeted the DNA-binding domain of XylR and its ATP binding site respectively. This work provides a proof of principle that mimetic regulatory factors can be derived from an antibody repertoire that specifically interact with given transcriptional activators. As assembly of initiation complexes is stimulated or inhibited by regulatory proteins we argue that anti-XylR scFvs operate as bona fide transcriptional inhibitors of the Pu promoter.
TI  - Characterization of genes involved in the initial reactions of 4-chloronitrobenzene degradation in Pseudomonas putida ZWL73.
AB  - The genes encoding enzymes involved in the initial reactions during degradation of 4-chloronitrobenzene (4CNB) were characterized from the 4CNB utilizer Pseudomonas putida ZWL73, in which a partial reductive pathway was adopted. A DNA fragment containing genes coding for chloronitrobenzene nitroreductase (CnbA) and hydroxylaminobenzene mutase (CnbB) were PCR-amplified and subsequently sequenced. These two genes were actively expressed in Escherichia coli, and recombinant E. coli cells catalyzed the conversion of 4CNB to 2-amino-5-chlorophenol, which is the ring-cleavage substrate in the degradation of 4CNB. Phylogenetic analyses on sequences of chloronitrobenzene nitroreductase and hydroxylaminobenzene mutase revealed that these two enzymes are closely related to the functionally identified nitrobenzene nitroreductase and hydroxylaminobenzene mutase from Pseudomonas strains JS45 and HS12. The nitroreductase from strain ZWL73 showed a higher specific activity toward 4CNB than nitrobenzene (approximately at a ratio of 1.6:1 for the recombinant or 2:1 for the wild type), which is in contrast to the case where the nitroreductase from nitrobenzene utilizers Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes JS45 with an apparently lower specific activity against 4CNB than nitrobenzene (0.16:1) [Kadiyala et al. Appl Environ Microbiol 69:6520-6526, 2003]. This suggests that the nitroreductase from 4-chloronitrobenzene utilizer P. putida ZWL73 may have evolved to prefer chloronitrobenzene to nitrobenzene as its substrate.
TI  - One-step high-throughput assay for quantitative detection of beta-galactosidase activity in intact gram-negative bacteria, yeast, and mammalian cells.
AB  
TI  - [Cloning, sequence analysis and expression of alanine racemase gene in Pseudomonas putida].
AB  - Two distinct alanine racemase genes from Pseudomonas putida 200 were cloned and sequenced. DadX encodes a peptide of 357 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 38.82kDa. The putative product of alr gene is a peptide of 409 amino acids with molecular weight of 44.182kDa. A homology comparison revealed identities of 96.64%, 71.99%, 44.88% and 47.37% of the DadX alanine racemase to those from P. putida KT2440, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli, respectively. The amino acids sequence deduced from alr gene showed the homologies of 94.38%, 22.89%, 25.72% and 26.44% to those from the microorganisms above, respectively. Two motifs believed essential to the enzyme activity are found both in DadX and Alr, such as pyridoxal-5'-phosphate binding site. Both dadX and alr were expressed in E. coli TG1. Neither alanine racemase activity or serine racemase activity was detected in the host strain. Only alanine racemase activity was found in E. coli TG1/pCTD. But both E. coli TG1/pCTA and TG1/pCBA exhibit activity toward L-alanine and L-serine. Transcription of alr gene in E. coli is independent from extraneous promoter, a result confirmed by the significant enzyme activity observed in the E. coli TG1/pCBA, which indicates the presence of a possible promoter upstream the structure gene.
TI  - Zinc sorption to three gram-negative bacteria: combined titration, modeling, and  EXAFS study.
AB  - The acid-base and Zn sorption properties of three bacteria, Cupriavidus metallidurans CH34, Pseudomonas putida ATCC12633, and Escherichia coli K12DH5alpha, were investigated through an original combination of extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy and equilibrium titration studies. Acid-base titration curves of the three strains were fitted with a model accounting for three conceptual reactive sites: an acidic (carboxyl and/or phosphodiester), a neutral (phosphomonoester), and a basic (amine and/or hydroxyl) group. Calculated proton and Zn equilibrium constants and site densities compare with literature data. The nature of Zn binding sites was studied by EXAFS spectroscopy. Phosphoester, carboxyl, and unexpectedly sulfhydryl ligands were identified. Their proportions depended on Zn loading and bacterial strain and were consistent with the titration results. These findings were compared to the structure and site density of the major cell wall components. It appeared that the cumulated theoretical site density of these structures (<2 Zn nm(-2)) was much lower than the total site density of the investigated strains (16-56 Zn nm(-2)). These results suggest a dominant role of extracellular polymeric substances in Zn retention processes, although Zn binding to inner cell components cannot be excluded.
TI  - Expression, crystallization and preliminary diffraction studies of the Pseudomonas putida cytochrome P450cam operon repressor CamR.
AB  - The Pseudomonas putida cam repressor (CamR) is a homodimeric protein that binds to the camO DNA operator to inhibit the transcription of the cytochrome P450cam operon camDCAB. CamR has two functional domains: a regulatory domain and a DNA-binding domain. The binding of the inducer D-camphor to the regulatory domain renders the DNA-binding domain unable to bind camO. Native CamR and its selenomethionyl derivative have been overproduced in Escherichia coli and purified. Native CamR was crystallized under the following conditions: (i) 12-14% PEG 4000, 50 mM Na PIPES, 0.1 M KCl, 1% glycerol pH 7.3 at 288 K with and without camphor and (ii) 1.6 M P(i), 50 mM Na PIPES, 2 mM camphor pH 6.7 at 278 K. The selenomethionyl derivative CamR did not crystallize under either of these conditions, but did crystallize using 12.5% PEG MME 550, 25 mM Na PIPES, 2.5 mM MgCl2 pH 7.3 at 298 K. Preliminary X-ray diffraction studies revealed the space group to be orthorhombic (P2(1)2(1)2), with unit-cell parameters a = 48.0, b = 73.3, c = 105.7 A. Native and selenomethionyl derivative data sets were collected to 3 A resolution at SPring-8 and the Photon Factory.
TI  - The upstream-activating sequences of the sigma54 promoter Pu of Pseudomonas putida filter transcription readthrough from upstream genes.
AB  - Although the m-xylene-responsive sigma54 promoter Pu of Pseudomonas putida mt-2,  borne by the TOL plasmid pWWO, is one of the strongest known promoters in vivo, its base-line level in the absence of its aromatic inducer is below the limit of any detection procedure. This is unusual because regulatory networks (such as the one to which Pu belongs) can hardly escape the noise caused by intrinsic fluctuations in background transcription, including that transmitted from upstream promoters. This study provides genetic evidence that the upstream-activating sequences (UAS), which serve as the binding sites for the pWW0-encoded XylR protein (the m-xylene-responsive sigma54-dependent activator of Pu), isolate expression of the upper TOL genes from any adventitious transcriptional flow originating further upstream. An in vivo test system was developed in which different segments of the Pu promoter were examined for the inhibition of incoming transcription products from an upstream promoter in P. putida and Escherichia coli. Minimal transcription filter ability was located within a 105-bp fragment encompassing the UAS of Pu. Although S1 nuclease assays showed that the UAS prevented the buildup of downstream transcripts, the mechanism seems to diverge from a typical termination system. This was shown by the fact that the UAS did not halt transcription in vitro and that the filter effect could not be relieved by the anti-termination system of lambda phage. Because the Pu promoter lies adjacent to the edge of a transposon in pWW0, the preset transcriptional filter in the UAS may isolate the upper TOL operon from undue expression after random insertion of the mobile genetic element in a new replicon.
TI  - A quantitative assay for linking microbial community function and structure of a  naphthalene-degrading microbial consortium.
AB  - A comprehensive culture-independent assay, called Q-FAST, was developed for concurrent identification and quantification of active microorganisms involved a specific function in a given microbial community. The development of Q-FAST was achieved by integrating the concept of stable isotope probing technique into a new quantitative fingerprinting assay called real-time-t-RFLP for microbial community structure analysis. The Q-FAST was successfully validated by using a three-member artificial microbial community containing a known naphthalene-utilizing bacterium (Pseudomonas putida G7) and two nonnaphthalene-degrading bacteria (Escherichia coli and Bacillus thuringiensis). The application of Q-FAST to identify and quantify a guild of naphthalene-utilizing microorganisms in soils revealed the involvement of eight members, with six members relating to several phylogenetic groups of eubacteria (three in beta-proteobacteria, two in gamma-proteobacteria, and one in genera Intrasporangium of Gram-positive bacteria) and two members showing no close phylogenetic affiliation to any known bacterial sequences deposited in GenBank. The quantity of three members belonging to beta-proteobacteria accounted for 34% of total 16S rDNA copies measured from the "heavier" fraction of DNA that was contributed from the DNA of microorganisms capable of incorporating 13C-labeled naphthalene into their genetic biomarkers. The other five members composed 66% of total 16S rDNA copies of active naphthalene-utilizing populations measured. Offering a powerful tool for studying microbial ecology, Q-FAST thus opens a new avenue for deeper exploration of microbial-mediated processes, mainly the quantitative relationship between microbial diversity and microbial activity in a given environment.
TI  - Reconstitution of the enzyme AroA and its glyphosate tolerance by fragment complementation.
AB  - 5-Enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate (EPSP) synthase (AroA) is a key enzyme in the  aromatic amino acid biosynthetic pathway in microorganisms and plants, and is the target of the herbicide glyphosate. Glyphosate tolerance activity of the enzyme could be obtained by natural occurrence or by site-directed mutagenesis. A functional Pseudomonas putida AroA was obtained by co-expression of two protein fragments AroA(P. putida)-N210 and AroA(P. putida)-C212 in Escherichia coli aroA mutant strain AB2829. From sequence analysis, the equivalent split site on E. coli AroA was chosen for further study. The result indicated that functional E. coli AroA could also be reconstituted from two protein fragments AroA(E. coli)-N218 and AroA(E. coli)-C219, under both in vivo and in vitro conditions. This result suggested that the fragment complementation property of this family of enzyme may be general. Additional experiments indicated that the glyphosate tolerance property of AroA could also be reconstituted in parallel with its enzyme activity. The implication of this finding is discussed.
TI  - Metabolic engineering of the E. coli L-phenylalanine pathway for the production of D-phenylglycine (D-Phg).
AB  - D-phenylglycine (D-Phg) is an important side chain building block for semi-synthetic penicillins and cephalosporins such as ampicillin and cephalexin. To produce d-Phg ultimately from glucose, metabolic engineering was applied. Starting from phenylpyruvate, which is the direct precursor of L-phenylalanine, an artificial D-Phg biosynthesis pathway was created. This three-step route is composed of the enzymes hydroxymandelate synthase (HmaS), hydroxymandelate oxidase (Hmo), and the stereoinverting hydroxyphenylglycine aminotransferase (HpgAT). Together they catalyse the conversion of phenylpyruvate via mandelate and phenylglyoxylate to D-Phg. The corresponding genes were obtained from Amycolatopsis orientalis, Streptomyces coelicolor, and Pseudomonas putida. Combined expression of these activities in E. coli strains optimized for the production of L-phenylalanine resulted in the first completely fermentative production of D-Phg.
TI  - Cloning and functional characterization of the styE gene, involved in styrene transport in Pseudomonas putida CA-3.
AB  - A 1.5-kb region immediately downstream of the styABCD operon involved in styrene  degradation in Pseudomonas putida CA-3 has been cloned. Sequence analysis revealed a 1,296-bp open reading frame, designated styE, and BLAST P database comparisons of the deduced StyE amino acid sequence revealed 33 to 98% identity with several membrane-associated ATPase-dependent kinase proteins involved in the active transport of aromatic hydrocarbons across bacterial membranes and also with FadL, an outer membrane protein necessary for the uptake of long-chain fatty acids in Escherichia coli. Transcription of styE is styrene dependent, and the gene is cotranscribed with the styABCD structural genes. StyE appears to be membrane associated, with a corresponding 45.9-kDa band being identified following sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of membrane preparations from styrene-grown cells. P. putida CA-3 cells in which the styE gene had been interrupted were no longer capable of growth on styrene. In contrast, overexpression of styE in P. putida CA-3 resulted in a 4.2-fold increase in styrene monooxygenase activity compared with wild-type cells grown on styrene, with a concomitant 8-fold increase in styA mRNA transcript levels. Experiments with the classic, ATPase inhibitor vanadate revealed that growth of wild-type cells on styrene was inhibited at a concentration of 1 mM, while 1.75 mM was required to achieve a similar effect in the StyE overexpression strain. Growth of either strain on citrate was not inhibited in the presence of up to 7 mM vanadate. These findings suggest a role for StyE in the active transport of styrene in Pseudomonas putida CA-3 and identify styrene transport as a potentially limiting factor with respect to mRNA transcript levels and associated enzymatic activity of the styrene degradative pathway.
TI  - Selection of biocatalysts for chemical synthesis.
AB  - To determine whether microbial chemosensors can be used to find new or better biocatalysts, we constructed Escherichia coli hosts that recognize the product of a biocatalytic conversion through the transcriptional activator NahR and respond by expression of a lacZ or tetA reporter gene. Equipped with a benzaldehyde dehydrogenase (XylC from Pseudomonas putida), the lacZ-based host responded to the oxidation of benzaldehyde and 2-hydroxybenzaldehyde to the corresponding benzoic acids by forming blue colonies, whereas XylC- cells did not. Similarly, the tetA-based host was able to grow under selective conditions only when equipped with XylC, enabling selection of biocatalytically active cells in inactive populations at frequencies as low as 10(-6).
TI  - A recombinant Escherichia coli whole cell biocatalyst harboring a cytochrome P450cam monooxygenase system coupled with enzymatic cofactor regeneration.
AB  - A cytochrome P450cam monooxygenase (P450cam) system from the soil bacterium Pseudomonas putida requires electron transfer among three different proteins and a cofactor, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH), for oxygenation of its natural substrate, camphor. Herein, we report a facile way to significantly enhance the catalytic efficiency of the P450cam system by the coupling of its native electron transfer system with enzymatic NADH regeneration catalyzed by glycerol dehydrogenase (GLD) in Escherichia coli whole cell biocatalysts. Recombinant E. coli harboring the P450cam system, but lacking GLD, exhibited little activity for camphor hydroxylation. In contrast, coexpression of GLD with the proteinaceous electron transfer components of P450cam resulted in about tenfold improvement in the substrate conversion, implying that the whole cell biocatalyst utilized molecular oxygen, endogenous NADH, and glycerol in the cell for catalysis. The addition of glycerol to the reaction media further promoted camphor hydroxylation, suggesting that exogenous glycerol is also available for GLD in the host cell and actively participates in the catalytic cycle. These results clearly show the utility of GLD towards functional reconstruction of the native P450cam system. The present approach may also be useful for E. coli whole cell biocatalysts with the other NADH-dependent oxygenases and oxidoreductases.
TI  - Evolutionary algorithms and flow cytometry to examine the parameters influencing  transconjugant formation.
AB  - An evolutionary algorithm was used to determine the optimal combination of parameters for transconjugant formation. As a model system, a gfp tagged TOL plasmid pWW0 was chosen to examine transfer from Pseudomonas putida to Escherichia coli. A comparison of flow cytometry results with plating and microscopy showed that the majority of transconjugants were not culturable. The transconjugant ratio therefore was determined by flow cytometry. The evolutionary algorithm showed that the optimal conditions were obtained at 28 degrees C and at the highest nutrient concentrations. This work demonstrates that evolutionary algorithms can be used to find optimal parameter interactions in environmental microbiology.
TI  - Regulation of superoxide stress in Pseudomonas putida KT2440 is different from the SoxR paradigm in Escherichia coli.
AB  - In Escherichia coli, the SoxR regulon orchestrates genes for defense against certain types of oxidative stress through the SoxR-regulated synthesis of the SoxS transcription activator. The Pseudomonas putida genome did not reveal a clear soxS homolog. The P. putida SoxR protein appears to be functional: its expression in an E. coli DeltasoxR strain restored the paraquat inducibility of soxS. Of nine candidate P. putida oxidative stress genes, which are known to be SoxR regulon in E. coli, tested for response to superoxide or nitric oxide, fumC-1, sodA, zwf-1, and particularly fpr, encoding ferredoxin:NADP(+) reductase, were induced, all independent of P. putida soxR. Disruption of the fpr and finR, a regulatory protein that is required for paraquat-dependent expression of the fpr, resulted in more oxidative stress sensitivity. However, a P. putida soxR-deletion strain had normal resistance to the superoxide-generating agent paraquat. The data presented here show that the genetic responses to superoxide stress in P. putida differ markedly from those seen in E. coli and Salmonella, and the role of P. putida soxR remains to be established.
TI  - Biofilm formation by Escherichia coli is stimulated by synergistic interactions and co-adhesion mechanisms with adherence-proficient bacteria.
AB  - Laboratory strains of Escherichia coli do not show significant ability to attach  to solid surfaces and to form biofilms. We compared the adhesion properties of the E. coli PHL565 laboratory strain to eight environmental E. coli isolates: only four isolates displayed adhesion properties to glass significantly higher than PHL565. The ability of the adhesion-proficient isolates to attach to glass tubes strongly correlated with their ability to express curli (thin aggregative fimbriae), thus suggesting that curli are a common adhesion determinant in environmental strains. Despite its inability to attach to solid surfaces, growth of E. coli PHL565 in mixed cultures with Pseudomonas putida MT2 resulted in co-adhesion and in formation of a mixed E. coli/P. putida biofilm, which was able to colonize glass surfaces with dramatic efficiency compared to P. putida alone. E. coli/P. putida interactions stimulate initial adhesion to glass, and the presence of both bacterial species in the mature biofilm was confirmed by quantitative PCR. In contrast, no synergistic biofilm formation was observed in mixed cultures of E. coli with the Gram-positive bacterium Staphylococcus epidermidis. Interestingly, E. coli PHL565 also stimulated biofilm formation by bacterial communities isolated from drinking water distribution systems. Our results strongly suggest that co-adhesion and synergistic interaction with biofilm-forming species might represent an important mechanism, and a possible alternative strategy to production of adhesion determinants, for persistence and propagation of E. coli in the environment.
TI  - Cell surface display of lipase in Pseudomonas putida KT2442 using OprF as an anchoring motif and its biocatalytic applications.
AB  - We developed a new cell surface display system in Pseudomonas putida KT2442 using OprF, an outer membrane protein of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, as an anchoring motif in a C-terminal deletion-fusion strategy. The Pseudomonas fluorescens SIK W1 lipase gene was fused to two different C-terminal truncated OprF genes, and the fusion genes were cloned into the broad-host-range plasmid pBBR1MCS2 to make pMO164PL and pMO188PL. Plasmid pMO188PL allowed better display of lipase and thus was chosen for further study. The display of lipase on the surface of P. putida KT2442 was confirmed by Western blot analysis, immunofluorescence microscopy, and measurement of whole-cell lipase activity. The whole-cell lipase activity of recombinant P. putida KT2442 harboring pMO188PL was more than fivefold higher than that of recombinant Escherichia coli displaying lipase in the same manner. Cell surface-displayed lipase exhibited the highest activity at 47 degrees C and pH 9.0, and the whole-cell lipase activity was greater than 90% of the initial activity in organic solvents at 47 degrees C for 1 week. In a biocatalytic application, enantioselective resolution of 1-phenyl ethanol was carried out in an organic solvent. (R)-Phenyl ethyl acetate was successfully produced with 41.9% conversion and an enantiomeric excess of more than 99% in a 36-h reaction. These results suggest that the OprF anchor can be used for efficient display of proteins in P. putida KT2442 and consequently for various biocatalytic applications.
TI  - Class 1 integrons and tetracycline resistance genes in alcaligenes, arthrobacter, and Pseudomonas spp. isolated from pigsties and manured soil.
AB  - The presence of tetracycline resistance (Tc(r)) genes and class I integrons (in-1), and their ability to cotransfer were investigated in Tc(r) gram-negative (185 strains) and gram-positive (72 strains) bacteria from Danish farmland and pigsties. The isolates belonged to the groups or species Escherichia coli, Enterobacter spp., Arthrobacter spp., Alcaligenes spp., Pseudomonas spp., and Corynebacterium glutamicum. The 257 isolates were screened for in-1. Eighty-one of the gram-negative isolates were also screened for the Tc(r) genes tet(A), tet(B), and tet(C), and all (n = 72) gram-positive isolates were screened for tet(33). Fourteen (7%) of the soil isolates and eleven (25%) of the pigsty isolates contained in-1. All isolates that contained tet genes also contained in-1, except one gram-negative isolate from a pigsty that contained tet(B). All gram-positive isolates with in-1 also contained tet(33). No isolates contained more than one tet gene. The in-1-positive isolates were tested for resistance to selected antimicrobial agents and showed resistance to three to nine drugs. Filter-mating experiments showed cotransfer of Tc(r) and class I integrons from soil isolates to Escherichia coli and/or Pseudomonas putida. We conclude that soil bacteria in close contact to manure or pigsty environment may thus have an important role in horizontal spread of resistance. Use of tetracyclines in food animal production may increase not only Tc(r) but also multidrug resistance (caused by the presence tet genes and in-1) in bacteria.
TI  - Efficient production of 2-pyrone 4,6-dicarboxylic acid as a novel polymer-based material from protocatechuate by microbial function.
AB  - Sphingomonas paucimobilis SYK-6, which can degrade various low molecular weight compounds derived from plant polyphenols such as lignin, lignan, and tannin, metabolizes these substances via 2-pyrone-4,6-dicarboxylic acid (PDC). We focused on this metabolic intermediate as a potential raw material for novel, bio-based polymers. We cloned the ligAB and ligC genes of SYK-6, which respectively encode protocatechuate 4,5-dioxygenase and 4-carboxy-2-hydroxymuconate-6-semialdehyde dehydrogenase, into a broad host range plasmid vector, pKT230MC. The resulting plasmid, pDVABC, was introduced into the PpY1100 strain of Pseudomonas putida, and we found that PDC could be stably produced from protocatechuate and accumulated. In addition, we examined the efficiency of production of PDC from protocatechuate on a 5-L scale in a Luria-Bertani medium containing 100 mM glucose and determined that PDC was stably produced from protocatechuate to yield 10 g/L or more.
TI  - Stereoselective esterase from Pseudomonas putida IFO12996 reveals alpha/beta hydrolase folds for D-beta-acetylthioisobutyric acid synthesis.
AB  - Esterase (EST) from Pseudomonas putida IFO12996 catalyzes the stereoselective hydrolysis of methyl dl-beta-acetylthioisobutyrate (dl-MATI) to produce d-beta-acetylthioisobutyric acid (DAT), serving as a key intermediate for the synthesis of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. The EST gene was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli; the recombinant protein is a non-disulfide-linked homotrimer with a monomer molecular weight of 33,000 in both solution and crystalline states, indicating that these ESTs function as trimers. EST hydrolyzed dl-MATI to produce DAT with a degree of conversion of 49.5% and an enantiomeric excess value of 97.2% at an optimum pH of about 8 to 10 and an optimum temperature of about 57 to 67 degrees C. The crystal structure of EST has been determined by X-ray diffraction to a resolution of 1.6 A, confirming that EST is a member of the alpha/beta hydrolase fold superfamily of enzymes and includes a catalytic triad of Ser97, Asp227, and His256. The active site is located approximately in the middle of the molecule at the end of a pocket approximately 12 A deep. EST can hydrolyze the methyl ester group without affecting the acetylthiol ester moiety in dl-MATI. The examination of substrate specificity of EST toward other linear esters revealed that the enzyme showed specific activity toward methyl esters and that it recognized the configuration at C-2.
TI  - Reconstitution of beta-carotene hydroxylase activity of thermostable CYP175A1 monooxygenase.
AB  - CYP175A1 is a thermostable P450 Monooxygenase from Thermus thermophilus HB27, demonstrating in vivo activity towards beta-carotene. Activity of CYP175A1 was reconstituted in vitro using artificial electron transport proteins. First results were obtained in the mixture with a crude Escherichia coli cell extract at 37 degrees C. In this system, beta-carotene was hydroxylated to beta-cryptoxanthin. The result indicated the presence of electron transport enzymes among the E. coli proteins, which are suitable for CYP175A1. However, upon in vitro reconstitution of CYP175A1 activity with purified recombinant flavodoxin and flavodoxin reductase from E. coli, only very low beta-cryptoxanthin production was observed. Remarkably, with another artificial electron transport system, putidaredoxin and putidaredoxin reductase from Pseudomonas putida, purified CYP175A1 enzyme hydroxylated beta-carotene at 3- and also 3'-positions, resulting in beta-cryptoxanthin and zeaxanthin. Under the optimal reaction conditions, the turnover rate of the enzyme reached 0.23 nmol beta-cryptoxanthin produced per nmol P450 per min.
TI  - Vitellogenin is a novel player in defense reactions.
AB  - The significance of the presence of vitellogenin (Vg), a female-specific protein, in male and juvenile fish is uncertain. Here we show that the Vg purified from the rosy barb Puntius conchonius possesses both antibacterial and hemagglutinating activities in vitro, and the male fish challenged with Escherichia coli synthesize Vg. These suggest that in addition to being involved in yolk protein formation, Vg is also involved in defense reactions, a novel function assigned to Vg.
TI  - Quenched autoligation probes allow discrimination of live bacterial species by single nucleotide differences in rRNA.
AB  - Quenched autoligation (QUAL) probes are a class of self-reacting nucleic acid probes that give strong fluorescence signal in the presence of fully complementary RNAs and selectivity against single nucleotide differences in solution. Here, we describe experiments designed to test whether QUAL probes can discriminate between bacterial species by the detection of small differences in their 16S rRNA sequences. Probes were introduced into live cells using small amounts of detergent, thus eliminating the need for fixation, and fluorescence signal was monitored both by microscopy and by flow cytometry without any washing steps. The effects of probe length, modified backbone, probe concentration and growth state of the bacteria were investigated. The data demonstrate specific fluorescence discrimination between three closely related bacteria, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica and Pseudomonas putida, based on single nucleotide differences in their 16S rRNA. Discrimination was possible with cells in mid-log phase or in lag phase. These results suggest that QUAL probes may be useful for rapid identification of microorganisms in laboratory and clinical settings.
TI  - Survival curves for microbial species stored by freeze-drying.
AB  - The survival of a variety of species of microorganism following storage for up to 20 years has been analyzed. The organisms were freeze-dried, sealed in ampoules under vacuum (<1 Pa) and stored in the dark at 5 degrees C. The yeast that was tested, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, showed only 8% survival when recovered shortly after freeze-drying, but subsequent loss during storage was the least among all the tested microorganisms. The decrease in the logarithm of survival per year (log survival) was -0.010, which corresponds to a survival rate of 97.7% per year. The Gram-negative bacteria tested, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas putida, and Enterobacter cloacae, showed 42.6, 33.5, and 50.8% survival shortly after freeze-drying, which was higher than the corresponding survival of S. cerevisiae, but the subsequent loss during storage was greater than S. cerevisiae, the log survival figures being -0.041, -0.058, and -0.073 per year. These values correspond to survival rates of 91.0, 87.5, and 84.5% each year. The Gram-positive bacteria tested, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Enteroccoccus faecium, showed 62.5 and 85.2% survival shortly after freeze-drying, which was even higher than that of the Gram-negative species, and these organisms also showed better survival during storage than Gram-negative bacteria; their log survival rates were -0.018 and -0.016 per year, which corresponded to survival rates of almost 96% per year. Comparison of these results with other published data for different drying conditions suggests that survival during storage is strongly influenced by the degree of vacuum under which the ampoules were sealed. The excellent survival after freeze-drying of each species might be attributable to the high level of desiccation and to sealing under vacuum.
TI  - Suitability of recombinant Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida strains for selective biotransformation of m-nitrotoluene by xylene monooxygenase.
AB  - Escherichia coli JM101(pSPZ3), containing xylene monooxygenase (XMO) from Pseudomonas putida mt-2, catalyzes specific oxidations and reductions of m-nitrotoluene and derivatives thereof. In addition to reactions catalyzed by XMO, we focused on biotransformations by native enzymes of the E. coli host and their effect on overall biocatalyst performance. While m-nitrotoluene was consecutively oxygenated to m-nitrobenzyl alcohol, m-nitrobenzaldehyde, and m-nitrobenzoic acid by XMO, the oxidation was counteracted by an alcohol dehydrogenase(s) from the E. coli host, which reduced m-nitrobenzaldehyde to m-nitrobenzyl alcohol. Furthermore, the enzymatic background of the host reduced the nitro groups of the reactants resulting in the formation of aromatic amines, which were shown to effectively inhibit XMO in a reversible fashion. Host-intrinsic oxidoreductases and their reaction products had a major effect on the activity of XMO during biocatalysis of m-nitrotoluene. P. putida DOT-T1E and P. putida PpS81 were compared to E. coli JM101 as alternative hosts for XMO. These promising strains contained an additional dehydrogenase that oxidized m-nitrobenzaldehyde to the corresponding acid but catalyzed the formation of XMO-inhibiting aromatic amines at a significantly lower level than E. coli JM101.
TI  - Influence of growth phase on bacterial cell electrokinetic characteristics examined by soft particle electrophoresis theory.
AB  - The influence of incubation time on the electrokinetic properties of Escherichia  coli, Pseudomonas putida, Alcaligenes faecalis, and Alcaligenes sp., was examined by electrophoretic mobility measurements and the results were discussed based on Ohshima's soft particle theory. The electrophoretic mobility of E. coli plotted against incubation time revealed that the mobility gradually increased from the outset of incubation to 7 h, which corresponded to the exponential growth and early stationary phase, and then decreased. For all strains, electrophoretic mobility leveled off to nonzero values in accordance with the increase in ionic concentration, which was a characteristic feature of soft particles. Soft particle analysis was carried out at the outset of incubation and the time when mobility reached a maximum in order to obtain the spatial charge density (ZN) and cell surface softness (1/lambda). ZN at the maximum electrophoretic mobility was more negative than that at the outset of incubation for E. coli, P. putida, and A. faecalis, while the ZN of Alcaligenes sp. almost remained unchanged. 1/lambda decreased for E. coli, but increased for Alcaligenes sp. and A. faecalis. These findings indicated that the cell growth phase affects both ZN and 1/lambda, although the dependencies of these parameters are unique to each bacterial strain.
TI  - Microbial surface thermodynamics and interactions in aqueous media.
AB  - Microbial surface thermodynamics and interactions in aqueous media were investigated for seven typical rod-shaped bacterial strains of Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonadaceas, and Bacillaceae, which included Escherichia coli HB101, Escherichia coli JM109, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Pseudomonas putida, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas sp., and Bacillus subtilis. All the microorganisms studied exhibited a monopolar and predominant hydrophilic surface and a negative Delta G132tot, total free energy of interactions between microbes (1) and silica gel or Canadian River Alluvium (CRA) (2) immersed in water (3) at the equilibrium distance, which accounted for their attachment on the medium surface. The microbial attachment was proportional to the corresponding Delta G132tot values. Among the microorganisms studied, B. subtilis had the most attachment on both silica gel and CRA because it had the smallest Delta G132tot values (-17.14kT for silica gel and -21.84kT for CRA). The origins of Lifshitz-van der Waals, Lewis acid/base, and electrostatic interactions were discussed and related to experimental observations.
TI  - Functional coupling between vanillate-O-demethylase and formaldehyde detoxification pathway.
AB  - Pseudomonas putida vanillate-O-demethylase consisting of VanA and VanB was expressed in Escherichia coli strain K-12. Recombinant E. coli strain K-12 cells expressing VanAB efficiently converted vanillate into protocatechuate with glucose consumption. Mutant lacking either pgi or zwf showed higher or lower converting activity than the parental strain, respectively. Formaldehyde, which is the by-product of the demethylation, was converted into formate in the cellular reaction. Formate accumulation was blocked by gene disruption of the E. coli frmA that coded glutathione-dependent formaldehyde dehydrogenase.
TI  - Metabolic engineering study on the direct fermentation of 2-keto-L-gulonic acid,  a key intermediate of L-ascorbic acid in Pseudomonas putida IFO3738.
AB  - We have achieved production of 2-keto-L-gulonic acid (2-KLGA) in recombinant Pseudomonas putida IFO3738. Firstly, the genes for sorbose dehydrogenase (SDH)/sorbosone dehydrogenase (SNDH) were introduced into P. putida. The recombinant P. putida/pBBR-SDH produced 0.7 mg/ml of 2-KLGA in a culture broth containing 5% L-sorbose. Replacement of the native SNDH promoter by the Escherichia coli tufB promoter (pBBR-SDH-tufB) improved the productivity of 2-KLGA up to 11.4 mg/ml. Secondly, the sorbitol dehydrogenase (SLDH) gene was also introduced into P. putida. The recombinant P. putida/pUCP19-3DH carrying the genes for SDH, SNDH and SLDH had the ability to produce 2-KLGA (7.5 mg/ml) in a 5% d-sorbitol broth. The productivity of 2-KLGA was improved up to 9.8 mg/ml by changing to an expression system with two plasmids, pBBR-SDH-tufB (for SDH/SNDH) and pUCP19-SLDH (for SLDH), respectively. Moreover, the replacement of the native SLDH promoter by the E. coli tufB promoter (pUCP19-SLDH-tufB) improved the 2-KLGA productivity up to 11.6 mg/ml. Optimization of cultivation conditions increased the conversion yield of 2-KLGA to 32% and that of l-idonate, a metabolite of 2-KLGA, to 40%. These results indicate P. putida IFO3738 is one of the candidate strains for direct fermentation of 2-KLGA.
TI  - Construction of recombinants Pseudomonas putida BO14 and Escherichia coli QEFCA8  for ferulic acid biotransformation to vanillin.
AB  - Recombinants Pseudomonas putida BO14 and Escherichia coli QEFCA8 capable of ferulic acid biotransformation to vanillin were constructed using homologous recombination and a PCR based cloning strategy, respectively. In the liquid culture of P. putida BO14, 26.81+/-2.30 microg vanillin ml(-1) of culture filtrate was detected. In the case of recombinant E. coli QEFCA8, 19.37+/-1.95 microg vanillin ml(-1) of culture filtrate was detected. Results indicate that the strains could be useful for the biotechnological production of vanillin, a very important flavoring substance.
TI  - RNA polymerase holoenzymes can share a single transcription start site for the Pm promoter. Critical nucleotides in the -7 to -18 region are needed to select between RNA polymerase with sigma38 or sigma32.
AB  - The Pm promoter of the benzoate meta-cleavage pathway is transcribed with E sigma32 or E sigma38 according to the growth phase, with an identical transcriptional start site. To investigate sequence determinants in the interaction between either of the two RNA polymerases and Pm, all possible single mutants between positions -7 and -18 were generated, and the activity in the exponential and stationary phases of the resulting mutant promoters was compared. The results precisely delimited a -10 element between positions -7 and -12 (TAGGCT), which defined a promoter sharing nucleotides with both sigma38 and sigma32 consensus. The first two and the last positions of this hexamer were crucial for recognition by both polymerases. Position -10 was the only one specifically recognized by E sigma38, whereas positions -8, -9, and the C-track between positions -14 and -17 were important for specific E sigma32 recognition. Western blots showed that sigma32 was only detectable in the exponential phase, and sigma38 appeared in the early stationary phase. In the rpoH mutant KY1429, sigma38 was already present in the exponential growth phase both free and bound to the RNA polymerase core, in good correlation with the transcription levels found. Pm seems to be optimized for recognition by sigma32 as an initial response to the addition of effector to the medium and allows binding of the adaptable sigma38-dependent RNA polymerase in the stationary phase. XylS is always required for Pm transcription. Therefore, the mechanism that controls Pm expression involves specific nucleotide sequences, the abundance of free and core-bound sigma32 and sigma38 factors during growth, and the presence of the regulator activated by an effector.
TI  - Production of poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyhexanoate) from gluconate and glucose by recombinant Aeromonas hydrophila and Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - Aeromonas hydrophila 4AK4 and Pseudomonas putida GPp104 were genetically engineered to synthesize poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyhexanoate) (PHBHHx) using gluconate and glucose rather than fatty acids. A truncated tesA gene, encoding cytosolic thioesterase I of Escherichia coli which catalyzes the conversion of acyl-ACP into free fatty acids, was introduced into A. hydrophila 4AK4. When grown in gluconate, the recombinant A. hydrophila 4AK4 synthesized 10% (w/w) PHBHHx containing 14% (mol/mol) 3-hydroxyhexanoate. If additional PHBHHx synthesis genes, phaPCJ, were over-expressed with the truncated tesA in A. hydrophila 4AK4, the PHBHHx content increased to 15% (w/w) and contained 19% (mol/mol) 3-hydroxyhexanoate. Recombinant P. putida GPp104 harboring phaC encoding PHBHHx synthase of A. hydrophila, phaB encoding acetoacetyl-CoA reductase of Wautersia eutropha and phaG encoding 3-hydroxyacyl-ACP-CoA transferase of P. putida, synthesized 19% (w/w) PHBHHx containing 5% (mol/mol) 3-hydroxyhexanoate from glucose. The results suggest that the engineered pathways were applicable to synthesize PHBHHx from unrelated carbon sources such as gluconate and glucose.
TI  - Chromosome-encoded gene cluster for the metabolic pathway that converts aniline to TCA-cycle intermediates in Delftia tsuruhatensis AD9.
AB  - Delftia tsuruhatensis AD9 was isolated as an aniline-degrading bacterium from the soil surrounding a textile dyeing plant. The gene cluster involved in aniline degradation was cloned from the total DNA of strain AD9 into Escherichia coli JM109. After shotgun cloning, two recombinant E. coli strains showing aniline oxidation activity or catechol meta-cleavage activity were obtained by simple plate assays. These strains contained 9.3 kb and 15.4 kb DNA fragments, respectively. Sequence analysis of the total 24.7 kb region revealed that this region contains a gene cluster (consisting of at least 17 genes, named tadQTA1A2BRD1C1D2C2EFGIJKL) responsible for the complete metabolism of aniline to TCA-cycle intermediates. In the gene cluster, the first five genes (tadQTA1A2B) and the subsequent gene (tadR) were predicted to encode a multi-component aniline dioxygenase and a LysR-type regulator, respectively, while the others (tadD1C1D2C2EFGIJKL) were expected to encode meta-cleavage pathway enzymes for catechol degradation. In addition, it was found that the gene cluster is surrounded by two IS1071 sequences, indicating that it has a class I transposon-like structure. PFGE and Southern hybridization analyses confirmed that the tad gene cluster is encoded on the chromosome of strain AD9 in a single copy. These results suggest that, in strain AD9, aniline is degraded via catechol through a meta-cleavage pathway by the chromosome-encoded tad gene cluster. The tad gene cluster showed significant similarity in nucleotide sequence and genetic organization to the plasmid-encoded aniline degradation gene cluster of Pseudomonas putida UCC22.
TI  - Functional expression system for cytochrome P450 genes using the reductase domain of self-sufficient P450RhF from Rhodococcus sp. NCIMB 9784.
AB  - Cytochrome P450RhF from Rhodococcus sp. NCIMB 9784 is a self-sufficient P450 monooxygenase. We report here a simple system for the functional expression of various P450 genes using the reductase domain of this P450RhF, which comprises flavin mononucleotide- and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate binding motifs and a [2Fe2S] ferredoxin-like center. Vector pRED was constructed, which carried the T7 promoter, cloning sites for a P450, a linker sequence, and the P450RhF reductase domain, in this order. The known P450 genes, encoding P450cam from Pseudomonas putida (CYP101A) and P450bzo from an environmental metagenome library (CYP203A), were expressed on vector pRED as soluble fusion enzymes with their natural spectral features in Escherichia coli. These E. coli cells expressing the P450cam and P450bzo genes could convert (+)-camphor and 4-hydroxybenzoate into 5-exo-hydroxycamphor and protocatechuate (3,4-dihydroxybenzoate), respectively (the expected products). Using this system, we also succeeded in directly identifying the function of P450 CYP153A as alkane 1-monooxygenase for the first time, i.e., E. coli cells expressing a P450 CYP153A gene named P450balk, which was isolated form Alcanivorax borkumensis SK2, converted octane into 1-octanol with high efficiency (800 mg/l). The system presented here may be applicable to the functional identification of a wide variety of bacterial cytochromes P450.
TI  - Antibacterial effect of bulbophyllum neilgherrense wt. (Orchidaceae). An in vitro study.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of Bulbophyllum neilgherrense was tested against five  species of bacteria, viz., Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus pumilus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas putida Aqueous, ethanolic and chloroform soluble extracts of leaf and pseudobulb (5.50 w/v) were screened for their antibacterial potential. The zone of inhibition was seen to be largest when alcoholic extract was used.
TI  - Bacterial species specificity in proU osmoinducibility and nptII and lacZ expression.
AB  - Reporter gene-based transcriptional fusions are increasingly being used to address questions in microbial ecology, with constitutively expressed fusions enabling microbe tracking and inducible fusions reporting the presence of environmental signals. To more readily apply this technology to a variety of bacterial species, we examined species specificity in the expression of three promoters of interest. A comparison of two potentially constitutive promoters, each fused to the reporter gene gfp, showed that the nptII promoter (P(nptII)) was expressed in a broader range of species (100% of 11 tested) than the lacZ promoter (P(lacZ)) (75% of 11 tested), and thus has broader applicability for marking bacteria than P(lacZ). For the species that expressed P(lacZ), however,P(lacZ) was expressed 3-fold more than P(nptII), on average. The Escherichia coli proU promoter, which is induced by low water potential in E. coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Pantoea agglomerans, and Pseudomonas syringae, was shown to be similarly responsive to water potential in strains of Clavibacter michiganensis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Pseudomonas putida, and Sinorhizobium meliloti, as well as mildly osmoresponsive in Agrobacterium tumefaciens, supporting its broad use as a reporter of water potential. Surprisingly, this promoter was not regulated by water potential in strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Erwinia amylovora, illustrating heretofore unrecognized species specificity in proU inducibility, as well as potential limitations in the species that can serve as bioreporters of water potential.
TI  - Transmembrane transcriptional control (surface signalling) of the Escherichia coli Fec type.
AB  - The ferric citrate transport system of Escherichia coli is the first example of a transcription initiation mechanism that starts at the cell surface. The inducer, ferric citrate, binds to an outer membrane transport protein, and without further transport elicits a signal that is transmitted across the outer membrane, the periplasm, and the cytoplasmic membrane into the cytoplasm. Signal transfer across the three subcellular compartments is mediated by the outer membrane transport protein that interacts in the periplasm with a cytoplasmic transmembrane protein. The latter is required for activation of a sigma factor which belongs to the extracytoplasmic function sigma factor family. A similar kind of transcription regulation has been demonstrated in Pseudomonas putida, P. aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Aerobacter aerogenes, Bordetella pertussis, B. bronchseptica, B. avium, and Ralstonia solanacearum. The genomes of P. putida, P. aeruginosa, Nitrosomonas europaea, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and Caulobacter crescentus predict the existence of many more such transcriptional regulatory devices.
TI  - Crystal structure of nitrogen regulatory protein IIANtr from Neisseria meningitidis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The NMB0736 gene of Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B strain MC58 encodes the putative nitrogen regulatory protein, IIANtr (abbreviated to NM-IIANtr). The homologous protein present in Escherichia coli is implicated in the control of nitrogen assimilation. As part of a structural proteomics approach to the study of pathogenic Neisseria spp., we have selected this protein for structure determination by X-ray crystallography. RESULTS: The NM-IIANtr was over-expressed in E. coli and was shown to be partially mono-phosphorylated, as assessed by mass spectrometry of the purified protein. Crystals of un-phosphorylated protein were obtained and diffraction data collected to 2.5 A resolution. The structure of NM-IIANtr was solved by molecular replacement using the coordinates of the E. coli nitrogen regulatory protein IIAntr [PDB: 1A6J] as the starting model. The overall fold of the Neisseria enzyme shows a high degree of similarity to the IIANtr from E. coli, and the position of the phosphoryl acceptor histidine residue (H67) is conserved. The orientation of an adjacent arginine residue (R69) suggests that it may also be involved in coordinating the phosphate group. Comparison of the structure with that of E. coli IIAmtl complexed with HPr [PDB: 1J6T] indicates that NM-IIANtr binds in a similar way to the HPr-like enzyme in Neisseria. CONCLUSION: The structure of NM-IIANtr confirms its assignment as a homologue of the IIANtr proteins found in a range of other Gram-negative bacteria. We conclude that the NM- IIANtr protein functions as part of a phosphorylation cascade which, in contrast to E. coli, shares the upstream phosphotransfer protein with the sugar uptake phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS), but in common with E. coli has a distinct downstream effector mechanism.
TI  - Novel AroA with high tolerance to glyphosate, encoded by a gene of Pseudomonas putida 4G-1 isolated from an extremely polluted environment in China.
AB  - Glyphosate has been used globally as a safe herbicide for weed control. It inhibits 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate (EPSP) synthase (AroA), which is a key enzyme in the aromatic amino acid biosynthetic pathway in microorganisms and plants. A Pseudomonas putida strain, 4G-1, was isolated from a soil heavily contaminated by glyphosate in China. Its AroA-encoding gene (aroA) has been cloned, sequenced, and expressed in Escherichia coli. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that this AroA belongs neither to class I nor to class II AroA enzymes. When compared with E. coli AroA, 4G-1 AroA shows similar values for K(m)[PEP], K(m)[S3P], and specific enzyme activity. Moreover, 4G-1 AroA exhibits high tolerance to glyphosate, which indicates a protein with a high potential for structural and functional studies of AroA in general and its potential usage for the generation of transgenic crops resistant to the herbicide.
TI  - Characterization of an inducible phenylserine aldolase from Pseudomonas putida 24-1.
AB  - An inducible phenylserine aldolase (L-threo-3-phenylserine benzaldehyde-lyase, EC 4.1.2.26), which catalyzes the cleavage of L-3-phenylserine to yield benzaldehyde and glycine, was purified to homogeneity from a crude extract of Pseudomonas putida 24-1 isolated from soil. The enzyme was a hexamer with the apparent subunit molecular mass of 38 kDa and contained 0.7 mol of pyridoxal 5' phosphate per mol of the subunit. The enzyme exhibited absorption maxima at 280 and 420 nm. The maximal activity was obtained at about pH 8.5. The enzyme acted on L-threo-3-phenylserine (Km, 1.3 mM), l-erythro-3-phenylserine (Km, 4.6 mM), l-threonine (Km, 29 mM), and L-allo-threonine (Km, 22 mM). In the reverse reaction, threo- and erythro- forms of L-3-phenylserine were produced from benzaldehyde and glycine. The optimum pH for the reverse reaction was 7.5. The structural gene coding for the phenylserine aldolase from Pseudomonas putida 24-1 was cloned and overexpressed in Escherichia coli cells. The nucleotide sequence of the phenylserine aldolase gene encoded a peptide containing 357 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 37.4 kDa. The recombinant enzyme was purified and characterized. Site-directed mutagenesis experiments showed that replacement of K213 with Q resulted in a loss of the enzyme activity, with a disappearance of the absorption maximum at 420 nm. Thus, K213 of the enzyme probably functions as an essential catalytic residue, forming a Schiff base with pyridoxal 5'-phosphate.
TI  - An artificial electron donor supported catalytic cycle of Pseudomonas putida cytochrome P450cam.
AB  - Putidaredoxin (PdX), the physiological effector of cytochrome P450cam (P450cam),  serves to gate electron transfer into oxy-P450cam during the catalytic cycle of the enzyme. Redox-linked structural changes in PdX are necessary for the effective P450cam turnover reaction. PdX is believed to be difficult to be replaced by an artificial electron donor in the reaction pathway of P450cam. We demonstrate that the catalytic cycle of wild-type P450cam can be supported in the presence of an artificial reductant, potassium ferrocyanide. Upon rapid mixing of ferrocyanide ion with P450cam, we observed an intermediate with spectral features characteristic of compound I. The rate constant for the formation of compound I in the presence of ferrocyanide supported reaction cycle was found to be comparable to the ones observed for H2O2 supported compound I formation in wild-type P450cam, but was much lower than those observed for classical peroxidases. The results presented in this paper form the first kinetic analysis of this intermediate for an artificial electron-driven P450cam catalytic pathway in solution.
TI  - Reaction mechanisms of non-heme diiron hydroxylases characterized in whole cells.
AB  - Whole cells expressing the non-heme diiron hydroxylases AlkB and toluene 4-monooxygenase (T4MO) were used to probe enzyme reaction mechanisms. AlkB catalyzes the hydroxylation of the radical clock substrates bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane (norcarane), spirooctane and 1,1-diethylcyclopropane, and does not catalyze the hydroxylation of the radical clocks 1,1-dimethylcyclopropane or 1,1,2,2-tetramethylcyclopropane. The hydroxylation of norcarane yields a distribution of products consistent with an "oxygen-rebound" mechanism for the enzyme in both the wild type Pseudomonas putida GPo1 and AlkB from P. putida GPo1 expressed in Escherichia coli. Evidence for the presence of a substrate-based radical during the reaction mechanism is clear. With norcarane, the lifetime of that radical varies with experimental conditions. Experiments with higher substrate concentrations yield a shorter radical lifetime (approximately 1 ns), while experiments with lower substrate concentrations yield a longer radical lifetime (approximately 19 ns). Consistent results were obtained using either wild type or AlkB-equipped host organisms using either "resting cell" or "growing cell" approaches. T4MO expressed in E. coli also catalyzes the hydroxylation of norcarane with a radical lifetime of approximately 0.07 ns. No radical lifetime dependence on substrate concentration was seen. Results from experiments with diethylcyclopropane, spirooctane, dimethylcyclopropane, and diethylcyclopropane are consistent with a restricted active site for AlkB.
TI  - Ability of IncP-9 plasmid pM3 to replicate in Escherichia coli is dependent on both rep and par functions.
AB  - IncP-9 plasmids are common in Pseudomonas species and can be transferred to other Gram-negative eubacteria but tend not to be stably maintained outside their natural host genus. A 1.3 kb ori V-rep fragment from IncP-9 plasmid pM3 was sufficient for autonomous replication in Pseudomonas putida but not in Escherichia coli. Replication of ori V-rep in E. coli was restored when additional rep was provided in trans, suggesting that the replication defect resulted from insufficient rep expression from its natural promoter. A promoter deficiency in E. coli was confirmed by reporter gene assays, transcriptional start point mapping and mutation of the promoter recognition elements. Dissection of the pM3 mini-replicon, pMT2, showed that this replication deficiency in E. coli is suppressed by additional determinants from its par operon: ParB, which can be supplied in trans, and its target, the par operon promoter, required in cis to ori V-rep. We propose that ParB binding to its target either changes plasmid DNA and thus promoter conformation or by spreading or looping contacts RNAP at the rep promoter so that rep expression is sufficient to activate ori V.
TI  - An improved method for single cell isolation of prokaryotes from meso-, thermo- and hyperthermophilic environments using micromanipulation.
AB  - This study presents an improved system that enables isolation of single viable prokaryotic cells from a mixture of cells. The system is based on an inverted microscope, a microinjector and a micromanipulator. The isolated cell is captured in a microcapillary from a volume of 400 mul and transferred to an appropriate growth medium. Validation of the system was performed using two fluorescent strains: Pseudomonas putida expressing red fluorescent protein (DsRed), and Escherichia coli expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP). A mixture (100:1) of the constructed fluorescent strains was subjected to isolation experiments and nine out of ten individually isolated cells yielded axenic cultures of E. coli. Upon construction and validation, the system was used to isolate and subsequently cultivate axenic cultures of the thermophilic Archaeon Metallosphaera sedula and the hyperthermophilic Archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus from enriched hot spring samples. The high efficiency of single-cell isolation and cultivation demonstrated over a range of temperatures-90% (30 degrees C), 85% (70 degrees C) and 95% (80 degrees C)-from different environments is probably due to the elimination of osmotic stress and limitation of temperature fluctuations during the isolation process, as a result of the large sample volume from which the cells are isolated.
TI  - A DNA polymerase V homologue encoded by TOL plasmid pWW0 confers evolutionary fitness on Pseudomonas putida under conditions of environmental stress.
AB  - Plasmids in conjunction with other mobile elements such as transposons are major  players in the genetic adaptation of bacteria in response to changes in environment. Here we show that a large catabolic TOL plasmid, pWW0, from Pseudomonas putida carries genes (rulAB genes) encoding an error-prone DNA polymerase Pol V homologue which increase the survival of bacteria under conditions of accumulation of DNA damage. A study of population dynamics in stationary phase revealed that the presence of pWW0-derived rulAB genes in the bacterial genome allows the expression of a strong growth advantage in stationary phase (GASP) phenotype of P. putida. When rulAB-carrying cells from an 8-day-old culture were mixed with Pol V-negative cells from a 1-day-old culture, cells derived from the aged culture out-competed cells from the nonaged culture and overtook the whole culture. At the same time, bacteria from an aged culture lacking the rulAB genes were only partially able to out-compete cells from a fresh overnight culture of the parental P. putida strain. Thus, in addition to conferring resistance to DNA damage, the plasmid-encoded Pol V genes significantly increase the evolutionary fitness of bacteria during prolonged nutritional starvation of a P. putida population. The results of our study indicate that RecA is involved in the control of expression of the pWW0-encoded Pol V.
TI  - Molecular characterization of the gallate dioxygenase from Pseudomonas putida KT2440. The prototype of a new subgroup of extradiol dioxygenases.
AB  - In this work we have characterized the galA gene product from Pseudomonas putida  KT2440, a ring-cleavage dioxygenase that acts specifically on gallate to produce 4-oxalomesaconate. The protein is a trimer composed by three identical subunits of 47.6 kDa (419 amino acids) that uses Fe2+ as the main cofactor. The gallate dioxygenase showed maximum activity at pH 7.0, and the Km and Vmax values for gallate were 144 microM and 53.2 micromol/min/mg of protein, respectively. A phylogenetic study suggests that the gallate dioxygenase from P. putida KT2440 is the prototype of a new subgroup of type II extradiol dioxygenases that share a common ancestor with protocatechuate 4,5-dioxygenases and whose two-domain architecture might have evolved from the fusion of the large and small subunits of the latter. A three-dimensional model for the N-terminal domain (residues 1-281) and C-terminal domain (residues 294-420) of the gallate dioxygenase from P. putida KT2440 was generated by comparison with the crystal structures of the large (LigB) and small (LigA) subunits of the protocatechuate 4,5-dioxygenase from Sphingomonas paucimobilis SYK-6. The expression of the galA gene was specifically induced when P. putida KT2440 cells grew in the presence of gallate. A P. putida KT2440 galA mutant strain was unable to use gallate as the sole carbon source and it did not show gallate dioxygenase activity, suggesting that the GalA protein is the only dioxygenase involved in gallate cleavage in this bacterium. This work points to the existence of a new pathway that is devoted to the catabolism of gallic acid and that remained unknown in the paradigmatic P. putida KT2440 strain.
TI  - The protein coded by the PP2216 gene of Pseudomonas putida KT2440 is an acyl-CoA  dehydrogenase that oxidises only short-chain aliphatic substrates.
AB  - A gene (PP2216) that codes for an acyl-CoA dehydrogenase was cloned from Pseudomonas putida strain KT2240 and over-expressed in Escherichia coli, and the recombinant enzyme purified and characterised. The enzyme is tetrameric with one FAD per subunit of molecular mass 40,500 Da. An anaerobic titration with sodium dithionite showed that the enzyme accepts two electrons. A similar titration with butyryl-CoA showed that reduction by this substrate was incomplete with 4.5 mol butyryl-CoA added per mol enzyme FAD; the equilibrium was used to calculate that the oxidation-reduction potential of the enzyme at pH 7 and 25 degrees C is 5+/-5 mV versus the standard hydrogen electrode. The enzyme shows catalytic activity with butyryl-CoA, valeryl-CoA and hexanoyl-CoA, and very low activity with heptanoyl-CoA and octanoyl-CoA; it fails to oxidise propionyl-CoA. These properties resemble those of short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenases from other sources. The enzyme is inactive with the CoA derivatives of all phenylalkanoates that were tested (side chains 3-8 carbon atoms) indicating that in contrast to an earlier suggestion, the enzyme is not involved in the beta-oxidation of aromatic compounds.
TI  - PnrA, a new nitroreductase-family enzyme in the TNT-degrading strain Pseudomonas  putida JLR11.
AB  - Nitroreductases are a group of proteins that catalyse pyridine nucleotide-dependent reduction of nitroaromatics compounds, showing significant human health and environmental implications. In this study we have identified the nitroreductase-family enzymes PnrA and PnrB from the TNT-degrading strain Pseudomonas putida. The enzyme encoded by the pnrA gene was expressed in Escherichia coli, purified to homogeneity and shown to be a flavoprotein that used 2 mol of NADPH to reduce 1 mol of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) to 4-hydroxylamine-2,6-dinitrotoluene, using a ping-pong bi-bi mechanism. The PnrA enzyme also recognized as substrates as a number of other nitroaromatic compounds, i.e. 2,4-dinitrotoluene, 3-nitrotoluene, 3- and 4-nitrobenzoate, 3,5-dinitrobenzamide and 3,5-dinitroaniline expanding the substrates profile from previously described nitroreductases. However, TNT resulted to be the most efficient substrate examined according to the Vmax/Km parameter. Expression analysis of pnrA- and pnrB-mRNA isolated from cells growing on different nitrogen sources suggested that expression of both genes was constitutive and that its level of expression was relatively constant regardless of the growth substrate. This is in agreement with enzyme-specific activity determined with cells growing with different N-sources.
TI  - Biodegradation of p-nitrophenol by P. putida.
AB  - A strain of Pseudomonas putida was found capable of metabolizing p-nitrophenol (PNP) as a sole source of carbon, nitrogen and energy. To explore the applicability of this strain for bioremediation for controlling environmental PNP pollution, its degradation potential at 300 and 500 ppm was examined in a medium devoid of carbon and nitrogen source (minimal medium). At A600, 0.5 OD inoculum, the strain metabolized 300 and 500 ppm within 36 and 72 h, respectively. The degradation was accompanied by release of stoichiometric amount of nitrite. Effect of glucose and nitrogen on PNP degradation under similar conditions revealed that (i) glucose (0.4 g/l) at 20 and 50 ppm PNP did not accelerate the rate of PNP degradation, while glucose (0.4 g/l) at 300 ppm PNP inhibited its degradation, (ii) nitrogen supplement viz. sodium nitrate and ammonium sulphate (0.04 and 0.4 g/l) in minimal medium with PNP (300 ppm) showed no effect on PNP degradation, while glutamate alone (0.04 and 0.4 g/l) showed mere rise in biomass (from 0.5 to 1.6 OD units), and (iii) acidic pH (4.0-6.5) did not support PNP degradation, while alkaline pH (7.5-9.5) significantly enhanced the rate of PNP degradation. The complete degradation of PNP at high concentration (300 ppm) was confirmed by HPTLC analysis. In order to probe root cause of higher PNP degradation, preliminary studies on genetic analysis of P. putida were undertaken, which revealed the prevalence of a degradative plasmid of approximately 15 kb, while cured derivatives of P. putida (PNP-) did not show ability to degrade PNP. Further conjugal transfer of PNP+ phenotype from P. putida to standard strain of E. coli Nova blue (PNP-) confirmed the degradative type of plasmid.
TI  - Aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbon consumption and transformation by the styrene  degrading strain Pseudomonas putida CA-3.
AB  - Pseudomonas putida CA-3 is capable of consuming a number of aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons. With the exception of styrene none of the alkenes tested are capable of supporting the growth of P. putida CA-3 as sole sources of carbon and energy. The highest rate of alkene consumption was observed with styrene as the substrate. A 6.5- and 15.5-fold lower rate of substrate consumption was observed with indene and indole with the concomitant formation of 2-indanone and indigo, respectively. The presence of a sulphur (benzothiopene) or oxygen (benzofuran) in the cyclopentene ring resulted in further decreases in the rate of substrate consumption by whole cells of P. putida CA-3. P. putida CA-3 is incapable of consuming benzene and consumes toluene at a low rate. No detectable products were observed in supernatants of cultures incubated with benzothiopene, benzofuran or toluene. The aliphatic alkenes 1-octene and 1,7-octadiene were both consumed by whole cells of P. putida CA-3 at a rate equivalent to indene consumption. The consumption of (R) styrene oxide was 1.7- and 1.25-fold higher than that of the S isomer and the racemic mix, respectively. The rate of racemic indene oxide, 1,2-epoxyoctane and 1,2-epoxy-7-octene consumption was lower than their equivalent alkene and 55-, 11.8-, and 27.5-fold lower than the rate of racemic styrene oxide consumption. A transposon mutant incapable of growth with styrene or styrene oxide failed to transform indole to indigo. The ratio of styrene utilisation relative to other substrates changes in the mutant strain compared to the wild-type strain, e.g., Indene biotransformation by mutant AF5 is 1.9-fold higher than styrene consumption compared to the wild-type strain CA-3 where the rate of styrene consumption is 6.7-fold higher than indene consumption. This trend is also observed for other alkenes and epoxides.
TI  - L: -Stereoselective amino acid amidase with broad substrate specificity from Brevundimonas diminuta: characterization of a new member of the leucine aminopeptidase family.
AB  - Brevundimonas diminuta TPU 5720 produces an amidase acting L-stereoselectively on phenylalaninamide. The enzyme (LaaA(Bd)) was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity by ammonium sulfate fractionation and four steps of column chromatography. The final preparation gave a single band on SDS-PAGE with a molecular weight of approximately 53,000. The native molecular weight of the enzyme was about 288,000 based on gel filtration chromatography, suggesting that the enzyme is active as a homohexamer. It had maximal activity at 50 degrees C and pH 7.5. LaaA(Bd) lost its activity almost completely on dialysis against potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), and the amidase activity was largely restored by the addition of Co(2+) ions. The enzyme was, however, inactivated in the presence of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid even in the presence of Co(2+), suggesting that LaaA(Bd) is a Co(2+)-dependent enzyme. LaaA(Bd) had hydrolyzing activity toward a broad range of L-amino acid amides including L-phenylalaninamide, L-glutaminamide, L-leucinamide, L-methioninamide, L-argininamide, and L-2-aminobutyric acid amide. Using information on the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the enzyme, the gene encoding LaaA(Bd) was cloned from the chromosomal DNA of the strain and sequenced. Analysis of 4,446 bp of the cloned DNA revealed the presence of seven open-reading frames (ORFs), one of which (laaA ( Bd )) encodes the amidase. LaaA(Bd) is composed of 491 amino acid residues (calculated molecular weight 51,127), and the deduced amino acid sequence exhibits significant similarity to that of ORFs encoding hypothetical cytosol aminopeptidases found in the genomes of Caulobacter crescentus, Bradyrhizobium japonicum, Rhodopseudomonas palustris, Mesorhizobium loti, and Agrobacterium tumefaciens, and leucine aminopeptidases, PepA, from Rickettsia prowazekii, Pseudomonas putida ATCC 12633, and Escherichia coli K-12. The laaA ( Bd ) gene modified in the nucleotide sequence upstream from its start codon was overexpressed in an E. coli transformant. The activity of the recombinant LaaA(Bd) in cell-free extracts of the E. coli transformant was 25.9 units mg(-1) with L-phenylalaninamide as substrate, which was 50 times higher than that of B. diminuta TPU 5720.
TI  - Impacts of goethite particles on UV disinfection of drinking water.
AB  - A unique association between bacterial cells and small goethite particles (approximately 0.2 by 2 microm) protected Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida from UV inactivation. The protection increased with the particle concentration in the turbidity range of 1 to 50 nephelometric turbidity units and with the bacterium-particle attachment time prior to UV irradiation. The lower degree of bacterial inactivation at longer attachment time was mostly attributed to the particle aggregation surrounding bacteria that provided shielding from UV radiation.
TI  - The IncP-6 plasmid Rms149 consists of a small mobilizable backbone with multiple  large insertions.
AB  - Plasmid Rms149, the archetype of Pseudomonas plasmid incompatibility group IncP-6, was identified in Pseudomonas aeruginosa as an agent conferring resistance to streptomycin, sulfanilamide, gentamicin, and carbenicillin in 1975. It has been classed as a broad-host-range plasmid due to its ability to replicate in both Escherichia coli (where it is designated IncG) and Pseudomonas species, although both species are gamma-proteobacteria. To provide reference information on this Inc group, we have determined the complete sequence of Rms149 and found that, although the genome comprises 57,121 bp, it is essentially a small mobilizable plasmid carrying multiple mobile elements, which make up 79% (>45 kb) of its genome. A replicon has been identified which encodes a single polypeptide with moderate identity to other replication proteins. The region encoding this protein can replicate in Pseudomonas putida and E. coli. This sequence is directly downstream of a putative partitioning region highly similar to that of pRA2. A functional IncQ-type mobilization region is also present. Thus, the backbone appears to be a novel combination of modules already identified in other plasmid systems. Analysis of the segments that fall outside this core of stable inheritance and transfer functions show that this plasmid has been subject to multiple insertion events and that the plasmid appears to carry a considerable load of DNA that no longer should be phenotypically advantageous. The plasmid therefore functions not just as a vehicle for spread of selective traits but also as a store for DNA that is not currently under selection.
TI  - Colonization of the Arabidopsis rhizosphere by fluorescent Pseudomonas spp. activates a root-specific, ethylene-responsive PR-5 gene in the vascular bundle.
AB  - Plants of which the roots are colonized by selected strains of non-pathogenic, fluorescent Pseudomonas spp. develop an enhanced defensive capacity against a broad spectrum of foliar pathogens. In Arabidopsis thaliana, this rhizobacteria-induced systemic resistance (ISR) functions independently of salicylic acid but requires responsiveness to jasmonic acid and ethylene. In contrast to pathogen-induced systemic acquired resistance (SAR), ISR is not associated with systemic changes in the expression of genes encoding pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins. To identify genes that are specifically expressed in response to colonization of the roots by ISR-inducing Pseudomonas fluorescens WCS417r bacteria, we screened a collection of Arabidopsis enhancer trap and gene trap lines containing a transposable element of the Ac/Ds system and the GUS reporter gene. We identified an enhancer trap line (WET121) that specifically showed GUS activity in the root vascular bundle upon colonization of the roots by WCS417r. Fluorescent Pseudomonas spp. strains P. fluorescens WCS374r and P. putida WCS358r triggered a similar expression pattern, whereas ISR-non-inducing Escherichia coli bacteria did not. Exogenous application of the ethylene precursor 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) mimicked the rhizobacteria-induced GUS expression pattern in the root vascular bundle, whereas methyl jasmonic acid and salicylic acid did not, indicating that the Ds element in WET121 is inserted in the vicinity of an ethylene-responsive gene. Analysis of the expression of the genes in the close vicinity of the Ds element revealed AtTLP1 as the gene responsible for the in cis activation of the GUS reporter gene in the root vascular bundle. AtTLP1 encodes a thaumatin-like protein that belongs to the PR-5 family of PR proteins, some of which possess antimicrobial properties. AtTLP1 knockout mutant plants showed normal levels of WCS417r-mediated ISR against the bacterial leaf pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000, suggesting that expression of AtTLP1 in the roots is not required for systemic expression of ISR in the leaves. Together, these results indicate that induction of AtTLP1 is a local response of Arabidopsis roots to colonization by non-pathogenic fluorescent Pseudomonas spp. and is unlikely to play a role in systemic resistance.
TI  - Elucidation of dominant effect on initial bacterial adhesion onto polymer surfaces prepared by radiation-induced graft polymerization.
AB  - Surface-modified polyethylene (PE) membrane sheets were prepared by the radiation-induced graft polymerization (RIGP) of an epoxy-group-containing monomer, glycidyl methacrylate (GMA). The epoxy ring of GMA was opened by introducing diethylamine (DEA) or sodium sulfite (SS). We examined the properties of these sheets by measuring the amount of grafting polymer, surface roughness and membrane potential, and also investigated the adhesion of five Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas putida, Pseudomonas fluorescens and Paracoccus denitrificans, onto the prepared sheet surfaces. A linear relationship between the degree of grafting (dg) and surface roughness was observed. Moreover, membrane potential was dependent on the amount of DEA or SS as the ionizable group. These results indicate that RIGP enables the control of the physicochemical properties of such a sheet surface by adjusting dg and the subsequent conversion of functional groups. A batch test on bacterial adhesion onto the sheets clarified that the DEA-containing sheet (DEA sheet) exhibited an adhesion rate constant, k, significantly greater than those of other types of sheet. Clearly, the adhesion rate constant of the DEA sheet increased with dg, indicating that electrostatic interaction is the most decisive factor for bacterial adhesion when it works as an attractive force. Furthermore, the densities of bacteria adhering onto the GMA-containing sheet (GMA sheet) and the SS-containing sheet (SS sheet) were almost the same as that onto a PE sheet, whereas that onto a DEA sheet significantly increased. Thus, the introduction of the GMA- and SS-containing graft chain did not have much influence on bacterial adhesion onto the surfaces, supporting the conclusion that the promotion of bacterial adhesion onto the GMA and SS sheets was due to an increase in surface area resulting from RIGP. Moreover, the scanning electron microscopy images of the sheet surfaces indicate that the conditions and morphologies of initial bacterial adhesion are dependent on surface properties, particularly membrane potential.
TI  - Characterization of copABCD operon from a copper-sensitive Pseudomonas putida strain.
AB  - We describe an operon, copABCD, that encodes copper-binding and sequestering proteins for copper homeostasis in the copper-sensitive strain Pseudomonas putida PNL-MK25. This is the second operon characterized as being involved in copper homeostasis, in addition to a P1-type ATPase encoded by cueAR, which was previously shown to be active in the same strain. In this study, 3 copper-responsive mutants were obtained through mini-Tn5::gfp mutagenesis and were found to exhibit reduced tolerance to copper. Sequencing analysis of the transposon-tagged region in the 3 mutants revealed insertions in 2 genes of an operon homologous to the copABCD of P. syringae and pcoABCD of Escherichia coli. Gene expression studies demonstrated that the P. putida copABCD is inducible starting from 3 micromol/L copper levels. Copper-sensitivity studies revealed that the tolerance of the mutant strains was reduced only marginally (only 0.16-fold) in comparison to a 6-fold reduced tolerance of the cueAR mutant. Thus, the cop operon in this strain has a minimal role when compared with its role both in other copper-resistant strains, such as P. syringae pv. syringae, and in the cueAR operon of the same strain. We propose that the reduced function of the copABCD operon is likely to be due to the presence of fewer metal-binding domains in the encoded proteins.
TI  - A thermostable phosphotriesterase from the archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus: cloning, overexpression and properties.
AB  - A new gene from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus MT4, coding for a putative protein reported to show sequence identity with the phosphotriesterase-related protein family (PHP), was cloned by means of the polymerase chain reaction from the S. solfataricus genomic DNA. In order to analyse the biochemical properties of the protein an overexpression system in Escherichia coli was established. The recombinant protein, expressed in soluble form at 5 mg/l of E. coli culture, was purified to homogeneity and characterized. In contrast with its mesophilic E. coli counterpart that was devoid of any tested activity, the S. solfataricus enzyme was demonstrated to have a low paraoxonase activity. This activity was dependent from metal cations with Co(2+), Mg(2+) and Ni(2+) being the most effective and was thermophilic and thermostable. The enzyme was inactivated with EDTA and o-phenantroline. A reported inhibitor for Pseudomonas putida phosphotriesterase (PTE) had no effect on the S. solfataricus paraoxonase. The importance of a stable paraoxonase for detoxification of chemical warfare agents and agricultural pesticides will be discussed.
TI  - Plasmid host-range: restrictions to F replication in Pseudomonas.
AB  - Host-range, a fundamental property of a bacterial plasmid, is primarily determined by the plasmid replication system. To investigate the basis of the restricted host-range of the well-studied F-plasmid of Escherichia coli, we characterized in vitro the interactions of the host DnaA initiation protein and DnaB helicase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas putida with the replication origin, oriS, and initiation protein, RepE, of the RepFIA replicon. The results presented here show that a pre-priming complex can form at the F-origin with the replication proteins from the non-native hosts in the presence of RepE. However, RepE cannot form a stable complex with DnaB of P. aeruginosa or P. putida but does stably interact with E. coli DnaB. This unstable association may affect the ability of F to replicate in Pseudomonas. In addition, replication studies in vivo suggest that inefficient expression of the RepE initiation protein from its native promoter in Pseudomonas is a factor in restricting its host-range. This, however, is not the only barrier to F replication, as mini-F derivatives with an alternative promoter for RepE expression do not replicate in P. putida and are not stably maintained in P. aeruginosa.
TI  - A two-component hydroxylase involved in the assimilation of 3-hydroxyphenyl acetate in Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - The complete catabolic pathway involved in the assimilation of 3-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (3-OH-PhAc) in Pseudomonas putida U has been established. This pathway is integrated by the following: (i) a specific route (upper pathway), which catalyzes the conversion of 3-OH-PhAc into 2,5-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (2,5-diOH-PhAc) (homogentisic acid, Hmg), and (ii) a central route (convergent route), which catalyzes the transformation of the Hmg generated from 3-OH-PhAc, l-Phe, and l-Tyr into fumarate and acetoacetate (HmgABC). Thus, in a first step the degradation of 3-OH-PhAc requires the uptake of 3-OH-PhAc by means of an active transport system that involves the participation of a permease (MhaC) together with phosphoenolpyruvate as the energy source. Once incorporated, 3-OH-PhAc is hydroxylated to 2,5-diOH-PhAc through an enzymatic reaction catalyzed by a novel two-component flavoprotein aromatic hydroxylase (MhaAB). The large component (MhaA, 62,719 Da) is a flavoprotein, and the small component (MhaB, 6,348 Da) is a coupling protein that is essential for the hydroxylation of 3-OH-PhAc to 2,5-diOH-PhAc. Sequence analyses and molecular biology studies revealed that homogentisic acid synthase (MhaAB) is different from the aromatic hydroxylases reported to date, accounting for its specific involvement in the catabolism of 3-OH-PhAc. Additionally, an ABC transport system (HmgDEFGHI) involved in the uptake of homogentisic acid and two regulatory elements (mhaSR and hmgR) have been identified. Furthermore, the cloning and the expression of some of the catabolic genes in different microbes presented them with the ability to synthesize Hmg (mhaAB) or allowed them to grow in chemically defined media containing 3-OH-PhAc as the sole carbon source (mhaAB and hmgABC).
TI  - Production and X-ray crystallographic analysis of fully deuterated cytochrome P450cam.
AB  - Neutron protein crystallography allows H-atom positions to be located in biological structures at the relatively modest resolution of 1.5-2.0 A. A difficulty of this technique arises from the incoherent scattering from hydrogen, which considerably reduces the signal-to-noise ratio of the data. This can be overcome by preparing fully deuterated samples. Efficient protocols for routine and low-cost production of in vivo deuterium-enriched proteins have been developed. Here, the overexpression and crystallization of highly (>99%) deuterium-enriched cytochrome P450cam for neutron analysis is reported. Cytochrome P450cam from Pseudomonas putida catalyses the hydroxylation of camphor from haem-bound molecular O(2) via a mechanism that is thought to involve a proton-shuttle pathway to the active site. Since H atoms cannot be visualized in available X-ray structures, neutron diffraction is being used to determine the protonation states and water structure at the active site of the enzyme. Analysis of both hydrogenated and perdeuterated P450cam showed no significant changes between the X-ray structures determined at 1.4 and 1.7 A, respectively. This work demonstrates that the fully deuterated protein is highly isomorphous with the native (hydrogenated) protein and is appropriate for neutron protein crystallographic analysis.
TI  - Poly(3-hydroxyalkanoate) polymerase synthesis and in vitro activity in recombinant Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - We tested the synthesis and in vitro activity of the poly(3-hydroxyalkanoate) (PHA) polymerase 1 from Pseudomonas putida GPo1 in both P. putida GPp104 and Escherichia coli JMU193. The polymerase encoding gene phaC1 was expressed using the inducible PalkB promoter. It was found that the production of polymerase could be modulated over a wide range of protein levels by varying inducer concentrations. The optimal inducer dicyclopropylketone concentrations for PHA production were at 0.03% (v/v) for P. putida and 0.005% (v/v) for E. coli. Under these concentrations the maximal polymerase level synthesized in the E. coli host (6% of total protein) was about three- to fourfold less than that in P. putida (20%), whereas the maximal level of PHA synthesized in the E. coli host (8% of total cell dry weight) was about fourfold less than that in P. putida (30%). In P. putida, the highest specific activity of polymerase was found in the mid-exponential growth phase with a maximum of 40 U/g polymerase, whereas in E. coli, the maximal specific polymerase activity was found in the early stationary growth phase (2 U/g polymerase). Our results suggest that optimal functioning of the PHA polymerase requires factors or a molecular environment that is available in P. putida but not in E. coli.
TI  - Asparagine-473 residue is important to the efficient function of human dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase.
AB  - Dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (E3) catalyzes the reoxidation of dihydrolipoyl moiety of the acyltransferase components of three alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase complexes and of the hydrogen-carrier protein of the glycine cleavage system. His-457 of Pseudomonas putida E3 is suggested to interact with the hydroxyl group of Tyr-18 of the other subunit and with Glu-446, a component in the last helical structure. To examine the importance of the suggested interactions in human E3 function, the corresponding residue of human E3, Asn-473, was substituted to Leu using site-directed mutagenesis. The E3 mutant was expressed in Escherichia coli and highly purified using an affinity column. Its E3 activity was decreased about 37-fold, indicating that Asn-473 residue was important to the efficient catalytic function of human E3. Its slightly altered spectroscopic properties implied that small conformational changes could occur in the E3 mutant.
TI  - Heterologous expression of a myxobacterial natural products assembly line in pseudomonads via red/ET recombineering.
AB  - Natural products of microbial origin are widely used as pharmaceuticals and in agrochemistry. These compounds are often biosynthesized by multifunctional megasynthetases whose genetic engineering and heterologous expression offer considerable promise, especially if the natural hosts are genetically difficult to handle, slow growing, unculturable, or even unknown. We describe a straightforward strategy that combines the power of advanced DNA engineering (recombiogenic cloning) in Escherichia coli with the utility of pseudomonads as the heterologous host for the analysis and mutagenesis of known and unknown secondary metabolite pathways. The myxochromide S biosynthetic gene cluster from Stigmatella aurantiaca was rebuilt and engineered in E. coli to contain the elements required for expression in pseudomonads. The successful production in Pseudomonas putida, at unprecedented levels, demonstrates the feasibility of the new approach to the analysis and mutagenesis of these important pathways.
TI  - Exploiting Pseudomonas putida for drug development.
AB  - In this issue of Chemistry & Biology, a strategy that combines large DNA fragment recombineering in Escherichia coli and heterologous expression in Pseudomonas putida is described. The work focuses on myxochromide S, a natural compound produced by Stigmatella aurantiaca.
TI  - Expression of PHA polymerase genes of Pseudomonas putida in Escherichia coli and  its effect on PHA formation.
AB  - Poly-3-hydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are synthesized by many bacteria as intracellular storage material. The final step in PHA biosynthesis is catalyzed by two PHA polymerases (phaC) in Pseudomonas putida. The expression of these two phaC genes (phaC1 and phaC2)was studied in Escherichia coli, either under control of the native promoter or under control of an external promoter. It was found that the two phaC genes are not expressed in E. coli without an external promoter. During heterologous expression of phaC from Plac on a high copy number plasmid, a rapid reduction of the number of colony forming units was observed, especially for phaC2. It appears that the plasmid instability was partially caused by high-level production of PHA polymerase. Subsequently, tightly regulated phaC2 expression systems on a low copy number vector were applied in E. coli. This resulted in PHA yields of over 20 of total cell dry weight, which was 2 fold higher than that obtained from the system where phaC2 is present on a high copy number vector. In addition, the PHA monomer composition differed when different gene expression systems or different phaC genes were applied.
TI  - Construction and evaluation of nagR-nagAa::lux fusion strains in biosensing for salicylic acid derivatives.
AB  - The NagR protein is a response regulatory protein found in the bacterium Ralstonia sp. U2 that is involved in sensing for salicylic acid and the subsequent induction of the operon just upstream of its gene. The genes encoded for in this operon are involved in the degradation of salicylic acid. Escherichia coli strain RFM443 carrying a fusion of the Photorhabdus luminescens luxCDABE operon with the nagR gene and upstream region of the nagAa gene was constructed and characterized with respect to its optimum temperature, its response time and kinetics, and its ability to detect numerous benzoic acid derivatives. Although capable of detecting 0.5 mM salicylic acid at any temperature between 28 and 40 degrees C, this E. coli strain, labeled DNT5, showed its greatest relative activity at 30 degrees C, i.e., the temperature at which the largest induction was seen. Furthermore, experiments done with numerous benzoic acid derivatives found the NagR protein to be responsive to only a few of the compounds tested, including salicylic acid and 3-methyl salicylic acid, and acetyl salicylic acid was the strongest inducer. The lower limits of detection for these compounds with E. coli strain DNT5 were also established, with the native inducer, salicylic acid, giving the most sensitive response and detectable down to a concentration of about 2 microM. A second lux fusion plasmid was also constructed and transformed into an NahR background, Pseudomonas putida KCTC1768. Within this strain, NAGK-1768, the supplemental activity of the NahR protein on the nagAa promoter, was shown to extend both the range of chemicals detected and the sensitivity.
TI  - The multidrug efflux regulator TtgV recognizes a wide range of structurally different effectors in solution and complexed with target DNA: evidence from isothermal titration calorimetry.
AB  - TtgV modulates the expression of the ttgGHI operon, which encodes an efflux pump  that extrudes a wide variety of chemicals including mono- and binuclear aromatic hydrocarbons, aliphatic alcohols, and antibiotics of dissimilar chemical structure. Using a 'lacZ fusion to the ttgG promoter, we show that the most efficient in vivo inducers were 1-naphthol, 2,3-dihydroxynaphthalene, 4-nitrotoluene, benzonitrile, and indole. The thermodynamic parameters for the binding of different effector molecules to purified TtgV were determined by isothermal titration calorimetry. For the majority of effectors, the interaction was enthalpy-driven and counterbalance by unfavorable entropy changes. The TtgV-effector dissociation constants were found to vary between 2 and 890 mum. There was a relationship between TtgV affinity for the different effectors and their potential to induce gene expression in vivo, indicating that the effector binding constant is a major determinant for efficient efflux pump gene expression. Equilibrium dialysis and isothermal titration calorimetry studies indicated that a TtgV dimer binds one effector molecule. No evidence for the simultaneous binding of multiple effectors to TtgV was obtained. The binding of TtgV to a 63-bp DNA fragment containing its cognate operator was tight and entropy-driven (K(D) = 2.4 +/- 0.35 nm, DeltaH = 5.5 +/- 0.04 kcal/mol). The TtgV-DNA complex was shown to bind 1-napthol with an affinity comparable with the free soluble TtgV protein, K(D) = 4.8 +/- 0.19 and 3.0 +/- 0.15 mum, respectively. The biological relevance of this finding is discussed.
TI  - Escherichia coli ORF ybhE is pgl gene encoding 6-phosphogluconolactonase (EC 3.1.1.31) that has no homology with known 6PGLs from other organisms.
AB  - The pentose-phosphate pathway (PPP) is an important part of central metabolism in many organisms. A pgl(-) mutation that decreases the efficiency of the second stage of PPP has been described and mapped at approx. 17.2 min of the Escherichia coli chromosome more than 30 years ago. Although it has recently been shown that deletion of ORF ybhE leads to earlier detected Pgl(-) phenotype for E. coli mutant strain, 6-phosphogluconolactonase from this organism has not been characterized. In the present, independent investigation we show that the Pgl(-) phenotype of DeltaybhE MG1655 could be complemented by insertion of the well-characterized pgl gene from Pseudomonas putida whose protein product has no visible homology with E. coli YbhE. Moreover, a final confirmation that ybhE actually encodes 6PGL in E. coli was obtained through overexpression of the cloned gene, purification of the protein product, followed by direct determination of its enzymatic activity in vitro.
TI  - Stress-related Pseudomonas genes involved in production of bacteriocin LlpA.
AB  - Pseudomonas sp. BW11M1 produces a novel type of bacteriocin that inhibits the growth of Pseudomonas putida GR12-2R3 and some phytopathogenic fluorescent Pseudomonas. A collection of mutants was screened for altered bacteriocin production phenotypes. Strongly reduced bacteriocin production was found to be caused by inactivation of the recA gene or the spoT gene. Conversely, in a recJ mutant, the bacteriocin was constitutively overproduced. The same phenotype was observed for a mutant hit in a gene of unknown function. The predicted gene product belongs to a distinct subgroup of prokaryotic helicase-like proteins within the SWI/SNF family of regulatory proteins. One mutant that also exhibited a bacteriocin overproducer phenotype was deficient in the production of the peptidoglycan-associated lipoprotein OprL. This study shows that various environmental stress response pathways are involved in controlling expression of the Pseudomonas sp. BW11M1 bacteriocin.
TI  - p-Cresol methylhydroxylase: alteration of the structure of the flavoprotein subunit upon its binding to the cytochrome subunit.
AB  - The structures of two forms of a recombinant flavoprotein have been determined at high resolution and compared. These proteins are (1) the flavocytochrome c p-cresol methylhydroxylase (rPCMH, 1.85 A resolution) and (2) the cytochrome-free flavoprotein subunit of rPCMH (PchF, 1.30 A resolution). A significant conformational difference is observed in a protein segment that is in contact with the re face of the isoalloxazine ring of FAD when the structure of PchF is compared to the subunit in the intact flavocytochrome. This structural change is important for optimum catalytic function of the flavoprotein, which has been shown to be dependent on the presence of the cytochrome subunit. This change results in different protein-flavin and apparently different protein-substrate interactions that have a "tuning effect" on the electronic and redox properties of bound p-cresol and the covalently bound FAD. The conformational change in the segment in the cofactor-binding site is induced by a small rearrangement in the flavoprotein-cytochrome interface region of the flavoprotein.
TI  - EPR studies of chlorocatechol 1,2-dioxygenase: evidences of iron reduction during catalysis and of the binding of amphipatic molecules.
AB  - Chlorocatechol 1,2-dioxygenase from Pseudomonas putida (Pp 1,2-CCD) is a dioxygenase responsible for ring cleavage during the degradation of recalcitrant aromatic compounds. We determined the zero-field splitting of the Fe(III) cofactor (|D| = 1.3 +/- 0.2 cm(-1)) by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) experiments that along with other structural data allowed us to infer the Fe(III) coordination environment. The EPR spectrum of the ion shows a significantly decrease of the g = 4.3 resonance upon substrate binding. This result is rationalized in terms of a mechanism previously proposed, where catechol substrate is activated by Fe(III), yielding an exchange-coupled Fe(II)-semiquinone (pair). The Pp 1,2-CCD capacity of binding amphipatic molecules and the effects of such binding on protein activity are also investigated. EPR spectra of spin labels show a protein-bound component, which was characterized by means of spectral simulations. Our results indicate that Pp 1,2-CCD is able to bind amphipatic molecules in a channel with the headgroup pointing outwards into the solvent, whereas the carbon chain is held inside the tunnel. Protein assays show that the enzyme activity is significantly lowered in the presence of stearic-acid molecules. The role of the binding of those molecules as an enzyme activity modulator is discussed.
TI  - N-methyl-L-amino acid dehydrogenase from Pseudomonas putida. A novel member of an unusual NAD(P)-dependent oxidoreductase superfamily.
AB  - We found N-methyl-L-amino acid dehydrogenase activity in various bacterial strains, such as Pseudomonas putida and Bacillus alvei, and cloned the gene from P. putida ATCC12633 into Escherichia coli. The enzyme purified to homogeneity from recombinant E. coli catalyzed the NADPH-dependent formation of N-alkyl-L-amino acids from the corresponding alpha-oxo acids (e.g. pyruvate, phenylpyruvate, and hydroxypyruvate) and alkylamines (e.g. methylamine, ethylamine, and propylamine). Ammonia was inert as a substrate, and the enzyme was clearly distinct from conventional NAD(P)-dependent amino acid dehydrogenases, such as alanine dehydrogenase (EC 1.4.1.1). NADPH was more than 300 times more efficient than NADH as a hydrogen donor in the enzymatic reductive amination. Primary structure analysis revealed that the enzyme belongs to a new NAD(P)-dependent oxidoreductase superfamily, the members of which show no sequence homology to conventional NAD(P)-dependent amino acid dehydrogenases and opine dehydrogenases.
TI  - Rapid and simple quantification of bacterial cells by using a microfluidic device.
AB  - This study investigated a microfluidic chip-based system (on-chip flow cytometry) for quantification of bacteria both in culture and in environmental samples. Bacterial numbers determined by this technique were similar to those obtained by direct microscopic count. The time required for this on-chip flow cytometry was only 30 min per 6 samples.
TI  - Isotope labeling and microautoradiography of active heterotrophic bacteria on the basis of assimilation of 14CO(2).
AB  - Most heterotrophic bacteria assimilate CO(2) in various carboxylation reactions during biosynthesis. In this study, assimilation of (14)CO(2) by heterotrophic bacteria was used for isotope labeling of active microorganisms in pure cultures and environmental samples. Labeled cells were visualized by microautoradiography (MAR) combined with fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to obtain simultaneous information about activity and identity. Cultures of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida assimilated sufficient (14)CO(2) during growth on various organic substrates to obtain positive MAR signals. The MAR signals were comparable with the traditional MAR approach based on uptake of (14)C-labeled organic substrates. Experiments with E. coli showed that (14)CO(2) was assimilated during both fermentation and aerobic and anaerobic respiration. The new MAR approach, HetCO(2)-MAR, was evaluated by targeting metabolic active filamentous bacteria, including "Candidatus Microthrix parvicella" in activated sludge. "Ca. Microthrix parvicella" was able to take up oleic acid under anaerobic conditions, as shown by the traditional MAR approach with [(14)C]oleic acid. However, the new HetCO(2)-MAR approach indicated that "Ca. Microthrix parvicella," did not significantly grow on oleic acid under anaerobic conditions with or without addition of NO(2)(-), whereas the addition of O(2) or NO(3)(-) initiated growth, as indicated by detectable (14)CO(2) assimilation. This is a metabolic feature that has not been described previously for filamentous bacteria. Such information could not have been derived by using the traditional MAR procedure, whereas the new HetCO(2)-MAR approach differentiates better between substrate uptake and substrate metabolism that result in growth. The HetCO(2)-MAR results were supported by stable isotope analysis of (13)C-labeled phospholipid fatty acids from activated sludge incubated under aerobic and anaerobic conditions in the presence of (13)CO(2). In conclusion, the novel HetCO(2)-MAR approach expands the possibility for studies of the ecophysiology of uncultivated microorganisms.
TI  - Aerobic biodegradation of N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) by axenic bacterial strains.
AB  - The water contaminant N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) is a probable human carcinogen whose appearance in the environment is related to the release of rocket fuel and to chlorine-based disinfection of water and wastewater. Although this compound has been shown to be biodegradable, there is minimal information about the organisms capable of this degradation, and little is understood of the mechanisms or biochemistry involved. This study shows that bacteria expressing monooxygenase enzymes functionally similar to those demonstrated to degrade NDMA in eukaryotes have the capability to degrade NDMA. Specifically, induction of the soluble methane monooxygenase (sMMO) expressed by Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b, the propane monooxygenase (PMO) enzyme of Mycobacterium vaccae JOB-5, and the toluene 4-monooxygenases found in Ralstonia pickettii PKO1 and Pseudomonas mendocina KR1 resulted in NDMA degradation by these strains. In each of these cases, brief exposure to acetylene gas, a suicide substrate for certain monooxygenases, inhibited the degradation of NDMA. Further, Escherichia coli TG1/pBS(Kan) containing recombinant plasmids derived from the toluene monooxygenases found in strains PKO1 and KR1 mimicked the behavior of the parent strains. In contrast, M. trichosporium OB3b expressing the particulate form of MMO, Burkholderia cepacia G4 expressing the toluene 2-monooxygenase, and Pseudomonas putida mt-2 expressing the toluene sidechain monooxygenase were not capable of NDMA degradation. In addition, bacteria expressing aromatic dioxygenases were not capable of NDMA degradation. Finally, Rhodococcus sp. RR1 exhibited the ability to degrade NDMA by an unidentified, constitutively expressed enzyme that, unlike the confirmed monooxygenases, was not inhibited by acetylene exposure.
TI  - Analysis of column tortuosity for MnCl2 and bacterial diffusion using magnetic resonance imaging.
AB  - Subsurface bacteria often have to travel significant distances through tortuous porous media for purposes of groundwater remediation. In modeling such processes, motile bacteria are often represented as suspended colloids, ignoring their individual swimming or diffusive properties. In fact, bacterial migration is much more profoundly affected by the presence of porous media than is that of a chemical contaminant. In this study, we use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to perform noninvasive measurements of changes in bacterial concentration distributions across a packed column at a spatial resolution of 330 microm as a function of time. We analyze the diffusive behavior of Pseudomonas putida F1 under static conditions and compare that behavior to the diffusion of a chemical solute and of Escherichia coli NR50. Results indicate that P. putida cells experience a column tortuosity 50 times higher than that predicted from solute diffusion experiments. E. coli cells, which display shorter swimming run lengths in bulk solution than P. putida, seem to be less affected by the constricted pore space. Knudsen diffusion, or reductions in run length because of interactions between the diffusing bacteria and the porous media, may help to explain some of this discrepancy.
TI  - REP code: defining bacterial identity in extragenic space.
AB  - Through the analysis of 57 bacterial genomes we have detected repetitive extragenic palindromic DNA sequences (REPs) in 11 species. For a sequence to be considered as REP, the following criteria should be met: (i) It should be extragenic, (ii) palindromic, (iii) of a length between 21 and 65 bases and (iv) should constitute more than 0.5% of the total extragenic space. Species-specific REPs have been found in human pathogens such as Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, Neisseria meningitidis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Rickettsia conorii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the plant pathogen Agrobacterium tumefaciens and the soil bacteria Deinococcus radiodurans, Pseudomonas putida and Sinorhizobium meliloti.
TI  - Synthesis and antibacterial activity of 4-benzoyl-1-methyl-5-phenyl-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxylic acid and derivatives.
AB  - Some new 1H-pyrazole-3-carboxylic acid and pyridazinone derivatives were synthesized and evaluated for their antibacterial activities against Bacillus cereus ATCC 7064, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, Escherichia coli ATCC 4230 and Pseudomonas putida using tube dilution method. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) experiments revealed that all chemical compounds showed inhibitor effects on the growth of the test microorganisms. Moreover, the results of this research showed that the compound named as 5c was the best compound in the series, exhibiting antibacterial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Relationship between charge-transfer interactions, redox potentials, and catalysis for different forms of the flavoprotein component of p-cresol methylhydroxylase.
AB  - Thirty-three variants of the flavoprotein component of p-cresol methylhydroxylase that contain noncovalently or covalently bound flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) analogues were studied. A very good correlation was found between the efficiency of p-cresol oxidation by these proteins and E(CT), the energy for the maximum wavelength for the charge-transfer band of the complex between the bound flavin and 4-bromophenol, a substrate mimic. The correlation covers a range of k(cat) values that spans over 5 orders of magnitude and values of E(CT) that span 900 mV, and the analysis of the data provided a value of the transfer coefficient, alpha, of 0.31. This study demonstrates clearly that the redox properties of both the bound substrate and the flavin cofactor must be taken into account to explain the relative catalytic efficiencies of the variant flavoproteins.
TI  - NahR: effects of replacements at Asn 169 and Arg 248 on promoter binding and inducer recognition.
AB  - NahR, a member of the LysR regulator family, is a positive transcriptional regulator for genes of the naphthalene degradation pathway in Pseudomonas sp. To study NahR binding properties, five single and six double mutants were made at residues 169 and/or 248, which are located in the central inducer recognition domain and the C-terminal multimerization domain of the protein, respectively. The effects of these mutations were examined by monitoring the expression of a firefly luciferase (luc) reporter gene under the control of NahR. We found that all mutants responded to induction by both salicylate and benzoate, whereas the wild-type NahR responded only to salicylate. Mutants N169E, N169E/R248C, and N169E/R248K showed low basal activities with high-level inducer responses, whereas mutant N169D/R248K showed high basal activity with inducer-independent responses. A gel retardation assay demonstrated that the different basal activities might be related to altered binding affinities of the NahR mutants to the Psal promoter. Together, these data suggest that NahR residues 169 and 248 might be involved in DNA binding as well as inducer recognition/binding.
TI  - Biosensor-based diagnostics of contaminated groundwater: assessment and remediation strategy.
AB  - Shallow groundwater beneath a former airfield site in southern England has been heavily contaminated with a wide range of chlorinated solvents. The feasibility of using bacterial biosensors to complement chemical analysis and enable cost-effective, and focussed sampling has been assessed as part of a site evaluation programme. Five different biosensors, three metabolic (Vibrio fischeri, Pseudomonas fluorescens 10568 and Escherichia coli HB101) and two catabolic (Pseudomonas putida TVA8 and E. coli DH5alpha), were employed to identify areas where the availability and toxicity of pollutants is of most immediate environmental concern. The biosensors used showed different sensitivities to each other and to the groundwater samples tested. There was generally a good agreement with chemical analyses. The potential efficacy of remediation strategies was explored by coupling sample manipulation to biosensor tests. Manipulation involved sparging and charcoal treatment procedures to simulate remediative engineering solutions. Sparging was sufficient at most locations.
TI  - Cloning and expression of the polyhydroxyalkanote depolymerase gene from Pseudomonas putida, and characterization of the gene product.
AB  - A polyhydroxyalkanote (PHA) depolymerase gene ( pha Z) was cloned by PCR from Pseudomonas putida and over-expressed in Escherichia coli as inclusion bodies. Nucleotide sequence analysis predicted an 852 bp open reading frame encoding a protein of 283 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of 31283 Da. The deduced amino acid sequence had at least 80% homology to the PHA depolymerase from other Pseudomonas strains and consisted a conserved lipase box-like sequence (G-X-S(102)-X-G). The inclusion bodies were refolded and biochemically characterized. The depolymerase activity was optimal at 40 degrees C and pH 8.
TI  - Construction and comparison of Escherichia coli whole-cell biosensors capable of  detecting aromatic compounds.
AB  - The XylR regulatory protein is a transcription factor involved in the BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene) degradation pathway in Pseudomonas species. When XylR-dependent stimulation of transcription from a plasmid containing XylR and its cognate promoters Pr and Pu was monitored as firefly luciferase activities in Escherichia coli, a notably high level of basal activity was observed in the absence of inducers. To improve the response specificity of XylR in this system, two related but different promoters were tested for their activities; the XylS activator promoter Ps and the DmpR activator promoter Po. Po with the deletion of its own upstream activating sequences (UASs; Po') showed a very low level of basal activity compared to Pu and Ps. The maximum level with the addition of inducers was increased 3151-fold by o-xylene with Po', while it was 31.5 and 74.1 fold by m-xylene with Pu and Ps, respectively. Gel mobility shift assay showed that the purified XylR without inducers can bind to Pr/Pu but not to Pr/Po', implying that XylR multimerization with Pr/Pu could be formed for initiation of transcription in this system. The data suggest that Po' can be an excellent alternative in constructing a signal-intensified, whole-cell biosensor in response to the xenobiotics.
TI  - Use of Pseudomonas putida EstA as an anchoring motif for display of a periplasmic enzyme on the surface of Escherichia coli.
AB  - The functional expression of proteins on the surface of bacteria has proven important for numerous biotechnological applications. In this report, we investigated the N-terminal fusion display of the periplasmic enzyme beta-lactamase (Bla) on the surface of Escherichia coli by using the translocator domain of the Pseudomonas putida outer membrane esterase (EstA), which is a member of the lipolytic autotransporter enzymes. To find out the transport function of a C-terminal domain of EstA, we generated a set of Bla-EstA fusion proteins containing N-terminally truncated derivatives of the EstA C-terminal domain. The surface exposure of the Bla moiety was verified by whole-cell immunoblots, protease accessibility, and fluorescence-activated cell sorting. The investigation of growth kinetics and host cell viability showed that the presence of the EstA translocator domain in the outer membrane neither inhibits cell growth nor affects cell viability. Furthermore, the surface-exposed Bla moiety was shown to be enzymatically active. These results demonstrate for the first time that the translocator domain of a lipolytic autotransporter enzyme is an effective anchoring motif for the functional display of heterologous passenger protein on the surface of E. coli. This investigation also provides a possible topological model of the EstA translocator domain, which might serve as a basis for the construction of fusion proteins containing heterologous passenger domains.
TI  - The putative malate/lactate dehydrogenase from Pseudomonas putida is an NADPH-dependent delta1-piperideine-2-carboxylate/delta1-pyrroline-2-carboxylate reductase involved in the catabolism of D-lysine and D-proline.
AB  - A Pseudomonas putida ATCC12633 gene, dpkA, encoding a putative protein annotated  as malate/L-lactate dehydrogenase in various sequence data bases was disrupted by homologous recombination. The resultant dpkA(-) mutant was deprived of the ability to use D-lysine and also D-proline as a sole carbon source. The dpkA gene was cloned and overexpressed in Escherichia coli, and the gene product was characterized. The enzyme showed neither malate dehydrogenase nor lactate dehydrogenase activity but catalyzed the NADPH-dependent reduction of such cyclic imines as Delta(1)-piperideine-2-carboxylate and Delta(1)-pyrroline-2-carboxylate to form L-pipecolate and L-proline, respectively. NADH also served as a hydrogen donor for both substrates, although the reaction rates were less than 1% of those with NADPH. The reverse reactions were also catalyzed by the enzyme but at much lower rates. Thus, the enzyme has dual metabolic functions, and we named the enzyme Delta(1)-piperideine-2-carboxylate/Delta(1)-pyrroline-2-carboxylate reductase, the first member of a novel subclass in a large family of NAD(P)-dependent oxidoreductases.
TI  - Monitoring aromatic hydrocarbons by whole cell electrochemical biosensors.
AB  - In this article, we describe a bacterial whole cell electrochemical biosensors system that can be used for monitoring aromatic hydrocarbons. These bacterial biosensors are based on fusions of a promoter that is sensitive to aromatic compounds (the promoter region of the xylS gene and the xylR gene coding for the transcriptional regulator of the xyl operon) to reporter genes that can be monitored electrochemically at real-time and on-line. The xylS promoter was fused upstream of two promoterless genes coding the lacZ gene and phoA. These constructs reacted specifically to aromatic compounds but not to nonaromatic compounds, and we could detect, within minutes, micromolar concentrations of different aromatic hydrocarbons such as xylene and toluene. The use of two different reporter genes allows the future construction of a multianalyte detection system for simultaneous monitoring of several pollutants. These whole cell biosensors are potentially useful for on-line and in situ detection of aromatic compounds and as early warning systems of environmental hazards.
TI  - Transcriptional regulation of pWW0 transfer genes in Pseudomonas putida KT2440.
AB  - The conjugative IncP-9 plasmid pWW0 (TOL) carries transfer genes, many of whose functions can be predicted from sequence similarities to the well-studied IncW and IncP-1 plasmids, and that are clustered with the replication and maintenance genes of the plasmid core. In this study we show that the IncP-9 transfer genes are transcribed from at least three promoter regions. The promoters for traA and traD act divergently from the region found to encode the origin of transfer, oriT. These promoters regulate expression of traA, B, and perhaps traC in one direction and traD in the other, all of whose gene products are predicted to be involved in relaxasome formation and DNA processing during transfer, and they are repressed by TraA. The third promoter region, upstream of mpfR, is responsible for transcription of mpfR and mpfA to mpfJ, encoding proteins involved in mating pair formation. Transcription from this region is negatively autoregulated by MpfR. Thus the pWW0 transfer genes, like those of the IncP-1 plasmids, are expressed at all times, but kept in control by a negative feed back loop to limit the metabolic burden on the host. Although many of the related mating pair formation systems are, as in pWW0, transcribed divergently from an operon for replication and/or stable inheritance functions, MpfR is not related to the known regulatory proteins of these other transfer systems outside those of the IncP-9 family and indeed the regulators tend to be specific for each plasmid family. This suggests that the general pattern of genetic organisation exhibited by these systems has arisen a number of times independently and must therefore be highly favourable to plasmid survival and spread.
TI  - Use of heterotrophic CO2 assimilation as a measure of metabolic activity in planktonic and sessile bacteria.
AB  - We have examined whether assimilation of CO2 can be used as a measure of metabolic activity in planktonic and sessile heterotrophic bacteria. CO2 assimilation by environmental samples and pure cultures of heterotrophic bacteria was studied using 14CO2 and 13CO2 as tracers. Heterotrophic growth on complex organic substrates resulted in assimilation of CO2 into cell biomass by activated sludge, drinking water biofilm, and pure cultures of Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Es. coli ATCC 13706, Rhodococcus ruber, Burkholderia sp., Bacillus circulans, Pseudomonas putida, Pseudomonas stutzeri, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Analysis of 13C-labelled phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) confirmed that heterotrophic bacteria may assimilate 13CO2 into cell macromolecules such as membrane lipids. All major PLFAs extracted from activated sludge and drinking water biofilm samples were enriched in 13C after incubation with CO2. Between 1.4% and 6.5% of the biomass produced by cultures of P. putida and a drinking water biofilm during growth in complex media was apparently derived from assimilation of CO2. Resting cells assimilated less CO2 compared to actively growing cells, and CO2 assimilation activity correlated with the amount of biomass produced during heterotrophic growth. The 14CO2 assimilation assay was evaluated as a tool to examine inhibitory effects of biocides on planktonic and sessile heterotrophs (biofilms). On the basis of 14CO2 assimilation activity, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of benzalkonium chloride was estimated to 21.1 and 127.2 mg l(-1) for planktonic and biofilm samples, respectively. The results indicate that assimilation of isotopically labelled CO2 can be used as a relatively simple measure of metabolic activity in heterotrophic bacteria. CO2 assimilation assays may be used to study the effects of antimicrobial agents on growth and survival of planktonic and sessile heterotrophic organisms.
TI  - Biocatalytic synthesis of polycatechols from toxic aromatic compounds.
AB  - A process is described in which toxic aromatic compounds are converted by toluene dioxygenase and in turn toluene cis-dihydrodiol dehydrogenase to catechols which are further polymerized by peroxidase-catalyzed oxidation producing polycatechols. Three approaches for obtaining catechols were employed: (1) addition of halogenated aromatics to P. putida F1, resulting in the accumulation of halogenated catechols; (2) inhibition of catechol 2,3-dioxygenase of P. putida F1 by known aromatic and aliphatic inhibitors; and (3) overexpression of toluene dioxygenase and toluene cis-dihydrodiol dehydrogenase genes in E. coli JM109. The process is suitable for producing novel catechols that upon oxidation may yield polymers with unique properties, presenting a tool for producing tailor-made biopolymers. Formation of 3-chlorocatechol from chlorobenzene, 3,4-dichlorocatechol from 1,2-dichlorobenzene, and catechol from benzene and their subsequent oxidation and polymerization was demonstrated. Oxidation of catechol yielded polymers with molecular weights of up to 4000 Daltons. Their apparently high water solubility eliminates the need for water-miscible solvents. In aqueous solution oxidation of catechols was rapid, yet the presence of 20%, 30%, and 40% ethanol, resulted in a rate decrease of 31%, 95%, and 93%, respectively. The advantage is that significantly less peroxidase is required for performing the reactions if miscible solvents are not employed. Furthermore, water-soluble polymers may be desirable for many applications.
TI  - Design of new promoters and of a dual-bioreporter based on cross-activation by the two regulatory proteins XylR and HbpR.
AB  - The HbpR protein is the sigma54-dependent transcription activator for 2-hydroxybiphenyl degradation in Pseudomonas azelaica. The ability of HbpR and XylR, which share 35% amino acid sequence identity, to cross-activate the PhbpC and Pu promoters was investigated by determining HbpR- or XylR-mediated luciferase expression and by DNA binding assays. XylR measurably activated the PhbpC promoter in the presence of the effector m-xylene, both in Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida. HbpR weakly stimulated the Pu promoter in E. coli but not in P. azelaica. Poor HbpR-dependent activation from Pu was caused by a weak binding to the operator region. To create promoters efficiently activated by both regulators, the HbpR binding sites on PhbpC were gradually changed into the XylR binding sites of Pu by site-directed mutagenesis. Inducible luciferase expression from mutated promoters was tested in E. coli on a two plasmid system, and from mono copy gene fusions in P. azelaica and P. putida. Some mutants were efficiently activated by both HbpR and XylR, showing that promoters can be created which are permissive for both regulators. Others achieved a higher XylR-dependent transcription than from Pu itself. Mutants were also obtained which displayed a tenfold lower uninduced expression level by HbpR than the wild-type PhbpC, while keeping the same maximal induction level. On the basis of these results, a dual-responsive bioreporter strain of P. azelaica was created, containing both XylR and HbpR, and activating luciferase expression from the same single promoter independently with m-xylene and 2-hydroxybiphenyl.
TI  - ParB of Pseudomonas aeruginosa: interactions with its partner ParA and its target parS and specific effects on bacterial growth.
AB  - The par genes of Pseudomonas aeruginosa have been studied to increase the understanding of their mechanism of action and role in the bacterial cell. Key properties of the ParB protein have been identified and are associated with different parts of the protein. The ParB- ParB interaction domain was mapped in vivo and in vitro to the C-terminal 56 amino acids (aa); 7 aa at the C terminus play an important role. The dimerization domain of P. aeruginosa ParB is interchangeable with the dimerization domain of KorB from plasmid RK2 (IncP1 group). The C-terminal part of ParB is also involved in ParB-ParA interactions. Purified ParB binds specifically to DNA containing a putative parS sequence based on the consensus sequence found in the chromosomes of Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas putida, and Streptomyces coelicolor. The overproduction of ParB was shown to inhibit the function of genes placed near parS. This "silencing" was dependent on the parS sequence and its orientation. The overproduction of P. aeruginosa ParB or its N-terminal part also causes inhibition of the growth of P. aeruginosa and P. putida but not Escherichia coli cells. Since this inhibitory determinant is located well away from ParB segments required for dimerization or interaction with the ParA counterpart, this result may suggest a role for the N terminus of P. aeruginosa ParB in interactions with host cell components.
TI  - Functional and phylogenetic analysis of a plant-inducible oligoribonuclease (orn) gene from an indigenous Pseudomonas plasmid.
AB  - Application of a promoter-trapping strategy to identify plant-inducible genes carried on an indigenous Pseudomonas plasmid, pQBR103, revealed the presence of a putative oligoribonuclease (orn) gene that encodes a highly conserved 3' to 5' exoribonuclease specific for small oligoribonucleotides. The deduced amino acid sequence of the plasmid-derived orn (orn(pl)) showed three conserved motifs characteristic of Orn from both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Deletion of orn(pl) generated no observable phenotype, but inactivation of the chromosomal copy caused slow growth in Pseudomonas putida KT2440. This defect was fully restored by complementation with orn from Escherichia coli (orn(E.coli)). Plasmid-derived orn(pl) was capable of partially complementing the P. putida orn mutant, demonstrating functionality of orn(pl). Phylogenetic analysis showed that plasmid-encoded Orn was distinct from Orn encoded by the chromosome of proteobacteria. A survey of orn(pl) from related Pseudomonas plasmids showed a sporadic distribution but no sequence diversity. These data suggest that the orn(pl) was acquired by pQBR103 in a single gene-transfer event: the donor is unknown, but is unlikely to be a member of the Proteobacteria.
TI  - Cell density-dependent gene contributes to efficient seed colonization by Pseudomonas putida KT2440.
AB  - We have characterized the expression pattern of a gene, ddcA, involved in initial colonization of corn seeds by Pseudomonas putida KT2440. The ddcA gene codes for a putative membrane polypeptide belonging to a family of conserved proteins of unknown function. Members of this family are widespread among prokaryotes and include the products of a Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium gene expressed during invasion of macrophages and psiE, an Escherichia coli phosphate starvation-inducible gene. Although its specific role is undetermined, the presence of ddcA in multicopy restored the seed adhesion capacity of a KT2440 ddcA mutant. Expression of ddcA is growth phase regulated, being maximal at the beginning of stationary phase. It is independent of RpoS, nutrient depletion, or phosphate starvation, and it is not the result of changes in the medium pH during growth. Expression of ddcA is directly dependent on cell density, being also stimulated by the addition of conditioned medium and of seed exudates. This is the first evidence suggesting the existence of a quorum-sensing system in P. putida KT2440. The potential implication of such a signaling process in seed adhesion and colonization by the bacterium is discussed.
TI  - Catechol 2,3-dioxygenase from Pseudomonas sp. strain ND6: gene sequence and enzyme characterization.
AB  - The catechol 2,3-dioxygenase (C23O) gene in naphthalene catabolic plasmid pND6-1  of Pseudomonas sp. ND6 was cloned and sequenced. The C23O gene was consisted of 924 nucleotides and encoded a polypeptide of molecular weight 36 kDa containing 307 amino acid residues. The C23O of Pseudomonas sp. ND6 exhibited 93% and 89% identities in amino acid sequence with C23Os encoded by naphthalene catabolic plasmid NAH7 from Pseudomonas putida G7 and the chromosome of Pseudomonas stutzeri AN10 respectively. The Pseudomonas sp. ND6 C23O gene was overexpressed in Escherichia coli DH 5alpha using the lac promoter of pUC18, and its gene product was purified by DEAE-Sephacel and Phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B chromatography. The enzymology experiments indicated that the specific activity and thermostability of C23O from Pseudomonas sp. ND6 were better than those of C23O from Pseudomonas putida G7.
TI  - Cloning and expression of afpA, a gene encoding an antifreeze protein from the arctic plant growth-promoting rhizobacterium Pseudomonas putida GR12-2.
AB  - The Arctic plant growth-promoting rhizobacterium Pseudomonas putida GR12-2 secretes an antifreeze protein (AFP) that promotes survival at subzero temperatures. The AFP is unusual in that it also exhibits a low level of ice nucleation activity. A DNA fragment with an open reading frame encoding 473 amino acids was cloned by PCR and inverse PCR using primers designed from partial amino acid sequences of the isolated AFP. The predicted gene product, AfpA, had a molecular mass of 47.3 kDa, a pI of 3.51, and no previously known function. Although AfpA is a secreted protein, it lacked an N-terminal signal peptide and was shown by sequence analysis to have two possible secretion systems: a hemolysin-like, calcium-binding secretion domain and a type V autotransporter domain found in gram-negative bacteria. Expression of afpA in Escherichia coli yielded an intracellular 72-kDa protein modified with both sugars and lipids that exhibited lower levels of antifreeze and ice nucleation activities than the native protein. The 164-kDa AFP previously purified from P. putida GR12-2 was a lipoglycoprotein, and the carbohydrate was required for ice nucleation activity. Therefore, the recombinant protein may not have been properly posttranslationally modified. The AfpA sequence was most similar to cell wall-associated proteins and less similar to ice nucleation proteins (INPs). Hydropathy plots revealed that the amino acid sequence of AfpA was more hydrophobic than those of the INPs in the domain that forms the ice template, thus suggesting that AFPs and INPs interact differently with ice. To our knowledge, this is the first gene encoding a protein with both antifreeze and ice nucleation activities to be isolated and characterized.

TI  - Crystallization and preliminary diffraction studies of morphinone reductase, a flavoprotein involved in the degradation of morphine alkaloids.
AB  - Morphinone reductase from Pseudomonas putida M10, a flavoprotein involved in the  degradation of morphine alkaloids, was purified from an overexpressing strain of Escherichia coli and crystallized using the hanging-drop vapour-diffusion method. Diffraction data were collected to 2.5 A. The I-centred orthorhombic cell has a monomer in the asymmetric unit. Preliminary molecular replacement calculations have been performed using Old Yellow Enzyme as the search model.
TI  - Effect of oxygen limitation and medium composition on Escherichia coli fermentation in shake-flask cultures.
AB  - Shake-flask cultures are widely used for screening of high producing strains. To  select suitable strains for production scale, cultivation parameters should be applied that provide optimal growth conditions. A novel method of measuring respiratory activity in shake-flask cultures was employed to analyze Escherichia coli fermentation under laboratory conditions. Our results suggest that the length of fermentation, choice of medium, and aeration do not normally satisfy the requirements for unlimited growth in shake flasks. Using glycerol rather than glucose as a carbon source greatly reduced the accumulation of overflow and fermentative metabolites when oxygen supply was unlimited. A rich buffered medium, Terrific Broth (TB), yielded 5 times more biomass compared to LB medium but also caused oxygen limitation in standard shake-flask cultures at shaking frequencies below 400 rpm. These results were used to optimize the production of benzoylformate decarboxylase from Pseudomonas putida in E. coli SG13009, resulting in a 10-fold increase in volumetric enzyme production. This example demonstrates how variation of medium composition and oxygen supply can be evaluated by the measurement of the respiratory activity. This can help to efficiently optimize screening conditions for E. coli.
TI  - Polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) accumulation in sulfate-reducing bacteria and identification of a class III PHA synthase (PhaEC) in Desulfococcus multivorans.
AB  - Seven strains of sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) were tested for the accumulation of polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs). During growth with benzoate Desulfonema magnum accumulated large amounts of poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) [poly(3HB)]. Desulfosarcina variabilis (during growth with benzoate), Desulfobotulus sapovorans (during growth with caproate), and Desulfobacterium autotrophicum (during growth with caproate) accumulated poly(3HB) that accounted for 20 to 43% of cell dry matter. Desulfobotulus sapovorans and Desulfobacterium autotrophicum also synthesized copolyesters consisting of 3-hydroxybutyrate and 3-hydroxyvalerate when valerate was used as the growth substrate. Desulfovibrio vulgaris and Desulfotalea psychrophila were the only SRB tested in which PHAs were not detected. When total DNA isolated from Desulfococcus multivorans and specific primers deduced from highly conserved regions of known PHA synthases (PhaC) were used, a PCR product homologous to the central region of class III PHA synthases was obtained. The complete pha locus of Desulfococcus multivorans was subsequently obtained by inverse PCR, and it contained adjacent phaE(Dm) and phaC(Dm) genes. PhaC(Dm) and PhaE(Dm) were composed of 371 and 306 amino acid residues and showed up to 49 or 23% amino acid identity to the corresponding subunits of other class III PHA synthases. Constructs of phaC(Dm) alone (pBBRMCS-2::phaC(Dm)) and of phaE(Dm)C(Dm) (pBBRMCS-2::phaE(Dm)C(Dm)) in various vectors were obtained and transferred to several strains of Escherichia coli, as well as to the PHA-negative mutants PHB(-)4 and GPp104 of Ralstonia eutropha and Pseudomonas putida, respectively. In cells of the recombinant strains harboring phaE(Dm)C(Dm) small but significant amounts (up to 1.7% of cell dry matter) of poly(3HB) and of PHA synthase activity (up to 1.5 U/mg protein) were detected. This indicated that the cloned genes encode functionally active proteins. Hybrid synthases consisting of PhaC(Dm) and PhaE of Thiococcus pfennigii or Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6308 were also constructed and were shown to be functionally active.
TI  - Distinct classes of glyoxalase I: metal specificity of the Yersinia pestis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Neisseria meningitidis enzymes.
AB  - The metalloisomerase glyoxalase I (GlxI) catalyses the conversion of methylglyoxal-glutathione hemithioacetal and related derivatives into the corresponding thioesters. In contrast with the previously characterized GlxI enzymes of Homo sapiens, Pseudomonas putida and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we recently determined that Escherichia coli GlxI surprisingly did not display Zn2+-activation, but instead exhibited maximal activity with Ni2+. To investigate whether non-Zn2+ activation defines a distinct, previously undocumented class of GlxI enzymes, or whether the E. coli GlxI is an exception to the previously established Zn2+-activated GlxI, we have cloned and characterized the bacterial GlxI from Yersinia pestis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Neisseria meningitidis. The metal-activation profiles for these additional GlxIs firmly establish the existence of a non-Zn2+-dependent grouping within the general category of GlxI enzymes. This second, established class of metal activation was formerly unidentified for this metalloenzyme. Amino acid sequence comparisons indicate a more extended peptide chain in the Zn2+-dependent forms of GlxI (H. sapiens, P. putida and S. cerevisiae), compared with the GlxI enzymes of E. coli, Y. pestis, P. aeruginosa and N. meningitidis. The longer sequence is due in part to the presence of additional regions situated fairly close to the metal ligands in the Zn2+-dependent forms of the lyase. With respect to sequence alignments, these inserts may potentially contribute to defining the metal specificity of GlxI at a structural level.
TI  - Mechanism of chromate reduction by the Escherichia coli protein, NfsA, and the role of different chromate reductases in minimizing oxidative stress during chromate reduction.
AB  - Chromate [Cr(VI)] is a serious environmental pollutant, which is amenable to bacterial bioremediation. NfsA, the major oxygen-insensitive nitroreductase of Escherichia coli, is a flavoprotein that is able to reduce chromate to less soluble and less toxic Cr(III). We show that this process involves single-electron transfer, giving rise to a flavin semiquinone form of NfsA and Cr(V) as intermediates, which redox cycle, generating more reactive oxygen species (ROS) than a divalent chromate reducer, YieF. However, NfsA generates less ROS than a known one-electron chromate reducer, lipoyl dehydrogenase (LpDH), suggesting that NfsA employs a mixture of uni- and di-valent electron transfer steps. The presence of YieF, ChrR (another chromate reductase we previously characterized), or NfsA in an LpDH-catalysed chromate reduction reaction decreased ROS generation by c. 65, 40, or 20%, respectively, suggesting that these enzymes can pre-empt ROS generation by LpDH. We previously showed that ChrR protects Pseudomonas putida against chromate toxicity; here we show that NfsA or YieF overproduction can also increase the tolerance of E. coli to this compound.
TI  - Identification of the Anabaena sp. strain PCC7120 cyanophycin synthetase as suitable enzyme for production of cyanophycin in gram-negative bacteria like Pseudomonas putida and Ralstonia eutropha.
AB  - The cyanophycin synthetase gene cphA1 encoding the major cyanophycin synthetase (CphA) of Anabaena sp. strain PCC7120 was expressed in Escherichia coli conferring so far the highest specific CphA activity to E. coli (6.7 nmol arginine per min and mg protein). CphA1 and cphA genes of Synechocystis sp. strains PCC6803 and PCC6308 and Synechococcus strain MA19 were also expressed in wild types and polyhydroxyalkanoate-negative (PHA) mutants of Pseudomonas putida and Ralstonia eutropha. Recombinant strains of these bacteria expressing cphA1 accumulated generally more cyanophycin (23.0 and 20.0% of cellular dry matter, CDM, respectively) than recombinants expressing any other cphA (6.8, 9.0, or 15.8% of CDM for P. putida strains and 7.3, 12.6, or 14.1% of CDM for R. eutropha). Furthermore, PHA-negative mutants of P. putida (9.7, 10.0, 17.5, or 24.0% of CDM) and R. eutropha (8.9, 13.8, 16.0, or 22.0% of CDM) accumulated generally more cyanophycin than the corresponding PHA-positive parent strains (6.8, 9.0, 15.8, and 23.0% of CDM for P. putida strains and 7.3, 12.6, 14.1, or 20.0% of CDM for R. eutropha strains). Recombinant strains of Gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus megaterium, Corynebacterium glutamicum) were not suitable for cyanophycin production due to accumulation of less cyanophycin and retarded release of cyanophycin. PHA-negative mutants of P. putida and R. eutropha expressing cphA1 of Anabaena sp. strain PCC7120 are therefore preferred candidates for industrial production of cyanophycin.
TI  - Detection of alkanes, alcohols, and aldehydes using bioluminescence.
AB  - We report a novel method for the rapid, sensitive, and quantitative detection of  alkanes, alcohols, and aldehydes that relies on the reaction of bacterial luciferase with an aldehyde, resulting in the emission of light. Primary alcohols with corresponding aldehydes that are within the substrate range of the particular luciferase are detected after conversion to the aldehyde by an alcohol dehydrogenase. In addition, alkanes themselves may be detected by conversion to primary alcohols by an alkane hydroxylase, followed by conversion to the aldehyde by alcohol dehydrogenase. We developed a rapid bioluminescent method by genetically engineering the genes encoding bacterial luciferase, alcohol dehydrogenase, and alkane hydroxylase into a plasmid for simultaneous expression in an E. coli host cell line. Alkanes, alcohols, or aldehydes were detected within seconds, with sensitivity in the micromolar range, by measuring the resulting light emission with a microplate reader. We demonstrate the application of this method for the detection of alkanes, alcohols, and aldehydes and for the detection of alkane hydroxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase activity in vivo. This method is amenable to the high-throughput screening needs required for the identification of novel catalysts.
TI  - Antimicrobial potential of immobilized Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis ATCC 11454 against selected bacteria.
AB  - Immobilization of living cells of lactic acid bacteria could be an alternative or complementary method of immobilizing organic acids and bacteriocins and inhibit undesirable bacteria in foods. This study evaluated the inhibition potential of immobilized Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis ATCC 11454 on selected bacteria by a modified method of the agar spot test. L. lactis was immobilized in calcium alginate (1 to 2%)-whey protein concentrate (0 and 1%) beads. The antimicrobial potential of immobilized L. lactis was evaluated in microbiological media against pathogenic bacteria (Escherichia coli, Salmonella, and Staphylococcus aureus) or Pseudomonas putida, a natural meat contaminant, and against seven gram-positive bacteria used as indicator strains. Results obtained in this study indicated that immobilized L. lactis inhibited the growth of S. aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus curvatus, Lactobacillus sakei, Kocuria varians, and Pediococcus acidilactici. Only 4 h of incubation at 35 degrees C resulted in a clear inhibition zone around the beads that increased with time. With the addition of 10 mM of a chelating agent (EDTA) to the media, results showed growth inhibition of E. coli; however, P. putida and Salmonella Typhi were unaffected by this treatment. These results indicate that immobilized lactic acid bacteria strains can be successfully used to produce nisin and inhibit bacterial growth in semisolid synthetic media.
TI  - Mandelamide hydrolase from Pseudomonas putida: characterization of a new member of the amidase signature family.
AB  - A recently discovered enzyme in the mandelate pathway of Pseudomonas putida, mandelamide hydrolase (MAH), catalyzes the hydrolysis of mandelamide to mandelic acid and ammonia. Sequence analysis suggests that MAH is a member of the amidase signature family, which is widespread in nature and contains a novel Ser-cis-Ser-Lys catalytic triad. Here we report the expression in Escherichia coli, purification, and characterization of both wild-type and His(6)-tagged MAH. The recombinant enzyme was stable, exhibited a pH optimum of 7.8, and was able to hydrolyze both enantiomers of mandelamide with little enantiospecificity. The His-tagged variant showed no significant change in kinetic constants. Phenylacetamide was found to be the best substrate, with changes in chain length or replacement of the phenyl group producing greatly decreased values of k(cat)/K(m). As with another member of this family, fatty acid amide hydrolase, MAH has the uncommon ability to hydrolyze esters and amides at similar rates. MAH is even more unusual in that it will only hydrolyze esters and amides with little steric bulk. Ethyl and larger esters and N-ethyl and larger amides are not substrates, suggesting that the MAH active site is very sterically hindered. Mutation of each residue in the putative catalytic triad to alanine resulted in total loss of activity for S204A and K100A, while S180A exhibited a 1500-fold decrease in k(cat) and significant increases in K(m) values. Overall, the MAH data are similar to those of fatty acid amide hydrolase and support the suggestion that there are two distinct subgroups within the amidase signature family.
TI  - Antimicrobial activities of eucalyptus leaf extracts and flavonoids from Eucalyptus maculata.
AB  - AIMS: We investigated the antimicrobial activities of eucalyptus leaf extracts to find effective antibacterial agents. METHODS AND RESULTS: The antimicrobial activities of leaf extracts from 26 species of eucalyptus were measured. Extracts of Eucalyptus globulus, E. maculata and E. viminalis significantly inhibited the growth of six Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, MRSA, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, Alicyclobacillus acidoterrestris, Propionibacterium acnes), and of a fungus (Trichophyton mentagrophytes), but they did not show strong antibacterial activity against Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas putida). 2',6'-dihydroxy-3'-methyl-4'-methoxy-dihydrochalcone, eucalyptin and 8-desmethyl-eucalyptin, isolated from E. maculata extracts, exhibited potent antimicrobial activities against seven micro-organisms with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) ranging from 1.0 to 31 mg l(-1). CONCLUSIONS: The eucalyptus extracts and three compounds from E. maculata were found to be effective against micro-organisms that cause food poisoning, acne and athlete's foot. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study shows potential uses of extracts from E. globulus, E. maculata and E. viminalis, and antimicrobial compounds isolated from E. maculata.
TI  - Mini-Tn7 transposons for site-specific tagging of bacteria with fluorescent proteins.
AB  - The mini-Tn7 transposon system is a convenient tool for site-specific tagging of  bacteria in which the tagging DNA is inserted at a unique and neutral chromosomal site. We have expanded the panel of mini-Tn7 delivery plasmids expressing different fluorescent proteins (stable and unstable) from the Escherichia coli lac derived promoter, P(A1/04/03), or from the growth-rate-dependent Escherichia coli promoter PrrnB P1. The mini-Tn7 transposons were inserted and tested in the soil bacterium, Pseudomonas putida KT2440. Successful and site-specific tagging was verified by Southern blots as well as by PCR. Furthermore, the effect of fluorescent protein expression on the cellular growth rate was tested by growth competition assays.
TI  - Characterization of Pseudomonas putida genes responsive to nutrient limitation.
AB  - The low bioavailability of nutrients and oxygen in the soil environment has hampered successful expression of biodegradation and biocontrol genes that are driven by promoters highly active during routine laboratory conditions of high availability of nutrients and oxygen. Hence, in the present study, expression of the gus-tagged genes in 12 Tn5-gus mutants of the soil microbe Pseudomonas putida PNL-MK25 were examined under various conditions chosen to mimic the soil environment: low carbon, phosphate, nitrate or oxygen, and in the rhizosphere. Based on their expression profiles, three nutrient-responsive mutant (NRM) strains, NRM5, NRM7 and NRM17, were selected for identification of the tagged genes. In strain NRM5, expression of the glutamate dehydrogenase (gdhA) gene was increased 4.9-26.4-fold under various low-nutrient conditions. In NRM7, expression of the novel NADPH : quinone oxidoreductase-like (nql) gene was consistently amongst the highest and was synergistically upregulated by low-nutrient and anoxic conditions. The cyoD gene in NRM17, which encodes the fourth subunit of the cytochrome o ubiquinol oxidase complex, had decreased expression in low-nutrient conditions but its absolute expression level was still amongst the highest. Additionally, it was independent of oxygen availability, in contrast to that in Escherichia coli.
TI  - Cytoplasmic membrane polarization in Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria grown in the absence and presence of tetracycline.
AB  - The ability of numerous diverse compounds and ions to cross the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane by diffusion and active transport is highly dependent on cytoplasmic membrane fluidity, which can be measured using fluorescent probes to estimate membrane polarization values. However, membrane polarization data are lacking for most bacterial species. The cytoplasmic membrane polarization values for Arthrobacter sp. ATCC 21908, Bacillus cereus NRC 3045, Pseudomonas fluorescens R2F, Pseudomonas putida NRC 2986 and Escherichia coli C600 bacterial cells were spectrofluorometrically measured over a temperature range from 10 to 50 degrees C, and in the absence and presence of 1 microg/ml tetracycline, using the fluorescent probe 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (DPH) to obtain new information on their membrane fluidity. At an assay temperature of 10 degrees C, E. coli cells grown in the absence of tetracycline exhibited the highest cytoplasmic membrane polarization value (least fluid membrane) of 0.446, followed by values of 0.392, 0.371, 0.344 and 0.293, respectively, for B. cereus, Arthrobacter sp., P. fluorescens and P. putida. At an assay temperature of 30 degrees C, the polarization values ranged from 0.357 to 0.288 for cells grown in the absence of tetracycline, regardless of the species. B. cereus grown in the presence of 1 microg/ml tetracycline had lower polarization values than when grown in the absence of this antibiotic at all assay temperatures. Regardless of the absence or presence of 1 microg/ml tetracycline in the growth medium, all bacterial species generally exhibited a more fluid membrane as the assay temperature increased from 10 to 50 degrees C. To our knowledge, these are some of the first cytoplasmic membrane polarization values reported for these Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria over a broad temperature range and also for cells grown in the presence of tetracycline.
TI  - Plastic encapsulation of stabilized Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida dried in hydroxyectoine or trehalose are  shown to be highly resistant to the organic solvents chloroform and acetone, and consequently, they can be encapsulated in a viable form in solid plastic materials. Bacteria are recovered by rehydration after physical disruption of the plastic. P. putida incorporated into a plastic coating of maize seeds was shown to colonize roots efficiently after germination.
TI  - Combined use of different Gfp reporters for monitoring single-cell activities of  a genetically modified PCB degrader in the rhizosphere of alfalfa.
AB  - Single-cell localization and activity of Pseudomonas fluorescens F113, colonizing alfalfa roots, were monitored using fusions of the Escherichia coli rrnBP1 ribosomal promoter and gfp genes encoding green fluorescent protein (Gfp) of different stability. The monitoring systems permitted non-destructive in situ detection of F113rifpcb cells on the entire root system grown in both the presence and absence of 3-chlorobiphenyl (PCB-2). The root tip and sites of lateral root emergence were found to be hotspots for fast-growing cells. In addition, a reporter strain of P. fluorescens F113rifpcb for degradation of chlorinated biphenyl was constructed, using another gfp fusion with the meta-pathway Pm promoter from Pseudomonas putida (TOL plasmid). Expression of this promoter, which is strongly induced by the PCB-2 degradation product, 3-chlorobenzoate, was tested in vitro and subsequently monitored in vivo on alfalfa roots using the P. fluorescens F113rifpcb reporter. A small but distinct fraction of the introduced bacteria activated the Pm promoter and thus appeared to sense a PCB-2 degradation product in the alfalfa rhizosphere. The degrading cells, which by design were identical to the sensing cells, were located in distinct microcolonies on the root surface or in intercellular crevices between the root epidermal cells. However, PCB-degrading cells were not observed in the root areas containing fast-growing cells, indicating that PCB degradation was not linked to high cellular activity.
TI  - Crystal structure of putidaredoxin reductase from Pseudomonas putida, the final structural component of the cytochrome P450cam monooxygenase.
AB  - The crystal structure of recombinant putidaredoxin reductase (Pdr), an FAD-containing NADH-dependent flavoprotein component of the cytochrome P450cam monooxygenase from Pseudomonas putida, has been determined to 1.90 A resolution. The protein has a fold similar to that of disulfide reductases and consists of the FAD-binding, NAD-binding, and C-terminal domains. Compared to homologous flavoenzymes, the reductase component of biphenyl dioxygenase (BphA4) and apoptosis-inducing factor, Pdr lacks one of the arginine residues that compensates partially for the negative charge on the pyrophosphate of FAD. This uncompensated negative charge is likely to decrease the electron-accepting ability of the flavin. The aromatic side-chain of the "gatekeeper" Tyr159 is in the "out" conformation and leaves the nicotinamide-binding site of Pdr completely open. The presence of electron density in the NAD-binding channel indicates that NAD originating from Escherichia coli is partially bound to Pdr. A structural comparison of Pdr with homologous flavoproteins indicates that an open and accessible nicotinamide-binding site, the presence of an acidic residue in the middle part of the NAD-binding channel that binds the nicotinamide ribose, and multiple positively charged arginine residues surrounding the entrance of the NAD-binding channel are the special structural elements that assist tighter and more specific binding of the oxidized pyridine nucleotide by the BphA4-like flavoproteins. The crystallographic model of Pdr explains differences in the electron transfer mechanism in the Pdr-putidaredoxin redox couple and their mammalian counterparts, adrenodoxin reductase and adrenodoxin.
TI  - Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus strains produce a novel major outer membrane protein during predacious growth in the periplasm of prey bacteria.
AB  - Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus is a predatory bacterium that is capable of invading a number of gram-negative bacteria. The life cycle of this predator can be divided into a nonreproductive phase outside the prey bacteria and a multiplication phase in their periplasm. It was suggested that during the reproduction phase, B. bacteriovorus reutilizes unmodified components of the prey's cell wall. We therefore examined the outer membranes of B. bacteriovorus strains HD100 (DSM 50701) and HD114 (DSM 50705) by using Escherichia coli, Yersinia enterocolitica, and Pseudomonas putida as prey organisms. The combined sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometric analyses revealed novel and innate major outer membrane proteins (OMPs) of B. bacteriovorus strains. An incorporation of prey-derived proteins into the cell wall of B. bacteriovorus was not observed. The corresponding genes of the B. bacteriovorus strains were elucidated by a reverse-genetics approach, and a leader peptide was deduced from the gene sequence and confirmed by Edman degradation. The host-independent mutant strain B. bacteriovorus HI100 (DSM 12732) growing in the absence of prey organisms possesses an OMP similar to the major OMPs of the host-dependent strains. The similarity of the primary structure of the OMPs produced by the three Bdellovibrio strains is between 67 and 89%. The leader peptides of all OMPs have a length of 20 amino acids and are highly conserved. The molecular sizes of the mature proteins range from 34.9 to 37.6 kDa. Secondary-structure predictions indicate preferential alpha-helices and little beta-barrel structures.
TI  - Genetically modified bacterial strains and novel bacterial artificial chromosome  shuttle vectors for constructing environmental libraries and detecting heterologous natural products in multiple expression hosts.
AB  - The enormous diversity of uncultured microorganisms in soil and other environments provides a potentially rich source of novel natural products, which is critically important for drug discovery efforts. Our investigators reported previously on the creation and screening of an Escherichia coli library containing soil DNA cloned and expressed in a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) vector. In that initial study, our group identified novel enzyme activities and a family of antibacterial small molecules encoded by soil DNA cloned and expressed in E. coli. To continue our pilot study of the utility and feasibility of this approach to natural product drug discovery, we have expanded our technology to include Streptomyces lividans and Pseudomonas putida as additional hosts with different expression capabilities, and herein we describe the tools we developed for transferring environmental libraries into all three expression hosts and screening for novel activities. These tools include derivatives of S. lividans that contain complete and unmarked deletions of the act and red endogenous pigment gene clusters, a derivative of P. putida that can accept environmental DNA vectors and integrate the heterologous DNA into the chromosome, and new BAC shuttle vectors for transferring large fragments of environmental DNA from E. coli to both S. lividans and P. putida by high-throughput conjugation. Finally, we used these tools to confirm that the three hosts have different expression capabilities for some known gene clusters.
TI  - A novel R-stereoselective amidase from Pseudomonas sp. MCI3434 acting on piperazine-2-tert-butylcarboxamide.
AB  - A novel amidase acting on (R,S)-piperazine-2-tert-butylcarboxamide was purified from Pseudomonas sp. MCI3434 and characterized. The enzyme acted R-stereoselectively on (R,S)-piperazine-2-tert-butylcarboxamide to yield (R)-piperazine-2-carboxylic acid, and was tentatively named R-amidase. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the enzyme showed high sequence identity with that deduced from a gene named PA3598 encoding a hypothetical hydrolase in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1. The gene encoding R-amidase was cloned from the genomic DNA of Pseudomonas sp. MCI3434 and sequenced. Analysis of 1332 bp of the genomic DNA revealed the presence of one open reading frame (ramA) which encodes the R-amidase. This enzyme, RamA, is composed of 274 amino acid residues (molecular mass, 30 128 Da), and the deduced amino acid sequence exhibits homology to a carbon-nitrogen hydrolase protein (PP3846) from Pseudomonas putida strain KT2440 (72.6% identity) and PA3598 protein from P. aeruginosa strain PAO1 (65.6% identity) and may be classified into a new subfamily in the carbon-nitrogen hydrolase family consisting of aliphatic amidase, beta-ureidopropionase, carbamylase, nitrilase, and so on. The amount of R-amidase in the supernatant of the sonicated cell-free extract of an Escherichia coli transformant overexpressing the ramA gene was about 30 000 times higher than that of Pseudomonas sp. MCI3434. The intact cells of the E. coli transformant could be used for the R-stereoselective hydrolysis of racemic piperazine-2-tert-butylcarboxamide. The recombinant enzyme was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity from cell-free extract of the E. coli transformant overexpressing the ramA gene. On gel-filtration chromatography, the enzyme appeared to be a monomer. It had maximal activity at 45 degrees C and pH 8.0, and was completely inactivated in the presence of p-chloromercuribenzoate, N-ethylmaleimide, Mn2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, Zn2+, Ag+, Cd2+, Hg2+, or Pb2+. RamA had hydrolyzing activity toward the carboxamide compounds, in which amino or imino group is connected to beta- or gamma-carbon, such as beta-alaninamide, (R)-piperazine-2-carboxamide (R)-piperidine-3-carboxamide, D-glutaminamide and (R)-piperazine-2-tert-butylcarboxamide. The enzyme, however, did not act on the other amide substrates for the aliphatic amidase despite its sequence similarity to RamA.
TI  - S-stereoselective piperazine-2-tert-butylcarboxamide hydrolase from Pseudomonas azotoformans IAM 1603 is a novel L-amino acid amidase.
AB  - An amidase acting on (R,S)-piperazine-2-tert-butylcarboxamide was purified from Pseudomonas azotoformans IAM 1603 and characterized. The enzyme acted S-stereoselectively on (R,S)-piperazine-2-tert-butylcarboxamide to yield (S)-piperazine-2-carboxylic acid. N-terminal and internal amino acid sequences of the enzyme were determined. The gene encoding the S-stereoselective piperazine-2-tert-butylcarboxamide amidase was cloned from the chromosomal DNA of the strain and sequenced. Analysis of 2.1 kb of genomic DNA revealed the presence of two ORFs, one of which (laaA) encodes the amidase. This enzyme, LaaA is composed of 310 amino acid residues (molecular mass 34 514 Da), and the deduced amino acid sequence exhibits significant similarity to hypothetical and functionally characterized proline iminopeptidases from several bacteria. The laaA gene modified in the nucleotide sequence upstream from its start codon was overexpressed in Escherichia coli. The activity of the recombinant LaaA enzyme in cell-free extracts of E. coli was 13.1 units.mg(-1) with l-prolinamide as substrate. This enzyme was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity by ammonium sulfate fractionation and two column chromatography steps. On gel-filtration chromatography, the enzyme appeared to be a monomer with a molecular mass of 32 kDa. It had maximal activity at 45 degrees C and pH 9.0, and was completely inactivated in the presence of phenylhydrazine, Zn2+, Ag+, Cd2+ or Hg2+. LaaA had hydrolyzing activity toward L-amino acid amides such as L-prolinamide, L-proline-p-nitroanilide, L-alaninamide and L-methioninamide, but did not act on the peptide substrates for the proline iminopeptidases despite their sequence similarity to LaaA. The enzyme also acted S-stereoselectively on (R,S)-piperidine-2-carboxamide, (R,S)-piperazine-2-carboxamide and (R,S)-piperazine-2-tert-butylcarboxamide. Based on its specificity towards L-amino acid amides, the enzyme was named L-amino acid amidase. E. coli transformants overexpressing the laaA gene could be used for the S-stereoselective hydrolysis of (R,S)-piperazine-2-tert-butylcarboxamide.
TI  - High survival and stability rates of Escherichia coli dried in hydroxyectoine.
AB  - The tetrahydropyramidine hydroxyectoine acts as an osmolyte in a range of bacterial species, but its use as a desiccation protectant is less well explored. Recently, it was demonstrated that hydroxyectoine provides effective stabilisation of the Gram-negative species Pseudomonas putida, which is only relatively poorly preserved by the better-characterised protectant, trehalose. It is now shown that hydroxyectoine also protects the paradigmatic bacterium, Escherichia coli: osmotically-preconditioned E. coli dried in hydroxyectoine exhibited a high degree of desiccation tolerance, similar to that achieved using trehalose in this species. Hydroxyectoine is apparently accumulated from hypersaline medium in preference to trehalose biosynthesis, but E. coli loaded with hydroxyectoine in this way showed reduced stability in the dry state. This suggests that, although both hydroxyectoine and trehalose perform equally well as extracellular protectants, trehalose is preferred for intracellular protection.
TI  - Ligand-induced conformational changes and a reaction intermediate in branched-chain 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase (E1) from Thermus thermophilus HB8, as revealed by X-ray crystallography.
AB  - The alpha(2)beta(2) tetrameric E1 component of the branched-chain 2-oxo acid (BCOA) dehydrogenase multienzyme complex is a thiamin diphosphate (ThDP)-dependent enzyme. E1 catalyzes the decarboxylation of a BCOA concomitant with the formation of the alpha-carbanion/enamine intermediate, 2-(1-hydroxyalkyl)-ThDP, followed by transfer of the 1-hydroxyalkyl group to the distal sulfur atom on the lipoamide of the E2 component. In order to elucidate the catalytic mechanism of E1, the alpha- and beta-subunits of E1 from Thermus thermophilus HB8 have been co-expressed in Escherichia coli, purified and crystallized as a stable complex, and the following crystal structures have been analyzed: the apoenzyme (E1(apo)), the holoenzyme (E1(holo)), E1(holo) in complex with the substrate analogue 4-methylpentanoate (MPA) as an ES complex model, and E1(holo) in complex with 4-methyl-2-oxopentanoate (MOPA) as the alpha-carbanion/enamine intermediate (E1(ceim)). Binding of cofactors to E1(apo) induces a disorder-order transition in two loops adjacent to the active site. Furthermore, upon binding of MPA to E1(holo), the loop comprised of Gly121beta-Gln131beta moves close to the active site and interacts with MPA. The carboxylate group of MPA is recognized mainly by Tyr86beta and N4' of ThDP. The hydrophobic moiety of MPA is recognized by Phe66alpha, Tyr95alpha, Met128alpha and His131alpha. As an intermediate, MOPA is decarboxylated and covalently linked to ThDP, and the conformation of the protein loop is almost the same as in the substrate-free (holoenzyme) form. These results suggest that E1 undergoes an open-closed conformational change upon formation of the ES complex with a BCOA, and the mobile region participates in the recognition of the carboxylate group of the BCOA. ES complex models of E1(holo).MOPA and of E1(ceim).lipoamide built from the above structures suggest that His273alpha and His129beta' are potential proton donors to the carbonyl group of a BCOA and to the proximal sulfur atom on the lipoamide, respectively.
TI  - Production of 3-hydroxydecanoic acid by recombinant Escherichia coli HB101 harboring phaG gene.
AB  - Heterogenous expression of (R)-3-hydroxydecanoyl-ACP:CoA transacylase gene (phaG) isolated from Pseudomonas putida in Escherichia coli HB101 led to the extracellular production of 3-hydroxydecanoic acid (3HD) in a growth medium consisting of carbon source non-related to 3HD structure, while no 3HD was detected in the growth media inoculated with wild type E. coli HB101 and recombinant E. coli HB101 harboring vector pBluescript SK- only. 3HD production by E. coli HB101 (pLZZGPp) harboring phaG from fructose was 587 mg/l, approximately three times that from cultivation in glucose under same culture conditions. 3HD production was affected by timing of fructose addition and fructose concentration in the culture. As an inhibitor of fatty acid de novo synthesis, the presence of triclosan in the culture could increase 3HD production by E. coli HB101 (pLZZGPp) by about 20-40%. The results further confirmed that (R)-3-hydroxydecanoyl-ACP:CoA transacylase (PhaG) provides 3HD precursors for medium-chain-length polyhydroxyalkanoate synthesis. At the same time, this phenomenon showed that recombinant organisms can be used for production of certain fine chemicals such as hydroxyalkanoic acids.
TI  - TbtABM, a multidrug efflux pump associated with tributyltin resistance in Pseudomonas stutzeri.
AB  - Tributyltin (TBT) is a toxic agent used in marine antifouling paints. Among the bacterial flora of a polluted harbor, TBT-resistant strains of Pseudomonas stutzeri have been isolated. In the strain 5MP1 (TBT minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) > or =1000 mg l(-1)), TBT resistance was found to be associated with the presence of the operon tbtABM, homologous to the resistance-nodulation-cell division (RND) efflux pump family, as demonstrated by cloning in Escherichia coli. TbtABM exhibited the greatest homology (60.9-84.9%) with the TtgDEF and SrpABC systems, both involved in aromatic compound tolerance in P. putida. TbtABM conferred multidrug resistance (MDR) including to n-hexane, nalidixic acid, chloramphenicol, and sulfamethoxazole (antibiotic MICsx4 for the E. coli host strain carrying the operon). By polymerase chain reaction amplification and hybridization experiments, the presence of tbtABM was detected in the TBT-sensitive P. stutzeri 3MP1 (TBT MIC 25 mg l(-1)). However, the latter strain did not seem to express TbtABM. This is the first description of a MDR efflux pump in P. stutzeri, and of a new kind of substrate, TBT, for the RND family of transporters.
TI  - Chromate-reducing properties of soluble flavoproteins from Pseudomonas putida and Escherichia coli.
AB  - Cr(VI) (chromate) is a toxic, soluble environmental contaminant. Bacteria can reduce chromate to the insoluble and less toxic Cr(III), and thus chromate bioremediation is of interest. Genetic and protein engineering of suitable enzymes can improve bacterial bioremediation. Many bacterial enzymes catalyze one-electron reduction of chromate, generating Cr(V), which redox cycles, generating excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS). Such enzymes are not appropriate for bioremediation, as they harm the bacteria and their primary end product is not Cr(III). In this work, the chromate reductase activities of two electrophoretically pure soluble bacterial flavoproteins--ChrR (from Pseudomonas putida) and YieF (from Escherichia coli)-were examined. Both are dimers and reduce chromate efficiently to Cr(III) (kcat/Km = approximately 2 x 10(4) M(-1) x s(-1)). The ChrR dimer generated a flavin semiquinone during chromate reduction and transferred >25% of the NADH electrons to ROS. However, the semiquinone was formed transiently and ROS diminished with time. Thus, ChrR probably generates Cr(V), but only transiently. Studies with mutants showed that ChrR protects against chromate toxicity; this is possibly because it preempts chromate reduction by the cellular one-electron reducers, thereby minimizing ROS generation. ChrR is thus a suitable enzyme for further studies. During chromate reduction by YieF, no flavin semiquinone was generated and only 25% of the NADH electrons were transferred to ROS. The YieF dimer may therefore be an obligatory four-electron chromate reducer which in one step transfers three electrons to chromate and one to molecular oxygen. As a mutant lacking this enzyme could not be obtained, the role of YieF in chromate protection could not be directly explored. The results nevertheless suggest that YieF may be an even more suitable candidate for further studies than ChrR.
TI  - Recombinant Escherichia coli for the biomonitoring of benzene and its derivatives in the air.
AB  - For protection against environmental deterioration, pollutants should be reduced  as much as possible. Therefore, a sensitive detection method for air pollutants is required, particularly for benzene, a compound with mutagenic, teratogenic, and carcinogenic properties. Some microorganisms have a number of enzymes that degrade organic compounds. The genetic information for many of these enzymes is codified in plasmids that usually comprise some elements such as proteins and RNA for their replication, and proteins for cell division control. Some plasmids have been obtained from Pseudomonas putida, a ubiquitous microorganism that is able to degrade biologic and inorganic compounds. P. putida contains the TOL plasmid, responsible for the degradation of benzene and its derivatives. The TOL plasmid has been fused with the gene for firefly luciferase (pTNS316 plasmid) to produce a luminescent bacterium (Escherichia coli HB101), which can be applied to the environmental monitoring of these chemicals. The recombinant E. coli transformed with the plasmid (E. coli HB101-pTNS316) was applied to the environmental biosensing of benzene and its derivatives. Measurement of bacteria-generated photons was done using a color-coded device to estimate quantitatively the pollutant concentration. The expression of luciferase was induced in the presence of aromatic compounds but the E. coli sensitivity has a detection limit: this bacterium dies if the benzene concentration is higher than 0.5 ppm and at this concentration the luminescence decreases so it is impossible to detect. Another limit for this biodevice is that the microorganism, very likely, accumulates the benzene and its derivatives, and therefore it is very important to consider the time of exposure. This biomonitor potentially offers a rapid, inexpensive, and sensitive technique for environmental detection of aromatic pollutant compounds.
TI  - Spectroelectrochemistry of cytochrome P450cam.
AB  - The spectroelectrochemistry of camphor-bound cytochrome P450cam (P450cam) using gold electrodes is described. The electrodes were modified with either 4,4(')-dithiodipyridin or sodium dithionite. Electrolysis of P450cam was carried out when the enzyme was in solution, while at the same time UV-visible absorption spectra were recorded. Reversible oxidation and reduction could be observed with both 4,4(')-dithiodipyridin and dithionite modified electrodes. A formal potential (E(0')) of -373mV vs Ag/AgCl 1M KCl was determined. The spectra of P450cam complexed with either carbon monoxide or metyrapone, both being inhibitors of P450 catalysis, clearly indicated that the protein retained its native state in the electrochemical cell during electrolysis.
TI  - Influence of polyphenols on bacterial biofilm formation and quorum-sensing.
AB  - Many bacteria utilize sophisticated regulatory systems to ensure that some functions are only expressed when a particular population density has been reached. The term 'quorum-sensing' has been coined to describe this form of density-dependent gene regulation which relies on the production and perception of small signal molecules by bacterial cells. As in many pathogenic bacteria the production of virulence factors is quorum-sensing regulated, it has been suggested that this form of gene regulation allows the bacteria to remain invisible to the defence systems of the host until the population is sufficiently large to successfully establish the infection. Here we present first evidence that polyphenolic compounds can interfere with bacterial quorum-sensing. Since polyphenols are widely distributed in the plant kingdom, they may be important for promoting plant fitness.
TI  - [Post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--II. Gram-negative bacteria].
AB  - As a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, monobactams, and penicillins. Changes in CZOP susceptibility among bacteria were also evaluated with the bacterial resistance ratio calculated from the breakpoint MIC. Twenty-five species (4,154 strains) of Gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2001, and consisted of Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, Serratia liquefaciens, Citrobacter freundii, Citrobacter koseri, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Pseudomonas putida, Acinetobacter baumannii, Acinetobacter Iwoffii, Burkholderia cepacia, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Bacteroides fragilis group, and Prevotella/Porphyromonas. CZOP preserved its antibacterial activity against M. (B.) catarrhalis (MIC90: 4 micrograms/mL) and showed comparable activity to carbapenems against H. influenzae (MIC90: 1 microgram/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. coli was preferable (MIC90: 0.125 microgram/mL) and comparable to those of cefpirome (CPR), cefepime (CFPM), and imipenem (IPM). The MIC90 of CZOP against K. pneumoniae and K. oxytoca was 1 and 0.25 microgram/mL, respectively. The MIC90 of CZOP against E. cloacae increased during 6 years (32 to 128 micrograms/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. aerogenes was preferable (MIC90: 1 microgram/mL). The antibacterial activities of CZOP against S. marcescens and S. liquefaciens were relatively potent (MIC90: 0.5 and 0.25 microgram/mL) and comparable to those of CPR, CFPM, and carumonam. CZOP preserved comparable antibacterial activity to CPR against C. freundii and C. koseri (MIC90: 8 and 0.125 micrograms/mL). The MIC90 of CZOP against P. mirabilis, P. vulgaris, and M. morganii was 0.25, 16, and 2 micrograms/mL, respectively. The antibacterial activity of CZOP against Providencia spp. was moderate (MIC90: 64 micrograms/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against P. aeruginosa was the most potent (MIC90: 16 micrograms/mL) among the test agents and comparable to those CFPM, IPM, and MEPM. CZOP had low activity against P. fluorescens and P. putida (MIC90: 128 micrograms/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against A. baumannii was comparable to those of ceftazidime (CAZ), CPR and CFPM (MIC90: 32 micrograms/mL) and against A. lwoffii was moderate (MIC90: 64 micrograms/mL). Most of the test agents including CZOP had low antibacterial activity against B. cepacia, S. maltophilia, and B. fragilis group. The MIC90 of CZOP against Prevotella/Porphyromonas was 64 micrograms/mL. Bacterial cross-resistance ratio between CZOP and other agents was low in most of the species, ranging from 0.0 to 15.1%. In non-glucose fermentative bacteria, however, the bacterial cross-resistance ratio between CZOP and CFPM, CAZ, CPR, or IPM was high, being 36.8%, 28.0%, 38.7%, or 31.1%, respectively. In conclusion, the 6-year duration study suggested that the antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. cloacae possible decreased, but against other Gram-negative bacteria was consistent with the study results obtained until the new drug application approval.
TI  - Novel physiological modulation of the Pu promoter of TOL plasmid: negative regulatory role of the TurA protein of Pseudomonas putida in the response to suboptimal growth temperatures.
AB  - From crude protein extracts of Pseudomonas putida KT2440, we identified a small protein, TurA, able to bind to DNA fragments bearing the entire Pu promoter sequence of the TOL plasmid. The knock-out inactivation of the turA gene resulted in enhanced transcription initiation from the Pu promoter, initially suggesting a negative regulatory role of TurA on Pu expression. Ectopic expression of TurA both in P. putida and in Escherichia coli reporter strains and transcription in vitro of the Pu promoter in the presence of purified TurA confirmed the TurA repressor role on Pu activity. turA gene inactivation did not significantly alter two well characterized physiological regulations of the Pu expression in routine conditions of cultivation, exponential silencing, and carbon-mediated repression, respectively. However, the growth at suboptimal temperatures resulted in a TurA-dependent increase of Pu repression. These results strongly suggest that a physiological significance of the negative role of TurA on Pu activity could be limitation of the expression of the toluene-degrading enzymes at suboptimal growth temperatures. Therefore, the identification of TurA as Pu-binding protein revealed a novel physiological modulation of Pu promoter that is different from those strictly nutritional described previously.
TI  - Characterization of a new solvent-responsive gene locus in Pseudomonas putida F1  and its functionalization as a versatile biosensor.
AB  - A new gene cluster, designated sepABC and a divergently transcribed sepR, was found downstream of the two-component todST phosphorelay system that regulates toluene degradation (the tod pathway) in Pseudomonas putida F1 (PpF1). The deduced amino acid sequences encoded by sepABC show a high homology to bacterial proteins known to be involved in solvent efflux or multidrug pumps. SepA, SepB and SepC are referred to be periplasmic, inner membrane and outer membrane efflux proteins respectively. Effects on growth of various PpF1 mutants compared to that of the wild type in the presence of toluene indicated a possible protective role of the solvent efflux system in a solvent-stressed environment. Growth tests with the complemented mutants confirmed the involvement of the Sep proteins in conferring solvent tolerance. The sepR gene encodes a 260-residue polypeptide that is a member of the E. coli IclR repressor protein family. The repressor role of SepR was established by conducting tests with a sep-lacZ transcriptional fusion in Escherichia coli and PpF1, expression of SepR as a maltose-binding fusion protein in a DNA binding assay, and mRNA analysis. Southern hybridization experiments and analysis of the P. putida KT2440 genome sequence indicated that sepR is a relatively rare commodity compared to homologues of the sepABC genes. We developed a whole-cell bioluminescent biosensor, PpF1G4, which contains a chromosomally based sep-lux transcriptional fusion. The biosensor showed significant induction of the sepABC genes by a wide variety of aromatic molecules, including benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and all three isomers of xylene (BTEX), naphthalene, and complex mixtures of aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons. PpF1G4 represents a second-generation biosensor that is not based on a catabolic promoter but is nonetheless inducible by aromatic pollutants and moreover functional under nutrient-rich conditions.
TI  - The sigma54 regulon (sigmulon) of Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - sigma54 is unique among the bacterial sigma factors. Besides not being related in sequence with the rest of such factors, its mechanism of transcription initiation is completely different and requires the participation of a transcription activator. In addition, whereas the rest of the alternative sigma factors use to be involved in transcription of somehow related biological functions, this is not the case for sigma54 and many different and unrelated genes have been shown to be transcribed from sigma54-dependent promoters, ranging from flagellation, to utilization of several different carbon and nitrogen sources, or alginate biosynthesis. These genes have been characterized in many different bacterial species and, only until recently with the arrival of complete genome sequences, we have been able to look at the sigma54 functional role from a genomic perspective. Aided by computational methods, the sigma54 regulon has been studied both in Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium and several species of the Rhizobiaceae. Here we present the analysis of the sigma54 regulon (sigmulon) in the complete genome of Pseudomonas putida KT2440. We have developed an improved method for the prediction of sigma54-dependent promoters which combines the scores of sigma54-RNAP target sequences and those of activator binding sites. In combination with other evidence obtained from the chromosomal context and the similarity with closely related bacteria, we have been able to predict more than 80% of the sigma54-dependent promoters of P. putida with high confidence. Our analysis has revealed new functions for sigma54 and, by means of comparative analysis with the previous studies, we have drawn a potential mechanism for the evolution of this regulatory system.
TI  - Protistan grazing analysis by flow cytometry using prey labeled by in vivo expression of fluorescent proteins.
AB  - Selective grazing by protists can profoundly influence bacterial community structure, and yet direct, quantitative observation of grazing selectivity has been difficult to achieve. In this investigation, flow cytometry was used to study grazing by the marine heterotrophic flagellate Paraphysomonas imperforata on live bacterial cells genetically modified to express the fluorescent protein markers green fluorescent protein (GFP) and red fluorescent protein (RFP). Broad-host-range plasmids were constructed that express fluorescent proteins in three bacterial prey species, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Pseudomonas putida. Micromonas pusilla, an alga with red autofluorescence, was also used as prey. Predator-prey interactions were quantified by using a FACScan flow cytometer and analyzed by using a Perl program described here. Grazing preference of P. imperforata was influenced by prey type, size, and condition. In competitive feeding trials, P. imperforata consumed algal prey at significantly lower rates than FP (fluorescent protein)-labeled bacteria of similar or different size. Within-species size selection was also observed, but only for P. putida, the largest prey species examined; smaller cells of P. putida were grazed preferentially. No significant difference in clearance rate was observed between GFP- and RFP-labeled strains of the same prey species or between wild-type and GFP-labeled strains. In contrast, the common chemical staining method, 5-(4,6-dichloro-triazin-2-yl)-amino fluorescein hydrochloride, depressed clearance rates for bacterial prey compared to unlabeled or RFP-labeled cells.
TI  - Cis-2', 3'-dihydrodiol production on flavone B-ring by biphenyl dioxygenase from  Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes KF707 expressed in Escherichia coli.
AB  - Escherichia coli JM109 strains expressing either toluene dioxygenase from Pseudomonas putida F1 or biphenyl dioxygenase from Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes KF707 were examined for their ability to catalyze flavones. Biphenyl dioxygenase produced metabolites from flavone and 5,7-dihydroxyflavone which were not found in the control experiments. The absorption maxima of UV-visible spectra for the metabolites from flavone and 5,7-dihydroxyflavone were found at 337 and 348 nm respectively by using a photodiode array detector in the HPLC. Liquid chromatography/mass spectroscopy (LC/MS) showed molecular weights 256 and 288 for the metabolites, respectively. The metabolite of flavone, which was isolated and purified from the bacterial culture, was further subjected to analysis by 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Based on the LC/MS and NMR results, biphenyl dioxygenase inserted oxygen at C2' and C3' on the B-ring of flavone, resulting in the formation of flavone cis-2', 3'-dihydrodiol (2-[3,4-dihydroxy-1.5-cyclohexadienyl]-4H-chromen-4-one). Since this product is not found in Chemical Abstracts, this compound is considered a novel one. In addition, biotransformation of flavones by biphenyl dioxygenase suggested a potential role of bacterial dioxygenase to synthesize novel compounds from plant secondary metabolites.
TI  - [Yearly changes in antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates between 1996 and 2001--II. Gram-negative bacteria].
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2001 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems and carbapenems. A total of 3,245 strains in 32 species of Gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from January to December, and consisted of Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, Citrobacter koseri, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabillis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia spp. (P. alcalifaciens, P. rettgeri, P. stuartii), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas putida, Burkholderia cepacia, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Haemophilus influenzae, Acinetobactor baumannii, Acinetobactor lwoffii, Bacteroides fragilis group (B. fragilis, B. vulgatus, B. distasonis, B. ovatus, B. thetaiotaomicron), and Prevotella spp. (P. melaninogenica, P. intermedia, P. bivia, P. oralis, P. denticola). CZOP possessed stable antibacterial activities against M. (B.) catarrhalis, E. coli, C. freundii, C. koseri, K. pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, E. aerogenes, E. cloacae, S. marcescens, P. mirabilis, P. vulgaris, M. morganii, Providencia spp., P. aeruginosa, and A. lwoffii throughout 6 years. The MIC90 of CZOP against those strains were consistent with those obtained from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. On the other hand, the MIC90 of CZOP against H. influenzae yearly obviously increased with approximately 64-time difference during the study period. The MIC90 of cefpirome, cefepime, and flomoxef against H. influenzae also yearly tended to rise. The present results demonstrated that CZOP had maintained the antibacterial activity against almost Gram-negative strains tested. However, the decrease in antibacterial activities of CZOP against B. cepacia, and H. influenzae was suggested.
TI  - Crystal structure of putidaredoxin, the [2Fe-2S] component of the P450cam monooxygenase system from Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - Stability of the [2Fe-2S]-containing putidaredoxin (Pdx), the electron donor to cytochrome P450cam in Pseudomonas putida, was improved by mutating non-ligating cysteine residues, Cys73 and Cys85, to serine singly and in combination. The increasing order of stability is Cys73Ser/Cys85Ser>Cys73Ser>Cys85Ser>WT Pdx. Crystal structures of Cys73Ser/Cys85Ser and Cys73Ser mutants of Pdx, solved by single-wavelength anomalous dispersion phasing using the [2Fe-2S] iron atoms to 1.47 A and 1.65 A resolution, respectively, are nearly identical and very similar to those of bovine adrenodoxin (Adx) and Escherichia coli ferredoxin. However, unlike the Adx structure, no motion between the core and interaction domains of Pdx is observed. This higher conformational stability of Pdx might be due to the presence of a more extensive hydrogen bonding network at the interface between the two structural domains around the conserved His49. In particular, formation of a hydrogen bond between the side-chain of Tyr51 and the carbonyl oxygen atom of Glu77 and the presence of two well-ordered water molecules linking the interaction domain and the C-terminal peptide to the core of the molecule are unique to Pdx. The folding topology of the NMR model is similar to that of the X-ray structure of Pdx. The overall rmsd of Calpha positions between the two models is 1.59 A. The largest positional differences are observed for residues 18-21 and 33-37 in the loop regions and the C terminus. The latter two peptides display conformational heterogeneity in the crystal structures. Owing to flexibility, the aromatic ring of the C-terminal Trp106 can closely approach the side-chains of Asp38 and Thr47 (3.2-3.9 A) or move away and leave the active site solvent-exposed. Therefore, Trp106, previously shown to be important in the Pdr-to-Pdx and Pdx-to-P450cam electron transfer reactions is in a position to regulate and/or mediate electron transfer to or from the [2Fe-2S] center of Pdx.
TI  - Cell surface display of organophosphorus hydrolase in Pseudomonas putida using an ice-nucleation protein anchor.
AB  - A surface anchor system derived from the ice-nucleation protein (INP) from Pseudomonas syringe was used to localize organophosphorus hydrolase (OPH) onto the surface of Pseudomonas putida KT2440. Cells harboring the shuttle vector pPNCO33 coding for the INP-OPH fusion were capable of targeting OPH onto the cell surface as demonstrated by whole cell ELISA. The whole cell activity of P. putida KT2440 was shown to be 10 times higher than those of previous efforts expressing the same fusion protein in Escherichia coli. The capability of expressing enzymes on the surface of a robust and environmentally benign P. putida KT2440 should open up new avenues for a wide range of applications such as in situ bioremediation.
TI  - Direct detection and quantification of horizontal gene transfer by using flow cytometry and gfp as a reporter gene.
AB  - A new cultivation-independent method for studying conjugal gene transfer between  bacteria was evaluated. The method was based on direct detection and enumeration of donor and transconjugant bacterial cells by flow cytometry. Specific detection of transconjugants was obtained by using a conjugative plasmid tagged with a reporter gene (gfp) encoding green fluorescent protein. A chromosomal encoded repressor (lacI(ql)) repressed expression of GFP in the donor bacteria. Enumeration of the donor cells was performed after induction of GFP expression by the addition of inducer isopropyl-thio-beta-D-galactoside (IPTG). The method presented here provided simple and precise quantification of horizontal gene transfer between both Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida strains.
TI  - Catalytic mechanism of dichloromethane dehalogenase from Methylophilus sp. strain DM11.
AB  - The glutathione (GSH)-dependent dichloromethane dehalogenase from Methylophilus sp. strain DM11 catalyzes the dechlorination of CH(2)Cl(2) to formaldehyde via a highly reactive, genotoxic intermediate, S-(chloromethyl)glutathione (GS-CH(2)Cl). The catalytic mechanism of the enzyme toward a series of dihalomethane and monohaloethane substrates suggests that the initial addition of GSH to the alkylhalides is fast and that the rate-limiting step in turnover is the release of either the peptide product or formaldehyde. With the exception of CH(2)ClF, which forms a relatively stable GS-CH(2)F intermediate, the turnover numbers for a series of dihalomethanes fall in a very narrow range (1-3 s(-1)). The pre-steady-state kinetics of the DM11-catalyzed addition of GSH to CH(3)CH(2)Br exhibits a burst of S-(ethyl)-glutathione (k(b) = 96 +/- 56 s(-1)) followed by a steady state with k(cat) = 0.13 +/- 0.01 s(-1). The turnover numbers for CH(3)CH(2)Cl, CH(3)CH(2)Br, and CH(3)CH(2)I are identical, indicating a common rate-limiting step. The turnover numbers of the enzyme with CH(3)CH(2)Br and CH(3)CH(2)I are dependent on viscosity and are very close to the measured off-rate of GSEt. The turnover number with CH(2)I(2) is also dependent on viscosity, suggesting that a diffusive step is rate-limiting with dihaloalkanes as well. The rate constants for solvolysis of CH(3)SCH(2)Cl, a model for GS-CH(2)Cl, range between 1 s(-1) (1:1 dioxane/water) and 64 s(-1) (1:10 dioxane/water). Solvolysis of the S-(halomethyl)glutathione intermediates may also occur in the active site of the enzyme preventing the release of the genotoxic species. Together, the results indicate that dissociation of the GS-CH(2)X or GS-CH(2)OH intermediates from the enzyme may be a relatively rare event.
TI  - Photon correlation spectroscopy investigations of proteins.
AB  - Physical principles of photon correlation spectroscopy (PCS), mathematical treatment of the PCS data (converting autocorrelation functions to distribution functions or average characteristics), and PCS applications to study proteins and other biomacromolecules in aqueous media are described and analysed. The PCS investigations of conformational changes in protein molecules, their aggregation itself or in consequence of interaction with other molecules or organic (polymers) and inorganic (e.g. fumed silica) fine particles as well as the influence of low molecular compounds (surfactants, drugs, salts, metal ions, etc.) reveal unique capability of the PCS techniques for elucidation of important native functions of proteins and other biomacromolecules (DNA, RNA, etc.) or microorganisms (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas putida, Dunaliella viridis, etc.). Special attention is paid to the interaction of proteins with fumed oxides and the impact of polymers and fine oxide particles on the motion of living flagellar microorganisms analysed by means of PCS.
TI  - A specific region in the N terminus of a replication initiation protein of plasmid RK2 is required for recruitment of Pseudomonas aeruginosa DnaB helicase to the plasmid origin.
AB  - Broad host range plasmid RK2 encodes two versions of its essential replication initiation protein, TrfA, using in-frame translational starts spaced 97 amino acids apart. The smaller protein, TrfA-33, is sufficient for plasmid replication in many bacterial hosts. Efficient replication in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, however, specifically requires the larger TrfA-44 protein. With the aim of identifying sequences of TrfA-44 required for stable replication of RK2 in P. aeruginosa, specific deletions and a substitution mutant within the N terminus sequence unique to TrfA-44 were constructed, and the mutant proteins were tested for activity. Deletion mutants were targeted to three of the four predicted helical regions in the first 97 amino acids of TrfA-44. Deletion of TrfA-44 amino acids 21-32 yielded a mutant protein, TrfA-44Delta2, that had lost the ability to bind and load the DnaB helicase of P. aeruginosa or Pseudomonas putida onto the RK2 origin in vitro and did not support stable replication of an RK2 mini-replicon in P. aeruginosa in vivo. A substitution of amino acid 22 within this essential region resulted in a protein, TrfA-44E22A, with reduced activity in vitro, particularly with the P. putida helicase. Deletion of amino acids 37-55 (TrfA-44Delta3) slightly affected protein activity in vitro with the P. aeruginosa helicase and significantly with the P. putida helicase, whereas deletion of amino acids 71-88 (TrfA-44Delta4) had no effect on TrfA activity in vitro with either helicase. These results identify regions of the TrfA-44 protein that are required for recruitment of the Pseudomonas DnaB helicases in the initiation of RK2 replication.
TI  - Genetic characterization of a novel metallo-beta-lactamase gene, blaIMP-13, harboured by a novel Tn5051-type transposon disseminating carbapenemase genes in Europe: report from the SENTRY worldwide antimicrobial surveillance programme.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: In 2001, as part of the SENTRY worldwide antimicrobial surveillance programme, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 86-14571A was isolated at a hospital in Rome from a cancer patient with a bloodstream infection. The isolate was resistant to all antibiotics except amikacin, and displayed an imipenem MIC of 64 mg/L that decreased to 8 mg/L in the presence of EDTA. The resistance determinant was investigated. METHODS: The resistant determinant was cloned in Escherichia coli using a shotgun cloning approach. RESULTS: Sequence analysis revealed the presence of a novel IMP-type metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL) gene, blaIMP-13. This encoded a protein displaying most identity to IMP variants: 93% and 92.3% identity, respectively, to IMP-8 and IMP-2 (previously identified in Italy). The protein had 19 amino acid changes from IMP-2 and 17 amino acid changes from IMP-8. The blaIMP-13 gene was found as a gene cassette in the first position of a class 1 integron. A 25 bp inverted repeat sequence IRi was identified 174 bp upstream of the class I integrase, which suggests that the integron is found on a Tn402-like transposon, or defective transposon derivative. This element, in turn, is located in the transposition locus (tnp region) of a Tn21 subfamily transposon that showed most identity to Tn5051, a transposon recently identified from a strain of Pseudomonas putida isolated in New York. Interestingly, the insertion point of the Tn402-like transposon and the sequence of the Tn5051-like genes were identical to those of the genetic element harbouring blaVIM-2 recently identified in Poland. CONCLUSIONS: The resistance determinant of P. aeruginosa 86-14571A is a novel IMP-type MBL carried on a composite transposon responsible for wide geographical dissemination of MBL genes in Europe.
TI  - Characterization of hybrid toluate and benzoate dioxygenases.
AB  - Toluate dioxygenase of Pseudomonas putida mt-2 (TADO(mt2)) and benzoate dioxygenase of Acinetobacter calcoaceticus ADP1 (BADO(ADP1)) catalyze the 1,2-dihydroxylation of different ranges of benzoates. The catalytic component of these enzymes is an oxygenase consisting of two subunits. To investigate the structural determinants of substrate specificity in these ring-hydroxylating dioxygenases, hybrid oxygenases consisting of the alpha subunit of one enzyme and the beta subunit of the other were prepared, and their respective specificities were compared to those of the parent enzymes. Reconstituted BADO(ADP1) utilized four of the seven tested benzoates in the following order of apparent specificity: benzoate > 3-methylbenzoate > 3-chlorobenzoate > 2-methylbenzoate. This is a significantly narrower apparent specificity than for TADO(mt2) (3-methylbenzoate > benzoate approximately 3-chlorobenzoate > 4-methylbenzoate approximately 4-chlorobenzoate >> 2-methylbenzoate approximately 2-chlorobenzoate [Y. Ge, F. H. Vaillancourt, N. Y. Agar, and L. D. Eltis, J. Bacteriol. 184:4096-4103, 2002]). The apparent substrate specificity of the alphaBbetaT hybrid oxygenase for these benzoates corresponded to that of BADO(ADP1), the parent from which the alpha subunit originated. In contrast, the apparent substrate specificity of the alphaTbetaB hybrid oxygenase differed slightly from that of TADO(mt2) (3-chlorobenzoate > 3-methylbenzoate > benzoate approximately 4-methylbenzoate > 4-chlorobenzoate > 2-methylbenzoate > 2-chlorobenzoate). Moreover, the alphaTbetaB hybrid catalyzed the 1,6-dihydroxylation of 2-methylbenzoate, not the 1,2-dihydroxylation catalyzed by the TADO(mt2) parent. Finally, the turnover of this ortho-substituted benzoate was much better coupled to O2 utilization in the hybrid than in the parent. Overall, these results support the notion that the alpha subunit harbors the principal determinants of specificity in ring-hydroxylating dioxygenases. However, they also demonstrate that the beta subunit contributes significantly to the enzyme's function.
TI  - Analysis of whole bacterial cells by flow field-flow fractionation and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry.
AB  - The purpose of this study is to develop a novel bacterial analysis method by coupling the flow field-flow fractionation (flow FFF) separation technique with detection by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry. The composition of carrier liquid used for flow FFF was selected based on retention of bacterial cells and compatibility with the MALDI process. The coupling of flow FFF and MALDI-TOF MS was demonstrated for P. putida and E. coli. Fractions of the whole cells were collected after separation by FFF and further analyzed by MALDI-MS. Each fraction, collected over different time intervals, corresponded to different sizes and possibly different growth stages of bacteria. The bacterial analysis by flow FFF/MALDI-TOF MS was completed within 1 h with only preliminary optimization of the process.
TI  - Polynucleotide phosphorylase-deficient mutants of Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - In bacteria, polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase) is one of the main exonucleolytic activities involved in RNA turnover and is widely conserved. In spite of this, PNPase does not seem to be essential for growth if the organisms are not subjected to special conditions, such as low temperature. We identified the PNPase-encoding gene (pnp) of Pseudomonas putida and constructed deletion mutants that did not exhibit cold sensitivity. In addition, we found that the transcription pattern of pnp upon cold shock in P. putida was markedly different from that in Escherichia coli. It thus appears that pnp expression control and the physiological roles in the cold may be different in different bacterial species.
TI  - A cytochrome c from a lupanine-transforming Pseudomonas putida strain is expressed in Escherichia coli during aerobic cultivation and efficiently exported and assembled in the periplasm.
AB  - We have cloned, sequenced, and heterologously expressed a periplasmic cytochrome  c from a lupanine-utilizing Pseudomonas putida strain. Aerobic batch cultivation of Escherichia coli TB1 harboring the cytochrome c gene placed downstream of the lac promoter in pUC9 vector resulted in significant production of the holo-cytochrome c in the periplasm ( approximately 4 mg of hemoprotein/liter of culture). The recombinant cytochrome c was purified to homogeneity and was found to be functional in accepting electrons from lupanine hydroxylase while catalyzing hydroxylation of lupanine. Comparison of the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the isolated cytochrome c with that deduced from the DNA sequence indicated that the signal sequence was processed at the bond position predicted by the SigPep program. The molecular size of the cytochrome c determined by electrospray mass spectrometry (9,595) was in precise agreement with that predicted from the nucleotide sequence.
TI  - Role of Pseudomonas putida tol-oprL gene products in uptake of solutes through the cytoplasmic membrane.
AB  - Proteins of the Tol-Pal (Tol-OprL) system play a key role in the maintenance of outer membrane integrity and cell morphology in gram-negative bacteria. Here we describe an additional role for this system in the transport of various carbon sources across the cytoplasmic membrane. Growth of Pseudomonas putida tol-oprL mutant strains in minimal medium with glycerol, fructose, or arginine was impaired, and the growth rate with succinate, proline, or sucrose as the carbon source was lower than the growth rate of the parental strain. Assays with radiolabeled substrates revealed that the rates of uptake of these compounds by mutant cells were lower than the rates of uptake by the wild-type strain. The pattern and amount of outer membrane protein in the P. putida tol-oprL mutants were not changed, suggesting that the transport defect was not in the outer membrane. Consistently, the uptake of radiolabeled glucose and glycerol in spheroplasts was defective in the P. putida tol-oprL mutant strains, suggesting that there was a defect at the cytoplasmic membrane level. Generation of a proton motive force appeared to be unaffected in these mutants. To rule out the possibility that the uptake defect was due to a lack of specific transporter proteins, the PutP symporter was overproduced, but this overproduction did not enhance proline uptake in the tol-oprL mutants. These results suggest that the Tol-OprL system is necessary for appropriate functioning of certain uptake systems at the level of the cytoplasmic membrane.
TI  - A new variant activator involved in the degradation of phenolic compounds from a  strain of Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - A new variant type of regulatory activator and relevant promoters (designated capR, Pr and Po) involved in the metabolism of phenolic compounds were cloned from Pseudomonas putida KCTC1452 by using PCR. The deduced amino acid sequence of CapR revealed a difference in nine amino acids from the effector binding domain of DmpR. To measure effector specificity, plasmids were constructed in such a way that the expression of luc gene for firefly luciferase or lacZ for beta-galactosidase as a reporter was under the control of capR. When Escherichia coli transformed with the plasmids was exposed to phenol, dramatic increases in the activity of luciferase or beta-galactosidase were observed in a range of 0.01-1 mM. Among various phenolic compounds tested, other effective compounds included catechol, 2-methylphenol, 3-methylphenol, 4-methylphenol, 2-chlorophenol, 4-chlorophenol, 2-nitrophenol, resorcinol, and 2, 5-dimethylphenol. The results indicate that CapR has effector specificity different from other related activators, CatR and DmpR. Waste water and soil potentially containing phenolic compounds were also tested by this system and the results were compared with chemical and GC data. The present results indicate that the biosensor consisting of capR and the promoters may be utilized for the development of a phenolic compounds-specific biosensor in monitoring the environmental pollutant.
TI  - Co-operative interactions control conjugative transfer of broad host-range plasmid RK2: full effect of minor changes in TrbA operator depends on KorB.
AB  - A network of circuits, with KorB and TrbA as key regulators, controls genes for conjugative transfer of broad host range plasmid RK2. To assess the importance of the TrbA regulon, mutational analysis was applied to the TrbA operator at the trbB promoter and then to other TrbA-regulated promoters in the tra region. All identified TrbA operators are submaximal; in the case of trbBp, a G to A transition that made the operator core a perfect palindrome increased repression by about 50% compared to the wild type. When this change was introduced into the RK2 genome, decreases in transfer frequency of up to three orders of magnitude were observed, with bigger effects when Escherichia coli was the donor compared to Pseudomonas putida. Western blotting showed a significant decrease in Trb protein levels. These effects were much greater than the effect of the mutation on repression by TrbA alone. When KorB was introduced into the reporter system, the effects were closer to those observed in the whole RK2 context. These results indicate that co-operativity, previously observed between TrbA and KorB, allows big changes in transfer gene expression to result from small changes in individual regulator activities.
TI  - Structure of 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate (KDPG) aldolase from Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - 2-Keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate (KDPG) aldolase from Pseudomonas putida is a key enzyme in the Entner-Doudoroff pathway which catalyses the cleavage of KDPG via a class I Schiff-base mechanism. The crystal structure of this enzyme has been refined to a crystallographic residual R = 17.1% (R(free) = 21.4%). The N-terminal helix caps one side of the torus of the (betaalpha)(8)-barrel and the active site is located on the opposite, carboxylic side of the barrel. The Schiff-base-forming Lys145 is coordinated by a sulfate (or phosphate) ion and two solvent water molecules. The interactions that stabilize the trimer are predominantly hydrophobic, with the exception of the cyclically permuted bonds formed between Glu132 OE1 of one molecule and Thr129 OG1 of a symmetry-equivalent molecule. Except for the N-terminal helix, the structure of KDPG aldolase from P. putida closely resembles the structure of the homologous enzyme from Escherichia coli.
TI  - A multifunctional plasmid-encoded replication initiation protein both recruits and positions an active helicase at the replication origin.
AB  - The DnaA replication initiation protein has been shown to be essential for DNA strand opening at the AT-rich region of the replication origin of the Escherichia coli chromosome as well as serving to recruit and position the DnaB replicative helicase at this open region. Homologues of the dnaA gene of E. coli have been found in most bacterial species, and the DnaA protein has been shown to be required for the initiation of replication of both chromosomal and plasmid DNA. For several plasmid elements it has been found that a plasmid-encoded initiation protein is required along with the DnaA protein to bring about opening of the AT-rich region at the replication origin. The broad host range plasmid RK2 encodes two forms of its replication initiation protein (TrfA-33 and TrfA-44) that differ by an additional 98 aa at the N terminus of the larger (TrfA-44) form. Both forms initiate replication of RK2 in E. coli in vitro by a DnaA-dependent mechanism. However, as shown in this study, TrfA-44 specifically interacts with the DnaB replicative helicase of Pseudomonas putida and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and initiates the formation of a prepriming open complex in the absence of DnaA protein. Thus, the TrfA-44 initiation protein has the multifunctional properties of recruiting and positioning an active form of the DnaB helicase at the RK2 replication origin by a DnaA-independent process. This unique property for a replication initiation protein undoubtedly plays an important role in extending the host range of the RK2 antibiotic resistance plasmid.
TI  - Control of rpoS transcription in Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas: why so different?
AB  - In Escherichia coli, the stationary phase alternative sigma factor sigmas controls the expression of genes involved cell survival in response to cessation of growth (stationary phase) and provides cross-protection to various stresses. Levels of sigmas increase dramatically at the onset of stationary phase and are regulated at the transcriptional, post-transcriptional and post-translational level, making this one of the most complex regulatory systems in bacteria. The basic mechanisms for the control of translation and sigmas proteolysis have been understood. However, studies on the transcriptional control in E. coli lag behind and are controversial. The cAMP-CRP complex and the two component BarA/UvrY system have been implicated and, ppGpp and polyphosphate appear to have a signalling role. sigmas has also been reported to be a general stress regulator in the fluorescent pseudomonads (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. fluorescens and P. putida) and recent studies on sigmas regulation highlight that transcriptional regulation in these bacteria apparently plays a major role. Global regulatory systems, the GacA/GacS two component system and quorum sensing all affect rpoS expression, as does the TetR family PsrA regulator that directly binds to- and activates the rpoS promoter in stationary phase. This striking difference in regulation between E. coli and Pseudomonas can be partly attributed to the differences in the functional role of sigmas in the two bacterial species. This report will review mainly recent studies on rpoS transcriptional regulation and will try to rationalize the current knowledge into a working model.
TI  - Molecular cloning and characterization of the alkaline ceramidase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA01.
AB  - Ceramidase (CDase) hydrolyzes the amide bond in ceramides to yield free fatty acid and sphingosine. From a 3-L Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA01 culture, 70 microg of extracellular alkaline, Ca(2+)-dependent CDase, was purified to homogeneity, the N-terminal sequence was determined, and the CDase gene was cloned. The CDase gene encodes a 670 amino acid protein with a 26 amino acid signal peptide. CDase was expressed in five prokaryotic and eukaryotic expression systems. Small amounts of recombinant active extracellular CDase were expressed by Pseudomonas putida KT2440. In Pichia pastoris GS115 low amounts of recombinant extracellular glycosylated CDase were expressed. High levels of intracellular CDase were expressed by Escherichia coli DH5alpha and E. coli BL21 cells under control of the lac-promoter and T7-promoter, respectively. From a 3-L E. coli DH5alpha culture, 280 microg of pure CDase was obtained after a three-step purification protocol. Under control of the T7-promotor CDase, without its signal peptide, was produced in inclusion bodies in E. coli BL21 cells. After refolding, 1.8 mg of pure active CDase was obtained from a 2.4-L culture after ammonium sulfate precipitation and gel filtration. Both the recombinant and wild-type CDases have a pH optimum of 8.5. The recombinant enzyme was partially characterized. This is the first report of a high yield CDase production system allowing detailed characterization of the enzyme at the molecular level.
TI  - Synthesis and activity of 5'-uridinyl dipeptide analogues mimicking the amino terminal peptide chain of nucleoside antibiotic mureidomycin A.
AB  - A series of 5'-uridinyl dipeptides were synthesised which mimic the amino terminal chain of nucleoside antibiotic mureido omycin A. Aminoacyl-beta-alanyl- and aminoacyl-N-methyl-beta-alanyl- dipeptides were attached either via an ester linkage to the 5'-hydroxyl of uridine, or via an amide linkage to 5'-amino-5'-deoxyuridine. The most active inhibitor of Escherichia coli phospho-MurNAc-pentapeptide translocase (MraY) was 5'-O-(L-Ala-N-methyl-beta-alanyl)-uridine (13l), which also showed 97% enzyme inhibition at 2.35 mM concentration, and showed antibacterial activity at 100 microg/mL concentration against Pseudomonas putida. Both the central N-methyl amide linkage and a 5' uridine ester linkage were required for highest biological activity. Enzyme inhibition was shown to be competitive with Mg(2+). It is proposed that the primary amino terminus of the inhibitor binds in place of the Mg(2+) cofactor at the MraY active site, positioned via a cis-N-methyl amide linkage.
TI  - Xylene monooxygenase, a membrane-spanning non-heme diiron enzyme that hydroxylates hydrocarbons via a substrate radical intermediate.
AB  - The non-heme diiron enzyme xylene monooxygenase (XylM) has been shown to hydroxylate hydrocarbons via a hydrogen abstraction-carbon radical recombination mechanism (oxygen rebound). Using the radical clock bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane (norcarane) in a whole-cell assay, and observing the ratio of rearranged 3-(hydroxymethyl)cyclohexene and unrearranged 2-norcaranol products, the lifetime of the substrate radical was determined to be approximately 0.2 ns. The wild-type organism Pseudomonas putida mt-2 and two separate Escherichia coli clones expressing xylMA genes gave similar results. One clone produced the Pseudomonas putida mt-2 XylMA hydroxylase and the other produced Sphingomonas yanoikuyae B1 XylMA hydroxylase. Clones were constructed by inserting genes for xylene monooxygenase and xylene monooxygenase reductase downstream from an IPTG-inducible T7 promoter. Mechanistic investigations using whole-cell assays will facilitate more rapid screening of structure-function relationships and the identification of novel oxygenases. This approach should enable the construction of a picture of the key metalloenzymes and the mechanisms they use in selected parts of the global carbon cycle without requiring the isolation of every protein involved.
TI  - Secondary metabolites of Flustra foliacea and their influence on bacteria.
AB  - The North Sea bryozoan Flustra foliacea was investigated to determine its secondary metabolite content. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of a dichloromethane extract of the bryozoan enabled 11 compounds to be identified. Preparative high-performance liquid chromatography of the extract resulted in the isolation of 10 brominated alkaloids (compounds 1 to 10) and one diterpene (compound 11). All of these compounds were tested to determine their activities in agar diffusion assays against bacteria derived from marine and terrestrial environments. Compounds 1, 3 to 7, 10, and 11 exhibited significant activities against one or more marine bacterial strains originally isolated from F. foliacea but only weak activities against all of the terrestrial bacteria. By using the biosensors Pseudomonas putida(pKR-C12), P. putida(pAS-C8), and Escherichia coli(pSB403) the antagonistic effect on N-acyl-homoserine lactone-dependent quorum-sensing systems was investigated. Compounds 8 and 10 caused reductions in the signal intensities in these bioassays ranging from 50 to 20% at a concentration of 20 micro g/ml.
TI  - Development and application of unstable GFP variants to kinetic studies of mycobacterial gene expression.
AB  - Unstable variants of green fluorescent protein (GFP) tagged with C-terminal extensions, which are targets for a tail specific protease, have been described in Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida [Appl. Envir. Microbiol. 64 (1998) 2240]. We investigated whether similar modifications to flow cytometer optimised GFP (GFPmut2) could be used to generate unstable variants of GFP for gene expression studies in mycobacteria. We constructed GFP variants in a mycobacterial shuttle vector under the control of the regulatory region of the inducible Mycobacterium smegmatis acetamidase gene. GFP expression was induced by the addition of acetamide and the stability of the GFP variants in M. smegmatis, following the removal of the inducer to switch off their expression, was determined using spectrofluorometry and flow cytometry. We demonstrate that, compared to the GFPmut2 (half-lives>7 days), the modified GFP variants exhibit much lower half-lives (between 70 and 165 min) in M. smegmatis. To investigate their utility in the measurement of mycobacterial gene expression, we cloned the promoter region of a putative amino acid efflux pump gene, lysE (Rv1986), from Mycobacterium tuberculosis together with the divergently transcribed, putative lysR-type regulator gene (Rv1985c) upstream of one of the unstable GFP variants. We found that the expression kinetics of the lysRE-gfp fusion were identical throughout the M. smegmatis growth curve to those measured using a conventional lysRE-xylE reporter fusion, peaking upon entry into stationary phase. In addition, it was established that the tagged GFP variants were also unstable in Mycobacterium bovis BCG. Thus, we have demonstrated that unstable GFP variants are suitable reporter genes for monitoring transient gene expression in fast- and slow-growing mycobacteria.
TI  - Biosynthesis of pyridoxine in Saccharomyces cerevisiae--origin of the pyridoxine  nitrogen atom differs under anaerobic and aerobic conditions.
AB  - The amide nitrogen atom of glutamine is incorporated into pyridoxine in four eukaryotes (i.e., Emericella nidulans, Mucor racemosus, Neurospora crassa and Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and two prokaryotes (i.e., Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis). However, in the prokaryotes Pseudomonas putida, Enterobacter aerogenes and Escherichia coli, it is the nitrogen atom of glutamate that is incorporated into pyridoxine (J Nutr Sci Vitaminol (2000) 46, 55-57). As these results were from experiments conducted under aerobic conditions, we investigated the biosynthesis of pyridoxine on S. cerevisiae under anaerobic conditions. The results showed that [amide-15N]L-glutamine was not incorporated into pyridoxine, unlike the results for aerobic conditions. The incorporation of [15N]ammonium salts into pyridoxine was not inhibited in the presence of casamino acids and tryptophan. The results showed that the nitrogen atoms of amino acids are not used for the biosynthesis of pyridoxine. The incorporation of 15N into pyridoxine was inhibited in the presence of adenine, but not in that of hypoxanthine. Thus, the nitrogen atom of pyridoxine may be from the amino group attached to the C-6 of adenine.
TI  - Long-term reduction of cold hardiness following ingestion of ice-nucleating bacteria in the Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata.
AB  - We investigated the effect of ingestion of ice-nucleating bacteria on the supercooling capacity and cold hardiness of the Colorado potato beetle (Leptinotarsa decemlineata Say), a freeze-intolerant species that overwinters as adults in shallow, terrestrial burrows. Ingestion of ice-nucleating bacteria (Enterobacter agglomerans, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Pseudomonas putida, Pseudomonas syringae), fed on slices of potato tuber, caused an abrupt decrease in supercooling capacity. No change occurred in the supercooling capacity of beetles fed Escherichia coli, as this species lacks ice-nucleating activity. Ingestion rates showed that tubers treated with different species were equally palatable. During diapause induction beetles evacuated food from their guts, but nevertheless retained sufficient ice-nucleating bacteria to diminish supercooling. Beetles fed P. fluorescens and P. putida exhibited reduced supercooling even after an 8-wk exposure to simulated winter conditions. Furthermore, P. fluorescens was isolated 10-wk post-ingestion from diapausing beetles. Our data suggest that ingested bacteria may be retained by insects during entry into diapause and that the cold hardiness of candidate crop pests, such as L. decemlineata, may be reduced by feeding them ice-nucleating bacteria prior to winter diapause.
TI  - Functional analyses of genes involved in the metabolism of ferulic acid in Pseudomonas putida KT2440.
AB  - Pseudomonas putida KT2440 is a physiologically extremely versatile non-pathogenic bacterium that is applied as a "biosafety strain" in biotechnological processes, as authorized by the USA National Institute of Health. Analysis of the P. putida KT2440 whole-genome sequence revealed the genetic organization of the genes fcs, ech, and vdh, which are essential for ferulic acid conversion to vanillic acid via vanillin. To confirm the physiological function of these structural genes as feruloyl-CoA synthetase (Fcs), enoyl-CoA hydratase/aldolase (Ech), and vanillin dehydrogenase (Vdh), respectively, they were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. Recombinant strains harboring fcs and ech were able to transform ferulic acid to vanillin. The enzyme activities of Fcs and Vdh were determined in protein extracts of these cells. The essential involvement of fcs, ech and vdh in the catabolism of ferulic acid in P. putida KT2440 was proven by separately inactivating each gene by insertion of Omega-elements. The corresponding mutant strains KT2440 fcsOmegaKm, KT2440 echOmegaKm, and KT2440 vdhOmegaKm were not able to grow on ferulic acid. The potential application of P. putida KT2440 and the mutant strains in biotechnological vanillin production process is discussed.
TI  - Construction of biofilms with defined internal architecture using dielectrophoresis and flocculation.
AB  - A novel approach was developed for the construction of biofilms with defined internal architecture using AC electrokinetics and flocculation. Artificial structured microbial consortia (ASMC) consisting of localized layered microcolonies of different cell types were formed by sequentially attracting different cell types to high field regions near microelectrodes using dielectrophoresis. Stabilization of the microbial consortia on the electrode surface was achieved by crosslinking the cells using the flocculant polyethyleneimine (PEI). Consortia of Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae were made as model systems. Also, more natural consortia were made of the bacteria Pseudomonas putida, Clavibacter michiganense, and Methylobacterium mesophilum, which are found together in consortia during biodegradation of metal-cutting waste fluids.
TI  - Gene cluster of Arthrobacter ilicis Ru61a involved in the degradation of quinaldine to anthranilate: characterization and functional expression of the quinaldine 4-oxidase qoxLMS genes.
AB  - A genetic analysis of the anthranilate pathway of quinaldine degradation was performed. A 23-kb region of DNA from Arthrobacter ilicis Ru61a was cloned into the cosmid pVK100. Although Escherichia coli clones containing the recombinant cosmid did not transform quinaldine, cosmids harboring the 23-kb region, or a 10.8-kb stretch of this region, conferred to Pseudomonas putida KT2440 the ability to cometabolically convert quinaldine to anthranilate. The 10.8-kb fragment thus contains the genes coding for quinaldine 4-oxidase (Qox), 1H-4-oxoquinaldine 3-monooxygenase, 1H-3-hydroxy-4-oxoquinaldine 2,4-dioxygenase, and N-acetylanthranilate amidase. The qoxLMS genes coding for the molybdopterin cytosine dinucleotide-(MCD-), FeSI-, FeSII-, and FAD-containing Qox were inserted into the expression vector pJB653, generating pKP1. Qox is the first MCD-containing enzyme to be synthesized in a catalytically fully competent form by a heterologous host, P. putida KT2440 pKP1; the catalytic properties and the UV-visible and EPR spectra of Qox purified from P. putida KT2440 pKP1 were essentially like those of wild-type Qox. This provides a starting point for the construction of protein variants of Qox by site-directed mutagenesis. Downstream of the qoxLMS genes, a putative gene whose deduced amino acid sequence showed 37% similarity to the cofactor-inserting chaperone XdhC was located. Additional open reading frames identified on the 23-kb segment may encode further enzymes (a glutamyl tRNA synthetase, an esterase, two short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases, an ATPase belonging to the AAA family, a 2-hydroxyhepta-2,4-diene-1,7-dioate isomerase/5-oxopent-3-ene-1,2,5-tricarboxylate decarboxylase-like protein, and an enzyme of the mandelate racemase group) and hypothetical proteins involved in transcriptional regulation, and metabolite transport.
TI  - Cloning and overexpression of the 3-hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenase gene from pseudomonas putida E23.
AB  - The structural gene for NAD+-dependent 3-hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.31) from Pseudomonas putida E23 was cloned in Escherichia coli cells to obtain a large amount of the enzyme and its nucleotides were sequenced to study its structural relationship with other proteins. The gene encoded a polypeptide containing 295 amino acid residues and was in a cluster with the gene for methylmalonate semialdehyde dehydrogenase. Transformed E. coli cells overproduced 3-hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenase, and the recombinant enzyme was purified to homogeneity with a high yield. Lysine and asparagine residues, which are important in catalysis of the 3-hydroxyacid dehydrogenase family, are conserved in this enzyme.
TI  - IMP-12, a new plasmid-encoded metallo-beta-lactamase from a Pseudomonas putida clinical isolate.
AB  - A Pseudomonas putida strain showing broad-spectrum resistance to beta-lactams, including expanded-spectrum cephalosporins and carbapenems, was isolated from a patient with a urinary tract infection at the University Hospital of Varese in northern Italy. The isolate was found to produce metallo-beta-lactamase activity and to harbor a 50-kb plasmid, named pVA758, carrying a new bla(IMP) determinant, named bla(IMP-12). Plasmid pVA758 was not self-transferable by conjugation to either Escherichia coli or Pseudomonas aeruginosa but could be introduced by electroporation and maintained in the latter host, where it conferred resistance or decreased susceptibility to various beta-lactams. The IMP-12 enzyme is quite divergent from other IMP variants: its closest relatives are IMP-8 and IMP-2 (89 and 88% sequence identity, respectively), and IMP-1 is 85% identical to IMP-12. The bla(IMP-12) determinant is carried on an integron-borne gene cassette whose attC recombination site is related to those present in cassettes containing bla(IMP-1), bla(IMP-6), bla(IMP-7), bla(IMP-10), and bla(IMP-11) and unrelated to that present in cassettes containing bla(IMP-2) and bla(IMP-8). IMP-12 was overproduced in E. coli by using a T7-based expression system and was purified by cation-exchange chromatography followed by gel filtration. Kinetic analysis revealed that, like other IMP variants, IMP-12 exhibits an overall preference for cephalosporins and carbapenems rather than for penicillins and does not hydrolyze temocillin and aztreonam. However, IMP-12 also exhibits some notable functional differences from other IMP variants, including uniformly poor activity toward penicillins (k(cat)/K(m) values, around 10(4) M(-1). s(-1)) and a remarkably high K(m) (around 900 micro M) for imipenem.
TI  - Equilibrium and kinetic adsorption of bacteria on alluvial sand and surface thermodynamic interpretation.
AB  - Equilibrium and kinetic adsorption of Escherichia coli HB 101, E. coli JM 109, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Pseudomonas putida and Pseudomonas sp. on alluvial sand from the Canadian River alluvium (Norman, OK) was investigated through column experiments. Equilibrium adsorption of these five bacterial strains followed the Freundlich expression and was a function of zero energy points, an indication of the zero energy buffer zone. Among the microorganisms studied, P. putida had the greatest equilibrium adsorption (162.4 x 10(8) cell/g sediment with a microbial injectate concentration of 10(8) cell/ml), followed by Pseudomonas sp. (127.9 x 10(8) cell/g sediment), E. coli HB 101 (62.8 x 10(8) cell/g sediment), E. coli JM 109 (58.4 x 10(8) cell/g sediment), and P. fluorescens (42.6 x 10(8) cell/g sediment). The first-order kinetic adsorption rate coefficient was an exponential function of the total interaction free energy between the bacteria and sediment evaluated at the primary minimum, Delta G(132)(TOT) (PM). E. coli HB 101 had the greatest kinetic adsorption rate coefficient on the sediment (5.10 h(-1)), followed by E. coli JM 109 (4.52 h(-1)), P. fluorescens (2.12 h(-1)), P. putida (2.04 h(-1)), and Pseudomonas sp. (1.34 h(-1)).
TI  - Chemical biotechnology for the specific oxyfunctionalization of hydrocarbons on a technical scale.
AB  - Oxygenases catalyze, among other interesting reactions, highly selective hydrocarbon oxyfunctionalizations, which are important in industrial organic synthesis but difficult to achieve by chemical means. Many enzymatic oxygenations have been described, but few of these have been scaled up to industrial scales, due to the complexity of oxygenase based biocatalysts and demanding process implementation. We have combined recombinant whole-cell catalysis in a two-liquid phase system with fed-batch cultivation in an optimized medium and developed an industrially feasible process for the kinetically controlled and complex multistep oxidation of pseudocumene to 3,4-dimethylbenzaldehyde using the xylene monooxygenase of Pseudomonas putida mt-2 in Escherichia coli. Successful scale up to 30 L working volume using downscaled industrial equipment allowed a productivity of 31 g L(-1) d(-1) and a product concentration of 37 g L(-1). These performance characteristics meet present industry requirements. Product purification resulted in the recovery of 469 g of 3,4-dimethyl- benzaldehyde at a purity of 97% and an overall yield of 65%. This process illustrates the general feasibility of industrial biocatalytic oxyfunctionalization.
TI  - Characterization of pNI10 plasmid in Pseudomonas, and the construction of an improved Escherichia and Pseudomonas shuttle vector, pNUK73.
AB  - The complete nucleotide sequence of pNI10 (3.75 kb), from which pNI105 and pNI107 were constructed as medium-host-range vectors for Gram-negative bacteria, was determined. A fragment of about 2.1 kb of pNI10 was essential for replication in Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas fluorescens. This fragment encodes a putative origin of replication ( ori) and one putative replication-controlling protein (Rep). An improved version of the medium-host-range plasmid vector pNUK73 (5.13 kb) was constructed with the basic-replicon of pNI10 and pHSG298 (2.68 kb). We show that expression in pseudomonads of the bromoperoxidase gene ( bpo) of Pseudomonas putida, inserted downstream of the lac promoter in pNUK73, resulted in about 30% (13.6 U/l culture) of the enzyme level obtained in E. coli.
TI  - The quinohaemoprotein lupanine hydroxylase from Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - Lupanine hydroxylase catalyses the first reaction in the catabolism of the alkaloid lupanine by Pseudomonas putida. It dehydrogenates the substrate, which can then be hydrated. It is a monomeric protein of M(r) 72,000 and contains a covalently bound haem and a molecule of PQQ. The gene for this enzyme has been cloned and sequenced and the derived protein sequence has a 26 amino acid signal sequence at the N-terminal for translocation of the protein to the periplasm. Many of the features seen in the sequence of lupanine hydroxylase are common with other quinoproteins including the W-motifs that are characteristic of the eight-bladed propeller structure of methanol dehydrogenase. However, the unusual disulfide bridge between adjacent cysteines that is present in some PQQ-containing enzymes is absent in lupanine hydroxylase. The C-terminal domain contains characteristics of a cytochrome c and overall the sequence shows similarities with that of the quinohaemoprotein, alcohol dehydrogenase from Comamonas testosteroni. The gene coding for lupanine hydroxylase has been successfully expressed in Escherichia coli and a procedure has been developed to renature and reactivate the enzyme, which was found to be associated with the inclusion bodies. Reactivation required addition of PQQ and was dependent on calcium ions.
TI  - Identification and characterization of a mandelamide hydrolase and an NAD(P)+-dependent benzaldehyde dehydrogenase from Pseudomonas putida ATCC 12633.
AB  - The enzymes of the mandelate metabolic pathway permit Pseudomonas putida ATCC 12633 to utilize either or both enantiomers of mandelate as the sole carbon source. The genes encoding the mandelate pathway were found to lie on a single 10.5-kb restriction fragment. Part of that fragment was shown to contain the genes coding for mandelate racemase, mandelate dehydrogenase, and benzoylformate decarboxylase arranged in an operon. Here we report the sequencing of the remainder of the restriction fragment, which revealed three further open reading frames, denoted mdlX, mdlY, and mdlD. All were transcribed in the opposite direction from the genes of the mdlABC operon. Sequence alignments suggested that the open reading frames encoded a regulatory protein (mdlX), a member of the amidase signature family (mdlY), and an NAD(P)(+)-dependent dehydrogenase (mdlD). The mdlY and mdlD genes were isolated and expressed in Escherichia coli, and the purified gene products were characterized as a mandelamide hydrolase and an NAD(P)(+)-dependent benzaldehyde dehydrogenase, respectively.
TI  - Effect of aliphatic alcohols on growth and degree of saturation of membrane lipids in Acinetobacter calcoaceticus.
AB  - The adaptive responses of the bacterium Acinetobacter calcoaceticus to different  aliphatic alcohols on the level of the membrane fatty acids were studied in detail. The toxicity of the aliphatic alcohols increased with an increasing hydrophobicity. As alcohols are known to increase the fluidity of the membrane they consequently should cause the same adaptive effect on membrane level. Yet, cells of A. calcoaceticus react completely different to the alcohols: in the presence of long-chained alcohols they increase their degree of saturation, while in the presence of short-chained alcohols they decrease the degree of saturation. So, there are no observable differences in the adaptive responses of bacteria with the so-called anaerobic pathway, like Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida, and the bacterium carrying the so-called aerobic pathway like A. calcoaceticus. These results strongly indicate a physico-chemical difference in the membrane effect of both the partitioning and localisation of the different alcohols into the membrane and the membrane adaptive responses of the bacteria to these effects.
TI  - A constructed microbial consortium for biodegradation of the organophosphorus insecticide parathion.
AB  - A consortium comprised of two engineered microorganisms was assembled for biodegradation of the organophosphate insecticide parathion. Escherichia coli SD2 harbored two plasmids, one encoding a gene for parathion hydrolase and a second carrying a green fluorescent protein marker. Pseudomonas putida KT2440 pSB337 contained a p-nitrophenol-inducible plasmid-borne operon encoding the genes for p-nitrophenol mineralization. The co-culture effectively hydrolyzed 500 microM parathion (146 mg l(-1)) and prevented the accumulation of p-nitrophenol in suspended culture. Kinetic analyses were conducted to characterize the growth and substrate utilization of the consortium members. Parathion hydrolysis by E. coli SD2 followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics. p-Nitrophenol mineralization by P. putida KT2440 pSB337 exhibited substrate-inhibition kinetics. The growth of both strains was inhibited by increasing concentrations of p-nitrophenol, with E. coli SD2 completely inhibited by 600 microM p-nitrophenol (83 mg l(-1)) and P. putida KT2440 pSB337 inhibited by 1,000 microM p-nitrophenol (139 mg l(-1)). Cultivation of the consortium as a biofilm indicated that the two species could cohabit as a population of attached cells. Analysis by confocal microscopy showed that the biofilm was predominantly comprised of P. putida KT2440 pSB337 and that the distribution of E. coli SD2 within the biofilm was heterogeneous. The use of biofilms for the construction of degradative consortia may prove beneficial.
TI  - Purification and properties of 2-hydroxy-6-oxo-6-(2'-aminophenyl)hexa-2,4-dienoic acid hydrolase involved in microbial degradation of carbazole.
AB  - Hydrolysis following meta-ring cleavage by a dioxygenase is a well-known step in  aromatic compound metabolism. The 2-hydroxy-6-oxo-6-(2'-aminophenyl)hexa-2,4-dienoic acid hydrolase from Pseudomonas LD2 is a new member of the small group of characterized aromatic hydrolases that catalyze the cleavage of C-C bonds. In this study, the His(6)-tagged 2-hydroxy-6-oxo-6-(2'-aminophenyl)hexa-2,4-dienoic acid (HOPDA) hydrolase was purified from a recombinant Escherichia coli strain utilizing immobilized metal affinity chromatography. 2-Hydroxy-6-oxo-6-(2'-aminophenyl)hexa-2,4-dienoic acid hydrolase is a colorless homodimer with no cofactor requirement. The enzyme actively converted HOPDA into benzoic acid and 2-hydroxypenta-2,4-dienoic acid. The enzyme exhibited activity between pH 6.5 and 10.5 with a maximum activity at pH 7.0. The optimum temperature at pH 7.0 was 60 degrees C. The calculated K'(m) for HOPDA was 4.6 microM, the V(max) was 3.3 micromol min(-1), and the K(s) was 70.0 microM. This corresponds to a maximum specific turnover rate of 1300 HOPDAs(-1)dimer(-1). The deduced amino acid sequence of CarC showed 30.3, 31.3, and 31.8% identity with TodF (P. putida F1), XylF (P. putida), and DmpD (Pseudomonas sp. CF600), respectively, which are meta-cleavage compound hydrolases from other Pseudomonads. The amino acid sequence Gly-X-Ser-X-Gly, which is highly conserved in these hydrolases, is also found in CarC. Lysates from a strain expressing enzyme in which the putative active site serine is mutated to alanine showed a significant reduction in activity.
TI  - Functions of malonate decarboxylase subunits from Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - Malonate decarboxylase from Pseudomonasputida is composed of five subunits, alpha, beta, gamma, delta, and epsilon. Two subunits, delta and epsilon, have been identified as an acyl-carrier protein (ACP) and malonyl-CoA:ACP transacylase, respectively. Functions of the other three subunits have not been identified, because recombinant subunits expressed in Escherichia coi formed inclusion bodies. To resolve this problem, we used a coexpression system with GroEL/ES from E. coli, and obtained active recombinant subunits. Enzymatic analysis of the purified recombinant subunits showed that the alpha subunit was an acetyl-S-ACP:malonate ACP transferase and that the betagamma-subunit complex was a malonyl-S-ACP decarboxylase.
TI  - Identification of a novel Gsp-related pathway required for secretion of the manganese-oxidizing factor of Pseudomonas putida strain GB-1.
AB  - The manganese-oxidizing factor of Pseudomonas putida strain GB-1 is associated with the outer membrane. One of the systems of protein transport across the outer membrane is the general secretory pathway (Gsp). The gsp genes are called xcp in Pseudomonas species. In a previous study, it was shown that mutation of the prepilin peptidase XcpA and of a homologue of the pseudopilin XcpT inhibited transport of the factor. In the present study, we describe the genomic region flanking the xcpT homologue (designated xcmT1). We show that xcmT1 is part of a two-gene operon that includes an xcpS homologue (designated xcmS). No other xcp-like genes are present in the regions flanking the xcmT1/xcmS cluster. We also characterized the site of transposon insertion of another transport mutant of P. putida GB-1. This insertion appeared to be located in a gene (designated xcmX) possibly encoding another pseudopilin-related protein. This xcmX is clustered with two other xcpT-related genes (designated xcmT2 and xcmT3) on one side and homologues of three csg genes (designated csmE, csmF and csmG) on the other side. The csg genes are involved in production of aggregative fibres in Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium. A search for XcmX homologues revealed that the recently published genome of Ralstonia solanacearum and the unannotated genome of P. putida KT2440 contain comparable gene clusters with xcmX and xcp homologues that are different from the well-described 'regular'xcp/gsp clusters. They do contain xcpR and xcpQ homologues but, for example, homologues of xcpP, Y and Z are lacking. The results suggest a novel Xcp-related system for the transport of manganese-oxidizing enzymes to the cell surface.
TI  - Microbial toxicity tests and chemical analysis as monitoring parameters at composting of creosote-contaminated soil.
AB  - Traditionally, chemical analyses are used in the assessment of contaminated soil  and in monitoring the efficiency of soil remediation processes. We investigated if chemical analysis could be supported and even partly replaced by biological toxicity tests. In two case studies creosote-contaminated soil was composted outdoors in 5- and 100-m3 windrows. Degradation of polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) was followed by chemical analysis and toxicity tests. Polyaromatic hydrocarbons were quantified and identified by HPLC. Because the soil was also contaminated by copper-, chromium-, and arsenic-containing fungicides, these elements were analyzed by atomic absorption spectrometry. The toxicity of soil samples was assessed by a soil-contact modification of the luminescent bacteria (Vibrio fischeri) test and in the other case also by enzyme synthesis inhibition (Toxi-ChromoPad test, Escherichia coli). The toxicity of soil water extracts was measured by the standard luminescent bacteria (V. fischeri) test and bacterial (Pseudomonas putida) growth inhibition test. After the first 4 months of the composting period the total amount of PAHs was reduced in all windrows, and in particular, the loss of two- and some three-ring compounds was high, almost 90%. Toxicity decreased concurrently with the decrease in PAH concentration during composting, but after 4 months, one of the piles inoculated with mycobacteria and containing more three- and four-ring compounds was found to be more toxic than at the beginning. After the next summer, total PAH content was further reduced but some four-ring or heavier compounds were demonstrated to be poorly degraded. The toxicity was also reduced to the same level as in the control pile. The total PAH content and the toxicity were both reduced significantly during 5 months of composting.
TI  - Modulation of pPS10 host range by plasmid-encoded RepA initiator protein.
AB  - We report here the isolation and analysis of novel repA host range mutants of pPS10, a plasmid originally found in Pseudomonas savastanoi. Upon hydroxylamine treatment, five plasmid mutants were selected for their establishment in Escherichia coli at 37 degrees C, a temperature at which the wild-type form cannot be established. The mutations were located in different functional regions of the plasmid RepA initiation protein, and the mutants differ in their stable maintenance, copy number, and ability to interact with sequences of the basic replicon. Four of them have broadened their host range, and one of them, unable to replicate in Pseudomonas, has therefore changed its host range. Moreover, the mutants also have increased their replication efficiency in strains other than E. coli such as Pseudomonas putida and Alcaligenes faecalis. None of these mutations drastically changed the structure or thermal stability of the wild-type RepA protein, but in all cases an enhanced interaction with host-encoded DnaA protein was detected by gel filtration chromatography. The effects of the mutations on the functionality of RepA protein are discussed in the framework of a three-dimensional model of the protein. We propose possible explanations for the host range effect of the different repA mutants, including the enhancement of limiting interactions of RepA with specific host replication factors such as DnaA.
TI  - Pyoverdine-mediated regulation of FpvA synthesis in Pseudomonas aeruginosa: involvement of a probable extracytoplasmic-function sigma factor, FpvI.
AB  - A search of the pvd pyoverdine biosynthesis locus of Pseudomonas aeruginosa identified an open reading frame, PA2387, whose product exhibited a sequence similar to those of a number of so-called extracytoplasmic- function sigma factors responsible for siderophore-dependent expression of iron-siderophore receptors in Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida. Deletion of this gene, dubbed fpvI, compromised pyoverdine-dependent FpvA ferric pyoverdine receptor production and fpvA gene expression, while the cloned gene stimulated fpvA expression. A Fur-binding site was identified immediately upstream of fpvI, consistent with the observed iron-regulated expression of fpvI and fpvA.
TI  - Recombinant carbazole-degrading strains for enhanced petroleum processing.
AB  - Biotechnological upgrading of fossil fuels is of increasing interest as remaining stocks of petroleum show increasing levels of contaminants such as heavy metals, sulfur and nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic compounds. Carbazole is of particular interest as a major petroleum component known to reduce refining yields through catalyst poisoning. In this study, the biotransformation of carbazole was successfully demonstrated in a liquid two-phase system, when solubilized in either 1-methylnaphthalene or in diesel fuel. The effects of solvent toxicity were investigated by expressing the carbazole-transformation genes from MB1332, a rifampicin-resistant derivative of Pseudomonas sp. LD2, in a solvent-resistant heterologous host, P. putida Idaho [1]. This solvent-resistant strain successfully degraded carbazole solubilized in 1-methylnaphthalene and in the presence of 10 vol% xylenes similar to the non-recombinant strain Pseudomonas sp. LD2. Identification of a suitable recombinant host, however, was essential for further investigations of partial pathway transformations. Recombinant P. putida Idaho expressing only the initial dioxygenase enzymes transformed carbazole to an intermediate well retained in the oil phase. Partial carbazole transformation converts carbazole to non-aromatic species; their effect is unknown on refinery catalyst poisoning, but would allow almost complete retention of carbon content and fuel value.
TI  - Detection of multiple extracytoplasmic function (ECF) sigma factors in the genome of Pseudomonas putida KT2440 and their counterparts in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA01.
AB  - Pseudomonas putida KT2440 is highly successful in colonizing a variety habitats,  including aquatic and edaphic niches. In accordance with this ability and with the need to adapt to changing environmental conditions, P. putida has developed sophisticated mechanisms of transcriptional regulation. We analysed, at the genome level, the repertoire of sigma factors in P. putida KT2440 and identified 24 sigma factors, 19 of which corresponded to the subfamily of extracytoplasmic function (ECF) sigma factors. We detected 13 ECF sigma factors that showed similarity to the Escherichia coli FecI sigma factor, which is involved in iron acquisition. In 11 cases, a fecR-like gene was found adjacent to the fecI-like gene and, in 10 cases, a gene encoding an iron receptor lies in the vicinity of the fecI/fecR cluster. This may explain the ability of P. putida KT2440 to grow under low iron availability conditions. Five fecI/fecR/iron receptor gene clusters from P. putida were also identified in the human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - Plant lectin-like bacteriocin from a rhizosphere-colonizing Pseudomonas isolate.
AB  - Rhizosphere isolate Pseudomonas sp. strain BW11M1, which belongs to the Pseudomonas putida cluster, secretes a heat- and protease-sensitive bacteriocin which kills P. putida GR12-2R3. The production of this bacteriocin is enhanced by DNA-damaging treatment of producer cells. We isolated a TnMod mutant of strain BW11M1 that had lost the capacity to inhibit the growth of strain GR12-2R3. A wild-type genomic fragment encompassing the transposon insertion site was shown to confer the bacteriocin phenotype when it was introduced into Escherichia coli cells. The bacteriocin structural gene was identified by defining the minimal region required for expression in E. coli. This gene was designated llpA (lectin-like putidacin) on the basis of significant homology of its 276-amino-acid product with mannose-binding lectins from monocotyledonous plants. LlpA is composed of two monocot mannose-binding lectin (MMBL) domains. Several uncharacterized bacterial genes encoding diverse proteins containing one or two MMBL domains were identified. A phylogenetic analysis of the MMBL domains present in eukaryotic and prokaryotic proteins assigned the putidacin domains to a new bacterial clade within the MMBL-containing protein family. Heterologous expression of the llpA gene also conveyed bacteriocin production to several Pseudomonas fluorescens strains. In addition, we demonstrated that strain BW11M1 and heterologous hosts secrete LlpA into the growth medium without requiring a cleavable signal sequence. Most likely, the mode of action of this lectin-like bacteriocin is different from the modes of action of previously described Pseudomonas bacteriocins.
TI  - Use of the two-liquid phase concept to exploit kinetically controlled multistep biocatalysis.
AB  - The two-liquid phase concept was used to develop a whole cell biocatalytic system for the efficient multistep oxidation of pseudocumene to 3,4-dimethylbenzaldehyde. Recombinant Escherichia coli cells were employed to express the Pseudomonas putida genes encoding xylene monooxygenase, which catalyzes the multistep oxygenation of one methyl group of toluene and xylenes to corresponding alcohols, aldehydes, and acids. A fed-batch based two-liquid phase bioconversion was established with bis(2-ethylhexyl)- phthalate as organic carrier solvent and a phase ratio of 0.5; the product formation pattern, the impact of the nutrient feeding strategy, and the partitioning behavior of the reactants were studied. On the basis of the favorable conditions provided by the two-liquid phase system, engineering of the initial pseudocumene concentration allowed exploiting the complex kinetics of the multistep reaction for the exclusive production of 3,4-dimethyl- benzaldehyde. Further oxidation of the product to 3,4-dimethylbenzoic acid could be inhibited by suitable concentrations of pseudocumene or 3,4-dimethylbenzyl alcohol. The optimized biotransformation setup includes a completely defined medium with high iron content and a nutrient feeding strategy that avoids severe glucose limitation as well as high inhibitory glucose levels. Using such a system on a 2-liter scale, we were able to produce, within 14.5 h, 30 g of 3,4-dimethylbenzaldehyde as predominant reactant in the organic phase and reached a maximal productivity of 1.6 g per liter liquid volume per hour. The present study implicates that the two-liquid phase concept is an efficient tool to exploit the kinetics of multistep biotransformations in general.
TI  - Measurement of strain-dependent toxicity in the indene bioconversion using multiparameter flow cytometry.
AB  - The bionconversion of indene to cis-(1S,2R)-indandiol, a potential key intermediate in the synthesis of Merck's HIV protease inhibitor, CRIXIVAN trade mark, can be achieved using Rhodococcus, Pseudomonas putida, and Escherichia coli strains. This study reports on the application of multiparameter flow cytometry for the measurement of cytoplasmic membrane integrity and membrane depolarization as indicators of toxic effects of the substrate, product, and by-products using each of these strains. Measurements of oxygen uptake rate (OUR) and optical density (OD) as indicators of metabolic activity and biomass growth, respectively, were also made. Measurements of the cytoplasmic membrane potential, cell viability, and respiratory activity provided a sensitive set of parameters to assess toxicity in the indene bioconversion and provided the basis for process improvements and strain selection. The toxic concentrations of the substrate, product, and by-products for each strain have been determined. The results show that it is possible to accumulate cis-(1S,2R)-indandiol and cis-1-amino-2-indanol up to 20 g/L without significant negative effects on cell physiology using any of the strains tested. The Gram-negative P. putida (421-5 and GM 730) and E. coli strains were more resistant to indene and the isolated chemicals of the biotransformation than the Gram-positive Rhodoccoccus I24 strain, possibly due to the presence of the outer membrane and efflux pump mechanisms. P. putida GM 730 and the E. coli TDO 123 strains responded similarly to toxic effects, and the E. coli TDO 123 strain was more resistant than the P. putida 421-5 strain. In addition to the recommendations for strain selection, the identified targets for bioprocess improvement include a combination of genetic as well as process engineering approaches.
TI  - Transcriptional organization of the Pseudomonas putida tol-oprL genes.
AB  - Proteins of the Tol system play a key role in the maintenance of outer membrane integrity and cell morphology in gram-negative bacteria. In Pseudomonas putida, the seven genes, orf1, tolQ, tolR, tolA, tolB, oprL, and orf2, which encode the proteins of this complex, are clustered in a 5.8-kb region of chromosomal DNA. Analysis of polar mutations, reverse transcriptase PCR assays, and transcriptional fusion constructs with a promoterless lacZ gene revealed that the genes are arranged in two operons: orf1 tolQ tolR tolA tolB and oprL orf2. We were also able to find a transcript that was initiated at the orf1 promoter and covered the two operons in a single mRNA. On the basis of the OprL protein level, we surmised that this transcript contributed only about 10 to 15% of the total OprL protein. Primer extension analysis identified the oprL orf2 operon promoter within the tolB gene, and the -10 and -35 regions exhibited some similarity to those of sigma(70)-recognized promoters. The transcription start point of orf1 was located 91 bp upstream of the orf1 start codon, and the -10/-35 region also exhibited sigma(70) -10/-35 recognition sequences. The expression from both promoters in rich and minimal media was constitutive and was very little influenced by the growth phase or iron-deficient conditions. In addition, analyses of the beta-galactosidase activities of different translational fusion constructs revealed that translation of tolA and orf2 genes was dependent on the translation of their corresponding upstream genes (tolR and oprL, respectively).
TI  - A comparison of the antimicrobial activity of meropenem and selected broad-spectrum antimicrobials tested against multi-drug resistant Gram-negative bacilli including bacteraemic Salmonella spp.: initial studies for the MYSTIC programme in India.
AB  - The evolution in India of multi-drug resistant pathogens possessing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) threatens to compromise the clinical utility of third-generation cephalosporins and monobactams. Using selected resistant strains from a recent Indian 10 centre surveillance study that measured the prevailing incidence of resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics, the potential clinical utility of meropenem was assessed against nine other antimicrobial agents. A total of 212 Gram-negative bacilli were tested, of which 125 were confirmed by reference methods to be ESBL-producers. Meropenem was the most active of the test antimicrobials against these strains and the rank order of susceptibility was meropenem (99.1% susceptible) > piperacillin/tazobactam (76.9%) > ciprofloxacin (42.5%) > aminoglycosides (34.4-39.6%) = other beta-lactams (30.0-39.6%). Of the tested strains only two (Acinetobacter spp. and Pseudomonas putida) showed an intermediate susceptibility (8 mg/l) to meropenem. Of the 57 tested strains of Salmonella spp., three had an ESBL phenotype, confirmed two of the strains. This study confirms the high levels of resistance to beta-lactams agents in India reported elsewhere and also demonstrates, for Escherichia coli and Klebsiella spp., high levels of co-resistance between the tested beta-lactam agents and ciprofloxacin and the aminoglycosides, gentamicin and tobramycin. However, carbapenems such as meropenem, remain a therapeutic option.
TI  - Preliminary crystallographic studies of the creatinine amidohydrolase from Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - Creatinine amidohydrolase (creatininase; EC 3.5.2.10) from Pseudomonas putida has been overexpressed in Escherichia coli and crystallized by the hanging-drop method. The crystal belongs to the orthorhombic space group P2(1)2(1)2(1), with unit-cell parameters a = 102.0, b = 150.7, c = 167.1 A. Native data were collected to 1.8 A resolution by a rotation method at 100 K using an ADSC Quantum 4R CCD detector with synchrotron radiation.
TI  - Gene cloning and characterization of multiple alkane hydroxylase systems in Rhodococcus strains Q15 and NRRL B-16531.
AB  - The alkane hydroxylase systems of two Rhodococcus strains (NRRL B-16531 and Q15,  isolated from different geographical locations) were characterized. Both organisms contained at least four alkane monooxygenase gene homologs (alkB1, alkB2, alkB3, and alkB4). In both strains, the alkB1 and alkB2 homologs were part of alk gene clusters, each encoding two rubredoxins (rubA1 and rubA2; rubA3 and rubA4), a putative TetR transcriptional regulatory protein (alkU1; alkU2), and, in the alkB1 cluster, a rubredoxin reductase (rubB). The alkB3 and alkB4 homologs were found as separate genes which were not part of alk gene clusters. Functional heterologous expression of some of the rhodococcal alk genes (alkB2, rubA2, and rubA4 [NRRL B-16531]; alkB2 and rubB [Q15]) was achieved in Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas expression systems. Pseudomonas recombinants containing rhodococcal alkB2 were able to mineralize and grow on C(12) to C(16) n-alkanes. All rhodococcal alkane monooxygenases possessed the highly conserved eight-histidine motif, including two apparent alkane monooxygenase signature motifs (LQRH[S/A]DHH and NYXEHYG[L/M]), and the six hydrophobic membrane-spanning regions found in all alkane monooxygenases related to the Pseudomonas putida GPo1 alkane monooxygenase. The presence of multiple alkane hydroxylases in the two rhodococcal strains is reminiscent of other multiple-degradative-enzyme systems reported in Rhodococcus.
TI  - Antimicrobial properties of the Escherichia coli R1 plasmid host killing peptide.
AB  - The 52 amino acid host killing peptide (Hok) from the hok/sok post-segregational  killer system of the Escherichia coli plasmid R1 was synthesized using Fmoc (9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl) chemistry, and its molecular weight was confirmed by mass spectroscopy. Hok kills cells by depolarizing the cytoplasmic membrane when it is made in the cytosol. Six microorganisms, E. coli, Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. putida, Salmonella typhimurium, and Staphylococcus aureus were exposed to the purified peptide but showed no significant killing. However, electroporation of Hok (200 microgml(-1)) into E. coli cells showed a dramatic reduction (100000-fold) in the number of cells transformed with plasmid DNA which indicates that the synthetic Hok peptide killed cells. Electroporation of Hok into P. putida was also very effective with a 500-fold reduction in electrocompetent cells (100 microgml(-1)). Heat shock in the presence of Hok (380 microgml(-1)) resulted in a 5-fold reduction in E. coli cells but had no effect on B. subtilis. In addition, three Hok fragments (Hok(1-28), Hok(31-52) and Hok(16-52)) killed cells when electroporated into E. coli at 200 microgml(-1) (over 1000-fold killing for Hok(1-28), 50-fold killing for Hok(16-52) and over 1000-fold killing for Hok(31-52)). E. coli cells electroporated with Hok and visualized using transmission electron microscopy showed the same morphological changes as control cells to which Hok was induced using a plasmid inside the cell.
TI  - Nosocomial infections caused by multidrug-resistant isolates of pseudomonas putida producing VIM-1 metallo-beta-lactamase.
AB  - Successful carbapenem-based chemotherapy for the treatment of Pseudomonas infections has been seriously hindered by the recent appearance of IMP- and VIM-type metallo-beta-lactamases, which confer high-level resistance to carbapenems and most other beta-lactams. Recently, multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas putida isolates for which carbapenem MICs were >/=32 micro g/ml were recovered from cultures of urine from three inpatients in the general intensive care unit of the Ospedale di Circolo, Varese, Italy. Enzyme assays revealed production of a metallo-beta-lactamase activity, while molecular analysis detected in each isolate a bla(VIM-1) determinant carried by an apparently identical medium-sized plasmid. Conjugation experiments were unsuccessful in transferring the beta-lactamase determinant to Escherichia coli or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Macrorestriction analysis by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis demonstrated that the isolates were of clonal origin. PCR mapping and sequencing of the variable region of the plasmid-borne class 1 integron carrying the bla(VIM-1) determinant (named In110) showed that the bla(VIM-1)-containing cassette was identical to that previously found in strains of different species from other Italian hospitals and that the cassette array of In110 was not identical but clearly related to that of In70 (a bla(VIM-1)-containing plasmid-borne integron from an Achromobacter xylosoxidans isolate), pointing to a common origin of this cassette and to a related evolutionary history of their cognate integrons.
TI  - Identification and broad dissemination of the CTX-M-14 beta-lactamase in different Escherichia coli strains in the northwest area of Spain.
AB  - During the course of a molecular epidemiology study of mechanisms of antibiotic resistance in the area served by our hospital (516,000 inhabitants), we isolated the gene encoding CTX-M-14 beta-lactamase. Thirty clinical strains (27 Escherichia coli and 3 Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates) with a phenotype of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase were collected from January to October 2001 and studied for the presence of the CTX-M-14 beta- lactamase gene. By isoelectric point determination, PCR, and nucleotide sequencing, we detected the presence of this gene in 17 E. coli strains belonging to 15 different genotypes (REP-PCR) causing infections in 17 different patients. Epidemiological studies based on medical records did not suggest any relationship between the patients infected with these E. coli strains and, interestingly, 7 of 30 patients harboring strains with extended-spectrum beta-lactamases never had contact with the hospital environment before the clinical E. coli isolation. Conjugation experiments revealed that this gene was plasmid mediated in the 17 E. coli strains, and plasmid restriction fragment length polymorphisms showed 9 different patterns in the 17 E. coli strains. By PCR, the sequence of the tnpA transposase gene of the insert sequence ISEcp-1 was detected in all the plasmids harboring the CTX-M-14 gene. These results strongly suggest that plasmid dissemination between different E. coli strains in addition to a mobile element (transposon) around the beta-lactamase gene may be involved in the spreading of the CTX-M-14 gene. This study reinforces the hypothesis that the epidemiology of the prevalence of the beta-lactamase genes is changing and should alert the medical community to the increase in the emergence of the CTX-M beta-lactamases worldwide.
TI  - Two dnaB genes are associated with the origin of replication of pQBR55, an exogenously isolated plasmid from the rhizosphere of sugar beet.
AB  - Plasmid pQBR55 ( approximately 149 kb) represents one of five (Groups I-V) genetically distinct transfer proficient, mercury resistance plasmid groups that have been observed in the phytosphere pseudomonad community at a single geographic location in Oxford, UK. A 4.9-kb HindIII fragment was cloned from pQBR55 (a Group III plasmid) that facilitates autonomous replication of a narrow host range cloning vector, pKIL29, in the non-permissive host Pseudomonas putida UWC1. Sequencing revealed that the fragment contains a unique tandem array of dnaB genes (one partial and one complete), a homologue of the traA gene of plasmid RP4 and several potential open reading frames with little homology to any known sequences. The fragment also contains: a short region of direct and indirect repeats, two sequences that resemble the consensus Escherichia coli DnaA box motif, an A+T rich region and evidence of a GC-skew inversion. All features associated with origins of replication. Two specific oligonucleotide primer pairs, one targeted at the tandem dnaB genes and the other at the dnaB-traA arrangement were used for PCR analysis of other plasmids isolated from the same field site. PCR generated amplification products were only amplified from Group III plasmids (defined by RFLP typing) but not from plasmids belonging to Group I, II, IV or V. The nucleotide sequences of the amplified fragments were identical to those of pQBR55, even though the other Group III plasmids had distinct RFLP patterns. The results of a more general PCR screen, using primers to amplify a 389-bp fragment of all described pseudomonad dnaB genes, suggests that closely related dnaB sequences are only associated with Group III plasmids.
TI  - The crystal structure of YdcE, a 4-oxalocrotonate tautomerase homologue from Escherichia coli, confirms the structural basis for oligomer diversity.
AB  - The tautomerase superfamily consists of three major families represented by 4-oxalocrotonate tautomerase (4-OT), 5-(carboxymethyl)-2-hydroxymuconate isomerase (CHMI), and macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF). The members of this superfamily are structurally homologous proteins constructed from a simple beta-alpha-beta fold that share a key mechanistic feature; they use an amino-terminal proline, which has an unusually low pK(a), as the general base in a keto-enol tautomerization. Several new members of the 4-OT family have now been identified using PSI-BLAST and categorized into five subfamilies on the basis of multiple-sequence alignments and the conservation of key catalytic and structural residues. The members of subfamily 5, which includes a hypothetical protein designated YdcE from Escherichia coli, are predicted not to form hexamers. The crystal structure of YdcE has been determined to 1.35 A resolution and confirms that it is a dimer. In addition, YdcE complexed with (E)-2-fluoro-p-hydroxycinnamate, identified as a potent competitive inhibitor of this enzyme, as well as N-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-N'-2-ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) and benzoate are also presented. These latter crystal structures reveal the location of the active site and suggest a mechanism for the observed YdcE-catalyzed tautomerization reaction. The dimeric arrangement of YdcE represents a new structure in the 4-OT family and demonstrates structural diversity within the 4-OT family not previously reported.
TI  - Differences in attachment of Salmonella enterica serovars and Escherichia coli O157:H7 to alfalfa sprouts.
AB  - Numerous Salmonella enterica and Escherichia coli O157:H7 outbreaks have been associated with contaminated sprouts. We examined how S. enterica serovars, E. coli serotypes, and nonpathogenic bacteria isolated from alfalfa sprouts grow on and adhere to alfalfa sprouts. Growth on and adherence to sprouts were not significantly different among different serovars of S. enterica, but all S. enterica serovars grew on and adhered to alfalfa sprouts significantly better than E. coli O157:H7. E. coli O157:H7 was essentially rinsed from alfalfa sprouts with repeated washing steps, while 1 to 2 log CFU of S. enterica remained attached per sprout. S. enterica Newport adhered to 3-day-old sprouts as well as Pantoea agglomerans and 10-fold more than Pseudomonas putida and Rahnella aquatilis, whereas the growth rates of all four strains throughout seed sprouting were similar. S. enterica Newport and plant-associated bacteria adhered 10- to 1,000-fold more than E. coli O157:H7; however, three of four other E. coli serotypes, isolated from cabbage roots exposed to sewage water following a spill, adhered to sprouts better than E. coli O157:H7 and as well as the Pseudomonas and Rahnella strains. Therefore, attachment to alfalfa sprouts among E. coli serotypes is variable, and nonpathogenic strains of E. coli to be used as surrogates for the study of pathogenic E. coli may be difficult to identify and should be selected carefully, with knowledge of the biology being examined.
TI  - Isonitrile hydratase from Pseudomonas putida N19-2. Cloning, sequencing, gene expression, and identification of its active acid residue.
AB  - Isonitrile hydratase is a novel enzyme in Pseudomonas putida N19-2 that catalyzes the conversion of isonitriles to N-substituted formamides. Based on N-terminal and internal amino acid sequences, a 535-bp DNA fragment corresponding to a portion of the isonitrile hydratase gene was amplified, which was used as a probe to clone a 6.4-kb DNA fragment containing the whole gene. Sequence analysis of the 6.4-kb fragment revealed that the isonitrile hydratase gene (inhA) was 684 nucleotides long and encoded a protein with a molecular mass of 24,211 Da. Overexpression of inhA in Escherichia coli gave a large amount of soluble isonitrile hydratase exhibiting the same molecular and catalytic properties as the native enzyme from the Pseudomonas strain. The predicted amino acid sequence of inhA showed low similarity to that of an intracellular protease in Pyrococcus horikoshii (PH1704), and an active cysteine residue in the protease was conserved in the isonitrile hydratase at the corresponding position (Cys-101). A mutant enzyme containing Ala instead of Cys-101 did not exhibit isonitrile hydratase activity at all, demonstrating the essential role of this residue in the catalytic function.
TI  - Intermolecular electron transfer in cytochrome P450cam covalently bound with Tris(2,2'-bipyridyl)ruthenium(II): structural changes detected by FTIR spectroscopy.
AB  - Using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) we have monitored the changes in the protein structure following photoinduced electron transfer from Ru(bpy)(3)(2+) covalently attached to cysteine 334 on the surface of cytochrome P450cam (CYP101). The FTIR difference spectra between the oxidized and reduced form indicate changes in a salt link and the secondary structure (alpha-helix and turn regions). Photoreduction was carried out in the presence of carbon monoxide in order to prove the reduction of the heme iron by means of the appearance of the characteristic CO stretch vibration infrared band at 1940 cm(-1) for the camphor-bound protein. This infrared band has also been used to estimate electron transfer rates. The observed rates depend on the protein concentration, indicating that intermolecular electron transfer occurs between the labeled molecules.
TI  - Spectroscopic studies of peroxyacetic acid reaction intermediates of cytochrome P450cam and chloroperoxidase.
AB  - It is generally assumed that the putative compound I (cpd I) in cytochrome P450 should contain the same electron and spin distribution as is observed for cpd I of peroxidases and catalases and many synthetic cpd I analogues. In these systems one oxidation equivalent resides on the Fe(IV)=O unit (d(4), S=1) and one is located on the porphyrin (S'=1/2), constituting a magnetically coupled ferryl iron-oxo porphyrin pi-cation radical system. However, this laboratory has recently reported detection of a ferryl iron (S=1) and a tyrosyl radical (S'=1/2), via Mossbauer and EPR studies of 8 ms-reaction intermediates of substrate-free P450cam from Pseudomonas putida, prepared by a freeze-quench method using peroxyacetic acid as the oxidizing agent [Schunemann et al., FEBS Lett. 479 (2000) 149]. In the present study we show that under the same reaction conditions, but in the presence of the substrate camphor, only trace amounts of the tyrosine radical are formed and no Fe(IV) is detectable. We conclude that camphor restricts the access of the heme pocket by peroxyacetic acid. This conclusion is supported by the additional finding that binding of camphor and metyrapone inhibit heme bleaching at room temperature and longer reaction times, forming only trace amounts of 5-hydroxy-camphor, the hydroxylation product of camphor, during peroxyacetic acid oxidation. As a control we performed freeze-quench experiments with chloroperoxidase from Caldariomyces fumago using peroxyacetic acid under the identical conditions used for the substrate-free P450cam oxidations. We were able to confirm earlier findings [Rutter et al., Biochemistry 23 (1984) 6809], that an antiferromagnetically coupled Fe(IV)=O porphyrin pi-cation radical system is formed. We conclude that CPO and P450 behave differently when reacting with peracids during an 8-ms reaction time. In P450cam the formation of Fe(IV) is accompanied by the formation of a tyrosine radical, whereas in CPO Fe(IV) formation is accompanied by the formation of a porphyrin radical.
TI  - Alkane biodegradation in Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains isolated from a polluted  zone: identification of alkB and alkB-related genes.
AB  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains that grow on crude oil as the sole source of carbon and energy were isolated from an environment in Morocco polluted by petroleum refinery effluents. The twenty isolates grew on saturated alkanes from C12 to C22. Three of the isolates were also able to grow on low molecular weight C6 to C10 n-alkanes, but the other 17 strains were not. The strains were tested for alkB and a/kB-related genes encoding alkane-1-monooxygenase (alkane hydroxylase). Oligonucleotide primers specific for the alkB gene of strain P. putida (GPo1 ) and for the alkB1 and alkB2 genes of P. aeruginosa strain PAO1 allowed amplification from the P. aeruginosa isolates of fragments similar to alkB1 and alkB2 genes of strain PAO1. Only 3 strains carried an alkB gene very similar to that of strain GPo1, and these strains were the same ones that could utilise C6 to C10 n-alkanes.
TI  - Multiple bacteria encode metallothioneins and SmtA-like zinc fingers.
AB  - Zinc is essential but toxic in excess. Bacterial metallothionein, SmtA from Synechococcus PCC 7942, sequesters and detoxifies four zinc ions per molecule and contains a zinc finger structurally similar to eukaryotic GATA. The dearth of other reported bacterial metallothioneins has been surprising. Here we describe related bacterial metallothioneins (BmtA) from Anabaena PCC 7120, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas putida that bind multiple zinc ions with high stability towards protons. Thiol modification demonstrates that cysteine coordinates zinc in all of these proteins. Additionally, (111)Cd-NMR, and (111)Cd-edited (1)H-NMR, identified histidine ligands in Anabaena PCC 7120 BmtA, analogous to SmtA. A related Escherichia coli protein bound only a single zinc ion, via four cysteine residues, with low stability towards protons; (111)Cd-NMR and (111)Cd-edited (1)H-NMR confirmed exclusive cysteine-coordination, and these cysteine residues reacted rapidly with 5,5'-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid). (1)H-NMR of proteins from P. aeruginosa, Anabaena PCC 7120 and E. coli generated fingerprints diagnostic for the GATA-like zinc finger fold of SmtA. These studies reveal first the existence of multiple bacterial metallothioneins, and second proteins with SmtA-like lone zinc fingers, devoid of a cluster,and designated GatA. We have identified 12 smtA-like genes in sequence databases including four of the gatA type.
TI  - Biochemical characterization of the Pseudomonas putida 3-hydroxyacyl ACP:CoA transacylase, which diverts intermediates of fatty acid de novo biosynthesis.
AB  - The 3-hydroxyacyl ACP:CoA transacylase (PhaG) was recently identified in various  Pseudomonas species and catalyzes the diversion of ACP thioester intermediates of fatty acid de novo biosynthesis toward the respective CoA thioesters, which serve as precursors for polyester and rhamnolipid biosynthesis. PhaG from Pseudomonas putida was overproduced in Escherichia coli as a C-terminal hexahistidine-tagged (His(6)) fusion protein in high yield. The His(6)-PhaG was purified to homogeneity by refolding of PhaG obtained from inclusion bodies, and a new enzyme assay was established. Kinetic analysis of the 3-hydroxyacyl transfer to ACP, catalyzed by His(6)-PhaG, gave K(0.5) values of 28 microm (ACP) and 65 microm (3-hydroxyacyl-CoA) considering V(max) values of 11.7 milliunits/mg and 12.4 milliunits/mg, respectively. A Hill coefficient of 1.38 (ACP) and 1.32 (3-hydroxyacyl-CoA) indicated a positive substrate cooperativity. Subcellular localization studies showed that PhaG is not attached to polyester granules and resides in the cytosol. Gel filtration chromatography analysis in combination with light scattering analysis indicated substrate-induced dimerization of the transacylase. A threading model of PhaG was developed based on the homology to an epoxide hydrolase (1cqz). In addition, the alignment with the alpha/beta-hydrolase fold region indicated that PhaG belongs to alpha/beta-hydrolase superfamily. Accordingly, CD analysis suggested a secondary structure composition of 29% alpha-helix, 22% beta-sheet, 18% beta-turn, and 31% random coil. Site-specific mutagenesis of seven highly conserved amino acid residues (Asp-60, Ser-102, His-177, Asp-182, His-192, Asp-223, His-251) was used to validate the protein model and to investigate organization of the transacylase active site. Only the D182(A/E) mutation was permissive with about 30% specific activity of the wild type enzyme. Furthermore, this mutation caused a change in substrate specificity, indicating a functional role in substrate binding. The serine-specific agent phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) or the histidine-specific agent diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC) caused inhibition of 3-hydroxyacyl transfer to holo-ACP, and the S102(A/T) or H251(A/R) PhaG mutant was incapable of catalyzing 3-hydroxyacyl transfer, suggesting that these residues are part of a catalytic triad.
TI  - Hydroxyectoine is superior to trehalose for anhydrobiotic engineering of Pseudomonas putida KT2440.
AB  - Anhydrobiotic engineering aims to increase the level of desiccation tolerance in  sensitive organisms to that observed in true anhydrobiotes. In addition to a suitable extracellular drying excipient, a key factor for anhydrobiotic engineering of gram-negative enterobacteria seems to be the generation of high intracellular concentrations of the nonreducing disaccharide trehalose, which can be achieved by osmotic induction. In the soil bacterium Pseudomonas putida KT2440, however, only limited amounts of trehalose are naturally accumulated in defined high-osmolarity medium, correlating with relatively poor survival of desiccated cultures. Based on the enterobacterial model, it was proposed that increasing intracellular trehalose concentration in P. putida KT2440 should improve survival. Using genetic engineering techniques, intracellular trehalose concentrations were obtained which were similar to or greater than those in enterobacteria, but this did not translate into improved desiccation tolerance. Therefore, at least for some populations of microorganisms, trehalose does not appear to provide full protection against desiccation damage, even when present at high concentrations both inside and outside the cell. For P. putida KT2440, it was shown that this was not due to a natural limit in desiccation tolerance since successful anhydrobiotic engineering was achieved by use of a different drying excipient, hydroxyectoine, with osmotically preconditioned bacteria for which 40 to 60% viability was maintained over extended periods (up to 42 days) in the dry state. Hydroxyectoine therefore has considerable potential for the improvement of desiccation tolerance in sensitive microorganisms, particularly for those recalcitrant to trehalose.
TI  - Plant growth-promoting Pseudomonas putida WCS358 produces and secretes four cyclic dipeptides: cross-talk with quorum sensing bacterial sensors.
AB  - The most universal cell-cell signaling mechanism in Gram-negative bacteria occurs via the production and response to a class of small diffusible molecules called N-acylhomoserine lactones (AHLs). This communication is called quorum sensing and is responsible for the regulation of several physiological processes and many virulence factors in pathogenic bacteria. The detection of these molecules has been rendered possible by the utilization of genetically engineered bacterial biosensors which respond to the presence of exogenously supplied AHLs. In this study, using diverse bacterial biosensors, several biosensor activating fractions were purified by organic extraction, HPLC and TLC of cell-free culture supernatants of plant growth-promoting Pseudomonas putida WCS358. Surprisingly, it was observed that the most abundant compounds in these fractions were cyclic dipeptides (diketopiperazines, DKPs), a rather novel finding in Gram-negative bacteria. The purification, characterization, chemical synthesis of four DKPs are reported and their possible role in cell-cell signaling is discussed.
TI  - Aerobic metabolism of phenylacetic acids in Azoarcus evansii.
AB  - The aerobic metabolism of phenylacetic acid (PA) and 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (4-OHPA) was investigated in the beta-proteobacterium Azoarcus evansii. Evidence for the existence of two independent catabolic pathways for PA and 4-OHPA is presented. 4-OHPA metabolism involves the formation of 2,5-dihydroxyphenylacetate (homogentisate) and maleylacetoacetate catalyzed by specifically induced 4-OHPA 1-monooxygenase and homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase. The metabolism of PA starts by its activation to phenylacetyl-CoA (PA-CoA) via an aerobically induced phenylacetate-coenzyme A ligase. Phenylalanine (Phe) aerobic metabolism in this bacterium proceeds also via PA and PA-CoA. Whole cells of A. evansii transformed [1-(14)C]PA to (14)C-phenylacetyl-CoA and subsequently to a number of unknown labeled products, which were also observed in PA-degrading bacteria from different phylogenetic groups, i.e. Escherichia coli, Rhodopseudomonas palustrisand Bacillus stearothermophilus. A chromosomal region from A. evansiiof 11.5 kb containing a cluster of 11 phenylacetic acid catabolic ( paa) genes ( paaYZGHIKABCDE) was sequenced and characterized. The derived gene products were similar to the characterized putative gene products involved in PA catabolism in E. coli and Pseudomonas putida and to other putative PA catabolic gene products of diverse bacteria. RT-PCR analysis of the paa genes of A. evansiigrowing aerobically with PA showed a probable organization of the paa genes in three operons. The similarity of the PA metabolic products pattern and of gene sequences suggests a common aerobic bacterial PA pathway.
TI  - Survival of an Aeromonas hydrophila in an artificial mineral water microcosm.
AB  - The survival capacity of an Aeromonas hydrophila strain (named SB14) isolated from mineral water was investigated in an artificial mineral water microcosm. The bacterial count of this microorganism was compared with two strains of other species from aquatic environments (Pseudomonas fluorescens SSD and Pseudomonas putida SSC) and a bacterium indicative of faecal pollution (Escherichia coli ATCC 25922). Among the strains, all added to sterile Pyrex glass flasks (1 l) to yield a final bacterial count of about 5 x 10(6) CFU/ml, A. hydrophila SB14 showed a quite strong survival capacity (150 days), even though the Pseudomonas strains were better adapted to this habitat (more than 240 days). E. coli ATCC 25922 was the least well fitted to survive and was no longer detected after 70 days. When A. hydrophila SB14 was inoculated together with one or two of the above strains, its survival appeared to be dependent on interaction with other organisms. A marked decrease in survival by 30 days, possibly due to antagonistic interaction, was observed when this microorganism was associated with E. coli ATCC 25922, and an increase by 30 and 60 days, possibly due to commensalic interaction, was obtained when A. hydrophila SB14 was inoculated with P. fluorescens SSD or P. putida SSC, respectively.
TI  - Molecular analysis of aerobic phenylacetate degradation in Azoarcus evansii.
AB  - The Azoarcus evansii gene which codes for phenylacetate-CoA ligase, an enzyme involved in the aerobic degradation of phenylacetate, was isolated from a genomic library, using as the probe a fragment of the gene which encodes the isoenzyme that is induced under anaerobic conditions. By this means both the gene and its flanking sequences were recovered. The gene is homologous to the phenylacetate-CoA ligase genes of Pseudomonas putida U and Escherichia coli W. Induction by phenylacetate under aerobic growth conditions was demonstrated using lacZ fusions. Western analysis showed that phenylacetate-CoA ligase is involved in the degradation of the aromatic amino acid phenylalanine. Genes coding for the phenylacetate-CoA ligase and for the putative hydroxylating enzyme were expressed in E. coli. Detection of 2-hydroxyphenylacetate in the recombinant E. coli strain indicated hydroxylation of phenylacetyl-CoA. The gene pacL, which codes for the putative ring-opening enzyme was mutated to enable the isolation of intermediates in aerobic phenylacetic acid degradation, which were characterized by GC-MS and NMR analyses.
TI  - Site-specific recombination system encoded by toluene catabolic transposon Tn4651.
AB  - The 56-kb class II toluene catabolic transposon Tn4651 from Pseudomonas putida plasmid pWW0 is unique in that (i) its efficient resolution requires, in addition to the 0.2-kb resolution (res) site, the two gene products TnpS and TnpT and (ii) the 2.4-kb tnpT-res-tnpS region is 48 kb apart from the tnpA gene (M. Tsuda, K.-I. Minegishi, and T. Iino, J. Bacteriol. 171:1386-1393, 1989). Detailed analysis of the 2.4-kb region revealed that the tnpS and tnpT genes encoding the putative 323- and 332-amino-acid proteins, respectively, were transcribed divergently with an overlapping 59-bp sequence in the 203-bp res site. The motifs (the R-H-R-Y tetrad in domains I and II with proper spacing) commonly conserved in the integrase family of site-specific recombinases were found in TnpS. In contrast, TnpT did not show any significant amino acid sequence homology to the other proteins that are directly or indirectly involved in recombination. Analysis of site-specific recombination under the Escherichia coli recA cells indicated that (i) the site-specific resolution between the two copies of the res site on a single molecule was catalyzed by TnpS, (ii) the functional res site was located within a 95-bp segment, and (iii) TnpT appeared to have the role of enhancing the site-specific resolution. It was also found that TnpS catalyzed the site-specific recombination between the res sites located at two different molecules to form a cointegrate molecule. Site-specific mutagenesis of the conserved tyrosine residue in TnpS led to the loss of both the resolution and the integration activities, indicating that such a residue took part in both types of recombination.
TI  - Tolerance of bacteria to organic solvents.
AB  - Organic-solvent-tolerant bacteria are a relatively novel group of extremophilic microorganisms. They overcome the toxic and destructive effects of organic solvents due to the presence of various adaptive mechanisms. Extensive studies done on the toluene tolerance of certain Pseudomonas strains have led to an understanding of the mechanisms of organic solvent tolerance involving novel adaptations such as the toluene efflux pumps, cis-trans isomerisation of membrane fatty acids, rapid membrane repair mechanisms, etc. Organic-solvent-tolerant mutants of Escherichia coli have been constructed and genes enhancing such tolerance characterised. However, there is practically no information available on the tolerance mechanisms of the reported Gram-positive organic-solvent-tolerant bacterial strains like Bacillus, Rhodococcus and Arthrobacter. This review discusses the general aspects of organic-solvent-tolerant bacteria, their history, biodiversity, mechanisms of tolerance and proposes certain probable adaptations of Gram-positive bacteria in tolerance to organic solvents.
TI  - Mechanisms of solvent tolerance in gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Organic solvents can be toxic to microorganisms, depending on the inherent toxicity of the solvent and the intrinsic tolerance of the bacterial species and strains. The toxicity of a given solvent correlates with the logarithm of its partition coefficient in n-octanol and water (log Pow). Organic solvents with a log Pow between 1.5 and 4.0 are extremely toxic for microorganisms and other living cells because they partition preferentially in the cytoplasmic membrane, disorganizing its structure and impairing vital functions. Several possible mechanisms leading to solvent-tolerance in gram-negative bacteria have been proposed: (a) adaptive alterations of the membrane fatty acids and phospholipid headgroup composition, (b) formation of vesicles loaded with toxic compounds, and (c) energy-dependent active efflux pumps belonging to the resistance-nodulation-cell division (RND) family, which export toxic organic solvents to the external medium. In these mechanisms, changes in the phospholipid profile and extrusion of the solvents seem to be shared by different strains. The most significant changes in phospholipids are an increase in the melting temperature of the membranes by rapid cis-to-trans isomerization of unsaturated fatty acids and modifications in the phospholipid headgroups. Toluene efflux pumps are involved in solvent tolerance in several gram-negative strains, e.g., Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas putida, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The AcrAB-TolC and AcrEF-TolC efflux pumps are important for n-hexane tolerance in E. coli. A number of P. putida strains have been isolated that tolerate toxic hydrocarbons such as toluene, styrene, and p-xylene. At least three efflux pumps (TtgABC, TtgDEF, and TtgGHI) are present in the most extensively characterized solvent-tolerant strain, P. putida DOT-T1E, and the number of efflux pumps has been found to correlate with the degree of solvent tolerance in different P. putida strains. The operation of these efflux pumps seems to be coupled to the proton motive force via the TonB system, although the intimate mechanism of energy transfer remains elusive. Specific and global regulators control the expression of the efflux pump operons of E. coli and P. putida at the transcriptional level.
TI  - The role of the fatty acid beta-oxidation multienzyme complex from Pseudomonas oleovorans in polyhydroxyalkanoate biosynthesis: molecular characterization of the fadBA operon from P. oleovorans and of the enoyl-CoA hydratase genes phaJ from P. oleovorans and Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - In order to investigate the role of the putative epimerase function of the beta-oxidation multienzyme complex (FadBA) in the provision of (R)-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA thioesters for medium-chain-length polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA(MCL)) biosynthesis, the fadBA(Po) operon of Pseudomonas oleovorans was cloned and characterized. The fadBA(Po) operon and a class-II PHA synthase gene of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were heterologously co-expressed in Escherichia coli to determine whether the putative epimerase function of FadBA(Po) has the ability to provide precursors for PHA accumulation in a non-PHA-accumulating bacterium. Cultivation studies with fatty acids as carbon source revealed that FadBA(Po) did not mediate PHA(MCL) biosynthesis in the E. coli wild-type strain harboring a PHA synthase gene. However, PHA accumulation was strongly impaired in a recombinant E. coli fadB mutant, which harbored a PHA synthase gene. These data indicate that in pseudomonads FadBA does not possess the inherent property, based on a putative epimerase function, to provide the ( R)-enantiomer of 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA efficiently and that other linking enzymes are required to efficiently channel intermediates of beta-oxidation towards PHA(MCL) biosynthesis. However, the phaJ gene from P. oleovorans and from Pseudomonas putida, both of which encoded a 3- Re enoyl-CoA hydratase, was identified. The co-expression of phaJ(Po/Pp) with either a class-II PHA synthase gene or the PHA synthase gene from Aeromonas punctata in E. coli revealed that PhaJ(Po/Pp) mediated biosynthesis of either PHA(MCL), contributing to about 1% of cellular dry mass, or of poly(3-hydroxybutyrate- co-3-hydroxyhexanoate), contributing to 3.6% of cellular dry mass, when grown on decanoate. These data indicate that FadBA(Po)does not mediate the provision of (R)-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA, which resembles FadBA of non-PHA-accumulating bacteria, and that 3- Re enoyl-CoA hydratases are required to divert intermediates of fatty acid beta-oxidation towards PHA biosynthesis in P. oleovorans.
TI  - Plant-specific promoter sequences carry elements that are recognised by the eubacterial transcription machinery.
AB  - During evolution the promoter elements from prokaryotes and eukaryotes have developed differently with regard to their sequence and structure, implying that in general a transfer of eukaryotic promoter sequences into prokaryotes will not cause an efficient gene expression. However, there have been reports on the functionality of the 35S promoter from cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) in bacteria. We therefore decided to experimentally investigate the capability of plant promoter sequences to direct gene expression in various bacteria. Accordingly, we tested ten different plant-specific promoters from Solanum tuberosum, Nicotiana tabacum, CaMV, Agrobacterium tumefaciens, and A. rhizogenes for their ability to initiate transcription in five different eubacterial species (Escherichia coli, Yersinia enterocolitica, A. tumefaciens, Pseudomonas putida, and Acinetobacter sp. BD413). To monitor the strength of the plant-specific promoters in bacteria we created fusions between these promoters and the coding region of the luciferase genes from Vibrio harveyi and measured the luminescence in the bacteria. Heterologous gene expression was observed in 50% of the combinations analysed. We then mapped the transcription start site caused by one of the plant-specific promoters, the ST-LS1 promoter from S. tuberosum, in these bacterial species. The location of the mapped transcription start site indicated that the sequences of the plant promoter themselves were recognised by the bacterial transcription apparatus. The recognition of plant-specific promoter sequences by the bacterial RNA polymerase was further confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis of the ST-LS1 promoter and the analysis of the effects of the mutations on the strength of gene expression in E. coli. Using these mutants in our reporter assays we could localise the sequences of the ST-LS1 promoter serving as -10 region in E. coli. The results of our study show that promoter sequences are much less specific than is generally assumed. This is of great importance for our knowledge about the evolution of gene expression systems and for the construction of optimised expression vectors.
TI  - Reactivity of toluate dioxygenase with substituted benzoates and dioxygen.
AB  - Toluate dioxygenase (TADO) of Pseudomonas putida mt-2 catalyzes the dihydroxylation of a broad range of substituted benzoates. The two components of this enzyme were hyperexpressed and anaerobically purified. Reconstituted TADO had a specific activity of 3.8 U/mg with m-toluate, and each component had a full complement of their respective Fe(2)S(2) centers. Steady-state kinetics data obtained by using an oxygraph assay and by varying the toluate and dioxygen concentrations were analyzed by a compulsory order ternary complex mechanism. TADO had greatest specificity for m-toluate, displaying apparent parameters of KmA = 9 +/- 1 microM, k(cat) = 3.9 +/- 0.2 s(-1), and K(m)O(2) = 16 +/- 2 microM (100 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.0; 25 degrees C), where K(m)O(2) represents the K(m) for O(2) and KmA represents the K(m) for the aromatic substrate. The enzyme utilized benzoates in the following order of specificity: m-toluate > benzoate approximately 3-chlorobenzoate > p-toluate approximately 4-chlorobenzoate >> o-toluate approximately 2-chlorobenzoate. The transformation of each of the first five compounds was well coupled to O(2) utilization and yielded the corresponding 1,2-cis-dihydrodiol. In contrast, the transformation of ortho-substituted benzoates was poorly coupled to O(2) utilization, with >10 times more O(2) being consumed than benzoate. However, the apparent K(m) of TADO for these benzoates was >100 microM, indicating that they do not effectively inhibit the turnover of good substrates.
TI  - Sequence analysis and molecular characterization of a nitrocatechol dioxygenase gene from Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - A Pseudomonas putida capable of degrading polychlorinated biphenyl was also found to transform 4-nitrocatechol to 3-nitro-2-hydroxy-6-oxohexa-2,4-dienoic acid (NHODA). Crude cell extract of this bacterium exhibited an enzyme (nitrocatechol dioxygenase, Ndo) activity catalyzing this transformation. The gene encoding Ndo was cloned in E. coli. The cloned gene (ndo) expressed in E. coli had enzyme activity that degraded not only 4-nitrocatechol but also 4-chlorocatechol, 4-methylcatechol, 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl, and 4'-chloro-2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the cloned ndo exhibited an open reading frame of 939 base pairs. This sequence can encode a 313 amino acids protein of approximately molecular weight of 35 kd, which was confirmed by in vitro transcription and translation assay and SDS-PAGE analysis. A putative ribosomal binding site (GAGGAGA) was present 7 base pairs upstream from the AUG start codon and a promotor site homologous to E. coli '-10' and '-35' regulatory region was located at '-123' and '-174' area of our clone with sequences of TTGAAG and GTGACA, respectively. The deduced amino acid sequence showed 69% homology with Cdo from Burkholderia cepacia AAI. A unique insertion of 21 amino acids was found towards the N-terminal of the Ndo. Expression of ndo in strain OU83 was repressed in presence of 3-chlorobenzoic acid as judged by the decrease in the expression of ndo specific transcript.
TI  - Application of metabolic engineering to improve both the production and use of biotech indigo.
AB  - A fermentation process was developed for production of indigo from glucose using  recombinant Escherichia coli. This was achieved by modifying the tryptophan pathway to cause high-level indole production and adding the Pseudomonas putida genes encoding naphthalene dioxygenase (NDO). In comparison to a tryptophan-over-producing strain, the first indigo-producing strain made less than half of the expected amount of indigo. Severe inactivation of the first enzyme of aromatic biosynthesis, 3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate (DAHP) synthase (the aroGfbr gene product), was observed in cells collected from indigo fermentations. Subsequent in vitro experiments revealed that DAHP synthase was inactivated by exposure to the spontaneous chemical conversion of indoxyl to indigo. Indigo production was thereafter improved by increasing the gene dosage of aroGfbr or by increasing substrate availability to DAHP synthase in vivo by either amplifying the tktA (transketolase) gene or inactivating both isozymes of pyruvate kinase. By combining all three strategies for enhancing DAHP formation in the cell, a 60% increase in indigo production was achieved. Metabolic engineering was then further applied to eliminate a byproduct of the spontaneous conversion of indoxyl to indigo, thereby solving a serious problem with the use of bio-indigo in the final denim dyeing application.
TI  - [Yearly changes in antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates between 1996 and 2000--II. Gram-negative bacteria].
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2000 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, and carbapenems. Thirty-two species 2,697 strains of Gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from January to December, and consisted of Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis (n = 125), Escherichia coli (n = 250), Citrobacter freundii (n = 153), Citrobacter koseri (n = 97), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 150), Klebsiella oxytoca (n = 100), Enterobacter aerogenes (n = 50), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 125), Serratia marcescens (n = 153), Proteus mirabillis (n = 103), Proteus vulgaris (n = 77), Morganella morganii (n = 141), Providencia spp. (P. alcalifaciens, P. rettgeri, P. stuartii; n = 154), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 211), Pseudomonas putida (n = 49), Burkholderia cepacia (n = 102), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 101), Haemophilus influenzae (n = 210), Acinetobactor baumannii (n = 63), Acinetobactor Iwoffii (n = 30), Bacteroides fragilis group (B. fragilis, B. vulgatus, B. distasonis, B. ovatus, B. thetaiotaomicron; n = 129), and Prevotella spp. (P. melaninogenica, P. intermedia, P. bivia, P. oralis, P. denticola; n = 124). CZOP possessed stable antibacterial activities against M. (B.) catarrhalis, E. coli, C. freundii, C. koseri, K. pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, E. aerogenes, E. cloacae, S. marcescens, P. mirabilis, P. vulgaris, M. morganii, Providencia spp., P. aeruginosa, and A. lowffii throughout 5 years. The MIC90 of CZOP against those strains were consistent with those obtained from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. On the other hand, the MIC90 of CZOP against H. influenzae yearly obviously increased with approximately 65-time difference during study period. The MIC90 of cefpirome, cefepime, and flomoxef against H. influenzae also yearly tended to rise. The present results demonstrated that CZOP had maintained the antibacterial activity against almost Gram-negative strains tested. However, the decrease in the antibacterial activity of CZOP against H. influenzae was suggested.
TI  - The 4-oxalocrotonate tautomerase family of enzymes: how nature makes new enzymes  using a beta-alpha-beta structural motif.
AB  - 4-Oxalocrotonate tautomerase (4-OT) catalyzes the isomerization of beta,gamma-unsaturated enones to their alpha,beta-isomers. The enzyme is part of a plasmid-encoded pathway, which enables bacteria harboring the plasmid to use various aromatic hydrocarbons as their sole sources of carbon and energy. Among isomerases and enzymes in general, 4-OT is unusual for two reasons: it has one of the smallest known monomer sizes (62 amino acids) and the amino-terminal proline functions as the catalytic base. In addition to Pro-1, three other residues (Arg-11, Arg-39, and Phe-50) have been identified as critical catalytic residues by kinetic analysis, site-directed mutagenesis, chemical synthesis, NMR, and crystallographic studies. Arginine-39 functions as the general acid catalyst (assisted by an ordered water molecule) in the reaction while Arg-11 plays a role in substrate binding and facilitates catalysis by acting as an electron sink. Finally, the hydrophobic nature of the active site, which lowers the pK(a) of Pro-1 to approximately 6.4 and provides a favorable environment for catalysis, is largely maintained by Phe-50. 4-OT is also the title enzyme of the 4-OT family of enzymes. The chromosomal homologues in this family are composed of monomers ranging in size from 61 to 79 amino acids, which code a beta-alpha-beta structural motif. The homologues all retain Pro-1 and generally have an aromatic or hydrophobic amino acid at the Phe-50 position. Characterization of representative members has uncovered mechanistic and structural diversity. A new activity, a trans-3-chloroacrylic acid dehalogenase, has been identified in addition to the previously known tautomerase and isomerase activities. Two new structures have also been found, along with the 4-OT hexamer. The dehalogenase functions as a heterohexamer while the Escherichia coli homologue, designated YdcE, functions as a dimer. Moreover, both 4-OT and the Bacillus subtilis homologue, designated YwhB, exhibit low-level dehalogenase activity. Amplification of this activity could have produced the full-fledged dehalogenase. The sum of these observations indicates that Nature uses the beta-alpha-beta structural motif as a building block in a variety of manners to create new enzymes.
TI  - Decreasing the level of ethyl acetate in ethanolic fermentation broths of Escherichia coli KO11 by expression of Pseudomonas putida estZ esterase.
AB  - During the fermentation of sugars to ethanol relatively high levels of an undesirable coproduct, ethyl acetate, are also produced. With ethanologenic Escherichia coli strain KO11 as the biocatalyst, the level of ethyl acetate in beer containing 4.8% ethanol was 192 mg liter(-1). Although the E. coli genome encodes several proteins with esterase activity, neither wild-type strains nor KO11 contained significant ethyl acetate esterase activity. A simple method was developed to rapidly screen bacterial colonies for the presence of esterases which hydrolyze ethyl acetate based on pH change. This method allowed identification of Pseudomonas putida NRRL B-18435 as a source of this activity and the cloning of a new esterase gene, estZ. Recombinant EstZ esterase was purified to near homogeneity and characterized. It belongs to family IV of lipolytic enzymes and contains the conserved catalytic triad of serine, aspartic acid, and histidine. As expected, this serine esterase was inhibited by phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and the histidine reagent diethylpyrocarbonate. The native and subunit molecular weights of the recombinant protein were 36,000, indicating that the enzyme exists as a monomer. By using alpha-naphthyl acetate as a model substrate, optimal activity was observed at pH 7.5 and 40 degrees C. The Km and Vmax for alpha-naphthyl acetate were 18 microM and 48.1 micromol. min(-1). mg of protein(-1), respectively. Among the aliphatic esters tested, the highest activity was obtained with propyl acetate (96 micromol. min(-1). mg of protein(-1)), followed by ethyl acetate (66 micromol. min(-1). mg of protein(-1)). Expression of estZ in E. coli KO11 reduced the concentration of ethyl acetate in fermentation broth (4.8% ethanol) to less than 20 mg liter(-1).
TI  - Activation of soil respiration and shift of the microbial population balance in soil as a response to Lavandula stoechas essential oil.
AB  - Lavandula stoechas, a native plant of Greece, is rich in essential oil and fenchone is its major constituent. We examined the effect of the essential oil and its main constituents on soil metabolism and microbial growth. Addition of the essential oil or fenchone to soil samples induced a remarkable increase in soil respiration. This was accompanied by an increase in the soil bacterial population of three orders of magnitude. This sizable population was not qualitatively similar to that of the control soil samples. One bacterial strain dominated soil samples treated with L. stoechas essential oil or fenchone. By use of the disk diffusion assay, we evaluated the capacity of three bacterial strains that we isolated from the soil samples, as well as Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis (reference strains), to grow in the presence of the essential oil and three of its main constituents (fenchone, cineol, alpha-pinene). The substances tested did not inhibit the growth of the strain found to dominate the bacterial populations of treated soil samples; they severely inhibited B. subtilis. The other two isolated strains could also grow in liquid cultures in the presence of different quantities of essential oil or fenchone. Addition of fenchone at the end of the exponential phase increased the cell numbers of the strain that dominated the bacterial populations of treated soil samples, indicating use of the substrate added. On the basis of these results, we propose a scheme of successional stages during the decomposition process of the rich-in-essential-oil litter of aromatic plants that abound in the Mediterranean environment.
TI  - Plasmid Transfer Detection in Soil using the Inducible lPR System Fused to Eukaryotic Luciferase Genes.
AB  - We report a model system for plasmid transfer analysis using the regulated lambda phage right promoter, lPR, fused to luc and lucOR as reporter genes. We have demonstrated that the systems cI857-lPR::luc and cI857-lPR::lucOR are temperature-inducible in Escherichia coli but not in other Gram-negative bacteria analyzed, enabling detection of luminescence when plasmids were mobilized from E. coli to those Gram-negative backgrounds. Using light for the detection, we have observed plasmid transfer from E. coli harboring RK2 and R388 derived plasmids to Pseudomonas putida KT2440 (co-introduced with donors) and to indigenous microorganisms, in vitro and in nonsterile soil microcosms. The importance of nutrients for an efficient plasmid transfer in nonsterile soil microcosms has been confirmed. When plasmid transfer experiments were carried out into nonsterile soil microcosms, significant populations of indigenous transconjugants arose. This system provides efficient marker genes and avoids the use of antibiotics for the selection of transconjugants.
TI  - Metabolic engineering of Pseudomonas putida for the utilization of parathion as a carbon and energy source.
AB  - Pseudomonas putida KT2442 was engineered to use the organophosphate pesticide parathion, a compound similar to other organophosphate pesticides and chemical warfare agents, as a source of carbon and energy. The initial step in the engineered degradation pathway was parathion hydrolysis by organophosphate hydrolase (OPH) to p-nitrophenol (PNP) and diethyl thiophosphate, compounds that cannot be metabolized by P. putida KT2442. The gene encoding the native OPH (opd), with and without the secretory leader sequence, was cloned into broad-host-range plasmids under the control of tac and taclac promoters. Expression of opd from the tac promoter resulted in high OPH activity, whereas expression from the taclac promoter resulted in low activity. A plasmid-harboring operons encoding enzymes for p-nitrophenol transformation to beta-ketoadipate was transformed into P. putida allowing the organism to use 0.5 mM PNP as a carbon and energy source. Transformation of P. putida with the plasmids harboring opd and the PNP operons allowed the organism to utilize 0.8 mM parathion as a source of carbon and energy. Degradation studies showed that parathion formed a separate dense, non-aqueous phase liquid phase but was still bioavailable.
TI  - [Post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--II. Gram-negative bacteria].
AB  - As a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, monobactams, and carbapenems. Changes in CZOP susceptibility for the bacteria were also evaluated with the bacterial resistance ratio calculated with the breakpoint MIC. Twenty-five species (3,362 strains) of Gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2000, and consisted of Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis (n = 136), Haemophilus influenzae (n = 289), Escherichia coli (n = 276), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 192), Klebsiella oxytoca (n = 157), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 189), Enterobacter aerogenes (n = 93), Serratia marcescens (n = 172), Serratia liquefaciens (n = 24), Citrobacter freundii (n = 177), Citrobacter koseri (n = 70), Proteus mirabilis (n = 113), Proteus vulgaris (n = 89), Morganella morganii (n = 116), Providencia spp. (n = 41), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 290), Pseudomonas fluorescens (n = 56), Pseudomonas putida (n = 63), Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 146), Acinetobacter lwoffii (n = 34), Burkholderia cepacia (n = 101), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 169), Bacteroides fragilis group (n = 196), and Prevotella/Porphyromonas (n = 173). An antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. coli, K. pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, and S. marcescens was potent and consistent with or more preferable than the study results obtained until the new drug application approval. MIC90 of CZOP against M.(B.) catarrhalis, C. koseri, and P. aeruginosa was not considerably changed and consistent with the study results obtained until the new drug application approval. MIC90 of CZOP against E. cloacae, E. aerogenes, and P. mirabilis increased year by year. The increase in MIC90 of CZOP against E. aerogenes and P. mirabilis, however, was not considered to be an obvious decline in susceptibility. In contract, the susceptibility of E. cloacae to CZOP was suspected to be decreasing because this species showed 20.6% resistance to CZOP. MIC90 of CZOP against C. freundii was variably changed or not one-sidedly, but was higher than the values obtained until the new drug application approval. Additionally, MIC90 of CZOP against H. influenzae was stable during 5 years except being higher in 1999, and, as a whole, was a little higher than the values obtained until the new drug application approval. An antibacterial activity of CZOP against P. fluorescens, P. putida, B. cepacia, S. maltophilia, B. fragilis group, and Prevotella/Porphyromonas was weak like the other cephems. Changes in MIC90 of CZOP against the other bacteria were 2 tubes or more through 5-year study period, but did not tend towards a unilateral direction as meaning a decline in susceptibility.
TI  - Inducible gene expression by nonculturable bacteria in milk after pasteurization.
AB  - The viability of bacteria in milk after heat treatments was assessed by using three different viability indicators: (i) CFU on plate count agar, (ii) de novo expression of a gfp reporter gene, and (iii) membrane integrity based on propidium iodide exclusion. In commercially available pasteurized milk, direct viable counts, based on dye exclusion, were significantly (P < 0.05) higher than viable cell counts determined from CFU, suggesting that a significant subpopulation of cells in pasteurized milk are viable but nonculturable. Heating milk at 63.5 degrees C for 30 min resulted in a >4-log-unit reduction in the number of CFU of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida that were marked with lac-inducible gfp. However, the reduction in the number of gfp-expressing cells of both organisms under the same conditions was <2.5 log units. These results demonstrate that a substantial portion of cells rendered incapable of forming colonies by heat treatment are metabolically active and are able to transcribe and translate genes de novo.
TI  - Ferredoxin-mediated reactivation of the chlorocatechol 2,3-dioxygenase from Pseudomonas putida GJ31.
AB  - In the chlorobenzene degrader Pseudomonas putida GJ31, chlorocatechol is formed as an intermediate and cleaved by a meta-cleavage extradiol chlorocatechol dioxygenase, which has previously been shown to be exceptionally resistant to inactivation by substituted catechols. The gene encoding this dioxygenase ( cbzE) is preceded by a gene ( cbzT) potentially encoding a ferredoxin, the function of which was studied. The cbzT gene product was overproduced in Escherichia coli and purified in recombinant form. Two homologous proteins, CdoT and AtdS, encoded by genes identified in strains degrading nitrobenzene and aniline, respectively, were also purified and characterized. All three proteins showed spectroscopic properties typical for [2Fe-2S] ferredoxins. The chlorocatechol dioxygenase from strain GJ31 (CbzE) was fully inactivated when 4-methylcatechol was used as substrate. Inactivated CbzE could be rapidly reactivated in vitro in the presence of purified CbzT and a source of reductant. It is inferred that the ability of strain GJ31 to metabolize both chlorobenzene and toluene might depend on the regeneration of the chlorocatechol dioxygenase activity mediated by CbzT. Three CbzT-like ferredoxins, including AtdS, were found to be competent in the reactivation of CbzE, whereas XylT, a protein known to mediate reactivation of the catechol dioxygenase from P. putida mt2 (XylE), was ineffective. Accordingly, CbzT formed a covalent complex with CbzE when cross-linked with a carbodiimide, whereas XylT did not. In the reverse situation, CbzT was found to reactivate XylE as efficiently as XylT and formed an heterologous covalent complex with this enzyme upon cross-linking. We conclude that CbzT, CdoT and AtdS are isofunctional ferredoxins that appear to be involved in the reactivation of their cognate catechol dioxygenases. Based on primary structure comparisons, residues of the ferredoxins possibly involved in the molecular interaction with catechol dioxygenases were identified and their significance is discussed.
TI  - The active partition gene incC of IncP plasmids is required for stable maintenance in a broad range of hosts.
AB  - Plasmids of incompatibility group P (IncP) are capable of replication and stable  inheritance in a wide variety of gram-negative bacteria. Three determinants of IncP plasmids are components of an active partition locus that is predicted to function in the segregation of plasmid copies to daughter cells. These determinants are incC, which codes for a member of the ParA family of partition ATPases; korB, which specifies a DNA-binding protein that also functions as a global transcriptional repressor; and O(B), the DNA target for KorB, which occurs at multiple locations on IncP plasmids. To determine the importance and host range of the IncC/KorB partition system in the maintenance of IncP plasmids, we constructed an in-frame deletion of incC in the otherwise intact 60-kb IncP alpha plasmid R995. R995 Delta incC was found to be highly unstable in Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas putida, Agrobacterium tumefaciens, and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, whereas wild-type R995 is stable in all these hosts. In addition, R995 Delta incC could not be established in Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. trans-Complementation analysis showed that the coding region for IncC2 polypeptide, which is expressed from an internal translational start within the incC gene, was sufficient to restore stable maintenance to wild-type levels. The results show that the IncC/KorB active partition system of IncP plasmids is remarkably proficient for stable maintenance in diverse bacteria.
TI  - Functional analysis of alkane hydroxylases from gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - We have cloned homologs of the Pseudomonas putida GPo1 alkane hydroxylase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1, Pseudomonas fluorescens CHA0, Alcanivorax borkumensis AP1, Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv, and Prauserella rugosa NRRL B-2295. Sequence comparisons show that the level of protein sequence identity between the homologs is as low as 35%, and that the Pseudomonas alkane hydroxylases are as distantly related to each other as to the remaining alkane hydroxylases. Based on the observation that rubredoxin, an electron transfer component of the GPo1 alkane hydroxylase system, can be replaced by rubredoxins from other alkane hydroxylase systems, we have developed three recombinant host strains for the functional analysis of the novel alkane hydroxylase genes. Two hosts, Escherichia coli GEc137 and P. putida GPo12, were equipped with pGEc47 Delta B, which encodes all proteins necessary for growth on medium-chain-length alkanes (C(6) to C(12)), except a functional alkane hydroxylase. The third host was an alkB knockout derivative of P. fluorescens CHA0, which is no longer able to grow on C(12) to C(16) alkanes. All alkane hydroxylase homologs, except the Acinetobacter sp. ADP1 AlkM, allowed at least one of the three hosts to grow on n-alkanes.
TI  - Rubredoxins involved in alkane oxidation.
AB  - Rubredoxins (Rds) are essential electron transfer components of bacterial membrane-bound alkane hydroxylase systems. Several Rd genes associated with alkane hydroxylase or Rd reductase genes were cloned from gram-positive and gram-negative organisms able to grow on n-alkanes (Alk-Rds). Complementation tests in an Escherichia coli recombinant containing all Pseudomonas putida GPo1 genes necessary for growth on alkanes except Rd 2 (AlkG) and sequence comparisons showed that the Alk-Rds can be divided in AlkG1- and AlkG2-type Rds. All alkane-degrading strains contain AlkG2-type Rds, which are able to replace the GPo1 Rd 2 in n-octane hydroxylation. Most strains also contain AlkG1-type Rds, which do not complement the deletion mutant but are highly conserved among gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Common to most Rds are the two iron-binding CXXCG motifs. All Alk-Rds possess four negatively charged residues that are not conserved in other Rds. The AlkG1-type Rds can be distinguished from the AlkG2-type Rds by the insertion of an arginine downstream of the second CXXCG motif. In addition, the glycines in the two CXXCG motifs are usually replaced by other amino acids. Mutagenesis of residues conserved in either the AlkG1- or the AlkG2-type Rds, but not between both types, shows that AlkG1 is unable to transfer electrons to the alkane hydroxylase mainly due to the insertion of the arginine, whereas the exchange of the glycines in the two CXXCG motifs only has a limited effect.
TI  - Effects of GroESL coexpression on the folding of nicotinoprotein formaldehyde dismutase from Pseudomonas putida F61.
AB  - The overexpression of fdm, which encodes the formaldehyde dismutase from Pseudomonas putida F61, resulted in the formation of inclusion bodies made up of aggregated enzyme, leaving little activity in the soluble fraction of the transformant cells. On the other hand, coexpression of groESL along with fdm facilitated in vivo solubilization of the enzyme protein in its active form. When coexpressed with groESL, formaldehyde dismutase purified from E. coli had the same crystalline form (i.e., a regular octahedron) as the native enzyme, and like the native enzyme, it bound 1 mol of NAD(H) and 2 mol of zinc in each subunit.
TI  - The parAB gene products of Pseudomonas putida exhibit partition activity in both  P. putida and Escherichia coli.
AB  - The bacteria for which there is evidence that proteins of the ParAB family act in chromosome segregation also undergo developmental transitions that involve the ParAB homologues, raising the question of whether the partition activity is equivalent to that of plasmid partition systems. We have investigated the role in partition of the parAB locus of a free-living bacterium, Pseudomonas putida, not known to pass through developmental phases. A parAB deletion mutant, compared with wild type, showed slightly higher frequencies of anucleate cells in exponentially growing cultures but much higher frequencies in deceleration phase. This increase was growth medium dependent. Oversupply of ParA and ParB proteins also raised anucleate cell levels, specifically in the deceleration phase, in wild-type and mutant strains and regardless of medium, as well as generating abnormal cell morphologies. Absence or oversupply of ParAB function had either slight or considerable effects on growth rate, depending on temperature and medium. The need for the Par proteins in chromosome partition thus appears to be subject to the cell's physiological state. Three sequences similar to cis-acting stabilization sites of Bacillus subtilis are present in the P. putida oriC-parAB region. One was inserted into an unstable mini-F and shown to stabilize it in E. coli in a ParAB-dependent manner.
TI  - Characterization and application of xylene monooxygenase for multistep biocatalysis.
AB  - Xylene monooxygenase of Pseudomonas putida mt-2 catalyzes multistep oxidations of one methyl group of toluene and xylenes. Recombinant Escherichia coli expressing the monooxygenase genes xylM and xylA catalyzes the oxygenation of toluene, pseudocumene, the corresponding alcohols, and the corresponding aldehydes, all by a monooxygenation type of reaction (B. Buhler, A. Schmid, B. Hauer, and B. Witholt, J. Biol. Chem. 275:10085-10092, 2000). Using E. coli expressing xylMA, we investigated the kinetics of this one-enzyme three-step biotransformation. We found that unoxidized substrates like toluene and pseudocumene inhibit the second and third oxygenation steps and that the corresponding alcohols inhibit the third oxygenation step. These inhibitions might promote the energetically more favorable alcohol and aldehyde dehydrogenations in the wild type. Growth of E. coli was strongly affected by low concentrations of pseudocumene and its products. Toxicity and solubility problems were overcome by the use of a two-liquid-phase system with bis(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate as the carrier solvent, allowing high overall substrate and product concentrations. In a fed-batch-based two-liquid-phase process with pseudocumene as the substrate, we observed the consecutive accumulation of aldehyde, acid, and alcohol. Our results indicate that, depending on the reaction conditions, product formation could be directed to one specific product.
TI  - Oxygenation reactions of various tricyclic fused aromatic compounds using Escherichia coli and Streptomyces lividans transformants carrying several arene dioxygenase genes.
AB  - Bioconversion (biotransformation) experiments on arenes (aromatic compounds), including various tricyclic fused aromatic compounds such as fluorene, dibenzofuran, dibenzothiophene, carbazole, acridene, and phenanthridine, were done using the cells of Escherichia coli transformants expressing several arene dioxygenase genes. E. coli carrying the phenanthrene dioxygenase (phdABCD) genes derived from the marine bacterium Nocardioides sp. strain KP7 converted all of these tricyclic aromatic compounds, while E. coli carrying the Pseudomonas putida F1 toluene dioxygenase (todC1C2BA) genes or the P. pseudoalcaligenes KF707 biphenyl dioxygenase (bphA1A2A3A4) genes was not able to convert these substrates. Surprisingly, E. coli carrying hybrid dioxygenase (todC1::bphA2A3A4) genes with a subunit substitution between the toluene and biphenyl dioxygenases was able to convert fluorene, dibenzofuran, and dibenzothiophene. The cells of a Streptomyces lividans transformant carrying the phenanthrene dioxygenase genes were also evaluated for bioconversion of various tricyclic fused aromatic compounds. The ability of this actinomycete in their conversion was similar to that of E. coli carrying the corresponding genes. Products converted from the aromatic compounds with these recombinant bacterial cells were purified by column chromatography on silica gel, and identified by their MS and 1H and 13C NMR analyses. Several products, e.g., 4-hydroxyfluorene converted from fluorene, and cis-1,2-dihydroxy-1,2-dihydrophenanthridine, cis-9,10-dihydroxy-9,10-dihydrophenanthridine, and 10-hydroxyphenanthridine, which were converted from phenanthridine, were novel compounds.
TI  - Integration of global regulation of two aromatic-responsive sigma(54)-dependent systems: a common phenotype by different mechanisms.
AB  - Pseudomonas-derived regulators DmpR and XylR are structurally and mechanistically related sigma(54)-dependent activators that control transcription of genes involved in catabolism of aromatic compounds. The binding of distinct sets of aromatic effectors to these regulatory proteins results in release of a repressive interdomain interaction and consequently allows the activators to promote transcription from their cognate target promoters. The DmpR-controlled Po promoter region and the XylR-controlled Pu promoter region are also similar, although homology is limited to three discrete DNA signatures for binding sigma(54) RNA polymerase, the integration host factor, and the regulator. These common properties allow cross-regulation of Pu and Po by DmpR and XylR in response to appropriate aromatic effectors. In vivo, transcription of both the DmpR/Po and XylR/Pu regulatory circuits is subject to dominant global regulation, which results in repression of transcription during growth in rich media. Here, we comparatively assess the contribution of (p)ppGpp, the FtsH protease, and a component of an alternative phosphoenolpyruvate-sugar phosphotransferase system, which have been independently implicated in mediating this level of regulation. Further, by exploiting the cross-regulatory abilities of these two circuits, we identify the target component(s) that are intercepted in each case. The results show that (i) contrary to previous speculation, FtsH is not universally required for transcription of sigma(54)-dependent systems; (ii) the two factors found to impact the XylR/Pu regulatory circuit do not intercept the DmpR/Po circuit; and (iii) (p)ppGpp impacts the DmpR/Po system to a greater extent than the XylR/Pu system in both the native Pseudomonas putida and a heterologous Escherichia coli host. The data demonstrate that, despite the similarities of the specific regulatory circuits, the host global regulatory network latches onto and dominates over these specific circuits by exploiting their different properties. The mechanistic implications of how each of the host factors exerts its action are discussed.
TI  - Characterization of wastewater toxicity by means of a whole-cell bacterial biosensor, using Pseudomonas putida, in conjunction with chemical analysis.
AB  - A new amperometric biosensor based on inhibition of Pseudomonas putida has been developed to assess the acute toxicity of wastewater. This system uses the biological component immobilized on disposable screen-printed electrodes. The responses for a selected group of polar organic standard substances were studied using Pseudomonas putida as biological component. The results have been compared with responses obtained using the same system and Escherichia coli as biological component and with the bioluminescence inhibition of Vibrio fisheri using ToxAlert 100. Different properties, e.g. the standard deviation (SD) of the data, the goodness of fit (R2) and the standard deviation (Syx) of the vertical distances of the points from the inhibition curve, the 50% effective concentration (EC50) and the toxicity units (TII50) of the standard substance, were calculated and compared. This biosensor was used to assess the acute toxicity of real wastewater samples collected at different wastewater treatment plants (WWTP). Finally, a sequential solid-phase extraction (SSPE) procedure followed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was used to determine the polar organic toxic substances present in the wastewater samples.
TI  - Residues 137 and 153 at the N terminus of the XylS protein influence the effector profile of this transcriptional regulator and the sigma factor used by RNA polymerase to stimulate transcription from its cognate promoter.
AB  - The 321-residue XylS and XylS1 proteins, encoded by the pWW0 and pWW53 plasmids respectively, differ in only 5 residues at positions 4, 53, 90, 137, and 153. As a result, the effector profile of XylS is wider than that of XylS1, and XylS mediates higher levels of transcription from its cognate-regulatable promoter than does XylS1. We generated a series of XylS-pWW0 mutants and found that the single mutants Asp-137-->Glu and His-153-->Asn exhibited an activation pattern different from that of the wild-type regulator. In the double-mutant XylSD137E,H153N the effector profile for benzoates was similar to that of XylS1. This suggests that these two residues are crucial for effector recognition and regulator activation to stimulate transcription. XylS-dependent transcription from its cognate promoter is mediated by RNA polymerase with sigma(32) or sigma(38), whereas XylS1 uses RNA polymerase with sigma(32) or sigma(70). We also found that point mutations at positions 137 and 153 of XylS led RNA polymerase to mediate transcription with sigma(70) rather than with sigma(38), as demonstrated by primer extension analysis in a sigma(70)-thermosensitive background proficient and deficient in sigma(38). This suggests that a positive transcriptional regulator can choose the RNA polymerase complex that mediates transcription from a given promoter.
TI  - Engineering the CYP101 system for in vivo oxidation of unnatural substrates.
AB  - The protein engineering of CYP enzymes for structure-activity studies and the oxidation of unnatural substrates for biotechnological applications will be greatly facilitated by the availability of functional, whole-cell systems for substrate oxidation. We report the construction of a tricistronic plasmid that expresses the CYP101 monooxygenase from Pseudomonas putida, and its physiological electron transfer co-factor proteins putidaredoxin reductase and putidaredoxin in Escherichia coli, giving a functional in vivo catalytic system. Wild-type CYP101 expressed in this system efficiently transforms camphor to 5-exo-hydroxycamphor without further oxidation to 5-oxo-camphor until >95% of camphor has been consumed. CYP101 mutants with increased activity for the oxidation of diphenylmethane (the Y96F-I395G mutant), styrene and ethylbenzene (the Y96F-V247L mutant) have been engineered. In particular, the Y96F-V247L mutant shows coupling efficiency of approximately 60% for styrene and ethylbenzene oxidation, with substrate oxidation rates of approximately 100/min. Escherichia coli cells transformed with tricistronic plasmids expressing these mutants readily gave 100-mg quantities of 4-hydroxydiphenylmethane and 1-phenylethanol in 24-72 h. This new in vivo system can be used for preparative scale reactions for product characterization, and will greatly facilitate directed evolution of the CYP101 enzyme for enhanced activity and selectivity of substrate oxidation.
TI  - Characterization of the active site of histidine ammonia-lyase from Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - Elucidation of the 3D structure of histidine ammonia-lyase (HAL, EC 4.3.1.3) from Pseudomonas putida by X-ray crystallography revealed that the electrophilic prosthetic group at the active site is 3,5-dihydro-5-methylidene-4H-imidazol-4-one (MIO) [Schwede, T.F., Retey, J., Schulz, G.E. (1999) Biochemistry, 38, 5355-5361]. To evaluate the importance of several amino-acid residues at the active site for substrate binding and catalysis, we mutated the following amino-acid codons in the HAL gene: R283, Y53, Y280, E414, Q277, F329, N195 and H83. Kinetic measurements with the overexpressed mutants showed that all mutations resulted in a decrease of catalytic activity. The mutants R283I, R283K and N195A were approximately 1640, 20 and 1000 times less active, respectively, compared to the single mutant C273A, into which all mutations were introduced. Mutants Y280F, F329A and Q277A exhibited approximately 55, 100 and 125 times lower activity, respectively. The greatest loss of activity shown was in the HAL mutants Y53F, E414Q, H83L and E414A, the last being more than 20 900-fold less active than the single mutant C273A, while H83L was 18 000-fold less active than mutant C273A. We propose that the carboxylate group of E414 plays an important role as a base in catalysis. To investigate a possible participation of active site amino acids in the formation of MIO, we used the chromophore formation upon treatment of HAL with l-cysteine and dioxygen at pH 10.5 as an indicator. All mutants, except F329A showed the formation of a 338-nm chromophore arising from a modified MIO group. The UV difference spectra of HAL mutant F329A with the MIO-free mutant S143A provide evidence for the presence of a MIO group in HAL mutant F329A also. For modelling of the substrate arrangement within the active site and protonation state of MIO, theoretical calculations were performed.
TI  - Homologous expression of the lipase and ABC transporter gene cluster, tliDEFA, enhances lipase secretion in Pseudomonas spp.
AB  - The ABC transporter TliDEF was found to be an efficient secretory apparatus for extracellular lipase TliA in Pseudomonas fluorescens. For the enhanced secretion of the lipase, we tried to coexpress tliA and tliDEF in various Pseudomonas species. Whereas the coexpression of tliA and tliDEF was required for the lipase secretion in P. fragi, the expression of tliA was sufficient for the lipase secretion in P. fluorescens, P. syringae, and P. putida, indicating the existence of compatible ABC transporter in these species. However, P. fluorescens harboring tliDEFA secreted much more lipase than P. fluorescens harboring only tliA, but the tliDEF was functional only at temperatures below 30 degrees C. The recombinant P. fluorescens overexpressing tliDEFA showed the highest secretion level, 217 U/ml. OD (optical density) (28 microg/ml. OD) of lipase in Luria-Bertani medium under microaerated conditions. With the increase of aeration, the lipase production was decreased and the lipase seemed to be degraded as the cells entered the cell death phase. These results demonstrate that P. fluorescens can be used as a host system for the secretory production of the lipase using the ABC transporter, thus producing lipase in over 14% of the total protein.
TI  - Sulfide oxidation in gram-negative bacteria by expression of the sulfide-quinone  reductase gene of Rhodobacter capsulatus and by electron transport to ubiquinone.
AB  - The oxidation of sulfide was studied in recombinant bacteria expressing the sulfide-quinone reductase gene (sqr) from Rhodobacter capsulatus. Sulfide was oxidized by the Escherichia coli strain W3110 harboring the sqr construct (pKKSQ) under anaerobic conditions and nitrate was utilized as a terminal electron acceptor. Following the oxidation, elemental sulfur and nitrite were produced as the final reaction products. This activity was retained in the membrane preparation and was sensitive towards antimycin A, stigmatellin, and azide. As a consequence of the ubiquinone deficiency, this activity was markedly decreased. In additon, by recovery of ubiquinone, the oxidation was also restored to rates similar to those of the wild-type strain. These results indicate that sulfide oxidation in this strain occurs via the quinone pool in vivo, and that this sulfide-quinone reductase (SQR) in particular utilizes ubiquinone as a more appropriate electron acceptor than menaquinone or demetylmenaquinone. To our knowledge, this is the first study to show a direct interaction between SQR and ubiquinone in cells. When expressed in Pseudomonas putida and Rhizobium meliloti, the SQR conferred on these organisms the ability to oxidize sulfide as well as E. coli in vivo.
TI  - The TOL plasmid pWW0 xylN gene product from Pseudomonas putida is involved in m-xylene uptake.
AB  - The upper operon of the TOL plasmid pWW0 of Pseudomonas putida encodes a set of enzymes involved in the conversion of toluene and xylenes to their carboxylic acid derivatives. The last gene of the upper operon, xylN, encodes a 465-amino-acid polypeptide which exhibits significant sequence similarity to FadL, an outer membrane protein involved in fatty acid transport in Escherichia coli. To analyze the role of the xylN gene product, xylN on TOL plasmid pWW0 was disrupted by inserting a kanamycin resistance gene, and the phenotypes of P. putida harboring the wild-type and xylN mutant TOL plasmids were characterized. The growth of P. putida harboring the wild-type TOL plasmid was inhibited by a high concentration of m-xylene, while that of P. putida harboring the xylN mutant TOL plasmid was not. The apparent K(s) value for the oxidation of m-xylene in intact cells of the xylN mutant was fourfold higher than that of the wild-type strain, although the TOL catabolic enzyme activities in cell extracts from the two strains were almost identical. We therefore presume that the xylN gene product is a porin involved in the transport of m-xylene and its analogues across the outer membrane. Western blot analysis confirmed the localization of XylN in the outer membrane.
TI  - Characterization of phenotypic changes in Pseudomonas putida in response to surface-associated growth.
AB  - The formation of complex bacterial communities known as biofilms begins with the  interaction of planktonic cells with a surface. A switch between planktonic and sessile growth is believed to result in a phenotypic change in bacteria. In this study, a global analysis of physiological changes of the plant saprophyte Pseudomonas putida following 6 h of attachment to a silicone surface was carried out by analysis of protein profiles and by mRNA expression patterns. Two-dimensional (2-D) gel electrophoresis revealed 15 proteins that were up-regulated following bacterial adhesion and 30 proteins that were down-regulated. N-terminal sequence analyses of 11 of the down-regulated proteins identified a protein with homology to the ABC transporter, PotF; an outer membrane lipoprotein, NlpD; and five proteins that were homologous to proteins involved in amino acid metabolism. cDNA subtractive hybridization revealed 40 genes that were differentially expressed following initial attachment of P. putida. Twenty-eight of these genes had known homologs. As with the 2-D gel analysis, NlpD and genes involved in amino acid metabolism were identified by subtractive hybridization and found to be down-regulated following surface-associated growth. The gene for PotB was up-regulated, suggesting differential expression of ABC transporters following attachment to this surface. Other genes that showed differential regulation were structural components of flagella and type IV pili, as well as genes involved in polysaccharide biosynthesis. Immunoblot analysis of PilA and FliC confirmed the presence of flagella in planktonic cultures but not in 12- or 24-h biofilms. In contrast, PilA was observed in 12-h biofilms but not in planktonic culture. Recent evidence suggests that quorum sensing by bacterial homoserine lactones (HSLs) may play a regulatory role in biofilm development. To determine if similar protein profiles occurred during quorum sensing and during early biofilm formation, HSLs extracted from P. putida and pure C(12)-HSL were added to 6-h planktonic cultures of P. putida, and cell extracts were analyzed by 2-D gel profiles. Differential expression of 16 proteins was observed following addition of HSLs. One protein, PotF, was found to be down-regulated by both surface-associated growth and by HSL addition. The other 15 proteins did not correspond to proteins differentially expressed by surface-associated growth. The results presented here demonstrate that P. putida undergoes a global change in gene expression following initial attachment to a surface. Quorum sensing may play a role in the initial attachment process, but other sensory processes must also be involved in these phenotypic changes.
TI  - Characterization of the eugenol hydroxylase genes (ehyA/ehyB) from the new eugenol-degrading Pseudomonas sp. strain OPS1.
AB  - During the screening for bacteria capable of converting eugenol to vanillin, strain OPS1 was isolated, which was identified as a new Pseudomonas species by 16 s rDNA sequence analysis. When this bacterium was grown on eugenol, the intermediates, coniferyl alcohol, ferulic acid, vanillic acid, and protocatechuic acid, were identified in the culture supernatant. The genes encoding the eugenol hydroxylase (ehyA, ehyB), which catalyzes the first step of this biotransformation, were identified in a genomic library of Pseudomonas sp. strain OPS1 by complementation of the eugenol-negative mutant SK6165 of Pseudomonas sp. strain HR199. EhyA and EhyB exhibited 57% and 85% amino acid identity to the eugenol hydroxylase subunits of Pseudomonas sp. strain HR199 and up to 34% and 54% identity to the corresponding subunits of p-cresol methylhydroxylase from P. putida. Moreover, the amino-terminal sequences of the alpha- and beta-subunits reported recently for an eugenol dehydrogenase of P fluorescens E118 corresponded well with the appropriate regions of EhyA and EhyB. Downstream of ehyB, an open reading frame was identified, whose deduced amino acid sequence exhibited up to 71% identity to azurins, representing most probably the gene (azu) of the physiological electron acceptor of the eugenol hydroxylase. The eugenol hydroxylase genes were amplified by PCR, cloned, and functionally expressed in Escherichia coli.
TI  - Mycobacterium tuberculosis lipoamide dehydrogenase is encoded by Rv0462 and not by the lpdA or lpdB genes.
AB  - The gene encoding dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Rv0462, was expressed in Escherichia coli and the protein purified to homogeneity. The 49 kDa polypeptide forms a homodimer containing one tightly bound molecule of FAD/monomer. The results of steady-state kinetic analyses using several reduced pyridine nucleotide analogs and a variety of electron acceptors, and the ability of the enzyme to catalyze the transhydrogenation of NADH and thio-NAD(+) in the absence of D,L-lipoamide, demonstrated that the enzyme uses a ping-pong kinetic mechanism. Primary deuterium kinetic isotope effects on V and V/K at pH 7.5 using NADH deuterated at the C(4)-proS position of the nicotinamide ring are small [(D)(V/K)(NADH) = 1.12 +/- 0.15, (D)V(app) = 1.05 +/- 0.07] when D,L-lipoamide is the oxidant but large and equivalent [(D)(V/K)(NADH) = (D)V = 2.95 +/- 0.03] when 5-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone is the oxidant. Solvent deuterium kinetic isotope effects at pH 5.8, using APADH as the reductant, are inverse with (D)(V/K)(APADH) = 0.73 +/- 0.03, (D)(V/K)(Lip(S))2 = 0.77 +/- 0.03, and (D)V(app) = 0.77 +/- 0.01. Solvent deuterium kinetic isotope effects with 4,4-dithiopyridine (DTP), the 4-thiopyridone product of which requires no protonation, are also inverse with (D)(V/K)(APADH) = 0.75 +/- 0.06, (D)(V/K)(DTP) = 0.71 +/- 0.02, and (D)V(app) = 0.56 +/- 0.15. All proton inventories were linear, indicating that a single proton is being transferred in the solvent isotopically sensitive step. Taken together, these results suggest that (1) the reductive half-reaction (hydride transfer from NADH to FAD) is rate limiting when a quinone is the oxidant, and (2) deprotonation of enzymic thiols, most likely Cys(46) and Cys(41), limits the reductive and oxidative half-reactions, respectively, when D,L-lipoamide is the oxidant.
TI  - Residues 137 and 153 of XylS influence contacts with the C-terminal domain of the RNA polymerase alpha subunit.
AB  - XylS and XylS1 are transcriptional regulators that stimulate transcription from the Pm promoter for the meta-cleavage pathway operon for alkylbenzoate degradation. These regulators that differ in five amino acids interact with alpha-CTD domain of RNA polymerase. These interactions take place preferentially through residues 291 in XylS and 289 in XylS1. Substitution at position 137 and 153 in XylS influence the interactions with alpha-CTD because single and double mutants in these positions turned preferential interactions to residue 289.
TI  - Crystal structure of Escherichia coli Fdx, an adrenodoxin-type ferredoxin involved in the assembly of iron-sulfur clusters.
AB  - Escherichia coli ferredoxin (Fdx) is an adrenodoxin-type [2Fe-2S] ferredoxin. Recent genetic analyses show that it has an essential role in the maturation of various iron-sulfur (Fe-S) proteins. Fdx probably functions as a component of the complex machinery responsible for the biogenesis of Fe-S clusters. Its crystal structure was determined by the multiple-wavelength anomalous dispersion method using the iron atoms in the [2Fe-2S] cluster of the protein and then refined to R and R(free) values of 0.255 and 0.278, respectively, at 1.7 A resolution. The structure of Fdx is similar to the structures of bovine adrenodoxin (Adx) and Pseudomonas putida putidaredoxin (Pdx) whose respective root-mean-square deviations of the corresponding Calpha atoms are 1.8 and 2.2 A. This analysis also revealed the structure of the C-terminal residues protruding into the solvent, which is missing in Adx and Pdx. The [2Fe-2S] cluster is located at the edge of the molecule and bonds with the Sgamma atoms of Cys42, Cys48, Cys51, and Cys87. Electrostatic potential analysis showed that the surface of Fdx has two negatively charged areas separated by a hydrophobic lane. One is conserved on the surface of Adx which is an area of interaction with adrenodoxin reductase. Cys46 is located on the molecular surface in the vicinity of the [2Fe-2S] cluster, an indication that it may be involved in Fe-S cluster formation.
TI  - Features of the replicon of plasmid pAM10.6 of Pseudomonas fluorescens.
AB  - We describe features of the basic replicon of the 10.6-kb medium-copy-number plasmid pAM10.6. pAM10.6 was able to replicate in various Pseudomonas strains but was maintained in Escherichia coli only after the p15A origin of replication was inserted. Deletion analysis suggests that the pAM10.6 origin of replication is located in a 0.5-kb region that includes inverted and direct repeats upstream of the repA gene. RepA (204 aa) has a clear homology to plasmid replication proteins of some other gram-negative bacteria. The pas (plasmid addiction system) (genes encoded in the region of 480-bp) stabilizes plasmid maintenance in P. putida cells under nonselective conditions for at least 200 generations. A 3.75-kb PstI fragment of pAM10.6 joined to a Km(r) gene was shown to be a minimal plasmid unit maintained in P. putida as a monomer. Further deletions of this 3.75-kb fragment caused a drive to form stable head-to-tail dimeric plasmids in P. putida.
TI  - New alkane-responsive expression vectors for Escherichia coli and pseudomonas.
AB  - We have developed Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas expression vectors based on the alkane-responsive Pseudomonas putida (oleovorans) GPo1 promoter PalkB. The expression vectors were tested in several E. coli strains, P. putida GPo12 and P. fluorescens KOB2Delta1 with catechol-2,3-dioxygenase (XylE). Induction factors ranged between 100 and 2700 for pKKPalk in E. coli and pCom8 in Pseudomonas strains, but were clearly lower for pCom8, pCom9, and pCom10 in E. coli. XylE expression levels of more than 10% of total cell protein were obtained for E. coli as well as for Pseudomonas strains.
TI  - Expression of benzene dioxygenase from Pseudomonas putida ML2 in cis-1,2-cyclohexanediol-degrading pseudomonads.
AB  - Benzene dioxygenase (BDO; EC 1.14.12.3) from Pseudomonas putida ML2 dihydroxylates benzene to produce cis-1,2-dihydroxy-cyclohexa-3,5-diene. As well as oxidising benzene and toluene, cell-free extracts of Escherichia coli JM109 expressing recombinant BDO oxidised cyclohexene, 1-methylcyclohexene and 3-methylcyclohexene. In an attempt to construct a novel metabolic pathway for the degradation of cyclohexene (via an initial BDO-mediated dihydroxylation of cyclohexene), cis-1,2-cyclohexanediol-degrading bacteria were isolated by enrichment culture. The bedC1C2BA genes encoding BDO (under the control of the tac promoter) were sub-cloned into pLAFR5, successfully conjugated into seven of the Gram-negative cis-1,2-cyclo-hexanediol-degrading isolates and stably maintained and expressed in three of them. However, despite their ability to grow on cis-1,2-cyclohexanediol as sole carbon source, express an active BDO and oxidise cyclohexene, none of the three strains was able to grow on cyclohexene as sole carbon source. Analysis revealed that BDO oxidised cyclohexene to a mixture of two products, a monohydroxylated (2-cyclohexen-1-ol) product and a dihydroxylated (cis-1,2-cyclohexanediol) product; and failure to grow on cyclohexene was attributed to the toxicity of metabolic intermediates accumulating from the 2-cyclohexen-1-ol metabolism.
TI  - The inverted repeats of IS1384, a newly described insertion sequence from Pseudomonas putida strain H, represent the specific target for integration of IS1383.
AB  - Analysis of a region on plasmid pPGH1 from Pseudomonas putida strain H that is flanked by two copies of IS1383 has revealed an additional element with the typical features of a bacterial insertion sequence. This new IS element, designated IS1384, contains a single ORF of 972 bp, and is flanked by 9-bp inverted repeats. Based on sequence homology and structural characteristics of the putative transposase it encodes, IS1384 belongs to the IS5 subgroup of the IS5 family. Two copies of IS1384 are present on plasmid pPGH1, whereas none could be detected on the chromosome of P. putida strain H. Sequence analysis revealed the presence of two truncated copies of IS1384 on the second plasmid in this strain, pPGH2. The inverted repeats of all IS1384 copies (including the truncated ones) are interrupted by the integration of an IS1383 element. All integrations were found to be site- and orientation-specific. PCR studies and sequence data indicate that IS1383 can form a circular intermediate on excision. In the circular form, the previously described 13-bp inverted repeats of IS1383 are separated by 10 bp that are identical to the 5-bp motif that flanks each side of the element when it is integrated in its target. We provide evidence that these additional nucleotides, although not of inverted symmetry, represent an essential part of the inverted repeats. Furthermore, the data indicate that IS1383 integrated into the inverted repeats of IS1384 by a site-specific recombination rather than a site-specific insertion event.
TI  - Comparison of response of six different luminescent bacterial bioassays to bioremediation of five contrasting oils.
AB  - The performance of six different bioluminescent bacteria for the assessment of oil bioremediation was compared. Three contained lux genes linked to promoters from hydrocarbon degradation pathways: Pseudomonas fluorescens HK44 (pUTK21), Escherichia coli HMS174 (pOS25) and E. coli DH5 alpha (pGEc74, pJAMA7), responding to naphthalene, isopropylbenzene and octane, respectively. The other three expressed lux constitutively: E. coli HB101 (pUCD607) and P. putida F1 (pUCD607) are genetically engineered, while Vibrio fischeri is naturally bioluminescent and was included to facilitate comparison with previous work. Five different oils (four crude oils plus diesel) were spiked into soil, and the progress of remediation was followed over a period of 119 d by monitoring both hydrocarbon disappearance and changes in the microbial response to soil extracts. The octane bioassay was the only one of the hydrocarbon-responsive bacterial assays to show any appreciable response, with up to 20-fold induction by light crude oils. Heavy crude oil and diesel elicited a much weaker response. The metabolic (lux constitutively expressed) bioassays showed that there was a general increase in toxicity over the course of the experiment, although toxicity to E. coli HB101 (pUCD607) appeared to be decreasing by the final sampling point. The metabolic bioassay response was much less variable between the different oils than for the first three, catabolic, strains.
TI  - Azurin involved in alcohol oxidation system in Pseudomonas putida HK5: expression analysis and gene cloning.
AB  - Expression of azurin in Pseudomonas putida HK5 was examined by immunoblot analysis. Similar amounts of azurin were found in the cells grown into the stationary phase on any carbon sources, including LB medium without alcohol, where no quinoprotein alcohol dehydrogenases appeared. In the early exponential phase, the highest amount of azurin was found in the cells grown on 1-butanol, but here was none in the case of LB medium, suggesting that expression of azurin is cooperative with that of the alcohol oxidase system, especially the system including quinohemoprotein alcohol dehydrogenase IIB. The azurin gene (azu) was cloned and sequenced. azu is monocistronic, and in its promoter region, FNR-binding consensus sequence was found. However, its relative position suggests different transcriptional regulation from that in azu of P. aeruginosa. The molecular weight of the mature protein without copper ion calculated from the amino acid sequence was consistent with the value of the purified azurin measured by mass spectrometry.
TI  - Involvement of the TonB system in tolerance to solvents and drugs in Pseudomonas  putida DOT-T1E.
AB  - Pseudomonas putida DOT-T1E is able to grow with glucose as the carbon source in liquid medium with 1% (vol/vol) toluene or 17 g of (123 mM) p-hydroxybenzoate (4HBA) per liter. After random mini-Tn5'phoA-Km mutagenesis, we isolated the mutant DOT-T1E-PhoA5, which was more sensitive than the wild type to 4HBA (growth was prevented at 6 g/liter) and toluene (the mutant did not withstand sudden toluene shock). Susceptibility to toluene and 4HBA resulted from the reduced efflux of these compounds from the cell, as revealed by accumulation assays with (14)C-labeled substrates. The mutant was also more susceptible to a number of antibiotics, and its growth in iron-deficient minimal medium was inhibited in the presence of ethylenediamine-di(o-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (EDDHA). Cloning the mutation in the PhoA5 strain and sequencing the region adjacent showed that the mini-Tn5 transposor interrupted the exbD gene, which forms part of the exbBD tonB operon. Complementation by the exbBD and tonB genes cloned in pJB3-Tc restored the wild-type characteristics to the PhoA5 strain.
TI  - Bioconversion of limonene to increased concentrations of perillic acid by Pseudomonas putida GS1 in a fed-batch reactor.
AB  - Pseudomonas putida GS1 is able to convert limonene to perillic acid (up to 64 mM,(11 g/l) when the bacteria is cultivated in fed-batch culture with non-limiting amounts of glycerol. ammonium, and limonene. P. putida GS1 can use p-cymene as a single source of carbon and energy, and the enzymes that are responsible for the conversion of limonene to perillic acid belong to the degradation pathway of p-cymene. The p-cymene pathway of P putida GS1 is very similar, if not identical, to the cym pathway of P. putida F1. The latter strain, and a recombinant Escherichia coli strain that carried the genes of the cym pathway of P. putida Fl, also converted limonene to perillic acid. However, the final concentrations that were obtained in batch cultures with these two strains were lower than those obtained with P. putida GS1.
TI  - The methionine biosynthetic pathway from homoserine in Pseudomonas putida involves the metW, metX, metZ, metH and metE gene products.
AB  - Biosynthesis of methionine from homoserine in Pseudomonas putida takes place in three steps. The first step is the acylation of homoserine to yield an acyl-L-homoserine. This reaction is catalyzed by the products of the metXW genes and is equivalent to the first step in enterobacteria, gram-positive bacteria and fungi, except that in these microorganisms the reaction is catalyzed by a single polypeptide (the product of the metA gene in Escherichia coli and the met5 gene product in Neurospora crassa). In Pseudomonas putida, as in gram-positive bacteria and certain fungi, the second and third steps are a direct sulfhydrylation that converts the O-acyl-L-homoserine into homocysteine and further methylation to yield methionine. The latter reaction can be mediated by either of the two methionine synthetases present in the cells.
TI  - Biotransformation of various substituted aromatic compounds to chiral dihydrodihydroxy derivatives.
AB  - The biotransformation of four different classes of aromatic compounds by the Escherichia coli strain DH5alpha(pTCB 144), which contained the chlorobenzene dioxygenase (CDO) from Pseudomonas sp. strain P51, was examined. CDO oxidized biphenyl as well as monochlorobiphenyls to the corresponding cis-2,3-dihydro-2,3-dihydroxy derivatives, whereby oxidation occurred on the unsubstituted ring. No higher substituted biphenyls were oxidized. The absolute configurations of several monosubstituted cis-benzene dihydrodiols formed by CDO were determined. All had an S configuration at the carbon atom in meta position to the substituent on the benzene nucleus. With one exception, the enantiomeric excess of several 1,4-disubstituted cis-benzene dihydrodiols formed by CDO was higher than that of the products formed by two toluene dioxygenases. Naphthalene was oxidized to enantiomerically pure (+)-cis-(1R,2S)-dihydroxy-1,2-dihydronaphthalene. All absolute configurations were identical to those of the products formed by toluene dioxygenases of Pseudomonas putida UV4 and P. putida F39/D. The formation rate of (+)-cis-(1R,2S)-dihydroxy-1,2-dihydronaphthalene was significantly higher (about 45 to 200%) than those of several monosubstituted cis-benzene dihydrodiols and more than four times higher than the formation rate of cis-benzene dihydrodiol. A new gas chromatographic method was developed to determine the enantiomeric excess of the oxidation products.
TI  - Accumulation of methylglyoxal in anaerobically grown Escherichia coli and its detoxification by expression of the Pseudomonas putida glyoxalase I gene.
AB  - Anaerobic glycerol fermentation by Escherichia coli strains expressing genes from the Klebsiella pneumoniae dha regulon showed that cell growth and 1,3-propanediol (1,3-PD) production are significantly inhibited when 5 g/L or higher of glycerol is initially present. One reason for this inhibition may be methylglyoxal (MG) accumulation. Assays of both intracellular and extracellular MG levels indicated an accumulation of MG in anaerobic glycerol fermentation of transgenic E. coli. Pseudomonas putida glyoxalase I was expressed in the transgenic E. coli to enhance MG detoxification. The activity of glyoxalase I in the transgenic E. coli with the P. putida glyoxalase I under anaerobic conditions was 12-fold higher than that in the control cells. Compared to the control cells, the transgenic cells with the P. putida glyoxalase I displayed a reduction of 35-43% in intracellular MG and a decrease of 30% in extracellular MG. These decreases were statistically significant (P>94). Furthermore, the expression of the P. putida glyoxalase I in the transgenic E. coli markedly improved cell growth and resulted in a 50% increase in 1,3-PD production.
TI  - Soft particle analysis of bacterial cells and its interpretation of cell adhesion behaviors in terms of DLVO theory.
AB  - The electrokinetic properties of two nitrifying strains, Nitrosomonas europaea and Nitrobacter winogradskyi, and three heterotrophic bacteria, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas putida and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, were examined by electrophoretic mobility measurement and analyzed using the soft particle electrophoresis theory that is suitable for biological particles. The bacterial adhesion characteristics onto glass bead substratum were also evaluated by packed bed method. The mobility of the bacterial cells employed converged to a non-zero value as the ionic concentration increased, suggesting that the bacterial cells exhibited typical soft particle characteristics. Moreover, cell surface potentials based on the soft particle theory were lower than those estimated by the conventional Smoluchowski formula, i.e. zeta potential. Cell collision efficiencies onto glass beads (alpha(0)) were largely dependent on interfacial interaction, although almost electrically neutral P. aeruginosa did not follow that trend. From a comparison of alpha(0) with DLVO interaction energy maximum (V(max)), it was assumed that heterocoagulation between cell and substratum at primary minimum potential took place under V(max) of 24-34 kT based on soft particle analysis. On the other hand, V(max) predictions using the Smoluchowski theory gave 81-223 kT, which indicated the possibility of overestimating electrostatic repulsive forces by the conventional Smoluchowski theory. Thus, the application of this new electrophoresis theory to several kinds of bacterial cells has led to the revision of the interpretation of bacterial mobility data and provided a more detailed understanding of the bacterial adhesion phenomenon.
TI  - A dual-specific Glu-tRNA(Gln) and Asp-tRNA(Asn) amidotransferase is involved in decoding glutamine and asparagine codons in Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans.
AB  - The gatC, gatA and gatB genes encoding the three subunits of glutamyl-tRNA(Gln) amidotransferase from Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans, an acidophilic bacterium used in bioleaching of minerals, have been cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. As in Bacillus subtilis the three gat genes are organized in an operon-like structure in A. ferrooxidans. The heterologously overexpressed enzyme converts Glu-tRNA(Gln) to Gln-tRNA(Gln) and Asp-tRNA(Asn) to Asn-tRNA(Asn). Biochemical analysis revealed that neither glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase nor asparaginyl-tRNA synthetase is present in A. ferrooxidans, but that glutamyl-tRNA synthetase and aspartyl-tRNA synthetase enzymes are present in the organism. These data suggest that the transamidation pathway is responsible for the formation of Gln-tRNA and Asn-tRNA in A. ferrooxidans.
TI  - Using light scatter signal to estimate bacterial biovolume by flow cytometry.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In the past decade, flow cytometry has become a useful and precise alternative to microscopic bacterial cell counts in aquatic samples. However, little evidence of its usefulness for the evaluation of bacterial biovolumes has emerged in from the literature. METHODS: The light scattering and cell volume of starved bacterial strains and natural bacterial communities from the Black Sea were measured by flow cytometry and epifluorescence microscopy, respectively, in order to establish a relationship between light scattering and cell volume. RESULTS: With the arc-lamp flow cytometer, forward angle light scatter (FALS) was related to cell size in both the starved strains and natural communities, although regression parameters differed. We tested the predictive capacity of the FALS verous cell size relationship in a bacterial community from the North Sea. That analysis showed that a reliable bacterial biovolume prediction of a natural bacterial community can be obtained from FALS using a model generated from natural bacterial community data. CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial biovolume is likely to be related to FALS measurements. It is possible to establish a generally applicable model derived from natural bacterial assemblages for flow cytometric estimation of bacterial biovolumes by light scatter.
TI  - Microstructural factors controlling the survival of food-borne pathogens in porous media.
AB  - The survival of Salmonella typhimurium LT2, Escherichia coli K-12 and Pseudomonas putida in several model porous media poised at a water activity of 0.94 is shown to depend critically on the microstructure of the particulate matrix and the microscopic water distribution. The porous media were made by randomly dispersing a liquid inoculum containing ca. 10(7) cells/ml throughout the pores and interparticle spaces of packed beds of silica particles and Sephadex microspheres. The purely "microstructural stress" effects were isolated by comparison with a homogeneous liquid growth medium having the same water activity. The possibility of exploiting similar microstructural stress effects in food preservation is discussed.
TI  - Role of fatty acid de novo biosynthesis in polyhydroxyalkanoic acid (PHA) and rhamnolipid synthesis by pseudomonads: establishment of the transacylase (PhaG)-mediated pathway for PHA biosynthesis in Escherichia coli.
AB  - Since Pseudomonas aeruginosa is capable of biosynthesis of polyhydroxyalkanoic acid (PHA) and rhamnolipids, which contain lipid moieties that are derived from fatty acid biosynthesis, we investigated various fab mutants from P. aeruginosa with respect to biosynthesis of PHAs and rhamnolipids. All isogenic fabA, fabB, fabI, rhlG, and phaG mutants from P. aeruginosa showed decreased PHA accumulation and rhamnolipid production. In the phaG (encoding transacylase) mutant rhamnolipid production was only slightly decreased. Expression of phaG from Pseudomonas putida and expression of the beta-ketoacyl reductase gene rhlG from P. aeruginosa in these mutants indicated that PhaG catalyzes diversion of intermediates of fatty acid de novo biosynthesis towards PHA biosynthesis, whereas RhlG catalyzes diversion towards rhamnolipid biosynthesis. These data suggested that both biosynthesis pathways are competitive. In order to investigate whether PhaG is the only linking enzyme between fatty acid de novo biosynthesis and PHA biosynthesis, we generated five Tn5 mutants of P. putida strongly impaired in PHA production from gluconate. All mutants were complemented by the phaG gene from P. putida, indicating that the transacylase-mediated PHA biosynthesis route represents the only metabolic link between fatty acid de novo biosynthesis and PHA biosynthesis in this bacterium. The transacylase-mediated PHA biosynthesis route from gluconate was established in recombinant E. coli, coexpressing the class II PHA synthase gene phaC1 together with the phaG gene from P. putida, only when fatty acid de novo biosynthesis was partially inhibited by triclosan. The accumulated PHA contributed to 2 to 3% of cellular dry weight.
TI  - Expression of the p20 gene from Bacillus thuringiensis H-14 increases Cry11A toxin production and enhances mosquito-larvicidal activity in recombinant gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Experimental analyses with recombinant Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida transformed with plasmids bearing genes coding for the Cry11A toxin and P20 protein from Bacillus thuringiensis H-14 showed that cells producing both proteins were more toxic when fed to third-instar Aedes aegypti larvae than were cells expressing cry11A alone; the 50% lethal concentrations were in the range of 10(4) to 10(5) cells/ml. Western blots revealed a higher production of Cry11A when the p20 gene was coexpressed. Cry11A was detected primarily in insoluble form in recombinant cells. Cry11A was not detected in P. putida when P20 was not coproduced, and these recombinants were not toxic to larvae, whereas P. putida recombinants producing both proteins were toxic at concentrations similar to those for E. coli. A coelution experiment was conducted, in which a p20 gene construct producing the P20 protein with an extension of six histidines on the C terminus was mixed with the Cry11A protein. The results showed that Cry11A bound to the P20(His(6)) on a nickel chelating column, whereas Cry11A produced without the P20(His(6)) protein was washed through the column, thus indicating that Cry11A and P20 physically interact. Thus, P20 protein either stabilizes Cry11A or helps it attain the folding important for its toxic activity.
TI  - Plasmid-encoded catalase KatA, the main catalase of Pseudomonas fluorescens strain Cb36.
AB  - The plasmid-state catalase gene katA of the phenol gradative Pseudomonas fluorescens isolate Cb36 has been characterized and shown to be the major catalase of this strain. The predicted amino acid sequence of KatA revealed significant similarity with the catalase sequence from Neisseria meningitidis and has probably the non-pseudomonad origin. The specific activity of catalase was investigated and elevated catalase activity was found in stationary phase cells. The consensus sequence for promoters recognized by the stationary phase sigma factor sigma(s) was found 212 bp upstream of the putative ATG start codon. The ability of KatA to detoxify a high concentration of hydrogen peroxide and protect Pseudomonas putida and Escherichia coli cells was shown.
TI  - Insights into the genetic diversity of initial dioxygenases from PAH-degrading bacteria.
AB  - Alpha subunit genes of initial polyaromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) dioxygenases were used as targets for the PCR detection of PAH-degrading strains of the genera Pseudomonas, Comamonas and Rhodococcus which were obtained from activated sludge or soil samples. Sequence analysis of PCR products from several Pseudomonas strains showed that alpha subunits (nahAc allele) of this genus are highly conserved. PCR primers for the specific detection of alpha subunit genes of initial PAH dioxygenases from Pseudomonas strains were not suitable for detecting the corresponding genes from the genera Comamonas and Rhodococcus. Southern analysis using a heterologous gene probe derived from the P. putida OUS82 PAH dioxygenase alpha subunit identified segments of the PAH-degradation gene cluster from C. testosteroni strain H. Parts of this gene cluster containing three subunits of the initial PAH dioxygenase were isolated. These three subunits [ferredoxin (pahAb), alpha (pahAc) and beta (pahAd) subunit] were amplified by PCR as one fragment and expressed in Escherichia coli DH5alpha, resulting in an active initial dioxygenase with the ability to transform indole and phenanthrene. The DNA sequence alignment of alpha subunits from C. testosteroni H and various PAH-degrading bacteria permitted the design of new primers and oligonucleotide probes which are useful for the detection of the initial PAH dioxygenases from strains of Pseudomonas, Comamonas and Rhodococcus.
TI  - A broad host range replicon with different requirements for replication initiation in three bacterial species.
AB  - Plasmid RK2 is unusual in its ability to replicate stably in a wide range of Gram-negative bacteria. The replication origin (oriV) and a plasmid-encoded initiation protein (TrfA; expressed as 33 and 44 kDa forms) are essential for RK2 replication. To examine initiation events in bacteria unrelated to Escherichia coli, the genes encoding the replicative helicase, DnaB, of Pseudomonas putida and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were isolated and used to construct protein expression vectors. The purified proteins were tested for activity along with E.coli DnaB at RK2 oriV. Each helicase could be recruited and activated at the RK2 origin in the presence of the host-specific DnaA protein and the TrfA protein. Escherichia coli or P.putida DnaB was active with either TrfA-33 or TrfA-44, while P.aeruginosa DnaB required TrfA-44 for activation. Moreover, unlike the E.coli DnaB helicase, both Pseudomonas helicases could be delivered and activated at oriV in the absence of an ATPase accessory protein. Thus, a DnaC-like accessory ATPase is not universally required for loading the essential replicative helicase at a replication origin.
TI  - The iron- and temperature-regulated cjrBC genes of Shigella and enteroinvasive Escherichia coli strains code for colicin Js uptake.
AB  - A cosmid library of DNA from colicin Js-sensitive enteroinvasive Escherichia coli (EIEC) strain O164 was made in colicin Js-resistant strain E. coli VCS257, and colicin Js-sensitive clones were identified. Sensitivity to colicin Js was associated with the carriage of a three-gene operon upstream of and partially overlapping senB. The open reading frames were designated cjrABC (for colicin Js receptor), coding for proteins of 291, 258, and 753 amino acids, respectively. Tn7 insertions in any of them led to complete resistance to colicin Js. A near-consensus Fur box was found upstream of cjrA, suggesting regulation of the cjr operon by iron levels. CjrA protein was homologous to iron-regulated Pseudomonas aeruginosa protein PhuW, whose function is unknown; CjrB was homologous to the TonB protein from Pseudomonas putida; and CjrC was homologous to a putative outer membrane siderophore receptor from Campylobacter jejuni. Cloning experiments showed that the cjrB and cjrC genes are sufficient for colicin Js sensitivity. Uptake of colicin Js into sensitive bacteria was dependent on the ExbB protein but not on the E. coli K-12 TonB and TolA, -B, and -Q proteins. Sensitivity to colicin Js is positively regulated by temperature via the VirB protein and negatively controlled by the iron source through the Fur protein. Among EIEC strains, two types of colicin Js-sensitive phenotypes were identified that differed in sensitivity to colicin Js by 1 order of magnitude. The difference in sensitivity to colicin Js is not due to differences between the sequences of the CjrB and CjrC proteins.
TI  - Functional analyses of Bph-Tod hybrid dioxygenase, which exhibits high degradation activity toward trichloroethylene.
AB  - Biphenyl dioxygenase (BphDox) in Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes KF707 is a multicomponent enzyme consisting of an iron-sulfur protein (ISP) that is composed of alpha (BphA1) and beta (BphA2) subunits, a ferredoxin (FD(BphA3)), and a ferredoxin reductase (FDR(BphA4)). A recombinant Escherichia coli strain expressing hybrid Dox that had replaced BphA1 with TodC1 (alpha subunit of toluene dioxygenase (TolDox) of Pseudomonas putida) exhibited high activity toward trichloroethylene (TCE) (Furukawa, K., Hirose, J., Hayashida, S., and Nakamura, K. (1994) J. Bacteriol. 176, 2121-2123). In this study, ISP, FD, and FDR were purified and characterized. Reconstitution of the dioxygenase components consisting of purified ISP(TodC1BphA2), FD(BphA3), and FDR(BphA4) exhibited oxygenation activities toward biphenyl, toluene, and TCE. Native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by the Ferguson plot analyses demonstrated that ISP(TodC1BphA2) and ISP(BphA1A2) were present as heterohexamers, whereas ISP(TodC1C2) was present as a heterotetramer. The molecular activity (k(0)) of the hybrid Dox for TCE was 4.1 min(-1), which is comparable to that of TolDox. The K(m) value of the hybrid Dox for TCE was 130 microm, which was lower than 250 microm for TolDox. These results suggest that the alpha subunit of ISP is crucial for the determination of substrate specificity and that the change in the alpha subunit conformation of ISP from alpha(2)beta(2) to alpha(3)beta(3) results in the acquisition of higher affinity to TCE, which may lead to high TCE degradation activity.
TI  - Monitoring of bacteria growth using a wireless, remote query resonant-circuit sensor: application to environmental sensing.
AB  - A new technique is presented for in-vivo remote query measurement of the complex  permittivity spectra of a biological culture solution. A sensor comprised of a printed inductor-capacitor resonant-circuit is placed within the culture solution of interest, with the impedance spectrum of the sensor measured using a remotely located loop antenna; the complex permittivity spectra of the culture is calculated from the measured impedance spectrum. The remote query nature of the sensor platform enables, for example, the in-vivo real-time monitoring of bacteria or yeast growth from within sealed opaque containers. The wireless monitoring technique does not require a specific alignment between sensor and antenna. Results are presented for studies conducted on laboratory strains of Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli JM109, Pseudomonas putida and Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
TI  - Dual system to reinforce biological containment of recombinant bacteria designed  for rhizoremediation.
AB  - Active biological containment (ABC) systems have been designed to control at will the survival or death of a bacterial population. These systems are based on the use of a killing gene, e.g., a porin-inducing protein such as the one encoded by the Escherichia coli gef gene, and a regulatory circuit that controls expression of the killing gene in response to the presence or absence of environmental signals. An ABC system for recombinant microorganisms that degrade a model pollutant was designed on the basis of the Pseudomonas putida TOL plasmid meta-cleavage regulatory circuit. The system consists of a fusion of the Pm promoter to lacI, whose expression is controlled by XylS with 3-methylbenzoate, and a fusion of a synthetic P(lac) promoter to gef. In the presence of the model pollutant, bacterial cells survived and degraded the target compound, whereas in the absence of the aromatic carboxylic acid cell death was induced. The system had two main drawbacks: (i) the slow death of the bacterial cells in soil versus the fast killing rate in liquid cultures in laboratory assays, and (ii) the appearance of mutants, at a rate of about 10(-8) per cell and generation, that did not die after the pollutant had been exhausted. We reinforced the ABC system by including it in a Deltaasd P. putida background. A P. putida Deltaasd mutant is viable only in complex medium supplemented with diaminopimelic acid, methionine, lysine, and threonine. We constructed a P. putida Deltaasd strain, called MCR7, with a Pm::asd fusion in the host chromosome. This strain was viable in the presence of 3-methylbenzoate because synthesis of the essential metabolites was achieved through XylS-dependent induction. In the P. putida MCR7 strain, an ABC system (Pm::lacI, xylS, P(lac)::gef) was incorporated into the host chromosome to yield strain MCR8. The number of MCR8 mutants that escaped killing was below our detection limit (<10(-9) mutants per cell and generation). The MCR8 strain survived and colonized rhizosphere soil with 3-methylbenzoate at a level similar to that of the wild-type strain. However, it disappeared in less than 20 to 25 days in soils without the pollutant, whereas an asd(+), biologically contained counterpart such as P. putida CMC4 was still detectable in soils after 100 days.
TI  - Regulation of rpoS gene expression in Pseudomonas: involvement of a TetR family regulator.
AB  - The rpoS gene encodes the sigma factor which was identified in several gram-negative bacteria as a central regulator during stationary phase. rpoS gene regulation is known to respond to cell density, showing higher expression in stationary phase. For Pseudomonas aeruginosa, it has been demonstrated that the cell-density-dependent regulation response known as quorum sensing interacts with this regulatory response. Using the rpoS promoter of P. putida, we identified a genomic Tn5 insertion mutant of P. putida which showed a 90% decrease in rpoS promoter activity, resulting in less RpoS being present in a cell at stationary phase. Molecular analysis revealed that this mutant carried a Tn5 insertion in a gene, designated psrA (Pseudomonas sigma regulator), which codes for a protein (PsrA) of 26.3 kDa. PsrA contains a helix-turn-helix motif typical of DNA binding proteins and belongs to the TetR family of bacterial regulators. The homolog of the psrA gene was identified in P. aeruginosa; the protein showed 90% identity to PsrA of P. putida. A psrA::Tn5 insertion mutant of P. aeruginosa was constructed. In both Pseudomonas species, psrA was genetically linked to the SOS lexA repressor gene. Similar to what was observed for P. putida, a psrA null mutant of P. aeruginosa also showed a 90% reduction in rpoS promoter activity; both mutants could be complemented for rpoS promoter activity when the psrA gene was provided in trans. psrA mutants of both Pseudomonas species lost the ability to induce rpoS expression at stationary phase, but they retained the ability to produce quorum-sensing autoinducer molecules. PsrA was demonstrated to negatively regulate psrA gene expression in Pseudomonas and in Escherichia coli as well as to be capable of activating the rpoS promoter in E. coli. Our data suggest that PsrA is an important regulatory protein of Pseudomonas spp. involved in the regulatory cascade controlling rpoS gene regulation in response to cell density.
TI  - Conformational analysis of putative regulatory subunit D of the toluene/o-xylene-monooxygenase complex from Pseudomonas stutzeri OX1.
AB  - A gene cluster isolated from Pseudomonas stutzeri OX1 genomic DNA and containing  six ORFs codes for toluene/o-xylene-monooxygenase. The putative regulatory D subunit was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified. Its protein sequence was verified by mass spectrometry mapping and found to be identical to the sequence predicted on the basis of the DNA sequence. The surface topology of subunit D in solution was probed by limited proteolysis carried out under strictly controlled conditions using several proteases as proteolytic probes. The same experiments were carried out on the homologous P2 component of the multicomponent phenol hydroxylase from Pseudomonas putida CF600. The proteolytic fragments released from both proteins in their native state were analyzed by electrospray mass spectrometry, and the preferential cleavage sites were assessed. The results indicated that despite the relatively high similarity between the sequences of the two proteins, some differences in the distribution of preferential proteolytic cleavages were detected, and a much higher conformational flexibility of subunit D was inferred. Moreover, automatic modeling of subunit D was attempted, based on the known three-dimensional structure of P2. Our results indicate that, at least in this case, standard modeling procedures based on automatic alignment on the structure of P2 fail to produce a model consistent with limited proteolysis experimental data. Thus, it is our opinion that reliable techniques such as limited proteolysis can be employed to test three-dimensional models and highlight problems in automatic model building.
TI  - Isolation of a new broad-host-range IncQ-like plasmid, pTC-F14, from the acidophilic bacterium Acidithiobacillus caldus and analysis of the plasmid replicon.
AB  - A moderately thermophilic (45 to 50 degrees C), highly acidophilic (pH 1.5 to 2.5), chemolithotrophic Acidithiobacillus caldus strain, f, was isolated from a biooxidation process used to treat nickel ore. Trans-alternating field electrophoresis analysis of total DNA from the A. caldus cells revealed two plasmids of approximately 14 and 45 kb. The 14-kb plasmid, designated pTC-F14, was cloned and shown by replacement of the cloning vector with a kanamycin resistance gene to be capable of autonomous replication in Escherichia coli. Autonomous replication was also demonstrated in Pseudomonas putida and Agrobacterium tumefaciens LBA 4404, which suggested that pTC-F14 is a broad-host-range plasmid. Sequence analysis of the pTC-F14 replicon region revealed five open reading frames and a replicon organization like that of the broad-host-range IncQ plasmids. Three of the open reading frames encoded replication proteins which were most closely related to those of IncQ-like plasmid pTF-FC2 (amino acid sequence identities: RepA, 81%; RepB, 78%; RepC, 74%). However, the two plasmids were fully compatible and pTC-F14 represents a new IncQ-like plasmid replicon. Surprisingly, asymmetrical incompatibility was found with the less closely related IncQ plasmid R300B derivative pKE462 and the IncQ-like plasmid derivative pIE1108. Analysis of the pTC-F14 oriV region revealed five direct repeats consisting of three perfectly conserved 22-bp iterons flanked by iterons of 23 and 21 bp. Plasmid pTC-F14 had a copy number of 12 to 16 copies per chromosome in both E. coli, and A. caldus. The rep gene products of pTC-F14 and pTF-FC2 were unable to functionally complement each other's oriV regions, but replication occurred when the genes for each plasmid's own RepA, RepB, and RepC proteins were provided in trans. Two smaller open reading frames were found between the repB and repA genes of pTC-F14, which encode proteins with high amino acid sequence identity (PasA, 81%; PasB, 72%) to the plasmid addiction system of pTF-FC2. This is the second time a plasmid stability system of this type has been found on an IncQ-like plasmid.
TI  - Structural and functional analysis of the phosphonoacetate hydrolase (phnA) gene  region in Pseudomonas fluorescens 23F.
AB  - The Pseudomonas fluorescens 23F phosphonoacetate hydrolase gene (phnA) encodes a  novel carbon-phosphorus bond cleavage enzyme whose expression is independent of the phosphate status of the cell. Analysis of the regions adjacent to the phosphonoacetate hydrolase structural gene (phnA) indicated the presence of five open reading frames (ORFs). These include one (phnR) whose putative product shows high levels of homology to the LysR family of positive transcriptional regulators. Its presence was shown to be necessary for induction of the hydrolase activity. 2-Phosphonopropionate was found to be an inducer (and poor substrate) for phosphonoacetate hydrolase. Unlike phosphonoacetate, which is also an inducer of phosphonoacetate hydrolase, entry of 2-phosphonopropionate into cells appeared to be dependent on the presence of a gene (phnB) that lies immediately downstream of phnA and whose putative product shows homology to the glycerol-3-phosphate transporter. RNA analysis revealed transcripts for the phnAB and phnR operons, which are transcribed divergently; the resulting mRNAs overlapped by 29 nucleotide bases at their 5' ends. Transcripts of phnAB were detected only in cells grown in the presence of phosphonoacetate, whereas transcripts of phnR were observed in cells grown under both induced and uninduced conditions. The expression of three additional genes found in the phnA region did not appear necessary for the degradation of phosphonoacetate and 2-phosphonopropionate by either Pseudomonas putida or Escherichia coli cells.
TI  - Cloning and biochemical characterization of Co(2+)-activated bromoperoxidase-esterase (perhydrolase) from Pseudomonas putida IF-3 strain.
AB  - The gene encoding Co(2+)-activated bromoperoxidase (BPO)-esterase (EST), catalyzing the organic acid-assisted bromination of some organic compounds with H2O2 and Br(-) and quite specific hydrolysis of (R)-acetylthioisobutyric acid methyl ester, was cloned from the chromosomal DNA of the Pseudomonas putida IF-3 strain. The bpo-est gene comprises 831 bp and encoded a protein of 30181 Da. The enzyme was expressed at a high level in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity by ammonium sulfate fractionation and two-step column chromatographies. The recombinant enzyme required acetic acid, propionic acid, isobutyric acid or n-butyric acid in addition to H2O2 and Br(-) for the brominating reaction and was activated by Co(2+) ions. It catalyzed the bromination of styrene and indene to give the corresponding racemic bromohydrin. Although the enzyme did not release free peracetic acid in the reaction mixture, chemical reaction with peracetic acid could well explain such enzymatic reactions via a peracetic acid intermediate. The results indicated that the enzyme was a novel Co(2+)-activated organic acid-dependent BPO (perhydrolase)-EST, belonging to the non-metal haloperoxidase-hydrolase family.
TI  - Biotransformations catalyzed by cloned p-cymene monooxygenase from Pseudomonas putida F1.
AB  - p-Cymene monooxygenase (CMO) from Pseudomonas putida F1 consists of a hydroxylase (CymA1) and a reductase component (CymA2) which initiate pcymene (p-isopropyltoluene) catabolism by oxidation of the methyl group to p-isopropylbenzyl alcohol (p-cumic alcohol). To study the possible diverse range of substrates catalyzed by CMO, the cymA1A2 genes were cloned in an Escherichia coli pT7-5 expression system and the cells were used in transformation experiments. The tested substrates include different substituents on the aromatic ring at the 2 (ortho), 3 (meta) or 4 (para) position relative to the methyl moiety. As a result, a distinct preference was observed for substrates containing at least an alkyl or heteroatom substituent at the para-position of toluene. The conversion rate of 4-chlorotoluene or 4-methylthiotoluene to the corresponding benzyl alcohol was found to be as good as the canonical substrate, p-cymene. But 3-chlorotoluene, 4-fluorotoluene and 4-nitrotoluene were relatively poor substrates. CMO is also capable of producing styrene oxide from styrene. However, the oxidation of 4-chlorostyrene to 4-chlorostyrene oxide was by far the fastest among the substrates used in this study. The various biotransformation products were identified by a combined solid phase microextraction/gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric analytical technique.
TI  - Simultaneous chromium(VI) reduction and phenol degradation in a fixed-film coculture bioreactor: reactor performance.
AB  - Simultaneous Cr(VI) reduction and phenol degradation was observed in a fixed-film bioreactor consisting of a coculture of phenol-degrading bacteria, Pseudomonas putida DMP-1, and Cr(VI)-reducing bacteria, Escherichia coli ATCC 33456. Near complete Cr(VI) reduction and phenol degradation was observed during steady-state operation of the reactor under loadings of 5-21 mg Cr(VI) l-1 d-1 and 840-3350 mg phenol l-1 d-1. 2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde (2HMSA), succinate, and acetate were the detected steady-state organic acid metabolites which accounted for 13-23% of TOC in the effluent. Optimum Cr(VI) reduction rate was observed under a Cr(VI) loading of approximately 26.5 mg Cr(VI) l-1 d-1 just before system overload. System overload was characterized by the increase in effluent Cr(VI) and phenol concentrations. System resilience to Cr(VI) toxicity was demonstrated by rapid recovery of biological activity and reduced effluent Cr(VI) and phenol concentrations after off-loading the system from overloaded conditions.
TI  - Effects of mutations in the Pseudomonas putida miaA gene: regulation of the trpE  and trpGDC operons in P. putida by attenuation.
AB  - Tn5 insertion mutants defective in regulation of the Pseudomonas putida trpE and  trpGDC operons by tryptophan were found to contain insertions in the P. putida miaA gene, whose product (in Escherichia coli) modifies tRNA(Trp) and is required for attenuation. Nucleotide sequences upstream of trpE and trpG encode putative leader peptides similar in sequence to leader peptides found in other bacterial species, and the phenotypes of the mutants strongly suggest that transcription of these operons is regulated solely by attenuation.
TI  - Molecular characterization of Pseudomonas putida KT2440 rpoH gene regulation.
AB  - The rpoH gene of Pseudomonas putida KT2440 encoding the heat-shock sigma factor sigma(32) was cloned and sequenced, and the translated gene product was predicted to be a protein of 32.5 kDa. The unambiguous role of the gene as a sigma factor was confirmed because the cloned P. putida gene complemented the growth defect, at 37 and 42 degrees C, of an Escherichia coli rpoH mutant strain. Primer extension analysis showed that in P. putida the rpoH gene is expressed from three promoters in cells growing at 30 degrees C. Two of them, P1 and P3, share homology with the sigma(70)-dependent promoters, while the third one, P2, shows a typical sigma(24)-consensus sequence. The pattern of transcription initiation of the rpoH gene did not change in response to different stresses, i.e. a sudden heat shock or the addition of aromatic compounds. However, the predicted secondary structure of the 5' region of the mRNA derived from the three different promoters suggests regulation at the level of translation efficiency and/or mRNA half-life. An inverted repeat sequence located 20 bp downstream of the rpoH stop codon was shown to function as a terminator in vivo in P. putida growing at temperatures from 18 to 42 degrees C.
TI  - Expression of the gap gene encoding glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase of Streptomyces aureofaciens requires GapR, a member of the AraC/XylS family of transcriptional activators.
AB  - Expression of the gap gene encoding glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) is developmentally regulated, and induced by glucose in Streptomyces aureofaciens. A gene, gapR, encoding a protein similar to the AraC/XylS family of bacterial transcriptional regulators was identified upstream of gap. The gapR gene was constitutively expressed from a single promoter during the course of differentiation. By integrative transformation, via double crossover, a stable null mutant of the gapR gene was obtained. The mutation only slightly affected growth, and had no effect on differentiation of S. aureofaciens. However, transcription of the GAPDH-encoding gap gene was substantially reduced in the S. aureofaciens DeltagapR null mutant, irrespective of carbon source used. Though GAPDH activity was about 1.5-fold lower in the mutant, the substantial enzyme activity remained, suggesting the presence of a second GAPDH which is sufficient to ensure growth. The GapR protein, overproduced in Escherichia coli, was shown to bind upstream of the gap-P promoter region. The results indicate a direct role of GapR in regulation of gap expression in S. aureofaciens.
TI  - Evaluation of the growth and inhibition strength of hydrocarbon solvents against  Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida grown in a two-liquid phase culture system consisting of a medium and organic solvent.
AB  - The growth of microorganisms is often inhibited in a two-liquid phase culture system consisting of an aqueous medium and a large volume of hydrophobic solvent. Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida were cultured in a two-phase system containing a solvent with a log Pow value in a range of 2.1 to 6.0. The increase in the cell mass was monitored by increase in turbidity of the medium phase. We devised a semiquantitative method to evaluate the growth inhibition strength of solvents based on the relative amount of bacterial growth occurring in the two-phase system. Analyses of growth of the bacteria by this method showed that the growth inhibition strength of a given solvent was usually but not always correlated inversely with its polarity. It is clear that growth inhibition strength is not determined simply by polarity of the solvent.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence analysis of 5'-flanking region of salicylate hydroxylase gene, and identification and purification of a LysR-type regulator, SalR.
AB  - The sal gene comprised of 1266 nucleotides encoding salicylate hydroxylase was cloned from the chromosomal DNA of Pseudomonas putida S-1 and sequenced [Suzuki, K., Mizuguchi, M., Ohnishi, K. and Itagaki, E. (1996) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1275, 154-156]. Here, we describe the nucleotide sequences of the regulatory region of the sal gene and an ORF (salR gene) divergently oriented from the sal gene, which encodes the protein SalR. This gene product positively controls sal gene expression at the transcriptional level. The salR gene consists of 930 base pairs starting from a GTG codon and encodes a protein of 309 amino acids with a molecular mass of 34 542 Da. The amino-acid sequence is homologous to LysR-family regulatory proteins such as CatR of P. putida RB1 and has helix-turn-helix DNA binding motif near its N-terminal. Transcription start sites of sal and salR genes were determined to lie 30- and 24-bp upstream of the respective initiation codons and separated from each other by 78 nucleotides. A Shine-Dalgarno sequence and the putative promoter sequences containing -10 and -35 sequences were seen in the sal and salR genes. Expression of the salR gene on a plasmid in Escherichia coli cells was confirmed by DNA mobility shift assay. For the overexpression of the salR gene, it was cloned to pET28a (pSAHR) which was transferred to E. coli BL21 (E. coli BL21/pSAHR), and expressed by an inducer, isopropyl thio-beta-D-galactoside. SalR was further purified to homogeneity from the cell-free extracts in yields of approximately 3 mg.L-1 culture volume. The molecular mass was determined to be 33 kDa and the N-terminal amino-acid sequence was the same as that deduced from the nucleotide sequence of salR gene. Native SalR was also purified to homogeneity from P. putida S-1 with very low contents. The properties of the protein were similar to those of SalR expressed in E. coli.
TI  - Expression of the putative siderophore receptor gene bfrZ is controlled by the extracytoplasmic-function sigma factor BupI in Bordetella bronchiseptica.
AB  - A new gene from Bordetella bronchiseptica, bfrZ encoding a putative siderophore receptor, was identified in a Fur-repressor titration assay. A bfrZ null mutant was constructed by allelic exchange. The protein profile of this mutant is similar to that of the wild-type parent strain. The BfrZ(-)-BfrZ(+) isogenic pair was tested for utilization of 132 different siderophores as iron sources. None of these iron sources acted as a ligand for BfrZ. Translational bfrZ::phoA and transcriptional bfrZ::lacZ fusions were introduced into the B. bronchiseptica bfrZ locus. No alkaline phosphatase or beta-galactosidase activity was detected. Sequence analysis of the bfrZ upstream region revealed the presence of two tightly linked genes, bupI and bupR. Both of these genes are located downstream from a Fur-binding sequence. BupI is homologous to Escherichia coli FecI and Pseudomonas putida PupI and belongs to the family of extracytoplasmic-function sigma factors involved in transcription of genes with extracytoplasmic functions. BupR is homologous to the FecR and PupR antisigma factors and is predicted to be localized in the inner membrane. Similar to the surface signaling receptors FecA and PupB, BfrZ bears an N-terminal extension. We found that bfrZ is not transcribed when bupI and bupR are expressed at the same level. However, overexpression of bupI from a multicopy plasmid triggers bfrZ transcription, and under these conditions BfrZ was detected in membrane fractions. By analogy with the FecI-FecR-FecA and PupI-PupR-PupB systems, our data suggest that bfrZ expression is inducible by binding of the cognate ligand to BfrZ and transduction of a signal through the envelope.
TI  - Chromosomal locus for cadmium resistance in Pseudomonas putida consisting of a cadmium-transporting ATPase and a MerR family response regulator.
AB  - Pseudomonads from environmental sources vary widely in their sensitivity to cadmium, but the basis for this resistance is largely uncharacterized. A chromosomal fragment encoding cadmium resistance was cloned from Pseudomonas putida 06909, a rhizosphere bacterium, and sequence analysis revealed two divergently transcribed genes, cadA and cadR. CadA was similar to cadmium-transporting ATPases known mostly from gram-positive bacteria, and to ZntA, a lead-, zinc-, and cadmium-transporting ATPase from Escherichia coli. CadR was related to the MerR family of response regulators that normally control mercury detoxification in other bacterial systems. A related gene, zntR, regulates zntA in E. coli, but it is not contiguous with zntA in the E. coli genome as cadA and cadR were in P. putida. In addition, unlike ZntA and other CadA homologs, but similar to the predicted product of gene PA3690 in the P. aeruginosa genome, the P. putida CadA sequence had a histidine-rich N-terminal extension. CadR and the product of PA3689 of P. aeruginosa also had histidine-rich C-terminal extensions not found in other MerR family response regulators. Mutational analysis indicated that cadA and cadR are fully responsible for cadmium resistance and partially for zinc resistance. However, unlike zntA, they did not confer significant levels of lead resistance. The cadA promoter was responsive to Cd(II), Pb(II), and Zn(II), while the cadR promoter was only induced by Cd(II). CadR apparently represses its own expression at the transcriptional level. However, CadR apparently does not repress cadA. Homologs of the cadmium-transporting ATPase were detected in many other Pseudomonas species.
TI  - The essential HupB and HupN proteins of Pseudomonas putida provide redundant and  nonspecific DNA-bending functions.
AB  - A protein mixture containing two major components able to catalyze a beta-recombination reaction requiring nonspecific DNA bending was obtained by fractionation of a Pseudomonas putida extract. N-terminal sequence analysis and genomic data base searches identified the major component as an analogue of HupB of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli, encoding one HU protein variant. The minor component of the fraction, termed HupN, was divergent enough from HupB to predict a separate DNA-bending competence. The determinants of the two proteins were cloned and hyperexpressed, and the gene products were purified. Their activities were examined in vitro in beta-recombination assays and in vivo by complementation of the Hbsu function of Bacillus subtilis. HupB and HupN were equally efficient in all tests, suggesting that they are independent and functionally redundant DNA bending proteins. This was reflected in the maintenance of in vivo activity of the final sigma54 Ps promoter of the toluene degradation plasmid, TOL, which requires facilitated DNA bending, in DeltahupB or DeltahupN strains. However, hupB/hupN double mutants were not viable. It is suggested that the requirement for protein-facilitated DNA bending is met in P. putida by two independent proteins that ensure an adequate supply of an essential cellular activity.
TI  - Roles of dimerization in folding and stability of ketosteroid isomerase from Pseudomonas putida biotype B.
AB  - Equilibrium and kinetic analyses have been performed to elucidate the roles of dimerization in folding and stability of KSI from Pseudomonas putida biotype B. Folding was reversible in secondary and tertiary structures as well as in activity. Equilibrium unfolding transition, as monitored by fluorescence and ellipticity measurements, could be modeled by a two-state mechanism without thermodynamically stable intermediates. Consistent with the two-state model, one dimensional (1D) NMR spectra and gel-filtration chromatography analysis did not show any evidence for a folded monomeric intermediate. Interestingly enough, Cys 81 located at the dimeric interface was modified by DTNB before unfolding. This inconsistent result might be explained by increased dynamic motion of the interface residues in the presence of urea to expose Cys 81 more frequently without the dimer dissociation. The refolding process, as monitored by fluorescence change, could best be described by five kinetic phases, in which the second phase was a bimolecular step. Because <30% of the total fluorescence change occurred during the first step, most of the native tertiary structure may be driven to form by the bimolecular step. During the refolding process, negative ellipticity at 225 nm increased very fast within 80 msec to account for >80% of the total amplitude. This result suggests that the protein folds into a monomer containing most of the alpha-helical structures before dimerization. Monitoring the enzyme activity during the refolding process could estimate the activity of the monomer that is not fully active. Together, these results stress the importance of dimerization in the formation and maintenance of the functional native tertiary structure.
TI  - Isolation of the rpoD gene encoding the principal sigma factor of the deep-sea piezophilic bacterium Shewanella violacea strain DSS12 and its overexpression in Escherichia coli.
AB  - The gene encoding the principal a factor (rpoD) of the piezophilic bacterium Shewanella violacea was cloned and sequenced. The rpoD gene was found to encode a polypeptide consisting of 614 amino acid residues, showing 75.6 and 64.3% identity to those of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida, respectively. Comparison with E. coli sigma70 and P. putida sigma70 showed that significant similarity exists in four conserved regions known to be required for promoter recognition and core binding. Using an expression plasmid harboring the rpoD gene, the S. violacea sigma70 factor was overexpressed in E. coli and successfully purified to near homogeneity.
TI  - Two different pathways are involved in the beta-oxidation of n-alkanoic and n-phenylalkanoic acids in Pseudomonas putida U: genetic studies and biotechnological applications.
AB  - In Pseudomonas putida U, the degradation of n-alkanoic and n-phenylalkanoic acids is carried out by two sets of beta-oxidation enzymes (betaI and betaII). Whereas the first one (called betaI) is constitutive and catalyses the degradation of n-alkanoic and n-phenylalkanoic acids very efficiently, the other one (betaII), which is only expressed when some of the genes encoding betaI enzymes are mutated, catabolizes n-phenylalkanoates (n > 4) much more slowly. Genetic studies revealed that disruption or deletion of some of the betaI genes handicaps the growth of P. putida U in media containing n-alkanoic or n-phenylalkanoic acids with an acyl moiety longer than C4. However, all these mutants regained their ability to grow in media containing n-alkanoates as a result of the induction of betaII, but they were still unable to catabolize n-phenylalkanoates completely, as the betaI-FadBA enzymes are essential for the beta-oxidation of certain n-phenylalkanoyl-CoA derivatives when they reach a critical size. Owing to the existence of the betaII system, mutants lacking betaIfadB/A are able to synthesize new poly 3-OH-n-alkanoates (PHAs) and poly 3-OH-n-phenylalkanoates (PHPhAs) efficiently. However, they are unable to degrade these polymers, becoming bioplastic overproducer mutants. The genetic and biochemical importance of these results is reported and discussed.
TI  - Analysis of the pmsCEAB gene cluster involved in biosynthesis of salicylic acid and the siderophore pseudomonine in the biocontrol strain Pseudomonas fluorescens WCS374.
AB  - Mutants of Pseudomonas fluorescens WCS374 defective in biosynthesis of the fluorescent siderophore pseudobactin still display siderophore activity, indicating the production of a second siderophore. A recombinant cosmid clone (pMB374-07) of a WCS374 gene library harboring loci necessary for the biosynthesis of salicylic acid (SA) and this second siderophore pseudomonine was isolated. The salicylate biosynthesis region of WCS374 was localized in a 5-kb EcoRI fragment of pMB374-07. The SA and pseudomonine biosynthesis region was identified by transfer of cosmid pMB374-07 to a pseudobactin-deficient strain of P. putida. Sequence analysis of the 5-kb subclone revealed the presence of four open reading frames (ORFs). Products of two ORFs (pmsC and pmsB) showed homologies with chorismate-utilizing enzymes; a third ORF (pmsE) encoded a protein with strong similarity with enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of siderophores in other bacterial species. The region also contained a putative histidine decarboxylase gene (pmsA). A putative promoter region and two predicted iron boxes were localized upstream of pmsC. We determined by reverse transcriptase-mediated PCR that the pmsCEAB genes are cotranscribed and that expression is iron regulated. In vivo expression of SA genes was achieved in P. putida and Escherichia coli cells. In E. coli, deletions affecting the first ORF (pmsC) diminished SA production, whereas deletion of pmsB abolished it completely. The pmsB gene induced low levels of SA production in E. coli when expressed under control of the lacZ promoter. Several lines of evidence indicate that SA and pseudomonine biosynthesis are related. Moreover, we isolated a Tn5 mutant (374-05) that is simultaneously impaired in SA and pseudomonine production.
TI  - Cell envelope mutants of Pseudomonas putida: physiological characterization and analysis of their ability to survive in soil.
AB  - To generate mutants with altered lipopolysaccharides (LPS) of the wild-type Pseudomonas putida KT2442, we used the mini-Tn5luxAB-Km transposon. A mutant was found among luminescent colonies and selected as a negative clone in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with monoclonal antibody (mAb) 7.3B, which recognizes the O-antigen of P. putida LPS. The DNA region of the LPS mutant interrupted by the minitransposon insertion was cloned and sequenced. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence with protein sequence databases showed similarity to the O-antigen polymerase (Wzy) of Salmonella enterica (muenchen). The wild-type gene was rescued by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), cloned into a broad-host-range plasmid and used to carry out complementation assays. The cloned gene was able to restore the wild-type phenotype of the P. putida wzy mutant. We constructed an isogenic mutant of the luminescent wzy mutant to which an oprL mutation was transferred by homologous recombination with an oprL::xylE cassette. The wzy mutants of P. putida were more sensitive to SDS, deoxycholate and EDTA than the corresponding parental strains. We analysed the ability of wzy, oprL and wzy oprL mutants of P. putida to colonize soil. In comparison with the wild-type strain, the ability of single mutants to colonize soil decreased; this characteristic was more evident for the double mutant, especially at high temperatures.
TI  - Molecular screening for alkane hydroxylase genes in Gram-negative and Gram-positive strains.
AB  - We have developed highly degenerate oligonucleotides for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of genes related to the Pseudomonas oleovorans GPo1 and Acinetobacter sp. ADP1 alkane hydroxylases, based on a number of highly conserved sequence motifs. In all Gram-negative and in two out of three Gram-positive strains able to grow on medium- (C6-C11) or long-chain n-alkanes (C12-C16), PCR products of the expected size were obtained. The PCR fragments were cloned and sequenced and found to encode peptides with 43.2-93.8% sequence identity to the corresponding fragment of the P. oleovorans GPo1 alkane hydroxylase. Strains that were unable to grow on n-alkanes did not yield PCR products with homology to alkane hydroxylase genes. The alkane hydroxylase genes of Acinetobacter calcoaceticus EB104 and Pseudomonas putida P1 were cloned using the PCR products as probes. The two genes allow an alkane hydroxylase-negative mutant of Acinetobacter sp. ADP1 and an Escherichia coli recombinant containing all P. oleovorans alk genes except alkB, respectively, to grow on n-alkanes, showing that the cloned genes do indeed encode alkane hydroxylases.
TI  - Biodegradation, plasmid-encoded catabolic pathways, host factors and cell metabolism.
AB  
TI  - Crystallization and preliminary crystallographic study of the periplasmic domain  of the Escherichia coli TolR protein.
AB  - The TolR protein from Escherichia coli is part of the Tol-Pal multiprotein complex used by group A colicins to penetrate and kill cells. All genes of the Tol-Pal system are conserved in Gram-negative bacteria and this system is thought to play a role in the maintenance of the bacterial envelope integrity, although its exact function is not known. The TolR protein comprises 142 amino acids. The periplasmic domain of the TolR protein has been expressed, purified and crystallized. The crystals belong to the tetragonal space group P4(1)22, with unit-cell parameters a = 46.3, c = 178.0 A. There are one or two molecules in the asymmetric unit. Frozen crystals diffract to at least 3.2 A resolution using synchrotron radiation. Selenomethionine-substituted periplasmic TolR protein is currently being produced in order to use multiwavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD) for phasing.
TI  - Identification and characterization of the dnaA upstream region of Thermus thermophilus.
AB  - The gene order in the dnaA region of Thermus thermophilus was determined. Previously, we showed that the putative oriC of T. thermophilus is located in the dnaA-dnaN intergenic region. In the 4 kb region upstream of the dnaA gene four ORFs were found, all orientated in the same direction which is opposite to that of dnaA. The ORFs were identified as T. thermophilus homologs of gidA, gidB, soj and spo0J of Bacillus subtilis. The gene order spo0J-soj-gidB-gidA-dnaA-dnaN resembles that of B. subtilis, Pseudomonas putida, Coxiella burnetii, Streptomyces coelicolor, Mycobacterium leprae, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. We identified the transcriptional start point of the dnaA gene. The -10 region shows significant homology to the Escherichia coli -10 consensus sequence. The putative -35 region shows homology neither to the E. coli -35 consensus sequence nor to known -35 sequences of T. thermophilus. There are no DnaA boxes in the promoter region, and consequently dnaA transcription is not repressed by DnaA protein in vitro, i.e. the dnaA gene of T. thermophilus is not autoregulated.
TI  - New broad-host-range promoter probe vectors based on the plasmid RK2 replicon.
AB  - Broad-host-range plasmid RK2-based promoter probe vectors with a known nucleotide sequence were constructed. In the absence of an upstream promoter, the expression of two tested reporter genes (luc and lacZ) in Escherichia coli was virtually zero, while insertion of the Ptrc promoter resulted in strong inducer-dependent expression. The lacZ-based vectors were mobilized into Pseudomonas fluorescens ST, Pseudomonas putida KT2442, Sphingomonas spp. and Burkholderia spp. LB400, and expression analyses indicated that the properties observed in E. coli are maintained across the species barriers. In addition, the previously established knowledge of RK2 molecular biology allows easy manipulations of features such as plasmid copy number, further extending the application potential of the vectors.
TI  - Survival rate of microbes after freeze-drying and long-term storage.
AB  - The survival rates of 10 species of microorganisms were investigated after freeze-drying and preserving in a vacuum at 5 degrees C. The survival rates varied with species. The survival rates immediately after freeze-drying were different among yeast, gram-positive bacteria, and gram-negative bacteria, and the change in the 10-year survival rate was species-specific. The survival rate of yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, was about 10% immediately after drying, and the rate did not decrease significantly during the 10-year storage period. Survival rates after the drying of gram-positive bacteria, i.e., Brevibacterium flavum, B. lactofermentum, Corynebacterium acetoacidophilum, C. gultamicum, and Streptococcus mutans, were around 80%. The survival rate of Brevibacterium and Corynebacterium did not decrease greatly during the storage period, whereas the rate of S. mutans decreased to about 20% after 10 years. Survival rates after the drying of gram-negative bacteria, i.e., Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas putida, Serratia marcescens, and Alcaligenes faecalis, were around 50%. The survival rate decreased for the first 5 years and then stabilized to around 10% thereafter.
TI  - Rational design of a bacterial transcriptional cascade for amplifying gene expression capacity.
AB  - Cascade regulatory circuits have been described that control numerous cell processes, and may provide models for the design of artificial circuits with novel properties. Here we describe the design of a transcriptional regulatory cascade to amplify the cell response to a given signal. We used the salicylate-responsive activators of Pseudomonas putida NahR of the naphthalene degradation plasmid NAH7 and XylS2, a mutant regulator of the TOL plasmid for catabolism of m-xylene and their respective cognate promoters Psal and PM: Control of the expression of xylS2 with the nahR/Psal system permitted either their selective activation with specific effectors for each protein or the simultaneous activation of both of them with salicylate. When cells face the common effector of the two regulators, both the increase in XylS2 concentration and the stimulation of its activity act synergistically on the PM: promoter, amplifying the gene expression capacity by at least one order of magnitude with respect to the individual systems. By changing the hierarchy of regulators, we showed that the specific features of the downstream regulator were crucial for the amplification effect. Directed changes in the effector profile of the regulators allowed the extension of the amplifying system to other molecular signals.
TI  - Pseudomonas putida CE2010 can degrade biphenyl by a mosaic pathway encoded by the tod operon and cmtE, which are identical to those of P. putida F1 except for a single base difference in the operator-promoter region of the cmt operon.
AB  - Psudomonas putida CE2010 can assimilate biphenyl despite its high similarity to P. putida F1. Biphenyl degradation in strain CE2010 was achieved using a mosaic of pathways consisting of the cmt and tod operons. CmtE hydrolysed 2-hydroxy-6-oxo-6-phenylhexa-2,4-dienoic acid, the meta-cleavage product of 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl. This enzyme was expressed differently in strains CE2010 and F1. A cmtE disruption mutant, a tod operon disruption mutant and a cmt operon disruption mutant were unable to utilize biphenyl. The introduction of the cmtE gene enabled the cmt operon disruption mutant to grow on biphenyl. A single base difference was found in the cmt promoter-operator region in strain CE2010, compared with that of strain F1. CymR protein was purified from Escherichia coli and binding assays were performed, the results of which suggested that the protein bound less strongly to the CE2010 operator sequence than to the F1 operator sequence. Exchanging the F1 promoter-operator fragment into strain CE2010 resulted in a loss of biphenyl degradation capacity. These results indicate that cmtE is not effectively repressed by CymR in strain CE2010, leading to low constitutive expression and, therefore, low growth on biphenyl.
TI  - A novel rolling-circle-replicating plasmid from Pseudomonas putida P8: molecular  characterization and use as vector.
AB  - In Pseudomonas putida P8, three cryptic circular plasmids were detected, i.e. pPP8-1 (2.5 kbp), pPP8-2 (42 kbp) and pPP8-3 (approximately 100 kbp). Cloning and complete sequencing of pPP8-1 revealed a 2534 bp element harbouring four open reading frames (ORFs A, B, C and D). No function could be attributed to the latter three ORFs, whereas the predicted ORF A gene product is homologous to replication proteins known from small multicopy plasmids of Gram-positive bacteria and single-stranded (ss) phages, genetic elements replicating via a rolling circle (RC) mechanism involving characteristic ssDNA intermediates. Consistently, a double-strand origin of replication, highly conserved in rolling-circle-replicating (RCR) elements, was identified in pPP8-1, along with a putative single-strand origin. Beyond this, ss replication intermediates were confirmed by Southern analysis and mungbean-nuclease digestion. This being the first element of this type known in pseudomonads, a kanamycin-resistance gene was ligated into pPP8-1 and the resulting vector was successfully used for the transformation of both Escherichia coli and P. putida.
TI  - Directed evolution of toluene dioxygenase from Pseudomonas putida for improved selectivity toward cis-indandiol during indene bioconversion.
AB  - Toluene dioxygenase (TDO) from Pseudomonas putida F1 converts indene to a mixture of cis-indandiol (racemic), 1-indenol, and 1-indanone. The desired product, cis-(1S,2R)-indandiol, is a potential key intermediate in the chemical synthesis of indinavir sulfate (Crixivan), Merck's HIV-1 protease inhibitor for the treatment of AIDS. To reduce the undesirable byproducts 1-indenol and 1-indanone formed during indene bioconversion, the recombinant TDO expressed in Escherichia coli was evolved by directed evolution using the error-prone polymerase chain reaction (epPCR) method. High-throughput fluorometric and spectrophotometric assays were developed for rapid screening of the mutant libraries in a 96-well format. Mutants with reduced 1-indenol by-product formation were identified, and the individual indene bioconversion product profiles of the selected mutants were confirmed by HPLC. Changes in the amino acid sequence of the mutant enzymes were identified by analyzing the nucleotide sequence of the genes. A mutant with the most desirable product profile from each library, defined as the most reduced 1-indenol concentration and with the highest cis-(1S,2R)-indandiol enantiomeric excess, was used to perform each subsequent round of mutagenesis. After three rounds of mutagenesis and screening, mutant 1C4-3G was identified to have a threefold reduction in 1-indenol formation over the wild type (20% vs 60% of total products) and a 40% increase of product (cis-indandiol) yield.
TI  - Control of the ferric citrate transport system of Escherichia coli: mutations in  region 2.1 of the FecI extracytoplasmic-function sigma factor suppress mutations in the FecR transmembrane regulatory protein.
AB  - Transcription of the ferric citrate transport genes is initiated by binding of ferric citrate to the FecA protein in the outer membrane of Escherichia coli K-12. Bound ferric citrate does not have to be transported but initiates a signal that is transmitted by FecA across the outer membrane and by FecR across the cytoplasmic membrane into the cytoplasm, where the FecI extracytoplasmic-function (ECF) sigma factor becomes active. In this study, we isolated transcription initiation-negative missense mutants in the cytoplasmic region of FecR that were located at four sites, L13Q, W19R, W39R, and W50R, which are highly conserved in FecR-like open reading frames of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas putida, Bordetella pertussis, Bordetella bronchiseptica, and Caulobacter crescentus genomes. The cytoplasmic portion of the FecR mutant proteins, FecR(1-85), did not interact with wild-type FecI, in contrast to wild-type FecR(1-85), which induced FecI-mediated fecB transport gene transcription. Two missense mutations in region 2.1 of FecI, S15A and H20E, partially restored induction of ferric citrate transport gene induction of the fecR mutants by ferric citrate. Region 2.1 of sigma(70) is thought to bind RNA polymerase core enzyme; the residual activity of mutated FecI in the absence of FecR, however, was not higher than that of wild-type FecI. In addition, missense mutations in the fecI promoter region resulted in a twofold increased transcription in fecR wild-type cells and a partial restoration of fec transport gene transcription in the fecR mutants. The mutations reduced binding of the Fe(2+) Fur repressor and as a consequence enhanced fecI transcription. The data reveal properties of the FecI ECF factor distinct from those of sigma(70) and further support the novel transcription initiation model in which the cytoplasmic portion of FecR is important for FecI activity.
TI  - A bioluminescent derivative of Pseudomonas putida KT2440 for deliberate release into the environment.
AB  - Recombinant derivatives of Pseudomonas putida strain KT2440 are of potential interest as microbial inoculants to be deliberately released for agricultural applications. To facilitate tracking of this strain and its derivatives after introduction into the environment, a mini-Tn5-'luxAB transposon was introduced into the chromosome of P. putida KT2440, yielding strain P. putida S1B1. Sequencing of the DNA region located upstream of the 'luxAB genes and similarity search with the P. putida KT2440 genome sequence, localized the transposon within a 3021-bp open reading frame (ORF), whose translated sequence showed significant similarity with the hypothetical YdiJ proteins from Escherichia coli and Haemophilus influenzae. A second ORF adjacent to and divergent from the ydiJ sequence was also found and showed significant homology with various LysR-type transcriptional activator proteins from several bacteria. Disruption of the ydiJ locus in P. putida S1B1 did not affect the survival of the strain in unvegetated or vegetated soils. Bioluminescent detection of P. putida S1B1 cells enriched in selective media directly from soil allowed detection of culturable cells in soil samples over a period of at least 8 months. The addition of the luxAB biomarker facilitates tracking in the root system of several plant species grown under sterile and non-sterile conditions. The correlation of the bioluminescent phenotype with the growth activity of P. putida S1B1 cells colonizing the root system of barley and corn plants was estimated by monitoring ribosomal contents using quantitative hybridization with fluorescence-labeled ribosomal RNA probes. A correlation between inoculum density, light output, and ribosomal contents was found for P. putida cells colonizing the root system of barley seedlings grown under sterile conditions. Although ribosomal contents, and therefore growth activity, of P. putida S1B1 cells extracted from the rhizosphere of corn plants grown in non-sterile soil were similar to those found in starved cells, the luminescent system permitted non-destructive in situ detection of the strain in the upper root system.
TI  - Directed evolution of D-2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate aldolase to new variants for the efficient synthesis of D- and L-sugars.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Exploitation and improvement of enzymes as catalysts for organic synthesis is of current interest in biocatalysis. A representative enzyme for investigation is the Escherichia coli D-2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate (KDPG) aldolase, which catalyzes the highly specific reversible aldol reaction using the D-configurated KDPG as substrate. RESULTS: Using in vitro evolution, the aldolase has been converted into aldolases with improved catalytic efficiency, altered substrate specificity and stereoselectivity. In particular, some evolved aldolases capable of accepting both D- and L- glyceraldehyde in the non-phosphorylated form as substrates for reversible aldol reaction have been obtained, providing a new direction to the enzymatic synthesis of both D- and L-sugars. CONCLUSIONS: This research has demonstrated the effectiveness of using in vitro evolution to rapidly alter the properties of an aldolase to improve its utility in asymmetric synthesis. The evolved aldolases, differing from the native enzyme which is highly phosphate- and D-sugar-dependent, catalyze the efficient synthesis of both D- and L-sugars from non-phosphorylated aldehydes and pyruvate. The principles and strategies described in this study should be applicable to other aldolases to further expand the scope of their synthetic utility.
TI  - Versatile biosensor vectors for detection and quantification of mercury.
AB  - Three different whole cell biosensor constructs were made by fusing the mercury inducible promoter, P(mer), and its regulatory gene, merR, from transposon Tn21 with reporter genes luxCDABE, lacZYA, or gfp. In Escherichia coli these biosensor constructs responded to low levels of mercury by producing light, beta-galactosidase or green fluorescent protein, respectively. Since the responses were quantitative, the constructs were used to quantify bioavailable mercury in different environments. The constructs were cloned into mini-Tn5 delivery vectors, thus enabling the transfer of the mer-lux, mer-lac or mer-gfp cassettes to a variety of Gram-negative bacteria. The mer-lux cassette was transferred to a Pseudomonas putida strain, which was used to quantify water-extractable mercury in contaminated soil.
TI  - Transcription activation by a variety of AraC/XylS family activators does not depend on the class II-specific activation determinant in the N-terminal domain of the RNA polymerase alpha subunit.
AB  - The N-terminal domain of the RNA polymerase alpha subunit (alpha-NTD) was tested  for a role in transcription activation by a variety of AraC/XylS family members. Based on substitutions at residues 162 to 165 and an extensive genetic screen we conclude that alpha-NTD is not an activation target for these activators.
TI  - Genetic and biochemical characterization of 4-carboxy-2-hydroxymuconate-6-semialdehyde dehydrogenase and its role in the protocatechuate 4,5-cleavage pathway in Sphingomonas paucimobilis SYK-6.
AB  - Protocatechuate (PCA) is the key intermediate metabolite in the lignin degradation pathway of Sphingomonas paucimobilis SYK-6 and is metabolized to pyruvate and oxaloacetate via the PCA 4,5-cleavage pathway. We characterized the 4-carboxy-2-hydroxymuconate-6-semialdehyde (CHMS) dehydrogenase gene (ligC). CHMS is the 4,5-cleavage product of PCA and is converted into 2-pyrone-4,6-dicarboxylate (PDC) by LigC. We found that ligC was located 295 bp downstream of ligB, which encodes the large subunit of the PCA 4,5-dioxygenase. The ligC gene consists of a 945-bp open reading frame encoding a polypeptide with a molecular mass of 34,590 Da. The deduced amino acid sequence of ligC showed 19 to 20% identity with 3-chlorobenzoate cis-dihydrodiol dehydrogenase of Alcaligenes sp. strain BR60 and phthalate cis-dihydrodiol dehydrogenases of Pseudomonas putida NMH102-2 and Burkholderia cepacia DBO1, which are unrelated to group I, II, and III microbial alcohol dehydrogenases (M. F. Reid and C. A. Fewson, Crit. Rev. Microbiol. 20:13-56, 1994). The ligC gene was expressed in Escherichia coli and LigC was purified to near homogeneity. Production of PDC from CHMS catalyzed by LigC was confirmed in the presence of NADP(+) by electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. LigC is a homodimer. The isoelectric point, optimum pH, and optimum temperature were estimated to be 5.3, 8.0, and 25 degrees C, respectively. The K(m) for NADP(+) was estimated to be 24.6 +/- 1.5 microM, which was approximately 10 times lower than that for NAD(+) (252 +/- 3.9 microM). The K(m)s for CHMS in the presence of NADP(+) and NAD(+) are 26.0 +/- 0.5 and 20.6 +/- 1.0 microM, respectively. Disruption of ligC in S. paucimobilis SYK-6 prevented growth with vanillate. Only PCA was accumulated during the incubation of vanillate with the whole cells of the ligC insertion mutant (DLC), indicating a lack of PCA 4,5-dioxygenase activity in DLC. However, the introduction of ligC into DLC restored its ability to grow on vanillate. PDC was suggested to be an inducer for ligAB gene expression.
TI  - A transposon carrying the gene mphB for macrolide 2'-phosphotransferase II.
AB  - The mphB gene for macrolide 2'-phosphotransferase II is located on two plasmids,  pTZ3721 and pTZ3723, in Escherichia coli BM2506. We examined translocation of mphB that originated from pTZ3721. The transposable element carrying mphB is 39 kb long and has a Tn21-like transposition module at one end and a Tn1721-like transposition module at other. The structure of the transposition modules of this element resembles that of Tn2610. However, the gene arrangement of the internal region on the transposon carrying mphB was reverse to that of Tn2610. The nucleotide sequences of both terminal regions suggested that the inversion of the DNA fragment occurred between the res sites by resolvase-mediated recombination.
TI  - Exogenous isolation of antibiotic resistance plasmids from piggery manure slurries reveals a high prevalence and diversity of IncQ-like plasmids.
AB  - Antibiotic resistance plasmids were exogenously isolated in biparental matings with piggery manure bacteria as plasmid donors in Escherichia coli CV601 and Pseudomonas putida UWC1 recipients. Surprisingly, IncQ-like plasmids were detected by dot blot hybridization with an IncQ oriV probe in several P. putida UWC1 transconjugants. The capture of IncQ-like plasmids in biparental matings indicates not only their high prevalence in manure slurries but also the presence of efficiently mobilizing plasmids. In order to elucidate unusual hybridization data (weak or no hybridization with IncQ repB or IncQ oriT probes) four IncQ-like plasmids (pIE1107, pIE1115, pIE1120, and pIE1130), each representing a different EcoRV restriction pattern, were selected for a more thorough plasmid characterization after transfer into E. coli K-12 strain DH5alpha by transformation. The characterization of the IncQ-like plasmids revealed an astonishingly high diversity with regard to phenotypic and genotypic properties. Four different multiple antibiotic resistance patterns were found to be conferred by the IncQ-like plasmids. The plasmids could be mobilized by the RP4 derivative pTH10 into Acinetobacter sp., Ralstonia eutropha, Agrobacterium tumefaciens, and P. putida, but they showed diverse patterns of stability under nonselective growth conditions in different host backgrounds. Incompatibility testing and PCR analysis clearly revealed at least two different types of IncQ-like plasmids. PCR amplification of total DNA extracted directly from different manure samples and other environments indicated the prevalence of both types of IncQ plasmids in manure, sewage, and farm soil. These findings suggest that IncQ plasmids play an important role in disseminating antibiotic resistance genes.
TI  - Acquisition of the rfb-gnd cluster in evolution of Escherichia coli O55 and O157.
AB  - The rfb region specifies the structure of lipopolysaccharide side chains that comprise the diverse gram-negative bacterial somatic (O) antigens. The rfb locus is adjacent to gnd, which is a polymorphic gene encoding 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase. To determine if rfb and gnd cotransfer, we sequenced gnd in five O55 and 13 O157 strains of Escherichia coli. E. coli O157:H7 has a gnd allele (allele A) that is only 82% identical to the gnd allele (allele D) of closely related E. coli O55:H7. In contrast, gnd alleles of E. coli O55 in distant lineages are >99.9% identical to gnd allele D. Though gnd alleles B and C in E. coli O157 that are distantly related to E. coli O157:H7 are more similar to allele A than to allele D, there are nucleotide differences at 4 to 6% of their sites. Alleles B and C can be found in E. coli O157 in different lineages, but we have found allele A only in E. coli O157 belonging to the DEC5 lineage. DNA 3' to the O55 gnd allele in diverse E. coli lineages has sequences homologous to tnpA of the Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium IS200 element, E. coli Rhs elements (including an H-rpt gene), and portions of the O111 and O157 rfb regions. We conclude that rfb and gnd cotransferred into E. coli O55 and O157 in widely separated lineages and that recombination was responsible for recent antigenic shifts in the emergence of pathogenic E. coli O55 and O157.
TI  - A battery of toxicity tests as indicators of decontamination in composting oily waste.
AB  - Heterogeneous oily waste from an old dumping site was composted in three windrows constructed from different proportions of waste, sewage sludge, and bark. The objectives of this pilot study were to examine the usefulness of composting as a treatment method for this particular waste and to study decontamination in the composting process by using a battery of toxicity tests. Five samples from the windrow having intermediate oil concentrations were tested with toxicity tests based on microbes (Pseudomonas putida growth inhibition test, ToxiChromotest, MetPLATE, and three different modifications of a luminescent bacterial test), enzyme inhibition (reverse electron transport), plants (duckweed growth inhibition and red clover seed germination), and soil animals (Folsomia candida, Enchytraeus albidus, and Enchytraeus sp.). The luminescent bacterial tests were used as prescreening tests. Chemical analyses of samples were carried out simultaneously. Both toxicity and oil concentration, including those of polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), were reduced during composting and soil quality improved significantly. The total oil hydrocarbon concentration decreased from 90,000 to 19,000 mg/kg, measured with the IR method, in 4 months, and from 86,000 to 1400 mg/kg, measured with GC method. The concentration of PAHs decreased from 135 to 23.5 mg/kg. During the fourth month of composting (stabilization stage), the proportion of the heaviest oil fractions (asphaltenes) became dominant. Toxicity varied between different samples and between different bioassays; however, the first sample was significantly more toxic than the others, and most of the tests revealed a decrease in toxicity during the composting process.
TI  - Commensal interactions in a dual-species biofilm exposed to mixed organic compounds.
AB  - There is limited knowledge of interspecies interactions in biofilm communities. In this study, Pseudomonas sp. strain GJ1, a 2-chloroethanol (2-CE)-degrading organism, and Pseudomonas putida DMP1, a p-cresol-degrading organism, produced distinct biofilms in response to model mixed waste streams composed of 2-CE and various p-cresol concentrations. The two organisms maintained a commensal relationship, with DMP1 mitigating the inhibitory effects of p-cresol on GJ1. A triple-labeling technique compatible with confocal microscopy was used to investigate the influence of toxicant concentrations on biofilm morphology, species distribution, and exopolysaccharide production. Single-species biofilms of GJ1 shifted from loosely associated cell clusters connected by exopolysaccharide to densely packed structures as the p-cresol concentrations increased, and biofilm formation was severely inhibited at high p-cresol concentrations. In contrast, GJ1 was abundant when associated with DMP1 in a dual-species biofilm at all p-cresol concentrations, although at high p-cresol concentrations it was present only in regions of the biofilm where it was surrounded by DMP1. Evidence in support of a commensal relationship between DMP1 and GJ1 was obtained by comparing GJ1-DMP1 biofilms with dual-species biofilms containing GJ1 and Escherichia coli ATCC 33456, an adhesive strain that does not mineralize p-cresol. Additionally, the data indicated that only tower-like cell structures in the GJ1-DMP1 biofilm produced exopolysaccharide, in contrast to the uniform distribution of EPS in the single-species GJ1 biofilm.
TI  - Characterization of three XylT-like [2Fe-2S] ferredoxins associated with catabolism of cresols or naphthalene: evidence for their involvement in catechol dioxygenase reactivation.
AB  - The xylT gene product, a component of the xylene catabolic pathway of Pseudomonas putida mt2, has been recently characterized as a novel [2Fe-2S] ferredoxin which specifically reactivates oxygen-inactivated catechol 2,3-dioxygenase (XylE). In this study, three XylT-like proteins potentially involved in the catabolism of naphthalene (NahT) or cresols (PhhQ and DmpQ) have been overexpressed in Escherichia coli, purified, and compared with respect to their biochemical properties and interaction with XylE. The three XylT analogues show general spectroscopic characteristics common to plant-type [2Fe-2S] ferredoxins as well as distinctive features that appear to be typical for the XylT subgroup of these proteins. The midpoint redox potentials of the PhhQ and DmpQ proteins were -286 mV and -323 mV, respectively. Interestingly, all purified XylT-like proteins promoted in vitro reactivation of XylE almost as efficiently as XylT. The interaction of XylE with XylT and its analogues was studied by cross-linking experiments using the 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide. A polypeptide band with an M(r) of 46,000, which corresponded to the cross-linked product between one XylE subunit and one molecule of ferredoxin, was obtained in all cases. The formation of the complex was affected by ionic strength, indicating that electrostatic forces are involved in the dioxygenase-ferredoxin interaction. In complementation experiments, plasmids expressing xylT or its analogues were introduced into an XylT-null mutant of P. putida which is unable to grow on p-methylbenzoate. All transconjugants regained the wild-type phenotype, indicating that all analogues can substitute for XylT in the in vivo reactivation of XylE. Our results provide evidence for a subgroup of [2Fe-2S] ferredoxins with distinct biochemical properties whose specific function is to reactivate intrinsically labile extradiol ring cleavage dioxygenases involved in the catabolism of various aromatic hydrocarbons.
TI  - Regioselectivity and enantioselectivity of naphthalene dioxygenase during arene cis-dihydroxylation: control by phenylalanine 352 in the alpha subunit.
AB  - The naphthalene dioxygenase (NDO) system catalyzes the first step in the degradation of naphthalene by Pseudomonas sp. strain NCIB 9816-4. The enzyme has a broad substrate range and catalyzes several types of reactions including cis-dihydroxylation, monooxygenation, and desaturation. Substitution of valine or leucine at Phe-352 near the active site iron in the alpha subunit of NDO altered the stereochemistry of naphthalene cis-dihydrodiol formed from naphthalene and also changed the region of oxidation of biphenyl and phenanthrene. In this study, we replaced Phe-352 with glycine, alanine, isoleucine, threonine, tryptophan, and tyrosine and determined the activity with naphthalene, biphenyl, and phenanthrene as substrates. NDO variants F352W and F352Y were marginally active with all substrates tested. F352G and F352A had reduced but significant activity, and F352I, F352T, F352V, and F352L had nearly wild-type activities with respect to naphthalene oxidation. All active enzymes had altered regioselectivity with biphenyl and phenanthrene. In addition, the F352V and F352T variants formed the opposite enantiomer of biphenyl cis-3,4-dihydrodiol [77 and 60% (-)-(3S,4R), respectively] to that formed by wild-type NDO [>98% (+)-(3R,4S)]. The F352V mutant enzyme also formed the opposite enantiomer of phenanthrene cis-1,2-dihydrodiol from phenanthrene to that formed by biphenyl dioxygenase from Sphingomonas yanoikuyae B8/36. A recombinant Escherichia coli strain expressing the F352V variant of NDO and the enantioselective toluene cis-dihydrodiol dehydrogenase from Pseudomonas putida F1 was used to produce enantiomerically pure (-)-biphenyl cis-(3S,4R)-dihydrodiol and (-)-phenanthrene cis-(1S,2R)-dihydrodiol from biphenyl and phenanthrene, respectively.
TI  - Site-directed mutagenesis of potential catalytic residues in 1H-3-hydroxy-4-oxoquinoline 2,4-dioxygenase, and hypothesis on the catalytic mechanism of 2,4-dioxygenolytic ring cleavage.
AB  - 1H-3-Hydroxy-4-oxoquinoline 2,4-dioxygenase (Qdo) is a cofactor-free dioxygenase  proposed to belong to the alpha/beta hydrolase fold superfamily of enzymes. Alpha/beta Hydrolases contain a highly conserved catalytic triad (nucleophile-acidic residue-histidine). We previously identified a corresponding catalytically essential histidine residue in Qdo. However, as shown by amino acid replacements through site-directed mutagenesis, nucleophilic and acidic residues of Qdo considered as possible triad residues were not absolutely required for activity. This suggests that Qdo does not contain the canonical catalytic triad of the alpha/beta hydrolase fold enzymes. Some radical trapping agents affected the Qdo-catalyzed reaction. A hypothetical mechanism of Qdo-catalyzed dioxygenation of 1H-3-hydroxy-4-oxoquinoline is compared with the dioxygenation of FMNH2 catalyzed by bacterial luciferase, which also uses a histidine residue as catalytic base.
TI  - Cloning and expression of the nitrile hydratase and amidase genes from Bacillus sp. BR449 into Escherichia coli.
AB  - A moderate thermophile, Bacillus sp. BR449 was previously shown to exhibit a high level of nitrile hydratase (NHase) activity when growing on high levels of acrylonitrile at 55 degrees C. In this report, we describe the cloning of a 6.1 kb SalI DNA fragment encoding the NHase gene cluster of BR449 into Escherichia coli. Nucleotide sequencing revealed six ORFs encoding (in order), two unidentified putative proteins, amidase, NHase beta- and alpha-subunits and a small putative protein of 101 amino acids designated P12K. Spacings and orientation of the coding regions as well as their gene expression in E. coli suggest that the beta-subunit, alpha-subunit, and P12K genes are co-transcribed. Analysis of deduced amino acid sequences indicate that the amidase (348 aa, MW 38.6 kDa) belongs to the nitrilase-related aliphatic amidase family, and that the NHase beta- (229 aa, MW 26.5 kDa) and alpha- (214 aa, MW 24.5 kDa) subunits comprise a cobalt-containing member of the NHase family, which includes Rhodococcus rhodochrous J1 and Pseudomonas putida 5B NHases. The amidase/NHase gene cluster differs both in arrangement and composition from those described for other NHase-producing strains. When expressed in Escherichia coli DH5alpha, the subcloned NHase genes produced significant levels of active NHase enzyme when cobalt ion was added either to the culture medium or cell extracts. Presence of the P12K gene and addition of amide compounds as inducers were not required for this expression.
TI  - Analysis of the Thiocapsa pfennigii polyhydroxyalkanoate synthase: subcloning, molecular characterization and generation of hybrid synthases with the corresponding Chromatium vinosum enzyme.
AB  - The PHA synthase structural gene of Thiocapsa pfennigii was identified and subcloned on a 2.8-kbp BamHI restriction fragment, which was cloned recently from a genomic 15.6-kbp EcoRI restriction fragment. Nucleotide sequence analysis of this fragment revealed three open reading frames (ORFs), representing coding regions. Two ORFs encoded for the PhaE (Mr 40,950) and PhaC (Mr 40,190) subunits of the PHA synthase from T. pfennigii and exhibited high homology with the corresponding proteins of the Chromatium vinosum (52.8% and 85.2% amino acid identity) and the Thiocystis violacea (52.5% and 82.4%) PHA synthases, respectively. This confirmed that the T. pfennigii PHA synthase was composed of two different subunits. Also, with respect to the molecular organization of phaE and phaC, this region of the T. pfennigii genome resembled very much the corresponding regions of C. vinosum and of Thiocystis violacea. A recombinant strain of Pseudomonas putida, which overexpressed phaE and phaC from T. pfennigii, was used to isolate the PHA synthase by a two-step procedure including chromatography on Procion Blue H-ERD and hydroxyapatite. The isolated PHA synthase consisted of two proteins exhibiting the molecular weights predicted for PhaE and PhaC. Hybrid PHA synthases composed of PhaE from T. pfennigii and PhaC from C. vinosum and vice versa were constructed and functionally expressed in a PHA-negative mutant of P. putida; and the resulting PHAs were analyzed.
TI  - Anhydrobiotic engineering of gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Anhydrobiotic engineering aims to improve desiccation tolerance in living organisms by adopting the strategies of anhydrobiosis. This was achieved for Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida by osmotic induction of intracellular trehalose synthesis and by drying from trehalose solutions, resulting in long-term viability in the dried state.
TI  - Crystal structure of the pyridoxal 5'-phosphate dependent L-methionine gamma-lyase from Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - L-Methionine gamma-lyase (MGL) catalyzes the pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) dependent alpha,gamma-elimination of L-methionine. We have determined two crystal structures of MGL from Pseudomonas putida using MAD (multiwavelength anomalous diffraction) and molecular replacement methods. The structures have been refined to an R-factor of 21.1% at 2.0 and 1.7 A resolution using synchrotron radiation diffraction data. A homotetramer with 222 symmetry is built up by non-crystallographic symmetry. Two monomers associate to build the active dimer. The spatial fold of subunits, with three functionally distinct domains and their quarternary arrangement, is similar to those of L-cystathionine beta-lyase and L-cystathionine gamma-synthase from Escherichia coli.
TI  - Genetic analysis of an incomplete mutS gene from Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - We genetically characterized the Pseudomonas putida mutS gene and found that it encodes a smaller MutS protein than do the genes of other bacteria. This gene is able to function in the mutS mutants of Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis. A P. putida mutS mutant has a mutation frequency 1,000-fold greater than that of the wild-type strain.
TI  - Mutations in each of the tol genes of Pseudomonas putida reveal that they are critical for maintenance of outer membrane stability.
AB  - The outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria functions as a permeability barrier  that protects cells against a large number of antibacterial agents. OprL protein of Pseudomonas putida has been shown to be crucial to maintain the stability of this cell component (J. J. Rodriguez-Herva, M.-I. Ramos-Gonzalez, and J. L. Ramos. J. Bacteriol. 178:1699-1706, 1996). In the present study we cloned and mutagenized the orf1, tolQ, tolR, tolA, and tolB genes from P. putida KT2440, which were located upstream of the oprL gene. Polar and nonpolar mutations of the P. putida tolQ, tolR, tolA, and tolB genes were generated in vitro by using the omega-Km(r) interposon, which carries two transcriptional stop signals, or a promoterless xylE cassette, lacking any transcriptional stop signal, respectively. The mutant constructs were used to inactivate, by reverse genetics procedures, the corresponding chromosomal copies of the genes. The phenotype of each mutant strain was analyzed and compared with those of the wild-type strain and the previously characterized P. putida oprL::xylE mutant. All mutant strains exhibited a similar phenotype: altered cell morphology, bleb formation at the cell surface, release of periplasmic and outer membrane proteins to the extracellular medium, increased sensitivity to a variety of compounds (i.e., EDTA, sodium dodecyl sulfate, deoxycholate, and some antibiotics), filament formation, and severely reduced cell motility. Altogether, these results demonstrate the importance of the Tol-OprL system for the maintenance of outer membrane integrity in P. putida and suggest a possible role of these proteins in assembling outer membrane components.
TI  - In vivo and in vitro effects of (p)ppGpp on the sigma(54) promoter Pu of the TOL  plasmid of Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - The connection between the physiological control of the sigma(54)-dependent Pu promoter of the TOL plasmid pWW0 of Pseudomonas putida and the stringent response mediated by the alarmone (p)ppGpp has been examined in vivo an in vitro. To this end, the key regulatory elements of the system were faithfully reproduced in an Escherichia coli strain and assayed as lacZ fusions in various genetic backgrounds lacking (p)ppGpp or overexpressing relA. Neither the responsiveness of Pu to 3-methyl benzylalcohol mediated by its cognate activator XylR nor the down-regulation of the promoter by rapid growth were affected in relA/spoT strains to an extent which could account for the known physiological control that governs this promoter. Overexpression of the relA gene [predicted to increase intracellullar (p)ppGpp levels] did, however, cause a significant gain in Pu activity. Since such a gain might be the result of indirect effects, we resorted to an in vitro transcription system to assay directly the effect of ppGpp on the transcriptional machinery. Although we did observe a significant increase in Pu performance through a range of sigma(54)-RNAP concentrations, such an increase never exceeded twofold. The difference between these results and the behavior of the related Po promoter of the phenol degradation plasmid pVI150 could be traced to the different promoter sequences, which may dictate the type of metabolic signals recruited for the physiological control of sigma(54)-systems.
TI  - Microbial conversion of indene to indandiol: a key intermediate in the synthesis  of CRIXIVAN.
AB  - Indene is oxidized to mixtures of cis- and trans-indandiols and related metabolites by Pseudomonas putida and Rhodococcus sp. isolates. Indene metabolism is consistent with monooxygenase and dioxygenase activity. P. putida resolves enantiomeric mixtures of cis-1,2-indandiol by further selective oxidation of the 1R, 2S-enantiomer yielding high enantiomeric purity of cis-(1S, 2R)-indandiol, a potential intermediate in the synthesis of indinavir sulfate (CRIXIVAN), a protease inhibitor used in the treatment of AIDS. Molecular cloning of P. putida toluene dioxygenase in Escherichia coli confirmed the requirement for the dihydrodiol dehydrogenase in resolving racemic mixtures of cis-indandiol. Rhodococcus sp. isolates convert indene to cis-(1S, 2R)-indandiol at high initial enantiomeric excess and one isolate also produces trans-(1R, 2R)-indandiol, suggesting the presence of monooxygenase activity. Scale up and optimization of the bioconversions to these key synthons for chiral synthesis of potential intermediates for commercial manufacture of indinavir sulfate are described.
TI  - Pm promoter expression mutants and their use in broad-host-range RK2 plasmid vectors.
AB  - By coupling the Pm/xylS promoter system to minimal replicons of the broad-host-range plasmid RK2 we recently showed that such vectors are useful for both high- and low-level inducible expression of cloned genes in gram-negative bacteria. In this report, we extend this potential by identifying point mutations in or near the -10 transcriptional region of Pm. Point mutations leading to gene-independent enhancements of expression levels of the induced state or reduced background expression levels were identified using Escherichia coli as a host. By combining these mutations an additive effect in expression levels from the constructed Pm was observed. The highest induced expression level was obtained by inserting an E. coli consensus sigma70 - 10 recognition region. Most of the remaining activities in the reduced-background mutations appeared to originate from a transcriptional start site other than Pm. The effects of some of these mutations were also analyzed in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and were found to act similarly, but less pronounced in this host.
TI  - Parameters affecting gene expression from the Pm promoter in gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - The Pm promoter inserted chromosomally or in broad-host-range replicons based on  plasmid RSF1010 or RK2 are useful systems for both high- and low-level expression of cloned genes in several gram-negative bacterial species. The positive Pm regulator XylS is activated by certain substituted benzoic acid derivatives, and here we show that these effectors induce expression of Pm at similar relative ranking levels in both Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa However, the kinetics of expression was not the same in the two organisms. Different carbon sources and dissolved oxygen levels displayed limited effects on expression, but surprisingly the pH of the growth medium was found to be of major importance. By combining the effects of genetic and environmental parameters, expression from Pm could be varied over a ten-thousand- to a hundred-thousand-fold continuous range, and as an example of its applications we showed that Pm can be used to control the xanthan biosynthesis in Xanthomonas campestris.
TI  - Overexpression of salicylate hydroxylase and the crucial role of lys(163) as its  NADH binding site.
AB  - Expression systems for the sal gene encoding salicylate hydroxylase from Pseudomonas putida S-1 were examined and some constructs were expressed in these systems. By cultivation of Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3)/pSAH8 in LB medium at 37 degrees C with isopropyl-b-D-thiogalactopyranoside as the inducer, salicylate hydroxylase was overexpressed mainly in the form of inclusion bodies. Lower temperature cultivation at 20 degrees C after induction resulted in a large amount of the enzyme in the soluble form. The E. coli clone harboring the recombinant plasmid produced a 45 kDa protein that appeared to be electrophoretically and immunochemically identical to the P. putida enzyme and contained the same N-terminal amino acid sequence. This recombinant DNA product also exhibited properties characteristic of a flavoprotein and was fully functional as salicylate hydroxylase. Based on chemical modification of the salicylate hydroxylase from P. putida, Lys163 was previously proposed to be the NADH binding site. In this study, to obtain a better understanding of the predicted role of Lys163, this residue in the active center of salicylate hydroxylase was replaced with Arg, Gly, or Glu by conventional site-directed mutagenesis. Kinetic studies using these mutant enzymes and the recombinant enzyme revealed increases in apparent K(m) values for NADH in the order of wild-type enzyme > K163R > K163G > K163E, with some decreases in V(max). Examination of the recombinant enzyme and K163G indicated that the pH dependency of K(m) on NADH with pK(a) 10.5 is lost by mutation despite the lack of changes in V(max) values, suggesting a requirement for the lysine residue as the NADH binding site. Based on these results, Lys163 is proposed to play a role in the binding of NADH at the active site through an ionic bond rather than playing a role in catalysis.
TI  - Mutational analysis of the highly conserved C-terminal residues of the XylS protein, a member of the AraC family of transcriptional regulators.
AB  - The XylS protein of the TOL plasmid of Pseudomonas putida belongs to the so-called AraC/XylS family of regulators, that includes more than 100 different bacterial proteins. A conserved stretch of about 100 amino acids is present at the C-terminal end. This conserved region is believed to contain seven alpha-helices, including two helix-turn-helix (HTH) DNA binding motifs (alpha(2)-T-alpha(3) and alpha(5)-Talpha-(6)), connected by a linker alpha-helix (alpha(4)), and two flanking alpha-helices (alpha(1) and alpha(7)). The second HTH motif is the region with the highest homology in the proteins of the family, with certain residues showing almost 90% identity. We have constructed XylS single mutants in the most conserved residues and have analysed their ability to stimulate transcription from its cognate promoter, Pm, fused to 'lacZ. The analysis revealed that mutations in the alpha(5)-helix conserved residues had little effect on the XylS transcriptional activity, whereas the distribution of polarity in the alpha(6)-helix was important for the activity. The strongest effect of the mutations was observed in conserved residues located outside the DNA binding domain, namely, Gly-290 in the turn between the two helices, Pro-309 located downstream of alpha(6), and Leu-313, in the small last helix alpha(7), that seems to play an important role in the activation of RNA-polymerase. Our analysis shows that conservation of amino acids in the family reflects structural requirements rather than functionality in specific DNA interactions.
TI  - Characterization of a sulfur-regulated oxygenative alkylsulfatase from Pseudomonas putida S-313.
AB  - The atsK gene of Pseudomonas putida S-313 was required for growth with alkyl sulfate esters as sulfur source. The AtsK protein was overexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity. Sequence analysis revealed that AtsK was closely related to E. coli taurine dioxygenase (38% amino acid identity). The AtsK protein catalyzed the alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent cleavage of a range of alkyl sulfate esters, with chain lengths ranging from C(4) to C(12), required oxygen and Fe(2+) for activity and released succinate, sulfate, and the corresponding aldehyde as products. Enzyme activity was optimal at pH 7 and was strongly stimulated by ascorbate. Unlike most other characterized alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases, AtsK accepted a range of alpha-keto acids as co-substrates, including alpha-ketoglutarate (K(m) 140 microm), alpha-ketoadipate, alpha-ketovalerate, and alpha-ketooctanoate. The measured K(m) values for hexyl sulfate and SDS were 40 and 34 microm, respectively. The apparent M(r) of the purified enzyme of 121,000 was consistent with a homotetrameric structure, which is unusual for this enzyme superfamily, members of which are usually monomeric or dimeric. The properties and amino acid sequence of the AtsK enzyme thus define it as an unusual oxygenolytic alkylsulfatase and a novel member of the alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase family.
TI  - TrfA-dependent inner membrane-associated plasmid RK2 DNA synthesis and association of TrfA with membranes of different gram-negative hosts.
AB  - TrfA, the replication initiator protein of broad-host-range plasmid RK2, was tested for its ability to bind to the membrane of four different gram-negative hosts in addition to Escherichia coli: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas putida, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, and Rhodobacter sphaeroides. Cells harboring TrfA-encoding plasmids were fractionated into soluble, inner membrane, and outer membrane fractions. The fractions were subjected to Western blotting, and the blots were probed with antibody to the TrfA proteins. TrfA was found to fractionate with the cell membranes of all species tested. When the two membrane fractions of these species were tested for their ability to synthesize plasmid DNA endogenously (i.e., without added template or enzymes), only the inner membrane fraction was capable of extensive synthesis that was inhibited by anti-TrfA antibody in a manner similar to that of the original host species, E. coli. In addition, although DNA synthesis did occur in the outer membrane fraction, it was much less extensive than that exhibited by the inner membrane fraction and only slightly affected by anti-TrfA antibody. Plasmid DNA synthesized by the inner membrane fraction of one representative species, P. aeruginosa, was characteristic of supercoil and intermediate forms of the plasmid. Extensive DNA synthesis was observed in the soluble fraction of another representative species, R. sphaeroides, but it was completely unaffected by anti-TrfA antibody, suggesting that such synthesis was due to repair and/or nonspecific chain extension of plasmid DNA fragments.
TI  - Indigo production by naphthalene-degrading bacteria.
AB  - A wild-type naphthalene-degrading strain Pseudomonas putida RKJ1 and two recombinant strains each of Ps. putida and Escherichia coli carrying the genes for naphthalene degradation on a recombinant plasmid pRKJ3, produced indigo and indirubin pigments from indole. Naphthalene, salicylate and IPTG induced cells of naphthalene-degrading recombinant bacteria produced up to two times higher indigo compared with the uninduced cells. The maximum rates of indigo formation by Ps. putida RKJ1, Ps. putida RKJ5/pRKJ3, Ps. putida KT2442/pRKJ3, E. coli TB1/pRKJ3 and E. coli AB1157/pRKJ3 were 0.60, 0.80, 0.60, 1.20 and 1.50 nmol min-1 mg dry biomass-1, respectively, using indole as the substrate. The apparent Km values of indigo formation by these same bacteria were 0.22, 0.15, 0.10, 0. 21 and 0.20 mmol l-1, respectively, again using indole as the substrate. The present study revealed that E. coli AB1157 was the most efficient of the hosts tested for the expression of the plasmid encoded genes (pRKJ3) from the wild-type strain Ps. putida RKJ1. In addition, both recombinant E. coli strains were capable of producing indigo directly from nutrient medium.
TI  - Biosynthesis of pyridoxine: origin of the nitrogen atom of pyridoxine in microorganisms.
AB  - The amide nitrogen atom of glutamine was incorporated into pyridoxine in four eukaryotes, Emericella nidulans, Mucor racemosus, Neurospora crassa and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and two prokaryotes, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis, but not in the following prokaryotes, Pseudomonas putida, Enterobacter aerogenes and Escherichia coli. On the other hand, the nitrogen atom of glutamate was incorporated into pyridoxine in P. putida, E. aerogenes and E. coli, but not in S. aureus and B. subtilis. These results suggest that there are at least two different biosynthetic routes for pyridoxine and the difference does not depend on prokaryotes and eukaryotes.
TI  - Virulence of the phytopathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. maculicola is rpoN dependent.
AB  - We cloned the rpoN (ntrA and glnF) gene encoding sigma(54) from the phytopathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. maculicola strain ES4326. The P. syringae ES4326 rpoN gene complemented Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella aerogenes rpoN mutants for a variety of rpoN mutant phenotypes, including the inability to utilize nitrate as sole nitrogen source. DNA sequence analysis of the P. syringae ES4326 rpoN gene revealed that the deduced amino acid sequence was most similar (86% identity; 95% similarity) to the sigma(54) protein encoded by the Pseudomonas putida rpoN gene. A marker exchange protocol was used to construct an ES4326 rpoN insertional mutation, rpoN::Km(r). In contrast to wild-type ES4326, ES4326 rpoN::Km(r) was nonmotile and could not utilize nitrate, urea, C(4)-dicarboxylic acids, several amino acids, or concentrations of ammonia below 2 mM as nitrogen sources. rpoN was essential for production of the phytotoxin coronatine and for expression of the structural genes encoding coronamic acid. In addition, ES4326 rpoN::Km(r) did not multiply or elicit disease symptoms when infiltrated into Arabidopsis thaliana leaves, did not elicit the accumulation of several Arabidopsis defense-related mRNAs, and did not elicit a hypersensitive response (HR) when infiltrated into tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) leaves. Furthermore, whereas P. syringae ES4326 carrying the avirulence gene avrRpt2 elicited an HR when infiltrated into Arabidopsis ecotype Columbia leaves, ES4326 rpoN::Km(r) carrying avrRpt2 elicited no response. Constitutive expression of ES4326 hrpL in ES4326 rpoN::Km(r) partially restored defense-related mRNA accumulation, showing a direct role for the hrp cluster in host defense gene induction in a compatible host-pathogen interaction. However, constitutive expression of hrpL in ES4326 rpoN::Km(r) did not restore coronatine production, showing that coronatine biosynthesis requires factors other than hrpL.
TI  - Heterologous expression in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and purification of the 9.2-kDa c-type cytochrome subunit of p-cresol methylhydroxylase.
AB  - The 9.2-kDa c-type cytochrome subunit (PchC) of the flavocytochrome p-cresol methylhydroxylase from Pseudomonas putida NCIMB 9869 has been overexpressed in recombinant form in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1-LAC, using the recently developed pUCP-Nde vector. Efforts to produce the cytochrome in Escherichia coli using a pET vector, with or without its signal peptide, were generally unsuccessful, yielding relatively low levels of the protein. In contrast, the mature form of PchC accumulated in the periplasmic space of P. aeruginosa PAO1-LAC to about 1 mg/g wet cell paste. A periplasmic fraction enriched to about 12% (w/w) of total protein with recombinant PchC was isolated from the remainder of the cells by a washing procedure using ethylenediaminetetraacetate in the presence of sucrose. The cytochrome was purified to homogeneity from the periplasmic extract by anion-exchange chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B followed by chromatofocusing on PolyBuffer Exchanger 94. Purified PchC was obtained in a yield of about 50% and was shown to be identical to that resolved from the native flavocytochrome isolated from P. putida. This system may prove to be of general use for the production of recombinant c-type cytochromes.
TI  - Identification of sequences encoding the detoxification metalloisomerase glyoxalase I in microbial genomes from several pathogenic organisms.
AB  - The ubiquitous glyoxalase system, which is composed of two enzymes, removes cellular cytotoxic methylglyoxal (MG). In an effort to identify critical residues conserved in the evolution of the first enzyme in this system, glyoxalase I (GlxI), as well as the structural implications of sequence alterations in this enzyme, a search of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database of unfinished genomes was undertaken. Eleven putative GlxI sequences from pathogenic organisms were identified and analyses of these sequences in relation to the known and previously identified GlxI enzymes were performed. Several of these sequences show a very high similarity to the Escherichia coli GlxI sequence, most notably the 79% identity of the sequence identified from Yersinia pestis, the causative agent of bubonic plague. In addition to the conservation of residues critical to binding the catalytic metal in all of the proposed GlxI enzymes, four regions in the Homo sapiens GlxI enzyme are absent in all of the bacterial GlxI sequences, with the exception of Pseudomonas putida. Removal of these regions may alter the active-site conformation of the bacterial enzymes in relation to that of the H. sapiens. These differences may be targeted for the development of inhibitors selective to the bacterial enzymes.
TI  - The ssu locus plays a key role in organosulfur metabolism in Pseudomonas putida S-313.
AB  - Pseudomonas putida S-313 can utilize a broad range of aromatic sulfonates as sulfur sources for growth in sulfate-free minimal medium. The sulfonates are cleaved monooxygenolytically to yield the corresponding phenols. miniTn5 mutants of strain S-313 which were no longer able to desulfurize arylsulfonates were isolated and were found to carry transposon insertions in the ssuEADCBF operon, which contained genes for an ATP-binding cassette-type transporter (ssuABC), a two-component reduced flavin mononucleotide-dependent monooxygenase (ssuED) closely related to the Escherichia coli alkanesulfonatase, and a protein related to clostridial molybdopterin-binding proteins (ssuF). These mutants were also deficient in growth with a variety of other organosulfur sources, including aromatic and aliphatic sulfate esters, methionine, and aliphatic sulfonates other than the natural sulfonates taurine and cysteate. This pleiotropic phenotype was complemented by the ssu operon, confirming its key role in organosulfur metabolism in this species. Further complementation analysis revealed that the ssuF gene product was required for growth with all of the tested substrates except methionine and that the oxygenase encoded by ssuD was required for growth with sulfonates or methionine. The flavin reductase SsuE was not required for growth with aliphatic sulfonates or methionine but was needed for growth with arylsulfonates, suggesting that an alternative isozyme exists for the former compounds that is not active in transformation of the latter substrates. Aryl sulfate ester utilization was catalyzed by an arylsulfotransferase, and not by an arylsulfatase as in the related species Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - Characterization and expression of the pseudomonas putida bacterioferritin alpha  subunit gene.
AB  - The root-colonizing pseudomonad Pseudomonas putida (Pp) appears to produce two subunits, alpha and beta, of the iron-binding protein, bacterioferritin. A gene encoding the alpha-bacterioferritin subunit was located adjacent to the major catalase in Pp. The deduced protein sequence of the Pp bfralpha gene had a very high identity with other alpha-subunits, possessing conserved amino acids responsible for ferroxidase activity. The gene also lacked a deduced methionine at residue 52, associated with heme binding in beta-subunits. An antibody generated toward the Escherichia coli (E. coli) multifunctional single subunit bacterioferritin recognized two proteins in the Pp extract, a 22 kDa protein likely to be a beta-subunit and, to a lesser extent, a 23 kDa band. The 23 kDa band was absent in a Pp mutant in which the bfralpha gene was disrupted. Loss of alpha-bacterioferritin stimulated production of fluorescent siderophore. Growth on media and on root surfaces was not impaired by deletion of the alpha-bacterioferritin. Transcription of bfralpha was independent of the catalase gene and was dependent on iron. The transcript levels from bfralpha decreased in iron deficiency experienced during stationary-phase or upon treatment during growth with an iron chelator.
TI  - Cloning and characterization of the gene encoding RNA polymerase sigma factor sigma(54) of deep-sea piezophilic Shewanella violacea.
AB  - We have recently reported that a sigma(54)-like factor recognizes a DNA element,  designated as region A, upstream of a pressure-regulated operon in piezophilic Shewanella violacea strain DSS12 (Nakasone et al., FEMS Microbiology Lett. 176 (1999) 351-356). In this study, we isolated and characterized the rpoN gene of this piezophilic bacterium. The rpoN gene was found to encode a putative protein consisting of 492 amino acid residues with a predicted molecular mass of 55359 Da. Significant homology was evident comparing the rpoN sequence of S. violacea with that of Escherichia coli (62.8% identity), Vibrio anguillarum (61.7% identity) and Pseudomonas putida (57.0% identity). The DNA-binding domain at the C-terminus of sigma(54) is well conserved in the case of the S. violacea rpoN gene product and the helix-turn-helix motif and the RpoN box are also present. In addition, the conserved glutamine-rich domain is present at the N-terminus. sigma(54) in S. violacea was expressed at a relatively constant level under various growth conditions as determined by both primer extension and Western blotting analyses. By means of a recombinant plasmid, a hexahistidine-tagged derivative of the sigma(54) from strain DSS12 was overexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified to near homogeneity. An electrophoretic mobility shift assay demonstrated that the purified sigma(54) protein specifically recognizes region A in the above-mentioned pressure-regulated operon.
TI  - Development of a new lysis solution for releasing genomic DNA from bacterial cells for DNA amplification by polymerase chain reaction.
AB  - A new lysis solution designated TZ, consisting of 2.0% Triton X-100 plus 2.5 mg sodium azide/ml in 0.1 M Tris-HCl buffer at pH 8.0, yielded higher levels of genomic DNA from Escherichia coli O157:H7 cells compared with a number of other commonly used cell lysis methods. Ethidium bromide stained DNA bands resulting from PCR amplification of target DNA from 100 CFU of E. coli O157:H7 were readily detected following electrophoresis of agarose gels. In contrast, conventional cell lysis methods failed to detect target DNA from 100 CFU after PCR amplification. The new solution was highly effective for lysing cell suspensions of Salmonella enteritidis, Pseudomonas putida, Lysteria monocytogenes and Psychrobacter immobilis.
TI  - Interactions of DnaA proteins from distantly related bacteria with the replication origin of the broad host range plasmid RK2.
AB  - Replication initiation of the broad host range plasmid RK2 requires binding of the host-encoded DnaA protein to specific sequences (DnaA boxes) at its replication origin (oriV). In contrast to a chromosomal replication origin, which functionally interacts only with the native DnaA protein of the organism, the ability of RK2 to replicate in a wide range of Gram-negative bacterial hosts requires the interaction of oriV with many different DnaA proteins. In this study we compared the interactions of oriV with five different DnaA proteins. DNase I footprint, gel mobility shift, and surface plasmon resonance analyses showed that the DnaA proteins from Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas putida, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa bind to the DnaA boxes at oriV and are capable of inducing open complex formation, the first step in the replication initiation process. However, DnaA proteins from two Gram-positive bacteria, Bacillus subtilis and Streptomyces lividans, while capable of specifically interacting with the DnaA box sequences at oriV, do not bind stably and fail to induce open complex formation. These results suggest that the inability of the DnaA protein of a host bacterium to form a stable and functional complex with the DnaA boxes at oriV is a limiting step for plasmid host range.
TI  - Xylene monooxygenase catalyzes the multistep oxygenation of toluene and pseudocumene to corresponding alcohols, aldehydes, and acids in Escherichia coli JM101.
AB  - Xylene monooxygenase of Pseudomonas putida mt-2 catalyzes the methylgroup hydroxylation of toluene and xylenes. To investigate the potential of xylene monooxygenase to catalyze multistep oxidations of one methyl group, we tested recombinant Escherichia coli expressing the monooxygenase genes xylM and xylA under the control of the alk regulatory system of Pseudomonas oleovorans Gpo1. Expression of xylene monooxygenase genes could efficiently be controlled by n-octane and dicyclopropylketone. Xylene monooxygenase was found to catalyze the oxygenation of toluene, pseudocumene, the corresponding alcohols, and the corresponding aldehydes. For all three transformations (18)O incorporation provided stong evidence for a monooxygenation type of reaction, with gem-diols as the most likely reaction intermediates during the oxygenation of benzyl alcohols to benzaldehydes. To investigate the role of benzyl alcohol dehydrogenase (XylB) in the formation of benzaldehydes, xylB was cloned behind and expressed in concert with xylMA. In comparison to E. coli expressing only xylMA, the presence of xylB lowered product formation rates and resulted in back formation of benzyl alcohol from benzaldehyde. In P. putida mt-2 XylB may prevent the formation of high concentrations of the particularly reactive benzaldehydes. In the case of high fluxes through the degradation pathways and low aldehyde concentrations, XylB may contribute to benzaldehyde formation via the energetically favorable dehydrogenation of benzyl alcohols. The results presented here characterize XylMA as an enzyme able to catalyze the multistep oxygenation of toluenes.
TI  - An algorithm for automated bacterial identification using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry.
AB  - An algorithm for bacterial identification using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry is being developed. This mass spectral fingerprint comparison algorithm is fully automated and statistically based, providing objective analysis of samples to be identified. Based on extraction of reference fingerprint ions from test spectra, this approach should lend itself well to real-world applications where samples are likely to be impure. This algorithm is illustrated using a blind study. In the study, MALDI-MS fingerprints for Bacillus atrophaeus ATCC 49337, Bacillus cereus ATCC 14579T, Escherichia coli ATCC 33694, Pantoea agglomerans ATCC 33243, and Pseudomonas putida F1 are collected and form a reference library. The identification of test samples containing one or more reference bacteria, potentially mixed with one species not in the library (Shewanella alga BrY), is performed by comparison to the reference library with a calculated degree of association. Out of 60 samples, no false positives are present, and the correct identification rate is 75%. Missed identifications are largely due to a weak B. cereus signal in the bacterial mixtures. Potential modifications to the algorithm are presented and result in a higher than 90% correct identification rate for the blind study data, suggesting that this approach has the potential for reliable and accurate automated data analysis of MALDI-MS.
TI  - Detection of GroEL in activated sludge: a model for detection of system stress.
AB  - GroEL is a ubiquitous constitutively synthesized protein that is also stress inducible. Activated sludge, which is a standard biological process used in wastewater treatment systems, is made up of a diverse microbial consortium. The synthesis of GroEL in activated sludge was significantly induced after heat (42 degrees C) shock. The increased level of GroEL expression was shown to be due to de novo protein synthesis. We have demonstrated a method which shows that stress proteins can be detected in activated sludge, and propose their use as specific indicators of system stress.
TI  - Riding the sulfur cycle--metabolism of sulfonates and sulfate esters in gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Sulfonates and sulfate esters are widespread in nature, and make up over 95% of the sulfur content of most aerobic soils. Many microorganisms can use sulfonates and sulfate esters as a source of sulfur for growth, even when they are unable to metabolize the carbon skeleton of the compounds. In these organisms, expression of sulfatases and sulfonatases is repressed in the presence of sulfate, in a process mediated by the LysR-type regulator protein CysB, and the corresponding genes therefore constitute an extension of the cys regulon. Additional regulator proteins required for sulfonate desulfonation have been identified in Escherichia coli (the Cbl protein) and Pseudomonas putida (the AsfR protein). Desulfonation of aromatic and aliphatic sulfonates as sulfur sources by aerobic bacteria is oxygen-dependent, carried out by the alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent taurine dioxygenase, or by one of several FMNH(2)-dependent monooxygenases. Desulfurization of condensed thiophenes is also FMNH(2)-dependent, both in the rhodococci and in two Gram-negative species. Bacterial utilization of aromatic sulfate esters is catalyzed by arylsulfatases, most of which are related to human lysosomal sulfatases and contain an active-site formylglycine group that is generated post-translationally. Sulfate-regulated alkylsulfatases, by contrast, are less well characterized. Our increasing knowledge of the sulfur-regulated metabolism of organosulfur compounds suggests applications in practical fields such as biodesulfurization, bioremediation, and optimization of crop sulfur nutrition.
TI  - The Pseudomonas aeruginosa phaG gene product is involved in the synthesis of polyhydroxyalkanoic acid consisting of medium-chain-length constituents from non-related carbon sources.
AB  - We recently identified the phaG(Pp) gene encoding (R)-3-hydroxydecanoyl-ACP:CoA transacylase in Pseudomonas putida, which directly links the fatty acid de novo biosynthesis and polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) biosynthesis. An open reading frame (ORF) of which the deduced amino acid sequence shared about 57% identity with PhaG from P. putida was identified in the P. aeruginosa genome sequence. Its coding region (herein called phaG(Pa)) was amplified by PCR and cloned into the vector pBBR1MCS-2 under lac promoter control. The resulting plasmid pBHR88 mediated PHA synthesis contributing to about 13% of cellular dry weight from non-related carbon sources in the phaG(Pp)-negative mutant P. putida PhaG(N)-21. The PHA was composed of 5 mol% 3-hydroxydodecanoate, 61 mol% 3-hydroxydecanoate, 29 mol% 3-hydroxyoctanoate and 5 mol% 3-hydroxyhexanoate. Furthermore, an isogenic phaG(Pa) knock-out mutant of P. aeruginosa was constructed by gene replacement. The phaG(Pa) mutant did not show any difference in growth rate, but PHA accumulation from gluconate was decreased to about 40% of wild-type level, whereas from fatty acids wild-type level PHA accumulation was obtained. These data suggested that PhaG from P. aeruginosa exhibits 3-hydroxyacyl-ACP:CoA transacylase activity and strongly enhances the metabolic flux from fatty acid de novo synthesis towards PHA(MCL) synthesis. Therefore, a function could be assigned to the ORF present in the P. aeruginosa genome, and a second PhaG is now known.
TI  - Functional analysis of PvdS, an iron starvation sigma factor of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - In Pseudomonas aeruginosa, iron modulates gene expression through a cascade of negative and positive regulatory proteins. The master regulator Fur is involved in iron-dependent repression of several genes. One of these genes, pvdS, was predicted to encode a putative sigma factor responsible for the transcription of a subset of genes of the Fur regulon. PvdS appears to belong to a structurally and functionally distinct subgroup of the extracytoplasmic function family of alternative sigma factors. Members of this subgroup, also including PbrA from Pseudomonas fluorescens, PfrI and PupI from Pseudomonas putida, and FecI from Escherichia coli, are controlled by the Fur repressor, and they activate transcription of genes for the biosynthesis or the uptake of siderophores. Evidence is provided that the PvdS protein of P. aeruginosa is endowed with biochemical properties of eubacterial sigma factors, as it spontaneously forms 1:1 complexes with the core fraction of RNA polymerase (RNAP, alpha(2)betabeta' subunits), thereby promoting in vitro binding of the PvdS-RNAP holoenzyme to the promoter region of the pvdA gene. These functional features of PvdS are consistent with the presence of structural domains predicted to be involved in core RNAP binding, promoter recognition, and open complex formation. The activity of pyoverdin biosynthetic (pvd) promoters was significantly lower in E. coli overexpressing the multicopy pvdS gene than in wild-type P. aeruginosa PAO1 carrying the single gene copy, and pvd::lacZ transcriptional fusions were silent in both pfrI (the pvdS homologue) and pfrA (a positive regulator of pseudobactin biosynthetic genes) mutants of P. putida WCS358, while they are expressed at PAO1 levels in wild-type WCS358. Moreover, the PvdS-RNAP holoenzyme purified from E. coli lacked the ability to generate in vitro transcripts from the pvdA promoter. These observations suggest that at least one additional positive regulator could be required for full activity of the PvdS-dependent transcription complex both in vivo and in vitro. This is consistent with the presence of a putative activator binding site (the iron starvation box) at variable distance from the transcription initiation sites of promoters controlled by the iron starvation sigma factors PvdS, PfrI, and PbrA of fluorescent pseudomonads.
TI  - Evaluation of antibacterial activity of Asparagus racemosus willd. root.
AB  - Different concentrations (50, 100, 150 microg/mL) of the methanol extract of the  roots of Asparagus racemosus Willd. showed considerable in vitro antibacterial efficacy against Escherichia coli, Shigella dysenteriae, Shigella sonnei, Shigella flexneri, Vibrio cholerae, Salmonella typhi, Salmonella typhimurium, Pseudomonas putida, Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus. The effects produced by the methanol extract were compared with chloramphenicol.
TI  - Clay-bridged electron transfer between cytochrome p450(cam) and electrode.
AB  - We demonstrate a very fast heterogeneous redox reaction of substrate-free cytochrome P450(cam) on a glassy carbon electrode modified with sodium montmorillonite. The linear relationship of the peak current in the cyclic voltammogram with the scan rate indicates a reversible one-electron transfer surface process. The electron transfer rate is in the range from 5 to 152 s(-1) with scan rates from 0.4 to 12 V/s, respectively. These values are comparable to rates reported for the natural electron transfer from putidaredoxin to P450(cam). The formal potential of adsorbed P450(cam) is -139 mV (vs NHE) and therefore positively shifted by 164 mV compared to the potential of substrate-free P450(cam) in solution. UV-VIS and FTIR spectra do not indicate an influence of the clay colloidal particles on the heme and the secondary structure of P450(cam) in solution. However, P450(cam) adsorbed on the surface of the clay-modified electrode may undergo partial dehydration resulting in the shift of the formal potential.
TI  - Bacterial activity in the rhizosphere analyzed at the single-cell level by monitoring ribosome contents and synthesis rates.
AB  - The growth activity of Pseudomonas putida cells colonizing the rhizosphere of barley seedlings was estimated at the single-cell level by monitoring ribosomal contents and synthesis rates. Ribosomal synthesis was monitored by using a system comprising a fusion of the ribosomal Escherichia coli rrnBP1 promoter to a gene encoding an unstable variant of the green fluorescent protein (Gfp). Gfp expression in a P. putida strain carrying this system inserted into the chromosome was strongly dependent on the growth phase and growth rate of the strain, and cells growing exponentially at rates of > or = 0.17 h(-1) emitted growth rate-dependent green fluorescence detectable at the single-cell level. The single-cell ribosomal contents were very heterogeneous, as determined by quantitative hybridization with fluorescently labeled rRNA probes in P. putida cells extracted from the rhizosphere of 1-day-old barley seedlings grown under sterile conditions. After this, cells extracted from the root system had ribosomal contents similar to those found in starved cells. There was a significant decrease in the ribosomal content of P. putida cells when bacteria were introduced into nonsterile bulk or rhizosphere soil, and the Gfp monitoring system was not induced in cells extracted from either of the two soil systems. The monitoring system used permitted nondestructive in situ detection of fast-growing bacterial microcolonies on the sloughing root sheath cells of 1- and 2-day-old barley seedlings grown under sterile conditions, which demonstrated that it may be possible to use the unstable Gfp marker for studies of transient gene expression in plant-microbe systems.
TI  - Expression and stereochemical and isotope effect studies of active 4-oxalocrotonate decarboxylase.
AB  - 4-Oxalocrotonate decarboxylase (4-OD) and vinylpyruvate hydratase (VPH) from Pseudomonas putida mt-2 form a complex that converts 2-oxo-3-hexenedioate to 2-oxo-4-hydroxypentanoate in the catechol meta fission pathway. To facilitate mechanistic and structural studies of the complex, the two enzymes have been coexpressed and the complex has been purified to homogeneity. In addition, Glu-106, a potential catalytic residue in VPH, has been changed to glutamine, and the resulting E106QVPH mutant has been coexpressed with 4-OD and purified to homogeneity. The 4-OD/E106QVPH complex retains full decarboxylase activity, with comparable kinetic parameters to those observed for 4-OD in the wild-type complex, but is devoid of any detectable hydratase activity. Decarboxylation of (5S)-2-oxo-3-[5-D]hexenedioate by either the 4-OD/VPH complex or the mutant complex generates 2-hydroxy-2,4E-[5-D]pentadienoate in D(2)O. Ketonization of 2-hydroxy-2,4-pentadienoate by the wild-type complex is highly stereoselective and results in the formation of 2-oxo-(3S)-[3-D]-4-pentenoate, while the mutant complex generates a racemic mixture. These results indicate that 2-hydroxy-2, 4-pentadienoate is the product of 4-OD and that 2-oxo-4-pentenoate results from a VPH-catalyzed process. On this basis, the previously proposed hypothesis for the conversion of 2-oxo-3-hexenedioate to 2-oxo-4-hydroxypentanoate has been revised [Lian, H., and Whitman, C. P. (1994) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 116, 10403-10411]. Finally, the observed (13)C kinetic isotope effect on the decarboxylation of 2-oxo-3-hexenedioate by the 4-OD/VPH complex suggests that the decarboxylation step is nearly rate-limiting. Because the value is not sensitive to either magnesium or manganese, it is likely that the transition state for carbon-carbon bond cleavage is late and that the metal positions the substrate and polarizes the carbonyl group, analogous to its role in oxalacetate decarboxylase.
TI  - Functional domains of the TOL plasmid transcription factor XylS.
AB  - The alkylbenzoate degradation genes of Pseudomonas putida TOL plasmid are positively regulated by XylS, an AraC family protein, in a benzoate-dependent manner. In this study, we used deletion mutants and hybrid proteins to identify which parts of XylS are responsible for the DNA binding, transcriptional activation, and benzoate inducibility. We found that a 112-residue C-terminal fragment of XylS binds specifically to the Pm operator in vitro, protects this sequence from DNase I digestion identically to the wild-type (wt) protein, and activates the Pm promoter in vivo. When overexpressed, that C-terminal fragment could activate transcription as efficiently as wt XylS. All the truncations, which incorporated these 112 C-terminal residues, were able to activate transcription at least to some extent when overproduced. Intactness of the 210-residue N-terminal portion was found to be necessary for benzoate responsiveness of XylS. Deletions in the N-terminal and central regions seriously reduced the activity of XylS and caused the loss of effector control, whereas insertions into the putative interdomain region did not change the basic features of the XylS protein. Our results confirm that XylS consists of two parts which probably interact with each other. The C-terminal domain carries DNA-binding and transcriptional activation abilities, while the N-terminal region carries effector-binding and regulatory functions.
TI  - Identification and characterization of the nitrobenzene catabolic plasmids pNB1 and pNB2 in Pseudomonas putida HS12.
AB  - Pseudomonas putida HS12, which is able to grow on nitrobenzene, was found to carry two plasmids, pNB1 and pNB2. The activity assay experiments of wild-type HS12(pNB1 and pNB2), a spontaneous mutant HS121(pNB2), and a cured derivative HS124(pNB1) demonstrated that the catabolic genes coding for the nitrobenzene-degrading enzymes, designated nbz, are located on two plasmids, pNB1 and pNB2. The genes nbzA, nbzC, nbzD, and nbzE, encoding nitrobenzene nitroreductase, 2-aminophenol 1,6-dioxygenase, 2-aminomuconic 6-semialdehyde dehydrogenase, and 2-aminomuconate deaminase, respectively, are located on pNB1 (59.1 kb). Meanwhile, the nbzB gene encoding hydroxylaminobenzene mutase, a second-step enzyme in the nitrobenzene catabolic pathway, was found in pNB2 (43.8 kb). Physical mapping, cloning, and functional analysis of the two plasmids and their subclones in Escherichia coli strains revealed in more detail the genetic organization of the catabolic plasmids pNB1 and pNB2. The genes nbzA and nbzB are located on the 1.1-kb SmaI-SnaBI fragment of pNB1 and the 1.0-kb SspI-SphI fragment of pNB2, respectively, and their expressions were not tightly regulated. On the other hand, the genes nbzC, nbzD, and nbzE, involved in the ring cleavage pathway of 2-aminophenol, are localized on the 6.6-kb SnaBI-SmaI fragment of pNB1 and clustered in the order nbzC-nbzD-nbzE as an operon. The nbzCDE genes, which are transcribed in the opposite direction of the nbzA gene, are coordinately regulated by both nitrobenzene and a positive transcriptional regulator that seems to be encoded on pNB2.
TI  - Separating microbes in the manner of molecules. 1. Capillary electrokinetic approaches.
AB  - Selective, high-efficiency separations of intact bacteria may, in some cases, allow them to be identified and quantified in much the same way that molecules are done today. Two different capillary electrokinetic approaches were utilized. The first approach used a dissolved polymer-based CE separation that may be affected by size and shape considerations. Another approach uses capillary isoelectric focusing to separate bacteria by their surface charge or isoelectric point. Good peak shapes and extremely high efficiencies are observed (up to approximately 1,600,000 theoretical plates/m). Careful sample preparation and separation runs are essential in order to obtain reproducible separations. Expansion of these types of rapid, efficient microbial separations could have profound effects on many branches of science and technology.
TI  - Cloning and characterization of a novel cis-naphthalene dihydrodiol dehydrogenase gene (narB) from Rhodococcus sp. NCIMB12038.
AB  - Rhodococcus sp. NCIMB112038 can utilize naphthalene as its sole carbon and energy source. The gene encoding cis-naphthalene dihydrodiol dehydrogenase (narB) of this strain has been cloned and sequenced. Expression of NCIMB12038 cis-naphthalene dihydrodiol dehydrogenase was demonstrated in Escherichia coli cells. narB encodes a putative protein of 271 amino acids and shares 39% amino acid identity with the cis-naphthalene dihydrodiol dehydrogenase from Pseudomonas putida G7. Comparison of NarB with some putative cis-dihydrodiol dehydrogenases from Rhodococcus species revealed significant differences between these proteins. NarB together with two other proteins forms a new group of cis-dihydrodiol dehydrogenases.
TI  - Convenient test for screening metallo-beta-lactamase-producing gram-negative bacteria by using thiol compounds.
AB  - A simple disk diffusion test was constructed for detection of IMP-1-type metallo-beta-lactamase-producing gram-negative bacteria. Two Kirby-Bauer disks containing ceftazidime (CAZ) and a filter disk containing a metallo-beta-lactamase inhibitor were used in this test. Several IMP-1 inhibitors such as thiol compounds including 2-mercaptopropionic acid, heavy metal salts, and EDTA were evaluated for this test. Two CAZ disks were placed on a Mueller-Hinton agar plate on which a bacterial suspension was spread according to the method recommended by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards. The distance between the disks was kept to about 4 to 5 cm, and a filter disk containing a metallo-beta-lactamase inhibitor was placed near one of the CAZ disks within a center-to-center distance of 1.0 to 2.5 cm. For IMP-1-producing strains, the growth-inhibitory zone between the two disks expanded, while no evident change in the shape of the growth-inhibitory zone was observed for CAZ-resistant strains producing serine beta-lactamases such as AmpC or SHV-12. As a result, 2 to 3 microliter of undiluted 2-mercaptopropionic acid or mercaptoacetic acid able to block IMP-1 activity gave the most reproducible and clearest results, and CAZ-resistant strains producing AmpC or extended-spectrum beta-lactamases were distinguishable from IMP-1 producers by this test. A similar observation was made with IMP-1-producing clinical isolates such as Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Citrobacter freundii, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas putida, Acinetobacter spp., and Alcaligenes xylosoxidans. The specificity and sensitivity of this test were comparable to those of PCR analysis using bla(IMP)-specific primers. Therefore, this convenient test would be valuable for daily use in clinical laboratories.
TI  - Proline catabolism by Pseudomonas putida: cloning, characterization, and expression of the put genes in the presence of root exudates.
AB  - Pseudomonas putida KT2442 is a root-colonizing strain which can use proline, one  of the major components in root exudates, as its sole carbon and nitrogen source. A P. putida mutant unable to grow with proline as the sole carbon and nitrogen source was isolated after random mini-Tn5-Km mutagenesis. The mini-Tn5 insertion was located at the putA gene, which is adjacent to and divergent from the putP gene. The putA gene codes for a protein of 1,315 amino acid residues which is homologous to the PutA protein of Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Rhodobacter capsulatus, and several Rhizobium strains. The central part of P. putida PutA showed homology to the proline dehydrogenase of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Drosophila melanogaster, whereas the C-terminal end was homologous to the pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenase of S. cerevisiae and a number of aldehyde dehydrogenases. This suggests that in P. putida, both enzymatic steps for proline conversion to glutamic acid are catalyzed by a single polypeptide. The putP gene was homologous to the putP genes of several prokaryotic microorganisms, and its gene product is an integral inner-membrane protein involved in the uptake of proline. The expression of both genes was induced by proline added in the culture medium and was regulated by PutA. In a P. putida putA-deficient background, expression of both putA and putP genes was maximal and proline independent. Corn root exudates collected during 7 days also strongly induced the P. putida put genes, as determined by using fusions of the put promoters to 'lacZ. The induction ratio for the putA promoter (about 20-fold) was 6-fold higher than the induction ratio for the putP promoter.
TI  - An aerotaxis transducer gene from Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - An aerotaxis gene, aer, was cloned from Pseudomonas putida PRS2000. A P. putida aer mutant displayed an altered aerotactic response in a capillary assay. Wild-type P. putida clustered at the air/liquid interface. In contrast, the aer mutant did not cluster at the interface, but instead formed a diffuse band at a distance from the meniscus. Wild-type aer, provided in trans, complemented the aer mutant to an aerotactic response that was stronger than wild-type. The P. putida Aer sequence is similar over its entire length to the aerotaxis (energy taxis) signal transducer protein, Aer, of Escherichia coli. The amino-terminus is similar to redox-sensing regulatory proteins, and the carboxy-terminus contains the highly conserved domain present in chemotactic transducers.
TI  - Properties of p-cresol methylhydroxylase flavoprotein overproduced by Escherichia coli.
AB  - The alpha(2)beta(2) flavocytochrome p-cresol methylhydroxylase (PCMH) from Pseudomonas putida is composed of a flavoprotein homodimer (alpha(2) or PchF(2); M(r) = 119 kDa) with a cytochrome monomer (beta, PchC; M(r) = 9.3 kDa) bound to each PchF subunit. Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) has been transformed with a vector for expression of the pchF gene, and PchF is overproduced by this strain as the homodimer. During purification, it was recognized that some PchF had FAD bound, while the remainder was FAD-free. However, unlike PchF obtained from PCMH purified from P. putida, FAD was bound noncovalently. The FAD was conveniently removed from purified E. coli-expressed PchF by hydroxyapatite chromatography. Fluorescence quenching titration indicated that the affinity of apo-PchF for FAD was sufficiently high to prevent the determination of the dissociation constant. It was found that p-cresol was virtually incapable of reducing PchF with noncovalently bound FAD (PchF(NC)), whereas 4-hydroxybenzyl alcohol, the intermediate product of p-cresol oxidation by PCMH, reduced PchF(NC) fairly quickly. In contrast, p-cresol rapidly reduced PchF with covalently bound FAD (PchF(C)), but, unlike intact PCMH, which consumed 4 electron equiv/mol when titrated with p-cresol (2 electrons from p-cresol and 2 from 4-hydroxybenzyl alcohol), PchF(C) accepted only 2 electron equiv/mol. This is explained by extremely slow release of 4-hydroxybenzyl alcohol from reduced PchF(C). 4-Hydroxybenzyl alcohol rapidly reduced PchF(C), producing 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde. It was demonstrated that p-cresol has a charge-transfer interaction with FAD when bound to oxidized PchF(NC), whereas 4-bromophenol (a substrate analogue) and 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde have charge-transfer interactions with FAD when bound to either PchF(C) or PchF(NC). This is the first example of a "wild-type" flavoprotein, which normally has covalently bound flavin, to bind flavin noncovalently in a stable, redox-active manner.
TI  - Expression of marker RNAs in Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - A broad-host-range vector that expresses a unique artificial RNA in Pseudomonas putida has been developed. This vector was derived from the plasmid pBBR1MCS and incorporates regulatory regions from the Escherichia coli ribosomal operon, rrnB. These include the promoters P1 and P2, and the terminators T1 and T2. The gene for the artificial RNA was derived from Vibrio proteolyticus 5S rRNA. The artificial RNA product accumulates to a level that is 10-20% of the total 5S rRNA in P. putida. The RNA product is not incorporated into ribosomes and has a minimal effect on cell growth rate. In contrast, when wild-type V. proteolyticus 5S rRNA was expressed from the vector, it was incorporated into ribosomes. It is expected that this new vector system will allow artificial RNA expression systems to be readily developed for a large variety of species.
TI  - Identification and molecular characterization of the eugenol hydroxylase genes (ehyA/ehyB) of Pseudomonas sp. strain HR199.
AB  - The gene loci ehyA and ehyB, which are involved in the bioconversion of eugenol to coniferyl alcohol by Pseudomonas sp. strain HR199 (DSM 7063), were identified as the structural genes of a eugenol hydroxylase that represents an enzyme of the flavocytochrome c class. These genes were localized downstream of the eugenol catabolism genes vanA and vanB, encoding vanillate-O-demethylase, on an EcoRI fragment (E230) that has recently been cloned from a Pseudomonas sp. strain HR199 genomic library. The gene encoding the cytochrome c subunit (ehyA) was identified on a subfragment (K18) of E230 by complementation of a nitrosoguanidine-induced, eugenol-negative mutant of strain HR199. The nucleotide sequences of fragment K18 and adjacent regions were determined, revealing open reading frames of 354 and 1,554 bp that represent ehyA and ehyB, respectively. These genes are most probably organized in one operon together with a third open reading frame (ORF2) of 687 bp that was located between ehyA and ehyB. The deduced amino acid sequences of ehyA and ehyB exhibited up to 29 and 55% amino acid identity to the corresponding subunits of p-cresol methylhydroxylase from Pseudomonas putida. Moreover, the amino-terminal sequences of the alpha- and beta-subunits reported recently for a eugenol dehydrogenase of Pseudomonas fluorescens E118 corresponded well with appropriate regions of ehyA and ehyB. The sequence of ORF2 and the deduced amino acid sequence exhibited no significant similarities to any DNA or amino acid sequence from the databases. The eugenol hydroxylase genes were amplified by PCR, cloned in pBluescript SK(-), and functionally expressed in Escherichia coli. Transfer of a DNA fragment comprising ehyA and ehyB to various strains of Pseudomonas species that were unable to utilize eugenol as a carbon source conferred to these bacteria the ability to grow on this substrate.
TI  - Engineering of a stable whole-cell biocatalyst capable of (S)-styrene oxide formation for continuous two-liquid-phase applications.
AB  - Recombinant strains of Pseudomonas putida KT2440 carrying genetic expression cassettes with xylene oxygenase- and styrene monooxygenase-encoding genes on their chromosomes could be induced in shaking-flask experiments to specific activities that rivaled those of multicopy-plasmid-based Escherichia coli recombinants. Such strains maintained the introduced styrene oxidation activity in continuous two-liquid-phase cultures for at least 100 generations, although at a lower level than in the shaking-flask experiments. The data suggest that placement of target genes on the chromosome might be a suitable route for the construction of segregationally stable and highly active whole-cell biocatalysts.
TI  - Transcriptional regulation by iron of genes encoding iron- and manganese-superoxide dismutases from Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - Genes from Pseudomonas putida (Pp), sodA, encoding manganese-superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) and, sodB, iron-superoxide dismutase (FeSOD) were cloned by hybridization with digoxigenin (dig)-labeled PCR products generated from Pp genomic DNA. The sodB gene had a 594 bp open reading frame (ORF), corresponding to 198 amino acids (aa), and a transcript of 880 bases. The sodA gene contained a 609 bp ORF encoding 203 aa and was transcribed as part of a polycistronic operon, consisting of orfY-fumC-orfX-sodA. Pp sodA or sodB genes both restored aerobic growth, growth on paraquat, and growth on minimal medium to an Escherichia coli (Ec) mutant deficient in SOD activity. Paraquat treatment did not enhance mRNA transcription of the sod genes or increase SOD activity in Pp. The Pp sodB gene was highly expressed throughout logarithmic-(log) growth phase and stationary-phase cells grown in medium supplemented with FeCl3, but was down-regulated in iron-deficient conditions, such as in stationary-phase or generated by 2,2'-dipyridyl (DP) treatment. This is the first evidence that iron regulates expression of the sodB gene at the transcriptional level. In contrast, iron-deficient conditions, or addition of MnCl2 to the growth medium, induced transcripts (2.4 kb and 1.2 kb) from the sodA operon. Our results reveal an intricate role of iron in the transcriptional regulation of both Pp sodA and sodB genes.
TI  - A novel lipolytic enzyme located in the outer membrane of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - A lipase-negative deletion mutant of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 still showed extracellular lipolytic activity toward short-chain p-nitrophenylesters. By screening a genomic DNA library of P. aeruginosa PAO1, an esterase gene, estA, was identified, cloned, and sequenced, revealing an open reading frame of 1,941 bp. The product of estA is a 69.5-kDa protein, which is probably processed by removal of an N-terminal signal peptide to yield a 67-kDa mature protein. A molecular mass of 66 kDa was determined for (35)S-labeled EstA by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. The amino acid sequence of EstA indicated that the esterase is a member of a novel GDSL family of lipolytic enzymes. The estA gene showed high similarity to an open reading frame of unknown function located in the trpE-trpG region of P. putida and to a gene encoding an outer membrane esterase of Salmonella typhimurium. Amino acid sequence alignments led us to predict that this esterase is an autotransporter protein which possesses a carboxy-terminal beta-barrel domain, allowing the secretion of the amino-terminal passenger domain harboring the catalytic activity. Expression of estA in P. aeruginosa and Escherichia coli and subsequent cell fractionation revealed that the enzyme was associated with the cellular membranes. Trypsin treatment of whole cells released a significant amount of esterase, indicating that the enzyme was located in the outer membrane with the catalytic domain exposed to the surface. To our knowledge, this esterase is unique in that it exemplifies in P. aeruginosa (i) the first enzyme identified in the outer membrane and (ii) the first example of a type IV secretion mechanism.
TI  - An electrochemical study of the factors responsible for modulating the reduction  potential of putidaredoxin.
AB  - The gene coding for putidaredoxin has been synthesized using a combination of chemical and enzymatic methods and subsequently expressed in Escherichia coli. The recombinant protein characterized by electronic spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and electrochemistry was found to be identical to putidaredoxin obtained from Pseudomonas putida. Polylysine was found to promote the fast and reversible electrochemistry of putidaredoxin at negatively charged electrodes such as indium-doped tin oxide or gold surfaces modified with mercaptoalkanoate groups. The value of the heterogeneous electron transfer rate constant obtained from solutions containing a mixture of putidaredoxin and polylysine (k(s) = 1.3 x 10(-3) cm/s) is one order of magnitude larger than the values reported previously at gold electrodes modified with mercaptoethylamine or at antimony-doped tin oxide semiconductor electrodes. It was observed that when the reduction potential of putidaredoxin is measured by cyclic voltammetry, the resultant value is consistently more positive (64 mV) than the reduction potential measured with potentiometric titrations. A comparison between the electrochemical responses of putidaredoxin and spinach ferredoxin, combined with the examination of their corresponding three-dimensional structures, indicates that the positive shift in the reduction potential of putidaredoxin originates from the formation of a transient complex between putidaredoxin and polylysine at the electrode surface. The formation of this transient complex modulates the reduction potential of putidaredoxin by lowering the value of the dielectric constant around its iron-sulfur cluster microenvironment, specifically by neutralizing negative charges surrounding the active site and by excluding water from the solvent exposed iron sulfur cluster. The observed positive shift in E degrees ', which is induced by complexation with polylysine at the electrode-surface, suggests that similar factors are likely to contribute to the anodic shift in the E degrees ' of cytochrome P450(cam)-bound putidaredoxin (+44 mV) with respect to the E degrees ' measured for free putidaredoxin.
TI  - Importance of illegitimate recombination and transposition in IS30-associated excision events.
AB  - In the present study we report on the excision of IS30 elements and IS30-derived  composite transposons. Frequent loss of IS30 was observed during dissolution of dimeric IS30 structures, containing IR-IR junctions, leading to resealed donor molecules. In contrast, unambiguous transpositional excision resulting in resealed remainder products could not be identified in the case of a monomeric element. The bias in the excision of monomeric and dimeric IS30 structures indicates a difference in the molecular mechanism of transposition of IS30 monomers and dimers. Sequence data on the rarely detected plasmids missing full IS or Tn copies rather suggest that all products were derived from illegitimate recombination. The reaction occurred between short homologies and was independent of the transposase activity. Similar IS30 excision events accompanied by multiple plasmid or genome rearrangements were detected in Pseudomonas putida and Rhizobium meliloti, yielding stable replicons that retained the selective marker gene of the transposon. We provide evidence that both transposition and illegitimate recombination can contribute to the stabilization of replicons through the elimination of IS elements, which emphasizes the evolutionary significance of these events.
TI  - Initiating a structural study of 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate aldolase from  Escherichia coli.
AB  - 2-Keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate aldolase (KDPG aldolase, E.C. 4.1. 2.14) is a member of the pyruvate/phosphoenolpyruvate aldolase family. It is also a synthetically useful enzyme, capable of catalyzing the stereoselective aldol addition of pyruvate to a range of unnatural electrophilic substrates. The recombinant protein was purified by a two-step HPLC protocol involving anion-exchange and hydrophobic chromatography. Dynamic light-scattering experiments indicated the protein to be monodisperse. Crystals were obtained using the sitting-drop vapour-diffusion method, with PEG 6K as precipitant. Diffraction data were collected on a frozen crystal to a resolution of 2.26 A on station PX9.6 at the Daresbury synchrotron. The crystal belongs to space group P2(1)2(1)2(1), with unit-cell parameters a = 53.2, b = 77.9, c = 146.8 A.
TI  - Mutations of glutamate-84 at the putative potassium-binding site affect camphor binding and oxidation by cytochrome p450cam.
AB  - Cytochrome P450cam (CYP101) from Pseudomonas putida is unusual among P450 enzymes in that it exhibits co-operative binding between the substrate camphor and a potassium ion. This behaviour has been investigated by mutagenesis of Glu84, a surface residue which forms part of the cation-binding site. Substitutions that neutralize or reverse the charge of this side chain are shown to disrupt the co-operativity of potassium and camphor binding by P450cam, and also to influence the catalytic activity. In particular, replacement of Glu84 by positively charged residues such as lysine results in increased high-spin haem fractions and camphor turnover activities in the absence of potassium, along with decreased camphor dissociation constants. However, in the presence of potassium the camphor dissociation constants of these mutants are significantly increased compared with the wild-type, although the camphor turnover activities remain marginally higher. In contrast, substitution by aspartate results in tighter binding of both potassium and camphor, but has little effect on the enzymatic activity. In all cases the reaction remains essentially 100% coupled and gives 5-exo-hydroxycamphor as the only product. These results suggest that an anionic side chain at the 84 position is crucial for the co-operativity of camphor and cation binding, and that the physiological role for potassium binding by cytochrome P450cam is to promote camphor binding even at the expense of turnover rate, thus allowing the organism to utilize low environmental concentrations of this substrate for growth.
TI  - Cloning and sequence analysis of two Pseudomonas flavoprotein xenobiotic reductases.
AB  - The genes encoding flavin mononucleotide-containing oxidoreductases, designated xenobiotic reductases, from Pseudomonas putida II-B and P. fluorescens I-C that removed nitrite from nitroglycerin (NG) by cleavage of the nitroester bond were cloned, sequenced, and characterized. The P. putida gene, xenA, encodes a 39,702-Da monomeric, NAD(P)H-dependent flavoprotein that removes either the terminal or central nitro groups from NG and that reduces 2-cyclohexen-1-one but did not readily reduce 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT). The P. fluorescens gene, xenB, encodes a 37,441-Da monomeric, NAD(P)H-dependent flavoprotein that exhibits fivefold regioselectivity for removal of the central nitro group from NG and that transforms TNT but did not readily react with 2-cyclohexen-1-one. Heterologous expression of xenA and xenB was demonstrated in Escherichia coli DH5alpha. The transcription initiation sites of both xenA and xenB were identified by primer extension analysis. BLAST analyses conducted with the P. putida xenA and the P. fluorescens xenB sequences demonstrated that these genes are similar to several other bacterial genes that encode broad-specificity flavoprotein reductases. The prokaryotic flavoprotein reductases described herein likely shared a common ancestor with old yellow enzyme of yeast, a broad-specificity enzyme which may serve a detoxification role in antioxidant defense systems.
TI  - A high-throughput digital imaging screen for the discovery and directed evolution of oxygenases.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Oxygenases catalyze the hydroxylation of a wide variety of organic substrates. An ability to alter oxygenase substrate specificities and improve their activities and stabilities using recombinant DNA techniques would expand their use in processes such as chemical synthesis and bioremediation. Discovery and directed evolution of oxygenases require efficient screens that are sensitive to the activities of interest and can be applied to large numbers of crude enzyme samples. RESULTS: Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) couples the phenolic products of hydroxylation of aromatic substrates to generate colored and/or fluorescent compounds that are easily detected spectroscopically in high-throughput screening. Coexpression of the coupling enzyme with a functional mono- or dioxygenase creates a pathway for the conversion of aromatic substrates into fluorescent compounds in vivo. We used this approach for detecting the products of the toluene-dioxygenase-catalyzed hydroxylation of chlorobenzene and to screen large mutant libraries of Pseudomonas putida cytochrome P450cam by fluorescence digital imaging. Colors generated by the HRP coupling reaction are sensitive to the site of oxygenase-catalyzed hydroxylation, allowing the screen to be used to identify catalysts with new or altered regiospecificities. CONCLUSIONS: The coupled oxygenase-peroxidase reaction system is well suited for screening oxygenase libraries to identify mutants with desired features, including higher activity or stability and altered reaction specificity. This approach should also be useful for screening expressed DNA libraries and combinatorial chemical libraries for hydroxylation catalysts and for optimizing oxygenase reaction conditions.
TI  - Novel biodegradable aromatic plastics from a bacterial source. Genetic and biochemical studies on a route of the phenylacetyl-coa catabolon.
AB  - Novel biodegradable bacterial plastics, made up of units of 3-hydroxy-n-phenylalkanoic acids, are accumulated intracellularly by Pseudomonas putida U due to the existence in this bacterium of (i) an acyl-CoA synthetase (encoded by the fadD gene) that activates the aryl-precursors; (ii) a beta-oxidation pathway that affords 3-OH-aryl-CoAs, and (iii) a polymerization-depolymerization system (encoded in the pha locus) integrated by two polymerases (PhaC1 and PhaC2) and a depolymerase (PhaZ). The complete assimilation of these compounds requires two additional routes that specifically catabolize the phenylacetyl-CoA or the benzoyl-CoA generated from these polyesters through beta-oxidation. Genetic studies have allowed the cloning, sequencing, and disruption of the genes included in the pha locus (phaC1, phaC2, and phaZ) as well as those related to the biosynthesis of precursors (fadD) or to the catabolism of their derivatives (acuA, fadA, and paa genes). Additional experiments showed that the blockade of either fadD or phaC1 hindered the synthesis and accumulation of plastic polymers. Disruption of phaC2 reduced the quantity of stored polymers by two-thirds. The blockade of phaZ hampered the mobilization of the polymer and decreased its production. Mutations in the paa genes, encoding the phenylacetic acid catabolic enzymes, did not affect the synthesis or catabolism of polymers containing either 3-hydroxyaliphatic acids or 3-hydroxy-n-phenylalkanoic acids with an odd number of carbon atoms as monomers, whereas the production of polyesters containing units of 3-hydroxy-n-phenylalkanoic acids with an even number of carbon atoms was greatly reduced in these bacteria. Yield-improving studies revealed that mutants defective in the glyoxylic acid cycle (isocitrate lyase(-)) or in the beta-oxidation pathway (fadA), stored a higher amount of plastic polymers (1.4- and 2-fold, respectively), suggesting that genetic manipulation of these pathways could be useful for isolating overproducer strains. The analysis of the organization and function of the pha locus and its relationship with the core of the phenylacetyl-CoA catabolon is reported and discussed.
TI  - A highly active, soluble mutant of the membrane-associated (S)-mandelate dehydrogenase from Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - (S)-Mandelate dehydrogenase (MDH) from Pseudomonas putida, a member of the flavin mononucleotide-dependent alpha-hydroxy acid oxidase/dehydrogenase family, is a membrane-associated protein, in contrast to the more well-characterized members of this protein family including glycolate oxidase (GOX) from spinach. In a previous study [Mitra, B., et al. (1993) Biochemistry 32, 12959-12967], the membrane association of MDH was correlated to a 53 amino acid segment in the interior of the primary sequence by construction of a chimeric enzyme, MDH-GOX1, in which the membrane-binding segment in MDH was deleted and replaced with the corresponding 34 amino acid segment from the soluble GOX. Though MDH-GOX1 was soluble, it was an inefficient, nonspecific enzyme that involved a different transition state for the catalyzed reaction from that of the wild-type MDH. In the present study, it is shown that the membrane-binding segment in MDH is somewhat shorter, approximately 39 residues long. Partial or total deletion of this segment disrupts membrane localization of MDH. This segment is not important for substrate oxidation activity. A new chimera, MDH-GOX2, was created by replacing this shorter membrane-binding segment from MDH with the corresponding 20 amino acid segment from GOX. The soluble MDH-GOX2 is very similar to the wild-type membrane-bound enzyme in its spectroscopic properties, substrate specificity, catalytic activity, kinetic mechanism, and lack of reactivity toward oxygen. Therefore, it should prove to be a highly useful model for structural studies of MDH.
TI  - Cloning and sequencing of rpoH and identification of ftsE-ftsX in Pseudomonas putida PpG1.
AB  - The rpoH gene encoding the heat-shock sigma factor of Pseudomonas putida was cloned by using its ability to complement the temperature-sensitive growth of the Escherichia coli rpoH mutant. The cloned DNA contained an open reading frame for a 284 amino acid sequence exhibiting high homology to the sigmaH proteins of P. aeruginosa and E. coli. Moreover, homologs to the cell division genes ftsX and ftsE were found immediately upstream of the rpoH gene.
TI  - Controlled specific expression and purification of 6 x His-tagged proteins in Pseudomonas.
AB  - The 6 x His affinity tags have proved invaluable for the exclusive purification of proteins, in Escherichia coli, of genes cloned in frame with a 6 x His tag and a strong inducible promoter. Here, we demonstrate that the system can be extended to Gram-negative bacteria other than E. coli, by the use of compatible broad-host-range plasmids. As an example, the inducible synthesis and specific purification of the Pseudomonas 6 x His-PfrA siderophore regulatory protein in Pseudomonas putida WCS358 is demonstrated.
TI  - Distribution of bacterial growth activity in flow-chamber biofilms.
AB  - In microbial communities such as those found in biofilms, individual organisms most often display heterogeneous behavior with respect to their metabolic activity, growth status, gene expression pattern, etc. In that context, a novel reporter system for monitoring of cellular growth activity has been designed. It comprises a transposon cassette carrying fusions between the growth rate-regulated Escherichia coli rrnBP1 promoter and different variant gfp genes. It is shown that the P1 promoter is regulated in the same way in E. coli and Pseudomonas putida, making it useful for monitoring of growth activity in organisms outside the group of enteric bacteria. Construction of fusions to genes encoding unstable Gfp proteins opened up the possibility of the monitoring of rates of rRNA synthesis and, in this way, allowing on-line determination of the distribution of growth activity in a complex community. With the use of these reporter tools, it is demonstrated that individual cells of a toluene-degrading P. putida strain growing in a benzyl alcohol-supplemented biofilm have different levels of growth activity which develop as the biofilm gets older. Cells that eventually grow very slowly or not at all may be stimulated to restart growth if provided with a more easily metabolizable carbon source. Thus, the dynamics of biofilm growth activity has been tracked to the level of individual cells, cell clusters, and microcolonies.
TI  - Identification of bacterial proteins observed in MALDI TOF mass spectra from whole cells.
AB  - Characteristic ions in the MALDI TOF mass spectra from bacterial cells have been  associated with four known proteins. The proteins, observed both from cells and in filtered cellular suspensions, were isolated by HPLC and identified on the basis of their mass spectra and their partial amino acid sequence, determined using the Edman method (10-15 residues). The acid resistance proteins HdeA and HdeB give rise to ions near m/z 9735 and 9060 in MALDI TOF mass spectra from cells and from extracts of both Escherichia coli 1090 and Shigella flexneri PHS-1059. However, the proteins associated with proteolytic cleavage by the peptidase Lep, rather than the precursor proteins, were observed, both using cells and from cellular extracts. A cold-shock protein, CspA, was associated with the ion near m/z 7643 from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Similarly, a cold-acclimation protein, CapB, was identified as the source of the ion near m/z 7684 in P. putida. This last protein was homologous with a known CapB from P. fragi. While these experiments involved the detection of known or homologous proteins from typical bacteria, this same approach could also be applied to the detection of unique proteins or biomarker proteins associated with other bacteria of public health significance.
TI  - Conserved cytoplasmic loops are important for both the transport and chemotaxis functions of PcaK, a protein from Pseudomonas putida with 12 membrane-spanning regions.
AB  - Chemotaxis to the aromatic acid 4-hydroxybenzoate (4-HBA) by Pseudomonas putida is mediated by PcaK, a membrane-bound protein that also functions as a 4-HBA transporter. PcaK belongs to the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) of transport proteins, none of which have so far been implicated in chemotaxis. Work with two well-studied MFS transporters, LacY (the lactose permease) and TetA (a tetracycline efflux protein), has revealed two stretches of amino acids located between the second and third (2-3 loop) and the eighth and ninth (8-9 loop) transmembrane regions that are required for substrate transport. These sequences are conserved among most MFS transporters, including PcaK. To determine if PcaK has functional requirements similar to those of other MFS transport proteins and to analyze the relationship between the transport and chemotaxis functions of PcaK, we generated strains with mutations in amino acid residues located in the 2-3 and 8-9 loops of PcaK. The mutant proteins were analyzed in 4-HBA transport and chemotaxis assays. Cells expressing mutant PcaK proteins had a range of phenotypes. Some transported at wild-type levels, while others were partially or completely defective in 4-HBA transport. An aspartate residue in the 8-9 loop that has no counterpart in LacY and TetA, but is conserved among members of the aromatic acid/H(+) symporter family of the MFS, was found to be critical for 4-HBA transport. These results indicate that conserved amino acids in the 2-3 and 8-9 loops of PcaK are required for 4-HBA transport. Amino acid changes that decreased 4-HBA transport also caused a decrease in 4-HBA chemotaxis, but the effect on chemotaxis was sometimes slightly more severe. The requirement of PcaK for both 4-HBA transport and chemotaxis demonstrates that P. putida has a chemoreceptor that differs from the classical chemoreceptors described for Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium.
TI  - Heterologous expression and characterization of the purified oxygenase component  of Rhodococcus globerulus P6 biphenyl dioxygenase and of chimeras derived from it.
AB  - In this work, we have purified the His-tagged oxygenase (ht-oxygenase) component  of Rhodococcus globerulus P6 biphenyl dioxygenase. The alpha or beta subunit of P6 oxygenase was exchanged with the corresponding subunit of Pseudomonas sp. strain LB400 or of Comamonas testosteroni B-356 to create new chimeras that were purified ht-proteins and designated ht-alpha(P6)beta(P6), ht-alpha(P6)beta(LB400), ht-alpha(P6)beta(B-356), ht-alpha(LB400)beta(P6), and ht-alpha(B-356)beta(P6). ht-alpha(P6)beta(P6), ht-alpha(P6)beta(LB400), ht-alpha(P6)beta(B-356) were not expressed active in recombinant Escherichia coli cells carrying P6 bphA1 and bphA2, P6 bphA1 and LB400 bphE, or P6 bphA1 and B-356 bphE because the [2Fe-2S] Rieske cluster of P6 oxygenase alpha subunit was not assembled correctly in these clones. On the other hand ht-alpha(LB400)beta(P6) and ht-alpha(B-356)beta(P6) were produced active in E. coli. Furthermore, active purified ht-alpha(P6)beta(P6), ht-alpha(P6)beta(LB400), ht-alpha(P6)beta(B-356), showing typical spectra for Rieske-type proteins, were obtained from Pseudomonas putida KT2440 carrying constructions derived from the new shuttle E. coli-Pseudomonas vector pEP31, designed to produce ht-proteins in Pseudomonas. Analysis of the substrate selectivity pattern of these purified chimeras toward selected chlorobiphenyls indicate that the catalytic capacity of hybrid enzymes comprised of an alpha and a beta subunit recruited from distinct biphenyl dioxygenases is not determined specifically by either one of the two subunits.
TI  - Replication origin region of the chromosome of alkaliphilic Bacillus halodurans C-125.
AB  - An 18.5-kb DNA fragment containing the oriC region of the chromosome of the alkaliphilic Bacillus halodurans C-125 was obtained by PCR and sequenced. Sixteen open reading frames (ORFs) were identified in this region. A sequencing similarity search using the BSORF database found that ORF1 to 13 all had significant similarities to gene products of Bacillus subtilis. Three other ORFs (ORF14-16) of unknown function were positioned down-stream of gyrB instead of rrnO, which is found in the same region in the case of B. subtilis. The ORF organization from gidA to gyrA was the same as that of B. subtilis. The gene organization and the location of the DnaA-box region were also similar to those of the chromosomes of other bacteria, such as Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida. There were two DnaA-box clusters (Box-region C and R) with a consensus sequence TTATCCACA on both sides of the dnaA gene but another DnaA box cluster (Box-region L) which is found in the region between thdF and jag in B. subtilis was not found in the corresponding region in the case of alkaliphilic Bacillus halodurans C-125.
TI  - Cloning, molecular analysis, and expression of the polyhydroxyalkanoic acid synthase (phaC) gene from Chromobacterium violaceum.
AB  - The polyhydroxyalkanoic acid synthase gene from Chromobacterium violaceum (phaC(Cv)) was cloned and characterized. A 6.3-kb BamHI fragment was found to contain both phaC(Cv) and the polyhydroxyalkanoic acid (PHA)-specific 3-ketothiolase (phaA(Cv)). Escherichia coli strains harboring this fragment produced significant levels of PHA synthase and 3-ketothiolase, as judged by their activities. While C. violaceum accumulated poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) or poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) when grown on a fatty acid carbon source, Klebsiella aerogenes and Ralstonia eutropha (formerly Alcaligenes eutrophus), harboring phaC(Cv), accumulated the above-mentioned polymers and, additionally, poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyhexanoate) when even-chain-length fatty acids were utilized as the carbon source. This finding suggests that the metabolic environments of these organisms are sufficiently different to alter the product range of the C. violaceum PHA synthase. Neither recombinant E. coli nor recombinant Pseudomonas putida harboring phaC(Cv) accumulated significant levels of PHA. Sequence analysis of the phaC(Cv) product shows homology with several PHA synthases, most notably a 48% identity with that of Alcaligenes latus (GenBank accession no. AAD10274).
TI  - Not only the nature of peptide but also the characteristics of cell membrane determine the antimicrobial mechanism of a peptide.
AB  - The mechanisms of antimicrobial actions of magainin 2, buforin II and poly L-lysine against various Escherichia coli strains were studied. Poly L-lysine inhibited BL21, AD 434 and GroE+/DnaK+ growth without lysing the cell. Magainin 2 had a pore-forming activity on BL 21 and AD 434 membrane but could not inhibit the GroE+/DnaK+ growth in a nutrient-rich medium. Buforin II, which killed BL21 and AD 434 without cell membrane damage, lysed GroE+/DnaK+ to death. Once they were introduced into the cell by electroporation, all three peptides were able to inhibit cell growth at concentrations of 10 times lower than their MICs. These results indicate that the nature of the peptide and also the characteristics of the cell membrane determine the antimicrobial actions of a peptide.
TI  - Outer membrane changes in a toluene-sensitive mutant of toluene-tolerant Pseudomonas putida IH-2000.
AB  - We isolated a toluene-sensitive mutant, named mutant No. 32, which showed unchanged antibiotic resistance levels, from toluene-tolerant Pseudomonas putida IH-2000 by transposon mutagenesis with Tn5. The gene disrupted by insertion of Tn5 was identified as cyoC, which is one of the subunits of cytochrome o. The membrane protein, phospholipid, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of IH-2000 and that of mutant No. 32 were examined and compared. Some of the outer membrane proteins showed a decrease in mutant No. 32. The fatty acid components of LPS were found to be dodecanoic acid, 2-hydroxydodecanoic acid, 3-hydroxydodecanoic acid, and 3-hydroxydecanoic acid in both IH-2000 and No. 32; however, the relative proportions of these components differed in the two strains. Furthermore, cell surface hydrophobicity was increased in No. 32. These data suggest that mutation of cyoC caused the decrease in outer membrane proteins and the changing fatty acid composition of LPS. These changes in the outer membrane would cause an increase in cell surface hydrophobicity, and mutant No. 32 is considered to be sensitive to toluene.
TI  - Copurification of the FpvA ferric pyoverdin receptor of Pseudomonas aeruginosa with its iron-free ligand: implications for siderophore-mediated iron transport.
AB  - The Pseudomonas aeruginosa FpvA receptor is a TonB-dependent outer membrane transport protein that catalyzes uptake of ferric pyoverdin across the outer membrane. Surprisingly, FpvA expressed in P. aeruginosa grown in an iron-deficient medium copurifies with a ligand X that we have characterized by UV, fluorescence, and mass spectrometry as being iron-free pyoverdin (apo-PaA). PaA was absent from FpvA purified from a PaA-deficient P. aeruginosa strain. The properties of ligand binding in vitro revealed very similar affinities of apo-PaA and ferric-PaA to FpvA. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer was used to study in vitro the formation of the FpvA-PaA-Fe complex in the presence of PaA-Fe or citrate-Fe. The circular dichroism spectrum of FpvA indicated a 57% beta-structure content typical of porins and in agreement with the 3D structures of the siderophore receptors FhuA and FepA. In the absence of the protease's inhibitors, a truncated form of FpvA lacking 87 amino acids at its N-terminus was purified. This truncated form still bound PaA, and its beta-sheet content was conserved. This N-terminal region displays significant homology to the N-terminal periplasmic extensions of FecA from Escherichia coli and PupB from Pseudomonas putida, which were previously shown to be involved in signal transduction. This suggests a similar function for FpvA. The mechanism of iron transport in P. aeruginosa via the pyoverdin pathway is discussed in the light of all these new findings.

TI  - Quantification of bacterial lead resistance via activity assays.
AB  - The level of microbial resistance to heavy metals is an important issue for the microbial ecology of heavy metal-contaminated habitats. However, assays based upon growth in nutrient media will overestimate the resistance level due to metal ion interactions with inorganic and organic components. The analysis of Pb-resistant bacteria isolated from soils containing up to 38 mmol total Pb x kg(-1) indicated that PYT80B medium which did not contain inorganic salts, contained low amounts of organic matter, and was buffered with a molecule that did not interact with metal ions (2-N-morpholinoethanesulfonic acid (MES)) provided the lowest estimates of lead resistance. However, better results were obtained by assaying metabolic activity (aerobic respiration) of resting cells suspended in 10 mM MES. By this criterion, 50% inhibition of Arthrobacter JS7 was found at 37 microM Pb(NO3)2. The effects of Pb+2 concentrations upon respiration of resting cells and growth rate in PYT80B medium were similar. The activity assay also showed that metal resistance was induced to higher levels when Arthrobacter JS7 was grown in the presence of Pb.
TI  - Development of a bioconversion process for production of cis-1S,2R-indandiol from indene by recombinant Escherichia coli constructs.
AB  - Recombinant Escherichia coli cells expressing the toluene dioxygenase (TDO) genes from Pseudomonas putida convert indene to cis-1S,2R-indandiol, a potentially important intermediate for the chemical synthesis of the HIV-1 protease inhibitor, Crixivan. A bioconversion process was developed through optimization of medium composition and reaction conditions at the shake-flask and 23-1 fermentor scales. A cis-1,2-indandiol productivity of approx. 1000 mg/l was achieved with construct TDO123, which represents a 50-fold increase over the initial titer. Varying the bioconversion conditions did not change the enantiomeric excess (e.e.) for the 1S,2R enantiomer from about 30%, suggesting that toluene dioxygenase intrinsically converts indene to 1S,2R- and 1R,2S-indandiols at a ratio of 2:1. Further inclusion of the Pseudomonas dehydrogenase gene in construct D160-1 led to the production of chirally pure cis-1S,2R-indandiol (e.e. > 99%) as a result of the selective degradation of the 1R,2S enantiomer, with the overall yield (650 mg/l) proportionally reduced. A single stage process was developed for D160-1 and scaled up to the 23-1 fermentor, achieving a cis-1S,2R-indandiol titer of 1200 mg/l.
TI  - Laboratory evolution of peroxide-mediated cytochrome P450 hydroxylation.
AB  - Enzyme-based chemical transformations typically proceed with high selectivity under mild conditions, and are becoming increasingly important in the pharmaceutical and chemical industries. Cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s) constitute a large family of enzymes of particular interest in this regard. Their biological functions, such as detoxification of xenobiotics and steroidogenesis, are based on the ability to catalyse the insertion of oxygen into a wide variety of compounds. Such a catalytic transformation might find technological applications in areas ranging from gene therapy and environmental remediation to the selective synthesis of pharmaceuticals and chemicals. But relatively low turnover rates (particularly towards non-natural substrates), low stability and the need for electron-donating cofactors prohibit the practical use of P450s as isolated enzymes. Here we report the directed evolution of the P450 from Pseudomonas putida to create mutants that hydroxylate naphthalene in the absence of cofactors through the 'peroxide shunt' pathway with more than 20-fold higher activity than the native enzyme. We are able to screen efficiently for improved mutants by coexpressing them with horseradish peroxidase, which converts the products of the P450 reaction into fluorescent compounds amenable to digital imaging screening. This system should allow us to select and develop mono- and di-oxygenases into practically useful biocatalysts for the hydroxylation of a wide range of aromatic compounds.

TI  - Cloning, sequence analysis, and expression of the Pseudomonas putida 33/1 1H-3-hydroxy-4-oxoquinoline 2,4-dioxygenase gene, encoding a carbon monoxide forming dioxygenase.
AB  - 1H-3-hydroxy-4-oxoquinoline 2,4-dioxygenase (Qdo) from the 1H-4-oxoquinoline utilizing Pseudomonas putida strain 33/1, which catalyzes the cleavage of 1H-3-hydroxy-4-oxoquinoline to carbon monoxide and N-formylanthranilate, is devoid of any transition metal ion or other cofactor and thus represents a novel type of ring-cleavage dioxygenase. Gene qdo was cloned and sequenced. Its overexpression in Escherichia coli yielded recombinant His-tagged Qdo which was catalytically active. Qdo exhibited 36% and 16% amino acid identity to 1H-3-hydroxy-4-oxoquinaldine 2,4-dioxygenase (Hod) and atropinesterase (a serine hydrolase), respectively. Qdo as well as Hod possesses a SXSHG motif, resembling the motif GXSXG of the serine hydrolases which comprises the active-site nucleophile (X=arbitrary residue).
TI  - An alkane-responsive expression system for the production of fine chemicals
AB  - Membrane-located monooxygenase systems, such as the Pseudomonas putida mt-2-derived xylene oxygenase, are attractive for challenging transformations of apolar compounds, including enantiospecific epoxidations, but are difficult to synthesize at levels that are useful for application to biotechnological processes. In order to construct efficient biocatalysis strains, we utilized the alkane-responsive regulatory system of the OCT plasmid-located alk genes of Pseudomonas oleovorans GPo1, a very attractive system for recombinant biotransformation processes. Determination of the nucleotide sequence of alkS, whose activated gene product positively regulates the transcription of the structural genes alkBFGHJKL, on a 3.7-kb SalI-HpaI OCT plasmid fragment was completed, and the N-terminal amino acid sequence of an AlkS-LacZ fusion protein was found to be consistent with the predicted DNA sequence. The alkS gene and the alkBp promoter were assembled into a convenient alkane-responsive genetic expression cassette which allowed expression of the xylene oxygenase genes in a recombinant Escherichia coli strain at a specific activity of 91 U per g (dry weight) of cells when styrene was the substrate. This biocatalyst was used to produce (S)-styrene oxide in two-liquid-phase cultures. Volumetric productivities of more than 2 g of styrene oxide per h per liter of aqueous phase were obtained; these values represented a fivefold improvement compared with previous results.
TI  - The physiological contribution of Acinetobacter PcaK, a transport system that acts upon protocatechuate, can be masked by the overlapping specificity of VanK.
AB  - VanK is the fourth member of the ubiquitous major facilitator superfamily of transport proteins to be identified that, together with PcaK, BenK, and MucK, contributes to aromatic catabolism in Acinetobacter sp. strain ADP1. VanK and PcaK have overlapping specificity for p-hydroxybenzoate and, most clearly, for protocatechuate: inactivation of both proteins severely impairs growth with protocatechuate, and the activity of either protein alone can mask the phenotype associated with inactivation of its homolog. Furthermore, vanK pcaK double-knockout mutants appear completely unable to grow in liquid culture with the hydroaromatic compound quinate, although such cells on plates convert quinate to protocatechuate, which then accumulates extracellularly and is readily visible as purple staining. This provides genetic evidence that quinate is converted to protocatechuate in the periplasm and is in line with the early argument that quinate catabolism should be physically separated from aromatic amino acid biosynthesis in the cytoplasm so as to avoid potential competition for intermediates common to both pathways. Previous studies of aromatic catabolism in Acinetobacter have taken advantage of the ability to select directly strains that contain a spontaneous mutation blocking the beta-ketoadipate pathway and preventing the toxic accumulation of carboxymuconate. By using this procedure, strains with a mutation in structural or regulatory genes blocking degradation of vanillate, p-hydroxybenzoate, or protocatechuate were selected. In this study, the overlapping specificity of the VanK and PcaK permeases was exploited to directly select strains with a mutation in either vanK or pcaK. Spontaneous mutations identified in vanK include a hot spot for frameshift mutation due to contraction of a G6 mononucleotide repeat as well as point mutations producing amino acid substitutions useful for analysis of VanK structure and function. Preliminary second-site suppression analysis using transformation-facilitated PCR mutagenesis in one VanK mutant gave results similar to those using LacY, the prototypic member of the major facilitator superfamily, consistent with the two proteins having a similar mechanism of action. The selection for transport mutants described here for Acinetobacter may also be applicable to Pseudomonas putida, where the PcaK permease has an additional role in chemotaxis.
TI  - Cloning and characterization of mdc genes encoding malonate decarboxylase from Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - The DNA fragment encoding malonate decarboxylase, involved in malonate assimilation, was cloned from Pseudomonas putida. The 11-kb DNA fragment contained nine open reading frames, which were designated mdcABCDEGHLM in the given order. N-terminal protein sequencing established that the mdcA, mdcC, mdcD, mdcE and mdcH genes encoded subunits alpha, delta, beta, gamma and epsilon of the malonate decarboxylase, respectively. Malonate decarboxylase was functionally expressed in Escherichia coli from plasmid harboring the entire gene cluster or the mdc genes lacking the mdcL and mdcM genes. The mdcL and mdcM genes encode membrane proteins and disruption of the genes of P. putida by the insertion of a kanamycin resistance cassette reduced the malonate uptake activity of the organism. Thus, we conclude that MdcLM is a malonate transporter.
TI  - Allylic or benzylic stabilization is essential for catalysis by bacterial benzyl  alcohol dehydrogenases.
AB  - Benzyl alcohol dehydrogenase from Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (AC-BADH) and TOL plasmid-encoded benzyl alcohol dehydrogenase from Pseudomonas putida (TOL-BADH) have previously been shown to oxidize a variety of aromatic alcohols but not aliphatic substrates. Here, we have expressed the genes for AC-BADH and TOL-BADH in Escherichia coli, purified the resulting over-expressed enzymes, and shown that each is an effective catalyst of both benzylic and allylic alcohol oxidation, but not of oxidation of nonallylic analogs. Enzyme specificity (kcat/Km) for both enzymes was higher with an aliphatic, allylic alcohol (3-methyl-2-buten-1-ol) than with benzyl alcohol. These results suggest that bacterial benzyl alcohol dehydrogenases use the resonance stabilization provided by allylic and benzylic alcohols to promote catalysis.
TI  - Expression and export of Pseudomonas putida NTU-8 creatinase by Escherichia coli  using the chitinase signal sequence of Aeromonas hydrophila.
AB  - The gene for the creatinase from Pseudomonas putida NTU-8 was sequenced and revealed an open reading frame (ORF) of 1209 base pairs encoding a polypeptide of 403 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight (M(r)) of 45,691. The deduced amino acid sequence is very similar to that of the creatinase of Pseudomonas putida and Flavobacterium sp. An overproduction system for the chitinase signal peptide--creatinase hybrid gene was constructed by using the pQE-51 expression vector in E. coli JM109. The amount of this fusion enzyme was about 50% exported into the periplasmic space of E. coli.
TI  - Cloning, expression, and nucleotide sequence of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa 142 ohb genes coding for oxygenolytic ortho dehalogenation of halobenzoates.
AB  - We have cloned and characterized novel oxygenolytic ortho-dehalogenation (ohb) genes from 2-chlorobenzoate (2-CBA)- and 2,4-dichlorobenzoate (2,4-dCBA)-degrading Pseudomonas aeruginosa 142. Among 3,700 Escherichia coli recombinants, two clones, DH5alphaF'(pOD22) and DH5alphaF'(pOD33), converted 2-CBA to catechol and 2,4-dCBA and 2,5-dCBA to 4-chlorocatechol. A subclone of pOD33, plasmid pE43, containing the 3,687-bp minimized ohb DNA region conferred to P. putida PB2440 the ability to grow on 2-CBA as a sole carbon source. Strain PB2440(pE43) also oxidized but did not grow on 2,4-dCBA, 2,5-dCBA, or 2,6-dCBA. Terminal oxidoreductase ISPOHB structural genes ohbA and ohbB, which encode polypeptides with molecular masses of 20,253 Da (beta-ISP) and 48,243 Da (alpha-ISP), respectively, were identified; these proteins are in accord with the 22- and 48-kDa (as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) polypeptides synthesized in E. coli and P. aeruginosa parental strain 142. The ortho-halobenzoate 1,2-dioxygenase activity was manifested in the absence of ferredoxin and reductase genes, suggesting that the ISPOHB utilized electron transfer components provided by the heterologous hosts. ISPOHB formed a new phylogenetic cluster that includes aromatic oxygenases featuring atypical structural-functional organization and is distant from the other members of the family of primary aromatic oxygenases. A putative IclR-type regulatory gene (ohbR) was located upstream of the ohbAB genes. An open reading frame (ohbC) of unknown function that overlaps lengthwise with ohbB but is transcribed in the opposite direction was found. The ohbC gene codes for a 48,969-Da polypeptide, in accord with the 49-kDa protein detected in E. coli. The ohb genes are flanked by an IS1396-like sequence containing a putative gene for a 39,715-Da transposase A (tnpA) at positions 4731 to 5747 and a putative gene for a 45,247-Da DNA topoisomerase I/III (top) at positions 346 to 1563. The ohb DNA region is bordered by 14-bp imperfect inverted repeats at positions 56 to 69 and 5984 to 5997.
TI  - Photometric assay for polynucleotide phosphorylase.
AB  - Polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase) is a prokaryotic enzyme that catalyzes phosphorolysis of polynucleotides with release of NDPs. It is also believed to play a key role in turnover of prokaryotic transcripts, thus regulating gene expression. At the moment, only radioisotopic methods are available for assaying PNPase in crude extracts; these involve incubating [32P]phosphate and poly(A) in the presence of the enzyme, separating [32P]phosphate from [32P]ADP, and quantifying ADP by scintillation counting. Photometric assay using pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase as auxiliary enzymes is not feasible in crude extracts because of endogenous ATPase activities, which regenerate ADP from the ATP released by pyruvate kinase. Here, we present a simple photometric assay that uses a cyclic detection system which, due to the sequential action of pyruvate kinase and hexokinase, results in an exponential increase of ADP and glucose 6-phosphate. Glucose 6-phosphate is then revealed by a glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase reaction. Based on the theoretical model, a linear increase in absorbance is predicted as a function of the square of the reaction time, with a slope proportional to PNPase activity. Experimental data confirmed the theoretical predictions and showed that the assay was quantitative and unquestionably specific. We also devised a simple procedure for determining absolute enzyme activities (expressed in micromoles of product formed per minute) using exact amounts of pure PNPase as internal standards.
TI  - Biological activities of C-terminal 15-residue synthetic fragment of melittin: design of an analog with improved antibacterial activity.
AB  - Melittin, the 26-residue predominant toxic peptide from bee venom, exhibits potent antibacterial activity in addition to its hemolytic activity. The synthetic peptide of 15 residues corresponding to its C-terminal end (MCF), which encompasses its most amphiphilic segment, is now being shown to possess antibacterial activity about 5-7 times less compared to that of melittin. MCF, however, is 300 times less hemolytic. An analog of MCF, MCFA, in which two cationic residues have been transpositioned to the N-terminal region from the C-terminal region, exhibits antibacterial activity comparable to that of melittin, but is only marginally more hemolytic than MCF. The biophysical properties of the peptides, like folding and aggregation, correlate well with their biological properties.
TI  - Homogenization and crystallization of histidine ammonia-lyase by exchange of a surface cysteine residue.
AB  - Histidase (histidine ammonia-lyase, EC 4.3.1.3) from Pseudomonas putida was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified. In the absence of thiols the tetrameric enzyme gave rise to undefined aggregates and suitable crystals could not be obtained. The solvent accessibility along the chain was predicted from the amino acid sequence. Among the seven cysteines, only one was labeled as 'solvent-exposed'. The exchange of this cysteine to alanine abolished all undefined aggregations and yielded readily crystals diffracting to 1.8 A resolution.
TI  - Role of the alternative sigma factor sigmaS in expression of the AlkS regulator of the Pseudomonas oleovorans alkane degradation pathway.
AB  - The AlkS protein activates transcription from the PalkB promoter, allowing the expression of a number of genes required for the assimilation of alkanes in Pseudomonas oleovorans. We have identified the promoter from which the alkS gene is transcribed, PalkS, and analyzed its expression under different conditions and genetic backgrounds. Transcription from PalkS was very low during the exponential phase of growth and increased considerably when cells reached the stationary phase. The PalkS -10 region was similar to the consensus described for promoters recognized by Escherichia coli RNA polymerase bound to the alternative sigma factor sigmaS, which directs the expression of many stationary-phase genes. Reporter strains containing PalkS-lacZ transcriptional fusions showed that PalkS promoter is very weakly expressed in a Pseudomonas putida strain bearing an inactivated allele of the gene coding for sigmaS, rpoS. When PalkS was transferred to E. coli, transcription started at the same site and expression was higher in stationary phase only if sigmaS-RNA polymerase was present. The low levels of AlkS protein generated in the absence of sigmaS were enough to support a partial induction of the PalkB promoter. The -10 and -35 regions of PalkS promoter also show some similarity to the consensus recognized by sigmaD-RNA polymerase, the primary form of RNA polymerase. We propose that in exponential phase PalkS is probably recognized both by sigmaD-RNA polymerase (inefficiently) and by sigmaS-RNA polymerase (present at low levels), leading to low-level expression of the alkS gene. sigmaS-RNA polymerase would be responsible for the high level of activity of PalkS observed in stationary phase.
TI  - The PalkBFGHJKL promoter is under carbon catabolite repression control in Pseudomonas oleovorans but not in Escherichia coli alk+ recombinants.
AB  - The alk genes are located on the OCT plasmid of Pseudomonas oleovorans and encode an inducible pathway for the utilization of n-alkanes as carbon and energy sources. We have investigated the influence of alternative carbon sources on the induction of this pathway in P. oleovorans and Escherichia coli alk+ recombinants. In doing so, we confirmed earlier reports that induction of alkane hydroxylase activity in pseudomonads is subject to carbon catabolite repression. Specifically, synthesis of the monooxygenase component AlkB is repressed at the transcriptional level. The alk genes have been cloned into plasmid pGEc47, which has a copy number of about 5 to 10 per cell in both E. coli and pseudomonads. Pseudomonas putida GPo12 is a P. oleovorans derivative cured of the OCT plasmid. Upon introduction of pGEc47 in this strain, carbon catabolite repression of alkane hydroxylase activity was reduced significantly. In cultures of recombinant E. coli HB101 and W3110 carrying pGEc47, induction of AlkB and transcription of the alkB gene were no longer subject to carbon catabolite repression. This suggests that carbon catabolite repression of alkane degradation is regulated differently in Pseudomonas and in E. coli strains. These results also indicate that PalkBFGHJKL, the Palk promoter, might be useful in attaining high expression levels of heterologous genes in E. coli grown on inexpensive carbon sources which normally trigger carbon catabolite repression of native expression systems in this host.
TI  - Cloning and sequence analysis of two catechol-degrading gene clusters from the aniline-assimilating bacterium Frateuria species ANA-18.
AB  - The aniline-assimilating bacterium Frateuria species ANA-18 produced two catechol 1,2-dioxygenases, CD I and CD II, and two muconate cycloisomerases, MC I and MC II. The catA genes catA1 and catA2 encoding CD I and CD II, respectively, were cloned from a gene library of this bacterium. The catA1 gene was clustered with catB1 encoding MC I, catC1 encoding muconolactone isomerase (MI), catD encoding beta-ketoadipate enol-lactone hydrolase (ELH), and ORFR1 encoding a putative LysR-type regulator. The organization of these genes was ORFR1catB1C1D. The catA2 gene also constructed a gene cluster involving catB2 encoding MC II, catC2 encoding MI, and ORFR2 encoding a putative LysR-type regulator with the alignment of ORFR2catB2A2C2. The intergenic regions of ORFR1-catB1 and ORFR2-catB2 contained homologous sequences with the catR-catB intergenic region containing a repression binding site and activation binding site of CatR in Pseudomonas putida. These findings suggest that the two cat clusters were regulated independently in their expression. When a product of cloned catD was added to a reaction mixture containing beta-ketoadipate enol-lactone, beta-ketoadipate was produced. This observation showed that the cloned catD encoded ELH and was expressed in Escherichia coli. We found that Frateuria sp. ANA-18 had a large plasmid with a molecular size more than 100kb. Polymerase chain reaction amplifying partial catA genes and Southern hybridization analyses with probes containing catA genes were conducted, to examine the localization of the two catA genes. We concluded that the catA1 and catA2 genes were located on the chromosomal and large plasmid DNAs, respectively, in Frateuria sp. ANA-18.

TI  - Thermoregulated expression and characterization of an NAD(P)H-dependent 2-cyclohexen-1-one reductase in the plant pathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas syringae pv. glycinea.
AB  - The phytopathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas syringae pv. glycinea PG4180.N9 causes  bacterial blight of soybeans and preferably infects its host plant during periods of cold, humid weather conditions. To identify proteins differentially expressed at low temperatures, total cellular protein fractions derived from PG4180.N9 grown at 18 and 28 degreesC were separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Of several proteins which appeared to be preferentially present at 18 degreesC, a 40-kDa protein with an isoelectric point of approximately 5 revealed significant N-terminal sequence homology to morphinone reductase (MR) of Pseudomonas putida M10. The respective P. syringae gene was isolated from a genomic cosmid library of PG4180, and its nucleotide sequence was determined. It was designated ncr for NAD(P)H-dependent 2-cyclohexen-1-one reductase. Comparison of the 1,083-bp open reading frame with database entries revealed 48% identity and 52% similarity to the MR-encoding morB gene of P. putida M10. The ncr gene was overexpressed in Escherichia coli, and its gene product was used to generate polyclonal antisera. Purified recombinant Ncr protein was enzymatically characterized with NAD(P)H and various morphinone analogs as substrates. So far, only 2-cyclohexen-1-one and 3-penten-2-one were found to be substrates for Ncr. By high-pressure liquid chromatography analysis, flavin mononucleotide could be identified as the noncovalently bound prosthetic group of this enzyme. The distribution of the ncr gene in different Pseudomonas species and various strains of P. syringae was analyzed by PCR and Southern blot hybridization. The results indicated that the ncr gene is widespread among P. syringae pv. glycinea strains but not in other pathovars of P. syringae or in any of the other Pseudomonas strains tested.
TI  - A sensitive, viable-colony staining method using Nile red for direct screening of bacteria that accumulate polyhydroxyalkanoic acids and other lipid storage compounds.
AB  - The oxazine dye Nile blue A and its fluorescent oxazone form, Nile red, were used to develop a simple and highly sensitive staining method to detect poly(3-hydroxybutyric acid) and other polyhydroxyalkanoic acids (PHAs) directly in growing bacterial colonies. In contrast to previously described methods, these dyes were directly included in the medium at concentrations of only 0.5 microgram/ml, and growth of the cells occurred in the presence of the dyes. This allowed an estimation of the presence of PHAs in viable colonies at any time during the growth experiment and a powerful discrimination between PHA-negative and PHA-positive strains. The presence of Nile red or Nile blue A did not affect growth of the bacteria. This viable-colony staining method was in particular applicable to gram-negative bacteria such as Azotobacter vinelandii, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas putida, and Ralstonia eutropha. It was less suitable for discriminating between PHA-negative and PHA-positive strains of gram-positive bacteria such as Bacillus megaterium or Rhodococcus ruber, but it could also be used to discriminate between wax-ester- and triacylglycerol-negative and -positive strains of Acinetobacter calcoaceticus or Rhodococcus opacus. The potential of this new method and its application to further investigations of PHA synthases and PHA biosynthesis pathways are discussed.
TI  - The anti-sigma factors.
AB  - A mechanism for regulating gene expression at the level of transcription utilizes an antagonist of the sigma transcription factor known as the anti-sigma (anti-sigma) factor. The cytoplasmic class of anti-sigma factors has been well characterized. The class includes AsiA form bacteriophage T4, which inhibits Escherichia coli sigma 70; FlgM, present in both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, which inhibits the flagella sigma factor sigma 28; SpoIIAB, which inhibits the sporulation-specific sigma factor, sigma F and sigma G, of Bacillus subtilis; RbsW of B. subtilis, which inhibits stress response sigma factor sigma B; and DnaK, a general regulator of the heat shock response, which in bacteria inhibits the heat shock sigma factor sigma 32. In addition to this class of well-characterized cytoplasmic anti-sigma factors, a new class of homologous, inner-membrane-bound anti-sigma factors has recently been discovered in a variety of eubacteria. This new class of anti-sigma factors regulates the expression of so-called extracytoplasmic functions, and hence is known as the ECF subfamily of anti-sigma factors. The range of cell processes regulated by anti-sigma factors is highly varied and includes bacteriophage phage growth, sporulation, stress response, flagellar biosynthesis, pigment production, ion transport, and virulence.
TI  - Polyhydroxyalkanoate inclusion body-associated proteins and coding region in Bacillus megaterium.
AB  - Polyhydroxyalkanoic acids (PHA) are carbon and energy storage polymers that accumulate in inclusion bodies in many bacteria and archaea in response to environmental conditions. This work presents the results of a study of PHA inclusion body-associated proteins and an analysis of their coding region in Bacillus megaterium 11561. A 7, 917-bp fragment of DNA was cloned and shown to carry a 4,104-bp cluster of 5 pha genes, phaP, -Q, -R, -B, and -C. The phaP and -Q genes were shown to be transcribed in one orientation, each from a separate promoter, while immediately upstream, phaR, -B, and -C were divergently transcribed as a tricistronic operon. Transfer of this gene cluster to Escherichia coli and to a PhaC- mutant of Pseudomonas putida gave a Pha+ phenotype in both strains. Translational fusions to the green fluorescent protein localized PhaP and PhaC to the PHA inclusion bodies in living cells. The data presented are consistent with the hypothesis that the extremely hydrophilic protein PhaP is a storage protein and suggests that PHA inclusion bodies are not only a source of carbon, energy, and reducing equivalents but are also a source of amino acids.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of toluene-sensitive mutants from Pseudomonas putida IH-2000.
AB  - Two toluene-sensitive mutants were generated from Pseudomonas putida IH-2000, the first known toluene-tolerant isolate, by Tn5 transposon mutagenesis. These mutants were unable to grow in the presence of toluene (log P(ow) 2.8) but they could grow in medium overlaid with organic solvents having a log P(ow) value higher than that of toluene such as p-xylene (log P(ow) 3.1), cyclohexane (log P(ow) 3.4) and n-hexane (log P(ow) 3.9). The Tn5 transposable element knocked out a cyoB-like gene in one mutant and a cyoC-like gene in the other mutant. Seven open reading frames were found in a 5.5-kb region containing the cyoB- and cyoC-like genes of strain IH-2000. ORFs 3.7 showed significant identity to the cyoABCDE gene products of Escherichia coli, but ORFs 1 and 2 showed no significant homology to any protein reported so far. The growth patterns of the Tn5 mutants with the inactivated cyo-like gene were similar to that of the wild-type strain in the absence of organic solvents, although the doubling times were slightly longer than that of the wild-type strain. Our findings indicate that cyo is an important gene for toluene tolerance, although its role is still unclear.
TI  - Genetic and biochemical analyses of the tec operon suggest a route for evolution  of chlorobenzene degradation genes.
AB  - The TecA broad-spectrum chlorobenzene dioxygenase of Burkholderia sp. strain PS12 catalyzes the first step in the mineralization of 1,2,4, 5-tetrachlorobenzene. The catabolic genes were localized on a small plasmid that belongs to the IncPbeta incompatibility group. PCR analysis of the genetic environment of the tec genes indicated high similarity to the transposon-organized catabolic tcb chlorobenzene degradation genes of Pseudomonas sp. strain P51. Sequence analysis of the regions flanking the tecA genes revealed an upstream open reading frame (ORF) with high similarity to the todF 2-hydroxy-6-oxo-2,4-heptadienoate hydrolase gene of Pseudomonas putida F1 and a discontinuous downstream ORF showing high similarity to the todE catechol 2,3-dioxygenase gene of strain F1. Both homologues in strain P51 exist only as deletion remnants. We suggest that different genetic events thus led to inactivation of the perturbing meta-cleavage enzymes in strains P51 and PS12 during the evolution of efficient chlorobenzene degradation pathways. Biochemical characterization of TodF-like protein TlpF and a genetically refunctionalized TodE-like protein, TlpE, produced in Escherichia coli provided data consistent with the proposed relationships.
TI  - Characterization of cell lysis in Pseudomonas putida induced upon expression of heterologous killing genes.
AB  - Active biological containment systems are based on the controlled expression of killing genes. These systems are of interest for the Pseudomonadaceae because of the potential applications of these microbes as bioremediation agents and biopesticides. The physiological effects that lead to cell death upon the induction of expression of two different heterologous killing genes in nonpathogenic Pseudomonas putida KT2440 derivatives have been analyzed. P. putida CMC4 and CMC12 carry in their chromosomes a fusion of the PA1-04/03 promoter to the Escherichia coli gef gene and the phiX174 lysis gene E, respectively. Expression of the killing genes is controlled by the LacI protein, whose expression is initiated from the XylS-dependent Pm promoter. Under induced conditions, killing of P. putida CMC12 cells mediated by phiX174 lysis protein E was faster than that observed for P. putida CMC4, for which the Gef protein was the killing agent. In both cases, cell death occurred as a result of impaired respiration, altered membrane permeability, and the release of some cytoplasmic contents to the extracellular medium.
TI  - Degradation of polychlorinated biphenyl metabolites by naphthalene-catabolizing enzymes.
AB  - The ability of the dehydrogenase and ring cleavage dioxygenase of the naphthalene degradation pathway to transform 3,4-dihydroxylated biphenyl metabolites was investigated. 1,2-Dihydro-1, 2-dihydroxynaphthalene dehydrogenase was expressed as a histidine-tagged protein. The purified enzyme transformed 2, 3-dihydro-2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl, 3,4-dihydro-3,4-dihydroxybiphenyl, and 3,4-dihydro-3,4-dihydroxy-2,2',5,5'-tetrachlorobiphenyl to 2, 3-dihydroxybiphenyl, 3,4-dihydroxybiphenyl (3,4-DHB), and 3, 4-dihydroxy-2,2',5,5'-tetrachlorobiphenyl (3,4-DH-2,2',5,5'-TCB), respectively. Our data also suggested that purified 1, 2-dihydroxynaphthalene dioxygenase catalyzed the meta cleavage of 3, 4-DHB in both the 2,3 and 4,5 positions. This enzyme cleaved 3, 4-DH-2,2',5,5'-TCB and 3,4-DHB at similar rates. These results demonstrate the utility of the naphthalene catabolic enzymes in expanding the ability of the bph pathway to degrade polychlorinated biphenyls.
TI  - Combined physical and genetic map of the Pseudomonas putida KT2440 chromosome.
AB  - A combined physical and genetic map of the Pseudomonas putida KT2440 genome was constructed from data obtained by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis techniques (PFGE) and Southern hybridization. Circular genome size was estimated at 6.0 Mb by adding the sizes of 19 SwaI, 9 PmeI, 6 PacI, and 6 I-CeuI fragments. A complete physical map was achieved by combining the results of (i) analysis of PFGE of the DNA fragments resulting from digestion of the whole genome with PmeI, SwaI, I-CeuI, and PacI as well as double digestion with combinations of these enzymes and (ii) Southern hybridization analysis of the whole wild-type genome digested with different enzymes and hybridized against a series of probes obtained as cloned genes from different pseudomonads of rRNA group I and Escherichia coli, as P. putida DNA obtained by PCR amplification based on sequences deposited at the GenBank database, and by labeling of macrorestriction fragments of the P. putida genome eluted from agarose gels. As an alternative, 10 random mini-Tn5-Km mutants of P. putida KT2440 were used as a source of DNA, and the band carrying the mini-Tn5 in each mutant was identified after PFGE of a series of complete chromosomal digestions and hybridization with the kanamycin resistance gene of the mini-Tn5 as a probe. We established a circular genome map with an average resolution of 160 kb. Among the 63 genes located on the genetic map were key markers such as oriC, 6 rrn loci (rnnA to -F), recA, ftsZ, rpoS, rpoD, rpoN, and gyrB; auxotrophic markers; and catabolic genes for the metabolism of aromatic compounds. The genetic map of P. putida KT2440 was compared to those of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 and Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW25. The chromosomal backbone revealed some similarity in gene clustering among the three pseudomonads but differences in physical organization, probably as a result of intraspecific rearrangements.
TI  - Formation of poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyhexanoate) by PHA synthase from Ralstonia eutropha.
AB  - The acetoacetyl-CoA reductase and the polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) synthase from Ralstonia eutropha (formerly Alcaligenes eutrophus) were expressed in Escherichia coli, Klebsiella aerogenes, and PHA-negative mutants of R. eutropha and Pseudomonas putida. While expression in E. coli strains resulted in the accumulation of poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) [PHB], strains of R. eutropha, P. putida and K. aerogenes accumulated poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyhexanoate) [poly(3HB-co-3HHx)] when even chain fatty acids were provided as carbon source, and poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) [poly(3HB-co-3HV)] when odd chain fatty acids were provided as carbon source. This suggests that fatty acid degradation can be directly accessed employing only the acetoacetyl-CoA reductase and the PHA synthase. This is also the first proof that the PHA synthase from R. eutropha can incorporate 3-hydroxyhexanoate (3HHx) into PHA and has, therefore, a broader substrate specificity than previously described.
TI  - Protein organization on the PHA inclusion cytoplasmic boundary.
AB  - Polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) cellular inclusions consist of polyesters, phospholipids, and proteins. Both the polymerase and the depolymerase enzymes are active components of the structure. Recently, proteins associated with these inclusions have been described in a number of bacterial species. In order to further clarify the structure and function of these proteins in relation to polymer inclusions, ultrastructural studies of isolated polymer inclusions were initiated. The surface boundary characteristics of polymer inclusions, produced by several genera of bacteria, two different Pseudomonas putida deletion mutants and by Escherichia coli recombinants, were examined. The recombinant E. coli carried either the PHB biosynthesis operon (phaCAB) from Ralstonia eutropha alone, or both this operon and a gene encoding an inclusion surface protein of R. eutropha (phaP). The results support two suggestions: (i) specific genes in the PHA gene cluster code for the proteins forming the surface boundary arrays which characterize the polymer inclusion; and (ii) transfer of such a gene would result in subcellular compartmentalization of accumulating polymer. Although the proteins appear to serve a similar function among different genera, nevertheless, the different surface proteins are encoded by a variety of non-homologous genetic sequences.
TI  - Cloning and nucleotide sequence of amidase gene from Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - Amidases are a class of enzymes which convert amides to acids and have potential  value in the development of commercial bioprocesses for the production of useful chemicals. A gene encoding an amidase in Pseudomonas putida 5B has been cloned, sequenced, and overexpressed in Escherichia coli. An additional open reading frame (P38K) encoding a putative protein of 38 kDa was found immediately upstream of the amidase gene. This work continues our characterization of a P. putida operon, which now appears to include P38K, amidase, and a stereo-specific nitrile hydratase. This characterization underlies continuing efforts in biocatalyst development.
TI  - Int-B13, an unusual site-specific recombinase of the bacteriophage P4 integrase family, is responsible for chromosomal insertion of the 105-kilobase clc element of Pseudomonas sp. Strain B13.
AB  - Pseudomonas sp. strain B13 carries the clcRABDE genes encoding chlorocatechol-degradative enzymes on the self-transmissible 105-kb clc element. The element integrates site and orientation specifically into the chromosomes of various bacterial recipients, with a glycine tRNA structural gene (glyV) as the integration site. We report here the localization and nucleotide sequence of the integrase gene and the activity of the integrase gene product in mediating site-specific integration. The integrase gene (int-B13) was located near the right end of the clc element. It consisted of an open reading frame (ORF) of maximally 1,971 bp with a coding capacity for 657 amino acids (aa). The full-length protein (74 kDa) was observed upon overexpression and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis separation. The N-terminal 430 aa of the predicted Int-B13 protein had substantial similarity to integrases from bacteriophages of the P4 family, but Int-B13 was much larger than P4-type integrases. The C-terminal 220 aa of Int-B13 were homologous to an ORF flanking a gene cluster for naphthalene degradation in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PaK1. Similar to the bacteriophages phiR73 and P4, the clc element integrates into the 3' end of the target tRNA gene. This target site was characterized from four different recipient strains into which the clc element integrated, showing sequence specificity of the integration. In Pseudomonas sp. strain B13, a circular form of the clc element, which carries an 18-bp DNA sequence identical to the 3'-end portion of glyV as part of its attachment site (attP), could be detected. Upon chromosomal integration of the clc element into a bacterial attachment site (attB), a functional glyV was reconstructed at the right end of the element. The integration process could be demonstrated in RecA-deficient Escherichia coli with two recombinant plasmids, one carrying the int-B13 gene and the attP site and the other carrying the attB site of Pseudomonas putida F1.
TI  - High expression, purification, and properties of recombinant homocysteine alpha,  gamma-lyase.
AB  - Homocysteine alpha,gamma-lyase from the anaerobic protozoan parasite Trichomonas  vaginalis has been cloned from genomic DNA using PCR methods and expressed in Escherichia coli with a vector containing the T7 promoter. The recombinant homocysteine alpha,gamma-lyase (rHCYase) is expressed as the major protein in the host E. coli cells. The enzyme was purified to approximately 90% purity using heat treatment at 50 degreesC, precipitation steps with polyethyleneimine, polyethylene glycol 8000, and high sodium chloride, DEAE-Sepharose FF chromatography, and phenyl-Sepharose 6 FF chromatography. The final yield was greater than 50%, which encompassed an approximate 18-fold purification. The enzyme is a homotetramer with a monomer molecular weight of 43K and contains pyridoxal phosphate. The Trichomonas rHCYase is selective for homocysteine with respect to very low cysteinase activity in contrast to the alpha,gamma-lyase from Pseudomonas putida, which has very high cysteinase activity with respect to homocysteine. The T. vaginalis and P. putida alpha,gamma-lyases readily separate on a phenyl-Sepharose 6 FF column with the T. vaginalis enzyme eluting first. rHCYase is stable up to 50 degreesC and active over a pH range of 6-8. These properties of high recombinant expression in E. coli, a simple and effective high-yield purification procedure and high relative specificity for homocysteine with respect to cysteine, make rHCYase a promising candidate to use for the diagnosis of hyperhomocystenemia, which has been demonstrated to be a major risk factor for the onset and mortality of cardiovascular disease of all types.
TI  - Cloning of the Nocardia corallina polyhydroxyalkanoate synthase gene and production of poly-(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyhexanoate) and poly-(3-hydroxyvalerate-co-3-hydroxyheptanoate).
AB  - The polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) synthase gene (phaCNc) from Nocardia corallina was identified in a lambda library on a 6-kb BamHI fragment. A 2.8-kb XhoII subfragment was found to contain the intact PHA synthase. This 2.8-kb fragment was subjected to DNA sequencing and was found to contain the coding region for the PHA synthase and a small downstream open reading frame of unknown function. On the basis of DNA sequence, phaCNc is closest in homology to the PHA synthases (phaCPaI and phaCPaII) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (approximately 41% identity and 55% similarity). The 2.8-kb XhoII fragment containing phaCNc was subcloned into broad host range mobilizable plasmids and transferred into Escherichia coli, Klebsiella aerogenes (both containing a plasmid bearing phaA and phaB from Ralstonia eutropha), and PHA-negative strains of R. eutropha and Pseudomonas putida. The recombinant strains were grown on various carbon sources and the resulting polymers were analyzed. In these strains, the PHA synthase from N. corallina was able to mediate the production of poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyhexanoate) containing high levels of 3-hydroxyhexanoate when grown on hexanoate and larger even-chain fatty acids and poly(3-hydroxyvalerate-co-3-hydroxyheptanoate) containing high levels of 3-hydroxyheptanoate when grown on heptanoate or larger odd-chain fatty acids.
TI  - Identification and characterization of IS1411, a new insertion sequence which causes transcriptional activation of the phenol degradation genes in Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - A new insertion sequence (IS element), IS1411, was identified downstream of the phenol degradation genes pheBA that originated from plasmid DNA of Pseudomonas sp. strain EST1001. According to sequence analysis, IS1411 belongs to a new family of IS elements that has recently been named the ISL3 family (J. Mahillon and M. Chandler, Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 62:725-774, 1998). IS1411 generates 8-bp duplication of the target DNA and carries 24-bp inverted repeats (IRs), highly homologous to the IRs of other IS elements belonging to this family. IS1411 was discovered as a result of insertional activation of promoterless pheBA genes in Pseudomonas putida due to the presence of outward-directed promoters at the left end of IS1411. Both promoters located on the IS element have sequences that are similar to the consensus sequence of Escherichia coli sigma70. IS1411 can produce IS circles, and the circle formation is enhanced when two copies of the element are present in the same plasmid.
TI  - Crystallization and preliminary X-ray studies of Pseudomonas putida histidine ammonium-lyase.
AB  - Histidine ammonium-lyase from P. putida was expressed in Escherichia coli, purified to homogeneity, and crystallized by the vapour-diffusion method using polyethylene glycol 3350 as the precipitant. The crystals, which diffract to at least 2.5 A resolution, exhibit the symmetry of space group P212121, with unit-cell parameters a = 89.7, b = 138.2 and c = 164.8 A. The asymmetric unit contains a tetramer, and the crystals have a Vm value of 2.41 A3 Da-1.
TI  - Resistance to tellurite as a selection marker for genetic manipulations of Pseudomonas strains.
AB  - Resistance to the toxic compound potassium tellurite (Telr) has been employed as  a selection marker built into a set of transposon vectors and broad-host-range plasmids tailored for genetic manipulations of Pseudomonas strains potentially destined for environmental release. In this study, the activated Telr determinants encoded by the cryptic telAB genes of plasmid RK2 were produced, along with the associated kilA gene, as DNA cassettes compatible with cognate vectors. In one case, the Telr determinants were assembled between the I and O ends of a suicide delivery vector for mini-Tn5 transposons. In another case, the kilA and telAB genes were combined with a minimal replicon derived from a variant of Pseudomonas plasmid pPS10, which is able to replicate in a variety of gram-negative hosts and is endowed with a modular collection of cloning and expression assets. Either in the plasmid or in the transposon vector, the Telr marker was combined with a 12-kb DNA segment of plasmid pWW0 of Pseudomonas putida mt-2 encoding the upper TOL pathway enzymes. This allowed construction of antibiotic resistance-free but selectable P. putida strains with the ability to grow on toluene as the sole carbon source through an ortho-cleavage catabolic pathway.
TI  - c-type cytochromes and manganese oxidation in Pseudomonas putida MnB1.
AB  - Pseudomonas putida MnB1 is an isolate from an Mn oxide-encrusted pipeline that can oxidize Mn(II) to Mn oxides. We used transposon mutagenesis to construct mutants of strain MnB1 that are unable to oxidize manganese, and we characterized some of these mutants. The mutants were divided into three groups: mutants defective in the biogenesis of c-type cytochromes, mutants defective in genes that encode key enzymes of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and mutants defective in the biosynthesis of tryptophan. The mutants in the first two groups were cytochrome c oxidase negative and did not contain c-type cytochromes. Mn(II) oxidation capability could be recovered in a c-type cytochrome biogenesis-defective mutant by complementation of the mutation.
TI  - Catabolism of phenylacetic acid in Escherichia coli. Characterization of a new aerobic hybrid pathway.
AB  - The paa cluster of Escherichia coli W involved in the aerobic catabolism of phenylacetic acid (PA) has been cloned and sequenced. It was shown to map at min 31.0 of the chromosome at the right end of the mao region responsible for the transformation of 2-phenylethylamine into PA. The 14 paa genes are organized in three transcription units: paaZ and paaABCDEFGHIJK, encoding catabolic genes; and paaXY, containing the paaX regulatory gene. The paaK gene codes for a phenylacetyl-CoA ligase that catalyzes the activation of PA to phenylacetyl-CoA (PA-CoA). The paaABCDE gene products, which may constitute a multicomponent oxygenase, are involved in PA-CoA hydroxylation. The PaaZ protein appears to catalyze the third enzymatic step, with the paaFGHIJ gene products, which show significant similarity to fatty acid beta-oxidation enzymes, likely involved in further mineralization to Krebs cycle intermediates. Three promoters, Pz, Pa, and Px, driven the expression of genes paaZ, paaABCDEFGHIJK, and paaX, respectively, have been identified. The Pa promoter is negatively controlled by the paaX gene product. As PA-CoA is the true inducer, PaaX becomes the first regulator of an aromatic catabolic pathway that responds to a CoA derivative. The aerobic catabolism of PA in E. coli represents a novel hybrid pathway that could be a widespread way of PA catabolism in bacteria.
TI  - The rpoS gene regulates OP2, an operon for the lower pathway of xylene catabolism on the TOL plasmid, and the stress response in Pseudomonas putida mt-2.
AB  - Operon OP2 on the Pseudomonas putida TOL plasmid encodes enzymes for m-toluate catabolism; transcription of this operon is activated by XylS in the presence of m-toluate. Because transcriptional activation of OP2 specifically occurs in the stationary phase of growth both in P. putida and in Escherichia coli, we suspected that its transcription is dependent on RpoS (sigmaS). Therefore, we constructed a rpoS disruption strain of P. putida mt-2, and assayed OP2 expression and other phenotypes. OP2 transcription was dependent on rpoS, indicating that the stationary-phase specific activation of OP2 is due to positive regulation by RpoS in P. putida mt-2. The rpoS mutant exhibited reduced viability during the stationary phase and was sensitive to high salt concentrations and H2O2. P. putida mt-2 has two catalase isozymes, KatA and KatB. Expression of the katB gene was specific to the stationary phase and entirely dependent on the rpoS gene, while the katA gene expressed during log phase partially required rpoS. There were no significant changes in tolerance to high temperature or UV light in the rpoS mutant. No difference was observed between the E. coli rpoS mutants and their parents in their capacity to activate OP2, suggesting that the mechanism of OP2 activation in the stationary phase of growth differs between P. putida and E. coli.
TI  - Methods for detection of conjugative plasmid transfer in aquatic environments.
AB  - Donor and recipient counter selection was evaluated by selecting bacteria that received plasmid RP4 by conjugation on filters and in lake water microcosms. Three counter selection systems were compared; (i) Use of antibiotic-resistant recipients, (ii) use of an auxotrophic donor, and (iii) use of a donor with chromosomal suicide genes. Transfer efficiencies of transconjugants per recipient obtained with the three different counter selection systems in filter-matings were not significantly different. Some nalidixic acid-resistant recipients became partly sensitive to nalidixic acid after receiving the plasmid. Use of an auxotrophic donor was a feasible and easy way to recover indigenous transconjugants. A strain with two copies of the suicide gene gef was successfully eliminated in filter-matings, but elimination of the donor in microcosms by induction of the suicide genes did not succeed. Thus, this counter selection system was not usable in microcosm experiments.
TI  - Exploration of the structural environment of the iron-sulfur cluster in putidaredoxin by nitrogen-15 NMR spectroscopy of selectively labeled cysteine residues.
AB  - Putidaredoxin is a di-iron protein whose paramagnetic region is not well characterized by 1H detected NMR. We have studied the structure of this region in greater detail by directly observed 15N NMR of oxidized and reduced putidaredoxin preparations in which the six cysteine residues are selectively labeled with 15N. A new method for preparation of a stable form of reduced putidaredoxin has been developed for use in NMR. The 15N NMR spectra of the oxidized and reduced forms are characteristically different, and we have measured and compared 15N chemical shifts, spin-lattice relaxation times (T1), and chemical shift/temperature dependences for both forms. Evidence for localized valencies of the iron atoms in the reduced form is presented. From the 15N T1 values of the oxidized form, reduced distances of the cysteine backbone 15N nuclei from the center of the Fe2S2 cluster have been calculated. These distances are consistent with those calculated from X-ray crystal structure data for five ferredoxins, and confirm the structural similarity of the Fe2S2 clusters in putidaredoxin and in these ferredoxins in the oxidized state.
TI  - Substrate specificity of and product formation by muconate cycloisomerases: an analysis of wild-type enzymes and engineered variants.
AB  - Muconate cycloisomerases play a crucial role in the bacterial degradation of aromatic compounds by converting cis,cis-muconate, the product of catechol ring cleavage, to (4S)-muconolactone. Chloromuconate cycloisomerases catalyze both the corresponding reaction and a dehalogenation reaction in the transformation of chloroaromatic compounds. This study reports the first thorough examination of the substrate specificity of the muconate cycloisomerases from Pseudomonas putida PRS2000 and Acinetobacter "calcoaceticus" ADP1. We show that they transform, in addition to cis,cis-muconate, 3-fluoro-, 2-methyl-, and 3-methyl-cis, cis-muconate with high specificity constants but not 2-fluoro-, 2-chloro-, 3-chloro-, or 2,4-dichloro-cis,cis-muconate. Based on known three-dimensional structures, variants of P. putida muconate cycloisomerase were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis to contain amino acids found in equivalent positions in chloromuconate cycloisomerases. Some of the variants had significantly increased specificity constants for 3-chloro- or 2,4-dichloromuconate (e.g., A271S and I54V showed 27- and 22-fold increases, respectively, for the former substrate). These kinetic improvements were not accompanied by a change from protoanemonin to cis,cis-dienelactone as the product of 3-chloro-cis,cis-muconate conversion. The rate of 2-chloro-cis,cis-muconate turnover was not significantly improved, nor was this compound dehalogenated to any significant extent. However, the direction of 2-chloro-cis,cis-muconate cycloisomerization could be influenced by amino acid exchange. While the wild-type enzyme discriminated only slightly between the two possible cycloisomerization directions, some of the enzyme variants showed a strong preference for either (+)-2-chloro- or (+)-5-chloromuconolactone formation. These results show that the different catalytic characteristics of muconate and chloromuconate cycloisomerases are due to a number of features that can be changed independently of each other.
TI  - Adaptive mutagenesis: a process that generates almost exclusively beneficial mutations.
AB  - Adaptive mutations are spontaneous mutations that occur in microorganisms during  periods of prolonged stress in non-dividing or very slowly dividing populations and that are specific to the environmental challenge that causes that stress. This article reviews the literature on adaptive mutagenesis since 1993. The evidence that adaptive mutagenesis is both real and general is considered. The most widely used system for studying adaptive mutagenesis, reversion of an F'-borne lacI33 allele, is shown to be a special case that reflects more about F-plasmid biology than about adaptive mutagenesis in general. New evidence demonstrating that adaptive mutagenesis is, indeed, specific is discussed. A variety of genes whose products affect adaptive mutagenesis are discussed. A model to explain that specificity and new evidence in support of that model are considered, as are potential roles of adaptive mutagenesis in evolution and practical aspects of adaptive mutagenesis.
TI  - The gut of the soil microarthropod Folsomia candida (Collembola) is a frequently  changeable but selective habitat and a vector for microorganisms.
AB  - Interaction potentials between soil microarthropods and microorganisms were investigated with Folsomia candida (Insecta, Collembola) in microcosm laboratory experiments. Microscopic analysis revealed that the volumes of the simple, rod-shaped guts of adult specimens varied with their feeding activity, from 0.7 to 11.2 nl. A dense layer of bacterial cells, associated with the peritrophic membrane, was detected in the midgut by scanning electron microscopy. Depending on the molting stage, which occurred at intervals of approximately 4 days, numbers of heterotrophic, aerobic gut bacteria changed from 4.9 x 10(2) to 2.3 x 10(6) CFU per specimen. A total of 11 different taxonomic bacterial groups and the filamentous fungus Acremonium charticola were isolated from the guts of five F. candida specimens. The most abundant isolate was related to Erwinia amylovora (96.2% DNA sequence similarity to its 16S rRNA gene). F. candida preferred to feed on Pseudomonas putida and three indigenous gut isolates rather than eight different type culture strains. When luciferase reporter gene-tagged bacterial strains were pulse fed to F. candida, gut isolates were continuously shed for 8 days to several weeks but Escherichia coli HB101 was shed for only 1 day. Ratios of ingested to released bacterial cells demonstrated that populations of nonindigenous gut bacteria like Sinorhizobium meliloti L33 and E. coli HB101 were reduced by more than 4 orders of magnitude but that the population of gut isolate Alcaligenes faecalis HR4 was reduced only 500-fold. This work demonstrates that F. candida represents a frequently changeable but selective habitat for bacteria in terrestrial environments and that microarthropods have to be considered factors that modify soil microbial communities.
TI  - Cloning, sequencing, and phenotypic characterization of the rpoS gene from Pseudomonas putida KT2440.
AB  - A gene homologous to the rpoS gene of Escherichia coli was cloned from a Pseudomonas putida KT2440 gene bank by complementation of the rpoS-deficient strain E. coli ZK918. The rpoS gene of P. putida complemented the acid sensitivity and catalase deficiency of the rpoS mutant of E. coli and stimulated expression of the RpoS-controlled promoter, bolAp1. The gene was sequenced and found to be highly similar to the rpoS genes of other gram-negative bacteria. Like in other gram-negative bacteria, a homolog of the nlpD gene was found upstream to the rpoS gene. A transcriptional fusion of the promoter of the P. putida rpoS gene to the luxAB genes from Vibrio harveyi was constructed and used as an inactivated allele of rpoS for gene replacement of the wild-type copy in the chromosome of P. putida. The resultant rpoS mutant of P.putida, C1R1, showed reduced survival of carbon starvation and reduced cross-protection against other types of stress in cells starved for carbon, in particular after a challenge with ethanol. Survival in soil amended with m-methylbenzoate was also reduced in the mutant strain P. putida C1R1. The RpoS protein of P. putida controls the expression of more than 50 peptides, which are normally expressed in cells after a short period of carbon starvation.
TI  - Activation and repression of transcription at the double tandem divergent promoters for the xylR and xylS genes of the TOL plasmid of Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - The xylR and xylS genes are divergent and control transcription of the TOL plasmid catabolic pathways for toluene metabolism. Four promoters are found in the 300-bp intergenic region: Pr1 and Pr2 are constitutive sigma70-dependent tandem promoters that drive expression of xylR, while expression of the xylS gene is driven from Ps2, a constitutive sigma70-dependent promoter, and by the regulatable sigma54 class Ps1 promoter. In Ps1 the XylR targets (upstream activator sequences [UASs]) overlap the Pr promoters, and two sites for integration host factor (IHF) binding are located at the region from positions -2 to -30 (-2/-30 region) and the -137/-156 region, the latter overlapping the Pr promoters. When the XylR protein binds to the UASs in the absence of effector, it represses expression from Pr promoters. In the XylR-plus background and in the absence of an effector, the level of expression from Ps1 is low, although detectable, whereas Ps2 is active. In this background and in the presence of an effector, XylR increases autorepression. In a sigma54-deficient Pseudomonas putida background, no expression occurred from Ps1 regardless of the presence of an effector. However, in the presence of an effector, the amount of RNA produced from Pr promoters was almost undetectable. This finding suggests that when no transcription occurred at the Ps1 promoter, clearance of XylR from the UASs was almost negligible. In this background, expression from Ps2 was very high regardless of the presence of an effector; this finding suggests that RNA polymerase containing sigma54 modulates expression from the downstream Ps2 sigma70-dependent promoter. In a P. putida IHF-minus background and in the presence of effector, Ps1 expression was the highest found; in contrast, the basal levels of this promoter were the lowest observed. This finding suggests that IHF acts in vivo as a repressor of the sigma54-dependent Ps1 promoter. In an IHF-deficient host background, expression from Ps2 in the presence of effector was negligible. Thus, binding of RNA polymerase containing sigma54 at the upstream promoter may modulate expression from the Ps2 promoter.
TI  - Expression of the transposase gene tnpA of Tn4652 is positively affected by integration host factor.
AB  - Tn4652 is a derivative of the toluene degradation transposon Tn4651 that belongs  to the Tn3 family of transposons (M. Tsuda and T. Iino, Mol. Gen. Genet. 210:270-276, 1987). We have sequenced the transposase gene tnpA of transposon Tn4652 and mapped its promoter to the right end of the element. The deduced amino acid sequence of tnpA revealed 96.2% identity with the putative transposase of Tn5041. Homology with other Tn3 family transposases was only moderate (about 20 to 24% identity), suggesting that Tn4652 and Tn5041 are distantly related members of the Tn3 family. Functional analysis of the tnpA promoter revealed that it is active in Pseudomonas putida but silent in Escherichia coli, indicating that some P. putida-specific factor is required for the transcription from this promoter. Additionally, tnpA promoter activity was shown to be modulated by integration host factor (IHF). The presence of an IHF-binding site upstream of the tnpA promoter enhanced the promoter activity. The positive role of IHF was also confirmed by the finding that the enhancing effect of IHF was not detected in the P. putida ihfA-deficient strain A8759. Moreover, the Tn4652 terminal sequences had a negative effect on transcription from the tnpA promoter in the ihfA-defective strain. This finding suggests that IHF not only enhances transcription from the tnpA promoter but also alleviates the negative effect of terminal sequences of Tn4652 on the promoter activity. Also, an in vitro binding assay demonstrated that both ends of Tn4652 bind IHF from a cell lysate of E. coli.
TI  - New unstable variants of green fluorescent protein for studies of transient gene  expression in bacteria.
AB  - Use of the green fluorescent protein (Gfp) from the jellyfish Aequorea victoria is a powerful method for nondestructive in situ monitoring, since expression of green fluorescence does not require any substrate addition. To expand the use of Gfp as a reporter protein, new variants have been constructed by the addition of short peptide sequences to the C-terminal end of intact Gfp. This rendered the Gfp susceptible to the action of indigenous housekeeping proteases, resulting in protein variants with half-lives ranging from 40 min to a few hours when synthesized in Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida. The new Gfp variants should be useful for in situ studies of temporal gene expression.
TI  - A novel -2Fe-2S- ferredoxin from Pseudomonas putida mt2 promotes the reductive reactivation of catechol 2,3-dioxygenase.
AB  - Catechol 2,3-dioxygenase (XylE) is a component of the TOL plasmid-encoded pathway for the degradation of toluene and xylenes and catalyzes the dioxygenolytic cleavage of the aromatic ring. Purified XylE is oxygen-sensitive and unstable in vitro, particularly in the presence of substituted catechol substrates, but it is stabilized in vivo by another protein, XylT, encoded by the xylT gene located just upstream of xylE. In this study, we have purified to homogeneity the XylT product from a recombinant Escherichia coli strain containing a hyperexpressible xylT gene and characterized it as a novel [2Fe-2S] ferredoxin. It is the first example of a soluble ferredoxin with a net positive charge at neutral pH. The EPR signal of the iron sulfur cluster has rhombic symmetry as is the case for plant-type ferredoxins, but the XylT absorbance spectrum resembles more closely that of adrenodoxin. The midpoint redox potential was determined to be -373 +/- 6 mV, at pH 8. 5. XylT was unusually unstable for a [2Fe-2S] ferredoxin, with half-lives of 69 min at 25 degrees C in air and 70 min at 37 degrees C in argon. With photochemically reduced 5-deazaflavin for the controlled generation of reductant, it was demonstrated that XylT mediates the rapid reactivation of purified inactive catechol 2,3-dioxygenase in vitro. Inactivation of XylE by 4-methylcatechol resulted in oxidation of the active site iron to a high spin ferric state that was detectable by EPR. Spectroscopic evidence presented here demonstrates that XylT reactivates XylE through reduction of the iron atom in the active site of the enzyme. It is the first instance of a ferredoxin-mediated reactivation of an enzyme. The level of expression of XylT in Pseudomonas putida mt2 cells is low and the calculated XylT/XylE molar ratio is consistent with the proposal that XylE reactivation involves catalytic nonstoichiometric amounts of XylT.
TI  - A novel phenol hydroxylase and catechol 2,3-dioxygenase from the thermophilic Bacillus thermoleovorans strain A2: nucleotide sequence and analysis of the genes.
AB  - The new thermophilic Bacillus thermoleovorans strain A2 degrades phenol and cresols via the meta cleavage pathway. The first two enzymes involved in this process, the phenol hydroxylase and catechol 2,3-dioxygenase, encoded by the pheA and pheB genes respectively, were cloned and sequenced. The deduced amino acid sequence of pheA contains 524 amino acids with a theoretical M(r) of 59,602 Da and displays less than 10% amino acid identity to known phenol hydroxylases. The greatest amino acid identity (54%) displayed by pheA is with the larger component of the two-component 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid hydroxylase from Escherichia coli W encoded by hpaB. No second component was present on the 3.8-kb insert. The consensus sequence GXGXXG for FAD/NAD binding sites is not present in pheA. PheB encodes a new catechol 2,3-dioxygenase of 308 amino acids (M(r) 35,487 Da) which has greatest amino acid identity (43%) with the 3-methyl catechol 2,3-dioxygenase of Pseudomonas putida UCC2 encoded by tdnC. Both pheA and pheB encode new enzymes which display low sequence homology with those previously published.
TI  - The primitive protozoon Trichomonas vaginalis contains two methionine gamma-lyase genes that encode members of the gamma-family of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate-dependent enzymes.
AB  - Methionine gamma-lyase, the enzyme that catalyzes the breakdown of methionine by  an alpha,gamma-elimination reaction and is a member of the gamma-family of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate-dependent enzymes, is present in high activity in the primitive protozoan parasite Trichomonas vaginalis but is absent from mammals. Two genes, mgl1 and mgl2, encoding methionine gamma-lyase, have now been isolated from T. vaginalis. They are both single copy, encode predicted proteins (MGL1 and MGL2) of 43 kDa, have 69% sequence identity with each other, and show a high degree of sequence identity to methionine gamma-lyase from Pseudomonas putida (44%) and other related pyridoxal 5'-phosphate-dependent enzymes such as human cystathionine gamma-lyase (42%) and Escherichia coli cystathionine beta-lyase (30%). mgl1 and mgl2 have been expressed in E. coli as a fusion with a six-histidine tag and the recombinant proteins (rMGL1 and rMGL2) purified by metal-chelate affinity chromatography. rMGL1 and rMGL2 were found to have high activity toward methionine (10.4 and 0.67 mumol/min/mg of protein, respectively), homocysteine (370 and 128 mumol/min/mg of protein), cysteine (6.02 and 1.06 mumol/min/mg of protein), and O-acetylserine (3.74 and 1.51 mumol/min/mg of protein), but to be inactive toward cystathionine. Site-directed mutagenesis of an active site cysteine (C113G for MGL1 and C116G for MGL2) reduced the activity of the recombinant enzymes toward both methionine and homocysteine by approximately 80% (rMGL1) and 90% (rMGL2). In contrast, the activity of mutated rMGL2 toward cysteine and O-acetylserine was increased (to 214 and 142%, respectively), whereas that of mutated rMGL1 was reduced to 39 and 49%, respectively. These findings demonstrate the importance of this cysteine residue in the alpha,beta-elimination and alpha, gamma-elimination reactions catalyzed by trichomonad methionine gamma-lyase.
TI  - Identification of major antigenic proteins of Pasteurella piscicida.
AB  - Two different antigenic protein-coding clones (PPA1 and PPA2) were isolated using anti-Pasteurella piscicida rabbit serum from a genomic DNA library of P. piscicida strain KP9038. The PPA1 and PPA2 expressed 7 kDa and 45 kDa proteins in Escherichia coli, respectively, and the molecular sizes of these expressed proteins are the same as these of the major antigenic proteins of P. piscicida. PPA1 encodes a protein of 83 amino acids residues, which is similar to the bacterial lipoprotein. Comparison of the predicted amino acid sequence of the PPA1-encoded 7 kDa protein of P. piscicida with previously reported bacterial lipoprotein sequence data revealed that it shares about 40% amino acid sequence identity. PPA2 has two large open reading frame (ORFs). The larger ORF (encoding 452 amino acid residues) encodes a homolog of DegQ protease, and the smaller ORF (371 amino acid residues) encodes a homolog of DegS protease. The antibodies reacted with the larger ORF-encoded 45 kDa DegQ homolog protein. The DegQ and DegS homolog proteins contain an export signal and a serine protease active site. The structural features of the PPA2-coding locus are similar to those of the loci in E. coli for the degQ and degS serine protease genes. A sequence in the 3' non-coding region of Vibrio hollisae thermostable hemolysin gene that is highly homologous with a similar located sequence in the Pseudomonas putida p-cresol methylhydroxylase gene is also found in the 3' non-coding region of the degS homolog gene of the PPA2.
TI  - PcaU, a transcriptional activator of genes for protocatechuate utilization in Acinetobacter.
AB  - The Acinetobacter pcaIJFBDKCHG operon encodes the six enzymes that convert protocatechuate to citric acid cycle intermediates. Directly downstream from the operon are qui and pob genes encoding sets of enzymes that convert quinate and p-hydroxybenzoate, respectively, to protocatechuate. Prior to this investigation, the only known regulatory gene in the pca-qui-pob cluster was pobR, which encodes a transcriptional activator that responds to p-hydroxybenzoate and activates transcription of pobA. The pca and qui genes were known to be expressed in response to protocatechuate, but a protein that mediated this induction had not been identified. This study was initiated by characterization of a spontaneous mutation that mapped upstream from pcaI and prevented expression of the pca genes. Sequencing of wild-type DNA extending from the translational start of pcaI through and beyond the location of the mutation revealed a 282-bp intergenic region and a divergently transcribed open reading frame, designated pcaU. Downstream from pcaU are two open reading frames encoding proteins similar in amino acid sequence to those associated with the oxidation of acyl thioesters. Inactivation of pcaU reduced the induced expression of pca structural genes by about 90% and impeded but did not completely prevent growth of the mutant cells with protocatechuate. PcaU was expressed in Escherichia coli and shown to bind to a portion of the pcaI-pcaU intergenic region containing a sequence identical in 16 of 19 nucleotide residues to a segment of the pob operator. Further similarity of the two regulatory systems is indicated by 54% amino acid sequence identity in the aligned primary structures of PobR and PcaU. The pob and pca systems were shown to differ, however, in the relative orientations of transcriptional starts with respect to the site where the activator binds to DNA, the size of the intergenic region, and the tightness of transcriptional control. The spontaneous mutation blocking pca gene expression was located in the promoter for the pca operon. The 19-nucleotide residue operator sequences were shown to be parts of a consensus associated with transcriptional activation of genes associated with protocatechuate catabolism. Two different binding sites for Pseudomonas putida PcaR differ from the consensus in only a single nucleotide residue, and DNA directly downstream from Acinetobacter pcaU contains a 19-bp segment differing from the consensus in only two residues. PcaU was shown to bind to DNA containing this segment as well as to the DNA in the pcaU-pcaI intergenic region.
TI  - Plasmid-mediated rifampicin resistance in Pseudomonas fluorescens.
AB  - Rifampicin is an antibiotic mostly used to treat tuberculosis and leprosy, and, occasionally, other diseases. Resistance is due to alterations in membrane permeability or to mutation in the rpoB gene coding for mRNA polymerase. Both these mechanisms originate via chromosomal mutation. However, a rifampicin-resistant Pseudomonas fluorescens strain harboured a multiresistance plasmid which transferred rifampicin resistance when transformed into P. putida or Escherichia coli. Rifampicin readily diffused into the sensitive cells of the E. coli and P. putida recipients, but the transformants with the plasmid, pSCL were resistant to the drug and did not accumulate it. Potassium cyanide restored the diffusion of rifampicin into the resistant cells, indicating that an efflux pump was involved in the resistance mechanism. The resistance of the transformants and the wild strain was also abolished in sphaeroplasts generated by EDTA lysozyme treatment. Analysis of membrane proteins by SDS-PAGE revealed the presence of two new proteins in the plasmid-containing cells of E. coli, P. putida and P. fluorescens and not in the plasmid-free cells. These may be involved in the efflux of rifampicin.
TI  - Development and testing of a bacterial biosensor for toluene-based environmental  contaminants.
AB  - A bacterial biosensor for benzene, toluene, and similar compounds has been constructed, characterized, and field tested on contaminated water and soil. The biosensor is based on a plasmid incorporating the transcriptional activator xylR from the TOL plasmid of Pseudomonas putida mt-2. The XylR protein binds a subset of toluene-like compounds and activates transcription at its promoter, Pu. A reporter plasmid was constructed by placing the luc gene for firefly luciferase under the control of XylR and Pu. When Escherichia coli cells were transformed with this plasmid vector, luminescence from the cells was induced in the presence of benzene, toluene, xylenes, and similar molecules. Accurate concentration dependencies of luminescence were obtained and exhibited K1/2 values ranging from 39.0 +/- 3.8 microM for 3-xylene to 2,690 +/- 160 microM for 3-methylbenzylalcohol (means +/- standard deviations). The luminescence response was specific for only toluene-like molecules that bind to and activate XylR. The biosensor cells were field tested on deep aquifer water, for which contaminant levels were known, and were able to accurately detect toluene derivative contamination in this water. The biosensor cells were also shown to detect BETX (benzene, toluene, and xylene) contamination in soil samples. These results demonstrate the capability of such a bacterial biosensor to accurately measure environmental contaminants and suggest a potential for its inexpensive application in field-ready assays.
TI  - Polyethylene glycol conjugation of recombinant methioninase for cancer therapy.
AB  - Recombinant methioninase (rMETase) is a homotetrameric pyridoxal 5'-phosphate enzyme of 172-kda molecular mass derived from Pseudomonas putida and cloned in Escherichia coli. rMETase has been found previously to be an effective, anti-tumor agent in vitro and in vivo. The enzyme targets the elevated minimal methionine requirement seen in all tumor types. In order to prevent immunological reactions which might be produced by multiple dosing of rMETase and to prolong the serum half-life of rMETase, the N-hydroxysuccinimidyl ester of methoxypolyethylene glycol propionic acid (M-SPA-PEG 5000) has been coupled to rMETase. Molar ratios of M-SPA-PEG-5000 (PEG) to rMETase from 10 to 40 were used for PEGylation of rMETase. PEGylation reactions were run at 20 degrees C for 30 to 60 min in reaction buffer (20 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.3). The PEGylated molecules (PEG-rMETase) were purified from unreacted PEG with Amicon 30 K centriprep concentrators or by Sephacryl S-300 HR gel-filtration chromatography. Unreacted rMETase was removed by DEAE Sepharose FF anion-exchange chromatography. The resulting PEG-rMETase subunit, from a PEG/rMETase ratio of 30/1 in the synthetic reaction, had a molecular mass of approximately 53 kda determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry, indicating the conjugation of two PEG molecules per subunit of rMETase and eight per tetramer. PEG-rMETase molecules obtained from reacting ratios of PEG /rMETase of 30/1 had enzyme activities of 70% of unmodified rMETase. PEGylation of rMETase increased the serum half-life of the enzyme in rats to approximately 160 min compared to 80 min for unmodified rMETase. PEG-rMETase could deplete serum methionine levels to less than 0.1 microM for approximately 8 h compared to 2 h for rMETase in rats. Efficacy studies of PEG-rMETase on human lung cancer and kidney cancer cells in vitro demonstrated a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 0.04 and 0.06 units/ml, respectively. These IC50 values were almost identical to unmodified rMETase, thus indicating maintenance of antitumor efficacy in the PEGylated enzyme. PEG-rMETase had an IC50 for normal lung and kidney cells of 0.8 and 1.5 units/ml, respectively, similar to rMETase. The efficacy data indicated that PEG-rMETase maintained the high level tumor selectivity of rMETase. PEG-rMETase injected intravenously in mice demonstrated a tumor/blood retention ratio of approximately 1/6 compared to 1/10 of unmodified enzyme, indicating that PEG-rMETase distributes to the tumor at least as effectively as rMETase.
TI  - Biochemical and genetic characterization of trans-2'-carboxybenzalpyruvate hydratase-aldolase from a phenanthrene-degrading Nocardioides strain.
AB  - trans-2'-Carboxybenzalpyruvate hydratase-aldolase was purified from a phenanthrene-degrading bacterium, Nocardioides sp. strain KP7, and characterized. The purified enzyme was found to have molecular masses of 38 kDa by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and 113 kDa by gel filtration chromatography. Thus, the homotrimer of the 38-kDa subunit constituted an active enzyme. The Km and kcat values of this enzyme for trans-2'-carboxybenzalpyruvate were 50 microM and 13 s(-1), respectively. trans-2'-Carboxybenzalpyruvate was transformed to 2-carboxybenzaldehyde and pyruvate by the action of this enzyme. The structural gene for this enzyme was cloned and sequenced; the length of this gene was 996 bp. The deduced amino acid sequence of this enzyme exhibited homology to those of trans-2'-hydroxybenzalpyruvate hydratase-aldolases from Pseudomonas putida PpG7 and Pseudomonas sp. strain C18.
TI  - Characterization of a gene cluster from Ralstonia eutropha JMP134 encoding metabolism of 4-methylmuconolactone.
AB  - A 2,585 bp chromosomal DNA segment of Ralstonia eutropha JMP134 (formerly: Alcaligenes eutrophus JMP134) which contains a gene cluster encoding part of the modified ortho-cleavage pathway encodes a putative transport protein for 4-methylmuconolactone, a novel 4-methylmuconolactone methylisomerase and methylmuconolactone isomerase. The putative 4-methylmuconolactone transporter, a protein with a calculated molecular mass of 45.8 kDa, exhibits sequence homology to other members of the major superfamily of transmembrane facilitators and shows the common structural motif of 12 transmembrane-spanning alpha-helical segments and the hallmark amino acid motif characteristic of the superfamily. Consistent with the novelty of the reaction catalyzed by 4-methylmuconolactone methylisomerase, no primary sequence homologies were found between this enzyme or its gene and other proteins or genes in the data banks, suggesting that this enzyme represents a new type of isomerase. The molecular mass of the native 4-methylmuconolactone methylisomerase was determined by gel filtration analysis to be 25 +/- 2 kDa. From the polynucleotide sequence of the gene, a molecular mass of 12.9 kDa was calculated and hence we predict a homodimeric quaternary structure. The high sensitivity of 4-methylmuconolactone methylisomerase to heavy metals and thiol-modifying reagents implicates the involvement of sulfhydryl groups in the catalytic reaction. The methylmuconolactone isomerase - calculated molecular mass 10.3 kDa - has a primary structure related to the classical muconolactone isomerases (EC 5.3.3.4) of Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, of two Pseudomonas putida strains and of Ralstonia eutropha JMP134, suggesting that these are all isoenzymes. Consistent with this proposal is the finding that the purified protein exhibits muconolactone-isomerizing activity.
TI  - Haloalkanoate dehalogenase II (DehE) of a Rhizobium sp.--molecular analysis of the gene and formation of carbon monoxide from trihaloacetate by the enzyme.
AB  - A 3-kb EcoRI fragment of genomic DNA from a Rhizobium sp. cloned into pUC19 endowed Escherichia coli K-12 with the ability to grow, albeit slowly, with 2-chloropropionic acid as substrate. The construct expressed weakly a gene that encoded a non-stereospecific 2-chloropropionic acid dehalogenase (dehalogenase II; DehE). The dehE gene was not closely linked to the organism's other two dehalogenase genes, dehD and dehL. The derived amino acid sequence of DehE showed little identity with DehD or DehL, but there was significant identity to two other dehalogenases that act non-selectively on 2-chloropropionic acid. The fragment carried a truncated ORF upstream of dehE that was 51% identical to a positively acting regulatory protein, DehR, required for expression of a Pseudomonas putida dehalogenase gene. In its complete form this gene could encode the Rhizobium sp. dehalogenase-regulatory protein. DehE dehalogenated tribromoacetic acid completely, forming stoichiometric amounts of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide as the other products.
TI  - Expression and characterization of a heme oxygenase (Hmu O) from Corynebacterium  diphtheriae. Iron acquisition requires oxidative cleavage of the heme macrocycle.
AB  - A full-length heme oxygenase gene from the pathogenic bacterium Corynebacterium diphtheriae has been subcloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The enzyme is expressed at high levels as a soluble catalytically active protein that results in the accumulation of biliverdin within the E. coli cells. The purified heme oxygenase forms a 1:1 complex with heme (Kd = 2.5 +/- 1 microM) and has hemeprotein spectra similar to those previously reported for the purified eukaryotic heme oxygenases. In the presence of an E. coli NADPH-dependent reductase isolated during the purification of Hmu O, the heme-Hmu O complex is catalytically turned over to yield biliverdin IXalpha and carbon monoxide. A number of redox partners were investigated for their ability to reconstitute Hmu O activity in vitro. Of these the most efficient appeared to be the recombinant NADH-dependent putidaredoxin/putidaredoxin reductase from Pseudomonas putida. As with the E. coli NADPH-dependent reductase the final products of the reaction were biliverdin IXalpha and carbon monoxide. This is the first bacterial heme oxygenase to be described to date. The close relationship between iron acquisition and pathogenesis suggests that the release of iron from heme by heme oxygenase may play a crucial role in the pathogenicity of C. diphtheriae.
TI  - A direct electrode-driven P450 cycle for biocatalysis.
AB  - The large potential of redox enzymes to carry out formation of high value organic compounds motivates the search for innovative strategies to regenerate the cofactors needed by their biocatalytic cycles. Here, we describe a bioreactor where the reducing power to the cycle is supplied directly to purified cytochrome CYP101 (P450cam; EC 1.14.15.1) through its natural redox partner (putidaredoxin) using an antimony-doped tin oxide working electrode. Required oxygen was produced at a Pt counter electrode by water electrolysis. A continuous catalytic cycle was sustained for more than 5 h and 2,600 enzyme turnovers. The maximum product formation rate was 36 nmol of 5-exo-hydroxycamphor/nmol of CYP101 per min.
TI  - Modulation of the function of the signal receptor domain of XylR, a member of a family of prokaryotic enhancer-like positive regulators.
AB  - The XylR protein controls expression from the Pseudomonas putida TOL plasmid upper pathway operon promoter (Pu) in response to aromatic effectors. XylR-dependent stimulation of transcription from a Pu::lacZ fusion shows different induction kinetics with different effectors. With toluene, activation followed a hyperbolic curve with an apparent K of 0.95 mM and a maximum beta-galactosidase activity of 2,550 Miller units. With o-nitrotoluene, in contrast, activation followed a sigmoidal curve with an apparent K of 0.55 mM and a Hill coefficient of 2.65. m-Nitrotoluene kept the XylR regulator in an inactive transcriptional form. Therefore, upon binding of an effector, the substituent on the aromatic ring leads to productive or unproductive XylR forms. The different transcriptional states of the XylR regulator are substantiated by XylR mutants. XylRE172K is a mutant regulator that is able to stimulate transcription from the Pu promoter in the presence of m-nitrotoluene; however, its response to m-aminotoluene was negligible, in contrast with the wild-type regulator. These results illustrate the importance of the electrostatic interactions in effector recognition and in the stabilization of productive and unproductive forms by the regulator upon aromatic binding. XylRD135N and XylRD135Q are mutant regulators that are able to stimulate transcription from Pu in the absence of effectors, whereas substitution of Glu for Asp135 in XylRD135E resulted in a mutant whose ability to recognize effectors was severely impaired. Therefore, the conformation of mutant XylRD135Q as well as XylRD135N seemed to mimic that of the wild-type regulator when effector binding occurred, whereas mutant XylRD135E seemed to be blocked in a conformation similar to that of wild-type XylR and XylRE172K upon binding to an inhibitor molecule such as m-nitrotoluene or m-aminotoluene.
TI  - Over-production of stereoselective nitrile hydratase from Pseudomonas putida 5B in Escherichia coli: activity requires a novel downstream protein.
AB  - The stereoselective nitrile hydratase (NHase) from Pseudomonas putida 5B has been over-produced in Escherichia coli. Maximal enzyme activity requires the co-expression of a novel downstream gene encoding a protein (P14K) of 127 amino acids, which shows no significant homology to any sequences in the protein database. Nitrile hydratase produced in transformed E. coli showed activity as high as 472 units/mg dry cell (sixfold higher than 5B), and retained the stereoselectivity observed in the native organism. Separated from the end of the beta subunit by only 51 bp, P14K appears to be part of an operon that includes the alpha and beta structural genes of nitrile hydratase, and other potential coding sequences.
TI  - Cloning of the Bacillus firmus OF4 cls gene and characterization of its gene product.
AB  - The gene that codes for cardiolipin (CL) synthase and an adjacent gene that codes for a MecA homolog in the alkaliphilic bacteria Bacillus firmus OF4 have been cloned and sequenced (GenBank accession number U88888). The cls gene contains 1509 nucleotides, corresponding to a polypeptide of 57.9 kDa. The predicted amino acid sequence has 129 identities and 100 similarities with the Escherichia coli CL synthase. Homologies were also noted with polypeptide sequences from putative cls genes from Bacillus subtilis and Pseudomonas putida. Conserved histidine, tyrosine, and serine residues may be part of the active site and participate in phosphatidyl group transfer. The B. firmus OF4 cls gene product was inserted into plasmid pET3 to form a recombinant plasmid pDG2, which overproduces CL synthase in E. coli. A membrane fraction containing the overproduced enzyme converts phosphatidylglycerol to CL and glycerol. The B. firmus enzyme is stimulated by potassium phosphate, inhibited by CL and phosphatidate, and has a slightly higher pH optimum than the E. coli enzyme.
TI  - Identification of the open reading frame for the Pseudomonas putida D-hydantoinase gene and expression of the gene in Escherichia coli.
AB  - A DNA fragment containing the gene for D-hydantoinase was cloned from Pseudomonas putida CCRC 12857 into Escherichia coli. The cloned gene contained an open reading frame (ORF) of 1485 nucleotides encoding a protein of 53.4 kDa in which the carboxyl terminal end is longer than that previously deduced from strain DSM 84. This ORF was verified by amino acid sequencing of amino and carboxyl termini, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and amino acid sequence comparison. Deletion analysis revealed that 32 amino acids from the carboxyl terminal end were essential for D-hydantoinase activity. Tagging of six consecutive histidyl residues to the amino terminus or to the carboxyl terminus of the enzyme did not significantly affect D-hydantoinase activity. Under the control of T5lac promoter and lactose induction, the D-hydantoinase activity of transformed E. coli reached 200 U l-1 which is about 20-fold higher than that of gene donor strain.
TI  - Heterologous expression of heterotrophic nitrification genes.
AB  - Paracoccus denitrificans is a heterotrophic organism capable of oxidizing ammonia to nitrite during growth on an organic carbon and energy source. This pathway, termed heterotrophic nitrification, requires the concerted action of an ammonia monooxygenase (AMO) and hydroxylamine oxidase (HAO). The genes required for heterotrophic nitrification have been isolated by introducing a Pa. denitrificans genomic library into Pseudomonas putida and screening for the accumulation of nitrite. In contrast to the situation in chemolithoautotrophic ammonia oxidizers, the genes encoding AMO and HAO are present in single linked copies in the genome of Pa. denitrificans. AMO from Pa. denitrificans expressed in Ps. putida is capable of oxidizing ethene (ethylene) to epoxyethane (ethylene oxide), which is indicative of a relaxed substrate specificity. Further, when expressed in the methylotroph Methylobacterium extorquens AM1, the AMO endows on this organism the ability to grow on ethene and methane. Thus, the Pa. denitrificans AMO is capable of oxidizing methane to methanol, as is the case for the AMO from Nitrosomonas europaea. The heterotrophic nitrification genes are moderately toxic in M. extorquens, more toxic in Ps. putida, and non-toxic in Escherichia coli. Toxicity is due to the activity of the gene products in M. extorquens, and both expression and activity in Ps. putida. This is the first time that the genes encoding an active AMO have been expressed in a heterologous host.
TI  - Purification, properties, and sequence of glycerol trinitrate reductase from Agrobacterium radiobacter.
AB  - Glycerol trinitrate (GTN) reductase, which enables Agrobacterium radiobacter to utilize GTN and related explosives as sources of nitrogen for growth, was purified and characterized, and its gene was cloned and sequenced. The enzyme was a 39-kDa monomeric protein which catalyzed the NADH-dependent reductive scission of GTN (Km = 23 microM) to glycerol dinitrates (mainly the 1,3-isomer) with a pH optimum of 6.5, a temperature optimum of 35 degrees C, and no dependence on metal ions for activity. It was also active on pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN), on isosorbide dinitrate, and, very weakly, on ethyleneglycol dinitrate, but it was inactive on isopropyl nitrate, hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine, 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene, ammonium ions, nitrate, or nitrite. The amino acid sequence deduced from the DNA sequence was homologous (42 to 51% identity and 61 to 69% similarity) to those of PETN reductase from Enterobacter cloacae, N-ethylmaleimide reductase from Escherichia coli, morphinone reductase from Pseudomonas putida, and old yellow enzyme from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, placing the GTN reductase in the alpha/beta barrel flavoprotein group of proteins. GTN reductase and PETN reductase were very similar in many respects except in their distinct preferences for NADH and NADPH cofactors, respectively.
TI  - cis-trans isomerization of unsaturated fatty acids: cloning and sequencing of the cti gene from Pseudomonas putida P8.
AB  - Transposon mutants of Pseudomonas putida P8 were generated by applying a mini-Tn5 mutagenesis system. The mutants obtained were checked for their ability to tolerate increased temperatures and elevated phenol concentrations. Approximately 5,800 transposon mutants were used to generate a pool of 600 temperature-sensitive strains; one of these strains was identified as being damaged in its ability to perform cis-trans isomerization of fatty acids. A gene library of P. putida P8 was constructed and screened by using as a probe sequences immediately adjacent to the mini-Tn5 insertion. A DNA fragment that complemented the mutation was isolated and cloned. The corresponding gene, termed cti, is located close to the methionine synthase locus (metH) in P. putida P8. A cti-carrying fragment integrated into a plasmid also conferred the ability for cis-trans isomerization to Escherichia coli; the cti gene was completely sequenced, and the amino acid sequence was deduced.
TI  - Identification of adjacent genes encoding the major catalase and a bacterioferritin from the plant-beneficial bacterium Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - The catA gene, encoding the major CatA from a root-colonizing isolate Pseudomonas putida (Pp), was cloned by complementation into a catalase (Cat)-deficient Escherichia coli (Ec) strain UM2. The ORF for catA consisted of 479 aa with a higher degree of identity with typical Cat from eukaryotes than prokaryotes. Chromosomal homologous exchange with a mutant gene bearing an insertion of a luxAB-npt cassette into the SfiI site of catA generated a CatA-deficient Pp isolate. This mutant and another mutant, J1M, derived by EMS mutagenesis, were highly sensitive to hydrogen peroxide. CatA activity and resistance to hydrogen peroxide were restored in both mutants by catA. Adjacent to the 3' end of catA was a potential ORF of 462 nt that had high identitity with other bfr genes that encode iron-storage proteins. Northern analysis of the bfr gene from Pp revealed a transcript of approximately 500 nt. CatA and bfr probes hybridized to the same size restriction fragments in genomic DNAs from other root-colonizing and plant pathogenic pseudomonads. Thus, the genes for an iron-storage protein and the heme-containing Cat appear to be conserved in adjacent loci in certain pseudomonads.
TI  - Biochemical and genetic characterization of 2-carboxybenzaldehyde dehydrogenase,  an enzyme involved in phenanthrene degradation by Nocardioides sp. strain KP7.
AB  - 2-Carboxybenzaldehyde dehydrogenase from the phenanthrene-degrading bacterium Nocardioides sp. strain KP7 was purified and characterized. The purified enzyme had a molecular mass of 53 kDa by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and 205 kDa by gel filtration chromatography. Thus, the homotetramer of the 53-kDa subunit constituted an active enzyme. The apparent Km and kcat values of this enzyme for 2-carboxybenzaldehyde were 100 microM and 39 s(-1), respectively, and those for NAD+ were 83 microM and 32 s(-1), respectively. The structural gene for this enzyme was cloned and sequenced. The length of the gene was 1,455 bp. The nucleotide sequence of the 10,279 bp of DNA around the gene for 2-carboxybenzaldehyde dehydrogenase was also determined, and seven open reading frames were found in this DNA region. These were the genes for 1-hydroxy-2-naphthoate dioxygenase (phdI) and trans-2'-carboxybenzalpyruvate aldolase (phdJ), orf1, the gene for 2-carboxybenzaldehyde dehydrogenase (phdK), orf2/orf3, and orf4. The amino acid sequence of the orf1 product was similar to that of the aromatic hydrocarbon transporter gene (pcaK) in Pseudomonas putida PRS2000. The amino acid sequence of the orf4 product revealed a similarity to cytochrome P-450 proteins. The region between phdK and orf4 encoded orf2 and orf3 on different strands. The amino acid sequences of the orf2 and orf3 products exhibited no significant similarity to the reported sequences in protein databases.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence of the gene encoding cis-biphenyl dihydrodiol dehydrogenase (bphB) and the expression of an active recombinant His-tagged bphB gene product from a PCB degrading bacterium, Pseudomonas putida OU83.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of the bphB gene of Pseudomonas putida strain OU83 was determined. The bphB gene, which encodes cis-biphenyl dihydrodiol dehydrogenase (BDDH), was composed of 834 base pairs with an ATG initiation codon and a TGA termination codon. It can encode a polypeptide of 28.91 kDa, containing 277 amino acids. Promoter-like and ribosome-binding sequences were identified upstream of the bphB gene. The bphB nucleotide sequence was used to produce His-tagged BDDH, in Escherichia coli. The His-tagged BDDH construction, carrying a single 6 x His tail on the N-terminal portion, was active. The molecular mass of the native enzyme was 128 kDa and on SDS-PAGE analysis the molecular mass was 31 kDa. This enzyme requires NAD+ for its activity and its optimum pH is 8.5. Nucleotide and the deduced amino acid sequence analyses revealed a high degree of homology between the bphB gene from Pseudomonas putida OU83 and the bphB genes from P. cepacia LB400 and P. pseudoalcaligenes KF707.
TI  - Cloning of the phosphonoacetate hydrolase gene from Pseudomonas fluorescens 23F encoding a new type of carbon-phosphorus bond cleaving enzyme and its expression in Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - The phnA gene encoding a novel carbon-phosphorus bond cleavage enzyme, phosphonoacetate hydrolase, from Pseudomonas fluorescens 23F was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida. It conferred on the latter host the ability to mineralize phosphonoacetate but on the former the ability to utilize it as sole phosphorus source only. The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the phnA gene showed no significant homology with any data bank accessions.
TI  - Cloning and mutational analysis of the gene for the stationary-phase inducible catalase (catC) from Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - Pseudomonas putida, a bacterium that colonizes plant roots and enhances plant growth, produces three isozymes of catalase (A, B, and C) in stationary-phase cells. A catalase probe, generated by PCR analysis of P. putida genomic DNA with oligomers based on typical catalase sequences, hybridized to a genomic clone that expressed catalase C in Escherichia coli. The catC gene from this clone had a 2,133-bp open reading frame with a high level of identity to the stationary-phase-specific E. coli katE. Chromosomal mutants of P. putida deficient in catalase C, obtained by gene interruption with a luxAB-npt cassette, demonstrated enhanced catC transcription in stationary-phase cells and, upon exposure to phenol, in logarithmic-phase cells. The catalase C-deficient cells were not impaired in their ability to colonize roots of bean or wheat plants grown under sterile conditions.
TI  - PcaK, a high-affinity permease for the aromatic compounds 4-hydroxybenzoate and protocatechuate from Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - PcaK is a transporter and chemoreceptor protein from Pseudomonas putida that is encoded as part of the beta-ketoadipate pathway regulon for aromatic acid degradation. When expressed in Escherichia coli, PcaK was localized to the membrane and catalyzed the accumulation of two aromatic substrates, 4-hydroxybenzoate and protocatechuate, against a concentration gradient. Benzoate inhibited 4-hydroxybenzoate uptake but was not a substrate for PcaK-catalyzed transport. A P. putida pcaK mutant was defective in its ability to accumulate micromolar amounts of 4-hydroxybenzoate and protocatechuate. The mutant was also impaired in growth on millimolar concentrations of these aromatic acids. In contrast, the pcaK mutant grew at wild-type rates on benzoate. The Vmax for uptake of 4-hydroxybenzoate was at least 25 nmol/min/mg of protein, and the Km was 6 microM. PcaK-mediated transport is energized by the proton motive force. These results show that although aromatic acids in the undissociated (uncharged) form can diffuse across bacterial membranes, high-specificity active transport systems probably also contribute to the ability of bacteria to grow on the micromolar concentrations of these compounds that are typically present in soil. A variety of aromatic molecules, including naturally occurring lignin derivatives and xenobiotics, are metabolized by bacteria and may be substrates for transport proteins. The characterization of PcaK provides a foundation for understanding active transport as a critical step in the metabolism of aromatic carbon sources.
TI  - Cloning and analysis of the poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyhexanoate) biosynthesis genes of Aeromonas caviae.
AB  - A 5.0-kbp EcoRV-EcoRI restriction fragment was cloned and analyzed from genomic DNA of Aeromonas caviae, a bacterium producing a copolyester of (R)-3-hydroxybutyrate (3HB) and (R)-3-hydroxyhexanoate (3HHx) [P(3HB-co-3HHx)] from alkanoic acids or oils. The nucleotide sequence of this region showed a 1,782-bp poly (3-hydroxyalkanoate) (PHA) synthase gene (phaC(Ac) [i.e., the phaC gene from A. caviae]) together with four open reading frames (ORF1, -3, -4, and -5) and one putative promoter region. The cloned fragments could not only complement PHA-negative mutants of Alcaligenes eutrophus and Pseudomonas putida, but also confer the ability to synthesize P(3HB-co-3HHx) from octanoate or hexanoate on the mutants' hosts. Furthermore, coexpression of ORF1 and ORF3 genes with phaC(Ac) in the A. eutrophus mutant resulted in a decrease in the polyester content of the cells. Escherichia coli expressing ORF3 showed (R)-enoyl-coenzyme A (CoA) hydratase activity, suggesting that (R)-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA monomer units are supplied via the (R)-specific hydration of enoyl-CoA in A. caviae. The transconjugant of the A. eutrophus mutant expressing only phaC(Ac) effectively accumulated P(3HB-co-3HHx) up to 96 wt% of the cellular dry weight from octanoate in one-step cultivation.
TI  - Characteristics of Escherichia coli HB101 and Pseudomonas putida PpY101 harboring a recombinant plasmid with tandem insertion of the mercury resistance operon.
AB  - We constructed the plasmid pSUPmer2 by inserting tandem copies of the mercury resistance (mer) operon into a broad host range-vector, and introduced it into Escherichia coli HB101 and Pseudomonas putida PpY101 to increase their mercury resistance. Strains harboring plasmid pSUPmer2 had higher mercury resistance and mercuric reductase activity than those strains harboring the plasmid pSUPmer which had one copy of the mer operon. Mercury resistance of P. putida PpY101 was significantly increased by tandem insertion of the mer operon.
TI  - Rapid purification of an active recombinant His-tagged 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl 1,2-dioxygenase from Pseudomonas putida OU83.
AB  - 2,3-Dihydroxybiphenyl 1,2-dioxygenase (2,3-DBPD) is an extradiol-type dioxygenase that catalyzes the aromatic ring fission of 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl, the third step in the biphenyl degradation pathway. The nucleotide sequence of the Pseudomonas putida OU83 gene bphC, which encodes 2,3-DBPD, was cloned into a plasmid pQE31. The His-tagged 2,3-DBPD produced by a recombinant Escherichia coli strain, SG13009(pREP4)(pAKC1), and purified with a Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid resin affinity column using the His-bind Qiagen system. The His-tagged 2,3-DBPD construction, carrying a single 6 x His tail on the N-terminal of the polypeptide, was active. SDS-PAGE analysis of the purified active 2,3-DBPD gave a single band of 34 kDa; this is in agreement with the size of the bphC coding region. The K(m) for 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl was 14.5 +/- 2 microM. The enzyme activity was enhanced by ferrous ion but inhibited by ferric ion. The enzyme activity was inhibited by thiol-blocking reagents and heavy metals HgCl2, CuSO4, NiSO4, and CdCl2. The yield was much higher and the time required to purify recombinant 2,3-DBPD from clone pAKCl was faster than by the conventional chromatography procedures.
TI  - Fiber-optic-based biomonitoring of benzene derivatives by recombinant E. coli bearing luciferase gene-fused TOL-plasmid immobilized on the fiber-optic end.
AB  - TOL plasmid in Pseudomonas putida mt-2 has a series of genes for the degradation  of xylene, toluene, and their derivatives to pyruvate and acetaldehyde (or propionaldehyde). Two operons, i.e., upper operon and meta operon, play indispensable roles for the digestion of xylene derivatives: When XyIR protein recognizes xylene derivatives, another controlling gene, xyIS, is activated, which results in the activation of meta operon. Therefore, we have constructed a fusion gene between TOL plasmid and the firefly luciferase gene under the control of XyIR and the promoter of xyIS gene; i.e., by using fusions of the meta operon with promotorless luciferase expression vector from firefly, we have constructed and tested biomonitors for benzene derivatives. Bioluminescence specified by Escherichia coli (pTSN316), carrying xyIR and xyIS promoters, Ampr and luc, was measured in either a benzene derivative-saturated or o-methylbenzyl alcohol-dissolved medium both in the case of cell suspension and in the case of immobilized cell form. The utility of the biosensing system for monitoring in chemical plant drainage was demonstrated with samples supplemented with benzene derivatives. The xyIR-xyIS promoter-lux fusion carried by pTSN316 responded to a benzene-related chemical in sample solutions. Immobilization of the transformed E. coli, at one end of fiber optic, bearing firefly luciferase gene fused to TOL plasmid, has been demonstrated to fabricate a luminescent remote biomonitoring device for the protection of environmental deterioration. Due to the luminescent detection, the detection limits for benzene-related aromatics that are recognized by a binding protein (XyIR) were parts-per-million. We had already submitted a preliminary report concerning the possibility of environmental monitoring based on the above idea by using the transformed E. coli in a cell-suspended solution. This paper describes mainly a fiber-optic-based biomonitoring device for the protection of environmental deterioration.
TI  - Bacterial DL-2-haloacid dehalogenase from Pseudomonas sp. strain 113: gene cloning and structural comparison with D- and L-2-haloacid dehalogenases.
AB  - DL-2-Haloacid dehalogenase from Pseudomonas sp. strain 113 (DL-DEX) catalyzes the hydrolytic dehalogenation of both D- and L-2-haloalkanoic acids to produce the corresponding L- and D-2-hydroxyalkanoic acids, respectively, with inversion of the C2 configuration. DL-DEX is a unique enzyme: it acts on the chiral carbon of the substrate and uses both enantiomers as equivalent substrates. We have isolated and sequenced the gene encoding DL-DEX. The open reading frame consists of 921 bp corresponding to 307 amino acid residues. No sequence similarity between DL-DEX and L-2-haloacid dehalogenases was found. However, DL-DEX had significant sequence similarity with D-2-haloacid dehalogenase from Pseudomonas putida AJ1, which specifically acts on D-2-haloalkanoic acids: 23% of the total amino acid residues of DL-DEX are conserved. We mutated each of the 26 residues with charged and polar side chains, which are conserved between DL-DEX and D-2-haloacid dehalogenase. Thr65, Glu69, and Asp194 were found to be essential for dehalogenation of not only the D- but also the L-enantiomer of 2-haloalkanoic acids. Each of the mutant enzymes, whose activities were lower than that of the wild-type enzyme, acted on both enantiomers of 2-haloacids as equivalent substrates in the same manner as the wild-type enzyme. We also found that each enantiomer of 2-chloropropionate competitively inhibits the enzymatic dehalogenation of the other. These results suggest that DL-DEX has a single and common catalytic site for both enantiomers.
TI  - DNase I footprinting, DNA bending and in vitro transcription analyses of ClcR and CatR interactions with the clcABD promoter: evidence of a conserved transcriptional activation mechanism.
AB  - In Pseudomonas putida, benzoate and 3-chlorobenzoate are converted to catechol and 3-chlorocatechol, respectively, which are then catabolized to tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates via the catBCA and clcABD pathways. The catBCA and clcABD operons are regulated by homologous transcriptional activators CatR and ClcR. Previous studies have demonstrated that in addition to sequence similarities, CatR and ClcR share functional similarities which allow catR to complement clcR. In this study, we demonstrate that CatR activates the clcABD promoter in vitro without inducer, but more transcript is produced when inducer is added. DNase I footprinting and DNA-bending analyses demonstrate that CatR binds to and bends the clcABD promoter to the same angle as does ClcR plus its inducer, 2-chloromuconate. This implies that CatR binds to the clc promoter in its active conformation. Transcription of the clcABD promoter by the alpha-subunit truncation mutant (alpha-235) of RNA polymerase was sharply reduced, indicating that the alpha-subunit C-terminal domain is important. However, a small amount of transcript was produced under these conditions, indicating that other contact sites on the RNA polymerase may play a role in activation.
TI  - Modulation of gene expression through chromosomal positioning in Escherichia coli.
AB  - Variations in expression of the nah genes of the NAH7 (naphthalene biodegradation) plasmid of Pseudomonas putida when placed in different chromosomal locations in Escherichia coli have been studied by employing a collection of hybrid mini-T5 transposons bearing lacZ fusions to the Psal promoter, along with the cognate regulatory gene nahR. Insertions of Psal-lacZ reporters in the proximity of the chromosomal origin of replication, oriC, increased accumulation of beta-galactosidase in vivo. Position-dependent changes in expression of the reporter product could not be associated with local variations of the supercoiling in the DNA region, as revealed by probing the chromosome with mobile gyrB-lacZ elements. Such variations in beta-galactosidase activity (and, therefore, the expression of catabolic genes) seemed, instead, to be linked to the increase in gene dosage associated with regions close to oriC, and not to local variations in chromosome structure. The tolerance of strains to the selection markers borne by the transposons also varied in parallel with the changes in LacZ levels. The role of chromosomal positioning as a mechanism for the outcome of adaptation phenotypes is discussed.
TI  - Molecular characterization of the mde operon involved in L-methionine catabolism  of Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - A 15-kb region of Pseudomonas putida chromosomal DNA containing the mde operon and an upstream regulatory gene (mdeR) has been cloned and sequenced. The mde operon contains two structural genes involved in L-methionine degradative metabolism: the already-identified mdeA, which encodes L-methionine gamma-lyase (H. Inoue, K. Inagaki, M. Sugimoto, N. Esaki, K. Soda, and H. Tanaka. J. Biochem. (Tokyo) 117:1120-1125, 1995), and mdeB, which encodes a homologous protein to the homodimeric-type E1 component of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. A rho-independent terminator was present just downstream of mdeB, and open reading frames corresponding to other components of alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase complex were not found. When MdeB was overproduced in Escherichia coli, the cell extract showed the E1 activity with high specificity for alpha-ketobutyrate rather than pyruvate. These results suggest that MdeB plays an important role in the metabolism of alpha-ketobutyrate produced by MdeA from L-methionine. Accordingly, mdeB encodes a novel E1 component, alpha-ketobutyrate dehydrogenase E1 component, of an unknown alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase complex in P. putida. In addition, we found that the mdeR gene was located on the opposite strand and began at 127 bp from the translational start site of mdeA. The mdeR gene product has been identified as a member of the leucine-responsive regulatory protein (Lrp) family and revealed to act as an essential positive regulator allowing the expression of the mdeAB operon.
TI  - Conjugative plasmids and the degradation of arylsulfonates in Comamonas testosteroni.
AB  - Comamonas testosteroni T-2 degrades p-toluenesulfonate (TSA) via p-sulfobenzoate  (PSB) and protocatechuate and degrades toluenecarboxylate via terephthalate (TER) and protocatechuate. The appropriate genes are expressed in at least five regulatory units, some of which are also found in C. testosteroni PSB-4 (F. Junker, R. Kiewitz, and A. M. Cook, J. Bacteriol. 179:919-927, 1997). C. testosteroni T-2 was found to contain two plasmids, pTSA (85 kbp) and pT2T (50 kbp); a TSA- mutant (strain TER-1) contained only plasmid pT2T. C. testosteroni PSB-4, which does not degrade TSA, contained one plasmid, pPSB (85 kbp). The type strain contained no plasmids. Conjugation experiments showed that plasmid pTSA (possibly in conjunction with pT2T) was conjugative, and the single copy of the TSA operon (tsaMBCD) with its putative regulator gene (tsaR) in strain T-2 was found on plasmid pTSA, which also carried the PSB genes (psbAC) and presumably transport for both substrates. Plasmid pTSA was assigned to the IncP1 beta group and was found to carry two copies of insertion element IS1071. Plasmid pPSB (of strain PSB-4), which could be maintained in strains with plasmid pTSA or pT2T, was also conjugative and was found to carry the PSB genes as well as to contain two copies of IS1071. In attempted conjugations with the type strain, no plasmid was recovered, but the PSB+ transconjugant carried two copies of IS1071 in the chromosome. We presume the PSB genes to be located in a composite transposon. The genes encoding the putative TER operon and degradation of protocatechuate, with the meta cleavage pathway, were attributed a chromosomal location in strains T-2 and PSB-4.
TI  - Evidence for the bacterial origin of genes encoding fermentation enzymes of the amitochondriate protozoan parasite Entamoeba histolytica.
AB  - Entamoeba histolytica is an amitochondriate protozoan parasite with numerous bacterium-like fermentation enzymes including the pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (POR), ferredoxin (FD), and alcohol dehydrogenase E (ADHE). The goal of this study was to determine whether the genes encoding these cytosolic E. histolytica fermentation enzymes might derive from a bacterium by horizontal transfer, as has previously been suggested for E. histolytica genes encoding heat shock protein 60, nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase, and superoxide dismutase. In this study, the E. histolytica por gene and the adhE gene of a second amitochondriate protozoan parasite, Giardia lamblia, were sequenced, and their phylogenetic positions were estimated in relation to POR, ADHE, and FD cloned from eukaryotic and eubacterial organisms. The E. histolytica por gene encodes a 1,620-amino-acid peptide that contained conserved iron-sulfur- and thiamine pyrophosphate-binding sites. The predicted E. histolytica POR showed fewer positional identities to the POR of G. lamblia (34%) than to the POR of the enterobacterium Klebsiella pneumoniae (49%), the cyanobacterium Anabaena sp. (44%), and the protozoan Trichomonas vaginalis (46%), which targets its POR to anaerobic organelles called hydrogenosomes. Maximum-likelihood, neighbor-joining, and parsimony analyses also suggested as less likely E. histolytica POR sharing more recent common ancestry with G. lamblia POR than with POR of bacteria and the T. vaginalis hydrogenosome. The G. lamblia adhE encodes an 888-amino-acid fusion peptide with an aldehyde dehydrogenase at its amino half and an iron-dependent (class 3) ADH at its carboxy half. The predicted G. lamblia ADHE showed extensive positional identities to ADHE of Escherichia coli (49%), Clostridium acetobutylicum (44%), and E. histolytica (43%) and lesser identities to the class 3 ADH of eubacteria and yeast (19 to 36%). Phylogenetic analyses inferred a closer relationship of the E. histolytica ADHE to bacterial ADHE than to the G. lamblia ADHE. The 6-kDa FD of E. histolytica and G. lamblia were most similar to those of the archaebacterium Methanosarcina barkeri and the delta-purple bacterium Desulfovibrio desulfuricans, respectively, while the 12-kDa FD of the T. vaginalis hydrogenosome was most similar to the 12-kDa FD of gamma-purple bacterium Pseudomonas putida. E. histolytica genes (and probably G. lamblia genes) encoding fermentation enzymes therefore likely derive from bacteria by horizontal transfer, although it is not clear from which bacteria these amebic genes derive. These are the first nonorganellar fermentation enzymes of eukaryotes implicated to have derived from bacteria.
TI  - Surface signaling: novel transcription initiation mechanism starting from the cell surface.
AB  - Transcription of the ferric citrate transport genes of Escherichia coli is induced by a novel mechanism. Ferric citrate, the inducer, does not have to enter the cytoplasm to initiate transcription. Interaction of ferric citrate with the outer membrane receptor protein FecA induces transcription of the fec transport gene operon consisting of the fecIRABCDE genes. A signal from FecA occupied with ferric citrate is transmitted across the outer membrane into the periplasm with the help of the electrochemical potential of the cytoplasmic membrane and the Ton system. The signal is then transduced across the cytoplasmic membrane by the FecR protein, which in turn activates the FecI sigma-factor that directs the RNA polymerase core-enzyme to the fec transport gene promoter. The promoter of the regulatory genes fecI and fecR is not controlled by ferric citrate but is regulated by iron via the Fur repressor. It is proposed that the information flux from the cell surface to the cytoplasm involves a series of conformational changes of the proteins FecA, FecR, and FecI in that order. The level of the regulatory proteins FecI and FecR is adjusted to the intracellular iron concentration and determines the degree of the response of the cell to ferric citrate in the medium. Ferric citrate induces transcription of the fec transport genes under iron-limiting conditions. A regulatory device similar to the ferric citrate transport system exists in Pseudomonas putida WCS358. The synthesis of the outer membrane receptor PupB, involved in the transport of the ferric pseudobactins BN7 and BN8, is induced by the ferric siderophores and requires PupB and two proteins homologous to FecI and FecR.
TI  - Structure of catechol 2,3-dioxygenase gene encoded in TOM plasmid of Pseudomonas  cepacia G4.
AB  - The catechol 2,3-dioxygenase is an extradiol-type dioxygenase which cleaves the C-C bond at the meta position of catechol to form 2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde. A catechol 2,3-dioxygenase gene (tomB) in the TOM plasmid of P. cepacia G4 has been cloned and its nucleotide sequence was analyzed. The enzyme gene consisted of 945 base pairs with an ATG initiation codon and a TGA termination codon which can encode a polypeptide of molecular weight 35 kDa containing 314 amino acid residues, and a putative ribosome-binding sequence was identified at approximately 10 nucleotides upstream of the initiation codon. The deduced amino acid sequence of catechol 2,3-dioxygenase from P. cepacia G4 exhibited 79-82% homologies with those of 3-methylcatechol 2,3-dioxygenase of P. putida UCC2 and catechol 2,3-dioxygenase of P. pickettii PKO1.
TI  - Studies on spontaneous promoter-up mutations in the transcriptional activator-encoding gene phIR and their effects on the degradation of phenol in Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - The activator-encoding gene phlR was identified upstream of the plasmid-encoded operon for phenol degradation in Pseudomonas putida strain H by cassette mutagenesis and DNA sequence analysis. The deduced amino acid sequence of PHLR shows high homology to DmpR of P. putida sp. CF600 and to the chromosomally encoded PhhR of P. putida P35X reported previously. Trans-activation of phenol degradation was observed when phlR was overexpressed in a phlR insertion mutant. Transconjugants of Escherichia coli carrying pPGH11, which contains the complete set of phl genes, are unable to grow on phenol as carbon source. However, two types of mutants were selected for further characterization that were able to metabolize phenol as sole source of carbon and energy. In both types of mutants enhanced expression of phlR is responsible for the Phl+ phenotype. In type I (pPGH13) a deletion of 1 bp made the -35 region and the spacing between the -35 and -10 regions of the phlR promoter more similar to the consensus structure. In type II (pPGH14) a duplication of the phlR 5' region was identified that includes part of the -35 motif and reduces the spacing between the -35 and -10 regions. In addition, due to the duplication of part of phlR, the distance from the phlR promoter to the catabolic phl operon is increased. Different transcriptional start sites have been identified by primer extension analysis in clones harboring pPGH14 or the wild type phlR. Quantitative primer extension analysis revealed that the greatest amount of phlR transcript is expressed from the partial, phlR duplication. Growth on phenol and phenol hydroxylase activity reflect the high level of phlR transcript in E. coli transconjugants. Overexpression of PhlR was also observed when pPGH14 was transferred into P. putida, and results in earlier induction of the phenol degradation operon relative to the wild-type strain.
TI  - Manure Enhances Plasmid Mobilization and Survival of Pseudomonas putida Introduced into Field Soil.
AB  - We report a field study on plasmid mobilization in an agricultural soil. The influence of pig manure on the mobilization of the IncQ plasmid pIE723 by indigenous plasmids or by the IncP(alpha) plasmid pGP527 into the recipient Pseudomonas putida UWC1 (Rif(supr) Nal(supr)) was studied in field soil. Six plots were prepared in duplicate, three of which were treated with manure prior to inoculation of the donor and recipient strains. As a donor strain, either Escherichia coli J53(pIE723) or E. coli 600(pIE723, pGP527) was used. Putative transconjugants obtained on a selective medium were confirmed by DNA hybridization and PCR. Plasmid mobilization by indigenous mobilizing plasmids was observed on two occasions in manured soil. Manuring of soil significantly enhanced the frequency of pIE723 mobilization by pGP527, since mobilization frequencies into P. putida UWC1 were at least 10-fold higher in manured soil than in nonmanured soil. Enhanced numbers of P. putida UWC1 transconjugant and recipient colonies could be observed in manured soil throughout the 79-day field test. Transfer of pIE723 or pG527 into indigenous soil or rhizosphere bacteria could not be detected when indigenous bacteria isolated by selective cultivation were screened for the presence of these plasmids by DNA hybridization. Furthermore, the presence of IncN-, IncP-, or IncQ-specific sequences was confirmed in total community DNA extracted directly from the manured or nonmanured soil by PCR. IncW plasmids were detectable only in manured soil, indicating entry of these plasmids into soil via manure.
TI  - Metabolism of Chlorotoluenes by Burkholderia sp. Strain PS12 and Toluene Dioxygenase of Pseudomonas putida F1: Evidence for Monooxygenation by Toluene and Chlorobenzene Dioxygenases.
AB  - The degradation of toluene by Pseudomonas putida F1 and of chlorobenzenes by Burkholderia sp. strain PS12 is initiated by incorporation of dioxygen into the aromatic nucleus to form cis-dihydrodihydroxybenzenes. Toluene-grown cells of P. putida F1 and 3-chlorobenzoate-grown cells of Burkholderia sp. strain PS12 were found to monooxygenate the side chain of 2- and 3-chlorotoluene to the corresponding chlorobenzyl alcohols. Further metabolism of these products was slow, and the corresponding chlorobenzoates were usually observed as end products, whereas the 3-chlorobenzoate produced from 3-chlorotoluene in Burkholderia sp. strain PS12 was metabolized further. Escherichia coli cells containing the toluene dioxygenase genes from P. putida F1 oxidized 2- and 3-chlorotoluene to the corresponding chlorobenzyl alcohols as major products, demonstrating that this enzyme is responsible for the observed side chain monooxygenation. Two methyl- and chloro-substituted 1,2-dihydroxycyclohexadienes were formed as minor products from 2- and 3-chlorotoluene, whereas a chloro- and methyl-substituted cyclohexadiene was the only product formed from 4-chlorotoluene. The toluene dioxygenase of P. putida F1 and chlorobenzene dioxygenase from Burkholderia sp. strain PS12 are the first enzymes described that efficiently catalyze the oxidation of 2-chlorotoluene.
TI  - Production of substituted naphthalene dihydrodiols by engineered Escherichia coli containing the cloned naphthalene 1,2-dioxygenase gene from Pseudomonas fluorescens N3.
AB  - Naphthalene dioxygenase, a key enzyme in the dihydroxylation of naphthalene, is encoded by the plasmid pN3, responsible for naphthalene metabolism in Pseudomonas fluorescens N3. The naphthalene dioxygenase, including all the sequences for its expression and the regulatory region, has been localized on the 4.3-kb HindIII-ClaI fragment and on the 3.5-kb HindIII fragment of the plasmid pN3, by Southern analysis using as probes nahA and nahR genes, the homologous genes of the plasmid NAH7 from Pseudomonas putida G7. We cloned in Escherichia coli JM109 the dioxygenase gene and its regulatory region and developed an efficient bacterial system inducible by salicylic acid, able to produce dihydrodiols. E. coli containing recombinant plasmids carrying the dioxygenase gene were analysed for their potential as a biocatalytic tool to produce dihydrodiols from different naphthalenes with the substituent on the aromatic ring at the alpha or beta position. The dihydrodiols, identified by HPLC (high-performance liquid chromatography) and 1H-NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) were produced with yields ranging from 50 to 94%. The degree of bioconversion efficiency depends on the nature and the position of the substituent and indicates the broad substrate specificity of this dioxygenase and its potential for the production of a wide variety of fine chemicals.
TI  - Construction of a contiguous 874-kb sequence of the Escherichia coli -K12 genome  corresponding to 50.0-68.8 min on the linkage map and analysis of its sequence features.
AB  - The contiguous 874.423 base pair sequence corresponding to the 50.0-68.8 min region on the genetic map of the Escherichia coli K-12 (W3110) was constructed by the determination of DNA sequences in the 50.0-57.9 min region (360 kb) and two large (100 kb in all) and five short gaps in the 57.9-68.8 min region whose sequences had been registered in the DNA databases. We analyzed its sequence features and found that this region contained at least 894 potential open reading frames (ORFs), of which 346 (38.7%) were previously reported, 158 (17.7%) were homologous to other known genes, 232 (26.0%) were identical or similar to hypothetical genes registered in databases, and the remaining 158 (17.7%) showed no significant similarity to any other genes. A homology search of the ORFs also identified several new gene clusters. Those include two clusters of fimbrial genes, a gene cluster of three genes encoding homologues of the human long chain fatty acid degradation enzyme complex in the mitochondrial membrane, a cluster of at least nine genes involved in the utilization of ethanolamine, a cluster of the secondary set of 11 hyc genes participating in the formate hydrogenlyase reaction and a cluster of five genes coding for the homologues of degradation enzymes for aromatic hydrocarbons in Pseudomonas putida. We also noted a variety of novel genes, including two ORFs, which were homologous to the putative genes encoding xanthine dehydrogenase in the fly and a protein responsible for axonal guidance and outgrowth of the rat, mouse and nematode. An isoleucine tRNA gene, designated ileY, was also newly identified at 60.0 min.
TI  - Description of a novel plasmid replicative origin from a genetically distinct family of conjugative plasmids associated with phytosphere microflora.
AB  - A novel replicative origin (oriV) from a conjugative, mercury resistance plasmid  (pQBR11, 304 kbp) has been cloned and sequenced. Homology to the pQBR11 oriV-containing 3.55 kbp BamHI fragment (pCV1200) was restricted to one of five genetically distinct classes (group I) of narrow host range, mega-plasmids that persist as a genetic component of the pseudomonad community indigenous to the microflora of sugar beet. The oriV of pQBR11 was located within a unique sequence of 300 bp which initiated the replication of pUC derived suicide vectors in Pseudomonas putida UWC1. The limited size of the DNA sequence required to initiate replication, and the presence of two 15/16 bp directly repeated motifs, indicate that this group of mega-plasmids contain a single origin of replication, which initiates replication via a host-polymerase dependent rolling circle mechanism.
TI  - Coactivation in vitro of the sigma54-dependent promoter Pu of the TOL plasmid of  Pseudomonas putida by HU and the mammalian HMG-1 protein.
AB  - The mechanism by which the prokaryotic histone-like protein HU replaces the integration host factor (IHF) in the coactivation of the sigma54-dependent promoter Pu of Pseudomonas putida has been investigated. By using a preactivated form of the cognate activator protein XylR, we show that the functional replacement of IHF with HU previously suggested in vivo can be faithfully reproduced in vitro with purified components. Furthermore, the coactivation effect of IHF on Pu could be mimicked not only by HU but also by the mammalian nonhistone chromatin protein HMG-1 and could be bypassed by intrinsically curved DNA. These results suggest that either of two different mechanisms (generation of a site-specific static DNA bend or a general flexibilization of the promoter region) gives rise to the same structural effect of stimulating transcription from Pu through changes in promoter architecture.
TI  - Genetic characterization and expression in heterologous hosts of the 3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)propionate catabolic pathway of Escherichia coli K-12.
AB  - We report the complete nucleotide sequence of the gene cluster encoding the 3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)propionate (3-HPP) catabolic pathway of Escherichia coli K-12. Sequence analysis revealed the existence of eight genes that map at min 8 of the chromosome, between the lac and hemB regions. Six enzyme-encoding genes account for a flavin-type monooxygenase (mhpA), the extradiol dioxygenase (mhpB), and the meta-cleavage pathway (mhpCDFE). The order of these catabolic genes, with the sole exception of mhpF, parallels that of the enzymatic steps of the pathway. The mhpF gene may encode the terminal acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (acylating) not reported previously in the proposed pathway. Enzymes that catalyze the early reactions of the pathway, MhpA and MhpB, showed the lowest level of sequence similarity to analogous enzymes of other aromatic catabolic pathways. However, the genes mhpCDFE present the same organization and appear to be homologous to the Pseudomonas xyl, dmp, and nah meta-pathway genes, supporting the hypothesis of the modular evolution of catabolic pathways and becoming the first example of this type of catabolic module outside the genus Pseudomonas. Two bacterial interspersed mosaic elements were found downstream of the mhpABCDFE locus and flank a gene, orfT, which encodes a protein related to the superfamily of transmembrane facilitators that might be associated with transport. All of the genes of the 3-HPP cluster are transcribed in the same direction, with the sole exception of mhpR. Inducible expression of the mhp catabolic genes depends upon the presence, in the cis or trans position, of a functional mhpR gene, which suggests that the mhpR gene product is the activator of the 3-HPP biodegradative pathway. The primary structure of MhpR revealed significant similarities to that of members of the IclR subfamily of transcriptional regulators. A 3-HPP catabolic DNA cassette was engineered and shown to be functional not only in enteric bacteria (E. coli and Salmonella typhimurium) but also in Pseudomonas putida and Rhizobium meliloti, thus facilitating its potential application to improve the catabolic abilities of bacterial strains for degradation of aromatic compounds.
TI  - Promoter-creating mutations in Pseudomonas putida: a model system for the study of mutation in starving bacteria.
AB  - A novel experimental system to study mutation in starving bacteria was designed,  relying on the activation of a promoterless phenol degradation operon of Pseudomonas putida. The Phe+ (phenol-utilizing) mutants accumulated in the starving culture of P. putida in the presence of phenol but not in the absence of it. We ruled out the possibility that the absence of phenol eliminates Phe+ mutants from the starving population. Sequence analysis of the Phe+ mutants revealed that base substitutions, deletions, and insertion of Tn4652 can result in creation of a sequence similar to the sigma70-specific promoter consensus. One particular C --> A transversion was predominant in the Phe+ mutants that arose in the starving population under selection for phenol use. In contrast, various deletions were the most frequent Phe+ mutants occurring in a culture growing without selection. The accumulation rate of the Phe+ mutants on selective plates was found to be higher for bacteria plated from stationary-phase culture than that from exponentially growing cells. This suggests that some specific processes, occurring predominantly in stationary-phase cells, facilitate generation and/or fixation of such mutations.
TI  - Activation of the catBCA promoter: probing the interaction of CatR and RNA polymerase through in vitro transcription.
AB  - The soil bacterium Pseudomonas putida is capable of degrading many aromatic compounds, including benzoate, through catechol as an intermediate. The catabolism of catechol is mediated by the catBCA operon, whose induction requires the pathway intermediate cis,cis-muconate as an inducer and the regulatory protein, CatR. CatR also regulates the plasmid-borne pheBA operon of P. putida PaW85, which is involved in phenol catabolism. We have used an in vitro transcription system to study the roles of CatR, cis,cis-muconate, Escherichia coli RNA polymerase, and promoter sequences in expression of the cat and phe operons. The assay confirmed the requirement of both CatR and cis,cis-muconate for transcript formation. We also examined the in vitro transcription of three site-directed mutants of the catBCA promoter; the results obtained compared favorably with previous in vivo data. The requirement of the alpha subunit of RNA polymerase for expression of the catBCA and the pheBA transcripts was also examined. The C-terminal region of the alpha subunit of RNA polymerase has been implicated in direct protein-protein contact with transcriptional regulatory proteins and/or direct contact with the DNA. We show that the carboxyl terminus of the alpha subunit is required for the expression of the catBCA and the pheBA operons because RNA polymerases with truncated alpha subunits were deficient in activation. Further experiments demonstrated the arginine at position 265 and the asparagine at position 268 of the alpha subunit as possible amino acids involved in activation. On the basis of these and previous results, we propose a model to explain the interaction of the different regulatory components leading to CatR-dependent activation of the catBCA operon.
TI  - Probing of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas aureofaciens, Burkholderia (Pseudomonas) cepacia, Pseudomonas fluorescens, and Pseudomonas putida with the ferripyochelin receptor A gene and the synthesis of pyochelin in Pseudomonas aureofaciens, Pseudomonas fluorescens, and Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - The ferripyochelin receptor A (fptA) gene codes for the transport of the ferrisiderophore ferripyochelin in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. A P. aeruginosa fptA internal fragment was used to probe chromosomal DNA from P. aureofaciens, B. cepacia, P. fluorescens, P. putida, and five strains of P.aeruginosa. These bacteria all contained DNA that hybridized to the fptA fragment. Four of the five P. aeruginosa strains displayed marked and identical patterns, indicating a high degree of sequence similarities among these strains. DNA from the non-P. aeruginosa bacteria, in contrast, hybridized less to the fptA fragment. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and B. cepacia synthesize pyochelin. Experiments were performed to confirm P. fluorescens pyochelin synthesis and to determine if pyochelin, cepabactin or salicylic acid were made by P. aureofaciens, P. putida, and P. fluorescens. Only pyochelin was isolated and identified from P. fluorescens. P. aureofaciens and P. putida produced none of these compounds. While all of these bacteria contain chromosomal DNA that hybridized to the fptA fragment probe, pyochelin synthesis did not occur in all, indicating that fptA fragment hybridization cannot always be correlated with pyochelin biosynthesis.
TI  - Mobility of norbornane-type substrates and water accessibility in cytochrome P-450cam.
AB  - The behaviour of norbornane-type substrates bound to oxidised cytochrome P-450cam (CYP 101) in 60% (w/w) glycerol-containing phosphate buffer was investigated using electronic absorption spectroscopy. The high-pressure dependence study revealed that the value of the spin-state reaction-volume change decreased from -70 to -22.8 cm3/mol with decreasing high-spin state content from 99 to 63%. Simultaneously, the values for the enthalpy and entropy determined from the low-temperature dependence of the spin-state transition decreased from 73.7 to 24.3 kJ/mol and from 310.4 to 88.9 J/mol K, respectively. Under our experimental conditions the pH-value of the buffer remained at low temperatures and high pressures in the range of pH 7-8, in which no pH-value-induced spin-state conversion occurred. Therefore, the secondary effect of the temperature and pressure-induced pH change can be disregarded as being responsible for the observed spin-state transition effects. Substrate dissociation constants were determined. From the temperature-jump experiments (297 K to 180 K) we found a higher mobility in the active site for the substrates in the sequence (1R)-camphor, (1S)-camphor, camphane, (1R)- and (1S)-camphorquinone, norcamphor, and norbornane. Our findings can be explained by the incomplete fit of the methyl groups of the norbornane-type substrate to the protein, in particular to the I-helix, predominantly determining the substrate mobility and water accessibility to the protein.
TI  - Genetic evidence of separate repressor and activator activities of the XylR regulator of the TOL plasmid, pWW0, of Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - The XylR protein encoded by pWW0, the TOL (toluene biodegradation) plasmid of Pseudomonas putida, activates at a distance the transcription of Pu and Ps, which are the two sigma(54)-dependent promoters of the plasmid, but it also downregulates its own sigma(70)-promoter, Pr, which divergently overlaps the upstream activating sites of Ps. All regulatory elements that control Pr activity have been faithfully reproduced in Escherichia coli, and the basis of the autoregulation of XylR transcription has been examined by monitoring the activity in vivo of different combinations of mutant proteins and promoters in rpoN+ and rpoN-genetic backgrounds. By using Ps/Pr regions bearing deleted or offset binding sites for XylR and the sigma(54)-containing RNA polymerase, we could show that formation of a nucleoprotein complex involving the polymerase bound to the divergent promoter Ps is not required for downregulation of Pr. Mutant XylR proteins, G268N and A311V (mutated within the NTP-binding region of XylR) or R453H (affected in multimerization), which are unable to activate sigma(54)-dependent transcription from Ps, were indistinguishable from the wild-type XylR in their ability to repress a reporter Pr-lacZ fusion. Autoregulation of XylR is therefore due exclusively to the binding of the protein to its target sites at the Pr promoter. This allows one to define sensu stricto XylR as a transcriptional repressor, independently of its activator role in other promoters.
TI  - Heterologous expression of biphenyl dioxygenase-encoding genes from a gram-positive broad-spectrum polychlorinated biphenyl degrader and characterization of chlorobiphenyl oxidation by the gene products.
AB  - The bphA1A2A3A4 gene cluster, encoding a biphenyl dioxygenase from Rhodococcus globerulus P6, a gram-positive microorganism able to degrade a wide spectrum of polychlorobiphenyls (PCBs), was expressed in Pseudomonas putida, thereby allowing characterization of chlorobiphenyl oxidation by this enzyme. While P6 biphenyl dioxygenase activity was observed in P. putida containing bphA1A2A3A4, no activity was detected in Escherichia coli cells containing the same gene cluster. In E. coli, transcription of genes bphB and bphCl, located downstream of bphA1A2A3A4, was shown to be driven solely by a vector promoter, which indicated that the lack of biphenyl dioxygenase activity was not due to a lack of mRNA synthesis. Radioactive labelling of bph gene products in E. coli implied inefficient translation of the bphA gene cluster or rapid degradation of the gene products. The biosynthesis of functional P6 biphenyl dioxygenase in P. putida cells containing the same plasmid construct that yielded no activity in E. coli emphasizes the importance of the host strain for heterologous expression and shows that synthesis, correct folding, and assembly of a Rhodococcus biphenyl dioxygenase can be achieved in a gram-negative organism. Dioxygenation of six mono- and dichlorinated PCB congeners by P. putida containing the P6 bphA gene cluster indicates the following ring substitution preference for this reaction (from most to least preferred): un-, meta-, para-, and ortho-substitution. No indications were found for dioxygenation of meta/para carbon pairs, or for hydroxylation of chlorinated carbons at any position of a monochlorinated ring, suggesting a strict specificity of this biphenyl dioxygenase for attack at nonhalogenated ortho/meta vicinal carbons. This contrasts the properties of an analogous enzyme from Pseudomonas sp. strain LB400, which can both dioxygenate at meta and para positions and dehalogenate substituted ortho carbons during ortho and meta dioxygenation.
TI  - Overexpression and large-scale production of recombinant L-methionine-alpha-deamino-gamma-mercaptomethane-lyase for novel anticancer therapy.
AB  - The goal of the next generation of cancer chemotherapy is effective tumor-selectivity. A tumor-selective target with high therapeutic potential is the elevated methionine requirement of tumor cells relative to normal cells. We have termed the elevated requirement for methionine in tumors methionine dependence. To selectively target the methionine dependence of tumors for treatment on a large-scale preclinical and clinical basis, the L-methionine alpha-deamino-gamma-mercaptomethane-lyase (methioninase, METase) gene from Pseudomonas putida has been cloned in Escherichia coli using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The METase gene was then ligated into the pT7-7 overexpression plasmid containing the T7 RNA polymerase promoter and recloned in E. coli strain BL21(DE3). The pAC-1 clone was isolated by its yellow-orange color which is due to high enrichment of the pyridoxal phosphate-containing recombinant methioninase (rMETase) and distinguished rMETase-overproducer from rMETase-negative colonies. A scale-up production protocol which contained a heat step, two DEAE Sepharose FF ion-exchange, and one ActiClean Etox endotoxin-affinity chromatography columns has been established. The pAC-1 clone produces rMETase at approximately 10% of the total soluble protein and up to 1 g/liter in shake-flask culture. The protocol can produce therapeutic rMETase at the multi-gram level per batch with high yield (> 60%), high purity (> 98%), high stability, and low endotoxin. Purified rMETase is stable to lyophilization. The t1/2 of rMETase was 2 h when rMETase was administered by i.v. injection in mice. Studies of the antitumor efficacy of rMETase in vitro and in vivo on human tumors xenografted in nude mice demonstrated that all types of human tumors tested including those from lung, colon, kidney, brain, prostate, and melanoma were sensitive to rMETase. In contrast, normal cells were insensitive to rMETase in vitro and correspondingly, no toxicity was detected in vivo at the effective doses. In conclusion, the overexpression clone and large-scale production protocols for rMETase have enabled rMETase to be used as a tumor-selective therapeutic with broad indication and high promise for effective, low-toxicity human cancer therapy.
TI  - Tn5 tagging of the phenol-degrading gene on the chromosome of Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - Transposon mutagenesis was performed by the method of conjugational transfer in order to identify and characterize genes encoding enzymes involved in the pathway of phenol utilization as a carbon source. Escherichia coli, which carries the Tn5-132, Was mated with Pseudomonas putida SM25 as a host. We selected a mutant that could not utilize phenol as a carbon source. Chromosomal integration of the transposon was confirmed by Southern analysis, successfully tagging the gene related to a phenol-utilizing pathway. By cell-free enzyme and genetic complementation assays, the inactivated enzyme through the mutation of the corresponding gene was identified as the catB gene, which encodes a cis,cis-muconate lactonizing enzyme.
TI  - Cloning and characterization of the exbB-exbD-tonB locus of Pasteurella haemolytica A1.
AB  - A recombinant plasmid (pMG1) carrying Pasteurella haemolytica A1 DNA which complements a tonB mutation of Escherichia coli has been isolated. E. coli tonB metE which carries pMG1 exhibits growth kinetics in the presence of vitamin B12 similar to that of the wild-type host. In addition, the complemented E. coli is susceptible to killing by bacteriophage phi 80 and colicin B. Analysis of the nucleotide sequence in the complementing DNA showed that it codes for three genes in the order of exbB-exbD-tonB. This genetic organization has been reported in Haemophilus influenzae, H. ducreyi, Pseudomonas putida and Vibrio cholerae, and may represent a separate lineage of evolution from that of the Enterobacteriaceae in which tonB is unlinked with the accessory genes exbB and exbD. A comparison of the DNA flanking the exbB-exbD-tonB locus in P. haemolytica A1 and H. influenzae showed that the flanking regions are completely different between the two organisms.
TI  - Chromosomal insertion of the entire Escherichia coli lactose operon, into two strains of Pseudomonas, using a modified mini-Tn5 delivery system.
AB  - A 12-kb PstI fragment including the entire E. coli lactose operon (lacIPOZYA) was inserted in one copy into the chromosome of Pseudomonas putida, Pseudomonas fluorescens and an E. coli strain with lac- phenotype. This was made possible by improvements of an already existing mini-Tn5 transposon delivery system (de Lorenzo et al., 1990; Herrero et al., 1990), which integrates cloned DNA fragments at random sites on the chromosome of the recipient bacteria in single copies. This has resulted in: (a) the making of two useful low copy-number cloning vectors both with extensive multi-cloning regions flanked by NotI sites needed in the mini-Tn5 delivery system; (b) the generation of E. coli nonlysogenic strains expressing the pi protein thus being capable of maintaining and delivering R6K-based mini-Tn5 vectors to other E. coli strains; (c) the successful insertion of the E. coli lactose operon into the P. fluorescens chromosome giving P. fluorescens the ability to grow on lactose; (d) evidence from Southern blotting that contradicts the assumption that the mini-Tn5 delivery system always creates one-copy inserts. These improvements allow insertion of large DNA fragments encoding highly expressed proteins into the chromosome of a large variety of Gram-negative bacteria including E. coli.
TI  - Isolation and sequencing of a gene coding for glyoxalase I activity from Salmonella typhimurium and comparison with other glyoxalase I sequences.
AB  - The glyoxalase I gene (gloA) from Salmonella typhimurium has been isolated in Escherichia coli on a multi-copy pBR322-derived plasmid, selecting for resistance to 3 mM methylglyoxal on Luria-Bertani agar. The region of the plasmid which confers the methylglyoxal resistance in E. coli was sequenced. The deduced protein sequence was compared to the known sequences of the Homo sapiens and Pseudomonas putida glyoxalase I (GlxI) enzymes, and regions of strong homology were used to probe the National Center for Biotechnology Information protein database. This search identified several previously known glyoxalase I sequences and other open reading frames with unassigned function. The clustal alignments of the sequences are presented, indicating possible Zn2+ ligands and active site regions. In addition, the S. typhimurium sequence aligns with both the N-terminal half and the C-terminal half of the proposed GlxI sequences from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe, suggesting that the structures of the yeast enzymes are those of fused dimers.
TI  - A bacterial basic region leucine zipper histidine kinase regulating toluene degradation.
AB  - The two-component signal transduction pathways in bacteria use a histidine-aspartate phosphorelay circuit to mediate cellular changes in response to environmental stimuli. Here we describe a novel two-component todST system, which activates expression of the toluene degradation (tod) pathway in Pseudomonas putida F1. The todS gene is predicted to encode a sensory hybrid kinase with two unique properties--a basic region leucine zipper dimerization motif at the N terminus and a duplicated histidine kinase motif. Evidence from a synthetic peptide model suggests that TodS binds as a dimer to a pseudopalindromic sequence (5'-TGACTCA), which resembles the recognition sequence of the eukaryotic transcription factors Fos and Jun. These results provide additional evidence that bacteria and eukaryotes share common regulatory motifs. The todT gene product, a response regulator, was overproduced as a fusion protein in Escherichia coli, and the purified protein was found to bind specifically to a 6-bp palindromic DNA structure in the tod control region. The phosphorylated form of TodT appears to be the activator of tod structural genes. This is the first report of a two-component system that regulates aromatic metabolism in bacteria.
TI  - A new approach for containment of microorganisms: dual control of streptavidin expression by antisense RNA and the T7 transcription system.
AB  - The use of microorganisms in the open environment would be of less concern if they were endowed with programmed self-destruction mechanisms. Here, we propose a new genetic design to increase the effectiveness of cell suicide systems. It ensures very tight control of the derepression of cell death by the combination of the bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase-lysozyme system and an inducible synthesis of antisense RNA and the Escherichia coli LacI repressor. Functionality of this regulatory concept was tested by applying it to containment of Gram-negative bacteria, based on the conditional expression of the lethal Streptomyces avidinii streptavidin gene. Toxicity of streptavidin is derived from its exceptionally high binding affinity for an essential prosthetic group, D-biotin. The entire construct was designed to allow the soil bacterium Pseudomonas putida to survive only in the presence of aromatic hydrocarbons and their derivatives which it can degrade. Under favorable growth conditions, clones escaping killing appeared at frequencies of only 10(-7)-10(-8) per cell per generation. The general requirement for biotin through the living world should make streptavidin-based conditional lethal designs applicable to a broad range of containment strategies.
TI  - Mechanisms for solvent tolerance in bacteria.
AB  - The development of tolerance in Pseudomonas putida DOT-T1 to toluene and related  highly toxic compounds involves short- and long-term responses. The short-term response is based on an increase in the rigidity of the cell membrane by rapid transformation of the fatty acid cis-9,10-methylene hexadecanoic acid (C17:cyclopropane) to unsaturated 9-cis-hexadecenoic acid (C16:1,9 cis) and subsequent transformation to the trans isomer. The long-term response involves in addition to the changes in fatty acids, alterations in the level of the phospholipid polar head groups: cardiolipin increases and phosphatidylethanolamine decreases. The two alterations lead to increased cell membrane rigidity and should be regarded as physical mechanisms that prevent solvent penetrance. Biochemical mechanisms that decrease the concentration of toluene in the cell membrane also take place and involve: (i) a solvent exclusion system and (ii) metabolic removal of toluene via oxidation. Mutants unable to carry out cis --> trans isomerization of unsaturated lipids, that exhibit altered cell envelopes because of the lack of the OprL protein, or that are unable to exclude toluene from cell membranes are hypersensitive to toluene.
TI  - Structural studies on the catalytic component of benzene dioxygenase from Pseudomonas putida.
AB  
TI  - Distribution of amine oxidases and amine dehydrogenases in bacteria grown on primary amines and characterization of the amine oxidase from Klebsiella oxytoca.
AB  - The bacteria Klebsiella oxytoca LMD 72.65 (ATCC 8724), Arthrobacter P1 LMD 81.60  (NCIB 11625), Paracoccus versutus LMD 80.62 (ATCC 25364), Escherichia coli W LMD 50.28 (ATCC 9637), E. coli K12 LMD 93.68, Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 LMD 89.1 (ATCC 17933) and Pseudomonas putida LMD 68.20 (ATCC 12633) utilized primary amines as a carbon and energy source, although the range of amines accepted varied from organism to organism. The Gram-negative bacteria K. oxytoca and E. coli as well as the Gram-positive methylotroph Arthrobacter P1 used an oxidase whereas the pseudomonads and the Gram-negative methylotroph Paracoccus versutus used a dehydrogenase for amine oxidation. K. oxytoca utilized several primary amines but showed a preference for those containing a phenyl group moiety. Only a single oxidase was used for oxidation of the amines. After purification, the following characteristics of the enzyme indicated that it belonged to the group of copper-quinoprotein amine oxidase (EC 1.4.3.6): the molecular mass (172,000 Da) of the homodimeric protein; the UV/visible and EPR spectra of isolated and p-nitrophenylhydrazine-inhibited enzyme; the presence and the content of copper and topaquinone (TPQ). The amine oxidase appeared to be soluble and localized in the periplasm, but catalase and NAD-dependent aromatic aldehyde dehydrogenase, enzymes catalysing the conversion of its reaction products, were found in the cytoplasm. From the amino acid sequence of the N-terminal part as well as that of a purified peptide, it appears that K. oxytoca produces a copper-quinoprotein oxidase which is very similar to that found in other Enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - Construction and use of a versatile set of broad-host-range cloning and expression vectors based on the RK2 replicon.
AB  - The plasmid vectors described in this report are derived from the broad-host-range RK2 replicon and can be maintained in many gram-negative bacterial species. The complete nucleotide sequences of all of the cloning and expression vectors are known. Important characteristics of the cloning vectors are as follows: a size range of 4.8 to 7.1 kb, unique cloning sites, different antibiotic resistance markers for selection of plasmid-containing cells, oriT-mediated conjugative plasmid transfer, plasmid stabilization functions, and a means for a simple method for modification of plasmid copy number. Expression vectors were constructed by insertion of the inducible Pu or Pm promoter together with its regulatory gene xylR or xylS, respectively, from the TOL plasmid of Pseudomonas putida. One of these vectors was used in an analysis of the correlation between phosphoglucomutase activity and amylose accumulation in Escherichia coli. The experiments showed that amylose synthesis was only marginally affected by the level of basal expression from the Pm promoter of the Acetobacter xylinum phosphoglucomutase gene (celB). In contrast, amylose accumulation was strongly reduced when transcription from Pm was induced. CelB was also expressed with a very high induction ratio in Xanthomonas campestris. These experiments showed that the A. xylinum celB gene could not complement the role of the bifunctional X. campestris phosphoglucomutase-phosphomannomutase gene in xanthan biosynthesis. We believe that the vectors described here are useful for cloning experiments, gene expression, and physiological studies with a wide range of bacteria and presumably also for analysis of gene transfer in the environment.
TI  - Turn angle and run time distributions characterize swimming behavior for Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - The swimming behavior of Pseudomonas putida was analyzed with a tracking microscope to quantify its run time and turn angle distributions. Monte Carlo computer simulations illustrated that the bimodal turn angle distribution of P. putida reduced collisions with obstacles in porous media in comparison to the unimodal distribution of Escherichia coli.
TI  - Neisseria meningitidis tonB, exbB, and exbD genes: Ton-dependent utilization of protein-bound iron in Neisseriae.
AB  - We have recently cloned and characterized the hemoglobin (Hb) receptor gene, hmbR, from Neisseria meningitidis. To identify additional proteins that are involved in Hb utilization, the N. meningitidis Hb utilization system was reconstituted in Escherichia coli. Five cosmids from N. meningitidis DNA library enabled a heme-requiring (hemA), HmbR-expressing mutant of E. coli to use Hb as both porphyrin and iron source. Nucleotide sequence analysis of DNA fragments subcloned from the Hb-complementing cosmids identified four open reading frames, three of them homologous to Pseudomonas putida, E. coli, and Haemophilus influenzae exbB, exbD, and tonB genes. The N. meningitidis TonB protein is 28.8 to 33.6% identical to other gram-negative TonB proteins, while the N. meningitidis ExbD protein shares between 23.3 and 34.3% identical amino acids with other ExbD and TolR proteins. The N. meningitidis ExbB protein was 24.7 to 36.1% homologous with other gram-negative ExbB and TolQ proteins. Complementation studies indicated that the neisserial Ton system cannot interact with the E. coli FhuA TonB-dependent outer membrane receptor. The N. meningitidis tonB mutant was unable to use Hb, Hb-haptoglobin complexes, transferrin, and lactoferrin as iron sources. Insertion of an antibiotic cassette in the 3' end of the exbD gene produced a leaky phenotype. Efficient usage of heme by N. meningitidis tonB and exbD mutants suggests the existence of a Ton-independent heme utilization mechanism. E. coli complementation studies and the analysis of N. meningitidis hmbR and hpu mutants suggested the existence of another Hb utilization mechanism in this organism.
TI  - Relative expression and stability of a chromosomally integrated and plasmid-borne marker gene fusion in environmentally competent bacteria.
AB  - A xylE-iceC transcriptional fusion was created by ligatinga DNA fragment harboring the cloned xylE structural gene from the TOL plasmid of Pseudomonas putida mt-2 into the cloned iceC gene of Pseudomonas syringae Cit7. This fusion construct was integrated into the chromosome of Pseudomonas syringae Cit7 by homologous recombination. Both cis-merodiploid strain Cit7m17 and marker exchange strain Cit7h69 produced the XylE gene product, catechol2,3-dioxygenase. Strain Cit7m17, in which XylE was influenced by transcription initiated by the amp promoter on pBR322, exhibited XylE activity in stationary phase at levels about 45 times higher than strain Cit7h69, permitting detection of 10(7) Cit7m17 cells in the spectrophotometric assay and 10(3) cells in HPLC measurements. The stability of xylE in both Cit7m17 and Cit7h69 was compared with maintenance of xylE in several plasmid-borne constructs in P.aeruginosa, Erwinia herbicola, and Escherichia coli. Only the xylE-iceC fusion in the chromosome of Cit7h69 and Cit7m17was stable in plate assays over the course of these studies. Even though strain Cit7h69 stably expressed xylE, the low level of expression precludes its use in direct spectrophotometric or HPLC assays as a means for detecting cells in environmental samples. However, expression of xylEin Cit7h69 is sufficient for identification of colonies harboring this marker gene which is useful in laboratory plate assays, and as a marker gene system for the detection of environmentally-competent strains chromosomally taggedwith xylE for use in autecological studies.
TI  - Improved broad-host-range RK2 vectors useful for high and low regulated gene expression levels in gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - This report describes the construction and use of improved broad-host-range expression vectors based on the previously constructed pJB137 and pJB653 plasmids (Blatny et al., 1997). These vectors contain the minimal replicon of RK2 and the inducible Pu or Pm promoters together with their regulatory xylR or xylS genes, respectively, from the Pseudomonas putida TOL plasmid pWWO. A set of ATG vectors were derived from pJB653, and these vectors are characterized by the relatively small size, the presence of multiple cloning sites downstream of Pm, the establishment of their nucleotide sequence, the presence of RK2 oriT, and different antibiotic selection markers. The copy numbers of all the vectors can easily be modified by using copy-up mutations of the trfA gene, required for initiation of replication of RK2 replicons. The vectors were used to study the expression levels of the Acetobacter xylinum phosphoglucomutase gene celB and the two commonly used reporter genes luc and cat in Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Xanthomonas campestris. Good induction properties and tight regulation of Pm were achieved in all three species tested, and higher gene expression levels were obtained by using the ATG vectors compared to pJB653. By introducing different trfA copy-up mutations into the vectors, a wide range of gene expression levels from Pu and Pm were obtained in E. coli. Induced expression levels of luc, cat, and celB from Pm were found to be comparable to or higher than those from the Ptrc and PT7 promoters located on high copy number plasmids. The induced levels of Luc activity were higher in P. aeruginosa than in E. coli, indicating that these vectors may be useful for maximization of gene expression in strains other than E. coli. We believe that the well-characterized vectors described here are useful for gene expression studies and routine cloning experiments in many Gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Pseudomonas putida B2: a tod-lux bioluminescent reporter for toluene and trichloroethylene co-metabolism.
AB  - A tod-lux transcriptional fusion bioluminescent reporter strain, Pseudomonas putida B2, was developed to permit on-line analysis of trichloroethylene (TCE) transformation by toluene dioxygenase (todC1C2BA) in Pseudomonas putida F1. Strain B2 was exposed to toluene in growing and resting cell bioluminescence assays. The growing cells showed a direct correlation between bioluminescence and toluene concentration, while resting cells showed reproducible bioluminescence with repeated toluene exposures. In addition, P. putida B2 was encapsulated in alginate beads and used in a packed bed flow-through differential volume reactor. The TCE feed into the differential volume reactor was constant at 20 mg L-1 and toluene was pulsed in square-wave perturbations at 10 mg L-1. The system showed a direct correlation between the expression of the tod operon (as monitored by light output) and the co-metabolism of TCE. Approximately 20% of the TCE and 50% of the toluene was removed at a flow rate of 0.4 ml min-1. This approach allowed the on-line monitoring of tod gene expression and its relation to TCE biotransformation.

AB  
TI  - XylUW, two genes at the start of the upper pathway operon of TOL plasmid pWW0, appear to play no essential part in determining its catabolic phenotype.
AB  - The upper pathway operon of the toluene catabolic pathway of TOL plasmid pWW0 was shown to carry two open reading frames between the start of transcription and xylC (encoding benzaldehyde dehydrogenase), the first previously reported gene of the operon. These were designated xylUW: xylU encoded a protein of 131 amino acid residues (M(r) 14,244) which bore no relationship with any protein in the databases, and xylW encoded a protein of 348 residues (M(r) 36,992) which was strongly homologous to other long-chain Zn-containing alcohol dehydrogenases. Extracts of Escherichia coli carrying xylUW in expression vector pTrc99A contained a novel protein corresponding to XylW, but no NAD(+)-dependent dehydrogenase activity against benzyl alcohol, mandelate or bezylamine. A mini-Tn5 transposon carrying the meta pathway operon was constructed and from it two strains of Pseudomonas putida were constructed with the normally plasmid-encoded catabolic operons integrated into the chromosome. Three derivatives of plasmid pKNG101 containing modified xylUW genes were constructed, two of which had frameshifts in xylU and xylW, respectively, and a third with a deletion from the 3' end of xylU into the 5' end of xylW. The wild-type genes of the two Pseudomonas strains were substituted by the mutant alleles by reverse genetics. The ability of the constructed mutant strains to utilize the aromatic substrates of the TOL pathway was not significantly affected.
TI  - Molecular cloning of the nemA gene encoding N-ethylmaleimide reductase from Escherichia coli.
AB  - Using the gene mapping membrane technique, we identified a gene (nemA) that encodes N-ethylmaleimide reductase in Escherichia coli. The open reading frame encodes a polypeptide of 365 amino acids with a molecular mass of 39,514 Da. The deduced amino acid sequence showed a high degree of homology (87% identical) with the pentaerythritol tetranitrate reductase of Enterobacter cloacae and the morphinone reductase of Pseudomonas putida (52% identical).
TI  - Nucleotide sequences and regulational analysis of genes involved in conversion of aniline to catechol in Pseudomonas putida UCC22(pTDN1).
AB  - A 9,233-bp HindIII fragment of the aromatic amine catabolic plasmid pTDN1, isolated from a derivative of Pseudomonas putida mt-2 (UCC22), confers the ability to degrade aniline on P. putida KT2442. The fragment encodes six open reading frames which are arranged in the same direction. Their 5' upstream region is part of the direct-repeat sequence of pTDN1. Nucleotide sequence of 1.8 kb of the repeat sequence revealed only a single base pair change compared to the known sequence of IS1071 which is involved in the transposition of the chlorobenzoate genes (C. Nakatsu, J. Ng, R. Singh, N. Straus, and C. Wyndham, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88:8312-8316, 1991). Four open reading frames encode proteins with considerable homology to proteins found in other aromatic-compound degradation pathways. On the basis of sequence similarity, these genes are proposed to encode the large and small subunits of aniline oxygenase (tdnA1 and tdnA2, respectively), a reductase (tdnB), and a LysR-type regulatory gene (tdnR). The putative large subunit has a conserved [2Fe-2S]R Rieske-type ligand center. Two genes, tdnQ and tdnT, which may be involved in amino group transfer, are localized upstream of the putative oxygenase genes. The tdnQ gene product shares about 30% similarity with glutamine synthetases; however, a pUC-based plasmid carrying tdnQ did not support the growth of an Escherichia coli glnA strain in the absence of glutamine. TdnT possesses domains that are conserved among amidotransferases. The tdnQ, tdnA1, tdnA2, tdnB, and tdnR genes are essential for the conversion of aniline to catechol.
TI  - Cloning and expression in Pseudomonas putida of two of the histidine utilization  genes from Rhizobium fredii.
AB  - Two of the genes encoding histidine utilization (hut) in Rhizobium fredii strain  HH303 have been cloned in Pseudomonas putida and partially characterized. Molecular cloning of the genes was achieved by mobilizing an R. fredii cosmid library into a mutant strain of P. putida containing a Tn5 element in its histidase (hutH) gene. A number of overlapping clones were identified, all of which contain a 7.1-kbp HindIII fragment. The origin of this 7.1-kbp fragment from the chromosome of R. fredii was confirmed by Southern blotting and hybridization studies. In addition, this fragment and the two adjacent HindIII fragments of 9 and 12 kbp respectively were subcloned into pBluescript KS+ and further characterized. Although the R. fredii clones expressed histidase in Pseudomonas, they did not in Escherichia coli, suggesting that E. coli is not a suitable cloning host for Rhizobia genes.
TI  - Molecular cloning and expression in different microbes of the DNA encoding Pseudomonas putida U phenylacetyl-CoA ligase. Use of this gene to improve the rate of benzylpenicillin biosynthesis in Penicillium chrysogenum.
AB  - The gene encoding phenylacetyl-CoA ligase (pcl), the first enzyme of the pathway  involved in the aerobic catabolism of phenylacetic acid in Pseudomonas putida U, has been cloned, sequenced, and expressed in two different microbes. In both, the primary structure of the protein was studied, and after genetic manipulation, different recombinant proteins were analyzed. The pcl gene, which was isolated from P. putida U by mutagenesis with the transposon Tn5, encodes a 48-kDa protein corresponding to the phenylacetyl-CoA ligase previously purified by us (Martinez-Blanco, H., Reglero, A. Rodriguez-Aparicio, L. B., and Luengo, J. M. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 7084-7090). Expression of the pcl gene in Escherichia coli leads to the appearance of this enzymatic activity, and cloning and expression of a 10.5-kb DNA fragment containing this gene confer this bacterium with the ability to grow in chemically defined medium containing phenylacetic acid as the sole carbon source. The appearance of phenylacetyl-CoA ligase activity in all of the strains of the fungus Penicillium chrysogenum transformed with a construction bearing this gene was directly related to a significant increase in the quantities of benzylpenicillin accumulated in the broths (between 1.8- and 2.2-fold higher), indicating that expression of this bacterial gene (pcl) helps to increase the pool of a direct biosynthetic precursor, phenylacetyl-CoA. This report describes the sequence of a phenylacetyl-CoA ligase for the first time and provides direct evidence that the expression in P. chrysogenum of a heterologous protein (involved in the catabolism of a penicillin precursor) is a useful strategy for improving the biosynthetic machinery of this fungus.
TI  - The amino acid sequence of rat kidney 5-oxo-L-prolinase determined by cDNA cloning.
AB  - 5-Oxoprolinase (EC 3.5.2) catalyzes a reaction in which the endergonic cleavage of 5-oxo-L-proline to form L-glutamate is coupled to the exergonic hydrolysis of ATP to ADP and inorganic phosphate. Highly purified preparations of the enzyme have been obtained from rat kidney and Pseudomonas putida. The rat kidney enzyme is composed of two strongly interacting, apparently identical subunits (Mr = 142,000), whereas that from P. putida is composed of two functionally different protein components that can readily be dissociated. Here we report the cloning of rat kidney 5-oxoprolinase with preliminary expression studies. cDNA clones encoding the enzyme were isolated by screening a lambdagt11 cDNA library beginning with a degenerate oligonucleotide probe based on peptide sequence data obtained from the purified enzyme. The whole cDNA clone was completed by amplifying its 5' end from a premade library of rat kidney Marathon-ReadyTM cDNAs using polymerase chain reaction methodology. The composite cDNA (4,016 bases) revealed an uninterrupted open reading frame encoding 1,288 amino acid residues (Mr = 137,759). The deduced amino acid sequence contains all four of the peptide sequences that were independently found in peptide fragments derived from the enzyme. Expression of the full-length clone in Escherichia coli yielded a product of the same size as the rat kidney enzyme and which reacted with antibodies directed against the rat kidney enzyme. The predicted amino acid sequence is almost 50% identical throughout its entire length to that of a hypothetical yeast protein YKL215C. It is also 26% identical in half its length to the bacterial hydantoinase HyuA and 26% identical in the other half to the bacterial hydantoinase HyuB. The results suggest unexpected evolutionary relationships among the hydantoinases and rat kidney 5-oxoprolinase which share the common property of hydrolyzing the imide bond of 5-membered rings but which do not all require ATP.
TI  - Identification and characterization of the tolQRA genes of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - The tolQ, tolR, and tolA genes from Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO were cloned using  degenerate oligonucleotide PCR primers designed based on conserved transmembrane regions of Escherichia coli TolQ and TolR and E. coli and Pseudomonas putida ExbB and ExbD. The resulting PCR product was used as a probe to isolate a 6.5-kb DNA fragment containing P. aeruginosa tolQ, tolR, and tolA. The nucleotide sequence of a 2.9-kb DNA fragment containing the tolQ, tolR, and tolA genes was determined. The DNA sequence predicts TolQ to be a 25,250-Da protein exhibiting 53% identity to E. coli TolQ. TolR is predicted to be a 15,788-Da protein, sharing 38% identity with the E. coli TolR protein. The P. aeruginosa tolA sequence predicts a 37,813-Da protein with 27% identity to the E. coli TolA. The P. aeruginosa TolQRA proteins were expressed in E. coli minicells. Analysis of plasmid-encoded tolQ::lacZ and tolA::lacZ promoter fusions in E. coli indicated that these genes are expressed at different levels, suggesting transcription from different promoters. Transcriptional analysis of the tol genes in P. aeruginosa revealed that the tolQ and tolR genes are cotranscribed as an approximately 1.5-kb transcript and that tolA is transcribed from its own promoter as an approximately 1.2-kb transcript. The P. aeruginosa Tol proteins were functionally unable to complement E. coli tol mutants, although P. aeruginosa TolQ was able to complement the iron-limited growth of an E. coli exbB mutant. Introduction of the tolQRA genes in the tol-like mutant PAO 1652 restored pyocin AR41 killing, indicating that the Tol proteins are involved in the uptake of pyocin AR41 in P. aeruginosa. Attempts to inactivate the chromosomal copy of the tolA or tolQ gene in the parent strain PAO proved to be unsuccessful, and we propose that inactivation of these genes in P. aeruginosa results in a lethal phenotype.
TI  - PhhR, a divergently transcribed activator of the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene cluster of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa was recently found to possess a cluster of structural genes encoding phenylalanine hydroxylase (PhhA), carbinolamine dehydratase (PhhB), and aromatic aminotransferase (PhhC). We now report the presence, in the flanking upstream region, of a divergently transcribed gene (phhR) encoding an activator protein. Inactivation of phhR markedly reduced expression of the structural genes. PhhR belongs to the large prokaryote family of sigma 54 enhancer-binding proteins, and activation of the phh operon by PhhR in P. aeruginosa required rpoN. The closest homologues of PhhR are the TyrR proteins from Escherichia coli and Haemophilus influenzae. E. coli TyrR is an unusual member of the homologue family in that the transcriptional units regulated by tyrR are driven by sigma 70 promoters. P. aeruginosa phhR was able to replace E. coli tyrR as a repressor of the aroF-tyrA operon (but not as an activator of mtr) in the heterologous E. coli system. Two regions that resemble E. coli TyrR boxes were identified in the intervening region between phhR and phhA. We propose that one or both boxes may be the target of PhhR acting as an autogenous repressor at a sigma 70 promoter in one direction. In the other direction, one or both boxes may be the upstream activator sequence targeted by PhhR to facilitate expression of the phh operon from a sigma 54 promoter. The phh operon was strongly induced in fructose- or glucose-based minimal medium by L-phenylalanine. Inactivation of phhR in P. aeruginosa abolished ability to utilize either L-phenylalanine or L-tyrosine as a sole source of carbon for growth.
TI  - Structure and function of the Pseudomonas putida integration host factor.
AB  - Integration host factor (IHF) is a DNA-binding and -bending protein that has been found in a number of gram-negative bacteria. Here we describe the cloning, sequencing, and functional analysis of the genes coding for the two subunits of IHF from Pseudomonas putida. Both the ihfA and ihfB genes of P. putida code for 100-amino-acid-residue polypeptides that are 1 and 6 residues longer than the Escherichia coli IHF subunits, respectively. The P. putida ihfA and ihfB genes can effectively complement E. coli ihf mutants, suggesting that the P. putida IHF subunits can form functional heterodimers with the IHF subunits of E. coli. Analysis of the amino acid differences between the E. coli and P. putida protein sequences suggests that in the evolution of IHF, amino acid changes were mainly restricted to the N-terminal domains and to the extreme C termini. These changes do not interfere with dimer formation or with DNA recognition. We constructed a P. putida mutant strain carrying an ihfA gene knockout and demonstrated that IHF is essential for the expression of the P(U) promoter of the xyl operon of the upper pathway of toluene degradation. It was further shown that the ihfA P. putida mutant strain carrying the TOL plasmid was defective in the degradation of the aromatic model compound benzyl alcohol, proving the unique role of IHF in xyl operon promoter regulation.
TI  - Biosynthesis of synthons in two-liquid-phase media.
AB  - The Pseudomonas oleovorans alkane hydroxylase and xylene oxygenase from Pseudomonas putida are versatile mono-oxygenases for stereo- and regioselective oxidation of aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons. Pseudomonas oleovorans and alkanol dehydrogenase deficient mutants of Pseudomonas have previously been used to produce alkanols from various alkanes and optically active epoxides from alkenes. Similarly, P. putida strains have been used to produce aromatic alcohols, aromatic acids, and optically active styrene oxides. A limitation in the use of Pseudomonas strains for bioconversions is that these strains can degrade some of the products formed. To counter this problem, we have constructed Escherichia coli recombinants, which contain the alk genes from the OCT plasmid of P. oleovorans [E. coli HB101 (pGEc47)] and the xylMA genes from the TOL plasmid of P. putida mt-2 [E. coli HB101 (pGB63)], encoding alkane hydroxylase and xylene oxygenase, respectively. Escherichia coli HB101 (pGEc47) was used to produce octanoic acid from n-octane and E. coli HB101 (pBG63) was put to use for the oxidation of styrene to styrene oxide in two-liquid phase biocatalysis at high cell densities. The alk(+) recombinant strain E. coli HB101 (pGEc47) was grown to 40 g/L cell dry mass in the presence of n-octane, which was converted to octanoic acid by the alkane oxidation system, the product accumulating in the aqueous phase. The xyl(+) recombinant E. coli HB101 (pBG63) was grown to a cell density of 26 g/L cell dry mass in the presence of around 7% (v/v) n-dodecane, which contained 2% (v/v) styrene. The recombinant E. coli (xyl(+)) converted styrene to (S)-(+)-styrene oxide at high enantiomeric excess (94% ee) and this compound partitioned almost exclusively into the organic phase. Using these high-cell-density two-liquid-phase cultures, the products accumulated rapidly, yielding high concentrations of products (50 mM octanoic acid and 90 mM styrene oxide) in the respective phases.

TI  - The effect of nutrient limitation on styrene metabolism in Pseudomonas putida CA-3.
AB  - Styrene degradation in Pseudomonas putida CA-3 has previously been shown to be subject to catabolite repression in batch culture. We report here on the catabolite-repressing effects of succinate and glutamate and the effects of a limiting inorganic-nutrient concentration on the styrene degradation pathway of P. putida CA-3 in a chemostat culture at low growth rates (0.05 h-1). Oxidation of styrene and the presence of styrene oxide isomerase and phenylacetaldehyde dehydrogenase activities were used as a measure of the expression of the styrene degradation pathway. Both glutamate and succinate failed to repress the styrene degradation ability under growth conditions of carbon and energy limitation. Lower levels of enzyme activities of the styrene degradation pathway were seen in cells grown on styrene or phenylacetic acid (PAA) under conditions of both ammonia and sulfate limitation than were seen under carbon and energy limitation. Cells grown on PAA under continuous culture oxidize styrene and styrene oxide and possess styrene oxide isomerase and NAD(+)-dependent phenylacetaldehyde dehydrogenase activities. Catabolite repression of styrene metabolism was observed in cells grown on styrene or PAA in the presence of growth-saturating (nonlimiting) concentrations of succinate or glutamate under sulfate limitation.
TI  - Transcriptional regulation of the Rhodococcus rhodochrous J1 nitA gene encoding a nitrilase.
AB  - The 1.4-kb downstream region from a nitrilase gene (nitA) of an actinomycete Rhodococcus rhodochrous J1, which is industrially in use, was found to be required for the isovaleronitrile-dependent induction of nitrilase synthesis in experiments using a Rhodococcus-Escherichia coli shuttle vector pK4 in a Rhodococcus strain. Sequence analysis of the 1.4-kb region revealed the existence of an open reading frame (nitR) of 957 bp, which would encode a protein with a molecular mass of 35,100. Deletion of the central and 3'-terminal portion of nitR resulted in the complete loss of nitrilase activity, demonstrating that nitR codes for a transcriptional positive regulator in nitA expression. The deduced amino acid sequence of nitR showed similarity to a positive regulator family including XylS from Pseudomonas putida and AraC from E. coli. By Northern blot analysis, the 1.4-kb transcripts for nitA were detected in R. rhodochrous J1 cells cultured in the presence of isovaleronitrile, but not those cultured in the absence of isovaleronitrile. The transcriptional start site for nitA was mapped to a C residue located 26 bp upstream of its translational start site. Deletion analysis to define the nitA promoter region suggested the possible participation of an inverted repeat sequence, centered on base pair -52, in induction of nitA transcription.
TI  - Cloning of the genes for and characterization of the early stages of toluene and  o-xylene catabolism in Pseudomonas stutzeri OX1.
AB  - In order to study the toluene and o-xylene catabolic genes of Pseudomonas stutzeri OX1, a genomic library was constructed. A 28-kb EcoRI restriction endonuclease DNA fragment, cloned into the vector plasmid pLAFR1 and designated pFB3401, permitted Pseudomonas putida PaW340 to convert toluene and o-xylene into the corresponding meta-ring fission products. Physical and functional endonuclease restriction maps have been derived from the cloned DNA fragment. Further subcloning into and deletion analysis in the Escherichia coli vector pGEM-3Z allowed the genes for the conversion of toluene or o-xylene into the corresponding catechols to be mapped within a 6-kb region of the pFB3401 insert and their direction of transcription to be determined. Following exposure to toluene, E. coli cells carrying this 6-kb region produce a mixture of o-cresol, m-cresol, and p-cresol, which are further converted to 3-methylcatechol and 4-methylcatechol. Similarly, a mixture of 2,3-dimethylphenol and 3,4-dimethylphenol, further converted into dimethylcatechols, was detected after exposure to o-xylene. The enzyme involved in the first step of toluene and o-xylene degradation exhibited a broad substrate specificity, being able to oxidize also benzene, ethylbenzene, m-xylene, p-xylene, styrene, and naphthalene. Deletions of the 6-kb region which affect the ability to convert toluene or o-xylene into the corresponding methylphenols compromise also their further oxidation to methylcatechols. This suggests that a single enzyme system could be involved in both steps of the early stages of toluene and o-xylene catabolism.
TI  - Characterization of an OprL null mutant of Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - A Pseudomonas putida oprL null mutant was generated with reverse genetics by using an in vitro-truncated oprL::xylE construct and in vivo allelic exchange. The nature of the mutation introduced in P. putida was confirmed by Southern blotting. Western blots (immunoblots) of peptidoglycan-associated proteins revealed that the OprL protein was not made in the mutant strain, whereas it was detectable as a 19-kDa band in protein preparations of the wild-type strain. The P. putida oprL, mutant exhibited altered cell morphology as revealed by electron microscopy and was more sensitive to sodium dodecyl sulfate, deoxycholate, and EDTA than the wild-type strain. The oprL gene was conserved in a wide variety of the Pseudomonas strains belonging to rRNA group I, which suggests that this gene is important for the maintenance of the cell envelope and cell morphology in this group of microorganisms.
TI  - The nucleotide sequence of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa pyrE-crc-rph region and the purification of the crc gene product.
AB  - The gene (crc) responsible for catabolite repression control in Pseudomonas aeruginosa has been cloned and sequenced. Flanking the crc gene are genes encoding orotate phosphoribosyl transferase (pyrE) and RNase PH (rph). New crc mutants were constructed by disruption of the wild-type crc gene. The crc gene encodes an open reading frame of 259 amino acids with homology to the apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease family of DNA repair enzymes. However, crc mutants do not have a DNA repair phenotype, nor can the crc gene complement Escherichia coli DNA repair-deficient strains. The crc gene product was overexpressed in both P. aeruginosa and in E. coli, and the Crc protein was purified from both. The purified Crc proteins show neither apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease nor exonuclease activity. Antibody to the purified Crc protein reacted with proteins of similar size in crude extracts from Pseudomonas putida and Pseudomonas fluorescens, suggesting a common mechanism of catabolite repression in these three species.
TI  - Characterization and expression of the plasmid-borne bedD gene from Pseudomonas putida ML2, which codes for a NAD+-dependent cis-benzene dihydrodiol dehydrogenase.
AB  - The catabolic plasmid pHMT112 in Pseudomonas putida ML2 contains the bed gene cluster encoding benzene dioxygenase (bedC1C2BA) and a NAD+-dependent dehydrogenase (bedD) required to convert benzene into catechol. Analysis of the nucleotide sequence upstream of the benzene dioxygenase gene cluster (bedC1C2BA) revealed a 1,098-bp open reading frame (bedD) flanked by two 42-bp direct repeats, each containing a 14-bp sequence identical to the inverted repeat of IS26. In vitro translation analysis showed bedD to code for a polypeptide of ca. 39 kDa. Both the nucleotide and the deduced amino acid sequences show significant identity to sequences of glycerol dehydrogenases from Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, and Bacillus stearothermophilus. A bedD mutant of P. putida ML2 in which the gene was disrupted by a kanamycin resistance cassette was unable to utilize benzene for growth. The bedD gene product was found to complement the todD mutation in P. putida 39/D, the latter defective in the analogous cis-toluene dihydrodiol dehydrogenase. The dehydrogenase encoded by bedD) was overexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified. It was found to utilize NAD+ as an electron acceptor and exhibited higher substrate specificity for cis-benzene dihydrodiol and 1,2-propanediol compared with glycerol. Such a medium-chain dehydrogenase is the first to be reported for a Pseudomonas species, and its association with an aromatic ring-hydroxylating dioxygenase is unique among bacterial species capable of metabolizing aromatic hydrocarbons.
TI  - [Isolation of bacterial endotoxins from Pseudomonas putida 36 and Escherichia coli (vulgaris)].
AB  - Extracts of endotoxins from Gram-negative bacteria Pseudomonas putida 36 and Escherichia coli (vulgaris) grown upon solid-phase or submerged cultivations were studied. The composition of the extracts was analyzed by gel-filtration. Ps. putida 36 was shown to be a promising producer of bacterial endotoxins.
TI  - Construction and use of recombinant Escherichia coli strains for the synthesis of toluene cis-glycol.
AB  - The toluene dioxygenase genes derived from Pseudomonas putida NCIMB 11767 were subcloned from a previously constructed recombinant plasmid, pIG, using pUC18 as the cloning vector and E. coli TG2 as the host strain. The resulting strain, E. coli TG2 (p1/1), produced toluene cis-glycol when grown in LB broth or minimal medium in the presence of toluene. Restriction mapping and partial DNA sequencing provided evidence for the presence of ORFs with extensive homology to parts of the tod operon from P. putida F1. The clones exhibited some residual toluene cis-glycol dehydrogenase activity which resulted in the formation of small amounts of 3-methylcatechol. Expression of the dioxygenase was induced by toluene, but was not directed by the lac promoter within the cloning vector. The clones were assessed for toluene cis-glycol production in pH-controlled batch cultures, and the maximum product concentration obtained was 1.02 g l-1. Product formation was dependent upon the presence of glucose in the culture medium. Although the substrate was toxic, the biotransformation was apparently limited by the supply of toluene. The results suggest that it should be possible to improve toluene cis-glycol production by recombinants substantially by improving both the strain and fermentation process.
TI  - Regio- and stereospecific oxidation of 9,10-dihydroanthracene and 9,10-dihydrophenanthrene by naphthalene dioxygenase: structure and absolute stereochemistry of metabolites.
AB  - The oxidation of 9,10-dihydroanthracene and 9,10-dihydrophenanthrene was examined with mutant and recombinant strains expressing naphthalene dioxygenase from Pseudomonas putida (NCIB 9816.4. Salicylate-induced cells of P. putida strain 9816/11 and isopropylthiogalactopyranoside-induced cells of Escherichia coli JM109(DE3)(pDTG141) oxidized 9,10-dihydroanthracene to (+)-cis-1R,2S)-1,2-dihydroxy-1,2,9,10-tetrahydroanthracene (> 95% relative yield; > 95% enantiomeric excess) as the major product. 9-Hydroxy-9,10-dihydroanthracene (< 5% relative yield) was a minor product formed by both organisms. The same cells oxidized 9,10-dihydrophenanthrene to (+)-cis-(3S,4R)-3,4-dihydroxy-3,4,9,10-tetrahydrophenanthrene (70% relative yield; > 95% enantiomeric excess) and (+)-(S)-9-hydroxy-9,10-dihydrophenanthrene (30% relative yield). The major reaction catalyzed by naphthalene dioxygenase with 9,10-dihydroanthracene and 9,10-dihydrophenanthrene was stereospecific dihydroxylation in which both of the previously undescribed cis-diene diols were of R configuration at the benzylic center adjacent to the bridgehead carbon atom. The results suggest that for benzocylic substrates, the location of benzylic carbons influences the type of reaction(s) catalyzed by naphthalene dioxygenase.
TI  - Optimization of trichloroethylene degradation using soluble methane monooxygenase of Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b expressed in recombinant bacteria.
AB  - By complementing cell-free extracts of Pseudomonas putida F1/pSMMO20 with purified soluble methane monooxygenase (sMMO) components of Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b, the low cloned-gene sMMO activity in the recombinant strain was found to be due to incomplete activity of the hydroxylase component. To address this incomplete activity, additional sMMO-expressing strains were formed by transferring mmo-containing pSMMO20 and pSMMO50 into various bacterial species including pseudomonads and alpha-2 subdivision strains such as methanotrophs, methylotrophs, Agrobacterium tumefaciens A114, and Rhizobium meliloti 102F34 (11 new strains screened); sMMO activity was detected in the last two strains. To increase plasmid segregational stability, the hok/sok locus originally from Escherichia coli plasmid R1 was inserted downstream of the mmo locus of pSMMO20 (resulting in pSMMO40) and found to enhance plasmid stability in P. putida F1 and R. meliloti 102F34 (first report of hok/sok in Rhizobium). To further increase sMMO activity, a modified Whittenbury minimal medium was selected from various minimal and complex media based on trichloroethylene (TCE) degradation and growth rates and was improved by removing the sMMO-inhibiting metal ions [Cu(II), Ni(II), and Zn(II)] and chloramphenicol from the medium and by supplementing with an iron source (3.6 microM of ferrous ammonium sulfate). Using chemostat-grown P. putida F1/pSMMO40, it was found that sMMO activity was higher for cells grown at higher dilution rates. These optimization efforts resulted in a twofold increase in the extent of TCE degradation and more consistent sMMO activity.
TI  - The structure and mechanism of DNA gyrase from divergent bacterial species.
AB  
TI  - Chloroform mineralization by toluene-oxidizing bacteria.
AB  - Seven toluene-oxidizing bacterial strains (Pseudomonas mendocina KR1, Burkholderia cepacia G4, Pseudomonas putida F1, Pseudomonas pickettii PKO1, and Pseudomonas sp. strains ENVPC5, ENVBF1, and ENV113) were tested for their ability to degrade chloroform (CF). The greatest rate of CF oxidation was achieved with strain ENVBF1 (1.9 nmol/min/mg of cell protein). CF also was oxidized by P. mendocina KR1 (0.48 nmol/min/mg of cell protein), strain ENVPC5 (0.49 nmol/min/mg of cell protein), and Escherichia coli DH510B(pRS202), which contained cloned toluene 4-monooxygenase genes from P. mendocina KR1 (0.16 nmol/min/mg of cell protein). Degradation of [14C]CF and ion analysis of culture extracts revealed that CF was mineralized to CO2 (approximately 30 to 57% of the total products), soluble metabolites (approximately 15%), a total carbon fraction irreversibly bound to particulate cellular constituents (approximately 30%), and chloride ions (approximately 75% of the expected yield). CF oxidation by each strain was inhibited in the presence of trichloroethylene, and acetylene significantly inhibited trichloroethylene oxidation by P. mendocina KR1. Differences in the abilities of the CF-oxidizing strains to degrade other halogenated compounds were also identified. CF was not degraded by B. cepacia G4, P. putida F1, P. pickettii PKO1, Pseudomonas sp. strain ENV113, or P. mendocina KRMT, which contains a tmo mutation.
TI  - A stringently controlled expression system for analysing lateral gene transfer between bacteria.
AB  - The lateral transfer of genetic information among microorganisms is a major force driving the outstanding adaptability of microbial communities to environmental changes. Until now little information has been obtained on gene transfer in natural ecosystems. We present here a genetic circuit for detecting and quantifying horizontal gene transfer from a defined donor microorganism to recipient organisms in the absence of selection for a recipient-specific phenotype. The system consists of an engineered lacZ (encoding beta-galactosidase) reporter gene whose expression is controlled by a synthetic regulatory element based on a fusion between the Pr promoter-operator from lambda bacteriophage and the 5' non-coding leader region of the inp gene encoding the IS 10 transposase function. Expression of this reporter cassette in the recombinant microorganism is completely shut down by two chromosomally encoded trans-acting repressors working at the level of transcription (the Cl-EK117 protein from the lambda phage), and at the level of translation (the antisense RNA-OUT of the IS 10 element). When the reporter element is transferred to a different host by any mechanism, it escapes repression and becomes expressed. The system was validated with Pseudo-monas putida, and conjugational transfer frequencies of the reporter element as low as 10(-6) were detected. The modular design and broad host range of the genetic circuit, in combination with biomarkers which permit real-time in situ detection, will facilitate the monitor-ing of gene flow in a non-disruptive manner within the environment.
TI  - Recruitment and expression of toluene/trichloroethylene biodegradation genes in bacteria native to deep-subsurface sediments.
AB  - Four plasmids, each encoding a combination of either an Escherichia coli or Pseudomonas putida promoter and either toluene dioxygenase or toluene monooxygenase, were electroporated into five bacterial strains isolated from sediments found at depths of 91 to 295 m. Four of these engineered bacterial strains demonstrated both toluene and trichloroethylene degradation activities.
TI  - Stoichiometry of BkdR to substrate DNA in Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - BkdR is the transcriptional activator of the bkd operon of Pseudomonas putida, which encodes branched chain keto acid dehydrogenase. BkdR binds to a large region of DNA between its own structural gene and the first gene of the bkd operon. The object of the present studies was to determine the stoichiometry of binding as part of an effort to understand the action of BkdR in regulation of the bkd operon. [35S]BkdR was prepared and found to be essentially 100% active in the gel shift assay. Only one complex was formed under all the conditions used. The stoichiometry of BkdR binding to its specific substrate DNA was three tetramers per mold substrate DNA. L-valine did not affect the stoichiometry although this ligand was previously shown to affect the DNase I protection pattern. The addition of nonspecific DNA to the incubation mixture also did not affect this stoichiometry.
TI  - Comparison of the "Rieske" [2Fe-2S] center in the bc1 complex and in bacterial dioxygenases by circular dichroism spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry.
AB  - Two different types of "Rieske" [2Fe-2S] clusters have been observed in proteins, one in the bc complexes of the respiratory chain and the other in bacterial dioxygenases. We have compared the circular dichroic (CD) spectra and redox properties of the water soluble fragment of the Rieske center of the bovine heart mitochondrial bc1 complex (ISF) and of the ferredoxin from benzene dioxygenase in Pseudomonas putida ML2 (FDBED). Spinach ferredoxin was also measured for comparison. The redox potential of both proteins could be determined in solution by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and by CD-monitored spectroelectrochemistry using a specially constructed optically transparent thin layer (OTTLE) cell. Whereas the redox potential of the ISF (+312 +/- 5 mV at pH 7.0) depended both on the pH above pH 7 and on the ionic strength, the redox potential of the FDBED (-155 +/- 5 mV at pH 7.0) was observed to be independent of pH and ionic strength. The ISF showed a marked dependence of its redox potential on temperature, while the FDBED showed no temperature dependence. The entropy of the redox reaction delta S degrees rc was calculated as -88 +/- 11 J K-1 mol-1 for the bc1 Rieske center and approximately 0 J K-1 mol-1 for the FdBED. The CD spectra of Rieske type clusters are significantly different from those of plant type [2Fe-2S] ferredoxins. A strong negative CD band is present at 20 000 cm-1 (500 nm) in all reduced Rieske clusters. The possible assignment of this band is discussed as arising from the highest energy magnetically allowed d --> d transition (dz2 --> dxz) of the FeII site. If so, this band is highly indicative of the distortion of the ligand field of the FeII site.
TI  - Production of specific monoclonal antibodies to Burkholderia pseudomallei and their diagnostic application.
AB  - Hybridomas secreting monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) specific to Burkholderia pseudomallei were produced by immunizing BALB/cJ mice with crude culture filtrate of B. pseudomallei. Two monoclonal antibodies were found to be highly specific to B.pseudomallei as tested by indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunoblotting against a panel of crude whole cell extracts from B. pseudomallei, B. cepacia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P.putida, and Escherichia coli. One of the specific MAbs, clone SP-M, IgM subclass, could directly agglutinate all 42 B. pseudomallei, isolates. The study has shown that the agglutinating MAb has potential for rapid identification of B. pseudomallei in primary bacterial culture from clinical specimens. The antibody can be used in bacteriology laboratories to reduce time of biochemical methods, which require a few days.
TI  - Rapid purification of the oxygenase component of toluene dioxygenase from a polyol-responsive monoclonal antibody.
AB  - A monoclonal antibody designated 302 beta that is specific for the beta subunit of the oxygenase component (ISPTOL) of toluene dioxygenase from Pseudomonas putida F1 was used to prepare an immunoaffinity column. ISPTOL in cell extracts of Escherichia coli JM109(pDTG611) bound to the column, and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent elution-screening assay with different combinations of polyols and kosmotropic anions was used to determine the conditions necessary for recovery of active enzyme. Elution from an 8-ml antibody column with 50 mM 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonate buffer (pH 6.8) containing 50% ethylene glycol, 1.0 M ammonium sulfate, 1.0 mM dithiothreitol, and 0.2 mM ferrous ammonium sulfate gave approximately 2 mg of ISPTOL with a specific activity that was more than 300 times the specific activity previously obtained.
TI  - Cytochemical colocalization and quantitation of phenotypic and genotypic characteristics in individual bacterial cells.
AB  - The widely accepted view that most bacterial species have yet to be cultivated in vitro has gained support from recent ribosomal DNA-based environmental studies. To enable elucidation of the phenotypes of organisms recognized solely by molecular genetic techniques, we developed and evaluated cytochemical methods which colocalize phenotypic properties with in situ rRNA probe hybridization signals. Application of these methods to artificial mixtures of Pseudomonas putida and Escherichia coli or Vibrio vulnificus showed that biochemical properties, such as the cytochrome oxidase reaction and specific substrate-enhanced tetrazolium salt reduction, can be assigned to cells identified by signals from determinative fluorescent rRNA probe binding. By doing the reactions directly on the stage of an inverted microscope and monitoring reaction product formation with a charge-coupled device video camera, it was possible to determine the kinetics of oxidizable substrate utilization in single cells. Analysis of digitized images permitted quantitative study of the relationship between rRNA signal strength and the rate of tetrazolium salt reduction. The approach used in this study opens up new opportunities to investigate the biochemistry, physiology, and behavior of both culturable and nonculturable bacteria in their natural environments.
TI  - The Pseudomonas aeruginosa tonB gene encodes a novel TonB protein.
AB  - The Pseudomonas aeruginosa tonB gene was cloned by complementation of the tonB mutation of Pseudomonas putida strain TE516 (W. Bitter, J. Tommassen & P.J. Weisbeek, 1993, Mol Microbiol 7, 117-130). The gene was 1025 bp in length, capable of encoding a protein of 36860 Da. As with previously described TonB proteins, the P. aeruginosa TonB (TonBp.a.) was rich in Pro residues (18.1%) and contained Glu-Pro/Lys-Pro repeats. Unlike previously described TonB proteins, however, TonBp.a. lacked an N-terminal membrane anchor (signal) sequence and contained, instead, a predicted internal signal/anchor sequence, expected to yield an atypical N-terminal cytoplasmic domain in this protein. TonB proteins are essential components in iron-siderophore uptake in bacteria, apparently functioning as energy transducers in coupling the energized state of the cytoplasmic membrane to outer-membrane receptor function. As expected, tonB derivatives of P. aeruginosa were defective in siderophore-mediated iron acquisition. tonB gene expression was inducible by iron-limitation, consistent with the identification of a Fur consensus binding sequence upstream of the gene. TonBp.a. showed substantially greater similarity to the Escherichia coli TonB protein than the Pseudomonas putida protein (31% identity vs. 20% identity) and tonBp.a. was able to complement deficiencies in the acquisition of ferric enterobactin and vitamin B12, and sensitivity to phage phi 80 of an E. coli tonB strain. The larger size of TonBp.a. and its ability to function in both E. coli and P. putida make it a unique TonB protein whose characterization should enhance our understanding of TonB function in bacteria.
TI  - Comamonas testosteroni 3-ketosteroid-delta 4(5 alpha)-dehydrogenase: gene and protein characterization.
AB  - Comamonas testosteroni delta 4(5 alpha)- and delta1-dehydrogenases [delta4(5alpha)- and delta1DH] are key enzymes in the degradation of steroids having an A:B ring fusion in a trans configuration. We previously reported the isolation of the delta1dh gene (P. Plesiat, M. Grandguillot, S. Harayama, S. Vragar, and Y. Michel Briand, J. Bacteriol. 173:7219-7227, 1991). In this study, the gene encoding delta 4(5 alpha)DH was cloned in Escherichia coli on a 16-kbp BamHI fragment by screening a genomic bank of C. testosteroni ATCC 17410 with a probe derived from delta1dh. Subcloning experiments in plasmid pUC19 mapped delta 4(5 alpha)dh immediately downstream of delta1dh. The enzyme was overexpressed 18-fold in cells of E. coli JM109 carrying a 2.5-kbp cloned fragment (plasmid pXE25). However, much higher levels of enzymatic activity (264-fold) were obtained in Pseudomonas putida KT2440, using pMMB208 as an expression vector. Studies with crude lysates of KT2440 showed that delta4(5alpha)DH exhibits higher specificity and higher activity toward delta l-androstene-3,17-dione than toward the saturated derivative 5 alpha-androstane-3,17-dione. The reaction was found to be irreversible and to use efficiently typical flavoprotein electron acceptors; optimal conditions for the enzyme activity were pH 8 and 40 degrees C. Analysis of the nucleotide sequence of the insert of pXE25 revealed an open reading frame of 1,593 bp preceded by a putative ribosome-binding site and followed by a potential transcription terminator. The amino acid sequence of the deduced peptide showed a typical flavin adenine dinucleotide-binding site in its N-terminal region, confirming the flavoproteinic structure of delta 4(5 alpha)DH. The predicted molecular mass was consistent with that of the enzyme expressed in a T7 polymerase system (60 kDa). Alignment between delta 4(5 alpha)dh and delta1dh indicated that both genes, though coding for functionally related enzymes, do not derive from a common ancestor.
TI  - Choice of microbial host for the naphthalene dioxygenase bioconversion.
AB  - The use of whole cell biotransformations for single and multistep enzyme conversions is gaining widespread application. In this study the naphthalene dioxygenase nah A gene was transferred into Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAC 1R, Escherichia coli JM107 and Pseudomonas putida PpG 277. The effect of ethanol on these genetically engineered Gram-negative bacteria was studied by measurement of enzyme activity, stability and cell integrity. Ethanol has been used in biotransformations as a co-substrate carbon source for co-factor recycling and as a co-solvent increasing dissolved substrate and product levels. Ethanol increased the dissolved substrate (naphthalene) concentration slightly and dissolved product ((+)-cis-(1R,2S)-dihydroxy-1,2-dihydronaphthalene) by approximately 30% at 4% (w/v) ethanol. Both P. aeruginosa PAC 1R and P. putida PpG 277 showed decreased activity with increasing ethanol concentration whilst E. coli enzyme activity increased with increasing ethanol concentration being comparable to that when glucose was used as a carbon source. This project highlighted the many factors involved in the selection of microbial hosts for whole cell biotransformation processes.
TI  - TOL plasmid transcription factor XylS binds specifically to the Pm operator sequence.
AB  - XylS, an AraC family transcription factor, positively regulates transcription of  Pseudomonas putida TOL plasmid meta operon from the Pm promoter. A tandem of 15 bp homologous direct repeats, separated by 6 bp and overlapping with the -35 hexamer of the promoter, is required for the activation of Pm by XylS in vivo. In this study we have characterized specific binding of XylS to the Pm operator Om. XylS was overexpressed with an epitope tag in its N-terminus. Tagged XylS (N-XylS) was immunopurified and was shown to specifically bind to Om. We have used matrix-bound N-XylS in DNA footprinting and methylation interference experiments. Binding of N-XylS protects 44 bp in the Om region on both strands from DNase I digestion and generates hypersensitive sites (within the protected area) which lie on the same face of the DNA helix. Results of hydroxyl radical footprinting and methylation interference assays indicate that XylS binds along one side of the DNA and covers four helical turns. The protein has base-specific contacts in four adjacent major groove regions on the same helical face. Our data are in accord with the prediction of the presence of two separate DNA-binding units in an XylS molecule which are involved in base-specific contacts in two adjacent major-groove regions of a half-site. The direct repeat arrangement of the binding site and the mode of DNA binding of XylS are similar to the arrangement of recognition sites and the DNA contact pattern of AraC protein from Escherichia coli.
TI  - Identification of the repressor subdomain within the signal reception module of the prokaryotic enhancer-binding protein XylR of Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - In the presence of m-xylene, the protein XylR encoded by the TOL plasmid of Pseudomonas putida, activates the final sigma54-dependent promoter Pu. Early activation stages involve the release of the intramolecular repression caused by the signal reception N-terminal (A domain) of XylR on the central module of the protein. A genetic approach has been followed to locate the specific segment within A domain of XylR that is directly responsible for its down-regulation in the absence of inducer, as compared to that involved in effector (m-xylene) binding. For this, a reporter Escherichia coli strain carrying a monocopy transcriptional fusion of Pu to lacZ was transformed with a collection of plasmids encoding equivalent truncated varieties of XylR, consisting of nested and internal deletions throughout the entire A domain. Examination of the resulting phenotypes allowed the assignment of the A domain region near the central activation domain, as the portion of the protein responsible for the specific repression of XylR activity in the absence of m-xylene.
TI  - Untranslated sequence upstream of MarA in the multiple antibiotic resistance locus of Escherichia coli is related to the effector-binding domain of the XylS transcriptional activator.
AB  - MarA, the 129-amino-acid (aa) protein which plays a crucial role in the multiple  antibiotic resistance (Mar) phenotype in Escherichia coli, shows homology to members of the XylS/AraC family of transcriptional regulators. Although these proteins vary in size from around 100 to 350 aa they all contain a DNA-binding domain with a helix-turn-helix motif. The larger ones, e.g., XylS, AraC, and Rob, contain an additional domain either at their amino- or at their carboxyterminus. This domain is important for effector-binding or dimerization or of unknown function. MarA consists only of the DNA-binding component. Nevertheless, a sequence with a coding potential of 141 aa upstream of its ATG start-codon showed 20.5-26.9% aa identity with the corresponding section within the effector-binding domain of XylS from the TOL plasmid of Pseudomonas putida when translated in the same reading frame as MarA. However, the reading frame was interrupted by 11 translational stops. In another frame, this upstream sequence actually codes for a real protein, MarR, that is completely unrelated to XylS. Implications for the putative evolution of regulatory proteins through translocation of domains followed by adaptation are discussed.
TI  - A novel cell surface polysaccharide in Pseudomonas putida WCS358, which shares characteristics with Escherichia coli K antigens, is not involved in root colonization.
AB  - Previously we have shown that flagella and the O-specific polysaccharide of lipopolysaccharide play a role in colonization of the potato root by plant growth-promoting Pseudomonas strains WCS374 and WCS358. In this paper, we describe a novel cell surface-exposed structure in Pseudomonas putida WCS358 examined with a specific monoclonal antibody. This cell surface structure appeared to be a polysaccharide, which was accessible to the monoclonal antibody at the outer cell surface. Further study revealed that it does not contain 2-keto-3-deoxyoctonate, heptose, or lipid A, indicating that it is not a second type of lipopolysaccharide. Instead, the polysaccharide shared some characteristics with K antigen described for Escherichia coli. From a series of 49 different soil bacteria tested, only one other potato plant growth-promoting Pseudomonas strain reacted positively with the monoclonal antibody. Mutant cells lacking the novel antigen were efficiently isolated by an enrichment method involving magnetic antibodies. Mutant strains defective in the novel antigen contained normal lipopolysaccharide. One of these mutants was affected in neither its ability to adhere to sterile potato root pieces nor its ability to colonize potato roots. We conclude that the bacterial cell surface of P. putida WCS358 contains at least two different polysaccharide structures. These are the O-specific polysaccharide of lipopolysaccharide, which is relevant for potato root colonization, and the novel polysaccharide, which is not involved in adhesion to or colonization of the potato root.
TI  - Use of an ipb-lux Fusion To Study Regulation of the Isopropylbenzene Catabolism Operon of Pseudomonas putida RE204 and To Detect Hydrophobic Pollutants in the Environment.
AB  - A DNA segment involved in the regulation of the isopropylbenzene (cumene) catabolism operon (ipb) of plasmid pRE4 from Pseudomonas putida RE204 and the Vibrio fischeri luciferase genes, luxCDABE, were used to create an ipbRo/pA(prm1)-luxCDABE reporter fusion plasmid, pOS25. Escherichia coli HMS174(pOS25) produces light in the presence of inducers of the ipb operon. These inducers were shown to be hydrophobic compounds and to include monoalkylbenzenes, substituted benzenes and toluenes, some alkanes and cycloalkanes, chlorinated solvents, and naphthalenes. Complex hydrocarbon mixtures, such as gasoline, diesel fuel, jet fuels (JP-4 and JP-5), and creosote, were also inducers of ipb-lux. Bacteria carrying the ipb-lux reporter may be useful as bioindicators of hydrocarbon pollution in the environment and may be particularly valuable for examining the bioavailability of inducing pollutants.
TI  - Cloning and characterization of the Alcaligenes eutrophus 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex.
AB  - Nucleotide sequence analysis of a 3.3-kb genomic EcoRI fragment and of relevant subfragments of a genomic 13.2-kb SmaI fragment of Alcaligenes eutrophus, which were identified by using a dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase-specific DNA probe, revealed the structural genes of the 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex in a 7.5-kb genomic region. The genes odhA (2850 bp), odhB (1248 bp), and odhL (1422 bp), encoding 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase (E1), dihydrolipoamide succinyltransferase (E2), and dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (E3), respectively, occur co-linearly in one gene cluster downstream of a putative -35/-10 promoter in the order odhA, odhB, and odhL. In comparison to other bacteria, the occurrence of genes for two E3 components for the pyruvate as well as for the 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complexes is unique. Heterologous expression of the A. eutrophus odh genes in E. coli XL1-Blue and in the kgdA mutant Pseudomonas putida JS347 was demonstrated by the occurrence of protein bands in electropherograms, by spectrometric detection of enzyme activities, and by phenotypic complementation, respectively.
TI  - sigma54-dependent transcription of the Pseudomonas putida xylS operon is influenced by the IIANtr protein of the phosphotransferase system in Escherichia coli.
AB  - IIANtr, encoded within the rpoN operons of many Gram-negative bacteria, is a homologue of a class of phosphoryl transfer proteins of the phosphoenolpyruvate: sugar phosphotransferase system. We have used a xylS operon-lacZ fusion from the TOL plasmid of Pseudomonas putida to show that IIANtr influences sigma 54-dependent transcription when the xylS operon is expressed in Escherichia coli. Loss of IIANtr influences, but does not abolish cyclic AMP-independent carbon catabolite repression.
TI  - Identification of TonB homologs in the family Enterobacteriaceae and evidence for conservation of TonB-dependent energy transduction complexes.
AB  - The transport of Fe(III)-siderophore complexes and vitamin B12 across the outer membrane of Escherichia coli requires the TonB-dependent energy transduction system. A set of murine monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) was generated against an E. coli TrpC-TonB fusion protein to facilitate structure and function studies. In the present study, the epitopes recognized by these MAbs were mapped, and their distribution in gram-negative organisms was examined. Cross-species reactivity patterns obtained against TonB homologs of known sequence were used to refine epitope mapping, with some epitopes ultimately confirmed by inhibition experiments using synthetic polypeptides. Epitopes recognized by this set of MAbs were conserved in TonB homologs for 9 of 12 species in the family Enterobacteriaceae (including E. coli), including previously unidentified TonB homologs in Shigella, Citrobacter, Proteus, and Kluyvera species. These homologs were also detected by a polyclonal alpha-TrpC-TonB serum that additionally recognized the known Yersinia enterocolitica TonB homolog and a putative TonB homolog in Edwardsiella tarda. These antibody preparations failed to detect the known TonB homologs of either Pseudomonas putida or Haemophilus influenzae but did identify potential TonB homologs in several other nonenteric gram-negative species. In vivo chemical cross-linking experiments demonstrated that in addition to TonB, auxiliary components of the TonB-dependent energy transduction system are broadly conserved in members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, suggesting that the TonB system represents a common system for high-affinity active transport across the gram-negative outer membrane.
TI  - The Pseudomonas putida peptidoglycan-associated outer membrane lipoprotein is involved in maintenance of the integrity of the cell cell envelope.
AB  - Pseudomonas putida 14G-3, a derivative of the natural soil inhabitant P. putida KT2440, exhibited a chromosomal insertion of a mini-Tn5/'phoA transposon that resulted in reduced ability to colonize soil. In vitro characterization of P. putida 14G-3 revealed that it exhibited an altered cell morphology and envelope, as revealed by electron microscopy. The derived strain was sensitive to sodium dodecyl sulfate, deoxycholate, and EDTA, produced clumps when it reached high cell densities in the late logarithmic growth phase, and did not grow on low-osmolarity medium. The P. putida DNA surrounding the mini-Tn5/'phoA insertion was cloned and used as a probe to rescue the wild-type gene, which was sequenced. Comparison of the deduced peptide sequence with sequences in the Swiss-Prot database allowed the knocked-out gene to be identified as that encoding the peptidoglycan-associated lipoprotein (Pal or OprL) of P. putida. The protein was identified in coupled transcription and translation assays in vitro.
TI  - Identification of a partition and replication region in the Alcaligenes eutrophus megaplasmid pMOL28.
AB  - A 4.64 kb region of the 180 kb heavy metal resistance plasmid pMOL28 of Alcaligenes eutrophus CH34, previously shown to be able to replicate autonomously, was sequenced and analyzed. Three genes involved in plasmid maintenance were identified: parA28 and parB28 are involved in plasmid partitioning and stability, while repA28 encodes a protein required for replication. In addition to the par AB28 genes, a third locus, parS28, required in cis active partitioning was identified. The parABS28 locus of pMOL28 shows strong similarity in organization to the sop, par and rep regions, respectively, of the Escherichia coli F-factor, the E.coli P1 and P7 prophages and the Agrobacterium pTiB6S3 and pRiA4b plasmids. The ParAB28 proteins of pMOL28 also show similarity to the proteins encoded by two conserved open reading frames present in the replication regions of the Pseudomonas putida and Bacillus subtilis chromosomes. The functionality of the pMOL28 par region was examined by performing stability and incompatibility tests between pMOL28 and pMOL846 or pMOL850 which contain the 4.64 EcoRI replicon fragment of pMOL28, cloned in opposite orientations into pSUP202, which is itself unable to replicate in A. eutrophus. The RepA2 8 replication protein showed similarity to the RepL protein of P1, which is required for lytic replication of this E. coli phage. The replication origin of pMOL28, oriV28, seems to be located within the repA28 coding region, and pMOL28 replication may depend on transcriptional activation of oriV28.
TI  - The two-step lysis system of pneumococcal bacteriophage EJ-1 is functional in gram-negative bacteria: triggering of the major pneumococcal autolysin in Escherichia coli.
AB  - The holin function Ejh of the pneumococcal bacteriophage EJ-1 has been characterized. It shows structural features similar to, and functionally complemented, the prototype member of the holin family. In Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida the Ejh product caused cellular death, and changes in cell morphology could be accounted for by lesions in the cytoplasmic membrane. Expression of ejh resulted in the inhibition of growth in a variety of phylogenetically distant bacterial genera, suggesting a broad spectrum of action. Concomitant expression of the ejh and ejl (encodes a lysin) genes led to lysis of E. coli and P. putida cells. Remarkably, the Ejl lysin was able to attack murein from bacteria lacking choline in their sacculi, which suggests that pneumococcal lysins have a broader substrate specificity than previously assumed. Furthermore, the Ejh holin was able to trigger activity of the major pneumococcal autolysin cloned and expressed in E. coli, and this raised new questions about the regulation of this model autolysin. A new function for holins in systems where the phage lysin is supposed to be associated with the membrane is proposed.
TI  - Cloning and nucleotide sequence of a D,L-haloalkanoic acid dehalogenase encoding  gene from Alcaligenes xylosoxidans ssp. denitrificans ABIV.
AB  - We have cloned DNA fragments of plasmid pFL40 from Alcaligenes xylosoxidans ssp.  denitrificans ABIV encoding a D,L-2-haloalkanoic acid halidohydrolase (DhlIV). A 6.5-kb EcoRI/SalI-fragment with inducible expression of the halidohydrolase was cloned in Pseudomonas fluorescens and Escherichia coli. A 1.9-kb HindII-fragment demonstrated expression of the dehalogenase only due to the presence of the promoter from the pUC vector in Escherichia coli. The nucleotide sequence of this DNA-fragment was determined. It had an open reading frame coding for 296 amino acid residues (molecular weight of 32783 D). The dhlIV gene showed sequence homology to a short segment of a D-specific dehalogenase (hadD) from Pseudomonas putida AJ1, but not to any other known DNA sequences. Restriction enzyme patterns indicated similarity between dhlIV and the D,L- isomer specific dehl dehalogenase gene from Pseudomonas putida PP3. There are some indications from restriction enzyme patterns and initial sequencing data, that a gene encoding a sigma 54-dependent activator protein, similar to the dehRI regulatory gene from Pseudomonas putida PP3 is located upstream of dhlIV. In contrast to DehI, dehalogenation of D- or L-chloropropionic acid by the DhlIV-protein leads to lactic acid of inverted configuration.
TI  - Involvement of sigma 54 in exponential silencing of the Pseudomonas putida TOL plasmid Pu promoter.
AB  - The sigma 54-dependent Pu promoter of the TOL plasmid pWW0 of Pseudomonas putida  becomes activated by the prokaryotic enhancer-binding XyIR protein when cells encounter m-xylene in the medium. However, even in the presence of the aromatic inducer, Pu activity is silenced in vivo during rapid exponential growth of the cells in rich medium. Various elements known to be involved in the control of the transcriptional activity of the promoter were examined to ascertain the mechanism by which expression of Pu is limited during the exponential phase of growth. A truncated and fully constitutive XyIR derivative deleted of its signal-reception N-terminal domain was found to be subjected to the same exponential silencing as the wild-type XyIR when exposed to m-xylene. This indicated that the phenomenon is not due to a late activation of XyIR by the aromatic effector. A Pu variant in which the integration host factor (IHF)-binding site had been functionally replaced by a statically curved DNA segment showed the same induction pattern, thus ruling out variations in the intracellular levels of IHF changes during growth as the element responsible for the inactivity of Pu in rapidly growing cells. On the contrary, overproduction of the sigma 54 factor allowed Pu expression during exponential phase. As sigma 54 protein levels remained approximately constant during growth, the exponential silencing of Pu could be caused ultimately by changes in the activity of the factor itself. This effect may not be exclusive to Pu, but could be a general co-regulation mechanism in sigma 54-dependent promoters that connects transcription of a specific set of genes with the general physiological status of the cells.
TI  - A transposon for green fluorescent protein transcriptional fusions: application for bacterial transport experiments.
AB  - The movement of bacteria through groundwater is a poorly understood process. Factors such as soil porosity and mineralogy, heterogeneity of soil particle size, and response of the bacteria to their environment contribute to the pattern of bacterial flow. The identification of transported bacteria is often a limiting factor in both laboratory and field transport experiments. Two bacterial strains were modified for use in bacterial transport experiments: a strain of Escherichia coli harboring the pGFP plasmid and a strain of Pseudomonas putida modified with a Tn5 derivative, Tn5GFP1. The Tn5GFP1 transposon incorporates the gene (gfp) encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP) and can be used to mutagenize Gram-bacteria. Fluorescent colonies were suspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at a concentration of approx. 10(9) bacteria/ml. A 10-cm glass column packed with quartz sand (diameter range 177-250 microns) was equilibrated with PBS prior to the forced flow introduction of the bacteria. Collected fractions were analyzed and the bacteria quantitated using a fluorescence spectrometer. Results demonstrate that the bacteria can be accurately tracked using their fluorescence, and that the intensity of the signal can be used to determine a C/Co ratio for the transported bacteria. The data show a rapid breakthrough of the bacteria followed by a characteristic curve pattern. A lower limit of detection of 10(5) cells was estimated based on these experiments. The Tn5GFP1 transposon should become a valuable tool for labeling bacteria.
TI  - Nondisruptive detection of activity of catabolic promoters of Pseudomonas putida  with an antigenic surface reporter system.
AB  - A simple procedure to detect the switching on and off of catabolic promoters of Pseudomonas putida, at the level of single cells based on the immunodetection of a reporter epitope expressed on the surface of bacterial cells, has been developed. To do this, the antigenic sequence Asp-Leu-Pro-Pro-Asn-Ser-Asp-Val-Val-Asp, from a coronavirus, was inserted genetically in the permissive site around amino acid position 153 of the LamB protein (maltose and lambda phage receptor) of Escherichia coli. When the hybrid lamB gene is transcribed, the epitope becomes presented on the surface of the bacterial cells in a configuration available to specific antibodies. To validate this notion in nonenteric bacteria, the expression and correct processing of LamB were confirmed by coupling the lamB gene to the salicylate-responsive Psa1 promoter of the NAH7 (naphthalene degradation) plasmid in Pseudomonas putida. Subsequently, a hybrid lamB gene carrying the sequence of the coronavirus antigen was placed downstream of the m-toluate-responsive Pm promoter of the TOL (toluene degradation) plasmid. Exposure of the epitope on the Pseudomonas cell surface was monitored through fluorescence of whole cells treated with a monoclonal antibody against the heterologous antigen. Fluorescence emission was dependent on the presence of m-toluate in the medium, thus permitting detection of the Pm promoter switching on by simple optical inspection of individual cells, even in situations when these are a very minor component of a complex bacterial community.
TI  - Cloning and characterization of styrene catabolism genes from Pseudomonas fluorescens ST.
AB  - A gene bank from Pseudomonas fluorescens ST was constructed in the broad-host-range cosmid pLAFR3 and mobilized into Pseudomonas putida PaW340. Identification of recombinant cosmids containing the styrene catabolism genes was performed by screening transconjugants for growth on styrene and epoxystyrene. Transposon mutagenesis and subcloning of one of the selected genome fragments have led to the identification of three enzymatic activities: a monooxygenase activity encoded by a 3-kb PstI-EcoRI fragment and an epoxystyrene isomerase activity and an epoxystyrene reductase activity encoded by a 2.3-kb BamHI fragment. Escherichia coli clones containing the 3-kb PstI-EcoRI fragment were able to transform styrene into epoxystyrene, and those containing the 2.3-kb BamHI fragment converted epoxystyrene into phenylacetaldehyde or, only in the presence of glucose, into 2-phenylethanol. The three genes appear to be clustered and are probably encoded by the same DNA strand. In E. coli, expression of the epoxystyrene reductase gene was under the control of its own promoter, whereas the expression of the other two genes was dependent on the presence of an external vector promoter.
TI  - Molecular characterization of the 4-hydroxyphenylacetate catabolic pathway of Escherichia coli W: engineering a mobile aromatic degradative cluster.
AB  - We have determined and analyzed the nucleic acid sequence of a 14,855-bp region that contains the complete gene cluster encoding the 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (4-HPA) degradative pathway of Escherichia coli W (ATCC 11105). This catabolic pathway is composed by 11 genes, i.e., 8 enzyme-encoding genes distributed in two putative operons, hpaBC (4-HPA hydroxylase operon) and hpaGEDFHI (meta-cleavage operon); 2 regulatory genes, hpaR and hpaA; and the gene, hpaX, that encodes a protein related to the superfamily of transmembrane facilitators and appears to be cotranscribed with hpaA. Although comparisons with other aromatic catabolic pathways revealed interesting similarities, some of the genes did not present any similarity to their corresponding counterparts in other pathways, suggesting different evolutionary origins. The cluster is flanked by two genes homologous to the estA (carbon starvation protein) and tsr (serine chemoreceptor) genes of E. coli K-12. A detailed genetic analysis of this region has provided a singular example of how E. coli becomes adapted to novel nutritional sources by the recruitment of a catabolic cassette. Furthermore, the presence of the pac gene in the proximity of the 4-HPA cluster suggests that the penicillin G acylase was a recent acquisition to improve the ability of E. coli W to metabolize a wider range of substrates, enhancing its catabolic versatility. Five repetitive extragenic palindromic sequences that might be involved in transcriptional regulation were found within the cluster. The complete 4-HPA cluster was cloned in plasmid and transposon cloning vectors that were used to engineer E. coli K-12 strains able to grow on 4-HPA. We report here also the in vitro design of new biodegradative capabilities through the construction of a transposable cassette containing the wide substrate range 4-HPA hydroxylase, in order to expand the ortho-cleavage pathway of Pseudomonas putida KT2442 and allow the new recombinant strain to use phenol as the only carbon source.
TI  - The cytochrome subunit is necessary for covalent FAD attachment to the flavoprotein subunit of p-cresol methylhydroxylase.
AB  - When p-cresol methylhydroxylase (PCMH) is expressed in its natural host Pseudomonas putida, or when the genes of the alpha and beta subunits of the enzyme are expressed together in the heterologous host Escherichia coli, flavin-adenine dinucleotide (FAD) is covalently attached to Tyr384 of the alpha subunit and the correct alpha 2 beta 2 form of the enzyme is assembled. The apoflavoprotein has been expressed in E. coli in the absence of the beta cytochrome c subunit and purified. While noncovalent FAD binding to apoflavoprotein in the absence of the cytochrome subunit could not be directly demonstrated, circumstantial evidence suggests that this indeed occurs. Covalent flavinylation requires one molecule each of FAD and cytochrome for each flavoprotein subunit. The flavinylation process leads to the 2-electron-reduced form of covalently bound FAD, and the resulting alpha 2 beta 2 enzyme is identical to wild-type PCMH. This work presents clear evidence that covalent flavinylation occurs by a self-catalytic mechanism; an external enzyme or chaperon is not required, nor is prior chemical activation of FAD or of the protein. This work is the first to define the basic chemistry of covalent flavinylation of an enzyme to produce the normal, active species, and confirms a long standing, postulated chemical mechanism of this process. It also demonstrates, for the first time, the absolute requirement for a partner subunit in the post-translational modification of a protein. It is proposed that the covalent FAD bond to Tyr384 and the phenolic portion of this Tyr are part of the essential electron transfer path from FAD to heme.
TI  - Modeling simultaneous hexavalent chromium reduction and phenol degradation by a defined coculture of bacteria.
AB  - Based on the kinetics of Cr(VI) reduction by Escherichia coli ATCC 33456 and phenol degradation by Pseudomonas putida DMP-1, a mathematical model is developed to describe simultaneous Cr(VI) reduction and phenol degradation in the coculture of the two species. The developed model incorporates the toxicity effects of Cr(VI) and phenol on phenol degradation and Cr(VI) reduction in the coculture. The model illustrates the inhibitory effects of phenol on Cr(VI) reduction and Cr(VI) toxicity toward phenol degradation. The model also reveals the recoveries of the activities of the repressed bacterial cells with continuous Cr(VI) reduction and phenol degradation in the coculture. The model is capable of predicting simultaneous Cr(VI) reduction and phenol degradation within a broad range of Cr(VI) and phenol concentrations and under an appropriate composition of populations. However, the model simulates lower concentrations of phenol than experimental observations once Cr(VI) is reduced to a low level (<7 mg/L). The model simulation for Cr(VI) also deviates from experimental data when P. putida is outnumbered by E. coli by a ratio of 1:5. (c) 1995 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.
TI  - Bacterial morphinone reductase is related to Old Yellow Enzyme.
AB  - Morphinone reductase, produced by Pseudomonas putida M10, catalyses the NADH-dependent saturation of the carbon-carbon double bond of morphinone and codeinone, and is believed to be involved in the metabolism of morphine and codeine. The structural gene encoding morphinone reductase, designated morB, was cloned from Ps. putida M10 genomic DNA by the use of degenerate oligonucleotide probes based on elements of the amino acid sequence of the purified enzyme. Sequence analysis and structural characteristics indicated that morphinone reductase is related to the flavoprotein alpha/beta-barrel oxidoreductases, and is particularly similar to Old Yellow Enzyme of Saccharomyces spp. and the related oestrogen-binding protein of Candida albicans. Expressed sequence tags from several plant species show high homology to these enzymes, suggesting the presence of a family of enzymes conserved in plants and fungi. Although related bacterial proteins are known, morphinone reductase appears to be more similar to the eukaryotic proteins. Morphinone reductase was overexpressed in Escherichia coli, and has potential applications for the industrial preparation of semisynthetic opiates.
TI  - Dissection of the core and auxiliary sequences in the vegetative replication origin of promiscuous plasmid RK2.
AB  - The vegetative replication origin (oriV) of promiscuous IncP plasmid RK2 can function in many Gram-negative bacterial species when supplied with the plasmid-encoded replication protein TrfA and host-encoded replication proteins including DnaA. Nine TrfA binding sites (iterons) are known, and also two DnaA binding sites, box 1, between TrfA iterons 4 and 5, and box 2, downstream of repeat 9. The deletion analysis presented here shows that the core oriV requires DnaA box 1 for function in Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida. This DnA box is not essential in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, although its deletion does reduce plasmid copy number in this species. A putative IHF binding site is located upstream of DnaA box 1, but IHF deficiency in E. coli seems not to alter replication efficiency or copy number control. Cloned oriV can interfere with maintenance of an independent RK2 replicon. Analysis of replication inhibition functions associated with oriV showed that a short putative orf between TrfA iterons 1 and 2 is not necessary for replication inhibition, the presence of repeats 5 to 9 in target and inhibitor plasmid are not sufficient for efficient inhibition and inhibition does not correlate directly with the number of direct repeats present. Rather, the results showed that the isolated repeats 1 and 2 to 4, potentiate replication inhibition disproportionately to their effect on the number of TrfA binding sites. The results are consistent with the idea that repeats 1 to 4, arranged as a single copy and as an irregular group of three, potentiate the ability of the oriV region to form complexes which inhibit replication. We suggest that TrfA bound at these iterons may be more susceptible to forming pairs between oriV sequences on different plasmids.
TI  - Role of sigma S in transcription from the positively controlled Pm promoter of the TOL plasmid of Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - Transcription from the TOL plasmid Pm promoter is dependent on the XylS regulator activated by benzoate effectors. We analysed transcription from Pm in several backgrounds with differing Escherichia coli alpha and sigma subunits of RNA polymerase. In different RpoA backgrounds, transcription from Pm was as high as in the wild-type background throughout the growth curve. In the sigma S-deficient background provided by E. coli RH90, high levels of transcription from Pm (XylS/3-methylbenzoate dependent) were observed in the early logarithmic growth phase but not in the late logarithmic phase or early stationary phase. This contrasted with the results obtained in the isogenic sigma S-proficient background, in which high levels of transcription were observed throughout the growth curve. XylS/3-methylbenzoate-dependent transcription from Pm in the late logarithmic growth phase in the RH90 background was restored by cloned rpoS. The transcription initiation point of Pm was the same regardless of the growth phase and the sigma S background. The requirement of sigma S for stimulation of transcription from Pm in the late logarithmic and early stationary phase was overcome by using certain mutant Pm promoters, e.g. Pm5 (C-47-->G, A-44-->G), and the mutant regulator XylSG44S. It is suggested that the transcription from Pm involves the use of two sigma factors: sigma 70 during the early logarithmic phase and sigma S thereafter.
TI  - Flow cytometric detection of specific genes in genetically modified bacteria using in situ polymerase chain reaction.
AB  - Use of the polymerase chain reaction, coupled with flow cytometry, to detect a plasmid encoded xylE gene sequence in intact cells of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida was investigated. Optimal incorporation of fluorescently labelled dUTP into a full length PCR product required substitution at a level of 2:3 dUTP:dTTP. Formaldehyde fixed cells of both species were counted before and after thermal cycling. Sufficient numbers of cells remained intact for subsequent detection using microscopy and flow cytometry but light scatter properties were altered. Intact cell suspensions of both species containing plasmid pLV1013 were subjected to thermal cycling with fluorescent dUTP in the reaction mix. Subsequent analysis by flow cytometry allowed detection of a fluorescent PCR product associated with cells. Control samples (without the plasmid) showed only background fluorescence. This method demonstrates the potential for applying DNA amplification methods for sensitive detection of specific sequences localized inside intact bacterial cells.
TI  - Formation of indigo and related compounds from indolecarboxylic acids by aromatic acid-degrading bacteria: chromogenic reactions for cloning genes encoding dioxygenases that act on aromatic acids.
AB  - The p-cumate-degrading strain Pseudomonas putida F1 and the m- and p-toluate-degrading strain P. putida mt-2 transform indole-2-carboxylate and indole-3-carboxylate to colored products identified here as indigo, indirubin, and isatin. A mechanism by which these products could be formed spontaneously following dioxygenase-catalyzed dihydroxylation of the indolecarboxylates is proposed. Indolecarboxylates were employed as chromogenic substrates for identifying recombinant bacteria carrying genes encoding p-cumate dioxygenase and toluate dioxygenase. Dioxygenase gene-carrying bacteria could be readily distinguished as dark green-blue colonies among other colorless recombinant Escherichia coli colonies on selective agar plates containing either indole-2-carboxylate or indole-3-carboxylate.
TI  - Determination of cadmium in biological and environmental samples by slurry electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry.
AB  - The retention of cadmium by the bacteria Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida  was optimized in order to develop a rapid and selective preconcentration method for cadmium from biological and environmental samples prior to determination by electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry. Living and lyophilized cells for both bacteria were used, but the method using dead cells shows better analytical capabilities. Cadmium from aqueous solutions is easily retained on the outer membrane of both bacteria in the pH range 4-10, although the selected working pHs for E. coli and P. putida were 5 and 9, respectively. Cadmium retained by the bacteria was dispersed in 3.5 M nitric acid and the slurry was introduced directly into the graphite tube. The best sensitivity and detection limit were obtained for E. coli (0.03 ng ml(-1) and 0.04 ng ml(-1) respectively, in the absence of any chemical modifier). A strong spectral interference from nickel chloride was found and methods to overcome it were developed. The proposed extraction procedure was tested by the determination of cadmium in different standard biological and environmental samples.
TI  - In situ PCR for visualization of microscale distribution of specific genes and gene products in prokaryotic communities.
AB  - Obtaining information on the genetic capabilities and phylogenetic affinities of  individual prokaryotic cells within natural communities is a high priority in the fields of microbial ecology, microbial biogeochemistry, and applied microbiology, among others. A method for prokaryotic in situ PCR (PI-PCR), a technique which will allow single cells within complex mixtures to be identified and characterized genetically, is presented here. The method involves amplification of specific nuclei acid sequences inside intact prokaryotic cells followed by color or fluorescence detection of the localized PCR product via bright-field or epifluorescence microscopy. Prokaryotic DNA and mRNA were both used successfully as targets for PI-PCR. We demonstrate the use of PI-PCR to identify nahA-positive cells in mixtures of bacterial isolates and in model marine bacterial communities.
TI  - Purification of active E1 alpha 2 beta 2 of Pseudomonas putida branched-chain-oxoacid dehydrogenase.
AB  - Active E1 component of Pseudomonas putida branched-chain-oxoacid dehydrogenase was purified from P. putida strains carrying pJRS84 which contains bkdR (encoding the transcriptional activator) and bkdA1 and bkdA2 (encoding the alpha and beta subunits). Expression was inducible, however, 45-, 39- and 37-kDa proteins were produced instead of the expected 45-kDa and 37-kDa proteins. The 45-kDa protein was identified as E1 alpha and the 37-kDa and 39-kDa proteins were identified as separate translational products of bkdA2 by their N-terminal sequences. The N-terminal amino acid of the 39-kDa protein was leucine instead of methionine. The 45-, 39- and 37-kDa proteins were also produced in wild-type P.putida. Translation of bkdA1 and bkdA2 from an Escherichia coli expression plasmid produced only 45-kDa and 39-kDa proteins, with N-terminal methionine on the 39-kDa protein. The insertion of guanine residues 5' to the first ATG of bkdA2 did not affect expression of E1 beta in P. putida including the N-terminal leucine which appears to eliminate the possibility of ribosome jumping. The Z-average molecular mass of the E1 component was determined by sedimentation equilibrium to be 172 +/- 9 kDa compared to a calculated value of 166 kDa for the heterotetramer and a Stokes radius of 5.1 nm. E1 alpha Ser313, which is homologous to the phosphorylated residue of rat liver E1 alpha, was converted to alanine resulting in about a twofold increase in Km, but no change in Kcat. S315A and S319A mutations had no effect on Km or Kcat indicating that these residues do not play a major part in catalysis of E1 alpha beta 2.
TI  - Sequence and expression of the bpdC1C2BADE genes involved in the initial steps of biphenyl/chlorobiphenyl degradation by Rhodococcus sp. M5.
AB  - The nucleotide (nt) sequence of the bpdC1C2BADE genes which encode the first three enzymes in the biphenyl (BP) degradation pathway of Gram+ Rhodococcus sp. M5 (formerly Arthrobacter M5) was determined. Except for the ferredoxin component (BpdB) of the initial BP dioxygenase, the predicted amino acid (aa) sequences of the remaining proteins are found to be more closely related to the counterpart proteins (TodC1C2BADE) present in the toluene-degrader, Pseudomonas putida F1, than those of three BP-degrading pseudomonads. The cloned bpd genes were verified by their expression in the Escherichia coli T7 RNA polymerase/promoter system. In E. coli, BpdA was able to complement TodC1C2B in indigo biosynthesis, although the M5 native or cloned BP dioxygenase does not carry out this reaction.
TI  - Desaturation and oxygenation of 1,2-dihydronaphthalene by toluene and naphthalene dioxygenase.
AB  - Bacterial strains expressing toluene and naphthalene dioxygenase were used to examine the sequence of reactions involved in the oxidation of 1,2-dihydronaphthalene. Toluene dioxygenase of Pseudomonas putida F39/D oxidizes 1,2-dihydronaphthalene to (+)-cis-(1S,2R)-dihydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene, (+)-(1R)-hydroxy-1,2-dihydronaphthalene, and (+)-cis-(1R,2S)-dihydroxy-1,2-dihydronaphthalene. In contrast, naphthalene dioxygenase of Pseudomonas sp. strain NCIB 9816/11 oxidizes 1,2-dihydronaphthalene to the opposite enantiomer, (-)-cis-(1R,2S)-dihydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene and the identical (+)-cis-(1R,2S)-dihydroxy-1,2-dihydronaphthalene. Recombinant Escherichia coli strains expressing the structural genes for toluene and naphthalene dioxygenases confirmed the involvement of these enzymes in the reactions catalyzed by strains F39/D and NCIB 9816/11. 1-Hydroxy-1,2-dihydronaphthalene was not formed by strains expressing naphthalene dioxygenase. These results coupled with time course studies and deuterium labelling experiments indicate that, in addition to direct dioxygenation of the olefin, both enzymes have the ability to desaturate (dehydrogenate) 1,2-dihydronaphthalene to naphthalene, which serves as a substrate for cis dihydroxylation.
TI  - The use of two-dimensional gradient plates to investigate the range of conditions under which conjugal plasmid transfer occurs.
AB  - Gel-stabilized two-dimensional gradient plates were used to study the effects of  pH, salt concentration and temperature on the conjugal transfer of plasmid RP4 between strains of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida. The combinations of pH and salt concentration that permitted conjugation were mapped as a two-dimensional growth area occupied by transconjugants following conjugation. This conjugation domain was less extensive than the areas that supported growth of the parental strains, and showed evidence for the interactive effects of pH and salt concentration in determination of conditions that permitted conjugation. The size and shape of the conjugation domain was influenced by time, temperature, the identities of the donor and recipient bacteria, and the combination of donor and recipient bacteria.
TI  - Production of Pseudomonas aeruginosa Rhamnolipid Biosurfactants in Heterologous Hosts.
AB  - The high-level production of rhamnolipid biosurfactants is a unique feature of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and is strictly regulated in response to environmental conditions. The final step in rhamnolipid biosynthesis is catalyzed by the rhlAB genes encoding a rhamnosyltransferase. The expression of the cloned rhlAB genes was studied in heterologous hosts, either under the control of the rhlR and rhlI rhamnolipid regulatory elements or under the control of the tac promoter. A recombinant P. fluorescens strain harboring multiple plasmid-encoded copies of the rhamnolipid gene cluster produced rhamnolipids (0.25 g liter(sup-1)) when grown under nitrogen-limiting conditions. The highest yields (0.6 g liter(sup-1)) and productivities (24 mg liter(sup-1) h(sup-1)) were obtained in a recombinant Pseudomonas putida strain, KT2442, harboring promoterless rhlAB genes fused to the tac promoter on a plasmid. Active rhamnosyltransferase was synthesized, but no rhamnolipids were produced, by recombinant Escherichia coli upon induction of rhlAB gene expression.
TI  - [Features of oral cavity microflora in congenital cleft lip and palate].
AB  - Cheilloschisis and uranoschisis are the most important congenital defects in children. This pathology increases the incidence of purulent inflammatory affections due to Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli. The isolates were found to have multiple drug resistance determined by R plasmids of different incompatibility groups. The molecular weights of the plasmids were: 3.0, 8.0 and 9.0 MD in Staphylococcus spp., 90.0 and 110.0 MD in P. aeruginosa and P. putida, 33.0, 38.0, 49.0 and 53.0 MD in E. coli. 87.0 per cent of the Staphylococcus strains, 78.9 per cent of the Streptococcus strains, 83.3 per cent of the E. coli strains, 74.0 per cent of the P. aeruginosa strains and 66.6 per cent of the Acinetobacter stains were shown to be sensitive to the commercial pyophage product used in the study.
TI  - Growth phase-dependent induction of stationary-phase promoters of Escherichia coli in different gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - RSF1010-derived plasmids carrying a fusion of a promoterless lacZ gene with the sigma s-dependent growth phase-regulated promoters of Escherichia coli, bolAp1 and fic, were constructed. The plasmids were mobilized into the gram-negative bacterial species Acetobacter methanolicus, Xanthomonas campestris, Pseudomonas putida, and Rhizobium meliloti. The beta-galactosidase activities of bacterial cultures were determined during exponential and stationary growth phases. Transcriptional activation of the fic promoter in the different bacteria was growth phase dependent as in E. coli and was initiated generally during the transition to stationary phase. The induction of the bolA promoter was also growth phase dependent in the bacteria tested. While the expression in E. coli and R. meliloti was initiated during the transition from exponential to stationary phase, the induction in A. methanolicus, P. putida, and X. campestris started some hours after stationary growth phase was reached. In all the species tested, DNA fragments hybridizing with the rpoS gene of E. coli were detected. The results show that in different gram-negative bacteria, stationary-phase-specific sigma factors which are structurally and functionally homologous to sigma s and are able to recognize the promoter sequences of both bolA and fic exist.
TI  - Use of haloacetate dehalogenase genes as selection markers for Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas vectors.
AB  - The haloacetate dehalogenase gene, dehH2, cloned from Moraxella sp. strain B could be used a selection marker gene for vectors in Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida. Haloacetates, especially iodoacetate, inhibit the growth of some microorganisms. The dehH2 gene introduced into the cells conferred iodoacetate resistance on them. Therefore, E. coli and P. putida transformed with vectors marked with dehH2 could be easily selected on plates containing iodoacetate.
TI  - Cloning, DNA sequencing, and amino acid sequencing of catechol 1,2-dioxygenases (pyrocatechase) from Pseudomonas putida mt-2 and Pseudomonas arvilla C-1.
AB  - Catechol 1,2-dioxygenase catalyzes the oxygenative ring cleavage of catechol to form cis,cis-muconic acid and is encoded by a catA gene. We have cloned a catA gene from Pseudomonas putida mt-2 using a PCR product of amino acid sequence-based primers as a probe. The amino acid sequence deduced from the 930 nucleotides was in complete agreement with the chemically determined sequence of the protein. Crude extracts of Escherichia coli cells carrying the catA gene downstream from the lac promoter showed the enzyme activity. By using the same probe, we also cloned and sequenced the catA beta gene for catechol 1,2-dioxygenase isozyme beta beta from Pseudomonas arvilla C-1, which has three isozymes, alpha alpha, alpha beta, and beta beta (C. Nakai, H. Horiike, S. Kuramitsu, H. Kagamiyama, and M. Nozaki, 1990, J. Biol. Chem. 265, 660-665). There was very high homology between isozyme beta beta of the C-1 strain and the enzyme of the mt-2 strain in both the amino acid (98%) and the DNA sequences (97%). A preference for the use of codons terminating in C and G was found in the coding region of both the enzymes, which contributed to the high G + C content (65-66%) of the genes. A comparison of the DNA sequences of various catA genes from other sources revealed their common ancestry, whereas a comparison of the amino acid sequences of the enzymes revealed clear reflection of substrate specificity. Tyrosyl and histidyl residues for proposed ligands of ferric ion are conserved in all catechol 1,2-dioxygenases.
TI  - Construction and behavior of biologically contained bacteria for environmental applications in bioremediation.
AB  - The survival of microorganisms can be predicted through the use of active biological containment systems. We have constructed contained Pseudomonas putida strains that degrade alkylbenzoates. The modified strain carries a fusion of the Plac promoter to the gef gene, which encodes a killing protein. Expression from Plac is controlled through a regulatory cascade, so that Plac is switched on or off by the absence or presence of alkylbenzoates, respectively. Similar uncontained strains were also constructed and tested as a control. Contained and uncontained strains were genetically stable, and their survival and functionality in soil microcosms were as expected. Both contained and uncontained strains survived well in soils supplemented with alkylaromatics, whereas survival of the contained strain in soil microcosms without methylbenzoates was markedly reduced, in contrast to the control strain, which survived in these soils in the absence of alkylbenzoates. The TOL plasmid was transferred in soils between Pseudomonas strains but was not able to mobilize the elements of the containment system.
TI  - Biological production of semisynthetic opiates using genetically engineered bacteria.
AB  - Semisynthetic derivatives of morphine and related alkaloids are in widespread clinical use. Due to the complexity of these molecules, however, chemical transformations are difficult to achieve in high yields. We recently identified the powerful analgesic hydromorphone as an intermediate in the metabolism of morphine by Pseudomonas putida M10. Here we describe the construction of recombinant strains of Escherichia coli that express morphine dehydrogenase and morphinone reductase. These strains are capable of efficiently transforming the naturally occurring alkaloids morphine and codeine to hydromorphone and the antitussive hydrocodone, respectively. Our results demonstrate the potential for recombinant DNA technology to provide biological routes for the synthesis of known and novel semisynthetic opiate drugs.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence of the gene for a thermostable esterase from Pseudomonas putida MR-2068.
AB  - The esterase gene (est) of Pseudomonas putida MR-2068 was cloned into Escherichia coli JM109. An 8-kb inserted DNA directed synthesis of an esterase in E. coli. The esterase gene was in a 1.1-kb PstI-ClaI fragment within the insert DNA. The complete nucleotides of the DNA fragment containing the esterase gene were sequenced and found to include a single open reading frame of 828 bp coding for a protein of 276 amino acid residues. The open reading frame was confirmed by N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis of the purified esterase. A potential Shine-Dalgarno sequence is followed by the open reading frame. The esterase activity of the recombinant E. coli was more than 200 times higher than that of parental strain, P. putida MR-2068.
TI  - Energy-coupled transport and signal transduction through the gram-negative outer  membrane via TonB-ExbB-ExbD-dependent receptor proteins.
AB  - Iron in the form of ferric siderophore complexes and vitamin B12 are transported  through the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria by a mechanism which consumes energy. There is no known energy source in the outer membrane or in the adjacent periplasmic space so that energy is provided by the electrochemical potential across the cytoplasmic membrane. Energy flows from the cytoplasmic into the outer membrane via a complex consisting of the TonB, ExbB and ExbD proteins which are anchored in the cytoplasmic membrane. It is proposed that the TonB--ExbB--ExbD complex opens--via an energized conformation of the TonB protein--channels in the outer membrane, formed by proteins which serves as highly specific binding sites for the various ferric siderophores and vitamin B12. In addition, outer membrane receptors together with the TonB--ExbB--ExbD complex are directly involved in induction of the transcription of ferric citrate and pseudobactin transport genes of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida, respectively.
TI  - Simultaneous chromium reduction and phenol degradation in a coculture of Escherichia coli ATCC 33456 and Pseudomonas putida DMP-1.
AB  - In a defined coculture of a Cr(VI) reducer, Escherichia coli ATCC 33456, and a phenol degrader, Pseudomonas putida DMP-1, simultaneous reduction of Cr(VI) and degradation of phenol was observed. When Cr(VI) was present in the coculture, quantitative transformation of Cr(VI) into Cr(III) proceeded with simultaneous degradation of phenol. Cr(VI) reduction was correlated to phenol degradation in the coculture as demonstrated by a regression analysis of the cumulative Cr(VI) reduction and the cumulative phenol degradation. Both the rate and extent of Cr(VI) reduction and phenol degradation were significantly influenced by the population composition of the coculture. Although Cr(VI) reduction occurred as a result of E. coli metabolism, the rate of phenol degradation by P. putida may become a rate-limiting factor for Cr(VI) reduction at a low population ratio of P. putida to E. coli. Phenol degradation by P. putida was very susceptible to the presence of Cr(VI), whereas Cr(VI) reduction by E. coli was significantly influenced by phenol only when phenol was present at high concentrations (> 9 mM).
TI  - Cloning of salicylate hydroxylase gene and catechol 2,3-dioxygenase gene and sequencing of an intergenic sequence between the two genes of Pseudomonas putida KF715.
AB  - The salicylate hydroxylase can convert the salicylate to catechol, and catechol 2,3-dioxygenase catalizes the conversion of catechol to 2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde. A salicylate hydroxylase gene and a catechol 2,3-dioxygenase have been cloned from chromosomal DNA of P. putida KF715. The two genes have different promoters. An open reading frame with 339 nucleotides preceded by a putative ribosome-binding sequence (GGAGG) was identified in the intergenic sequence between salicylate hydroxylase gene and catechol 2,3-dioxygenase gene of P. putida KF715 and its sequence analyzed. This open reading frame can encode a polypeptide of molecular weight 13 kDa containing 112 amino acids, whose sequence exhibited 87% homology with that of ferredoxin encoded in NAH7 of P. putida PpG7 and significant homology with those of redox components in phenol hydroxylase, benzoate 1,2-dioxygenase, toluate 1,2-dioxygenase, xylene monooxygenase, and toluene 4-monooxygenase.
TI  - Characterization of biphenyl catabolic genes of gram-positive polychlorinated biphenyl degrader Rhodococcus sp. strain RHA1.
AB  - Rhodococcus sp. strain RHA1 is a gram-positive polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) degrader which can degrade 10 ppm of PCB48 (equivalent to Aroclor1248), including tri-, tetra-, and pentachlorobiphenyls, in a few days. We isolated the 7.6-kb EcoRI-BamHI fragment carrying the biphenyl catabolic genes of RHA1 and determined their nucleotide sequence. On the basis of deduced amino acid sequence homology, we identified six bph genes, bphA1A2A3A4, bphB, and bphC, that are responsible for the initial three steps of biphenyl degradation. The order of bph genes in RHA1 is bphA1A2A3A4-bphC-bphB. This gene order differs from that of other PCB degraders reported previously. The amino acid sequences deduced from the RHA1 bph genes have a higher degree of homology with the tod genes from Pseudomonas putida F1 (49 to 79%) than with the bph genes of Pseudomonas sp. strains KF707 and KKS102 (30 to 65%). In Escherichia coli, bphA gene activity was not observed even when expression vectors were used. The activities of bphB and bphC, however, were confirmed by observing the transformation of biphenyl to a meta-cleavage compound with the aid of benzene dioxygenase activity that complemented the bphA gene activity (S. Irie, S. Doi, T. Yorifuji, M. Takagi, and K. Yano, J. Bacteriol. 169:5174-5179, 1987). The expected products of the cloned bph genes, except bphA3, were observed in E. coli in an in vitro transcription-translation system. Insertion mutations of bphA1 and bphC of Rhodococcus sp. strain RHA1 were constructed by gene replacement with cloned gene fragments.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Involvement of IHF protein in expression of the Ps promoter of the Pseudomonas putida TOL plasmid.
AB  - Regulation of the xyl gene operons of the Pseudomonas putida TOL plasmid is mediated by the products of the downstream clustered and divergently oriented xylR and xylS regulatory genes. The xylR-xylS intergenic region contains the xylR and xylS promoters Pr and Ps, respectively. A binding site for the XylR activator protein is located upstream of Ps and overlapping Pr. DNase I footprint experiments showed that one of these sites, which overlaps the recognition site for XylR activator, as well as an AT-rich region comprising the Ps promoter consensus were protected by integration host factor (IHF). IHF was found to act negatively in the in vivo activation of the Ps promoter, since the activity of a Ps promoter::lacZ fusion was elevated in an Escherichia coli mutant lacking IHF. In contrast, no alteration in the synthesis of XylR protein in the E. coli IHF-deficient mutant was detected.
TI  - Purification and characterization of a cam repressor (CamR) for the cytochrome P-450cam hydroxylase operon on the Pseudomonas putida CAM plasmid.
AB  - The cytochrome P-450cam hydroxylase operon of Pseudomonas putida PpG1 (ATCC 17543) encodes proteins responsible for early steps of the degradation of D-camphor. Transcription of this operon is negatively controlled by the cam repressor (CamR), and the expression of camR is autoregulated. CamR was purified from Escherichia coli harboring an overproducing plasmid. The repressor forms a homodimer with a molecular mass of 40 kDa, as judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis and gel filtration. CamR protected a specific DNA region from attack by DNase I. This region contains a palindromic operator of the cytochrome P-450cam hydroxylase operon and of the camR gene. Protection was inhibited by the addition of 60 microM D-camphor and also by certain camphor analogs and degradation products, including D-3-bromocamphor, adamantane, 2-adamantanone, 5-exo-hydroxycamphor, and 2,5-diketocamphane. These analogs and degradation products induced cytochrome P-450cam hydroxylase operon expression in vivo.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence of the Staphylococcus aureus RNA polymerase rpoB gene and comparison of its predicted amino acid sequence with those of other bacteria.
AB  - The complete nucleotide sequence of the rpoB gene which encodes the beta subunit  of S. aureus RNA polymerase has been determined. The RpoB protein, consists of 1182 amino acids and has a novel initiation codon UUG which initiates protein synthesis with methionine. There is a very strong Shine-Dalgarno complementarity and the -10 and -35 promoter hexameric sequences are TAATAT and CCGTTT, respectively. A rho-dependent termination site, CAATCAA, is present which overlaps the -35 promoter sequence of the adjacent rpoC gene a feature which may have a role in the co-ordinate expression of the two genes. A strong homology and conserved regions were found to exist over the predicted amino acid sequences coding for S. aureus rpoB and the equivalent proteins in Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas putida, Salmonella typhimurium, Chlamydia trachomatis, cyanobacterium Anabaena sp. strain PCC 7120.
TI  - Structural analysis of the L-methionine gamma-lyase gene from Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - The gene encoding L-methionine gamma-lyase from Pseudomonas putida was cloned and the primary structure of the enzyme was deduced from its nucleotide sequence. The L-methionine gamma-lyase gene was expressed in Escherichia coli. The amino acid sequences of BrCN-digested peptides agreed with the corresponding parts of the L-methionine gamma-lyase sequence determined from the gene structure. The polypeptide is composed of 398 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular weight of 42,626, corresponding to the subunit of the homotetrameric enzyme. The deduced amino acid sequence of L-methionine gamma-lyase only showed extensive homology with other well known alpha,gamma-elimination and/or gamma-replacement pyridoxal 5'-phosphate-dependent enzymes, such as cystathionine gamma-lyase, cystathionine gamma-synthase, and O-acetylhomoserine O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase, that participate in the biosynthesis of sulfur amino acids. However, the deduced essential cysteine residue of L-methionine gamma-lyase was not conserved in these enzymes. We confirmed the presence of a part of an open reading frame in the 3'-flanking region of the L-methionine gamma-lyase gene, which showed high homology with the N-terminal region of pyruvate dehydrogenase (lipoamide) from E. coli, suggesting that it participates in the degradative pathway for L-methionine together with L-methionine gamma-lyase.
TI  - A homolog of the Rhizobium meliloti nitrogen fixation gene fixN is involved in the production of a microaerobically induced oxidase activity in the phytopathogenic bacterium Agrobacterium tumefaciens.
AB  - Hybridization analysis using the Rhizobium meliloti nitrogen fixation gene fixN as a probe revealed the presence of a homologous DNA region in the phytopathogenic bacterium Agrobacterium tumefaciens. Hybridization signals were also detected with total DNAs of Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. phaseoli, Rhodobacter capsulatus and Escherichia coli, but not those of Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris and Pseudomonas putida. The hybridizing fragment from A. tumefaciens was cloned and sequenced. The predicted gene product of one of the two open reading frames identified on the sequenced fragment shows homology to FixN of different Rhizobiaceae as well as a low but significant similarity to subunit I of heme copper oxidases from various bacteria. The presence of five strictly conserved histidine residues previously implicated in forming ligands to heme and CuB in oxidases and the predicted membrane topology provide evidence that the A. tumefaciens fixN-like gene product is a component of the heme copper oxidase superfamily. The incomplete open reading frame starting only 8 nucleotides downstream of the fixN-like gene exhibits homology to Rhizobium fixO. Using an uidA (GUS) gene fusion it could be shown that the A. tumefaciens fixN-like gene is preferentially expressed under microaerobic conditions. Expression of the uidA fusion is abolished in R. meliloti fixJ and fixK mutants, indicating that an Fnr-like protein is involved in transcriptional regulation of the fixN-like gene in A. tumefaciens. The presence of an upstream DNA sequence motif identical to the Fnr-consensus binding site (anaerobox) further supports this hypothesis. A. tumefaciens mutated in the fixN-like gene shows decreased TMPD-specific oxidase activity under microaerobic conditions, indicating that the fixN-like gene or operon codes for proteins involved in respiration under reduced oxygen availability.
TI  - Characterization of the pTFI91-family replicon of Thiobacillus ferrooxidans plasmids.
AB  - Plasmids found in six strains of Thiobacillus ferrooxidans were mapped and compared in an effort to detect the origin of replication. Four strains yielded an identical 9.8-kb plasmid, pTFI91. Restriction mapping and Southern blot hybridization analysis were used to confirm this finding. Dissimilar plasmids found in two other strains contained a conserved 2.2-kb SacI region common to pTFI91. DNA sequence analysis of this region showed structural features common to bacterial plasmid replicons. A comparison of the pTFI91 origin with those of T. ferrooxidans pTF-FC2 and other broad host range vectors did not show significant homologous DNA sequences. To verify the replication function, a chloramphenicol acetyl transferase marker gene was ligated at the unique sites of pTFI91, and the plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli DH5 alpha cells but no transformants were identified. To test the replication of pTFI91 independent of DNA polymerase I in E. coli, different restriction fragments of pTFI91 were cloned into pHSG398 (Cmr, ColEI origin) and transformed into the polA1 mutant SF800, but chloramphenicol-resistant transformants were not detected. Electrotransformation of T. ferrooxidans TFI-70 and Pseudomonas putida ATCC 19151 also failed to yield transformants. The results suggested that the pTFI91 plasmid replicon does not function either in E. coli or in P. putida. Since pTFI91 contains the same origin of replication as other plasmids in several other T. ferrooxidans strains, this replicon may be commonly distributed in T. ferrooxidans.
TI  - Aspartate transcarbamoylase genes of Pseudomonas putida: requirement for an inactive dihydroorotase for assembly into the dodecameric holoenzyme.
AB  - The nucleotide sequences of the genes encoding the enzyme aspartate transcarbamoylase (ATCase) from Pseudomonas putida have been determined. Our results confirm that the P. putida ATCase is a dodecameric protein composed of two types of polypeptide chains translated coordinately from overlapping genes. The P. putida ATCase does not possess dissociable regulatory and catalytic functions but instead apparently contains the regulatory nucleotide binding site within a unique N-terminal extension of the pyrB-encoded subunit. The first gene, pyrB, is 1,005 bp long and encodes the 334-amino-acid, 36.4-kDa catalytic subunit of the enzyme. The second gene is 1,275 bp long and encodes a 424-residue polypeptide which bears significant homology to dihydroorotase (DHOase) from other organisms. Despite the homology of the overlapping gene to known DHOases, this 44.2-kDa polypeptide is not considered to be the functional product of the pyrC gene in P. putida, as DHOase activity is distinct from the ATCase complex. Moreover, the 44.2-kDa polypeptide lacks specific histidyl residues thought to be critical for DHOase enzymatic function. The pyrC-like gene (henceforth designated pyrC') does not complement Escherichia coli pyrC auxotrophs, while the cloned pyrB gene does complement pyrB auxotrophs. The proposed function for the vestigial DHOase is to maintain ATCase activity by conserving the dodecameric assembly of the native enzyme. This unique assembly of six active pyrB polypeptides coupled with six inactive pyrC' polypeptides has not been seen previously for ATCase but is reminiscent of the fused trifunctional CAD enzyme of eukaryotes.
TI  - Substrate specificity differences between two catechol 2,3-dioxygenases encoded by the TOL and NAH plasmids from Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - The substrate specificities of two catechol 2,3-dioxygenases, one encoded by xylE on the TOL plasmid pWW0 and the other encoded by nahH on the NAH7 plasmid, were investigated. The XylE catechol 2,3-dioxygenase catalyzes the ring-cleavage of catechol, 3-methylcatechol and 4-methylcatechol. The NahH catechol 2,3-dioxygenase was partially deficient in oxidizing 3-methylcatechol due to defects in two catalytic properties. First, NahH has a lower kcat value for 3-methylcatechol compared to XylE, and secondly, NahH is more susceptible than XylE to suicide inhibition by 3-methylcatechol. To identify the amino acid residues of XylE and NahH responsible for the differences in the efficacy of the 3-methylcatechol oxidation, kcat and kinact (the rate constant for suicide inhibition) for 3-methylcatechol were determined for several NahH-XylE hybrid proteins, each of which consisted of the NahH sequence in the N-terminal region and the XylE sequence in the C-terminal region. It is shown that a single amino acid substitution present in the NahH sequence, His250-->Gln, was responsible for the reduced kcat and increased kinact values for 3-methylcatechol. In addition to the substitution at residue 250, some substitution(s) at residues 77-102 were responsible for the twofold difference in the kinact values for NahH and XylE with 3-methylcatechol. We also show that the binding site of 3-methylcatechol for suicide inhibition is different from the catalytic site.
TI  - Activation of the transcriptional regulator XylR of Pseudomonas putida by release of repression between functional domains.
AB  - In the presence of toluene, xylenes and other structural analogues, the regulatory protein XylR, of the family of transcriptional regulators which act in concert with the sigma 54 factor, activate the promoter Pu of the TOL (toluene degradation) plasmid pWWO of Pseudomonas putida. Amino acid changes Val-219-Asp and Ala-220-Pro, introducing a proline kink at the hinge region between the N-terminal A domain and the central portion of XylR, resulted in a semi-constitutive phenotype which mimicked the activating effect of aromatic inducers. This phenotype was further exacerbated by inserting extra amino acid residues within the same inter-domain region. A truncated XylR protein devoid of the signal-receiving, amino-terminal portion of the protein stimulated the cognate promoter Pu at high levels independently of inducer addition, both in Escherichia coli and in Pseudomonas putida. Replacement of the amino-terminal domain by a heterologous peptide derived from the MS2 virus polymerase resulted in a hybrid protein still able to bind DNA to the same extent in vivo as XylR, but unable to stimulate transcription. These data indicate that a key event in the activation of XylR by toluene/xylenes is the release of the repression caused by the A domain of the protein on surfaces located at the central domain of the regulator.
TI  - Identification of functional residues in a 2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde hydrolase. A new member of the alpha/beta hydrolase-fold family of enzymes which cleaves carbon-carbon bonds.
AB  - The 2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde hydrolase, XylF, of the Pseudomonas putida TOL  plasmid-encoded pathway for the catabolism of toluene and xylenes, catalyzes one of the rarest types of enzyme reaction (EC 3.7.1.9), the hydrolysis of a carbon-carbon bond in its substrate, the ring-fission product of 3-alkyl-substituted catechols. In this study, amino acid sequence comparisons between XylF and other hydrolases, and analysis of the similarity between the predicted secondary structure of XylF and the known secondary structure of the haloalkane dehalogenase from Xanthobacter autotrophicus strain GJ10, led us to identify several conserved residues likely to have a functional role in the catalytic center of XylF. Three amino acids, Ser107, Asp228, and His256, were found to be arranged in a sequential order similar to that in alpha/beta hydrolase-fold enzymes. Investigations of the potential functional role of these and other residues through amino acid modification and in vitro site-directed mutagenesis experiments provided evidence in support of the hypothesis that XylF is a serine hydrolase of the alpha/beta hydrolase-fold family of enzymes, and pointed to the residues identified above as the catalytic triad of XylF. These studies also provided information on other conserved residues in XylF-related enzymes. Interestingly, the substitution of Phe by Met in position 108 of XylF created an enzyme with increased thermostability and altered substrate specificity.
TI  - Single amino acids changes in the signal receptor domain of XylR resulted in mutants that stimulate transcription in the absence of effectors.
AB  - The XylR protein positively controls expression from the Pseudomonas putida TOL plasmid sigma 54-dependent "upper" pathway operon promoter (Pu) and the xylS gene promoter (Ps), in response to the presence of aromatic effectors. Two mutant XylR regulators able to stimulate transcription from Pu and Ps in the absence of effectors were isolated. These mutants exhibited single point mutations, namely Asp135-->Asn and Pro85-->Ser. Both mutations are located in the amino termini domain of XylR, which is thought to be responsible for interactions with effectors. The effector profile of XylRP85S was similar to that of wild-type XylR protein; however, XylRD135N exhibited an altered pattern of effector recognition: with m-nitrotoluene it stimulated transcription from the Pu promoter above the high basal level, whereas this nitroarene inhibited the wild-type regulator. Previous work (Delgado, A., and Ramos, J.L. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 8059-8062) showed that residue 172 was involved in effector interactions, as mutant XylRE172K also recognized m-nitrotoluene. However, double mutant XylR135N/E172K did not stimulate transcription in the absence of effector, but retained the ability to stimulate transcription with m-nitrotoluene. Transcription mediated by XylRD135N and XylRP85S from Pu::lacZ was analyzed in detail. Like the wild-type regulator, XylRD135N and XylRP85S required sigma 54 for full transcription activation, but in contrast with the wild-type regulator, XylRD135N, but not XylRP85S, stimulated transcription from Pu in the absence of the integration host factor protein. XylRD135N, also in contrast with XylR and XylRP85S, mediated transcription from a mutant Pu promoter that lacked one of the upstream regulator binding sites (delta UAS1), but not when both upstream regulator binding sites were deleted. The level of autoregulation of XylRD135N was at least 2-fold higher than that found with the wild-type XylR regulator and the mutant XylRP85S.
TI  - Identification of a membrane protein and a truncated LysR-type regulator associated with the toluene degradation pathway in Pseudomonas putida F1.
AB  - A 3 kb DNA region upstream of the toluene degradation (tod) genes, todFC1C2BADEGIH, in Pseudomonas putida F1 (PpF1) was sequenced. Two divergently arranged open reading frames, todR and todX, were identified. A toluene-inducible promoter was localized in front of todX, and the transcription start point was mapped. This promoter is probably responsible for the expression of all tod structural genes. TodX was found to be a membrane protein. Its predicted amino acid sequence (453 residues; M(r) 48,265) exhibits considerable similarity with the FadL protein of Escherichia coli, an outer membrane protein required for binding and transport of long-chain fatty acids. An apparent function of TodX is likely to be involved in facilitating the delivery of exogenous toluene inside the PpF1 cells. The sequence of TodR (100 residues) exhibits extensive homology with the DNA-binding domain of transcriptional activators of the LysR family, but todR was found to have a negligible role in tod gene regulation.
TI  - Mechanism of the reaction catalyzed by mandelate racemase: structure and mechanistic properties of the K166R mutant.
AB  - On the basis of the available high-resolution structures of mandelate racemase (MR) from Pseudomonas putida [Landro, J. A., Gerlt, J. A., Kozarich, J. W., Koo, C. W., Shah, V. J., Kenyon, G. L., Neidhart, D. J., Fujita, J., & Petsko, G. A. (1994) Biochemistry 33, 635-643], Lys 166 and His 297 are positioned appropriately to participate in catalysis as acid/base catalysts that either abstract the alpha-proton from the enantiomers of mandelate to form an enolic intermediate or protonate the enolic intermediate to form the enantiomers of mandelate, with Lys 166 participating as the (S)-specific acid/base catalyst and His 297 participating as the (R)-specific acid/base catalyst. In this paper we report the structural and mechanistic properties of the mutant in which Lys 166 has been replaced with arginine (K166R). The structure of K166R has been determined at 1.85 A resolution with the substrate (S)-mandelate bound in the active site. The structure of this complex reveals no geometric alterations in the active site, with the exception that the longer side chain of Arg 166 is necessarily displaced upward from the position occupied by Lys 166 by steric interactions with the bound substrate. In contrast to the H297N mutant of MR [Landro, J. A., Kallarakal, A. T., Ransom, S. C., Gerlt, J. A., Kozarich, J. W., Neidhart, D. J., & Kenyon, G. L. (1991) Biochemistry 30, 9275-9281], the K166R exhibits low levels of racemase activity [kcat is reduced 5 x 10(3)-fold in the (R)- to (S)-direction and 1 x 10(3)-fold in the (S)- to (R)-direction]. The substrate and solvent deuterium isotope effects support a reaction coordinate for the K166R-catalyzed reaction in which the transition state for interconversion of bound (S)-mandelate and the stabilized enolic intermediate is higher in energy that the transition state for interconversion of bound (R)-mandelate and the stabilized enolic intermediate. The solvent deuterium isotope effect when (S)-mandelate is substrate (2.2 +/- 0.3) supports the proposal that the formation of the enolic intermediate involves partial transfer of a solvent-derived proton from Glu 317 to the substrate as the alpha-proton is abstracted [Mitra, B., Kallarakal, A. T., Kozarich, J. W., Gerlt, J. A., Clifton, J. G., Petsko, G. A., & Kenyon, G. L. (1995) Biochemistry 34, 2777-2787].(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Regulation of the hemA gene during 5-aminolevulinic acid formation in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - The general tetrapyrrole precursor 5-aminolevulinic acid is formed in bacteria via two different biosynthetic pathways. Members of the alpha group of the proteobacteria use 5-aminolevulinic acid synthase for the condensation of succinyl-coenzyme A and glycine, while other bacteria utilize a two-step pathway from aminoacylated tRNA(Glu). The tRNA-dependent pathway, involving the enzymes glutamyl-tRNA reductase (encoded by hemA) and glutamate-1-semialdehyde-2,1-aminomutase (encoded by hemL), was demonstrated to be used by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas putida, Pseudomonas stutzeri, Comamonas testosteroni, Azotobacter vinelandii, and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. To study the regulation of the pathway, the glutamyl-tRNA reductase gene (hemA) from P. aeruginosa was cloned by complementation of an Escherichia coli hemA mutant. The hemA gene was mapped to the SpeI A fragment and the DpnIL fragment of the P. aeruginosa chromosome corresponding to min 24.1 to 26.8. The cloned hemA gene, coding for a protein of 423 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 46,234 Da, forms an operon with the gene for protein release factor 1 (prf1). This translational factor mediates the termination of the protein chain at the ribosome at amber and ochre codons. Since the cloned hemA gene did not possess one of the appropriate stop codons, an autoregulatory mechanism such as that postulated for the enterobacterial system was ruled out. Three open reading frames of unknown function transcribed in the opposite direction to the hemA gene were found. hemM/orf1 and orf2 were found to be homologous to open reading frames located in the 5' region of enterobacterial hemA genes. Utilization of both transcription start sites was changed in a P. aeruginosa mutant missing the oxygen regulator Anr (Fnr analog), indicating the involvement of the transcription factor in hemA expression. DNA sequences homologous to one half of an Anr binding site were detected at one of the determined transcription start sites.
TI  - Lipase modulator protein (LimL) of Pseudomonas sp. strain 109.
AB  - Plasmids containing a Pseudomonas sp. strain 109 extracellular lipase gene (lipL) lacking NH2-terminal sequence and a lipase modulator gene (limL) lacking the NH2-terminal hydrophobic region were constructed and expressed independently in Escherichia coli by using the T7 promoter expression vector system. Recombinant LipL (rLipL) was produced as inclusion bodies, whereas recombinant LimL (rLimL) was present as a soluble protein. During in vitro renaturation of the purified rLipL inclusion bodies after they had been dissolved in 8 M urea, addition of rLimL was essential to solubilize and modulate rLipL. The solubility and activity of rLipL were influenced by the rLimL/rLipL molar ratio; the highest level of solubility was obtained at an rLimL/rLipL ratio of 4:5, whereas the highest activity level was obtained at an rLimL/rLipL ratio of 4:1. After renaturation, rLipL and rLimL were coprecipitated with anti-rLipL antibody, indicating the formation of an rLipL-rLimL complex. Activity of the native lipase purified from Pseudomonas sp. strain 109 was also inhibited by rLimL. By Western blotting (immunoblotting) with anti-rLimL antibody, native LimL was detected in Pseudomonas cells solubilized by sarcosyl treatment. LimL was purified from Pseudomonas sp. strain 109, and the NH2-terminal amino acid sequence was determined to be NH2-Leu-Glu-Pro-Ser-Pro-Ala-Pro-. We propose that to prevent membrane degradation, LimL weakens lipase activity inside the cell, especially in the periplasm, in addition to modulating lipase folding.
TI  - A manganese-dependent dioxygenase from Arthrobacter globiformis CM-2 belongs to the major extradiol dioxygenase family.
AB  - Almost all bacterial ring cleavage dioxygenases contain iron as the catalytic metal center. We report here the first available sequence for a manganese-dependent 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetate (3,4-DHPA) 2,3-dioxygenase and its further characterization. This manganese-dependent extradiol dioxygenase from Arthrobacter globiformis CM-2, unlike iron-dependent extradiol dioxygenases, is not inactivated by hydrogen peroxide. Also, ferrous ions, which activate iron extradiol dioxygenases, inhibit 3,4-DHPA 2,3-dioxygenase. The gene encoding 3,4-DHPA 2,3-dioxygenase, mndD, was identified from an A. globiformis CM-2 cosmid library. mndD was subcloned as a 2.0-kb SmaI fragment in pUC18, from which manganese-dependent extradiol dioxygenase activity was expressed at high levels in Escherichia coli. The mndD open reading frame was identified by comparison with the known N-terminal amino acid sequence of purified manganese-dependent 3,4-DHPA 2,3-dioxygenase. Fourteen of 18 amino acids conserved in members of the iron-dependent extradiol dioxygenase family are also conserved in the manganese-dependent 3,4-DHPA 2,3-dioxygenase (MndD). Thus, MndD belongs to the extradiol family of dioxygenases and may share a common ancestry with the iron-dependent extradiol dioxygenases. We propose the revised consensus primary sequence (G,T,N,R)X(H,A)XXXXXXX(L,I,V,M,F)YXX(D,E,T,N,A)PX(G,P) X(2,3)E for this family. (Numbers in brackets indicate a gap of two or three residues at this point in the sequence.) The suggested common ancestry is also supported by sequence obtained from genes flanking mndD, which share significant sequence identity with xylJ and xylG from Pseudomonas putida.
TI  - PCR amplification and direct sequencing of gyrB genes with universal primers and  their application to the detection and taxonomic analysis of Pseudomonas putida strains.
AB  - Degenerate PCR primers, UP-1 and UP-2r, for the amplification of DNA gyrase subunit B genes (gyrB) were designed by using consensus amino acid sequences of gyrases from Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas putida, and Bacillus subtilis. In addition to the degenerate sequences, these primers have sequences at the 5' end which allow direct sequencing of amplified PCR products. With these primers, DNA segments of the predicted size were amplified from a variety of gram-negative and gram-positive genera. The nucleotide sequences of the amplified gyrB DNA from three P. putida strains were determined directly from the amplified fragments. The base substitution frequency of gyrB between the strains of P. putida was much higher than that of the 16S rRNA gene. With a specific set of PCR primers, it was possible to amplify gyrB fragments selectively from P. putida or its subgroups. The direct sequencing method of gyrB developed in this study provides a rapid and convenient system for bacterial identification, taxonomic analysis, and monitoring of bacteria in the natural environment.
TI  - Cloning, DNA sequencing and heterologous expression of the gene for thermostable  N-acylamino acid racemase from Amycolatopsis sp. TS-1-60 in Escherichia coli.
AB  - The gene encoding the novel enzyme N-acylamino acid racemase (AAR) was cloned in  recombinant phage lambda-4 from the DNA library of Amycolatopsis sp. TS-1-60, a rare actinomycete, using antiserum against the enzyme. The cloned gene was subcloned and transformed in Escherichia coli JM105 using pUC118 as a vector. The AAR gene consists of an open-reading frame of 1104 nucleotides, which specifies a 368-amino-acid protein with a molecular mass of 39411Da. The molecular mass deduced from the AAR gene is in good agreement with the subunit molecular mass (40kDa) of AAR from Amycolatopsis sp. TS-1-60. The guanosine plus cytosine content of the AAR gene was about 70%. Although the AAR gene uses the unusual initiation codon GTG, the gene was expressed in Escherichia coli using the lac promoter of pUC118. The amount of the enzyme produced by the transformant was 16 times that produced by Amycolatopsis sp. TS-1-60. When the unusual initiation codon GTG was changed to ATG, the enzyme productivity of the transformant increased to more than 37 times that of Amycolatopsis sp. TS-1-60. In the comparison of the DNA sequence and the deduced amino acid sequence of AAR with those of known racemases and epimerases in data bases, no significant sequence homology was found. However, AAR resembles mandelate racemase in that requires metal ions for enzyme activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Overexpression of Pseudomonas putida catechol 2,3-dioxygenase with high specific  activity by genetically engineered Escherichia coli.
AB  - The cloned xylE gene encoding catechol 2,3-dioxygenase (metapyrocatechase) from TOL plasmid in Pseudomonas putida mt-2 has been expressed in Escherichia coli W3110 to a level of approximately 15% of the total soluble protein. Of the total iron in the crude extract, 45% was on the enzyme. The crystallized enzyme from E. coli had higher iron content (3.7 mol/mol enzyme) and specific activity (536 U/mg) than the enzyme from P. putida mt-2. However, no differences were observed in physicochemical, protein-chemical, and kinetic properties between the two enzymes. The enzyme was a homotetramer, and no changes were observed in the values of M(r) (136,000 +/- 5,000) and Stokes radius (4.26 nm) in the concentration range from 0.36 nM to 2.8 microM, indicating that the native enzyme neither dissociated into subunits nor polymerized in this range. The catalytic center activity and the Km values for catechol and dioxygen were 278 s-1, 1.87 and 7.45 microM, respectively, at pH 7.5 and 25 degrees C. The enzyme showed a broad substrate specificity. Among substrates, 4-methylcatechol and 4-chlorocatechol showed specificity constants (approximately 200 microM-1.s-1) higher than that for catechol. Acetone and phenol derivatives competitively inhibited the activity against catechol. The relationship between specific activity and iron content was not linear, suggesting some conformational changes in the partially iron-depleted enzyme.
TI  - Iron regulation of siderophore biosynthesis and transport in Pseudomonas putida WCS358: involvement of a transcriptional activator and of the Fur protein.
AB  - Pseudobactin 358 is the yellow-green fluorescent siderophore produced by Pseudomonas putida WCS358 in conditions of iron limitation. The genes encoding for siderophore biosynthesis are iron-regulated at the transcriptional level. Previous work has shown that a positive regulator, PfrA, is absolutely required for the activation under iron-limiting conditions of pseudobactin 358 biosynthesis. In this study we identified a set of Tn5 insertion mutants of strain WCS358 which lost the ability to activate an iron-regulated siderophore promoter. These mutants no longer produced pseudobactin 358. Molecular analysis revealed that they carried a Tn5 insertion in a gene, designated pfrl (Pseudomonas ferric regulator), which codes for a protein (Pfrl) of 19.5 kDa. Pfrl contains a putative helix-turn-helix motif typical of DNA-binding proteins and has homology to two DNA-binding transcriptional activators, Fecl from Escherichia coli and Pupl from P. putida. The proposed role of Pfrl in strain WCS358 is an activator protein regulating pseudobactin 358 biosynthesis under iron limitation. The pfrl promoter region contains a sequence which displays high identity to the Fur-box consensus. This 19 bp consensus sequence is recognized by Fur, an iron-binding repressor protein found in many different bacteria. The E. coli Fur protein can bind to the pfrl promoter region, indicating that this activator gene is likely to be iron-regulated by Fur. We also report the identification and characterization of the P. putida WCS358 fur gene. The Fur protein of strain WCS358 is structurally and functionally similar to other cloned Fur proteins from other bacterial species.
TI  - Monoclonal antibodies to Pseudomonas pseudomallei and their potential for diagnosis of melioidosis.
AB  - Monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) specific for Pseudomonas pseudomallei antigens were  produced by immunizing BALB/c mice with a crude whole cell extract. Hybrids secreting MAbs specific for P. pseudomallei antigens were identified by an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) against a panel of crude whole cell extracts from P. pseudomallei, P. cepacia, P. aeruginosa, P. putida, P. alcaligenes, Xanthomonas maltophilia, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Salmonella typhi, S. krefeld, S. enteritidis, Proteus mirabilis, and Staphylococcus aureus. Of the six specific clones, clone 5F8, which was IgM-producing and which reacted with all 56 P. pseudomallei isolates, was selected for further characterization and evaluation of its possible diagnostic potential. Results obtained from the indirect ELISA against various P. pseudomallei antigens, from direct bacterial agglutination, and from immunofluorescence tests suggested that 5F8 reacted with the surface envelope, and probably specifically with an epitope of the lipopolysaccharide. The antibody could be readily used to identify P. pseudomallei in primary culture or in a simulated hemoculture. The antibody was also used to prepare an affinity-purified antigen for use in an indirect ELISA that was highly sensitive and specific for the detection of circulating antibody in patients with acute septicemic melioidosis.
TI  - Characterization of BkdR-DNA binding in the expression of the bkd operon of Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - The bkd operon of Pseudomonas putida consists of the structural genes encoding the components of the inducible branched-chain ketoacid dehydrogenase. BkdR, a positive regulator of the bkd operon and a homolog of Lrp of Escherichia coli is encoded by a structural gene adjacent to, and divergently transcribed from, the bkd operon of P. putida. BkdR was purified from E. coli containing bkdR cloned into pCYTEXP1, an expression vector. The molecular weight of BkdR obtained by gel filtration indicates that BkdR is a tetramer, and the abundance of BkdR in P. putida was estimated to be about 25 to 40 copies of the tetramer per cell. BkdR bound specifically to the region between bkdR and bkdA1, the latter being the first gene of the bkd operon. One BkdR-DNA complex was observed in gel mobility shift patterns. Approximately 100 bp was protected from the action of DNase I by BkdR, and the addition of L-branched-chain amino acids enhanced the appearance of hypersensitive sites in the protected region. There are four potential BkdR-DNA binding sequences in this region based on similarity to Lrp-binding consensus sequences. Like many other transcriptional activators, BkdR regulates expression of its structural gene. DNAs from several gram-negative bacteria hybridized to a probe containing bkdR, indicating the presence of bkdR-like genes in these organisms.
TI  - Cloning, sequence analysis, and expression of the gene encoding formaldehyde dismutase from Pseudomonas putida F61.
AB  - The gene (fdm) coding for formaldehyde dismutase (EC 1.2.99.4) from a genomic library of formaldehyde-tolerant Pseudomonas putida F61 was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The nucleotides of the cloned DNA were sequenced; they included a single open reading frame of 1200 base pairs, coding for a putative protein with a molecular weight of 42,848. Sequencing of the first 20 N-terminal amino acid residues and of an internal part of the enzyme purified from P. putida F61 established the identity and the start codon of fdm. Comparison of the amino acid sequence predicted from fdm with that of alcohol dehydrogenase from horse liver suggested a putative pyridine-dinucleotide-binding domain in fdm, and also potential ligands for the catalytic domain and the second zinc atom-folding domain. fdm seemed to be expressed in E. coli under control of the promoter of fdm; there was an E. coli promoter-like sequence upstream from the gene. The enzyme expressed in E. coli was purified to homogeneity. The molecular weight and the sequence of the first 20 N-terminal amino acid residues were identical with those of P. putida formaldehyde dismutase. Each subunit contained 1 mol of NAD(H) and 2 mol of zinc per mol of protein. The enzyme produced in E. coli catalyzed the dismutation of formaldehyde to form methanol and formic acid at the ratio of 1:1 in the absence of the exogenous electron acceptor, NAD(H).
TI  - Effect of cellular physiology on PCR amplification efficiency.
AB  - Culture conditions, and other variables that modulate a cell's physiology, can bias a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification against generating a representative population profile. Two Pseudomonas putida nahR alleles were constructed in pUC19 that differ solely in a 31-bp internal segment whose sequence has been inverted. After PCR amplification, the products could be distinguished on the basis of a change in a unique restriction site. When an Escherichia coli strain carrying one nahR allele is submitted to different growth conditions, the consequences of such variations on the relative PCR amplification of whole cells can be ascertained through coamplification with a strain carrying the other allele and subsequent restriction analysis. Cells in stationary phase displayed improved amplifiability while cells grown at 42 degrees C were equally amplifiable as compared to cells grown at 37 degrees C. However, sublethal levels of tetracycline or growth in minimal medium made the PCR target in these cells relatively less amplifiable. When cells are completely lysed and the plasmid DNA is purified beforehand, the coamplification bias is eliminated. These results suggest that mixed populations containing cells in different physiological states may not be representatively amplified by PCR unless a DNA extraction step is included.
TI  - Cloning and sequencing of a 29 kb region of the Bacillus subtilis genome containing the hut and wapA loci.
AB  - Within the framework of an international project for the sequencing of the entire Bacillus subtilis genome, a 29 kb chromosome segment, which contains the hut operon (335 degrees) and the wapA gene, has been cloned and sequenced. This region (28,954 bp) contains 21 complete ORFs and one partial one. The 5th, 6th and 17th genes correspond to hutH encoding histidase, hutP encoding the positive regulator for the hut operon and wapA encoding a precursor of three major wall-associated proteins, respectively. A homology search for their products deduced from the 21 complete ORFs revealed that nine of them exhibit significant homology to known proteins such as urocanase (Pseudomonas putida), a protein involved in clavulanic acid biosynthesis (Streptomyces griseus), amino acid permeases (lysine, Escherichia coli; histidine, Saccharomyces cerevisiae; and others), beta-glucoside-specific phosphotransferases (E. coli and Erwinia chrysanthemi) and 6-phospho-beta-glucosidases (E. coli and Erw. chrysanthemi). Based on the features of the determined sequence and the results of the homology search, as well as on genetic data and sequence of the hut genes reported by other groups, it is predicted that the B. subtilis hut operon may consist of the following six genes (6th-1st), the last of which is followed by a typical rho-independent transcription terminator: hutP, hutH, EE57A (hutU) encoding urocanase, EE57B (hutI) encoding imidazolone-5-propionate hydrolase, EE57C (hutG) encoding formiminoglutamate hydrolase and EE57D (tentatively designated as hutM) possibly encoding histidine permease. Interestingly, the direction of transcription of these hut genes is opposite to that of the movement of the replication fork.
TI  - Expression vectors for the use of eukaryotic luciferases as bacterial markers with different colors of luminescence.
AB  - An easy way to identify microorganisms is to provide them with gene markers that  confer a unique phenotype. Several genetic constructions were developed to use eukaryotic luciferase genes for bacterial tagging. The firefly and click bettle luciferase genes, luc and lucOR, respectively, were cloned under constitutive control and regulated control from different transcriptional units driven by P1, lambda PR, and Ptrc promoters. Comparison of the expression of each gene in Escherichia coli cells from identical promoters showed that bioluminescence produced by luc could be detected luminometrically in a more sensitive manner. In contrast, luminescence from intact lucOR-expressing cells was much more stable and resistant to high temperatures than that from luc-expressing cells. To analyze the behavior of these constructions in other gram-negative bacteria, gene fusions with luc genes were cloned on broad-host-range vectors. Measurements of light emission from Rhizobium meliloti, Agrobacterium tumefaciens, and Pseudomonas putida cells indicated that both luciferases were poorly expressed from P1 in most bacterial hosts. In contrast, the lambda promoter PR yielded constitutively high levels of luciferase expression in all bacterial species tested. PR activity was not regulated by temperature when the thermosensitive repressor cI857 was present in the bacterial species tested, except for E. coli. In contrast, the regulated lacIq-Ptrc::lucOR fusion expression system behaved in a manner similar to that observed in E. coli cells. After IPTG (isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside) induction, this system produced the highest levels of lucOR expression in all bacterial species tested.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Possible regulatory role for nonaromatic carbon sources in styrene degradation by Pseudomonas putida CA-3.
AB  - Styrene metabolism in styrene-degrading Pseudomonas putida CA-3 cells has been shown to proceed via styrene oxide, phenylacetaldehyde, and phenylacetic acid. The initial step in styrene degradation by strain CA-3 is oxygen-dependent epoxidation of styrene to styrene oxide, which is subsequently isomerized to phenylacetaldehyde. Phenylacetaldehyde is then oxidized to phenylacetic acid. Styrene, styrene oxide, and phenylacetaldehyde induce the enzymes involved in the degradation of styrene to phenylacetic acid by P. putida CA-3. Phenylacetic acid-induced cells do not oxidize styrene or styrene oxide. Thus, styrene degradation by P. putida CA-3 can be subdivided further into an upper pathway which consists of styrene, styrene oxide, and phenylacetaldehyde and a lower pathway which begins with phenylacetic acid. Studies of the repression of styrene degradation by P. putida CA-3 show that glucose has no effect on the activity of styrene-degrading enzymes. However, both glutamate and citrate repress styrene degradation and phenylacetic acid degradation, showing a common control mechanism on upper pathway and lower pathway intermediates.
TI  - Variability of peptidoglycan structural parameters in gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Muropeptide composition of peptidoglycan from the Gram-negative bacteria Aeromonas sp., Acinetobacter acetoaceticus, Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus morganii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas putida, Vibrio parahaemolyticus Yersinia enterocolitica and Escherichia coli, was analyzed by HPLC. In all instances peptidoglycan was built up from the same subunits. A wide disparity in the relative abundance of muropeptides and all structural parameters was observed. The contribution of LD-A2pm-A2pm cross-linked muropeptides was extremely variable; from 1 to 45% of cross-linked muropeptides. Muropeptides with the dipeptides Lys-Lys or Arg-Lys, indicative of murein-bound (lipo)proteins, were detected in all instances although abundance was very variable.
TI  - Iron-responsive gene expression in Pseudomonas fluorescens M114: cloning and characterization of a transcription-activating factor, PbrA.
AB  - In response to iron limitation. Pseudomonas fluorescens M114 induces a number of  genes including an iron-scavenging siderophore termed pseudobactin M114, its cognate receptor, PbuA, and a casein protease. A Tn5lacZ-induced mutant (M114FA1) was isolated that exhibits a pleiotropic phenotype and lacks the ability to express these iron-regulated genes. A cosmid clone was identified which complements this mutation. This clone is capable of activating a number of iron-regulated promoter fusion constructs from P. fluorescens M114 and Pseudomonas putida WCS358 and can also promote expression of these fusions in Escherichia coli. A series of insertion mutants was constructed by homologous recombination which were unable to transcribe the promoter fusions. DNA sequence analysis of the complementing region identified one open reading frame (ORF) termed pbrA (pseudobactin regulation activation) and the deduced amino acid sequence shows domains with significant homology to a number of ECF (extracytoplasmic function) transcriptional regulators of the sigma 70 sigma factor family, including fecl required for expression of the ferric dicitrate outer-membrane receptor protein of E. coli. Sequences upstream of the pbrA gene suggest that transcription of pbrA may also be iron regulated.
TI  - Tetrameric structure and cellular location of catechol 2,3-dioxygenase.
AB  - Catechol 2,3-dioxygenase from the meta-cleavage pathway encoded on the TOL plasmid of Pseudomonas putida (pWWO) was investigated by electron microscopy. Negatively stained samples of the purified catechol 2,3-dioxygenase revealed that the enzyme consists of four subunits arranged in a tetrahedral conformation. Monoclonal antibodies raised against catechol 2,3-dioxygenase showed highly specific reactions and were used to localize the enzyme in Escherichia coli (pAW31) and P. putida (pWWO), using the protein A-gold technique carried out as a post-embedding immunoelectron microscopy procedure. Our in situ labeling studies revealed a cytoplasmic location of the catechol 2,3-dioxygenase in both cell types.
TI  - Biosensing of benzene derivatives in the environment by luminescent Escherichia coli.
AB  - Sensitive and convenient biosensing of environmental pollutants has been developed by fusing a gene of firefly luciferase to the TOL plasmid. TOL plasmid of Pseudomonas putida encodes a series of enzymes for degradation of benzene and its derivatives. The expression of these enzymes is controlled with the regulating proteins xylR and xylS, whose promoters are activated in the presence of aromatic compounds. The structural gene of firefly luciferase, as a reporter enzyme, was inserted under the control of the promoter of xylS protein, and gene fusion plasmid pTSN316 was constructed. The recombinant Escherichia coli transformed with this plasmid was applied to the environmental biosensing of benzene derivatives. The expression of luciferase was induced in the presence of aromatic compounds and the lower detection limit for m-xylene was 5 microM.
TI  - Localization of functional domains in the Escherichia coli coprogen receptor FhuE and the Pseudomonas putida ferric-pseudobactin 358 receptor PupA.
AB  - Transport of ferric-siderophores across the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria is mediated by specific outer membrane receptors. To localize the substrate-binding domain of the ferric-pseudobactin 358 receptor, PupA, of Pseudomonas putida WCS358, we constructed chimeric receptors in which different domains of PupA were replaced by the corresponding domains of the related ferric-pseudobactin receptors PupB and PupX, or the coprogen receptor FhuE of Escherichia coli. None of the chimeric proteins composed of pseudobactin receptor domains facilitated growth on any of the original substrates, or they showed only an extremely low efficiency. However, these receptors enabled cells of Pseudomonas BN8 to grow on media supplemented with uncharacterized siderophore preparations. These siderophore preparations were isolated from the culture supernatant of WCS358 cells carrying plasmids that contain genes of Pseudomonas B10 required for the biosynthesis of pseudobactin B10. Hybrid proteins that contained at least the amino-terminal 516 amino acids of mature FhuE were active as a receptor for coprogen and interacted with the E. coli TonB protein. A chimeric PupA-FhuE protein, containing the amino-terminal 94 amino acids of mature PupA, was also active as a coprogen receptor, but only in the presence of Pseudomonas TonB. It is concluded that the carboxy-terminal domain of ferric-pseudobactin receptors is important, but not sufficient, for ligand interaction, whereas binding of coprogen by the FhuE receptor is not dependent on this domain. Apparently, the ligand-binding sites of different receptors are located in different regions of the proteins. Furthermore, species-specific TonB binding by the PupA receptor is dependent on the amino-terminal domain of the receptor.
TI  - The gene encoding glyoxalase I from Pseudomonas putida: cloning, overexpression,  and sequence comparisons with human glyoxalase I.
AB  - The gene encoding glyoxalase I (GlxI) from Pseudomonas putida has been cloned into the high-expression plasmid pBTacI. In the presence of IPTG, JM109 cells transformed with this vector give expression levels of GlxI 4000-fold higher than wild-type Escherichia coli. Contrary to a previous report, the nucleotide sequence of the gene encodes a 173-amino-acid polypeptide. Edman analysis indicates that the predicted N-terminal methionine is lost post-translationally to yield a 19407-Da protein. Mass spectrometry of the intact protein, and of the peptides generated from treatment with CNBr, does not indicate any additional post-translational modifications of the enzyme. Contrary to previous conclusions, there are no major regions of dissimilarity between the human and bacterial enzymes.
TI  - Molecular characterization of the Pseudomonas putida 2,3-butanediol catabolic pathway.
AB  - The 2,3-butanediol dehydrogenase and the acetoin-cleaving system were simultaneously induced in Pseudomonas putida PpG2 during growth on 2,3-butanediol and on acetoin. Hybridization with a DNA probe covering the genes for the E1 subunits of the Alcaligenes eutrophus acetoin cleaving system and nucleotide sequence analysis identified acoA (975 bp), acoB (1020 bp), apoC (1110 bp), acoX (1053 bp) and adh (1086 bp) in a 6.3-kb genomic region. The amino acid sequences deduced from acoA, acoB, and acoC for E1 alpha (M(r) 34639), E1 beta (M(r) 37268), and E2 (M(r) 39613) of the P. putida acetoin cleaving system exhibited striking similarities to those of the corresponding components of the A. eutrophus acetoin cleaving system and of the acetoin dehydrogenase enzyme system of Pelobacter carbinolicus and other bacteria. Strong sequence similarities of the adh translational product (2,3-butanediol dehydrogenase, M(r) 38361) were obtained to various alcohol dehydrogenases belonging to the zinc- and NAD(P)-dependent long-chain (group I) alcohol dehydrogenases. Expression of the P. putida ADH in Escherichia coli was demonstrated. The aco genes and adh constitute presumably one single operon which encodes all enzymes required for the conversion of 2,3-butanediol to central metabolites.
TI  - Construction of phoE-caa, a novel PCR- and immunologically detectable marker gene for Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - In this paper we describe the construction and use in Pseudomonas putida WCS358 of phoE-caa, a novel hybrid marker gene, which allows monitoring both at the protein level by immunological methods and at the DNA level by PCR. The marker is based on the Escherichia coli outer membrane protein gene phoE and 75 bp of E. coli caa, which encode a nonbacteriocinic fragment of colicin A. This fragment contains an epitope which is recognized by monoclonal antibody (MAb) 1C11. As the epitope is contained in one of the cell surface-exposed loops of PhoE, whole cells of bacteria expressing the protein can be detected by using the MAb. The marker gene contains only E. coli sequences not coding for toxins and therefore can be considered environmentally safe. The hybrid PhoE-ColA protein was expressed in E. coli under conditions of phosphate starvation, and single cells could be detected by immunofluorescence microscopy with MAb 1C11. Using a wide-host-range vector the phoE-caa gene was introduced into P. putida WCS358. The gene appeared to be expressed under phosphate limitation in this species, and the gene product was present in the membrane fraction and reacted with MAb 1C11. The hybrid PhoE-ColA protein could be detected on whole cells of WCS358 mutant strains lacking (part of) the O-antigen of the lipopolysaccharide but not on wild-type WCS358 cells, unless these cells had previously been washed with 10 mM EDTA. In addition to immunodetection, the phoE-caa marker gene could be specifically detected by PCR with one primer directed to a part of the phoE sequence and a second primer that annealed to the caa insert.
TI  - Cloning, nucleotide sequence, and overexpression of the gene coding for delta 5-3-ketosteroid isomerase from Pseudomonas putida biotype B.
AB  - The structural gene coding for the delta 5-3-ketosteroid isomerase (KSI) of Pseudomonas putida biotype B has been cloned, and its entire nucleotide sequence has been determined by a dideoxynucleotide chain termination method. A 2.1-kb DNA fragment containing the ksi gene was cloned from a P. putida biotype B genomic library in lambda gt11. The open reading frame of ksi encodes 393 nucleotides, and the amino acid sequence deduced from the nucleotide sequence agrees with the directly determined amino acid sequence (K. Linden and W. F. Benisek, J. Biol. Chem. 261:6454-6460, 1986). A putative purine-rich ribosome binding site was found 8 bp upstream of the ATG start codon. Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) transformed with the pKK-KSI plasmid containing the ksi gene expressed a high level of isomerase activity when induced by isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside. KSI was purified to homogeneity by a simple and rapid procedure utilizing fractional precipitation and an affinity column of deoxycholate-ethylenediamine-agarose as a major chromatographic step. The molecular weight of KSI was 14,535 (calculated, 14,536) as determined by electrospray mass spectrometry. The purified KSI showed a specific activity (39,807 mumol min-1 mg-1) and a Km (60 microM) which are close to those of KSI originally obtained from P. putida biotype B.
TI  - Conversion of pBR322-based plasmids into broad-host-range vectors by using the Tn3 transposition mechanism.
AB  - We constructed a series of transposon vectors which allow efficient in vitro gene manipulation and subsequent introduction of cloned DNA into a variety of gram-negative bacteria. Transfer of the cloned fragment from these multicopy plasmids into self-transmissible broad-host-range vectors is achieved in vivo, using the Tn3 transposition mechanism. Transposition into a variety of broad-host-range plasmids proceeds efficiently, and the resulting recombinant plasmids can be readily transferred and maintained in a variety of gram-negative bacteria. The utility of the transposable vectors was demonstrated by the introduction and expression of the lacIPOZY sequences of Escherichia coli into Pseudomonas putida strains, allowing them to utilize lactose as a sole source of carbon and energy.
TI  - Identification of the pcaRKF gene cluster from Pseudomonas putida: involvement in chemotaxis, biodegradation, and transport of 4-hydroxybenzoate.
AB  - Pseudomonas putida PRS2000 is chemotactic to 4-hydroxybenzoate and other aromatic acids. This behavioral response is induced when cells are grown on 4-hydroxybenzoate or benzoate, compounds that are degraded via the beta-ketoadipate pathway. Isolation of a transposon mutant defective in 4-hydroxybenzoate chemotaxis allowed identification of a new gene cluster designated pcaRKF. DNA sequencing, mutational analysis, and complementation studies revealed that pcaR encodes a regulatory protein required for induction of at least four of the enzymes of the beta-ketoadipate pathway and that pcaF encodes beta-ketoadipyl-coenzyme A thiolase, the last enzyme in the pathway. The third gene, pcaK, encodes a transporter for 4-hydroxybenzoate, and this protein is also required for chemotaxis to aromatic acids. The predicted PcaK protein is 47 kDa in size, with a deduced amino acid sequence indicative of membership in the major facilitator superfamily of transport proteins. The protein, expressed in Escherichia coli, catalyzed 4-hydroxybenzoate transport. In addition, whole cells of P. putida pcaK mutants accumulated 4-hydroxybenzoate at reduced rates compared with that in wild-type cells. The pcaK mutation did not impair growth at the expense of 4-hydroxybenzoate under most conditions; however, mutant cells grew somewhat more slowly than the wild type on 4-hydroxybenzoate at a high pH. The finding that 4-hydroxybenzoate chemotaxis can be disrupted without an accompanying effect on metabolism indicates that this chemotactic response is receptor mediated. It remains to be determined, however, whether PcaK itself is a chemoreceptor for 4-hydroxybenzoate or whether it plays an indirect role in chemotaxis. These findings indicate that aromatic acid detection and transport are integral features of aromatic degradation pathways.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence and functional analysis of the genes encoding 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid oxygenase in Pseudomonas cepacia AC1100.
AB  - Pseudomonas cepacia AC1100 is able to use the chlorinated aromatic compound 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T) as the sole source of carbon and energy. One of the early steps in this pathway is the conversion of 2,4,5-T to 2,4,5-trichlorophenol (2,4,5-TCP). 2,4,5-TCP accumulates in the culture medium when AC1100 is grown in the presence of 2,4,5-T. A DNA region from the AC1100 genome has been subcloned as a 2.7-kb SstI-XbaI DNA fragment, which on transfer to Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 allows the conversion of 2,4,5-T to 2,4,5-TCP. We have determined the directions of transcription of these genes as well as the complete nucleotide sequences of the genes and the number and sizes of the polypeptides synthesized by pulse-labeling experiments. This 2.7-kb DNA fragment encodes two polypeptides with calculated molecular masses of 51 and 18 kDa. Proteins of similar sizes were seen in the T7 pulse-labeling experiment in Escherichia coli. We have designated the genes for these proteins tftA1 (which encodes the 51-kDa protein) and tftA2 (which encodes the 18-kDa protein). TftA1 and TftA2 have strong amino acid sequence homology to BenA and BenB from the benzoate 1,2-dioxygenase system of Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, as well as to XylX and XylY from the toluate 1,2-dioxygenase system of Pseudomonas putida. The Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 strain containing the 2.7-kb SstI-XbaI fragment was able to convert not only 2,4,5-T to 2,4,5-TCP but also 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid to 2,4-dichlorophenol and phenoxyacetate to phenol.
TI  - Substitution of the ISP alpha subunit of biphenyl dioxygenase from Pseudomonas results in a modification of the enzyme activity.
AB  - We have constructed a hybrid multicomponent dioxygenase gene cluster in which the bphA1 gene, coding for ISP alpha subunit of biphenyl dioxygenase from Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes KF707, has been replaced by the bedC1 gene encoding the corresponding subunit of benzene dioxygenase from P. putida ML2. Escherichia coli cells containing the chimeric dioxygenase acquired the novel capability of producing indigo from indole. Furthermore, when compared to biphenyl dioxygenase, the hybrid dioxygenase enzyme was half as active towards benzene but exhibited only 4% activity when biphenyl was the substrate. The results implicate the ISP alpha subunit to be involved in substrate specificity and activity of the dioxygenase enzyme.
TI  - Amplification of the groESL operon in Pseudomonas putida increases siderophore gene promoter activity.
AB  - Pseudobactin 358 is the yellow-green fluorescent siderophore [microbial iron(III) transport agent] produced by Pseudomonas putida WCS358 under iron-limiting conditions. The genes encoding pseudobactin 358 biosynthesis are iron-regulated at the level of transcription. In this study, the molecular characterization is reported of a cosmid clone of WCS358 DNA that can stimulate, in an iron-dependent manner, the activity of a WCS358 siderophore gene promoter in the heterologous Pseudomonas strain A225. The functional region in the clone was identified by subcloning, transposon mutagenesis and DNA sequencing as the groESL operon of strain WCS358. This increase in promoter activity was not observed when the groESL genes of strain WCS358 were integrated via a transposon vector into the genome of Pseudomonas A225, indicating that multiple copies of the operon are necessary for the increase in siderophore gene promoter activity. Amplification of the Escherichia coli and WCS358 groESL genes also increased iron-regulated promoter activity in the parent strain WCS358. The groESL operon codes for the chaperone proteins GroES and GroEL, which are responsible for mediating the folding and assembly of many proteins.
TI  - Heterologous expression of the cytochrome P450cam hydroxylase operon and the repressor gene of Pseudomonas putida in Escherichia coli.
AB  - The cytochrome P450cam hydroxylase operon (camDCAB) of Pseudomonas putida is negatively regulated by a repressor, CamR, which also represses its own gene. The expression in P. putida of both camR and camDCAB is derepressed in the presence of D-camphor. We examined the expression in Escherichia coli of camR and camDCAB by monitoring the enzyme activity of the camD gene product. In the presence or absence of D-camphor in the cell culture, the expression in E. coli of camD was significant and constitutive, suggesting no expression of camR. This lack of expression was confirmed by monitoring the beta-galactosidase activity of camR-lacZ translational fusions. However, S1 nuclease mapping revealed that synthesis of camR mRNA in E. coli was significant and constitutive, as observed in the case of camDCAB mRNA. Thus, it is likely that the expression of camR in E. coli is limited at the translational level.
TI  - Permeabilization of mycolic-acid-containing actinomycetes for in situ hybridization with fluorescently labelled oligonucleotide probes.
AB  - The application of whole-cell hybridization using labelled oligonucleotide probes in microbial systematics and ecology is limited by difficulties in permeabilizing many Gram-positive organisms. In this investigation paraformaldehyde treatment, acid methanolysis and acid hydrolysis were evaluated as a means of permeabilizing mycolic-acid-containing actinomycetes prior to hybridization with a fluorescently labelled oligonucleotide probe designed to bind to a conserved sequence of bacterial 16S rRNA. Methods were evaluated on stationary-phase cultures of Gordona bronchialis, Mycobacterium fortuitum, Nocardia asteroides, N. brasiliensis, Rhodococcus equi, R. erythropolis, R. fascians, R. rhodochrous and Tsukamurella paurometabola, none of which could be probed following 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde fixation. For comparison and to test the general applicability of mild acid pretreatments, Bacillus subtilis, Lactobacillus plantarum, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida were also studied. The data showed that most of the mycolic-acid-containing organisms were successfully permeabilized by mild acid hydrolysis in 1 M HCl at 37 degrees C. Cells were treated for different lengths of time. In general, the mycolic-acid-containing organisms required between 30 and 50 min hydrolysis, whereas B. subtilis, E. coli and P. putida were rendered permeable in only 10 min. Interestingly, L. plantarum could not be permeabilized using acid hydrolysis even after 60 min exposure to 1 M HCl.
TI  - Heterotrophic bacterial populations in the mineral waters of thermal springs in Spain.
AB  - The microbiological quality and heterotrophic bacterial populations of 26 thermal mineral water springs in Spain were studied. In most of the springs the number of viable aerobes was less than 10(3) cfu ml-1 and the number of sporulated bacteria less than 10(2) cfu ml-1. No significant differences were found in the counts obtained with Plate Count Agar (PCA) and PCA diluted 1:10 and incubated at 22 degrees, 37 degrees and 45 degrees C. Total coliforms were found in 14 springs, faecal streptococci in three, spores of sulphite-reducing Clostridium and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in seven. Neither Escherichia coli nor Staphylococcus aureus were found. A total of 665 strains were isolated and 85.4% of these identified; 329 were Gram-positive and 239 were Gram-negative. The genera most prevalent present in the springs were Pseudomonas (in 92.3%), Bacillus (65.4%), Enterobacter, Micrococcus and Staphylococcus (50%), Acinetobacter (42.3%), Arthrobacter (38.4%), Clostridium (27%) and Xanthomonas (23%). Gram-negative bacteria predominated in the mesothermal springs and Gram-positive bacteria in the hyper- and hypothermal springs. The most common Gram-negative rod species isolated were Ps. fluorescens, Ps. aeruginosa, Ps. putida, Ent. agglomerans, Ent. sakazakii, Ac. calcoaceticus and Ent. amnigenus.
TI  - Cloning, sequencing, and expression of the structural genes for the cytochrome and flavoprotein subunits of p-cresol methylhydroxylase from two strains of Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - The structural genes for the flavoprotein subunit and cytochrome c subunit of p-cresol (4-methylphenol) methylhydroxylase (PCMH) from Pseudomonas putida NCIMB 9869 (National Collection of Industrial and Marine Bacteria, Aberdeen, Scotland) and P. putida NCIMB 9866 were cloned and sequenced. The genes from P.putida NCIMB 9869 were for the plasmid-encoded A form of PCMH, and the genes from P.putida NCIMB 9866 were also plasmid encoded. The nucleotide sequences of the two flavoprotein genes from P.putida NCIMB 9869 and P.putida NCIMB 9866 (pchF69A and pchF66, respectively) were the same except for 5 bases out of 1,584, and the translated amino acid sequences were identical. The nucleotide sequences of the genes for the cytochrome subunits of PCMH from the two bacteria (pchC69A and pchC66) varied by a single nucleotide in their 303-base sequences, and the translated amino acid sequences differed by a single residue at position 41 (Asp in PchC69A and Ala in PchC66). Both cytochromes had 21-residue signal sequences, as expected for periplasmic proteins, and these sequences were identical. On the other hand, no signal sequences were found for the flavoproteins.pchF69A and pchC69A were expressed, separately or together, in Escherichia coli JM109 and P.putida RA4007, with active PCMH produced in both bacteria. The E. coli-expressed flavocytochrome was purified. Our studies indicated that the E.coli-expressed subunits were identical to the subunits expressed in P.putida NCIMB 9869: molecular weights, isoelectric points, UV-visible spectra, and steady-state kinetic parameters were the same for the two sets of proteins. The subunits readily associated upon mixing two crude extracts of E.coli, one extract containing PchC69A and the other containing PchF69A. The courses of association of PchC69A and PchF69A were essentially identical for pure E. coli-expressed subunits and pure P. putida 9869-expressed subunits. E. coli-expressed PchC69A and PchF69A contained covalently bound heme and covalently bound flavin adenine dinucleotide, respectively, as the proteins expressed in nature.
TI  - Molecular characterization of 4-hydroxyphenylacetate 3-hydroxylase of Escherichia coli. A two-protein component enzyme.
AB  - The nucleotide sequences of the hpaB and hpaC genes encoding the 4-hydroxyphenylacetate 3-hydroxylase from Escherichia coli W ATCC 11105 have been determined. These genes appear to be part of an operon and encode two proteins of 58,781 and 18,679 Da, respectively, that are required for hydroxylase activity. This aromatic hydroxylase is NADH-dependent and uses FAD as the redox chromophore. The largest component (HpaB) has been purified by affinity chromatography in Cibacron blue. E. coli cells that express exclusively hpaB showed only a very low hydroxylase activity that was enhanced in the presence of extracts containing the smallest protein HpaC. This behavior resembles that of the coupling protein of the 4-hydroxyphenylacetate 3-hydroxylase from Pseudomonas putida, and it might prevent the wasteful oxidation of NADH in the absence of substrate. Using a promoter-probe plasmid we have demonstrated that the hpaBC operon is expressed by a promoter inducible by 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid. A gene, named hpaA, encoding a protein homologous to the XylS/AraC family of regulators, was identified upstream of the hydroxylase operon. The role played by HpaA in the regulation of the hpaBC operon remains to be elucidated. Since HpaB is not homologous to other aromatic hydroxylases, we suggest that the E. coli 4-hydroxyphenylacetate 3-hydroxylase is the first member of a new family of two-component aromatic hydroxylases sequenced so far.
TI  - Co-regulation by bent DNA. Functional substitutions of the integration host factor site at sigma 54-dependent promoter Pu of the upper-TOL operon by intrinsically curved sequences.
AB  - The role of integration host factor (IHF) in the regulation of the sigma 54-dependent promoter Pu of the TOL plasmid of Pseudomonas putida has been examined. We have selected in vivo insertions of intrinsically curved DNA that restore the responsiveness of an IHF-binding site deletion variant of Pu to the cognate activator of the system, XylR. We found five Pu derivatives which had inserted a core sequence with 6 phased [A]6 tracts, flanked by different lengths of DNA at the location of the former IHF site. They displayed 40-100% of the activity of Pu, were independent of IHF, and maintained the overall geometry of the wild-type promoter. The induction patterns of Pu, compared to those of hybrid promoters, were virtually indistinguishable. This supports the notion that, in native conditions, IHF co-regulates the system by providing a structural aid for promoter architecture and not by interacting directly with the RNA polymerase, as it has been suggested with other known IHF-dependent promoters.
TI  - Characterization of the pcaR regulatory gene from Pseudomonas putida, which is required for the complete degradation of p-hydroxybenzoate.
AB  - The pca branch of the beta-ketoadipate pathway in Pseudomonas putida is responsible for the complete degradation of p-hydroxybenzoate through ortho cleavage of the initial pathway metabolite, protocatechuate. The pcaR regulatory locus has been found to be required for both induction of all of the genes within the pca regulon (pcaBDC, pcaIJ, and pcaF) and the chemotactic response of the bacteria to aromatic compounds. Insertional inactivation mutagenesis, using Tn5 and mini-Tn5 transposons, was used to locate, clone, and sequence this pcaR regulatory gene. The pcaR gene product, when overexpressed in Escherichia coli, possessed a specific affinity for the pcaIJ promoter region and demonstrated that the entire PcaR protein was required for this function. The deduced amino acid sequence of the PcaR regulatory peptide bears little resemblance to its counterpart in the other branch of the pathway, CatR, but exhibits significant homology to its regulatory antecedent, PobR, which regulates the initial breakdown of p-hydroxybenzoate into protocatechuate. Comparisons of the pcaIJ and pcaR promoter regions revealed conservation of a 15-bp sequence centered around the -10 region in both sequences. This, together with previously defined deletional studies with the pcaIJ promoter region, suggests that PcaR exerts its regulatory effect through protein-DNA interactions within this region, which would be unusually close to the transcriptional start site of pcaIJ for a positive regulator.
TI  - Purification of the LysR family regulator, ClcR, and its interaction with the Pseudomonas putida clcABD chlorocatechol operon promoter.
AB  - Previous studies have shown that the clcABD operon is under the transcriptional control of the LysR-type activator ClcR. In this study, the conditions leading to its aggregation were avoided and ClcR was purified and confirmed by amino-terminal sequencing. Gel filtration indicated that ClcR exists as a dimer in solution. The DNase I footprint of ClcR was determined. The binding properties of ClcR and the catechol operon regulator, CatR, were compared.
TI  - Two identical copies of IS1246, a 1275 base pair sequence related to other bacterial insertion sequences, enclose the xyl genes on TOL plasmid pWW0.
AB  - Two identical direct repeats of a 1275 bp sequence, designated IS1246, encompass  the xyl genes, which determine the catabolism of toluene, m- and p-xylenes to central metabolites, on the TOL catabolic plasmid pWW0. IS1246 has a terminal inverted repeat of 12 bp (5'GGGCACCTCGAA3') and contains a major open reading frame of 280 codons. This ORF shows significant homology with ORFs encoded by a number of bacterial insertion sequences from Bacteroides, Neisseria and Escherichia coli.
TI  - Secretion of human epidermal growth factor (EGF) in autotrophic culture by a recombinant hydrogen-utilizing bacterium, Pseudomonas pseudoflava, carrying broad-host-range EGF secretion vector pKSEGF2.
AB  - We constructed the broad-host-range human epidermal growth factor (EGF) secretion plasmid pKSEGF2 by inserting the Escherichia coli tac promoter, the signal sequence of Pseudomonas stutzeri amylase, and the synthesized EGF gene into the broad-host-range vector pKT230. E. coli JM109 carrying pKSEGF2 secreted EGF into the periplasm and the culture medium under the control of the tac promoter. Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1161 carrying pKSEGF2 and Pseudomonas putida AC10 carrying pKSEGF2 secreted EGF into the culture medium constitutively. Four hydrogen-utilizing bacteria, Pseudomonas pseudoflava, Alcaligenes eutrophus, Alcaligenes paradoxus, and Paracoccus denitrificans, were transconjugated with pKSEGF2 from eight hydrogen-utilizing bacteria tested. In these transconjugated hydrogen-utilizing bacteria, P. pseudoflava carrying pKSEGF2 grew autotrophically and secreted EGF, confirmed by Western blot (immunoblot) analysis, into the culture medium constitutively.
TI  - Cloning and expression of Pseudomonas putida esterase gene in Escherichia coli and its use in enzymatic production of D-beta-acetylthioisobutyric acid.
AB  - The esterase catalyzes the stereoselective hydrolysis of methyl DL-beta-acetylthioisobutyrate (DL-ester) to give D-beta-acetylthioisobutyric acid (DAT). To use the enzyme for DAT production, the esterase gene of Pseudomonas putida was cloned and expressed in E. coli. The recombinant E. coli containing the esterase gene produced a large amount of the enzyme in an active form. This strain could be used for the asymmetric synthesis of DAT.
TI  - Universal barrier to lateral spread of specific genes among microorganisms.
AB  - A genetic circuit to suppress the lateral spread of cloned genes from recombinant to indigenous microorganisms in the environment has been developed. It is based on the endonucleolytic activity of the bacterial toxin colicin E3, which has a distinct target at the 3' end of the 16S ribosomal RNA; this sequence is conserved in virtually all prokaryotic and many eukaryotic genera. Cleavage at this sequence separates the mRNA binding sites from the remainder of the 16S rRNA, thereby inhibiting protein synthesis. While host bacteria carrying the genes for both colicin production and colicin immunity are perfectly viable, lateral transfer of the E3 gene to non-immune recipients results in killing of such recipients. This genetic circuit decreases operational transfer frequencies of cloned genes linked to the E3 gene among a variety of bacterial genera by four to five orders of magnitude. In combination with transposon cloning vectors, the circuit is predicted to reduce the rate of lateral spread of specific genes to ecologically insignificant levels. This system therefore represents a useful tool both to explore the evolutionary and ecological consequences of experimentally reducing lateral gene spread among microorganisms, and to increase the ecological predictability of novel recombinant microorganisms.
TI  - Tartrate dehydrogenase, a new member of the family of metal-dependent decarboxylating R-hydroxyacid dehydrogenases.
AB  - The gene encoding tartrate dehydrogenase has been cloned from Pseudomonas putida  and sequenced. The gene is 1098 nucleotides long and encodes a protein 365 amino acids in length with a calculated M(r) of 40,636. The gene and the protein encoded by it show strong homology to prokaryotic isopropylmalate dehydrogenases and, to a lesser extent, isocitrate dehydrogenase. Thus, tartrate dehydrogenase is the third member to be identified of the family of metal-dependent decarboxylating R-hydroxyacid dehydrogenases which have an evolutionarily distinct NAD(+)-binding domain. The poor catalytic properties of tartrate dehydrogenase suggest that it has not been under strong selective pressure to maximize its ability to turn over (+)-tartrate for very long; the homology with isopropylmalate dehydrogenase makes it an attractive candidate for a recent progenitor of tartrate dehydrogenase. beta-Isopropylmalate is a substrate for tartrate dehydrogenase with a Km of 14 +/- 2 microM; it is turned over with a Vmax that is 35% of Vmax in the (+)-tartrate reaction. The gene encoding tartrate dehydrogenase has been expressed in Escherichia coli and large quantities of soluble enzyme can be obtained.
TI  - EPR, ENDOR and ESEEM studies on recombinant benzene dioxygenase.
AB  
TI  - Significant contribution of arginine-112 and its positive charge of Pseudomonas putida cytochrome P-450cam in the electron transport from putidaredoxin.
AB  - Cytochrome P-450cam of Pseudomonas putida is a prototype of various eukaryotic cytochrome P-450 molecules. Arg-112 located on the surface of this protein is highly conserved among various other cytochromes P-450. In this study, we constructed mutant genes for P-450cam in which Arg-112 was replaced by Gln or Glu, expressed them in Escherichia coli and purified the mutant proteins. Their enzymic activities were analyzed in the reconstituted system to determine the function of Arg-112. Kd values for d-camphor of Arg112-Gln and Arg112-Glu were much the same as those of the wild-type enzyme, whereas Kd values for the oxidized form of putidaredoxin, which is an acidic protein and is the redox partner of P-450cam, were 240 and 530 microM, respectively. These values are 8 and 19 times larger than that of the wild-type enzyme (28 microM), thereby indicating lower affinities of the mutant enzymes for the oxidized putidaredoxin. Reaction rate constants for reduction by the reduced form of putidaredoxin, measured using the stopped flow method, were 45.5, 9.0 x 10(-3) and 9.0 x 10(-4) s-1 for the wild type, Arg112-Gln and Arg112-Glu, respectively. Thus, Arg-112 of P-450cam plays an important role in the interaction with putidaredoxin and in the high efficiency of the electron transfer; the positive charge of the residue seeming to contribute to the process. The yields in Escherichia coli, the heme contents in the purified fractions and heat stability of the mutant proteins were lower than those of the wild type enzyme, suggesting that Arg-112 of P-450cam is also important for stability of P-450cam.
TI  - Oxygen dependent regulation of Vitreoscilla globin gene: evidence for positive regulation by FNR.
AB  - Vitreoscilla globin (vgb) gene, encoding for Vitreoscilla haemoglobin (VtHb) has  been cloned and functionally expressed in heterologous bacterial hosts. Analysis of vgb gene expression and the study on vgb-xylE transcriptional fusion revealed that vgb promoter is preferentially activated in response to oxygen limitation in Vitreoscilla and other heterologous bacterial hosts. Microaerobic mode of induction in various hosts, provided evidence for a common regulatory factor involved in activation of vgb promoter under hypoxic condition. Primary structure analysis of vgb upstream regulatory region indicated the presence of a possible binding site for the transcriptional activator, FNR. Further, the E.coli mutant lacking fnr gene product was not able to activate vgb promoter under microaerobic condition, suggesting the involvement of FNR or FNR-like proteins in modulating its activity. The possibility of a second level of control by CRP is also indicated. Oxygen responsive nature and regulatory characteristics of vgb promoter offers a novel system for the expression of gene in heterologous bacterial hosts in an oxygen dependent manner.
TI  - Identification of variability of ribosomal DNA spacer from Pseudomonas soil isolates.
AB  - The polymerase chain reaction was used to amplify the spacer region located between the 16S and 23S ribosomal RNA genes of strains of Pseudomonas fluorescens and Pseudomonas putida isolated from peat bog, canola field, or arctic plants. Some of spacer region of four of the P. fluorescens strains examined, strains 64-3, 63-28, QP5, and R17-FP2, was about 515 base pairs (bp) in length, and contained the genes for tRNA(Ile) and tRNA(Ala). The DNA sequences of two strains from canola, 64-3 and 63-28, differed at only two positions. The sequences of the peat bog strains QP5 and R17-FP2 were identical. However, differences were noted between the DNA sequence common to the pair of strains 64-3 and 63-28 and the corresponding common sequence for strains QP5 and R17-FP2. These differences were mainly concentrated in two DNA segments of 10 and 19 bp, respectively. A probe for the 19-bp variable segment that occurs in the ribosomal spacer of strains QP5 and R17-FP2 recognized total DNA from these two strains, but not DNA from other bacteria of different origins. These results suggest the existence of a limited degree of variability within the 16S-23S ribosomal DNA spacer region, and that this variability may be useful to the recognition of particular Pseudomonas strains from environmental samples.
TI  - Trichloroethylene and chloroform degradation by a recombinant pseudomonad expressing soluble methane monooxygenase from Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b.
AB  - Soluble methane monooxygenase (sMMO) from Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b can degrade many halogenated aliphatic compounds that are found in contaminated soil and groundwater. This enzyme oxidizes the most frequently detected pollutant, trichloroethylene (TCE), at least 50 times faster than other enzymes. However, slow growth of the strain, strong competition between TCE and methane for sMMO, and repression of the smmo locus by low concentrations of copper ions limit the use of this bacterium. To overcome these obstacles, the 5.5-kb smmo locus of M. trichosporium OB3b was cloned into a wide-host-range vector (to form pSMMO20), and this plasmid was electroporated into five Pseudomonas strains. The best TCE degradation results were obtained with Pseudomonas putida F1/pSMMO20. The plasmid was maintained stably, and all five of the sMMO proteins (alpha, beta, and gamma hydroxylase proteins, reductase, and component B) were observed clearly by both sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western immunoblotting. TCE degradation rates were quantified for P. putida F1/pSMMO20 with a gas chromatograph (Vmax = 5 nmol per min per mg of protein), and the recombinant strain mineralized 55% of the TCE (10 microM) as indicated by measuring chloride ion concentrations with a chloride ion-specific electrode. The maximum TCE degradation rate obtained with the recombinant strain was lower than that of M. trichosporium OB3b but greater than other TCE-degrading recombinants and most well-studied pseudomonads. In addition, this recombinant strain mineralizes chloroform (a specific substrate for sMMO), grows much faster than M. trichosporium OB3b, and degrades TCE without competitive inhibition from the growth substrate.
TI  - Oxidation of 2-methoxynaphthalene by toluene, naphthalene and biphenyl dioxygenases:structure and absolute stereochemistry of metabolites.
AB  - 2-Methoxynaphthalene was subjected to biooxidation by whole cells of six organisms: Pseudomonas putida F39/D containing toluene dioxygenase, Escherichia coli JM109(pDTG601), containing recombinant toluene dioxygenase from Pp F39/D, Pseudomonas sp. NCIB 9816/11, containing naphthalene dioxygenase. E. coli JM109(pDTG141), containing recombinant naphthalene dioxygenase from NCIB 98161/11, E. coli C534(ProR/Sac) containing recombinant naphthalene dioxygenase from Pp G7, and Beijerinckia sp. B8/36, containing biphenyl dioxygenase. The major product of oxidation by the naphthalene and biphenyl dioxygenases has been isolated and identified as (1R,2S)-dihydroxy-7-methoxy-1,2-dihydronaphthalene, 2c. A minor product, (1R,2S)-dihydroxy-6-methoxy-1,2-dihydronaphthalene, 3c, has also been detected. Oxidation by the toluene dioxygenase-containing organisms led to the isolation of 3c as the major product. Minor products detected in these reactions were 2c, and a third compound, (1S,2S)-dihydroxy-3-methoxy-1,2-dihydronaphthalene, 4c. Structural studies and dehydration of the diols to a mixture of naphthols are described. The absolute stereochemistry of these new diols has been established by correlation with known compounds. The organisms' potential in the production of new metabolites as useful chiral synthons by biooxidation of 2-substituted naphthalenes is indicated.
TI  - TOL plasmid-specified xylene oxygenase is a wide substrate range monooxygenase capable of olefin epoxidation.
AB  - Xylene oxygenase, which is encoded on the TOL plasmid pWWO of Pseudomonas putida  mt-2, is a key enzyme system in the degradation of toluene and xylenes by this organism. It was expressed in an Escherichia coli recombinant strain carrying the xylMA structural genes. This recombinant, which expressed xylene oxygenase from the heat-shock induced lambda PL promoter, was analyzed for its potential as a biocatalytic tool so as to effect the oxidation of side chains of aromatic hydrocarbons to the corresponding alcohols. Compounds that were tested as potential substrates carried different substituents on the aromatic ring at ortho, meta, and para positions, relative to the methyl moiety. Products that accumulated after administration of the aromatic hydrocarbons to concentrated suspensions of the recombinant were identified by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. Toluene derivatives with ortho substituents could not serve as substrates for the biocatalyst, whereas a number of meta- or para- substituted analogs were efficiently oxidized to the corresponding benzylalcohols. Bioconversion of the substrates by resting cells varied from 3 mumol min-1 g-1 cell dry weight for 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene to 18 mumol min-1 g-1 cell dry weight for meta-xylene. Whole cells that expressed xylene oxygenase did catalyze the oxidation of the methyl substituent attached to a benzene ring, but no conversion of n-alkylbenzene derivatives with longer side chains was observed. Although the ethyl group of ethylbenzene could not be converted by the biocatalyst, cells containing xylene oxygenase were capable of oxidizing the ethylene side group of styrene to produce styrene epoxide.
TI  - Role for the outer membrane ferric siderophore receptor PupB in signal transduction across the bacterial cell envelope.
AB  - The outer membrane protein PupB of Pseudomonas putida WCS358 facilitates transport of iron complexed to the siderophores pseudobactin BN8 and pseudobactin BN7 into the cell. Its synthesis is induced by the presence of these specific siderophores under iron limitation. The signal transduction pathway regulating siderophore-dependent expression of pupB was shown to consist of two regulatory proteins, PupI and PupR, and the PupB receptor itself. Mutational analysis of the regulatory genes suggested that PupI acts as a positive regulator of pupB transcription, whereas PupR modifies PupI activity dependent on the presence of pseudobactin BN8. PupI and PupR do not share homology with the classical bacterial two-component systems but display significant similarity to the FecI and FecR proteins of Escherichia coli involved in regulation of ferric dicitrate transport. The function of the PupB receptor in pupB regulation was studied by the use of chimeric receptor proteins composed of PupB and the ferric pseudobactin 358 receptor PupA. This experiment revealed that PupB is involved in the initiation of the signal transduction pathway, implying a so far unique role for an outer membrane protein in signal transduction.
TI  - OXA1, a Saccharomyces cerevisiae nuclear gene whose sequence is conserved from prokaryotes to eukaryotes controls cytochrome oxidase biogenesis.
AB  - Yeast cells carrying a mutation in the OXA1 nuclear gene are respiratory deficient and lack cytochrome oxidase activity. We successively examined the different steps in the expression of the mitochondrial genes encoding the cytochrome oxidase subunits and apocytochrome b in strains carrying the oxa1-79 mutation. The ox1-79 strains exhibit a total absence of cytochrome aa3 and a decrease in cytochrome b, even in a strain devoid of mitochondrial introns, in which cox1 and cytb mRNAs normally accumulate. The three mitochondrial-encoded subunits of cytochrome oxidase are still detectable although their amount is reduced, and apocytochrome b is synthesized normally. These results suggest that the OXA1 gene is primary required at a post-translational step in cytochrome oxidase biogenesis, probably at the level of assembly, although the oxa1-79 mutation leads to some pleiotropic secondary defects in earlier steps of mitochondrial gene expression. The OXA1 gene has been cloned, sequenced, and disrupted. The phenotypes of the oxa1::LEU2 and oxa1-79 alleles are similar. Interestingly, the OXA1 gene, located on the yeast chromosome VIII, is adjacent to the gene PET 122, which controls the initiation of cox3 mRNA translation. In addition, the predicted OXA1 protein is homologous to several putative prokaryotic and eukaryotic proteins, suggesting that the function of the OXA1 protein is important for respiration in all living cells.
TI  - Genetic evidence that the XylS regulator of the Pseudomonas TOL meta operon controls the Pm promoter through weak DNA-protein interactions.
AB  - The activation of the Pm promoter of the meta operon of the TOL plasmid of Pseudomonas putida by its cognate XylS activator protein in the presence and absence of benzoate inducers has been examined in specialized Escherichia coli strains carrying Pm-lacZ fusions and the xylS gene in different configurations in which all controlling elements are present in near native conditions and stoichometry. Expression of a chromosomal Pm-xylX::lacZ fusion was primarily dependent on the addition of an effector at a low xylS gene dosage, but such dependency decreased with increasing levels of the regulator, to the point that hyperproduced XylS could, in the absence of any aromatic effector, raise expression to a level 10(4)-fold higher than normal basal levels. Pm activity never reached a defined saturation level within the range of intracellular concentrations permitted by the intrinsic solubility of the protein, thus suggesting a low degree of occupancy of the OmR and OmL (Om right and left half-sites, respectively) operator sequences by XylS. This was confirmed by transcription interference experiments, which indicated that the frequency of occupation of Pm by active XylS is low. This property permits a fine tuning of Pm activity in vivo through changes in intracellular XylS concentrations, as is predicted in current models to account for the coordinated regulation of TOL operons.
TI  - Analysis of fluorescent pseudomonads based on 23S ribosomal DNA sequences.
AB  - The regions from positions 1391 to 1545 and 1620 to 1865 (Escherichia coli numbers) of the 23S ribosomal DNA sequences have been analyzed for a number of Pseudomonas fluorescens and P. putida isolates. Variability was observed only in three smaller regions from positions 1484 to 1508, 1531 to 1542, and 1714 to 1748, corresponding to helices 58, 59, and 63, respectively, where up to 53% dissimilarity was found. Sequence analysis did not allow clear distinctions among P. fluorescens biovars, P. chlororaphis, and P. putida biovar B.
TI  - Cloning and sequencing of a 2,5-dichloro-2,5-cyclohexadiene-1,4-diol dehydrogenase gene involved in the degradation of gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane in Pseudomonas paucimobilis.
AB  - In Pseudomonas paucimobilis UT26, gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane (gamma-HCH) is converted to 2,5-dichloro-2,5-cyclohexadiene-1,4-diol (2,5-DDOL), which is then metabolized to 2,5-dichlorohydroquinone. Here, we isolated from the genomic library of UT26 two genes which expressed 2,5-DDOL dehydrogenase activity when they were transformed into P. putida and Escherichia coli. Both gene products had an apparent molecular size of 28 kDa by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The first gene, named linC, located separately from the two genes (linA and linB) which we had already cloned as genes involved in the gamma-HCH degradation. The other, named linX, located about 1 kb upstream of the linA gene encoding gamma-HCH dehydrochlorinase. A gamma-HCH degradation-negative mutant, named UT72, which lacked the whole linC gene but had the intact linX gene was isolated. The linC gene given in a plasmid could complement UT72. These results strongly suggest that the linC gene but not the linX gene is essential for the assimilation of gamma-HCH in UT26. Deduced amino acid sequences of LinC and LinX show homology to those of members of the short-chain alcohol dehydrogenase family.
TI  - Identification of serine-143 as the most likely precursor of dehydroalanine in the active site of histidine ammonia-lyase. A study of the overexpressed enzyme by site-directed mutagenesis.
AB  - The gene coding for histidase (histidine ammonia-lyase, HAL, EC 4.3.1.3) was isolated from a lambda-EMBL3 genomic library from Pseudomonas putida nicII and subcloned into the expression vector pT7-7. Transformation of Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells with the recombinant vector led to the expression of catalytically active histidase amounting to 20-30% of the total soluble protein in the crude cell extract. A new rapid and highly efficient isolation procedure is described leading to electrophoretically homogeneous histidase within 1.5 days. Six grams of E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells (wet weight) gives approximately 100 mg of homogeneous histidase with a specific activity of 27 IU/mg. To investigate the possible role of serine as a precursor of dehydroalanine in the active site of histidase, each of the four serines, conserved in all known histidases and phenylalanine ammonia-lyases, was consecutively changed to alanine by site-directed mutagenesis. The resulting mutant genes were subcloned into the expression vector pT7-7 and were assayed for histidase activity. The catalytic activities of the four mutants and of wild-type histidase were compared. The Km and Vmax values of the overexpressed mutants S112A, S393A, and S418A and wild-type histidase did not show any significant differences. Mutant S143A, however, was devoid of catalytic activity (< 0.01%), pointing to the outstanding importance of this serine for the formation of an active enzyme. We conclude that serine-143 is the most probable precursor of the active-site dehydroalanine. The role of serine-143 in the biosynthesis of active histidase is discussed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Functional and structural relationship of various extradiol aromatic ring-cleavage dioxygenases of Pseudomonas origin.
AB  - The extradiol ring-cleavage dioxygenases derived from seven different Pseudomonas strains were expressed in Escherichia coli and the substrate specificities were investigated for a variety of catecholic compounds. The substrate range of four 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl dioxygenases from biphenyl-utilizing bacteria, 3-methylcatechol dioxygenase from toluene utilizing Pseudomonas putida F1, 1,2-dihydroxynaphthalene dioxygenase from a NAH7 plasmid, and catechol 2,3-dioxygenase from a TOL plasmid pWW0 were compared. Among the dioxygenases, that from Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes KF707 showed a very narrow substrate range. Contrary to this, the dioxygenase from pWW0 showed a relaxed substrate range. The seven extradiol dioxygenases from the various Pseudomonas strains are highly diversified in terms of substrate specificity.
TI  - Reaction engineering aspects of conjugation in biodegradation processes.
AB  - Conjugation between two Pseudomonas putida species has been studied. Special emphasis has been given to the design of tools for better defined and reproducible experimental conditions. This is an essential prerequisite for any kinetic analysis of the phenomenon. The experimental approach suggested in the paper is a three-stage continuous fermentation, where donor and recipient strains can be cultivated at predefined steady-state growth rates, and conjugation takes place at steady-state conditions in the third stage. For the first time a remarkable influence of agitative speed on conjugation has been experimentally observed.

TI  - Cloning and high-level expression of the glutathione-independent formaldehyde dehydrogenase gene from Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - A DNA fragment of 485 bp was specifically amplified by PCR with primers based on  the N-terminal sequence of the purified formaldehyde dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.1.46) from Pseudomonas putida and on that of a cyanogen bromide-derived peptide. With this product as a probe, a gene coding for formaldehyde dehydrogenase (fdhA) in P. putida chromosomal DNA was cloned in Escherichia coli DH5 alpha. Sequencing analysis revealed that the fdhA gene contained 1,197-bp open reading frame, encoding a protein composed of 399 amino acid residues whose calculated molecular weight was 42,082. The transformant of E. coli DH5 alpha harboring the hybrid plasmid, pFDHK3DN71, showed about 50-fold-higher formaldehyde dehydrogenase activity than P. putida. The predicted amino acid sequence contained several features characteristic of the zinc-containing medium-chain alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) family. Most of the glycine residues strictly conserved within the family, including a Gly-Xaa-Gly-Xaa-Xaa-Gly pattern in the coenzyme binding domain, were well conserved in this enzyme. Regions around both the catalytic and the structural zinc atoms were also conserved. Analyses of structural and enzymatic characteristics indicated that P. putida FDH belongs to the medium-chain ADH family, with mixed properties of mammalian class I and III ADHs.
TI  - Cloning, heterologous expression, and sequencing of a novel proline iminopeptidase gene, pepI, from Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis DSM 7290.
AB  - The gene for proline iminopeptidase from Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis  DSM 7290 coding for an enzyme that hydrolyses the synthetic substrate L-prolyl-beta-naphthylamide (Pro-beta NA) was cloned in Escherichia coli. An enzymic plate assay was used to screen for positive clones. The gene, designated pepI, was subcloned into vector pUC18 and sequenced. The nucleotide sequence revealed an 882 bp open reading frame encoding 294 amino acids, coding for an enzyme with a calculated molecular mass of 32883 Da. By cloning under control of the lac promoter the peptidase was highly expressed. Sequence analysis showed that pepI is of a new sequence type, distinct from all peptidases so far sequenced. Amino acid homology to the active site of a Pseudomonas putida esterase and inhibitor studies of the enzyme imply involvement of a serine residue in catalysis.
TI  - Transformation of Pseudomonas putida by electroporation.
AB  - The optimum electrotransformation conditions were determined for Pseudomonas putida PpY101 with plasmid pSUP104 (9.5 kb) and pSR134 (18.6 kb). Field strength was a very important parameter for electrotransformation efficiency. Optimum efficiencies (1.1 x 10(5) transformants/micrograms DNA) with pSUP104 and pSR134 were obtained at a field strength of 12.5 kV/cm, a time constant of about 4.5 ms (resistance setting of 200 ohms), a supercoiled DNA concentration of 100 ng/ml, and a cell concentration of 10(9)/ml. Because the efficiency obtained is high enough, electrotransformation is useful for the direct cloning of P. putida PpY101. No significant relationship between plasmid size and electrotransformation efficiency was observed. These efficiencies were about 4.5 times higher than those using the MgCl2 method. Under these conditions, electrotransformation efficiencies of relaxed plasmid DNA treated with topoisomerase I and that linearized by EcoRI digestion were high.
TI  - Subtraction hybridisation and shot-gun sequencing: a new approach to identify symbiotic loci.
AB  - Traditionally, new loci involved in the Rhizobium-legume symbiosis have been identified by transposon mutagenesis and/or complementation. Wide dispersal of the symbiotic loci in Rhizobium species NGR234, as well as the large number of potential host-plants to be screened, greatly reduces the efficiency of these techniques. As an alternate strategy designed to identify new NGR234 genes involved in the early stages of the symbiosis, we combined data from competitive RNA hybridisation, subtractive DNA hybridisation and shot-gun sequencing. On the assumption that the expression of most nodulation genes is triggered by compounds released by the host-plant, we identified, in the ordered cosmid library of the large symbiotic plasmid pNGR234a, restriction fragments that carry transcripts induced by flavonoids. To target genes not present in the closely related strain R. fredii USDA257, we selected fragments that also carried sequences purified by subtractive DNA hybridisation. Shot-gun sequencing of this subset of fragments lead to the identification of sequences with strong homology to diverse prokaryotic genes/proteins. Amongst these, a symbiotically active ORF from pNGR234a, is highly homologous to the leucine responsive regulatory protein of Escherichia coli (Lrp), is induced by flavonoids, and is not present in USDA257.
TI  - Metabolism of naphthalene, fluorene, and phenanthrene: preliminary characterization of a cloned gene cluster from Pseudomonas putida NCIB 9816.
AB  - A modified cloning procedure was used to obtain large DNA insertions (20 to 30 kb) from Pseudomonas putida NCIB 9816 that expressed polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) transformation activity in Escherichia coli HB101. Four subclones (16 [in both orientations], 12, and 8.5 kb in size) were constructed from the initial clones. Naphthalene, fluorene, and phenanthrene transformations were investigated in these eight NCIB 9816 clones by a simple agar plate assay method, which was developed to detect and identify potential PAH metabolites. Results indicated that the necessary genes encoding the initial ring fission of the three PAHs in E. coli cells are located in an 8.5-kb EcoRI-XhoI portion, but the lower-pathway genes are not present in a 38-kb neighborhood region. These NCIB 9816 clones could transform naphthalene and phenanthrene to salicylic acid and 1-hydroxy-2-naphthoic acid, respectively. With the same clones, fluorene was degraded to 9-hydroxyfluorene, 9-fluorenone, and two unidentified compounds. Genetic similarity between the NAH7 upper-pathway genes and the cloned NCIB 9816 genes was confirmed by Southern blot DNA-DNA hybridization. In spite of this genetic similarity, the abilities of the two clusters to transform multiple PAHs were different. Under our experimental conditions, only the metabolites from naphthalene transformation by the NAH7 clone (pE317) were detected, whereas the NCIB 9816 clones produced metabolites from all three PAHs.
TI  - Efficient degradation of trichloroethylene by a hybrid aromatic ring dioxygenase.
AB  - Engineering of hybrid gene clusters between the toluene metabolic tod operon and  the biphenyl metabolic bph operon greatly enhanced the rate of biodegradation of trichloroethylene. Escherichia coli cells carrying a hybrid gene cluster composed of todC1 (the gene encoding the large subunit of toluene terminal dioxygenase in Pseudomonas putida F1), bphA2 (the gene encoding the small subunit of biphenyl terminal dioxygenase in Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes KF707), bphA3 (the gene encoding ferredoxin in KF707), and bphA4 (the gene encoding ferredoxin reductase in KF707) degraded trichloroethylene much faster than E. coli cells carrying the original toluene dioxygenase genes (todC1C2BA) or the original biphenyl dioxygenase genes (bphA1A2A3A4).
TI  - Sequence and structure comparison suggest that methionine aminopeptidase, prolidase, aminopeptidase P, and creatinase share a common fold.
AB  - Amino acid sequence comparison suggests that the structure of Escherichia coli methionine aminopeptidase (EC 3.4.11.18) and the C-terminal domain of Pseudomonas putida creatinase (EC 3.5.3.3) are related. A detailed comparison of the three-dimensional folds of the two enzymes confirms this homology: with an approximately 260-residue chain segment, 218 C alpha atoms of the structures superimpose within 2.5 A; only 41 of these overlapping positions (i.e., 19%) feature identical amino acids in the two protein chains. Notwithstanding this striking correspondence in structure, methionine aminopeptidase binds and is stimulated by Co2+, while creatinase is not a metal-dependent enzyme. Searches of protein data banks using sequence and structure-based profiles reveal other enzymes, including aminopeptidase P (EC 3.4.11.9), prolidase (EC 3.4.13.9), and agropine synthase, that likely share the same "pita-bread" fold common to creatinase and methionine aminopeptidase.
TI  - Analysis of three 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl 1,2-dioxygenases found in Rhodococcus globerulus P6. Identification of a new family of extradiol dioxygenases.
AB  - The polychlorobiphenyl-degrading bacterium Rhodococcus globerulus P6 contains three bphC genes encoding 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl 1,2-dioxygenases. One of them, bphC1, is clustered with the bphB gene which encodes 2,3-dihydroxy-4-phenylhexa-4,6-diene dehydrogenase and constitutes part of the bph operon specifying the degradation of biphenyl. The nucleotide sequence of bphB and the three bphC genes has been determined. The protein products of the bphBC1 gene cluster were found to exhibit significant homology with the corresponding proteins of analogous degradative pathways in Gram-negative bacteria; the highest homology was in those of the toluene degradation pathway of Pseudomonas putida strain F1. No homology was found between bphC2 and bphC3 and any other sequence in the database. At least two of the three meta cleavage enzymes are inducible by biphenyl. 2,3-Dihydroxybiphenyl 1,2-dioxygenase II, encoded by the bphC2 gene, was purified to apparent homogeneity from a recombinant Escherichia coli strain. The enzyme differed from other extradiol dioxygenases in having a subunit molecular mass of 21 kDa and a hexameric structure. The enzyme contains one tightly bound iron per subunit. These characteristics demonstrate that the 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl 1,2-dioxygenases encoded by bphC2 and bphC3 belong to a new class of extradiol dioxygenases.
TI  - Controlled-expression shuttle vector for pseudomonads based on the trpIBA genes of Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - A cloning vector pPS7 (8.5 kb) for Pseudomonas was constructed from pBR322 and the Pseudomonas cryptic low-copy-number pMK1 plasmid. The vector confers resistance to kanamycin (Km) and tetracycline (Tc), contains the par locus of Pseudomonas plasmid pMT2 and a mob site. The new vector was used for construction of controlled-expression vector pPS10 (10.4 kb) based on the trpIBA genes of Pseudomonas putida. This KmR vector contains the trpI gene, encoding activator protein and promoter of trpBA genes (Pba), which are inducible by TrpI and indoleglycerol phosphate (InGP). InGP is an unstable compound, but it accumulates in trpE mutants grown in anthranilate (Anth)-supplemented medium. We show that expression of the Escherichia coli pheA gene, inserted into the pPS10 vector downstream from Pba, increases about 70-fold upon InGP accumulation.
TI  - Transfer and expression of degradative and antibiotic resistance plasmids in acidophilic bacteria.
AB  - The genetic accessibility of selected acidophilic bacteria was investigated to evaluate their applicability to degrading pollutants in acidic environments. The IncP1 antibiotic resistance plasmids RP4 and pVK101 and the phenol degradation-encoding plasmid pPGH11 were transferred from neutrophilic bacteria into the extreme acidophilic eubacterium Acidiphilium cryptum at frequencies of 1.8 x 10(-2) to 9.8 x 10(-4) transconjugants per recipient cell. The IncQ antibiotic resistance plasmid pSUP106 was mobilizable to A. cryptum by triparental matings at a frequency of 10(-5) transconjugants per recipient cell. In the transconjugants, antibiotic resistances and the ability to degrade phenol were expressed. A. cryptum AC6 (pPGH11) grew with 2.5 mM phenol at a doubling time of 12 h and a yield of 0.52 g (dry cell weight) per g of phenol. A. cryptum harbored five native plasmids of 255 to 6.3 kb in size. Plasmids RP4 and pVK101 were transferred from Escherichia coli into Acidobacterium capsulatum at frequencies of 10(-3) and 2.3 x 10(-4) and to the facultative autotroph Thiobacillus acidophilus at frequencies of 1.1 x 10(-5) and 2.9 x 10(-6) transconjugants per recipient cell, respectively. Plasmid pPGH11 could not be transferred into the latter strains. T. acidophilus wild type contained six so far cryptic plasmids of 220 to 5 kb.
TI  - Cloning, sequencing, and expression in Escherichia coli of the D-hydantoinase gene from Pseudomonas putida and distribution of homologous genes in other microorganisms.
AB  - Pseudomonas putida DSM 84 produces N-carbamyl-D-amino acids from the corresponding D-5-monosubstituted hydantoins. The gene encoding this D-hydantoinase enzyme was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The nucleotide sequence of the 1.8-kb insert of subclone pGES19 was determined. One open reading frame of 1,104 bp was found and was predicted to encode a polypeptide with a molecular size of 40.5 kDa. Local regions of identity between the predicted amino acid sequence and that of other known amidohydrolases (two other D-hydantoinases, allantionase and dihydroorotase) were found. The D-hydantoinase gene was used as a probe to screen DNA isolated from diverse organisms. Within Pseudomonas strains of rRNA group I, the probe was specific. The probe did not detect D-hydantoinase genes in pseudomonads not in rRNA group I, other bacteria, or plants known to express D-hydantoinase activity.
TI  - Carbon source-dependent inhibition of xyl operon expression of the Pseudomonas putida TOL plasmid.
AB  - TOL plasmid-encoded degradation of benzyl alcohol by Pseudomonas putida is inhibited by glucose and other compounds related to the main carbohydrate metabolism in Pseudomonas species. We report here that this effect is exerted at the level of expression of the xyl catabolic operons, and two xyl promoters, Pu and Ps, were identified as the primary targets of this inhibition. xyl promoter activation was also inhibited by glucose in the heterologous Escherichia coli system, apparently not however by the classical mechanism of enteric catabolite repression.
TI  - 3-Carboxy-cis,cis-muconate lactonizing enzyme from Neurospora crassa: an alternate cycloisomerase motif.
AB  - 3-Carboxy-cis,cis-muconate lactonizing enzyme (CMLE; EC 5.5.1.5) from Neurospora  crassa catalyzes the reversible gamma-lactonization of 3-carboxy-cis,cis-muconate by a syn-1,2 addition-elimination reaction. The stereochemical and regiochemical course of the reaction is (i) opposite that of CMLE from Pseudomonas putida (EC 5.5.1.2) and (ii) identical to that of cis,cis-muconate lactonizing enzyme (MLE; EC 5.5.1.1) from P. putida. In order to determine the mechanistic and evolutionary relationships between N. crassa CMLE and the procaryotic cycloisomerases, we have purified CMLE from N. crassa to homogeneity and determined its nucleotide sequence from a cDNA clone isolated from a p-hydroxybenzoate-induced N. crassa cDNA library. The deduced amino acid sequence predicts a protein of 41.2 kDa (365 residues) which does not exhibit sequence similarity with any of the bacterial cycloisomerases. The cDNA encoding N. crassa CMLE was expressed in Escherichia coli, and the purified recombinant protein exhibits physical and kinetic properties equivalent to those found for the isolated N. crassa enzyme. We also report that N. crassa CMLE possesses substantially reduced yet significant levels of MLE activity with cis,cis-muconate and, furthermore, does not appear to be dependent on divalent metals for activity. These data suggest that the N. crassa CMLE may represent a novel eucaryotic motif in the cycloisomerase enzyme family.
TI  - Cloning and nucleotide sequence of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa glucose-selective OprB porin gene and distribution of OprB within the family Pseudomonadaceae.
AB  - OprB is a glucose-selective porin known to be produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa  and Pseudomonas putida. We have cloned and sequenced the oprB gene of P. aeruginosa and obtained expression of OprB in Escherichia coli. The mature protein consists of 423 amino acid residues with a deduced molecular mass of 47597 Da. Several clusters of amino acid residues, potentially involved in the structure or function of the protein, were identified. An area of regional homology with E. coli LamB was also identified. Carbohydrate-inducible proteins, potentially homologous to OprB, were identified in several rRNA homology-group-I pseudomonads by sodium dodecyl sulfate/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis, Western immunoblotting and N-terminal amino acid sequencing. These species also contained DNA that hybridized to a P. aeruginosa oprB gene probe.
TI  - Fur regulon in gram-negative bacteria. Identification and characterization of new iron-regulated Escherichia coli genes by a fur titration assay.
AB  - A highly sensitive genetic screen for the detection of cloned genes coding for iron-regulated and iron-storage/binding proteins was developed. The Fur titration assay (FURTA) enabled identification of cloned iron-regulated genes from different Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria such as: Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Pantoea agglomerans, Pseudomonas putida, Salmonella typhimurium, Serratia marcescens and Yersinia enterocolitica. An ordered E. coli cosmid library was screened for either new genes containing Fur-box nucleotide sequences or genes coding for iron-storage/binding proteins. Among 150 cosmids covering approximately 85% of the E. coli genome, 24 cosmids were identified as positive by FURTA. Nine of them contained new E. coli Fur-regulated genes and/or iron-storage/binding genes since they mapped at loci different to any of the known Fur-box containing genes. A new E. coli gene encoding a 8.7 kDa high-potential iron-sulfur-like protein was identified, cloned and sequenced. The Fur titration assay was also used to probe in vivo interaction between Fur repressor and different synthetic plasmid-located Fur-boxes. Non-optimal base-pairs in one half of the Fur-box nucleotide sequence led to a dramatic decrease of Fur repressor affinity. A synthetic Fur-box with changes in both Fur-box halves was no longer bound by the Fur repressor complex in vivo.
TI  - [Controlled-expression vector for Pseudomonas bacteria involving regulatory elements of trpIBA genes of Pseudomonas putida].
AB  - A bireplicon controlled-expression vector pPS10 was developed based, on trpIBA genes of Pseudomonas putida. It is a low-copy-number vector in Pseudomonas bacteria, and a high-copy-number vector in Escherichia coli. The vector is 10.4 kilobase pairs (kb), determines resistance to kanamycin, carries a replicon of cryptic Pseudomonas pMK1 plasmid; a pBR322 replicon; the par locus of pMT2 plasmid; and the trpI gene of P. putida, which encodes the activator protein and the promoter Pba of trpBA genes. Expression of the promoter is induced by the TrpI protein activator and the precursor of tryptophan, indole-3-glycerolphosphate (InGP). InGP is an unstable compound, and its accumulation in bacterial cells is ensured by using trpE mutants grown in the presence of anthranilate; no InGP is produced among trpE mutants on the media supplemented with tryptophan. As shown in the pheA gene of E. coli, the expression of genetic material cloned under control of the Pba promoter into the pPS10 vector, may be enhanced more than 70-fold in cells of Pseudomonas under conditions of InGP accumulation.
TI  - Construction of hybrid biphenyl (bph) and toluene (tod) genes for functional analysis of aromatic ring dioxygenases.
AB  - Multicomponent enzyme complexes of biphenyl (BP) dioxygenase (Dox) encoded by the gene cluster, bphA1A2A3A4 in Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes strain KF707 [Taira et al., J. Biol. Chem. 267 (1992) 4844-4858] and toluene Dox encoded by the gene cluster, todC1C2BA in P. putida strain F1 [Zylstra et al., J. Biol. Chem. 264 (1989) 14940-14946], show high homologies (approx. 60%) for the corresponding subunit component in spite of the fact that they have discrete substrate specificities. We constructed hybrid gene clusters by replacing the gene component(s) between the large and small subunits of terminal Dox in the bph and tod gene clusters, and analyzed the function of a novel hybrid aromatic ring Dox. Escherichia coli cells expressing the hybrid gene clusters, todC1::bphA2A3A4, todC1C2::bphA3A4 and bphA1::todC2::bphA3A4, gained the ability to convert benzene-toluene and their derivatives to the dihydrodiols, indicating that the hybrid terminal Dox composed of TodC1::BphA2 and BphA1::TodC2 forms a functionally active multicomponent Dox associated with ferredoxin (Fer) (BphA3) and Fer reductase (BphA4). Moreover, hybrid Dox (composed of TodC1::BphA2A3A4 and TodC1C2::BphA3A4) showed a wide substrate specificity rather similar to that of the wild-type toluene Dox (TodC1C2BA). On the other hand, the hybrid Dox (BphA1::TodC2::BphA3A4) showed oxidative activities for the same compounds, but the rate of oxidation was dependent upon the substrate. These results suggest that (i) the two subunits of terminal Dox are critically involved in the substrate specificity for BP, benzene and their derivatives, and (ii) the electron transport proteins, Fer and Fer reductase, are exchangeable with one another between the BP Dox and toluene Dox complexes.
TI  - Putative functions of phenylalanine-350 of Pseudomonas putida cytochrome P-450cam.
AB  - Cytochrome P-450cam hydroxylates d-camphor, using molecular oxygen and reducing equivalents transferred via putidaredoxin. We constructed mutant genes in which Phe-350 of P-450cam was replaced by Leu, Tyr, or His by site-directed mutagenesis, expressed them in Escherichia coli, purified the mutant proteins, and compared their enzymic properties with those of the wild type P-450cam. NADH oxidation rate of the Tyr mutant in the reconstituted system with putidaredoxin and putidaredoxin reductase was similar to that of the wild type enzyme, while the Leu mutant and the His mutant showed 67% and 17% activity of that of the wild type, respectively. The affinities of these mutant proteins for camphor and the oxidized form of putidaredoxin were much the same as those of the wild type protein. Rate constants for the reduction reaction of P-450cam by reduced putidaredoxin, a physiological electron donor for P-450cam, of Tyr and His mutants were much the same as that of the wild type enzyme, whereas the Leu mutant showed approx. half that of the wild type. Thus, the aromatic ring of Phe-350 of P-450cam probably contributes to enhancing efficiency of the electron transfer yet does not seem to be essential for the reaction.
TI  - FptA, the Fe(III)-pyochelin receptor of Pseudomonas aeruginosa: a phenolate siderophore receptor homologous to hydroxamate siderophore receptors.
AB  - The Pseudomonas aeruginosa siderophore pyochelin is structurally unique among siderophores and possesses neither hydroxamate- nor catecholate-chelating groups. The structural gene encoding the 75-kDa outer membrane Fe(III)-pyochelin receptor FptA has been isolated by plasmid rescue techniques and sequenced. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the isolated FptA protein corresponded to that deduced from the nucleotide sequence of the fptA structural gene. The mature FptA protein has 682 amino acids and a molecular mass of 75,993 Da and has considerable overall homology with the hydroxamate siderophore receptors FpvA of P. aeruginosa, PupA and PupB of Pseudomonas putida, and FhuE of Escherichia coli. This observation indicates that homologies between siderophore receptors are an unreliable predictor of siderophore ligand class recognition by a given receptor. The fptA gene was strongly regulated by iron; fptA transcription was totally repressed by 30 microM FeCl3, as determined by Northern (RNA) blotting. The promoter of the fptA gene contained the sequence 5'-ATAATGATAAGCATTATC-3', which matches the consensus E. coli Fur-binding site at 17 of 18 positions. The -10 promoter region and transcriptional start site of the fptA gene reside within this Fur-binding site.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence analysis and potential environmental distribution of a ferric pseudobactin receptor gene of Pseudomonas sp. strain M114.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of the Pseudomonas sp. strain M114 pbuA gene, encoding the outer membrane receptor for ferric pseudobactin M114, has been determined. The region sequenced spans 2788 bases of plasmid pCUP3, within which the receptor gene had previously been localised. A single open reading frame, potentially encoding 826 amino acids and including a leader peptide of 44 amino acids, is evident and is followed by an inverted repeat segment, which may act as a transcriptional terminator. A 20 bp region of DNA, having significant homology with the E. coli Fur-binding consensus sequence, is located upstream of the open reading frame. PbuA displays characteristics in common with other outer membrane proteins and displays strong homology with the TonB boxes of both E. coli and Pseudomonas receptors. More extensive homologies were found with the PupA receptor of P. putida WCS358 and the FhuE and BtuB receptors of E. coli. It is suggested that areas exhibiting the least homology between these receptors may represent ferric siderophore-specific recognition sites of the PbuA protein. The deduced amino acid sequence of pbuA was compared with that of pupX, encoding the outer membrane receptor for ferric pseudobactin B10, of Pseudomonas sp. strain B 10. A direct alignment of the two proteins gave an identity score of 92.5%. The distribution of PbuA-like receptors among Pseudomonas isolates was investigated by DNA-DNA hybridisation analysis. The results suggest that a PbuA-like receptor may be widely distributed among Pseudomonas rhizosphere isolates.
TI  - Molecular characterization of microbial alcohol dehydrogenases.
AB  - There is an astonishing array of microbial alcohol oxidoreductases. They display  a wide variety of substrate specificities and they fulfill several vital but quite different physiological functions. Some of these enzymes are involved in the production of alcoholic beverages and of industrial solvents, others are important in the production of vinegar, and still others participate in the degradation of naturally occurring and xenobiotic aromatic compounds as well as in the growth of bacteria and yeasts on methanol. They can be divided into three major categories. (1) The NAD- or NADP-dependent dehydrogenases. These can in turn be divided into the group I long-chain (approximately 350 amino acid residues) zinc-dependent enzymes such as alcohol dehydrogenases I, II, and III of Saccharomyces cerevisiae or the plasmid-encoded benzyl alcohol dehydrogenase of Pseudomonas putida; the group II short-chain (approximately 250 residues) zinc-independent enzymes such as ribitol dehydrogenase of Klebsiella aerogenes; the group III "iron-activated" enzymes that generally contain approximately 385 amino acid residues, such as alcohol dehydrogenase II of Zymomonas mobilis and alcohol dehydrogenase IV of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, but may contain almost 900 residues in the case of the multifunctional alcohol dehydrogenases of Escherichia coli and Clostridium acetobutylicum. The aldehyde/alcohol oxidoreductase of Amycolatopsis methanolica and the methanol dehydrogenases of A. methanolica and Mycobacterium gasti are 4-nitroso-N,N-dimethylaniline-dependent nicotinoproteins. (2) NAD(P)-independent enzymes that use pyrroloquinoline quinone, haem or cofactor F420 as cofactor, exemplified by methanol dehydrogenase of Paracoccus denitrificans, ethanol dehydrogenase of Acetobacter and Gluconobacter spp. and the alcohol dehydrogenases of certain archaebacteria. (3) Oxidases that catalyze an essentially irreversible oxidation of alcohols, such as methanol oxidase of Hansenula polymorpha and probably the veratryl alcohol oxidases of certain fungi involved in lignin degradation. This review deals mainly with those enzymes for which complete amino acid sequences are available. The discussion focuses on a comparison of their primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures and their catalytic mechanisms. The physiological roles of the enzymes and isoenzymes are also considered, as are their probable evolutionary relationships.
TI  - Two related bacterial membrane proteins, ExbD and ToIR, have opposite transmembrane charge dipolarity.

TI  - Molecular analysis of the Erwinia chrysanthemi region containing the kdgA and zwf genes.
AB  - The pathways of pectin and galacturonate catabolism in Erwinia chrysanthemi converge to form a common intermediate, 2-keto-3-deoxygluconate, which is phosphorylated to form 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate (KDGP) and then cleaved by the aldolase encoded by the kdgA gene. We cloned the kdgA gene of the E. chrysanthemi strain 3937 by complementing an Escherichia coli kdgA mutation, using an RP4-derivative plasmid. Restriction mapping of the kdgA region and isolation of kdgA-lac fusions allowed the more precise localization of the kdgA gene and determination of its transcriptional direction. The nucleotide sequence of the kdgA region indicated that the kdgA reading frame is 639 bases long, corresponding to a protein of 213 amino acids with a molecular mass of 22,187 Da. Comparison of the deduced primary amino acid sequences of the E. chrysanthemi KDGP-aldolase to the E. coli, Zymomonas mobilis and Pseudomonas putida enzymes showed that they are highly conserved. The E. chrysanthemi kdgA structural gene begins 153 bases downstream of an open reading frame that has a high homology with the zwf E. coli gene encoding glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. The zwf gene is also linked to eda (kdgA) in E. coli and P. putida but genetic organization is different. Regulation of zwf and kdgA expression in E. chrysanthemi was analysed using lacZ fusions. The expression of zwf is independent of the growth rate, but is repressed in the presence of glucose. Induction of kdgA by pectin-degradation products is mediated in vivo by the negative regulatory gene kdgR, which also controls all the steps of pectin degradation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - 1-amino-2-imidazol-4'-ylethylphosphonic acid is a potent reversible inhibitor of  Pseudomonas putida histidine ammonia-lyase.
AB  - A phosphonic acid analogue of L-histidine, 1-amino-2-imidazol-4'-ylethylphosphonic acid (HisP), was identified as a reversible competitive inhibitor of histidine ammonia-lyase (histidase). The affinity of histidase for HisP was pH dependent, with Ki values of 0.28 microM and 10.4 microM compared to substrate Km values of 1 and 5 mM at pH 7 and 9, respectively. HisP did not appear to be a substrate for histidase. A twenty-fold molar excess of HisP over enzyme completely protected the active site of histidase from inactivation by 10 mM bisulfite. Neither isohistidine nor two other phosphonic acid compounds were inhibitory towards histidase when tested at 1 mM concentration.
TI  - Cloning and sequence analysis of a plasmid-encoded 2-haloacid dehalogenase gene from Pseudomonas putida No. 109.
AB  - The 2-haloacid dehalogenase of Pseudomonas putida No. 109 was mediated by a 74-kb conjugative plasmid, which was transferred by mating into Pseudomonas and Escherichia coli and there expressed the dehalogenase. A 2.8-kb EcoRI-fragment generated from the plasmid was cloned and sequenced. The dehalogenase gene (dehH109) was identified by comparison with the N-terminal amino acid sequence and the molecular weight of the enzyme protein. The gene dehH109 coded for a 224-amino acid protein of M(r) 25,231, which showed significant homology to the other four L-specific 2-haloacid dehalogenases from Pseudomonas sp. CBS3, P. putida AJ1, and Xanthobacter autotrophicus GJ10 and also to the haloacetate dehalogenase H-2 from Moraxella sp. strain B, but no homology with another haloacetate dehalogenase H-1 and the D-specific 2-haloacid dehalogenase from P. putida AJ1.
TI  - A general method for identification of polyhydroxyalkanoic acid synthase genes from pseudomonads belonging to the rRNA homology group I.
AB  - Using a 30-mer oligonucleotide probe highly specific for polyhydroxyalkanoic acid (PHA) synthase genes, the respective genes of Pseudomonas citronellolis, P. mendocina, Pseudomonas sp. DSM 1650 and Pseudomonas sp. GP4BH1 were cloned from genomic libraries in the cosmid pHC79. A 19.5-kbp and a 22.0-kbp EcoRI restriction fragment of P. citronellolis or Pseudomonas sp. DSM 1650, respectively, conferred the ability to accumulate PHA of medium-chain-length 3-hydoxyalkanoic acids (HAMCL) from octanoate as well as from gluconate to the PHA-negative mutant P. putida GPp104. An 11.0-kbp EcoRI fragment was cloned from P. mendocina, which restored in GPp104 the ability to synthesize PHA from octanoate but not from gluconate. From Pseudomonas sp. GP4BH1 three different genomic fragments encoding PHA synthases were cloned. This indicated that strain GP4BH1 possesses three different functionally active PHA synthases. Two of these fragments (6.4 kbp and 3.8 kbp) encoded for a PHA synthase, preferentially incorporating hydroxyalkanoic acids of short chain length (HASCL), and the synthases were expressed in either GPp104 and Alcaligenes eutrophus H16-PHB-4, respectively. The PHA synthase encoded by the third fragment (6.5 kbp) led to the incorporation of HAMCL and was expressed in GPp104 but not in PHB-4.
TI  - Construction of chromosomal recA mutants of Pseudomonas putida PpG2.
AB  - The recA gene of Pseudomonas putida PpG2 was cloned by complementation of the recA mutations of Escherichia coli strains DH5 alpha and HB101. The nucleotide sequence of the DNA fragment was determined and shown to contain recA and a downstream partial open reading frame. Two mutants of P. putida PpG2, strains JS387 and JS388, were constructed by insertional inactivation of recA with a tetracycline-resistance gene in both orientations. Both mutants acquired sensitivity to methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) and both failed to undergo homologous recombination. While the recA mutation of P. putida JS388 was complemented in trans by recA of P. putida, the JS387 mutant was difficult to transform and transformants exhibited varying degrees of sensitivity to MMS. Therefore, P. putida JS388 can be used as a carrier of recombinant plasmids, but JS387 is not a suitable host for this purpose.
TI  - A mutagenesis system utilizing a Tn1722 derivative containing an Escherichia coli-specific vector plasmid: application to Pseudomonas species.
AB  - A novel transposon (Tn) mutagenesis system for Gram- non-enteric bacteria was developed which allowed rapid and one-step cloning of the mutated region in Escherichia coli. The Tn constructed was Tn1722-299Km, a Tn1722 derivative containing a KmR gene and the entire sequence of an E. coli-specific plasmid, pACYC184. The hybrid plasmid consisting of Tn1722-299Km and the transfer genes of plasmid R388 was conjugally transferred from E. coli to Pseudomonas putida or P. aeruginosa, and selection of the transconjugants expressing the Tn-specified resistance genes led to isolation of insertion mutants of the recipient strain. The presence of the pACYC184 replicon in the Tn greatly facilitated rapid and easy cloning of the mutated region in E. coli through (i) mini-scale preparation of the genomic DNA from the Tn-inserted mutant, (ii) digestion of the DNA with an appropriate restriction endonuclease, (iii) self-ligation, and (iv) transformation of E. coli to recover the plasmid carrying the Tn-specified resistance marker. This procedure was successfully adapted to clone the Tn-inserted trpBA region of P. putida. Such a cloned region was further employed to isolate the wild-type allele of the trpBA region without construction of a genomic library.
TI  - Regulation of the catechol 1,2-dioxygenase- and phenol monooxygenase-encoding pheBA operon in Pseudomonas putida PaW85.
AB  - In Pseudomonas putida PaW85, the ortho-cleavage pathway is used for catechol degradation. The 11.4-kb XhoI fragment cloned from phenol degradation plasmid pEST1226 into pKT240 (recombinant plasmid pAT1140) contains the inducible pheBA operon that encodes catechol 1,2-dioxygenase (gene pheB) and phenol monooxygenase (gene pheA), the first two enzymes for the phenol degradation pathway. The promoter of the pheBA operon is mapped 1.5 kb upstream of the pheB gene. The plasmid pAT1140, when introduced into P. putida PaW85, enables the bacteria to use the hybrid plasmid-chromosome-encoded pathway for phenol degradation. The synthesis of the plasmid-encoded phenol monooxygenase and catechol 1,2-dioxygenase is induced by cis,cis-muconate. The expression studies of the deletion subclones derived from pAT1140 revealed that the transcription of the pheBA operon is positively controlled by a regulatory protein that is chromosomally encoded in P. putida. cis,cis-Muconate in cooperation with positive transcription factor CatR activates the transcription of the chromosomal ortho-pathway genes catA and catBC in P. putida (R. K. Rothmel, T. L. Aldrich, J. E. Houghton, W. M. Coco, L. N. Ornston, and A. M. Chakrabarty, J. Bacteriol. 172:922-931, 1990). The inability to express the pheBA operon in a P. putida CatR- background and activation of transcription of the pheBA operon in Escherichia coli in the presence of the catR-expressing plasmid demonstrated that the transcription of the pheBA operon in P. putida PaW85 carrying pEST1226 is controlled by the chromosomally encoded CatR.
TI  - Evidence for autoregulation of camR, which encodes a repressor for the cytochrome P-450cam hydroxylase operon on the Pseudomonas putida CAM plasmid.
AB  - The regulatory gene camR on the CAM plasmid of Pseudomonas putida (ATCC 17453) negatively controls expression of the cytochrome P-450cam hydroxylase operon (camDCAB) for the camphor degradation pathway and is oriented in a direction opposite to that of the camDCAB operon. In this study, we examined expression of the camR gene by monitoring the beta-galactosidase activity of camR-lacZ translational fusions in P. putida camR and camR+ strains. We found that the camR gene was autogenously regulated by its own product, CamR. To search for an operator site of the camR gene, a cam repressor (CamR)-overproducing plasmid, pHAOV1, was constructed by placing the camR gene under the control of a pL promoter. The translational initiation codon of CamR was changed by site-directed mutagenesis from GTG to ATG to improve translation efficiency. Judging from sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis, the CamR protein was expressed up to about 10% of the soluble protein of CamR-overproducing Escherichia coli JM83/pHAOV1 cells. Results of DNase I footprinting assays using the cell lysate indicated that the CamR repressor covered a single region between the camR gene and the camDCAB operon. Our findings also suggest that the camR gene autogenously regulates its own expression by binding of the gene product, CamR, to the operator, which also serves as an operator of the camDCAB operon.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity and biosynthesis of indole antibiotics produced by Xenorhabdus nematophilus.
AB  - We have investigated the mechanism of action and physiology of production of the  indole derivative antibiotics produced by the nematode-associated, entomopathogenic bacterium Xenorhabdus nematophilus. Maximum antibiotic concentration was reached during the late stationary phase of growth, and the antibiotic yield was appreciably enhanced by supplementation with tryptophan. Antibiotic biosynthesis apparently involved the removal of the side-chain carboxyl (C-1) carbon of tryptophan. The C-3 methylene carbon of tryptophan, on the other hand, was retained. The purified indole antibiotic was effective against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria at low to moderate concentrations causing a severe inhibition of RNA synthesis, accompanied by a less severe effect on protein synthesis. An isogenic pair of Escherichia coli strains differing at the relA locus was used to demonstrate that the swift reduction in total RNA synthesis is related to an antibiotic-induced accumulation of the regulatory nucleotide, ppGpp, in susceptible bacteria. The E. coli relA mutant, which does not exhibit any discernible increase in ppGpp upon antibiotic treatment, showed no decrease in growth or RNA synthesis. Using this antibiotic, it was also observed that ppGpp may be employed as a metabolic regulator in bacteria such as Pseudomonas putida, which have not previously been reported to employ ppGpp as a regulatory molecule. We propose that the indole derivative antibiotic exerts growth inhibitory control in susceptible bacteria by greatly enhancing synthesis of ppGpp, resulting in a rapid inhibition of RNA synthesis.
TI  - Essentiality of the three carboxyl-terminal amino acids of the plasmid RK2 replication initiation protein TrfA for DNA binding and replication activity in gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - In a previous study of mutations in trfA, the gene encoding the replication initiation protein of the broad host-range plasmid RK2, a carboxyl-terminal deletion of 3 amino acids of the TrfA protein was found to be completely nonfunctional for RK2 replication in Escherichia coli and other Gram-negative bacteria. In this work site-directed mutagenesis of the trfA gene was carried out to construct TrfA proteins altered in the three carboxyl-terminal positions. Specifically, TrfA proteins with deletions or substitutions of the terminal cysteine, lysine, and arginine (codons 380-382, respectively) were constructed and characterized for their ability to initiate replication from an RK2 origin in vivo in E. coli, Azotobacter vinelandii, Pseudomonas putida, and Agrobacterium tumefaciens and for binding activity to the iterons at the replication origin. Substitutions of the cysteine at position 380 with a glycine or an arginine resulted in a TrfA protein defective in binding to the RK2 origin and, therefore, defective in replication initiation activity in all four Gram-negative bacteria. Substitution of a serine at that position preserved limited function in replication and DNA binding. The lysine at position 381 could be changed to a glutamine without any obvious change in TrfA function. Deletion of the terminal arginine at position 382 did not affect the ability of TrfA to bind to origin iterons but caused a complete loss of replication activity in all four bacteria. Substitution of this terminal arginine with alanine, serine, or glutamic acid also produced replication-defective TrfA protein in all four bacterial hosts while not affecting iteron binding activity. However, substitution of this arginine with a lysine resulted in a loss of replication activity in E. coli and A. vinelandii but had no effect in P. putida and A. tumefaciens. These observations suggest that the terminal arginine plays an essential role in the activity of the TrfA protein, possibly interaction with host proteins, which can be separated from its iteron binding activity.
TI  - A substrate-dependent biological containment system for Pseudomonas putida based  on the Escherichia coli gef gene.
AB  - A model substrate-dependent suicide system to biologically contain Pseudomonas putida KT2440 is reported. The system consists of two elements. One element carries a fusion between a synthetic lac promoter (PA1-04/03) and the gef gene, which encodes a killing function. This element is contained within a transposaseless mini-Tn5 transposon so that it can be integrated at random locations on the Pseudomonas chromosome. The second element, harbored by plasmid pCC102, is designed to control the first and bears a fusion between the promoter of the P. putida TOL plasmid-encoded meta-cleavage pathway operon (Pm) and the lacI gene, encoding the Lac repressor, plus xylS2, coding for a positive regulator of Pm. In liquid culture under optimal growth conditions and in sterile and nonsterile soil microcosms, P. putida KT2440 (pWWO) bearing the containment system behaves as designed. In the presence of a XylS effector, such as m-methylbenzoate, the LacI protein is synthesized, preventing the expression of the killing function. In the absence of effectors, expression of the PA1-04/03::gef cassette is no longer prevented and a high rate of cell killing is observed. Fluctuation test analyses revealed that mutants resistant to cell killing arise at a frequency of around 10(-5) to 10(-6) per cell per generation. Mutations are linked to the killing element rather than to the regulatory one. In bacteria bearing two copies of the killing cassette, the rate of appearance of mutants resistant to killing decreased to as low as 10(-8) per cell per generation.
TI  - Early and late responses of TOL promoters to pathway inducers: identification of  postexponential promoters in Pseudomonas putida with lacZ-tet bicistronic reporters.
AB  - Transcriptional lacZ fusions to the Pu and Pm promoters of the TOL (toluene degradation) plasmid inserted in monocopy in the chromosome of Pseudomonas putida showed a very different responsiveness to their respective aromatic effectors regarding growth phase. While a substantial XylS-dependent activation of Pm-lacZ was detected nearly instantly after m-toluate addition, XylR- and xylene-mediated induction of the sigma 54 promoter Pu became significant only after cells slowed down exponential growth and entered stationary phase. When Pu and Pm were fused to lacZ-tet reporters (i.e., promoterless lacZ genes coupled to a tet gene which confers resistance to tetracycline when cotranscribed with the leading gene) instead of lacZ alone, the resulting colonies displayed a distinct phenotype consisting of hyperfluorescence on agar plates after being sprayed with 4-methylumbelliferyl-beta-D-galactoside, simultaneously with being either sensitive (Pu) or resistant (Pm) to tetracycline. To examine whether the same phenotype could be scored in strains carrying transcriptional fusions of the lacZ-tet cassettes to other genes or promoters whose expression is silenced during growth and activated in stationary phase, we constructed mini-Tn5 lacZ-tet transposons for random genetic probing of promoters preferentially active at advanced stages of growth. Chromosomal insertions of this mobile element were selected by means of the constitutive resistance to kanamycin which is also specified by the transposon. A number of kanamycin-resistant colonies which are hyperfluorescent with 4-methylumbelliferyl-beta-D-galactosidase but sensitive to tetracycline and which reached full induction only at postexponential growth stages were obtained.
TI  - Cloning, sequencing, and expression of the Pseudomonas putida protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase genes.
AB  - The genes that encode the alpha and beta subunits of protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase (3,4-PCD [EC 1.13.11.3]) were cloned from a Pseudomonas putida (formerly P. aeruginosa) (ATCC 23975) genomic library prepared in lambda phage. Plaques were screened by hybridization with degenerate oligonucleotides designed using known amino acid sequences. A 1.5-kb SmaI fragment from a 15-kb primary clone was subcloned, sequenced, and shown to contain two successive open reading frames, designated pcaH and pcaG, corresponding to the beta and alpha subunits, respectively, of 3,4-PCD. The amino acid sequences deduced from pcaHG matched the chemically determined sequence of 3,4-PCD in all except three positions. Cloning of pcaHG into broad-host-range expression vector pKMY319 allowed high levels of expression in P. putida strains, as well as in Proteus mirabilis after specific induction of the plasmid-encoded nahG promoter with salicylate. The recombinant enzyme was purified and crystallized from P. mirabilis, which lacks an endogenous 3,4-PCD. The physical, spectroscopic, and kinetic properties of the recombinant enzyme were indistinguishable from those of the wild-type enzyme. Moreover, the same transient enzyme intermediates were formed during the catalytic cycle. These studies establish the methodology which will allow mechanistic investigations to be pursued through site-directed mutagenesis of P. putida 3,4-PCD, the only aromatic ring-cleaving dioxygenase for which the three-dimensional structure is known.
TI  - CbbR, a LysR-type transcriptional activator, is required for expression of the autotrophic CO2 fixation enzymes of Xanthobacter flavus.
AB  - Xanthobacter flavus is able to grow autotrophically with the enzymes of the Calvin cycle for the fixation of CO2, which are specified by the cbbLSXFP gene cluster. Previously, the 5' end of an open reading frame (cbbR), displaying a high sequence similarity to the LysR family of regulatory proteins and transcribed divergently from cbbLSXFP, was identified (W. G. Meijer, A. C. Arnberg, H. G. Enequist, P. Terpstra, M. E. Lidstrom, and L. Dijkhuizen, Mol. Gen. Genet. 225:320-330, 1991). This paper reports the complete nucleotide sequence of cbbR and a functional characterization of the gene. The cbbR gene of X. flavus specifies a 333-amino-acid polypeptide, with a molecular weight of 35,971. Downstream from cbbR, the 3' end of an open reading frame displaying a high similarity to ORF60K from Pseudomonas putida and ORF261 from Bacillus subtilis was identified. ORF60K and ORF261 are located at the replication origin of the bacterial chromosome. Inactivation of cbbR, via the insertion of an antibiotic resistance gene, rendered X. flavus unable to grow autotrophically. This was caused not by an inability to oxidize autotrophic substrates (e.g., formate) but by a complete lack of expression of the cbb genes. The expression of the CbbR protein in Escherichia coli was achieved by placing cbbR behind a strong promoter and optimization of the translational signals of cbbR. CbbR binds specifically to two binding sites in the cbbR-cbbL intergenic region.
TI  - Stabilization of creatinase from Pseudomonas putida by random mutagenesis.
AB  - Creatinase (creatine amidinohydrolase, EC 3.5.3.3) from Pseudomonas putida is a homodimer of 45 kDa subunit molecular mass, the three-dimensional structure of which is known at 1.9 A resolution. Three point mutants, A109V, V355M, and V182I, as well as one double mutant combining A109V and V355M, and the triple mutant with all three replacements, were compared with wild-type creatinase regarding their physical and enzymological properties. High-resolution crystal data for wild-type creatinase and the first two mutants suggest isomorphism at least for these three proteins (R. Huber, pers. comm.). Physicochemical measurements confirm this prediction, showing that the mutations have no effect either on the quaternary structure and gross conformation or the catalytic properties as compared to wild-type creatinase. The replacement of V182 (at the solvent-exposed end of the first helix of the C-terminal domain) does not cause significant differences in comparison with the wild-type enzyme. The other point mutations stabilize the first step in the biphasic denaturation transition without affecting the second one. In sum, the enhanced stability seems to reflect slight improvements in the local packing without creating new well-defined bonds. The increase in hydrophobicity generated by the introduction of additional methyl groups (A109V, V182I) must be compensated by minor readjustments of the global structure. Secondary or quaternary interactions are not affected. In going from single to double and triple mutants, to a first approximation, the increments of stabilization are additive.
TI  - Purification and characterization of Pseudomonas putida histidine ammonia-lyase expressed in Escherichia coli.
AB  - Histidine ammonia-lyase (HAL) from Pseudomonas putida PRS1 contains a catalytically important electrophilic center reported to be dehydroalanine. Little is known about the origin of this group or its linkage to the protein. To initiate structural studies on this enzyme, P. putida HAL was purified from an Escherichia coli high-expression clone in which the HAL gene (hutH) was under the control of the lambda PL promoter on a plasmid vector. In this clone from 6 to 10% of the soluble cell protein after heat induction was HAL and approximately 200 mg of 95% pure HAL could be obtained from 120 g wet weight of cells in a 40 to 60% yield. The overexpressed protein was identical to P. putida HAL in native molecular weight (220 kDa), subunit composition (four identical subunits of 53 kDa each), affinity for substrate (L-histidine Km of 5.3 mM at pH 9.0), and its sensitivity to inactivation by cyanide and bisulfite. The N-terminal amino acid sequence was in agreement with the DNA-predicted sequence, indicating proper translational initiation. These features make this enzyme an appropriate candidate for protein structure investigations regarding the nature of the electrophilic center and its association with the protein.
TI  - Identification and characterization of a siderophore regulatory gene (pfrA) of Pseudomonas putida WCS358: homology to the alginate regulatory gene algQ of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - Genes encoding biosynthesis of pseudobactin 358 (a microbial iron transport agent) and its cognate outer membrane receptor protein, PupA, are transcribed only under iron limitation in plant growth-promoting Pseudomonas putida WCS358. Two cosmid clones were identified from a gene bank of WCS358 DNA which could independently and in an iron-dependent manner activate transcription from a WCS358 siderophore gene promoter in heterologous Pseudomonas strain A225. The functional region of one of the clones was localized by subcloning, transposon Tn3Gus mutagenesis, and DNA sequencing. Genomic transposon insertion mutants in the functional region lost the capacity to activate a siderophore gene promoter fusion transcriptionally; furthermore, these mutants no longer produced pseudobactin 358. The activating region consisted of a single gene designated pfrA (Pseudomonas ferric regulator). The pfrA gene codes for a single polypeptide, PfrA, of approximately 18 kDa, which has 58% identity to AlgQ (also known as AlgR2), a positive regulator involved in transcriptionally regulating alginate biosynthesis in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Cross-complementation studies between the pfrA gene of P. putida and the algQ gene of P. aeruginosa revealed that pfrA can restore mucoidy (alginate production) in an algQ mutant and that algQ could poorly complement a pfrA genomic mutant. It is concluded that PfrA is involved in the positive regulation of siderophore biosynthetic genes in response to iron limitation; furthermore, pfrA and algQ appeared to be interchangeable between P. putida and P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Cloning, expression and mutational analysis of the urocanase gene (hutU) from Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - The histidine-utilizing hutU gene was isolated from a lambda-EMBL3 phage of a genomic library from Pseudomonas putida nicII and subcloned into the expression vector pT7-7. Escherichia coli BL21 cells were transformed with the recombinant plasmid and produced a catalytically active protein, amounting to approximately 30% of the total protein in the crude cell-free extract. The addition of NAD+ to the growth medium ensured the full occupation of active sites by the cofactor. This requires a mechanism for the transport of NAD+ into E. coli cells. Using the overproducing mutant a new, fast and efficient isolation procedure is described which yields electrophoretically homogeneous urocanase within two days. The yield of pure enzyme, based on the culture volume, has been improved 50-80-fold compared with the traditional method. To investigate the possible role of cysteine residues in the catalysis or in the tight binding of the cofactor NAD+, six different mutants were prepared. In each mutant protein, one conserved cysteine was exchanged for alanine. The resulting clones were tested for the expression of urocanase with catalytic activity; the Km and Vmax values were determined. Only Cys410 was essential for catalysis. There was no detectable reconstitution or increase of activity after the addition of NAD+, either in the essential Cys/Ala mutant or the other mutant proteins. Electrospray-mass spectroscopy of the wild-type enzyme revealed that the coenzyme is not covalently bound to the protein and computational analysis showed no typical sequence for a mononucleotide-binding domain like the Rossman fold. To obtain urocanase apoenzyme, P. putida nicII was transformed with pGP1-2 and pTET7-U and grown in nicotinate-depleted medium. Like the mutant proteins, no activation of the apoform occurred after the addition of NAD+. These observations led us to postulate a new model for the non-covalent but tight binding of NAD+ to the enzyme by 'trapping' the cofactor while folding the nascent protein.
TI  - Application of a tetrazolium salt with a water-soluble formazan as an indicator of viability in respiring bacteria.
AB  - The tetrazolium salt sodium 3'-{1-[(phenylamino)-carbonyl]-3,4-tetrazolium}-bis (4-methoxy-6-nitro)benzene-sulfonic acid hydrate (XTT) was examined for use as a colorimetric indicator of viability in respiring bacteria. XTT was reduced to an orange, water-soluble formazan product by Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b, Pseudomonas putida, Escherichia coli, and Bacillus subtilis. Formazan production was proportional to live cell biomass, and XTT was reduced by all cultures in the absence of added electron-coupling agents. XTT reduction by M. trichosporium OB3b was linear over several hours and was stimulated by the presence of an exogenous substrate (methanol). Addition of cyanide to cultures incubated under oxic conditions gave an initial 10-fold increase in XTT reduction. Viability of bacteria incubated in the absence of exogenous carbon substrates was measured as XTT reduction and compared with viability estimates from plate counts. Results obtained with the two methods were generally comparable, but the XTT assay was superior when cell recovery on plates was low. Incubation of E. coli for 7 days in the absence of exogenous carbon substrates decreased viability by 90%, whereas the corresponding decreases for cultures of M. trichosporium OB3b, P. putida, and B. subtilis were less than 40%.
TI  - Regulation of the pcaIJ genes for aromatic acid degradation in Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - Six of the genes encoding enzymes of the beta-ketoadipate pathway for benzoate and 4-hydroxybenzoate degradation in Pseudomonas putida are organized into at least three separate transcriptional units. As an initial step to defining this pca regulon at the molecular level, lacZ fusions were made with the pcaI and pcaJ genes, which encode the two subunits of beta-ketoadipate:succinyl-coenzyme A transferase, the enzyme catalyzing the next-to-last step in the beta-ketoadipate pathway. Fusion analyses showed that pcaI and pcaJ constitute an operon which requires beta-ketoadipate or its nonmetabolizable analog, adipate, as well as the pcaR regulatory gene for induction. The pcaIJ promoter is likely to be a sigma 70-type promoter; it has a sigma 70-type consensus sequence and did not require the alternative sigma factor, RpoN, for induction. Deletion analysis of the promoter region of a pcaI-lacZ transcriptional fusion indicated that no specific DNA sequences upstream of the -35 region were required for full induction. This implies that the binding site for the activator protein, PcaR, is unusually close to the transcriptional start site of pcaIJ.
TI  - Stable Tagging of Rhizobium meliloti with the Firefly Luciferase Gene for Environmental Monitoring.
AB  - A system for stable tagging of gram-negative bacteria with the firefly luciferase gene, luc, is described. A previously constructed fusion constitutively expressing luc from the lambdap(R) promoter was used. Stable integration into the bacterial genome was achieved by use of mini-Tn5 delivery vectors. The procedure developed was applied for tagging of representative gram-negative bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, Rhizobium meliloti, Pseudomonas putida, and Agrobacterium tumefaciens. The system permitted the detection of tagged R. meliloti in the presence of more than 10 CFU per plate without the use of any selective markers (such as antibiotic resistance genes). No significant differences in growth rates or soil survival were found between the marked strain and the wild-type strain. Studies of bioluminescent R. meliloti also revealed a good correlation between cell biomass and bioluminescence. The firefly luciferase tagging system is an easy, safe, and sensitive method for the detection and enumeration of bacteria in the environment.
TI  - Gene components responsible for discrete substrate specificity in the metabolism  of biphenyl (bph operon) and toluene (tod operon).
AB  - bph operons coding for biphenyl-polychlorinated biphenyl degradation in Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes KF707 and Pseudomonas putida KF715 and tod operons coding for toluene-benzene metabolism in P. putida F1 are very similar in gene organization as well as size and homology of the corresponding enzymes (G. J. Zylstra and D. T. Gibson, J. Biol. Chem. 264:14940-14946, 1989; K. Taira, J. Hirose, S. Hayashida, and K. Furukawa, J. Biol. Chem. 267:4844-4853, 1992), despite their discrete substrate ranges for metabolism. The gene components responsible for substrate specificity between the bph and tod operons were investigated. The large subunit of the terminal dioxygenase (encoded by bphA1 and todC1) and the ring meta-cleavage compound hydrolase (bphD and todF) were critical for their discrete metabolic specificities, as shown by the following results. (i) Introduction of todC1C2 (coding for the large and small subunits of the terminal dioxygenase in toluene metabolism) or even only todC1 into biphenyl-utilizing P. pseudoalcaligenes KF707 and P. putida KF715 allowed them to grow on toluene-benzene by coupling with the lower benzoate meta-cleavage pathway. Introduction of the bphD gene (coding for 2-hydroxy-6-oxo-6-phenylhexa-2,4-dienoate hydrolase) into toluene-utilizing P. putida F1 permitted growth on biphenyl. (ii) With various bph and tod mutant strains, it was shown that enzyme components of ferredoxin (encoded by bphA3 and todB), ferredoxin reductase (bphA4 and todA), and dihydrodiol dehydrogenase (bphB and todD) were complementary with one another. (iii) Escherichia coli cells carrying a hybrid gene cluster of todClbphA2A3A4BC (constructed by replacing bphA1 with todC1) converted toluene to a ring meta-cleavage 2-hydroxy-6-oxo-hepta-2,4-dienoic acid, indicating that TodC1 formed a functional multicomponent dioxygenase associated with BphA2 (a small subunit of the terminal dioxygenase in biphenyl metabolism), BphA3, and BphA4.
TI  - In vivo reactivation of catechol 2,3-dioxygenase mediated by a chloroplast-type ferredoxin: a bacterial strategy to expand the substrate specificity of aromatic degradative pathways.
AB  - The meta-cleavage operon of the TOL plasmid pWW0 of Pseudomonas putida contains 13 genes responsible for the oxidation of benzoate and toluates to Krebs cycle intermediates via estradiol (meta) cleavage of (methyl)catechol. The functions of all the genes are known with the exception of xylT. We constructed pWW0 mutants defective in the xylT gene, and found that these mutants were not able to grow on p-toluate while they were still capable of growing on benzoate and m-toluate. In the xylT mutants, all the meta-cleavage enzymes were induced by p-toluate with the exception of catechol 2,3-dioxygenase whose activity was 1% of the p-toluate-induced activity in wild-type cells. Addition of 4-methylcatechol to m-toluate-grown wild-type and xylT cells resulted in the inactivation of catechol 2,3-dioxygenase in these cells. In the wild-type strain but not in the xylT mutant, the catechol 2,3-dioxygenase activity was regenerated in a short time. The regeneration of the catechol 2,3-dioxygenase activity was also observed in H2O2-treated wild-type cells, but not in H2O2-treated xylT cells. We concluded that the xylT product is required for the regeneration of catechol 2,3-dioxygenase.
TI  - In vitro and in situ survivals of bacterial populations added to fresh water environments.
AB  - The fate of Aeromonas hydrophila, Alcaligenes denitrificans, Vibrio cholerae non-01, Pseudomonas putida and four different isolates of Escherichia coli in fresh river water were assessed by using different microcosms (i.e., membrane diffusion chamber and Erlenmeyer flask). When water samples were incubated at 16 +/- 1 degrees C, the differences in extent of survival among test bacteria were in general not significant. If the incubation temperature was raised to 29 +/- 1 degrees C, in the in situ studies, none of the added bacterial population could be detected by Day 3. In the in vitro studies, two of the four E. coli tested remained detectable by Day 3. Similarly, populations of the introduced A. hydrophila, P. putida and A. denitrificans were still detectable by Day 5. In general, all test bacteria survived better under low incubation temperature, regardless of whether the experiments were carried out under in vitro or in situ conditions. The results clearly indicated that when studying the fate of the introduced bacteria in the aquatic environment, in situ study was definitely required, especially in the summer time.
TI  - Unique genetic arrangement in the dnaA region of the Borrelia burgdorferi linear  chromosome: nucleotide sequence of the dnaA gene.
AB  - The complete nucleotide sequence of the Borrelia burgdorferi dnaA gene (encoding  the initiator protein of chromosome replication) and its flanking regions was determined. The putative DnaA polypeptide exhibited 29-42% identity with those of other eubacteria. The gene order in the dnaA region at the centre of the B. burgdorferi linear chromosome is rnpA-rpmH-dnaN-dnaA-gyrB-gyrA in contrast to the consensus eubacterial order of rnpA-rpmH-dnaA-dnaN-recF-gyrB, suggesting a rearrangement during the evolution of the Borrelia chromosome. We did not detect the multiple 9-nucleotide repeats known as DnaA boxes, which characterise origin of replications, in the dnaA-gyrB and dnaA-dnaN intergenic regions. In addition B. burgdorferi DnaA protein differs considerably from those of other eubacteria in a normally highly conserved region at the C-terminus of the polypeptide which may be involved in DNA binding.
TI  - Gene expression in Pseudomonas.
AB  - Gene regulation studies in pseudomonad bacteria are mainly restricted to Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas putida. Constitutive promoters exhibit DNA sequences similar to the sigma (70)-dependent constitutive promoters of Escherichia coli. The TOL meta-cleavage pathway operon promoter and the nah operon promoters are the best characterized sigma (70)-dependent promoters, which exhibit-10 regions rich in As and Ts and non-conserved-35 regions. The DNA binding motif recognized by the respective positive regulators lies between-40 and-80. Another set of positively controlled promoters exhibit upstream activator sequences located between-100 and-500. Transcription stimulation from some of these promoters also involves sigma (54) and/or IHF protein. In this class of promoters, DNA binding is required to establish open complexes. Promoters for the utilization of histidine (hut) are under negative control by the HutC protein. hut promoters exhibit-10/-35 consensus regions and an overlapping operator sequence between-15 and-50. Repression of hut promoters seems to be achieved through steric hindrance of RNA polymerase. Another set of promoters are controlled by catabolite repression, which seems to be cyclic-AMP independent.
TI  - Membrane topologies of the TolQ and TolR proteins of Escherichia coli: inactivation of TolQ by a missense mutation in the proposed first transmembrane segment.
AB  - The TolQ and TolR proteins of Escherichia coli are required for the uptake of group A colicins and for infection by filamentous phages. Their topology in the cytoplasmic membrane was determined by cleavage with aminopeptidase K, proteinase K, and trypsin in spheroplasts and cell lysates. From the results obtained, it is proposed that the N terminus of TolQ is located in the periplasm and that it contains three transmembrane segments (residues 9 to 36, 127 to 159, and 162 to 191), a small periplasmic loop, and two large portions in the cytoplasm. The N terminus of TolR is located in the cytoplasm and is followed by a transmembrane segment (residues 21 to 40), and the remainder of the protein is located in the periplasm. A tolQ mutant, which rendered cells resistant to group A colicins and sensitive to cholate, had alanine 13 replaced by glycine and was lacking serine 14 in the first transmembrane segment. The membrane topologies of TolQ and TolR are similar to those proposed for ExbB and ExbD, respectively, which is consistent with the partial functional substitution between ExbB and TolQ and between ExbD and TolR. The amino acid sequences of these proteins display the highest homology in the transmembrane segments, which indicates that the membrane-spanning regions play an important role in the activities of the proteins.
TI  - The bkdR gene of Pseudomonas putida is required for expression of the bkd operon  and encodes a protein related to Lrp of Escherichia coli.
AB  - Branched-chain keto acid dehydrogenase is a multienzyme complex which is required for the metabolism of the branched-chain amino acids in Pseudomonas putida. The structural genes encoding all four proteins of the bkd operon have been cloned, and their nucleotide sequences have been determined (G. Burns, K. T. Madhusudhan, K. Hatter, and J. R. Sokatch, p. 177-184 in S. Silver, A. M. Chakrabarty, B. Iglewski, and S. Kaplan [ed.], Pseudomonas: Biotransformations, Pathogenesis, and Evolving Biotechnology, American Society for Microbiology, Washington D.C., 1990). An open reading frame which encoded a protein with 36.5% amino acid identity to the leucine-responsive regulatory protein (Lrp) of Escherichia coli was found immediately upstream of the bkd operon. Chromosomal mutations affecting this gene, named bkdR, resulted in a loss of ability to use branched-chain amino acids as carbon and energy sources and failure to produce branched-chain keto acid dehydrogenase. These mutations were complemented in trans by plasmids which contained intact bkdR. Mutations affecting bkdR did not have any effect on transport of branched-chain amino acids or transamination. Therefore, the bkdR gene product must affect expression of the bkd operon and regulation must be positive. Mutations affecting bkdR could also be complemented by plasmids containing lrp of E. coli. This is the first instance of a Lrp-like protein demonstrated to regulate expression of an operon outside of E. coli.
TI  - Intrinsic stability and extrinsic stabilization of creatinase from Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - Creatinase (creatine amidinohydrolase, EC 3.5.3.3), a homodimer of 45 kDa subunit molecular mass, shows only limited functional stability, and is inaccessible to reconstitution after preceding deactivation, denaturation and dissociation. The enzyme has been characterized regarding its native and denatured states. Studying its unfolding characteristics in the presence of "extrinsic factors", such as DTE, BSA and glycerol, it was possible to define solvent conditions where the stability of the enzyme is significantly improved. Apart from protecting essential thiol groups and charge screening effects, the stabilization is caused mainly by preferential solvation. In the presence of 20% (w/v) glycerol, the kinetic analysis of the time course of denaturation indicates that a partially active folding intermediate, rather than the whole molecule, is involved in the stabilization. The mixed solvent improves the thermal stability, as well as the stability toward GdmCl and urea.
TI  - Analysis of the DNA damage-mediated induction of Pseudomonas putida and Pseudomonas aeruginosa lexA genes.
AB  - A fusion between the lexA gene of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas putida and the lacZ gene was constructed in vitro and cloned in a mini-Tn5 transposon derivative to obtain chromosomal insertions which enable to quantitatively examine their transcriptional regulation in both Pseudomonas and E. coli. Analysis of DNA damage-mediated induction of these lexA-lacZ fusions showed that expression of P. putida and P. aeruginosa lexA genes was always higher and earlier than the expression of the lexA gene of E. coli. Furthermore, and in contrast to the lexA gene fusion of E. coli, the rates and extent of the induction of lexA gene fusion of P. putida and P. aeruginosa were largely independent of the UV doses applied. The behaviour of the lexA-lacZ fusions of two Pseudomonas species was the same regardless of whether they were inserted into their own chromosome or into E. coli.
TI  - Human glyoxalase I. cDNA cloning, expression, and sequence similarity to glyoxalase I from Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - Glyoxalase I (EC 4.4.1.5) catalyzes the transformation of methylglyoxal and glutathione to S-lactoylglutathione. We have isolated human cDNA clones encoding glyoxalase I from a phorbol myristate acetate-treated U937 cDNA library. This cDNA encodes a protein of 184 amino acids with a calculated M(r) of 20,719. The amino acid composition calculated from the deduced amino acid sequence agreed with that reported for glyoxalase I purified from human erythrocytes. The Escherichia coli cells carrying the expression vector of this cDNA acquired methylglyoxal resistance and the cell lysate showed the high activity of glyoxalase I. The amino acid sequence of human glyoxalase I exhibited 57% identity with Pseudomonas putida glyoxalase I at the C-terminal two-thirds, suggesting that the two enzymes may have originated from a common ancestor.
TI  - In-vivo-generated fusion promoters in Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - Plasmid pEST1463 carrying the promoterless pheBA operon was cloned into Pseudomonas putida PaW85, and phenol-utilizing colonies were isolated on minimal plates containing phenol as the only carbon and energy source. In these clones, chromosomally located Tn4652 was transposed upstream from the coding sequencing of pheA (encoding phenol monooxygenase). Sequence analysis together with mapping of the transcription start point of the pheBA operon in the recombinant plasmids revealed that fusions of the -10 sequences present in the pheBA operon and -35 sequence located in the terminal inverted repeats of Tn4652 had generated functional promoters under selective pressure in P. putida cells. These promoter sequences show similarity to the Escherichia coli RNA polymerase sigma 70 promoter consensus sequence. In three of the six fusion promoters studied, the generation combined two distinct events: transposition of Tn4652 into DNA containing potential -10 sequences and point mutations in these sequences. These mutations made the -10 sequences more like the sigma 70 promoter consensus sequences.
TI  - Identification and characterization of the pupB gene encoding an inducible ferric-pseudobactin receptor of Pseudomonas putida WCS358.
AB  - Pseudomonas putida WCS358 can transport iron complexed to a wide variety of pseudobactins produced by other Pseudomonas strains. The pupB gene encoding an outer membrane ferric-pseudobactin receptor was isolated from a genomic library of P. putida WCS358. The PupB receptor facilitated iron transport via two distinct heterologous siderophores, i.e. pseudobactin BN8 and pseudobactin BN7. The amino acid sequence deduced from the nucleotide sequence consisted of 804 amino acids (molecular weight 88,369) of which the N-terminal part was very similar to a prokaryotic leader peptide. The mature protein shared significant homology with the receptor for ferric-pseudobactin 358 (PupA) and contained three regions common to TonB-dependent receptor proteins of Escherichia coli. Interestingly, PupB expression was only observed in cells cultured in iron-deficient medium containing pseudobactin BN8 or pseudobactin BN7. This expression required a transcriptional unit, pupR, identified upstream of the structural pupB gene. Transposon Tn5 insertion mutants defective in PupB production still exhibited uptake of iron via pseudobactin BN8, although with reduced efficiency. Apparently, an additional transport system for this ferric-siderophore complex operates in this strain. In addition to pseudobactin BN8 also other heterologous siderophores were capable of inducing synthesis of specific high-molecular-weight outer membrane proteins in strain WCS358, which suggests the existence of multiple siderophore-inducible iron transport systems in this strain.
TI  - Expression of the aggA locus of Pseudomonas putida in vitro and in planta as detected by the reporter gene, xylE.
AB  - In vitro agglutinability by Pseudomonas putida, isolate Corvallis, with a plant root surface agglutinin is correlated with rapid adhesion of cells of the fluorescent pseudomonad to bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) root surfaces. Agglutinability in P. putida cells is regulated by nutrient status as well as growth phase. Cells grown in three different nutrient complex media are agglutinable at early and mid-late logarithmic phase but become nonagglutinable at stationary phase. Cells grown in a minimal medium are weakly agglutinable, but the addition of lysine, aspartic acid, or histidine increases agglutinability. Cells in the same minimal medium supplemented with bean root surface components grow in a highly agglutinated state. Previous data indicate both agglutination and rapid adhesion to roots by P. putida Corvallis involves the aggA locus, which contains two putative open reading frames (ORF), ORF-AGG1 and ORFAGG2, on complementary strands. Sequence and deletion analyses suggest ORFAGG1 is the most probable ORF responsible for agglutination and adhesion. Chimeric fusion of an Escherichia coli lac promoter with ORFAGG1, but not with ORFAGG2, complemented agglutinability of an aggA::Tn5 P. putida Agg mutant, providing further evidence that ORFAGG1, not ORFAGG2, is responsible for agglutination. Heterologous expression of ORFAGG1 yields a 50-kDa precursor and a 48-kDa mature periplasmic protein. Fusions of ORFAGG1 and ORFAGG2 to the reporter gene, xylE, and detection of the reporter enzyme, catechol-2,3-oxygenase reveal an active promoter in the 5' noncoding region of ORFAGG1. The ORFAGG1 promoter is active during growth of the cells in liquid culture and is regulated by growth medium. Greatest activity of the catechol-2,3-oxygenase is observed in stationary phase when the cells are nonagglutinable. Expression of the ORFAGG1 promoter is detected in P. putida cells extracted from the root surface of bean at 48 and 72 hr after inoculation.
TI  - Broad host range, regulated expression system utilizing bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase and promoter.
AB  - An IPTF-regulated broad host range expression system was constructed using compatible broad host range plasmids, the T7 RNA polymerase, and T7 promoter sequences. The system is implemented by the coexistence of two plasmids. The first contains the T7 RNA polymerase gene under the control of lacl or lacl(q) genes and lacUV5 promoter. The second encodes the T7 promoter upstream of a multicloning site. IncP1 or IncP4 T7 promoter plasmids, and IncP1, IncP4 or IncW T7 RNA polymerase plasmids were constructed. The expression from the IncP1 promoter plasmids in the presence of the IncP4 polymerase plasmids was tested by in vivo lacZ fusions and vivo labeling of proteins. In this combination, the use of lac(q) improves the regulation levels in Escherichia coli, whereas, in Pseudomonas phaseolicola, a 28.5-fold regulation was obtained with lacl, Although the level of lacZ expression from the T7 promoter in P. phaseolicola is low compared with E. coli, it is similar to levels obtained with the pm promoter in Pseudomonas putida when the differences in the copy number of the expression vectors are taken into consideration.
TI  - Mapping of the ben, ant and cat genes of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and evolutionary  relationship of the ben region of P. aeruginosa and P. putida.
AB  - Genes responsible for the utilization of benzoate, anthranilate or catechol (ben, ant, cat) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO were mapped precisely using a cosmid clone carrying all these genes. Genes were localized either by subcloning and complementation or by Tn5 mutagenesis and mapping of the Tn5 insertions. To achieve this, a novel Tn5 mutagenesis procedure was developed by constructing a Tn5 insertion derivative of the Escherichia coli strain S17-1. Preliminary mapping of the ben cat genes of P. putida PPN was accomplished by complementation using a PPN cosmid bank. Sequence homology was demonstrated by Southern hybridization between the ben regions of both P. aeruginosa and P. putida, implying an evolutionary relationship of this chromosomal region of these two pseudomonads.
TI  - Superoxide dismutase activity in root-colonizing pseudomonads.
AB  - Several saprophytic fluorescent pseudomonads that are aggressive root colonizers  express similar specific activities of superoxide dismutase during growth in liquid culture. The pseudomonads have the potential to produce hydrogen peroxide sensitive and hydrogen peroxide insensitive isoforms of superoxide dismutase with distinct mobilities in nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Synthesis of the hydrogen peroxide insensitive form is enhanced by limited iron availability, by exposure to Mn2+, and to a lesser extent by external sources of superoxide anion. Unlike Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a root-colonizing strain of Pseudomonas putida did not show regulation of isoform pattern by phosphate availability. A plasmid potentially encoding the pseudomonad hydrogen peroxide sensitive form complemented the superoxide dismutase deficiency in a mutant of Escherichia coli lacking expression of both Fe and Mn genes. Contact between the plant root and pseudomonad or E. coli cells that lack or express superoxide dismutase did not influence superoxide anion production from root surface enzymes. The pseudomonad and the superoxide dismutase deficient and producing E. coli strains survived exposure to the root equally well. Only the hydrogen peroxide sensitive isoform of superoxide dismutase was detected in P. putida cells associated with bean root surfaces.
TI  - Molecular analysis of the plasmid-borne bed gene cluster from Pseudomonas putida  ML2 and cloning of the cis-benzene dihydrodiol dehydrogenase gene.
AB  - Pseudomonas putida ML2 contains a large catabolic plasmid, pHMT112, carrying genes that encode the dioxygenase and dehydrogenase involved in the catabolism of benzene via the ortho or beta-ketoadipate pathway. pHMT112 was derived from a larger and less stable plasmid in P. putida ML2 following growth on succinate as carbon and energy source but was, however, stably maintained in P. putida even in the absence of selection for growth on benzene. Cleavage sites for the restriction endonucleases DraI, XbaI, and BamHI were mapped on the plasmid. A region of the plasmid, downstream of the benzene dioxygenase genes (bedC1C2BA), was found to encode the cis-benzene dihydrodiol dehydrogenase gene (bedD). Recombinant Escherichia coli containing bedC1C2BAD genes was found to express benzene dioxygenase and dehydrogenase activity, indicated by the production of catechol when incubated in the presence of benzene. Hybridization using benzene dioxygenase genes as probes was used to construct a restriction map of the 35.5-kb XhoI-DraI fragment on which the bed operon was located.
TI  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa promoters which contain a conserved GG-N10-GC motif but appear to be RpoN-independent.
AB  - The proC gene of Pseudomonas aeruginosa encodes the constitutive delta 1-pyrroline 5-carboxylate reductase (the third enzyme of proline biosynthesis) and ranks among the numerous Pseudomonas genes which are poorly transcribed in Escherichia coli. The promoters of the proC gene were located by deletion mapping. The 5' ends of the proC transcripts originating from one promoter were determined by primer extension. This promoter has a GG-N10-GC motif with a 16 bp spacing between the GC doublet and the transcription start site. Such spacing is unusually long for sigma 54-dependent promoters. In rpoN mutants of P. aeruginosa and P. putida a proC'--'lacZ fusion was expressed at wild-type levels, suggesting that sigma 54 RNA polymerase is not involved in proC transcription. The expression of another P. aeruginosa gene, anr (for anaerobic regulation of nitrate respiration and anaerobic arginine degradation), also appeared to be independent of RpoN in Pseudomonas and occurred at a very low level in E. coli. The proC and anr promoters have sequence similarities in addition to the conserved GG--N10--GC motif and may also be related to some alg (alginate) promoters of P. aeruginosa. We propose that the proC and anr promoters are activated by proteins, including perhaps an alternative sigma factor, which are present in Pseudomonas but absent from E. coli.
TI  - Preelectrophoresis of agarose plugs containing bacterial chromosomal DNA prepared for analysis by pulsed field gel electrophoresis can improve the clarity of restriction patterns.
AB  - Pulsed field gel electrophoresis has indicated that chromosomal DNA isolated from stationary phase Pseudomonas fluorescens, Pseudomonas putida, and Escherichia coli cells immobilized in agarose can be fragmented during its release. For P. fluorescens it was demonstrated that the entire chromosome is affected and that there are no specifically fragile sites. The extent of the damage increased both during storage of the DNA and also when magnesium ions were provided, suggesting that nucleases may be involved. Chromosomal DNA isolated from exponentially growing cultures was subjected to significantly less damage during release and storage. Removal of damaged DNA by electrophoresis prior to digestion was shown to result in clearer restriction patterns of chromosomal DNA.
TI  - Precise deletions in large bacterial genomes by vector-mediated excision (VEX). The trfA gene of promiscuous plasmid RK2 is essential for replication in several gram-negative hosts.
AB  - We have developed a simple and efficient method of vector-mediated excision (VEX) for in vivo generation of precisely defined deletions in large bacterial genomes. The system uses homologous recombination with small cloned fragments on specialized pVEX plasmids to insert directly repeated bacteriophage P1 loxP sites at positions flanking the region to be deleted. In the presence of Cre recombinase, the loxP sites are efficiently recombined to produce the deletion. Deletion endpoints can be directed to specific nucleotides because they are defined by the termini of small homology-bearing fragments cloned into the pVEX plasmids. We have used VEX to delete trfA, the only known replication initiator gene of the 56.4 kb broad host-range plasmid RK2. The RK2 delta trfA mutant was found to be conjugation proficient, but unable to replicate in the RK2 hosts Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Caulobacter crescentus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas putida, Rhizobium meliloti, or Rhodobacter sphaeroides. These results show that trfA is essential for replication in these hosts and indicate that the broad host-range of RK2 does not involve multiple replicons.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence and over-expression of morphine dehydrogenase, a plasmid-encoded gene from Pseudomonas putida M10.
AB  - Pseudomonas putida M10 was originally isolated from factory waste liquors by selection for growth on morphine. The NADP(+)-dependent morphine dehydrogenase that initiates morphine catabolism is encoded by a large plasmid of 165 kb. Treatment of P. putida M10 with ethidium bromide led to the isolation of a putative plasmid-free strain that was incapable of growth on morphine. The structural gene for morphine dehydrogenase, morA, has been located on the plasmid by oligonucleotide hybridization, by coupled transcription-translation of cloned restriction fragments and by nucleotide sequence analysis and is contained within a 1.7 kb SphI fragment that has been cloned into Escherichia coli. The cloned dehydrogenase enzyme is expressed at high levels in E. coli resulting in a 65-fold increase in morphine dehydrogenase activity in cell-free extracts compared with P. putida M10. Morphine dehydrogenase was rapidly purified to homogeneity, as judged by SDS/PAGE, by a one-step affinity chromatography procedure on Mimetic Orange 3 A6XL. The properties of the purified enzyme were identical with those previously reported for P. putida M10 morphine dehydrogenase. The morA gene was sequenced and the deduced amino acid sequence confirmed by N-terminal amino acid sequencing of the over-expressed protein. The predicted amino acid sequence of morA, deduced from the nucleotide sequence, indicated that morphine dehydrogenase did not belong to the non-metal-requiring short-chain class of dehydrogenases, but was more closely related to the aldo-ketoreductases.
TI  - Construction of metabolic operons catalyzing the de novo biosynthesis of indigo in Escherichia coli.
AB  - The efficient production of the textile dye indigo by fermentation has been a goal since the early 1980's when the first bacterial strains capable of this synthesis were constructed. We report here the development of a recombinant microorganism that directly synthesizes indigo from glucose. This construction involved the cloning and genetic manipulation of at least 9 genes and modifications of the fermentation medium to help stabilize the biosynthetic activity. Directed genetic changes in two operons caused significant increases in reaction rates and in the stability of the catalytic enzymes. This example of whole cell catalysis by a recombinant Escherichia coli represents a novel and environmentally sound approach to the synthesis of a high value specialty chemical.
TI  - Proteins induced by sulfate limitation in Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas putida, or Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of proteins from Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas putida, and Staphylococcus aureus, grown with methionine or one of a variety of organosulfates and organosulfonates as the sole source of sulfur, showed expression of specific sets of 7 to 14 proteins which were not observed during growth with sulfate or cysteine for all three species or with thiocyanate for P. putida and S. aureus. Under the same conditions, arylsulfatase activity in P. putida and S. aureus was seen to increase by up to 140-fold, suggesting that the proteins induced under these conditions may be involved in sulfur metabolism. We propose that these proteins are members of a sulfate starvation-induced stimulon.
TI  - Increased expression of the plasmid-determined 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl dioxygenase  gene in strains of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas putida and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - A 6.5-kb EcoRI fragment containing the gene encoding 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl dioxygenase from the plasmid pBS312 was cloned into broad host range plasmid RSF1010 and expressed in Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas putida and Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains. The increased expression of the gene was orientation-dependent and probably due to the transcription read through from the streptomycin promoter of the vector. Subcloning experiments of the PstI fragments of pBS312 plasmid using vector pBR322 revealed that the bphC gene encoding 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl dioxygenase is localized on the 2.1-kb fragment. In Escherichia coli JM109, transformed by the plasmid pBS314 carrying the 2.1-kb insert in orientation which allowed expression of the bphC gene from the ampicillin promoter of pBR322, the enzyme activity of 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl dioxygenase was ten times higher than that in parental strain Pseudomonas putida SU83. The results presented show the first case of the increased expression of Pseudomonas degradative gene in Escherichia coli.
TI  - Analysis of Pseudomonas gene products using lacIq/Ptrp-lac plasmids and transposons that confer conditional phenotypes.
AB  - Novel transposon and plasmid-based broad-host-range expression systems have been  developed to facilitate the genetic analysis of gene products of Pseudomonas and related Gram- bacteria. The properties of lacIq/Ptrp-lac were used to construct mini-Tn5 expression vector transposons and RSF1010-derived plasmids for controlled expression and generation of conditional phenotypes. These plasmids were used to hyper-express the XylS regulator of the meta operon of the TOL plasmid of P. putida or the bphB and bphC genes of the polychlorobiphenyl-degrading pathway of Pseudomonas sp. LB400 in different strains of Pseudomonas instead of in Escherichia coli. Specific activity of 2.3 dihydroxybiphenyl dioxygenase (bphC gene product) was increased tenfold when hyperproduced in its native host as compared to E. coli, but under the same in vivo conditions, the XylS regulator formed protein aggregates. The other lacIq/Ptrp-lac-based expression vector presented here, transposon mini-Tn5 lacIq/Ptrc, facilitates the insertion of genetic cassettes containing heterologous genes under the control of lac inducers in the chromosome of target bacteria, as shown by monitoring expression of a lacZ reporter cloned in mini-Tn5 lacIq/Ptrc and inserted in the chromosome of P. putida.
TI  - Stereospecific Hydroxylation of Indan by Escherichia coli Containing the Cloned Toluene Dioxygenase Genes from Pseudomonas putida F1.
AB  - [This corrects the article on p. 3407 in vol. 58.].
TI  - Identification and characterization of the exbB, exbD and tonB genes of Pseudomonas putida WCS358: their involvement in ferric-pseudobactin transport.
AB  - Catechol-cephalosporins are siderophore-like antibiotics which are taken up by cells of Pseudomonas putida WCS358 via the ferric-siderophore transport pathway. Mutants of strain WCS358 were isolated that are resistant to high concentrations of these antibiotics. These mutants failed to grow under iron-limiting conditions, and could not utilize different ferric-siderophores. The mutants fall in three complementation groups. The nucleotide sequence determination identified three contiguous open reading frames, which were homologous to the exbB, exbD and tonB genes of Escherichia coli respectively. The deduced amino acid sequence of P. putida ExbB showed 58.6% homology with its E. coli homologue, but, unlike the E. coli protein, it has a N-terminal extension of 91 amino acids. The ExbD proteins are 64.8% homologous, whereas the TonB proteins only show 27.7% homology. The P. putida exbB gene could complement an E. coli exbB mutation, but the TonB proteins were not interchangeable between the species. It is concluded that P. putida WCS358 contains an energy-coupling system between the membranes, for active transport across the outer membrane, which is comprised of a TonB-like energy-transducing protein and two accessory proteins. This system is similar to, but not completely compatible with, the E. coli system.
TI  - Engineering enzymes for clinical diagnosis.
AB  - The enzyme creatine amidinohydrolase (creatinase, EC 3.5.3.3.) is a major limiting factor in the enzymatic creatinine determination because of its comparatively poor catalytic activity and stability in the native form. The gene from Pseudomonas putida coding for creatinase was cloned and used for overexpression of the protein in E coli and Pseudomonas. In addition, it was possible by means of 'random' mutagenesis in vivo and subsequent screening using an activity plate assay to isolate creatinase derivatives that are more stable towards detergents and elevated temperature under test kit conditions. This example shows that enzymes can be optimized for use in given assay conditions by mutagenesis of cloned DNA and suitable screening methods.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence analysis and comparison of the lexA genes from Salmonella typhimurium, Erwinia carotovora, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - The complete nucleotide sequences of the lexA genes from Salmonella typhimurium,  Erwinia carotovora, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas putida were determined; the DNA sequences of the lexA genes from these bacteria were 86%, 76%, 61% and 59% similar, respectively, to the Escherichia coli K12 gene. The predicted amino acid sequences of the S. typhimurium, E. carotovora and P. putida LexA proteins are 202 residues long whereas that of P. aeruginosa is 204. Two putative LexA repressor binding sites were localized upstream of each of the heterologous genes, the distance between them being 5 bp in S. typhimurium and E. carotovora, as in the lexA gene of E. coli, and 3 bp in P. putida and P. aeruginosa. The first lexA site present in the lexA operator of all five bacteria is very well conserved. However, the second lexA box is considerably more variable. The Ala-84--Gly-85 bond, at which the LexA repressor of E. coli is cleaved during the induction of the SOS response, is also found in the LexA proteins of S. typhimurium and E. carotovora. Likewise, the amino acids Ser-119 and Lys-156 are present in all of these three LexA repressors. These residues also exist in the LexA proteins of P. putida and P. aeruginosa, but they are displaced by 4 and 6 residues, respectively. Furthermore, the structure and sequence of the DNA-binding domain of the LexA repressor of E. coli are highly conserved in the S. typhimurium, E. carotovora, P. aeruginosa and P. putida LexA proteins.
TI  - [Cloning the trpBA-genes from Pseudomonas mendocina and Pseudomonas marginata].
AB  - The trpBA genes of Pseudomonas mendocina and P. marginata were cloned in Escherichia coli using pBR322 as a vector. Transcription of the cloned genes took place from their own promoters, in the following order: trpB-->trpA. The latter genes were not linked to the trpF gene and could not be induced by indole glycerol phosphate. Thus, the trpBA cluster of P. mendocina and P. marginata are distinguished from that of P. putida, P. aeruginosa (trpIBA) and P. acidovorans (trpFBA).
TI  - XylS domain interactions can be deduced from intraallelic dominance in double mutants of Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - The XylS protein is the positive regulator of the TOL plasmid-encoded meta-cleavage pathway for the metabolism of alkylbenzoates in Pseudomonas putida. This protein is activated by a variety of benzoate analogues. To elucidate the functional domains of the regulator and their interactions, several fusions of the XylS C-terminus to MS2 polymerase and of the N-terminus to beta-galactosidase were constructed but all are inactive. In addition, 15 double mutant xylS genes were constructed in vitro by fusing parts of various mutant genes to produce mutant regulators exhibiting C-terminal and N-terminal amino acid substitutions. The phenotypic properties of the parental single mutant genes, and those of the double mutant genes, suggest that the C-terminal region is involved in binding to DNA sequences at the promoter of the meta-cleavage pathway operon, and that the benzoate effector binding pocket includes critical residues present at both the N-terminal and C-terminal ends of the protein. The intraallelic dominance of the Ile229 (Ser229-->Ile) and Val274 (Asp274-->Val) substitutions over the N-terminal His41 (Arg41-->His) substitution, and the intraallelic dominance of Thr45 (Arg45-->Thr) over Ile229 and Val274, support the proposal that these two regions of the regulator interact functionally. Combination of the Leu88 (Trp88-->Leu) and Arg256 (Pro256-->Arg) substitutions did not suppress the semiconstitutive phenotype conferred by Leu88, but resulted in a protein with altered ability to recognize benzoates. In contrast, the Leu88 semiconstitutive phenotype was suppressed by Val288 (Asp288-->Val), and the double mutant was susceptible to activation by benzoates.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - DNA sequence determination and functional characterization of the OCT-plasmid-encoded alkJKL genes of Pseudomonas oleovorans.
AB  - The alkBFGHJKL and alkST operons encode enzymes that allow Pseudomonas putida (oleovorans) to metabolize alkanes. In this paper we report the nucleotide sequence of a 4592 bp region of the alkBFGHJKL operon encoding the AlkJ, AlkK and AlkL polypeptides. The alkJ gene encodes a protein of 59 kilodaltons. The predicted amino acid sequence shows significant homology with four flavin proteins: choline dehydrogenase, a glucose dehydrogenase and two oxidases. AlkJ is membrane-bound and converts aliphatic medium-chain-length alcohols into aldehydes. The properties of AlkJ suggest that it is linked to the electron transfer chain. AlkJ is necessary for growth on alkanes only in P. putida alcohol dehydrogenase (AlcA) mutants. AlkK is homologous to a range of proteins which act by an ATP-dependent covalent binding of AMP to their substrate. This list includes the acetate, coumarate and long-chain fatty acid CoA ligases. The alkK gene complements a fadD mutation in Escherichia coli, which shows that it indeed encodes an acyl-CoA synthetase. AlkK is a 60 kilodalton protein located in the cytoplasm. AlkL is homologous to OmpW, a Vibrio cholerae outer membrane protein of unknown function, and a hypothetical polypeptide encoded by ytt4 in E. coli. AlkL, OmpW and Ytt4 all have a signal peptide and end with a sequence characteristic of outer membrane proteins. The alkL gene product was found in the outer membrane of E. coli W3110 containing the alk-genes. The alkL gene can be deleted without a clear effect on growth rate. Its function remains unknown. The G+C content of the alkJKL genes is 45%, identical to that of the alkBFGH genes, and significantly lower than the G+C content of the OCT-plasmid and the P. putida chromosome.
TI  - Identification of a new gene, tmoF, in the Pseudomonas mendocina KR1 gene cluster encoding toluene-4-monooxygenase.
AB  - Five genes, tmoABCDE, encoding toluene-4-monooxygenase (T4MO) were previously mapped to a 3.6-kb region of a 10.2-kb SacI DNA fragment isolated from Pseudomonas mendocina KR1 (K.-M. Yen, M. R. Karl, L. M. Blatt, M. J. Simon, R. B. Winter, P. R. Fausset, H. S. Lu, A. A. Harcourt, and K. K. Chen, J. Bacteriol. 173:5315-5327, 1991). In this report, we describe the identification and characterization of a DNA region in the SacI fragment whose expression enhances the T4MO activity determined by the tmoABCDE gene cluster. This region was mapped immediately downstream of the putative transcription termination sequence previously located at the end of the tmoABCDE gene cluster (Yen et al., J. Bacteriol., 1991) and was found to stimulate T4MO activity two- to threefold when expressed in Escherichia coli or Pseudomonas putida. Determination of the nucleotide sequence of this region revealed an open reading frame (ORF) of 978 bp. Expression of the ORF resulted in the synthesis of an approximately 37-kDa polypeptide whose N-terminal amino acid sequence completely matched that of the product predicted from the ORF. The ORF thus defines a gene, which has now been designated tmoF. The TmoF protein shares amino acid sequence homology with the reductases of several mono- and dioxygenase systems. In addition, the reductase component of the naphthalene dioxygenase system, encoded by the nahAa gene of plasmid NAH7 from P. putida G7, could largely replace the TmoF protein in stimulating T4MO activity, and TmoF could partially replace the NahAa protein in forming active naphthalene dioxygenase. The overall properties of tmoF suggest that it is a member of the T4mo gene cluster and encodes the NADH:ferredoxin oxidoreductase of the T4MO system.
TI  - Purification and characterization of a DNA-dependent RNA polymerase from Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (EC 2.7.7.6) was purified from Pseudomonas putida. The enzyme had the typical composition of beta',beta,alpha, and sigma subunits of eubacterial RNA polymerases. The molecular masses of the subunits were 156,000 Da, 151,000 Da, 87,000 Da, and 42,000 Da, respectively, as measured by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. The NH2-terminal amino acid residues of the alpha subunit had a marked homology with those of the alpha subunit of Escherichia coli RNA polymerase. The enzyme activity was dependent on ribonucleoside triphosphates, Mg2+, and a DNA template, and was inhibited in vitro by rifampicin. The enzyme activity was maximal in the presence of 10 mM MgCl2. In an in vitro transcription assay using the tac promoter-controlled DNA as a template, the RNA polymerase of P. putida initiated transcription at the same site as that of E. coli.
TI  - [Cloning and expression of the Arthrobacter globiformis fcb genes in Bacillus subtilis].
AB  - The fcb genes of Arthrobacter globiformis KZT1 coding for the dehalogenase (4-chlorobenzoate-4-hydroxylase) activity have been cloned. The characteristics of fcb genes expression have been studied. The recombinant strains of Bacillus subtilis 6JM15 (pCBS 311) and 6JM15 (pCBS1) have shown the decreased level of substrate dehalogenation as compared with the one in the parent strain KZT1 and the recombinant strains of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida.
TI  - Isolation, sequencing and expression in E. coli of the urocanase gene from white  clover (Trifolium repens).
AB  - The urocanase gene was detected in a clone obtained from a genomic library of white clover. The entire gene has been sequenced and expressed in the pT7-7/E. coli BL 21 (DE 3) system. The deduced sequence of the plant urocanase is 72% homologous with that of the well-characterized urocanase from Pseudomonas putida. The purification procedure, as well as kinetic and electrophoretic behaviour, of the new enzyme are described.
TI  - 3-Carboxy-cis,cis-muconate lactonizing enzyme from Pseudomonas putida is homologous to the class II fumarase family: a new reaction in the evolution of a mechanistic motif.
AB  - The gene (pcaB) for 3-carboxymuconate lactonizing enzyme (CMLE; 3-carboxymuconate cycloisomerase; EC 5.5.1.2) from Pseudomonas putida has been cloned into pMG27NS, a temperature-sensitive expression vector, and expressed in Escherichia coli N4830. The specific activity and kinetic parameters of the recombinant CMLE were comparable to those previously reported. A comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of CMLE with sequences available in the PIR and Genbank databases revealed that CMLE has highly significant sequence homology to the class II fumarase family, particularly to adenylosuccinate lyase from Bacillus subtilis. CMLE has no significant homology to muconate lactonizing enzyme (MLE) from P. putida, its sister enzyme in the beta-ketoadipate pathway. These findings fully corroborate a prediction made by us on the basis of mechanistic and stereochemical analyses of CMLE and MLE [Chari, R. V. J., Whitman, C. P., Kozarich, J. W., Ngai, K.-L., & Ornston, L. N. (1987) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 109, 5514-5519] and suggest that CMLE and MLE were recruited into this specialized pathway from two different enzyme families.
TI  - Evidence that the hrpB gene encodes a positive regulator of pathogenicity genes from Pseudomonas solanacearum.
AB  - The hrp gene cluster of Pseudomonas solanacearum GMI1000 strain encodes functions that are essential for pathogenicity on tomato and for the elicitation of the hypersensitive response on tobacco. In this study, we present the nucleotide sequence of one of the hrp genes (hrpB) located at the left-hand end of the cluster and we show that hrpB encodes a positive regulator controlling the expression of hrp genes. hrpB has a coding capacity for a 477-amino-acid polypeptide, which shows significant similarity to several prokaryotic transcriptional activators including the AraC protein of Escherichia coli, the XylS protein of Pseudomonas putida and the VirF protein of Yersinia enterocolitica. The predicted hrpB gene product belongs to a family of bacterial regulators different from the previously described HrpS protein of the hrp gene cluster of Pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola. Genetic evidence demonstrates that the hrpB gene product acts as a positive regulator of the expression in minimal medium of all but one of the putative transcription units of the hrp gene cluster and also controls the expression of genes located outside this cluster. We also show in this paper that the transcription of hrpB is induced in minimal medium and is partly autoregulated.
TI  - Expression of the 4-chlorobenzoate dehalogenase genes from Pseudomonas sp.-CBS3 in Escherichia coli and identification of the gene translation products.
AB  - The genes encoding the 4-chlorobenzoate dehalogenase of Pseudomonas sp. strain CBS3 were, in an earlier study, cloned in Escherichia coli DH1 with the cosmid vector pPSA843 and then mobilized to the 4-chlorobenzoate dehalogenase minus strain Pseudomonas putida KT2440. In this paper we report on the expression of 4-chlorobenzoate dehalogenase in these clones and on the polypeptide composition of the active enzyme. The dehalogenase activity in whole cells suspended in 3.2 mM 4-chlorobenzoate (30 degrees C) was determined to be approximately 27 units (micromoles 4-hydroxybenzoate produced per minute) per 100 g of E. coli-pPSA843 cells and approximately 28 units per 100 g of P. putida-pPSA843 cells. Dehalogenase activity in fresh cellular extracts (pH 7.4, 30 degrees C) prepared from the E. coli and P. putida clones was unstable and at least 20-fold lower than that observed with the whole cells. The polypeptide components of the dehalogenase were identified by selective expression of the cloned dehalogenase genes and analysis of the gene translation products. Analysis of dehalogenase activity in omega insertion mutants and deletion mutants circumscribed the dehalogenase genes to a 4.8-kilobase (4.8 kb) stretch of the 9.5-kb DNA fragment. Selective expression of the dehalogenase genes from a cloned 4.8-kb DNA fragment in a maxicell system revealed a 30-kDa polypeptide as one of the components of the dehalogenase system. Selective expression of the dehalogenase genes using the T7 polymerase promoter system revealed the 30-kDa polypeptide and 57- and 16-kDa polypeptide products. Determination of which of the three polypeptides were translated in deletion mutants provided the relative positions of the encoding genes on a single DNA strand and the direction in which they are transcribed.
TI  - Cloning of a creatinase gene from Pseudomonas putida in Escherichia coli by using an indicator plate.
AB  - A genomic library of Pseudomonas putida DNA was constructed by using plasmid pBR322. Transformants of Escherichia coli in combination with Proteus mirabilis cells grown on creatinase test plates were screened for creatinase activity; transformants were considered positive for creatinase activity if a red-pink zone appeared around the colonies. One creatinase-positive clone was further analyzed, and the gene was reduced to a 2.7-kb DNA fragment. A unique protein band (with a molecular weight of approximately 50,000) was observed in recombinant E. coli by minicell analysis.
TI  - Stereospecific hydroxylation of indan by Escherichia coli containing the cloned toluene dioxygenase genes from Pseudomonas putida F1.
AB  - Escherichia coli JM109(pDTG601), containing the todC1C2BA genes encoding toluene  dioxygenase from Pseudomonas putida F1, oxidizes indan to (-)-(1R)-indanol (83% R) and trans-1,3-indandiol. Under similar conditions, P. putida F39/D oxidizes indan to (-)-(1R)-indanol (96% R), 1-indanone, and trans-1,3-indandiol. The differences in the enantiomeric composition of the 1-indanols formed by the two organisms are due to the presence of a 1-indanol dehydrogenase in P. putida F39/D that preferentially oxidizes (+)-(1S)-indanol.
TI  - In vitro interactions of Pseudomonas RNA polymerases with tac and RNA I promoters.
AB  - The activities of RNA polymerases from Pseudomonas putida and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were compared with that of Escherichia coli RNA polymerase in an in vitro transcription system. All three enzymes initiated transcription at the tac promoter and the RNA I promoter of E. coli. We measured the rate of open complex formation between the RNA polymerases and the promoters, and the saturation level of open complex formation at equilibrium in single-round transcription. The relative rates of open complex formation were P. putida > E. coli > P. aeruginosa and the relative saturation levels of open complex formation at equilibrium were E. coli > P. putida > P. aeruginosa for the tac and RNA I promoters. The interaction of the RNA polymerases with the promoters was also studied by DNase I footprinting. The patterns of protection of the Pseudomonas RNA polymerases on the tac promoter were similar to that of E. coli RNA polymerase. However, the protection patterns of the Pseudomonas RNA polymerases on the RNA I promoter were slightly different from that of E. coli RNA polymerase.
TI  - Bacterioplankton community structure and dynamics after large-scale release of nonindigenous bacteria as revealed by low-molecular-weight-RNA analysis.
AB  - A set of freshwater mesocosms (1.7 m3 each) was inoculated with large amounts of  Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas putida, and their culture medium to substantially disturb the natural microbial community. To monitor microbial community dynamics, low-molecular-weight RNA (5S rRNA and tRNA) obtained directly from bacterioplankton was analyzed by using high-resolution electrophoresis. The introduced bacteria showed no significant effect on the community structure of the natural bacterial assemblage and its dynamics for 16 days. In contrast, the addition of culture medium resulted within 2 days in a reduction of community diversity due to dominance of a single 5S rRNA band from an indigenous bacterium. Partial sequencing of several 5S rRNAs demonstrated the molecular homogeneity of most of the abundant bands and enabled the identification of corresponding bacterial isolates and/or species. The dominating bacterium (around 54% of the total 5S rRNA) in the nutrient-amended mesocosms could be identified by partial sequencing as a member of the Aeromonas hydrophila complex. Another bloom of heterotrophic bacteria belonging to the Cytophaga johnsonae complex was detected in the nutrient-amended mesocosms after 13 days. The dominance of this C. johnsonae-like bacterium could even be seen in the environmental tRNAs of the bacterioplankton, where its specific tRNAs prevailed from day 13 onward. This event was also independent of the introduced nonindigenous bacteria because it occurred at the same time in all nutrient-amended mesocosms. By contrast, in the unamended experiments, a different small 5S rRNA could by observed from day 10 onward with less pronounced dominance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - 4-Oxalocrotonate tautomerase, an enzyme composed of 62 amino acid residues per monomer.
AB  - The xylH gene encoding 4-oxalocrotonate tautomerase (4-OT) has been located on a  subclone of the Pseudomonas putida mt-2 TOL plasmid pWW0 and inserted into an Escherichia coli expression vector. Several of the genes of the metafission pathway encoded by pWW0 have been cloned in E. coli, but the overexpression of their gene products has met with limited success. By utilizing the E. coli alkaline phosphatase promoter (phoA) coupled with the proper positioning of a ribosome-binding region, we are able to express functional 4-OT in yields of at least 10 mg of pure enzyme/liter of culture. 4-OT has been previously characterized and shown to be an extremely efficient catalyst (Whitman, C. P., Aird, B. A., Gillespie, W. R., and Stolowich, N. J. (1991) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 113, 3154-3162). Kinetic and physical characterization of the E. coli-expressed protein show that it is identical with that of the 4-OT isolated from P. putida. The functional unit is apparently a pentamer of identical subunits, each consisting of only 62 amino acid residues. This is the smallest enzyme subunit reported to date. The amino acid sequence, determined in part from automated Edman degradation and also deduced from the primary sequence of xylH, did not show homology with any of the sequences in the current data bases nor with any of the sequences of enzymes that catalyze similar reactions. We propose that the active site of 4-OT may be established by an overlap of subunits and comprised of amino acid residues belonging to several, if not all, of the subunits.
TI  - Cloning and transposon vectors derived from satellite bacteriophage P4 for genetic manipulation of Pseudomonas and other gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - We developed transposon and cloning shuttle vectors for genetic manipulation of Pseudomonas and other gram-negative bacteria, exploiting the unique properties and the broad host range of the satellite bacteriophage P4. P4::Tn5 AP-1 and P4::Tn5 AP-2 are suicide transposon vectors which have been used for efficient Tn5 mutagenesis in Pseudomonas putida. pKGB2 is a phasmid vector with a cloning capacity of about 7.5 kb; useful unique cloning sites are SacI and SacII in the streptomycin resistance determinant and PvuI and XhoI in the kanamycin resistance determinant. pKGB4 is a cosmid derived from pKGB2 and carries the additional cloning site SmaI in the kanamycin resistance determinant; its cloning capacity is about 18 kb. These vectors and their recombined derivatives were transferred from Escherichia coli to P. putida by transduction and may be used for other bacterial species susceptible to P4 infection.
TI  - Gonococcal transferrin-binding protein 1 is required for transferrin utilization  and is homologous to TonB-dependent outer membrane receptors.
AB  - The pathogenic Neisseria species are capable of utilizing transferrin as their sole source of iron. A neisserial transferrin receptor has been identified and its characteristics defined; however, the biochemical identities of proteins which are required for transferrin receptor function have not yet been determined. We identified two iron-repressible transferrin-binding proteins in Neisseria gonorrhoeae, TBP1 and TBP2. Two approaches were taken to clone genes required for gonococcal transferrin receptor function. First, polyclonal antiserum raised against TBP1 was used to identify clones expressing TBP1 epitopes. Second, a wild-type gene copy was cloned that repaired the defect in a transferrin receptor function (trf) mutant. The clones obtained by these two approaches were shown to overlap by DNA sequencing. Transposon mutagenesis of both clones and recombination of mutagenized fragments into the gonococcal chromosome generated mutants that showed reduced binding of transferrin to whole cells and that were incapable of growth on transferrin. No TBP1 was produced in these mutants, but TBP2 expression was normal. The DNA sequence of the gene encoding gonococcal TBP1 (tbpA) predicted a protein sequence homologous to the Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida TonB-dependent outer membrane receptors. Thus, both the function and the predicted protein sequence of TBP1 were consistent with this protein serving as a transferrin receptor.
TI  - [Plasmid P85 from Azospirillum brasilense SP245: study of the circle of possible  hosts and incompatibility with plasmids from Azospirillum brasilense SP7].
AB  - The possibility of the stable inheritance of the plasmid p85 mobilized derivatives from Azospirillum brasilense Sp245 in the cells of the bacterial genera Rizobiaceae (Agrobacterium tumfaciens) and Pseudomonadaceae (Pseudomonas putida) has been shown. The plasmid p85 participates in coding for the physiologically active products (the plant hormones). It is not inherited by the Escherichia coli strains. For the first time the incompatibility of azospirillium plasmids has been demonstrated on the example of the plasmid p85 from Azospirillum brasilense Sp245 and the plasmid p115 from Azospirillum brasilense Sp7.
TI  - Oxidation of nitrotoluenes by toluene dioxygenase: evidence for a monooxygenase reaction.
AB  - Pseudomonas putida F1 and Pseudomonas sp. strain JS150 initiate toluene degradation by incorporating molecular oxygen into the aromatic nucleus to form cis-1,2-dihydroxy-3-methylcyclohexa-3,5-diene. When toluene-grown cells were incubated with 2- and 3-nitrotoluene, the major products identified were 2- and 3-nitrobenzyl alcohol, respectively. The same cells oxidized 4-nitrotoluene to 2-methyl-5-nitrophenol and 3-methyl-6-nitrocatechol. Escherichia coli JM109(pDTG601), which contains the toluene dioxygenase genes from P. putida F1 under the control of the tac promoter, oxidized the isomeric nitrotoluenes to the same metabolites as those formed by P. putida F1 and Pseudomonas sp. strain JS150. These results extend the range of substrates known to be oxidized by this versatile enzyme and demonstrate for the first time that toluene dioxygenase can oxidize an aromatic methyl substituent.
TI  - Multiple periplasmic catalases in phytopathogenic strains of Pseudomonas syringae.
AB  - Phytopathogenic strains of Pseudomonas syringae are exposed to plant-produced, detrimental levels of hydrogen peroxide during invasion and colonization of host plant tissue. When P. syringae strains were investigated for their capacity to resist H2O2, they were found to contain 10- to 100-fold-higher levels of total catalase activity than selected strains belonging to nonpathogenic related taxa (Pseudomonas fluorescens and Pseudomonas putida) or Escherichia coli. Multiple catalase activities were identified in both periplasmic and cytoplasmic fluids of exponential- and stationary-phase P. syringae cells. Two of these activities were unique to the periplasm of P. syringae pv. glycinea. During the stationary growth phase, the specific activity of cytoplasmic catalases increased four- to eightfold. The specific activities of catalases in both fluids from exponential-phase cells increased in response to treatment with 0.25 to 10 mM H2O2 but decreased when higher H2O2 concentrations were used. In stationary-growth phase cultures, the specific activities of cytoplasmic catalases increased remarkably after treatment with 0.25 to 50 mM H2O2. The growth of P. syringae into stationary phase and H2O2 treatment did not induce synthesis of additional catalase isozymes. Only the stationary-phase cultures of all of the P. syringae strains which we tested were capable of surviving high H2O2 stress at concentrations up to 50 mM. Our results are consistent with the involvement of multiple catalase isozymes in the reduction of oxidative stress during plant pathogenesis by these bacteria.
TI  - Molecular cloning and mapping of phenol degradation genes from Bacillus stearothermophilus FDTP-3 and their expression in Escherichia coli.
AB  - Two genes of the meta pathway of phenol degradation were cloned from a phenol-utilizing strain of Bacillus stearothermophilus and were mapped by subcloning and by use of a Tn5 insertion mutation. They code for phenol hydroxylase and catechol 2,3-dioxygenase, respectively. The gene encoding catechol 2,3-dioxygenase, which is more thermostable than catechol 2,3-dioxygenase encoded by the other gene, shares rather limited homology with that from Pseudomonas putida.
TI  - Molecular characterization of the Entner-Doudoroff pathway in Escherichia coli: sequence analysis and localization of promoters for the edd-eda operon.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of the entire Escherichia coli edd-eda region that encodes the enzymes of the Entner-Doudoroff pathway was determined. The edd structural gene begins 236 bases downstream of zwf. The eda structural gene begins 34 bases downstream of edd. The edd reading frame is 1,809 bases long and encodes the 602-amino-acid, 64,446-Da protein 6-phosphogluconate dehydratase. The deduced primary amino acid sequences of the E. coli and Zymomonas mobilis dehydratase enzymes are highly conserved. The eda reading frame is 642 bases long and encodes the 213-amino-acid, 22,283-Da protein 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate aldolase. This enzyme had been previously purified and sequenced by others on the basis of its related enzyme activity, 2-keto-4-hydroxyglutarate aldolase. The data presented here provide proof that the two enzymes are identical. The primary amino acid sequences of the E. coli, Z. mobilis, and Pseudomonas putida aldolase enzymes are highly conserved. When E. coli is grown on gluconate, the edd and eda genes are cotranscribed. Four putative promoters within the edd-eda region were identified by transcript mapping and computer analysis. P1, located upstream of edd, appears to be the primary gluconate-responsive promoter of the edd-eda operon, responsible for induction of the Entner-Doudoroff pathway, as mediated by the gntR product. High basal expression of eda is explained by constitutive transcription from P2, P3, and/or P4 but not P1.
TI  - Characterization of the genes encoding beta-ketoadipate: succinyl-coenzyme A transferase in Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - beta-Ketoadipate:succinyl-coenzyme A transferase (beta-ketoadipate:succinyl-CoA transferase) (EC 2.8.3.6) carries out the penultimate step in the conversion of benzoate and 4-hydroxybenzoate to tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates in bacteria utilizing the beta-ketoadipate pathway. This report describes the characterization of a DNA fragment from Pseudomonas putida that encodes this enzyme. The fragment complemented mutants defective in the synthesis of the CoA transferase, and two proteins of sizes appropriate to encode the two nonidentical subunits of the enzyme were produced in Escherichia coli when the fragment was placed under the control of a phage T7 promoter. DNA sequence analysis revealed two open reading frames, designated pcaI and pcaJ, that were separated by 8 bp, suggesting that they may comprise an operon. A comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of the P. putida CoA transferase genes with the sequences of two other bacterial CoA transferases and that of succinyl-CoA:3-ketoacid CoA transferase from pig heart suggests that the homodimeric structure of the mammalian enzyme may have resulted from a gene fusion of the bacterial alpha and beta subunit genes during evolution. Conserved functional groups important to the catalytic activity of CoA transferases were also identified.
TI  - Binding of mutagenic pyrolyzates to fractions of intestinal bacterial cells.
AB  - The binding of mutagenic pyrolyzates to cell fractions from some gram-negative intestinal bacteria and to thermally treated bacterial cells was investigated. 3-Amino-1,4-dimethyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole (Trp-P-1) and 3-amino-1-methyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole (Trp-P-2) were effectively bound by several of the bacterial cells. The cell wall skeletons of all bacteria effectively bound Trp-P-1 and Trp-P-2. Their cytoplasmic fractions retained Trp-P-1 and Trp-P-2, but to a lesser extent than the cell wall skeletons. 2-Amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (IQ) was not found in their cytoplasmic fractions. These cell wall skeletons also bound 2-amino-6-methyldipyrido[1,2-a:3',2'-d]imidazole (Glu-P-1), 2-amino-5-phenylpyridine (Phe-P-1), IQ, 2-amino-3,4-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (MeIQ), and 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQX). The amount of each mutagen bound differed with the type of mutagen and the bacterial strain used. The outer membrane of Escherichia coli IFO 14249 showed binding of about 123.7 micrograms/mg of Trp-P-2, and its cytoplasmic membrane bound 57.14 micrograms/mg. Trp-P-2 bound to the bacterial cells was extracted with ammonia (5%), methanol, and ethanol but not with water.
TI  - Isolation and molecular characterization of a novel broad-host-range plasmid from Bordetella bronchiseptica with sequence similarities to plasmids from gram-positive organisms.
AB  - A 2.6 kb plasmid, named pBBR1, was isolated from Bordetella bronchiseptica S87. After insertion of an antibiotic resistance marker, this plasmid could be transferred into Escherichia coli, Bordetella pertussis, B. bronchiseptica, Vibrio cholerae, Rhizobium meliloti, and Pseudomonas putida by transformation or conjugation. Conjugation was possible only when the IncP group transfer functions were provided in trans. As shown by incompatibility testing, pBBR1 does not belong to the broad-host-range IncP, IncQ or IncW groups. DNA sequence analysis revealed two open reading frames: one was called Rep, involved in replication of the plasmid, and the other, called Mob, was involved in mobilization. Both the amino-terminal region of Mob and its promoter region show sequence similarities to Mob/Pre proteins from plasmids of Gram-positive bacteria. In spite of these sequence similarities, pBBR1 does not replicate via the rolling-circle mechanism commonly used by small Gram-positive plasmids. We therefore speculate that pBBR1 may combine a mobilization mechanism of Gram-positive organisms with a replication mechanism of Gram-negative organisms. Determination of the plasmid copy number in E. coli and B. pertussis indicated that pBBR1 has a rather high copy number, which, in conjunction with its small size and broad host range, renders it particularly interesting for studies of broad-host-range replicons and for the development of new cloning vectors for a wide range of Gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Cloning, sequencing, and overexpression of a [2Fe-2S] ferredoxin gene from Escherichia coli.
AB  - Escherichia coli contains a soluble, [2Fe-2S] ferredoxin of unknown function (Knoell, H.-E., and Knappe, J. (1974) Eur. J. Biochem. 50, 245-252). Using antiserum to the purified protein to screen E. coli genomic expression libraries, we have cloned a gene (designated fdx) encoding this protein. The DNA sequence of the gene predicts a polypeptide of 110 residues after removal of the initiator methionine (polypeptide M(r) = 12,186, holoprotein M(r) = 12,358). The deduced amino acid sequence is strikingly similar to those of the ferredoxins found in animal mitochondria which function with cytochrome P450 enzymes and to the ferredoxin from Pseudomonas putida which functions with P450cam. The overall sequence identity is approximately 36% when compared with human mitochondrial and P. putida ferredoxins, and the identities include 4 cysteine residues proposed to coordinate the iron cluster. The protein was overproduced approximately 500-fold using an expression plasmid, and the holoprotein was assembled and accumulated in amounts exceeding 30% of the total cell protein. The overexpressed ferredoxin exhibits absorption, circular dichroism, and electron paramagnetic resonance spectra closely resembling those of the animal ferredoxins and P. putida ferredoxin.
TI  - Analysis of an upstream regulatory sequence required for activation of the regulatory gene xylS in xylene metabolism directed by the TOL plasmid of Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - Transcription from the promoter of a positive regulatory gene, xylS, on the TOL plasmid of Pseudomonas putida is activated by another positive regulator, XylR, in the presence of m-xylene and is dependent on RNA polymerase containing the NtrA protein (sigma 54). Deletion analysis of the upstream region of the xylS gene revealed an upstream regulatory sequence (URS), located between 145 and 188 bp upstream from the transcription start site. The URS is active in either orientation and can be placed 3.9 kb further upstream without loss of activity. Dependence of activation on helical periodicity was observed in the region between the URS and the promoter of the xylS gene, suggesting DNA loop formation between these two sites, which are located about 100 bp apart. The expression of xylR was autogenously repressed by XylR protein. This autogenous repression is decreased in an NtrA- background, irrespective of the presence of the xylS promoter in cis, indicating that NtrA protein, or NtrA-containing RNA polymerase that is not bound to the xylS promoter, is involved in the binding of XylR protein to the URS.
TI  - Analysis of mutations in trfA, the replication initiation gene of the broad-host-range plasmid RK2.
AB  - Plasmids with mutations in trfA, the gene encoding the replication initiation protein of the broad-host-range plasmid RK2, were isolated and characterized. Mutants identified from a nitrosoguanidine bank were defective in supporting the replication of a wild-type RK2 origin in Escherichia coli. Most of the mutations were clustered in a region of trfA corresponding to the carboxy-terminal quarter of the TrfA protein. 5' and 3' deletion mutants of trfA were also constructed. A C-terminal deletion of three amino acids of the Tr A protein was completely nonfunctional for RK2 replication. However, a deletion of 25 amino acids from the start of the 33-kDa TrfA protein was still competent for replication. Further characterization of the point and deletion trfA mutants in vivo revealed that a subset was capable of supporting RK2 replication in other gram-negative bacteria, including Pseudomonas putida, Agrobacterium tumefaciens, and Azotobacter vinelandii. Selected mutant TrfA proteins were partially purified and characterized in vitro. Velocity sedimentation analysis of these partially purified TrfA proteins indicated that the wild-type protein and all mutant TrfA proteins examined exist as dimers in solution. Results from in vitro replication assays corroborated the experimental findings in vivo. Gel retardation results clearly indicated that the point mutant TrfA-33:151S, which was completely defective in replication of an RK2 origin in all of the bacterial hosts tested in vivo, and a carboxy-terminal deletion mutant, TrfA-33:C delta 305, were not able to bind iterons in vitro. In addition to the partially defective or could not be distinguished from the wild-type protein in binding to the origin region. The mutant proteins with apparently normal DNA-binding activity in vitro either were inactive in all four gram-negative bacteria tested or exhibited differences in functionality depending on the host organism. These mutant TrfA proteins may be altered in the ability to interact with the replication proteins of the specific host bacterium.
TI  - Bioluminescence-based detection of genetically engineered microorganisms in nonsterile river water.
AB  - The luminescence genes of the marine bacterium Vibrio fischeri were cloned into a lac expression vector and introduced into Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida. Survival of the cells in river water samples was monitored by light measurements. Whereas E. coli survived in sterilized river water for more than 29 days, it died off in nonsterile river water after 9 to 13 days. The engineered P. putida cells survived in nonsterile river water for more than 137 days. The detection limit for E. coli was 11 cells/ml.
TI  - Molecular biology of the 2-haloacid halidohydrolase IVa from Pseudomonas cepacia  MBA4.
AB  - The structural gene (hdl IVa) for the Pseudomonas cepacia MBA4 2-haloacid halidohydrolase IVa (Hdl IVa) was isolated on a 1.6 kb fragment of Ps. cepacia MBA4 chromosomal DNA. The recombinant halidohydrolase was expressed in Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida and the structural gene was subcloned on to the tac expression vector pBTac1. High-level expression from the tac promoter was seen to be temperature-dependent, a consequence of the nucleotide sequence adjacent to the fragment encoding the halidohydrolase. The nucleotide sequence of the fragment encoding the Hdl IVa was determined and analysed. Three ATG codons were identified in one of the open reading frames and the one corresponding to the start of the hdl IVa structural gene was determined by comparison of the predicted amino acid sequences with the experimentally determined N-terminal sequences of halidohydrolase IVa. The hdl IVa gene encoded a 231-amino acid-residue protein of M(r) 25,900. The sequence and predicted structural data are discussed and comparison is made with sequence data for other halidohydrolases.
TI  - Resonance Raman investigations of Escherichia coli-expressed Pseudomonas putida cytochrome P450 and P420.
AB  - High-resolution resonance Raman spectra of the ferric, ferrous, and carbonmonoxy  (CO)-bound forms of wild-type Escherichia coli-expressed Pseudomonas putida cytochrome P450cam and its P420 form are reported. The ferric and ferrous species of P450 and P420 have been studied in both the presence and absence of excess camphor substrate. In ferric, camphor-bound, P450 (mos), the E. coli-expressed P450 is found to be spectroscopically indistinguishable from the native material. Although substrate binding to P450 is known to displace water molecules from the heme pocket, altering the coordination and spin state of the heme iron, the presence of camphor substrate in P420 samples is found to have essentially no effect on the Raman spectra of the heme in either the oxidized or reduced state. A detailed study of the Raman and absorption spectra of P450 and P420 reveals that the P420 heme is in equilibrium between a high-spin, five-coordinate (HS,5C) form and low-spin six-coordinate (LS,6C) form in both the ferric and ferrous oxidation states. In the ferric P420 state, H2O evidently remains as a heme ligand, while alterations of the protein tertiary structure lead to a significant reduction in affinity for Cys(357) thiolate binding to the heme iron. Ferrous P420 also consists of an equilibrium between HS,5C and LS,6C states, with the spectroscopic evidence indicating that H2O and histidine are the most likely axial ligands. The spectral characteristics of the CO complex of P420 are found to be almost identical to those of a low pH of Mb. Moreover, we find that the 10-ns transient Raman spectrum of the photolyzed P420 CO complex possesses a band at 220 cm-1, which is strong evidence in favor of histidine ligation in the CO-bound state. The equilibrium structure of ferrous P420 does not show this band, indicating that Fe-His bond formation is favored when the iron becomes more acidic upon CO binding. Raman spectra of stationary samples of the CO complex of P450 reveal VFe-CO peaks corresponding to both substrate-bound and substrate-free species and demonstrate that substrate dissociation is coupled to CO photolysis. Analysis of the relative band intensities as a function of photolysis indicates that the CO photolysis and rebinding rates are faster than camphor rebinding and that CO binds to the heme faster when camphor is not in the distal pocket.
TI  - Construction of a cassette enabling regulated gene expression in the presence of  aromatic hydrocarbons.
AB  - A high-level expression cassette has been constructed from a TOL plasmid derived  from Pseudomonas putida carrying all cis- and trans-acting regulatory elements necessary for transcriptional gene activation in the presence of aromatic hydrocarbons such as toluene. Foreign DNA can be inserted at unique KpnI, SacI, and EcoRI sites 7, 13, and 15 nucleotides downstream of a ribosome binding site. The cassette, flanked by BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites, was inserted into a broad-host-range vector and its efficacy demonstrated in various purple bacteria by monitoring the expression of a reporter gene spectrophotometrically and by SDS-PAGE. High-level induction (80- to 600-fold) was detected in Enterobacteriaceae and in Pseudomonas but was absent or low in Agrobacterium tumefaciens and Rhizobium leguminosarum.
TI  - Upstream binding sequences of the XylR activator protein and integration host factor in the xylS gene promoter region of the Pseudomonas TOL plasmid.
AB  - The xylR and xylS genes, which encode the positive regulators of the TOL plasmid  catabolic pathways, are adjacent genes on the TOL plasmid and are transcribed from divergent promoters. Transcription from the xylS gene promoter, Ps, is positively regulated by effector-activated XylR protein and requires the specific RNA polymerase sigma 54 subunit (RpoN). Deletions and point mutations in the Ps upstream region localized the site of XylR interaction to the region between -133 bp and -207 bp (with respect to the transcriptional start of the xylS messenger), which contains an inverted sequence repeat largely homologous to the motif recognised by XylR in the XylR-regulated 'upper' catabolic pathway promoter, Pu. Gel retardation experiments showed binding of IHF to the Ps promoter region. Corresponding sequences showing good homology to the IHF-binding consensus were identified close to the Ps Promoter (between -35 bp and -47 bp, Ps proximal site) and further upstream overlapping the XylR recognition sequence (Ps distal site). In the latter case IHF recognition motifs were found well conserved on both strands at nearly the same position (between -140 bp and -152 bp on the upper and between -141 bp and -153 bp on the lower strand). Expression from Ps, either under inducing or non-inducing conditions, was, however, only slightly influenced by the absence of IHF in an IHF-deficient mutant and thus activation of Ps, like that of other sigma 54-dependent promoters which are rich in Ts, does not absolutely require IHF protein.
TI  - Expression and regulation of a dnaA homologue isolated from Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - A gene homologous to the Escherichia coli dnaA gene was isolated from Pseudomonas putida and its transcription was investigated in E. coli as well as in P. putida. In both species the P. putida dnaA gene is transcribed from two promoters, one of which shows strong homology to promoters recognized by the sigma 54 factor found in both bacteria. In E. coli transcription of the P. putida dnaA gene can be repressed by overproduction of E. coli DnaA protein, presumably due to the presence of several DnaA-box-like sequences found in the promoter region. Likewise the P. putida DnaA protein is able to regulate expression of the E. coli dnaA gene but we failed to demonstrate autoregulation of the P. putida dnaA gene. A point mutation was introduced into the P. putida dnaA gene, equivalent to the ATP binding site mutation present in E. coli dnaA5 and dnaA46 mutants, and this alteration abolished the ability of the protein to repress the expression of the E. coli dnaA gene. These results indicate that DnaA proteins from other species than E. coli have maintained the ability to recognize the DnaA box sequence and that the conservation between the DnaA proteins reflects functionally similar domains.
TI  - Cloning and partial sequencing of an operon encoding two Pseudomonas putida haloalkanoate dehalogenases of opposite stereospecificity.
AB  - We have cloned fragments of DNA (up to 13 kb), from Pseudomonas putida AJ1, that  code for two stereospecific haloalkanoate dehalogenases. These enzymes are highly specific for D and L substrates. The two genes, designated hadD and hadL, have been isolated and independently expressed in Escherichia coli and P. putida hosts by using broad-host-range vectors. They are closely adjacent and inducible in what appears to be an operon with an upstream open reading frame of unknown function. Nucleotide sequence determination of hadD predicts a mature, cytoplasmic protein of 300 amino acid residues (molecular weight of 33,601). This has no significant homology with the L-specific haloalkanoate dehalogenases from Pseudomonas sp. strain CBS3 (B. Schneider, R. Muller, R. Frank, and F. Lingens, J. Bacteriol. 173:1530-1535, 1991) nor with any other known DNA or protein sequences.
TI  - Genes and their organization in the replication origin region of the bacterial chromosome.
AB  - Genes and their organization are conserved in the replication origin region of the bacterial chromosome. To determine the extent of the conserved region in Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, which diverged 1.2 billion years ago, we have further sequenced the region upstream from the dnaA genes in Bacillus subtilis and Pseudomonas putida. Fifteen open reading frames (ORFs) and 11 ORFs were identified in the 13.6 kb and the 9.8 kb fragments in B. subtilis and P. putida, respectively. Eight consecutive P. putida genes, except for one small ORF (homologous to gene 9K of Escherichia coli) in between, are homologous in sequence and relative locations to genes in B. subtilis. Altogether, 12 genes and their organization are conserved in B. subtilis and P. putida in the origin region. We found that the conserved region terminated on one side after the orf290 in P. putida (orf282 in B. subtilis). In the B. subtilis chromosome, five additional ORFs were found in between the conserved genes, suggesting that they are added after Gram-positive bacteria were diverged from the Gram-negative bacteria. One of the ORFs is a duplicate of the conserved gene. The third non-translatable region containing multiple repeats of DnaA-box (second in the case of P. putida) was found flanking gidA in both organisms. This result shows clearly that E. coli oriC and flanking genes gidA and gidB have been translocated by the inversion of some 40 kb fragment.
TI  - Construction of a broad host range shuttle vector for gene cloning and expression in Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae and other Pasteurellaceae.
AB  - We have constructed a pair of broad host range expression vectors, pJFF224-NX and pJFF224-XN, based on plasmid RSF1010, which enable cloning and efficient expression of genes in Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae and Pasteurella haemolytica and in Escherichia coli. The vectors consist of the minimal autonomous replicon of the broad host range plasmid RSF1010 and a type II chloramphenicol acetyl transferase gene for chloramphenicol resistance selection. In addition, they contain a gene expression cassette based on the E. coli bacteriophage T4 gene 32 promoter region and a transcription stop signal, which are separated by a segment of multiple cloning sites in both orientations. Electroporation and subsequent selection for chloramphenicol resistance was used for the introduction of the vectors in A. pleuropneumoniae and P. haemolytica. A promoterless xy/E gene from the Pseudomonas putida TOL plasmid was cloned onto pJFF224-NX. This plasmid enabled efficient expression of active catechol2,3oxygenase in A. pleuropneumoniae and P. haemolytica. It was stably maintained in A. pleuropneumoniae without antibiotic selection, showing less than 0.1% loss after 100 generations, while native RSF1010 and other RSF1010-based vectors were unstable in this host.
TI  - Localization and functional analysis of structural and regulatory dehalogenase genes carried on DEH from Pseudomonas putida PP3.
AB  - Pseudomonas putida PP3 expressed two dehalogenases, DehI and DehII. The DehI gene (dehI) was located on a mobile DNA element (DEH) which inserted at high frequencies into target plasmids from its chromosomal location. From a recombinant TOL plasmid (pWW0) containing a 6.0-kb DEH element inserted into the plasmid's 5.6-kb EcoRI-G restriction endonuclease fragment, an 11.6-kb EcoRI fragment was cloned. Subcloning analysis and insertion mutagenesis produced a structural map of the DEH element and located the dehalogenase functions. The gene dehI was transcribed from a regulated promoter on DEH which was expressed in P. putida and Escherichia coli. The direction of transcription of dehI was determined, and it was also found to be under positive control, activated by an adjacent regulatory gene (dehRI). Expression of dehI in clones containing the intact DEH supported good growth on 2-monochloropropionate (2MCPA). Subclones lacking dehRI expressed dehI at levels which allowed only slow growth on 2MCPA, even when dehI expression was initiated from vector promoters. Expression of dehI in P. putida containing the intact DEH element required rpoN, suggesting that it was omega 54 dependent. The intact DEH element transferred to P. putida on a suicide plasmid donor pAWT34 (pBR325 replicon), and dehI was stably inherited, without vector DNA sequences, in transformants selected on 2MCPA. This indicated that the cloned DEH element contained functions associated with recombination.
TI  - The dehalogenase gene dehI from Pseudomonas putida PP3 is carried on an unusual mobile genetic element designated DEH.
AB  - As a result of the production of two dehalogenases (DehI and DehII), Pseudomonas  putida PP3 utilized halogenated alkanoic acids, such as 2-monochloropropionic acid (2MCPA), as sole sources of carbon and energy. The DehI gene (dehI) was carried on a mobile genetic element (DEH) located on the chromosome of strain PP3. DEH recombined with target plasmid DNAs at high frequencies (e.g. 3.8 x 10(-4) per RP4.5 plasmid transferred). The regulated expression of dehI was detected in P. putida, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli strains containing derivative plasmids of RP4.5 and pWW0 recombined with DEH. Movement of DEH from the unstable RP4 derivatives pNJ5000 and pMR5 resulted in the insertion of DEH into the chromosome of RecA+ strains of P. putida but not in RecA+ nor RecA- strains of E. coli. Rescue of DEH from the chromosome of P. putida KT2441 onto plasmid RP4 involved recombination at a frequency (2.7 x 10(-4) per RP4 plasmid transferred) comparable to that observed in strain PP3. The DEH element was not classified as a conventional transposon because it did not move as a discrete DNA fragment: dehI-containing inserts in plasmid DNA targets varied in size between 6 and 13 kb. In addition, DEH exhibited a marked preference for insertion into a specific site on the plasmid pWW0, but its transposition, independent of host recombinational systems, remains to be demonstrated. However, the transposonlike characteristics of DEH included the conservation of restriction endonuclease sites, high-frequency recombination with different target replicons (plasmid and chromosomal DNA), and promiscuous insertion into plasmid RP4-based replicons. Therefore, it is proposed that DEH is an unusual mobile genetic element.
TI  - Sequence and complementation analysis of recF genes from Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Pseudomonas putida and Bacillus subtilis: evidence for an essential phosphate binding loop.
AB  - We have compared the recF genes from Escherichia coli K-12, Salmonella typhimurium, Pseudomonas putida, and Bacillus subtilis at the DNA and amino acid sequence levels. To do this we determined the complete nucleotide sequence of the recF gene from Salmonella typhimurium and we completed the nucleotide sequence of recF gene from Pseudomonas putida begun by Fujita et al. (1). We found that the RecF proteins encoded by these two genes contain respectively 92% and 38% amino acid identity with the E. coli RecF protein. Additionally, we have found that the S. typhimurium and P. putida recF genes will complement an E. coli recF mutant, but the recF gene from Bacillus subtilis [showing about 20% identity with E. coli (2)] will not. Amino acid sequence alignment of the four proteins identified four highly conserved regions. Two of these regions are part of a putative phosphate binding loop. In one region (position 36), we changed the lysine codon (which is essential for ATPase, GTPase and kinase activity in other proteins having this phosphate binding loop) to an arginine codon. We then tested this mutation (recF4101) on a multicopy plasmid for its ability to complement a recF chromosomal mutation and on the E. coli chromosome for its effect on sensitivity to UV irradiation. The strain with recF4101 on its chromosome is as sensitive as a null recF mutant strain. The strain with the plasmid-borne mutant allele is however more UV resistant than the null mutant strain. We conclude that lysine-36 and possibly a phosphate binding loop is essential for full recF activity. Lastly we made two chimeric recF genes by exchanging the amino terminal 48 amino acids of the S. typhimurium and E. coli recF genes. Both chimeras could complement E. coli chromosomal recF mutations.
TI  - The influence of temperature on the behaviour of mixed bacterial contamination of the shell membrane of the hen's egg.
AB  - The inner membrane of the air cell of hens' eggs was inoculated with Pseudomonas  putida, Staphylococcus xylosus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli and Salmonella enteritidis. The first mentioned eventually dominated the contamination of the albumen of eggs stored at 4, 15, and 20 degrees C. The last mentioned did so in eggs stored at 37 degrees C. The interval between inoculation of the membrane and gross contamination of the albumen was markedly influenced by site of contamination relative to yolk movement.
TI  - Structure of the dnaA and DnaA-box region in the Mycoplasma capricolum chromosome: conservation and variations in the course of evolution.
AB  - We have previously shown that the dnaA gene and the DnaA-box region were conserved in bacteria representative of all three major branches of the eubacterial phylogenic tree: high G + C Gram+, low-G + C Gram+ and Gram-. In the present work, we determined the structure of the dnaA region of Mycoplasma capricolum and found that the dnaA gene and at least two other genes, rpmH and dnaN, were conserved in this bacterium. An unusually high level of amino acid (aa) substitutions was observed in M. capricolum DnaA. It was the case even in those aa which were well conserved in other bacterial species. The nontranslatable region upstream from the dnaA gene was also conserved in this bacterium, as it was universally found in both Gram+ and Gram- bacteria. An additional nontranslatable region downstream from the dnaA gene, which is common to Gram+ bacteria, was also found in M. capricolum, consistent with the proposal that M. capricolum is Gram+ in origin. These regions were rich in A + T and contained ten DnaA-box-like sequences (9-mers that differ from TTATCCACA by one or two bases).
TI  - Nitroaromatics Are Substrates for the TOL Plasmid Upper-Pathway Enzymes.
AB  - Expression of the xylMA genes encoding for toluene monoxygenase from the lactose  promoter in a broad-host-range plasmid allows the oxidation of toluene and m- and p-nitrotoluene to their corresponding benzyl alcohols and benzaldehydes in Pseudomonas putida and Escherichia coli. Benzyl alcohols accumulate until reaching a concentration of about 80 muM, while benzaldehydes accumulate steadily with time for at least 24 h. TOL-encoded benzyl alcohol dehydrogenase and benzaldehyde dehydrogenase recognize m- and p-nitro-substituted compounds as substrates. In contrast, the XylR protein, which regulates the TOL plasmid-encoded upper-pathway operon, does not recognize nitro-substituted toluenes as effectors.
TI  - Cloning, sequence and transcriptional analysis of the structural gene for LPD-3,  the third lipoamide dehydrogenase of Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - The third lipoamide dehydrogenase structural gene of Pseudomonas putida, lpd3, was isolated from a library of P. putida PpG2 DNA cloned in Escherichia coli TB1. The nucleotide sequence of lpd3 and its flanking regions indicate that lpd3 is not part of an operon, which is unique for a prokaryotic lipoamide dehydrogenase. An open reading frame was found 207 bases upstream from the start of transcription, but is encoded on the strand opposite lpd3. There is no evidence of an open reading frame immediately downstream from lpd3. The coding region of lpd3 consists of 1401 bp, providing for 466 amino acids plus a stop codon with a G/C content of 62.4%. The transcriptional start site was located 33-bp upstream from the start of translation. The third lipoamide dehydrogenase (LPD-3) shares amino acid identity with the other two lipoamide dehydrogenases of P. putida, 45% with that of the 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase and pyruvate multienzyme complexes, and 45.9% with the lipoamide dehydrogenase of the branched-chain oxoacid complex. LPD-3 is more closely related to eukaryotic lipoamide dehydrogenases since it has 53.6% amino acid sequence identity with pig and human lipoamide dehydrogenases and 51.1% identity with yeast lipoamide dehydrogenase. LPD-3 was not produced in wild-type P. putida PpG2 under a variety of growth conditions. However, LPD-3 was produced in P. putida PpG2 carrying pSP14, a pKT240-based clone with the entire lpd3 gene plus 104 bases of the leader. The only demonstrated role of LPD-3 in P. putida is as a substitute for lipoamide dehydrogenase of the 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase and pyruvate multienzyme complexes when the latter is inactive or missing.
TI  - One-step cloning system for isolation of bacterial lexA-like genes.
AB  - A system to isolate lexA-like genes of bacteria directly was developed. It is based upon the fact that the presence of a lexA(Def) mutation is lethal to SulA+ cells of Escherichia coli. This system is composed of a SulA- LexA(Def) HsdR- strain and a lexA-conditional killer vector (plasmid pUA165) carrying the wild-type sulA gene of E. coli and a polylinker in which foreign DNA may be inserted. By using this method, the lexA-like genes of Salmonella typhimurium, Erwinia carotovora, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and P. putida were cloned. We also found that the LexA repressor of S. typhimurium presented the highest affinity for the SOS boxes of E. coli in vivo, whereas the LexA protein of P. aeruginosa had the lowest. Likewise, all of these LexA repressors were cleaved by the activated RecA protein of E. coli after DNA damage. Furthermore, under high-stringency conditions, the lexA gene of E. coli hybridized with the lexA genes of S. typhimurium and E. carotovora but not with those of P. aeruginosa and P. putida.
TI  - Structure and function of DnaA and the DnaA-box in eubacteria: evolutionary relationships of bacterial replication origins.
AB  - DnaA protein (a trans-acting element) and its binding sequence, DnaA-box: (a cis-acting element) are two elements essential for the initiation of chromosomal replication in Escherichia coli and other enteric bacteria. Recently these two elements have been found to be conserved in three Gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus and Mycoplasma capricolum) as well as in Gram-negative pseudomonads. DnaA protein was also found to be essential in the initiation of the replication of the B. subtilis chromosome, and regions containing multiple repeats of DnaA-box (DnaA-box region) are found to be active as autonomously replicating elements both in B. subtilis and pseudomonads. In this MicroReview we compare first the structures of these DnaA-box regions and their locations on the chromosome and then functional aspects of DnaA protein and DnaA-box regions in the initiation and regulation of chromosomal replication. From these observations we propose evolutionary relationships between replication origins of eubacteria.
TI  - Identification of a novel composite transposable element, Tn5280, carrying chlorobenzene dioxygenase genes of Pseudomonas sp. strain P51.
AB  - Analysis of one of the regions of catabolic plasmid pP51 which encode chlorobenzene metabolism of Pseudomonas sp. strain P51 revealed that the tcbA and tcbB genes for chlorobenzene dioxygenase and dehydrogenase are located on a transposable element, Tn5280. Tn5280 showed the features of a composite bacterial transposon with iso-insertion elements (IS1066 and IS1067) at each end of the transposon oriented in an inverted position. When a 12-kb HindIII fragment of pP51 containing Tn5280 was cloned in the suicide donor plasmid pSUP202, marked with a kanamycin resistance gene, and introduced into Pseudomonas putida donor plasmid pSUP202, marked with a kanamycin resistance gene, and introduced into Pseudomonas putida KT2442, Tn5280 was found to transpose into the genome at random and in single copy. The insertion elements IS1066 and IS1067 differed in a single base apir located in the inner inverted repeat and were found to be highly homologous to a class of repetitive elements of Bradyrhizobium japonicum and distantly related to IS630 of Shigella sonnei. The presence of the catabolic genes tcbA and tcbB on Tn5280 suggests a mechanism by which gene clusters can be mobilized as gene cassettes and joined with others to form novel catabolic pathways.
TI  - Genetic organization and regulation of the xylose degradation genes in Streptomyces rubiginosus.
AB  - The xylose isomerase (xylA) and the xylulose kinase (xylB) genes from Streptomyces rubiginosus were isolated, and their nucleotide sequences were determined. The xylA and xylB genes encode proteins of 388 and 481 amino acids, respectively. These two genes are transcribed divergently from within a 114-nucleotide sequence separating the coding regions. Regulation of the xyl genes in S. rubiginosus was examined by fusing their promoters to the Pseudomonas putida catechol dioxygenase gene and integrating the fusions into the minicircle integration site on the S. rubiginosus chromosome. The expression of catechol dioxygenase was then measured under a variety of conditions. The results indicated that transcription of the xyl genes was induced by D-xylose and repressed by glucose. Data from quantitative S1 mapping were consistent with this conclusion and suggested that xylA had one and xylB had two transcription initiation sites. The transcription initiation site of xylA was 40 bp upstream of the coding region. The two transcription initiation sites of xylB were 20 and 41 bp 5' of its translation initiation codon. Under control of appropriate regulatory elements, the cloned xyl genes are capable of complementing either Escherichia coli xylose isomerase- or xylulose kinase-deficient strains. The deduced amino acid sequence of the S. rubiginosus xylA protein is highly homologous to sequences of other microbial xylose isomerases.
TI  - DNA sequence determination of the TOL plasmid (pWWO) xylGFJ genes of Pseudomonas  putida: implications for the evolution of aromatic catabolism.
AB  - The meta operon of the Pseudomonas putida TOL plasmid (pWWO) encodes all enzymes  of a meta-cleavage pathway for the metabolism of benzoic acids to Krebs-cycle intermediates. We have determined and analysed the nucleic acid sequence of a 3442 bp region of the meta operon containing the xyl-GFJ genes whose products are involved in the post meta-ring fission transformation of catechols. Homology analysis of the xylGFJ gene products revealed evidence of biochemical relatedness, suggested enzymatic mechanisms, and permitted us to propose evolutionary events which may have generated the current variety of aromatic degradative pathways. The xylG gene, which specifies 2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde dehydrogenase (HMSD), was found to encode a protein of 51.7 kDa. The predicted protein sequence exhibits significant homology to eukaryotic aldehyde dehydrogenases (ADHs) and to the products of two other Pseudomonas catabolic genes, i.e. xylC and alkH. Expansion of the ADH superfamily to include these prokaryotic enzymes permitted a broader analysis of functionally critical ADH residues and phylogenetic relationships among superfamily members. The importance of three regions of these enzymes previously thought to be critical to ADH activity was reinforced by this analysis. However glutamine-487, also thought to be critical, is less well conserved. The revised ADH phylogeny proposed here suggests early catabolic ADH divergence with subsequent interkingdom gene exchange. The xylF gene, which specifies 2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde hydrolase (HMSH), was delineated by N-terminal sequence analysis of the purified gene product and is shown to encode a protein of 30.6 kDa. Homology analysis revealed sequence similarity to a chromosomally encoded serine hydrolase, especially in the region of the previously identified active-site serine residue, suggesting that HMSH may also possess a serine hydrolytic enzymatic mechanism. Likewise, the xylJ gene, which specifies 2-hydroxy-pent-2,4-dienoate hydratase (HPH), was delineated by N-terminal sequence analysis of purified HPH, and was found to encode a 23.9 kDa protein. Sequence comparisons revealed that both HMSH and HPH have analogues in the tod gene cluster, which specifies a toluene/benzene degradative pathway. Although the newly identified todF and todJ genes had been at least partially sequenced (Zylstra and Gibson, 1989), the open reading frames had not been positively identified. The presence of todJ provides strong evidence that the reactions following ring fission in the tod pathway are identical to those of the TOL pathway.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Novel plasmid vectors for gene cloning in Pseudomonas.
AB  - Novel host-vector systems have been developed for gene cloning in the metabolically versatile bacterial genus Pseudomonas. We found that a new Pseudomonas strain, Pseudomonas flavida IF-4, isolated from soil, carried two small cryptic plasmids, named pNI10 and pNI20. They were multi-copy, but not self-transmissible, and the genome size was 3.7 kb for pNI10 and 2.9 kb for pNI20. Several types of cloning vectors containing a kanamycin or streptomycin resistance (Kmr or Smr) gene were constructed from pNI10 and pNI20. These plasmid vectors were efficiently transformed into several strains of Pseudomonas at a frequency up to 4 x 10(5) transformants per 1 microgram plasmid DNA by the usual competent cell method. The vectors derived from pNI10 replicated not only in Pseudomonas but also in some other Gram-negative enteric bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Proteus mirabilis.
TI  - [Cloning of genes degrading 3-chlorobenzoate from Pseudomonas putida strain 87].
AB  - The ability of Pseudomonas putida strain 87 to catabolize 3-chlorobenzoate was shown to be mediated by genes of pBS109 plasmid. The plasmid may be transferred by conjugation into P. aeruginosa PAO2175. It seems possible that the pBS109 plasmid codes for pyrocatechase II specific for halogenated catechol, but not catechol. The genes specifying utilization of 3-chlorobenzoate from pBS109 plasmid were cloned in the 5.5 kb BgIII fragment by using broad-host cloning system. The resulting pBS110 plasmid was transferred into P. putida, which results in utilization of 3-chlorobenzoate by transconjugants.
TI  - Subcloning of bph genes from Pseudomonas testosteroni B-356 in Pseudomonas putida and Escherichia coli: evidence for dehalogenation during initial attack on chlorobiphenyls.
AB  - The bphA, -B, -C, and -D genes from Pseudomonas testosteroni B-356 were mapped to a 5.5-kb DNA fragment of cloned plasmids pDA1 and pDA2 by use of deletion and insertion mutants of these plasmids. The expression of each of these genes was evaluated in Escherichia coli and in Pseudomonas putida, and it was found that the bphC and bphD genes are well expressed in both E. coli and P. putida cells while the bphA and bphB genes are very poorly expressed in E. coli, even when placed downstream of a tac promotor. P. putida clones carrying the bphA gene were used to study the metabolites produced from 4,4'-dichlorobiphenyl, 2,2'-dichlorobiphenyl, and 2,4'-dichlorobiphenyl. It was shown that dehalogenation of 4-Cl and 2-Cl occurs in the course of the initial oxygenase attack on these molecules, which always occurs on carbons 2 and 3, independently of the positions of the chlorine atoms. Our data also suggest that in the case of polychlorobiphenyl congeners carrying chlorine atoms on both rings, it appears that, depending on the chlorine positions, dioxygenation will occur predominantly on one ring over the other. However, attack of the more resistant ring is not excluded, resulting in multiple conversion pathways.
TI  - Conjugational transfer of recombinant DNA in cultures and in soils: host range of Pseudomonas putida TOL plasmids.
AB  - Recombinant TOL plasmid pWWO-EB62 allows Pseudomonas putida to grow on p-ethylbenzoate. This plasmid can be transferred to other microorganisms, and its catabolic functions for the metabolism of alkylbenzoates are expressed in a limited number of gram-negative bacteria, including members of pseudomonad rRNA group I and Escherichia coli. Transfer of the recombinant plasmid to Erwinia chrysanthemi was observed, but transconjugants failed to grow on alkylbenzoates because they lost catabolic functions. Pseudomonads belonging to rRNA groups II, III, and IV, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and Alcaligenes sp. could not act as recipients for TOL, either because the plasmid was not transferred or because it was not stably maintained. The frequency of transfer of pWWO-EB62 from P. putida as a donor to pseudomonads belonging to rRNA group I was on the order of 1 to 10(-2) transconjugant per recipient, while the frequency of intergeneric transfer ranged from 10(-3) to 10(-7) transconjugant per recipient. The profile of potential hosts was conserved when the donor bacterium was Escherichia coli or Erwinia chrysanthemi instead of P. putida. No intergeneric gene transfer of the recombinant TOL plasmid was observed in soils; however, intraspecies transfer did take place. Intraspecies transfer of TOL in soils was affected by the type of soil used, the initial inoculum size, and the presence of chemicals that could affect the survival of the donor or recipient bacteria.
TI  - Construction of cloning cartridges for development of expression vectors in gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - A cloning cartridge was constructed that can be inserted into a plasmid of choice to form an expression vector in which gene expression is inducible with an inexpensive inducer, sodium salicylate, at low concentrations. This cartridge consists of a 3.6-kb restriction fragment which contains the positive regulatory gene nahR from plasmid NAH7, a promoter, PG, that nahR regulates, a multiple cloning site, a transcription terminator, and a gene conferring tetracycline resistance. Within promoter PG of the cloning cartridge, a sequence of three nucleotides upstream of the ATG sequence encoding the initiation codon was altered to create an NdeI recognition site (CATATG) for cloning of the 5' end of a gene without affecting the distance between the transcription start site and the gene coding region. In addition, the 5' end of a gene can be converted into an NdeI recognition site without altering the amino acid sequence it encodes and then cloned into this cartridge for regulated expression. Several other synthetic restriction sites were also inserted downstream of the NdeI site for accepting the 3' end of a cloned gene. A derivative of this cloning cartridge lacking the NdeI sequence was also constructed for cloning and expression of a restriction fragment containing a gene(s) of unknown sequence. Use of the cloning cartridges in a broad-host-range plasmid has allowed successful cloning and inducible expression of several genes in all of the gram-negative bacterial tested to date. Protein production to at least 10% of the total soluble cell proteins was observed from a cloned gene expressed in Pseudomonas putida.
TI  - Activation of the Pseudomonas TOL plasmid upper pathway operon. Identification of binding sites for the positive regulator XylR and for integration host factor protein.
AB  - Expression of the Pseudomonas putida TOL plasmid upper pathway operon requires a  promoter that belongs to the -12/-24 class. Stimulation of transcription from this promoter is positively controlled by the effector-activated XylR protein and requires a form of RNA-polymerase holoenzyme containing the RpoN-encoded sigma factor, sigma 54. XylR-dependent stimulation of transcription from the Pseudomonas TOL upper pathway promoter was examined using deletions, insertions, and in vivo dimethyl sulfate footprinting. Two upstream activator sequences were identified in the -160 (UAS1) and -130 (UAS2) regions. Deletion of these two regions abolished transcription activation, although conservation of the UAS2 element alone allowed limited transcription stimulation. Separation of UAS1 from UAS2 by half a turn or a full turn significantly reduced XylR stimulation of transcription from the upper pathway operon promoter. An inverted repeated ATTTGN2CAAAT (where N is any nucleoside), which most likely represented the XylR recognition sequence, was identified. Binding of XylR was observed in vivo in the absence of effector, but changes in the binding pattern were induced in the presence of m-methylbenzyl alcohol, a XylR effector. In vivo footprinting analysis revealed that changes in the methylation pattern of G and T also occurred in the -50 to -90 region, which is probably occupied by integration host factor (IHF) protein. IHF was required for maximal expression from the TOL upper pathway operon promoter in Escherichia coli. Separation of the IHF site from UAS2 by a full helix turn did not significantly affect stimulation of transcription, which is consistent with this region playing a conformational role, rather than a regulatory one, in promoter function.
TI  - Purification of glucose-inducible outer membrane protein OprB of Pseudomonas putida and reconstitution of glucose-specific pores.
AB  - A 43,000 molecular-weight, glucose-inducible, organic acid-repressible protein (OprB) was identified in the outer membrane of Pseudomonas putida. OprB was surface expressed in whole cells, had a high beta-sheet content, and was heat modifiable, as demonstrated by 125I-labeling, circular dichroism spectroscopy, and mobility on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. OprB was extracted from outer membrane preparations by using 2% Lubrol PX with 10 mM EDTA and purified by DEAE-Sephacel ion exchange chromatography following ammonium sulfate precipitation. Reconstitution experiments with black lipid membranes showed that OprB formed small, cation-selective pores which bound glucose (KS = 110 mM) and other carbohydrates. However, the binding site of OprB appeared to be distinct from that of the maltodextrin-specific porin LamB from Escherichia coli.
TI  - Overproduction, purification, and characterization of chlorocatechol dioxygenase, a non-heme iron dioxygenase with broad substrate tolerance.
AB  - We show here that purified chlorocatechol dioxygenase from Pseudomonas putida is  able to oxygenate a wide range of substituted catechols with turnover numbers ranging from 2 to 29 s-1. This enzyme efficiently cleaves substituted catechols bearing electron-donating or multiple electron-withdrawing groups in an intradiol manner with kcat/KM values between 0.2 x 10(7) and 1.4 x 10(7) M-1 s-1. These unique catalytic properties prompted a comparison with the related but highly specific enzymes catechol 1,2-dioxygenase and protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase. The chlorocatechol dioxygenase gene (clcA) from the Pseudomonas plasmid pAC27 was subcloned into the expression vector pKK223-3, allowing production of chlorocatechol dioxygenase to approximately 7-8% of total cellular protein. An average of 4 mg of purified enzyme has been obtained per gram of wet cells. Protein and iron analyses indicate an iron stoichiometry of 1 iron/57.5-kDa homodimer, alpha 2Fe. The electronic absorption spectrum contains a broad tyrosinate to iron charge transfer transition centered at 430 nm (epsilon = 3095 M-1 cm-1 based on iron concentration) which shifts to 490 nm (epsilon = 3380 M-1 cm-1) upon catechol binding. The resonance Raman spectrum of the native enzyme exhibits characteristic tyrosine ring vibrations. Electron paramagnetic resonance data for the resting enzyme (g = 4.25, 9.83) is consistent with high-spin iron (III) in a rhombic environment. This similarity between the spectroscopic properties of the Fe(III) centers in chlorocatechol dioxygenase and the more specific dioxygenases suggests a highly conserved catalytic site. We infer that the unique catalytic properties of chlorocatechol dioxygenase are due to other characteristics of its substrate binding pocket.
TI  - Cloning of pectate lyase gene pel from Pseudomonas fluorescens and detection of sequences homologous to pel in Pseudomonas viridiflava and Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - Pectate lyase (PL) depolymerizes pectin and other polygalacturonates (PGAs) and is thought to play a role in bacterial invasion of plants. Production of PL by the soft-rotting pathogen Pseudomonas fluorescens CY091 is regulated by Ca2+. In the presence of Ca2+, this bacterium constitutively synthesizes PL in media containing glucose, glycerol, or PGA and excretes over 87% of total PL into culture fluids. In the absence of Ca2+, the organism fails to use PGA as a carbon source and produces very low levels of PL in media containing glucose or glycerol. Of the small amount of PL produced by the bacterium in Ca(2+)-deficient media, over 78% was detected within the cells, indicating that Ca2+ is critical not only for the production but also for the secretion of PL. The pel gene, encoding an alkaline PL (pI 10.0, Mr 41,000) was cloned and located on the overlapping region of a 4.3-kb SalI and a 7.1-kb EcoRI fragment. The 7.1-kb EcoRI fragment appears to contain a promoter for pel gene expression. A 1.7-kb SalI-XhoI subfragment of the 4.3-kb SalI fragment was cloned into pUC18 to give pROTM2. Escherichia coli cells carrying pROTM2 produce 50 to 100 times more PL than do cells carrying other pectolytic constructs. Production of PL by E. coli (pROTM2) was not affected by carbon sources or by Ca2+. The pI and Mr of PL from E. coli corresponded to values for its counterpart from P. fluorescens. A 0.7-kb BglII-ClaI fragment encoding the pel structural sequence was used to detect pel homologs in various species of fluorescent pseudomonads. Homologous sequences were observed in 10 of 11 strains of P. fluorescens, P. viridiflava, and P. putida. The pel gene in fluorescent pseudomonads is well conserved and may exist and remain repressed in certain strains or species which exhibit nonpectolytic phenotypes under laboratory conditions.
TI  - Sequence of the gene (pheA) encoding phenol monooxygenase from Pseudomonas sp. EST1001: expression in Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - The plasmid pEST1412 contains the genes, pheA and pheB, encoding phenol monooxygenase (PMO) and catechol 1,2-dioxygenase (C12]), respectively. Thse were originally cloned from the plasmid DNA of Pseudomonas sp. EST1001 [Kivisaar et al., Plasmid 24 (1990) 25-36]. Although pheA and pheB are cotranscribed using the promoter sequences derived from Tn4652 and the level of expression of C120 activities from pEST1412 was equal both in Escherichia coli and in Pseudomonas putida, the level of PMO activity measured in the cell-free extracts of E. coli was lower than that in P. putida. The nucleotide sequence of the 2.0-kb PstI-HindIII fragment of pEST1412 carrying pheA was determined. A 1821-bp ORF was found in this DNA. The structural gene (tfdB) encoding 2,4-dichlorophenol hydroxylase from pJP4 has been sequenced [Perkins et al., J. Bacteriol. 172 (1990) 2351-2359]. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences of tfdB and pheA revealed highly conserved regions in the protein products of these genes.
TI  - Characterization of the Pseudomonas sp. strain P51 gene tcbR, a LysR-type transcriptional activator of the tcbCDEF chlorocatechol oxidative operon, and analysis of the regulatory region.
AB  - Plasmid pP51 of Pseudomonas sp. strain P51 contains two gene clusters encoding the degradation of chlorinated benzenes, tcbAB and tcbCDEF. A regulatory gene, tcbR, was located upstream and divergently transcribed from the chlorocatechol oxidative gene cluster tcbCDEF. The tcbR gene was characterized by DNA sequencing and expression studies with Escherichia coli and pET8c and appeared to encode a 32-kDa protein. The activity of the tcbR gene product was analyzed in Pseudomonas putida KT2442, in which it appeared to function as a positive regulator of tcbC expression. Protein extracts of both E. coli overproducing TcbR and Pseudomonas sp. strain P51 showed specific DNA binding to the 150-bp region that is located between the tcbR and tcbC genes. Primer extension mapping demonstrated that the transcription start sites of tcbR and tcbC are located in this region and that the divergent promoter sequences of both genes overlap. Amino acid sequence comparisons indicated that TcbR is a member of the LysR family of transcriptional activator proteins and shares a high degree of homology with other activator proteins involved in regulating the metabolism of aromatic compounds.
TI  - Up-promoter mutations in the trpBA operon of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - In Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the operon encoding tryptophan synthase (trpBA) is positively regulated by the TrpI protein and an intermediate in tryptophan biosynthesis, indoleglycerol phosphate (InGP). A gene fusion in which the trpBA promoter directs expression of the Pseudomonas putida xylE gene was constructed. By using a P. putida F1 todE mutant carrying this fusion on a plasmid, three cis-acting mutations that increased xylE expression enough to allow the todE strain to grow on toluene were isolated. The level of xylE transcript from the trpBA promoter was increased in all three mutants. All three mutations are base substitutions located in the -10 region of the trpBA promoter; two of these mutations make the promoter sequence more like the Escherichia coli RNA polymerase sigma 70 promoter consensus sequence. The activities of the wild-type and mutant trpBA promoters, as monitored by xylE expression, were assayed in P. putida PpG1 and in E. coli. The up-regulatory phenotypes of the mutants were maintained in the heterologous backgrounds, as was trpI and InGP dependence. These results indicate that the P. aeruginosa trpBA promoter has the key characteristics of a typical E. coli positively regulated promoter. The results also show that the P. aeruginosa and P. putida trpI activator gene products are functionally interchangeable.
TI  - Cloning and characterization of an extracellular temperature-labile serine protease gene from Aeromonas hydrophila.
AB  - Aeromonas virulence is thought to depend on multigenic functions. The gene for an extracellular protease from Aeromonas hydrophila SO2/2 was cloned in Escherichia coli C600-1 by using pIJ860, bifunctional plasmid, as a vector. The gene encodes for a temperature-labile serine protease (P2) with a molecular mass of approx. 68 kDa which is highly inhibited by PMSF. The gene was expressed in Streptomyces lividans 1326 by transforming protoplasts with the original clone pPA2. We were also able to transfer and express the prt P2 gene in Pseudomonas putida by mating experiments. The protein P2 was secreted into the periplasms of both P. putida and E. coli C600-1 being identical in properties to one of the proteases secreted into the culture supernatant by A. hydrophila SO2/2.
TI  - Anaerobic growth and cyanide synthesis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa depend on anr, a regulatory gene homologous with fnr of Escherichia coli.
AB  - Anaerobic growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa on nitrate or arginine requires the anr gene, which codes for a positive control element (ANR) capable of functionally complementing an fnr mutation in Escherichia coli. The anr gene was sequenced; it showed 51% identity with the fnr gene at the amino acid sequence level. Four cysteine residues known to be essential in the FNR protein are conserved in ANR. The anr gene product (deduced Mr 27,129) was visualized by the maxicell method and migrated like a 32 kDa protein in gel electrophoresis under denaturing conditions. An anr mutant of P. aeruginosa constructed by gene replacement was defective in nitrate respiration, arginine deiminase activity, and hydrogen cyanide biosynthesis, underscoring the diverse metabolic functions of ANR during oxygen limitation. Pseudomonas fluorescens, Pseudomonas putida, Pseudomonas syringae, and Pseudomonas mendocina all had a functional analogue of ANR, indicating that similar anaerobic control mechanisms exist in these bacteria.
TI  - Catechol 2,3-oxygenase production by genetically engineered Escherichia coli and  its application to catechol determination.
AB  - Catechol 2,3-oxygenase was produced by Escherichia coli, harbouring the recombinant plasmid pBH100 which contained the pheB gene cloned from phenol-degrading Pseudomonas putida BH, and was applied for the determination of catechol in the liquor. E. coli JM103 (pBH100) and C600 (pBH100) showed, respectively, about 5 and 8.5 times higher activities than that of P. putida BH. Using the crude extract prepared from the culture broth of the recombinant, catechol between 0.1 and 3.0 mug/ml could be determined quantitatively in phosphate buffer, synthetic sewage and in mixtures of phenol, benzoate and sallcylate, and also in sodium pyruvate solution. In addition to catechol, 3-methylcatechol, 4-methylcatechol and 4-chlorocatechol could be determined. Oxygenase activity of the crude extract was maintained completely during the 100-day storage at -20 degrees C after being freeze-dried with 10% acelone.
TI  - An upstream XylR- and IHF-induced nucleoprotein complex regulates the sigma 54-dependent Pu promoter of TOL plasmid.
AB  - Transcription from promoter Pu of the upper catabolic operon of the Pseudomonas putida TOL plasmid which specifies conversion of toluene/xylenes to benzoate/toluates is activated by the TOL-encoded regulator XylR protein in the presence of substrates of the catabolic pathway and in conjunction with the sigma 54(NtrA)-containing form of RNA polymerase. This regulatory circuit was faithfully reproduced in Escherichia coli in single copy gene dosage by integrating the corresponding controlling determinants into the chromosomes of several K12 derivatives by means of specialized transposons. In vivo monitoring of the activity of a Pu-lacZ fusion in E. coli strains with different genetic backgrounds demonstrated that integration host factor (IHF) is involved in Pu regulation and that hyperproduction of the XylR protein leads to a decrease of Pu activity in a manner in which deletion of the putative DNA-binding domain of the XylR does not impair its inhibitory effect when hyperproduced. One discrete IHF binding site and two potential XylR sites (consensus sequence 5'-TTGANCAAATC-3'), bracketted by short stretches of DNase I-hypersensitive bonds, were detected upstream of the transcription initiation site. A model accounting for the features found is proposed which includes the IHF-promoted looping of upstream XylR-DNA complexes so that they contact the sigma 54(NtrA)-RNA polymerase bound at -12/-24 positions.
TI  - Cloning and sequence analysis of the LPD-glc structural gene of Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - Pseudomonas putida is able to produce three lipoamide dehydrogenases: (i) LPD-glc, which is the E3 component of the pyruvate and 2-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complexes and the L-factor for the glycine oxidation system; (ii) LPD-val, which is the specific E3 component of the branched-chain keto acid dehydrogenase complex and is induced by growth on leucine, isoleucine, or valine; and (iii) LPD-3, which was discovered in a lpdG mutant and whose role is unknown. Southern hybridization with an oligonucleotide probe encoding the highly conserved redox-active site produced three bands corresponding to the genes encoding these three lipoamide dehydrogenases. The complete structural gene for LPD-glc, lpdG, was isolated, and its nucleotide sequence was determined. The latter consists of 476 codons plus a stop codon, TAA. The structural gene for LPD-glc is preceded by a partial open reading frame with strong similarity to the E2 component of 2-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase of Escherichia coli. This suggests that lpdG is part of the 2-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase operon. LPD-glc was expressed in Pseudomonas putida JS348 from pHP4 which contains a partial open reading frame corresponding to the E2 component, 94 bases of noncoding DNA, and the structural gene for lpdG. This result indicates that lpdG can be expressed separately from the other genes of the operon.
TI  - Expression, localization, and functional analysis of polychlorinated biphenyl degradation genes cbpABCD of Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - Genes of Pseudomonas putida strains that are capable of degrading polychlorinated biphenyls were cloned in the plasmid vector pUC19. The resultant hybrid plasmid, pAW6194, contained cbpABCD genes on a 9.0-kb DNA fragment that was necessary for the catabolism of polychlorinated biphenyls. These genes were further subcloned on an 8.0-kb HindIII fragment of pAW540. Degradation of 3-chlorobiphenyl, 2,4-dichlorobiphenyl, and 2,4,5-trichlorobiphenyl into a chloro derivative of benzoic acid was found in Escherichia coli harboring chimeric plasmid pAW540. Expression of cbpA (biphenyl dioxygenase, 6.2 U/mg of protein) and cbpC (3-phenylcatechol dioxygenase, 611.00 U/mg of protein) genes was also found in E. coli containing the hybrid plasmid pAW540. These enzyme activities were up to 10-fold higher than those found in P. putida OU83. These results led us to conclude that cbpABCD genes of P. putida OU83 were encoded on cloned DNA and expressed in E. coli. Whether the expression of cbpABCD genes of P. putida OU83 was driven by its own promoters located on the cloned DNA or by the lacZ promoter of pUC19 was examined by subcloning a 8.0-kb DNA fragment encoding the cbpABCD genes, in both orientations, in the HindIII site of the promoter probe vector pKK232-8. The resulting recombinant plasmids, pAW560 and pAW561, expressed cbpABCD genes and conferred chloramphenicol resistance only in E. coli harboring pAW560, indicating that the expression of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase is independent of cbpABCD gene expression.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Broad host-range vector for efficient expression of foreign genes in gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - A broad host-range expression plasmid was constructed comprising the incQ replicon, the recA promoter from Escherichia coli and the g10-L ribosome binding site (RBS) derived from bacteriophage T7. The structural genes for porcine somatotropin (pst) and E. coli beta-galactosidase (lacZ) were used to monitor gene expression in a diverse collection of Gram-negative bacterial hosts: Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas syringae, Pseudomonas putida, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Pseudomonas testosteroni, Serratia marcescens and Erwinia herbicola. The E. coli recA promoter was functional in this wide range of hosts and was inducible by the addition of nalidixic acid. Moreover, the level of lacZ expression was often at least as high as that observed in E. coli. Previous studies had shown that the g10-L RBS was superior to a simple "consensus" RBS sequence for expression of foreign genes in E. coli. Here we demonstrate a 38 to 70 fold increase in expression in two Pseudomonas hosts using the g10-L RBS, indicating that the translational enhancer present in the g10-L RBS is also functional in other bacteria. The juxtaposition of these transcriptional and translational elements in a broad host-range vector provides a simple way to evaluate alternate hosts for recombinant protein production.
TI  - A new family of bacterial regulatory proteins.
AB  - A new family of bacterial regulatory proteins has been identified by sequence similarity. The family contains the repressor of the Bacillus subtilis gluconate operon (GntR), the regulators for histidine utilization in Pseudomonas putida (HutCPp) and Klebsiella aerogenes (HutCKa), the repressor (FadR) of fatty acid degradation in Escherichia coli, a regulator involved in the conjugal transfer of the broad host range plasmid pIJ101 (KorA), and three proteins of unidentified function in E. coli (GenA, P30 and PhnF). The proteins share amino acid sequence similarities in a 69-residue N-terminal region. A helix-turn-helix motif is predicted in the most highly-conserved segment of each protein suggesting that they are members of a new family of helix-turn-helix DNA-binding proteins.
TI  - Sequence analysis of the Pseudomonas sp. strain P51 tcb gene cluster, which encodes metabolism of chlorinated catechols: evidence for specialization of catechol 1,2-dioxygenases for chlorinated substrates.
AB  - Pseudomonas sp. strain P51 contains two gene clusters located on catabolic plasmid pP51 that encode the degradation of chlorinated benzenes. The nucleotide sequence of a 5,499-bp region containing the chlorocatechol-oxidative gene cluster tcbCDEF was determined. The sequence contained five large open reading frames, which were all colinear. The functionality of these open reading frames was studied with various Escherichia coli expression systems and by analysis of enzyme activities. The first gene, tcbC, encodes a 27.5-kDa protein with chlorocatechol 1,2-dioxygenase activity. The tcbC gene is followed by tcbD, which encodes cycloisomerase II (39.5 kDa); a large open reading frame (ORF3) with an unknown function; tcbE, which encodes hydrolase II (25.8 kDa); and tcbF, which encodes a putative trans-dienelactone isomerase (37.5 kDa). The tcbCDEF gene cluster showed strong DNA homology (between 57.6 and 72.1% identity) and an organization similar to that of other known plasmid-encoded operons for chlorocatechol metabolism, e.g., clcABD of Pseudomonas putida and tfdCDEF of Alcaligenes eutrophus JMP134. The identity between amino acid sequences of functionally related enzymes of the three operons varied between 50.6 and 75.7%, with the tcbCDEF and tfdCDEF pair being the least similar of the three. Measurements of the specific activities of chlorocatechol 1,2-dioxygenases encoded by tcbC, clcA, and tfdC suggested that a specialization among type II enzymes has taken place. TcbC preferentially converts 3,4-dichlorocatechol relative to other chlorinated catechols, whereas TfdC has a higher activity toward 3,5-dichlorocatechol. ClcA takes an intermediate position, with the highest activity level for 3-chlorocatechol and the second-highest level for 3,5-dichlorocatechol.
TI  - [Cloning of the Arthrobacter globiformis fcbA gene for dehalogenase and construction of a hybrid pathway of 4-chlorobenzoic acid degradation in Pseudomonas putida].
AB  - The Artrobacter globiformis KZT1 fcbA gene responsible for dehalogenase (4-chlorobenzoate-4-hydroxylase) activity was cloned in Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida cells. The character of the fcbA gene expression was studied. Notwithstanding amplification of the gene dose and control of the inducible Plac promoter, the level of substrate dehalogenation by recombinant E. coli strains was lower, as compared with that in the original KZT1 strain. Cloning of the fcbA gene in P. putida KZ6R cells utilizing 4HBA resulted in a recombinant pathway of 4CBA degradation, which proved more effective for substrate consumption, in comparison with the original KZT1 strain.
TI  - Freeze-substitution of gram-negative eubacteria: general cell morphology and envelope profiles.
AB  - Freeze-substitution was performed on strains of Escherichia coli, Pasteurella multocida, Campylobacter fetus, Vibrio cholerae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas putida, Aeromonas salmonicida, Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus pleuropneumoniae, Caulobacter crescentus, and Leptothrix discophora with a substitution medium composed of 2% osmium tetroxide and 2% uranyl acetate in anhydrous acetone. A thick periplasmic gel ranging from 10.6 to 14.3 nm in width was displayed in E. coli K-12, K30, and His 1 (a K-12 derivative containing the K30 capsule genes), P. multocida, C. fetus, P. putida, A. salmonicida, H. pleuropneumoniae, and P. mirabilis. The other bacteria possessed translucent periplasms in which a thinner peptidoglycan layer was seen. Capsular polysaccharide, evident as electron-dense fibers radiating outward perpendicular to the cell surface, was observed on E. coli K30 and His 1 and P. mirabilis cells. A more random arrangement of fibers forming a netlike structure was apparent surrounding cells of H. pleuropneumoniae. For the first time a capsule, distinct from the sheath, was observed on L. discophora. In all instances, capsular polysaccharide was visualized in the absence of stabilizing agents such as homologous antisera or ruthenium red. Other distinct envelope structures were observed external to the outer membrane including the sheath of L. discophora and the S layers of A. salmonicida A450 and C. crescentus CB15A. We believe that the freeze-substitution technique presents a more accurate image of the structural organization of these cells and that it has revealed complex ultrastructural relationships between cell envelope constituents previously difficult to visualize by more conventional means of preparation.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of Microgard against food spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms.
AB  - Microgard, a commercially available fermented milk product containing antimicrobial metabolites, was a potent inhibitor for Gram-negative bacteria such as Pseudomonas, Salmonella, and Yersinia when 1% concentration was incorporated into agar media. Gram-positive Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Listeria monocytogenes were insensitive to Microgard. Kluyveromyces marxianus, an unidentified black yeast, and Penicillium expansum were partially suppressed, whereas Aspergillus niger and a yogurt spoilage yeast were tolerant to 5% Microgard. Optimum activity of Microgard was at pH 5.3 and below; the concentration that gave complete inhibition depended upon the number of bacteria present as well as the genus tested. Blood agar base reversed the antagonistic activity of Microgard against Pseudomonas putida compared with plate count agar.
TI  - The ferric-pseudobactin receptor PupA of Pseudomonas putida WCS358: homology to TonB-dependent Escherichia coli receptors and specificity of the protein.
AB  - The initial step in the uptake of iron via ferric pseudobactin by the plant-growth-promoting Pseudomonas putida strain WCS358 is binding to a specific outer-membrane protein. The nucleotide sequence of the pupA structural gene, which codes for a ferric pseudobactin receptor, was determined. It contains a single open reading frame which potentially encodes a polypeptide of 819 amino acids, including a putative N-terminal signal sequence of 47 amino acids. Significant homology, concentrated in four boxes, was found with the TonB-dependent receptor proteins of Escherichia coli. The pupA mutant MH100 showed a residual efficiency of 30% in the uptake of 55Fe3+ complexed to pseudobactin 358, whereas the iron uptake of four other pseudobactins was not reduced at all. Cells of strain WCS374 supplemented with the pupA gene of strain WCS358 could transport ferric pseudobactin 358 but showed no affinity for three other pseudobactins. It is concluded that PupA is a specific receptor for ferric pseudobactin 358, and that strain WCS358 produces at least one other receptor for other pseudobactins.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence analysis of the Pseudomonas putida PpG7 salicylate hydroxylase gene (nahG) and its 3'-flanking region.
AB  - Gene nahG of naphthalene/salicylate catabolic plasmid NAH7 encodes a protein of molecular weight 45,000, salicylate hydroxylase. This enzyme catalyzes the formation of catechol from salicylate, a key intermediate in naphthalene catabolism. DNA sequence analysis of the 3.1-kilobase HindIII fragment containing the nahG locus reveals an open reading frame (ORF) of 1305 base pairs that corresponds to a protein of 434 amino acid residues. The predicted amino acid sequence of salicylate hydroxylase is in agreement with the molecular weight, NH2-terminal amino acid sequence, and total amino acid composition of the purified salicylate hydroxylase [You, I.-S., Murray, R. I., Jollie, D., & Gunsalus, I. C. (1990) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 169, 1049-1054]. The amino acid sequence between positions 8 and 37 of salicylate hydroxylase shows homology with known ADP binding sites of other FAD-containing oxidoreductases, thus confirming its biochemical function. The sequence of the Pseudomonas putida salicylate hydroxylase was compared with those of other similar flavoproteins. A small DNA segment (831 base pairs) disrupts the continuity of the known gene order nahG and nahH, the latter encoding catechol 2,3-dioxygenase. The complete nucleotide sequence of the intergenic region spanning genes nahG and nahH has been determined and its biological role proposed.
TI  - A series of wide-host-range low-copy-number vectors that allow direct screening for recombinants.
AB  - A series of controlled expression vectors was constructed based on the wide-host-range plasmid pMMB66EH. Some of these new vectors code for the alpha-peptide of beta-galactosidase and allow the direct screening of recombinant clones by inactivation of alpha-complementation. The bla gene was replaced in some plasmids by the cat gene of Tn9 coding for chloramphenicol resistance, extending the use into beta-lactam-resistant strains. They all feature either the tac or taclac (tac-lac UV5 in tandem) promoters in front of a polylinker followed by the rrnB transcriptional stop point. These vectors were tested by subcloning the xylE gene coding for the Pseudomonas putida catechol 2,3-oxygenase and the Escherichia coli lamB gene coding for the lambda receptor. The expression of these genes in E. coli indicated that the tac promoter is five times stronger than the taclac promoter and that both were tightly regulated. The tac promoter in Pseudomonas syringae pv glycinea and Xanthomonas campestris pv vesicatoria had a strength similar to that in E. coli, while the taclac promoter was much weaker, reaching only 6.5 and 3% of the level of expression of the tac promoter, respectively. The taclac promoter, however, proved to be useful for the cloning in E. coli of DNA fragments that were unstable in vectors with stronger promoters and higher copy number. Expression of the lamB gene in Vibrio cholerae strain TRH7000 was not sufficient to permit cosmid transduction. Two subunits of the E. coli mannose permease, coded by the ptsP and ptsM genes, are also required for cosmid DNA penetration into the recipient cells.
TI  - Molecular characterization and expression analysis of the anthranilate synthase gene of Pseudomonas syringae subsp. savastanoi.
AB  - The trpE gene, which encodes the large component of the enzyme anthranilate synthase, was isolated from a Pseudomonas syringae subsp. savastanoi (P. savastanoi) cosmid library. Cosmids that complemented an Escherichia coli trpE mutation contained a gene whose product is 86% homologous at the deduced amino acid level to TrpE of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas putida. Amino acid sequence comparison with other TrpE sequences revealed the existence of conserved regions between the procaryotic and eucaryotic polypeptide sequences analyzed, regions that might be of functional importance. We also report on studies on the expression pattern of this gene. We analyzed the promoter activity of a trpE::lacZ transcriptional fusion, the relative amount of trpE steady-state mRNA, and the activity of anthranilate synthase from cells grown in minimal medium with or without exogenously added tryptophan and in complete medium. We concluded that under the conditions tested, expression of the trpE gene of P. savastanoi is independent of the concentration of tryptophan in the culture medium. Implications of such an expression pattern on the virulence of this bacterium are discussed.
TI  - Cloning and characterization of plasmid-encoded genes for the degradation of 1,2-dichloro-, 1,4-dichloro-, and 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene of Pseudomonas sp. strain P51.
AB  - Pseudomonas sp. strain P51 is able to use 1,2-dichlorobenzene, 1,4-dichlorobenzene, and 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene as sole carbon and energy sources. Two gene clusters involved in the degradation of these compounds were identified on a catabolic plasmid, pP51, with a size of 110 kb by using hybridization. They were further characterized by cloning in Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas putida KT2442, and Alcaligenes eutrophus JMP222. Expression studies in these organisms showed that the upper-pathway genes (tcbA and tcbB) code for the conversion of 1,2-dichlorobenzene and 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene to 3,4-dichlorocatechol and 3,4,6-trichlorocatechol, respectively, by means of a dioxygenase system and a dehydrogenase. The lower-pathway genes have the order tcbC-tcbD-tcbE and encode a catechol 1,2-dioxygenase II, a cycloisomerase II, and a hydrolase II, respectively. The combined action of these enzymes degrades 3,4-dichlorocatechol and 3,4,6-trichlorocatechol to a chloromaleylacetic acid. The release of one chlorine atom from 3,4-dichlorocatechol takes place during lactonization of 2,3-dichloromuconic acid.
TI  - [Quantitation of Acinetobacter calcoaceticus in mixed bacterial cultures by an enzyme immunoassay].
AB  - An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using polyclonal antibodies from rabbits has been developed for quantification of Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. Bacteria were added to the wells of a microtiter plate coated with anti-Acinetobacter immunoglobulin. For detecting bound cells the peroxidase-labelled immunoglobulin fraction was used. Over a distinct range there is a linear correlation between bound bacteria and measured absorbance allowing a quantification of bacteria in an order from 10(7) to 10(8) per milliliter. The specificity of the assay was evaluated by the heterologous bacteria Pseudomonas putida, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus vulgaris, Escherichia coli and Citrobacter freundii. Only a minimal cross-reactivity was observed. Within a certain range of error it is possible to quantitate Acinetobacter calcoaceticus in mixtures with one or several other bacterial species. Mixed with bacteria of one other species the differences to the value for Acinetobacter calcoaceticus alone do not exceed +/- 10% with a tendency to lower values. Mixed with several other species only negative differences up to -15% were obtained. Treatment of Acinetobacter calcoaceticus with 0.5% formaldehyde results in a loss of reactivity up to 15%. In conclusion, the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay is a useful method for quantitating bacteria not only with respect to the high sensitivity, specificity and good reproducibility but also for the minimal technical equipment and the short assay time.
TI  - The role of microorganisms in psoriasis.
AB  - The microflora of 297 psoriasis patients was extensively examined. Throat, urine, and skin surfaces from scalp, ears, chest, face, axillary, submammary, umbilical, upper back, inguinal crease, gluteal-fold, perirectal, vaginal, pubis, penis, scrotal, leg, hands, feet, finger, and toenail areas were cultured for aerobic bacteria, yeast, and dermatophytes. Antibody levels to streptococcal enzymes were performed (streptolysin-O, DNAse-B, hyaluronidase, STREPTOZYME). Giemsa smears and KOH preparations were also used to determine yeast and dermatophyte presence. Associated organisms thought to provoke a psoriatic attack were as follows: streptococcal groups A, B, C, D, F, G, S viridans, S pneumoniae; Klebsiella pneumoniae, oxytoca; Escherichia coli; Enterobacter cloacae, E aerogenes, E agglomerans; Proteus mirabilis, P vulgaris; Citrobacter freundii, C diversus; Morganella morganii; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P maltiphilia, P putida; Serratia marcescens; Acinetobacter calbio aceticus, A luoffi; Flavobacterium specie; CDC groups Ve-1, Ve-2, E-o2; Bacillus subtilis, cereus; Staphylococcus aureus; Candida albicans, C parapsilosis; Torulopsis, glabrata; Rhodotorula and dermatophytes. One or more antistreptococal enzyme tests was positive in 50% of patients. Titers to hepatitis E were elevated in one patient and to HIV in two patients.
TI  - Growth-phase-dependent expression of the Pseudomonas putida TOL plasmid pWW0 catabolic genes.
AB  - Pseudomonas putida TOL plasmid pWW0 catabolic genes are clustered into two operons. The first, the upper operon, is controlled by the xylR regulatory gene, whereas the second, the meta operon, is controlled by the xylS regulatory gene. The xylS gene itself is subjected to control by xylR. In this study, we show that the TOL catabolic operons were poorly induced in cells growing at the early-exponential-growth phase but strongly induced in cells at late-exponential-growth phase. We constructed fusions of four TOL promoters, Pm (the promoter of the meta operon), Pu (the promoter of the upper operon), Ps (the promoter of the xylS regulatory gene), and Pr (the promoter of the xylR regulatory gene) with lacZ and examined, in Escherichia coli and P. putida, the expression of these promoters in relation to the growth phase. Expression from Pm, Pu, Ps, and Pr was almost constant if the host cells did not carry either xylS or xylR. Similarly, expression of Pm and Pu in P. putida in the absence of XylS and XylR was constant during the growth of the cells. XylS-dependent transcription of Pm and XylR-dependent transcription of Ps and Pu, in contrast, varied with the growth phase. This observation suggested that the interaction of XylS and XylR with target promoters or with RNA polymerases was influenced by the growth phase. The nature of the signal which triggers the growth-phase-dependent regulation was not clear. A change in the oxygen partial pressure was not responsible for the regulation. E. coli mutants defective in relA, crp, and cya exhibited growth-phase-dependent expression of the TOL catabolic genes, indicating that cyclic AMP and relA-dependent synthesis of ppGpp are not involved in this phenomenon.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence and expression of the isoamylase gene from an isoamylase-hyperproducing mutant, Pseudomonas amyloderamosa JD210.
AB  - The isoamylase gene (ISO) of Pseudomonas amyloderamosa JD210, an isoamylase-hyperproducing mutant, was cloned in an isoamylase-deficient and transformable mutant strain K31. By deletion analysis, the ISO gene was found to be located within a 3.3 kilobases BamHI fragment. Its nucleotide sequence contained an open reading frame of 2328 nucleotides (776 amino acids) encoding a secreted isoamylase precursor. The ISO gene fragment was inserted into plasmids pKT230 and pBR 322 in opposite orientations. The expression of the ISO gene in the constructed plasmids was compared in P. amyloderamosa K31, Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1-161, Pseudomonas putida mt-2 and Escherichia coli HB101. In all transformed cells, the majority of the isoamylase produced was secreted and higher isoamylase activities were obtained in transformats with the transcriptional direction of the ISO gene similar to the nearby drug-determinant gene of the vector.
TI  - Upstream regulatory sequence for transcriptional activator XylR in the first operon of xylene metabolism on the TOL plasmid.
AB  - Transcription of the first operon coding for m-xylene-degrading enzymes on the TOL plasmid of Pseudomonas putida is activated by the xylR gene product in the presence of m-xylene. The operon has the consensus sequence of the ntr/nif promoters at -24 and -12 regions, and the transcription is dependent on an RNA polymerase containing a sigma factor NtrA (RpoN or sigma 54). Deletion derivatives of the upstream sequence of the operon promoter were made in vitro and connected with the xylE gene on a plasmid. Their promoter activities were analyzed in Escherichia coli by monitoring catechol 2,3-dioxygenase activity, the xylE gene product. A cis-acting DNA element was identified, which is required for activation of the operon promoter by XylR protein in the presence of the inducer. This regulatory sequence of about 40 base-pairs in length was located 150 base-pairs upstream from the transcription start site. Analysis of the mutants containing insertions between the upstream regulatory sequence and the promoter sequence demonstrated strong dependence of the activation upon helical periodicity of DNA. The regulatory sequence functioned in the inverse orientation or at a distance of more than 1 x 10(3) base-pairs upstream from the promoter though less efficient. These results indicated that this upstream regulatory sequence might be the binding site for XylR protein. DNA-loop formation through protein-protein interaction between XylR protein attached to the upstream sequence and the NtrA-containing RNA polymerase bound by the promoter sequence was suggested for activation of the operon transcription. A sequence similar to the regulatory sequence of the first operon of xylene metabolism was found in the upstream region of the xylS gene, which is also activated by XylR protein in the presence of m-xylene.
TI  - Transposon vectors containing non-antibiotic resistance selection markers for cloning and stable chromosomal insertion of foreign genes in gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - A simple procedure for cloning and stable insertion of foreign genes into the chromosomes of gram-negative eubacteria was developed by combining in two sets of plasmids (i) the transposition features of Tn10 and Tn5; (ii) the resistances to the herbicide bialaphos, to mercuric salts and organomercurial compounds, and to arsenite, and (iii) the suicide delivery properties of the R6K-based plasmid pGP704. The resulting constructions contained unique NotI or SfiI sites internal to either the Tn10 or the Tn5 inverted repeats. These sites were readily used for cloning DNA fragments with the help of two additional specialized cloning plasmids, pUC18Not and pUC18Sfi. The newly derived constructions could be maintained only in donor host strains that produce the R6K-specified pi protein, which is an essential replication protein for R6K and plasmids derived therefrom. Donor plasmids containing hybrid transposons were transformed into a specialized lambda pir lysogenic Escherichia coli strain with a chromosomally integrated RP4 that provided broad-host-range conjugal transfer functions. Delivery of the donor plasmids into selected host bacteria was accomplished through mating with the target strain. Transposition of the hybrid transposon from the delivered suicide plasmid to a replicon in the target cell was mediated by the cognate transposase encoded on the plasmid at a site external to the transposon. Since the transposase function was not maintained in target cells, such cells were not immune to further transposition rounds. Multiple insertions in the same strain are therefore only limited by the availability of distinct selection markers. The utility of the system was demonstrated with a kanamycin resistance gene as a model foreign insert into Pseudomonas putida and a melanin gene from Streptomyces antibioticus into Klebsiella pneumoniae. Because of the modular nature of the functional parts of the cloning vectors, they can be easily modified and further selection markers can be incorporated. The cloning system described here will be particularly useful for the construction of hybrid bacteria that stably maintain inserted genes, perhaps in competitive situations (e.g., in open systems and natural environments), and that do not carry antibiotic resistance markers characteristic of most available cloning vectors (as is currently required of live bacterial vaccines).
TI  - Genetic analysis of chromosomal operons involved in degradation of aromatic hydrocarbons in Pseudomonas putida TMB.
AB  - The catabolic pathway for the degradation of aromatic hydrocarbons encoded by Pseudomonas putida TMB differs from the TOL plasmid-encoded pathway as far as regulation of the upper pathway is concerned. We found, by analyzing Tn5-induced mutants and by Southern blot hybridization with appropriate probes derived from the TOL plasmid pWW0, that the catabolic genes of strain TMB were located on the bacterial chromosome and not on the 84-kb plasmid harbored by this strain. The catabolic genes of TMB and pWW0 had sequence homology, as shown by Southern blot hybridization, but differed significantly in their restriction patterns. The analysis of the mutants suggests that a regulatory mechanism similar to that present in pWW0 coexists in TMB with a second mode of regulation which is epistatic on the former and that the chromosomal region carrying the catabolic genes is prone to rearrangements and deletions.
TI  - Cloning and expression of the plasmid-encoded benzene dioxygenase genes from Pseudomonas putida ML2.
AB  - Hybridization using heterologous dioxygenase gene probes indicated the presence of the genes encoding the enzyme benzene dioxygenase on a 112 kb plasmid from Pseudomonas putida ML2. They were identified as benzene dioxygenase genes (bed ABC1C2) by cloning in Escherichia coli and analysis of expression by Western blotting using antibodies raised to the four polypeptides of purified benzene dioxygenase.
TI  - Immobilized and free cell continuous cultures of a recombinant E. coli producing  catechol 2,3-dioxygenase in a two-stage chemostat: improvement of plasmid stability.
AB  - The immobilization of recombinant strains of E. coli W3110/pTG205 in K-carrageenan gel beads improves the plasmid stability during continuous cultures in the absence of selection pressure. Since, xyl E gene (which encodes catechol 2,3-dioxygenase from Pseudomonas putida) transcription is controlled by the trp promoter, the effects of tryptophan (repressor) and 3 beta-indolyl acrylic acid (derepressor) on pTG 205 stability and enzyme production have been studied in both free and immobilized cell cultures. A two-stage continuous culture system running for 150 h is described. In the first stage an immobilized culture is performed in the presence of tryptophan with a significant plasmid stability. The cells released from the gel beads are continuously transferred in the second stage reactor where expression is induced by 3 beta-indolyl acrylic acid. In these conditions an efficient production of catechol 2,3-dioxygenase is observed.
TI  - Mandelate pathway of Pseudomonas putida: sequence relationships involving mandelate racemase, (S)-mandelate dehydrogenase, and benzoylformate decarboxylase and expression of benzoylformate decarboxylase in Escherichia coli.
AB  - The genes that encode the five known enzymes of the mandelate pathway of Pseudomonas putida (ATCC 12633), mandelate racemase (mdlA), (S)-mandelate dehydrogenase (mdlB), benzoylformate decarboxylase (mdlC), NAD(+)-dependent benzaldehyde dehydrogenase (mdlD), and NADP(+)-dependent benzaldehyde dehydrogenase (mdlE), have been cloned. The genes for (S)-mandelate dehydrogenase and benzoylformate decarboxylase have been sequenced; these genes and that for mandelate racemase [Ransom, S. C., Gerlt, J. A., Powers, V. M., & Kenyon, G. L. (1988) Biochemistry 27, 540] are organized in an operon (mdlCBA). Mandelate racemase has regions of sequence similarity to muconate lactonizing enzymes I and II from P. putida. (S)-Mandelate dehydrogenase is predicted to be 393 amino acids in length and to have a molecular weight of 43,352; it has regions of sequence similarity to glycolate oxidase from spinach and ferricytochrome b2 lactate dehydrogenase from yeast. Benzoylformate decarboxylase is predicted to be 499 amino acids in length and to have a molecular weight of 53,621; it has regions of sequence similarity to enzymes that decarboxylate pyruvate with thiamin pyrophosphate as cofactor. These observations support the hypothesis that the mandelate pathway evolved by recruitment of enzymes from preexisting metabolic pathways. The gene for benzoylformate decarboxylase has been expressed in Escherichia coli with the trc promoter, and homogeneous enzyme has been isolated from induced cells.
TI  - [Cloning genes for biosynthesis of Pseudomonas putida tryptophan in Escherichia coli cells].
AB  - The trpE, trpC and trpIBA genes of Pseudomonas putida were cloned by complementation of the corresponding auxotrophic mutations of Escherichia coli using pBR322 as a vector. With the exception of trpE, transcription of all genes in new host takes place under control of their own promoters. Expression of the trpD gene linked to trpC was not registered in E. coli. Repressible trpC enzyme was synthesized constitutively in E. coli. Characteristic regulation of P. putida trpBA genes via induction by indolglycerol phosphate is retained in E. coli. The activator gene trpI and tryptophan synthase genes were closely linked in the trpIBA sequence.
TI  - Transcriptional analysis of the promoter region of the Pseudomonas putida branched-chain keto acid dehydrogenase operon.
AB  - Branched-chain keto acid dehydrogenase is a multienzyme complex produced by Pseudomonas putida when it is grown in a minimal medium containing branched-chain amino acids. A 1.87-kilobase (kb) DNA fragment was cloned and sequenced which contained 0.24 kb of the E1 alpha structural gene and 1.6 kb of upstream DNA. There were 854 base pairs (bp) of noncoding DNA upstream of bkdA1, the first gene of the bkd operon, and 592 bp between the transcriptional and translational starts. The G + C content of the noncoding region was 56.7% compared with 65.2% for all the structural genes of the operon. A partial open reading frame was found on the strand opposite that of the bkd operon beginning at base 774. When the bkd promoter was cloned into the promoter probe vector pKT240, streptomycin resistance was obtained in P. putida but not Escherichia coli with the promoter in both orientations, which indicates either that the bkd promoter is bidirectional or that there are two promoters in this region. A series of ordered deletions on both sides of the proposed site of the start of transcription revealed that almost 700 bp upstream of the start of translation were required for expression. Streptomycin resistance was also obtained in an rpoN mutant of P. putida KT2440 containing constructs with the intact bkd promoter, indicating that the bkd operon does not require the rpoN sigma factor for expression. Another construct containing the bkd promoter, bkdA1, and bkdA2 in pKT240 was used to transform P. putida JS113, a mutant which was unable to produce the E1 subunits of the branched-chain keto acid dehydrogenase. In this case, very high inducible expression of the bkd operon was obtained.
TI  - Sequence and analysis of the rpoN sigma factor gene of rhizobium sp. strain NGR234, a primary coregulator of symbiosis.
AB  - We report the nucleotide sequence of the rpoN gene from broad-host-range Rhizobium sp. strain NGR234 and analyze the encoded RPON protein, a sigma factor. Comparative analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence of RPON from NGR234 with sequences from other gram-negative bacteria identified a perfectly conserved RPON box unique to RPON sigma factors. Symbiotic regulatory phenotypes were defined for a site-directed internal deletion within the coding sequence of the rpoN gene of Rhizobium strain NGR234: they included quantitative nodulation kinetics on Vigna unguiculata and microscopic analysis of the Fix- determinate nodules of V. unguiculata and Macroptilium atropurpureum. RPON was a primary coregulator of nodulation and was implicated in establishment or maintenance of the plant-synthesized peribacteroid membrane. Phenotypes of rpoN in Rhizobium strain NGR234 could be grouped as symbiosis related, rather than simply pleiotropically physiological as in free-living bacteria such as Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas putida.
TI  - [Studies on respiratory infections in primary care clinic (III). Distribution of  bacteria isolated from patients with respiratory infections visiting 21 private clinics in the Tohoku District of Japan].
AB  - The bacteriology of the isolates from the throat swab and the sputum respectively of 2,539 patients with respiratory infections visiting 21 private clinics in Tohoku district of Japan during the period from January to April in 1989 was documented. Of the 2,539 patients, 1,694 had an acute upper respiratory infection, 609 had acute bronchitis, 46 had acute pneumonia, 84 had acute exacerbation of chronic respiratory infections and 106 had respiratory infections without diagnosis registered. 1887 (74.3%) strains of potential pathogens were recovered from 1507 (59.4%) of the 2539 cases. The rate of recovery of potential pathogens was very high in patients of the younger age. These patients had elevated body-temperature. There were statistically significant differences in recovery rate when classified by diagnosis, prefecture and the period of investigation. Of the 1,887 strains, 996 (52.8%) were gram-positive and 891 (47.2%) were gram-negative bacteria. The rate of recovery of gram-negative bacteria was high in patients who were less than 10 years old and more than 51 years old, in patients with pneumonia and chronic respiratory infections, and in patients with fever. Of the 1,887 strains, those which exceeded 100 were Staphylococcus aureus (481 strains), Haemophilus influenzae (340 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (329 strains), Streptococcus pyogenes (117 strains) and Acinetobacter spp. (100 strains). Species other than those mentioned above had less than 100 strains. In this group there were 39 strains of Branhamella catarrhalis, 32 strains of Escherichia coli, 97 strains of Klebsiella spp., 40 strains of Enterobacter spp., 25 strains of Serratia spp., 12 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 43 strains of Pseudomonas putida. There was a remarkable difference in recovery rate of each species when classified by diagnosis, age class, prefecture and the period of investigation, respectively. The above results indicated that gram-positive bacteria are more frequent than gram-negative bacteria, that enterobacteriaceae and glucose-non-fermentative gram-negative bacteria are only rarely found in primary care clinics, and that the bacteriology in primary care clinic is different from that of medical school-affiliated hospitals.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence of the gene encoding the repressor for the histidine utilization genes of Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - The hutC gene of Pseudomonas putida encodes a repressor which, in combination with the inducer urocanate, regulates expression of the five structural genes necessary for conversion of histidine to glutamate, ammonia, and formate. The nucleotide sequence of the hutC region was determined and found to contain two open reading frames which overlapped by one nucleotide. The first open reading frame (ORF1) appeared to encode a 27,648-dalton protein of 248 amino acids whose sequence strongly resembled that of the hut repressor of Klebsiella aerogenes (A. Schwacha and R. A. Bender, J. Bacteriol. 172:5477-5481, 1990) and contained a helix-turn-helix motif that could be involved in operator binding. The gene was preceded by a sequence which was nearly identical to that of the operator site located upstream of hutU which controls transcription of the hutUHIG genes. The operator near hutC would presumably allow the hut repressor to regulate its own synthesis as well as the expression of the divergent hutF gene. A second open reading frame (ORF2) would encode a 21,155-dalton protein, but because this region could be deleted with only a slight effect on repressor activity, it is not likely to be involved in repressor function or structure.
TI  - Structure of the dnaA region of Micrococcus luteus: conservation and variations among eubacteria.
AB  - A phylogenetic tree constructed by 5S rRNA analysis is composed of three major branches in eubacteria: high G + C Gram+, low G + C Gram+ and Gram- [Hori and Osawa, Mol. Biol. Evol. 4 (1987) 445-472]. We have shown that the characteristic dnaA region is common among Escherichia coli (Gram-), Pseudomonas putida (Gram-), and Bacillus subtilis (low G + C Gram+). We have now determined the structure of the dnaA region of Micrococcus luteus, as a representative of the last branch, high G + C Gram+. The dnaA gene and at least three other genes, rnpA, rpmH and dnaN were found to be conserved in M. luteus. Large nontranslatable regions were found flanking the dnaA gene. The upstream region is conserved in the four bacteria so far examined. On the other hand, the downstream region is conserved only in Gram+ bacteria, M. luteus and B. subtilis. The consensus sequence of the DnaA box in M. luteus seems to be TTGTCCACA, in contrast to TTATCCACA of other bacteria. These results confirm our hypothesis that the dnaA region is the replication origin of the ancestral bacteria and that the essential feature of the DnaA protein and DnaA-box combination is conserved in eubacteria.
TI  - [Identification and classification of 204 strains of gram negative organisms isolated from poultry eggs].
AB  - Results of identification and classification of 204 strains of Gram negative bacteria isolated from poultry eggs are reported. Among 106 strains of glucose nonfermenting bacteria 105 (99%) strains could be further identified as: pseudomonas (87 strains), including P. fluorescens (63), P. putida (9), P. maltophilia (12), P. putrefaciens (2), and P. stutzeri (1); 2 strains of Alcaligenes, both identified as A. denitrificans; 7 strains of Flavobacterium, including F. multovorum (3) and Flavobacterium sp. (4); and 9 strains of Acinetobacter, including A. lwoffi (7) and A. anitratus (2). Among 98 strains of fermentors, 73 strains (74.5%) could be identified as; Escherichia (9), E. coli (12), Enterobacter Liquefaciens (31), Ent. cloacae (7), Ent. halfnia (8), Ent. aerogenes (1) and proteus (5); while 25 strains (25.5%) which split glucose and lactose or sucrose fermentative with acid but no gaseouse formation remain to be ascertained.
TI  - [Rare initiation codons are regulators of expression of the rpoC gene].
AB  - Translation of the rpoC genes in Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium is known to start from the GUG codon. Now, using toeprint analysis we have shown UUG to be the initiation codon of the Pseudomonas putida rpoC gene. IF3 does not seem to proofread initiation at the UUG codon. The rpoC genes of P. putida, E. coli, and S. typhimurium, which use rare start codons, have strong SD-domains AGGAGG (P. p.) and GGGAG (E. c., S. t.), optimal seven-nucleotide spacing between SD and start codons, and good second codon AAA. We suggest that rpoC presents an infrequent case of the regulation of translation initiation by selecting the start codon.
TI  - Cloning and expression of the ponB gene, encoding penicillin-binding protein 1B of Escherichia coli, in heterologous systems.
AB  - A fragment from the ponB region of the Escherichia coli chromosome comprising the promoterless sequence encoding penicillin-binding protein 1B (PBP 1B) has been cloned in a broad-host-range expression vector under the control of the kanamycin resistance gene promoter present in the vector. The hybrid plasmid (pJP3) was used to transform appropriate strains of Salmonella typhimurium, Pseudomonas putida, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In all instances, the coding sequence was expressed in the heterologous hosts, yielding a product with electrophoretic mobility, protease accessibility, membrane location, and beta-lactam-binding properties identical to those of native PBP 1B in E. coli. These results indicated that PBP 1B of E. coli is compatible with the cytoplasmic membrane environment of unrelated bacterial species and support the idea that interspecific transfer of mutated alleles of genes coding for PBPs could potentially be an efficient spreading mechanism for intrinsic resistance to beta-lactams.
TI  - Cloning and sequence analysis of the genes encoding the alpha and beta subunits of the E1 component of the pyruvate dehydrogenase multienzyme complex of Bacillus stearothermophilus.
AB  - A 4175-bp EcoRI fragment of DNA that encodes the alpha and beta chains of the pyruvate dehydrogenase (lipoamide) component (E1) of the pyruvate dehydrogenase multienzyme complex of Bacillus stearothermophilus has been cloned in Escherichia coli. Its nucleotide sequence was determined. Open reading frames (pdhA, pdhB) corresponding to the E1 alpha subunit (368 amino acids, Mr 41,312, without the initiating methionine residue) and E1 beta subunit (324 amino acids, Mr 35,306, without the initiating methionine residue) were identified and confirmed with the aid of amino acid sequences determined directly from the purified polypeptide chains. The E1 beta gene begins just 3 bp downstream from the E1 alpha stop codon. It is followed, after a longer gap of 73 bp, by the start of another but incomplete open reading frame that, on the basis of its known amino acid sequence, encodes the dihydrolipoyl acetyltransferase (E2) component of the complex. All three genes are preceded by potential ribosome-binding sites and the gene cluster is located immediately downstream from a region of DNA showing numerous possible promoter sequences. The E1 alpha and E1 beta subunits of the B. stearothermophilus pyruvate dehydrogenase complex exhibit substantial sequence similarity with the E1 alpha and E1 beta subunits of pyruvate and branched-chain 2-oxo-acid dehydrogenase complexes from mammalian mitochondria and Pseudomonas putida. In particular, the E1 alpha chain contains the highly conserved sequence motif that has been found in all enzymes utilizing thiamin diphosphate as cofactor.
TI  - Mutations leading to constitutive expression from the TOL plasmid meta-cleavage pathway operon are located at the C-terminal end of the positive regulator protein XylS.
AB  - The XylS protein is the positive activator of the TOL plasmid meta-cleavage pathway operon for the metabolism of alkylbenzoates in Pseudomonas putida. The regulator stimulates transcription from the TOL meta pathway operon promoter (Pm) when activated by benzoate effectors or in the absence of effectors when overproduced. xylS mutant alleles that encode regulators which constitutively mediate expression from Pm were isolated and characterized. The mutant proteins all exhibit single amino acid substitutions adjacent to putative alpha-helix-turn-alpha-helix domains at their C-terminal ends. The XylS mutant proteins can still be partially activated by the usual and unusual benzoate effectors for the wild-type regulator and when activated stimulate higher levels of transcription from Pm.
TI  - Genes for two herbicide-inducible cytochromes P-450 from Streptomyces griseolus.
AB  - Streptomyces griseolus ATCC 11796 contains two inducible, herbicide-metabolizing  cytochromes P-450 previously designated P-450SU1 and P-450SU2 (P-450CVA1 and P-450CVB1, respectively, using nomenclature of Nebert et al. [D. W. Nebert, M. Adesnik, M. J. Coon, R. W. Estabrook, F. J. Gonzalez, F. P. Guengerich, I. C. Gunsalus, E. F. Johnson, B. Kemper, W. Levin, I. R. Phillips, R. Sato, and M. R. Waterman, DNA 6:1-11, 1987]). Using antibodies directed against cytochrome P-450SU1, its N-terminal amino acid sequence, and amino acid composition, we cloned the suaC gene encoding cytochrome P-450SU1. Similar information about the cytochrome P-450SU2 protein confirmed that a gene cloned by cross-hybridization to the suaC gene was the subC gene encoding cytochrome P-450SU2. The suaC and subC genes were expressed in Escherichia coli, DNA for both genes was sequenced, and the deduced amino acid sequences were compared with that of the well-characterized cytochrome P-450CAM from Pseudomonas putida. Both cytochromes P-450SU1 and P-450SU2 contain several regions of strong similarity with the amino acid sequence of P-450CAM, primarily in regions of the protein responsible for attachment and coordination of the heme prosthetic group.
TI  - Sequence analysis of the hutH gene encoding histidine ammonia-lyase in Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - The complete nucleotide sequence of the hutH gene, encoding histidine ammonia-lyase (histidase), in Pseudomonas putida ATCC 12633 has been determined from the appropriate portions of the hut region that had been cloned into Escherichia coli. The resulting DNA sequence revealed an open reading frame of 1,530 base pairs, corresponding to a protein subunit of approximate molecular weight 53,600, in the location previously identified for the histidase gene by Tn1000 mutagenesis. Translation began at a GTG codon, but direct protein sequencing revealed that the initiating amino acid was removed posttranslationally to provide an N-terminal threonine; 11 additional residues completely agreed with the predicted amino acid sequence. This sequence excluded the possibility that a dehydroalanine unit, the postulated coenzyme for histidase, is attached at the N terminus of histidase subunits. Comparison of the P. putida histidase gene sequence with that of a Bacillus subtilis region encoding histidase revealed 42% identity at the protein level. Although the hutU (urocanase) and hutH (histidase) genes are induced by urocanate and normally are transcribed as a unit beginning with hutU, analysis of the region immediately upstream of the histidase gene revealed a potential weak promoter that may possibly be used to maintain a basal level of histidase for the generation of inducer (urocanate) when histidine levels are elevated.
TI  - Organization and sequence analysis of the 2,4-dichlorophenol hydroxylase and dichlorocatechol oxidative operons of plasmid pJP4.
AB  - Growth of Alcaligenes eutrophus JMP134 on 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetate requires a 2,4-dichlorphenol hydroxylase encoded by gene tfdB. Catabolism of either 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetate or 3-chlorobenzoate involves enzymes encoded by the chlorocatechol oxidative operon consisting of tfdCDEF, which converts 3-chloro- and 3,5-dichlorocatechol to maleylacetate and chloromaleylacetate, respectively. Transposon mutagenesis has localized tfdB and tfdCDEF to EcoRI fragment B of plasmid pJP4 (R. H. Don, A. J. Wieghtman, H.-J. Knackmuss, and K. N. Timmis, J. Bacteriol. 161:85-90, 1985). We present the complete nucleotide sequence of tfdB and tfdCDEF contained within a 7,954-base-pair HindIII-SstI fragment from EcoRI fragment B. Sequence and expression analysis of tfdB in Escherichia coli suggested that 2,4-dichlorophenol hydroxylase consists of a single subunit of 65 kilodaltons. The amino acid sequences of proteins encoded by tfdD and tfdE were found to be 63 and 53% identical to those of functionally similar enzymes encoded by clcB and clcD, respectively, from plasmid pAC27 of Pseudomonas putida. P. putida(pAC27) can utilize 3-chlorocatechol but not dichlorinated catechols. A region of DNA adjacent to clcD in pAC27 was found to be 47% identical in amino acid sequence to tfdF, a gene important in catabolizing dichlorocatechols. The region in pAC27 does not appear to encode a protein, suggesting that the absence of a functional trans-chlorodienelactone isomerase may prevent P. putida(pAC27) from utilizing 3,5-dichlorocatechol.
TI  - A new family of RSF1010-derived expression and lac-fusion broad-host-range vectors for gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - A series of broad-host-range expression and lac fusion vectors, based on RSF1010  derivatives, was constructed. The expression vectors contain various promoters (pNm, plac, ptac and pS1) for expression of foreign genes. The efficiency of the promoters was determined in Escherichia coli, Rhizobium meliloti, Rhizobium leguminosarum and Pseudomonas putida by beta-galactosidase activity measurements. Of the promoters assayed in E. coli, the most effective is the tac promoter, whereas in soil bacteria the appropriate promoter for overexpression of foreign genes is the NmR promoter. The GmR gene, serving as a selectable marker for the plasmids, was efficiently expressed in R. meliloti as revealed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and thus, pGm was also used to construct an expression vector. The translational fusion vectors allow the identification and characterization of promoter-carrying cloned fragments on the translational level, whereas the transcriptional fusion vectors can be used to identify and to study promoters on cloned fragments. All lac fusion vectors contain the E. coli lacZ gene or the complete lac operon facilitating quantification of expression.
TI  - A family of positive regulators related to the Pseudomonas putida TOL plasmid XylS and the Escherichia coli AraC activators.
AB  - The XylS family consists of a least 8 different transcriptional regulators. Six of these proteins are positive regulators for the catabolism of carbon sources (benzoate and sugars) in Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas putida and Erwinia carotovora, and two of them are involved in pathogenesis in Escherichia coli and Yersinia enterocolitica. Based on protein alignments, the members of this family exhibit a long stretch of homology at the C-terminal end. The regulators involved in the catabolism of carbon sources stimulate transcription from their respectively regulated promoters only in the presence of effectors. In two of the regulators, mutations at the non-homologous N-terminus alter affinity and specificity for effectors while mutations at the conserved C-terminus part decrease activation of transcription from their corresponding regulated promoters. It is thus probable that the variable N-terminus end in this family of regulators contains the motif involved in effector recognition, while the C-terminal end is involved in DNA-binding. These proteins seem to be related by common ancestry and may act through similar mechanisms of positive regulation effected through similar folding patterns.
TI  - Putidaredoxin reductase and putidaredoxin. Cloning, sequence determination, and heterologous expression of the proteins.
AB  - The oxidation of camphor by cytochrome P-450cam requires the participation of a flavoprotein, putidaredoxin reductase, and an iron-sulfur protein, putidaredoxin, to mediate the transfer of electrons from NADH to P-450 for oxygen activation. A 2.2-kilobase pair BamHI-StuI fragment from whole cell DNA of camphor-grown Pseudomonas putida has been cloned and sequenced. Translation of the sequence revealed two open reading frames that could code for putidaredoxin reductase and putidaredoxin. In the case of putidaredoxin, the translated sequence matched the published sequence (Tanaka, M., Haniu, M., Yasunobu, K. T., Dus, K., and Gunsalus, I. C. (1974) J. Biol. Chem. 249, 3689-3701) with the exception of one amino acid. Codon usage in these proteins, like the proteins of other Pseudomonads, is strongly biased to G + C in the third nucleotide. A potential transcription termination site was found 3' to the putidaredoxin coding region. The "FAD-binding" amino acid consensus sequence, present in other flavoproteins, was found in putidaredoxin reductase beginning at residue 11 and a second occurrence of this sequence was found beginning with amino acid 156. The second sequence could represent the NAD-binding site. The regions encoding putidaredoxin reductase and putidaredoxin were subcloned and independently expressed in Escherichia coli at the level of 0.4 and 4.8 mg of enzymatically active protein/g wet weight of cells, respectively. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to change the rare start codon, GTG, of putidaredoxin reductase to ATG which resulted in an 18-fold increase in the level of expression of this protein to 7.4 mg/g wet weight of cells. The construction of these two clones, which express these important proteins, will facilitate studies of their interaction with each other and with P-450cam.
TI  - Microcosm for assessing survival of genetically engineered microorganisms in aquatic environments.
AB  - Laboratory-contained microcosms are important for studying the fate and survival  of genetically engineered microorganisms. In this study, we describe a simple aquatic microcosm that utilizes survival chambers in a flowthrough or static renewal system. The model was used to study the survival of genetically engineered and wild-type strains of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida in the lake water environment. Temperature-dependent studies indicated that the genetically engineered microorganisms survived better or at least as well as their wild-type counterparts at 15, 25, and 30 degrees C. The genetic determinants of the genetically engineered microorganisms also remained fairly stable within the host cell under the tested conditions. In the presence of organisms indigenous to lake water, E. coli was eliminated after 20 days, whereas P. putida showed an initial decline but was able to stabilize its population after 5 days. A herbicide, Hydrothol-191, caused a significant decline in numbers of P. putida, but no significant difference was observed between the genetically engineered microorganisms and the wild-type strain. The microcosm described is simple, can be easily adapted to study a variety of environmental variables, and has the advantage that the organisms tested are constantly exposed to test waters that are continuously renewed.
TI  - Identification and localization of 3-phenylcatechol dioxygenase and 2-hydroxy-6-oxo-6-phenylhexa-2,4-dienoate hydrolase genes of Pseudomonas putida and expression in Escherichia coli.
AB  - The bphC and bphD genes of Pseudomonas putida involved in the catabolism of polychlorinated biphenyls or biphenyl were identified, localized, and studied for expression in Escherichia coli. This was achieved by cloning a 2.4-kilobase (kb) DNA fragment of recombinant cosmid pOH101 into HindIII site of pUC plasmids downstream of a lacZ promoter and measuring the enzyme activities of 3-phenylcatechol dioxygenase (3-PDase; a product of bphC) and the meta-cleavage product 2-hydroxy-6-oxo-6-phenylhexa-2,4-dienoate hydrolase (a product of bphD). The amount of 3-PDase produced in E. coli was about 20 times higher than that of the enzyme produced by the parent, P. putida. Determination of expression of the bphC and bphD genes through their own promoter sequences or by using the lacZ promoter of pUC plasmids was done by cloning the DNA that encodes bphC and bphD genes in a HindIII site of a promoter selection vector (pKK232-8) upstream of the gene for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT). The recombinant plasmid (pAW787) constructed by inserting the 2.4-kb DNA in pKK232-8 expressed both 3-PDase and CAT activities. Another hybrid construct (pAW786) in which the DNA insert was cloned in the opposite orientation lacked CAT activity but produced normal amounts of 3-PDase activity. On the basis of these results, we suggest that the bphC and bphD genes were expressed by using promoter sequences that are independent of the promoter that expresses CAT activity in E. coli. The locations of the bphC and bphD genes were determined by insertional inactivation of the open reading frames of structural genes bphC and bphD by Tn5 mutagenesis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Enzymatic production of L-tryptophan from DL-serine and indole by a coupled reaction of tryptophan synthase and amino acid racemase.
AB  - Enzymatic production of L-tryptophan from DL-serine and indole by a coupled reaction of tryptophan synthase and amino acid racemase was studied. The tryptophan synthase (EC 4.2.1.20) of Escherichia coli catalyzed beta-substitution reaction of L-serine into L-tryptophan and the amino acid racemase (EC 5.1.1.10) of Pseudomonas putida catalyzed the racemization of D-serine simultaneously in one reactor. Under optimal conditions established for L-tryptophan production, a large-scale production of L-tryptophan was carried out in a 200-liter reactor using intact cells of E. coli and P. putida. After 24 h of incubation with intermittent indole feeding, 110 g liter-1 of L-tryptophan was formed in molar yields of 91 and 100% for added DL-serine and indole, respectively. Continuous production of L-tryptophan was also carried out using immobilized cells of E. coli and P. putida. The maximum concentration of L-tryptophan formed was 5.2 g liter-1 (99% molar yield for indole), and the concentration decreased to 4.2 g liter-1 after continuous operation for 20 days.
TI  - Isolation and partial characterization of an extradiol non-haem iron dioxygenase  which preferentially cleaves 3-methylcatechol.
AB  - A purification procedure has been developed for an extradiol dioxygenase expressed in Escherichia coli, which was originally derived from a Pseudomonas putida strain able to grow on toluidine. Physical and kinetic properties of the enzyme have been investigated. The enzyme has a subunit Mr of 33,500 +/- 2000 by SDS/polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis. Gel filtration indicates a molecular mass under non-denaturing conditions of 120,000 +/- 20,000. The N-terminal sequence (35 residues) of the enzyme has been determined and exhibits 50% identity with other extradiol dioxygenases. Fe(II) is a cofactor of the enzyme, as it is for other extradiol dioxygenases. The reactivity of this enzyme towards catechol and methyl-substituted catechols is somewhat different from that seen for other catechol 2,3-dioxygenases, with 3-methylcatechol cleaved at a higher rate than catechol or 4-methylcatechol. Km values for these substrates with this enzyme are all around 0.3 microM. The enzyme exhibits a bell-shaped pH profile with pKa values of 6.9 +/- 0.1 and 8.7 +/- 0.1. These results are compared with those found for other extradiol dioxygenases.
TI  - The meta cleavage operon of TOL degradative plasmid pWW0 comprises 13 genes.
AB  - The meta-cleavage operon of TOL plasmid pWW0 of Pseudomonas putida encodes a set  of enzymes which transform benzoate/toluates to Krebs cycle intermediates via extradiol (meta-) cleavage of (methyl)catechol. The genetic organization of the operon was characterized by cloning of the meta-cleavage genes into an expression vector and identification of their products in Escherichia coli maxicells. This analysis showed that the meta-cleavage operon contains 13 genes whose order and products (in kilodaltons) are xylX(57)-xylY(20)-xylZ(39)-xylL(28)-xylT(1 2)-xylE(36)-xylG(60)-xylF(34)- xylJ(28)-xylQ(42)-xylK(39)-xylI(29)-xylH(4 ). The xylXYZ genes encode three subunits of toluate 1,2-dioxygenase. The xylL, xylE, xylG, xylF, xylJ, xylK, xylI, and xylH genes encode 1,2-dihydroxy-3,5-cyclohexadiene-1-carboxylate dehydrogenase, catechol 2,3-dioxygenase, 2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde dehydrogenase, 2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde hydrolase, 2-oxopent-4-enoate hydratase, 4-hydroxy-2-oxovalerate aldolase, 4-oxalocrotonate decarboxylase and 4-oxaloccotonate tautomerase, respectively. The functions of xylT and xylQ are not known at present. The comparison of the coding capacity and the sizes of the products of the meta-cleavage operon genes indicated that most of the DNA between xylX and xylH consists of coding sequences.
TI  - Cloning vectors, derived from a naturally occurring plasmid of Pseudomonas savastanoi, specifically tailored for genetic manipulations in Pseudomonas.
AB  - A minimal replicon of 1.8 kb isolated from a 10-kb plasmid of Pseudomonas savastanoi, pPS10, has been used to obtain a collection of small vectors specific for Pseudomonas (P. savastanoi, P. aeruginosa and P.putida). In addition, shuttle vectors that can be established both in Pseudomonas and Escherichia coli have been constructed by adding a pMB9 replicon. The vectors permit cloning of DNA fragments generated by a variety of restriction enzymes using different antibiotic resistance markers for selection and offer the possibility to screen recombinants by insertional inactivation. This cloning system can be used to establish recombinant plasmids in Pseudomonas either at low or high copy number. pPS10 derivatives are compatible with other Pseudomonas vectors derived from broad-host-range replicons of the incompatibility groups P1, P4/Q and W. Introduction and expression of the iaaMH operon in a P. savastanoi mutant deficient in the production of indoleacetic acid has been achieved using one of these vectors.
TI  - Evolutionary differences in chromosomal locations of four early genes of the tryptophan pathway in fluorescent pseudomonads: DNA sequences and characterization of Pseudomonas putida trpE and trpGDC.
AB  - Pseudomonas putida possesses seven structural genes for enzymes of the tryptophan pathway. All but one, trpG, which encodes the small (beta) subunit of anthranilate synthase, have been mapped on the circular chromosome. This report describes the cloning and sequencing of P. putida trpE, trpG, trpD, and trpC. In P. putida and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, DNA sequence analysis as well as growth and enzyme assays of insertionally inactivated strains indicated that trpG is the first gene in a three-gene operon that also contains trpD and trpC. In P. putida, trpE is 2.2 kilobases upstream from the trpGDC cluster, whereas in P. aeruginosa, they are separated by at least 25 kilobases (T. Shinomiya, S. Shiga, and M. Kageyama, Mol. Gen. Genet., 189:382-389, 1983). The DNA sequence in P. putida shows an open reading frame on the opposite strand between trpE and trpGDC; this putative gene was not characterized. Evidence is also presented for sequence similarities in the 5' untranslated regions of trpE and trpGDC in both pseudomonads; the function of these regions is unknown, but it is possible that they play some role in regulation of these genes, since all the genes respond to repression by tryptophan. The sequences of the anthranilate synthase genes in the fluorescent pseudomonads resemble those of p-aminobenzoate synthase genes of the enteric bacteria more closely than the anthranilate synthase genes of those organisms; however, no requirement for p-aminobenzoate was found in the Pseudomonas mutants created in this study.
TI  - Biotransformation of substituted benzoates to the corresponding cis-diols by an engineered strain of Pseudomonas oleovorans producing the TOL plasmid-specified enzyme toluate-1,2-dioxygenase.
AB  - The conversion of substituted benzoates into 1,2-cis-dihydroxycyclohexa-3,5-diene carboxylic acids (cis-diols) was effected by using Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas recombinants carrying the xylXYZ genes originating from the Pseudomonas putida mt-2 TOL plasmid, thus producing toluate-1,2-dioxygenase. Pseudomonas oleovorans GPo12 recombinants readily produced meta- and para-substituted cis-diols, but were limited in their oxidation of ortho-substituted substrates.
TI  - Identification and characterization of genes for a second anthranilate synthase in Pseudomonas aeruginosa: interchangeability of the two anthranilate synthases and evolutionary implications.
AB  - Two anthranilate synthase gene pairs have been identified in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. They were cloned, sequenced, inactivated in vitro by insertion of an antibiotic resistance gene, and returned to P. aeruginosa, replacing the wild-type gene. One anthranilate synthase enzyme participates in tryptophan synthesis; its genes are designated trpE and trpG. The other anthranilate synthase enzyme, encoded by phnA and phnB, participates in the synthesis of pyocyanin, the characteristic phenazine pigment of the organism. trpE and trpG are independently transcribed; homologous genes have been cloned from Pseudomonas putida. The phenazine pathway genes phnA and phnB are cotranscribed. The cloned phnA phnB gene pair complements trpE and trpE(G) mutants of Escherichia coli. Homologous genes were not found in P. putida PPG1, a non-phenazine producer. Surprisingly, PhnA and PhnB are more closely related to E. coli TrpE and TrpG than to Pseudomonas TrpE and TrpG, whereas Pseudomonas TrpE and TrpG are more closely related to E. coli PabB and PabA than to E. coli TrpE and TrpG. We replaced the wild-type trpE on the P. aeruginosa chromosome with a mutant form having a considerable portion of its coding sequence deleted and replaced by a tetracycline resistance gene cassette. This resulted in tryptophan auxotrophy; however, spontaneous tryptophan-independent revertants appeared at a frequency of 10(-5) to 10(6). The anthranilate synthase of these revertants is not feedback inhibited by tryptophan, suggesting that it arises from PhnAB. phnA mutants retain a low level of pyocyanin production. Introduction of an inactivated trpE gene into a phnA mutant abolished residual pyocyanin production, suggesting that the trpE trpG gene products are capable of providing some anthranilate for pyocyanin synthesis.
TI  - Pseudomonas chromosomal replication origins: a bacterial class distinct from Escherichia coli-type origins.
AB  - The bacterial origins of DNA replication have been isolated from Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas putida. These origins comprise a second class of bacterial origins distinct from enteric-type origins: both origins function in both Pseudomonas species, and neither functions in Escherichia coli; enteric origins do not function in either pseudomonad. Both cloned sequences hybridize to chromosomal fragments that show properties expected of replication origins. These origin plasmids are highly unstable, are present at low copy number, and show mutual incompatibility properties. DNA sequence analysis shows that both origins contain several 9-base-pair (bp) E. coli DnaA protein binding sites; four of these are conserved in position and orientation, two of which resemble the R1 and R4 sites of the E. coli origin. Conserved 13-bp direct repeats adjacent to the analogous R1 site are also found. No GATC sites are in the P. aeruginosa origin and only four are in the P. putida origin; no other 4-bp sequence is present in high abundance. Both origins are found between sequences similar to the E. coli and Bacillus subtilis dnaA, dnaN, rpmH, and rnpA genes, a gene organization identical to that for B. subtilis and unlike that of E. coli. A second autonomously replicating sequence was obtained from P. aeruginosa that has some properties of bacterial origins.
TI  - Nucleotide sequencing and characterization of Pseudomonas putida catR: a positive regulator of the catBC operon is a member of the LysR family.
AB  - Pseudomonas putida utilizes the catBC operon for growth on benzoate as a sole carbon source. This operon is positively regulated by the CatR protein, which is encoded from a gene divergently oriented from the catBC operon. The catR gene encodes a 32.2-kilodalton polypeptide that binds to the catBC promoter region in the presence or absence of the inducer cis-cis-muconate, as shown by gel retardation studies. However, the inducer is required for transcriptional activation of the catBC operon. The catR promoter has been localized to a 385-base-pair fragment by using the broad-host-range promoter-probe vector pKT240. This fragment also contains the catBC promoter whose -35 site is separated by only 36 nucleotides from the predicted CatR translational start. Dot blot analysis suggests that CatR binding to this dual promoter-control region, in addition to inducing the catBC operon, may also regulate its own expression. Data from a computer homology search using the predicted amino acid sequence of CatR, deduced from the DNA sequence, showed CatR to be a member of a large class of procaryotic regulatory proteins designated the LysR family. Striking homology was seen between CatR and a putative regulatory protein, TfdS.
TI  - Overproduction of glutathione and its derivatives by genetically engineered microbial cells.
AB  - In order to improve the biotechnological potentials of Escherichia coli cells to  produce glutathione, S-D-lactoylglutathione and other gamma-glutamyl compounds, the genes for enzymes [gamma-L-glutamyl-L-cysteine synthetase (GSH A) in E. coli B, glutathione synthetase (GSH B) in E. coli B, glyoxalase I (GLO I) in Pseudomonas putida] were cloned and amplified in E. coli. E. coli B cells transformed with both GSH A and GSH B genes exhibited a high activity in the synthesis of glutathione and other gamma-glutamyl compounds in bioreactor systems containing immobilized cells. E. coli C600 cells transformed with GLO I gene of P. putida showed a high GLO I activity and were used for the preparation of S-D-lactoylglutathione and other glutathione thiol esters.
TI  - Molecular cloning of the xylL-xylE region from the P. putida TOL plasmid, pDK1.
AB  - A 5.2 kilobase EcoRI restriction fragment from the Pseudomonas putida HS1 TOL plasmid pDK1, encoding a portion of the lower toluene degradation pathway, was cloned into the E. coli plasmid pBR325. A detailed map of the restriction endonuclease sites was constructed and the nucleotide sequence of three contiguous XhoI fragments, with a combined total length of approximately 3.9 kilobases, has been investigated. This region was determined to contain a total of four separate open reading frames, each preceded by an identical putative ribosome-binding site (nucleotide sequence of 5'-GAGGTG-3'). These open reading frames have been tentatively identified as encoding the lower pathway enzymes catechol 2,3-dioxygenase (C23O) and 1,2-dihydroxycyclohexa-3,5-diene carboxylate dehydrogenase (DHCDH) and a subunit of the toluate 1,2-dioxygenase complex (TO).
TI  - Cloning and sequence analysis of the ntrA (rpoN) gene of Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - The gene encoding a sigma factor NtrA (RpoN) was cloned from Pseudomonas putida by cross-hybridization with a probe containing a part of the corresponding Escherichia coli gene. The cloned gene complemented an ntrA mutation of E. coli in activation of xyl genes on the TOL plasmid. The predicted amino acid (aa) sequence of P. putida NtrA (497 aa; Mr 56,215) is highly homologous to NtrA proteins from Azotobacter vinelandii (81.7%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (52.6%), and Rhizobium meliloti (36.1%). There are two other open reading frames (ORF1, ORF3) upstream and downstream from the ntrA gene, respectively. These ntrA-flanking ORFs are also highly homologous to the corresponding ORFs of K. pneumoniae, A. vinelandii, and R. meliloti.
TI  - Transposable elements for efficient manipulation of a wide range of gram-negative bacteria: promoter probes and vectors for foreign genes.
AB  - We describe here the construction and use of a series of modified transposons based on the insertion sequence IS1. Like their parent, omegon-Km [Fellay et al., Gene 76 (1989) 215-226], these elements permit efficient insertional mutagenesis of a variety of Gram-negative bacteria. The presence of a functional pBR322 origin of replication within the transposable element facilitates subsequent cloning of the mutated gene. The omegon-Km system was previously shown to function in Pseudomonas putida, Rhizobium leguminosarum and Paracoccus denitrificans. The results we present here demonstrate that its use can be extended to Xanthomonas campestris, a plant pathogen, and to the microaeroduric Zymomonas mobilis. Derivative transposons carrying unique restriction sites for ScaI, NdeI, XbaI and XhoI have been constructed, allowing the cloning and introduction of foreign genes. We have also constructed two derivatives which can be used to generate operon fusions upon insertion and are thus useful for isolating and characterising indigenous promoters. One carries a promoterless chloramphenicol acetyl-transferase (CAT)-encoding gene (cat) and the second, the entire promoterless Escherichia coli lac operon. We demonstrate the utility of the cat promoter probe in X. campestris to target conditional promoters inducible by high salt or subject to repression by glucose.
TI  - Activation of Chi recombinational hotspots by RecBCD-like enzymes from enteric bacteria.
AB  - Chi sites, 5'G-C-T-G-G-T-G-G-3', enhance homologous recombination in Escherichia  coli and are activated by the RecBCD enzyme. To test the ability of Chi to be activated by analogous enzymes from other bacteria, we cloned recBCD-like genes from diverse bacteria into an E. coli recBCD deletion mutant. Clones from seven species of enteric bacteria conferred to this deletion mutant recombination proficiency, Chi hotspot activity in lambda Red- Gam- vegetative crosses, and RecBCD enzyme activities, including Chi-dependent DNA strand cleavage. Three clones from Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Ps. putida conferred recombination proficiency and ATP-dependent nuclease activity, but neither Chi hotspot activity nor Chi-dependent DNA cleavage. These results imply that Chi has been conserved as a recombination-promoting signal for RecBCD-like enzymes in enteric bacteria but not in more distantly related bacteria such as Pseudomonas spp. We discuss the possibility that other, presently unknown, nucleotide sequences serve the same function as Chi in Pseudomonas spp.
TI  - Trichloroethylene degradation by Escherichia coli containing the cloned Pseudomonas putida F1 toluene dioxygenase genes.
AB  - Toluene dioxygenase from Pseudomonas putida F1 has been implicated as an enzyme capable of degrading trichloroethylene. This has now been confirmed with Escherichia coli JM109(pDTG601) that contains the structural genes (todC1C2BA) of toluene dioxygenase under the control of the tac promoter. The extent of trichloroethylene degradation by the recombinant organism depended on the cell concentration and the concentration of trichloroethylene. A linear rate of trichloroethylene degradation was observed with the E. coli recombinant strain. In contrast, P. putida F39/D, a mutant strain of P. putida F1 that does not contain cis-toluene dihydrodiol dehydrogenase, showed a much faster initial rate of trichloroethylene degradation which decreased over time.
TI  - Physically associated enzymes produce and metabolize 2-hydroxy-2,4-dienoate, a chemically unstable intermediate formed in catechol metabolism via meta cleavage in Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - The meta-cleavage pathway of catechol is a major mechanism for degradation of aromatic compounds. In this pathway, the aromatic ring of catechol is cleaved by catechol 2,3-dioxygenase and its product, 2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde, is further metabolized by either a hydrolytic or dehydrogenative route. In the dehydrogenative route, 2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde is oxidized to the enol form of 4-oxalocrotonate by a dehydrogenase and then further metabolized to acetaldehyde and pyruvate by the actions of 4-oxalocrotonate isomerase, 4-oxalocrotonate decarboxylase, 2-oxopent-4-enoate hydratase, and 4-hydroxy-2-oxovalerate aldolase. In this study, the isomerase, decarboxylase, and hydratase encoded in the TOL plasmid pWW0 of Pseudomonas putida mt-2 were purified and characterized. The 28-kilodalton isomerase was formed by association of extremely small identical protein subunits with an apparent molecular weight of 3,500. The decarboxylase and the hydratase were 27- and 28-kilodalton polypeptides, respectively, and were copurified by high-performance-liquid chromatography with anion-exchange, hydrophobic interaction, and gel filtration columns. The structural genes for the decarboxylase (xylI) and the hydratase (xylJ) were cloned into Escherichia coli. The elution profile in anion-exchange chromatography of the decarboxylase and the hydratase isolated from E. coli XylI+XylJ- and XylI-XylJ+ clones, respectively, were different from those isolated from XylI+ XylJ+ bacteria. This suggests that the carboxylase and the hydratase form a complex in vivo. The keto but not the enol form of 4-oxalocrotonate was a substrate for the decarboxylase. The product of decarboxylation was 2-hydroxypent-2,4-dienoate rather than its keto form, 2-oxopent-4-enoate. The hydratase acts on the former but not the latter isomer. Because 2-hydroxypent-2,4-dienoate is chemically unstable, formation of a complex between the decarboxylase and the hydratase may assure efficient transformation of this unstable intermediate in vivo.
TI  - [Plasmids for biphenyl, chlorobiphenyl and metatoluylate degradation from Pseudomonas putida].
AB  - Pseudomonas putida strain SU83, harbors the pBS311 plasmid coding for the degradation of biphenyl, 2- and 4-chlorbiphenyl, meta- and paratoluylate. The insertional mutants of the plasmid obtained by the transposon Tn5 insertion were isolated. One of the mutants was used for cloning of the biphenyl degradation genes. The plasmid pBS311:: Tn5 DNA was inserted into the BamHI site of the plasmid pBR322 and cloned. 11 recombinants of 354 tested were treated with 0.1% solution of 2,3-dioxybiphenyl. One of them has acquired the yellow colour testifying to conversion of 2,3-dioxyphenyl to "2-hydroxy-6-keto-6-phenylhexa-2,4-diene acid. The recombinant plasmid pBS312 from this clone is 10.5 kb in size, the size of the insert being 6.2 kb. Escherichia coli SU185 cells harbouring pBS312 are able to support metacleavage of 2,3-dioxybiphenyl, 3-methylcatechol and catechol, but not of 4-methylcatechol. The results suggest the cloned fragment to contain a gene for 2,3-dioxybiphenyl-1,2-dioxygenase, the third enzyme for biphenyl catabolism.
TI  - Studies of nucleotide sequence homology between naphthalene-utilizing strains of  bacteria.
AB  - The ability of P. putida, strain NCIB 9816, to grow with naphthalene (Nah+) and salicylate (Sal+) is correlated with the presence of an 83 kilobase (kb) conjugative plasmid (pDTG1). The genes encoding the upper pathway (Nah--greater than Sal) for naphthalene degradation are located on a 15 kb EcoRI fragment which was cloned into pKT230. The resulting recombinant, pDTG113, was nick-translated and used as a radioactive probe to investigate nucleotide sequence homology between the naphthalene-utilizing organisms, P. putida G7, P. putida NP, and strain PL6. Each of these bacterial strains were isolated from different locations at different times. The results show that all of these organisms contain closely related genes that are involved in naphthalene metabolism.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of altered plasmids in mutant strains of Pseudomonas putida NCIB 9816.
AB  - The ability of P. putida NCIB 9816 to grow with naphthalene (Nah+) and salicylate (Sal+) is correlated with the presence of an 83 kilobase (kb) conjugative plasmid, pDTG1. Derivatives of pDTG1 were obtained from cells after exposure to halogenated analogs of naphthalene or salicylate. The selection of mutants having a Nah-Sal- or a Nah-Sal+ phenotype could be enhanced by the addition of triphenyltetrazolium chloride to the indicator medium. Structurally modified plasmids were characterized by restriction endonuclease digestion and Southern hybridization experiments. The region of pDTG1 DNA that encodes the enzymes responsible for the conversion of naphthalene to salicylate was identified. The structural changes in mutant plasmids were correlated with the absence of essential enzymatic activities.
TI  - Putidaredoxin competitively inhibits cytochrome b5-cytochrome P-450cam association: a proposed molecular model for a cytochrome P-450cam electron-transfer complex.
AB  - Cytochrome b5 has been genetically engineered to afford a fluorescent derivative  capable of monitoring its association with cytochrome P-450cam from Pseudomonas putida [Stayton, P. S., Fisher, M. T., & Sligar, S. G. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 13544-13548]. In the mutant cytochrome b5, threonine is replaced by a cysteine at position 65 (T65C) and has been labeled with the environmentally sensitive fluorophore acrylodan. In this paper, the physiological P-450cam reductant putidaredoxin, an Fe2S2.Cys4 iron-sulfur protein, is shown to competitively inhibit the cytochrome b5 association, suggesting that cytochrome b5 and putidaredoxin bind to a similar site on the cytochrome P-450cam surface. Since the crystal structures for both cytochrome b5 and cytochrome P-450cam have been solved to high resolution, the complex has been computer modeled, and a good fit was found on the proximal surface of nearest approach to the P-450cam heme prosthetic group. The proposed model includes electrostatic contacts between conserved cytochrome b5 carboxylates Glu-44, Glu-48, Asp-60, and the exposed heme propionate with cytochrome P-450cam basic residues Lys-344, Arg-72, Arg-112, and Arg-364, respectively. Putidaredoxin has similarly been shown to contain a carboxylate-based binding surface, and the current results suggest that if the model is correct, then it also interacts at the proposed site, probably utilizing similar P-450cam electrostatic contacts.
TI  - Sodium hexametaphosphate sensitizes Pseudomonas aeruginosa, several other species of Pseudomonas, and Escherichia coli to hydrophobic drugs.
AB  - Many gram-negative bacteria are known to be remarkably resistant to hydrophobic noxious agents by virtue of their outer membranes (OM). We investigated, by using four different assay methods, the ability of sodium hexametaphosphate (HMP) to disrupt this OM barrier. (i) In the growth inhibition assay, HMP was found to sensitize strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to all the hydrophobic probes tested (rifampin, fusidic acid, dactinomycin, sodium dodecyl sulfate, and Triton X-100). A concentration of 0.3% HMP decreased the MICs of the probes by a factor of approximately 10, and maximally even a 30-fold sensitization was found with 1% HMP. (ii) In the bactericidal assay, 0.3% HMP decreased the MBC of the hydrophobic probe rifampin by a factor of approximately 30. (iii) In the bacteriolytic assay, 0.1% HMP sensitized the target bacteria to lysis by sodium dodecyl sulfate and Triton X-100. (iv) In the fluorescent-probe binding assay, HMP drastically enhanced the binding of fluorescent N-phenyl naphthylamine to the membranes of the target cells. In addition to P. aeruginosa, P. fluorescens, P. putida, P. fragi, and Escherichia coli were susceptible to the OM permeability-increasing action of HMP, while P. cepacia was resistant.
TI  - Cloning, sequencing, and expression of the gene for NADH-sensitive citrate synthase of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - The structural gene for the allosteric citrate synthase of Pseudomonas aeruginosa has been cloned from a genomic library by using the Escherichia coli citrate synthase gene as a hybridization probe under conditions of reduced stringency. Subcloning of portions of the original 10-kilobase-pair (kbp) clone led to isolation of the structural gene, with its promoter, within a 2,083-bp length of DNA flanked by sites for KpnI and BamHI. The nucleotide sequence of this fragment is presented; the inferred amino acid sequence was 70 and 76% identical, respectively, with the citrate synthase sequences from E. coli and Acinetobacter anitratum, two other gram-negative bacteria. DEAE-cellulose chromatography of P. aeruginosa citrate synthase from an E. coli host harboring the cloned P. aeruginosa gene gave three peaks of activity. All three enzyme peaks had subunit molecular weights of 48,000; the proteins were identical by immunological criteria and very similar in kinetics of substrate saturation and NADH inhibition. Because the cloned gene contained only one open reading frame large enough to encode a polypeptide of such a size, the three peaks must represent different forms of the same protein. A portion of the cloned P. aeruginosa gene was used as a hybridization probe under stringent conditions to identify highly homologous sequences in genomic DNA of a second strain classified as P. aeruginosa and isolates of P. putida, P. stutzeri, and P. alcaligenes. When crude extracts of each of these four isolates were mixed with antiserum raised against purified P. aeruginosa citrate synthase, however, only the P. alcaligenes extract cross-reacted.
TI  - Bacterial aromatic ring-cleavage enzymes are classified into two different gene families.
AB  - Dioxygenases that catalyze the cleavage of the aromatic ring are classified into  two groups according to their mode of ring fission. Substrates of ring-cleavage dioxygenases usually contain hydroxyl groups on adjacent aromatic carbons, and intradiol enzymes cleave the ring between these two hydroxyl groups. Extradiol enzymes in contrast cleave the ring between one hydroxylated carbon and its adjacent nonhydroxylated carbon. In this study, we determined the complete nucleotide sequence of nahC, the structural gene for 1,2-dihydroxynaphthalene dioxygenase encoded in the NAH7 plasmid of Pseudomonas putida. This enzyme is an extradiol ring-cleavage enzyme that cleaves the first ring of 1,2-dihydroxynaphthalene. The amino acid sequence of the dioxygenase deduced from the DNA sequence demonstrated that the molecular weight of the enzyme is 33,882. This result was in agreement with those of maxicell analyses that showed that the nahC product was a 36-kDa protein. Interestingly, the amino acid sequence of 1,2-dihydroxynaphthalene dioxygenase was 50% homologous with that of 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl dioxygenase, which catalyzes extradiol cleavage of the first ring of 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl (Furukawa, K., Arimura, N., and Miyazaki, T. (1987) J. Bacteriol. 169, 427-429). The amino acid sequence similarity of 1,2-dihydroxynaphthalene dioxygenase with catechol 2,3-dioxygenase, which is an authentic extradiol dioxygenase, was rather low (16%). However, a statistical analysis by the method of S. B. Needleman and C. D. Wunsch [1970) J. Mol. Biol. 48, 443-453) clearly showed that these two dioxygenases are evolutionarily related. Therefore, these extradiol enzymes are considered as products of the same gene superfamily. From the significant sequence similarity between intradiol enzymes, it has been shown (Neidle, E. L., Harnett, C., Bonitz, S., and Ornston, L. N. (1988) J. Bacteriol. 170, 4874-4880) that intradiol enzymes evolved from a common ancestor. Comparison of the amino acid sequence of extradiol enzymes with those of intradiol dioxygenases did not show any significant global or localized similarity.
TI  - Toluene degradation by Pseudomonas putida F1. Nucleotide sequence of the todC1C2BADE genes and their expression in Escherichia coli.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of the todC1C2BADE genes which encode the first three enzymes in the catabolism of toluene by Pseudomonas putida F1 was determined. The genes encode the three components of the toluene dioxygenase enzyme system: reductaseTOL (todA), ferredoxinTOL (todB), and the two subunits of the terminal dioxygenase (todC1C2); (+)-cis-(1S, 2R)-dihydroxy-3-methylcyclohexa-3,5-diene dehydrogenase (todD); and 3-methylcatechol 2,3-dioxygenase (todE). Knowledge of the nucleotide sequence of the tod genes was used to construct clones of Escherichia coli JM109 that overproduce toluene dioxygenase (JM109(pDT-601]; toluene dioxygenase and (+)-cis-(1S, 2R)-dihydroxy-3-methylcyclohexa-3,5-diene dehydrogenase (JM109(pDTG602]; and toluene dioxygenase, (+)-cis-(1S, 2R)-dihydroxy-3-methylcyclohexa-3,5-diene dehydrogenase, and 3-methylcatechol 2,3-dioxygenase (JM109(pDTG603]. The overexpression of the tod-C1C2BADE gene products was detected by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The three E. coli JM109 strains harboring the plasmids pDTG601, pDTG602, and pDTG603, after induction with isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside, oxidized toluene to (+)-cis-(1S, 2R)-dihydroxy-3-methylcyclohexa-3,5-diene, 3-methylcatechol, and 2-hydroxy-6-oxo-2,4-heptadienoate, respectively. The tod-C1C2BAD genes show significant homology to the reported nucleotide sequence for benzene dioxygenase and cis-1,2-dihydroxycyclohexa-3,5-diene dehydrogenase from P. putida 136R-3 (Irie, S., Doi, S., Yorifuji, T., Takagi, M., and Yano, K. (1987) J. Bacteriol. 169, 5174-5179). In addition, significant homology was observed between the nucleotide sequences for the todDE genes and the sequences reported for cis-1,2-dihydroxy-6-phenylcyclohexa-3,5-diene dehydrogenase and 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl-1,2-dioxygenase from Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes KF707 (Furukawa, K., Arimura, N., and Miyazaki, T. (1987) J. Bacteriol. 169, 427-429).
TI  - A methyl-accepting protein is involved in benzoate taxis in Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - Pseudomonas putida is attracted to at least two groups of aromatic acids: a benzoate group and a benzoylformate group. Members of the benzoate group of chemoattractants stimulated the methylation of a P. putida polypeptide with an apparent molecular weight of 60,000 in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. This polypeptide is presumed to be a methyl-accepting chemotaxis protein for several reasons: its molecular weight is similar to the molecular weights of Escherichia coli methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins, the amount of time required to attain maximal methylation correlated with the time needed for behavioral adaptation of P. putida cells to benzoate, and methylation was stimulated by benzoate only in cells induced for chemotaxis to benzoate. Also, a mutant specifically defective in benzoate taxis failed to show any stimulation of methylation upon addition of benzoate. Benzoylformate did not stimulate protein methylation in cells induced for benzoylformate chemotaxis, suggesting that sensory input from this second group of aromatic-acid attractants is processed through a different kind of chemosensory pathway. The chemotactic responses of P. putida cells to benzoate and benzoylformate were not sensitive to external pH over a range (6.2 to 7.7) which would vary the protonated forms of these weak acids by a factor of about 30. This indicates that detection of cytoplasmic pH is not the basis for aromatic-acid taxis in P. putida.
TI  - Transcription initiation at multiple promoters of the pfl gene by E sigma 70-dependent transcription in vitro and heterologous expression in Pseudomonas putida in vivo.
AB  - In vitro transcription experiments were used to provide further evidence that the gene encoding pyruvate formate-lyase (EC 2.3.1.54) from Escherichia coli is transcribed from seven promoters which cover a region of 1.2 kilobase pairs of DNA (G. Sawers and A. Bock, J. Bacteriol., 171:2485-2498, 1989). The results demonstrated that all promoters were recognized by the major RNA polymerase holoenzyme species E sigma 70 in vitro. Further corroboration for multiple functional promoters came from heterologous expression of the pfl operon in the obligate aerobe Pseudomonas putida. An immunological analysis indicated that the pyruvate formate-lyase protein was synthesized from a multicopy plasmid in P. putida, and S1 nuclease protection of RNA transcripts confirmed that all the pfl promoters on the plasmid were recognized by the host RNA polymerase. Transcription initiated at the same sites in P. putida and in E. coli for all the transcripts that were analyzed.
TI  - Cloning of pMOL28-encoded nickel resistance genes and expression of the genes in  Alcaligenes eutrophus and Pseudomonas spp.
AB  - The 163-kilobase-pair (kb) plasmid pMOL28, which determines inducible resistance  to nickel, cobalt, chromate, and mercury salts in its native host Alcaligenes eutrophus CH34, was transferred to a derivative of A. eutrophus H16 and subjected to cloning procedures. After Tn5 transposon mutagenesis, restriction endonuclease analysis, and DNA-DNA hybridization, two DNA fragments, a 9.5-kb KpnI fragment and a 13.5-kb HindIII fragment (HKI), were isolated. HKI contained EK1, the KpnI fragment, as a subfragment flanked on both sides by short regions. Both fragments were ligated into the suicide vector pSUP202, the broad-host-range vector pVK101, and pUC19. Both fragments restored a nickel-sensitive Tn5 mutant to full nickel and cobalt resistance. The hybrid plasmid pVK101::HKI expressed full nickel resistance in all nickel-sensitive derivatives, either pMOL28-deficient or -defective, of the native host CH34. The hybrid plasmid pVK101::HKI also conferred nickel and cobalt resistance to A. eutrophus strains H16 and JMP222, Alcaligenes hydrogenophilus, Pseudomonas putida, and Pseudomonas oleovorans, but to a lower level of resistance. In all transconjugants the metal resistances coded by pVK101::HKI were expressed constitutively rather than inducibly. The hybrid plasmid metal resistance was not expressed in Escherichia coli. DNA sequences responsible for nickel resistance in newly isolated strains showed homology to the cloned pMOL28-encoded nickel and cobalt resistance determinant.
TI  - Characterization of five genes in the upper-pathway operon of TOL plasmid pWW0 from Pseudomonas putida and identification of the gene products.
AB  - The upper operon of the TOL plasmid pWW0 of Pseudomonas putida encodes a set of enzymes which transform toluene and xylenes to benzoate and toluates. The genetic organization of the operon was characterized by cloning of the upper operon genes into an expression vector and identification of their products in Escherichia coli maxicells. This analysis showed that the upper operon contains at least five genes in the order of xylC-xylM-xylA-xylB-xylN. Between the promoter of the operon and xylC, there is a 1.7-kilobase-long space of DNA in which no gene function was identified. In contrast, most of the DNA between xylC and xylN consists of coding sequences. The xylC gene encodes the 57-kilodalton benzaldehyde dehydrogenase. The xylM and xylA genes encode 35- and 40-kilodalton polypeptides, respectively, which were shown by genetic complementation tests to be subunits of xylene oxygenase. The structural gene for benzyl alcohol dehydrogenase, xylB, encodes a 40-kilodalton polypeptide. The last gene of this operon is xylN, which synthesizes a 52-kilodalton polypeptide of unknown function.
TI  - [Expression of the phospholipase C gene of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in Escherichia  coli and Pseudomonas].
AB  - The plc gene for phospholipase of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, able to be transcribed  only from its own promoter, has been introduced into Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas putida cells in the recombinant plasmid pPMS21 of a wide host range. The expression of plc gene in all recipient cells has been shown to be phosphate regulated. The fact emphasizes the identity of pho-regulation systems in Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas cells. The level of phospholipase activity is similar in Pseudomonas putida and Pseudomonas aeruginosa under the conditions of the gene derepression, while in Escherichia coli cells the level does not exceed 10% of activity registered in Pseudomonas cells.
TI  - Involvement of Pseudomonas putida RpoN sigma factor in regulation of various metabolic functions.
AB  - The RpoN protein was originally identified in Escherichia coli as a sigma (sigma) factor essential for the expression of nitrogen regulons. In the present study we cloned the Pseudomonas putida rpoN gene and identified its gene product as a protein with an apparent molecular weight of 78,000. A mutant rpoN gene was constructed by in vitro insertion mutagenesis with a kanamycin cassette. A P. putida rpoN mutant was then isolated by replacement of the intact chromosomal rpoN gene by the mutant rpoN gene through homologous recombination. Examination of the phenotypes of the P. putida rpoN mutant thus obtained allowed the identification of a series of metabolic functions whose expression depends upon the RpoN sigma factor. The rpoN mutation in P. putida affected the utilization by this organism of nitrate, urea, and uncharged amino acids, namely, alanine, glycine, isoleucine, leucine, and serine, as nitrogen sources. The mutation also affected the utilization of the above-mentioned amino acids, as well as lysine, C4-dicarboxylates (succinate, fumarate), and alpha-ketoglutarate, as carbon sources. In contrast to the P. putida wild-type strain, the rpoN mutant was nonmotile. The colony morphology of the mutant strain was different from that of the wild-type strain. Studies on the expression of the TOL plasmid catabolic operons in the mutant strain demonstrated that transcription from the upper-operon promoter and from the xylS gene promoter requires the RpoN sigma factor.
TI  - Identification of multiple repressor recognition sites in the hut system of Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - The hutC gene in Pseudomonas putida encodes a repressor protein that negatively regulates the expression of all hut genes. We have overexpressed this cloned hutC gene in Escherichia coli to identify P. putida hut regions that could specifically bind the repressor. Ten restriction fragments, some of which were partially overlapping and spanned the coding portions of the P. putida hut region, were labeled and tested for their ability to recognize repressor in a filter binding assay. This procedure identified three binding sites, thus supporting previous indications that there were multiple operons. A 1.0-kilobase-pair SalI restriction fragment contained the operator region for the hutUHIG operon, whereas a 1.9-kilobase-pair SmaI fragment contained the hutF operator. A 2.9-kilobase-pair XhoI segment appeared to contain the third operator, corresponding to a separate and perhaps little used control region for hutG expression only. The addition of urocanate, the normal inducer, caused dissociation of all operator-repressor complexes, whereas N-formylglutamate, capable of specifically inducing expression of the hutG gene, inhibited binding only of repressor to fragments containing that gene. Formylglutamate did not affect the action of urocanate on the repressor-hutUHIG operator complex, indicating that it binds to a site separate from urocanate on the repressor. DNA footprinting and gel retardation analyses were used to locate more precisely the operator for the hutUHIG operon. A roughly 40-base-pair portion was identified which contained a 16-base-pair region of dyad symmetry located near the transcription initiation site for this operon.
TI  - Cloning of a carbofuran hydrolase gene from Achromobacter sp. strain WM111 and its expression in gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - A 14-kilobase-pair (kbp) EcoRI DNA fragment that encodes an enzyme capable of rapid hydrolysis of N-methylcarbamate insecticides (carbofuran hydrolase) was cloned from carbofuran-degrading Achromobacter sp. strain WM111. When used to probe Southern blots containing plasmid and total DNAs from WM111, this 14-kbp fragment hybridized strongly to a 14-kbp EcoRI fragment from the greater than 100-kbp plasmid harbored by this strain but weakly to EcoRI-digested total DNA from Achromobacter sp. strain WM111, indicating that the gene for N-methylcarbamate degradation (mcd) is plasmid encoded. Further subcloning localized the mcd gene on a 3-kbp ScaI-ClaI fragment. There was little or no expression of this gene in the alternative gram-negative hosts Pseudomonas putida, Alcaligenes eutrophus, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and Achromobacter pestifer. Western blotting (immunoblotting) of the protein products produced by low-level expression in P. putida confirmed that this 3-kbp fragment encodes the two 70+-kilodalton protein products seen in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of purified carbofuran hydrolase.
TI  - A simple procedure for transferring genes cloned in Escherichia coli vectors into other gram-negative bacteria: phenotypic analysis and mapping of TOL plasmid gene xylK.
AB  - A simple method to transfer non-conjugative Escherichia coli plasmids to other Gram-negative bacteria and their maintenance is described. This method involves generation of inverse transposition-mediated cointegrates of the non-conjugative E. coli plasmid with a conjugative IncW broad-host-range plasmid, R388, carrying Tn10. Isolation of such cointegrates was readily effected by conjugal transfer from an E. coli donor containing the two plasmids to an E. coli recipient, with selection for transconjugants expressing a marker of the E. coli plasmid. This method is particularly useful when large series of E. coli vector-based clones need to be expressed in other Gram-negative bacteria to be functionally analysed, either by complementation or recombination. Utility of the method is shown by a functional analysis in Pseudomonas putida of pBR322 hybrid plasmids containing catabolic genes of TOL plasmid pWW0.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. A study mainly focused on ofloxacin (the second report). Reported by the Research Group for Testing ofloxacin Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - Susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (OFLX) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures throughout Japan between April, 1986 and March, 1987. The results were totalized with an emphasis mainly on OFLX and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. In this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. Similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to OFLX included Staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), Entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), Escherichia coli (4,097 strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), Enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), Enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), Citrobacter freundii (406 strains), Proteus mirabilis (613 strains), Morganella morganii (320 strains), Serratia marcescens (869 strains), Haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), Acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and Campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). Neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to OFLX was investigated with this species. As results, OFLX showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, E. aerogenes, C. freundii, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, H. influenzae, A. calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp., and C. jejuni. However, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. The following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: Streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), Streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), Enterococcus faecium (146 strains), Branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), Citrobacter diversus (128 strains), Klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), Proteus vulgaris (438 strains), Serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), Pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), Pseudomonas putida (154 strains), Xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), Vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), Bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),
TI  - Analysis of nonpolar insertion mutations in the trfA gene of IncP plasmid RK2 which affect its broad-host-range property.
AB  - Replication of broad-host-range plasmid RK2 requires the protein product(s) of the plasmid-encoded trfA gene to initiate replication at oriV, the vegetative replication origin. The trfA gene contains two translational starts which direct translation of two polypeptides, of 382 and 285 amino acids, which differ by the 97 amino acids at their N-terminus. Nonpolar insertions which abolish expression of the larger TrfA polypeptide but otherwise retain the trfA gene's normal expression signals severely reduce plasmid replication efficiency in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and to a lesser extent in Pseudomonas putida, but have very little effect in Escherichia coli. This indicates that the organization of the trfA gene, producing two polypeptides products, plays an important part in the broad-host-range of plasmid RK2 by providing a degree of flexibility in the way the plasmid's replication system interacts with host biochemistry.
TI  - Cloning of bacterial genes specifying degradation of 4-chlorobiphenyl from Pseudomonas putida OU83.
AB  - Genes capable of 4-chlorobiphenyl (4-CBP) degradation were cloned from 4-CBP-degrading Pseudomonas putida OU83 by using a genomic library which was constructed in the broad-host-range cosmid vector pCP13. P. putida AC812 containing chimeric cosmid-expressing enzymes involved in the 4-CBP degradation pathway were identified by detecting 3-phenylcatechol dioxygenase activity (3-PDA). Chimeric cosmid clones pOH83, pOH84, pOH85, pOH87, and pOH88 positive for 3-PDA grew in synthetic basal medium containing 4-CBP (5 mM) as a carbon source. Restriction digestion analysis of recombinant cosmids showed DNA inserts ranging from 6 to 30 kilobase pairs. Southern hybridization data revealed that the cloned DNA inserts originated from strain OU83. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of the metabolites of P. putida AC812(pOH88) incubated with 4-CBP and 4'-chloro-3-phenylcatechol showed the formation of 4-chlorobenzoic acid and benzoic acid. These results demonstrate that the cloned DNA fragments contain genes encoding for chlorobiphenyl dioxygenase (cbpA), dihydrodiol dehydrogenase (cbpB), 4'-chloro-3-phenylcatechol dioxygenase (cbpC), a meta-cleavage compound (a chloro derivative of 2-hydroxy-6-oxo-6-phenylhexa-2,4-dienoate) hydrolase (cbpD), and a new dechlorinating activity (dcpE). The location of the cbpC gene specifying 3-PDA was determined by subcloning an EcoRI DNA fragment (9.8 kilobase pairs) of pOH88 in plasmid vector pUC19. The cloned gene encoding 3-PDA was expressed in Escherichia coli HB101 and had substrate specificity only for 3-phenylcatechol and 4'-chloro-3-phenylcatechol.
TI  - Evidence that the transcription activator encoded by the Pseudomonas putida nahR  gene is evolutionarily related to the transcription activators encoded by the Rhizobium nodD genes.
AB  - The nahR gene of the 83-kilobase naphthalene degradation plasmid NAH7 of Pseudomonas putida encodes a 34-kilodalton polypeptide which binds to the nah and sal promoters to activate transcription of the degradation genes in response to the inducer salicylate. The DNA sequence of the nahR gene was determined, and a derived amino acid sequence of the NahR protein was obtained. A computer search for homologous proteins showed that within the first 124 amino-terminal residues, NahR has approximately 35% identity with the transcriptional activator proteins encoded by the nodD genes of Rhizobium species. Allowing for ultraconservative amino acid substitutions, greater than 47% overall similarity was found between NahR and NodD, while 32% similarity was found between NahR and another transcription activator, LysR of Escherichia coli. The region of greatest similarity among all three proteins contained a probable helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif as suggested by homology with the proposed consensus sequence for Cro-like DNA-binding domains. The high level of amino acid identity between NahR and NodD, in conjunction with the observations that nahR and nodD are 45% homologous in DNA sequence, are divergently transcribed from homologous promoters near the structural genes they control, and have similar DNA-binding sites, strongly suggests that these two genes evolved from a common ancestor.
TI  - In vivo enzymology: a deuterium NMR study of formaldehyde dismutase in Pseudomonas putida F61a and Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - High-resolution deuterium NMR spectroscopy has been used to follow the detoxifying metabolism of [D2]formaldehyde in vivo in several bacterial species. Production of [D2]methanol in Escherichia coli confirms that the oxidation and reduction pathways of metabolism are independent in this organism. Efficient production of equimolar quantities of [D]formate and [D3]methanol in Pseudomonas putida F61a and Staphylococcus aureus implicates a formaldehyde dismutase, or "cannizzarase", activity. These observations imply that the unusual formaldehyde resistance in P. putida F61a is a direct result of efficient dismutation acting as a route for detoxification. Cross-dismutation experiments yield an enzymic kinetic isotope effect of ca. 4 for H vs D transfer and a similar spectrum of substrate specificity to the isolated enzyme. [D]benzyl alcohol produced by cross-dismutation of [D2]formaldehyde and benzaldehyde in P. putida is demonstrated to have the R configuration by a novel deuterium NMR assay. Additionally, S. aureus produces methyl formate as a product of formaldehyde detoxification, apparently by oxidizing the methanol hemiacetal of formaldehyde.
TI  - Demonstration, characterization, and mutational analysis of NahR protein binding  to nah and sal promoters.
AB  - The nahR gene of plasmid NAH7 of Pseudomonas putida encodes a 36-kilodalton polypeptide which activates transcription of the nah and sal operons in response to the inducer salicylate. A gel mobility shift assay was used to identify a DNA-binding activity which was present only in extracts from either P. putida or Escherichia coli containing a functional nahR gene. The binding activity was highly specific for DNA containing the nah or sal promoters, but the apparent affinity for the promoters was not altered by the presence of salicylate. DNase I protection experiments with a partially purified NahR protein preparation showed that NahR protects both nah and sal promoter sequences between -82 and -47. The location and amount of protection were not dramatically altered by the presence of salicylate. In vitro mutagenesis was used to make mutations in the protected region of the sal promoter. Analysis of the mutants showed that binding of NahR is required for transcription activation and identified two nucleotides in the protected region that are essential for binding and activation by NahR.
TI  - [Cloning of Pseudomonas putida genes responsible for the primary stages of oxidation of naphthalene in Escherichia coli cells].
AB  - Data on cloning Pseudomonas putida D-plasmid pBS286 (IncP-9) genes which are responsible for primary stages of naphthalene oxidation as well as data on the expression of these genes in Escherichia coli cells are presented. Recombinant plasmid pBS959 containing the whole constitutive nahA locus encoding naphthalene dioxygenase, a key enzyme of the naphthalene oxidation pathway, has been constructed on the basis of the pUC19 vector. An evidence has been obtained that at least a portion of the sequence of structural nahB gene is cloned in the recombinant pBS959 plasmid. Constitutive expression of the nahA gene is controlled by its own promoter and leads to conversion of indole to indigo in E. coli cells, strain HB101. Plasmid pBS959 is characterized by high structural stability; some instability observed is due to segregation.
TI  - 5-Carboxymethyl-2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde dehydrogenases of Escherichia coli  C and Klebsiella pneumoniae M5a1 show very high N-terminal sequence homology.
AB  - 5-Carboxymethyl-2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde (CHMS) dehydrogenase from Escherichia coli C and Klebsiella pneumoniae M5a1 have been purified and some of their properties studied. The apparent Km values for NAD and CHMS were 11.7 +/- 1.5 microM and 5.2 +/- 1.9 microM, respectively, for the K. pneumoniae enzyme, and 19.5 +/- 2.7 microM and 9.2 +/- 1.4 microM, respectively, for the E. coli enzyme. Both enzymes were optimally active at pH 7.5 in sodium phosphate buffer. They had subunit molecular weights of 52,000 (+/- 1000) and the native enzymes appeared to be dimers of identical subunits. The first 20 residues of their N-terminal amino acid sequences were 90% homologous. A degenerate oligonucleotide probe constructed to a six amino acid sequence common to both enzymes gave strong hybridization with DNA from E. coli strains B and W as well as with E. coli C and K. pneumoniae but little or no hybridization to DNA from E. coli K12 or Pseudomonas putida.
TI  - Cloning and expression in Escherichia coli of the toluene dioxygenase gene from Pseudomonas putida NCIB11767.
AB  - The genes encoding toluene dioxygenase, toluene cis-glycol dehydrogenase and catechol 2.3-oxygenase from Pseudomonas putida NCIB 11767 were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli HB101 on a 20 kb fragment. The recombinant strain produced indigo and a variety of other coloured products. Although the enzymes were expressed in the absence of inducers, further induction was observed in the presence of toluene or benzene, implying the presence of regulatory elements on the 20 kb insert.
TI  - Structure of the dnaA region of Pseudomonas putida: conservation among three bacteria, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli and P. putida.
AB  - We have cloned from Pseudomonas putida a gene homologous to Escherichia coli dnaA, and determined the sequence of the gene and its neighboring region. The dnaA gene and at least three other genes, dnaN, recF and gyrB, were found to be highly homologous to the genes in the dnaA regions of the E. coli and Bacillus subtilis chromosomes. A non-translatable region of some 600 bp immediately upstream of the dnaA gene is also conserved in the three bacteria and contains 3, 12, and 14 DnaA-boxes (TTATCCACA and closely related sequences) in E. coli, P. putida and B. subtilis, respectively. The present results confirm our hypothesis that the dnaA region is the replication origin region of the ancestral bacterium and that the essential feature of the dnaA and DnaA-box combination is conserved in most eubacteria and plays a central role in initiation of chromosomal replication.
TI  - [Production of antibiotic substances by natural variants of the marine bacterium  Vibrio Fischeri].
AB  - It was shown that under definite conditions there was competition between natural variants of sea bacteria belonging to V. fischeri. Natural variants of V. fischeri, strain 6 differed in their resistance to streptomycin and had different growth rates under conditions of limited aeration. Morphologically all the variants were identical. V. fischeri P-0, V. fischeri P-1 and V. fischeri P-2 were studied. The study revealed that V. fischeri P-0 produced a non-dialysing thermostable trypsin-sensitive substance inhibiting the growth of V. fischeri P-1 and V. fischeri P-2. The maximum activity of the antibacterial substance was observed when V. fischeri P-0 was grown in a liquid medium with peptone and yeast extract without agitation at 26 degrees C. The inhibiting substance was also active against V. fischeri BKM B995 and V. fischeri P-7 isolated as a result of V. fischeri P-0 exposure to ethidium bromide. The substance had no effect on the following bacterial species: Aeromonas liquefaciens 301, Achromobacter liquefaciens, Pseudomonas putida 15, Pseudomonas fluorescence 7, Escherichia coli AH-32 and Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Extracellular product of Nocardia amarae induces bacterial cell flocculation.
AB  - The fact that Nocardia amarae YK1 produced a bacterial flocculation-inducing substance (designated as FIX) was discovered. FIX had a function of flocculating proliferous cells. FIX-induced flocculation was inhibited by making cells resting, but not completely by adding chloramphenicol. FIX worked widely on Gram-positive to -negative bacteria. In the presence of FIX, Achromobacter cycloclastus IAM1013, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus IAM1517, Bacillus subtilis IAM1069, Escherichia coli C600-1, E. coli IAM1239, Flavobacterium lutescens IAM1667, Klebsiella pneumoniae IAM1102, Micrococcus luteus IAM1313 and Pseudomonas putida IAM1002 formed flocs. B. cereus IAM1029, however, exhibited no flocculation.
TI  - Omegon-Km: a transposable element designed for in vivo insertional mutagenesis and cloning of genes in gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - To combine the features of the omega interposons with the advantages of in vivo transposition mutagenesis, we have constructed an artificial transposon, called Omegon-Km. The Omegon-Km transposon is carried on the plasmid pJFF350 which can be conjugally mobilized into a broad range of Gram-negative bacteria. Omegon-Km is flanked, in inverted orientation, by synthetic 28-bp repeats derived from the ends of IS1. In addition, each end of Omegon-Km has the very efficient transcription and translation terminators of the omega interposon. Internally, Omegon-Km carries the selectable kanamycin (Km)-neomycin resistance gene (alph A) which is expressed well in many Gram-negative bacteria. The IS1 transposition functions are located on the donor plasmid but external to Omegon-Km. Thus, insertions of Omegon-Km are very stable because they lack the capacity for further transposition. Omegon-Km mutagenesis is performed by conjugal transfer of pJFF350 from Escherichia coli into any Gram-negative recipient strain in which this plasmid is unable to replicate. Those cells which have had a transposition event are selected by their resistance to Km. Very high frequencies of Omegon-Km transposition were observed in Pseudomonas putida. Preliminary experiments with other Gram-negative soil and water bacteria (Rhizobium leguminosarum, Paracoccus denitrificans) yielded mutants at reasonable levels. The presence of an E. coli-specific origin of replication (ori) within Omegon-Km allows the rapid and easy cloning, in E. coli, of the nucleotide sequences flanking the site of the transposition event.
TI  - Cloning and analysis of genes involved in coenzyme B12 biosynthesis in Pseudomonas denitrificans.
AB  - Cobalamin synthesis probably requires 20 to 30 different enzymatic steps. Pseudomonas putida and Agrobacterium tumefaciens mutants deficient in cobalamin synthesis (Cob have been isolated. In P. putida, Cob mutants were identified as being unable to use ethanolamine as a source of nitrogen in the absence of added cobalamin (deamination of ethanolamine requires coenzyme B12 as a cofactor). In A. tumefaciens, Cob mutants were simply screened for their reduced cobalamin synthesis. A genomic library of Pseudomonas denitrificans was constructed on a mobilizable wide-host-range vector. Eleven plasmids from this library were able to complement most of these mutants. By complementation and restriction mapping analysis, four genomic loci of P. denitrificans were found to be responsible for complementation of the Cob mutants. By subcloning fragments from the four genomic loci, we identified at least 14 different genes involved in cobalamin synthesis.
TI  - Occurrence, transfer and mobilization in epilithic strains of Acinetobacter of mercury-resistance plasmids capable of transformation.
AB  - A 7.8 kb plasmid (pQM17) encoding mercury resistance was isolated from two epilithic strains of Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. The plasmid had a broad host range when mobilized by RP1, transferring into Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. putida, P. fluorescens, Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris and Chromobacterium sp. with frequencies ranging from 5.3 x 10(-9) to 4.6 x 10(-4) per recipient. The plasmid could be transferred into A. calcoaceticus BD413 using intact cells of donor and recipient bacteria (i.e. natural transformation) and there was a broad temperature optimum (14-37 degrees C) for transformation. Transformation was as efficient in liquid matings as on plates but there was no effect of pH in the range 5.6-7.9. Maximum transformation frequencies were obtained after 24 h on agar plates containing 3.5-10 g C 1-1 with donor to recipient ratios ranging from 6 to 415.
TI  - Cloning and expression of pca genes from Pseudomonas putida in Escherichia coli.
AB  - Beta-Ketoadipate elicits expression of five structural pca genes encoding enzymes that catalyse consecutive reactions in the utilization of protocatechuate by Pseudomonas putida. Three derivatives of P. putida PRS2000 were obtained, each carrying a single copy of Tn5 DNA inserted into a separate region of the genome and preventing expression of different sets of pca genes. Selection of Tn5 in or near the pca genes in these derivatives was used to clone four structural pca genes and to enable their expression as inserts in pUC19 carried in Escherichia coli. Three of the genes were clustered as components of an apparent operon in the order pcaBDC. This observation indicates that rearrangement of the closely linked genes accompanied divergence of their evolutionary homologues, which are known to appear in the order pcaDBC in the Acinetobacter calcoaceticus pcaEFDBCA gene cluster. Additional evidence for genetic reorganization during evolutionary divergence emerged from the demonstration that the P. putida pcaE gene lies more than 15 kilobase pairs (kbp) away from the pcaBDC operon. An additional P. putida gene, pcaR, was shown to be required for expression of the pca structural genes in response to beta-ketoadipate. The regulatory pcaR gene is located about 15 kbp upstream from the pcaBDC operon.
TI  - [Nucleotide sequence of the rpoC-gene coding for RNA polymerase beta'-subunit of  Pseudomonas putida].
AB  
TI  - Molecular cloning of 3-phenylcatechol dioxygenase involved in the catabolic pathway of chlorinated biphenyl from Pseudomonas putida and its expression in Escherichia coli.
AB  - Genes encoding 3-phenylcatechol dioxygenases were cloned from the chlorobiphenyl-degrading Pseudomonas putida strain OU83, using broad-host-range cosmid vector pCP13. Restriction enzyme analysis of DNA from 2,3-dioxygenase-positive chimeric cosmids showed DNA inserts ranging in size from 6.0 to 30 kilobases. The origin of the DNA insert in hybrid clones was established by using 32P-labeled hybrid clones (pOH101 and pOH810). A 2.3-kilobase HindIII fragment was common to two clones. The 2,3-dioxygenase from the parent P. putida strain, OU83, and the recombinant clones (pOH101 and pOH8101) showed similar characteristics as determined by isoelectric focusing and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The 2,3-dioxygenase from the Escherichia coli recombinant cosmid showed a pI of 5.0, a Km of 14 microM, and broad substrate activity with catechol, 4-chlorocatechol, 4-methylcatechol, and 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl.
TI  - Comparison of the meta pathway operons on NAH plasmid pWW60-22 and TOL plasmid pWW53-4 and its evolutionary significance.
AB  - The regulated meta pathway operon for the catabolism of salicylate on the naphthalene plasmid pWW60-22 was cloned into the broad-host-range vector pKT230 on a 17.5 kbp BamHI fragment. The recombinant plasmid conferred the ability to grow on salicylate when mobilized into plasmid-free Pseudomonas putida PaW130. A detailed restriction map of the insert was derived and the locations of some of the genes were determined by subcloning and assaying for their gene products in Escherichia coli and P. putida hosts. The existence of a regulatory gene was demonstrated by the induction of enzyme activities in the presence of salicylate. DNA-DNA hybridization indicated a high degree of structural homology between the pWW60-22 operon and the analogous meta pathway operon on TOL plasmid pWW53-4. The data are consistent with the structural genes being arranged in an identical linear array and suggest an evolutionary link between the two catabolic systems.
TI  - Similarity of the E1 subunits of branched-chain-oxoacid dehydrogenase from Pseudomonas putida to the corresponding subunits of mammalian branched-chain-oxoacid and pyruvate dehydrogenases.
AB  - The genes encoding proteins responsible for activity of the E1 component of branched-chain-oxoacid dehydrogenase of Pseudomonas putida have been subcloned and the nucleotide sequence of this region determined. Open reading frames encoding E1 alpha (bkdA1, 1233 bp) and E1 beta (bkdA2, 1020 bp) were identified with the aid of the N-terminal sequence of the purified subunits. The Mr of E1 alpha was 45,158 and of E1 beta was 37,007, both calculated without N-terminal methionine. The deduced amino acid sequences of E1 alpha and E1 beta had no similarity to the published sequences of the E1 subunits of pyruvate and 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenases of Escherichia coli. However, there was substantial similarity between the E1 alpha subunits of Pseudomonas and rat liver branched-chain-oxoacid dehydrogenases. In particular, the region of the E1 alpha subunit of the mammalian branched-chain-oxoacid dehydrogenase which is phosphorylated, was found to be highly conserved in the Pseudomonas E1 alpha subunit. There was also considerable similarity between the E1 beta subunits of Pseudomonas branched-chain-oxoacid dehydrogenase and human pyruvate dehydrogenase.
TI  - Alkane utilization in Pseudomonas oleovorans. Structure and function of the regulatory locus alkR.
AB  - The OCT plasmid-localized alkBAC operon encodes enzymes for alkane hydroxylation  and alkanol dehydrogenation. The positively controlled expression of the operon is very efficient in both Pseudomonas putida and Escherichia coli. Two regulatory functions have been ascribed to the regulatory locus alkR: inducer recognition and transcriptional activation of the operon. We have cloned and localized the alkR locus on a 4.9-kilobase pair SalI fragment. The alkR region was analyzed for translation productions in E. coli minicells. Two proteins were identified: a 99- and a 48-kDa peptide. The positions of the cistrons encoding these proteins were established. Both cistrons were shown to be essential for an Alk phenotype. The first cistron (alkS), which encodes the 99-kDa protein, complemented alkR mutations affecting inducer specificity. Furthermore, we found that alkS is responsible for activation of expression of the alkBAC operon since it is required for the induction of the alkB gene product alkane hydroxylase. The second cistron (alkT), which encodes the 48-kDa protein, is required for reconstitution of an Alk phenotype but has no function in regulation of alkBAC expression. Thus, the expression of the alkBAC operon is regulated by a 99-kDa protein, whereas the 48-kDa protein is probably a component of the alkane hydroxylase complex.
TI  - Physical and functional mapping of two cointegrate plasmids derived from RP4 and  TOL plasmid pDK1.
AB  - Cointegrate plasmids were formed in vivo between the broad-host-range R-plasmid RP4 and two catabolic plasmids derived from Pseudomonas putida HS1. One of these was the wild-type plasmid pDK1 encoding the complete inducible toluene/xylene (TOL) catabolic pathway and one was pDKT1, a deletion derivative of pDK1 selected after growth of HS1 on benzoate and supporting growth on only toluene. The two plasmids formed, pDK2 and pDKT2 respectively, each consisted of a complete RP4 replicon in which was an insert of the parent plasmid DNA respectively 40 and 20 kbp in size. The detailed restriction maps of the two plasmids were determined and many of the catabolic genes were located by subcloning and enzyme assay of recombinant plasmids in Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas hosts. The insert in pDK2 contained both operons of the catabolic pathway, the 'upper pathway' operon (xylCAB) and the meta pathway operon (xylDLEGF(I,J,K)H), and a region identified as having the function of the regulator gene xylS. The insert in pDKT2 contained only the upper pathway operon and the regulatory region. Within each of the three coding regions there was great similarity with the same regions on TOL plasmids pWW0 and pWW53-4 apparent (a) by the same order of the genes, (b) by a similar pattern of restriction sites and (c) by hybridization studies. However, the order and orientations of the three coding regions differed from those previously described for both pWW0 and pWW53-4. The significance of these findings to the evolution of TOL plasmids is discussed.
TI  - [Cloning and expression of Pseudomonas putida gene controlling the catechol-2,3-oxygenase activity in Escherichia coli cells].
AB  - The genes nahC and nahD from Pseudomonas putida naphthalene degradation plasmid pBS286 were cloned on the vector pUC19 in Escherichia coli cells. The catechol-2,3-oxygenase activity observed in E. coli cells containing recombinant plasmid pBS955 demands the participation of 32 kD polypeptide which is apparently the product of the nahC gene. Second polypeptide of molecular weight 34.5 kD is synthesized in pBS955 containing E. coli minicells and perhaps it is a nahD gene product. The data obtained indicate that 1,2-dihydroxynaphthalene dioxygenase possesses a relaxed substrate specificity, at least, when cloned on a multicopy vector. The cloned DNA insert of pBS955 is not likely to contain its own promoter, so that expression of nahC and nahD genes from the nah1 operon is controlled by the vector lac promoter. The direction of transcription and localization of both polypeptides on the pBS955 map are determined.
TI  - Comparison of the amino acid sequences of the transacylase components of branched chain oxoacid dehydrogenase of Pseudomonas putida, and the pyruvate and 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenases of Escherichia coli.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of bkdB, the structural gene for E2b, the transacylase component of branched-chain-oxoacid dehydrogenase of Pseudomonas putida has been determined and translated into its amino acid sequence. The start of bkdB was identified from the N-terminal sequence of E2b isolated from branched-chain-oxoacid dehydrogenase of the closely related species, P. aeruginosa. The reading frame was composed of 65.5% G + C with 82.3% of the codons ending in G or C. There was no intergenic space between bkdA2 and bkdB. No codons requiring minor tRNAs were utilized and the codon bias index indicated a preferential codon usage. The bkdB gene encoded 423 amino acids although the N-terminal methionine was absent from E2b prepared from P. aeruginosa. The relative molecular mass of the encoded protein was 45,134 (45,003 minus methionine) vs 47,000 obtained by SDS/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. There was a single lipoyl domain in E2b compared to three lipoyl domains in E2p, and one domain in E2o, the transacylases of pyruvate and 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenases of Escherichia coli respectively. There was significant similarity between the lipoyl domain of E2b and of E2p and E2o as well as between the E1-E2 binding domains of E2b, E2p and E2o. There was no similarity between the E3 binding domain of E2b to E2p and E2o which may reflect the uniqueness of the E3 component of branched-chain-oxoacid dehydrogenase of P. putida. The conclusions drawn from these comparisons are that the transacylases of prokaryotic pyruvate, 2-oxoglutarate and branched-chain-oxoacid dehydrogenases descended from a common ancestral protein probably at about the same time.
TI  - Organization and multiple regulation of histidine utilization genes in Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - The arrangement of the histidine utilization (hut) genes in Pseudomonas putida was established by examining the structure of a DNA segment that had been cloned into Escherichia coli via a cosmid vector. Southern blot analysis revealed that the restriction patterns of the hut genes cloned into E. coli and present in the P. putida genome were identical, indicating that no detectable DNA rearrangement took place during the cloning. Expression of the hut genes from a series of overlapping clones indicated the gene order to be hutG-hutI-hutH-hutU-hutC-hutF. The transcription directions of the different hut genes were determined by cloning the genes under control of the lambda pL promoter. This showed that hutF, encoding formiminoglutamate hydrolase, was transcribed in a direction opposite to that of the other genes. Inactivation of the cloned hut genes by Tn1000 insertion revealed that the hut genes were divided into three major transcriptional units (hutF, hutC [the repressor gene], and hut UHIG), but hutG may also be independently transcribed. When cloned individually with hutC on the same vector, hutF and hutU (which encodes urocanase) expression was induced by urocanate, indicating that these two genes each possess an operator-promoter element. Tn1000 insertions (in the cloned genes) or Tn5 insertions (in the P. putida genome) affecting the hutI or hutH gene only partially eliminated hutG expression. Furthermore, hutG, which specifies N-formylglutamate amidohydrolase, was regulated by the hutC product when the two genes were cloned on the same vector and expressed in E. coli. Therefore, hutG can be expressed independently from its own promoter, in keeping with earlier observations that N-formylglutamate amidohydrolase synthesis is not coordinated with that of urocanase and histidase and can be induced by N-formylglutamate or urocanate.
TI  - The complete amino acid sequence and identification of the active-site arginine peptide of Escherichia coli 2-keto-4-hydroxyglutarate aldolase.
AB  - The complete amino acid sequence of 2-keto-4-hydroxyglutarate aldolase from Escherichia coli has been established in the following manner. After being reduced with dithiothreitol, the purified aldolase was alkylated with iodoacetamide and subsequently digested with trypsin. The resulting 19 peptide peaks observed by high performance liquid chromatography, which compared with 21 expected tryptic cleavage products, were all isolated, purified, and individually sequenced. Overlap peptides were obtained by a combination of sequencing the N-terminal region of the intact aldolase and by cleaving the intact enzyme with cyanogen bromide followed by subdigestion of the three major cyanogen bromide peptides with either Staphylococcus aureus V8 endoproteinase, endoproteinase Lys C, or trypsin after citraconylation of lysine residues. The primary structure of the molecule was determined to be as follows. (formula; see text) 2-Keto-4-hydroxyglutarate aldolase from E. coli consists of 213 amino acids with a subunit and a trimer molecular weight of 22,286 and 66,858, respectively. No microheterogeneity is observed among the three subunits. The peptide containing the active-site arginine residue (Vlahos, C. J., Ghalambor, M. A., and Dekker, E. E. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 5480-5485) was also isolated and sequenced; this arginine residue occupies position 49. The Schiff base-forming lysine residue (Vlahos, C. J., and Dekker, E. E. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 11049-11055) is located at position 133. Whereas the active-site lysine peptide of this aldolase shows 65% homology with the same peptide of 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate aldolase from Pseudomonas putida, these two proteins in toto show 49% homology.
TI  - Stability fluctuations of plasmid-bearing cells: immobilization effects.
AB  - The maintenance of the plasmid vectors pTG201 and pTG206 (which both carry the Pseudomonas putida xylE gene) and pB lambda H3 in Escherichia coli hosts was studied in free and immobilized continuous cultures. pTG201, containing the strong lambda PR promoter, was more quickly lost than plasmid pTG206, containing the tetracycline resistance gene promoter. The instability of pTG201 seems to be related to high expression of the cloned xylE genet. Fluctuations in the proportion of pTG201-containing cells were observed in the free system, suggesting the appearance of adaptive descendants (with and without plasmid) from the initial strains. The loss of plasmid vectors from E. coli cells and the fluctuations in the proportion of plasmid-containing cells could be prevented by immobilizing plasmid-containing bacteria in carrageenan gel beads.
TI  - Benzoate-dependent induction from the OP2 operator-promoter region of the TOL plasmid pWWO in the absence of known plasmid regulatory genes.
AB  - Expression of the lower catabolic pathway of the TOL plasmid pWWO requires an aromatic acid inducer and the product of the xylS regulatory gene. Pseudomonas putida cells transformed with a plasmid containing the operator-promoter region of the lower pathway (OP2 [or Pm]), upstream from the catechol 2,3-dioxygenase structural gene, showed enzyme induction in the absence of known TOL plasmid regulatory genes. Induction was not seen in transformed Escherichia coli cells or in a P. putida mutant lacking chromosomally encoded benzoate catabolic functions.
TI  - Cosmid cloning of five Zymomonas trp genes by complementation of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida trp mutants.
AB  - A library of Zymomonas mobilis genomic DNA was constructed in the broad-host-range cosmid pLAFR1. The library was mobilized into a variety of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida trp mutants by using the helper plasmid pRK2013. Five Z. mobilis trp genes were identified by the ability to complement the trp mutants. The trpF, trpB, and trpA genes were on one cosmid, while the trpD and trpC genes were on two separate cosmids. The organization of the Z. mobilis trp genes seems to be similar to the organization found in Rhizobium spp., Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and Pseudomonas acidovorans. The trpF, trpB, and trpA genes appeared to be linked, but they were not closely associated with trpD or trpC genes.
TI  - [Cloning and localization of the replication and mobilization regions in the D-plasmid of Pseudomonas putida pBS286 (IncP-9) with a broad host range].
AB  - Rep-mob loci of naphthalene degradative plasmid pBS286 (IncP-9) have been cloned  on the Escherichia coli vectors pUC19 and pUBR322. These loci confer to recombinant plasmids pBS952 and pBS953 the ability for effective mobilization by RP4 (IncP-1) and F plasmid, as well as constant maintenance in various gram-negative bacteria. Localization of cloned sequences in the restriction fragments of conservative part of the pBS286 genome was established. The data obtained correlate with the analysis of plasmids pBS950 and pBS951 which are spontaneous mini-derivatives of pBS286 and pBS292 (delta NPL1::Tn1/Tra+ Nah-) plasmids formed during transformation of E. coli HB101 cells. Plasmids pBS952 and pBS953 retain the incompatibility properties of parental IncP-9 replicon. These recombinant derivatives can be used for construction of bhr vectors with required properties and compatible with bhr vectors constructed on the basis of plasmids from the IncP-1 and IncP-4 groups.
TI  - Transformation of bacteria with plasmid DNA by electroporation.
AB  - The possibility of electric field-mediated transformation ("electroporation") of  a gram-positive bacterium (Enterococcus faecalis) and two gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida) with plasmid DNA was investigated. E. faecalis protoplasts could be transformed by electroporation with a transformation frequency of 10(4) to 10(5) transformants/micrograms plasmid. Untreated--i.e., washed--cells of E. coli could be transformed with rates of 1 X 10(5) transformants/micrograms plasmid DNA. Transformation rates for P. putida cells were up to 3 X 10(4) if the method developed for E. coli was used. Detailed protocols for these systems, including the results of various optimization experiments, are given.
TI  - [Genes encoding bacterial RNA-polymerase. I. Cloning of rpoBC-operon of Pseudomonas putida and its physical map].
AB  - The P. putida rpoBC operon, coding for beta and beta' subunits of RNA polymerase, was cloned and its physical map constructed.
TI  - Genetic organization and transcriptional analysis of a major gene cluster involved in siderophore biosynthesis in Pseudomonas putida WCS358.
AB  - In iron-limited environments, the plant-growth-stimulating Pseudomonas putida WCS358 produces a yellow-green fluorescent siderophore called pseudobactin 358. The transcriptional organization and the iron-regulated expression of a major gene cluster involved in the biosynthesis and transport of pseudobactin 358 were analyzed in detail. The cluster comprises a region with a minimum length of 33.5 kilobases and contains at least five transcriptional units, of which some are relatively large. The directions of transcription of four transcriptional units were determined by RNA-RNA hybridization and by analysis in Escherichia coli minicells. The latter also demonstrated that large polypeptides were encoded by these transcriptional units. The results allowed us to localize several promoter regions on the DNA. The iron-dependent expression of at least two genes within this cluster appears to be regulated at the transcriptional level.
TI  - Construction of a shuttle vector for inducible gene expression in Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis.
AB  - The construction of a shuttle vector for inducible gene expression allowing fast  and easy cloning in Escherichia coli and subsequent transformation of Bacillus subtilis is presented. The expression is based on the regulation of the tac promoter by the Lac repressor which was assayed with the xylE gene from Pseudomonas putida as a marker gene. The lacIq gene, transcribed by the strong spo promoter, allowed full repression of the weak tac promoter.
TI  - Cloning, DNA sequence analysis, and expression in Escherichia coli of the gene for mandelate racemase from Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - The gene for mandelate racemase (EC 5.1.2.2) from Pseudomonas putida (ATCC 12633) was cloned in Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 15692). The selection for the cloned gene was based upon the inability of P. aeruginosa to grow on (R)-mandelate as sole carbon source by virtue of the absence of mandelate racemase in its mandelate pathway. Fragments of P. putida DNA obtained by digestion of chromosomal DNA with Sau3A were ligated into the BamHI site of the Gram-negative vector pKT230 and transformed into the P. aeruginosa host. A transformant able to utilize (R)-mandelate as sole carbon source was characterized, and the plasmid was found to contain approximately five kilobase pairs of P. putida DNA. Subcloning of this DNA revealed the position of the gene for the racemase within the cloned DNA from P. putida. The dideoxy-DNA sequencing procedure was used to determine the sequence of the gene and its translated sequence. The amino acid sequence and molecular weight for mandelate racemase deduced from the gene sequence (38 570) are in excellent agreement with amino acid composition and molecular weight data for the polypeptide recently determined with enzyme isolated from P. putida; these recent determinations of the polypeptide molecular weight differ significantly from the originally reported value of 69,500 [Fee, Judith A., Hegeman, G.D., & Kenyon, G.L. (1974) Biochemistry 13,2528], which was used to demonstrate that alpha-phenylglycidate, an active site directed irreversible inhibitor, binds to the enzyme with a stoichiometry of 1:1.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Physiological comparison of D-cysteine desulfhydrase of Escherichia coli with 3-chloro-D-alanine dehydrochlorinase of Pseudomonas putida CR 1-1.
AB  - D-Cysteine desulfhydrase of Escherichia coli W3110 delta trpED102/F' delta trpED102 was physiologically characterized. It was found to be located in the cytosolic fraction, as 3-chloro-D-alanine dehydrochlorinase is. D-Cysteine desulfhydrase catalyzed not only the alpha, beta-elimination reaction of O-acetyl-D-serine to form pyruvate, acetic acid and ammonia, but also the beta-replacement reaction of O-acetyl-D-serine with sulfide to form D-cysteine. However, these reactions appeared not to proceed in vivo. No other activity of D-cysteine synthesis from O-acetyl-D-serine and sulfide was detected in a crude cell extract of E. coli which was immunotitrated with antibodies raised against the purified D-cysteine desulfhydrase. Although D-cysteine desulfhydrase catalyzes the degradation (alpha, beta-elimination reaction) of 3-chloro-D-alanine, which is an effective antibacterial agent, E. coli W3110 delta trpED102/F' delta trpED102 did not show resistance against 3-chloro-D-alanine. Therefore, D-cysteine desulfhydrase does not contribute to 3-chloro-D-alanine detoxification in vivo.

TI  - [Nucleotide sequence of of rpoB gene encoding the RNA-polymerase beta-subunit in  Pseudomonas putida].
AB  
TI  - Transcription of the fimbrial subunit gene and an associated transfer RNA gene of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - Gene fimA encoding the structural subunit of the fimbriae of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAK is located in the centre of a 1.2-kb HindIII genomic DNA fragment [see also Sastry et al., J. Bacteriol. 164 (1985) 571-577], which in turn is located within a 6.2-kb EcoRI fragment. Immediately downstream from fimA is a putative threonine tRNA gene [Dalrymple and Mattick, Biochem. Int. 13 (1986) 547-553]. Northern blotting experiments showed that fimA is transcribed to an mRNA of approx. 650 nucleotides, which also includes the threonine tRNA sequence but no other protein-coding region. There was no indication that this mRNA is processed to release the tRNA sequence. However, the tRNA did appear to be expressed independently from its own promoter in the region 3' to fimA. When these sequences were introduced into Pseudomonas putida, we found that the level of expression of fimA from the cloned 6.2-kb EcoRI fragment was approx. 30-fold greater than that from the smaller HindIII fragment, whereas that of the specific tRNA species was unaltered. The size of the fimA transcript was also unaltered. These results provide evidence that the fimA gene is subject to specific transcriptional activation in vivo and that this activation involves sequences flanking the 1.2-kb HindIII fragment.
TI  - Controlled and functional expression of the Pseudomonas oleovorans alkane utilizing system in Pseudomonas putida and Escherichia coli.
AB  - The OCT plasmid encodes enzymes for alkane hydroxylation and alkanol dehydrogenation. Structural components are encoded on the 7.5-kilobase pair alkBAC operon, whereas positive regulatory components are encoded by alkR. We have constructed plasmids containing fusions of cloned alkBAC and alkR DNA and used these fusion plasmids to study the functional expression of the alkBAC operon and the regulatory locus alkR in Pseudomonas putida and in Escherichia coli. Growth on alkanes requires a functional chromosomally encoded fatty acid degradation system in addition to the plasmid-borne alk system. While such a system is active in P. putida, it is active in E. coli only in fadR mutants in which fatty acid degradation enzymes are expressed constitutively. Using such mutants, we found that E. coli as well as P. putida grew on octane as the sole source of carbon and energy when they were supplied with the cloned complete alk system. The alkR locus was strictly necessary in E. coli as well as in P. putida for expression of the alkBAC operon. The alkBAC operon could, however, be further reduced to a 5-kilobase pair operon without affecting the Alk phenotype in either species to a significant extent. Although with this reduction the plasmid-encoded alkanol dehydrogenase activity was lost, chromosomally encoded alkanol dehydrogenases in P. putida and E. coli compensated for this loss. The induction kinetics of the alk system was studied in detail in P. putida and E. coli. We used specific antibodies raised against alkane hydroxylase to follow the appearance of this protein following induction with octane. We found the induction kinetics of alkane hydroxylase to be similar in both species. A steady-state level was reached after about 2 h of induction in which time the alkane hydroxylase accounted for about 1.5% of total newly synthesized protein. Thus, alkBAC expression is very efficient and strictly regulated to both P. putida and E. coli.
TI  - Nucleotide sequencing and characterization of the genes encoding benzene oxidation enzymes of Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of the genes from Pseudomonas putida encoding oxidation of benzene to catechol was determined. Five open reading frames were found in the sequence. Four corresponding protein molecules were detected by a DNA-directed in vitro translation system. Escherichia coli cells containing the fragment with the four open reading frames transformed benzene to cis-benzene glycol, which is an intermediate of the oxidation of benzene to catechol. The relation between the product of each cistron and the components of the benzene oxidation enzyme system is discussed.
TI  - [Molecular genetic organization and origin of plasmid pBS52 with a broad range of bacterial hosts].
AB  - The data are presented on the localization of genetic determinants of resistance  to streptomycin, ampicillin and sulfanilamides on the physical map of conjugative R plasmid pBS52 of 38,000 bp which has a broad bacterial host range and belongs to a new incompatibility group. The plasmid has a natural "polylinker" site (less than 200 bp) containing (in the order of arrangement) the recognition sites for restriction enzymes: BamHI-EcoRI-PstI-EcoRV-BglII (PvuII). The comparative analysis shows that pBS52 contains a segment homologous to DNA of plasmid RSE1010 (IncP-4). The evolutionary origin of plasmid pBS52 is discussed. The recA-independent formation of the mini-derivatives of pBS373 and pBS374 types during the transformation of Escherichia coli with pBS52 plasmid DNA has been shown. Plasmids pBS373 and yBS374 are capable of autonomous replication in Pseudomonas putida and P. aeruginosa cells, which is provided by the rep system of IncP-4 replicon.
TI  - Purification and properties of formylglutamate amidohydrolase from Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - Formylglutamate amidohydrolase (FGase) catalyzes the terminal reaction in the five-step pathway for histidine utilization in Pseudomonas putida. By this action, N-formyl-L-glutamate (FG) is hydrolyzed to produce L-glutamate plus formate. Urocanate, the first product in the pathway, induced all five enzymes, but FG was able to induce FGase alone, although less efficiently than urocanate did. This induction by FG resulted in the formation of an FGase with electrophoretic mobility identical to that of the FGase induced by urocanate. A 9.6-kilobase-pair HindIII DNA fragment containing the P. putida FGase gene was cloned into the corresponding site on plasmid pBEU1 maintained in Escherichia coli. Insertion of the fragment in either orientation on the vector resulted in expression, but a higher level was noted in one direction, suggesting that the FGase gene can be expressed from either of two vector promoters with different efficiencies or from a single vector promoter in addition to a less efficient Pseudomonas promoter. FGase was purified 1,110-fold from the higher-expression clone in a yield of 10% through six steps. Divalent metal ions stimulated activity, and among those tested (Co, Fe, Zn, Ca, Ni, Cd, Mn, and Mg), Co(II) was the best activator, followed by Fe(II). FGase exhibited a Km of 14 mM for FG and a specific activity of 100 mumol/min per mg of protein in the presence of 5 mM substrate and 0.8 mM CoCl2 at 30 degrees C. The enzyme was maximally active in the range of pH 7 to 8. FGase was found to be a monomer of molecular weight 50,000. N-Acetyl-L-glutamate was not a substrate for the enzyme, but both it and N-formyl-L-aspartate were competitive inhibitors of formylglutamate hydrolysis, exhibiting Ki values of 6 and 9 mM, respectively. The absence of FGase activity as an integral part of histidine breakdown in most other organisms and the somewhat uncoordinated regulation of FGase synthesis with that of the other hut enzymes in Pseudomonas suggest that the gene encoding its synthesis may have evolved separately from the remaining hut genes.
TI  - Molecular cloning of the Pseudomonas putida glyoxalase I gene in Escherichia coli.
AB  - The glyoxalase I gene of Pseudomonas putida was cloned onto a vector plasmid pBR  322 as a 7.5 kilobase Sau 3AI fragment of chromosomal DNA and the hybrid plasmid was designated pGI 318. The gene responsible for the glyoxalase I activity in pGI 318 was recloned in pBR 322 as a 2.2 kilobase Hin dIII fragment and was designated pGI 423. The P. putida glyoxalase I gene on pGI 318 and pGI 423 was highly expressed in E. coli cells and the glyoxalase I activity level was increased more than 150 fold in the pGI 423 bearing strain compared with that of E. coli cells without pGI 423. The E. coli transformants harboring pGI 318 or pGI 423 could grow normally in the presence of methylglyoxal, although the E. coli cells without plasmid were inhibited to grow and showed the extremely elongated cell shape.
TI  - Overproduction of the xylS gene product and activation of the xylDLEGF operon on  the TOL plasmid.
AB  - The effect of high-level expression of the regulatory gene xylS of the Pseudomonas putida TOL plasmid on the activation of the xylDLEGF operon was investigated in Escherichia coli. The xylS gene was placed downstream from the tac promoter, and the resultant fusion was cloned in cis to the xylDLEGF operon. The expression of the operon was monitored by the level of catechol 2,3-dioxygenase, whose structural gene xylE was placed directly after the operator-promoter region of xylDLEGF. xylS transcription was also determined by reverse transcriptase mapping of mRNA. Overproduction of the xylS gene product elicited constitutive high expression of the xylDLEGF operon even in the absence of the inducer for the operon. The results were consistent with a cascade model for the positive control of the xylDLEGF operon by the xylR and xylS genes (S. Inouye, A. Nakazawa, and T. Nakazawa, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, in press): m-xylene, a substrate of the degradative pathway, binds to the xylR gene product; the m-xylene-xylR product complex activates the xylS gene; and the xylS product thus synthesized de novo activates the xylDLEGF operon.
TI  - Activation of the xylDLEGF promoter of the TOL toluene-xylene degradation pathway by overproduction of the xylS regulatory gene product.
AB  - The xylS regulatory gene of the Pseudomonas putida TOL plasmid (pWWO) has been cloned under the transcriptional control of the Escherichia coli tac promoter in a broad-host-range controlled-expression vector. Induction with isopropylthiogalactoside allowed overproduction and characterization of the xylS product by specific interaction with the TOL meta-cleavage pathway operator-promoter region (OP2) in vivo in E. coli. Examination of plasmid-specified polypeptides in E. coli maxicells led to identification of the xylS product as a 36-kilodalton polypeptide. The operator sequences required for xylS interactions lay upstream of the OP2 transcriptional start, and the xylS gene product recognized this region even in the absence of known coinducers.
TI  - [Ability to survive and interactions of selected bacterial species in activated carbon filters].
AB  - The survival and the interactions of selected, hygienically relevant bacterial species in activated carbon filters was investigated. The numbers of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and P. putida increased in previously sterilized filters. After inoculation all bacteria (10(6] were adsorbed. During a period of 6-10 days the filter effluent contained no detectable bacteria. After that the colony numbers increased to a constant level of 10(4)-10(5) colony forming units (CFU)/ml effluent and 10(6)-10(7) CFU/g activated carbon. Klebsiella pneumoniae and Streptococcus faecalis died off in the filter system. If the filters were inoculated simultaneously with two species, P. putida and P. aeruginosa remained at a constant level between 10(4) and 10(5) CFU/ml. E. coli was suppressed by P. aeruginosa and died off in the presence of P. putida. As in-vitro tests indicated, P. putida did not produce inhibitory substances against P. aeruginosa or E. coli. On the other hand, P. aeruginosa showed antagonistic activities against E. coli.
TI  - Expression of the regulatory gene xylS on the TOL plasmid is positively controlled by the xylR gene product.
AB  - The regulatory gene xylS on the TOL plasmid of Pseudomonas putida activates the transcription of the xylDLEGF operon for the m-toluate-degrading pathway in the presence of m-toluate. The gene also activates the transcription of the same operon in the presence of m-xylene or m-methylbenzyl alcohol, but for this activation another regulatory gene, xylR, is required. In this study we examined the xylS expression by determining the mRNA by reverse transcriptase mapping and by monitoring the enzyme activity of the xylE gene product, which was expressed under the control of the xylS promoter. The results of the above experiments provide evidence that xylR positively controls the transcription of xylS in the presence of m-xylene or m-methylbenzyl alcohol. The xylS product thus amplified may in turn activate the xylDLEGF operon. The nucleotide sequence of the xylS promoter resembles that of the promoter of the xylCAB operon for the m-xylene-degrading pathway, which is also activated by xylR in the presence of m-xylene or m-methylbenzyl alcohol. In addition, we have demonstrated that the expression of xylR is negatively controlled by its own product. On the basis of these findings, we propose a revised model for the regulation of expression of xyl genes on the TOL plasmid.
TI  - Expression of degradative genes of Pseudomonas putida in Caulobacter crescentus.
AB  - The recombinant plasmid RP4-TOL was transferred into Caulobacter crescentus at a  high frequency, and the plasmid was maintained for at least 50 generations. C. crescentus cells which contained RP4-TOL grew on all the aromatic compounds that the plasmid normally allowed Pseudomonas putida to grow on. Reciprocal transfers from C. crescentus donor to P. putida or Escherichia coli recipients were less efficient and occurred at frequencies of approximately 10(-3). Some representative TOL-specified enzymes in cell-free extracts of C. crescentus(RP4-TOL) were inducible, and their levels were similar to those of P. putida. The amounts of mRNA from induced cells of C. crescentus(RP4-TOL) and P. putida(RP4-TOL) were also similar. Moreover, the restriction enzyme digestion maps of RP4-TOL from both C. crescentus and P. putida were the same, indicating that the expression of the TOL genes occurred without any apparent alteration of the gene structure. This suggest that the degradative genes of Pseudomonas spp. can be transferred, maintained, and expressed efficiently in C. crescentus and that the mechanism of transcriptional activation of TOL genes observed in C. crescentus is similar to that of Pseudomonas spp.
TI  - Effect of temperature on the stability of plasmid pTG201 and productivity of xylE gene product in recombinant Escherichia coli: development of a two-stage chemostat with free and immobilized cells.
AB  - The effect of temperature on the stability of pTG201, a plasmid carrying the xylE gene (which encodes catechol 2,3-dioxygenase from Pseudomonas putida), and the production of catechol 2,3-dioxygenase in free and immobilized Escherichia coli during continuous culture have been studied at various temperatures. Immobilization of cells increased the stability of pTG201 considerably, even under conditions when expression of the xylE product was enhanced. Since xylE transcription was controlled by the lambda PR promoter and cI857 repressor, increasing derepression temperatures increased catechol 2,3-dioxygenase productivity and decreased pTG201 stability. A two-stage continuous culture system to overcome the impact of the high-level expression of the xylE gene on the stability of pTG201 is described. In the first stage, immobilized cells were grown in the repressed state in order to prevent loss of pTG201, whereas in the second stage, cultures were maintained in the derepressed state.
TI  - Organization and nucleotide sequence determination of a gene cluster involved in  3-chlorocatechol degradation.
AB  - Three critical enzymes catechol oxygenase II (chlorocatechol dioxygenase), muconate cycloisomerase II, and dienelactone hydrolase, are involved in the degradation of chlorocatechols, which are obligatory intermediates in the catabolism of chlorinated aromatic compounds. The organization and complete nucleotide sequence of the genes for these enzymes have been determined on a 4.2-kilobase-pair (kbp) Bgl II fragment cloned from the plasmid pAC27, based on the agreement of open reading frame lengths with apparent mobilities of polypeptides expressed in Escherichia coli maxicells, predicted N-terminal amino acid sequences with those of the purified proteins, and predicted total amino acid compositions with those of the purified proteins. The 4.2-kbp fragment contains the three genes and ribosome binding sites for those genes but no promoter. When placed downstream of the tac promoter in the broad-host-range plasmid pMMB22, this fragment directs the synthesis of all three enzymes in both E. coli and Pseudomonas putida only on induction with isopropyl beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside, suggesting that the gene cluster is regulated as a single unit under the control of a single promoter. Endogenous transcription initiation of the gene cluster on pAC27, however, occurs from a site present within a 386-bp Bgl II fragment upstream of the 4.2-kbp fragment, and sequences 5' to that site are similar to the sequences of other positively controlled Pseudomonas promoters occurring on the TOL and NAH plasmids.
TI  - In vivo formation of gene fusions in Pseudomonas putida and construction of versatile broad-host-range vectors for direct subcloning of Mu d1 and Mu d2 fusions.
AB  - The Mu d1 and Mu d2 prophages were integrated into the conjugative broad-host-range plasmid R751. The two plasmids were then transferred into Pseudomonas putida, and derivatives carrying intact Mu prophages were recovered. After induction of Mu at 42 degrees C, both operon and gene fusions were observed on 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside (X-Gal) plates. Broad-host-range vectors were constructed which allow direct cloning of both operon or gene fusions and their analysis in Escherichia coli and P. putida. By using one of these vectors, two operon fusions were isolated from the P. putida chromosome and comparatively analyzed in E. coli and P. putida.
TI  - Genetic analysis of mannityl opine catabolism in octopine-type Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain 15955.
AB  - The genetic organization of functions responsible for mannityl opine catabolism of the Ti plasmid of Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain 1,5955 was investigated. A partial HindIII digest of pTi1,5955 was cloned into a broad host range cosmid and the clones obtained were tested for ability to confer mannityl opine degradation upon Agrobacterium. Inserts containing genes for catabolism of mannopinic acid, mannopine, agropine, and agropinic acid were obtained, spanning a segment of 43 kb on the Ti plasmid. Two clones conferring upon Agrobacterium the ability to catabolize the mannityl opines were mobilized to several Rhizobium sp., to Pseudomonas putida and P. fluorescens and to Escherichia coli. The catabolic functions were phenotypically expressed in all Rhizobium sp. tested, and in P. fluorescens, but not in P. putida or in E. coli.
TI  - Structure of the Pseudomonas putida alkBAC operon. Identification of transcription and translation products.
AB  - The structural genes of the Pseudomonas oleovorans alk (alkane utilization) system, which are localized on the alkBAC operon, were cloned as a 16.9-kilobase pair EcoRI fragment. We have measured the length and determined the position of the alkBAC operon on this fragment by electron microscopy of R-loops. Furthermore, the 7.3-kilobase pair long alkBAC operon was analyzed for translation products in Escherichia coli minicells. Using a spectrum of overlapping subclones, six different proteins were identified. Starting from the alkBAC promotor, these polypeptides had molecular masses of 41, 15, 49, 58, 59, and 20 kDa, respectively. The 41-kDa protein was identified as alkane hydroxylase by reaction with a specific antibody. The 15- and 49-kDa peptides are soluble components of the alkane hydroxylase complex. The 58-kDa protein is most likely involved in alkanol dehydrogenase activity.
TI  - The xylS gene positive regulator of TOL plasmid pWWO: identification, sequence analysis and overproduction leading to constitutive expression of meta cleavage operon.
AB  - The Pseudomonas putida TOL plasmid pWWO carries an operon that specifies a meta-cleavage pathway for the catabolism of benzoate and toluates whose transcription is positively regulated by the xylS gene product. Stimulation of transcription of the operon is thought to result from activation of this protein by pathway substrates/effectors. In the present study, overexpression of the xylS gene has led to identification of the regulator as a 33 kDa protein. Overexpression of xylS also resulted in partially constitutive, i.e. effector-independent expression of the meta-cleavage operon. Determination of the polynucleotide sequence of the xylS gene revealed amino acid sequence homology with several DNA binding proteins, particularly with the araC products of Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium and with the nifA and ntrC products of Klebsiella pneumoniae. Homologous sequences were mainly located in an alpha-helix-turn-alpha-helix domain of the polypeptide. Interestingly, amino acid sequence homology was also found with sigma factors of E. coli (ntrA and htpR products) and Bacillus subtilis (spoIIG and phage SPOI Gp34 products) and other RNA polymerase core-interacting proteins, such as the E. coli nusA product.
TI  - Molecular analysis of regulatory and structural xyl genes of the TOL plasmid pWW53-4.
AB  - pWW53-4 is a cointegrate between RP4 and the catabolic plasmid pWW53 from Pseudomonas putida MT53, which contains 36 kbp of pWW53 DNA inserted close to the oriV gene of RP4; it encodes the ability to grow on toluene and the xylenes, characteristic of pWW53, as well as resistance to tetracycline, kanamycin and carbenicillin, characteristic of RP4. A physical map of the 36 kbp insert of pWW53 DNA for 11 restriction enzymes is presented, showing that the relative positions of the two xyl operons are different from those on the archetypal TOL plasmid pWW0. The location of the genes for 4-oxalocrotonate decarboxylase (xylI) and 4-oxalocrotonate tautomerase (xylH) were shown by subcloning and enzyme assay to lie at the distal end of the meta pathway operon. Although 2-oxopent-4-enoate hydratase (xylJ) and 4-hydroxy-2-oxovalerate aldolase (xylK) could be detected on a large cloned HindIII fragment, they could not be accurately located on smaller subcloned DNA, but the only credible position for them is between xylF and xylI. The gene order in the meta pathway operon is therefore xylDLEGF(J,K)IH. The regulatory genes xylS and xylR were located close to and downstream of the meta pathway operon, and the restriction map of the DNA in this region, as has previously been shown for the two operons carrying the structural genes, shows similarities with the corresponding region on pWW0. Evidence is also presented for the existence of two promoters, termed P3 and P4, internal to the meta pathway operon which support low constitutive expression of the structural genes downstream in Pseudomonas hosts but not in E. coli.
TI  - Maintenance and stability of introduced genotypes in groundwater aquifer material.
AB  - Three indigenous groundwater bacterial strains and Pseudomonas putida harboring plasmids TOL (pWWO) and RK2 were introduced into experimentally contaminated groundwater aquifer microcosms. Maintenance of the introduced genotypes was measured over time by colony hybridization with gene probes of various specificity. On the basis of the results of colony hybridization quantitation of the introduced organisms and genes, all introduced genotypes were stably maintained at approximately 10(5) positive hybrid colonies g-1 of aquifer microcosm material throughout an 8-week incubation period. Concomitant removal of the environmental contaminants, viz., toluene, chlorobenzene, and styrene, in both natural (uninoculated) and inoculated aquifer microcosms was also demonstrated. The results indicate that introduced catabolic plasmids, as well as indigenous organisms, can be stably maintained in groundwater aquifer material without specific selective pressure for the introduced genotypes. These results have positive implications for in situ treatment and biodegradation in contaminated aerobic groundwater aquifers.
TI  - Analysis of transcription from the trfA promoter of broad host range plasmid RK2  in Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas putida, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - Reverse transcriptase mapping has been used to analyze transcription from the trfA promoter of broad host range plasmid RK2. The results show that trfA operon mRNA has the same 5' end in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas putida, and Escherichia coli. The strengths of wild-type and mutant trfA promoters, which differ by defined base substitutions, have been compared and the positions of their transcriptional start sites determined. While these base substitutions do not alter the transcriptional start site, they do have marked effects on promoter strength which are broadly similar in each of the host species. A single base pair substitution, which lies in the region corresponding to the E. coli promoter consensus, brings about a large reduction in gene expression while the introduction of a second mutation, at a locus outside this region, has no further effect on promoter strength. The results indicate that these Pseudomonas species possess an RNA polymerase which recognizes the same region of the trfA promoter as that utilized by E. coli RNA polymerase. Within the limits of these observations it is clear that the trfA operon is transcribed from a single promoter which can function efficiently in diverse species, a property which may be important for its broad host range.
TI  - Effect of a broad-host range plasmid on growth dynamics of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - Host-plasmid interactions were studied for the broad-host range plasmid, pTJS26,  a derivative of RK2. To isolate host and plasmid contributions to the growth dynamics and plasmid stability, separate experiments were performed with host and recombinant cells for two different gram-negative hosts, Pseudomonas putida and Escherichia coli, at two different temperatures, 30 and 37 degrees C. At the lower temperature (30 degrees C) the growth kinetics were not affected by the plasmid, but plasmid instability was observed. At the higher temperature (37 degrees C) growth rates and yields were lower than that for the hosts, but the plasmid was stable. This behavior can be explained by a combination of two phenomena. First, the copy number control mechanism may be temperature sensitive and, second, plasmid segregation may be inefficient. For both E. coli and P. putida the growth dynamics of the recombinant system was dictated by the presence of the plasmid.
TI  - Survival of selected bacterial species in sterilized activated carbon filters and biological activated carbon filters.
AB  - The survival of selected hygienically relevant bacterial species in activated carbon (AC) filters on a bench scale was investigated. The results revealed that after inoculation of the test strains the previously sterilized AC absorbed all bacteria (10(6) to 10(7)). After a period of 6 to 13 days without countable bacteria in the effluent, the numbers of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Pseudomonas putida increased up to 10(4) to 10(5) CFU/ml of effluent and 10(6) to 10(7) CFU/g of AC. When Klebsiella pneumoniae and Streptococcus faecalis were used, no growth in filters could be observed. The numbers of E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and P. putida, however, decreased immediately and showed no regrowth in nonsterile AC from a filter which had been continuously connected to running tap water for 2 months. Under these conditions an autochthonous microflora developed on the carbon surface which could be demonstrated by scanning electron microscopy and culturing methods (heterotrophic plate count). These bacteria reduced E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and P. putida densities in the effluent by a factor of more than 10(5) within 1 to 5 days. The hypothesis that antagonistic substances of the autochthonous microflora were responsible for the elimination of the artificial contamination could not be confirmed because less than 1% of the isolates of the autochthonous microflora were able to produce such substances as indicated by in vitro tests. Competition for limiting nutrients was thought to be the reason for the observed effects.
TI  - Molecular cloning of genes encoding branched-chain keto acid dehydrogenase of Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - We cloned the structural genes for the individual subunits of the branched-chain  keto acid dehydrogenase multienzyme complex on a 7.8-kilobase EcoRI-SstI restriction fragment of Pseudomonas putida chromosomal DNA by cloning into the broad-host-range vector pKT230. A direct selection system for growth on valine-isoleucine agar was achieved by complementation of P. putida branched-chain keto acid dehydrogenase mutants. The recombinant plasmid, pSS1-1, increased expression of branched-chain keto acid dehydrogenase up to five times in wild-type P. putida. The complex was expressed constitutively in P. putida(pSS1-1) but was inducible in Escherichia coli HB101(pSS1-1) by high valine. E. coli minicells transformed with pSS1-1 produced three polypeptides which did not match the four polypeptides of the purified complex. To resolve this problem, we inserted P. putida DNA from pSS1-1 into pUC18 and pUC19. The pUC-derived plasmids were used as DNA templates in an E. coli transcription-translation system. Four polypeptides were produced from the pUC18-derived plasmid which had the correct molecular weights, showing that the structural genes had been cloned. Since only weak bands were produced with the pUC19-derived plasmid, the direction of transcription was established. The locations and order of all the structural genes of branched-chain keto acid dehydrogenase were located by restriction enzyme mapping.
TI  - Gene organization of the first catabolic operon of TOL plasmid pWW53: production  of indigo by the xylA gene product.
AB  - The entire operon coding for the enzymes responsible for conversion of toluenes to benzoates has been cloned from TOL plasmid pWW53 and the position of the genes accurately located. The coding region was 7.4 kilobase pairs (kbp) long, and the gene order was operator-promoter region (OP1)-a small open reading frame-xylC (1.6 kbp)-xylA (2.9 kbp)-xylB (1.8 kbp). Within the coding region there was considerable homology with the isofunctional region of the archetypal TOL plasmid pWW0. A central region of 2.9 kbp complemented an xylA (for xylene oxygenase) mutant of Pseudomonas putida mt-2 and was also capable of conferring the ability to convert indole to indigo on strains of Escherichia coli and P. putida. This reaction has been reported previously only for dioxygenases involved in aromatic catabolism but not for monooxygenases. It is proposed that the region encodes xylene oxygenase activity capable of direct monohydroxylation of indole to 3-hydroxyindole (oxindole), which then spontaneously dimerizes to form indigo.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence and expression of gene nahH of plasmid NAH7 and homology with gene xylE of TOL pWWO.
AB  - The enzyme catechol 2,3-dioxygenase (C23O) encoded by the nahH gene of plasmid NAH7 converts catechol to alpha-hydroxymuconic epsilon-semialdehyde in Pseudomonas putida. We have cloned this structural gene into vectors pUC18 and pKT240, determined the nucleotide sequence and deduced the amino acid sequence. In comparison to the gene xylE of the TOL plasmid pWWO which encodes a similar C230 enzyme [Nakai et al. J. Biol. Chem. (1983b), 2923-2928], the respective G + C contents were 55% and 57%, the nucleotide sequences 81% homologous, and the amino acid homology 85%. The flanking sequences of the two C23O-coding genes also show homology. Clones of the nahH gene in Escherichia coli overproduce the protein product at least ten fold and the gene product was identified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
TI  - Biosynthesis of thiamin. Different biosynthetic routes of the thiazole moiety of  thiamin in aerobic organisms and anaerobic organisms.
AB  - The nitrogen atom of glycine was incorporated into the thiazole moiety of thiamin in the aerobic microorganisms Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas putida, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Mucor racemosus, Neurospora crassa, and Emericella nidulans. It was not incorporated in the case of the facultative anaerobic microorganisms Escherichia coli and Enterobacter aerogenes, which, however, did incorporate the nitrogen atom of tyrosine. These results show that aerobic microorganisms and facultative anaerobic microorganisms have different biosynthetic pathways for the thiazole moiety of thiamin.
TI  - A set of cassettes and improved vectors for genetic and biochemical characterization of Pseudomonas genes.
AB  - A set of broad-host-range vectors allowing direct selection of recombinant DNA molecules to facilitate subcloning and expression analyses of Pseudomonas genes was constructed using Bg/II lacZ alpha cassette. Controlled expression vectors pVDtac39 and pVDtac24 were shown to be useful for determination of enzymatic activities encoded by the cloned DNA fragments and Mr determination of the corresponding polypeptides. A set of Pseudomonas putida xylE gene cassettes truncated at the 5' end was constructed for translational (protein) fusion studies. A protein fusion of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa algD gene, coding for GDPmannose dehydrogenase, and the truncated xylE gene cassette was used to verify the putative coding region and translational signals predicted from the algD nucleotide sequence.
TI  - Interposon mutagenesis of soil and water bacteria: a family of DNA fragments designed for in vitro insertional mutagenesis of gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - We have constructed a series of derivatives of the omega interposon [Prentki and  Krisch, Gene 29 (1984) 303-313] that can be used for in vitro insertional mutagenesis. Each of these DNA fragments carries a different antibiotic or Hg2+ resistance gene (ApR, CmR, TcR, KmR or HgR) which is flanked, in inverted orientation, by transcription and translation termination signals and by synthetic polylinkers. The DNA of these interposons can be easily purified and then inserted, by in vitro ligation, into a plasmid linearized either at random by DNase I or at specific sites by restriction enzymes. Plasmid molecules which contain an interposon insertion can be identified by expression of its drug resistance. The position of the interposon can be precisely mapped by the restriction sites in the flanking polylinker. To verify their properties we have used these omega derivatives to mutagenize a broad host range plasmid which contains the entire meta-cleavage pathway of the toluene degradation plasmid pWW0 of Pseudomonas putida. Insertion of these interposons in the plasmid between the promoter and the catechol 2,3-dioxygenase (C23O) gene dramatically reduced the expression of this enzyme in Escherichia coli. We also show that when a plasmid containing an omega interposon is transferred by conjugal mobilization from E. coli to P. putida, Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Erwinia chrysanthemi, Paracoccus denitrificans or Rhizobium leguminosarum, the appropriate interposon drug resistance is usually expressed and, compared to the non-mutated plasmid, much reduced levels of C23O activity are detected. Thus, the selection and/or characterization of omega insertional mutations can be carried out in these bacterial species.
TI  - Construction of a transposon containing a gene for polygalacturonate trans-eliminase from Klebsiella oxytoca.
AB  - A DNA fragment containing a Klebsiella oxytoca gene for polygalacturonate trans-eliminase was cloned into the kanamycin resistance transposon Tn5. This new transposon, designated Tn5-Pga+, had a transposition frequency of 1 X 10(-6). The broad host range plasmid pR751::Tn5-Pga+ was conjugally transferred to a variety of genetic backgrounds. The ability to degrade polygalacturonate was expressed in Aeromonas hydrophila, Alcaligenes eutrophus, Azotomonas insolita, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas putida and Rhodopseudomonas sphaeroides, but not in Zymomonas mobilis.
TI  - [Transfer of chromosomal genes and formation of R'-derivatives using PR4::D312cts15 plasmids in Pseudomonas aeruginosa cells].
AB  - Several hybrid RP4 plasmids containing the genome of heat-inducible D3112cts15 phage integrated into 2 different sites of RP4 were selected. It was shown that the plasmids RP4::D3112cts15 mobilized the chromosome of Pseudomonas aeruginosa from many sites located in different chromosome regions. Chromosomal recombinants are, formed at frequencies of about 10(-4) per recipient cell. Analysis of coinheritance of unselected markers showed that the majority of recombinants inherited short donor chromosome fragments (about 5 min). R' plasmids can be easily selected by mating with a rec- recipient. For instance, the frequency of selection of R' plasmids containing argH+ locus was about 10(-5) per donor cell. Conjugative transfer of RP4::D3112cts15 into nonlysogenic strains PAO P. aeruginosa results in partial or complete loss of prophage from a hybrid plasmid. The RP4::D3112cts15 plasmids appear to have retained the broad host range of the original RP4 (they are maintained in P. putida and Escherichia coli).
TI  - Characterization of a plasmid-specified pathway for catabolism of isopropylbenzene in Pseudomonas putida RE204.
AB  - A Pseudomonas putida strain designated RE204, able to utilize isopropylbenzene as the sole carbon and energy source, was isolated. Tn5 transposon mutagenesis by means of the suicide transposon donor plasmid pLG221 yielded mutant derivatives defective in isopropylbenzene metabolism. These were characterized by the identification of the products which they accumulated when grown in the presence of isopropylbenzene and by the assay of enzyme activities in cell extracts. Based on the results obtained, the following metabolic pathway is proposed: isopropylbenzene----2,3-dihydro -2,3-dihydroxyisopropylbenzene----3-isopropylcatechol----2 -hydroxy-6-oxo-7-methylocta-2,4-dienoate----isobutyrate + 2-oxopent-4-enoate----amphibolic intermediates. Plasmid DNA was isolated from strain RE204 and mutant derivatives and characterized by restriction enzyme cleavage analysis. Isopropylbenzene-negative isolates carried a Tn5 insert within a 15-kilobase region of a 105-kilobase plasmid designated pRE4. DNA fragments of pRE4 carrying genes encoding isopropylbenzene catabolic enzymes were cloned in Escherichia coli with various plasmid vectors; clones were identified by (i) selection for Tn5-encoded kanamycin resistance in the case of Tn5 mutant plasmids, (ii) screening for isopropylbenzene dioxygenase-catalyzed oxidation of indole to indigo, and (iii) use of a Tn5-carrying restriction fragment, derived from a pRE4::Tn5 mutant plasmid, as a probe for clones carrying wild-type restriction fragments. These clones were subsequently used to generate a transposon insertion and restriction enzyme cleavage map of the isopropylbenzene metabolic region of pRE4.
TI  - Amino acid sequence of the pyruvate and the glyoxylate active-site lysine peptide of Escherichia coli 2-keto-4-hydroxyglutarate aldolase.
AB  - Pure 2-keto-4-hydroxyglutarate aldolase of Escherichia coli, a "lysine-type" trimeric enzyme which has the unique properties of forming an "abortive" Schiff-base intermediate with glyoxylate (the aldehydic product/substrate) and of showing strong beta-decarboxylase activity toward oxalacetate, binds any one of its substrates (2-keto-4-hydroxyglutarate, pyruvate, or glyoxylate) in a competitive manner. To determine whether the substrates bind at the same or different (juxta-positioned) sites and what degree of homology might exist between the active-site lysine peptide of this enzyme and that of other lysine-type (Class I) aldolases or beta-decarboxylases, the azomethine formed separately by this aldolase with either [14C]pyruvate or [14C]glyoxylate was reduced with CNBH3-. After each enzyme adduct was digested with trypsin, the 14C-labeled peptide was isolated, purified, and subjected to amino acid analysis and sequence determination. In each case, the same 14-amino acid lysine-peptide was isolated and found to have the following primary sequence: Glu-Phe-*Lys-Phe-Phe-Pro-Ala-Glu-Ala-Asn-Gly-Gly-Val-Lys (where * = the active-site lysine). Hence, glyoxylate competes for, and inhibits aldolase activity by reacting with, the one active-site lysine residue/subunit. This active-site lysine peptide has a high degree (65%) of homology with that of 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate aldolase of Pseudomonas putida but is not similar to that of any Class I fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase or of acetoacetate beta-decarboxylase of Clostridium acetobutylicum. Furthermore, it was found that extensive reaction of glyoxylate with the N-terminal amino group of this enzyme may well be general complicating factor in sequence studies with proteins plus glyoxylate.
TI  - Vector for regulated expression of cloned genes in a wide range of gram-negative  bacteria.
AB  - A pKT231-based broad-host-range plasmid vector was constructed which enabled regulation of expression of cloned genes in a wide range of gram-negative bacteria. This vector, pNM185, contained upstream of its EcoRI, SstI, and SstII cloning sites the positively activated pm twin promoters of the TOL plasmid and xylS, the gene of the positive regulator of these promoters. Expression of cloned genes was induced with micromolar quantities of benzoate or m-toluate, the inexpensive coinducers of the pm promoters. Expression of a test gene, xylE, which specifies catechol 2,3-dioxygenase, cloned in this vector was tested in representative strains of a variety of gram-negative bacteria. Regulated expression of xylE was observed in most strains examined, and induced levels of enzyme representing up to 5% of total cellular protein and ratios of induced:noninduced levels of enzyme up to a factor of 600 were observed. The level of xylE gene expression in different bacteria tended to be correlated with their phylogenetic distance from Pseudomonas putida.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence of a DNA segment promoting transcription in Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - A DNA segment that promotes gene expression in Pseudomonas putida was identified  in pTN8, a mutant plasmid of an RP4-TOL recombinant. A promoter on the segment was cloned with a promoter-probe vector containing the xylE gene of the TOL plasmid. The xylE gene was expressed under the control of the promoter, and the gene product catechol 2,3-dioxygenase was constitutively synthesized. As analyzed by an S1 nuclease protection assay, the amount of mRNA produced in P. putida was more than that in Escherichia coli. Fine S1 nuclease mapping and reverse transcriptase mapping revealed three tandem transcription start sites in both P. putida and E. coli. The nucleotide sequence preceding the transcription start sites was determined; a part of this sequence contained a sequence homologous to E. coli promoter sequences. A tentative consensus sequence for P. putida constitutive promoters is proposed.
TI  - The xylABC promoter from the Pseudomonas putida TOL plasmid is activated by nitrogen regulatory genes in Escherichia coli.
AB  - The xylABC promoter (OP1), located on the TOL plasmid of Pseudomonas putida contains sequences homologous to the conserved regions found in nitrogen fixation (nif) promoters and in other promoters subject to nitrogen control. XylA-lac fusions were constructed in order to monitor expression from the OP1 promoter in Escherichia coli. Transcription was activated in the presence of the heterologous regulatory genes ntrC or nifA from Klebsiella pneumoniae as well as by the homologous P. putida regulatory gene xylR. In all cases activation was also dependent on the ntrA gene, whose product has been implicated as a specific sigma factor for ntr activatable operons. The 5' ends of xylA mRNA, detected by S1 nuclease mapping of in vivo transcripts, were identical in strains containing xylR, ntrC or nifA as transcriptional activators. However, activation of the K. pneumoniae nifL or nifH promoters by xylR was not detected.
TI  - Analysis of the vegetative replication origin of broad-host-range plasmid RK2 by  transposon mutagenesis.
AB  - A range of Tn1723 transposon mutants of the oriV region of broad-host-range plasmid RK2 have been isolated, and the internal EcoRI fragment of the transposon has been deleted from each to reduce the insertion size from 9.6 kb (Tn1723) to 35 bp (delta Tn1723). Sequencing from the delta Tn1723-derived EcoRI site has allowed the precise mapping of these insertions to various points dispersed through the origin region. Using these mutants we have determined which regions of oriV RK2 are of functional importance to plasmid establishment following transformation of the host species Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas putida, and P. aeruginosa. Insertions into an A/T-rich region, and a region containing five direct repeat sequences prevented successful transformation of each host species tested, but the continuity of sequences adjacent to the five repeats were essential only in E. coli and P. putida. The establishment and maintenance in E. coli of a mini-RK2 replicon was found to be inhibited by transcription from an inducible promoter positioned to read into oriV RK2 against the direction of replication. Assays of transcription emerging from Tn1723 demonstrated significant levels from one end of the transposon only. Four mutants with insertions downstream of oriV RK2 were unable to become established in E. coli, and contained Tn1723 in the orientation which would supply transcription toward the oriV RK2 region. These results demonstrate both that the sequence requirements for oriV RK2 function differ between host bacterial species, and that origin function may be further influenced by the genetic environment in which it lies.
TI  - Resolution of branched-chain oxo acid dehydrogenase complex of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO.
AB  - Branched-chain oxo acid dehydrogenase was purified from Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain PAO with the objective of resolving the complex into its subunits. The purified complex consisted of four proteins, of Mr 36,000, 42,000, 49,000 and 50,000. The complex was resolved by heat treatment into the 49,000 and 50,000-Mr proteins, which were separated by chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose. The 49,000-Mr protein was identified as the E2 subunit by its ability to catalyse transacylation with a variety of substrates, with dihydrolipoamide as the acceptor. P. aeruginosa, like P. putida, produces two lipoamide dehydrogenases. One, the 50,000-Mr protein, was identified as the specific E3 subunit of branched-chain oxo acid dehydrogenase and had many properties in common with the lipoamide dehydrogenase LPD-val of P. putida. The second lipoamide dehydrogenase had Mr 54,000 and corresponded to the lipoamide dehydrogenase LPD-glc of P. putida. Fragments of C-terminal CNBr peptides of LPD-val from P. putida and P. aeruginosa corresponded closely, with only two amino acid differences over 31 amino acids. A corresponding fragment at the C-terminal end of lipoamide dehydrogenase from Escherichia coli also showed extensive homology. All three peptides had a common segment of eight amino acids, with the sequence TIHAHPTL. This homology was not evident in any other flavoproteins in the Dayhoff data base which suggests that this sequence might be characteristic of lipoamide dehydrogenase.
TI  - Genetic analysis of a relaxed substrate specificity aromatic ring dioxygenase, toluate 1,2-dioxygenase, encoded by TOL plasmid pWW0 of Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - Toluate 1,2-dioxygenase is the first enzyme of a meta-cleavage pathway for the oxidative catabolism of benzoate and substituted benzoates to Krebs cycle intermediates that is specified by TOL plasmid pWW0 of Pseudomonas putida. A collection of derivatives harbouring Tn1000 insertions and defective in toluate dioxygenase have been isolated from pPL392, a pBR322-based hybrid plasmid carrying the TOL plasmid meta-cleavage pathway operon. In parallel, a series of N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitro-soguanidine-induced mutant plasmids defective in this enzyme activity were isolated from pNM72, a pKT231-based hybrid plasmid carrying the same operon. Pairs of mutant plasmids, consisting of one Tn1000 derivative and one nitrosoguanidine-induced derivative, were used for complementation analysis of toluate dioxygenase in Escherichia coli recA bacteria, in which the formation of 2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde from benzoate was examined. Four cistrons for toluate 1,2-dioxygenase were thus identified. DNA fragments containing nitrosoguanidine-induced mutant cistrons plus the other meta-cleavage operon genes were cloned into pOT5, an R388-based vector, and complementation tests between different nitrosoguanidine-induced mutant cistrons were carried out in Pseudomonas putida cells, this time scoring for growth on p-toluate. This analysis also identified four cistrons. Examination of the products of these cistrons, by means of E. coli minicells containing pPL392 or its Tn1000 insertion derivatives, indicated that the first two cistrons of the operon comprise a single gene, xylX, which encodes a 57 kilodalton protein, and that the third cistron, xylY, encodes a 20 kilodalton protein.
TI  - Cloning and expression of Acinetobacter calcoaceticus catBCDE genes in Pseudomonas putida and Escherichia coli.
AB  - This report describes the isolation and preliminary characterization of a 5.0-kilobase-pair (kbp) EcoRI DNA restriction fragment carrying the catBCDE genes from Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. The respective genes encode enzymes that catalyze four consecutive reactions in the catechol branch of the beta-ketoadipate pathway: catB, muconate lactonizing enzyme (EC 5.5.1.1); catC, muconolactone isomerase (EC 5.3.3.4); catD, beta-ketoadipate enol-lactone hydrolase (EC 3.1.1.24); and catE, beta-ketoadipate succinyl-coenzyme A transferase (EC 2.8.3.6). In A. calcoaceticus, pcaDE genes encode products with the same enzyme activities as those encoded by the respective catDE genes. In Pseudomonas putida, the requirements for both catDE and pcaDE genes are met by a single set of genes, designated pcaDE. A P. putida mutant with a dysfunctional pcaE gene was used to select a recombinant pKT230 plasmid carrying the 5.0-kbp EcoRI restriction fragment containing the A. calcoaceticus catE structural gene. The recombinant plasmid, pAN1, complemented P. putida mutants with lesions in catB, catC, pcaD, and pcaE genes; the complemented activities were expressed constitutively in the recombinant P. putida strains. After introduction into Escherichia coli, the pAN1 plasmid expressed the activities constitutively but at much lower levels that those found in the P. putida transformants or in fully induced cultures of A. calcoaceticus or P. putida. When placed under the control of a lac promoter on a recombinant pUC13 plasmid in E. coli, the A. calcoaceticus restriction fragment expressed catBCDE activities at levels severalfold higher than those found in fully induced cultures of A. calcoaceticus. Thus there is no translational barrier to expression of the A. calcoaceticus genes at high levels in E. coli. The genetic origin of the cloned catBCDE genes was demonstrated by the fact that the 5.0-kbp EcoRI restriction fragment hybridized with a corresponding fragment from wild-type A. calcoaceticus DNA. This fragment was missing in DNA from an A. calcoaceticus mutant in which the cat genes had been removed by deletion. The properties of the cloned fragment demonstrate physical linkage of the catBCDE genes and suggest that they are coordinately transcribed.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence of the Pseudomonas putida cytochrome P-450cam gene and its expression in Escherichia coli.
AB  - Cytochrome P-450cam catalyzes the stereospecific methylene hydroxylation of camphor to form 5-exohydroxycamphor and is encoded by the camC gene on the CAM plasmid of Pseudomonas putida, ATCC 17453. The cytochrome P-450cam structural gene has been cloned by mutant complementation in P. putida (Koga, H., Rauchfuss, B., and Gunsalus, I. C. (1985) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 130, 412-417). We report the complete nucleotide sequence of the camC gene along with 155 base pairs of 5' and 175 base pairs of 3' flanking sequence. Upon comparison of the amino acid sequence derived from the gene sequence to the one obtained from the purified protein (Haniu, M., Armes, L. G., Yasunobu, K. T., Shastry, B. A., and Gunsalus, I. C. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 12664-12671), five differences were found. The most significant was the addition of a Trp and a Thr residue between Val-54 and Arg-55, thereby increasing the amino acid numbering scheme by 2 after Val-54, bringing the total number of amino acids to 414. Other differences were: Gln-274----Glu-276, Ser-359----His-361, and Asn-405----Asp-407. N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis of the cloned cytochrome P-450cam enzyme expressed in Escherichia coli under the lac promoter showed a faithful translation of the hemo-protein, with the N-terminal Met removed by processing as found in P. putida. Purification to homogeneity of the cloned protein was accomplished by the method used for the CAM plasmid-encoded enzyme of P. putida. The G + C content of the camC gene was found to be 59.0%, caused by a preferred usage of G and C terminated codons. The gene encoding putidaredoxin reductase, camA, was located 22 nucleotides downstream from the cytochrome P-450cam gene. The camA gene initiated with a novel GUG codon, the first such initiator documented in Pseudomonas.
TI  - Plasmid-determined cadmium resistance in Pseudomonas putida GAM-1 isolated from soil.
AB  - Cadmium-resistant Pseudomonas putida GAM-1, which was able to grow in concentrations of CdCl2 as high as 7 mM, was isolated from soil in a rice paddy. This bacterium harbored a DNA plasmid of about 52 kilobases. The plasmid (pGU100) transformed Escherichia coli C600 to cadmium resistance. A cadmium-resistant transformant of E. coli C600 contained a plasmid corresponding to that seen in P. putida GAM-1. The transformant did not take up cadmium as well as P. putida GAM-1 did.
TI  - [Selection of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida cultures with an enhanced resistance to immobilization on polyacrylamide gel].
AB  - Clones of Escherichia coli (A4, A70, G60) and Pseudomonas putida (A70, G30) with  an elevated resistance to the process of immobilization in polyacrylamide gel and to the action of monomeric acrylamide were selected from the parent E. coli IBPM B115 and P. putida. The isolated cultures remained resistant to the above actions for a long time. The frequency at which cells with the elevated resistance appeared was comparable with the frequency of bacterial mutations. The plasmid analysis did not reveal the presence of plasmid DNA in the cells of the isolated cultures. The decrease in the viability index of bacterial populations caused by their immobilization in polyacrylamide gel and by the action of monomeric acrylamide did depend on the growth phase. The cells were more resistant to these actions in the stationary phase. The isolated cultures were more resistant as compared to the parent cultures irrespective of the growth phase.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence analysis of the phosphomannose isomerase gene (pmi) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and comparison with the corresponding Escherichia coli gene manA.
AB  - Phosphomannose isomerase (PMI) has been proposed to catalyze the first step of the alginic acid biosynthetic pathway in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The nucleotide sequence of the P. aeruginosa pmi gene contained on a 2.0-kb BamHI-SstI DNA fragment has been determined. The gene was defined by the start and stop codons and by in vitro disruption of an open reading frame of 1440 bp corresponding to a polypeptide product with a predicted Mr of 52 860. This polypeptide displayed an apparent Mr of approx. 56 000 upon electrophoresis of a maxicell extract on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. The codon utilization of the pmi gene was distinct in the wobble base preference and influenced by the high G + C content (66 mol%) of the P. aeruginosa DNA. Computer assisted matching analysis failed to demonstrate any significant homology at the nucleotide level between the P. aeruginosa pmi and Escherichia coli manA (pmi) genes. However, sequences homologous to the P. aeruginosa pmi gene were found in other Pseudomonas species, such as P. putida and P. mendocina, and in Azotobacter vinelandii, all capable of producing alginic acid.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence of the regulatory gene xylS on the Pseudomonas putida TOL plasmid and identification of the protein product.
AB  - The xylS gene is a regulatory gene which positively controls expression of the genes on the TOL plasmid for degradation enzymes of benzoate or m-toluate in Pseudomonas putida. Cloning of the gene in Escherichia coli and determination of the nucleotide sequence revealed an open reading frame of 963 bp which corresponds to a protein with an Mr of 36,502. The xylS gene was recloned onto a tac-promoter vector, and the product was identified by the maxicell procedure as a protein with an approximate Mr of 37,000. The predicted amino acid sequence of XylS protein showed a basic character and contained a region similar to those in other DNA-binding proteins.
TI  - [Similar organization of beta,beta'-subunit RNA-polymerase genes and adjacent ribosomal protein genes in Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas putida].
AB  - The genes coding for the RNA-polymerase beta,beta'-subunits and adjacent ribosomal protein genes in Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Shigella flexneri, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas putida are compared by the Southern hybridization procedure. In all the species studied close clustering of the genes rplKAJL and rpoBC is demonstrated. Preliminary physical maps for these genes in S. typhimurium, S. flexneri, S. marcescens and P. mirabilis are proposed. Rifampicin is shown to stimulate the beta,beta'-subunit synthesis in all the species studied, suggesting the existence of attenuators localized in front of the rpoBC genes. The similar arrangement of the genes rplKAJLrpoBC in a number of bacterial species is proposed to be due to common mechanisms of their coordinate expression.
TI  - Homology between nucleotide sequences of promoter regions of nah and sal operons  of NAH7 plasmid of Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - The in vivo transcription start sites of the nah and sal operons of the NAH7 plasmid were determined by S1 nuclease mapping and the nucleotide sequence surrounding these transcription start sites was determined. Since expression of both of these operons is coordinately controlled by the product of the transcriptional activator gene nahR, the sequences were compared to locate potential sites involved in common regulation. In the 100-base-pair region preceding transcription start sites of both operons, three regions of extensive homology were found and may be involved in nahR-mediated transcriptional control: between -80 and -60 with 81% homology; between -40 and -28 with 75% homology; between -1 and +15 with 70% homology. Comparison of the promoter sequences of nah and sal with the analogous sequences of the xylABC and xylDEFG operons of the TOL plasmid showed little homology between the 5' regions of these two sets of positively regulated hydrocarbon degradation operons. In addition, the transcription start site of the nahR regulatory gene was located and its promoter sequence was determined. The nahR promoter overlapped at the -35 position of the sal promoter; however, the nahR gene is transcribed in the opposite direction. Sequences similar to the consensus sequences of Escherichia coli promoters (at -35 and -10) were found in nah, sal, and nahR at the appropriate positions.
TI  - Use of cloned genes of Pseudomonas TOL plasmid to effect biotransformation of benzoates to cis-dihydrodiols and catechols by Escherichia coli cells.
AB  - DNA fragments containing the xylD and xylL genes, which specify the broad-specificity enzymes toluate-1,2-dioxygenase and 3,5-cyclohexadiene-1,2-diol-1-carboxylic acid dehydrogenase, respectively, of TOL plasmid pWW0-161 of Pseudomonas putida have previously been cloned in the pBR322 vector plasmid (P.R. Lehrbach, J. Zeyer, W. Reinecke, H.-J. Knackmuss, and K. N. Timmis, J. Bacteriol. 158:1025-1032, 1984). In this study, Escherichia coli cells containing hybrid plasmids carrying the cloned xylD or xylDL genes quantitatively transformed 14C-ring- and 14C-carboxy-labeled benzoate to the pathway intermediates 3,5-cyclohexadiene-1,2-diol-1-carboxylic acid (cis-dihydrodiol) and catechol, respectively. Like P. putida cells, E. coli cells containing the xylD gene transformed a variety of chloro- and hydrocarbon-substituted benzoates. The toluate-1,2-dioxygenase produced in E. coli thus exhibited the broad-substrate-specificity properties of the enzyme in P. putida. Turnover rates by the enzymes in these two bacteria are compared.
TI  - Evolutionary conservation of genes coding for meta pathway enzymes within TOL plasmids pWW0 and pWW53.
AB  - Pseudomonas putida MT53 contains a TOL plasmid, pWW53, that encodes toluene-xylene catabolism. pWW53 is nonconjugative, is about 105 to 110 kilobase pairs (kbp) in size, and differs significantly in its restriction endonuclease digestion pattern and incompatibility group from the archetypal TOL plasmid pWW0. An RP4::pWW53 cointegrate plasmid, pWW53-4, containing about 35 kbp of pWW53 DNA, including the entire catabolic pathway genes, was formed, and a restriction map for KpnI, HindIII, and BamHI was derived. The entire regulated meta pathway genes for the catabolism of m-toluate were cloned into pKT230 from pWW53 on a 17.5-kbp HindIII fragment. The recombinant plasmid supported growth on m-toluate when mobilized into plasmid-free P. putida PaW130. A restriction map of the insert for 10 restriction enzymes was derived, and the locations of xylD, xylL, xylE, xylG, and xylF were determined by subcloning and assaying for their gene products in both Escherichia coli and P. putida hosts. Good induction of the enzymes by m-toluate and m-methylbenzyl alcohol but not by m-xylene was measured in P. putida, but little or no regulation was found in E. coli. The restriction map and the gene order showed strong similarities with published maps of the DNA encoding both the entire meta pathway operon (xylDLEGFJIH) and the regulatory genes xylS and xylR on the archetype TOL plasmid pWW0, suggesting a high degree of conservation in DNA structure for the catabolic operon on the two different plasmids.
TI  - Isolation and analysis of genes involved in siderophore biosynthesis in plant-growth-stimulating Pseudomonas putida WCS358.
AB  - The plant-growth-stimulating Pseudomonas putida WCS358 was mutagenized with transposon Tn5. The resulting mutant colony bank was screened for mutants defective in the biosynthesis of the fluorescent siderophore. A total of 28 mutants, divided into six different classes, were isolated that were nonfluorescent or defective in iron acquisition or both. These different types of mutants together with the probable overall structure of the siderophore, i.e., a small peptide chain attached to a fluorescing group, suggest a biosynthetic pathway in which the synthesis of the fluorescing group is preceded by the synthesis of the peptide part. A gene colony bank of P. putida WCS358 was constructed with the broad-host-range cosmid vector pLAFR1. This genomic library, established in Escherichia coli, was mobilized into the 28 individual mutants, screening for transconjugants restored in fluorescence or growth under iron-limiting conditions or both. A total of 13 cosmids were found to complement 13 distinct mutants. The complementation analysis revealed that at least five gene clusters, with a minimum of seven genes, are needed for siderophore biosynthesis. Some of these genes seem to be arranged in an operon-like structure.
TI  - Regions of broad-host-range plasmid RK2 involved in replication and stable maintenance in nine species of gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - The replication and maintenance properties of the broad-host-range plasmid RK2 and its derivatives were examined in nine gram-negative bacterial species. Two regions of RK2, the origin of replication (oriV) and a segment that encodes for a replication protein (trfA delta kilD, designated trfA*), are sufficient for replication in all nine species tested. However, stable maintenance of this minimal replicon (less than 0.3% loss per generation under nonselection conditions) is observed only in Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas putida, and Azotobacter vinelandii. Maintenance of this minimal replicon is unstable in Rhizobium meliloti, Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Caulobacter crescentus, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and Rhodopseudomonas sphaeroides. A maintenance function has been localized to a 3.1-kilobase (kb) region of RK2 encoding three previously described functions: korA (trfB korB1 korD), incP1-(II), and korB. The 3.1-kb maintenance region can increase or decrease the stability of maintenance of RK2 derivatives dependent on the host species and the presence or absence of the RK2 origin of conjugal transfer (oriT). In the case of A. calcoaceticus, stable maintenance requires an RK2 segment that includes the promoter and the kilD (kilB1) functions of the trfA operon in addition to the 3.1-kb maintenance region. The broad-host-range maintenance requirements of plasmid RK2, therefore, are encoded by multiple functions, and the requirement for one or more of these functions varies among gram-negative bacterial species.
TI  - Expression of plasmid encoded Escherichia coli 5S ribosomal ribonucleic acid in Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - The recombinant plasmid pNRK 36, which represents the plasmids RSF 1010, a small  multicopy plasmid of the incompatibility group IncQ that confers resistance to streptomycin and sulfoamide to its host cells, and pKK 223-3, which contains the try-lac (tac) promoter followed by a polylinker and a DNA segment containing the 5S rRNA (rrn B) with the ribosomal RNA transcription terminators, was employed to transform Pseudomonas putida 2440 cells. The plasmid encoded 5 S rRNA from Escherichia coli was transcribed and processed properly in P. putida cells thus demonstrating for the first time the expression of a plasmid encoded ribosomal RNA in a heterologous system. The fact that the E. coli 5 S rRNA was not incorporated into assembled ribosomes suggests that the in vivo incorporation of 5 S rRNA into the 50 S ribosomal subunit is closely linked to 23 S rRNA and/or ribosomal protein synthesis.
TI  - Determination of the transcription initiation site and identification of the protein product of the regulatory gene xylR for xyl operons on the TOL plasmid.
AB  - The xylR gene is a regulatory gene on the TOL plasmid, which acts in a positive manner on xyl operons for degradation of toluene and xylenes in Pseudomonas putida. A DNA fragment containing the xylR promoter region was cloned on promoter-probing vectors, and its nucleotide sequence was determined. The transcription initiation site of the xylR gene was determined in cells of P. putida and Escherichia coli by S1 nuclease and reverse transcriptase mapping. Two initiation sites were detected which were identical in both P. putida and E. coli. The amounts of mRNA synthesized in both bacterial cells were almost the same and independent of the inducers for xyl operons. The consensus sequences for E. coli promoters were found in the region preceding the respective transcription initiation sites. The product of the xylR gene was identified by the maxicell system as a protein with an approximate molecular weight of 67,000.
TI  - P450cam gene cloning and expression in Pseudomonas putida and Escherichia coli.
AB  - The gene camC, which encodes the cytochrome P450 monoxygenase protein, was cloned into the shuttle vector pKT240 and recovered as the recombinant pKG201 with a 2.3 kb insert from the CAM plasmid in the PstI site. The gene product is expressed constitutively in P. putida and in E. coli whereas the inverted insert clone lacks expression, indicating absence of an insert promoter.
TI  - [Resistance to organic tin compounds mediated by plasmids of bacteria of Pseudomonas genus].
AB  - Resistance to organic tin compounds of P. aeruginosa and E. coli carrying antibiotic resistance plasmids and to P. putida containing biodegradation plasmids was studied. It was shown that 5 resistance plasmids and the biodegradation CAM plasmid of Pseudomonas increased 3-4 times the strain resistance to triethylstannylsuccinylimide and triethylstannylmaleinimide. All these plasmids belong to the P-2 incompatibility group and also determine the bacterial resistance to potassium tellurite. Isolation and investigation of the mutant plasmids loosing simultaneously the capacity for determination of resistance to potassium tellurite and organic tin compounds suggest that resistance to these compounds in the investigated plasmids is determined by the same genetic system.
TI  - Cloning and expression in Escherichia coli of histidine utilization genes from Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - A library of the Pseudomonas putida chromosome, prepared through the use of the cosmid pJB8 ligated to a partial Sau3A digest of bacterial DNA, followed by in vitro packaging into bacteriophage lambda particles, was used to construct a strain of Escherichia coli which contained the genes for histidine utilization. This isolate produced a repressor product and all five enzymes required in Pseudomonas spp. for histidine dissimilation, whereas none of these could be detected in the nontransduced parent E. coli strain. When this transductant was grown on various media containing histidine or urocanate as the inducer, it was observed that production of the cloned histidine degradative enzymes was influenced somewhat by the choice of nitrogen source used but not by the carbon source. The recombinant cosmid was isolated and found to consist of 21.1 kilobase pairs of DNA, with approximately 16 kilobase pairs derived from Pseudomonas DNA and the remainder being from the pJB8 vector. Digestion of this insert DNA with EcoRI provided a 6.1-kilobase-pair fragment which, upon ligation in pUC8 and transformation into an E. coli host, was found to encode histidine ammonia-lyase and urocanase. The inducible nature of this production indicated that the hut repressor gene also was present on this fragment. Insertional inactivation of the histidine ammonia-lyase and urocanase genes by the gamma-delta transposon has permitted location of these structural genes and has provided evidence that transcription proceeds from urocanase through histidine ammonia-lyase. Mapping of the 16-kilobase-pair Pseudomonas DNA segment with restriction enzymes and subcloning of additional portions, one of which contained the gene for formiminoglutamate hydrolase and another that could constitutively express activities for both imidazolone propionate hydrolase and formylglutamate hydrolase, has provided evidence for the organization of all hut genes.
TI  - Immunological and structural relatedness of catabolic ornithine carbamoyltransferases and the anabolic enzymes of enterobacteria.
AB  - Purified catabolic ornithine carbamoyltransferase of Pseudomonas putida and anabolic ornithine carbamoyltransferase (argF product) of Escherichia coli K-12 were used to prepare antisera. The two specific antisera gave heterologous cross-reactions of various intensities with bacterial catabolic ornithine carbamoyltransferases formed by Pseudomonas and representative organisms of other bacterial genera. The immunological cross-reactivity observed only between the catabolic ornithine carbamoyltransferases and the anabolic enzymes of enterobacteria suggests that these proteins share some structural similarities. Indeed, the amino acid composition of the anabolic ornithine carbamoyltransferase of E. coli K-12 (argF and argI products) closely resembles the amino acid compositions of the catabolic enzymes of Pseudomonas putida, Aeromonas formicans, Streptococcus faecalis, and Bacillus licheniformis. Comparison of the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the E. coli anabolic ornithine carbamoyltransferase with that of the A. formicans and Pseudomonas putida catabolic enzymes shows, respectively, 45 and 28% identity between the compared positions; the A. formicans sequence reveals 53% identity with the Pseudomonas putida sequence. These results favor the conclusion that anabolic ornithine carbamoyltransferases of enterobacteria and catabolic ornithine carbamoyltransferases derive from a common ancestral gene.
TI  - Versatile mercury-resistant cloning and expression vectors.
AB  - Cloning vectors have been constructed employing two diverse replicons, IncQ and P15A. Both vectors confer resistance to kanamycin (Km) and mercuric ions (Hg2+). One of these vectors, pDG105, is a broad-host-range, nonconjugative, oligocopy IncQ plasmid, which is capable of transforming Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and Pseudomonas putida. The second vector, pDG106, is a narrow-host-range, multicopy cloning vector compatible with pBR322. Both vectors contain unique cloning sites in the Km-resistance gene for HindIII, SmaI, and XhoI, as well as unique EcoRI and ScaI sites in the mer operon. Cloning into the EcoRI site in the mer operon results in the mercury "supersensitive" phenotype, easily detectable by replica plating. Insertion of the galK gene into the EcoRI site in the mer operon results in Hg2+-inducible galactokinase activity, demonstrating the application of these plasmids as regulated expression vectors.
TI  - Development of broad-host-range vectors for expression of cloned genes in Pseudomonas.
AB  - The cloning and expression of genes in Pseudomonas have been difficult, until now, due to the absence of vector systems that contain multiple restriction sites downstream from promoter sequences that are functional in Pseudomonas. We report here the construction of several broad-host-range vectors that can be utilized in either Pseudomonas or Escherichia coli and that rely on easily selectable antibiotic resistance markers with multiple cloning sites. These vectors were constructed by inserting the entire pUC13 sequence into derivatives of the RSF1010 wide-host-range plasmid. From this construction, other derivatives were obtained, specifically a lacZ::KmR fusion gene which provides an easily selectable marker in both E. coli and Pseudomonas. These vectors have been used to express the Pseudomonas putida cytochrome P450 monoxygenase gene in a P450-deficient P. putida strain. Thus, these vectors allow for the cloning, expression and selection of Pseudomonas genes in Pseudomonas by complementation.
TI  - Impact of cefotaxime on the fecal flora in children.
AB  - A differential quantitative analysis was used to study the effect of cefotaxime on the fecal flora in 26 hospitalized children ranging from two days to four years of age. Fecal specimens were obtained before, during and after therapy. This study was evaluated in comparison to 41 patients of the same age and from the same environment without antibiotic treatment or signs of infection. The fecal flora of the control group showed qualitative and quantitative stability. Two groups of species were distinguished: a group in which the upper limit was less than or equal to 10(7) bacteria/g of stool (Klebsiella, Enterobacter, other enterobacteria, Staphylococcus, Pseudomonas) and a group with less than or equal to 10(10) bacteria/g of stool (anaerobes, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus D). This stability of the control group of subjects allowed us to interpret the variations of microbial concentrations during and after cefotaxime treatment. In previous studies, we showed in the newborn a substantial risk of septicemia of intestinal origin when overgrowth occurred, especially with Klebsiella. With cefotaxime there was a decrease or a disappearance in 65% of E. coli and a slight decrease of Klebsiella and Enterobacter. This fact was of great interest in the treatment of endogenous secondary septicemia. We observed an appearance of Pseudomonas (nine Pseudomonas aeruginosa, two Pseudomonas putida, one Pseudomonas fluorescens) in 12 cases among the 26 children treated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Transcriptional control of the nah and sal hydrocarbon-degradation operons by the nahR gene product.
AB  - The positively regulated nah and sal operons of the NAH7 plasmid from Pseudomonas putida encode the enzymes for metabolism of naphthalene via salicylate. To study their coordinate regulation, a 6-kb DNA fragment containing the entire nahA gene (encoding naphthalene dioxygenase), the gene of the nah operon, was cloned into a RSF1010 plasmid derivative. Analysis of expression of nahA from the nah promoter in either Escherichia coli or Pseudomonas putida showed that a 1.6-kb DNA fragment from the nahR (nah operon regulatory locus) region was required in trans for (i) induction by salicylate; (ii) high-level expression of nahA, and (iii) complementation of nahR- mutants. Measurement of transcription in induced and uninduced P. putida showed that induction of the nah and sal operons occurred at the transcriptional level. The trans-acting positive regulatory gene, nahR, however, was constitutively transcribed.
TI  - Cyclocoelum mutabile infection and aortic rupture in an American coot (Fulica americana).
AB  - An American coot (Fulica americana) was found dead within the enclosed research compound of the South Central Poultry Research Laboratory at Mississippi State, Mississippi. Gross and microscopic examinations revealed the bird to be in good body condition; however, blood from the beak cavity and external nares was present. Biliary congestion, hemopericardium, blood-filled air sacs, and a ruptured, ascending aorta were also noted. Nineteen trematodes (Cyclocoelum mutabile) were found within the body cavity at necropsy. Bacteriological examination revealed the presence of Escherichia coli in both the heart and liver and Pseudomonas putida in the liver only. No virus was isolated.
TI  - Identification of the promoter of the Pseudomonas gene coding for carboxypeptidase G2.
AB  - A 213-bp region of noncoding DNA upstream of the ATG start codon of the Pseudomonas carboxypeptidase G2 (CPG2) structural gene has been shown to contain the CPG2 promoter. The mRNA start point (+1) on the DNA sequence has been identified by mapping the 5' end of the CPG2 transcript. The identified promoter region contains a -10 region (TATAAG) that closely resembles the Escherichia coli consensus sequence (TATAAT), but has no easily recognisable -35 region. The lack of homology in the -35 region explains why this particular pseudomonad gene is poorly expressed in E. coli. Similar sequence differences may turn out to be the cause of the generally observed inefficient expression of Pseudomonas genes in E. coli. The promoter region also carries a sequence (CTGGCACTCGAATTGCT) that closely matches the consensus nif promoter sequence (CTGGPyAPyPuNNNNTTGCA) of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Rhizobium, and a similar sequence (ATGGCATGGCGGTTGCT) found in the promoter region of the xylABC operon of the TOL plasmid of Pseudomonas putida.
TI  - Minimum bacterial density for bacteriophage replication: implications for significance of bacteriophages in natural ecosystems.
AB  - Bacteriophage 80 alpha did not increase in number in cultures containing less than about 1.0 X 10(4) to 1.5 X 10(4) CFU of Staphylococcus aureus per ml, but bacteriophage replication did occur when the number of bacteria exceeded this density, either initially or as a result of host cell multiplication. The minimum density of an asporogenous strain of Bacillus subtilis required for an increase in the number of bacteriophage SP beta cI was about 3 X 10(4) CFU/ml. The threshold density of Escherichia coli for the multiplication of bacteriophage T4 was about 7 X 10(3) CFU/ml. In the presence of montmorillonite, bacteriophage T4 did not increase in number until the E. coli population exceeded 10(4) CFU/ml. The mineralization of glucose was not affected in E. coli cultures inoculated with a low number of bacteriophage T4, but it could not be detected in cultures inoculated with a large number of phage. The numbers of bacteriophage T4 and a bacteriophage that lyses Pseudomonas putida declined rapidly after being added to lake water or sewage. We suggest that bacteriophages do not affect the number or activity of bacteria in environments where the density of the host species is below the host cell threshold of about 10(4) CFU/ml.
TI  - Transposon donor plasmids, based on ColIb-P9, for use in Pseudomonas putida and a variety of other gram negative bacteria.
AB  - The properties of pLG221, a derivative of the ColIb plasmid carrying the transposon Tn5 are described. This plasmid can be used to introduce Tn5 by conjugation from Escherichia coli into a variety of Gram negative bacteria outside the host range for maintenance of ColIb. Plasmid pLG221, and a similar plasmid pLG223 carrying Tn10 may be of general utility as vectors for transposon-mediated mutagenesis in a variety of Gram negative bacteria.
TI  - Shuttle vector for Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas putida, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - A hybrid plasmid capable of replication in 2 different genera, Escherichia and Pseudomonas, was constructed. This plasmid DNA can be used as a cloning vector in E. coli and pseudomonades cells. The described hybrid plasmid pLD411 has been constructed on the basis of 2 small E. coli vector R-plasmids used in our laboratory and cryptic plasmid pWW2 or P. putida MT1. Plasmid pLD411 DNA was mapped with restrictases; its biological activity in transformations of different bacterial strains was studied, and the characteristics of transformed cells were also described.
TI  - Aromatic acids are chemoattractants for Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - A quantitative capillary assay was used to show that aromatic acids, compounds that are chemorepellents for Escherichia coli and Salmonella sp., are chemoattractants for Pseudomonas putida PRS2000. The most effective attractants were benzoate; p-hydroxybenzoate; the methylbenzoates; m-, p-, and o-toluate; salicylate; DL-mandelate; beta-phenylpyruvate; and benzoylformate. The chemotactic responses to these compounds were inducible. Taxis to benzoate and m-toluate was induced by beta-ketoadipate, a metabolic intermediate formed when benzoate is dissimilated via enzymes specified by chromosomal genes. Benzoylformate taxis was induced by benzoylformate and L(+)-mandelate. Taxis to mandelate, benzoylformate, and beta-phenylpyruvate was exhibited by cells grown on mandelate, but not by cells grown on benzoate. Cells grown on benzoate were chemotactic to benzoate, the toluates, p-hydroxybenzoate, and salicylate. These results show that P. putida synthesizes at least two distinct chemoreceptors for aromatic acids. Although DL-mandelate was an effective attractant in capillary assays, additional experiments indicated that the cells were actually responding to benzoylformate, a metabolite formed from mandelate. With the exception of mandelate taxis, chemotaxis to aromatic acids was not dependent on the expression of pathways for aromatic degradation. Therefore, the tactic responses exhibited by cells cannot be attributed to an effect of the oxidation of aromatic acids on the energy metabolism of cells.
TI  - Genetic and physical analyses of Caulobacter crescentus trp genes.
AB  - Caulobacter crescentus trp mutants were identified from a collection of auxotrophs. Precursor feeding experiments, accumulation studies, and complementation experiments resulted in the identification of six genes corresponding to trpA, trpB, trpC, trpD, trpE, and trpF. Genetic mapping experiments demonstrated that the trp genes were in two clusters, trpCDE and trpFBA, and a 5.4-kilobase restriction fragment from the C. crescentus chromosome was isolated that contained the trpFBA gene cluster. Complementation experiments with clones containing the 5.4-kilobase fragment indicated that trpF was expressed in Escherichia coli and that all three genes were expressed in Pseudomonas putida. This expression was lost in both organisms when the pBR322 tet gene promoter was inactivated, indicating that all three genes were transcribed in the same orientation from the tet promoter. Thus, the C. crescentus promoters do not seem to be expressed in E. coli or P. putida. Complementation of the C. crescentus trp mutants indicated that the tet promoter was not necessary for expression in C. crescentus and suggested that at least two native promoters were present for expression of the trpF, trpB, and trpA genes. Taken together, these results indicate that C. crescentus promoters may have structures that are significantly different from the promoters of other gram-negative species.
TI  - Transposon mutagenesis analysis of meta-cleavage pathway operon genes of the TOL  plasmid of Pseudomonas putida mt-2.
AB  - Hybrid plasmids containing the regulated meta-cleavage pathway operon of TOL plasmid pWWO were mutagenized with transposon Tn1000 or Tn5. The resulting insertion mutant plasmids were examined for their ability to express eight of the catabolic enzymes in Escherichia coli. The physical locations of the insertions in each of 28 Tn1000 and 5 Tn5 derivative plasmids were determined by restriction endonuclease cleavage analysis. This information permitted the construction of a precise physical and genetic map of the meta-cleavage pathway operon. The gene order xylD (toluate dioxygenase), L (dihydroxycyclohexidiene carboxylate dehydrogenase), E (catechol 2,3-dioxygenase), G (hydroxymuconic semialdehyde dehydrogenase), F (hydroxymuconic semialdehyde hydrolase), J (2-oxopent-4-enoate hydratase), I (4-oxalocrotonate decarboxylase), and H (4-oxalocrotonate tautomerase) was established, and gene sizes were estimated. Tn1000 insertions within catabolic genes exerted polar effects on distal structural genes of the operon, but not on an adjacent regulatory gene xylS.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence of the promoter region of the xylDEGF operon on TOL plasmid of Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - The transcription initiation site of the xylDEGF operon on the TOL plasmid of Pseudomonas putida mt-2 was determined in P. putida and in Escherichia coli by S1 nuclease and reverse transcriptase mapping. The induced synthesis of mRNA started at the same start point in both P. putida and E. coli, although the amount of mRNA in E. coli cells was less than that in P. putida. The nucleotide sequence of the region surrounding the start point was also determined. The ribosome-binding site (RBS) complementary to the 3' end of the 16S rRNA of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and E. coli preceded the predicted start codon for the xylD gene. The consensus nucleotide sequence for E. coli promoters was not found in the region preceding the transcription start point. On the other hand, the sequences of the "-10" and the "-35" regions of the xylDEGF operon revealed some homology with the respective, previously determined sequences of the xylABC operon of the TOL plasmid.
TI  - Sequence of the small subunit of yeast carbamyl phosphate synthetase and identification of its catalytic domain.
AB  - The yeast gene CPA1 coding for the small subunit of arginine-specific carbamyl phosphate synthetase has been cloned by complementation of a cpa 1 mutant with a plasmid library of total yeast chromosomal DNA. Two of the plasmids, pJL113/ST4 and pJL113/ST15, contain DNA inserts in opposite orientations with overlapping sequences of 2.6 kilobases. The nucleotide sequence of a 2.2-kilobase region of the DNA insert carrying the CPA1 gene has been determined. The CPA1 gene has been identified to be 1233 nucleotides long and to code for a polypeptide of 411 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 45,358. The amino acid sequence encoded in CPA1 is homologous to the recently determined sequence of the small subunit of Escherichia coli carbamyl phosphate synthetase (Piette, J., Nyunoya, H., Lusty, C.J., Cunin, R., Weyens, G., Crabeel, M., Charlier, D., Glandsdorff, N., and Pierard, A. (1984) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 81, 4134-4138) over the entire length of the polypeptide chain. Comparison of the amino acid sequences of the small subunits of yeast and E. coli carbamyl phosphate synthetases to the sequences of Component II of anthranilate and p-aminobenzoate synthases suggests that these amidotransferases are evolutionarily related. The most highly conserved region of the yeast and E. coli enzymes includes a cysteine residue previously found to be at the active site of Pseudomonas putida anthranilate synthase Component II (Kawamura, M., Keim, P.S., Goto, Y., Zalkin, H., and Heinrikson, R.L. (1978) J. Biol. Chem. 253, 4659-4668). Based on the observed homologies in the primary sequences of the other amidotransferases examined, we propose a 13-amino acid long sequence to be part of the catalytic domain of this class of enzymes.
TI  - Novel system for recognizing and eliminating foreign DNA in Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - Derivatives of pQSR49 (R1162::Tn1) containing cloned fragments of Escherichia coli chromosomal DNA are stable in E. coli but unstable in Pseudomonas putida. Similar derivatives containing P. putida chromosomal DNA are stable in both species. Instability is a consequence of plasmid loss during growth and is not due to death or inhibition of growth of plasmid-containing cells. Average copy numbers per cell of the unstable hybrid plasmids are similar to that of pQSR49, indicating that instability is not the result of reduced replication of plasmid DNA. A plasmid unrelated to pQSR49, RK2, becomes unstable in the presence of the unstable hybrids but only when it also contains foreign DNA. The data suggest an inducible mechanism in P. putida active in the elimination of plasmid-borne foreign DNA from the cell.
TI  - Transposon Tn5 encodes streptomycin resistance in nonenteric bacteria.
AB  - Strains of Caulobacter crescentus, Pseudomonas putida, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Rhizobium meliloti, and Rhodopseudomonas sphaeroides carrying the kanamycin resistance-encoding transposon Tn5 were 15 to 500 times more resistant to streptomycin than transposon-free strains. The streptomycin resistance determinant, which is separable from the kanamycin resistance determinant of Tn5, was not expressed in Escherichia coli or Klebsiella aerogenes.
TI  - Enzyme recruitment in vitro: use of cloned genes to extend the range of haloaromatics degraded by Pseudomonas sp. strain B13.
AB  - DNA fragments containing the xylD and xylL genes of TOL plasmid pWW0 -161 of Pseudomonas putida, which code for the catabolic enzymes toluate 1,2-dioxygenase and dihydrodihydroxybenzoic acid dehydrogenase, respectively, and the nahG gene of the NAH plasmid NAH7 , which codes for salicylate hydroxylase, were cloned in pBR322 vector plasmid. Deletion and insertion mutagenesis were used to localize these genes with respect to crucial endonuclease cleavage sites. The pBR322-based plasmids were ligated to the broad host range cloning vector pKT231 , or derivatives of it, and the hybrid plasmids were introduced into Pseudomonas sp. B13( WR1 ), a bacterium able to degrade 3-chlorobenzoate but not 4-chlorobenzoate, 3,5- dichlorobenzoate , salicylate, or chlorosalicylates . The cloned xylD gene expanded the catabolic range of WR1 to include 4-chlorobenzoate, whereas the cloned xylD - xylL genes enabled the isolation of derivatives of WR1 that degraded 3-chlorobenzoate, 4-chlorobenzoate, and 3,5- dichlorobenzoate . The cloned nahG gene extended the catabolic range of WR1 to include salicylate and 3-, 4-, and 5- chlorosalicylate .
TI  - [Introduction of the hybrid plasmid RP4::D3112 into Pseudomonas putida cells requires the presence of specific mutation in the phage genome].
AB  - The wild type of D3112, a transposable phage of Pseudomonas aeruginosa can not be introduced as a portion of the hybrid plasmid RP4::D3112 into Pseudomonas putida cells. It is only possible when phage D3112 carries mutations designated lpc (lethal for P. putida and Escherichia coli). Analysis of heteroduplex molecules between DNAs of phages D3112w+ and D3112lpc demonstrated the absence of nonhomology regions, which suggests that lpc is a point mutation. The lpc2 mutation was located within the interval 20-29.9 kb of the phage genome.
TI  - The use of Mudlac transposons as tools for vital staining to visualize clonal and non-clonal patterns of organization in bacterial growth on agar surfaces.
AB  - When a histochemical stain for beta-galactosidase activity is applied to growth of Gram-negative bacteria on agar medium, the pigmentation is non-uniform and capable of revealing internal colony organization into different cell types. Use of an Escherichia coli strain with a thermosensitive lac repressor indicates that colonies expand by addition of new cells at the periphery and that older cells which have synthesized beta-galactosidase early in development remain in the centre. Mixed inocula of different strains show clonal exclusiveness as they proliferate outwards. Mudlac transposons can create genetic fusions that place beta-galactosidase expression under a variety of regulatory systems. Stained surface cultures of E. coli and Pseudomonas putida strains carrying Mudlac insertions in plasmids reveal a variety of flower-like staining patterns. These patterns display both clonal (i.e. sectorial) and non-clonal (circular and radial) features which are heritable within a given strain. The non-clonal aspects of the patterns reflect phenotypic differentiation without genetic change. These observations indicate that bacterial growth on agar surfaces is a highly regulated process similar, in many respects, to the development of specific multicellular tissues and organisms.
TI  - Attachment of diaminopimelic acid to bdelloplast peptidoglycan during intraperiplasmic growth of Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus 109J.
AB  - An early event in the predatory lifestyle of Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus 109J is the attachment of diaminopimelic acid (DAP) to the peptidoglycan of its prey. Attachment occurs over the first 60 min of the growth cycle and is mediated by an extracellular activity(s) produced by the bdellovibrio. Some 40,000 DAP residues are incorporated into the Escherichia coli bdelloplast wall, amounting to ca. 2 to 3% of the total initial DAP content of its prey cells. Incorporation of DAP occurs when E. coli, Pseudomonas putida, or Spirillum serpens are the prey organisms. The structurally similar compounds lysine, ornithine, citrulline, and 2,4-diaminobutyric acid are not attached. The attachment process is not affected by heat-killing the prey nor by the addition of inhibitors of either energy generation (cyanide, azide, or arsenate), protein or RNA synthesis (chloramphenicol and rifamycin), or de novo synthesis of cell wall (penicillin or vancomycin). Approximately one-third of the incorporated DAP is exchangeable with exogenously added unlabeled DAP, whereas the remaining incorporated DPA is solubilized only during the lysis of the bdelloplast wall. Examination of DAP incorporation at low prey cell densities suggests that bdellovibrios closely couple the incorporation to an independent, enzymatic solubilization of DAP by a peptidase. The data indicate that DAP incorporation is a novel process, representing the second example of the ability of the bdellovibrio to biosynthetically modify the wall of its prey.
TI  - Structure and function of the TRP3 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae: Analysis of  transcription, promoter sequence, and sequence coding for a glutamine amidotransferase.
AB  - The structure and function of the TRP3 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae were analyzed. Subcloning of an original 4.8 kb BamHI DNA fragment, carrying the yeast TRP3 gene, allowed for a localization of the gene on a 2.5 kb ClaI/BamHI fragment. Transcription was found to proceed from the ClaI site towards the BamHI site. Three major transcription start sites were determined at positions -92, -87, and -81 by S1-mapping. The synthesis of the TRP3 gene is regulated by the general control, and was found to take place- at the transcriptional level. The sequence of the 5'-noncoding region up to position -400 and part of the coding region to position 840 were determined. The 5'-noncoding region contains sequences common to most amino acid biosynthetic genes known so far, namely a presumptive ribosome binding site, "Goldberg-Hogness boxes", and a consensus sequence, possibly involved in the general control. For the coding region a single open reading frame was found. The deduced amino acid sequence was aligned with homologous amino acid sequences of Neurospora crassa, Pseudomonas putida and Escherichia coli. The exceptionally high homology (40-60%) between these sequences led us to postulate that the TRP3 gene product is of the structure NH2-glutamine amidotransferase-indole-3-glycerol-phosphate synthase-COOH.
TI  - Relationship of lipoamide dehydrogenases from Pseudomonas putida to other FAD-linked dehydrogenases.
AB  - Pseudomonas putida produces two lipoamide dehydrogenases, LPD-glc and LPD-val. LPD-val is specifically required as the lipoamide dehydrogenase of branched-chain keto acid dehydrogenase and LPD-glc fulfills all other requirements for lipoamide dehydrogenase. Both proteins are dimers with one FAD per subunit. LPD-glc has an absorption maximum at 455 nm, but LPD-val has a maximum at 460 nm. Comparison of amino acid compositions revealed that LPD-glc was more closely related to Escherichia coli and pig heart lipoamide dehydrogenase than to LPD-val. LPD-val did not appear to be closely related to any of the proteins compared with the possible exception of mercuric reductase.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence surrounding transcription initiation site of xylABC operon on TOL plasmid of Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - The xylABC operon on the TOL plasmid directs the synthesis of enzymes for conversion of toluene to benzoate and is positively controlled by the regulatory gene xylR. In the study here the nucleotide sequence was determined for the regulatory region of this operon. The in vivo transcription initiation site of the operon was determined by S1 nuclease and reverse transcriptase mapping. RNA was prepared from m-methylbenzyl alcohol-induced cells of Pseudomonas putida and Escherichia coli carrying pTN2, a derivative of the TOL plasmid containing the structural and regulatory genes of the entire toluene-degrading pathway. The amount of E. coli mRNA was estimated to be only 10% of that of P. putida mRNA. Consensus sequences of the -10 region (Pribnow box) and the -35 region (RNA polymerase recognition site) in E. coli genes were not found in the region preceding the transcription initiation site, whereas a sequence complementary to the 3' end of the 16S rRNA of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and E. coli existed in front of the predicted start codon of the xylA gene. These results explain the inefficient expression of TOL genes in E. coli.
TI  - Permeability of the boundary layers of Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus 109J and its bdelloplasts to small hydrophilic molecules.
AB  - Measurements of the sucrose-permeable and -impermeable volumes during Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus attack on Escherichia coli or Pseudomonas putida showed that the volume of the bdelloplast increased over that of the substrate cell. Although the pattern of the increase differed with the two organisms, the volumes reached maximum at about 60 min into the bdellovibrio growth cycle. By this time, the cytoplasmic membranes of the attacked cells were completely permeable to sucrose. The kinetics of increase in sucrosepermeable volumes were similar to the kinetics of attachment and penetration (Varon and Shilo, J. Bacteriol. 95:744-753, 1968). These data show that the original cytoplasmic and periplasmic compartmentalization of the substrate cell ceases to exist with respect to small hydrophilic molecules during bdellovibrio attack. In contrast, the effective pore size of the outer membrane of the substrate cell to small oligosaccharides remains unaltered during bdelloplast formation as was shown by direct measurements of its exclusion limits. The major porin protein of E. coli, OmpF, was recoverable from the bdelloplast outer membrane fraction until the onset of lysis. The Braun lipoprotein was removed from the bdelloplast wall early, and OmpA was lost in the terminal part of the bdellovibrio growth cycle.
TI  - Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida RNA polymerases display identical contacts with promoters.
AB  - Methylation protection experiments with four promoters (P1 and P2 of the pBR322 plasmid, lacUV5 and lambda P0) have shown that the RNA polymerases from Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida, while differing in the primary structure of the subunits involved in DNA binding, display identical patterns of DNA contacts. Nor do these enzymes differ in covalent cross-linking patterns with a partially apurinized promoter. We conclude that the two RNA polymerases have very similar structures of DNA binding centers. The evolutionary conservation of this structure may account for the fact that diverse RNA polymerases often recognize and efficiently use promoters of distant bacterial species.
TI  - Molecular cloning of the Pseudomonas carboxypeptidase G2 gene and its expression  in Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - The gene coding for carboxypeptidase G2 was cloned from Pseudomonas sp. strain RS-16 into Escherichia coli W5445 by inserting Sau3A-generated DNA fragments into the BamHI site of pBR322. The plasmid isolated, pNM1, was restriction mapped, and the position of the gene on the 5.8-megadalton insert was pinpointed by subcloning. The expression of carboxypeptidase in E. coli was 100-fold lower than in the Pseudomonas sp. strain. When the cloned gene was subcloned into the Pseudomonas vector pKT230 and introduced into Pseudomonas putida 2440, a 30-fold increase in expression over that obtained in E. coli was observed. High expression (up to 5% soluble protein) was obtained in E. coli by subcloning a 3.1-megadalton Bg/II fragment into the BamHI site of pAT153. The increased expression was orientation dependent and is presumed to be due to transcriptional readthrough from the Tc promoter of the vector. Production of carboxypeptidase was shown to be induced (two-fold) by the presence of folic acid, and the mature protein was shown to be located in the periplasmic space of E. coli.
TI  - Activity of the hybrid trp-lac (tac) promoter of Escherichia coli in Pseudomonas  putida. Construction of broad-host-range, controlled-expression vectors.
AB  - A broad-host-range vector, pKT240, containing the structural gene (aph) for aminoglycoside phosphotransferase (APH), without promoter, has been constructed. Insertion of DNA fragments carrying promoters upstream of aph gene into the unique EcoRI site of this vector results in the expression of the aph gene and consequently the resistance of the host cells to streptomycin. The new vector has been used to show that the hybrid trp-lac (tac) promoter and the promoter of the lacIQ gene of Escherichia coli are active in Pseudomonas putida. Derivatives of pKT240 containing tac and lacIQ sequences may be used as wide-host-range expression vectors. Regulated overproduction of APH and catechol 2,3-oxygenase can be obtained with the aid of the new vectors in both E. coli and P. putida.
TI  - Plasmid-encoded regulation of colicin E1 gene expression.
AB  - A plasmid-encoded factor that regulates the expression of the colicin E1 gene was found in molecular cloning experiments. The 2,294-base-pair AvaII fragment of the colicin E1 plasmid (ColE1) carrying the colicin E1 structural gene and the promoter-operator region had the same information with respect to the repressibility and inducibility of colicin E1 synthesis as the original ColE1 plasmid. An operon fusion was constructed between the 204-bp fragment containing the colicin E1 promoter-operator and xylE, the structural gene for catechol 2,3-dioxygenase encoded on the TOL plasmid of Pseudomonas putida. The synthesis of the dioxygenase from the resulting plasmid occurred in recA+, but not in recA- cells and was derepressed in the recA lexA(Def) double mutant. These results indicate that the ColE1 plasmid has no repressor gene for colicin E1 synthesis and that the lexA protein functions as a repressor. Colicin E1 gene expression was adenosine 3',5'-phosphate (cAMP) dependent. Upon the removal of two PvuII fragments (2,000 bp in length) from the ColE1 plasmid, the induced synthesis of colicin E1 occurred in the adenylate-cyclase mutant even without cAMP. The 3,100-bp Tth111I fragment of the ColE1 plasmid cloned on pACYC177 restored the cAMP dependency of the deleted ColE1 plasmid. Since the deleted fragments correspond to the mobility region of ColE1, the cAMP dependency of the gene expression should be somehow related to the plasmid mobilization function.
TI  - Expression of naphthalene oxidation genes in Escherichia coli results in the biosynthesis of indigo.
AB  - A fragment of plasmid NAH7 from Pseudomonas putida PpG7 has been cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli HB101. Growth of the recombinant Escherichia coli in nutrient medium results in the formation of indigo. The production of this dye is increased in the presence of tryptophan or indole. Several bacteria that oxidize aromatic hydrocarbons to cis-dihydrodiols also oxidize indole to indigo. The results suggest that indigo formation is due to the combined activities of tryptophanase and naphthalene dioxygenase.
TI  - Stereospecificity in meta-fission catabolic pathways.
AB  - The stereospecificities of 2-keto-4-pentenoate hydratase and 4-hydroxy-2-ketovalerate aldolase were studied in Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas putida, and Acinetobacter sp. Hydration was stereospecific in all three; however, only P. putida and Acinetobacter sp. showed stereospecificity in their aldolase reactions.
TI  - Replication of derivatives of the broad host range plasmid RK2 in two distantly related bacteria.
AB  - A 0.7-kb segment of the broad host range plasmid RK2 containing the replication origin of this plasmid will replicate in Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida when this segment is joined to a 1.8-kb region of RK2 designated traA*. The presence of another region of RK2, designated trfB, that previously was implicated in RK2 replication had no effect on the maintenance of the RK2 trfA*-oriV replicon in these two organisms. These observations indicate a requirement for a minimal account of information for replication of this broad host range plasmid in two distantly related bacteria.
TI  - Expression of the argF gene of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in Pseudomonas aeruginosa,  Pseudomonas putida, and Escherichia coli.
AB  - R' plasmids carrying argF genes from Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains PAO and PAC were transferred to Pseudomonas putida argF and Escherichia coli argF strains. Expression in P. putida was similar to that in P. aeruginosa and was repressed by exogenous arginine. Expression in E. coli was 2 to 4% of that in P. aeruginosa. Exogenous arginine had no effect, and there were no significant differences between argR' and argR strains of E. coli in this respect.
TI  - [Range of the transmissivity of the genetic transfer factors pAP38, pAP39, pAP41  and pAP42].
AB  - A study was made of the transmissivity range of the genetic transfer factors pAP38, pAP39, pAP41 and pAP42 identified in E. coli. It was demonstrated that these factors are not capable of transfer to the cells of P. putida, P. fluorescens, R. leguminosarum, A. lipoferum, A. tumefaciens. Factor pAP42 is mobilized to transfer to P. putida and R. leguminosarum with the aid of plasmid RP4. It is assumed that in the course of mobilization, the cointegrative structures are formed between plasmids pAP42 and RP4.
TI  - Complete nucleotide sequence of the metapyrocatechase gene on the TOI plasmid of  Pseudomonas putida mt-2.
AB  - Metapyrocatechase which catalyzes the oxygenative ring cleavage of catechol to form alpha-hydroxymuconic epsilon-semialdehyde is encoded by the xylE gene on the TOL plasmid of Pseudomonas putida mt-2. We have cloned the xylE region in Escherichia coli and determined the nucleotide sequence of the DNA fragment of 985 base pairs around the gene. The fragment included only one open translational frame of sufficient length to accommodate the enzyme. The predicted amino acid sequence consisted of 307 residues, and its NH2- and COOH-terminal sequences were in perfect agreement with those of the enzyme recently determined (Nakai, C., Hori, K., Kagamiyama, H., Nakazawa, T., and Nozaki, M. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 2916-2922). A mutant plasmid was isolated which did not direct the synthesis of the active enzyme. This plasmid had a DNA region corresponding to the NH2-terminal two-thirds of the polypeptide. From the deduced amino acid sequence, the secondary structure was predicted. Around 10 base pairs upstream from the initiator codon for metapyrocatechase, there was a base sequence which was complementary to the 3'-end of 16 S rRNAs from both E.coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. A preferential usage of C- and G-terminated codons was found in the coding region xylE, which contributed to the relatively high G + C content (57%) of this gene.
TI  - Chromogenic identification of genetic regulatory signals in Bacillus subtilis based on expression of a cloned Pseudomonas gene.
AB  - A method to isolate fragments of DNA that promote gene expression in Bacillus subtilis is described. The system is based on production of catechol 2,3-dioxygenase [CatO2ase; catechol:oxygen 2,3-oxidoreductase (decyclizing), EC 1.13.11.2] encoded by the Pseudomonas putida TOL plasmid gene xylE. The gene was transferred to aB. subtilis/Escherichia coli plasmid vector to construct pTG402. Although xylE is functionally expressed in E. coli, CatO2ase is not detected in B. subtilis unless a fragment of DNA capable of promoting gene expression is ligated into a cleavage site on pTG402 upstream from xylE. Fragments of chromosomal DNA from B. subtilis, Bacillus licheniformis, Bacillus pumilus, and E. coli are shown to promote xylE gene expression in B. subtilis. The special feature of the system is the method of detection: colonies of cells that express xylE become yellow within seconds after selection plates are sprayed with catechol, a colorless substrate that is converted by CatO2ase to the yellow product, 2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde. The complete nucleotide sequence of xylE is presented. Strong complementarity between the ribosome binding site and 16S rRNA suggests that xylE mRNA translation in B. subtilis may commence at the same site as that recognized by P. putida. Identity of CatO2ase produced in B. subtilis, E. coli, and P. putida support the hypothesis. Our sensitive color assay offers an approach to develop plasmid gene expression vectors for a wide variety of host organisms.
TI  - Cloning and expression in Escherichia coli of the naphthalene degradation genes from plasmid NAH7.
AB  - The genes encoding the enzymes responsible for conversion of naphthalene to 2-hydroxymuconic acid (nahA through nahI) are contained on a 25-kilobase EcoRI fragment of an 85-kilobase NAH plasmid of Pseudomonas putida. These genes were cloned into the plasmid vectors pBR322 and RSF1010 to obtain the recombinant plasmids pKGX505 and pKGX511, respectively. To facilitate cloning and analysis, an NAH7 plasmid containing a Tn5 transposon in the salicylate hydroxylase gene (nahG) was used to derive the EcoRI fragment. The genes for naphthalene degradation were expressed at a low level in Escherichia coli strains containing the fragment on the recombinant plasmids pKGX505 or pKGX511. This was shown by the ability of whole cells to convert naphthalene to salicylic acid and by in vitro enzyme assays. The expression of at least two of these genes in E. coli appeared to be regulated by the presence of the inducer salicylic acid. In addition, high-level expression and induction appear to be mediated by an NAH plasmid promoter and a regulatory gene located on the fragment. A restriction endonuclease cleavage map of the cloned fragment was generated, and the map positions of several nah genes were determined by analysis of various subcloned DNA fragments.
TI  - [Transformation of Escherichia coli and different species of Pseudomonas by a plasmid DNA isolated from Pseudomonas testosteroni].
AB  - Pseudomonas testosteroni uses testosterone as sole source of carbon. We were able to isolate an extrachromosomal DNA from a strain of Pseudomonas testosteroni and to obtain Pseudomonas putida and aeruginosa and Escherichia coli transformants catabolizing testosterone.
TI  - Identification of chromosomally integrated TOL DNA in cured derivatives of Pseudomonas putida PAW1.
AB  - Some plasmid-free Tol- strains derived from Pseudomonas putida PAW1 (which carries the TOL plasmid pWW0) have a segment of TOL DNA located chromosomally. Of three independently isolated strains, PAW86 had an integrated TOL segment of 16 kilobases and PAW85 had two copies of this segment in different chromosomal locations, whereas the chromosomal DNA of PAW82 showed no homology with the TOL plasmid. In cultures of the parental strain, it appears that a 56-kilobase TOL DNA segment is located chromosomally in some cells.
TI  - Broad-host-range IncP-4 plasmid R1162: effects of deletions and insertions on plasmid maintenance and host range.
AB  - R1162 is an 8.7-kilobase (kb) broad-host-range replicon encoding resistance to streptomycin and sulfa drugs. In vitro deletion of 1.8-kb DNA between coordinates 3.0 and 5.3 kb did not affect plasmid maintenance, but a Tn1 insertion at coordinate 6.3 kb led to a recessive defect in plasmid maintenance. The only cis-acting region necessary for plasmid replication appears to lie between the Tn1 insertion at coordinate 6.3 kb and a second Tn1 insertion at coordinate 6.5 kb. All R1162 sequences between position 6.5 kb and the EcoRI site at coordinate 8.7/0 kb were dispensible for replication in Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida. Plasmids carrying insertions in a variety of restriction sites in an R1162::Tn1 derivative were unstable in P. putida but stable in E. coli. Tn5 insertions in R1162 showed a hot spot at coordinate 7.5 kb. A Tn5 insertion at coordinate 8.2 kb appeared to mark the 3' end of the streptomycin phosphotransferase coding sequence. All R1162::Tn5 derivatives showed specific instability in Pseudomonas strains but not in E. coli. The instability could be relieved by internal deletions of Tn5 sequences. In the haloaromatic-degrading Pseudomonas sp. strain B13, introduction of an unstable R1162::Tn5 plasmid led to loss of ability to utilize m-chlorobenzoate as a growth substrate. Our results showed that alteration of plasmid sequence organization in nonessential regions can result in restriction of plasmid host range.
TI  - [Expression of the genome of Mu-like phage D3112 specific for Pseudomonas aeruginosa in Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida cells].
AB  - The behavior of Escherichia coli cells carrying RP4 plasmid which contains the genome of a Mu-like D3112 phage specific for Pseudomonas aeruginosa was studied. Two different types of D3112 genome expression were revealed in E. coli. The first is BP4-dependent expression. In this case, expression of certain D3112 genes designated as "kil" only takes place when RP4 is present. As a result, cell division stops at 30 degrees C and cells form filaments. Cell division is not blocked at 42 degrees C. The second type of D3112 genome expression is RP4-independent. A small number of phage is produced independently of RP4 plasmid but this does not take place at 42 degrees C. No detectable quantity of the functionally active repressor of the phage was determined in E. coli (D3112). It is possible that the only cause for cell stability of E. coli (D3112) or E. coli (RP4::D3112) at 42 degrees C in the absence of the repressor is the fact of an extremely poor expression of D3112. In another heterologous system, P. putida both ways of phage development (lytic and lysogenic) are observed. This special state of D3112 genome in E. coli cells is proposed to be named "conditionally expressible prophage" or, in short, "conex-phage", to distinguish it from a classical lysogenic state when stability is determined by repressor activity. Specific blockade of cell division, due to D3112 expression, was also found in P. putida cells. It is evident that the kil function of D3112 is not specific to recognize the difference between division machinery of bacteria belonging to distinct species or genera. Protein synthesis is needed to stop cell division and during a short time period this process could be reversible. Isolation of E. coli (D3112) which lost RP4 plasmid may be regarded as an evidence for D3112 transposition in E. coli. Some possibilities for using the system to look for E. coli mutants with modified expression of foreign genes are considered.
TI  - Oxygen tolerance of strictly aerobic hydrogen-oxidizing bacteria.
AB  - Growth of various bacteria, especially aerobic hydrogen-oxidizing bacteria, in the presence of 2 to 100% (v/v) oxygen in the gas atmosphere was evaluated. The bacterial strains included Alcaligenes eutrophus, A. paradoxus, Aquaspirillum autotrophicum, Arthrobacter spec. strain 11 X, Escherichia coli, Arthrobacter globiformis, Nocardia opaca, N. autotrophica, Paracoccus denitrificans, Pseudomonas facilis, P. putida, and Xanthobacter autotrophicus. Under heterotrophic conditions with fructose or gluconate as substrates neither colony formation on solid medium nor the growth rates in liquid media were drastically impaired by up to 100% oxygen. In contrast, autotrophic growth--with hydrogen, carbon dioxide and up to 80% oxygen in the gas atmosphere--was strongly depressed by high oxygen concentrations. However, only the growth rate, not the viability of the cells, was decreased. Growth retardation was accompanied by a decrease of hydrogenase activity.
TI  - [Integration of the genome of the Mu-like Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteriophage D3112 into plasmid RP4 and its hybrid plasmid transfer into Pseudomonas putida and Escherichia coli C600 bacteria].
AB  - The genome of a Mu-like bacteriophage D3112 specific for Pseudomonas aeruginosa was integrated in vivo into the RP4 plasmid. The fact of integration has been proved by two experiments: 1. The loss of RP4 plasmid is accompanied by loss of D3112 prophage; 2. Transfer of the plasmid by conjugation from Pseudomonas aeruginosa into bacteria of other species - P. putida PgG1 or Escherichia coli C600 leads to the occurrence of clones of these species which liberate phage capable of growing on the lawn of P. aeruginosa bacteria. The integrated state of D3112 inserted into RP4 is stable in P. aeruginosa, E. coli, P. putida. The transfer frequency of RP4 with integrated D3112 prophage into different bacteria which do not contain homoimmune prophage is essentially lower than that of the RP4 having no D3112 prophage. Specific manifestation of D3112 genome activity in E. coli cells is the sensitivity of cell growth to lower temperature (30 degrees C) of incubation.
TI  - Molecular and functional analysis of the TOL plasmid pWWO from Pseudomonas putida and cloning of genes for the entire regulated aromatic ring meta cleavage pathway.
AB  - The genetic organization of the Pseudomonas putida plasmid pWWO-161, which encodes enzymes for the degradation of toluene and related aromatic hydrocarbons, has been investigated by transposition mutagenesis and gene cloning. Catabolic genes were localized to two clusters, one for upper pathway (hydrocarbon leads to carboxylic acid) enzymes and the other for lower pathway (carboxylic acid leads to tricarboxylic acid cycle) enzymes, that are separated by a 14-kilobase DNA segment. The physical organization of the catabolic genes thus reflects their functional organization into two regulatory blocks. The pWWO-161 DNA fragments Sst I fragment C and fragment D were cloned in a broad host range vector to produce plasmid pKT530. This hybrid encodes toluate oxygenase and all meta cleavage pathway enzymes, and it enables P. putida mt-2 and Escherichia coli K-12 cells to grow on m-toluate as sole carbon source. The pKT530 plasmid also carries xylS (a gene whose product has been postulated to regulate expression of the lower pathway genes) and the control sequences of the pathway that interact with this product, because catechol 2,3-oxygenase synthesis is specifically induced by m-toluate in both P. putida and E. coli. Evidence is presented that suggests the promoter operator of the meta pathway gene functions less effectively with the RNA polymerase or xylS product of E. coli than with the enzyme or product of P. putida.
TI  - Transfer of nitrogen fixation genes into Pseudomonas putida isolated from Finnish tundra soil.
AB  - The plasmid pRD1 containing the nif genes from Klebsiella pneumoniae was transferred by conjugation from Escherichia coli to Pseudomonas putida isolated from the tundra soil. 6-Cyanopurine, acetylene reduction and immunological tests showed that the nif genes were not expressed in P. putida. Existence of the nif genes in P. putida transconjugants was detected by transferring them to E. coli C600, which does not fix nitrogen. Existence of the nif genes in E. coli C600 transconjugants was detected immunologically and by acetylene reduction tests.
TI  - Specific-purpose plasmid cloning vectors. II. Broad host range, high copy number, RSF1010-derived vectors, and a host-vector system for gene cloning in Pseudomonas.
AB  - Host-vector systems have been developed for gene cloning in the metabolically versatile bacterial genus Pseudomonas. They comprise restriction-negative host strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and P. putida and new cloning vectors derived from the high-copy-number, broad-host-range plasmid RSF1010, which are stably maintained in a wide range of Gram-negative bacteria. These plasmids contain EcoRI, SstI, HindIII, XmaI, XhoI, SalI, BamHI, and ClaI insertion sites. All cloning sites, except for BamHI and ClaI, are located within antibiotic-resistance genes' insertional inactivation of these genes during hybrid plasmid formation provides a readily scored phenotypic change for the rapid identification of bacterial clones carrying such hybrids. One of the new vector plasmids is a cosmid that may be used for the selective cloning of large DNA fragments by in vitro lambda packaging. An analogous series of vectors that are defective in their plasmid-mobilization function, and that exhibit a degree of biological containment comparable to that of current Escherichia coli vector plasmids, are also described.
TI  - [Study of the microbial multiplication in the muscle just after slaughter (author's transl)].
AB  - The bactericidal or bacteriostatic activity of the serum, the muscle and the rabbit meat juice was followed after slaughter on animals vaccinated or not against E. coli, P. putida, Cl. perfringens. Rabbit serum is bactericidal against gram negative bacteria, P. putida and E. coli. On the contrary it is without effect on Cl. perfringens. Muscle has no inhibitory effect against E. coli and Cl. perfringens on animals vaccinated or not. P. putida is inhibited or partially eliminated from rabbit muscle just after slaughter. Vaccination does not increase the bacteriostatic or bactericidal activities of the sera, the meat juices and intact muscles.
TI  - Molecular cloning of gene xylS of the TOL plasmid: evidence for positive regulation of the xylDEGF operon by xylS.
AB  - The xylDEGF operon and the regulatory gene xylS of the TOL plasmid found in Pseudomonas putida mt-2 were cloned onto Escherichia coli vector plasmids. A 9.5-kilobase fragment, derived from the TOL segment of pTN2 deoxyribonucleic acid, carried the xyl genes D, E, G, and F, which encode toluate oxygenase, catechol 2,3-oxygenase, 2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde dehydrogenase, and 2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde hydrolase, respectively. The enzymes were noninducible unless a 3-kilobase PstI fragment, derived also from the TOL segment, was provided in either cis or trans. The PstI fragment appeared to contain the regulatory gene xylS, which produced a positive regulator. The regulator was activated by m-toluate or benzoate, but not by m-xylene or m-methylbenzyl alcohol. the map positions of xylG and xylF were also determined.
TI  - Incorporation of substrate cell lipid A components into the lipopolysaccharide of intraperiplasmically grown Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus.
AB  - The composition of Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was determined for cells grown axenically and intraperiplasmically on Escherichia coli or Pseudomonas putida. The LPS of axenically grown bdellovibrios contained glucose and fucosamine as the only detectable neutral sugar and amino sugar, and nonadecenoic acid (19:1) as the predominant fatty acid. Additional fatty acids, heptose, ketodeoxyoctoic acid, and phosphate were also detected. LPS from bdellovibrios grown intraperiplasmically contained components characteristic of both axenically grown bdellovibrios and the substrate cells. Substrate cell-derived LPS fatty acids made up the majority of the bdellovibrio LPS fatty acids and were present in about the same proportions as in the substrate cell LPS. Glucosamine derived from E. coli LPS amounted to about one-third of the hexosamine residues in intraperiplasmically grown bdellovibrio LPS. However, galactose, characteristic of the E. coli outer core and O antigen, was not detected in the bdellovibrio LPS, suggesting that only lipid A components of the substrate cell were incorporated. Substrate cell-derived and bdellovibrio-synthesized LPS materials were conserved in the B. bacteriovorus outer membrane for at least two cycles of intraperiplasmic growth. When bdellovibrios were grown on two different substrate cells successively, lipid A components were taken up from the second while the components incorporated from the lipid A of the first were conserved in the bdellovibrio LPS. The data show that substrate cell lipid A components were incorporated into B. bacteriovorus lipid A during intraperiplasmic growth with little or no change, and that these components, fatty acids and hexosamines, comprised a substantial portion of bdellovibrio lipid A.
TI  - Glutamine synthetase of pseudomonads: some biochemical and physicochemical properties.
AB  - The glutamine synthetases from several Pseudomonas species were purified to homogeneity, and their properties were compared with those reported for the enzymes from Escherichia coli and other gram-negative bacteria. The glutamine synthetase from Pseudomonas fluorescens was unique because it was nearly precipitated quantitatively as a homogeneous protein during dialysis of partially purified preparations against buffer containing 10 mM imidazole (pH 7.0) and 10 mM MnCl2. The glutamine synthetases from Pseudomonas putida and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were purified by affinity chromatography on Affi-blue gel. Dodecamerous forms of the E. coli and P. fluorescens glutamine synthetases had identical mobilities during polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Their dissociated subunits, however, migrated differently and were readily separated by electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gels containing 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate. This difference in subunit mobilities is not related to the state of adenylylation. Regulation of the Pseudomonas glutamine synthetase activity is mediated by an adenylylation-deadenylylation cyclic cascade system. A sensitive procedure was developed for measuring the average number of adenylylated subunits per enzyme molecule for the glutamine synthetase from P. fluorescens. This method takes advantage of the large differences in transferase activity of the adenylylated and unadenylylated subunits at pH 6.0 and of the fact that the activities of both kinds of subunits are the same at pH 8.45.
TI  - Molecular cloning of TOL genes xylB and xylE in Escherichia coli.
AB  - The xylB and xylE genes in the TOL plasmid of Pseudomonas putida mt-2, which code for benzyl alcohol dehydrogenase and catechol 2,3-oxygenase, respectively, were cloned onto plasmid pBR322 in Escherichia coli for detailed mapping. The xylB gene was mapped in a 2.9-kilobase region within the BamHI BC fragment of pTN2, an in vivo RP4-TOL recombinant, whereas the xylE gene was mapped in a 1.8-kilobase region within the BamHI BD fragment. The directions of transcription of these genes were deduced from the expression of the cloned genes which had been ligated in orientations opposite pBR322 at its BamHI site within the tetracycline resistance gene. The xylB and xylE genes are inducible by a specific inducer of the TOL pathway genes in the RP4-TOL recombinant, whereas they are not inducible in the pBR322-TOL hybrids. The regulatory regions involved in expression of the xylB and xylE genes do not appear to be located in the vicinity of the structural genes. Catechol 2,3-oxygenase formed in E. coli carrying an xylE-containing plasmid is similar, or identical, to that formed in P. putida carrying the TOL plasmid.
TI  - Properties of six pesticide degradation plasmids isolated from Alcaligenes paradoxus and Alcaligenes eutrophus.
AB  - Biophysical and genetic properties of six independently isolated plasmids encoding the degradation of the herbicides 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and 4-chloro-2-methylphenoxyacetic acid are described. Four of the plasmids, pJP3, pJP4, pJP5, and pJP7, had molecular masses of 51 megadaltons, belonged to the IncP1 incompatibility group, and transferred freely to strains of Escherichia coli, Rhodopseudomonas sphaeroides, Rhizobium sp., Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Pseudomonas putida, Pseudomonas fluorescens, and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. In addition, these four plasmids conferred resistance to merbromin, phenylmercury acetate, and mercuric ions, had almost identical restriction endonuclease cleavage patterns, and encoded degradation of m-chlorobenzoate. The two other plasmids, pJP2 and pJP9, did not belong to the IncP1 incompatibility group, had molecular masses of 37 megadaltons, encoded the degradation of phenoxyacetic acid, and possessed identical restriction endonuclease cleavage patterns.
TI  - Expression of E. coli genes carried by hybrids of plasmid RP4.
AB  - Hybrids of the RP4 plasmid, containing bacteriophage Mu and chromosomal genes of  Escherichia coli, were transferred into Salmonella typhimurium, Pseudomonas putida, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis. The individual genes of the arginine, histidine, leucine and threonine operons were expressed in these microorganisms.
TI  - Chemical structure and inhalation toxicity of lipopolysaccharides from bacteria on cotton.
AB  - Lipopolysaccharides from different bacteria isolated from cotton were purified and chemically analyzed. Their pulmonary toxicity to animals was tested in inhalation tests. Lipopolysaccharides from Agrobacterium and Xanthomonas were shown to differ from the others in that they contained no heptose and no non-hydroxylated fatty acids with a chain length of 12, 14, or 16 carbon atoms. Lipopolysaccharides from Pseudomonas putida, Enterobacter agglomerans, and Klebsiella oxytoca were found to cause an influx of polymorphonuclear leukocytes into the airways. Lipopolysaccharides from Agrobacterium sp. and Xanthomonas sinensis caused no significant invasion. The data point to substances in both the lipid A part and the core part of the lipopolysaccharides being responsible for the capacity to induce leukocyte invasion into the airways.
TI  - Effect of different growth conditions on the discrimination of three bacteria by  pyrolysis gas-liquid chromatography.
AB  - High-resolution pyrolysis gas-liquid chromatography was applied to three bacteria (Escherichia coli NCTC 9001, Pseudomonas putida (NCIB 9494, and Staphylococcus aureus NCTC 8532) grown under a variety of conditions. Changing the culture medium drastically altered the quantitative aspects of the pyrograms of all three organisms, but the effects of culture time and incubation temperature were less severe. Mathematical analysis of the relative peak heights showed that four peaks could be used to discriminate the three bacteria however they were cultured.
TI  - Expression of the lactose transposon Tn951 in Escherichia coli, Proteus and Pseudomonas.
AB  - The control of beta-galactosidase specified by the lactose transposon Tn951 (inserted into RP1 to give pGC9114) has been studied in Escherichia coli K12, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas putida; in the first two species comparison could be made with Flac. In E. coli K12, the Tn951 and chromosomally encoded enzymes showed marked qualitative differences in regulatio, the former giving a substantially lower maximum induced level and induction ratio. Several parameters were slightly affected by strain background. In P. mirabilis, beta-galactosidase control determined by both Flac (in accord with earlier work) and pGC9114 was markedly different from E. coli in that maximal induced levels were about an order of magnitude lower and the induction ratio was reduced to 3 to 5. In Ps. aeruginosa and Ps. putida, Tn951-specified lac expression was qualitatively similar to that in P. mirabilis. Possible reasons for anomalous expression in Proteus and Pseudomonas are discussed.
TI  - Purification of glutamine synthetase from a variety of bacteria.
AB  - We have developed two procedures which allow the very rapid purification of glutamine synthetase (GS) from a diverse variety of bacteria. The first procedure, based upon differential sedimentation, depends upon the association of GS with deoxyribonucleic acid in cell extracts. The second procedure, derived from the method of C. Gross et al (J. Bacteriol. 128:382-389, 1976) for purifying ribonucleic acid polymerase by polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation, enabled us to obtain high yields of GS from either small or large quantities of cells. We used the PEG procedure to purify GS from Klebsiella aerogenes, K. pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Rhizobium sp. strain 32H1, R. meliloti, Azotobacter vinelandii, Pseudomonas putida, Caulobacter crescentus, and Rhodopseudomonas capsulata. The purity of the GS obtained, judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, was high, and in many instances only a single protein band was detected.
TI  - [Nucleoside catabolism study of Pseudomonas putida and Pseudomonas trifolii].
AB  - No activity of specific nucleoside phosphorylases was detected in Pseudomonas putida; as the result, its cells cannot grow on various nucleosides using them as carbon sources. Insignificant growth on ribonucleosides, viz. inosine and uridine, should be attributed to the activity of hydrolases in the cell. In contrast, Pseudomonas trifolii is capable of normal growth on various nucleosides using them as a sole source of carbon. Accordingly, the cell extracts display the activities of enzymes involved in the catabolism of nucleosides, namely, the so-called deo enzymes. Methods developed for E. coli were used to obtain mutants in the genes dra, tpp and drm as well as in regulatory loci negatively controlling the activity of deo genes in Ps. trifolii. Like in E. coli, cytidine and thymidine induce the activity of deo genes in Ps. trifolii.
TI  - Chromosomal mobilization from a recA mutant of Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - A methyl methane sulfonate sensitive mutant of P. putida strain PpG1 is also extremely sensitive to UV-rays, compared to parent wild type cells. This mutant behaves typically as recombination less (recA) mutants of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, since as a recipient, it exhibits extremely low frequency of recombination following conjugational, transductional, and transformational gene transfer. Sex factor plasmids such as K-XYL or TOL can mobilize chromosomal genes equally well both from recA+ and recA801 donor cells, suggesting that host recombination functions are not necessary for mobilization of chromosomal genes by such plasmids.
TI  - Autoradiographic study of the localization and evolution of growth zones in bacterial colonies.
AB  - Incorporation of [3H]leucine in the bacteria of 18 to 48 h-old colonies of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas putida, Bacillus thuringiensis, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli enabled the localization of bacterial multiplication sites by means of autoradiography of sagittal sections. In colonies where fast diameter expansion occurred, all the bacteria from the peripheral corona contributed to peripheral growth; in colonies where the expansion was slower, the growth rate of the bacteria in this region was heterogeneous. Besides this peripheral growth, a central region of bacterial multiplication was always found, but with variable localization and extension. In aerobic species, such as P. aeruginosa and P. putida, the central growth site was limited to the zone of oxygen penetration into the bacterial mass. However, in facultatively anaerobic species, bacterial multiplication dependend on nutrient supply. For 48 h-old colonies of S. aureus, a more complex localization of growth seemed to be affected simultaneously by nutrient penetration and accumulation of toxic substances.
TI  - Expression of Escherichia coli tryptophan operon in Rhizobium leguminosarum.
AB  - RP4-trp hybrid plasmid containing Escherichia coli whole tryptophan operon was conjugatively transferred from E. coli to Rhizobium leguminosarum strains carrying mutations in different trp genes, converting their Trp- phenotype to Trp+. That the phenotype change of the R. leguminosarum cells was due to the presence of the E. coli tryptophan operon was verified by the isolation of RP4-trp hybrid plasmid from the R. leguminosarum conjugant cells, and by re-transfer of RP4-trp plasmid by conjugation back to E. coli trp and Pseudomonas putida trp strains. Enzymatic activities of anthranilate synthetase and beta subunit of tryptophan synthetase in crude extracts of R. leguminosarum cells containing RP4-trp plasmid were much higher than that of the wild-type cells and were not repressed by the presence of tryptophan in the culture medium.
TI  - [Expression of deo-operon Escherichia coli K-12 genes in the makeup of hybrid plasmid RP4::MU-DEO in Pseudomonas trifolii and Pseudomonas putida].
AB  
TI  - Amino acid sequence of a peptide containing an essential cysteine residue of Escherichia coli GMP synthetase.
AB  - The amino acid sequence of a 51-residue tryptic peptide of citraconylated [1-14C]carboxamidomethyl-labeled Escherichia coli GMP synthetase was determined by sequenator analyses of the intact peptide and fragments obtained by cleavage of the peptide with cyanogen bromide, trypsin, and Staphylcoccus aureus strain V8 protease. The cysteine residue of this peptide fragment is essential for glutamine-dependent GMP synthesis activity and is implicated in formation of a hypothetical covalent glutamyl-enzyme intermediate. There is essentially cysteine-containing regions of two other glutamine amidotransferases, Pseudomonas putida anthranilate synthetase Component II and chicken liver formylglycinamide ribonucleotide amidotransferase. There is, however, a cluster of amino acids with "antipathy" for helix formation and a "nonessential" cysteine of anthranilate synthetase Component II.
TI  - Anabolic ornithine carbamoyltransferase of Escherichia coli and catabolic ornithine carbamoyltransferase of Pseudomonas putida. Steady-state kinetic analysis.
AB  - The anabolic and catabolic ornithine carbamoyltransferases of Pseudomonas putida  display an undirectional catalytic specialization: in citrulline synthesis for the anabolic enzyme, in citrulline phosphorolysis for the catabolic one. The irreversibility of the anabolic enzyme in vitro has been previously explained by its kinetic properties, whereas the irreversibility of the catabolic transferase in vivo was shown to be due to its allosteric behaviour. In this work a steady-state kinetic analysis has been carried out on the catabolic ornithine carbamoyltransferase at pH 6.8 in the presence of the allosteric activator, phosphate. The kinetic mechanism of Escherichia coli ornithine carbamoyltransferase serving as a reference was also determined. For the E. coli enzyme in the reverse direction, the initial velocity patterns converging on the abscissa were obtained with either citrulline or arsenate as variable substrate. The inhibition by the product ornithine was linear competitive with respect to citrulline and linear non-competitive with respect to arsenate. In the forward direction phosphate and its analogs induce an inhibition by ornithine which is partial and competitive with respect to carbamoylphosphate. Together with the results of thermo-inactivation studies in the presence of each reactant, this observation suggests a random kinetic mechanism, but with most of the reaction flux following the path where carbamoylphosphate adds before ornithine, when substrates are present at Km levels. The allosteric catabolic ornithine carbamoyltransferase of Pseudomonas displays qualitatively the same pattern as the E. coli enzyme.
TI  - Anthranilate synthetase component II from Pseudomonas putida. Covalent structure  and identification of the cysteine residue involved in catalysis.
AB  - The complete amino acid sequence of carboxamidomethylated anthranilate synthetase component II (AS II) from Pseudomonas putida has been determined by analysis of cyanogen bromide fragments, tryptic peptides from the citraconylated protein, and by analysis of subdigests of these peptides. AS II is a single polypeptide chain of 197 residues having a calculated molecular weight of 21,684. Previous studies (Goto, Y., Keim, P. S., Zalkin, H., and Heinrikson, R. L. (1976) J. Biol. Chem, 251, 941-949) identified a cysteine residue required for the formation of an acyl-enzyme intermediate. The protein has 3 cysteine residues at positions 54, 79, and 140. Cysteine-79 was alkylated selectively by iodoacetamide and by the glutamine affinity analogue L-2-amino-4-oxo-5-chloropentanoic acid. Based on this evidence cysteine-79 is the active site residue involved in formation of the acyl-enzyme intermediate. Comparison of the P. putida AS II sequence with that of the NH2-terminal 60 residues of the enzyme from Escherichia coli shows 38% sequence identity.
TI  - TOL is a broad-host-range plasmid.
AB  - We readily isolated insertions of the carbenicillin resistance element Tn401 into the TOL plasmid in Pseudomonas putida. Hybrid TOL::Tn401 plasmids stably express the Cbr phenotype in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli. Whereas the replicative and conjugative functions are expressed in both hosts, the ability to grow on m-toluate is only expressed in the Pseudomonas species.
TI  - Isolation of large bacterial plasmids and characterization of the P2 incompatibility group plasmids pMG1 and pMG5.
AB  - Large plasmids from Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas putida, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were routinely and consistently isolated using a procedure which does not require ultracentrifugation but includes steps designed to separate large-plasmid DNA from the bacterial folded chromosome. It also selectively removes fragments of broken chromosome. A variety of large plasmids was readily visualized with agarose gel electorphoresis, including five between 70 and 85 megadaltons (Mdal) in size, six between 90 and 143 Mdal, one that was larger than 200 Mdal, and one that was larger than 300 Mdal. This isolation procedure allowed initial estimation of the molecular sizes of the two IncP2 plasmids, pMG1 and pMG5, which were 312 and 280 Mdal, respectively. A standard curve for size determination by gel electrophoresis including plasmids between 23 and 143 Mdal in size did not extrapolate linearly for plasmids of the 300-Mdal size range. Unique response of different plasmids to the isolation procedure included sensitivity of IncP1 plasmids to high pH and the co-isolation of a 20-Mdal "cryptic" plasmid in conjunction.
TI  - Isolation of TOL and RP4 recombinants by integrative suppression.
AB  - We obtained genetic and molecular evidence of non-thermosensitive recombinants of RP4 (Kmr Tcr Cbr/Apr) and the thermosensitive TOL plasmid. As first isolated in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO, the recombinant plasmid pTN1 specified noninducible synthesis of TOL enzymes and was transmissible to Escherichia coli on selection for the transfer of kanamycin resistance. The phenotypic expression of TOL genes of pTN1 in E. coli was low and also noninducible. A spontaneous segregant, pTN2, appearing from pTN1, conferred inducible synthesis of TOL enzymes. These plasmids carry all of the TOL determinants as evidenced by the ability of Pseudomonas putida carrying recombinant plasmids to grow on toluene, xylene, and m-toluate. In E. coli the expression of TOL genes with normal regulation (pTN2) appears to be extremely low without induction, and the induced expression is comparable to that with defective regulation (pTN1). The measurement of the molecular weight of pTN2 by electron microscopy gave a value of about 74 X 10(6).
TI  - Host factor for coliphage Q beta RNA replication: presence in procaryotes and association with the 30S ribosomal subunit in Escherichia coli.
AB  - The Host Factor required for in vitro coliphage Q beta RNA replication, a heat-stable RNA binding protein present in uninfected Escherichia coli, has been detected by both immunological and functional tests in Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas putida. It was not detectable by these criteria in Bacillus stearothermophilus, Bacillus subtilis, Caulobacter crescentus, Micrococcus lysodeikticus, Rhodopseudomonas capsulata or Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In Escherichia coli the Host Factor protein has been shown to be associated with ribosomes. It is demonstrated here that this association is specific for the 30S ribosomal subunit.
TI  - Transposition of a beta-lactamase locus from RP1 into Pseudomonas putida degradative plasmids.
AB  - The beta-lactamase gene from the RP1 plasmid transposes into at least two Pseudomonas putida degradative plasmids. Donor strains that carry RP1 (bla+ tet+ aphA+) and a degradative plasmid yield transconjugants that have only the bla+ marker of RP1. This occurs in up to 80% of all bla+ transconjugants. Segregation of the bla+ marker requires the presence of a degradative plasmid in the donor and is only observed in transconjugants that have received degradative markers. The bla+ tet aphA transconjugants show 100% linkage of bla+ to degradative markers in conjugation,transduction, and transformation crosses. A transduction cross of an (RP1), (SAL) donor shows that 8% of all SAL plasmids also carry the transposed bla+ marker. Tn401 is the name we assign to the bla+ transposon from RP1 observed in Pseudomonas. Its identity with the RP1 bla+ transposon observed in Escherichia coli is not known. In four cases, Tn401 has inserted into the camphor genes of the CAM-OCT plasmid.
TI  - Properties of anthranilate synthetase component II from Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - The interaction of Pseudomanas putida anthranilate synthetase Component II (AS II) with glutamine, glutamine analogs, and iodoacetamide has been investigated in order to clarify the initial steps in the mechanism for glutamine utilization. AS II is alkylated and irreversibly inactivated by covalent attachment of approximately 1 eg of L-2-amino-4-oxo-5-chloropentanoic acid (chloroketone) or 1 eq of iodoacetamide. Alkylation of AS II by chloroketone involves initial formation of an enzyme-inhibitor complex having a Ki of 28 muM. Alkylation of AS II by iodoacetamide occurs without initial formation of a reversible complex. In both cases glutamine protects against alkylation and exhibits competitive kinetics. When anthranilate synthetase Component I (AS I) is associated with AS II, the second substrate, chorismate, enhances alkylation of AS II by chloroketone. Alkylation of AS II by iodoacetamide is unaffected by AS I and chorismate. These results suggest a role of chorismate-AS I complex to promote binding of glutamine to AS II or to facilitate conversion of an AS II-glutamine complex to the covalent glutamyl-AS II intermediate. This conclusion is supported by the fact that glutaminase activity of AS II, which requires formation of the glutamyl-AS II intermediate, is stimulated by AS I and chorismate.
TI  - Host factor for coliphage Qbeta RNA replication is present in Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - Host Factor (HF)1, is a 12000 molecular weight polypeptide that is found in uninfected Escherichia coli and is required as a hexamer along with Qbeta replicase for in vitro replication of Qbeta phage RNA. It has recently been found to be associated with ribosomes and to bind tightly to poly(A). We report here the identification and purification of HF from Pseudomonas putida. HF can be detected in crude extracts by both functional activity in the Qbeta RNA replication assay and by immunodiffusion with antibody made against E. coli HF. HF from E. coli and P. putida chromatograph similarly on DEAE-cellulose and phosphocellulose. They have similar but not identical molecular weights as judged by SES-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Like E. coli HF, P. putida HF was found to be associated with ribosomes and to bind tightly to poly(A). Furthermore, the pure protein from P. putida has full funcitonal activity in the in vitro Qbeta RNA replication assay. The findings that HF has been conserved during evolution, is associated with ribosomes, and binds poly(A), suggest that HF may be an important translational element in uninfected cells and that its role involves an interaction with RNA.
TI  - Transformation of Pseudomonas putida and Escherichia coli with plasmid-linked drug-resistance factor DNA.
AB  - Conditions optimal for the transformation of Pseudomonas putida and E. coli with  a drug-resistance factor (RP 1) DNA, which specifies resistance to carbenicillin, tetracycline, kanamycin, and neomycin, are described. The transformants retain all the fertility, incompatibility, and drug-resistance characteristics present in the parent. Covalently-closed circular molecules of almost identical contour lengths have been isolated from the parent and the transformants. The frequency of transformation is drastically reduced by treatment of RP 1 DNA with DNase and by denaturation or sonication. Shearing of RP 1 DNA in vitro and their subsequent introduction in P. putida cells, by transformation, produces transformants that exhibit a wide range of drug-resistant phenotypes, including those which are resistant to neomycin but sensitive to kanamycin. Isolation of such neomycin-resistant but kanamycin-sensitive transformants indicates that there might be two separate mechanisms specified by RP 1 for resistance to the two antibiotics.
TI  - Immunological study of anthranilate synthetase.
AB  - An immunological study of anthranilate synthetase (ASase) has been initiated using quantitative precipitation, enzyme neutralization, and immunodiffusion methods. Cross-reactivity of anthranilate synthetase-anthranilate-5-phosphoribosylpyrophosphate phosphoribosyltransferase (ASase-PRTase) from Escherichia coli, Klebsiella aerogenes, and Salmonella typhimurium and ASase from Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas putida was detected with antibodies to ?E. coli trypsin-treated ASase. Cross-reactivity of antigens was also obtained with S. marcescens anti-ASase. Indices of dissimilarity verified the overall structural similarity of ASase-PRTase from E. coli, K. aerogenes, and S. typhimurium and the divergence from S. marcescens ASase. Further divergence of these enzymes from ASase in B. subtilis and P. putida was apparent. Precipitation of ASase components I and II (ASase CoI and ASase CoII) was obtained using anti-ASase or antiserum fractionated to contain component-specific antibodies. Anti-ASase inhibited enzyme activity to binding to determinants on both subunits. Anti-ASase CoI inhibited the ammonia-dependent reaction and interfered with amide transfer from glutaminyl-ASase CoII. Anti-ASase CoII inhibited the glutamine reaction by blocking amide transfer. Enzyme neutralization experiments indicate more conservation of determinants at the active site region of ASase CoII compared to ASase CoI in the enterobacteria. A particulate form of ASase-PRTase in E. coli, K. aerogenes, and S. typhimurium could be distinguished by quantitative precipitation and immunodiffusion.
TI  - Amino-terminal sequence of the tryptophan synthetase alpha chain of Bacillus subtilis.
AB  - The sequence of the 46 NH(2)-terminal residues of the tryptophan synthetase alpha chain of Bacillus subtilis was determined and compared with the corresponding sequences of Escherichia coli, Shigella dysenteriae, Salmonella typhimurium, Aerobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, and Pseudomonas putida. A deletion of six residues was found at the NH(2)-terminal end of the alpha chain of B. subtilis.
TI  - New gas chromatographic characterization procedure: preliminary studies on some Pseudomonas species.
AB  - Strains of saccharolytic and nonsaccharolytic Pseudomonas species were examined by a new single-step gas chromatographic characterization procedure. Cells were digested in a methanolic solution of tetramethylammonium hydroxide pentahydrate, and the digestates were subjected to gas-liquid chromatographic analysis. The chromatograms were examined for similarities and differences in their overall patterns. A single component was defined for use as an internal qualitative and quantitative standardizing component in order to develop relative retention time-relative peak height profiles of each organism. Comparison of these profiles enabled the characterization of strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. putida, P. cepacia, P. pseudomallei, P. stutzeri, P. pseudoalcaligenes, P. alcaligenes, P. diminuta, P. denitrificans, and P. acidovorans. The P. maltophilia and P. putrefaciens digestates showed chromatograms which were superficially similar yet easily distinguished as belonging to different species. The chromatograms of these two organisms were very different from those of other pseudomonads.
TI  - Kinetics of deoxyribonucleic acid destruction and synthesis during growth of Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus strain 109D on pseudomonas putida and escherichia coli.
AB  - During the growth of Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus on Pseudomonas putida or Escherichia coli in either 10(-3)m tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane or in dilute nutrient broth, the host deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was rapidly degraded, and by 30 to 60 min after the initiation of the bdellovibrio development cycle essentially all host DNA became nonbandable in CsCl gradients. At this stage the host DNA degradation products were nondiffusable, and there was no appreciable pool of low-molecular-weight (cold acid soluble) DNA fragments in the cells or in the suspending medium. Bdellovibrio DNA synthesis occurred only after degradation of host DNA to a nonbandable form was complete. The synthesis occurred in a continuous fashion with P. putida as the host and in two separate periods with E. coli as host. By using E. coli containing a (3)H-thymidine label, it was shown that 73%, on the average, of the thymine residues of host DNA were incorporated into bdellovibrio DNA when E. coli was the only source of nutrient. In the presence of dilute nutrient broth, the host cells still served as the major source of precursors for bdellovibrio DNA synthesis, with only 20% of the precursors arising from the exogenous nutrients. The data indicate an efficient and controlled utilization of host DNA by the bdellovibrio. The host DNA is apparently degraded early in the developmental cycle to oligonucleotides of intermediate molecular weight from which the biosynthetic monomers are generated only as they become needed for bdellovibrio DNA synthesis.
TI  - Pseudomonas putida tryptophan synthetase.
AB  - The two protein components of Pseudomonas putida tryptophan synthetase have been  purified to homogeneity. Although there is general similarity between the Pseudomonas enzyme and that of the enteric bacteria, many differences were found. Components from Escherichia coli and P. putida do not stimulate each other enzymatically, and the enzymes differ in their response to monovalent cations. Serine deamination occurs best with the intact enzyme of P. putida, not with the beta(2) subunit alone as in E. coli. The amino acid compositions of the alpha subunits differ appreciably. These findings extend earlier studies showing differences between enteric organisms and pseudomonads in the regulation and genetic organization of the enzymes of the tryptophan pathway.
TI  - Pseudomonas putida tryptophan synthetase: partial sequence of the subunit.
AB  - There is 50% identity in the sequences of the first 50 residues of the alpha chains of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida. No deletions or additions of residues are found in this region, except for the N-terminal methionine residue which is missing in the polypeptide isolated from P. putida. Most of the residues which differ are chemically dissimilar, and half of them are specified by codons which differ by more than a single base. The two residues known by mutational analysis to be essential for catalysis in E. coli are conserved in P. putida. The potential taxonomic usefulness of information of this sort is analyzed.

AB  
TI  - Enzymes of the tryptophan synthetic pathway in Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - The first four enzymatic activities of the tryptophan synthetic pathway in Pseudomonas putida were found on separate molecules. Gel filtration and density gradient centrifugation experiments did not disclose any associations or aggregations among them. These findings contrast with the situation found in the enteric bacteria, where the first two activities are found in an aggregate and the third and fourth are catalyzed by a single enzyme. Tryptophan synthetase, the last enzyme of the pathway, consists of two dissociable components. The affinity of these components is less in P. putida than is the case in Escherichia coli.
