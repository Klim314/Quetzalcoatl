biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles from staphylococcus aureus and its antimicrobial activity against mrsa and mrse.
silver bionanoparticles (agnps) have been known to have inhibitory and bactericidal effects. resistance to antimicrobial agents by pathogenic bacteria has emerged in recent years and is a major health problem. this report focuses on the synthesis of metallic bionanoparticles of silver using a reduction of aqueous ag+ ion with the culture supernatants of staphylococcus aureus. the bioreduction of the ag+ ions in the solution was monitored in the aqueous component and the spectrum of the solution measured through ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometry and characterized by atomic force microscopy. the agnps were evaluated for their antimicrobial activities against different pathogenic organisms. the most sensitive antimicrobial activity has been observed against methicillin-resistant s. aureus followed by methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis and streptococcus pyogenes, whereas only moderate antimicrobial activity was seen against salmonella typhi and klebsiella pneumoniae. from the clinical editor: silver bionanoparticles (agnps) were evaluated for their antimicrobial activities against different pathogenic organisms. the most sensitive antimicrobial activity has been observed against methicillin-resistant s. aureus followed by methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis and streptococcus pyogenes, whereas only moderate antimicrobial activity was seen against salmonella typhi and klebsiella pneumoniae.
antimicrobial activity of ceftobiprole, a novel anti-methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus cephalosporin, tested against contemporary pathogens: results from the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program (2005-2006).
ceftobiprole is a 1st-in-class anti-methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) extended-spectrum cephalosporin currently in clinical trials for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections (csssis) and nosocomial pneumonia. this agent is also active against other prominent gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens, making it an attractive candidate for broad-spectrum therapy. we evaluated the in vitro potency of ceftobiprole tested against the most commonly occurring bacterial pathogens as part of a global surveillance study for the years 2005 to 2006 (>60 medical centers in north america, latin america, and europe). all isolates (40 675) were susceptibility tested using reference broth microdilution methods. ceftobiprole inhibited 100% and >99% of tested s. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci at < or =4 and < or =8 microg/ml, respectively, although mic90 values for oxacillin-resistant strains were 4-fold and 8-fold higher than oxacillin-susceptible isolates for the 2 groups. ceftobiprole was also broadly active against streptococcus pneumoniae, beta-hemolytic and viridans group streptococci, inhibiting >98% of isolates at < or =0.5 microg/ml. although ceftobiprole was generally inactive against enterococcus faecium, the majority of enterococcus faecalis strains (95.7%) were inhibited at < or =4 microg/ml. this agent was similar in potency to the "3rd- and 4th-generation" cephems (mic50 values, < or =0.06 microg/ml) for all tested enterobacteriaceae. although cefepime provided enhanced coverage against klebsiella spp. (86.5% at < or =8 microg/ml versus 76.9-81.7% for ceftobiprole and ceftazidime), ceftobiprole and cefepime were superior to ceftazidime against enterobacter spp. and citrobacter spp. against pseudomonas aeruginosa, ceftobiprole was equal in potency to ceftazidime (mic50, 2 microg/ml) and 2-fold more potent than cefepime. none of these agents inhibited >45% of acinetobacter spp. at 8 mug/ml. ceftobiprole is a new anti-mrsa beta-lactam with recognized activity against the most commonly occurring enterobacteriaceae and p. aeruginosa, similar to that of extended-spectrum cephems. these characteristics warrant continued evaluation of the agent as empiric therapy for csssis, and in pneumonia, especially in those institutions/regions where mrsa and p. aeruginosa may be prevalent.
[antibiotic microbial resistance surveillance in invasive infections caused by streptococcus pneumoniae and staphylococcus aureus: the earss (european antimicrobial resistance surveillance system) project in italy (april 1999-april 2000)].
this paper presents the results of an italian multicentric study conducted in the period april 1999-april 2000 in 64 clinical microbiology laboratories, aimed at collecting antimicrobial resistance data using a standard european protocol (earss project, european antimicrobial surveillance system). a total of 1701 strains of staphylococcus aureus were isolated from blood and 367 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae were isolated from blood (72.7%) or from csf (27.3%). methicillin resistance in s. aureus was found to be 42.1%; it was significantly higher in adults (rr = 6.6, ci 95% 2.5-17.0), in hospitals of centre and north of italy (respectively rr = 1.45, ci 95% 1.1-2.0; rr = 1.6, ci 95% 1.1-2.2), and in intensive care and surgery units (respectively rr = 1.8, ic 95% 1.6-2.0 and rr = 1.7, ci 95% 1.4-1.9). penicillin resistance in s. pneumoniae was found to be 12.1%; it was higher in south italy (rr = 3.5, ci 95% 1.9-6.6, in meningitis compared to sepsis (rr = 2.5, ci 95% 1.4-2.5) and in intensive care units compared to other departments (rr = 2.2, ci 95% 1.0-4.8). the level of erythromycin resistance in s. pneumoniae was of 28.2%, reaching 56.4% in penicillin resistant strains. these results suggest that a continued surveillance and effective control measures are required.
