TI  == [recurrent meningitis due to anatomical defects: the bacteria indicates its origin].
AB  == introduction: recurrent meningitis is a rare disease. anatomical abnormalities and immunodeficiency states are predisposing factors. four cases, in which immunodeficiency was excluded, are presented. the causal microorganism led to the detection of the anatomical defect responsible for the recurrences. patients and  methods: retrospective review of 4 cases with clinical diagnosis of recurrent bacterial meningitis. results: case 1: a thirty month-old boy with unilateral hearing loss, diagnosed with mondini abnormality by magnetic resonance imaging (mri) after 2 episodes of haemophilus influenzae meningitis. surgical repair after third recurrence. case 2: fourteen year-old girl diagnosed by mri with cribriform plate defect after 3 episodes of meningitis due to streptococcus pneumoniae. ventriculoperitoneal shunt was placed. case 3: girl with meningitis due to staphylococcus aureus at 2 and 7 months. mri shows occipital dermal sinus  requiring excision. complication with cerebellar abscesses because of a coexisting dermoid cyst. case 4: child with meningitis due to streptococcus bovis at 9 days and enterococcus faecium, klebsiella pneumoniae and escherichia coli at 7 months, with positive cultures to citrobacter freundii and e. faecium later on. spinal mri led to the diagnosis of currarino syndrome with csf fistula, which was surgically repaired. the 4 patients had undergone image studies reported as normal during the first episodes. conclusions: in patients with recurrent meningitis the possibility of an anatomical defect should be considered. the isolated microorganism should help to locate it. it is essential to know the normal flora of the different anatomical sites. the definitive treatment is usually surgical.

TI  == ceftobiprole activity against over 60,000 clinical bacterial pathogens isolated in europe, turkey, and israel from 2005 to 2010.
AB  == ceftobiprole medocaril is a newly approved drug in europe for the treatment of hospital-acquired pneumonia (hap) (excluding patients with ventilator-associated  pneumonia but including ventilated hap patients) and community-acquired pneumonia in adults. the aim of this study was to evaluate the in vitro antimicrobial activity of ceftobiprole against prevalent gram-positive and -negative pathogens  isolated in europe, turkey, and israel during 2005 through 2010. a total of 60,084 consecutive, nonduplicate isolates from a wide variety of infections were  collected from 33 medical centers. species identification was confirmed, and all  isolates were susceptibility tested using reference broth microdilution methods.  ceftobiprole had high activity against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa) (100.0% susceptible), methicillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons), beta-hemolytic streptococci, and streptococcus pneumoniae (99.3% susceptible), with mic90 values of 0.25, 0.12, </= 0.06, and 0.5 mug/ml, respectively. ceftobiprole was active against methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) (98.3% susceptible) and methicillin-resistant cons, having a mic90 of 2 mug/ml. ceftobiprole was active against enterococcus faecalis (mic50/90, 0.5/4 mug/ml) but not against most enterococcus faecium isolates. ceftobiprole was very potent against the majority of enterobacteriaceae (87.3% susceptible), with >80%  inhibited at </= 0.12 mug/ml. the potency of ceftobiprole against pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic50/90, 2/>8 mug/ml; 64.6% at mic values of </= 4 mug/ml) was similar to that of ceftazidime (mic50/90, 2/>16 mug/ml; 75.4% susceptible), but limited activity was observed against acinetobacter spp. and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. high activity was also observed against all haemophilus influenzae (mic90, </= 0.06 mug/ml) and moraxella catarrhalis (mic50/90, </= 0.06/0.25 mug/ml) isolates. ceftobiprole demonstrated a wide spectrum of antimicrobial activity against this very large longitudinal sample of contemporary pathogens.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of the pleuromutilin antibiotic bc-3781 against bacterial  pathogens isolated in the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program in 2010.
AB  == bc-3781 is a novel semisynthetic pleuromutilin antibiotic inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis. bc-3781 has completed a phase 2 clinical trial in acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (absssi). its antibacterial spectrum additionally covers the predominant pathogens causing community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (cabp). in this study, the antibacterial activity of bc-3781  was evaluated against a contemporary collection of 10,035 bacterial isolates predominately causing absssi and cabp, among other infections, collected within the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program worldwide in 2010. bc-3781 exhibited potent activity against organisms commonly isolated from absssi such as staphylococcus aureus (mic50/90, 0.12/0.12 mug/ml; 99.8% inhibited at </=0.5 mug/ml), beta-hemolytic streptococci (mic50/90, 0.03/0.03 mug/ml; 99.3% inhibited at </=0.5 mug/ml), and coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons; mic50/90, 0.06/0.12 mug/ml; 97.8% inhibited at </=1 mug/ml). bc-3781 displayed similar mic  distributions among methicillin-susceptible (mssa) and methicillin-resistant (mrsa) s. aureus strains. bc-3781 was also active against enterococcus faecium, with 76.3% of vancomycin-susceptible and 97.0% of vancomycin-resistant isolates being inhibited at bc-3781 concentrations of </=1 mug/ml. beta-hemolytic and viridans group streptococci were highly susceptible to bc-3781, with 99.3% and 96.7% of isolates inhibited at </=0.5 mug/ml, respectively. further, activity of  bc-3781 against streptococcus pneumoniae (mic50/90, 0.12/0.25 mug/ml), haemophilus influenzae (mic50/90, 1/2 mug/ml), and moraxella catarrhalis (mic50/90, 0.12/0.25 mug/ml) was not negatively influenced by beta-lactamase production or resistance to other antimicrobial classes tested. in all, bc-3781 displayed a very potent antibacterial profile including the most prevalent bacterial pathogens causing absssi and cabp, thus warranting further clinical development of this antibiotic in these and possibly other indications.

TI  == [in vitro susceptibilities to levofloxacin and various antibacterial agents of 12,866 clinical isolates obtained from 72 centers in 2010].
AB  == postmarketing surveillance of levofloxacin (lvfx) has been conducted continuously since 1992. the present survey was performed to investigate in vitro susceptibility of recent clinical isolates in japan to 30 selected antibacterial  agents, focusing on fluoroquinolones (fqs). the common respiratory pathogens streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, moraxella catarrhalis, and haemophilus influenzae continue to show a high susceptibility to fqs. in contrast, widely-prevailing resistance to macrolides was markedly noted among s pneumoniae and s. pyogenes. regarding h. influenzae, the prevalence of beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant isolates has been increasing year by year (25.8% in 2002, 40.0% in 2004, 50.1% in 2007, and 57.9% in 2010). enterobacteriaceae showed high susceptibility to fqs, however, prevalence of lvfx-resistant escherichia coli, including intermediate resistance, was 29.3%, showing an increase over time. nevertheless, the increase in the prevalence of lvfx-resistant e. coli isolates has slowed since 2007 (8.2% in 2000, 11.8% in 2002, 18.8% in 2004, 26.2% in 2007, and 29.3% in 2010), suggesting the influence  of lvfx 500 mg tablets since its approval in 2009. another enterobacteriaceae member, klebsiella pneumoniae, showed low resistance to fqs, in contrast with e.  coli. in methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), the percentage of fq-susceptible isolates was low, at 51.6% for susceptibility to sitafloxacin, and at only around 10% for susceptibility to other fqs. however, methicillin-susceptible s. aureus (mssa) isolates were highly susceptible to fqs, with the percentage ranging from 88.5% to 99.1%. the prevalence of fqs-resistant  isolates in methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci was higher than that in methicillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci, although it was lower than the prevalence of fq-resistance in mrsa. the prevalence of fqs-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates derived from urinary tract infections (utis) was 15.4-21.3%, higher than the prevalence of 6.1-12.3% in p. aeruginosa isolates from respiratory tract infections (rtis). while this trend was consistent with the results of previous surveillance, gradual decreases were  noted in the prevalence of fq-resistant p. aeruginosa isolates derived from utis. the prevalence of multidrug-resistant p. aeruginosa was 2.3% among isolates derived from utis and 0.3% among isolates from rtis, a decrease from the results  of 2007. acinetobacter spp. showed high susceptibility to fqs. imipenem-resistant acinetobacter baumannii, which is currently an emerging issue, was detected at a  prevalence of 2.4% (13 isolates). neisseria gonorrhoeae showed a high resistance  of 81.3-82.5%, to fqs. ceftriaxone (ctrx) continued to show 100% susceptibility until 2007, but the present survey revealed the advent of resistance to ctrx in some clinical isolates. the result of the present survey indicated that although  methicillin-resistant staphylococci, enterococcus faecium, p. aeruginosa from utis, n. gonorrhoeae, and e. coli showed resistance of about 20% or more (19.5-89.2%) against the fqs which have been used clinically for over 17 years, the trends observed were similar to the results of previous surveillance. while fq resistance has been prevailing in e. coli, e. coli still shows more than 70% susceptibility to fqs. the other bacterial species maintained high susceptibility rates of greater than 80%, against fqs.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of ceftobiprole against clinical isolates from french teaching hospitals: proposition of zone diameter breakpoints.
AB  == the aims of this study were to determine the in vitro activity profile of ceftobiprole, a pyrrolidinone cephalosporin, against a large number of bacterial  pathogens and to propose zone diameter breakpoints for clinical categorisation according to the european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing (eucast) minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) breakpoints. mics of ceftobiprole were determined by broth microdilution against 1548 clinical isolates collected in eight french hospitals. disk diffusion testing was performed using 30 mug disks according to the method of the comite de l'antibiogramme de la societe francaise de microbiologie (ca-sfm). the in vitro activity of ceftobiprole, expressed by mic(50/90) (mics for 50% and 90% of the organisms, respectively) (mg/l), was as follows: meticillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, 0.25/0.5; meticillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), 1/2; meticillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons), 0.12/0.5; meticillin-resistant cons, 1/2; penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae, </= 0.008/0.03; penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae, 0.12/0.5; viridans group streptococci, 0.03/0.12; beta-haemolytic streptococci, </= 0.008/0.016; enterococcus faecalis,  0.25/1; enterococcus faecium, 64/128; enterobacteriaceae, 0.06/32; pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4/16; acinetobacter baumannii, 0.5/64; haemophilus influenzae, 0.03/0.12; and moraxella catarrhalis, 0.25/0.5. according to the regression curve, zone diameter breakpoints could be 28, 26, 24 and 22 mm for mics of 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 mg/l respectively. in conclusion, this study confirms the potent in vitro activity of ceftobiprole against many gram-positive bacteria, including mrsa but not e. faecium, whilst maintaining a gram-negative spectrum similar to the advanced-generation cephalosporins such as cefepime. thus ceftobiprole appears to be well suited for the empirical treatment of a variety of healthcare-associated infections.

TI  == nxl-103, a combination of flopristin and linopristin, for the potential treatment of bacterial infections including community-acquired pneumonia and mrsa.
AB  == novexel is developing the novel, orally active, semisynthetic streptogramin nxl-103, which has potential therapeutic application in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia, community- or hospital-acquired mrsa, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus, and acute bacterial skin and soft tissue infections. nxl-103 is a combination of streptogramin a:streptogramin b components, initially developed in a 70:30 dose ratio. in multiple in vitro studies, nxl-103 demonstrated potent activity against different types of bacteria, such as staphylococcus aureus (including mrsa), streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis,  haemophilus influenzae and haemophilus parainfluenzae. nxl-103 was not affected by the resistance profiles of bacteria against other commonly used antibiotics. in phase i clinical trials, nxl-103 achieved bactericidal levels in plasma and was generally well tolerated, with side effects primarily on the gastrointestinal system. the first phase ii trial conducted to evaluate the efficacy of nxl-103 against community-acquired pneumonia revealed that the compound was comparable with amoxicillin. nxl-103 has promise to become an important agent in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia and complex skin and soft tissue infections, pending further development.

TI  == in vitro activity of tigecycline and comparator agents against a global collection of gram-negative and gram-positive organisms: tigecycline evaluation and surveillance trial 2004 to 2007.
AB  == the tigecycline evaluation and surveillance trial began in 2004 to monitor the in vitro activity of tigecycline and comparator agents against a global collection of gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens. against gram negatives (n = 63 699), tigecycline mic(90)'s ranged from 0.25 to 2 mg/l for escherichia coli, haemophilus influenzae, acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, and serratia marcescens (but was > or =32 for pseudomonas aeruginosa). against gram-positive organisms (n = 32 218), tigecycline mic(90)'s were between 0.06 and 0.25 mg/l for streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecium, streptococcus agalactiae, staphylococcus aureus, and enterococcus faecalis. the in vitro activity of tigecycline was maintained against resistant phenotypes, including multidrug-resistant a. baumannii (9.2% of isolates), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing e. coli  (7.0%) and k. pneumoniae (14.0%), beta-lactamase-producing h. influenzae (22.2%), methicillin-resistant s. aureus (44.5%), vancomycin-resistant e. faecium (45.9%)  and e. faecalis (2.8%), and penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae (13.8%). tigecycline represents a welcome addition to the armamentarium against difficult  to treat organisms.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo properties of dihydrophthalazine antifolates, a novel family of antibacterial drugs.
AB  == racemic 2,4-diaminopyrimidine dihydrophthalazine derivatives bal0030543, bal0030544, and bal0030545 exhibited low in vitro mics toward small, selected panels of enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, streptococcus pneumoniae,  moraxella catarrhalis, and mycobacterium avium, though the compounds were less active against haemophilus influenzae. the constellation of dihydrofolate reductases (dhfrs) present in 20 enterococci and 40 staphylococci was analyzed and correlated with the antibacterial activities of the dihydrophthalazines and trimethoprim. dhfrs encoded by dfrb, dfra (s1 isozyme), dfre, and fola were susceptible to the dihydrophthalazines, whereas dhfrs encoded by dfrg (s3 isozyme) and dfrf were not. studies with the separated enantiomers of bal0030543, bal0030544, and bal0030545 revealed preferential inhibition of susceptible dhfrs  by the (r)-enantiomers. bal0030543, bal0030544, and bal0030545 were well tolerated by mice during 5- and 10-day oral toxicity studies at doses of up to 400 mg/kg of body weight. using a nonoptimized formulation, the dihydrophthalazines displayed acceptable oral bioavailabilities in mice, and efficacy studies with a septicemia model of mice infected with trimethoprim-resistant, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus gave 50% effective dose values in the range of 1.6 to 6.25 mg/kg.

TI  == in vitro activity of ceftaroline (ppi-0903m, t-91825) against bacteria with defined resistance mechanisms and phenotypes.
AB  == background: ceftaroline (ppi-0903m, t-91825) is a novel cephalosporin, administered as an n-phosphono prodrug. we investigated its in vitro activity and resistance selection potential. methods: mics were determined by clsi agar dilution, but with varied inocula. mutant selection was investigated in single- and multi-step procedures. results: mics for methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) were 0.5-2 mg/l, compared with 0.12-0.25 mg/l for methicillin-susceptible s. aureus; corresponding values for coagulase-negative staphylococci were 0.25-2 and 0.06-0.12 mg/l, respectively. even with 2% nacl added, all mrsa were susceptible at 2 mg/l. mics for enterococcus faecalis were from 0.25 to 8 mg/l; e. faecium was resistant. mics for escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., morganella morganii and proteeae without acquired resistance were 0.06-0.5 mg/l versus 0.12-1 mg/l for enterobacter, serratia and citrobacter  spp. and 2-8 mg/l for acinetobacter spp. mics rose to 1-2 mg/l for many enterobacteriaceae with classical tem beta-lactamases, and were much higher for those with extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls), hyperproduced ampc or k1 enzymes. mics for strains with classical tem/shv beta-lactamases rose if the inoculum was increased to 10(6) cfu/spot; this effect was even more marked for those with esbls. resistance due to class a beta-lactamases was reversed by clavulanate. geometric mean mics were 0.005, 0.05 and 0.09 mg/l for penicillin-susceptible, -intermediate and -resistant streptococcus pneumoniae strains, respectively-lower than for any comparator beta-lactam. haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis were very susceptible, although with marginally raised mics for beta-lactamase-positive moraxella strains and for haemophili with chromosomal ampicillin resistance. ceftaroline selected ampc-derepressed enterobacter mutants similarly to cefotaxime in single-step experiments; in multi-step procedures it selected esbl variants of blatem in e. coli. resistance selection was not seen with s. aureus, h. influenzae or pneumococci. conclusions: ceftaroline has impressive anti-mrsa and anti-pneumococcal activity. slight lability to classical tem and shv beta-lactamases is exceptional for an oxyimino-cephalosporin, but was reversible  with clavulanate, as was the greater resistance mediated by esbls. resistance selection occurred with enterobacteriaceae, not mrsa.

TI  == multiplexed identification of blood-borne bacterial pathogens by use of a novel 16s rrna gene pcr-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis assay.
AB  == we have developed a novel high-throughput pcr-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis (pcr-ldr-ce) assay for the multiplexed identification of 20 blood-borne pathogens (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, listeria monocytogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, neisseria meningitidis, bacteroides fragilis, bacillus anthracis, yersinia pestis, francisella tularensis, and brucella abortus), the last four of which are biothreat agents. the method relies on the amplification of two regions within the bacterial 16s rrna gene, using universal pcr primers and querying the identity of specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms within the amplified regions in a subsequent ldr. the ligation products vary in color and size and are separated by ce. each organism generates a specific pattern of ligation products, which can be used to  distinguish the pathogens using an automated software program we developed for that purpose. the assay has been verified on 315 clinical isolates and demonstrated a detection sensitivity of 98%. additionally, 484 seeded blood cultures were tested, with a detection sensitivity of 97.7%. the ability to identify geographically variant strains of the organisms was determined by testing 132 isolates obtained from across the united states. in summary, the pcr-ldr-ce assay can successfully identify, in a multiplexed fashion, a panel of  20 blood-borne pathogens with high sensitivity and specificity.

TI  == [antimicrobial resistance surveillance: vira study 2006].
AB  == introduction: the objective of this study was to determine the current antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of the most frequent multi-resistant bacteria and to analyze any possible changes with respect to the two vira studies carried out in 2001 and 2004. methods: in february 2006, the 40 participating hospitals sent the following microorganisms: non-penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae (92), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) (290), clinically significant coagulase-negative staphylococci (136), ampicillin-resistant enterococcus faecium (89), ampicillin-resistant haemophilus  influenzae (67), ciprofloxacin-resistant escherichia coli (365), pseudomonas aeruginosa (181), and acinetobacter baumannii (92). the hospitals provided epidemiological data on these microorganisms. susceptibility was determined with  a broth microdilution method. results: among the non-penicillin-susceptible s. pneumoniae isolates, the proportion of those ones resistant to this antibiotic showed a significant (p < 0.001) decrease (59.8% in 2001, 30.2% in 2004 and 14.3% in 2006). among mrsa, we detected one isolate nonsusceptible to linezolid, four resistant to quinupristin-dalfopristin and one strain with a vancomycin mic of 4  microg/ml. the prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing e. coli was 12.1%. resistance of a. baumannii to imipenem varied from 27% in the 2001-2004 period to 47.8% in 2006 (p < 0.005). conclusion: these results again emphasize that resistance surveillance systems are an important tool for preventing the emergence and spread of multi-resistant pathogens.

TI  == performance accuracy of antibacterial and antifungal susceptibility test methods: report from the college of american pathologists microbiology surveys program (2001-2003).
AB  == context: the college of american pathologists microbiology surveys program provides external proficiency samples that monitor the performance of nearly 3000 laboratories that perform and report antimicrobial susceptibility tests. objective: to summarize results obtained with bacterial and yeast challenge samples (2001 through 2003). design: one organism every 4 months was tested by surveys participants against antibacterials/antifungals by routinely used methods. reports were graded by interpretive category (susceptible, intermediate, resistant) based on an 80% consensus of referees/participants. results: the most  common antibacterial test methods/systems were vitek (38%-43%), microscan (39%-43%), and the disk diffusion test (14%-15%), although etest was most used for fastidious species. yeastone was the dominant antifungal test (50%-55%). antifungal results demonstrated continuous, improved accuracy (83%-88%), highest  for yeastone (96%) and broth microdilution (95%) methods. antibacterial test accuracy was consistently greater than 97% against gram-positive organism challenges and greater than 98% against gram-negative challenges. for gram-negative strains with well-characterized resistance mechanisms, the accuracy by method was disk diffusion greater than broth microdilution greater than automated systems. major problems identified were (1) haemophilus influenzae control ranges require re-evaluation, (2) overuse of beta-lactamase tests, (3) errors among enterococcus faecium against penicillins (vitek 2, microscan), (4) false-susceptible results with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole against coagulase-negative staphylococci (microscan), (5) macrolide false-susceptibility  for beta-hemolytic streptococcus (microscan), (6) flawed reporting for antimicrobials not active at the infection site, (7) use of outdated interpretive criteria, and (8) failure to follow clinical and laboratory standards institute testing/reporting recommendations. conclusions: susceptibility tests were generally performing satisfactorily as measured by the surveys, but serious errors were identified with some drug/organism combinations that may require action by the clinical and laboratory standards institute and/or the food and drug administration.

AB  == objectives: to evaluate the spectrum of activity and potency of lbm415, the first of the peptide deformylase inhibitor (pdfi) class to be developed for treatment of community-acquired respiratory tract infections and uncomplicated skin and soft tissue infections (ussti), against a large, contemporary international collection of targeted pathogens collected during 2003-2004. methods: a total of  21,636 isolates were tested by reference broth microdilution methods as part of a longitudinal international antimicrobial resistance surveillance study. characteristics of the organism collection included resistance to oxacillin among 35.0% of staphylococcus aureus and 76.0% of coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons); resistance to penicillin (mic > or = 2 mg/l) among 18.0% of streptococcus pneumoniae; vancomycin resistance among 20.0% of enterococcus spp. and ampicillin resistance among 22.0% of haemophilus influenzae. results: lbm415 displayed potent activity against staphylococci, streptococci, enterococcus faecium and moraxella catarrhalis, with > or = 99.0% of strains being inhibited at < or = 4 mg/l; 97.0% of enterococcus faecalis isolates and 92.0% of h. influenzae isolates were also inhibited at this concentration. seventy-seven percent of burkholderia  cepacia and 82.0% of stenotrophomonas maltophilia were inhibited at < or = 8 mg/l. no differences in lbm415 activity against s. aureus, cons, s. pneumoniae, enterococcus spp. and h. influenzae were detected for subsets susceptible or resistant to antimicrobials such as oxacillin, penicillin, ampicillin, macrolides, vancomycin and fluoroquinolones. while regional differences were apparent with some comparator agents, sensitivity to lbm415 did not vary significantly among strains from the various geographic areas sampled. one isolate of s. aureus displayed high-level resistance to lbm415 owing to multiple  sequence changes in resistance phenotype genes (defb and fmt), despite the absence of the compound in clinical practice. this isolate remained susceptible to all other antimicrobials tested except for penicillin. conclusions: with few differences detected among strains from various geographic regions, the first pdfi class agent to enter clinical development has consistently demonstrated a broad spectrum of activity against commonly isolated pathogens associated with uncomplicated respiratory and cutaneous infections. these compounds represent a significant therapeutic advance owing to their novel mechanism of action and antibacterial spectrum, including activity against resistant organisms, should pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters support their continued development. given the detection of a pre-existing pdfi-resistant isolate of s. aureus as demonstrated here, surveillance for resistance among the pdfi-targeted  pathogens following introduction of this class of agent into clinical usage will  be an important component of future studies.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of doripenem (s-4661): a global surveillance report (2003).
AB  == the spectrum of activity and potency of doripenem, a broad-spectrum parenteral carbapenem currently in clinical development, was evaluated using 16 008 clinical bacterial isolates collected as part of an international surveillance project during 2003. using reference broth microdilution methods, doripenem was found to  be highly active against oxacillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci (2705 and 297 isolates, respectively; mic90s 0.06 mg/l), with a potency greater than that of other carbapenem antibiotics. against enterococci (1474 isolates), with the exception of enterococcus faecium,  doripenem displayed modest activity (mic50 4). doripenem was among the most potent agents tested against streptococcus pneumoniae, viridans group streptococci and beta-haemolytic streptococci (885, 140 and 397 isolates; mic(90)s 0.5, 0.5 and 0.03 mg/l, respectively). for enterobacteriaceae (> 6200 isolates), doripenem was four- to 32-fold more active than imipenem against wild-type isolates (mic90s 0.03-0.5 mg/l). mic90s for confirmed extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae (121 and 155  isolates; 0.06 and 0.12 mg/l, respectively) were two-fold higher than for wild-type isolates. doripenem was also active against citrobacter spp., enterobacter spp. and serratia spp. (mic90s 0.06-0.25 mg/l), including ceftazidime-resistant isolates. doripenem and meropenem were the most active agents among all beta-lactams against pseudomonas aeruginosa (829 isolates; mic50/90s 0.5/8 and 0.5/16 mg/l, respectively), whereas doripenem and imipenem were the most active agents against acinetobacter spp. (155 isolates; mic50/90s 0.5/4 and <or= 0.5/2 mg/l, respectively). doripenem was slightly more potent (mic50 2 mg/l) than ertapenem and imipenem (mic50 4 mg/l), and had a potency similar to that of meropenem (mic50 2 mg/l), against burkholderia cepacia (20 isolates). both haemophilus influenzae (1824 isolates) and moraxella catarrhalis  (108 isolates), including beta-lactamase-positive isolates, were susceptible to doripenem (mic90s 0.25 and 0.03 mg/l, respectively). doripenem displays the favourable characteristics of other carbapenems, and appears to offer certain advantages in terms of potency, spectrum and beta-lactamase stability when compared with some carbapenems used currently to treat nosocomial infections.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of sm-216601, a new broad-spectrum  parenteral carbapenem.
AB  == sm-216601 is a novel parenteral 1beta-methylcarbapenem. in agar dilution susceptibility testing, the mic of sm-216601 for 90% of the methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) strains tested (mic(90)) was 2 microg/ml, which was  comparable to those of vancomycin and linezolid. sm-216601 was also very potent against enterococcus faecium, including vancomycin-resistant strains (mic(90) = 8 microg/ml). sm-216601 exhibited potent activity against penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, ampicillin-resistant haemophilus influenzae, moraxella  catarrhalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis, with mic(90)s of less than 0.5 microg/ml, and intermediate activity against citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, and pseudomonas  aeruginosa. the therapeutic efficacy of sm-216601 against experimentally induced  infections in mice caused by s. aureus, e. faecium, e. coli, and p. aeruginosa reflected its in vitro activity and plasma level. thus, sm-216601 is a promising  candidate for nosocomial bacterial infections caused by a wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including multiresistant pathogens.

TI  == in vitro activity of tigecycline against 6792 gram-negative and gram-positive clinical isolates from the global tigecycline evaluation and surveillance trial (test program, 2004).
AB  == tigecycline, a new glycylcycline antibiotic, has shown promising in vitro activity against many common pathogens, including multidrug-resistant strains. to determine the activity of tigecycline against a broad range of pathogens from diverse populations and geographic areas, the tigecycline evaluation and surveillance trial (test program) commenced in 2003. this study evaluated the activity of tigecycline and commonly used antimicrobials against 6792 clinical isolates from 40 study centers in 11 countries. tigecycline was the most active agent tested against gram-positive facultative species including multidrug-resistant strains. mic90 results (microg/ml) for tigecycline against enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, and streptococcus pneumoniae were 0.12, 0.12, 0.25, and 0.25 microg/ml, respectively. tigecycline was active against enterobacteriaceae with an mic90 of 1 microg/ml. haemophilus influenzae was very susceptible to tigecycline with an mic90 of only 0.25 microg/ml. pseudomonas aeruginosa was the  least susceptible organism tested against tigecycline. tigecycline appears to be  a promising new glycylcycline agent for the treatment of many types of pathogens  with varying resistance phenotypes.

TI  == in vitro activities of tigecycline against clinical isolates from shanghai, china.
AB  == to evaluate the in vitro activity of tigecycline, the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of tigecycline against 1,201 strains of recent clinical isolates from 10 hospitals in shanghai, china were determined and compared with selected comparators. results showed that tigecycline had broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. it was highly active against gram-positive cocci, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus spp., penicillin-intermediate streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium. tigecycline also  had good activity against most strains of enterobacteriaceae, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and moraxella catarrhalis. however, it was poorly active against acinetobacter baumannii and pseudomonas aeruginosa. tigecycline was highly active against anaerobic gram-positive cocci such as peptococcus spp. the in vitro activity of tigecycline was significantly better than that of minocycline and tetracycline. it was as active as or slightly more active than vancomycin and teicoplanin in the activity against resistant aerobic  gram-positive cocci. tigecycline was bactericidal against all gram-positive cocci tested except enterococcus spp. inoculum size but not ph of medium or concentration of human serum in broth had significant effect on the in vitro activity of tigecycline. aged media (48-72 hours after preparation) used in the test and specific resistance problem in china may have some effects on mic values of tigecycline.

TI  == [surveillance of antimicrobial resistance: vira study 2004].
AB  == introduction: the objective of the study was to know the current situation of the antimicrobial sensitivity patterns of the main multi-resistant bacteria and to analyze any possible changes with respect to the vira study carried out in 2001.  methods: the 40 participating hospitals sent a total of 1,425 microorganisms isolated in february 2004, distributed as follows: penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae (139), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (289), clinically significant coagulase-negative staphylococci (158), ampicillin-resistant enterococcus faecium (89) and enterococcus faecalis (2), ampicillin-resistant haemophilus influenzae (85), ciprofloxacin-resistant escherichia coli (346), pseudomonas aeruginosa (187), and acinetobacter baumannii (130). the hospitals provided epidemiological data on these microorganisms. sensitivity was determined by the broth microdilution method. results: the number of highly penicillin-resistant pneumococci fell significantly (p < 0.0001) compared with the previous study (from 59.8% to 30.2%). global methicillin-resistance in s. aureus was 31.2%, which represents a significant increase (p < 0.001) compared with the year 2001 (24.8%). 11.3% of the e. coli strains were extended-spectrum beta -lactamase-producers and came from 24 hospitals. one p. aeruginosa isolate gave a positive result in the e-test mbl assay, suggesting the presence of metallo-beta -lactamases. the strains of imipenem-resistant a. baumannii presented cross-resistance with several antibiotics. conclusion: these results show how the multi-resistant bacteria included in the study represent a growing problem in our hospitals. this emphasizes the importance of resistance surveillance systems and the correct use  of antimicrobial agents.

TI  == doripenem (s-4661), a novel carbapenem: comparative activity against contemporary pathogens including bactericidal action and preliminary in vitro methods evaluations.
AB  == objectives: to investigate the potency of doripenem, a broad-spectrum carbapenem  characterized by a wider spectrum of activity combining antimicrobial and bactericidal features of imipenem and meropenem. methods: this parenteral compound was studied against recent clinical isolates (2001-2002) from a worldwide organism collection. a total of 902 strains were susceptibility tested  by reference methods against doripenem and six to 28 comparators including ertapenem, imipenem and meropenem. the organisms tested included: enterobacteriaceae (281 strains), acinetobacter spp. (33), pseudomonas aeruginosa (35), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (36), other non-fermenters (22), haemophilus influenzae (61), moraxella catarrhalis (33), oxacillin-susceptible staphylococci  (39), enterococci (84), streptococci (163), various anaerobes (98), and other gram-positive species such as corynebacterium and bacillus spp. (17). results: against enterobacteriaceae, the average doripenem mic90 was 0.03 mg/l (range, < or =0.015-0.25 mg/l). doripenem was two- to 16-fold more potent than imipenem and comparable to ertapenem and meropenem; all doripenem mic values with enteric bacilli were < or =4 mg/l. doripenem was active against aeromonas (mic50, 0.03 mg/l), bacillus spp. (mic50, 0.03 mg/l) and all tested anaerobic species (mic range, < or =0.015-4 mg/l), but was less active against s. maltophilia (mic90, >32 mg/l) and enterococcus faecium (mic90, >32 mg/l) among the enterococcal species. time-dependent bactericidal action was observed for doripenem and broth  mic results were slightly greater when compared to agar mic results. in pilot testing, the optimal doripenem disc concentration was 10 microg, identical to standardized reagents for other clinically available carbapenems. conclusions: doripenem appears to be a potent carbapenem with a spectrum resembling currently  marketed antipseudomonal carbapenems, but with greater activity when tested against some non-fermentative bacillary strains. continued evaluation of doripenem against isolates resistant to other beta-lactams appears to be warranted.

TI  == algorithm for the identification of bacterial pathogens in positive blood cultures by real-time lightcycler polymerase chain reaction (pcr) with sequence-specific probes.
AB  == we developed real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assays for rapid detection of the most common and clinically relevant bacteria in positive blood culture bottles, including staphylococcus spp., s. epidermidis, s. aureus, enterococcus spp. (including differentiation of e. faecalis and e. faecium), streptococcus spp., streptococcus agalactiae, enterobacteriaceae, e. coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, acinetobacter spp., bacteroides spp., haemophilus influenzae, and neisseria meningitidis. a total of 507 positive blood cultures were investigated according to a specific pcr algorithm based on the microscopic result of the blood culture, and the pcr results were compared to the culture results. apart from-cross reactions between e. coli and chryseomonas luteola and enterococcus faecium and e. durans, the pcr assay correctly identified all bacteria in the blood cultures and did not show any false-positive results. regarding blood cultures positive with a single species of bacteria (n = 474), 98.3% of all bacteria were correctly detected by the pcr algorithm within a few hours. however, in mixed infections, the sensitivity was lower. the pcr algorithm is well suited for rapid identification of the most common bacteria in  positive blood cultures.

TI  == comparative study of the in vitro activity of a new fluoroquinolone, abt-492.
AB  == objectives: the in vitro activity of a new fluoroquinolone, abt-492, was determined. methods: mics were compared with those of two beta-lactams, telithromycin, ciprofloxacin and four later generation fluoroquinolones. the effects of human serum and of inoculum concentration were also investigated. results: mic data indicate that abt-492 has potent activity against gram-positive organisms with enhanced anti-staphylococcal activity compared with earlier fluoroquinolones, in addition to activity against beta-haemolytic streptococci, pneumococci including penicillin- and fluoroquinolone-resistant strains and vancomycin-susceptible and -resistant enterococcus faecalis but not enterococcus  faecium. abt-492 was the most active agent tested against haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, neisseria meningitidis, fluoroquinolone-susceptible neisseria gonorrhoeae and anaerobes. good activity was observed for abt-492 amongst the enterobacteriaceae and anaerobes tested, but ciprofloxacin showed superior activity for species of proteus, morganella and providencia, as well as  for pseudomonas spp. in common with the other fluoroquinolones tested, organisms  with reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin had raised mic(90)s to abt-492. the  one isolate of h. influenzae tested with reduced fluoroquinolone susceptibility had an abt-492 mic close to that of the population lacking a mechanism of quinolone resistance. abt-492 was more active than ciprofloxacin against chlamydia spp. an inoculum effect was observed with a number of isolates of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, e. faecium, klebsiella spp. and  escherichia coli, in addition to moderately raised mics in the presence of 70% serum protein. the clinical significance of these findings is yet to be determined. conclusions: abt-492 is a new fluoroquinolone with excellent activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms, with many potential clinical uses.

TI  == evaluation of a novel automated chemiluminescent assay system for antimicrobial susceptibility testing.
AB  == the newly developed rapid lumi eiken/is60 (rl/is60) system automatically determines mics by detecting chemiluminescence produced in the reaction of a chemiluminescent probe and oxygen metabolites from living microorganisms. the present study evaluated this system for accuracy in antimicrobial susceptibility  testing. chemiluminescence intensities after 4 h of cultivation of clinically important strains were plotted against various concentrations of antimicrobial agents, which resulted in curves reflecting the levels of susceptibility. sixty-percent inhibitory concentrations based on the susceptibility curves agreed with mics determined by the reference microdilution method. when the mics of antimicrobial agents for four quality control (qc) strains (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa) were determined by the rl/is60 system, most (91.1%) of them were within the qc limits  proposed by the national committee for clinical laboratory standards. the system  was further assessed for a total of 162 clinical isolates, including e. coli, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, p. aeruginosa, haemophilus influenzae, s. aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, and streptococcus pneumoniae. overall, there was 90.6% agreement between the rl/is60 system and the reference microdilution method. our  results suggest that the rl/is60 system provides rapid and reliable mics of a variety of antimicrobial agents for clinical isolates as well as qc strains.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of bal9141, a novel parenteral cephalosporin active against oxacillin-resistant staphylococci.
AB  == community-acquired and nosocomial infections caused by multidrug-resistant gram-positive pathogens continue to increase in prevalence and have become a serious problem in many parts of the world. bal9141 is a member of the class of parenteral pyrrolidinone-3-ylidenemethyl cephalosporins, and has a broad spectrum of activity. in the current study, bal9141 was tested against a large number (n = 2263) of recent isolates from various international surveillance programmes including 1097 gram-positive strains. susceptibility to (s) and activity of (mg/l) to bal9141, based on proposed breakpoints (mic50/mic90/% s) were as follows: methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (0.5/0.5/100%), methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) (1/2/100%), methicillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons) (0.12/0.25/100%), methicillin-resistant cons (mr-cons) (1/2/100%), streptococcus pneumoniae (< or = 0.015/0.25/100%), viridans group streptococci (0.03/0.5/99%), beta-haemolytic streptococci (< or =  0.015/< or = 0.015/100%), enterococcus faecalis (0.5/16/90%), enterococcus faecium (>32/>32/22%), haemophilus influenzae (0.06/0.06/100%), moraxella catarrhalis (0.06/0.5/100%), neisseria gonorrhoeae (0.03/0.06/100%) and neisseria meningitidis (< or = 0.002/0.004/100%). bal9141 susceptibility at < pr = 4 mg/l (100% s) surpassed that of ceftriaxone (cro; 1% s) and quinupristin/dalfopristin  (q-d; 92% s) against mrsa and mr-cons (cro 0.9% s; q-d 94% s). all s. pneumoniae  were inhibited by bal9141 at < or = 1 mg/l compared with cro (90% s) and levofloxacin (lvx; 98% s). susceptibility rates for viridans group streptococci to bal9141 (>98%) were also higher than to cro (86%) and lvx (96%). bal9141 demonstrated excellent activity against most species of wild-type enteric bacilli, with > or = 95% of isolates being susceptible; however, only modest activity was observed for bal9141 against non-fermentative gram-negative species  and esbl-producing escherichia coli or klebsiella pneumoniae. bal9141 demonstrated excellent activity against many tested pathogens displaying various  resistance phenotypes, and should be particularly valuable in the treatment of mrsa as well as for drug-resistant streptococci, while maintaining a spectrum resembling a 'third-generation' cephalosporin against other clinically important  species.

TI  == pharmacodynamic properties of hmr 3004, a novel ketolide, on respiratory pathogens, enterococci and bacteroides fragilis demonstrated by studies of time kill kinetics and postantibiotic effect.
AB  == objective: the pharmacodynamic properties of the novel ketolide (a new class of macrolide) antibiotic, hmr 3004, were investigated by studying time-kill kinetics and postantibiotic effect. methods: the time-kill kinetics were studied at two inocula against three strains each of staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium and bacteroides fragilis. the postantibiotic effects of hmr 3004 were also investigated on these organisms  at concentrations equivalent to 1, 4 and 10 x mic. results: the time kill-kinetic data demonstrated that hmr 3004 is inoculum dependent and predominantly bacteriostatic being only slowly bactericidal at higher concentrations. hmr 3004  exhibited a significant postantibiotic effect with all strains studied, ranging from 1.9--6.2 h at 10 x mic. conclusions: the bacteriostatic activity and significant postantibiotic effect demonstrated by hmr 3004 are similar to those previously obtained with other macrolides.

TI  == in vitro activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin against selected bacterial pathogens isolated in italy.
AB  == objective: to evaluate the activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin, a new injectable streptogramin, against 732 clinical strains recently isolated in italy. methods: susceptibility tests were performed according to nccls-guided mic methodology. pathogens included in the evaluation included 108 staphylococcus aureus isolates, 124 coagulase-negative staphylococcal isolates, 158 streptococcus pyogenes isolates, 30 streptococcus agalactiae isolates, 30 b-hemolytic streptococcal isolates, 18 streptococcus sanguis isolates, 80 streptococcus pneumoniae isolates, 69 enterococcal isolates, 40 haemophilus influenzae isolates, 30 moraxella catarrhalis isolates and, finally, 30 gram-positive and 25 gram-negative anaerobes. results: quinupristin/dalfopristin  inhibited staphylococcus aureus and other staphylococcus spp., irrespective of their oxacillin or erythromycin resistance phenotypes. similarly, streptococci were fully inhibited by quinupristin/dalfopristin. enterococcus faecalis was not  included in the spectrum of this streptogramin, while isolates of enterococcus faecium were inhibited by the new compound. respiratory pathogens such as h. influenzae and m. catarrhalis were inhibited by quinupristin/dalfopristin as well as all gram-negative anaerobes tested. conclusions: these findings suggest a putative role for quinupristin/dalfopristin in the empirical treatment of severe  nosocomial and community-acquired infections caused by pathogens often displaying resistance to multiple antibiotics. this drug may provide an alternative to glycopeptide compounds.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial spectrum of a new broad-spectrum 8-methoxy fluoroquinolone, gatifloxacin.
AB  == the in vitro antibacterial spectrum of gatifloxacin was compared with those of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. gatifloxacin was two- to four-fold more potent than  comparator quinolones against staphylococci, streptococci, pneumococci and enterococci (gatifloxacin mic90s, < or =1 mg/l, except 4 mg/l against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecium). gatifloxacin was two-fold less potent than ciprofloxacin, and the same as or two-fold more potent than ofloxacin against enterobacteriaceae (mic90s, 0.06-0.5  mg/l against most members of the enterobacteriaceae and < or =1 mg/l against proteus/morganella spp.). relative to the comparator quinolones, gatifloxacin was two- to four-fold more potent against providencia spp., and had good potency against acinetobacter spp. (mic90s, 0.25-1 mg/l). gatifloxacin and ofloxacin had  similar anti-pseudomonal potency, with corresponding mic90s of 4, 8 and 0.25 mg/l for pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas fluorescens and pseudomonas stutzeri, while ciprofloxacin had two- to eight-fold more potency. the three quinolones were equipotent against burkholderia cepacia (mic90s, 8 mg/l), but gatifloxacin was two-fold more potent against stenotrophomonas maltophilia (mic90, 4 mg/l). gatifloxacin was highly potent (mic90s, 0.03-0.06 mg/l) against haemophilus influenzae, legionella spp., helicobacter pylori and had at least eight-fold better anti-chlamydial and anti-mycoplasma potency (gatifloxacin mic90s, 0.13 mg/l). the higher quinolone mics for ureaplasma (mic90s, 4-8 mg/l) may be due to  the acidic ph of the ureaplasma test medium, which antagonizes quinolones. like other quinolones, gatifloxacin had poor potency against mycobacterium avium-intracellulare, though it was eight- to 16-fold more potent against mycobacterium tuberculosis (mic90, 0.25 mg/l). of the three quinolones, only gatifloxacin had activity against bacteroides fragilis and clostridium difficile. in summary, gatifloxacin is a broad-spectrum 8-methoxy fluoroquinolone that is more potent than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin against gram-positive bacteria, chlamydia, mycoplasma, mycobacteria and anaerobes.

AB  == the intragenomic heterogeneity of the bacterial intergenic (16s-23s rdna) spacer  region (isr) was analysed from the following species in which sequences for the complete rrna operon (rrn) set have been determined (rrn number): enterococcus faecalis (6) and e. faecium (6), bacillus subtilis (10), staphylococcus aureus (9), vibrio cholerae (4), haemophilus influenzae (6) and escherichia coli (7). it was found that some spacer sequence blocks were highly conserved between operons  of a genome, whereas the presence of others was variable. when these variations were analysed using the program plato and partial likelihood phylogenies determined by dnaml for each operon set, three regions showed significant (z>3.3) spatial variation [region i was 78-184 nt long (2.1<z<49.4), region ii was 10-60  nt long (3.7<z<23)] and region iii was 6 nt long (3.4<z>4.4) possibly due to recombination or selection. within region i, there was sequence block variation in all operon sets [some operons contained trna genes (trnaala, trnaile or trnaglu), whereas others had sequence blocks such as vs2 (s. aureus) or rsl (e. coli)]. q analysis of the isr sequence from e. faecalis and e. faecium showed that there was more interspecies than intraspecies variation (both in dna sequence and in the presence or absence of blocks). dot matrix analysis of the sequence blocks in the nine rrn isrs from s. aureus showed that there was significant homology between vs2 and vs5/vs6. furthermore, repeat motifs with only a or t were present in higher copy numbers in vs5/vs6 than in vs2. since these sequence blocks (vs2 and vs5-vs6) are related, intragenic evolution resulting in at expansion may have occurred between these two regions. a model is proposed that postulates a role for recombination and at-expansion in intra-genomic isr variations. this process may represent a general mechanism of concerted evolution for bacterial isr rearrangements.

AB  == quinupristin/dalfopristin and rpr 106972 were active in vitro against a wide range of aerobic gram-positive organisms including enterococcus faecium. however, most isolates of enterococcus faecalis were resistant or of intermediate sensitivity. against staphylococcus aureus quinupristin/dalfopristin was more active but for all other species the range of activity of the two drugs was the same or rpr 106972 was more active. rpr 106972 was also more active against the respiratory pathogens haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis. quinupristin/dalfopristin mics for isolates of h. influenzae (1-8 mg/l) clustered around the breakpoint. there were differences in the quality of growth, but little difference in mics or zone diameters was obtained on three different media: mueller-hinton (mha), iso-sensitest (isa), and diagnostic sensitivity test (dst) agars. the addition of blood to the medium increased mics 2- to 4-fold, with mha showing the greatest increase, and reduced zone diameters around quinupristin/dalfopristin discs by 3-4 mm, with the greatest effect on isa.

AB  == the pharmacodynamic properties of a novel ketolide (a new class of macrolide), hmr 3647, were investigated by studying time-kill kinetics and postantibiotic effect (pae). the time-kill kinetics were studied at two inocula against three strains each of staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium and bacteroides fragilis. the paes of hmr 3647 were also investigated on these organisms at concentrations equivalent to 1, 4 and 10 x mic. the time-kill kinetic data demonstrated that hmr 3647 is predominantly bacteriostatic and only slowly bactericidal at higher concentrations. hmr 3647 exhibited a significant pae with all strains studied, ranging from 1.2 h to 8.2 h at 10 x mic. the bacteriostatic activity and significant pae demonstrated by hmr 3647 are similar to those previously obtained with other macrolides.

TI  == [meropenem: microbiologic perspective].
AB  == meropenem is a beta-lactamic carbapenem derived from thienamycin and is structurally characterized by the presence of a beta-methyl group in position c1  which confers stability to the molecule versus renal dehydropeptidase 1 (dhp-1),  thereby making the coadministration of an enzyme inhibitor unnecessary. its esterochemical configuration of the lateral chain in c2 (dimethyl carbomoilpyrrolidenethium) increases the activity versus gram negative bacteria (enterobacteria and pseudomonas) and moreover, may explain the reduction in the proconvulsive effect observed in imipenem/cilastatin. meropenem has great bactericide power and has a very wide spectrum of activity depending on it low molecular weight and zwiterionic structure, stability versus almost all the clinically important beta-lactamases and high affinity for the pbps. it covers gram positive aerobes (staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococci, streptococci including streptococcus pneumoniae resistant to penicillin, enterococcus faecalis, rhodococcus equi, listeria monocytogenes) and gram negative bacteria (enterobacteria, p. aeruginosa, acinetobacter, aeromonas, plesiomonas, vibrio, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria, moraxella) and anaerobes  (bacteroides, prevotella, porphyromonas, fusobacterium, clostridium, peptostreptococcus, and propionibacterium acnes), being more active than imipenem versus gram negatives: p. aeruginosa (2-4-fold), enterobacteria (2-32-fold) and h. influenzae (4-8-fold) and less active versus the gram positives (enterococci,  streptococci and staphylococci). meropenem has no activity on enterococcus faecium, s. aureus resistant to methycillin, stenotrophomonas maltophilia and other genera producers of chromosomic methalo-beta-lactamases (carbapenemases). resistance may be due to impermeability given the loss of the oprd porin (oprd2 in enterobacteria and p. aeruginosa) loss of different membrane proteins (proteus mirabilis, proteus rettgeri, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes), modifications of the pbps (gram positive) and the production of carbapenemases (chromosomic methalo-beta-lactamases).

(mic90s, 1 microgram/ml). studies to establish mic quality-control guidelines indicated the following ranges: for e. faecalis atcc 29212, 0.5 to 4 micrograms/ml; for s. aureus atcc 29213, 0.25 to 1 microgram/ml;  and for streptococcus pneumoniae atcc 49619, 0.06 to 0.5 microgram/ml. the results of this study indicate that the in vitro activity of rpr 106972 against gram-positive bacteria and selected gram-negative respiratory organisms is promising and warrants additional studies of pharmacokinetics, and in vivo infection model dynamics.

AB  == the in vitro activity of ru-59863, a so-called "fifth generation" catechol cephalosporin, was evaluated against 606 bacterial isolates and compared with the activities of cefotaxime, ceftazidime, cefepime, and cefpirome. ru-59863 demonstrated a broad spectrum of inhibition and superior overall activity than comparators when tested against enterobacteriaciae (mic90s, 0.015 to 2 micrograms/ml), pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic90, 0.5 microgram/ml), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (mic90, 0.25 microgram/ml), acinetobacter ssp. (mic90, 4 micrograms/ml), and oxacillin-susceptible staphylococcus ssp. (mic90s,  0.5 to 8 micrograms/ml). potent ru-59863 activity was also observed against beta-haemolytic and viridans gr. streptococci (mic90s, 0.12-0.5 microgram/ml), streptococcus pneumoniae (mic90s, 0.03 to 0.5 microgram/ml), haemophilus influenzae (mic90, 0.06 microgram/ml), and neisseria gonorrhoeae (mic90, 0.06 micrograms/ml). ru-59863 demonstrated marginal potency against enterococcus faecalis (mics 2 to 16 micrograms/ml) and was inactive against enterococcus faecium (mic90, > 128 micrograms/ml). oxacillin-resistant staphylococci were not  inhibited by ru-59863 (mic90s, 32 to 128 micrograms/ml). among the cephalosporins tested, ru-59863 performed best versus ceftazidime-resistant bush group 1 isolates and strains producing extended spectrum beta-lactamases. ru-59863 was also effective against many fluoroquinolone-, aminoglycoside-, and imipenem-resistant isolates. ru-59863 seems to be a significant advance in cephalosporin chemistry and activity, especially against gram-negative pathogens  resistant to current beta-lactam therapeutic agents. further studies of human pharmacokinetics and against clinical infections are encouraged.

TI  == detection of the phosphorylcholine epitope in streptococci, haemophilus and pathogenic neisseriae by immunoblotting.
AB  == the phosphorylcholine (pc) determinant in streptococcus pneumoniae is known to be linked to the cell wall polysaccharides (c-ps) and to the lipoteichoic acid (lta) (forssman antigen) of the plasma membrane. western blotting with two pc specific  murine monoclonal antibodies (mabs) designated 145,f-2 (igm) and 147,a-1 (iga) showed a similar ladder-like pattern for all examined strains of s. pneumoniae and streptococcus mitis. purified antigens run in parallel indicated that this ladder pattern is due to the pc of lta. unlike other techniques, western blotting thus enables the identification of only one of the streptococcal structures carrying the pc epitope. gram-negative organisms were also examined, and six of 11 haemophilus influenzae strains reacted with the mabs. for this species, unlike the streptococci, only one fast moving band was detected. analyses by thin-layer  chromatography (tlc) detected the pc epitope in lipopolysaccharide (lps) fraction from h. influenzae. some strains of the neisseriaceae family were also positive by western blotting, but tlc and immunostaining did not detect the pc determinant in lps.

TI  == antibacterial activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin. rationale for clinical use.
AB  == most gram-positive organisms are highly susceptible to the streptogramin, quinupristin/dalfopristin (rp 59500; synercid). minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of isolates (mic90) were < or = 1 mg/l for staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, s. haemolyticus, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes and listeria  monocytogenes. importantly, quinupristin/dalfopristin shows similar activity against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains of s. aureus, and streptococci with benzylpenicillin (penicillin g)- or erythromycin-acquired resistance. enterococci have varying susceptibility to quinupristin /dalfopristin, although most isolates tested are susceptible to the drug, including vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant enterococcus faecium. e. faecalis are generally the least susceptible. among the gram-negative respiratory pathogens moraxella catarrhalis is susceptible and haemophilus influenzae is moderately susceptible to quinupristin/ dalfopristin; however, enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. are resistant.  the drug is active against anaerobic organisms tested, including clostridium perfringens, lactobacillus spp., bacteroides fragilis and peptostreptococcus. synergy has been demonstrated in vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant e. faecium, and methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. aureus with the combination  of vancomycin and quinupristin/ dalfopristin. quinupristin/dalfopristin shows antibacterial activity in vivo in animal models of infection, including methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. aureus infection in rabbits, s. aureus and s. pneumoniae in mice, and erythromycin-sensitive and -resistant viridans group streptococci infections in rats. the drug is rapidly bactericidal against gram-positive organisms (with the exception of enterococci) at concentrations similar to or within 4-fold of the mic, and it has a long postantibiotic effect both in vitro and in vivo.

AB  == the antimicrobial activity of cs-940, a new trifluorinated quinolone drug, was tested against 761 clinical isolates. cs-940 activity against members of the family enterobacteriaceae was most similar to that of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, with a large range of mics inhibiting 90% of isolates tested (mic90s)  of 0.015 to 16 micrograms/ml (median mic90, 0.06 micrograms/ml). cs-940 had greater activity than ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin when they were tested against acinetobacter spp. (mic90s, 0.03 micrograms/ml) and stenotrophomonas (xanthomonas) maltophilia (mic90s, 2 micrograms/ml). cs-940 demonstrated a high degree of potency against haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, and neisseria spp. (mic90s, < or = 0.06 micrograms/ml). cs-940 was two- to eightfold  more active than ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin against oxacillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus haemolyticus, and coagulase-negative staphylococcus spp. cs-940 was also very active against streptococcus spp. and enterococci, for which mic90s were < or = 2 micrograms/ml; for enterococcus faecium, however, the mic90 was 4 micrograms/ml. cs-940 was generally less active than a comparison investigational fluoroquinolone, clinafloxacin. this compound appears promising by in vitro test analysis and warrants further in vivo trials.

TI  == meropenem: a microbiological overview.
AB  == meropenem is a parenteral carbapenem antibiotic which has excellent bactericidal  activity in vitro against almost all clinically significant aerobes and anaerobes. its high activity is explained by ease of entry into bacteria combined with good affinity for essential penicillin binding proteins, including those associated with cell lysis. breadth of spectrum is due, in part, to stability to  all serine-based beta-lactamases, including those which hydrolyse third-generation cephalosporins. meropenem has an antibacterial spectrum which is broadly similar to that of imipenem but, whilst slightly less active against staphylococci and enterococci, it is more active against pseudomonas aeruginosa,  all enterobacteriaceae and haemophilus influenzae. amongst common human pathogens, only methicillin-resistant staphylococci and enterococcus faecium are  uniformly resistant to meropenem. the meropenem mics for penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae are higher than for penicillin-susceptible strains but the organisms remain susceptible. clinical susceptibility in vitro to meropenem is defined by mics of < or = 4 mg/l, intermediate susceptibility by mics of 8 mg/l and mics of > or = 16 mg/l define resistance; equivalent figures for zones of growth inhibition are > or = 14 (susceptible), 12-13 (intermediate) and < or = 11 (resistant) mm. studies in guinea pig models of systemic infection and infections localised to the lungs, urinary tract and the central nervous system,  some of which used immunocompromised animals, confirm the potential of meropenem  demonstrated in vitro. these factors, combined with the human plasma, tissue or urinary concentrations of meropenem which exceed modal mics for the pathogens isolated in clinical trials for most or all of the recommended 8 h dosing interval, predict that meropenem should be efficacious in the treatment of infections at many body sites.

TI  == antimicrobial characterization and interrelationships of dirithromycin and epidirithromycin.
AB  == dirithromycin is the 9-n,11-o-oxazine adduct formed from 9(s)-erythromycylamine and 2-(2-methoxyethoxy)acetaldehyde in which the methoxyethoxymethyl substituent  on the oxazine ring possesses the r configuration. epidirithromycin is its isomer in which the methoxyethoxymethyl substituent has the opposite (s) configuration.  both compounds readily epimerize in solution, reaching an equilibrium ratio of 85:15 in favor of dirithromycin, given sufficient time. the rate of interconversion is dependent upon ph, temperature, and solvent. an enriched sample of epidirithromycin (95% purity) was synthesized by condensing erythromycylamine and 2-(2-methoxyethoxy)acetaldehyde in diethyl ether as the reaction solvent, and the product was fully characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and high-pressure liquid chromatographic (hplc) analysis.  both oxazine derivatives readily hydrolyze to erythromycylamine, so all three compounds exhibit the same antibiotic activity in vitro. in order to determine whether dirithromycin itself possesses significant antimicrobial activity without initial hydrolysis to erythromycylmine, inhibition of cell-free ribosomal protein synthesis was measured under conditions which were adapted to minimize hydrolysis, as measured by analytical hplc in parallel experiments. under these particular conditions, inhibition of ribosomal protein synthesis by dirithromycin was < 10% of the value measured for erythromycylamine.

TI  == [nationwide survey on susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents in 1991].
AB  == this study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical isolates to  different antibacterial agents at 123 hospital laboratories throughout japan from september to december of 1991. in this study, identifications and susceptibility  testings were carried out at each hospital laboratory. the susceptibility testing were performed using the disk dilution method recommended by nccls. staphylococcus aureus and cns showed high or moderate resistance rates to methicillin (dmppc). streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, proteus mirabilis were highly susceptible to  many agents including beta-lactam antibiotics. though enterococcus faecalis was highly susceptible to ampicillin (abpc), piperacillin (pipc), imipenem (ipm), sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (st) compounds, enterococcus faecium was resistant  to almost all antibacterial agents but to st compounds. high susceptibility rates were observed for strains of enterobacter cloacae to ipm, gentamicin (gm) and ofloxacin (oflx) and for strains of proteus vulgaris to latamoxef (lmox), ipm, aztreonam (azt), gm and oflx. serratia marcescens and bacteroides fragilis group  were highly susceptible only to ipm. pseudomonas aeruginosa were sensitive to ceftazidime (caz), ipm, amikacin (amk) and tobramycin (tob). pseudomonas cepacia  was relatively susceptible only to caz. ipm showed strong antibacterial activity  to many species except for s. aureus and cns.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity and beta-lactamase stability of sy5555, a new oral penem antibiotic.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of sy5555, a new oral penem antibiotic, was compared with those of cefaclor, cefixime, and cefteram. sy5555 was more active than the comparison agents against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, morganella morganii, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, clostridium spp., and bacteroides fragilis. against providencia spp., proteus spp., and haemophilus influenzae, sy5555 was less active than cefixime or cefteram. sy5555 was inactive against methicillin-resistant s. aureus. enterococcus faecium, serratia marcescens, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and xanthomonas maltophilia, as were the comparison agents. the bactericidal activities of sy5555, cefixime, and cefteram were at or slightly greater than the mics for clinical isolates of escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae. sy5555  was not hydrolyzed by various types of beta-lactamases. however, sy5555 and the comparison agents were hydrolyzed by x. maltophilia (l-1) and p. aeruginosa/pms354 beta-lactamases, two bush group 3 beta-lactamases, sy5555 showed a high affinity, as did cefixime and cefteram, for cephalosporinases from  c. freundii gn7391 and e. cloacae gn7471 strains. these results suggest that sy5555 may be more specific than existing beta-lactam antibiotics.

TI  == [in vitro antibacterial activities of broad spectrum quinolones against clinical  bacterial isolates].
AB  == in vitro activities of broad-spectrum quinolones (sparfloxacin (spfx), ciprofloxacin (cpfx), lomefloxacin (lflx), fleroxacin (flrx), and levofloxacin (lvfx) were examined against clinical bacterial isolates: klebsiella pneumoniae,  haemophilus influenzae, moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis, methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus (mssa), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, and streptococcus pneumoniae). antibacterial activities of spfx, cpfx, and lvfx against gram-negative bacteria such as k. pneumoniae, m. (b) catarrhalis and h. influenzae were better than those of flrx and lflx. spfx showed the highest activity against all gram-positive bacteria tested in this study. however, strains showed high mic (> or = 16 micrograms/ml) to spfx were found among mrsa,  e. faecalis, and e. faecium, whose isolation frequencies were 28.6%, 10.0%, and 6.7%, respectively. the results of this study suggest that resistant strains of gram-positive bacteria against new quinolone might increase among clinical isolates.

TI  == [antimicrobial activities of aspoxicillin of fresh clinical isolates].
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of aspoxicillin (aspc) in terms of minimum inhibitory  concentration (mics) was compared with those of other penicillin antibiotics (pcs) against clinical isolates sent to us from medical institutions throughout japan in 1988, 1990 and 1992 and strains isolated and identified from samples collected from patients with various infections. 1. the mic80's of aspc against staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus spp., escherichia coli, bacteroides fragilis  group were almost the same as those against these isolates in 1985 to 1986. 2. a  trend for increasing susceptibility to pcs including aspc was observed in the isolates of s. aureus and haemophilus influenzae. this trend in s. aureus was attributed to the appearance of non beta-lactamase producing strains associated with the development of highly resistant strains among the methicillin-resistant  s. aureus (mrsa) as well as to a tendency toward yearly decreasing frequency of mrsa. the trend for the increased susceptibility in h. influenzae was related to  the decrease in the number of beta-lactamase production strains. 3. the frequency of the strains highly resistant to pcs including aspc increased. 4. no pcs-resistant strains were observed among the so-called beta-streptococci, while  among alpha-streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae there was a trend for decreasing frequency of strains with lower susceptibility to pcs or those with resistant to pcs. these strains may be variants which were also resistant to cephems and had penicillin-binding proteins (pbps). meanwhile, a high frequency of highly pcs-resistant strains were noted among enterococcus faecium. in view of the fact that the pcs-resistance of e. faecium is known to be related to pbps, the pattern of the susceptibility of the recent clinical isolates to beta-lactams is considered to be multimodal.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance patterns in korea.
AB  == recent in-vitro test results showed that in seoul (korea) aerobic gram-negative bacilli are often resistant to ampicillin and to the first-generation cephalosporins, but chloramphenicol-resistant salmonella typhi are extremely rare. almost all isolates of moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis, 49% of neisseria gonorrhoeae and 31% of haemophilus influenzae were beta-lactamase producers. seventhy-two percent of pneumococci were penicillin g resistant and 62% of staphylococci were methicillin resistant. among the enterococcus faecium,  59% were resistant to high-level gentamicin, but glycopeptide-resistant isolates  were not found. thirty-eight percent and 5% of bacteroides fragilis were resistant to clindamycin and cefoxitin, respectively. in conclusion, antimicrobial-resistant bacteria are prevalent in korea.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of bay y3118, a new full-spectrum fluoroquinolone.
AB  == bay y3118, 1-cyclopropyl-7-(2,8-diazabicyclo[4.3.0]non-8-yl)-6-fluoro-8- chloro-1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-3-quinolinecarboxylic acid hydrochloride, is a new fluoroquinolone with antibacterial activity against an expanded spectrum of species including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, and also anaerobes such as bacteriodes fragilis and clostridium perfringens. mic90s for s. aureus, s. epidermidis, e. faecalis, and s. pneumoniae clinical isolates were 0.125, 0.25, 0.125 and 0.25 micrograms/ml, respectively. against methicillin- and/or quinolone-resistant s. aureus, mic50 levels of bay y3118 were 10- to 100-fold lower than those of tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, or ciprofloxacin. the potency of bay y3118 against all members of the enterobacteriaceae generally  was equal to or 2-fold greater than that of ciprofloxacin or tosufloxacin. bay y3118 was also highly active against haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, acinetobacter spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa. increasing inoculum concentrations had a minimal effect on mic determinations. the drug was determined to be bactericidal based upon reference mbcs and time-kill curves. from the results presented here, it was concluded that this new compound surpasses other known 4-quinolones both in spectrum and activity and that its further evaluation by in vitro, in vivo, and clinical studies seems warranted.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of win 57273, a new fluoroquinolone antimicrobial agent.
AB  == the in vitro activity of win 57273, a new fluoroquinolone antimicrobial agent, was evaluated against approximately 600 bacterial isolates. the new drug was 4- to 128-fold more active than ciprofloxacin against a broad range of gram-positive organisms, with the new drug inhibiting 90% of strains of each species except enterococcus faecium at concentrations of less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml. win 57273 was four- to eightfold less active than ciprofloxacin against many members of the family enterobacteriaceae, but the mics of the new drug for 90% of strains tested (mic90s) were less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml (range, 0.25 to 8 micrograms/ml) for all species. branhamella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and legionella spp. were highly susceptible (mic90s, less than or equal to 0.06 microgram/ml). win 57273 demonstrated excellent activity against anaerobes (mic90s, less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml), and the drug was also more active than ciprofloxacin against 30 strains of mycobacterium avium-m. intracellulare (mic, 0.1 to 1.0 microgram/ml). the activity of win 57273 against gram-positive organisms was minimally affected by ph and increased at low ph (5.4) against gram-negative organisms. the bactericidal activity of win 57273 was demonstrated by time-kill techniques against selected organisms. the frequencies of spontaneous resistance  to the new agent were low, but resistant colonies could be selected after serial  passage of initially susceptible organisms through incremental concentrations of  the drug.

TI  == comparative in-vitro activity of meropenem on clinical isolates from the united kingdom.
AB  == mics of meropenem were determined for a wide range of common bacteria of clinical importance. for enterobacteriaceae, aeromonas spp., haemophilus influenzae, branhamella catarrhalis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, gardnerella vaginalis, campylobacter coli/jejuni, beta-haemolytic streptococci and anaerobes other than  clostridium difficile, mics were almost always within the range 0.002-0.5 mg/l. the activity of meropenem for these organisms was always greater than that of imipenem and piperacillin, and was similar to that of ceftazidime and cefotaxime  except that strains resistant to these latter, and to piperacillin, were usually  sensitive to imipenem and meropenem. meropenem was also active against most non-fermentative gram-negative bacilli, with mics in the range 0.12-4 mg/l but pseudomonas (xanthomonas) maltophilia was often resistant, as it was to all the other drugs tested. staphylococci, strreptococcus pneumoniae and other alpha-haemolytic streptococci were usually more sensitive to imipenem than to meropenem, but even methicillin-resistant staphylococci were sensitive to both drugs (mics less than 4 mg/l). enterococci were also less sensitive to meropenem  than to imipenem, and enterococcus faecium was invariably highly resistant to all the drugs tested except ciprofloxacin, which had marginal activity. results for ps. maltophilia and haem. influenzae were affected by media used for sensitivity  testing.

(415 strains), and campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to  their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to oflx was investigated with this species. as results, oflx showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against s.  aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, c. freundii, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp., and c. jejuni. however, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. the following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), enterococcus faecium (146 strains), branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), citrobacter diversus (128 strains), klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), proteus vulgaris (438 strains), serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), pseudomonas putida (154 strains), xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),
