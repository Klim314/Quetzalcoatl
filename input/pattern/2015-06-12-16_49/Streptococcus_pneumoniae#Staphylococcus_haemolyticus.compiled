TI  - A new plant-derived antibacterial is an inhibitor of efflux pumps in Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - An in-depth evaluation was undertaken of a new antibacterial natural product (1)  recently isolated and characterised from the plant Hypericum olympicum L. cf. uniflorum. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined for a panel of bacteria, including: meticillin-resistant and -susceptible strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus; vancomycin-resistant and -susceptible Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium; penicillin-resistant and -susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae; group A streptococci (Streptococcus pyogenes); and Clostridium difficile. MICs were 2-8 mg/L for most staphylococci and all enterococci, but were >/=16 mg/L for S. haemolyticus and were >32 mg/L for all species in the presence of blood. Compound 1 was also tested against Gram-negative bacteria, including Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium but was inactive. The MIC for Mycobacterium bovis BCG was 60 mg/L, and compound 1 inhibited the ATP-dependent Mycobacterium tuberculosis MurE ligase [50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) = 75 muM]. In a radiometric accumulation assay with a strain of S. aureus overexpressing the NorA multidrug efflux pump, the presence of compound 1 increased accumulation of (14)C-enoxacin in a concentration-dependent manner, implying inhibition of efflux. Only moderate cytotoxicity was observed, with IC50 values of 12.5, 10.5 and 8.9 muM against human breast, lung and fibroblast cell lines, respectively, highlighting the potential value of this chemotype as a new antibacterial agent and efflux pump inhibitor.
TI  - [Frequency distribution and antibiotic resistance of pathogens from the cerebrospinal fluid of 116 children with bacterial meningitis].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency distribution and antibiotic resistance of pathogens isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid samples of children with bacterial meningitis (BM) and to provide a basis for the timely and effective treatment of childhood BM. METHODS: Retrospective analysis was performed on pathogens isolated from 5097 cerebrospinal fluid samples collected from children in Kunming Children's Hospital between January 2008 and June 2012, as well as drug sensitivity test results. Kirby-Bauer antibiotic testing was used to analyze the sensitivity of these pathogens to commonly used antibiotics. RESULTS: A total of 116 pathogen strains were detected from the 5097 cerebrospinal fluid samples, including 77 (66.4%) Gram-positive strains, 30 (25.9%) Gram-negative strains, and 9 (7.8%) fungal strains, with a positive rate of 2.28%. The six most frequently isolated pathogens were Staphylococcus epidermidis (32 strains, 27.6%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (15 strains, 12.9%), Escherichia coli (15 strains, 12.9%), Staphylococcus haemolyticus (9 strains, 7.8%), Cryptococcus neoformans (8 strains, 6.9%) and Staphylococcus aureus (6 strains, 5.2%). Coagulase-negative staphylococci was the predominant pathogen in neonates and young infants with BM, and its sensitivity rates to penicillin, erythromycin and clindamycin were lower than 40%. Streptococcus pneumoniae had a penicillin sensitivity rate of 13.4%, while sensitivity rates to erythromycin and clindamycin reached 60.0%. No Staphylococcus and Streptococcus pneumoniae pathogens resistant to vancomycin were found. Gram-negative bacilli had relatively high sensitivity rates to imipenem, meropenem, cefoperazone/sulbactam and cefepime. CONCLUSIONS: Gram-positive cocci are the predominant pathogens for childhood BM over the past five years. The detected pathogens develop high resistance to commonly used antibiotics. To prevent misdiagnosis, careful attention should be paid to BM caused by Cryptococcus neoformans.
TI  - Hydramacin-1 in action: scrutinizing the barnacle model.
AB  - Hydramacin-1 (HM1) from the metazoan Hydra exerts antimicrobial activity against  a wide range of bacterial strains. Notably, HM1 induces the aggregation of bacterial cells, accompanied by precipitation. To date, the proposed mechanism of peptide-lipid interaction, termed the barnacle model, has not been described on the molecular level. Here, we show by biochemical and biophysical techniques that the lipid-peptide interactions of HM1 are initiated by electrostatic and hydrophobic effects, in particular, by tryptophan and neighboring polar amino acid residues that cause an interfacial localization of the peptide between two self-contained lipid bilayers. The high binding constants of HM1 upon lipid interaction are in the range of other potent antimicrobial peptides, e.g., magainin, and can be reasonably explained by two distinct epitopes on the surface of the peptide's global structure, which both contain SWT(K/R) motifs. The residues of this motif favor localization of the peptide in the head group region of phospholipid bilayers up to a penetration depth of 4 A and a minor participation of the lipids' hydrocarbon regions. Our results expand the knowledge about the molecular modes of action antimicrobial peptides use to tackle their target cells. Furthermore, the aggregation of living bacteria by HM1 was observed for a broad range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Therefore, the detailed view of peptide-lipid interactions described by the barnacle model consolidates it among the established models.
TI  - Microbiological diagnosis and antibiotic therapy in patients with community-acquired pneumonia and acute COPD exacerbation in daily clinical practice: comparison to current guidelines.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this secondary analysis was to evaluate current microbiological approaches, microbiology, and antibiotic therapy in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) in clinical practice and to compare them with current international guidelines. METHODS: A total of 362 patients with suspected CAP were enrolled in 14 European centers in a prospective multicenter study. RESULTS: A total of 279 inpatients (CAP, n = 222; AECOPD, n = 57) were evaluated. A total of 83 (37 %) CAP patients and 25 (44 %) AECOPD patients did not undergo any microbiological tests. In patients with CAP/AECOPD, blood culture was performed in 109 (49 %)/16 (28.1 %), urinary antigen tests for Legionella pneumophila in 67 (30 %)/9 (16 %), and sputum investigation in 55 (25 %)/17 (30 %), respectively. The most frequent pathogens in CAP were Streptococcus pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, L. pneumophila, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterobacter cloacae; in AECOPD they were Escherichia coli, Haemophilus haemolyticus, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. All CAP patients (mean = 11.1 days) and 35 (61.4 %) of AECOPD patients (mean = 8.9 days) received antibiotics. CAP patients were given mostly aminopenicillin with beta-lactamase inhibitors and AECOPD patients were given mostly cephalosporins. CONCLUSIONS: Pathogens isolated in CAP and AECOPD and the antibiotic therapy used are in good accordance with the guidelines. Blood culture, recommended for all CAP patients, was performed in only 50 % of the cases and antibiotic therapy lasted longer than the suggested 5-7 days. Therefore, international guidelines regarding performance of blood culture and duration of antibiotic therapy should be adopted more often. This duration was independent of the number of isolated pathogens and number of symptoms on admission. Therefore, the question arises as to whether microbiological data are necessary only for patients who are resistant to initial therapy.
TI  - An international activity and spectrum analysis of linezolid: ZAAPS Program results for 2011.
AB  - Through a continuing resistance surveillance monitoring program, linezolid was shown to maintain its spectrum and potency against a collection of 8059 clinically relevant Gram-positive strains collected from patients at 79 medical centers in 33 countries and Hong Kong. Linezolid MIC90 values were 2 mug/mL for methicillin-resistant and -susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and enterococci, and the MIC90 value was 1 mug/mL for coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS), beta-hemolytic streptococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and viridans group streptococci. Reference broth microdilution susceptibility testing for linezolid demonstrated a 99.83% susceptibility rate for all organisms. All S. aureus were inhibited by </=2 mug/mL. Three (0.3%) of 928 strains of CoNS had a linezolid MIC of 4 mug/mL and contained the cfr resistance gene; 1 also had a mutation in L3. There were 14 linezolid-resistant strains detected from 7 countries (Brazil [5], France [1], Germany [2] Greece [2], Italy [2], Ireland [1], and Spain [1]) representing 5 species (E. faecium, S. capitis, S. epidermidis, S. hominis, S. lugdenensis). A mobile cfr gene was noted in 2 species having elevated linezolid MIC values; one was a S. haemolyticus isolate with a MIC at 4 mug/mL. Resistance rates were as follows for the 6 groups of organisms sampled in the 2011 ZAAPS Program: CoNS, 1.2%; enterococci, 0.39%; among S aureus, S. pneumoniae, viridans group streptococci, and beta-hemolytic streptococci, no resistance was detected. As the activities of commonly used antimicrobials continue to be compromised by evolving resistance mechanisms in Gram-positive pathogens, linezolid-resistant strains remain uncommon and without increasing occurrence.
TI  - Comparative study of nasal bacterial carriage in pediatric patients from two different geographical regions.
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of bacterial carriage in the anterior nares of two different patient cohorts, aged 5-15 years. By use of a sensitive enrichment broth, Gram-positive and -negative bacteria were cultured from the two cohorts of each 100 patients at the Referral Clinic in Eritrea and at a German University Hospital. In the German cohort, 27% of the patients were positive either for Gram-negative (n=5) or -positive bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus (n=8; MRSA (n=2)), Staphylococcus epidermidis (n=12), Corynebacterium spp. (n=4), and Streptococcus pyogenes (n=1). In comparison, the Eritrean cohort revealed 33% bacterial carriers in the anterior nares. Among the identified species were S. aureus (n=2), S. epidermidis (n=13), Streptococcus haemolyticus (n=9), and Gram-negative rods including Klebsiella pneumoniae/oxytoca (n=5), Enterobacter agglomerans (n=4), Escherichia coli (n=2), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=1). Noteworthy, none of the Eritrean patients were positive for MRSA. In both cohorts there was no co-occurrence of Gram-positive and -negative bacteria in the anterior nares. However, we observed in two subjects of the Eritrean cohort co-colonization with S. epidermidis and S. haemolyticus. The occurrence of Gram-negative bacteria was less significant by age in the German cohort, whereas in the Eritrean cohort Gram-negative bacteria were more frequently detected in carriers aged 5-9 years. Continued surveillance of S. aureus and Gram-negative bacteria carriage deserves further attention and might help to determine future trends in the characteristics of nasal carriage, subsequent incidence of infections, and the potential effectiveness of targeted population based intervention.
TI  - Vaginal bacterial flora and cytology in proestrous bitches: role on fertility.
AB  - The study of canine vaginal cytology underwent limited evolution over the years.  Presence and significance of inflammatory cells in vaginal smears are little considered aspects in the bitch. Moreover, occurrence of vaginal bacteria in breeding bitches during follicular phase of the reproductive cycle, in absence of clinical signs of infection, involves the difficult question of antibiotics administration. The aim of this study was to relate findings in vaginal cytology (presence of neutrophils, lymphocytes, eosinophils, erytrocytes and bacteria) and microbial environment during proestrus with fertility outcomes (development of pregnancy, uterine infection, resorption, abortion and neonatal mortality). Bacteria sensitivity to antibiotics normally used in small animal practice was also evaluated. Bacteria isolated from vagina, in order of frequency, were Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus beta-haemolyticus, Pasteurella multocida, E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, E. coli haemolyticus, Arcanobacterium pyogenes, Streptococcus spp., Staphylococcus spp. and Acinetobacter spp. No mycoplasmas were observed. The present study showed that proestrous cytological aspects do not affect fertility. Eosinophils were never detected, while erythrocytes were always detected. During diestrus, E. coli was found in all pregnant bitches that developed clinical symptoms of uterine disorders (n = 3), resulting in uterine infection, resorption or abortion, but without statistical significance. Vaginal presence of Streptococcus spp. in proestrus was instead negatively associated with development of uterine infections (P = 0.005). Therefore, Streptococcus spp. could have a protective competitive role against more dangerous pathogens affecting fertility of the bitch. Among the 12 antibiotics tested, Gram-negative bacteria showed a significant sensitivity towards the amoxicillin and clavulanic acid association (P = 0.038). However, antibiotic treatment before mating, on the basis of positive culture, yet in the absence of clinical signs, seems to be unnecessary besides harmful leading to imbalance in vaginal commensal flora with adverse effects on fertility. In conclusion, vaginal bacteria, neutrophils, lymphocytes and erytrocytes should be considered as physiological aspect in the bitch during proestrus that does not require antibiotic therapy when asymptomatic.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity and phytochemical screening of serial extracts from leaves of Aegle marmelos (Linn.).
AB  - The in vitro antimicrobial activity of serial petroleum ether, chloroform and methanol extracts from leaves of Aegle mawmelos were investigated against bacterial and fungal species. All the extracts exhibited broad spectrum antimicrobial activity with zones of inhibition ranging from 10 to 22 mm against bacteria: Staphylococcus aureus, beta Streptococcus haemolyticus group A, Proteus mimrabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aenrginosa, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi, fungi: Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis and Aspergillusflavus. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) and the minimal microbicidal concentrations (MMC) of the extracts ranged from 1.25 to 10 mg/mL and 2.5 to 20 mg/mL respectively. Assessment of antibacterial efficacy of different extract revealed that Staphylococcus aureus, beta Streptococcus haemolyticus group A, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli showed high susceptibility to petroleum ether extract. Proteus mimrabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae showed high susceptibility to chloroform extract and Salmonella typhi showed high susceptibility to methanol extract. Petroleum ether extract exhibited the highest antifungal efficacy against all tested fungal species. Phytochemical screening revealed the presence of phenols, sterols in petroleum ether and chloroform extracts, whereas tannins, flavonoids, coumarins, saponins and triterpenoids in methanol extract. The ability of the leaf extracts of Aegle manmelos to inhibit growth of bacteria and fungi is an indication of its broad spectrum antimicrobial activity which could be a potential source for development of novel bioactive antimicrobial agents.
TI  - Decontamination efficacy of antiseptic agents on in vivo grown biofilms on rough  titanium surfaces.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Four common antimicrobial agents were evaluated for their efficacy in  reduction of aerobic bacteria intraorally grown in biofilms on rough titanium samples. The solutions investigated contained chlorhexidine, essential oil, octenidine, or citric acid. METHOD AND MATERIALS: Twenty volunteers wore splints with titanium sleeves intraorally for 10 days. Following irrigation with the antiseptics, the sleeves were removed and biofilm samples were taken by swabbing. The bacteria were first examined microscopically by Gram staining. These samples from the surfaces were then cultured under aerobic conditions to identify and quantify the colonizing bacteria. RESULTS: Compared to untreated controls, significant (P < .05) differences in antimicrobial efficacy were observed for the different regimens depending on bacterial species or even the subtype. The reduction rates achieved varied from 30.0% after 2 minutes of rinsing with chlorhexidine to 99.8% after 8 minutes of rinsing with octenidine. CONCLUSION: The irrigation regimens studied in this investigation reduced bacterial colonization in a mature biofilm grown intraorally on rough titanium surfaces. The highest absolute reduction was achieved after 8 minutes, but only the 2-minute reduction rates are significant for clinical practice. Taking this into consideration, the distinct decontamination efficacy of octenidine and citric acid is evident.
TI  - DNA microarray for detection of macrolide resistance genes.
AB  - A DNA microarray was developed to detect bacterial genes conferring resistance to macrolides and related antibiotics. A database containing 65 nonredundant genes selected from publicly available DNA sequences was constructed and used to design 100 oligonucleotide probes that could specifically detect and discriminate all 65 genes. Probes were spotted on a glass slide, and the array was reacted with DNA templates extracted from 20 reference strains of eight different bacterial species (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Escherichia coli, and Bacteroides fragilis) known to harbor 29 different macrolide resistance genes. Hybridization results showed that probes reacted with, and only with, the expected DNA templates and allowed discovery of three unexpected genes, including msr(SA) in B. fragilis, an efflux gene that has not yet been described for gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Spectrum and antibiotic resistance of uropathogens isolated from hospital and community patients with urinary tract infections in two large hospitals in Kuwait.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the spectrum of microbial etiology and antibiotic resistance pattern of the uropathogens that cause urinary tract infections in 2 large teaching hospitals in Kuwait over a period of 1 year. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Vitek identification card system was used to identify the uropathogens. Susceptibility of the isolates against 18 antibiotics was performed by the microbroth dilution method using the Vitek automated system. In addition, gram-positive bacteria were tested in parallel by the disk diffusion technique. RESULTS: The six overall most common isolates were: Escherichia coli, accounting for 47% of isolates in both hospitals, followed by Candida spp. (10.8%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (9.6%), Streptococcus agalactiae (GBS; 9.5%), Enterococcus faecalis (4.2%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4.1%). Amikacin provided the widest coverage amongst all the antibiotics tested followed by ciprofloxacin, gentamicin and piperacillin-tazobactam. For the gram-negatives, high resistance (26-63%) to the beta-lactam antibiotics was noted, especially to ampicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cephalothin and cefuroxime. Resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was also high. None of the enterococci was resistant to the glycopeptides, but 38-60% of the Staphylococcus haemolyticus were resistant to vancomycin or teicoplanin. CONCLUSION: These data show the high level of antimicrobial resistance amongst the uropathogens causing urinary tract infection in the two hospitals studied.
TI  - PD-140248 (Parke-Davis & Co).
AB  - PD-140248 is an isomerase inhibitor and topoisomerase II inhibitor under development by Parke-Davis and Co as a potential treatment for bacterial infection. Although no details of active development have been published in the scientific literature since 1996, in September 1999, the company confirmed that PD-140248 is still in active development [338530]. The compound is one of two new pyrrolidinyl naphthyridines (the other compound being PD-131628) with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, including activity against quinolone-resistant bacteria. PD-140248 demonstrates strong in vitro activity, particularly against Gram-positive bacteria, such as quinolone-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (S aureus), Staphylococcus epidermidis (S epidermidis), Staphylococcus haemolyticus (S haemolyticus), methicillin- and ciprofloxacin-resistant S aureus, Streptococcus species, Streptococcus pneumoniae (S pneumoniae) and Enterococcus faecalis (E faecalis). An MIC90 value of 0.015 microg/ml was obtained against Haemophilus influenzae (H influenzae) and Moraxella catarrhalis [160129]. The (3R,1S) enantiomer, PD-140248, demonstrated a 1- to 10-fold enhanced activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms in vitro and in vivo compared to its stereoisomers, and has thus been targeted for further preclinical studies [133377].
TI  - [Review on the etiology and treatment of bacterial pneumonias].
AB  - The bacterial pneumoniae are the significant factor of morbidity and mortality all over the world. So USA are at the sixth place per mortality cause. The bacteria are in 60-80% of cases the causes of pneumonia in the communities. Therefore this is the review on the ethiology of the verification and treatment of pneumonias in the 17-month period in the General hospital "Sarajevo". In the period of the 1st January 2002 till the 31st May 2003 year, it was examined 105 sputa on the antibiogram, and in 12 cases (11.4%) was found the positive bacterial finding. Most often were gram negative bacteria in 7 cases (58.3%), while were found the gram positive in 5 patients (41.7%). Therefore that the majority of the examinees belonged to the risk group, and that were the patients with over 50 years of age 11 (78.6%), with the chronic obstructive lung disease 5 (35.7%), with the malignant disease 1 (7.1%) and with the coinfection of the urinary tract. E. coli was found in 3 patient (25.0%), Kl. Pneumoniae in 2 (16.7%), Ps. aeruginosis in 1 (8.3%), Citrobacter freundi in 1 (8.3%), and in 2 cases (16.7%) were isolated. Staphylococcus intermedius and Streptococcus beta haemolyticus gr. A and Str. Pneumoniae in 1 case (8.3%). To the patients with the positive finding of sputum on antibiogram were most often administered empirically cefalosporia of the third generation because it was about the more severe patients, then the combination of ampicillin with gentamicin. All were dismissed as recovered or in better condition. Pneumonias is in the risk groups are possible to prevent to the five-years pneumococcus vaccine when is indicated or by influenza vaccine when simultaneously was prevented the viral, that is the possible bacterially superinfected pneumonia.
TI  - [Bacterial causes of meningitis in newborns].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Bacterial meningitis jeopardizes the life of affected newborns and  in survived children often leaves permanent sequels. The sooner the diagnosis is established and the therapy is started, the more a prosperous outcome can be expected. When the indication is established, lumbar punction should be performed. On the basis of the results of cytological and biochemical analyses of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) that point to bacterial meningitis, the initial therapy should begin even before the results of bacteriological analyses. It is important to know which causes are to be expected in order to make an adequate choice of antibiotics for initial therapy. The AIM of this study is to identify the causes of meningitis, frequency of their occurrings and mortality-rate in the affected newborns. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective study was carried out in the Paediatric Department of the Institute from January 1, 1978 to December 31, 2000. Patients originated from all parts of Yugoslavia. After the establishing of indication, lumbar punction was performed. CSF was sent to cytological, biochemical and bacteriological analyses. Diagnosis of meningitis was established when at least two criteria of four were fulfilled: 1. isolation of the cause by CSF culture; 2. elevation of CSF leukocyte count more than 20 with predominance of polymorphonuclear leukocytes; 3. hypoglucorrhachia (glycaemia less than 40 mg percent or less than 50 percent of glycaemia); 4. identification of bacteria by the Gram stain of CSF sediment. In 173 newborns the cause of bacterial meningitis was confirmed. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Causes of meningitis were as follows: E. coli in 46 newborns (N) (26.5%), Streptococcus B haemolyticus group B in 35 N (20.2%), K. pneumoniae in 27 N (15.6%), K. oxytoca in 3 N (1.7%), Proteus spp in 14 N (8%), Salmonella spp in 12 N, Pseudomonas spp in 9 N, Streptococcus pneumoniae in 9 N, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus in 4 N, Enterobacter spp in 3 N, L. monocytogenes and Serratia marcescens and Staphylococcus aureus in 2 N each, and in one N. meningitidis, Streptococcus group D, Citrobacter, Morganella morganii and Alkaligenes xilosoxidans. Over the period 1978-1987, the most frequent causes were: E. coli (28.2%), SBHB (26.8%) and Klebsiella spp (11.3%). Over the period 1991-2000, order and frequency of causes had been changed: Klebsiella spp (26.8%), E. coli (19.2%), SBHB (14.1%), etc. In addition, new causes appeared, namely: Morganella morganii, Citrobacter, K. oxitoca and Alkaligenes xylosoxidans (Table 2). Of a total of 173 patients, 52 (30.1%) died: of 124 children with meningitis caused by gram-negative bacteria, 39 (31.4%) died, and of 49 children with gram-positive bacteria, 13 (26.5%) died (Table 1). Comparing the first and the last decade, mortality decreased by only 0.2% (Table 2). The explanation might be that the patients came to the Institute too late, and after manifestation of resistant and multiresistant causes that obscured the appropriate selection of antibiotics for initial therapy. The precious time between the onset of the disease and start of the therapy was lost in this way. Newborns with bacterial meningitis should be treated only in health institutions where the intensive care units for newborns exist. CONCLUSION: The most frequent causes of meningitis are the following: E. coli, SBHB and Klebsiella pn. Frequency of causes of meningitis changed with time. New uncommon causes have appeared. The mortality-rate remained very high.
TI  - Comparative in vitro study of pulp capping materials.
AB  - AIM: In a comparative in vitro study we examined the bactericidal effect, adhesion and shrinkage of 5% potassium nitrate in Carboxy-Adhaesor, 5% potassium chloride in Carboxy-Adhaesor, Carboxy-Adhaesor, Adhaesor and Dycal. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The bactericidal effect of the investigated pulp capping materials on the isolated microorganisms Staphylococcus aureus, Staph. epidermidis, Streptococcus viridans alpha-haemolyticus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus beta-haemolyticus was assessed by the diffusion method around each disk in mm. The adhesion and shrinkage were assessed after hardening of the material. RESULTS: The results obtained showed higher bactericidal activity of polycarboxylate cements in comparison to Adhaesor and Dycal. The largest zone of inhibition was found around the disks with polyacrilic acid, followed by 5% KNO3 in polyacrilic acid, 5% KCl in polyacrilic acid; significantly smaller is the zone around Dycal. The difference was statistically significant (p<0.01). The adhesion and shrinkage of polycarboxylate cements were estimated as very good, better than those of Adhaesor and Dycal. CONCLUSION: The bactericidal effect of 5% KNO3 in polycarboxylate cement is very good for the microorganisms isolated from deep caries. The adhesion to hard tissues is very good, which suggests good marginal adaptation to the cavity.
TI  - Evaluation of the Uro-Quick, a new rapid automated system, for the detection of well-characterized antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
AB  - The Uro-Quick system has been employed to detect antibiotic resistance in genotypically and/or phenotypically well-characterized bacterial species including those that might not be easily identified by routine procedure. In order to achieve full agreement between the antibiotic susceptibility results obtained by the reference method (NCCLS) and the Uro-Quick system, the optimal experimental conditions (inoculum size, time of incubation and antibiotic concentration) for each strain to be used by the automatic system were determined. The shorter time periods for generation of correct susceptibility results were 180 min for ampicillin- and ciprofloxacin-resistant Escherichia coli and for ESBL- and Inhibitor-resistant TEM (IRT)-producing E. coli; 360 min for penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae, as well as for strains with reduced susceptibility to this antibiotic (both intermediate, and resistant isolates). The same time was required to detect erythromycin-resistant pneumococci irrespective of their mechanism of resistance (ribosomal methylation and efflux-mediated), Streptococcus pyogenes exhibiting the three erythromycin-resistance phenotypes (constitutive, inducible and M-type) and Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis and Moraxella morganii refractory to third-generation cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, ciprofloxacin and other classes of antimicrobial agents; 480 min for penicillin-resistant, constitutive and inducible oxacillin-resistant (OXA-R) Staphylococcus aureus and OXA-R Staphylococcus epidermidis. The same period of time was also necessary to find the great majority of drug-resistance exhibited by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Teicoplanin-resistant Staphylococcus haemolyticus, vancomycin-resistant (VanA, VanB, VanC) high-level aminoglycoside-resistant (HLAR) Enterococcus spp, and imipenem-resistant P. aeruginosa required longer incubation (24 h) to be detected. The results obtained indicate that Uro-Quick might be a reliable and promising instrument for the correct detection of the above antibiotic resistance markers.
TI  - [Post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--I. Gram-positive bacteria].
AB  - As a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, and carbapenems. Changes in the bacterial susceptibility for CZOP were also evaluated with the resistance ratio calculated with breakpoint MIC. Sixteen species (2,363 strains) of Gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2001, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus epidermidis (MSSE), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE), Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus avium, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae (PSSP), penicillin-intermediate resistant S. pneumoniae (PISP), penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP), Streptococcus milleri group and Peptostreptococcus spp. The antibacterial activity of CZOP either against MSSA or MSSE was preferable (MIC90: 2 or 0.5 micrograms/mL) and comparable to those of other cephems. CZOP was also effective on MRSE (MIC90: 16 micrograms/mL) but not on MRSA. CZOP and other cephems had low antibacterial activity against S. haemolyticus (MIC90: 64 micrograms/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against S. saprophyticus was comparable to or higher than those of other cephems, but the MIC90 of CZOP in 2001 was higher than those in 1996-2000 (32 vs 1-2 micrograms/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. faecalis was comparable to that of cefpirome (CPR; MIC90: 16 micrograms/mL) and higher than those of other cephems. No antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. faecium and E. avium was observed, like other drugs. The antibacterial activity of CZOP against S. pyogenes was as potent as those of cefotiam and CPR (MIC90: < or = 0.063 microgram/mL), and, against S. agalactiae, was also preferable (MIC90: 0.125 microgram/mL). CZOP indicated preferable antibacterial activity either against PSSP, PISP, or PRSP (MIC90: 0.25, 1, or 2 micrograms/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against S. milleri group was also preferable, but the MIC90 of CZOP in 2001 was higher than those in 1996-2000 (4 vs 0.5 micrograms/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against Peptostreptococcus spp. was preferable but weaker than those of cefazolin and cefmetazole. The resistance ratio estimated from breakpoint MIC of CZOP was 95.9% in MRSA, 93.5% in PRSP, 63.3% in PISP, 35.8% in S. haemolyticus, 27.9% in E. faecalis, and 13.3% MRSE. Those resistance ratios were comparable to those for cefepime (CFPM), but E. faecalis showed 91.2% for CFPM. The difference in the resistance ratio of E. faecalis demonstrated that CZOP successfully maintained its antibacterial activity against these species. In correlation of drug susceptibility, 40.3% of PRSP was not inhibited at breakpoint MIC either CZOP or CFPM while 69.2% at breakpoint MIC either CZOP or ceftazidime. In conclusion, the antibacterial activities of CZOP against the Gram-positive bacteria obtained from the 6-year duration study were consistent with the results from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. A decline in the sensitivities of S. saprophyticus, S. milleri group, PISP, and PRSP to CZOP, however, was suggested.
TI  - [Yearly changes in antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates between 1996 and 2001--I. Gram-positive bacteria].
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2001 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, and penicillins. A total of 1,274 strains in 15 species of Gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from January to December, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus avium, and Peptostreptococcus spp. CZOP possessed stable antibacterial activities against all strains tested throughout 6 years. The MIC90 of CZOP against MRSA and S. haemolyticus tended to decrease while against S. pneumoniae and Peptostreptococcus spp., tended to increase year by year. However, the MIC90 just changed a little and were consistent with the results from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. Increases in the MIC90 against S. pneumoniae were also observed with ceftazidime (CPR), cefepime (CFPM), flomoxef (FMOX), sulbactam/cefoperazone (SBT/CPZ), and imipenem (IPM). Increases in the MIC90 against Peptostreptococcus spp. were also observed with FMOX, SBT/CPZ, and IPM. In conclusion, the annual antibacterial activities of CZOP against the Gram-positive bacteria did not considerably change. It, therefore, was suggested that CZOP had maintained high antibacterial activity during 6 years of post marketing.
TI  - Glycopeptide carboxamides active against vancomycin-resistant enterococci.
AB  - Glycopeptide antibiotics were synthesized via the PyBOP mediated condensation of  aliphatic, heterocyclic and aromatic amines with the C-terminus of vancomycin, LY264826 (A82846B) and semi-synthetic derivatives of these natural products. Amides of LY264826 and vancomycin demonstrated excellent activity against staphylococci and streptococci as compared to the parent natural product. However, the amides of N-alkylated LY264826 and N-alkylated vancomycin were active against vancomycin-resistant enterococci as well as other gram-positive pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus, S. haemolyticus, S. epidermidis and Streptococcus pneumoniae.
TI  - Comparability of antimicrobial susceptibility test results from 22 European countries and Israel: an external quality assurance exercise of the European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System (EARSS) in collaboration with the United Kingdom National External Quality Assurance Scheme (UK NEQAS).
AB  - The goal of this exercise was to organize external quality assurance (QA) of antibiotic susceptibility testing for laboratories participating in EARSS and to assess the comparability of susceptibility test results across countries, and guidelines. In September 2000, UK NEQAS distributed a set of three Streptococcus pneumoniae strains, two Staphylococcus aureus strains and one Streptococcus haemolyticus strain. Laboratories reported the guideline followed, the interpretation of the susceptibility test result and the MIC, if tested. In this study we considered results 'concordant' if the reported interpretation of the participating laboratory agreed with the designated interpretation of reference laboratories. Overall, 433 (92%) of 471 laboratories from 23 countries reported back. Of the 8685 tests that were assessed, 8322 (96%) were interpreted correctly by the participants. Concordance for detection of penicillin non-susceptibility in the three S. pneumoniae strains was 96%, 90% and 87%, respectively. Laboratories performed extremely well in detecting oxacillin resistance in the homogeneously methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strain, but the concordance rate dropped from 100% to 77% in the heterogeneously resistant MRSA strain. Concordance for detection of teicoplanin resistance in the S. haemolyticus strain was 82%. We stratified concordance rates first for country and then for guideline used, but observed only minor differences among countries and guidelines. Quantitative methods yielding an MIC were more concordant than non-MIC methods for penicillin resistance in the S. pneumoniae strains (94% versus 79%). The NCCLS guideline was the most frequently followed, by 61% of laboratories from 19 countries. This exercise shows that, overall, countries participating in EARSS are capable of delivering susceptibility data of good quality. The comparability of susceptibility data for penicillin resistance in S. pneumoniae and for homogeneous methicillin resistance in S. aureus is satisfactory among European countries and across guidelines. However, we emphasize the importance of determining an MIC for suspected penicillin non-susceptible S. pneumoniae and for suspected glycopeptide non-susceptible S. aureus. Laboratories, particularly in some countries, may need to improve their capability to detect oxacillin resistance in heterogeneously resistant MRSA. For continuous external quality assessment we recommend that laboratories participate in national and international schemes with frequent distribution of control strains.
TI  - Sensitivity and rapidity of blood culture bottles in the detection of cornea organ culture media contamination by bacteria and fungi.
AB  - AIMS: To test the bactericidal activity of standard organ culture medium, and to  compare the sensitivity and rapidity of blood culture bottles with conventional microbiological methods for detection of bacteria and fungi inoculated in a standard cornea organ culture medium. METHODS: The bactericidal activity of contaminated standard organ culture medium containing 100 IU/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 micro g/ml amphotericin B was evaluated after 48 hours of incubation at 31 degrees C with five inocula of 14 bacteria. Two yeasts (Candida spp) and one Aspergillus were also tested. Contaminated media were then inoculated in three blood bottles (aerobic, anaerobic, fungal) placed in a Bactec 9240 automat; three conventional microbiological broths were the control. Changes in colour of organ culture medium and growth on conventional broth were screened daily by visual inspection. The sensitivity and rapidity of detection of contamination were compared between the three methods: blood bottle, conventional, and visual. RESULTS: Organ culture medium eradicated five bacteria irrespective of the starting inoculums: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Propionibacterium acnes, and Haemophilus influenzae. For micro-organisms where the medium was ineffective or bactericidal only (methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Bacillus subtilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Candida albicans, Candida kruzei, Aspergillus fumigatus), the blood bottle, conventional, and visual methods detected microbial growth in 100%, 76.5%, and 70% of cases respectively. Mean detection time using blood bottles was 15.1 hours (SD 13.8, range 2-52). In cases of detection by the blood bottle method and the conventional method, the former was always faster: 95.5% against 65.2% detection within 24 hours (p=0.022) respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Blood bottles detect more efficiently and more rapidly a wider range of bacteria and fungi than the conventional microbiological method and the visual inspection of organ culture media.
TI  - Inhibition by yeast killer toxin-like antibodies of oral Streptococci adhesion to tooth surfaces in an ex vivo model.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Monoclonal (KTmAb) and recombinant (KTscFv) anti-idiotypic antibodies, representing the internal image of a yeast killer toxin, proved to be microbicidal in vitro against important eukaryotic and prokaryotic pathogens such as Candida albicans, Pneumocystis carinii, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Staphylococcus aureus, S. haemolyticus, Enterococcus faecalis, E. faecium, and Streptococcus pneumoniae, including multidrug-resistant strains. KTmAb and KTscFv exerted a strong therapeutic effect in well-established animal models of candidiasis and pneumocystosis. Streptococcus mutans is the most important etiologic agent of dental caries that might result from the metabolic end products of dental plaque. Effective strategies to reduce the disease potential of dental plaque have considered the possibility of using antibiotics or antibodies against oral streptococci in general and S. mutans in particular. In this study, the activity of KTmAb and KTscFv against S. mutans and the inhibition and reduction by KTmAb of dental colonization by S. mutans and other oral streptococci in an ex vivo model of human teeth were investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: KTscFv and KTmAb were used in a conventional colony forming unit (CFU) assay against a serotype C strain of S. mutans, and other oral streptococci (S. intermedius, S. mitis, S. oralis, S. salivarius). An ex vivo model of human teeth submerged in saliva was used to establish KTmAb potential of inhibiting or reducing the adhesion to dental surfaces by S. mutans and other oral streptococci. RESULTS: KTmAb and KTscFv kill in vitro S. mutans and other oral streptococci. KTmAb inhibit colonization of dental surfaces by S. mutans and oral streptococci in the ex vivo model. CONCLUSIONS: Killer antibodies with antibiotic activity or their engineered derivatives may have a potential in the prevention of dental caries in vivo.
TI  - [Yearly changes in antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates between 1996 and 2000--I. Gram-positive bacteria].
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2000 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, and penicillins. Fifteen species, 1,062 strains, of Gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from January to December, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA; n = 127), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA; n = 123), Staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 104), Staphylococcus haemolyticus (n = 58), Streptococcus pyogenes (n = 100), Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 50), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 125), Enterococcus faecalis (n = 150), Enterococcus faecium (n = 50), Enterococcus avium (n = 50), and Peptostreptococcus spp. (P. anaerobius, P. asaccharolyticus, P. magnus, P. micros, P. prevotii; n = 125). CZOP possessed stable antibacterial activities against all strains tested throughout 5 years. The MIC90 of CZOP against MRSA and S. haemolyticus tended to decrease while against S. pneumoniae and Peptostreptococcus spp., tended to increase year by year. However, the MIC90 just changed a little and were consistent with the results from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. Increases in the MIC90 against S. pneumoniae were also observed with cefpirome (CPR), cefepime (CFPM), flomoxef (FMOX), sulbactam/cefoperazone (SBT/CPZ), and imipenem (IPM). Increases in the MIC90 against Peptostreptococcus spp. were also observed with ceftazidime (CAZ), CPR, CFPM, FMOX, SBT/CPZ, and IPM. The decreases in the sensitivities were not always considered to depend upon generation of resistant bacteria because the annual MIC range of each antibacterial agent was almost generally wide every year and the annual sensitivity of each strain to the agents extremely varied. In conclusion, the annual antibacterial activities of CZOP against the Gram-positive bacteria did not considerably change. It, therefore, was suggested that CZOP had maintained high antibacterial activity during 5 years of post-marketing.
TI  - Evaluation of the VITEK 2 system for identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of medically relevant gram-positive cocci.
AB  - A study was conducted to evaluate the new VITEK 2 system (bioMerieux) for identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing of gram-positive cocci. Clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus (n = 100), coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) (n = 100), Enterococcus spp. (n = 89), Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 29), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 66) were examined with the ID-GPC identification card and with the AST-P515 (for staphylococci), AST-P516 (for enterococci and S. agalactiae) and AST-P506 (for pneumococci) susceptibility cards. The identification comparison methods were the API Staph for staphylococci and the API 20 Strep for streptococci and enterococci; for antimicrobial susceptibility testing, the agar dilution method according to the procedure of the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) was used. The VITEK 2 system correctly identified to the species level (only one choice or after simple supplementary tests) 99% of S. aureus, 96.5% of S. agalactiae, 96.9% of S. pneumoniae, 92.7% of Enterococcus faecalis, 91.3% of Staphylococcus haemolyticus, and 88% of Staphylococcus epidermidis but was least able to identify Enterococcus faecium (71.4% correct). More than 90% of gram-positive cocci were identified within 3 h. According to the NCCLS breakpoints, antimicrobial susceptibility testing with the VITEK 2 system gave 96% correct category agreement, 0.82% very major errors, 0.17% major errors, and 2.7% minor errors. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing showed category agreement from 94 to 100% for S. aureus, from 90 to 100% for CNS, from 91 to 100% for enterococci, from 96 to 100% for S. agalactiae, and from 91 to 100% for S. pneumoniae. Microorganism-antibiotic combinations that gave very major errors were CNS-erythromycin, CNS-oxacillin, enterococci-teicoplanin, and enterococci-high-concentration gentamicin. Major errors were observed for CNS-oxacillin and S. agalactiae-tetracycline combinations. In conclusion the results of this study indicate that the VITEK 2 system represents an accurate and acceptable means for performing identification and antibiotic susceptibility tests with medically relevant gram-positive cocci.
TI  - [Post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--I. Gram-positive bacteria].
AB  - As a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, and carbapenems. Changes in the bacterial sensitivity for CZOP were also evaluated with the resistance ratio calculated with breakpoint MIC. Sixteen species (1,913 strains) of Gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2000, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA; n = 178), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA; n = 199), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus epidermidis (MSSE; n = 98), methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis (MRSE; n = 164), Staphylococcus haemolyticus (n = 72), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (n = 28), Enterococcus faecalis (n = 206), Enterococcus faecium (n = 91), Enterococcus avium (n = 72), Streptococcus pyogenes (n = 133), Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 138), penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae (PSSP; n = 133), penicillin-intermediate resistant S. pneumoniae (PISP; n = 100), penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP; n = 29), Streptococcus milleri group (n = 135) and Peptostreptococcus spp. (n = 137). CZOP possessed comparable antibacterial activities against MSSA and MSSE to other cephems, and was also effective on MRSE but not on MRSA. An antibacterial activity of CZOP against S. saprophyticus was comparable to or higher than other cephems. CZOP, however, did not indicate an antibacterial activity against S. haemolyticus, just like other cephems. An antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. faecalis was comparable to cefpirome (CPR) and higher than other cephems. No antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. faecium and E. avium was observed, just like other drugs. An antibacterial activity of CZOP against S. pyogenes was as potent as that of cefotiam (CTM), cefepime (CFPM) and CPR, and that against S. agalactiae was also preferable. CZOP and other cephems also had a preferable antibacterial activity against S. milleri group that was most sensitive to benzylpenicillin. An antibacterial activity of CZOP against Peptostreptococcus spp. was preferable but weaker than that of cefazolin, CTM and cefmetazole. The resistance ratio estimated with breakpoint MIC of CZOP was 96.5% in MRSA, 93.1% in PRSP, 60.0% in PISP, 40.3% in S. haemolyticus, 22.3% in E. faecalis, and 15.9% in MRSE. Those resistance ratios were similar to those for CFPM, but E. faecalis showed 90.8% resistance for CFPM. The difference in the resistance ratio of E. faecalis demonstrated that CZOP successfully maintained its antibacterial activity against this species. In conclusion, no remarkable annual change in the antibacterial activities of CZOP against the Gram-positive bacteria was observed. The sensitivities of PISP and PRSP to CZOP, however, was suggested to be decreasing.
TI  - The in vitro activity of daptomycin against 514 Gram-positive aerobic clinical isolates.
AB  - The in vitro activity of daptomycin was assessed in comparison with that of vancomycin and penicillin against a wide range of Gram-positive aerobic clinical isolates. MICs were determined by an agar dilution method on Mueller-Hinton agar (NCCLS/EUCAST) and on Isotonic agar adjusted to contain 50 mg/L free calcium (BSAC). Both media were enriched with 5% horse blood for fastidious organisms. Daptomycin MICs for all 172 staphylococci, including methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus, were 0.03-0.5 mg/L. For 99 of the 100 enterococci (Enterococcus faecalis, n = 50; Enterococcus faecium, n = 50), including 37 vancomycin-resistant isolates, they were 0.25-2 mg/L. For all 108 beta-haemolytic streptococci, including Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae, daptomycin MICs were 0.016- 0.25 mg/L; for 101 alpha-haemolytic streptococci, including Streptococcus pneumoniae and 'viridans' streptococci, they were 0.016-2 mg/L. For miscellaneous vancomycin-resistant isolates including Lactobacillus spp., Lactococcus spp., Leuconostoc spp., Pediococcus spp. and isolates of Enterococcus casseliflavus and Enterococcus gallinarum, daptomycin MICs were 0.03-2 mg/L; MICs for the seven isolates of Listeria monocytogenes were 0.25-4 mg/L. There was little difference between the results on Mueller-Hinton agar and on supplemented Isotonic agar The discrepant results occasionally obtained tended to be one dilution higher on supplemented Isotonic agar. Daptomycin was active (MICs < or = 2 mg/L) against all the isolates tested with the exception of one isolate each of E. faecium and L. monocytogenes (MICs = 4 mg/L). Our results indicate that daptomycin MICs are independent of methicillin and vancomycin MICs.
TI  - In vitro activities of RWJ-54428 (MC-02,479) against multiresistant gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - RWJ-54428 (MC-02,479) is a new cephalosporin with a high level of activity against gram-positive bacteria. In a broth microdilution susceptibility test against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), RWJ-54428 was as active as vancomycin, with an MIC at which 90% of isolates are inhibited (MIC(90)) of 2 microg/ml. For coagulase-negative staphylococci, RWJ-54428 was 32 times more active than imipenem, with an MIC(90) of 2 microg/ml. RWJ-54428 was active against S. aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Staphylococcus haemolyticus isolates with reduced susceptibility to glycopeptides (RWJ-54428 MIC range, < or = 0.0625 to 1 microg/ml). RWJ-54428 was eight times more potent than methicillin and cefotaxime against methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MIC(90), 0.5 microg/ml). For ampicillin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis (including vancomycin-resistant and high-level aminoglycoside-resistant strains), RWJ-54428 had an MIC(90) of 0.125 microg/ml. RWJ-54428 was also active against Enterococcus faecium, including vancomycin-, gentamicin-, and ciprofloxacin-resistant strains. The potency against enterococci correlated with ampicillin susceptibility; RWJ-54428 MICs ranged between < or = 0.0625 and 1 microg/ml for ampicillin-susceptible strains and 0.125 and 8 microg/ml for ampicillin-resistant strains. RWJ-54428 was more active than penicillin G and cefotaxime against penicillin-resistant, -intermediate, and -susceptible strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC(90)s, 0.25, 0.125, and < or = 0.0625 microg/ml, respectively). RWJ-54428 was only marginally active against most gram-negative bacteria; however, significant activity was observed against Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC(90)s, 0.25 and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively). This survey of the susceptibilities of more than 1,000 multidrug-resistant gram-positive isolates to RWJ-54428 indicates that this new cephalosporin has the potential to be useful in the treatment of infections due to gram-positive bacteria, including strains resistant to currently available antimicrobials.
TI  - In vitro activity of monoclonal and recombinant yeast killer toxin-like antibodies against antibiotic-resistant gram-positive cocci.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Monoclonal (mAbKT) and recombinant single-chain (scFvKT) anti-idiotypic antibodies were produced to represent the internal image of a yeast killer toxin (KT) characterized by a wide spectrum of antimicrobial activity, including gram-positive cocci. Pathogenic eukaryotic and prokaryotic microorganisms, such as Candida albicans, Pneumocystis carinii, and a multidrug-resistant strain of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, presenting specific, although yet undefined, KT-cell wall receptors (KTR), have proven to be killed in vitro by mAbKT and scFvKT. mAbKT and scFvKT exert a therapeutic effect in vivo in experimental models of candidiasis and pneumocystosis by mimicking the functional activity of protective antibodies naturally produced in humans against KTR of infecting microorganisms. The swelling tide of concern over increasing bacterial resistance to antibiotic drugs gives the impetus to develop new therapeutic compounds against microbial threat. Thus, the in vitro bactericidal activity of mAbKT and scFvKT against gram-positive, drug-resistant cocci of major epidemiological interest was investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: mAbKT and scFvKT generated by hybridoma and DNA recombinant technology from the spleen lymphocytes of mice immunized with a KT-neutralizing monoclonal antibody (mAb KT4) were used in a conventional colony forming unit (CFU) assay to determine, from a qualitative point of view, their bactericidal activity against Staphylococcus aureus, S. haemolyticus, Enterococcus faecalis, E. faecium, and Streptococcus pneumoniae strains. These bacterial strains are characterized by different patterns of resistance to antibiotics, including methicillin, vancomycin, and penicillin. RESULTS: According to the experimental conditions adopted, no bacterial isolate proved to be resistant to the activity of mAbKT and scFvKT. CONCLUSIONS: scFvKT exerted a microbicidal activity against multidrug resistant bacteria, which may represent the basis for the drug modeling of new antibiotics with broad antibacterial spectra to tackle the emergence of microbial resistance.
TI  - A comparison of antimicrobial resistance rates in Gram-positive pathogens isolated in the UK from October 1996 to January 1997 and October 1997 to January 1998.
AB  - Rates of resistance for two consecutive years for 28 centres (10 Teaching, nine Associate Teaching and nine District General hospitals) in the UK were compared. Combined rates of resistance for each of the hospital types of Staphylococcus aureus to methicillin revealed an increase in the rate of resistance in Teaching hospitals (12.5% year 1, 23.5% year 2), but, for Associate Teaching and District General hospitals rates fell (Associate Teaching 19.1% year 1, 11.9% year 2; District General 16.5% year 1 and 11.3% year 2). Using conventional methodology to determine MICs, no strain was considered to have reduced susceptibility to vancomycin. Among coagulase-negative staphylococci, increased resistance was observed for Staphylococcus epidermidis to rifampicin, for Staphylococcus haemolyticus to clindamycin, for Staphylococcus saprophyticus to penicillin and for Staphylococcus spp. to clindamycin, methicillin and rifampicin. For Streptococcus pneumoniae an upward trend in low-level resistance to penicillin was observed (18 of the 28 centres), however, for high-level resistance the trend was in the opposite direction (only four centres showed an increase). For Enterococcus faecalis there was a trend to a fall in levels of resistance, the only exception being an increase in high-level gentamicin resistance (10.5% year 1, 15.1% year 2, P = 0.0388). For Enterococcus faecium rates of resistance were not significantly different except for increases in resistance to nitrofurantoin and rifampicin.
TI  - Mixed infection in adult bacterial meningitis.
AB  - 12 adult patients suffering from bacterial meningitis caused by mixed infection were identified at Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital over a period of 13 years (1986-1998), and they accounted for 6.5% (12/184) of our culture-proven adult bacterial meningitis. The 12 cases included seven males and five females, aged 17-74 years. Six of the 12 cases had community-acquired infections and the other six had nosocomially-acquired infections. Ten of the 12 cases had associated underlying diseases, with head trauma and/or neurosurgical procedure being the most frequent. Both gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens were identified in these 12 cases with gram-negative pathogens outnumbering the gram-positive ones. The implicated pathogens, starting with the most frequent, included Enterobacter species (Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes), Klebsiella species (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca), Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus species (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus haemolyticus), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterococcus, Serratia marcescens, Citrobacter diversus, Proteus mirabilis, Streptococcus viridans and Neisseria meningitidis. Six of the 12 cases were found to have multi-antibiotic-resistant strains, which included E. cloacae in one, A. baumannii in one, K. pneumoniae in one and S. aureus in three. The management of these 12 cases included appropriate antibiotics and neurosurgical procedures including shunt revision. Despite the complexity of implicated pathogens and the high incidence of emergence of resistant strains, the overall mortality rate (8.3%, 1/12) was not higher than that in adult bacterial meningitis. However, complete recuperation was difficult in adult patients with mixed bacterial meningitis.
TI  - [Antibiotic sensitivity of pneumonia pathogens in newborns and problems of antibacterial therapy of the pathologic process].
AB  - The results of the bacteriological investigation of the secretion from the trachea, large bronchi and fauces of 36 newborns (including 27 preterms) with severe pneumonia were analyzed. 20 of them were born of women with complicating somatic, obstetric and gynecologic histories: candidiasis, herpes genitalis, chronic endometritis, adnexitis or chronic pyelonephritis that could be the risk of the fetus intranatal infection. During the acute period of pneumonia in the newborns within the first 4-8 days of life mainly Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated (51.3 per cent), Staphylococcus epidermidis, S. haemolyticus and Enterococcus faecalis were less frequent (18.9, 8.1 and 5.4 per cent, respectively). Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus anhaemolyticus and other organisms were extremely rare. On the whole the gramnegative microflora predominated. The study of the antibiotic susceptibility showed that the majority of the P. aeruginosa isolates were susceptible to amikacin and polymyxin B, the isolates susceptible to ceftazidime were less frequent, 20-25 per cent of the isolates were susceptible to ciprofloxacin, cefoperazone and imipenem and practically no isolates were susceptible to gentamicin. The S.epidermidis isolates were susceptible to rifampicin and vancomycin and in rare cases to fusidin and amikacin and resistant to oxacillin. When the treatment course was more than 15 days, the isolates proved to be susceptible to 1/3 of the presently available antibiotics. Because of the host low protective forces, peculiarities of the infection pathways and high frequency of the resistant strains it is valid to include netilmicin, imipenem, cefoperazone and ceftriaxone to the complex therapy of the newborns along with the substitution immunotherapy.
TI  - Clinical relevance of a European collaborative study on comparative susceptibility of gram-positive clinical isolates to teicoplanin and vancomycin.
AB  - Seventy laboratories in nine European countries (Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, The Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland and the UK) each collected 100 consecutive gram-positive bacterial pathogens during 1995. MICs were determined by a co-ordinating laboratory in each country using an agar incorporation method with Mueller Hinton medium (NCCLS). Quality control was ensured by distribution of five test strains to the co-ordinating laboratories. A total of 7078 isolates was collected: 2885 Staphylococcus aureus, 1706 enterococci, 1480 coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), 932 Streptococcus spp. (including 289 strains of S. pneumoniae) and 75 miscellaneous species. Of these, the country coordinators successfully re-tested 6824 isolates. Using NCCLS interpretive criteria, overall 39 isolates (including 28 strains of enterococci) were teicoplanin-resistant (0.57%) and 38 (mostly CNS; 0.56%) were intermediate, whilst 32 isolates (including 30 strains of enterococci) were resistant to vancomycin (0.47%) and 7 (all enterococci; 0.10%) were intermediate. The overall resistance rate was < or = 0.5%. The two glycopeptides were essentially active against the major pathogens encountered in the survey. The only real difference with clinical implications from previously reported susceptibility data is the emergence and spread of resistance in enterococci, particularly in E. faecium. Resistance was highest in SSTI, UTI, bloodstream and GI infections; no resistance was encountered in RTI, gynaecological infections or central nervous system infections. This resistance was also geographically diverse: Resistance to vancomycin in E. faecalis was present only in France, Germany, Italy, Portugal and Spain (Italy and Spain only for teicoplanin), whilst resistance to teicoplanin and vancomycin in E. faecium was present in all countries except Spain. Eight isolates (0.5% of all enterococci) were vancomycin-resistant but teicoplanin-susceptible, exhibiting the vanB phenotype. These were four strains of E. faecalis and four strains of E. faecium. Whilst isolates of S. haemolyticus had higher MIC of teicoplanin than other CNS, and were more susceptible to vancomycin, overall resistance to teicoplanin was low (3.3% in S. haemolyticus; 0.6% in CNS). S. haemolyticus was a relatively rare pathogen, accounting for 6.3% of all CNS isolates, and 1.4% of all gram-positives collected. The results of this survey show that, despite occasional nosocomial problems (e.g. with enterococci and S. haemolyticus), teicoplanin or vancomycin remain adequate therapy for infections caused by gram-positive pathogens in the 1990s.
TI  - The pattern of micro-organisms and the efficacy of new macrolide in acute lower respiratory tract infections.
AB  - Lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) is one of the major health problems in developing countries such as Indonesia. According to the National Household Health Survey conducted by the Ministry of Health in 1992, LRTIs still rank fourth as the main cause of death in Indonesia. The problem of LRTIs could be simply managed as long as the causative organism can be identified and the proper antibiotic known. In some occasions, it is not quite so easy to identify the causative micro-organism, especially in lower tract infections. There are several methods of obtaining specimens from LRTIs for cultures. The easiest, most simple way is to collect expectorated sputum. Unfortunately, because of the high rate of contamination by upper respiratory tract flora, this method is not reliable. Recognizing the difficulties with routine expectorated sputum cultures, two alternative approaches have been suggested. One approach is to bypass potential expectorated sputum 'contaminants' in the oropharynx by transtracheal aspiration or transthoracic aspiration. The second approach is to modify the usual technique of processing expectorated sputum by either washing techniques or by quantitative cultures. Azithromycin and clarithromycin are chemically related to macrolide erithromycin. Both antibiotics retain the traditional macrolide spectrum of activity against gram-positive and atypical pneumonia pathogens, while demonstrating improved activity against gram-negative bacteria. The American Thoracic Society (ATS) recommended the use of macrolide for outpatients with community-acquired pneumonia, without comorbidity and 60 years of age or younger. A total of 34 outpatients with acute LRTIs were open-comparative, randomly allocated to treatment with the new macrolide in Persahabatan Hospital, Jakarta, 1996. The purposes of this study were: (i) to identify the causative micro-organisms; and (ii) to evaluate the clinical efficacy of the new macrolide in these infections. Azithromycin 500 mg was given orally once a day for 3 days and was administered 1 h before or 2 h after every meal. Clarithromycin 500 mg was given orally every 12 h for 10 days. The diagnosis of the patients were: 16 with pneumonia, 10 with acute bronchitis and 8 with acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis. In this study of 34 patients, the sputum specimens were washed with N acetylcysteine before culture and we could only detect micro-organisms in one patient. Before treatment, we found 47 strains in 33 (97.05%) patients and after treatment we found five strains. From serological examination, only four (11.76%) atypical bacterial were detected. The most frequently found microorganisms were 23 strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae (40.42%), 10 of Streptococcus alpha haemolyticus (21.26%), five of Streptococcus pneumoniae (10.63%) and five of Staphylococcus aureus (10.63%). The atypical bacterial were: two Legionella pneumophila, one Mycoplasma pneumoniae and one Chlamydia pneumoniae. The clinical efficacy of new macrolides were 100% and the bacteriological responses with eradication of 94.12% vs 70.59% of isolates in the azithromycin and clarithromycin groups are shown in Table 1. There were no adverse reactions detected in the two treatment groups until the end of the study.
TI  - Bacterial and Ureaplasma colonization of the airway: radiologic findings in infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We designed this retrospective study to compare radiologic findings in premature infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in whom gram-positive cocci (GPC), gram-negative bacilli (GNB), or Ureaplasma urealyticum were colonized. Another objective was to correlate the radiologic findings of these patients with the clinical severity of BPD. STUDY DESIGN: We correlated serial tracheal aspirates with radiographic findings from 183 infants whose birth weight was < or = 1250 gm. BPD severity was assessed by oxygen dependency at 36 weeks of postconceptional age (36 w PCA) and at the time of discharge. Two radiologists independently scored films taken at birth and 1, 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35 days of life. RESULTS: Of the study population, 55% were male and 35% were black; 80% received surfactant and 69% received dexamethasone; 91% survived. GPC isolates from throat cultures were mainly Staphylococcus [corrected] epidermidis and Streptococcus haemolyticus. A superimposed GNB colonization was present in 37% of these infants. Most common isolates were Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, and Escherichia coli. Sepsis caused by GPC developed in 16% of all patients; 7% had sepsis caused by GNB. Infants infected with GNB remained receiving oxygen at 36 w PCA and at the time of discharge twice as often as those noninfected. RADIOLOGIC FINDINGS: Hyperinflation, interstitial changes, and generalized or localized emphysema were prominent features throughout. Mean radiologic scores increased over time in a pattern similar among GPC, GNB, and U. urealyticum infected and noninfected infants. High radiologic scores were not predictive at any time of infants who needed supplemental oxygen at 28 days and at 36 w PCA. Infants infected with U. urealyticum were neither clinically nor radiologically different than noncolonized neonates. CONCLUSION: GPC, GNB, and U. urealyticum airway colonization is not associated with particular radiographic changes at any time. GNB-infected infants had the most severe BPD course, and yet they were radiologically indistinguishable from the other patients. U. urealyticum colonization does not result in more clinically severe BPD or demonstrate a unique radiologic course.
TI  - Comparative in-vitro activities of quinupristin-dalfopristin against Gram-positive bloodstream isolates.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of quinupristin-dalfopristin was compared with those of vancomycin, teicoplanin, erythromycin, clarithromycin, rifampicin, imipenem, meropenem, ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against 414 bloodstream isolates of Gram-positive cocci. Quinupristin-dalfopristin inhibited strains of Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae at 0.12 mg/L, methicillin- and/or erythromycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis at 0.5 mg/L, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus bovis, Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus anginosus at 1 mg/L and Enterococcus faecalis at 8 mg/L.
TI  - [Microbial associations in Trichomonas urethritis].
AB  - The results on isolation of associated microflora from 190 patients suffering from Trichomonas urethritis are given. Microorganisms belonged to the species: Mycoplasma hominis. Ureaplasma urealyticum. Streptococcus pyogenes. Escherichia coli. Klebsiella pneumoniae. Proteus mirabilis. Moraxella lacunata. Acinetobacter Calcoaceticus and Candida. Staphylococcus cultures which were isolated from 100% patients belonged to 8 species: Staphylococcus aureus, S. intermedius, S. haemolyticus, S. epidermidis, S. capitis, S. hominis, S. warneri, S. saprophyticus. Most of Staphylococcus cultures had pathogenic features. Structure of Trichomonas vaginalis and interaction between them and associated microflora were studied by electron microscopy.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin. Rationale for clinical use.
AB  - Most Gram-positive organisms are highly susceptible to the streptogramin, quinupristin/dalfopristin (RP 59500; Synercid). Minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of isolates (MIC90) were < or = 1 mg/L for Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, S. haemolyticus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes and Listeria monocytogenes. Importantly, quinupristin/dalfopristin shows similar activity against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains of S. aureus, and streptococci with benzylpenicillin (penicillin G)- or erythromycin-acquired resistance. Enterococci have varying susceptibility to quinupristin /dalfopristin, although most isolates tested are susceptible to the drug, including vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant Enterococcus faecium. E. faecalis are generally the least susceptible. Among the Gram-negative respiratory pathogens Moraxella catarrhalis is susceptible and Haemophilus influenzae is moderately susceptible to quinupristin/ dalfopristin; however, Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. are resistant. The drug is active against anaerobic organisms tested, including Clostridium perfringens, Lactobacillus spp., Bacteroides fragilis and Peptostreptococcus. Synergy has been demonstrated in vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant E. faecium, and methicillin-sensitive and -resistant S. aureus with the combination of vancomycin and quinupristin/ dalfopristin. Quinupristin/dalfopristin shows antibacterial activity in vivo in animal models of infection, including methicillin-sensitive and -resistant S. aureus infection in rabbits, S. aureus and S. pneumoniae in mice, and erythromycin-sensitive and -resistant viridans group streptococci infections in rats. The drug is rapidly bactericidal against Gram-positive organisms (with the exception of enterococci) at concentrations similar to or within 4-fold of the MIC, and it has a long postantibiotic effect both in vitro and in vivo.
TI  - Functional cloning of the dihydropteroate synthase gene of Staphylococcus haemolyticus.
AB  - A 1,7-kilobase fragment of the Staphylococcus haemolyticus chromosome containing  the dihydropteroate synthase gene has been cloned by complementation in a temperature-sensitive mutant of Escherichia coli. The gene, designated folP, predicts a gene product of 29613 Da which shares significant amino acid sequence identity with other known bacterial dihydropteroate synthases. Analysis of the DNA sequence upstream and downstream of folP identified two further, incomplete open reading frames, one of which shows predicted amino acid sequence similarity to a second bacterial folic acid synthesis enzyme, dihydroneopterin aldolase.
TI  - Posttraumatic meningitis: bacteriology, hydrocephalus, and outcome.
AB  - To investigate the conditions that have developed in the treatment of posttraumatic meningitis with the use of new antibiotics, the authors studied cases with this infection retrospectively for a period of 68 months. Among 860 patients with moderate to severe head injuries, 12 (1.39%) sustained this complication. Of these, nine patients (75%) had a demonstrable basilar skull fracture and seven (58.3%) presented obvious rhinorrhea. Of these seven, four (57.1%) were treated conservatively and three (42.8%) finally underwent surgery for dural repair. The infecting agents were Gram-positive cocci (Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Staphylococcus warneri, Staphylococcus cohnii, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae) in five patients and Gram-negative bacilli in six patients (Escherichia coli in two, Klebsiella pneumoniae in two, and Acinetobacter anitratus in two). In one patient, the culture results were negative. All Gram-negative strains appeared resistant to ampicillin and third-generation cephalosporins, but sensitive to imipenem and to the quinolone ciprofloxacin. Gram-positive strains were sensitive to vancomycin. Hydrocephalus finally developed in the two patients who had received intrathecal infusions of amikacin. No other report of the relation of intrathecal infusion of antibiotics and the development of hydrocephalus was found. All patients survived, indicating that, for the present, posttraumatic meningitis is a nonfatal complication of head injury.
TI  - Post-antibiotic effect of the new streptogramin RP 59500.
AB  - The post-antibiotic effect (PAE) of RP 59500, a new streptogramin antibiotic, was determined for Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pyogenes. A 30 min exposure of Staphylococcus aureus to 5 micrograms/ml of RP 59500 produced a PAE of 1.9-6.9 h, and a 60 min exposure of 2.5 micrograms/ml produced a PAE of 3.2-8 h. A 30 min exposure of 5 micrograms/ml of RP 59500 of coagulase-negative staphylococci produced a PAE of 2.5-7.5 h. PAEs of constitutively erythromycin-resistant staphylococcal isolates were shorter than were the PAEs of highly susceptible isolates. A 30 min exposure to 5 micrograms/ml of RP 59500 produced a PAE of 7.5-9.5 h for Streptococcus pneumoniae and a PAE of greater than 18 h for Streptococcus pyogenes. RP 59500 produced a longer PAE with Staphylococcus aureus than did vancomycin, oxacillin or erythromycin. These results suggest that RP 59500 may be administered less frequently than would be suggested by its half-life.
TI  - In vitro activity of Ro 23-9424, a dual-action antibacterial agent, against bacterial isolates from cancer patients compared with those of other agents.
AB  - The in vitro activity of Ro 23-9424 against bacterial isolates from patients with cancer was compared with those of fleroxacin, ciprofloxacin, cefoperazone, and ceftazidime. Ro 23-9424 inhibited the majority of the members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and all Aeromonas isolates at a concentration of less than or equal to 1.0 micrograms/ml. It was also active against Acinetobacter spp. and Haemophilus influenzae, including beta-lactamase-producing strains. The MIC for 90% of isolates (MIC90) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was 16.0 micrograms/ml. All group A and B streptococci were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.25 micrograms/ml, and 90% of group G streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by 1.0 micrograms/ml. All methicillin-susceptible strains of Staphylococcus aureus and 60% of methicillin-resistant strains were susceptible to 2.0 micrograms of Ro 23-9424 per ml, whereas the MIC90 for Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus hominis isolates was 4.0 micrograms/ml. Staphylococcus haemolyticus and Enterococcus spp. were less susceptible; MIC90s for them were 16.0 and 32.0 micrograms/ml. Ro 23-9424 has a broad antibacterial spectrum and potential utility for therapy of infections in cancer patients.
TI  - Clinical results of a multicenter study with sulbactam/ampicillin for the treatment of patients with lower respiratory and urinary tract infections.
AB  - A total of 124 patients with lower respiratory tract (44) or urinary tract infections (80) were enrolled in an open, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of sulbactam/ampicillin, administered at the dosage of 3 g/die by intramuscular route. Pretreatment pathogens from patients with lower respiratory tract infections included: Streptococcus alpha-haemolyticus in 8 cases, Streptococcus beta-haemolyticus in 2 cases, Staphylococcus albus in 7 cases, Haemophilus influenzae in 7 cases, Staphylococcus aureus in 6 cases, Klebsiella oxytoca in 5 cases, Staphylococcus epidermidis in 3 cases, Streptococcus pneumoniae in 3 cases, Escherichia coli in 2 cases; in one subject (2.75%), no microorganisms were isolated. In vitro, 36 isolates (84%) were sensitive to SA and 7 (16%) were resistant. At the end of therapy, all the causative pathogens sensitive to sulbactam/ampicillin were eliminated. In patients with urinary tract infections, pretreatment pathogens were: E. coli in 40 cases, S. albus in 16 cases, Proteus mirabilis in 8 cases, Enterobacter agglomerans in 6 cases, Proteus vulgaris in 3 cases, Streptococcus faecalis in 3 cases, Streptococcus liquefaciens in 2 cases, Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 2 cases. In vitro, 64 isolates (80%) were sensitive to sulbactam/ampicillin and 16 (20%) were resistant. At the end of therapy, 63 out of the 64 pathogens sensitive to sulbactam/ampicillin were eliminated; in one case the therapy was interrupted due to adverse effect. Clinical efficacy: in subjects with lower respiratory tract infections, sulbactam/ampicillin cured 32 patients (72.72%) and ameliorated the clinical status of 8 patients (18.18%); efficacy rate: 90.9%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Bacteria causing respiratory infections in children and their sensitivity to antibiotics.
AB  - The author lists the most frequent bacterial agents isolated from the nose and pharynx samples of children that visited the Child Health Centre from 1983 to 1986. The gram-positive bacteria found most often were: Staphylococcus aureus (44% in 1983, 40% in 1986). Streptococcus pneumoniae (6% in 1983, 12% in 1986), and Streptococcus haemolyticus of group "A" (14% in 1983, 19% in 1986). The isolated gram-negative bacteria were: E. coli (14%), Klebsiella enterobacter (8%), and Proteus species and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2 to 4% [4, 6, 7, 16]). According to the author's analyses Staphylococcus aureus is highly sensitive to cloxacilline (96%, no changes in the 4-year period), then to sulphametoxasol-trimetropin (95%), to lincomycine (85% no change), while to penicillin it is entirely resistant. Streptococcus pneumoniae proved sensitive to ampicillin, lincocine and erythromycin (96%), to cephalosporins (83%) and to sulphamides (85%). Streptococcus haemolyticus from group "A" reacted to penicillin excellently. The greatest sensitivity to gram-negative bacteria E. coli related to aminoglycosides (97%), sulphonamides (96%), chloramphenicol (91%), and to cephalosporines (90%, in 1986 only 60%). Klebsiella enterobacter reacted to aminoglycosides (97%), sulphonamides (92%) and chloramphenicol (83%) and Pseudomonas to aminoglycosides (95%), gentamycin (92%), while to cephalosporines and ampicillin preparations it proved totally resistant.
TI  - In vitro activity of flurithromycin, a novel macrolide antibiotic.
AB  - Flurithromycin is an (8,S)-8-fluoroerythromycin isolated from the fermentation broth of Streptomyces erythraeus ATCC 31772, a blocked mutant of a strain producer of erythromycin. Its in vitro antibacterial activity has been determined on recent clinical isolates of respiratory pathogens. The range of MIC for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus beta-haemolyticus group A is from 0.0015 to 0.006 microgram/ml, for Haemophilus influenzae from 0.012 to 0.4 microgram/ml, for Staphylococcus aureus from 0.1 to 3.1 micrograms/ml. Its action is bacteriostatic and increases at alkaline pH. Among anaerobes Clostridium perfringens, Bacteroides fragilis, other species of Bacteroides and Peptostreptococcus are particularly susceptible. Flurithromycin also showed some activity on Mycobacterium bovis, M. scrofulaceum and M. phley. The determination of killing curves indicated that in most cases a killing effect was obtained at 4 X MIC. A combination of flurithromycin with ampicillin or doxycycline sometimes was synergic, but more often additive and never antagonistic. The possible interference of flurithromycin on some parameters of the natural system of defense was determined. At concentrations equal to therapeutic levels in blood and tissues, flurithromycin did not influence chemotaxis, phagocytosis, metabolic activation and the killing activity of neutrophils.
TI  - Value of the L-pyrrolidonyl-beta-naphthylamide hydrolysis test for identification of select gram-positive cocci.
AB  - A 4 hr test for hydrolysis of L-pyrrolidonyl-beta-naphthylamide (PYR) was evaluated for its use in identifying group A beta-hemolytic streptococci, group D enterococci, and Staphylococcus haemolyticus. All of the group A streptococci and the enterococci tested were positive in the PYR test, whereas all of the nongroup A, B, or D beta-hemolytic streptococci, all of the viridans, and all of the Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates tested were PYR negative. Two strains of Aerococcus species were PYR positive and could not be differentiated from enterococci in this test. All strains of S. haemolyticus, a single strain of S. intermedius and two of seven strains of S. warneri were PYR positive whereas all other staphylococci tested were PYR negative. The PYR test is suitable for routine, presumptive identification of group A streptococci, group D enterococci and S. haemolyticus in the clinical laboratory.
TI  - Effect of oral administration of a variety of bacteria on depressed macrophage functions in tumour-bearing rats.
AB  - In consideration of the well documented influence of normal microbial flora on the level of activation of macrophages, we evaluated the effects of oral administration of bacteria on rats with depressed macrophage functions. An oral, killed polyvalent vaccine (Diplococcus pneumoniae types I, II and III, Streptococcus haemolyticus, Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae), the live lyophilized Streptococcus faecium and spores of Bacillus subtilis, respectively, were administered orally to immuno-depressed rats. Results demonstrate the restoration of phagocytosis, intracellular killing and the chemotactic activity of macrophages. These experimental observations suggest that bacterial flora associated with mucosae can influence the level of activation of peritoneal macrophages.
TI  - [Clinical studies on cefroxadine in the field of pediatrics (author's transl)].
AB  - Cefroxadine dry syrup was administered to 57 children with acute febrile respiratory tract infections and 2 children with scarlet fever in the dose of 40 mg/kg/day q.i.d. for 2 approximately 7 days. 65 strains of organism were isolated as pathogen from the 59 patients, and 50 of the 65 strains (76.9%) showed bacteriologically good responses. Clinically, 55 children (93.2%) had good response. Out of 63 strains isolated from the 57 cases with respiratory infections, 48 strains (76.2%) showed good bacteriological response. As for the type of pathogen, all strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 86.4% of Streptococcus haemolyticus and 90.0% of Streptococcus pneumoniae had good response, but as for Haemophilus influenzae it was only 47.6%. In one child, Streptococcus pneumoniae appeared during cefroxadine treatment in addition to the preexisting Haemophilus influenza. From the 4 children having no response for their respiratory infections, H. influenzae were isolated in 3 cases and Streptococcus haemolyticus was isolated in 1 case, before starting the treatment. As for side effects, mild diarrhea developed in only 3 children.
TI  - Factors causing the clumping reaction of streptococcal strains with human plasma.
AB  - Fresh isolates of 204 strains of Streptococcus haemolyticus, 75 strains of viridans group Streptococcus, and 45 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae were studied for their clumping reactions with human plasma. The plasma and serum factors that clumped the streptococcal strains were compared with those that clumped a Staphylococcus aureus strain. One hundred eleven strains of S. haemolyticus, 10 strains of viridans group Streptococcus, and none of the strains of S. pneumoniae tested were clumped by human plasma. However, clumping activity was remarkably unstable after subculturing on plates containing Todd-Hewitt blood agar. The strain with the highest level of activity was clumped by fibrinogen and normal human serum. Results of tests of the clumping reactions of staphylococci and streptococci with human serum indicated that the serum factors responsible for those reactions may be identical.
TI  - [Resistance to antibiotics of bacteria involved in respiratory infections (author's transl)].
AB  - The present status of resistance to antibiotics of bacteria involved in respiratory infections is reviewed. Schematically it can outlined as follows. Streptococcus B-haemolyticus as well as Pneumococcus did not change their sensitivity to penicillin, but some strains are now resistant to tetracycline. Streptococcus viridans, Enterococcus and H. influenzae did not change substantially their sensitivity to antibiotics. Staphylococcus aureus is the bacterial species that always poses some problems with regard to antibiotic resistance. Due to the selection of strains penicillinase-producing because of the large use of penicillin, the most part of clinical isolates of staphylococci is now resistant to penicillin. In addition an increased number of strains resistant to the other antibiotics has been registered as soon as they has been introduced in therapy. The resistant strains spread in a particularly rapid way in hospital. The introduction in therapy of penicillinase-resistant penicillins constituted a remarkable advance in therapy of staphylococcal infection. However, there is now a growing number of indications about the emergence of methicillin resistant strains of staphylococci. On the other hand it must be recalled that since 1960 a marked reduction of incidence and mortality in severe staphylococcal infections has been noted. Incidence and mortality of respiratory infections due to Gram-negative bacilli is augmented particularly in connection with a larger use of immunosuppressive and antineoplastic therapies, of particular surgical or reanimation procedures, of intensive courses of antibiotic therapy etc. Emergence of Pseudomonas, Proteus, Serratia, Providencia, etc. infections poses many difficult problems of chemotherapy since these species are scarcely sensitive to antibiotics. Carbenicillin, cephalosporins, sisomicin, tobramycin, amikacin are the more recent drugs that alone or in combination may offer some chances of success in this field.
TI  - [Addition of gentamicine to polymethyl methacrylate for therapy of infectious bone diseases. Expeimental in vivo tests].
AB  - In experimental in vivo tests the therapeutic effect of Gentamicin added to Palacos is detected in a standardized osteomyelitic infection caused by Staph. aureus haemolyticus. The number of germ populations is reduced significantly by the antibiotic which is released in a microbiologically active concentration. On the other hand the number of germ populations in control trials (without adding an antibiotic) is remaining on a high level. During the time of the tests the appearance of other bacterial is registrated.
TI  - Bacteriology and clinical significance of hemolytic Haemophilus in the throat.
AB  - Hemolytic Haemophilus are rarely isolated in the clinical laboratory, as they do  not grow on sheep or human blood-agar alone. On rabbit blood-agar they grow well and are hemolytic, but they grow less well and are not hemolytic on sheep blood-agar with added X and V factors. A survey was made to determine their incidence in pharyngitis. From 28 of 100 sore throats and from 57 of 100 normal throats, only normal bacterial flora were isolated. beta-Streptococci were present in significant numbers in 9 sore and 11 normal throats; staphylococci in 8 sore and 4 normal throats; pneumococci in 20 sore and 11 normal throats; H. influenzae or H. parainfluenzae in 13 sore and no normal throats; hemolytic Haemophilus in 30 sore and 18 normal throats; enteric bacilli in 1 of each; Candida and Neisseria in 2 sore throats each. All of the 33 hemolytic Haemophilus isolates identified to species were H. parahaemolyticus. All were sensitive in vitro to chloramphenicol, erythromycin, and tetracycline; 30 were sensitive to ampicillin and 30 to penicillin, 26 to novobiocin, and 12 to methicillin. H. influenzae, H. parainfluenzae, and H. haemolyticus are indistinguishable by Gram stain morphology, but H. parahaemolyticus is larger than the other three. Hemolytic and nonhemolytic species are indistinguishable by colonial morphology or by nutritional requirements; only hemolysis gives positive differentiation. Nevertheless, only rarely would this be of clinical importance. H. parahaemolyticus apparently may cause pharyngitis, but it is almost always susceptible to penicillin and rarely if ever causes sequelae.
