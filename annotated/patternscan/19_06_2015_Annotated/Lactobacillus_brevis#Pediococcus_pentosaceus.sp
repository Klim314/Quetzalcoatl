TI  == prevalence of antibiotic resistance in lactic acid bacteria isolated from the faeces of broiler chicken in malaysia.
AB  == background: probiotics are commonly used as feed additive to substitute antibiotic as growth promoter in animal farming. probiotic consists of lactic acid bacteria (lab), which enhance the growth and health of the animal. probiotic also have higher possibility to become pathogenic bacteria that may carry antibiotic resistant gene that can be transmitted to other lab species. the aim of this study was to identify the lab species in the faeces of broiler chicken and to determine the prevalence of antibiotic resistant in lab of broiler chicken. methods: sixty faeces samples were collected from wet markets located in klang valley of malaysia for the isolation of lab using de-mann rogosa sharpe medium. thirteen species of lab were obtained in this study and the identification of lab was performed by using api test kit on the basis of carbohydrate fermentation profile. antibiotic susceptibility assay was then carried out to determine the prevalence of lab antibiotic resistance. results: lactococcus lactis subsp lactis was found in nine out of sixty faecal samples. lactobacillus paracasei was the second common lab species isolated from chicken faecal. no significant difference (p > 0.05) was found between the occurrence of  lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus curvatus, lactobacillus plantarum, leuconostoc lactis mesenteroides subsp mesenteroides/dectranium and pediococcus pentosaceus isolated from 5 different locations. most of the isolated lab was resistant to antibiotic and high variability of the antibiotic resistance was observed among the lab against 15 types of antibiotics. penicillin, amoxicillin,  chloramphenicol, and ampicillin had significant higher (p< 0.05) inhibitory zone  than nalidixic acid, gentamycin, sulphamethoxazole, kanamycin, and streptomycin.  conclusions: many species of lab were isolated from the faecal samples of broiler chicken that resistance to the common antibiotics used in the farm. the development of resistant against antibiotics in lab can be attributed to the long term exposure of antibiotic as growth promoter and therapeutic agents. thus, it is essential to advise farmer the safety measure of antibiotic application in animal farming. additionally, the supplementation of probiotic in animal feeding  also needs more attention and close monitoring.

TI  == putrescine production from different amino acid precursors by lactic acid bacteria from wine and cider.
AB  == the aim of this work was to study the production of biogenic amines and particularly putrescine in lactic acid bacteria (lab) related to wine and cider.  we applied an analytical protocol that involves the use of pcr and tlc techniques to determine the production of putrescine from different precursors. moreover, we also studied the ability of the lactobacillus and pediococcus tested to produce histamine and tyramine. the results showed that the majority of the lactobacillus brevis analyzed harbour both agdi and tdc genes and are tyramine and putrescine producers. conversely, among the other lab tested, only one lactobacillus hilgardii and one pediococcus pentosaceus produced putrescine. the agdi gene was  also detected in two other lab (lactobacillus mali and pediococcus parvulus), but no putrescine production was observed. finally, hdc gene and histamine production were found in strains (l. hilgardii 5211, isolated from wine, and lactobacillus casei 18, isolated from cider) that were not putrescine producers.

TI  == a description of the lactic acid bacteria microbiota associated with the production of traditional fermented vegetables in vietnam.
AB  == an important part of the daily nourishment in vietnam constitutes of fermented vegetables. bacteria and especially lactic acid bacteria play a central role in the production of many fermented vegetables. the current study was conducted to investigate the diversity of native lactic acid bacteria (lab) populations in 'dua muoi' (mustard and beet fermentation) and 'ca muoi' (eggplant fermentation), three types of popular traditional fermented vegetables of vietnamese origin. to  this end a polyphasic approach combining matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms) and phes gene sequence analysis was used. in addition, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis was performed as a culture-independent method to complement the observed culturable diversity data. a total of 881 lab isolates were recovered from 21 different samples. predominant lab associated with 'dua muoi' and 'ca muoi' were identified as lactobacillus fermentum (56.6%), lactobacillus pentosus  (24.4%) and lactobacillus plantarum (17.1%). less abundant species were pediococcus pentosaceus (1.0%) and lactobacillus brevis (0.5%). species present less than 0.1% included lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus pantheris and pediococcus acidilactici. in contrast to fermented mustard and beet with the highest prevalence of l. fermentum, the species most recovered from fermented eggplant samples was l. pentosus. in addition, an important degree of genetic variability within the different predominant species was observed and strain dependency correlating with the type of fermented vegetable or location of production could be demonstrated using multivariate statistics. this research gives an extensive and detailed inventory of the lab diversity associated with the production of diverse vietnamese fermented vegetables and demonstrates the influence of type of raw material and/or production location and conditions on this diversity.

TI  == effect of ethanol and low ph on citrulline and ornithine excretion and arc gene expression by strains of lactobacillus brevis and pediococcus pentosaceus.
AB  == the accumulation of citrulline and ornithine in wine or beer as a result of the arginine catabolism of some lactic acid bacteria (lab) species increases the risk of ethyl carbamate and putrescine formation, respectively. several lab species, which are found as spoilage bacteria in alcoholic beverages, have been reported to be arginine degrading. this study evaluates the effect of ethanol content and  low ph on the excretion of citrulline and ornithine by two strains belonging to the potential contaminant species lactobacillus brevis and pediococcus pentosaceus. in the conditions that most affected cell viability, arginine consumption per cell increased noticeably, indicating that arginine utilization may be a stress responsive mechanism. l. brevis showed a higher accumulation of ornithine in the media than p. pentosaceus. in the presence of ethanol, a higher  expression of the arcc gene was found in p. pentosaceus, which resulted in a lower excretion of citrulline and ornithine than in l. brevis. this suggests that l. brevis is more likely to produce these amino acids, which are precursors of ethyl carbamate and putrescine.

TI  == fast identification of wine related lactic acid bacteria by multiplex pcr.
AB  == the microflora of must and wine consists of yeasts, acetic acid bacteria and lactic acid bacteria (lab). the latter group plays an important role for wine quality. the malolactic fermentation carried out by lab leads to deacidification  and stabilisation of wines. nevertheless, lab are often associated with wine spoilage. they are mainly responsible for the formation of biogenic amines. furthermore, some strains produce exopolysaccharide slimes, acetic acid, diacetyl and other off-flavours. in this context a better monitoring of the vinification process is crucial to improve wine quality. moreover, a lot of biodiversity studies would also profit from a fast and reliable identification method. in this study, we propose a species-specific multiplex pcr system for a rapid and simultaneous detection of 13 lab species, frequently occurring in must or wine: lactobacillus brevis, lb. buchneri, lb. curvatus, lb. hilgardii, lb. plantarum, leuconostoc mesenteroides, oenococcus oeni, pediococcus acidilactici, p. damnosus, p. inopinatus, p. parvulus, p. pentosaceus and weissella paramesenteroides.

TI  == characterization of lactic acid bacteria isolated from sauce-type kimchi.
AB  == this study was carried out to investigate the isolation and characterization of lactic acid bacteria (lab) from naturally fermented sauce-type kimchi. sauce-type kimchi was prepared with fresh, chopped ingredients (korean cabbage, radish, garlic, ginger, green onion, and red pepper). the two isolated bacteria from sauce-type kimchi were identified as pediococcus pentosaceus and lactobacillus brevis by 16s rdna sequencing and tentatively named pediococcus sp. ij-k1 and lactobacillus sp. ij-k2, respectively. pediococcus sp. ij-k1 was isolated from the early and middle fermentation stages of sauce-type kimchi whereas lactobacillus sp. ij-k2 was isolated from the late fermentation stage. the resistance of pediococcus sp. ij-k1 and lactobacillus sp. ij-k2 to artificial gastric and bile acids led to bacterial survival rates that were 100% and 84.21%, respectively.

TI  == cultivable microbiota of lithobates catesbeianus and advances in the selection of lactic acid bacteria as biological control agents in raniculture.
AB  == the cultivable microbiota of skin and cloaca of captive lithobates catesbeianus includes microorganisms generally accepted as beneficial and potentially pathogenic bacteria. in order to select a group of potentially probiotic bacteria, 136 isolates were evaluated for their surface properties and production of antagonistic metabolites. then, 11 lactic acid bacteria (lab) strains were selected and identified as lactobacillus plantarum, lb. brevis, pediococcus pentosaceus, lactococcus lactis, l. garvieae and enterococcus gallinarum. studies of compatibility indicate that all the strains could be included in a multi-strain probiotic, with the exception of ent. gallinarum crl 1826 which inhibited lab species through a bacteriocin-like metabolite. these results contribute to the design of a probiotic product to improve the sanitary status of bullfrogs in intensive culture systems, to avoid the use of antibiotics and thus  to reduce production costs. it could also be an alternative to prevent infectious diseases during the ex situ breeding of amphibian species under threat of extinction.

TI  == functional compounds in fermented buckwheat sprouts.
AB  == fermented buckwheat sprouts (fbs) are used as multifunctional foods. their production process includes fermentation with lactic acid bacteria. the major strains were found to include lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus pentosus, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, and pediococcus pentosaceus in an investigation of the lactic acid bacteria. we searched for the  functional components, and nicotianamine (na) and 2''-hydroxynicotianamine (hna)  were identified as angiotensin i-converting enzyme (ace) inhibitors. na and hna increased during fermentation. indole-3-ethanol was identified as an antioxidant  (a sod active substance), and may have been generated from tryptophan during fermentation because it was not contained in green buckwheat juice. a safety test demonstrated that fbs contained were safe functional food components, showing negative results in buckwheat allergy tests. any buckwheat allergy substances might have been degraded during the fermentation process.

TI  == phenotypic and genotypic analyses of lactic acid bacteria in local fermented food, breast milk and faeces of mothers and their babies.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) are generally accepted as beneficial to the host and their presence is directly influenced by ingestion of fermented food or probiotics. while the intestinal lactic microbiota is well-described knowledge on its routes of inoculation and competitiveness towards selective pressure shaping  the intestinal microbiota is limited. in this study, lab were isolated from faecal samples of breast feeding mothers living in syria, from faeces of their infants, from breast milk as well as from fermented food, typically consumed in syria. a total of 700 isolates were characterized by genetic fingerprinting with  random amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) and identified by comparative 16s rdna sequencing and matrix assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof-ms) analyses. thirty six different species of lactobacillus, enterococcus, streptococcus, weissella and pediococcus were identified. rapd and maldi-tof-ms patterns allowed comparison of the lactic microbiota on species and strain level. whereas some species were unique for one  source, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus fermentum, pediococcus pentosaceus and lactobacillus brevis were found in all sources. interestingly, identical rapd genotypes of l. plantarum, l. fermentum, l. brevis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis and p. pentosaceus were found in the faeces of mothers, her milk and in faeces of her babies. diversity of rapd types found in food versus human samples suggests the importance of host factors in colonization and individual host specificity, and support the hypothesis that there is a vertical  transfer of intestinal lab from the mother's gut to her milk and through the milk to the infant's gut.

TI  == tyrosine- and histidine-decarboxylase positive lactic acid bacteria and enterococci in dry fermented sausages.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) and enterococci were isolated immediately after stuffing (day 0), at the end of ripening (28th day) and at the end of storage (112th day) from dry fermented sausages produced by two different producers (k; r) in two diameters (4.5 and 7 cm) using either of two spice mixtures (p; h) and  either of two starter cultures (pediococcus pentosaceus, c; lactobacillus curvatus+staphylococcus carnosus, f), resulting in a total of 16 different combinations. tyrosine-decarboxylase dna sequence (tyrdc) was identified on average in 88% and 44% of enterococci and lab isolates, respectively at the end of ripening, the corresponding figures regarding histidine-decarboxylase gene sequence (hisdc) was 71% and 16%, respectively. lactobacillus plantarum, l. brevis and l. casei/paracasei, and enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis were identified as tyramine/histamine producers in the sausages.

TI  == gene cloning, expression, and characterization of phenolic acid decarboxylase from lactobacillus brevis rm84.
AB  == phenolic acid decarboxylase (pad) catalyzes the synthesis of vinyl phenols from hydroxycinnamic acids. the gene encoding pad from lactobacillus brevis was cloned and expressed as a fusion protein in escherichia coli. the recombinant pad enzyme is a heat-labile enzyme that functions optimally at 22 degrees c and ph 6.0. the  purified enzyme did not show thermostability at temperatures above 22 degrees c.  l. brevis pad is able to decarboxylate exclusively the hydroxycinnamic acids, such as p-coumaric, caffeic, and ferulic acids, with k (m) values of 0.98, 0.96,  and 0.78 mm, respectively. the substrate specificity exhibited by l. brevis pad is similar to the pad isolated from bacillus subtilis and b. pumilus, but different from that of l. plantarum and pediococcus pentosaceus. as the c-terminal region may be involved in determining pad substrate specificity and catalytic capacity, amino acid differences among these proteins could explain the differences observed. the substrate specificity shown by l. brevis pad shows promise for the synthesis of high-added value products from plant wastes.

TI  == biodiversity of lactic acid bacteria in french wheat sourdough as determined by molecular characterization using species-specific pcr.
AB  == the lactic acid microflora of nine traditional wheat sourdoughs from the midi-pyrenees area (south western france) was previously isolated and preliminary characterized using conventional morphological and biochemical analysis. however, such phenotypic methods alone are not always reliable and have a low taxonomic resolution for identification of lactic acid bacteria species. in the present study, a total of 290 lab isolates were identified by pcr amplification using different sets of specific primers in order to provide a thorough characterization of the lactic flora from these traditional french sourdoughs. overall, the lab isolates belonged to 6 genera: lactobacillus (39%, 8 species), pediococcus (38%, 1 species), leuconostoc (17%, 2 species), weissella (4%, 2 species), lactococcus (1%, 1 species) and enterococcus (<1%, 1 species) and 15 different species were detected: l. plantarum, l. curvatus, l. paracasei, l. sanfranciscensis, l. pentosus, l. paraplantarum, l. sakei, l. brevis, p. pentosaceus, l. mesenteroides, l. citreum, w. cibaria, w. confusa, l. lactis and  e. hirae. facultative heterofermentative lab represent more than 76% of the total isolates, the main species isolated herein correspond to l. plantarum and p. pentosaceus. obligate heterofermentative lactobacilli (l. sanfranciscencis, l. brevis) represent less than 3% of the total isolates whereas leuconostoc and weissella species represent 21% of the total isolates and have been detected in eight of the nine samples. detection of some lab species was preferentially observed depending on the isolation culture medium. the number of different species within a sourdough varies from 3 to 7 and original associations of hetero- and homofermentative lab species have been revealed. results from this study clearly confirm the diversity encountered in the microbial community of traditional sourdough and highlight the importance of lab cocci in the sourdough  ecosystem, along with lactobacilli.

TI  == description of the microflora of sourdoughs by culture-dependent and culture-independent methods.
AB  == four types of sourdoughs (l, c, b, q) from artisanal bakeries in northern italy were studied using culture-dependent and culture-independent methods. in all samples, the yeast numbers ranged from 160 to 10(7)cfu/g, and the numbers of lactic acid bacteria (lab) ranged from 10(3) to 10(9)cfu/g. the isolated lab were sequenced, and a similarity was noted between two samples (c, q), both in terms of the species that were present and in terms of the percentage of isolates. in these two samples, lactobacillus plantarum accounted for 73% and 89% of the bacteria, and lactobacillus brevis represented 27% and 11%. in the third sample (b), however, the dominant lab isolate was lb. brevis (73%), while lb. plantarum  accounted for only 27%. the fourth sourdough (l) was completely different from the others. in this sample, the most prominent isolate was weisella cibaria (56%), followed by lb. plantarum (36%) and pediococcus pentosaceus (8%). in three out of four samples (l, c and q), all of the yeasts isolated were identified as saccharomyces cerevisiae, yet only candida humilis (90%) and candida milleri (10%) were isolated in the fourth sample (b). the microbial ecology of the sourdoughs was also examined with direct methods. the results obtained by culture-independent methods and dgge analysis underline a partial correspondence  between the dna and rna analysis. these results demonstrate the importance of using a combined analytical approach to explore the microbial communities of sourdoughs.

TI  == molecular screening of wine lactic acid bacteria degrading hydroxycinnamic acids.
AB  == the potential to produce volatile phenols from hydroxycinnamic acids was investigated for lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from spanish grape must and  wine. a pcr assay was developed for the detection of lab that potentially produce volatile phenols. synthetic degenerate oligonucleotides for the specific detection of the pdc gene encoding a phenolic acid decarboxylase were designed. the pdc pcr assay amplifies a 321 bp dna fragment from phenolic acid decarboxylase. the pdc pcr method was applied to 85 strains belonging to the 6 main wine lab species. lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus brevis, and pediococcus pentosaceus strains produce a positive response in the pdc pcr assay, whereas oenococcus oeni, lactobacillus hilgardii, and leuconostoc mesenteroides strains did not produce the expected pcr product. the production of vinyl and ethyl derivatives from hydroxycinnamic acids in culture media was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. a relationship was found between pdc pcr  amplification and volatile phenol production, so that the lab strains that gave a positive pdc pcr response produce volatile phenols, whereas strains that did not  produce a pcr amplicon did not produce volatile phenols. the proposed method could be useful for a preliminary identification of lab strains able to produce volatile phenols in wine.

TI  == taxonomic structure and monitoring of the dominant population of lactic acid bacteria during wheat flour sourdough type i propagation using lactobacillus sanfranciscensis starters.
AB  == the structure and stability of the dominant lactic acid bacterium population were assessed during wheat flour sourdough type i propagation by using singly nine strains of lactobacillus sanfranciscensis. under back-slopping propagation with wheat flour type 0 f114, cell numbers of presumptive lactic acid bacteria varied  slightly between and within starters. as determined by randomly amplified polymorphic dna-pcr and restriction endonuclease analysis-pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analyses, only three (ls8, ls14, and ls44) starters dominated throughout 10 days of propagation. the others progressively decreased to less than 3 log cfu g(-1). partial sequence analysis of the 16s rrna and reca genes and pcr-denaturating gradient gel electrophoresis analysis using the rpob gene allowed identification of weissella confusa, lactobacillus sanfranciscensis, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rossiae, lactobacillus brevis, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, pediococcus pentosaceus, and lactobacillus spp. as the dominant species of the raw wheat flour. at the end of propagation, one autochthonous strain of l. sanfranciscensis was found in all the sourdoughs. except for l. brevis, strains of the above species were variously found in the mature sourdoughs. persistent starters were found in association with other biotypes of l. sanfranciscensis and with w. confusa or l. plantarum. sourdoughs were characterized for acidification, quotient of fermentation, free amino acids, and community-level catabolic profiles by using biolog 96-well eco microplates. in particular, catabolic profiles of sourdoughs containing persistent starters behaved similarly and were clearly differentiated from the others. the three persistent starters were further used for the production of sourdoughs and propagated by using another wheat flour whose lactic acid bacterium population in part differed from the previous one. also, in this case all three starter strains persisted during propagation.

TI  == microbial diversity of traditional vietnamese alcohol fermentation starters (banh men) as determined by pcr-mediated dgge.
AB  == the diversity of fungi and bacteria associated with traditional vietnamese alcohol fermentation starters (banh men) was investigated by pcr-mediated dgge. from 52 starter samples, 13 species of fungi (including yeasts) and 23 species of bacteria were identified. the fungal composition of the starters was consistent with little variation among samples. it consisted of amylase producers (rhizopus  oryzae, r. microsporus, absidia corymbifera, amylomyces sp., saccharomycopsis fibuligera), ethanol producers (saccharomyces cerevisiae, issatchenkia sp., pichia anomala, candida tropicalis, p. ranongensis, clavispora lusitaniae), and (opportunistic) contaminants (xeromyces bisporus, botryobasidium subcoronatum). the bacterial microflora of starters was highly variable in species composition and dominated by lactic acid bacteria (lab). the most frequent lab were pediococcus pentosaceus, lactobacillus plantarum, l. brevis, weissella confusa, and w. paramesenteroides. species of amylase-producing bacillus (bacillus subtilis, b. circulans, b. amyloliquefaciens, b. sporothermodurans), acetic acid  bacteria (acetobacter orientalis, a. pasteurianus), and plant pathogens/environment contaminants (burkholderia ubonensis, ralstonia solanacearum, pelomonas puraquae) were also detected. fungal dgge was found to be useful for evaluating starter type and starter quality. moreover, in view of the  high biological diversity of these substrates, bacterial dgge may be useful in determining the identity of a starter. the constant occurrence of opportunistic contaminants highlights the need for careful examination of the role of individual components in starters.

AB  == a total of 192 lactic acid bacteria were isolated from 2 types of naturally fermented dry sausages at 3 different stages of the ripening process in order to  select the most suitable strains as starter cultures in dry-cured sausage manufacture according to their technological characteristics such as glucose fermentation, lactic and acetic acid production, and proteolytic, lipolytic, and  antimicrobial activities. identification of the isolates revealed that 31.2% were pediococcus pentosaceus, 26.9% lactococcus lactis, 18.6% pediococcus acidilactici, 17% lactobacillus brevis, and sporadic isolates of leuconostoc mesenteroides, lactobacillus plantarum, and lactobacillus curvatus. most of the strains did not produce gas from glucose and showed the capacity to produce lactic acid rapidly. some 25% of the strains were able to degrade tributyrin (esterase activity), but none showed lipolytic activity against olive oil and pork fat. only 3 strains of p. acidilactici showed weak proteolytic activity against myofibrillar or sarcoplasmic proteins. also, the same strains showed antimicrobial activity against listeria monocytogenes. nine strains with the best properties were preselected and tested for biogenic amine production. the results showed that two of the strains, identified as p. acidilactici by polymerase chain reaction, had the potential to be further tested as starter cultures in pilot processing of iberian sausages.

TI  == dna fingerprinting of lactic acid bacteria in sauerkraut fermentations.
AB  == previous studies using traditional biochemical identification methods to study the ecology of commercial sauerkraut fermentations revealed that four species of  lactic acid bacteria, leuconostoc mesenteroides, lactobacillus plantarum, pediococcus pentosaceus, and lactobacillus brevis, were the primary microorganisms in these fermentations. in this study, 686 isolates were collected from four commercial fermentations and analyzed by dna fingerprinting. the results indicate that the species of lactic acid bacteria present in sauerkraut fermentations are more diverse than previously reported and include leuconostoc citreum, leuconostoc argentinum, lactobacillus paraplantarum, lactobacillus coryniformis, and weissella sp. the newly identified species leuconostoc fallax was also found. unexpectedly, only two isolates of p. pentosaceus and 15 isolates of l. brevis were recovered during this study. a better understanding of the microbiota may aid in the development of low-salt fermentations, which may have altered microflora and altered sensory characteristics.

TI  == lactic acid bacteria in hamei and marcha of north east india.
AB  == hamei and marcha are mixed dough inocula used as starters for preparation of various indigenous alcoholic beverages in manipur and sikkim in india, respectively. these starters are traditionally prepared from rice with wild herbs and spices. samples of hamei and marcha, collected from manipur and sikkim, respectively, were analysed for lactic acid bacterial composition. the population of lactic acid bacteria (lab) was 6.9 and 7.1 log cfu/g in hamei and marcha, respectively. on the basis of phenotypic and genotypic characters, lab strains isolated from hamei and marcha were identified as pediococcus pentosaceus, lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus brevis. technological properties of lab such as antimicrobial properties, effect on acidification, ability to produce biogenic amines and ethanol, degree of hydrophobicity and enzymatic activities were also performed. pediococcus pentosaceus hs: b1, isolated from hamei, was found to produce bacteriocin. none of the strains produced biogenic amines. lab strains showed a strong acidifying ability and they also produced a wide spectrum of enzymes.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of non-enterococcal intrinsic glycopeptide-resistant gram-positive organisms.
AB  == non-enterococcal gram-positive bacteria that are intrinsically vancomycin-resistant have been infrequently isolated in association with serious  infections. however, well-documented infections have lately been reported with increasing frequency. because these organisms may be pathogens, we tested the mics of 19 antimicrobial agents by the agar dilution method for predicting susceptibility. the activity of these antimicrobial agents was assessed against 28 strains (lactobacillus rhamnosus, 6; lactobacillus acidophilus, 1; lactobacillus casei, 1; lactobacillus fermentum, 2; lactobacillus brevis, 1; lactobacillus plantarum, 1; weissella confusa, 2; leuconostoc mesenteroides, 7; leuconostoc lactis, 4; pediococcus acidilactici, 2; pediococcus pentosaceus, 1),  isolated from clinical specimens in an argentinian university hospital from 1997  to 2003. the mics of penicillin for 67% of the lactobacillus strains and 100% of  the leuconostoc spp. and pediococcus spp. strains tested were in the 0.25-2 microg/ml range. erythromycin was the most active antimicrobial overall. multiresistance was observed in 2 strains (lactobacillus rhamnosus, 1; lactobacillus plantarum, 1).

TI  == lactobacillus plantarum gene clusters encoding putative cell-surface protein complexes for carbohydrate utilization are conserved in specific gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == background: genomes of gram-positive bacteria encode many putative cell-surface proteins, of which the majority has no known function. from the rapidly increasing number of available genome sequences it has become apparent that many  cell-surface proteins are conserved, and frequently encoded in gene clusters or operons, suggesting common functions, and interactions of multiple components. results: a novel gene cluster encoding exclusively cell-surface proteins was identified, which is conserved in a subgroup of gram-positive bacteria. each gene cluster generally has one copy of four new gene families called csca, cscb, cscc  and cscd. clusters encoding these cell-surface proteins were found only in complete genomes of lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus sakei, enterococcus faecalis, listeria innocua, listeria monocytogenes, lactococcus lactis ssp lactis and bacillus cereus and in incomplete genomes of l. lactis ssp cremoris, lactobacillus casei, enterococcus faecium, pediococcus pentosaceus, lactobacillius brevis, oenococcus oeni, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and bacillus thuringiensis. these genes are neither present in the genomes of streptococci, staphylococci and clostridia, nor in the lactobacillus acidophilus group, suggesting a niche-specific distribution, possibly relating to association with plants. all encoded proteins have a signal peptide for secretion by the sec-dependent pathway, while some have cell-surface anchors, novel wxl domains, and putative domains for sugar binding and degradation. transcriptome analysis in l. plantarum shows that the csca-d genes are co-expressed, supporting their operon organization. many gene clusters are significantly up-regulated in a glucose-grown, ccpa-mutant derivative of l. plantarum, suggesting catabolite control. this is supported by the presence of predicted cre-sites upstream or inside the up-regulated csca-d gene clusters. conclusion: we propose that the csca, cscb, cscc and cscd proteins form cell-surface protein complexes and play a role in carbon source acquisition. primary occurrence in plant-associated gram-positive bacteria suggests a possible role in degradation and utilization of plant oligo- or poly-saccharides.

TI  == microbiological study of lactic acid fermentation of caper berries by molecular and culture-dependent methods.
AB  == fermentation of capers (the fruits of capparis sp.) was studied by molecular and  culture-independent methods. a lactic acid fermentation occurred following immersion of caper berries in water, resulting in fast acidification and development of the organoleptic properties typical of this fermented food. a collection of 133 isolates obtained at different times of fermentation was reduced to 75 after randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd)-pcr analysis. isolates were identified by pcr or 16s rrna gene sequencing as lactobacillus plantarum (37 isolates), lactobacillus paraplantarum (1 isolate), lactobacillus pentosus (5 isolates), lactobacillus brevis (9 isolates), lactobacillus fermentum (6 isolates), pediococcus pentosaceus (14 isolates), pediococcus acidilactici (1  isolate), and enterococcus faecium (2 isolates). cluster analysis of rapd-pcr patterns revealed a high degree of diversity among lactobacilli (with four major  groups and five subgroups), while pediococci clustered in two closely related groups. a culture-independent analysis of fermentation samples by temporal temperature gradient electrophoresis (ttge) also indicated that l. plantarum is the predominant species in this fermentation, in agreement with culture-dependent results. the distribution of l. brevis and l. fermentum in samples was also determined by ttge, but identification of pediococcus at the species level was not possible. ttge also allowed a more precise estimation of the distribution of  e. faecium, and the detection of enterococcus casseliflavus (which was not revealed by the culture-dependent analysis). results from this study indicate that complementary data from molecular and culture-dependent analysis provide a more accurate determination of the microbial community dynamics during caper fermentation.

TI  == use of real time pcr to determine population profiles of individual species of lactic acid bacteria in alfalfa silage and stored corn stover.
AB  == real-time polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) was used to quantify seven species of lactic acid bacteria (lab) in alfalfa silage prepared in the presence or absence of four commercial inoculants and in uninoculated corn stover harvested and stored under a variety of field conditions. species-specific pcr primers were designed based on reca gene sequences. commercial inoculants improved the quality of alfalfa silage, but species corresponding to those in the inoculants displayed variations in persistence over the next 96 h. lactobacillus brevis was the most abundant lab (12 to 32% of total sample dna) in all of the alfalfa silages by 96  h. modest populations (up to 10%) of lactobacillus plantarum were also observed in inoculated silages. pediococcus pentosaceus populations increased over time but did not exceed 2% of the total. small populations (0.1 to 1%) of lactobacillus buchneri and lactococcus lactis were observed in all silages, while lactobacillus pentosus and enterococcus faecium were near or below detection limits. corn stover generally displayed higher populations of l. plantarum and l. brevis and lower populations of other lab species. the data illustrate the utility of rt-pcr for quantifying individual species of lab in conserved forages  prepared under a wide variety of conditions.

TI  == 16s-ardra, a tool for identification of lactic acid bacteria isolated from grape  must and wine.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) are found in a great variety of habitats, including grape must and wines. there is a close relationship between the species of lab which develop during fermentation and the eventual quality of the wine. for these reasons analytical techniques allowing fast and reliable identification of wine lab are needed. in this work a simple and accurate protocol for identifying species of lab isolated from grape must and wine is presented. this protocol is based on the amplification, directly from colony, of 16s rdna and later digestion with one of the following restriction enzymes bfai, msei and alui. a sequential use of the three enzymes is proposed to simplify lab wine identification, first msei, then bfai and finally, if necessary, alui digestion. the technique was able to discriminate 32 of the 36 lab reference species tested and allowed the identification of 342 isolates from musts and wines. the isolates belonged to the species: lactobacillus brevis, l. collinoides, l. coryniformis, l. bilgardii, l.  mali, l. paracasei, leuconostoc mesenteroides, oenococcus oeni, pediococcus parvulus and p. pentosaceus.

TI  == proteolytic activities in togwa, a tanzanian fermented food.
AB  == proteolytic activities were investigated in sorghum-based togwa prepared by natural fermentation and using starter cultures previously isolated from the native product, i.e., lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus cellobiosus, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus plantarum, pediococcus pentosaceus, and issatchenkia orientalis in coculture with either l. brevis or l. plantarum. both  proteinase and aminopeptidase activities were substantially higher in naturally fermented togwa than in those with starters (14-30%, 12-70%, respectively). a variable but substantial part of the proteinase activity followed the particulate fraction of togwa; aminopeptidase activity was mainly in that fraction. the breakdown of relatively high molecular mass protein (64 kda) in togwa was detected by sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page); the products were mainly in the 14-30 kda range. reversed-phase fast-protein liquid chromatography (rp-fplc)-protein/peptide patterns changed during fermentation with some variation between togwa of different cultures. supplementation of gruel with malt increased the concentration of total protein [from 9.5% to 11.0% (w/w) on dry weight basis)] and of most of the free amino acids. fermentation had no effect on total protein content; however, the concentration of most of the amino acids was reduced, except for the proline content that increased. natural fermentation also increased the concentration of  glutamic acid and ornithine. fermentation by p. pentosaceus increased aspartic acid, while l. cellobiosus, l. fermentum, and l. brevis in coculture with i. orientalis increased the concentration of citrulline.

TI  == phylogenetic diversity of lactic acid bacteria associated with paddy rice silage  as determined by 16s ribosomal dna analysis.
AB  == a total of 161 low-g+c-content gram-positive bacteria isolated from whole-crop paddy rice silage were classified and subjected to phenotypic and genetic analyses. based on morphological and biochemical characters, these presumptive lactic acid bacterium (lab) isolates were divided into 10 groups that included members of the genera enterococcus, lactobacillus, lactococcus, leuconostoc, pediococcus, and weissella: analysis of the 16s ribosomal dna (rdna) was used to  confirm the presence of the predominant groups indicated by phenotypic analysis and to determine the phylogenetic affiliation of representative strains. the virtually complete 16s rrna gene was pcr amplified and sequenced. the sequences from the various lab isolates showed high degrees of similarity to those of the genbank reference strains (between 98.7 and 99.8%). phylogenetic trees based on the 16s rdna sequence displayed high consistency, with nodes supported by high bootstrap values. with the exception of one species, the genetic data was in agreement with the phenotypic identification. the prevalent lab, predominantly homofermentative (66%), consisted of lactobacillus plantarum (24%), lactococcus lactis (22%), leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides (20%), pediococcus acidilactici (11%), lactobacillus brevis (11%), enterococcus faecalis (7%), weissella kimchii  (3%), and pediococcus pentosaceus (2%). the present study, the first to fully document rice-associated lab, showed a very diverse community of lab with a relatively high number of species involved in the fermentation process of paddy rice silage. the comprehensive 16s rdna-based approach to describing lab community structure was valuable in revealing the large diversity of bacteria inhabiting paddy rice silage and enabling the future design of appropriate inoculants aimed at improving its fermentation quality.

AB  == a total of 241 lactic acid bacteria belonging to lactobacillus plantarum, pediococcus pentosaceus, lactobacillus fermentum/reuteri and lactobacillus brevis from various processing stages of maize dough fermentation were investigated. results indicated that each processing stage has its own microenvironment with strong antimicrobial activity. about half of the lact. plantarum and practically  all of the lact. fermentum/reuteri investigated were shown to inhibit other gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, explaining the elimination of these organisms during the initial processing stages. further, widespread microbial interactions amounting to 85% to 18% of all combinations tested were demonstrated amongst lactic acid bacteria within the various processing stages, i.e. raw material, steeping, 0 h and 48 h of fermentation, explaining the microbial succession taking place amongst lactic acid bacteria during fermentation. the antimicrobial effect was explained by the combined effect of acids, compounds sensitive to proteolytic enzymes and other compounds with antimicrobial activity  with the acid production being the most important factor. the pattern of antimicrobial factors was not species-specific and the safety and storage stability of fermented maize seem to depend on a mixed population of lactic acid  bacteria with different types of antimicrobial characteristics. this means that introduction of pure cultures as starters may impose a risk to the product.
