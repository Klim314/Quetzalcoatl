TI  == analysis of symptomatic and asymptomatic primary root canal infections in adult norwegian patients.
AB  == introduction: this molecular study analyzed the microbiota of primary root canal  infections from adult norwegian patients. methods: samples were taken from the necrotic root canals of teeth with symptomatic (n = 13) or asymptomatic (n = 21)  apical periodontitis and chronic apical abscesses (n = 9). dna was extracted from samples, and bacterial identifications were performed by a closed-ended reverse-capture checkerboard approach targeting 50 candidate endodontic pathogens. results: bacterial dna was detected in all cases. in teeth with asymptomatic apical periodontitis, the most frequent taxa were dialister invisus  (71%), fusobacterium nucleatum (62%), and porphyromonas endodontalis (62%). in chronic apical abscesses, the most prevalent taxa were p. endodontalis (100%), d. invisus (89%), parvimonas micra (78%), and solobacterium moorei (78%). in teeth with symptomatic apical periodontitis, the most prevalent taxa were d. invisus, p. endodontalis, s. moorei, propionibacterium acnes, and streptococcus species (all in 69%). none of the targeted taxa were significantly associated with either sinus tract or pain (p > .05), except for selenomonas sputigena, which was more frequently found in painful cases (p = .04). no taxa were found in significantly  higher levels in any conditions (p > .05). cluster analyses revealed bacterial groupings that differed between cases with and without pain. conclusions: although basically the same species were highly prevalent in the different conditions examined and none of the most prevalent taxa were positively associated with symptoms, results revealed that species formed different partnerships and associations in samples from teeth with or without pain. therefore, it is possible that more virulent multispecies communities can form as a result of overall bacterial combinations and give rise to acute inflammation.

TI  == comparison of the in vivo antimicrobial effectiveness of sodium hypochlorite and  chlorhexidine used as root canal irrigants: a molecular microbiology study.
AB  == introduction: the purpose of this clinical study was to compare the antimicrobial effects of 2.5% sodium hypochlorite (naocl) and 0.12% chlorhexidine digluconate (chx) when used as irrigants during treatment of teeth with apical periodontitis. methods: forty-seven single-rooted single-canal teeth with necrotic pulps and asymptomatic apical periodontitis were selected for this study according to stringent inclusion/exclusion criteria. bacterial samples were taken at the baseline (s1) and after (s2) chemomechanical preparation using 2.5% naocl (n = 30) or 0.12% chx (n = 17) as the irrigant. bacterial, archaeal, and fungal presence was evaluated by broad-range polymerase chain reaction (pcr), whereas bacterial identifications were performed by a closed-ended reverse-capture checkerboard approach targeting 28 candidate endodontic pathogens. results: all s1 samples were pcr positive for bacterial presence but negative for both archaea and fungi. both naocl- and chx-based protocols were significantly effective in reducing the bacterial levels and number of taxa. no significant differences were observed between them in all tested parameters including the incidence of negative pcr results in s2 (40% for naocl vs 47% for chx, p = 0.8), reduction in  the number of taxa per canal (p = 0.3), and reduction in the bacterial levels (p  = 0.07). the most prevalent taxa in s2 samples from the naocl group were propionibacterium acnes, streptococcus species, porphyromonas endodontalis, and selenomonas sputigena. in the chx group, the most prevalent taxa in s2 were dialister invisus, actinomyces israelii, prevotella baroniae, propionibacterium acidifaciens, and streptococcus species. conclusions: treatment protocols using irrigation with either naocl or chx succeeded in significantly reducing the the number of bacterial taxa and their levels in infected root canals, with no significant difference between these substances.

TI  == apical root canal microbiota as determined by reverse-capture checkerboard analysis of cryogenically ground root samples from teeth with apical periodontitis.
AB  == introduction: bacteria located in the apical root canal system potentially participate in the pathogenesis of apical periodontitis. detection and identification of apical bacteria can be compromised because of limitations in conventional sampling and identification procedures. this study identified several bacterial taxa in the apical and middle/coronal segments of primarily infected root canal system by using pulverized root segments and a culture-independent molecular method. methods: seventeen extracted teeth with attached apical periodontitis lesions were sectioned to obtain 2 root fragments (apical and middle/coronal segments). root fragments were cryogenically ground, and dna was extracted from samples. after multiple displacement amplification, dna from samples was used as template in a reverse-capture checkerboard hybridization assay targeting 28 bacterial taxa. results: bacterial dna was detected in all samples. the most prevalent taxa in the apical root canal system  were olsenella uli (76.5%), prevotella baroniae (71%), porphyromonas endodontalis (65%), fusobacterium nucleatum (53%), and tannerella forsythia (47%). o. uli, p.  endodontalis, and propionibacterium acnes were as frequently detected in apical samples as they were in middle/coronal samples. p. baroniae, t. forsythia, and f. nucleatum were found more frequently in the apical part of the canal as compared  with matched coronal segments. streptococcus species were more prevalent in middle/coronal samples. the median and mean of shared bacterial taxa between matched apical and middle/coronal segments were 27% and 41%, respectively. conclusions: several candidate endodontic pathogens were very prevalent in the apical root canal system. the apical microbiota was usually complex and differed  in species composition when compared with the microbiota of middle/coronal samples from the same tooth.

TI  == assessment of periradicular microbiota by dna-dna hybridization.
AB  == in the present study the "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridization technique was used  to identify bacteria in periapical endodontic lesions of asymptomatic teeth. thirty-four patients with root-filled teeth and apical periodontitis were divided into two groups, each containing 17 patients. in group 1, a marginal incision was performed during surgery to expose the lesion, and in group 2, a submarginal incision was applied. the gingiva and mucosa were swabbed with an 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate solution prior to surgery. bacterial dna was identified in all samples from the two groups using 40 different whole genomic probes. the mean number (+/- sd) of species detected was 33.7 +/- 3.3 in group 1 and 21.3 +/- 6.3 in group 2 (p < 0.001). the majority of the probe-detected bacteria were present in more lesions from group 1 than from group 2. the differences were most notable for campylobacter gracilis, porphyromonas endodontalis, propionibacterium acnes, capnocytophaga gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. nucleatum, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. polymorphum, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola, streptococcus constellatus and actinomyces naeslundii i. bacterial species such as actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and bacteroides forsythus were detected in more than 60% of the lesions from both groups. also, p. endodontalis was abundant in periapical tissue. the data supported the idea that  following a marginal incision, bacteria from the periodontal pocket might reach the underlying tissues by surgeon-released bacteremia. the study provided solid evidence that bacteria invade the periapical tissue of asymptomatic teeth with apical periodontitis. the detection of much more bacteria with the "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridization method than has previously been recovered by anaerobic culture indicated that the endodontic (and periodontal) microfloras should be redefined using molecular methods.
