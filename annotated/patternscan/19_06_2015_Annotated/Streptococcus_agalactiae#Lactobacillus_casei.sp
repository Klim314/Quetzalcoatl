TI  == microbial diversity, dynamics and activity throughout manufacturing and ripening  of castelmagno pdo cheese.
AB  == the diversity, dynamics and activity of castelmagno pdo cheese microbiota were studied in three batches produced in a floor valley farm, in the grana valley (northwest italy), during the wintertime. samples of milk, curd and cheese (core  and subsurface) at different ripening time were submitted to both culture-dependent and -independent analysis. in particular, dna and rna directly  extracted from the matrices were studied by pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) and reverse transcription (rt)-pcr-dgge. culture-dependent methods highlighted the initial dominance of a thermophilic streptococcal population with the species streptococcus thermophilus and s. agalactiae. then, mesophilic lactococci occurred among isolates during manufacturing, with lactococcus lactis which was also well represented in the first month of castelmagno pdo ripening. at this point and throughout the ripening, lactobacilli prevailed in cheese samples, represented from lactobacillus plantarum and lb. casei. culture-independent analysis underlined the undoubted role of l. lactis, actively involved in both castelmagno pdo manufacturing and ripening. despite lb. helveticus was never isolated on selective media, a dgge band referred to this microorganism was detected, at rna level, in samples from ripened cheeses. on the other hand, lb. plantarum was widely isolated from the plates, among lactobacilli, but never detected by direct analysis. due to the importance of microbiota in the sensory richness and properties of traditional cheeses, new information have been added, in this work, on microbial diversity of castelmagno  pdo cheese.

TI  == requirement of the lactobacillus casei maekr two-component system for l-malic acid utilization via a malic enzyme pathway.
AB  == lactobacillus casei can metabolize l-malic acid via malolactic enzyme (malolactic fermentation [mlf]) or malic enzyme (me). whereas utilization of l-malic acid via mlf does not support growth, the me pathway enables l. casei to grow on l-malic acid. in this work, we have identified in the genomes of l. casei strains bl23 and atcc 334 a cluster consisting of two diverging operons, maepe and maekr, encoding a putative malate transporter (maep), an me (maee), and a two-component  (tc) system belonging to the citrate family (maek and maer). homologous clusters  were identified in enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus uberis. our results show that me is essential for l-malic acid utilization in l. casei. furthermore, deletion of either the gene encoding the histidine kinase or the response regulator of the tc system resulted in the loss of the ability to grow on l-malic acid, thus indicating that the cognate tc system regulates and is essential for the expression of me. transcriptional analyses showed that expression of maee is induced in the presence of l-malic acid and repressed by glucose, whereas tc system expression was induced by l-malic acid and was not repressed by glucose. dnase i footprinting analysis showed that maer binds specifically to a set of direct repeats [5'-ttatt(a/t)aa-3'] in the mae promoter region. the location of the repeats strongly suggests that maer activates the expression of the diverging operons maepe and maekr where the first one is also subjected to carbon catabolite repression.

TI  == screening of lactic-acid bacteria from south african barley beer for the production of bacteriocin-like compounds.
AB  == strains of lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei (strain st11br), l. pentosus  (strain st151br), l. plantarum (strain st13br), and lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (strain st34br) producing bacteriocin-like peptides were isolated from barley beer produced in the western, northern and eastern provinces of south africa. the peptides (bacst11br, bacst151br, bacst13br and bacst34br) lost their  activity after treatment with proteinase k, a proteinase, papain, chymotrypsin, trypsin, pepsin and pronase, but not when they were treated with alpha-amylase, suggesting that the peptides are not glycosylated. the peptides inhibited the growth of lactobacillus casei, l. sakei, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli and enterococcus faecalis, but not enterobacter cloacae, lactobacillus bulgaricus subsp. delbrueckii, l. plantarum, l. salivarius, listeria innocua, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus uberis, s. agalactiae, s. caprinus and s. pneumoniae. peptides bacst11br and bacst13br differed from the other 2 peptides by failing to kill klebsiella pneumoniae and one of the e. coli strains. peptides were stable after 2 h of incubation at ph 2.0-12.0, and after 90 min at 100 degrees c. when autoclaved (121 degrees c, 20 min), only bacst13br lost its activity. the bacteriocin-like peptides were produced at a growth temperature of 30 degrees c,  but not at 37 degrees c.

TI  == effects of tamoxifen, melatonin, coenzyme q10, and l-carnitine supplementation on bacterial growth in the presence of mycotoxins.
AB  == the involvement of toxic oxygen intermediates in the bacteriostatic effects of mycotoxins (t-2 toxin, deoxynivalenol, ochratoxin a, aflatoxin b1, and fumonisin  b1) was investigated by producing bacterial growth curves using turbidimetry assays in the presence and absence of oxygen radical-scavenging substances. the strains used in this study included escherichia coli (ft 101), streptococcus agalactiae (ft 311, ft 313, ft 315), staphylococcus aureus (ft 192), yersinia enterocolitica (ft 430), salmonella infantis (ft 431), erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae (ft 432), lactobacillus plantarum (ft234) and lactobacillus casei (ft 232). tamoxifen, melatonin, l-carnitine and coenzyme q10 were used as radical scavengers against oxygen toxicity to the strains studied. tamoxifen was the most effective in inhibiting bacterial growth when used at a high concentration, whereas melatonin and l-carnitine were less effective. a combination of l-carnitine and coenzyme q10 provided better protection against oxygen toxicity caused by the mycotoxins growth than they did individually. it was concluded that oxygen radicals are involved in the killing of bacteria and that there is endogenous formation of toxic oxygen products by mycotoxins. the objective of this study was to determine whether the antioxidants were able to counteract the  toxic effects of the mycotoxins. the data obtained indicate that bacterial growth can be inhibited especially by t-2 toxin, aflatoxin b1 and ochratoxin a and that  this effect can be partially counteracted by antioxidants such as coenzyme q10 plus l-carnitine.
