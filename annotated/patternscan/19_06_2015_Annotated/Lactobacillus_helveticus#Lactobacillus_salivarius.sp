TI  == functional screening of antibiotic resistance genes from a representative metagenomic library of food fermenting microbiota.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) represent the predominant microbiota in fermented foods. foodborne lab have received increasing attention as potential reservoir of antibiotic resistance (ar) determinants, which may be horizontally transferred to opportunistic pathogens. we have previously reported isolation of ar lab from the raw ingredients of a fermented cheese, while ar genes could be detected in the final, marketed product only by pcr amplification, thus pointing at the need for  more sensitive microbial isolation techniques. we turned therefore to construction of a metagenomic library containing microbial dna extracted directly from the food matrix. to maximize yield and purity and to ensure that genomic complexity of the library was representative of the original bacterial population, we defined a suitable protocol for total dna extraction from cheese which can also be applied to other lipid-rich foods. functional library screening on different antibiotics allowed recovery of ampicillin and kanamycin resistant clones originating from streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and lactobacillus helveticus genomes. we report molecular characterization of the cloned inserts, which were fully sequenced and shown to confer ar phenotype to recipient bacteria. we also show that metagenomics can be applied to food microbiota to identify underrepresented species carrying specific genes of interest.

TI  == differential effects of lactobacilli on activation and maturation of mouse dendritic cells.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) are of interest because of their potential to modulate immune responses. the effects of lab range from regulation to stimulation of the  immune system. a series of studies were performed in vitro to study the effects of six lactic acid bacteria (lab), lactobacillus helveticus lh-2, lactobacillus acidophilus la-5, la-115, la-116 and la-14, and lactobacillus salivarius, on maturation and activation of mouse dendritic cells. production of tumour necrosis factor (tnf)-?, interleukin (il)-6 and il-10 by dendritic cells (dcs) was determined after treating cells with live lab. the expression of dc maturation markers, cd80 and cd40, was also measured using flow cytometry after stimulation  with lab. in addition, the expression of toll-like receptors (tlrs) 2, 4 and 9 by dcs stimulated with lab was measured. our results revealed that lab act differentially on pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokine production and  induction of co-stimulatory molecules by dcs. specifically, l. salivarius was found to be the most effective lab to induce pro-inflammatory cytokine production and expression of co-stimulatory molecules. moreover, la-14, la-116 and la-5 induced moderate maturation and activation of dcs. on the other hand, lh-2 and la-115 were the least effective lactobacilli to induce dc responses. the present  study also revealed that l. salivarius was able to induce the expression of tlr2, 4 and 9 by dcs. in conclusion, various strains and species of lab can differentially regulate dc activation and maturation, providing further evidence  that these bacteria may have the ability to influence and steer immune responses  in vivo.

TI  == probiotic gut effect prevents the chronic psychological stress-induced brain activity abnormality in mice.
AB  == background: a probiotic formulation (lactobacillus helveticus r0052 and bifidobacterium longum r0175 combination, probio'stick((r)) ) displays anxiolytic-like activity and reduces apoptosis in the lymbic system in animal models of depression. based on the hypothesis that modulation of gut microbiota by this probiotic formulation has beneficial effects on brain activity in stress  conditions, we report a set of probiotic-evoked physiological, cellular, and molecular events in the brain of probio'stick((r)) pretreated mice submitted to chronic psychological stress. methods: water avoidance stress (was) was applied or not (sham). hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (hpa) axis and autonomic nervous system (ans) responses to the chronic stress were assessed through plasma corticosterone and catecholamine measurements. specific markers for neuronal activity, neurogenesis, and synaptic plasticity were used to assess brain activity. in addition, gut permeability and tight junction (tj) proteins levels were also determinated. key results: we observed that a pretreatment with the probiotic formulation attenuated hpa axis and ans activities in response to was,  and reduced cfos expression in different brain areas but lactobacillus salivarius (a negative control) treatment was ineffective on these parameters. moreover, probiotic pretreatment prevented the was-induced decrease hippocampal neurogenesis and expression changes in hypothalamic genes involved in synaptic plasticity. these central effects were associated with restoration of tj barrier  integrity in stressed mice. conclusions & inferences: these data suggest that chronic stress-induced abnormal brain plasticity and reduction in neurogenesis can be prevented by a pretreatment with the probio'stick((r)) formulation, suggesting that probiotics modulate neuroregulatory factors and various signaling pathways in the central nervous system involved in stress response.

TI  == screening for lactic acid bacteria capable of inhibiting campylobacter jejuni in  in vitro simulations of the broiler chicken caecal environment.
AB  == thermotolerant campylobacter spp., specifically campylobacter jejuni and campylobacter coli, are the most common bacterial causes of human gastroenteritis in developed countries. consumption of improperly prepared poultry products and cross contamination are among the main causes of human campylobacteriosis. the aim of this study was to identify lactic acid bacterial (lab) strains capable of  inhibiting c. jejuni growth in initial in vitro trials ('spot-on-lawn' method), as well as in batch fermentation studies mimicking the broiler caecal environment. these experiments served as an indication for using these strains to decrease the capability of campylobacter to colonise and grow in the chicken caeca during primary production, with the aim of reducing the number of human campylobacteriosis cases. a total of 1,150 lab strains were screened for anti-campylobacter activity. six strains were selected: members of the species lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus agilis, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus salivarius, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium. after treatment with catalase, proteinase k and a-chymotrypsin, anti-campylobacter activity of cell-free culture supernatant fluid (csf) for all six strains was retained, which indicated that activity was probably not exerted by bacteriocin production. based on the activity found in csf, the compounds produced by the selected strains are secreted and do not require presence of live bacterial producer cells for activity. during initial in vitro fermentation experiments, the e. faecalis strain exhibited the highest inhibitory activity for c. jejuni and was selected for further fermentation experiments. in these experiments we tested for therapeutic or protective effects of the e. faecalis strain against c. jejuni mb 4185 infection under simulated broiler caecal growth conditions. the best inhibition results were obtained when e. faecalis was inoculated before the  c. jejuni strain, lowering c. jejuni counts at least one log compared to a positive control. this effect was already observed 6 h after c. jejuni inoculation.

TI  == in vitro functional and immunomodulatory properties of the lactobacillus helveticus mimlh5-streptococcus salivarius st3 association that are relevant to the development of a pharyngeal probiotic product.
AB  == the use of proper bacterial strains as probiotics for the pharyngeal mucosa is a  potential prophylactic strategy for upper respiratory tract infections. in this context, we characterized in vitro the functional and immunomodulatory properties of the strains lactobacillus helveticus mimlh5 and streptococcus salivarius st3 that were selected during previous investigations as promising pharyngeal probiotics. in this study, we demonstrated in vitro that strains mimlh5 and st3,  alone and in combination, can efficiently adhere to pharyngeal epithelial cells,  antagonize streptococcus pyogenes, and modulate host innate immunity by inducing  potentially protective effects. in particular, we found that the strains mimlh5 and st3 activate u937 human macrophages by significantly inducing the expression  of the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha). nonetheless, the induction of the anti-inflammatory interleukin-10 (il-10) by mimlh5 or st3 was never lower than that of tnf-alpha, suggesting that these bacteria can potentially exert a regulatory rather than a proinflammatory effect. we also found that the strains mimlh5 and st3 induce cyclooxygenase 2 (cox-2) expression and demonstrated that toll-like receptor 2 (tlr-2) participates in the recognition of the strains mimlh5 and st3 by u937 cells. finally, we observed that these microorganisms grow efficiently when cocultured in milk, suggesting that the preparation of a milk-based fermented product containing both mimlh5 and st3 can be a practical solution for the administration of these bacteria. in conclusion, we propose the combined use of l. helveticus mimlh5 and s. salivarius st3 for the preparation of novel products that display probiotic properties for the pharyngeal mucosa.

TI  == phylogenomic reconstruction of lactic acid bacteria: an update.
AB  == background: lactic acid bacteria (lab) are important in the food industry for the production of fermented food products and in human health as commensals in the gut. however, the phylogenetic relationships among lab species remain under intensive debate owing to disagreements among different data sets. results: we performed a phylogenetic analysis of lab species based on 232 genes from 28 lab genome sequences. regardless of the tree-building methods used, combined analyses yielded an identical, well-resolved tree topology with strong supports for all nodes. the lab species examined were divided into two groups. group 1 included families enterococcaceae and streptococcaceae. group 2 included families lactobacillaceae and leuconostocaceae. within group 2, the lab species were divided into two clades. one clade comprised of the acidophilus complex of genus  lactobacillus and two other species, lb. sakei and lb. casei. in the acidophilus  complex, lb. delbrueckii separated first, while lb. acidophilus/lb. helveticus and lb. gasseri/lb. johnsonii were clustered into a sister group. the other clade within group 2 consisted of the salivarius subgroup, including five species, lb.  salivarius, lb. plantarum, lb. brevis, lb. reuteri, lb. fermentum, and the genera pediococcus, oenococcus, and leuconostoc. in this clade, lb. salivarius was positioned most basally, followed by two clusters, one corresponding to lb. plantarum/lb. brevis pair and pediococcus, and the other including oenococcus/leuconostoc pair and lb. reuteri/lb. fermentum pair. in addition, phylogenetic utility of the 232 genes was analyzed to identify those that may be  more useful than others. the genes identified as useful were related to translation and ribosomal structure and biogenesis (trsb), and a three-gene set comprising genes encoding ultra-violet resistance protein b (uvrb), dna polymerase iii (polc) and penicillin binding protein 2b (pbpb). conclusions: our  phylogenomic analyses provide important insights into the evolution and diversification of lab species, and also revealed the phylogenetic utility of several genes. we infer that the occurrence of multiple, independent adaptation events in lab species, have resulted in their occupation of various habitats. further analyses of more genes from additional, representative lab species are needed to reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying adaptation of lab species to various environmental niches.

TI  == probiotic colonization of the adherent mucus layer of ht29mtxe12 cells attenuates campylobacter jejuni virulence properties.
AB  == the ht29mtxe12 (e12) cell line harbors an adherent mucus layer, providing a novel technique to model mucosal infection in vitro. in this study, we have characterized the interaction of campylobacter jejuni with the e12 cell line and  exploited its unique mucus layer to examine the potential efficacy of probiotic treatment to attenuate c. jejuni virulence properties. c. jejuni 81-176 colonized and reproduced in e12 mucus. adhesion to and internalization of c. jejuni were enhanced in e12 cells harboring mucus compared to parental cells without mucus. translocation of c. jejuni occurred at early time points following infection. c.  jejuni aligned with tight junctions and colocalized with the tight junction protein occludin, suggesting a paracellular route of translocation. probiotic strains lactobacillus rhamnosus r0011, lactobacillus helveticus r0052, lactobacillus salivarius ah102, bifidobacterium longum ah1205, a commercial combination of l. rhamnosus r0011 and l. helveticus r0052 (lacidofil), and a cocktail consisting of l. rhamnosus, l. helveticus, and l. salivarius (rhhesa) colonized e12 mucus and bound to underlying cells. probiotics attenuated c. jejuni association with and internalization into e12 cells and translocation to the basolateral medium of transwells. live bacteria and prolonged precolonization of e12 cells with probiotics were necessary for probiotic action. these results demonstrate the potential for e12 cells as a model of mucosal pathogenesis and provide a rationale for the further investigation of probiotics as prophylaxis against human campylobacteriosis.

TI  == main microorganisms involved in the fermentation of ugandan ghee.
AB  == ghee is widely produced from a traditional fermented butter-like product named mashita in western uganda. however, no detailed studies have been done to identify the microorganisms involved in mashita fermentation. the aim of this study was to identify the microorganisms present at the end of mashita ripening using culture-dependent and culture-independent techniques. the most commonly identified species of lactic acid bacteria (lab) in mashita using culture-dependent techniques were lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus perolens constituting 37.3%, 10.1%, 8.1% and 7.7% of total bacterial colonies isolated respectively. l. paracasei was the only bacterial species identified in all mashita samples by culture-dependent technique. two of the four most commonly isolated lab species (l. helveticus and l. plantarum) were also identified in mashita by a culture-independent method (pcr-dgge). other main lab species identified in mashita by pcr-dgge were bifidobacterium sp., enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus acetotolerans, lactobacillus sp., lactococcus raffinolactis, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and streptococcus salivarius. the main species of acetic acid bacteria (aab) identified in the mashita using pcr-dgge method were acetobacter aceti, acetobacter lovaniensis, acetobacter orientalis and acetobacter pasteurianus. pcr-dgge identification of yeasts showed that brettanomyces custersianus, candida silvae, geotrichum sp., issatchenkia occidentalis, issatchenkia orientalis, kluyveromyces marxianus, saccharomyces cerevisiae, and trichosporon asahii were main yeast species in mashita. a. lovaniensis, a. aceti, and i. orientalis were identified in all the six mashita samples analyzed using pcr-dgge method. other microbial species were only found in some samples. these results indicate that lab and yeasts, as in similar fermentation products, but also aab are main microbial groups involved in mashita fermentation.

TI  == evaluation in vitro of the antagonistic substances produced by lactobacillus spp. isolated from chickens.
AB  == to determine the inhibitory capacity of lactic acid bacteria due to the action of antagonistic substances, we tested 474 isolates of lactobacillus from the crop and cecum of chickens against gram-positive and gram-negative indicator microorganisms by the spot-on-the-lawn and well-diffusion antagonism methods. of  the 474 isolates, 265 demonstrated antimicrobial activity against the indicator microorganisms. isolates identified as l. reuteri, l. salivarius, or lactobacillus spp. inhibited enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium, listeria monocytogenes, and salmonella spp. but not l. casei, l. delbrueckii, l. fermentum, or l. helveticus by the well-diffusion simultaneous antagonism method  under anaerobic incubation conditions. the antagonistic substances produced by some of the lactobacillus isolates were inactivated after treatment by proteolytic enzymes, which suggested that the substances could be antimicrobial peptides or bacteriocins.

TI  == diversity and mechanisms of alkali tolerance in lactobacilli.
AB  == we determined the maximum ph that allows growth (phmax) for 34 strains of lactobacilli. high alkali tolerance was exhibited by strains of lactobacillus casei, l. paracasei subsp. tolerans, l. paracasei subsp. paracasei, l. curvatus,  l. pentosus, and l. plantarum that originated from plant material, with phmax values between 8.5 and 8.9. among these, l. casei nric 1917 and l. paracasei subsp. tolerans nric 1940 showed the highest phmax, at 8.9. digestive tract isolates of l. gasseri, l. johnsonii, l. reuteri, l. salivarius subsp. salicinius, and l. salivarius subsp. salivarius exhibited moderate alkali tolerance, with phmax values between 8.1 and 8.5. dairy isolates of l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, l. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, and l. helveticus exhibited no alkali tolerance, with phmax values between 6.7 and 7.1. measurement of the internal ph of representative strains revealed the formation of transmembrane proton gradients (deltaph) in a reversed direction (i.e., acidic interior) at alkaline external-ph ranges, regardless of their degrees of alkali tolerance. thus, the reversed deltaph did not determine alkali tolerance diversity. however, the deltaph contributed to alkali tolerance, as the phmax values of several strains decreased with the addition of nigericin, which dissipates deltaph. although neutral external-ph values resulted in the highest glycolysis activity in the presence of nigericin regardless of alkali tolerance,  substantial glucose utilization was still detected in the alkali-tolerant strains, even in a ph range of between 8.0 and 8.5, at which the remaining strains lost most activity. therefore, the alkali tolerance of glycolysis reactions contributes greatly to the determination of alkali tolerance diversity.

TI  == characterization of lactic acid bacteria isolated from the one humped camel milk  produced in morocco.
AB  == one hundred and twenty (120) strains of lactic acid bacteria (lab) were enumerated and isolated from raw dromedary milk in morocco using various cultured media. strains isolated were characterized by phenotypic, physiological and biochemical properties. results showed that high counts of lab were found. presumptive lactobacilli counts ranged from 2.5x10(2) to 6x10(7)cfu/ml, presumptive lactococci levels varied from 5x10(2) to 6x10(7)cfu/ml, presumptive streptococci counts varied from 4.2x10(2) to 8x10(7)cfu/ml, presumptive leuconostoc levels ranged from 5.4x10(2) to 5.4x10(7)cfu/ml. results showed also  that lactobacillus and lactococcus were the predominant genera with 37.5% and 25.8%, respectively. the dominated species found were lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (17.5%), lactobacillus helveticus (10%), streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus (9.20%), lactobacillus casei subsp. casei (5.80%) and lactobacillus  plantarum (5%). this is the first report on the characterization of lab strains isolated from the one humped camel milk produced in morocco.

TI  == survey of bacterial proteins released in cheese: a proteomic approach.
AB  == during the ripening of emmental cheese, the bacterial ecosystem confers its organoleptic characteristics to the evolving curd both by the action of the living cells, and through the release of numerous proteins, including various types of enzymes into the cheese when the cells lyse. in emmental cheese these proteins can be released from thermophilic lactic acid bacteria used as starters  like lactobacillus helveticus, lb delbruecki subsp. lactis and streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and ripening bacteria such as propionibacterium freudenreichii. the aim of this study was to obtain a proteomic view of the different groups of proteins within the cheese using proteomic tools to create a  reference map. a methodology was therefore developed to reduce the complexity of  cheese matrix prior to 2d-page analysis. the aqueous phase of cheese was prefractionated by size exclusion chromatography, bacterial and milk proteins were separated and subsequently characterised by mass spectrometry, prior to peptide mass fingerprint and sequence homology database search. five functional groups of proteins were identified involved in: (i) proteolysis, (ii) glycolysis, (iii) stress response, (iv) dna and rna repair and (v) oxidoreduction. the results revealed stress responses triggered by thermophilic lactic acid bacteria  and propionibacterium strains at the end of ripening. information was also obtained regarding the origin and nature of the peptidases released into the cheese, thus providing a greater understanding of casein degradation mechanisms during ripening. different peptidases arose from st thermophilus and lb helveticus, suggesting that streptococci are involved in peptide degradation in addition to the proteolytic activity of lactobacilli.

TI  == changes in galactose and lactic acid content of sweet whey during storage.
AB  == whey is often stored or transported for a period of time prior to processing. during this time period, galactose and lactic acid concentrations may accumulate, reducing the quality of spray-dried whey powders in regard to stickiness and agglomeration. this study surveyed industry samples of cheddar and mozzarella cheese whey streams to determine how galactose and lactic acid concentrations changed with storage at appropriate (4 degrees c) and abuse (37.8 degrees c) temperatures. samples stored at 4 degrees c did not exhibit significant increases in levels of lactic acid or galactose. mozzarella whey accumulated the greatest amount of galactose and lactic acid with storage at 37.8 degrees c. whey samples  derived from cheese made from single strains of starter culture were also evaluated to determine each culture's contribution to galactose and lactic acid production. starter cultures evaluated included streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus. lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris, and lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis. whey derived from l. helveticus accumulated a significantly greater amount of lactic acid upon storage at 37.8 degrees c as compared with the other cultures. galactose accumulation was significantly decreased in whey from l. lactis ssp. lactis stored at 37.8 degrees c in comparison with the other cultures. results from this study indicate that proper storage conditions (4 degrees c) for whey prevent accumulation of galactose and lactic acid while the extent of accumulation during storage at 37.8 degrees c varies depending on the culture(s)  used in cheese production.

TI  == the lysins of bacteriophages infecting lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == this short review highlights the complete absence of literature on lysins of bacteriophages infecting species like s. salivarius subsp. thermophilus, pediococcus and leuconostoc species, l. helveticus, l. acidophilus, l. plantarum  and l. brevis, which are also widely used in the dairy industry. the lysins described share some similar biochemical characteristics: optimal ph and temperature, site of hydrolysis inside the peptidoglycan, and some activators and inhibitors. the cloning of the genes encoding these lysins only began in the last few years and four of them have been completely sequenced. in the future, these lysin genes could be interestingly compared to the host autolysin(s) gene(s). by  contrast, the passage of phage lysins through the cytoplasmic membrane of the host cell in order to reach the peptidoglycan (via a signal sequence or the presence of a holin) seems not to be clearly resolved. the presence of a second open-reading frame upstream from the gene of the lysin, enabling a putative holin to be encoded, has already been suggested. no doubt our ever increasing knowledge about bacteriophage genome organization will help to elucidate this question. meanwhile the obtention of a lactococcus strain with an autolytic phenotype, using a bacteriophage lysin gene, as well as the successful use of purified pl1 lysin to obtain protoplasts of l. casei encourage us to continue to explore the field of bacteriophage lysins.

TI  == antimutagenicity of fermented milk.
AB  == reconstituted nonfat dry milk was fermented by lactobacillus helveticus ch65, lactobacillus acidophilus bg2fo4, streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus ch3, lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus 191r, and by a mixture of the latter two organisms. the fermented milks were then freeze-dried, extracted in acetone,  dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide, and assayed for antimutagenicity in the ames test (salmonella typhimurium ta 100) against n-methyl, n'-nitro, n-nitroso-guanidine,  and 3,2'-dimethyl-4-amino-biphenyl. dose-dependent activity was significant against both mutagens in all extracts. maximal inhibitory activity against 3,2'-dimethyl-4-aminobiphenyl and n-methyl, n'-nitro, n-nitroso-guanidine was 2-  and 2.7-fold greater, respectively, than that exhibited by extracts of unfermented milk. extracts of milk fermented by l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus 191r were examined further. compounds that were responsible for activity against  both mutagens were less soluble in aqueous solutions than in dimethylsulfoxide. adjustment of milk fermented by l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus 191r to ph 3, 7.6, or 13 prior to freeze-drying and acetone extraction did not significantly alter the activity specific for 3,2'-dimethyl-4-aminobiphenyl. in contrast, compounds with activity specific for n-methyl, n'-nitro, n-nitrosoguanidine were less extractable at ph 7.6. the weak antimutagenicity of unfermented milk was not increased by addition of 2% l-lactic acid.

TI  == an introduction to rod-shaped lactic-acid bacteria.
AB  == the genus lactobacillus is mainly found in the intestinal tract of healthy humans and animals as well as in fermenting vegetables or plant materials, such as silage. it has a moderate diffusion in meat products and is rarely found in wines and beers. on the other hand, rod-shaped lactic-acid bacteria are largely used in the preparation of a variety of foods and feed products. as starter cultures, they are omnipresent in cheeses and dairy manufacturing. specific fermentation processes have been developed in order to encourage the growth of the desired species, some of which are fastidious organisms such as l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, l. helveticus and l. sanfrancisco. in addition, a promising and interesting perspective is the use of rod-shaped lactic-acid bacteria, primarily  l. acidophilus, l. reuteri and l. salivarius as probiotic starters to preserve the natural biological equilibrium of the intestinal tract.

TI  == nucleic acids of species of lactobacillus.
AB  == nucleic acid composition of 17 cultures representing the type or neotype strains  of 15 named lactobacillus species was studied. nucleic acid characterization of these isolates was accompanied by a comparative study of conventional phenotypic  reactions. the overall guanine plus cytosine mean deoxyribonucleic acid base composition ranged from 33 to 50% and genome sizes varied between 700 and 1500 x  10(6) daltons. sporolactobacillus inulinus contained 2500 x 10(6) daltons of chromosomal deoxyribonucleic acid and was therefore similar in size to members of the genus bacillus. deoxyribonucleic acid hybridization at a temperature 15 degrees c below the thermal melting temperature confirmed the extreme molecular heterogeneity of many species. the genus can be divided into three major groups,  each containing four or more species based on a combination of nucleic acid characteristics and conventional phenotypic reactions. group i (33 to 39% guanine plus cytosine) contains lactobacillus jensenii, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus helveticus nov. ssp. jugurt, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus salivarius, and lactobacillus sanfrancisco. group ii (42 to 48% guanine plus cytosine contains lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus,  lactobacillus casei, and lactobacillus brevis, and group iii (48 to 50% guanine plus cytosine) contains lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus delbrueckii nov. ssp. bulgaricus, lactobacillus delbrueckii nov. ssp. lactis, lactobacillus delbrueckii nov. ssp. leichmanii, lactobacillus fermentum, and lactobacillus fermentum nov. ssp. cellobiosis.
