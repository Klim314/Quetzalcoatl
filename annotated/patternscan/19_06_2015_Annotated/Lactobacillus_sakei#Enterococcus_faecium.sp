TI  == in vitro protective effect of lactic acid bacteria on listeria monocytogenes adhesion and invasion of caco-2 cells.
AB  == the adhesion of listeria monocytogenes to intestinal endothelial cells is a crucial step in the infection process, which is not well understood. in this study, we evaluated the potential ability of bacteriocin-producing enterococcus faecium, leuconostoc mesenteroides and lactobacillus sakei strains to prevent the adhesion and invasion of eukaryotic cells by ten different l. monocytogenes isolates. the results showed that e. faecium 130 co-cultured with l. monocytogenes was the most effective in preventing infection of caco-2 cells, as  the vast majority of isolates showed significantly lower adhesion counts and invasion rates below the quantification limit of the method (<30 cfu/plate). l. sakei 1 was the least effective strain in preventing l. monocytogenes infection;  only one isolate presented a lower adhesion rate and two isolates reduced the invasion rate of caco-2 cells. fluorescence in situ hybridisation (fish) assay was shown to be an effective tool to illustrate and identify species in co-culture with l. monocytogenes during the adhesion process to caco-2 cells.

TI  == potentially probiotic and bioprotective lactic acid bacteria starter cultures antagonise the listeria monocytogenes adhesion to ht29 colonocyte-like cells.
AB  == the capability of five lactic acid bacteria (lab) to counteract the adhesion of listeria monocytogenes to the epithelial intestinal cell line ht29 was studied. the highest adhesion ability to ht29 was achieved by the intestinal strain lactobacillus rhamnosus ctc1679, followed by the meat-derived strains lactobacillus sakei ctc494 and enterococcus faecium ctc8005. surprisingly, the meat strains showed significantly better adhesion to ht29 than two faecal isolates of lactobacillus casei and even significantly higher than the reference  strain l. rhamnosus gg. additionally, the anti-listerial, bacteriocin-producer starter culture l. sakei ctc494 was able to significantly reduce the adhesion of  l. monocytogenes to ht29 in experiments of exclusion, competition and inhibition. the performance was better than the faecal isolate l. rhamnosus ctc1679. our results reinforce the fact that the ability of lab to interact with a host epithelium model, as well as to antagonise with foodborne pathogens, is a strain-specific characteristic. additionally, it is underlined that this trait is not dependent on the origin of the bacterium, since some food lab behave better than intestinal ones. therefore, the search for novel strains in food niches is a suitable approach to find those with potential health benefits. these strains are likely pre-adapted to the food environment, which would make their inclusion in the formulation of probiotic foods more feasible.

TI  == in vitro study of beneficial properties and safety of lactic acid bacteria isolated from portuguese fermented meat products.
AB  == many lactic acid bacteria produce bacteriocins with a rather broad spectrum of inhibition, which could offer potential applications in food preservation. bacteriocin production by starter cultures may bring advantage to these strains in competitive interactions with pathogenic bacteria from the food matrix. the objective of this study was to determine the safety of beneficial strains (lactobacillus plantarum st202ch and st216ch, enterococcus faecium st211ch, and lactobacillus sakei st22ch, st153ch and st154ch) previously isolated from fermented meat products and characterised as bacteriocin producers. auto-aggregation was strain-specific, and values of 28.97, 27.86 and 28.56% were  recorded for l. sakei st22ch, st153ch and st154ch, respectively, 16.95 and 14.58% for l. plantarum st202ch and st216ch, respectively, and 12.77% for e. faecium st211ch. various degrees of co-aggregation between 28.85 and 44.76% for listeria  monocytogenes 211 and 409, and between 23.60 to 34.96% for e. faecium atcc 19443  were observed. according to the results of the diffusion method, the studied strains demonstrated susceptibility to penicillin g, ampicillin, amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulonic acid, imipenem, linezolid, and tetracycline. in addition,  the susceptibility of the six strains to various non-antibiotic commercial drugs  was examined. production of beta-galactosidase by l. sakei st22ch, st153ch and st154ch, l. plantarum st202ch and st216ch, and e. faecium st211ch was confirmed by employing sterile filter paper discs impregnated with o-nitrophenyl-beta-d-galactopyranose. a statistically significant (p<0.001) inhibition of mycobacterium tuberculosis growth by bacteriocins produced by l. plantarum st202ch (38.3%) and st216ch (48.6%), l. sakei st153ch (16.2%) and st154ch (16.1%), and e. faecium st211ch (21.7%) was observed. as determined by the polymerase chain reaction, the tested strains showed a low virulence gene profile.

TI  == technological and safety properties of lactic acid bacteria isolated from spanish dry-cured sausages.
AB  == technological and safety-related properties were analyzed in lactic acid bacteria isolated from spanish dry-cured sausages in order to select them as starter cultures. in relation to technological properties, all the strains showed significative nitrate reductase activity; lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus  paracasei and 52% of the enterococcus faecium strains showed lipolytic activity and only lactobacillus sakei strains (43%) were able to form biofilms. related to safety aspects, e. faecium strains were the most resistant to antibiotics, whereas, l. sakei strains were the most sensitive. in relation to virulence factors, in the e. faecium strains analyzed, only the presence of efaa gene was detected. the analysis of biogenic amine production showed that most e. faecium strains and l. sakei al-142 produced tyramine. in conclusion, l. paracasei al-128 and l. sakei al-143 strains possess the best properties to be selected as adequate and safe meat starter cultures.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin-producing lactic acid bacteria isolated from cheeses and yogurts.
AB  == the biopreservation of foods using bacteriocinogenic lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated directly from foods is an innovative approach. the objectives of this study were to isolate and identify bacteriocinogenic lab from various cheeses and yogurts and evaluate their antimicrobial effects on selected spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms in vitro as well as on a food commodity.lab were isolated using mrs and m17 media. the agar diffusion bioassay was used to screen  for bacteriocin or bacteriocin-like substances (bls) producing lab using lactobacillus sakei and listeria innocua as indicator organisms. out of 138 lab isolates, 28 were found to inhibit these bacteria and were identified as strains  of enterococcus faecium, streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus sakei subsp. sakei using 16s rrna gene sequencing. eight isolates were tested for antimicrobial activity at 5 degrees c and 20 degrees c against l. innocua, escherichia coli, bacillus cereus, pseudomonas fluorescens, erwinia carotovora, and leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides using the agar diffusion bioassay, and also against penicillium expansum, botrytis cinerea and monilinia frucitcola using the microdilution plate method. the effect of selected lab strains on l. innocua inoculated onto fresh-cut onions was also investigated.twenty percent of our isolates produced bls inhibiting the growth of l. innocua and/or lact. sakei. organic acids and/or h2o2 produced by lab and not  the bls had strong antimicrobial effects on all microorganisms tested with the exception of e. coli. ent. faecium, strep. thermophilus and lact. casei effectively inhibited the growth of natural microflora and l. innocua inoculated  onto fresh-cut onions. bacteriocinogenic lab present in cheeses and yogurts may have potential to be used as biopreservatives in foods.

TI  == application of bacteriocinogenic enterococcus mundtii crl35 and enterococcus faecium st88ch in the control of listeria monocytogenes in fresh minas cheese.
AB  == several strains of enterococcus spp. are capable of producing bacteriocins with antimicrobial activity against important bacterial pathogens in dairy products. in this study, the bacteriocins produced by two enterococcus strains (enterococcus mundtii crl35 and enterococcus faecium st88ch), isolated from cheeses, were characterized and tested for their capability to control growth of  listeria monocytogenes 426 in experimentally contaminated fresh minas cheese during refrigerated storage. both strains were active against a variety of pathogenic and non-pathogenic microorganisms and bacteriocin absorption to various l. monocytogenes, enterococcus faecalis atcc 19443 and lactobacillus sakei atcc 15521 varied according to the strain and the testing conditions (ph, temperature, presence of salts and surfactants). growth of l. monocytogenes 426 was inhibited in cheeses containing e. mundtii crl35 up to 12 days at 8 degrees c, evidencing a bacteriostatic effect. e. faecium st88ch was less effective, as the bacteriostatic affect occurred only after 6 days at 8 degrees c. in cheeses containing nisin (12.5 mg/kg), less than one log reduction was observed. this research underlines the potential application of e. mundtii crl35 in the control  of l. monocytogenes in minas cheese.

TI  == purification and characterization of multiple bacteriocins and an inducing peptide produced by enterococcus faecium nkr-5-3 from thai fermented fish.
AB  == enterocins nkr-5-3a, b, c, and d were purified from the culture supernatant of enterococcus faecium nkr-5-3 and characterized. among the four purified peptides, enterocin nkr-5-3a (5242.3 da) was identical to brochocin a, produced by brochothrix campestris atcc 43754, in mature peptides, and its putative synergistic peptide, enterocin nkr-5-3z, was found to be encoded in ent53z downstream of ent53a, encoding enterocin nkr-5-3a. enterocin nkr-5-3b (6316.4 da) showed a broad antimicrobial spectrum, and enterocin nkr-5-3c (4512.8 da) showed  high activity against listeria. enterocin nkr-5-3d (2843.5 da), showing high homology to an inducing peptide produced by lactobacillus sakei 5, induced the production of the enterocins. the enterocins showed different antimicrobial spectra and intensities. e. faecium nkr-5-3 concomitantly produced enterocins nkr-5-3a, b, c, and d which probably belong to different classes of bacteriocins. furthermore, nkr-5-3 production was induced by enterocin nkr-5-3d.

TI  == polyphasic taxonomic studies of lactic acid bacteria associated with tunisian fermented meat based on the heterogeneity of the 16s-23s rrna gene intergenic spacer region.
AB  == the objective of this work was to investigate the structure and diversity of lactic acid bacteria (lab) communities in traditionally fermented meat collected  from different areas of tunisia. a polyphasic study, which involves phenotypic tests and ribosomal dna-based techniques, was used to identify gram-positive and  catalase-negative isolates. pcr amplification of the 16s-23s rdna isr of 102 isolates and other reference lab strains gave (1) one type of rrn operon (m-isr)  for lactococci, (2) two types of rrn operon (s-isr and m-isr) for enterococci, (3) two types of rrn operon (s-isr and l-isr) for lactobacilli, and (4) three pcr amplicons (s-isr, m-isr, and l-isr) obtained for pediococcus spp. and weissella genus. the clustering and comparison of isr-rflp profiles given by the isolates with those given by reference lab strains, allowed their identification as lactococcus lactis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus sanguinicola, enterococcus hawaiiensis, lactobacillus sakei, lactobacillus curvatus, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus alimentarius, pediococcus pentosaceus, and weissella confusa. combined 16s-23s rdna isr and rflp patterns can be considered as a good potential target for a rapid and reliable differentiation between isolates of lab and provided further information on the organization of their rrn operons.

TI  == inhibition of uropathogens by lactic acid bacteria isolated from dairy foods and  cow's intestine in western nigeria.
AB  == a total of 96 lactic acid bacteria (lab) were isolated from african indigenous fermented products and cow's intestines to study their inhibitory capability against multi-drug-resistant uropathogens. escherichia coli accounted for approximately 45% of isolated uropathogens, followed by staphylococcus spp. (20%). the gram negative uropathogens were highly resistant to quinolones, co-trimoxazole, teicoplanin and some beta-lactams, while the staphylococcus spp.  showed high resistance to aminoglycosides, beta-lactams and macrolides. twenty-four lab isolates were selected based on their antimicrobial activity against two uropathogenic staphylococcus aureus strains and bacteriocin production. lab strains showing antimicrobial activity were grouped into smaller  groups through amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis (ardra). representative strains were identified as weissella spp., enterococcus faecium, lactococcus lactis and lactobacillus brevis through sequencing of 16s rdna. the weissella spp. and l. brevis strains demonstrated remarkable inhibitory activity  against seven strains of gram negative uropathogens. two strains of l. lactis produced a bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance active against lactobacillus sakei. in this study, an unusual high rate of co-trimoxazole, quinolones and macrolides resistance among uropathogens from south west nigeria was discovered.  based on their sensitivity to weissella spp., there is a potential for using these lab as a natural approach for the protection against the uropathogens assayed.

TI  == complete sequence of the enterocin q-encoding plasmid pciz2 from the multiple bacteriocin producer enterococcus faecium l50 and genetic characterization of enterocin q production and immunity.
AB  == the locations of the genetic determinants for enterocin l50 (entl50a and entl50b), enterocin q (entq), and enterocin p (entp) in the multiple bacteriocin  producer enterococcus faecium strain l50 were determined. these bacteriocin genes occur at different locations; entl50ab (encoding entl50a and entl50b) are on the  50-kb plasmid pciz1, entqa (encoding entq) is on the 7.4-kb plasmid pciz2, and entp (encoding entp) is on the chromosome. the complete nucleotide sequence of pciz2 was determined to be 7,383 bp long and contains 10 putative open reading frames (orfs) organized in three distinct regions. the first region contains three orfs: entqa preceded by two divergently oriented genes, entqb and entqc. entqb shows high levels of similarity to bacterial atp-binding cassette (abc) transporters, while entqc displays no significant similarity to any known protein. the second region encompasses four orfs (orf4 to orf7), and orf4 and orf5 display high levels of similarity to mobilization proteins from e. faecium and enterococcus faecalis. in addition, features resembling a transfer origin region (orit) were found in the promoter area of orf4. the third region contains  three orfs (orf8 to orf10), and orf8 and orf9 exhibit similarity to the replication initiator protein repe from e. faecalis and to repb proteins, respectively. to clarify the minimum requirement for entq synthesis, we subcloned and heterologously expressed a 2,371-bp fragment from pciz2 that encompasses only the entqa, entqb, and entqc genes in lactobacillus sakei, and we demonstrated that this fragment is sufficient for entq production. moreover, we also obtained  experimental results indicating that entqb is involved in abc transporter-mediated entq secretion, while entqc confers immunity to this bacteriocin.

AB  == enterococcus faecium t8, isolated from vaginal secretions of children with human  immunodeficiency virus, produces a class iia sec-dependent bacteriocin that is structurally different from three other class iia sec-dependent bacteriocins, i.e., enterocin p and an enterocin p-like bacteriocin, produced by enterococcus faecium, and bacteriocin 31, produced by enterococcus faecalis, and from a class  iii bacteriocin produced by e. faecalis. the genes encoding the bacteriocin, immunity protein, mobilization protein, and relaxase nuclease are located on a 7-kb plasmid. bacteriocin t8 has a molecular mass of 5.1 kda based on its dna sequence, similar to the 5.0 kda recorded for bacteriocin 31 but larger than the  4.6 kda reported for enterocin p. at the amino acid level, bacteriocin t8 is 69%  homologous to bacteriocin 31 and 47% homologous to enterocin p. bacteriocin t8 is active against e. faecalis isolated from patients diagnosed with vaginosis, against lactobacillus sakei, and against a propionibacterium sp. the peptide is heat stable (60 min at 100 degrees c) and remains active in phosphate buffer from ph 4.0 to 10.0. the mode of activity is bactericidal, as determined with e. faecalis.

TI  == lactobacillus plantarum gene clusters encoding putative cell-surface protein complexes for carbohydrate utilization are conserved in specific gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == background: genomes of gram-positive bacteria encode many putative cell-surface proteins, of which the majority has no known function. from the rapidly increasing number of available genome sequences it has become apparent that many  cell-surface proteins are conserved, and frequently encoded in gene clusters or operons, suggesting common functions, and interactions of multiple components. results: a novel gene cluster encoding exclusively cell-surface proteins was identified, which is conserved in a subgroup of gram-positive bacteria. each gene cluster generally has one copy of four new gene families called csca, cscb, cscc  and cscd. clusters encoding these cell-surface proteins were found only in complete genomes of lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus sakei, enterococcus faecalis, listeria innocua, listeria monocytogenes, lactococcus lactis ssp lactis and bacillus cereus and in incomplete genomes of l. lactis ssp cremoris, lactobacillus casei, enterococcus faecium, pediococcus pentosaceus, lactobacillius brevis, oenococcus oeni, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and bacillus thuringiensis. these genes are neither present in the genomes of streptococci, staphylococci and clostridia, nor in the lactobacillus acidophilus group, suggesting a niche-specific distribution, possibly relating to association with plants. all encoded proteins have a signal peptide for secretion by the sec-dependent pathway, while some have cell-surface anchors, novel wxl domains, and putative domains for sugar binding and degradation. transcriptome analysis in l. plantarum shows that the csca-d genes are co-expressed, supporting their operon organization. many gene clusters are significantly up-regulated in a glucose-grown, ccpa-mutant derivative of l. plantarum, suggesting catabolite control. this is supported by the presence of predicted cre-sites upstream or inside the up-regulated csca-d gene clusters. conclusion: we propose that the csca, cscb, cscc and cscd proteins form cell-surface protein complexes and play a role in carbon source acquisition. primary occurrence in plant-associated gram-positive bacteria suggests a possible role in degradation and utilization of plant oligo- or poly-saccharides.

TI  == antimicrobial potential of immobilized lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis atcc 11454 against selected bacteria.
AB  == immobilization of living cells of lactic acid bacteria could be an alternative or complementary method of immobilizing organic acids and bacteriocins and inhibit undesirable bacteria in foods. this study evaluated the inhibition potential of immobilized lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis atcc 11454 on selected bacteria by a modified method of the agar spot test. l. lactis was immobilized in calcium alginate (1 to 2%)-whey protein concentrate (0 and 1%) beads. the antimicrobial potential of immobilized l. lactis was evaluated in microbiological media against pathogenic bacteria (escherichia coli, salmonella, and staphylococcus aureus) or  pseudomonas putida, a natural meat contaminant, and against seven gram-positive bacteria used as indicator strains. results obtained in this study indicated that immobilized l. lactis inhibited the growth of s. aureus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus curvatus, lactobacillus sakei, kocuria varians, and pediococcus acidilactici. only 4 h of incubation at 35 degrees c resulted in a clear inhibition zone around the beads that increased with time. with the addition of 10 mm of a chelating agent (edta) to the media, results showed growth inhibition of e. coli; however, p. putida and salmonella typhi were unaffected by this treatment. these results indicate that immobilized lactic acid bacteria strains can be successfully used to produce nisin and inhibit bacterial  growth in semisolid synthetic media.

TI  == microbial quality and direct pcr identification of lactic acid bacteria and nonpathogenic staphylococci from artisanal low-acid sausages.
AB  == detection of six species of lactic acid bacteria and six species of gram-positive catalase-positive cocci from low-acid fermented sausages (fuets and chorizos) was assessed by species-specific pcr. without enrichment, lactobacillus sakei and lactobacillus curvatus were detected in 11.8% of the samples, and lactobacillus plantarum and staphylococcus xylosus were detected in 17.6%. enriched samples allowed the detection of l. sakei and s. xylosus in all of the samples (100%) and of enterococcus faecium in 11.8% of the sausages. the percentages of l. curvatus, l. plantarum, staphylococcus carnosus, and staphylococcus epidermidis varied depending on the sausage type. l. curvatus was detected in 80% of fuets and in 57% of chorizos. l. plantarum was found in 50% of fuets and 100% of chorizos. s.  epidermidis was detected in only 11.8% of fuets, and s. carnosus was detected in  only 5.9% of chorizos. lactococcus lactis, staphylococcus warneri, and staphylococcus simulans were not detected in any sausage type. from a microbiological point of view, 70.6% of the samples could be considered of high quality, as they had low counts of enterobacteriaceae and did not contain any of  the food-borne pathogens assayed.

TI  == characterisation of is153, an is3-family insertion sequence isolated from lactobacillus sanfranciscensis and its use for strain differentiation.
AB  == an insertion sequence has been identified in the genome of lactobacillus sanfranciscensis dsm 20451t as segment of 1351 nucleotides containing 37-bp imperfect terminal inverted repeats. the sequence of this element encodes two out of phase, overlapping open reading frames, orfa and orfb, from which three putative proteins are produced. orfab is a transframe protein produced by -1 translational frame shifting between orf a and orf b that is presumed to be the transposase. the large orfab of this element encodes a 342 amino acid protein that displays similarities with transposases encoded by bacterial insertion sequences belonging to the is3 family. in l. sanfranciscensis type strain dsm 20451t multiple truncated is elements were identified. inverse pcr was used to analyze target sites of four of these elements, but except of their highly at rich character not any sequence specificity was identified so far. moreover, no flanking direct repeats were identified. multiple copies of is153 were detected by hybridization in other strains of l. sanfranciscensis. resulting hybridization patterns were shown to differentiate between organisms at strain level rather than a probe targeted against the 16s rdna. with a pcr based approach is153 or highly similar sequences were detected in l. acidophilus, l. casei, l. malefermentans, l. plantarum, l. hilgardii, l. collinoides l. farciminis l. sakei and l. salivarius, l. reuteri as well as in enterococcus faecium, pediococcus acidilactici and p. pentosaceus.

TI  == efficacy of nisin in combination with protective cultures against listeria monocytogenes scott a in tofu.
AB  == nisin can be used as a biopreservative to control growth of listeria monocytogenes in various minimally processed foods. tofu is an example of a non-fermented soybean product, which may allow growth of listeria at refrigeration temperatures and in which nisin may be applied to prevent multiplication of listeria. the efficacy of nisin against listeria may be compromised by the emergence of spontaneous nisin-resistant mutants. exposure of  l. monocytogenes scott a to nisin in a culture medium or in a food product results in an initial reduction of listeria population which is followed by regrowth of survivors to nisin during further incubation. in vitro studies using  standard i nutrient broth showed that enterococcus faecium bfe 900-6a and lactobacillus sakei lb 706-1a used as protective cultures in combination with nisin were able to suppress proliferation of listeria cells not killed by nisin at 10 degrees c. growth and bacteriocin production of these two strains and a third protective culture, lactococcus lactis bfe 902 was also observed in soymilk and tofu at 10 degrees c. inoculation studies with tofu prepared with nisin and protective cultures showed that lower amounts of nisin are required for an effective inhibition of l. monocytogenes scott a when either e. faecium bfe 900-6a or lc. lactis bfe 902 are used in addition. the combination of nisin with  these bacteriocinogenic lactic acid bacteria (lab) resulted in a complete suppression of listerial growth in homemade tofu stored at 10 degrees c for 1 week. lb. sakei lb 706-1a was less effective and did not prevent a slight increase of l. monocytogenes scott a numbers during storage.
