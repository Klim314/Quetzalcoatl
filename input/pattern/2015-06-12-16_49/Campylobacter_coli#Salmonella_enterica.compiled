TI  - Application of bacteriophages in post-harvest control of human pathogenic and food spoiling bacteria.
AB  - Bacteriophages have attracted great attention for application in food biopreservation. Lytic bacteriophages specific for human pathogenic bacteria can be isolated from natural sources such as animal feces or industrial wastes where the target bacteria inhabit. Lytic bacteriophages have been tested in different food systems for inactivation of main food-borne pathogens including Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella enterica, Shigella spp., Campylobacter jejuni and Cronobacter sakazkii, and also for control of spoilage bacteria. Application of lytic bacteriophages could selectively control host populations of concern without interfering with the remaining food microbiota. Bacteriophages could also be applied for inactivation of bacteria attached to food contact surfaces or grown as biofilms. Bacteriophages may receive a generally recognized as safe status based on their lack of toxicity and other detrimental effects to human health. Phage preparations specific for L. monocytogenes, E. coli O157:H7 and S. enterica serotypes have been commercialized and approved for application in foods or as part of surface decontamination protocols. Phage endolysins have a broader host specificity compared to lytic bacteriophages. Cloned endolysins could be used as natural preservatives, singly or in combination with other antimicrobials such as bacteriocins.
TI  - Microbiological survey of birds of prey pellets.
AB  - A microbiological survey of 73 pellets collected from different birds of prey species housed at the Wildlife Rescue and Rehabilitation Center of Napoli (southern Italy) was performed. Pellets were analyzed by culture and biochemical methods as well as by serotyping and polymerase chain reaction. We isolated a wide range of bacteria some of them also pathogens for humans (i.e. Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium, Campylobacter coli, Escherichia coli O serogroups). This study highlights the potential role of birds of prey as asymptomatic carriers of pathogenic bacteria which could be disseminated in the environment not only through the birds of prey feces but also through their pellets.
TI  - Preliminary incidence and trends of infection with pathogens transmitted commonly through food - foodborne diseases active surveillance network, 10 u.s. Sites, 2006-2014.
AB  - Foodborne illnesses represent a substantial, yet largely preventable, health burden in the United States. In 10 U.S. geographic areas, the Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Network* (FoodNet) monitors the incidence of laboratory-confirmed infections caused by nine pathogens transmitted commonly through food. This report summarizes preliminary 2014 data and describes changes in incidence compared with 2006-2008 and 2011-2013. In 2014, FoodNet reported 19,542 infections, 4,445 hospitalizations, and 71 deaths. The incidence of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) O157 and Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium infections declined in 2014 compared with 2006-2008, and the incidence of infection with Campylobacter, Vibrio, and Salmonella serotypes Infantis and Javiana was higher. Compared with 2011-2013, the incidence of STEC O157 and Salmonella Typhimurium infections was lower, and the incidence of STEC non-O157 and Salmonella serotype Infantis infections was higher in 2014. Despite ongoing food safety efforts, the incidence of many infections remains high, indicating that further prevention measures are needed to make food safer and achieve national health objectives.
TI  - LA35 Poultry Fecal Marker Persistence Is Correlated with that of Indicators and Pathogens in Environmental Waters.
AB  - Disposal of fecal-contaminated poultry litter by land application can deliver pathogens and fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) into receiving waters via runoff. While water quality is regulated by FIB enumeration, FIB testing provides inadequate information about contamination source and health risk. This microbial source tracking (MST) study compared the persistence of the Brevibacterium sp. LA35 16S rRNA gene (marker) for poultry litter with that of pathogens and FIB under outdoor, environmentally relevant conditions in fresh and marine water and sediments over seven days. Salmonella enterica, Campylobacter jejuni, C. coli, Bacteroidales, and LA35 were enumerated by quantitative PCR (qPCR), and Enterococcus spp. and E. coli were quantified by culture and qPCR. Unlike the other bacteria, C. jejuni was not detectable after 48 h. Bacterial levels in the water column consistently declined over time, and were highly correlated among species. Survival in sediments ranged from a slow decrease over time to growth, particularly in marine microcosms, and for Bacteroidales. S. enterica also grew in marine sediments. Linear decay rates in water (k) ranged from -0.17 d-1 for LA35 to -3.12 d-1 for C. coli. LA35 levels correlated well with other bacteria in the water column, but not in sediments. These observations suggest that, particularly in the water column, the fate of LA35 in aquatic environments is similar to that of FIB, C. coli and Salmonella, supporting the hypothesis that the LA35 marker gene can be a useful tool for evaluating the impact of poultry litter on water quality and human health risk.
TI  - Molecular survey of occurrence and quantity of Legionella spp., Mycobacterium spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa and amoeba hosts in municipal drinking water storage tank sediments.
AB  - AIMS: To examine the occurrence and quantity of potential pathogens and an indicator of microbial contamination in the sediments of municipal drinking water storage tanks (MDWSTs), given the absence of such data across the United States. METHODS AND RESULTS: Sediment samples (87 MDWST) from eighteen locations across ten states of the United States were collected and assayed by qPCR for a range of potential enteric and opportunistic microbial pathogens and a sewage-associated Bacteroides marker. Potential opportunistic pathogens dominated, with the highest detection of occurrence (per cent positive detection; average cell equivalence (CE)) being Mycobacterium spp. (88.9%; 6.7 +/- 8.5 x 104 CE g-1 ), followed by Legionella spp. (66.7%; 5.2 +/- 5.9 x 103 CE g-1 ), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (22.2%; 250 +/- 880 CE g-1 ) and Acanthamoeba spp. (38.9%; 53 +/- 70 CE g-1 ), with no detected Naegleria fowleri. Most enteric pathogens (Campylobacter jejuni, Escherichia coli 0157:H7, Salmonella enterica, Cryptosporidium parvum and Giardia duodenalis) were not detected, except for a trace signal for Campylobacter spp. There was significant correlation between the qPCR signals of Legionella spp. and Acanthamoeba spp. (R2 = 0.61, n = 87, P = 0.0001). Diverse Legionella spp. including Leg. pneumophila, Leg. pneumophila sg1 and Leg. anisa were identified, each of which might cause legionellosis. CONCLUSIONS: These results imply that potential opportunistic pathogens are common within MDWST sediments and could act as a source of microbial contamination, but need downstream growth to be of potential concern. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The results imply that opportunistic pathogen risks may need to be managed by regular tank cleaning or other management practices.
TI  - Presence of zoonotic agents in engorged ticks and hedgehog faeces from Erinaceus  europaeus in (sub) urban areas.
AB  - BACKGROUND: European hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus) are hosts for Ixodes hexagonus and I. ricinus ticks, which are vectors for zoonotic microorganisms. In addition, hedgehogs may carry several enteric zoonoses as well. It is unclear to what extent a presence of pathogens in hedgehogs poses a risk to public health, as information on the presence of zoonotic agents in hedgehogs in urban areas is relatively scarce. METHODS: Engorged ticks and hedgehog faeces were collected from rehabilitating hedgehogs. Ticks were screened individually for presence of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, B. miyamotoi, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, and Candidatus Neoehrlichia mikurensis using PCR-based assays. Faecal samples were screened for presence of Campylobacter, Salmonella, Giardia, Cryptosporidium, and extended-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant-Escherichia coli (ESC)-resistant E. coli, using both culture-based and PCR-based methods. RESULTS: Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Borrelia genospecies B. afzelii, B. spielmanii, B. garinii, and B. burgdorferi sensu stricto were detected in both I. hexagonus and I. ricinus ticks. Despite their widespread distribution in the Netherlands, B. miyamotoi and Candidatus N. mikurensis were not detected in collected ticks. Analysis of hedgehog faecal samples revealed the presence of Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica and Campylobacter jejuni. In addition, ESC-resistant E. coli were observed in high prevalence in faecal samples, but no Shiga-toxin producing-E.coli were detected. Finally, potentially zoonotic protozoan parasites were observed in hedgehog faecal samples as well, including Giardia duodenalis assemblage A, Cryptosporidium parvum subtypes IIaA17G1R1 and IIcA5G3, and C. hominis subtype IbA10G2. CONCLUSIONS: European hedgehogs in (sub)urban areas harbor a number of zoonotic agents, and therefore may contribute to the spread and transmission of zoonotic diseases. The relatively high prevalence of B. burgdorferi s.l. and A. phagocytophilum in engorged ticks, suggests that hedgehogs contribute to their enzootic cycles in (sub)urban areas. To what extent can hedgehogs maintain the enteric zoonotic agents in natural cycles, and the role of (spill-back from) humans remains to be investigated.
TI  - Antibiotic-resistant bacteria: prevalence in food and inactivation by food-compatible compounds and plant extracts.
AB  - Foodborne antibiotic-resistant pathogenic bacteria such as Campylobacter jejuni,  Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, Staphylococcus aureus, Vibrio cholerae, and Vibrio parahemolyticus can adversely affect animal and human health, but a better understanding of the factors involved in their pathogenesis is needed. To help meet this need, this overview surveys and interprets much of our current knowledge of antibiotic (multidrug)-resistant bacteria in the food chain and the implications for microbial food safety and animal and human health. Topics covered include the origin and prevalence of resistant bacteria in the food chain (dairy, meat, poultry, seafood, and herbal products, produce, and eggs), their inactivation by different classes of compounds and plant extracts and by the use of chlorine and physicochemical methods (heat, UV light, pulsed electric fields, and high pressure), the synergistic antimicrobial effects of combinations of natural antimicrobials with medicinal antibiotics, and mechanisms of antimicrobial activities and resistant effects. Possible areas for future research are suggested. Plant-derived and other safe natural antimicrobial compounds have the potential to control the prevalence of both susceptible and resistant pathogens in various environments. The collated information and suggested research will hopefully contribute to a better understanding of approaches that could be used to minimize the presence of resistant pathogens in animal feed and human food, thus reducing adverse effects, improving microbial food safety, and helping to prevent or treat animal and human infections.
TI  - Increased efficiency of Campylobacter jejuni N-oligosaccharyltransferase PglB by  structure-guided engineering.
AB  - Conjugate vaccines belong to the most efficient preventive measures against life-threatening bacterial infections. Functional expression of N-oligosaccharyltransferase (N-OST) PglB of Campylobacter jejuni in Escherichia coli enables a simplified production of glycoconjugate vaccines in prokaryotic cells. Polysaccharide antigens of pathogenic bacteria can be covalently coupled to immunogenic acceptor proteins bearing engineered glycosylation sites. Transfer efficiency of PglBCj is low for certain heterologous polysaccharide substrates. In this study, we increased glycosylation rates for Salmonella enterica sv. Typhimurium LT2 O antigen (which lacks N-acetyl sugars) and Staphylococcus aureus CP5 polysaccharides by structure-guided engineering of PglB. A three-dimensional homology model of membrane-associated PglBCj, docked to the natural C. jejuni N-glycan attached to the acceptor peptide, was used to identify potential sugar-interacting residues as targets for mutagenesis. Saturation mutagenesis of an active site residue yielded the enhancing mutation N311V, which facilitated fivefold to 11-fold increased in vivo glycosylation rates as determined by glycoprotein-specific ELISA. Further rounds of in vitro evolution led to a triple mutant S80R-Q287P-N311V enabling a yield improvement of S. enterica LT2 glycoconjugates by a factor of 16. Our results demonstrate that bacterial N-OST can be tailored to specific polysaccharide substrates by structure-guided protein engineering.
TI  - Enteric pathogens and antimicrobial resistance in turkey vultures (Cathartes aura) feeding at the wildlife-livestock interface.
AB  - Free-flying turkey vultures (Cathartes aura) were sampled in California to investigate the fecal shedding prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibility of Salmonella enterica, Campylobacter spp., and Escherichia coli. Nine different serotypes of Salmonella enterica were detected in cloacal swabs from turkey vultures, and 6% of vultures were shedding Campylobacter spp.. Turkey vultures sampled at a location with range sheep were more likely to shed tetracycline-resistant E. coli, suggesting that proximity to livestock facilities could facilitate acquisition of drug-resistant bacteria in avian scavengers. These findings illustrate the importance of assessing drug-resistant pathogen transfer at the livestock-wildlife interface.
TI  - Antibiotic susceptibility and prevalence of foodborne pathogens in poultry meat in Romania.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The occurrence of pathogenic strains in poultry meat is of growing  concern in Romania. Another problem found on a global level is the continuous increase of antimicrobial resistance in bacteria isolated from food. This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of pathogenic bacteria in poultry carcasses obtained in Romania in 2012-2013 and to reveal the most prevalent patterns of antimicrobial resistance in the isolated strains. METHODOLOGY: A total of 144 broiler chicken carcasses were evaluated according to classical microbiological methods. The DNA was extracted from the bacterial colonies and the resistance genes were identified by PCR. RESULTS: In 2012, 47.2% of the samples revealed at least one of the following bacteria: Campylobacter jejuni (9.72%; n = 7), Salmonella enterica serotype Enteritidis (4.17%; n = 3), Listeria monocytogenes (15.28%; n = 11), and Escherichia coli (16.67%; n = 12). In 2013, the number of positive samples of pathogenic bacteria decreased, although Campylobacter jejuni was isolated in a higher percentage (20.8% vs. 9.72%). The percentage of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria was high (23%); the most prevalent pattern included resistance to tetracycline, sulfonamides, and quinolones/fluoroquinolones. All the resistant Salmonella and E. coli strains were tested for the presence of characteristic resistance genes (Kn, bla(TEM), tetA, tetB, tetG, DfrIa, aadA1a, Sul) and revealed that these isolates represent an important reservoir in the spread of this phenomenon. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that Romania urgently needs an integrated surveillance system within the entire chain, for drug-resistant pathogens isolated from poultry meat.
TI  - Bacterial flagella: twist and stick, or dodge across the kingdoms.
AB  - The flagellum organelle is an intricate multiprotein assembly best known for its  rotational propulsion of bacteria. However, recent studies have expanded our knowledge of other functions in pathogenic contexts, particularly adherence and immune modulation, e.g., for Salmonella enterica, Campylobacter jejuni, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli. Flagella-mediated adherence is important in host colonisation for several plant and animal pathogens, but the specific interactions that promote flagella binding to such diverse host tissues has remained elusive. Recent work has shown that the organelles act like probes that find favourable surface topologies to initiate binding. An emerging theme is that more general properties, such as ionic charge of repetitive binding epitopes and rotational force, allow interactions with plasma membrane components. At the same time, flagellin monomers are important inducers of plant and animal innate immunity: variation in their recognition impacts the course and outcome of infections in hosts from both kingdoms. Bacteria have evolved different strategies to evade or even promote this specific recognition, with some important differences shown for phytopathogens. These studies have provided a wider appreciation of the functions of bacterial flagella in the context of both plant and animal reservoirs.
TI  - Bacterial pathogen gene abundance and relation to recreational water quality at seven Great Lakes beaches.
AB  - Quantitative assessment of bacterial pathogens, their geographic variability, and distribution in various matrices at Great Lakes beaches are limited. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was used to test for genes from E. coli O157:H7 (eaeO157), shiga-toxin producing E. coli (stx2), Campylobacter jejuni (mapA), Shigella spp. (ipaH), and a Salmonella enterica-specific (SE) DNA sequence at seven Great Lakes beaches, in algae, water, and sediment. Overall, detection frequencies were mapA>stx2>ipaH>SE>eaeO157. Results were highly variable among beaches and matrices; some correlations with environmental conditions were observed for mapA, stx2, and ipaH detections. Beach seasonal mean mapA abundance in water was correlated with beach seasonal mean log10 E. coli concentration. At one beach, stx2 gene abundance was positively correlated with concurrent daily E. coli concentrations. Concentration distributions for stx2, ipaH, and mapA within algae, sediment, and water were statistically different (Non-Detect and Data Analysis in R). Assuming 10, 50, or 100% of gene copies represented viable and presumably infective cells, a quantitative microbial risk assessment tool developed by Michigan State University indicated a moderate probability of illness for Campylobacter jejuni at the study beaches, especially where recreational water quality criteria were exceeded. Pathogen gene quantification may be useful for beach water quality management.
TI  - Estimation of cultivable bacterial diversity in the cloacae and pharynx in Eurasian griffon vultures (Gyps fulvus).
AB  - In this work, we describe the biodiversity of cloacal and pharynx culture-based bacteria (commensal and pathogenic), in 75 Eurasian griffon vultures (Gyps fulvus) from two geographic areas. We address the question of whether the cultivable microbiota of vultures is organised into assemblages occurring by chance. In addition, we assess bacterial diversity in both anatomic regions and geographic areas. Bacterial diversity was represented by 26 Gram-negative and 20 Gram-positive genera. The most common genera were Escherichia, Enterococcus, Staphylococcus, Clostridium and Lactococcus. Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis were the most common species in cloacal and pharyngeal samples. Staphylococcus and Erysipelothrix were isolated from the pharynx and Salmonella and Corynebacterium from the cloacae, and no Campylobacter was isolated from the cloacal swabs. Ten cloacal swabs were positive for Salmonella, of which five isolates were Salmonella enterica serotype 4,(5),12:i:-, one isolate was S. enterica serotype Derby, three isolates were S. enterica serotype 61:k:1,5,7 and one isolate was S. enterica serotype Infantis. The null modelling approach revealed that the commensal bacteria of vultures are not structured in assemblages. On the other hand, differences in bacterial genus and species richness between cloacal and pharyngeal samples or between geographic areas were clear, with the pharynx in vultures from both geographic areas being richer. The results of this study indicate also that vultures can serve as a reservoir of certain pathogenic zoonotic bacteria. The dissemination of these zoonotic pathogens in wildlife could be prevented by periodic sanitary surveys.
TI  - Microbiological analysis of environmental samples collected from child care facilities in North and South Carolina.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Children cared for outside the home are at an increased risk of enteric disease. Microbiological analyses were performed on environmental samples collected from child care facilities in North and South Carolina. METHODS: There were 326 samples collected from 40 facilities corresponding to common surfaces (77% of samples) and the hands of care providers (23% of samples). Samples were analyzed for total aerobic plate counts (APCs), total coliforms, biotype I Escherichia coli, and pathogens Shigella spp, Salmonella enterica, E coli O157, Campylobacter jejuni, and human norovirus. RESULTS: Median APCs and coliform counts for hands were 4.6 and 1.0 log10 colony-forming units (CFU) per hand, respectively. Median APCs for surfaces were 2.0 and 2.6 log10 CFU for flat and irregular surfaces, respectively. Coliforms were detected in 16% of samples, with counts ranging from 1.0 log10 to > 4.3 log10 CFU, with higher counts most often observed for hand rinse samples. Biotype I E coli counts were below assay detection limits (< 1 log10 CFU) for all but 1 sample. No samples were positive for any of the 4 bacterial pathogens, whereas 4 samples showed evidence of human norovirus RNA. CONCLUSION: The relative absence of pathogens and biotype I E coli in environmental samples suggests the child care facilities sampled in this study managed fecal contamination well.
TI  - Detection of Salmonella spp. by a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) method targeting bcfD gene.
AB  - In this study, we developed and validated a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay for Salmonella detection targeting bcfD gene, a conserved fimbrial operon gene existing in Salmonella. The Salmonella LAMP assay we developed successfully amplified 44 Salmonella strains (14 standard strains and 30 clinical isolates), but none of 9 non-Salmonella standard strains (Proteus mirabilis, Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Shigella flexneri, Shigella sonnei, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Campylobacter jejuni and Vibrio parahemolyticus). The detection limit was 5 CFU of Salmonella pure culture or 200 CFU of artificially spiked faeces per reaction system (equivalent to 5000 CFU g(-1) of faeces), and this method could directly detect Salmonella in chicken faeces free of pre-enrichment in a reaction time of 25 min. Our experiments show that the LAMP method we developed is a rapid, sensitive, specific and practical method for Salmonella detection. The Salmonella LAMP assay can potentially serve as new on-site diagnostics in the food and agricultural industries.

TI  - Antibacterial, antiviral, and antifungal properties of wines and winery byproducts in relation to their flavonoid content.
AB  - Grapes produce organic compounds that may be involved in the defense of the plants against invading phytopathogens. These metabolites include numerous phenolic compounds that are also active against human pathogens. Grapes are used to produce a variety of wines, grape juices, and raisins. Grape pomace, seeds, and skins, the remains of the grapes that are a byproduct of winemaking, also contain numerous bioactive compounds that differ from those found in grapes and wines. This overview surveys and interprets our present knowledge of the activities of wines and winery byproducts and some of their bioactive components against foodborne (Bacillus cereus, Campylobacter jejuni, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella enterica, Staphylococcus aureus, Yersinia enterocolitica, Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio vulnificus), medical (Helicobacter pylori, Klebsiella pneumoniae), and oral pathogenic bacteria, viruses (adeno, cytomegalo, hepatitis, noro, rota), fungi (Candida albicans, Botrytis cinerea), parasites (Eimeria tenella, Trichomonas vaginalis), and microbial toxins (ochratoxin A, Shiga toxin) in culture, in vivo, and in/on food (beef, chicken, frankfurters, hot dogs, lettuce, oysters, peppers, pork, sausages, soup, spinach) in relation to composition and sensory properties. Also covered are antimicrobial wine marinades, antioxidative and immunostimulating aspects, and adverse effects associated with wine consumption. The collated information and suggested research needs might facilitate and guide further studies needed to optimize the use of wines and byproducts to help improve microbial food safety and prevent or treat animal and human infections.
TI  - Identification and characterization of lactic Acid bacteria in a commercial probiotic culture.
AB  - The aim of the present study was to describe the identification and characterization (physiological properties) of two strains of lactic acid bacteria (LAB 18 and 48) present in a commercial probiotic culture, FloraMax((R))-B11. Isolates were characterized morphologically, and identified biochemically. In addition, the MIDI System ID, the Biolog ID System, and 16S rRNA sequence analyses for identification of LAB 18 and LAB 48 strains were used to compare the identification results. Tolerance and resistance to acidic pH, high osmotic concentration of NaCl, and bile salts were tested in broth medium. In vitro assessment of antimicrobial activity against enteropathogenic bacteria and susceptibility to antibiotics were also tested. The results obtained in this study showed tolerance of LAB 18 and LAB 48 to pH 3.0, 6.5% NaCl and a high bile salt concentration (0.6%). Both strains evaluated showed in vitro antibacterial activity against Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis, Escherichia coli (O157:H7), and Campylobacter jejuni. These are important characteristics of lactic acid bacteria that should be evaluated when selecting strains to be used as probiotics. Antimicrobial activity of these effective isolates may contribute to efficacy, possibly by direct antimicrobial activity in vivo.
TI  - Development of 23 individual TaqMan(R) real-time PCR assays for identifying common foodborne pathogens using a single set of amplification conditions.
AB  - Most of the acute intestinal diseases are caused by foodborne pathogens with infants and elderly people being at major risk. The aim of this study was to develop a procedure to simultaneously detect 20 foodborne pathogens in complex alimentary matrices such as milk, cheese and meat. The list of targets include, among the others, Listeria spp., Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., Escherichia coli spp., Campylobacter spp., Clostridium spp. and Staphylococcus aureus. The accuracy of detection was determined by using ATCC strains as positive and negative controls. The achieved sensitivity of each of assays was 1 pg of genomic DNA, which was equivalent to approximately 1 cfu. The working ranges of the TaqMan((R)) Real-time PCR assays, when used quantitatively on cheese and meat samples inoculated with serial dilution of Listeria spp., Listeria monocytogenes, S. aureus, Salmonella enterica, Shigella boydii, E. coli O157:H7, Bacillus cereus, Campylobacter coli, Yersinia enterocolitica, Enterobacter sakazakii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was 10(8) cfu/g to 10(4) cfu/g. No matrix interferences were observed.
TI  - Marinade with thyme and orange oils reduces Salmonella Enteritidis and Campylobacter coli on inoculated broiler breast fillets and whole wings.
AB  - Essential oils have been reported to possess antimicrobial properties and therefore have potential usage as natural antimicrobials in food. In a previous study, thyme orange essential oil combination (TOC) used at the 0.5% level as a dip application on chicken cut-up parts had a significant antibacterial effect against Salmonella and Campylobacter. A study was designed to evaluate the effect of salt-phosphate marinade solution containing 0.5% TOC to 1) reduce Salmonella Enteritidis and Campylobacter coli numbers on broiler breast fillets and whole wings marinated by vacuum tumbling, and 2) reduce cross-contamination of both pathogens between inoculated and uninoculated parts during marination. A total of 52 skinless breast fillets and 52 whole wings were used for the 2 replications. For each replication, each cut-up part was randomly assigned to 1 of 5 groups: treatment 1: uninoculated parts marinated without TOC; treatment 2: inoculated parts marinated without TOC; treatment 3: uninoculated parts marinated with TOC; treatment 4: inoculated parts marinated with TOC; and control: nonmarinated inoculated parts. Samples were dipped in an inoculum containing a mixture of Salmonella Enteritidis and C. coli. The treatment samples were marinated by vacuum tumbling. All samples were immediately evaluated to determine Salmonella Enteritidis and C. coli numbers. Results indicated that TOC at the 0.5% level in the marinade solution applied by vacuum tumbling significantly reduced (P < 0.05) numbers of viable Salmonella Enteritidis by 2.6 and 2.3 log cfu/mL on broiler breast fillets and C. coli by 3.6 and 3.1 log cfu/mL on whole wings. Cross-contamination was observed as the uninoculated chicken parts marinated with inoculated parts were positive. However, the number of bacterial cells recovered from the TOC treated samples were significantly lower (P < 0.05) than the numbers recovered from the untreated samples. Marination with a salt phosphate formulation containing 0.5% TOC successfully reduced Salmonella and Campylobacter numbers on poultry products.
TI  - Decay of genetic markers for fecal bacterial indicators and pathogens in sand from Lake Superior.
AB  - Beach sands impact water quality and pathogen loads, however, the comparative decay of the fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) Enterococcus spp. and Escherichia coli, and pathogens in freshwater sand have not been examined. In this study, freshwater sand microcosms were inoculated with sewage and pure cultures of bacterial pathogens to compare relative decay rates. The abundance of culturable Enterococcus spp. and E. coli, genetic markers for Enterococcus spp. (Entero1), total Bacteroides (AllBac), and human-specific Bacteroides (HF183), and genetic markers for the pathogens Campylobacter jejuni, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium, and Shigella flexneri were monitored over the course of two weeks using conventional culture methods and quantitative PCR (qPCR). The effect of moisture on the persistence of culturable FIB and all genetic markers was also determined. In addition, propidium monoazide (PMA) treatment was used to examine differences in the persistence of total genetic markers and those from live cells. Decay rates were statistically compared using Tukey's test. Moisture had a significant (p </= 0.05) effect on the decay rates of culturable indicator bacteria, total AllBac markers, and genetic markers for FIB, Salmonella, and MRSA from live cells. At 14% sand moisture, the decay rate of total markers was slower than that of live cells for all qPCR assays, but at 28% moisture, there was no difference in the decay rates of total and live markers for any assay. AllBac and MRSA markers increased in sand at 28% moisture, probably indicating cellular growth. Overall, culturable FIB and HF183 had decay rates that were most comparable to the bacterial pathogen markers examined in this study, whereas Entero1 and AllBac rarely exhibited decay rates similar to the bacterial pathogens in this study. The choice of FIB for assessment of fecal contamination in freshwater sand should take into account the pathogen of concern and sand moisture conditions.
TI  - Best practices for planning events encouraging human-animal interactions.
AB  - Educational events encouraging human-animal interaction include the risk of zoonotic disease transmission. It is estimated that 14% of all disease in the USA caused by Campylobacter spp., Cryptosporidium spp., Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) O157, non-O157 STECs, Listeria monocytogenes, non-typhoidal Salmonella enterica and Yersinia enterocolitica were attributable to animal contact. This article reviews best practices for organizing events where human-animal interactions are encouraged, with the objective of lowering the risk of zoonotic disease transmission.
TI  - Molecular architecture of the bacterial flagellar motor in cells.
AB  - The flagellum is one of the most sophisticated self-assembling molecular machines in bacteria. Powered by the proton-motive force, the flagellum rapidly rotates in either a clockwise or counterclockwise direction, which ultimately controls bacterial motility and behavior. Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica have served as important model systems for extensive genetic, biochemical, and structural analysis of the flagellum, providing unparalleled insights into its structure, function, and gene regulation. Despite these advances, our understanding of flagellar assembly and rotational mechanisms remains incomplete, in part because of the limited structural information available regarding the intact rotor-stator complex and secretion apparatus. Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) has become a valuable imaging technique capable of visualizing the intact flagellar motor in cells at molecular resolution. Because the resolution that can be achieved by cryo-ET with large bacteria (such as E. coli and S. enterica) is limited, analysis of small-diameter bacteria (including Borrelia burgdorferi and Campylobacter jejuni) can provide additional insights into the in situ structure of the flagellar motor and other cellular components. This review is focused on the application of cryo-ET, in combination with genetic and biophysical approaches, to the study of flagellar structures and its potential for improving the understanding of rotor-stator interactions, the rotational switching mechanism, and the secretion and assembly of flagellar components.
TI  - Prevalence and concentration of bacterial pathogens in raw produce and minimally  processed packaged salads produced in and for the Netherlands.
AB  - Recent outbreaks with vegetable or fruits as vehicles have raised interest in the characterization of the public health risk due to microbial contamination of these commodities. Because qualitative and quantitative data regarding prevalence and concentration of various microbes are lacking, we conducted a survey to estimate the prevalence and contamination level of raw produce and the resulting minimally processed packaged salads as sold in The Netherlands. A dedicated sampling plan accounted for the amount of processed produce in relation to the amount of products, laboratory capacity, and seasonal influences. Over 1,800 samples of produce and over 1,900 samples of ready-to-eat mixed salads were investigated for Salmonella enterica serovars, Campylobacter spp., Escherichia coli O157, and Listeria monocytogenes. The overall prevalence in raw produce varied between 0.11% for E. coli O157 and L. monocytogenes and 0.38% for Salmonella. Prevalence point estimates for specific produce/pathogen combinations ranged for Salmonella from 0.53% in iceberg lettuce to 5.1% in cucumber. For Campylobacter, this ranged from 0.83% in endive to 2.7% in oak tree lettuce. These data will be used to determine the public health risk posed by the consumption of ready-to-eat mixed salads in The Netherlands.
TI  - In vitro activity of rifaximin against clinical isolates of Escherichia coli and  other enteropathogenic bacteria isolated from travellers returning to the UK.
AB  - Rifaximin is licensed in the EU and USA for treating travellers' diarrhoea caused by non-invasive bacteria. Selection for resistance mechanisms of public health significance might occur if these are linked to rifamycin resistance. Rifaximin MICs were determined by agar dilution for 90 isolates each of Escherichia coli, Shigella spp., nontyphoidal Salmonella enterica, typhoidal S. enterica and Campylobacter spp., an additional 60 E. coli with CTX-M ESBLs isolated from patients with travellers' diarrhoea, and 30 non-diarrhoeal carbapenemase-producing E. coli. Comparators were rifampicin, ciprofloxacin, azithromycin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and doxycycline. Isolates with rifaximin MICs>32 mg/L were screened for arr genes, and critical rpoB regions were sequenced. Rifaximin was active at </=32 mg/L against 436/450 (96.9%) diverse Enterobacteriaceae, whereas 81/90 (90%) Campylobacter spp. were resistant to rifaximin at >/=128 mg/L. Rifaximin MICs were >/=128 mg/L for two Shigella and five MDR E. coli producing NDM (n = 3), OXA-48 (n = 1) or CTX-M-15 (n = 1). Two of the five MDR E. coli had plasmids harbouring arr-2 together with bla(NDM), and two (one each with bla(NDM) and bla(CTX-M-15)) had His526Asn substitutions in RpoB. The rifamycin resistance mechanism remained undefined in one MDR E. coli isolate (with bla(OXA-48)) and the two Shigella isolates. Rifaximin showed good in vitro activity against diverse Enterobacteriaceae but was largely inactive against Campylobacter spp. Rifaximin has potential to co-select MDR E. coli in the gut flora, but much stronger associations were seen between ESBL and/or carbapenemase production and resistance to alternative treatments for travellers' diarrhoea, notably ciprofloxacin and azithromycin.
TI  - Occurrence of enteropathogenic bacteria in urban pigeons (Columba livia) in Italy.
AB  - This study was aimed at evaluating the prevalence of Campylobacter spp., Escherichia coli O157, Salmonella spp., and related virulence factors (the cdt, stx, and eae genes) in urban pigeons of the coastal area of the Campania region (southern Italy). To achieve this goal, cloacal swab samples from a total of 1800 urban pigeons were collected and subjected to culture methods, PCR, and serotyping. The results of the present study showed a prevalence of 48.3% (870/1800), 7.8% (141/1800), and 0.9% (16/1800), for C. jejuni, E. coli O157, and S. Typhimurium, respectively. All C. jejuni isolates (870/870) carried cdt genes, whereas all E. coli O157 isolates carried stx genes, and 14.9% (21/141) carried the eae gene. These findings clearly show that urban pigeons in the coastal area of the Campania region may constitute an environmental reservoir of these pathogens, thus representing a source of infection for other birds, livestock, and humans.
TI  - Disease-outcome trees, EQ-5D scores, and estimated annual losses of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for 14 foodborne pathogens in the United States.
AB  - Measures of disease burden such as quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) are increasingly important to risk-based food safety policy. They provide a means of comparing relative risk from diverse health outcomes. We present detailed disease-outcome trees and EQ-5D scoring for 14 major foodborne pathogens representing over 95% of foodborne illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths due to specified agents in the United States (Campylobacter spp., Clostridium perfringens, Cryptosporidium parvum, Cyclospora cayetanensis, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Shiga toxin-producing E. coli non-O157, Listeria monocytogenes, nontyphoidal Salmonella enterica, Shigella, Toxoplasma gondii, Vibrio vulnificus, Vibrio parahaemolyticus and other noncholera Vibrio, and Yersinia enterocolitica). We estimate over 5800 QALYs lost per 1000 cases of L. monocytogenes and V. vulnificus, compared to 125 QALYs lost per 1000 cases of T. gondii, 26 for E. coli O157:H7, 16 for Salmonella and Campylobacter, and 14 for Y. enterocolitica. The remaining 7 pathogens are estimated to cause less than 5 QALYs lost per 1000 cases. In total, these 14 pathogens cause over 61,000 in QALY loss annually, with more than 90% due solely to acute infection being responsible for 65% of total QALY loss, with premature mortality and morbidity due to chronic and congenital illness responsible for another 28%. These estimates of the burden of chronic sequelae are likely conservative; additional epidemiological research is needed to support more accurate burden estimates. This study shows the value of using integrated metrics for comparing disease burden, and the need to consider chronic and congenital illness when prioritizing foodborne pathogens.
TI  - A modified molecular beacons-based multiplex real-time PCR assay for simultaneous detection of eight foodborne pathogens in a single reaction and its application.
AB  - Foodborne disease outbreaks are often caused by one of the major pathogens. Early identification of the causal pathogen is crucial for disease control and prevention. We describe a real-time polymerase chain reaction (rtPCR) assay that can identify, in a single reaction, up to eight common foodborne bacterial pathogens, including Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica, Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli O157, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, V. vulnificus, Campylobacter jejuni, Enterobacter sakazakii, and Shigella spp. This multiplex rtPCR assay takes advantage of modified molecular beacons and the multicolor combinational probe coding strategy to discriminate each pathogen and the homo-tag assisted non-dimer (HAND) system to prevent dimer formation. The detection limits of the assay ranged from 1.3x10(3) colony-forming units (CFU)/g stool (L. monocytogenes) to 1.6x10(4) CFU/g stool (Shigella spp.). The target genes were 100% specific as assessed on 986 reference strains covering 41 species since no cross-reactions were observed. The assay was applied to the detection of foodborne pathogens in 11,167 clinical samples and the results were compared with culture methods for further validation. The sensitivity and specificity of the rtPCR were 100% and 99%, respectively. When performed in a 96-well rtPCR system, more than 90 samples could be analyzed within 3 h. Given the high accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and short turn-around time, the established assay could be used for the rapid and reliable identification of the causative pathogens responsible for a certain foodborne disease outbreak and rapid screening of these major foodborne pathogens in laboratory-based surveillance of outpatient clinical samples or even food samples.
TI  - Prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibility of foodborne bacteria in wild boars (Sus scrofa) and wild deer (Cervus nippon) in Japan.
AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the role of wild boars and deer as reservoirs of foodborne bacteria. We investigated the prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibility of Campylobacter spp., Salmonella spp., Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) O157 and O26, and Listeria monocytogenes isolated from wild boars and deer in Japan, from July through December 2010. Campylobacter spp. and Salmonella spp. were isolated from 43.8% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 35.0-52.6) and 7.4% (95% CI: 2.8-12.1) of rectal content samples of wild boars, respectively, but not from wild deer. The most common Campylobacter species was C. lanienae and C. hyointestinalis. The nine Salmonella serovars isolated were S. enterica subsp. enterica serovar Agona (three isolates), S. Narashino (two), S. Enteritidis (one), S. Havana (one), S. Infantis (one), and S. Thompson (one). Five (16%) and 6 (29%) isolates of C. lanienae and C. hyointestinalis, respectively, were resistant to enrofloxacin. STEC O157 and O26 and L. monocytogenes were isolated from 2.3% (95% CI: 0-5.0), 0.8% (95% CI: 0-2.3), and 6.1% (95% CI: 1.7-10.5) of the rectal content samples of wild deer, respectively, but not from wild boars. This first nationwide survey of the prevalence of foodborne bacteria in wild boars and wild deer in Japan suggests that consumption of meat from these animals is associated with the risk of causing infection with these bacteria in humans. Moreover, these animals are potential vehicles for distribution of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria into their habitat. The prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibility of such foodborne bacteria in these wild animals should be monitored periodically.
TI  - Bioengineered 2'-fucosyllactose and 3-fucosyllactose inhibit the adhesion of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and enteric pathogens to human intestinal and respiratory cell lines.
AB  - Human milk oligosaccharides help to prevent infectious diseases in breastfed infants. Larger scale testing, particularly in animal models and human clinical studies, is still limited due to shortened availability of more complex oligosaccharides. The purpose of this study was to evaluate 2'-fucosyllactose (2'-FL) and 3-fucosyllactose (3-FL) synthesized by whole-cell biocatalysis for their biological activity in vitro. Therefore, we have tested these oligosaccharides for their inhibitory potential of pathogen adhesion in two different human epithelial cell lines. 2'-FL could inhibit adhesion of Campylobacter jejuni, enteropathogenic Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica serovar fyris, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa to the intestinal human cell line Caco-2 (reduction of 26%, 18%, 12%, and 17%, respectively), as could be shown for 3-FL (enteropathogenic E coli 29%, P aeruginosa 26%). Furthermore, adherence of P aeruginosa to the human respiratory epithelial cell line A549 was significantly inhibited by 2'-FL and 3-FL (reduction of 24% and 23%, respectively). These results confirm the biological and functional activity of biotechnologically synthesized human milk oligosaccharides. Mass-tailored human milk oligosaccharides could be used in the future to supplement infant formula ingredients or as preventatives to reduce the impact of infectious diseases.
TI  - Sandwich assay for mixed-sequence recognition of double-stranded DNA: invader-based detection of targets specific to foodborne pathogens.
AB  - A 96-well plate sandwich assay based on Invader capture/signalling probes is used to recognize 28-mer mixed-sequence dsDNA targets specific to Salmonella enterica, Campylobacter jejuni, Escherichia coli. Targets are detected down to 20-55 pM concentration with excellent binding specificity.
TI  - Food-borne zoonotic pathogens and antimicrobial resistance of indicator bacteria  in urban wild boars in Barcelona, Spain.
AB  - Wildlife is increasingly abundant in urban environments, but little is known about the zoonotic pathogens carried by these populations. Urban wild boars are of particular concern because this species is well-known as a pathogen reservoir, and thus, we studied selected zoonotic pathogens in urban wild boars in Barcelona, Spain (n=41). Salmonella enterica was found in 5.00% (95% CI 0.61-16.91) and Campylobacter coli in 4.88% (95% CI 0.6-16.53) of the animals. E. coli O157:H7 and C. jejuni were not found. Other thermophilic Campylobacter were moderately prevalent (19.51%, 95% CI 8.82-34.87). Additionally, we screened for antimicrobial resistance in indicator bacteria: resistance was most frequent in Enterococcus faecium (95% of the isolates were resistant to at least one antimicrobial agent), followed by Enterococcus faecalis (50%) and Escherichia coli (10%). For the first time resistance to linezolid in bacteria carried by wildlife is reported. These findings pose a concern for public health, and thus, further research is needed on wildlife in urban environments.
TI  - Development of a magnetic nanoparticles microarray for simultaneous and simple detection of foodborne pathogens.
AB  - Foodborne diseases are a widespread and growing public health problem affecting both developed and developing countries, microbiologically contaminated food and water are the major causes of diarrhoeal diseases. Methods based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and microarrays are rapid and sensitive enough to detect very small quantities of microorganisms, however, the requirement for expensive equipments limits their application. In the present paper, we describe a method based on multiplex PCR and magnetic nanoparticles labelling for simultaneous detection of four major foodborne pathogens, including Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella enterica, Vibrio cholera and Campylobacter jejuni. The process utilizes an oligonucleotide array onto which 5' biotinylated single strand PCR products were hybridized and visualized with streptavidin-coated magnetic nanoparticles (SA-MNPs), the signal from which could be detected by the naked eye, microscope or CCD camera. By employing SA-MNPs as visible labels, the microarray unambiguously distinguished all 4 pathogens with detection sensitivity up to 316 CFU/mL. Due to its high sensitivity, specificity and simple detection procedure, the magnetic bead assay provides a powerful tool for the detection and identification of foodborne pathogens in a modestly equipped laboratory.
TI  - Survey of culture, goldengate assay, universal biosensor assay, and 16S rRNA Gene sequencing as alternative methods of bacterial pathogen detection.
AB  - Cultivation-based assays combined with PCR or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-based methods for finding virulence factors are standard methods for detecting bacterial pathogens in stools; however, with emerging molecular technologies, new methods have become available. The aim of this study was to compare four distinct detection technologies for the identification of pathogens in stools from children under 5 years of age in The Gambia, Mali, Kenya, and Bangladesh. The children were identified, using currently accepted clinical protocols, as either controls or cases with moderate to severe diarrhea. A total of 3,610 stool samples were tested by established clinical culture techniques: 3,179 DNA samples by the Universal Biosensor assay (Ibis Biosciences, Inc.), 1,466 DNA samples by the GoldenGate assay (Illumina), and 1,006 DNA samples by sequencing of 16S rRNA genes. Each method detected different proportions of samples testing positive for each of seven enteric pathogens, enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAEC), enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC), enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), Shigella spp., Campylobacter jejuni, Salmonella enterica, and Aeromonas spp. The comparisons among detection methods included the frequency of positive stool samples and kappa values for making pairwise comparisons. Overall, the standard culture methods detected Shigella spp., EPEC, ETEC, and EAEC in smaller proportions of the samples than either of the methods based on detection of the virulence genes from DNA in whole stools. The GoldenGate method revealed the greatest agreement with the other methods. The agreement among methods was higher in cases than in controls. The new molecular technologies have a high potential for highly sensitive identification of bacterial diarrheal pathogens.
TI  - Impact of 6 different intestinal bacteria on broiler breeder sperm motility in vitro.
AB  - Male fertility is often evaluated by measuring sperm parameters, including concentration, viability, and motility. This is important because after copulation occurs, sperm must overcome many barriers in the female reproductive tract to fertilize the ovum. In mammalian species, sperm have been shown to have reduced motility when bacteria are present. In male broiler breeders, bacteria have been associated with spermatozoa, but their effect on motility has not been investigated. The sperm quality index is a modern rapid method of evaluating avian sperm motility. Therefore, the objective of this study was to use the sperm quality index to determine if broiler breeder sperm motility is reduced when semen is exposed to various bacteria. In this experiment, semen was collected from 20 broiler breeders to obtain a pooled neat semen sample. Six different intestinal bacteria, Salmonella enterica, Escherichia coli, Campylobacter jejuni, Clostridium bifermentans, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Bifidobacterium animalis were cultured overnight. For each bacterium, 50 microL of semen was diluted in 450 microL of saline, sterile broth, or the overnight culture, creating 3 treatments. The experiment was repeated twice. In each treatment, 3 replicates were evaluated at 0 and 10 min postinoculation, creating a completely randomized design with a split plot over time. Also, the pH was measured for each treatment at 0 and 10 min. The results indicated that all broths containing bacteria immediately reduced broiler breeder sperm motility when compared with the controls (P < 0.0001), but broths containing Bifidobacterium or Lactobacillus virtually made sperm immotile. Although broth containing Salmonella, Campylobacter, and Bifidobacterium immediately reduced sperm motility, the reduction did not change over time. Broths containing E. coli, Clostridium, and Lactobacillus reduced sperm motility immediately, but over time motility continued to decrease. However, pH was increased when semen was exposed to the E. coli and Campylobacter treatment, but when semen was exposed to Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus treatments, pH was reduced. In conclusion, the results indicate that bacteria can reduce broiler breeder sperm motility upon exposure.
TI  - Short communication: Survey of animal-borne pathogens in the farm environment of  13 dairy operations.
AB  - A survey was conducted on 13 dairies to determine the occurrence of 5 animal-borne pathogens (Salmonella enterica, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Campylobacter jejuni, Mycobacterium avium ssp. paratuberculosis, and Cryptosporidium parvum) and their distributions across farm elements (feces, bedding, milk filters, stored manure, field soil, and stream water). Presence of C. parvum was measured only in feces and stored manure. All but one farm were positive for at least one pathogen species, and 5 farms were positive for 3 species. Escherichia coli O157:H7 was detected on 6 farms and in all farm elements, including milk filters. Mycobacterium avium ssp. paratuberculosis was detected on 10 of 13 farms and in all farm elements except for milk filters. Salmonella enterica and C. jejuni were detected at lower frequencies and were not identified in soil, stream water, or milk filters on any of the 13 farms. Cryptosporidium parvum was detected in feces but not in stored manure. Stored manure had the highest occurrence of pathogens (73%), followed by feces (50%), milk filters, bedding, soil, and water (range from 23 to 31%). Association of pathogen presence with farm management factors was examined by t-test; however, the small number of study farms and samples may limit the scope of inference of the associations. Pathogens had a higher prevalence in maternity pen bedding than in calf bedding, but total pathogen occurrence did not differ in calf compared with lactating cow feces or in soils with or without manure incorporation. Herd size and animal density did not appear to have a consistent effect on pathogen occurrence. The extent of pathogen prevalence and distribution on the farms indicates considerable public health risks associated with not only milk and meat consumption and direct animal contact, but also potential dissemination of the pathogens into the agroecosystem.
TI  - A DNA microarray for the versatile diagnosis of infectious diarrhea.
AB  - Several bacteria, viruses, and parasites cause diarrhea as coinfecting pathogens. We designed a DNA microarray comprising 60-bp probes spotted 194 times for the multiplex detection of 33 enteropathogenic bacteria and seven enteropathogenic viruses, and the archaeon Methanobrevibacter smithii was used as an internal positive control. Nine pathogen-free stool specimens were used as negative controls. One of these control specimens was further spiked with Salmonella enterica as a positive control. The microarray was then tested with 40 pathological stool specimens, comprising S. enterica (n = 30), Campylobacter jejuni (n = 4), pathogenic Escherichia coli (n = 2), and adenovirus (n = 4). M. smithii was detected in 47/49 (95.9%) specimens, no pathogen was detected in negative controls and S. enterica was identified in the S. enterica-spiked positive control. The overall specificity was 100% and the overall sensitivity was 97.5% because one S. enterica sample was missed by the microarray. The multiplexed detection of C. jejuni spiked into an adenovirus-positive stool sample gave positive results, with fluorescence values of 14.3 and 9.1, respectively. These data indicate that using the protocol developed in this article, the DNA array allows for the multiplexed detection of some enteropathogens in stool samples.
TI  - Lateral transfer, vertical translocation, and survival of inoculated bacteria during moisture enhancement of pork.
AB  - Lateral transfer, vertical translocation, and survival of bacteria during moisture enhancement of pork were investigated under laboratory conditions. In the first experiment, a pork loin was surface inoculated with Escherichia coli biotype I and moisture enhanced with brine to 10%. After the inoculated loin had been injected, four uninoculated loins were processed in the same manner, without cleaning or sanitizing the injector equipment. Samples were collected from both the surface and the interior tissues of the pork loins. E. coli biotype I was transferred from the inoculated loins to both the exterior and interior of the uninoculated loins in this process. In the second experiment, pork loins were surface inoculated with E. coli biotype I and injected to 10, 20, and 30% of initial weight. After injection, E. coli biotype I was recovered from both the surface and the interior tissues in the pork loins, although there were no significant differences between injection levels. The third experiment was performed to examine the survival of Salmonella enterica Typhimurium and Campylobacter jejuni in recirculating brines. The brine used for injecting pork loins was inoculated with Salmonella Typhimurium or C. jejuni and then recirculated for 48 h at 4 or 10 degrees C. Samples were collected at specific time intervals, and the surviving populations of the organisms were determined. The populations of both bacteria declined by <1 log over 48 h, and there was no significant difference in populations between temperatures. The present study indicates the potential for cross-contamination of pork during moisture enhancement.
TI  - A culture-independent sequence-based metagenomics approach to the investigation of an outbreak of Shiga-toxigenic Escherichia coli O104:H4.
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Identification of the bacterium responsible for an outbreak can aid in disease management. However, traditional culture-based diagnosis can be difficult, particularly if no specific diagnostic test is available for an outbreak strain. OBJECTIVE: To explore the potential of metagenomics, which is the direct sequencing of DNA extracted from microbiologically complex samples, as an open-ended clinical discovery platform capable of identifying and characterizing bacterial strains from an outbreak without laboratory culture. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: In a retrospective investigation, 45 samples were selected from fecal specimens obtained from patients with diarrhea during the 2011 outbreak of Shiga-toxigenic Escherichia coli (STEC) O104:H4 in Germany. Samples were subjected to high-throughput sequencing (August-September 2012), followed by a 3-phase analysis (November 2012-February 2013). In phase 1, a de novo assembly approach was developed to obtain a draft genome of the outbreak strain. In phase 2, the depth of coverage of the outbreak strain genome was determined in each sample. In phase 3, sequences from each sample were compared with sequences from known bacteria to identify pathogens other than the outbreak strain. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The recovery of genome sequence data for the purposes of identification and characterization of the outbreak strain and other pathogens from fecal samples. RESULTS: During phase 1, a draft genome of the STEC outbreak strain was obtained. During phase 2, the outbreak strain genome was recovered from 10 samples at greater than 10-fold coverage and from 26 samples at greater than 1-fold coverage. Sequences from the Shiga-toxin genes were detected in 27 of 40 STEC-positive samples (67%). In phase 3, sequences from Clostridium difficile, Campylobacter jejuni, Campylobacter concisus, and Salmonella enterica were recovered. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These results suggest the potential of metagenomics as a culture-independent approach for the identification of bacterial pathogens during an outbreak of diarrheal disease. Challenges include improving diagnostic sensitivity, speeding up and simplifying workflows, and reducing costs.
TI  - Increased detection of invasive enteropathogenic bacteria in pre-incubated blood  culture materials by real-time PCR in comparison with automated incubation in Sub-Saharan Africa.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Invasive enteropathogenic bacteria can cause systemic infections. Data from studies with PCR detection suggest, at least for Salmonella enterica, that blood culture may lead to underestimation in the tropics. Corresponding data are lacking for other invasive enteropathogenic bacteria. We compared classical blood culture and molecular methods for the diagnosis of blood infections. METHODS: A real-time multiplex PCR for Salmonella spp., Shigella spp./entero- invasive Escherichia coli (EIEC), Yersinia spp., and Campylobacter jejuni was applied to 2321 retained blood culture samples from Ghanaian patients, after enrichment by automated culture. RESULTS: PCR detected Salmonella DNA in 56 out of 58 pre-incubated Ghanaian blood cultures with growth of S. enterica. In 2 samples molecular diagnosis was only possible after 1:10 dilution. Twenty-two samples negative by blood culture and 1 positive with Micrococcus spp. were PCR-positive for Salmonella spp. In addition, 3 Shigella spp./EIEC, 2 Yersinia spp., and 1 C. jejuni were detected by PCR but not by culture growth. CONCLUSIONS: Real-time PCR was more sensitive in identifying invasive enteropathogenic bacteria than automated blood culture, which is hampered by a lack of evidence-based standardization of pre-analytic conditions in the tropics. Primary agar culture and Gram-staining prior to automated blood culture is advisable in cases where transportation times are long.
TI  - Outbreaks associated to large open air festivals, including music festivals, 1980 to 2012.
AB  - In the minds of many, large scale open air festivals have become associated with  spring and summer, attracting many people, and in the case of music festivals, thousands of music fans. These festivals share the usual health risks associated with large mass gatherings, including transmission of communicable diseases and risk of outbreaks. Large scale open air festivals have however specific characteristics, including outdoor settings, on-site housing and food supply and the generally young age of the participants. Outbreaks at large scale open air festivals have been caused by Cryptosporium parvum, Campylobacter spp., Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, Shigella sonnei, Staphylococcus aureus, hepatitis A virus, influenza virus, measles virus, mumps virus and norovirus. Faecal-oral and respiratory transmissions of pathogens result from non-compliance with hygiene rules, inadequate sanitation and insufficient vaccination coverage. Sexual transmission of infectious diseases may also occur and is likely to be underestimated and underreported. Enhanced surveillance during and after festivals is essential. Preventive measures such as immunisations of participants and advice on-site and via social networks should be considered to reduce outbreaks at these large scale open air festivals.
TI  - Bacterial and viral etiology of childhood diarrhea in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diarrhea is the most frequent health problem among children in developing countries. This study investigated the bacterial and viral etiology and related clinical and epidemiological factors in children with acute diarrhea in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso. METHODS: Stool specimens were collected from 283 children under 5 years of age visiting hospital due to acute diarrhea and from 60 healthy controls of similar age. Pathogens were investigated by using conventional culture techniques, PCR and immunochromatographic testing. Salmonella and Shigella strains were serotyped and their susceptibility to 23 antimicrobial agents was determined by the agar dilution method. RESULTS: At least one pathogen was detected in 64% of the 283 patients and in 8% of the 60 controls (p < 0.001). Rotavirus was found in 30% of the patients, followed by diarrheagenic Escherichia coli (24%), Salmonella enterica ssp. enterica (9%), Shigella spp. (6%), adenovirus (5%) and Campylobacter spp. (2%). Multiple pathogens were found in 11% of the patients and in 2% of the controls (p = 0.028). Viruses were found mainly in children of </= 2 years of age, whereas bacteria were equally prevalent among all the age groups. Viral infections occurred mostly during the cool dry season and the bacterial infections during the rainy season. Fever (64%) and vomiting (61%) were the most common symptoms associated with diarrhea. Only one Salmonella strain was resistant to nalidixic acid and ciprofloxacin. Of the Shigella strains, one was resistant to nalidixic acid but 81% to trimethoprim- sulfamethoxazole, 63% to streptomycin and 50% to ampicillin. Most of all the other Salmonella and Shigella strains were sensitive to all antimicrobials tested. CONCLUSION: Rotaviruses and diarrheal E. coli were the most predominant pathogens associated with acute diarrhea in Burkinabe children. Constant antimicrobial surveillance is warranted to observe for the emergence of enteric bacteria resistant to antimicrobials that are important in treatment also of severe infections.
TI  - Quantitative multi-year elucidation of fecal sources of waterborne pathogen contamination in the South Nation River basin using bacteroidales microbial source tracking markers.
AB  - Over a seven-year period (2004-2010) 1095 water samples were obtained from the South Nation River basin at multiple watershed monitoring sites (Ontario, Canada). Real-time PCR using Bacteroidales specific markers was used to identify the origin (human (10% prevalence), ruminant (22%), pig (~2%), Canada goose (4%) and muskrat (7%)) of fecal pollution. In parallel, the distribution of fecal indicator bacteria and waterborne pathogens (Cryptosporidium oocysts, Giardia cysts, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella enterica and Campylobacter spp.) was evaluated. Associations between the detection of specific Bacteroidales markers and the presence of fecal indicator bacteria, pathogens, and distinct land use or environmental variables were evaluated. Linear correlations between Bacteroidales markers and fecal indicator bacteria were weak. However, mean marker densities, and the presence and absence of markers could be discriminated on the basis of threshold fecal indicator densities. The ruminant-specific Bacteroidales marker was the most frequently detected marker in water, consistent with the large number of dairy farms in the study area. Detection of the human or the ruminant markers were associated with a slightly higher risk of detecting S. enterica. Detection of the muskrat marker was related to more frequent Campylobacter spp. detections. Important positive associations between markers and pathogens were found among: i) total Bacteroidales and Cryptosporidium and Giardia, ii) ruminant marker and S. enterica, and iii) muskrat and Campylobacter spp.
TI  - Response of restraint stress-selected lines of Japanese quail to heat stress and  Escherichia coli challenge.
AB  - Japanese quail selected for divergent corticosterone response to restraint stress were evaluated for their susceptibility to heat stress and challenge with Escherichia coli. These quail lines are designated as high stress (HS), low stress (LS), and the random-bred control (CS) lines. Heat stress (35 degrees C, 8 h/d) began at 24 d until the end of the study at 39 d. Birds were challenged with an aerosol spray containing 2 x 10(9) cfu of E. coli at 25 and 32 d. At 38 d, the surviving birds were necropsied and the intestinal tract was screened for both Salmonella and Campylobacter. Body weights of the CS birds were higher than both HS and LS at 17, 25, and 32 d. At 32 d, there was no difference in mortality between males and females and the CS line had higher mortality compared with the LS line with the HS line being intermediate. At 38 d, females of the CS line that were both heat stressed and challenged had a mortality incidence of 25%, which was significantly higher than male birds of the same line and treatment (5.3%). There was an increased incidence in Salmonella enterica serotype Agona isolation after heat stress, with the LS birds having less isolation than the HS birds. Mean corticosterone levels of male birds were not significantly affected by line, heat stress, or E. coli challenge; however, the LS line subjected to heat stress had one-third the level of the HS line, a difference identical to that seen in the original selection for response to restraint stress.
TI  - Zoonotic fecal pathogens and antimicrobial resistance in county fair animals.
AB  - Livestock fairs present a unique opportunity for the public to experience close contact with animals, but may also expose people to zoonotic pathogens through contact with animal feces. The goal of this study was to screen cattle, sheep, goat, chicken, rabbit and horse feces from a livestock fair in California for the potentially zoonotic pathogens Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella, Campylobacter, Vibrio, Cryptosporidium and Giardia spp., as well as determining the level of antimicrobial resistance in E. coli and Salmonella. Notably, E. coli O157:H7 was reported for the first time in a pig at a county fair in California. Campylobacter jejuni as well as Salmonella enterica serovars Derby and Thompson were also isolated from pigs, cattle, sheep, goats or chickens, whereas horses and rabbits were negative for all target pathogens. The prevalence of antimicrobial resistance as well as multi-drug resistance patterns were highest for E. coli and Salmonella spp. cultured from pigs and chickens, were generally widespread but at lower levels for other animal groups, and included resistance to ampicillin and streptomycin, two antimicrobial drugs of importance for human medicine. This study provides data that highlight the importance of practicing good hygiene in livestock fair settings to avoid transmission of zoonotic microbes, particularly pathogens with antimicrobial resistance, to fair visitors and among animal populations.
TI  - Prevalence and characterization of foodborne pathogens in dairy cattle in the eastern part of Japan.
AB  - To investigate the prevalence and characterization of foodborne pathogens [Campylobacter spp., Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC), Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella spp.] in dairy cows, rectal content grab samples were collected from 250 dairy cows reared on 25 dairy farms in eastern Japan from December 2010 through February 2011. Campylobacter jejuni was isolated from 106 (42%) cows on 23 (92%) farms, STEC O157 from three cows on one farm, L. monocytogenes from three cows on another three farms and Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium from eight cows on another farm. STEC O26 was not isolated from any of the dairy farms investigated. The results suggest that C. jejuni is widespread in dairy farms in eastern Japan.
TI  - Engineering, conjugation, and immunogenicity assessment of Escherichia coli O121  O antigen for its potential use as a typhoid vaccine component.
AB  - State-of-the-art production technologies for conjugate vaccines are complex, multi-step processes. An alternative approach to produce glycoconjugates is based on the bacterial N-linked protein glycosylation system first described in Campylobacter jejuni. The C. jejuni N-glycosylation system has been successfully transferred into Escherichia coli, enabling in vivo production of customized recombinant glycoproteins. However, some antigenic bacterial cell surface polysaccharides, like the Vi antigen of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi, have not been reported to be accessible to the bacterial oligosaccharyltransferase PglB, hence hamper development of novel conjugate vaccines against typhoid fever. In this report, Vi-like polysaccharide structures that can be transferred by PglB were evaluated as typhoid vaccine components. A polysaccharide fulfilling these requirements was found in Escherichia coli serovar O121. Inactivation of the E. coli O121 O antigen cluster encoded gene wbqG resulted in expression of O polysaccharides reactive with antibodies raised against the Vi antigen. The structure of the recombinantly expressed mutant O polysaccharide was elucidated using a novel HPLC and mass spectrometry based method for purified undecaprenyl pyrophosphate (Und-PP) linked glycans, and the presence of epitopes also found in the Vi antigen was confirmed. The mutant O antigen structure was transferred to acceptor proteins using the bacterial N-glycosylation system, and immunogenicity of the resulting conjugates was evaluated in mice. The conjugate-induced antibodies reacted in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with E. coli O121 LPS. One animal developed a significant rise in serum immunoglobulin anti-Vi titer upon immunization.
TI  - Antibiotic susceptibility of Salmonella, Campylobacter coli, and Campylobacter jejuni isolated from Northern German fattening pigs.
AB  - This study was conducted to assess the antimicrobial susceptibility rate of Salmonella and Campylobacter spp. isolated from Northern German fattening pigs. From 540 lymph node samples, 16 Salmonella Typhimurium, 1 Salmonella Brandenburg, 37 Campylobacter coli, and 11 Campylobacter jejuni strains were isolated. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was carried out by the broth dilution method. The 14 tested antibiotics for Salmonella were ampicillin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, colistin, florfenicol, gentamicin, kanamycin, nalidixic acid, streptomycin, sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline, and trimethoprim. The eight tested antibiotics for Campylobacter spp. were ampicillin, ampicillin-sulbactam (2:1), ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, gentamicin, nalidixic acid, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (1:19), and tetracycline. In total, 93.7% (n = 16) of Salmonella Typhimurium, 75.7% (n = 37) of C. coli, and 54.5% (n = 11) of C. jejuni isolates were resistant to at least one of the tested antibiotics. Multiresistance to three antibiotics was observed in 75% of Salmonella Typhimurium, 16.2% of C. coli, and 0% of C. jejuni isolates. Pansusceptibility was detected in 6.3% of Salmonella Typhimurium, 24.3% of C. coli, and 45.5% of C. jejuni isolates. Multiresistance is defined as resistance to three or more antibiotics, and pansusceptibility is defined as not having resistance to any antibiotic. Regarding drugs of last resort--cefotaxime, ciprofloxacin, and nalidixic acid--resistance was not common among Salmonella (6.3%). The resistance rate of Campylobacter spp. to last-resort drugs--erythromycin, ciprofloxacin, and nalidixic acid--varied between species. The observed trend was not statistically significant. No C. coli isolates and few C. jejuni isolates (9.1%) were resistant to erythromycin. In contrast to C. jejuni, the C. coli isolates were more likely to be resistant to ciprofloxacin (9.1 and 18.9%, respectively) and nalidixic acid (0 and 13.5%, respectively). The same phenomenon was detected for tetracycline (27.3 and 62.2%, respectively), sulfamethoxazole (9.1 and 43.2%, respectively), and ampicillin (9.1 and 21.6%, respectively).
TI  - Quantification of bacterial indicators and zoonotic pathogens in dairy wastewater ponds.
AB  - Zoonotic pathogens in land-applied dairy wastewaters are a potential health risk. The occurrence and abundance of 10 pathogens and 3 fecal indicators were determined by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) in samples from 30 dairy wastewaters from southern Idaho. Samples tested positive for Campylobacter jejuni, stx(1)- and eaeA-positive Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis, and Salmonella enterica, with mean recoveries of genomic DNA corresponding to 10(2) to 10(4) cells ml(-1) wastewater. The most predominant organisms were C. jejuni and M. avium, being detected in samples from up to 21 and 29 of 30 wastewater ponds, respectively. The qPCR detection limits for the putative pathogens in the wastewaters ranged from 16 cells ml(-1) for M. avium to 1,689 oocysts ml(-1) for Cryptosporidium. Cryptosporidium and Giardia spp., Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, and pathogenic Leptospira spp. were not detected by qPCR.
TI  - Ranking the disease burden of 14 pathogens in food sources in the United States using attribution data from outbreak investigations and expert elicitation.
AB  - Understanding the relative public health impact of major microbiological hazards  across the food supply is critical for a risk-based national food safety system. This study was conducted to estimate the U.S. health burden of 14 major pathogens in 12 broad categories of food and to then rank the resulting 168 pathogen-food combinations. These pathogens examined were Campylobacter, Clostridium perfringens, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes, norovirus, Salmonella enterica, Toxoplasma gondii, and all other FoodNet pathogens. The health burden associated with each pathogen was measured using new estimates of the cost of illness and loss of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) from acute and chronic illness and mortality. A new method for attributing illness to foods was developed that relies on both outbreak data and expert elicitation. This method assumes that empirical data are generally preferable to expert judgment; thus, outbreak data were used for attribution except where evidence suggests that these data are considered not representative of food attribution. Based on evaluation of outbreak data, expert elicitation, and published scientific literature, outbreak-based attribution estimates for Campylobacter, Toxoplasma, Cryptosporidium, and Yersinia were determined not representative; therefore, expert-based attribution were included for these four pathogens. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the effect of attribution data assumptions on rankings. Disease burden was concentrated among a relatively small number of pathogen-food combinations. The top 10 pairs were responsible for losses of over $8 billion and 36,000 QALYs, or more than 50 % of the total across all pairs. Across all 14 pathogens, poultry, pork, produce, and complex foods were responsible for nearly 60 % of the total cost of illness and loss of QALYs.
TI  - Prevalence, antimicrobial resistance and relation to indicator and pathogenic microorganisms of Salmonella enterica isolated from surface waters within an agricultural landscape.
AB  - During a 12 month period (June 2007-May 2008), the prevalence and susceptibility  of Salmonella serovars and their relation to specific pathogenic and indicator bacteria in river and coastal waters was investigated. A total of 240 water samples were collected from selected sites in Acheron and Kalamas Rivers and the Ionian Sea coast in north western Greece. The samples were analyzed for Salmonella spp., Listeria spp., Campylobacter spp., Escherichia coli O157, Staphylococci, Pseudomonas spp., Total Coliforms, Fecal Coliforms, Fecal Streptococci, Total Heterotrophic Flora at 20 degrees C and at 37 degrees C, fungi and protozoa (Cryptosporidium, Giardia). Susceptibility tests to nine antimicrobials (ampicillin, amikacin, amoxicillin/clavulavic acid, cefuroxime, ciprofloxacin, cefoxitin, tetracycline, ticarcillin/clavulanic acid, ampicillin/sulbactam) were performed using the disk diffusion method for Salmonella isolates. We isolated 28 serovars of Salmonella spp. identified as Salmonella enteritidis (23), Salmonella thompson (3) and Salmonella virchow (2). Multi-drug resistant Salmonella serovars were isolated from both river and marine waters, with 34.8% of S. enteritidis and 100% of S. virchow being resistant to more than 3 antibiotics. Also we isolated 42 strains of Listeria spp. identified as L. monocytogenes (20), L. innocua (9), L. seeligeri (2) and L. ivanovii (11). All the Listeria isolates were susceptible to the tested antibiotics. No Campylobacter spp., E. coli O157, Cryptosporidium and Giardia were detected. The overall ranges (and average counts) of the indicator bacteria were: Total Coliforms 0-4x10(4)cfu/100ml (3.7x10(3)cfu/100ml), Fecal Coliforms 0-9x10(3)cfu/100ml (9.2x10(2)cfu/100ml), Fecal Streptococci 0-3.5x10(4)cfu/100ml (1.4x10(3)cfu/100ml), Total Heterotrophic Flora at 20 degrees C 0-6x10(3)cfu/ml (10(3)cfu/ml) and at 37 degrees C 0-5x10(3)cfu/ml (4.9x10(2)cfu/ml). Weak or non significant positive Spearman correlations (p<0.05, rs range: 0.13-0.77) were obtained between Salmonella, Listeria, fungi and indicator bacteria. The results underline the complexity of the interrelations between pathogens and indicator bacteria, and the necessity to assess the presence of resistant bacteria in the aquatic environments.
TI  - Surface-immobilization of chromatographically purified bacteriophages for the optimized capture of bacteria.
AB  - Bacteriophages offer interesting alternatives to antibodies for the specific capture and detection of pathogenic bacteria onto biosensing surfaces. Procedures for the optimal chemical immobilization of lytic bacteriophages onto surfaces are presented. More specifically, the removal of lysate contaminants from bacteriophage suspensions by size exclusion chromatography significantly increases the resultant planar surface density of immobilized bacteriophages. E. coli T4 and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium P22 phage systems seem to undergo highly heterogeneous adsorption to the surface, possibly explaining the observed phage clustering at higher surface densities. The T4 phage and its E. coli host were initially employed as a model system where we discovered an optimal planar surface density of phages for best bacterial capture: 18.9 +/- 0.8 phages/mum(2) capturing 18.0 +/- 0.3 bacteria/100 mum(2). Phage surface clustering ultimately limits the T4 phage-immobilized surface's ability to specifically capture its host bacteria. Nevertheless, this is to our knowledge the largest surface capture density of E. coli reported using intact T4 bacteriophages. Two additional purified bacteriophage systems (P22 and Campylobacter jejuni phage NCTC 12673) were then similarly studied for their ability to capture their corresponding host bacteria (Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium and Campylobacter jejuni respectively) on a surface.
TI  - Prevalence of human pathogens and indicators in stormwater runoff in Brisbane, Australia.
AB  - Elevated numbers of enteric pathogens in the receiving waters following a storm event can be a serious public health concern. The purpose of this study was to conduct a preliminary investigation into the presence of human pathogens of concern in urban stormwater runoff. The involvement of a human sewage as a potential source of contamination was also investigated by using microbial source tracking methods. Water samples (20 L) were collected after storm events and during the dry weather from six sites in Brisbane, Australia. Collected samples were analyzed for fecal indicator bacteria (FIB), and then concentrated using hollow fiber ultrafiltration followed by molecular detection of selected enteric pathogens. The levels of FIB were found to frequently exceed the upper limit of Australian guidelines for managing risks in recreational water, during the dry periods and by further several orders of magnitude in the stormwater runoff. Enterococcus spp. numbers as high as 3x10(4) 100 mL(-1) were detected in the stormwater runoff at the Fitzgibbon site. Human adenovirus and polyomavirus were frequently detected from all six sampling sites during wet and dry weather conditions suggesting their wide spread presence in the urban aquatic environments. Campylobacter jejuni, Campylobacter coli and Salmonella enterica were also detected during both dry and wet weather conditions. Presence of human-specific HF183 Bacteroides marker in most of the samples tested suggests ubiquitous sewage contamination in the urban environment. Since stormwater runoff routinely contains high numbers of FIB and other enteric pathogens, some degree of treatment of captured stormwater would be required if it were to be used for non-potable purposes.
TI  - High incidence of Campylobacter concisus in gastroenteritis in North Jutland, Denmark: a population-based study.
AB  - The incidence of non-thermophilic Campylobacter species was assessed in an unselected population-based study in a mixed urban and rural community in North Jutland, Denmark. In a 2-year study period, 11,314 faecal samples from 8302 patients with gastroenteritis were cultured with supplement of the filter method. We recovered a high incidence of Campylobacter concisus (annual incidence 35/100,000 inhabitants), almost as high as the common Campylobacter jejuni/coli. In contrast, there was a very low incidence of other non-thermophilic Campylobacter species, such as Campylobacter upsaliensis. Campylobacter concisus was, unlike C. jejuni/coli, found more frequently among small children (<1 year) and the elderly (>/= 65 years). Around 10% of the patients with C. consisus had co-infections dominated by Clostridium difficile and Salmonella enterica, whereas co-infections occurred in about 5% of C. jejuni/coli patients. We observed a seasonal variation in C. jejuni/coli with a peak incidence in late summer months and autumn, whereas there was an almost constant monthly prevalence of C. concisus. Among patients participating in a questionnaire sub-study, there was a higher degree of close contacts with animals, especially dogs, as well as a higher travel exposure among C. jejuni/coli patients compared with C. concisus patients. We did not culture any C. concisus in stool samples from a small cohort of healthy individuals. Future studies have to focus on the clinical follow-up and the long-term risk of inflammatory bowel diseases in C. concisus-positive patients. We conclude that there is a high incidence of C. concisus in Denmark.
TI  - High pressure inactivation of Escherichia coli, Campylobacter jejuni, and spoilage microbiota on poultry meat.
AB  - This study evaluated the high pressure inactivation of Campylobacter jejuni, Escherichia coli, and poultry meat spoilage organisms. All treatments were performed in aseptically prepared minced poultry meat. Treatment of 19 strains of C. jejuni at 300 MPa and 30 degrees C revealed a large variation of pressure resistance. The recovery of pressure-induced sublethally injured C. jejuni depended on the availability of iron. The addition of iron content to enumeration media was required for resuscitation of sublethally injured cells. Survival of C. jejuni during storage of refrigerated poultry meat was analyzed in fresh and pressuretreated poultry meat, and in the presence or absence of spoilage microbiota. The presence of spoilage microbiota did not significantly influence the survival of C. jejuni. Pressure treatment at 400 MPa and 40 degrees C reduced cell counts of Brochothrix thermosphacta, Carnobacterium divergens, C. jejuni, and Pseudomonas fluorescens to levels below the detection limit. Cell counts of E. coli AW1.7, however, were reduced by only 3.5 log (CFU/g) and remained stable during subsequent refrigerated storage. The resistance to treatment at 600 MPa and 40 degrees C of E. coli AW1.7 was compared with Salmonella enterica, Shiga toxin-producing E. coli and nonpathogenic E. coli strains, and Staphylococcus spp. Cell counts of all organisms except E. coli AW 1.7 were reduced by more than 6 log CFU/g. Cell counts of E. coli AW1.7 were reduced by 4.5 log CFU/g only. Moreover, the ability of E. coli AW1.7 to resist pressure was comparable to the pressure-resistant mutant E. coli LMM1030. Our results indicate that preservation of fresh meat requires a combination of high pressure with high temperature (40 to 60 degrees C) or other antimicrobial hurdles.
TI  - Foodborne and waterborne infections in elderly community and long-term care facility residents,Victoria, Australia.
AB  - We calculated rates of foodborne and waterborne infections reported to the health department in Victoria, Australia, during 2000-2009 for elderly residents of long-term care facilities (LTCFs) and the community. We used negative binomial regression to estimate incidence rate ratios, adjusting for age, sex, and reporting period. We analyzed 8,277 infections in elderly persons. Rates of campylobacteriosis, legionellosis, listeriosis, toxigenic Escherichia coli infections, and shigellosis were higher in community residents, and rates of Salmonella infection were higher in LTCF residents. Each year, 61.7 Campylobacter infections were reported per 100,000 LTCF residents, compared with 97.6 per 100,000 community residents. LTCF residents were at higher risk for S. enterica serotype Typhimurium associated with outbreaks. Rates of foodborne infections (except salmonellosis) were similar to or lower for LTCF residents than for community residents. These findings may indicate that food preparation practices in LTCFs are safer than those used by elderly persons in the community.
TI  - Investigation of chemical rinses suitable for very small meat plants to reduce pathogens on beef surfaces.
AB  - Numerous antimicrobial interventions are capable of reducing the prevalence of harmful bacteria on raw meat products. There is a need to identify effective and inexpensive antimicrobial interventions that could, in practice, be used in very small meat plants because of limited financial, space, and labor resources. Eight antimicrobial compounds (acetic acid, citric acid, lactic acid, peroxyacetic acid, acidified sodium chlorite, chlorine dioxide, sodium hypochlorite, and aqueous ozone) were applied at various concentrations with small, hand-held spraying equipment, and bactericidal effectiveness was examined. Beef plate pieces were inoculated with fecal slurry containing a pathogen cocktail (Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella Typhimurium, Campylobacter coli, and Campylobacter jejuni) and natural populations of aerobic plate counts, coliforms, and E. coli. Antimicrobial solutions were applied to beef surfaces via a portable, pressurized hand-held spray tank, and treated surfaces were subjected to appropriate methods for the enumeration and isolation of pathogens and hygiene indicators. Relative antimicrobial effectiveness was determined (from greatest to least): (i) organic acids, (ii) peroxyacetic acid, (iii) chlorinated compounds, and (iv) aqueous ozone. Using the equipment described, a 2% lactic acid rinse provided 3.5- to 6.4-log CFU/cm(2) reductions across all bacterial populations studied. Conversely, aqueous ozone yielded 0.02- to 2.9-log CFU/cm(2) reductions in pathogens and hygiene indicators, and did not differ significantly from a control tap water rinse (P = 0.055 to 0.731). This 2% lactic acid rinse will be subsequently combined with a previously described water wash to create a multistep antimicrobial intervention that will be examined under laboratory conditions and validated in very small meat plants.
TI  - Spatial and temporal drivers of zoonotic pathogen contamination of an agricultural watershed.
AB  - In regions where animal agriculture is prominent, such as southern Alberta, higher rates of gastrointestinal illness have been reported when compared with nonagricultural regions. This difference in the rate of illness is thought to be a result of increased zoonotic pathogen exposure through environmental sources such as water. In this study, temporal and spatial factors associated with bacterial pathogen contamination of the Oldman River, which transverses this region, were analyzed using classification and regression tree analysis. Significantly higher levels of fecal indicators; more frequent isolations of Campylobacter spp., Escherichia coli O157:H7, and Salmonella enterica spp.; and higher rates of detection of pig-specific Bacteroides markers occurred at downstream sites than at upstream sites, suggesting additive stream inputs. Fecal indicator densities were also significantly higher when any one of these three bacterial pathogens was present and where there were higher total animal manure units; however, occasionally pathogens were present when fecal indicator levels were low or undetectable. Overall, Salmonella spp., Campylobacter spp., and E. coli O157:H7 presence was associated with season, animal manure units, and total rainfall on the day of sampling and 3 d in advance of sampling. Several of the environmental variables analyzed in this study appear to influence pathogen prevalence and therefore may be useful in predicting water quality and safety and in the improvement of watershed management practices in this and other agricultural regions.
TI  - Long-term trends in the epidemiology and resistance of childhood bacterial enteropathogens in Crete.
AB  - In this study, we investigated the long-term trends in the epidemiology and susceptibility of bacterial enteropathogens among children in a well-defined area of adequate health standards. The study included all children younger than 14 years of age treated for enteritis at Heraklion University General Hospital on the island of Crete during the 18-year period from January 1993 to December 2010. Stool specimens were tested for Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC), Yersinia, and Aeromonas species. Of the 33,032 stool samples from patients of any age, 2,912 (8.82%) were positive for bacterial enteropathogens. The 1,597 isolates from children were identified as S. enterica (42.3%), Campylobacter spp. (33.6%), EPEC (17.4%), Y. enterocolitica (5.82%), A. hydrophila (0.44%), and Shigella spp. (0.38%). A decline in prevalence was observed for all bacterial enteropathogens. Taken as a total, enteropathogens were susceptible to gentamicin, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, co-trimoxazole, and amoxicillin in 98.8%, 88.0%, 83.0%, 67.1%, and 59.6%, respectively. During the study period, the susceptibility rates decreased for co-trimoxazole (p<0.0001) and ciprofloxacin (p<0.001), and increased for amoxicillin (p<0.0001). Our findings suggest declining long-term trends in the prevalence of bacterial enteropathogens and changes in susceptibility rates to first-line antibacterial agents. These changing trends in the long-term morbidity and susceptibility call for ongoing surveillance and tailored management.
TI  - Fate of pathogens in a simulated bioreduction system for livestock carcasses.
AB  - The EU Animal By-Products Regulations generated the need for novel methods of storage and disposal of dead livestock. Bioreduction prior to rendering or incineration has been proposed as a practical and potentially cost-effective method; however, its biosecurity characteristics need to be elucidated. To address this, Salmonella enterica (serovars Senftenberg and Poona), Enterococcus faecalis, Campylobacter jejuni, Campylobacter coli and a lux-marked strain of Escherichia coli O157 were inoculated into laboratory-scale bioreduction vessels containing sheep carcass constituents. Numbers of all pathogens and the metabolic activity of E. coli O157 decreased significantly within the liquor waste over time, and only E. faecalis remained detectable after 3months. Only very low numbers of Salmonella spp. and E. faecalis were detected in bioaerosols, and only at initial stages of the trial. These results further indicate that bioreduction represents a suitable method of storing and reducing the volume of livestock carcasses prior to ultimate disposal.
TI  - Prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibility of major foodborne pathogens in imported seafood.
AB  - Seafood is a leading commodity implicated in foodborne disease outbreaks in the United States. Seafood importation rose dramatically in the past 3 decades and now contributes to more than 80% of the total U.S. seafood supply. However, limited data are available on the microbiological safety of imported seafood. In this study, we obtained a total of 171 salmon, shrimp, and tilapia samples imported from 12 countries in three retail stores in Baton Rouge, LA. The total microbial population and the prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibilities of six major foodborne-pathogen genera (Campylobacter, Escherichia coli, Listeria, Salmonella, Shigella, and Vibrio) were determined. The aerobic plate counts (APC) for the 171 samples averaged 4.96 log CFU/g, with samples from Chile carrying the highest mean APC of 6.53 log CFU/g and fresh samples having a significantly higher mean APC than frozen ones (P < 0.0001). There were 27 samples (15.8%) with unacceptable microbiological quality (APC > 7 log CFU/g). By culture, no sample tested positive for Campylobacter coli, Shigella, or Vibrio vulnificus. Campylobacter jejuni and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium were each recovered once from farm-raised tilapia from China. By PCR, 17.5 and 32.2% of the samples were positive for Salmonella and Shigella, respectively. The overall prevalence rates of other target bacteria were low, ranging from 4.1% for Listeria monocytogenes to 9.4% for E. coli. All of the Vibrio parahaemolyticus isolates recovered were from shrimp, and 63.3% showed intermediate resistance to ampicillin. Both C. jejuni isolates possessed a rare resistance to gentamicin, while 75% of L. monocytogenes isolates were resistant to nitrofurantoin. Taken together, these findings suggest potential food safety hazards associated with imported seafood and warrant further large-scale studies.
TI  - Associations among pathogenic bacteria, parasites, and environmental and land use factors in multiple mixed-use watersheds.
AB  - Over a five year period (2004-08), 1171 surface water samples were collected from up to 24 sampling locations representing a wide range of stream orders, in a river basin in eastern Ontario, Canada. Water was analyzed for Cryptosporidium oocysts and Giardia cyst densities, the presence of Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica, Campylobacter spp., Listeria monocytogenes, and Escherichia coli O157:H7. The study objective was to explore associations among pathogen densities/occurrence and objectively defined land use, weather, hydrologic, and water quality variables using CART (Classification and Regression Tree) and binary logistical regression techniques. E. coli O157:H7 detections were infrequent, but detections were related to upstream livestock pasture density; 20% of the detections were located where cattle have access to the watercourses. The ratio of detections:non-detections for Campylobacter spp. was relatively higher (>1) when mean air temperatures were 6% below mean study period temperature values (relatively cooler periods). Cooler water temperatures, which can promote bacteria survival and represent times when land applications of manure typically occur (spring and fall), may have promoted increased frequency of Campylobacter spp. Fifty-nine percent of all Salmonella spp. detections occurred when river discharge on a branch of the river system of Shreve stream order = 9550 was >83 percentile. Hydrological events that promote off farm/off field/in stream transport must manifest themselves in order for detection of Salmonella spp. to occur in surface water in this region. Fifty seven percent of L. monocytogenes detections occurred in spring, relative to other seasons. It was speculated that a combination of winter livestock housing, silage feeding during winter, and spring application of manure that accrued during winter, contributed to elevated occurrences of this pathogen in spring. Cryptosporidium and Giardia oocyst and cyst densities were, overall, positively associated with surface water discharge, and negatively associated with air/water temperature during spring-summer-fall. Yet, some of the highest Cryptosporidium oocyst densities were associated with low discharge conditions on smaller order streams, suggesting wildlife as a contributing fecal source. Fifty six percent of all detections of >/= 2 bacteria pathogens (including Campylobacter spp., Salmonella spp., and E. coli O157:H7) in water was associated with lower water temperatures (< approximately 14 degrees C; primarily spring and fall) and when total rainfall the week prior to sampling was > approximately 27 mm (62 percentile). During higher water temperatures (> approximately 14 degrees C), a higher amount of weekly rainfall was necessary to promote detection of >/= 2 pathogens (primarily summer; weekly rainfall approximately >42 mm (>77 percentile); 15% of all >/= 2 detections). Less rainfall may have been necessary to mobilize pathogens from adjacent land, and/or in stream sediments, during cooler water conditions; as these are times when manures are applied to fields in the area, and soil water contents and water table depths are relatively higher. Season, stream order, turbidity, mean daily temperature, surface water discharge, cropland coverage, and nearest upstream distance to a barn and pasture were variables that were relatively strong and recurrent with regard to discriminating pathogen presence and absence, and parasite densities in surface water in the region.
TI  - Food-specific attribution of selected gastrointestinal illnesses: estimates from  a Canadian expert elicitation survey.
AB  - The study used a structured expert elicitation survey to derive estimates of food-specific attribution for nine illnesses caused by enteric pathogens in Canada. It was based on a similar survey conducted in the United States and focused on Campylobacter spp., Escherichia coli O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes, nontyphoidal Salmonella enterica, Shigella spp., Vibrio spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, Cryptosporidium parvum, and Norwalk-like virus. A snowball approach was used to identify food safety experts within Canada. Survey respondents provided background information as well as self-assessments of their expertise for each pathogen and the 12 food categories. Depending on the pathogen, food source attribution estimates were based on responses from between 10 and 35 experts. For each pathogen, experts divided their estimates of total foodborne illness across 12 food categories and they provided a best estimate for each category as well as 5th and 95th percentile limits for foods considered to be vehicles. Their responses were treated as triangular probability distributions, and linear aggregation was used to combine the opinions of each group of experts for each pathogen-food source group. Across the 108 pathogen-food groups, a majority of experts agreed on 30 sources and 48 nonsources for illness. The number of food groups considered to be pathogen sources by a majority of experts varied by pathogen from a low of one food source for Vibrio spp. (seafood) and C. parvum (produce) to a high of seven food sources for Salmonella spp. Beta distributions were fitted to the aggregated opinions and were reasonable representations for most of the pathogen-food group attributions. These results will be used to quantitatively assess the burden of foodborne illness in Canada as well as to analyze the uncertainty in our estimates.
TI  - Evaluation of low-copy genetic targets for waterborne bacterial pathogen detection via qPCR.
AB  - Recent developments in water quality research have highlighted difficulties in accurately predicting the incidence of pathogens within freshwater based on the viability, culturability and metabolic activity of indicator organisms. QPCR-driven assays are candidates to replace standard culture-based methods, however, protocols suitable for routine use have yet to be sufficiently validated. The objective of this study was to evaluate five oligonucleotide primers sets (ETIR, SINV, exoT, VS1 and ipaH2) for their potential applicability in qPCR assays to detect contamination from five waterborne bacterial pathogens (Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella Typhimurium, Campylobacter jejuni, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Shigella flexneri). An enrichment-free qPCR protocol was also tested using S. Typhimurium-seeded source water, combining membrane filtration and mechanical, chemical and enzymatic lysis techniques to recover the bacterial cells. All five primer sets were found to have high specificity and sensitivity for the tested organisms. Four of the primers were able to detect pathogen loads as low as 10 cells/mL while 200 cells/mL of C. jejuni were detectable in pure culture. Although sensitivity decreased in an artificially contaminated environmental matrix, it was still possible to detect as few as 10 S. Typhimurium cells without enrichment. The primers and protocols evaluated in this study have demonstrated potential for further validation for possible application alongside traditional indicator techniques.
TI  - Efficacy of UV light treatment for the microbiological decontamination of chicken, associated packaging, and contact surfaces.
AB  - UV light was investigated for the decontamination of raw chicken, associated packaging, and contact surfaces. The UV susceptibilities of a number of Campylobacter isolates (seven Campylobacter jejuni isolates and three Campylobacter coli isolates), Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, and Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis ATCC 10376 in liquid media were also investigated. From an initial level of 7 log CFU/ml, no viable Campylobacter cells were detected following exposure to the most intense UV dose (0.192 J/cm(2)) in liquid media (skim milk subjected to ultrahigh-temperature treatment and diluted 1:4 with maximum recovery diluent). Maximum reductions of 4.8 and 6.2 log CFU/ml were achieved for E. coli and serovar Enteritidis, respectively, in liquid media. Considerable differences in susceptibilities were found between the Campylobacter isolates examined, with variations of up to 4 log CFU/ml being observed. UV treatment of raw chicken fillet (0.192 J/cm(2)) reduced C. jejuni, E. coli, serovar Enteritidis, total viable counts, and Enterobacteriaceae by 0.76, 0.98, 1.34, 1.76, and 1.29 log CFU/g, respectively. Following UV treatment of packaging and surface materials, reductions of up to 3.97, 4.50, and 4.20 log CFU/cm(2) were obtained for C. jejuni, E. coli, and serovar Enteritidis, respectively (P < 0.05). Overall, the color of UV-treated chicken was not significantly affected (P >/= 0.05). The findings of this study indicate that Campylobacter is susceptible to UV technology and that differences in sensitivities exist between investigated isolates. Overall, UV could be used for improving the microbiological quality of raw chicken and for decontaminating associated packaging and surface materials.
TI  - Sensitive quantification of Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella enterica , and Campylobacter jejuni by combining stopped polymerase chain reaction with chemiluminescence flow-through DNA microarray analysis.
AB  - Rapid analysis of pathogenic bacteria is essential for food and water control to  preserve the public health. Therefore, we report on a chemiluminescence (CL) flow-through DNA microarray assay for the rapid and sensitive quantification of the pathogenic bacteria Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella enterica , and Campylobacter jejuni in water. Using the stopped polymerase chain reaction (PCR) strategy, the amount of amplified target DNA was strongly dependent on the applied cell concentration. The amplification was stopped at the logarithmic phase of the PCR to quantify the DNA products on the DNA microarray chip. The generation of single-stranded DNA sequences is essential for DNA hybridization assays on microarrays. Therefore, the DNA strands of the PCR products were separated by streptavidin-conjugated magnetic nanoparticles. This was achieved by introducing a reverse primer labeled with biotin together with a digoxigenin labeled forward primer for CL microarray imaging. A conjugate of an antidigoxigenin antibody and horseradish peroxidase recognized the digoxigenin-labeled antistrands bound to the probes on the microarray surface and catalyzed the reaction of luminol and hydrogen peroxide. The generated light emission was recorded by a sensitive charge-coupled device (CCD) camera. The quantification was conducted by a flow-through CL microarray readout system. The DNA microarrays were based on an NHS-activated poly(ethylene glycol)-modified glass substrate. The DNA probes which have the same DNA sequence as the reverse primer were immobilized on this surface. The full assay was characterized by spiking experiments with heat-inactivated bacteria in water. The total assay time was 3.5 h, and the detection limits determined on CL microarrays were for E. coli O157:H7, S. enterica , and C. jejuni 136, 500, and 1 cell/mL, respectively. The results of the DNA microarray assay were comparable to the SYBR green-based assays analyzed with a real-time PCR device. The advantage of the new microarray analysis method is seen in the ability of a high multiplex degree on DNA microarrays, the high specificity of DNA hybridization on DNA microarrays, and the possibility to get quantitative results on an automated CL flow-through microarray analysis system.
TI  - Related antimicrobial resistance genes detected in different bacterial species co-isolated from swine fecal samples.
AB  - A potential factor leading to the spread of antimicrobial resistance (AR) in bacteria is the horizontal transfer of resistance genes between bacteria in animals or their environment. To investigate this, swine fecal samples were collected on-farm and cultured for Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, Campylobacter spp., and Enterococcus spp. which are all commonly found in swine. Forty-nine of the samples from which all four bacteria were recovered were selected yielding a total of 196 isolates for analysis. Isolates were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility followed by hybridization to a DNA microarray designed to detect 775 AR-related genes. E. coli and Salmonella isolated from the same fecal sample had the most AR genes in common among the four bacteria. Genes detected encoded resistance to aminoglycosides (aac(3), aadA1, aadB, and strAB), beta-lactams (ampC, ampR, and bla(TEM)), chloramphenicols (cat and floR), sulfanillic acid (sul1/sulI), tetracyclines (tet(A), tet(D), tet(C), tet(G), and tet(R)), and trimethoprim (dfrA1 and dfh). Campylobacter coli and Enterococcus isolated from the same sample frequently had tet(O) and aphA-3 genes detected in common. Almost half (47%) of E. coli and Salmonella isolated from the same fecal sample shared resistance genes at a significant level (chi(2), p < 0.0000001). These data suggest that there may have been horizontal exchange of AR genes between these bacteria or there may be a common source of AR genes in the swine environment for E. coli and Salmonella.
TI  - Five commercial DNA extraction systems tested and compared on a stool sample collection.
AB  - In this study, 5 different commercial DNA extraction systems were tested on a stool sample collection containing 81 clinical stool specimens that were culture-positive for diarrheagenic Escherichia coli, Campylobacter jejuni, Salmonella enterica, or Clostridium difficile. The purified DNAs were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) directed toward the relevant organisms. The results showed that conventional PCR combined with the extraction systems BioRobot EZ1 (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), Bugs'n Beads (Genpoint, Oslo, Norway), ChargeSwitch (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK), QIAamp Stool Mini Kit (Qiagen), and 2 protocols (generic and Specific A) for EasyMag (BioMerieux, Marcy I'Etoile, France) were able to identify 89%, 62%, 85%, 88%, 85%, and 91%, respectively, of the pathogens originally identified by conventional culture-based methods. When TaqMan PCR was combined with the EasyMag Specific A protocol, 99% of the samples were correctly identified. The results demonstrate that the extraction efficiencies can vary significantly among different extraction systems, careful optimization may have a significant positive effect, and the use of sensitive and specific detection methods like TaqMan PCR is an ideal choice for this type of analysis.
TI  - Inhibitory spectra and modes of antimicrobial action of gallotannins from mango kernels (Mangifera indica L.).
AB  - This study investigated the antimicrobial activities and modes of action of penta-, hexa-, hepta-, octa-, nona-, and deca-O-galloylglucose (gallotannins) isolated from mango kernels. The MICs and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) against food-borne bacteria and fungi were determined using a critical dilution assay. Gram-positive bacteria were generally more susceptible to gallotannins than were Gram-negative bacteria. The MICs of gallotannins against Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium botulinum, Campylobacter jejuni, Listeria monocytogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus were 0.2 g liter(-1) or less; enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica were inhibited by 0.5 to 1 g liter(-1), and lactic acid bacteria were resistant. The use of lipopolysaccharide mutants of S. enterica indicated that the outer membrane confers resistance toward gallotannins. Supplementation of LB medium with iron eliminated the inhibitory activity of gallotannins against Staphylococcus aureus, and siderophore-deficient mutants of S. enterica were less resistant toward gallotannins than was the wild-type strain. Hepta-O-galloylglucose sensitized Lactobacillus plantarum TMW1.460 to hop extract, indicating inactivation of hop resistance mechanisms, e.g., the multidrug resistance (MDR) transporter HorA. Carbohydrate metabolism of Lactococcus lactis MG1363, a conditionally respiring organism, was influenced by hepta-O-galloylglucose when grown under aerobic conditions and in the presence of heme but not under anaerobic conditions, indicating that gallotannins influence the respiratory chain. In conclusion, the inhibitory activities of gallotannins are attributable to their strong affinity for iron and likely additionally relate to the inactivation of membrane-bound proteins.
TI  - Antibacterial activity and mechanism of action of zinc oxide nanoparticles against Campylobacter jejuni.
AB  - The antibacterial effect of zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles on Campylobacter jejuni was investigated for inhibition and inactivation of cell growth. The results showed that C. jejuni was extremely sensitive to treatment with ZnO nanoparticles. The MIC of ZnO nanoparticles for C. jejuni was determined to be 0.05 to 0.025 mg/ml, which is 8- to 16-fold lower than that for Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis and Escherichia coli O157:H7 (0.4 mg/ml). The action of ZnO nanoparticles against C. jejuni was determined to be bactericidal, not bacteriostatic. Scanning electron microscopy examination revealed that the majority of the cells transformed from spiral shapes into coccoid forms after exposure to 0.5 mg/ml of ZnO nanoparticles for 16 h, which is consistent with the morphological changes of C. jejuni under other stress conditions. These coccoid cells were found by ethidium monoazide-quantitative PCR (EMA-qPCR) to have a certain level of membrane leakage. To address the molecular basis of ZnO nanoparticle action, a large set of genes involved in cell stress response, motility, pathogenesis, and toxin production were selected for a gene expression study. Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) showed that in response to treatment with ZnO nanoparticles, the expression levels of two oxidative stress genes (katA and ahpC) and a general stress response gene (dnaK) were increased 52-, 7-, and 17-fold, respectively. These results suggest that the antibacterial mechanism of ZnO nanoparticles is most likely due to disruption of the cell membrane and oxidative stress in Campylobacter.
TI  - Multiplex PCR assay for the detection and quantification of Campylobacter spp., Escherichia coli O157:H7, and Salmonella serotypes in water samples.
AB  - Three pathogens, Campylobacter, Salmonella, and Shiga-toxin-producing Escherichia coli, are leading causes of bacterial gastroenteritis in the United States and worldwide. Although these three bacteria are typically considered food-borne pathogens, outbreaks have been reported due to contaminated drinking water and irrigation water. The aim of this research was to develop two types of PCR assays that could detect and quantify three pathogens, Campylobacter spp., E. coli O157:H7, and Salmonella spp., in watershed samples. In conventional PCR, three target strains were detected by multiplex PCR (m-PCR) using each specific primer pair simultaneously. Under optimized m-PCR conditions, the assay produced a 90-bp product for Campylobacter jejuni, a 150-bp product for E. coli O157:H7, and a 262-bp product for Salmonella Typhimurium, and the limitation of detection was approximately 700 copies for all three bacteria. In addition, real-time PCR was performed to quantify the three pathogens using SYBR green fluorescence. The assay was designed so that each target had a different melting temperature [C. jejuni (80.1 degrees C), E. coli O157:H7 (83.3 degrees C), and S. Typhimurium (85.9 degrees C)]. Therefore, this system could quantify and distinguish three pathogens simultaneously in a single reaction.
TI  - Induction of cytokine formation by human intestinal bacteria in gut epithelial cell lines.
AB  - AIMS: To investigate the effects of human gut micro-organisms on cytokine production by human intestinal cell lines. METHODS AND RESULTS: Quantitative real-time PCR assays were developed to measure the production of pro-inflammatory (IL-1alpha, IL-6, IL-18 and TNFalpha) and anti-inflammatory (TGF-beta1, TGF-beta2, TGF-beta3, IL-4 and IL-10) cytokines in HT-29 and Caco-2 cell lines. They were co-cultured with a range of mucosal bacteria isolated from ulcerative colitis patients, together with lactobacilli and bifidobacteria obtained from healthy people. HT-29 cells were also co-cultured with Campylobacter jejuni, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), enteropathogenic E. coli and Salmonella typhimurium. The majority of commensal bacteria tested suppressed the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokine mRNA, increased IL-18, reduced IL-1alpha, and with the exception of nonpathogenic E. coli, reduced TNF-alpha. All overtly pathogenic species increased both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokine mRNA. CONCLUSION: Commensal and pathogenic species induced fundamentally different cytokine responses in human intestinal epithelial cell lines. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Interactions between commensal bacteria tested in this study and the innate immune system were shown to be anti-inflammatory in nature, in contrast to the pathogenic organisms investigated. These data contribute towards our understanding of how potential probiotic species can be used to suppress the pro-inflammatory response in inflammatory bowel disease.
TI  - Molecular subtypes of Campylobacter spp., Salmonella enterica, and Escherichia coli O157:H7 isolated from faecal and surface water samples in the Oldman River watershed, Alberta, Canada.
AB  - Campylobacter spp., Salmonella enterica, and Escherichia coli O157:H7 isolated from 898 faecal, 43 sewage, and 342 surface water samples from the Oldman River were characterized using bacterial subtyping methods in order to investigate potential sources of contamination of the watershed. Among these pathogens, Campylobacter spp. were the most frequently isolated from faecal, sewage, and surface water samples (266/895, 11/43, and 91/342, respectively), followed by Salmonella (67/898, 8/43, and 29/342, respectively), and E. coli O157:H7 (16/898, 2/43, and 8/342, respectively). Salmonella Rubislaw was the most common serovar isolated from water. This serovar was also isolated from two wild bird species. Most other serovars isolated from water were either not isolated from animals or were isolated from multiple species. E. coli O157:H7 was predominantly isolated from cattle. The most common phage-types of this pathogen from cattle were also the most common among water isolates, and there were exact pulsed field gel electrophoresis and comparative genomic fingerprint matches between cattle, sewage, and water isolates. Campylobacters were commonly isolated from surface waters and faeces from most animal species. Restriction fragment length polymorphism of the Campylobacter flaA gene identified several location and host species-specific (cattle, goose, pig) fingerprints. Molecular subtyping of these bacterial pathogens shows considerable promise as a tool for determining the sources of faecal pollution of water.
TI  - Analogies and homologies in lipopolysaccharide and glycoprotein biosynthesis in bacteria.
AB  - Bacteria generate and attach countless glycan structures to diverse macromolecules. Despite this diversity, the mechanisms of glycoconjugate biosynthesis are often surprisingly similar. The focus of this review is on the commonalities between lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and glycoprotein assembly pathways and their evolutionary relationship. Three steps that are essential for both pathways are completed by membrane proteins. These include the initiation of glycan assembly through the attachment of a first sugar residue onto the lipid carrier undecaprenyl pyrophosphate, the translocation across the plasma membrane and the final transfer onto proteins or lipid A-core. Two families of initiating enzymes have been described: the polyprenyl-P N-acetylhexosamine-1-P transferases and the polyprenyl-P hexosamine-1-P transferases, represented by Escherichia coli WecA and Salmonella enterica WbaP, respectively. Translocases are either Wzx-like flippases or adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding cassette transporters (ABC transporters). The latter can consist either of two polypeptides, Wzt and Wzm, or of a single polypeptide homolog to the Campylobacter jejuni PglK. Finally, there are two families of conjugating enzymes, the N-oligosaccharyltransferases (N-OTase), best represented by C. jejuni PglB, and the O-OTases, including Neisseria meningitidis PglL and the O antigen ligases involved in LPS biosynthesis. With the exception of the N-OTases, probably restricted to glycoprotein synthesis, members of all these transmembrane protein families can be involved in the synthesis of both glycoproteins and LPS. Because many translocation and conjugation enzymes display relaxed substrate specificity, these bacterial enzymes could be exploited in engineered living bacteria for customized glycoconjugate production, generating potential vaccines and therapeutics.
TI  - Improved detection of five major gastrointestinal pathogens by use of a molecular screening approach.
AB  - The detection of bacterial and parasitic gastrointestinal pathogens through culture and microscopy is laborious and time-consuming. We evaluated a molecular screening approach (MSA) for the detection of five major enteric pathogens: Salmonella enterica, Campylobacter jejuni, Giardia lamblia, Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC), and Shigella spp./enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC), for use in the daily practice of a clinical microbiology laboratory. The MSA consists of prescreening of stool specimens with two real-time multiplex PCR (mPCR) assays, which give results within a single working day, followed by guided culture/microscopy of the positive or mPCR-inhibited samples. In the present 2-year overview, 28,185 stool specimens were included. The MSA was applied to 13,974 stool samples (49.6%), whereas 14,211 samples were tested by conventional methods only (50.4%). The MSA significantly increased the total detection rate compared to that of conventional methods (19.2% versus 6.4%). The detection of all included pathogens, with the exception of S. enterica, significantly improved. MSA detection frequencies were as follows: C. jejuni, 8.1%; G. lamblia, 4.7%; S. enterica, 3.0%; STEC, 1.9%; and Shigella spp./EIEC, 1.4%. The guided culture/microscopy was positive in 76.8%, 58.1%, 88.9%, 16.8%, and 18.1% of mPCR-positive specimens, respectively. Of all mPCRs, only 1.8% was inhibited. Other findings were that detection of mixed infections was increased (0.9% versus 0.02%) and threshold cycle (C(T)) values for MSA guided culture/microscopy-positive samples were significantly lower than those for guided culture/microscopy-negative samples. In conclusion, an MSA for detection of gastrointestinal pathogens resulted in markedly improved detection rates and a substantial decrease in time to reporting of (preliminary) results.
TI  - Estimating the primary etiologic agents in recreational freshwaters impacted by human sources of faecal contamination.
AB  - Epidemiology studies of recreational waters have demonstrated that swimmers exposed to faecally-contaminated recreational waters are at risk of excess gastrointestinal illness. Epidemiology studies provide valuable information on the nature and extent of health effects, the magnitude of risks, and how these risks are modified or associated with levels of faecal contamination and other measures of pollution. However, such studies have not provided information about the specific microbial agents that are responsible for the observed illnesses in swimmers. The objective of this work was to understand more fully the reported epidemiologic results from studies conducted on the Great Lakes in the US during 2003 and 2004 by identifying pathogens that could have caused the observed illnesses in those studies. We used a Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment (QMRA) approach to estimate the likelihood of pathogen-induced adverse health effects. The reference pathogens used for this analysis were Norovirus, rotavirus, adenovirus, Cryptosporidium spp., Giardia lamblia, Campylobacter jejuni, Salmonella enterica, and Escherichia coli O157:H7. Two QMRA-based approaches were used to estimate the pathogen combinations that would be consistent with observed illness rates: in the first, swimming-associated gastrointestinal (GI) illnesses were assumed to occur in the same proportion as known illnesses in the US due to all non-foodborne sources, and in the second, pathogens were assumed to occur in the recreational waters in the same proportion as they occur in disinfected secondary effluent. The results indicate that human enteric viruses and in particular, Norovirus could have caused the vast majority of the observed swimming-associated GI illnesses during the 2003/2004 water epidemiology studies. Evaluation of the time-to-onset of illness strongly supports the principal finding and sensitivity analyses support the overall trends of the analyses even given their substantial uncertainties.
TI  - Foodborne proportion of gastrointestinal illness: estimates from a Canadian expert elicitation survey.
AB  - The study used a structured expert elicitation survey to derive estimates of the  foodborne attributable proportion for nine illnesses caused by enteric pathogens in Canada. It was based on a similar study conducted in the United States and focused on Campylobacter, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes, nontyphoidal Salmonella enterica, Shigella spp., Vibrio spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, Cryptosporidium parvum, and Norwalk-like virus. For each pathogen, experts were asked to provide their best estimate and low and high limits for the proportion of foodborne illness relative to total cases. In addition, they provided background information with regard to food safety experience, including self-evaluated expertise for each pathogen on a 5-point scale. A snowball approach was used to identify 152 experts within Canada. The experts' background details were summarized using descriptive statistics. Factor analysis was used to determine whether the variability in best estimates was related to self-assessed level of expertise or other background information. Cluster analysis followed by beta function fitting was undertaken on best estimates from experts who self-evaluated their expertise 3 or higher. In parallel, Monte Carlo resampling was run using triangular distributions based on each expert's best estimate and its limits. Sixty-six experts encompassing various academic backgrounds, fields of expertise, and experiences relevant to food safety provided usable data. Considerable variation between experts in their estimated foodborne attributable proportions was observed over all diseases, without any relationship to the expert's background. Uncertainty about their estimate (measured by the low and high limits) varied between experts and between pathogens as well. Both cluster analysis and Monte Carlo resampling clearly indicated disagreement between experts for Campylobacter, E. coli O157, L. monocytogenes, Salmonella, Vibrio, and Y. enterocolitica. In the absence of more reliable estimates, the observed discrepancy between experts must be explored and understood before one can judge which opinion is the best.
TI  - Inactivation of Campylobacter jejuni by exposure to high-intensity 405-nm visible light.
AB  - Although considerable research has been carried out on a range of environmental factors that impact on the survival of Campylobacter jejuni, there is limited information on the effects of violet/blue light on this pathogen. This investigation was carried out to determine the effects of high-intensity 405-nm light on C. jejuni and to compare this with the effects on two other important Gram-negative enteric pathogens, Salmonella enteritidis and Escherichia coli O157:H7. High-intensity 405-nm light generated from an array of 405-nm light-emitting diodes was used to inactivate the test bacteria. The results demonstrated that while all three tested species were susceptible to 405-nm light inactivation, C. jejuni was by far the most sensitive organism, requiring a total dose of 18 J cm(-)(2) of 405-nm light to achieve a 5-log(1)(0) reduction. This study has established that C. jejuni is particularly susceptible to violet/blue light at a wavelength of 405 nm. This finding, coupled with the safety-in-use advantages of this visible (non-ultraviolet wavelength) light, suggests that high-intensity 405-nm light may have applications for control of C. jejuni contamination levels in situations where this type of illumination can be effectively applied.
TI  - Investigation of water washes suitable for very small meat plants to reduce pathogens on beef surfaces.
AB  - Water washing with a handheld hose was performed on beef surfaces to ascertain the most effective combination of methods needed to remove potentially harmful microorganisms. For these experiments, beef brisket surfaces were experimentally inoculated with a fecal slurry containing Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella Typhimurium, Campylobacter coli, and Campylobacter jejuni. In a pilot study, surfaces were washed with cold water (15 degrees C) at various water pressures, spray distances, application times, and drip times, and remaining bacterial populations were determined following the enumeration and isolation of pathogens and naturally occurring hygiene indicators (mesophilic aerobic bacteria, coliforms, and E. coli). The most efficacious combinations of these washing conditions were applied subsequently to artificially contaminated beef brisket surfaces in conjunction with hot (77 degrees C), warm (54 degrees C), and additional cold (15 degrees C) water washes. In the cold water washing pilot study, combinations of physical washing conditions significantly reduced all bacterial populations (P < 0.05). Further studies clearly indicated the superior bactericidal effectiveness of hot water washing; E. coli O157:H7 and Salmonella Typhimurium were reduced by 3.8 and 4.1 log CFU/cm(2), respectively. Overall, higher water temperature, longer application times, and shorter spray distances more effectively removed pathogens from inoculated beef surfaces. These findings will be used to formulate water washing recommendations for very small meat processing establishments.
TI  - High bacterial contamination of pig tonsils at slaughter.
AB  - Food-borne zoonoses have a major health impact in industrial countries. Campylobacter spp., Salmonella enterica, Yersinia enterocolitica and Listeria monocytogenes are high-risk food-borne zoonotic hazards in finishing pigs. The objectives of this work were (1) to study the isolation rate of pathogenic Y. enterocolitica, Salmonella spp., Campylobacter spp. and L. monocytogenes in the tonsils and feces and (2) to determine the number of mesophilic aerobic bacteria (MAB) and Escherichia coli in the tonsils of fattening pigs at slaughter. The samples, which were collected from one slaughterhouse on five occasions, originated from 50 pigs and 15 farms. The number of MAB varied from 6.40 to 7.82 log(10) CFU/g and E. coli from 4.38 to 6.53 log(10) CFU/g. Additionally, 31 (62%) of the tonsils were colonized with Y. enterocolitica and 16 (32%) with L. monocytogenes. Campylobacter spp. were more frequently excreted in feces and only 3 (6%) of the pigs carried Campylobacter spp. in the tonsils. No Salmonella spp. were isolated. The pig tonsils were shown to be colonized with a high number of bacteria including E. coli, which is the most important indicator for fecal contamination, and with Y. enterocolitica and L. monocytogenes, which are important food-borne pathogens. This study demonstrates that the tonsils are highly contaminated with micro-organisms and can be a very important source of contamination in the slaughterhouse.
TI  - Reconstitution of a functional Toll-like receptor 5 binding site in Campylobacter jejuni flagellin.
AB  - Bacterial flagellin is important for intestinal immune homeostasis. Flagellins from most species activate Toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5). The principal bacterial food-borne pathogen Campylobacter jejuni escapes TLR5 recognition, probably due to an alternate flagellin subunit structure. We investigated the molecular basis of TLR5 evasion by aiming to reconstitute TLR5 stimulating activity in live C. jejuni. Both native glycosylated C. jejuni flagellins (FlaA and FlaB) and recombinant proteins purified from Escherichia coli failed to activate NF-kappaB in HEK293 cells expressing TLR5. Introduction of multiple defined regions from Salmonella flagellin into C. jejuni FlaA via a recombinatorial approach revealed three regions critical for the activation of human and mouse TLR5, including a beta-hairpin structure not previously implicated in TLR5 recognition. Surprisingly, this domain was not required for the activation of chicken TLR5, indicating a selective requirement for the beta-hairpin in the recognition of mammalian TLR5. Expression of the active chimeric protein in C. jejuni resulted in secreted glycosylated flagellin that induced a potent TLR5 response. Overall, our results reveal a novel structural requirement for TLR5 recognition of bacterial flagellin and exclude flagellin glycosylation as an additional mechanism of bacterial evasion of the TLR5 response.
TI  - The occurrence and sources of Campylobacter spp., Salmonella enterica and Escherichia coli O157:H7 in the Salmon River, British Columbia, Canada.
AB  - In this study, we wished to assess the prevalence and determine the sources of three zoonotic bacterial pathogens (Salmonella, Campylobacter, and Escherichia coli O157:H7) in the Salmon River watershed in southwestern British Columbia. Surface water, sewage, and animal faecal samples were collected from the watershed. Selective bacterial culture and PCR techniques were used to isolate these three pathogens and indicator bacteria from these samples and characterize them. Campylobacter was the most prevalent pathogen in all samples, followed by Salmonella, and E. coli O157:H7. E. coli O157:H7 and Salmonella isolation rates from water, as well as faecal coliform densities correlated positively with precipitation, while Campylobacter isolation rates correlated negatively with precipitation. Analysis of DNA extracted from water samples for the presence of Bacteroides host-species markers, and comparisons of C. jejuni flaA-RFLP types and Salmonella serovars from faecal and water samples provided evidence that human sewage and specific domestic and wild animal species were sources of these pathogens; however, in most cases the source could not be determined or more than one source was possible. The frequent isolation of these zoonotic pathogens in the Salmon River highlights the risks to human health associated with intentional and unintentional consumption of untreated surface waters.
TI  - Identification and characterization of the aspartate chemosensory receptor of Campylobacter jejuni.
AB  - Campylobacter jejuni is a highly motile bacterium that responds via chemotaxis to environmental stimuli to migrate towards favourable conditions. Previous in silico analysis of the C. jejuni strain NCTC11168 genome sequence identified 10 open reading frames, tlp1-10, that encode putative chemosensory receptors. We describe the characterization of the role and specificity of the Tlp1 chemoreceptor (Cj1506c). In vitro and in vivo models were used to determine if Tlp1 had a role in host colonization. The tlp1(-) isogenic mutant was more adherent in cell culture, however, showed reduced colonization ability in chickens. Specific interactions between the purified sensory domain of Tlp1 and l-aspartate were identified using an amino acid array and saturation transfer difference nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Chemotaxis assays showed differences between migration of wild-type C. jejuni cells and that of a tlp1(-) isogenic mutant, specifically towards aspartate. Furthermore, using yeast two-hybrid and three-hybrid systems for analysis of protein-protein interactions, the cytoplasmic signalling domain of Tlp1 was found to preferentially interact with CheV, rather than the CheW homologue of the chemotaxis signalling pathway; this interaction was confirmed using immune precipitation assays. This is the first identification of an aspartate receptor in bacteria other than Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium.
TI  - Antimicrobial drug use and antimicrobial resistance in enteric bacteria among cattle from Alberta feedlots.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine whether antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in foodborne pathogens (Escherichia coli O157, Salmonella, and Campylobacter) and non-type-specific E. coli obtained from fecal samples of feedlot cattle was associated with antimicrobial drug (AMD) use. A secondary objective was to determine if AMR in non-type-specific E. coli could be used as a predictor of AMR in foodborne pathogens. Fecal samples were collected from pen floors in 21 Alberta feedlots during March through December 2004, and resistance prevalence was estimated by season (Spring, Fall) and cattle type (fewest days-on-feed and closest to slaughter). AMD exposures were obtained by calculating therapeutic animal daily doses for each drug before sampling from feedlot records. Generalized linear mixed models were used to investigate the relationship between each AMR and AMD use. Non-type-specific E. coli was commonly recovered from fecal samples (88.62%), and the highest prevalence of resistance was found toward tetracycline (53%), streptomycin (28%), and sulfadiazine (48%). Campylobacter jejuni was recovered from 55.3% of the fecal samples, and resistance was generally less for the drugs that were evaluated (doxycycline 38.1%, ciprofloxacin 2.6%, nalidixic acid 1.64%, erythromycin 1.2%). E. coli O157 and Salmonella were recovered much less frequently (7% and 1% prevalence, respectively). The prevalence of recovery for the bacteria studied varied between seasons and cattle types, as did patterns of AMR. Among non-type-specific E. coli, resistance to tetracycline, streptomycin, and sulfadiazine was found to be positively associated with in-feed exposure as well as injectable tetracycline, but these differences were relatively small and of questionable practical relevance. Among C. jejuni isolates, cattle type was significantly associated with doxycycline resistance. Results suggested that resistance in non-type-specific E. coli to chloramphenicol, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and tetracycline might be used as predictors of resistance to these drugs in E. coli O157 recovered from the same fecal samples.
TI  - Development of a DNA microarray to detect antimicrobial resistance genes identified in the National Center for Biotechnology Information database.
AB  - To understand the mechanisms and epidemiology of antimicrobial resistance (AR), the genetic elements responsible must be identified. Due to the myriad of possible genes, a high-density genotyping technique is needed for initial screening. To achieve this, AR genes in the National Center for Biotechnology Information GenBank database were identified by their annotations and compiled into a nonredundant list of 775 genes. A DNA microarray was constructed of 70mer oligonucelotide probes designed to detect these genes encoding resistances to aminoglycosides, beta-lactams, chloramphenicols, glycopeptides, heavy metals, lincosamides, macrolides, metronidazoles, polyketides, quaternary ammonium compounds, streptogramins, sulfonamides, tetracyclines, and trimethoprims as well as resistance transfer genes. The microarray was validated with two fully sequenced control strains of Salmonella enterica: Typhimurium LT2 (sensitive) and Typhi CT18 (multidrug resistance [MDR]). All resistance genes encoded on the MDR plasmid, pHCM1, harbored by CT18 were detected in that strain, whereas no resistance genes were detected in LT2. The microarray was also tested with a variety of bacteria, including MDR Salmonella enterica serovars, Escherichia coli, Campylobacter spp., Enterococcus spp., methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria spp., and Clostridium difficile. The results presented here demonstrate that a microarray can be designed to detect virtually all AR genes found in the National Center for Biotechnology Information database, thus reducing the subsequent assays necessary to identify specific resistance gene alleles.
TI  - Development of an oligonucleotide-based microarray to detect multiple foodborne pathogens.
AB  - Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella enterica, Listeria monocytogenes and Campylobacter jejuni are considered important pathogens causing the most food-related human illnesses worldwide. Current methods for pathogen detection have limitations in the effectiveness of identifying multiple foodborne pathogens. In this study, a pathogen detection microarray was developed using various 70-mer oligonucleotides specifically targeting the above pathogens. To reduce the cost of detection, each microarray chip was designed and fabricated to accommodate 12 identical arrays which could be used for screening up to 12 different samples. To achieve high detection sensitivity and specificity, target-specific DNA amplification instead of whole genome random amplification was used prior to microarray analysis. Combined with 14-plex PCR amplification of target sequences, the microarray unambiguously distinguished all 4 pathogens with a detection sensitivity of 1 x 10(-4) ng (approximately 20 copies) of each genomic DNA. Applied the assay to 39 fresh meat samples, 16 samples were found to be contaminated by either 1 or 2 of these pathogens. The co-occurrences of Salmonella and E. coli O157:H7, Salmonella and L. monocytogenes in the same meat samples were also observed. Overall, the microarray combined with multiplex PCR method was able to effectively screen single or multiple pathogens in food samples and to provide important genotypic information related to pathogen virulence.
TI  - Comparison of the EntericBio multiplex PCR system with routine culture for detection of bacterial enteric pathogens.
AB  - The EntericBio system uses a multiplex PCR assay for the simultaneous detection of Campylobacter spp., Salmonella enterica, Shigella spp., and Escherichia coli O157 from feces. It combines overnight broth enrichment with PCR amplification and detection by hybridization. An evaluation of this system was conducted by comparing the results obtained with the system with those obtained by routine culture, supplemented with alternative PCR detection methods. In a study of 773 samples, routine culture and the EntericBio system yielded 94.6 and 92.4% negative results, respectively. Forty-two samples had positive results by culture, and all of these were positive with the EntericBio system. This system detected an additional 17 positive samples (Campylobacter spp., n = 12; Shigella spp., n = 1; E. coli O157, n = 4), but the results for 5 samples (Campylobacter spp., n = 2; Shigella spp., n = 1; E. coli O157, n = 2) could not be confirmed. The target for Shigella spp. detected by the EntericBio system is the ipaH gene, and the molecular indication of the presence of Shigella spp. was investigated by sequence analysis, which confirmed that the ipaH gene was present in a Klebsiella pneumoniae isolate from the patient. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 100%, 99.3%, 91.5%, and 100%, respectively. Turnaround times were significantly reduced with the EntericBio system, and a result was available between 24 and 32 h after receipt of the sample in the laboratory. In addition, the amount of laboratory waste was significantly reduced by use of this system. In summary, the EntericBio system proved convenient to use, more sensitive than the conventional culture used in this study, and highly specific; and it generated results significantly faster than routine culture for the pathogens tested.
TI  - Perceptions, practices, and consequences associated with foodborne pathogens and  the feeding of raw meat to dogs.
AB  - This study explored the impact of feeding raw meat to dogs on the fecal prevalence of several enteric bacterial zoonotic pathogens. Campylobacter jejuni was isolated from 1/42 (2.6%) raw meat-fed dogs. Salmonella enterica was isolated from 2/40 (5%) of the raw meat feeds, 6/42 (14%) raw meat-fed dog feces, none of the dogs that did not receive raw meat (P = 0.001), 4/38 (10.5%) of the vacuum cleaner waste samples from households where raw meat was fed, and 2/44 (4.5%) of vacuum cleaner waste samples from households where raw meat was not fed to dogs (P = 0.41). Responses to a questionnaire probing practices and beliefs regarding raw meat feeding that was administered to dog owners demonstrated that dog owners may either not be aware or refuse to acknowledge the risks associated with raw meat-feeding; thus, they may neglect to conduct adequate intervention strategies to prevent zoonoses among themselves and their families.
TI  - [Development of single base extension-tags microarray for the detection of food-borne pathogens].
AB  - We developed single base extension-tags (SBE-tags) microarray to detect eight common food-borne pathogens, including Staphylococcus aureus, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella, Enterobacter sakazaki, Shigella, Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Campylobacter jejuni. With specific PCR primers identified and integrated for eight food-borne pathogens, target sequences were amplified and purified as template DNA of single base extension-tags reaction. The products were hybridized to microarrays and scanned for fluorescence intensity. The experiment showed a specific and simultaneous detection of eight food-borne pathogens. The system limits is 0.1 pg for a genomic DNA and 5x10(2) CFU/mL for Salmonella typhimurium cultures. The single base extension-tags assay can be used to detect food-borne pathogens rapidly and accurately with a high sensitivity, and provide an efficient way for diagnosis and control of disease caused by food-borne pathogens.
TI  - Simultaneous identification of seven foodborne pathogens and Escherichia coli (pathogenic and nonpathogenic) using capillary electrophoresis-based single-strand conformation polymorphism coupled with multiplex PCR.
AB  - The objective of this study was to develop a novel technique for parallel analysis of eight important foodborne microbes using capillary electrophoresis-based single-strand conformation polymorphism (CE-SSCP) coupled with multiplex PCR. Specific primers for multiplex PCR amplification of the 16S rRNA gene were designed, corresponding to eight species of bacteria, including Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens, Campylobacter jejuni, Salmonella enterica, Listeria monocytogenes, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacillus cereus, for the species-specific identification and optimal separation of their PCR products in subsequent analysis by CE-SSCP. Multiplex PCR conditions including annealing temperature, extension time, the number of PCR cycles, and primer concentrations were then optimized for simultaneous detection of all target foodborne bacteria. The diagnostic system using CE-SSCP combined with multiplex PCR developed here can be used for rapid investigation of causative agents of foodborne illness. The simplicity and high sensitivity of the method may lead to improved management of safety and illness related to food.
TI  - Molecular typing methodologies for microbial source tracking and epidemiological  investigations of Gram-negative bacterial foodborne pathogens.
AB  - Gram-negative bacterial foodborne pathogens are a worldwide cause of morbidity and mortality. The ability to carry out epidemiological investigations to determine the primary sources of bacterial contamination is important to improve public health. Multiple methods are available for bacterial source tracking and to determine the distribution of pathogens isolated from sick patients. The molecular based typing methods available fall into three general categories: those based on restriction analysis of the bacterial DNA; those based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of particular genetic targets; and those based on the identification of DNA sequence polymorphisms. The techniques that are examined in this review include: plasmid analysis, restriction fragment length polymorphism methods, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, amplified fragment length polymorphism analysis, PCR-based genotyping, variable number of tandem repeat analysis, multilocus sequence typing, and single nucleotide polymorphism analysis. These methods are described along with a discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of the techniques for genotyping the major Gram-negative foodborne pathogens--Campylobacter spp., Salmonella enterica, Shigella spp., Escherichia coli, and Yersinia enterocolitica.
TI  - Risk factors for infection with pathogenic and antimicrobial-resistant fecal bacteria in northern elephant seals in California.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The goal of this study was to identify potential environmental and demographic factors associated with Campylobacter jejuni (C. jejuni), Salmonella enterica (Salmonella spp.), and antimicrobial-resistant Escherichia coli (E. coli) infection in northern elephant seals stranded along the California coastline. METHODS: E. coli, Salmonella spp., and C. jejuni were isolated from rectal swabs from 196 juvenile northern elephant seals, which were found stranded and alive along the California coast and brought to The Marine Mammal Center in Sausalito, California, for rehabilitation. Gender, weight, county where the animal stranded, month stranded, coastal human population density, exposure to sewage outfall or freshwater outflow (river or stream), and cumulative precipitation in the previous 24 hours, seven days, 30 days, 90 days, and 180 days were analyzed as potential risk factors for infection. RESULTS: The odds of C. jejuni and antimicrobial-resistant E. coli were higher in feces of seals stranded at sites with higher levels of freshwater outflow compared with lower levels of freshwater outflow. The odds of Salmonella spp. in feces were 5.4 times greater in seals stranded in locations with lower levels of 30-day cumulative precipitation, along with substantially lower odds of Salmonella shedding for seals stranded in Monterey or Santa Cruz county compared with seals stranded in regions further north or south of this central California location. CONCLUSIONS: Juvenile northern elephant seals that have entered the water are being colonized by antimicrobial-resistant and pathogenic fecal bacteria that may be acquired from terrestrial sources transmitted via river and surface waters.
TI  - A novel DNA microarray for rapid diagnosis of enteropathogenic bacteria in stool  specimens of patients with diarrhea.
AB  - A microarray technique for the detection and identification of enteropathogenic bacteria at the species and subspecies levels was developed in this study, and the target bacteria included pathogenic Escherichia coli, Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Salmonella enterica, Campylobacter jejuni, Shigellae, Yersinia enterocolitica, and Listeria monocytogenes. The virulence gene of each pathogen was chosen as the amplification target, labeled with a fluorescence dye by multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and hybridized to the specific virulence gene probes that had been immobilized on a microchip. Stool specimens from 34 patients with diarrhea were tested in this study. Five were positive for multiple genera. Nested PCRs and sequencing were used to amplify and identify the related genes, which were found to share 95.8% to 100% of the nucleotide identity with the corresponding regions in the Genbank database. Real-time PCR was used to determine the number of gene copies to determine the sensitivity of this technique, which was shown to be 58 copies/microl. The results indicated that the microarray technique which targets multiple virulence genes of enteropathogenic bacteria at the species and subspecies levels is an attractive diagnostic tool for rapidly and simultaneously identifying multiple enteropathogenic pathogens in clinical practice, especially in patients with infectious diarrhea.
TI  - Assessment of the stability of cell-surface components of microorganisms by MALDI-TOF-MS following preservation on lenticule discs.
AB  - Strains representing the species Campylobacter coli, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enterica, and Staphylococcus aureus were randomly selected to assess the consistency of cells preserved on lenticule discs to those archived in traditional freeze-dried ampoules. Each matched pair was cultured using identical conditions and analysed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MS) to profile the surface-associated molecules of the cells. In addition, the cytosolic/membrane-bound proteins of C. coli and S. aureus strains were further analysed by surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight MS. The mass spectral profiles in all cases showed a high degree of concordance between cells preserved by both methods and suggest that the properties of cells preserved on lenticule disc are consistent with those archived by the traditional method of freeze-drying.
TI  - In vivo expression technology and signature-tagged mutagenesis screens for identifying mechanisms of survival of zoonotic foodborne pathogens.
AB  - High-throughput genetic screens provide great insights into the biochemistry and  molecular biology of how bacteria sense, respond to, and propagate within their environments. Genomics era techniques such as microarrays and proteomics have great potential to increase our understanding of how foodborne pathogens grow and survive within animal and human hosts, in the environment and foods, and during thermal and nonthermal inactivation protocols. While these techniques are incredibly useful for studying gene expression in simplified in vitro conditions, it is much more challenging to pursue similar studies within more complex experimental models such as in vivo, within the food matrix, or within heterogeneous microbial populations. Techniques such as in vivo expression technology (IVET) and signature-tagged mutagenesis (STM) provide alternatives for studying bacterial gene expression and growth requirements within these settings. These techniques are used extensively by the medical, veterinary, and plant research communities for identifying genes promoting the colonization and disease process, factors mediating commensalism between bacteria and their host, and genes that promote survival of environmental bacteria within natural settings. Research into the transmission and survival of foodborne pathogens from farm-to-fork would likely benefit from these techniques, however there are few reports describing their use for such purposes. This review will briefly cover the methods of IVET and STM, discuss how these techniques improved our understanding of the interactions between zoonotic foodborne pathogens and their animal hosts, and ask whether these techniques could be further exploited to better understand the survival of foodborne pathogens within the environment, within food matrices, and during inactivation protocols.
TI  - Comparative analysis of antibiotic resistance characteristics of Gram-negative bacteria isolated from laying hens and eggs in conventional and organic keeping systems in Bavaria, Germany.
AB  - By investigating the prevalence and resistance characteristics of Gram-negative bacteria from organic and conventional kept laying hens against 31 (Campylobacter: 29) different antibiotics using the microdilution method, we determined to what extent different keeping systems influence bacterial resistance patterns. For this purpose, samples from 10 organic and 10 conventional flocks in Bavaria (Germany) were investigated four times between January 2004 and April 2005. Altogether, 799 cloacal swabs and 800 eggs (contents and shells) were examined. The bacterial investigation performed with standardized cultural methods showed prevalence for all bacteria groups in about the same order of magnitude in the two different keeping systems: Salmonella spp. 3.5% (organic ([org])) versus 1.8% (conventional ([con])); Campylobacter spp. 34.8%(org) versus 29.0%(con) and E. coli 64.4%(org) versus 69.0%(con). Coliforms (Citrobacter, Enterobacter, Pantoea) were only isolated in single cases. In eggs, generally less bacteria were detected, predominantly Escherichia; Salmonella and Campylobacter were only scarcely isolated. Salmonella enterica ssp. enterica serovar Typhimurium (n=10) were resistant to up to nine, S. of the serogroup B (n=4) up to six antibiotics. All tested Salmonella (n=23) proved to be resistant to spectinomycin. Escherichia coli (n=257(org) and 276(con)) from organic layers showed significant lower resistance rates and higher rates of susceptible isolates to nine agents, namely amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, ampicillin, cefaclor, cefoxitin, cefuroxime, doxycycline, mezlocillin, neomycin and piperacillin. In contrast, only two antibiotics turned out to be more effective in conventional isolates (gentamicin and tobramycin). In the case of Campylobacter jejuni (n=118(org) and 99(con)), statistically significantly better rates were observed for isolates from organic flocks concerning imipenem and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, whereas fosfomycin was more potent in strains from conventional flocks. Results of this study indicate that both resistance rates and mean minimum inhibitory concentrations of bacteria isolated from organic keeping systems have lower values than those from conventional ones, particularly recognizable for E. coli. Thus, organic livestock farming with its restrictions and additional requirements contributes to further effectiveness of antibiotics.
TI  - Skim milk enhances the preservation of thawed -80 degrees C bacterial stocks.
AB  - The results from bacterial strain recovery efforts following hurricanes Katrina and Rita are reported. Over 90% of strains frozen in 10% skim milk were recovered whereas various recovery rates were observed for glycerol-stored stocks (56% and 94% of Escherichia coli, depending upon the laboratory). These observations led to a viability comparison of Streptococcus pyogenes, Campylobacter jejuni, Borrelia burgdorferi, Salmonella enterica subsp. Typhimurium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and E. coli strains stored in glycerol or skim milk. In all bacteria examined, 10% skim milk resulted in significantly longer viability after thawing than 15% glycerol solutions currently used in most laboratories.
TI  - Survival of bacterial pathogens during the thermophilic anaerobic digestion of biowaste: laboratory experiments and in situ validation.
AB  - Anaerobic digestion is continually gaining importance for the processing of the organic fraction of municipal solid wastes. Although methods for studying the survival of pathogen exist, these methods often need adaptations, are expensive, time consuming or generally not well suited for the harsh conditions within an anaerobic digestion system. In the present study we investigated the applicability of commercially available, mechanically stable and inexpensive pathogen carriers to validate in situ pathogen inhibition within a 750,000l thermophilic, bio-waste treating anaerobic digester. None of the pathogens investigated (Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella enterica, Escherichia coli, and Campylobacter jejuni) was capable of survival under the conditions of the biogas reactor for more than 24 h indicating that the temperature and physico-chemical properties of the sludge of the fermenter were effective in inhibiting the survival of these microorganisms.
TI  - Survival of selected pathogens in diluted sludge of a thermophilic waste treatment plant and in NaCl-solution under aerobic and anaerobic conditions.
AB  - Decimal reduction times (DRT or D-value) of Campylobacter jejuni, Salmonella enterica (formerly Salmonella choleraesuis) serovar Senftenberg, Escherichia coli, and Listeria monocytogenes were determined in two different matrices, diluted fermenter sludge (DFS) and 0.95% NaCl-solution (NaCl) at 50 degrees C, both under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Depending on aeration, matrix composition, and the respective organism, the D-values varied between 10min and more than 15h. Generally the viability of bacteria decreased faster in DFS compared to NaCl-solution and under aerobic compared to anaerobic conditions. After 24h no viable cells could be detected in DFS, both under aerobic as well as under anaerobic conditions, whereas viable cells were still found in NaCl solutions. In both matrices the detection limits determined by means of PCR-based and classical microbiological methods were compared and pointed to lower detection limits of the latter methods. Results of the present investigation show that test organisms were far from surviving several days in DFS whereas hydraulic retention times normally used for thermophilic anaerobic digestion are in the range of 2 weeks. However, an underestimation of survival rates of the test organisms seems probable when applying aerobic standard methods.
TI  - Pulsed-plasma gas-discharge inactivation of microbial pathogens in chilled poultry wash water.
AB  - A pulsed-plasma gas-discharge (PPGD) system was developed for the novel decontamination of chilled poultry wash water. Treatment of poultry wash water in the plasma generation chamber for up to 24 s at 4 degrees C reduced Escherichia coli NCTC 9001, Campylobacter jejuni ATCC 33560, Campylobacter coli ATCC 33559, Listeria monocytogenes NCTC 9863, Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis ATCC 4931, and S. enterica serovar Typhimurium ATCC 14028 populations to non-detectable levels (< or = 8 log CFU/ml). Although similar PPGD treatments at 4 degrees C also produced significant reductions (> or = 3 log CFU/ml) in recalcitrant B. cereus NCTC 11145 endospore numbers within 30 s, the level of endospore reduction was dependent on the nature of the sparged gas used in the plasma treatments. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that significant damage occurred at the cellular level in PPGD-treated test organisms. This electrotechnology delivers energy in intense ultrashort bursts, generating products such as ozone, UV light, acoustic and shock waves, and pulsed electric fields that have multiple bactericidal properties. This technology offers an exciting complementary or alternative approach for treating raw poultry wash water and for preventing cross-contamination in processing environments.
TI  - Isolation and purification of enterocin E-760 with broad antimicrobial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Strain NRRL B-30745, isolated from chicken ceca and identified as Enterococcus durans, Enterococcus faecium, or Enterococcus hirae, was initially identified as antagonistic to Campylobacter jejuni. The isolate produced a 5,362-Da bacteriocin (enterocin) that inhibits the growth of Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis, S. enterica serovar Choleraesuis, S. enterica serovar Typhimurium, S. enterica serovar Gallinarum, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Yersinia enterocolitica, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Shigella dysenteriae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Listeria monocytogenes, Campylobacter jejuni, and 20 other Campylobacter species isolates. The enterocin, E-760, was isolated and purified by cation-exchange and hydrophobic-interaction chromatographies. The proteinaceous nature of purified enterocin E-760 was demonstrated upon treatment with various proteolytic enzymes. Specifically, the antimicrobial peptide was found to be sensitive to beta-chymotrypsin, proteinase K, and papain, while it was resistant to lysozyme and lipase. The enterocin demonstrated thermostability by retaining activity after 5 min at 100 degrees C and was stable at pH values between 5.0 and 8.7. However, activity was lost below pH 3.0 and above pH 9.5. Administration of enterocin E-760-treated feed significantly (P < 0.05) reduced the colonization of young broiler chicks experimentally challenged and colonized with two strains of C. jejuni by more than 8 log(10) CFU. Enterocin E-760 also significantly (P < 0.05) reduced the colonization of naturally acquired Campylobacter species in market age broiler chickens when administered in treated feed 4 days prior to analysis.
TI  - Microbiological differences between cull cattle slaughtered at an abattoir and cull cattle slaughtered on farms.
AB  - Tissue samples from 27 casualty adult dairy cattle slaughtered on farms and 32 'normal' cull dairy cattle were analysed microbiologically for total viable counts (tvc), Enterobacteriaceae, Escherichia coli o157, Salmonella enterica and Campylobacter species. Overall the counts of Enterobacteriaceae and tvc were higher in the animals slaughtered on farms, particularly in the spleen. One 'normal' animal yielded E coli O157, and one yielded Campylobacter jejuni, and eight of the cattle slaughtered on farms yielded C jejuni and five yielded S enterica.
TI  - Evidence of lethal and sublethal injury in food-borne bacterial pathogens exposed to high-intensity pulsed-plasma gas discharges.
AB  - AIMS: To apply scanning electron microscopy, image analysis and a fluorescent viability stain to assess lethal and sublethal injury in food-borne bacteria exposed to pulsed-plasma gas discharges (PPGD). METHODS AND RESULTS: The fluorescent redox probe 5-cyano-2,3-ditolyl tetrazolium chloride (CTC) was used for enumerating actively respiring cells of Campylobacter jejuni, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium that were suspended in sterile water at 4 degrees C and exposed to separate PPGD and heat treatments. While there was good agreement between use of respiratory staining (RS) and direct-selective agar plate counting (PC) for enumerating untreated bacteria, there were c. 1 and 3 log-unit differences in surviving cell numbers per millilitre for test organisms subjected to PPGD and heat treatments respectively, when enumerated by these different viability indicators. PPGD-treated bacteria were markedly altered at the cellular level when examined by scanning electron microscopy. CONCLUSIONS: Use of this RS method revealed that substantial subpopulations of test bacteria rendered incapable of forming colonies by separate PPGD and heat treatments may remain metabolically active. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Use of this RS method offers interesting perspectives on assessing established and novel microbial inactivation methods, and may also provide a better understanding of mechanisms involved in microbial inactivation induced by high-intensity PPGD treatments.
TI  - Survival of indicator and pathogenic bacteria in bovine feces on pasture.
AB  - The survival of enteric bacteria was measured in bovine feces on pasture. In each season, 11 cow pats were prepared from a mixture of fresh dairy cattle feces and sampled for up to 150 days. Four pats were analyzed for Escherichia coli, fecal streptococci, and enterococci, and four inoculated pats were analyzed for Campylobacter jejuni and Salmonella enterica. Two pats were placed on drainage collectors, and another pat was fitted with a temperature probe. In the first 1 to 3 weeks, there were increases (up to 1.5 orders of magnitude) in the counts of enterococci (in four seasons), E. coli (three seasons), fecal streptococci (three seasons), and S. enterica (two seasons), but there was no increase in the counts of C. jejuni. Thereafter, the counts decreased, giving an average ranking of the times necessary for 90% inactivation of C. jejuni (6.2 days from deposition) < fecal streptococci (35 days) < S. enterica (38 days) < E. coli (48 days) < enterococci (56 days). The pat temperature probably influenced bacterial growth, but the pattern of increases and decreases was primarily determined by desiccation; growth occurred when the water content was greater than 80%, but at a water content of 70 to 75% counts decreased. E. coli and enterococcus regrowth appeared to result from pat rehydration. Of 20 monthly leaching losses of E. coli, 16 were <10% of the total counts in the pat, and 12 were <1%. Drainage losses of C. jejuni (generally <1%) were detected for only 1 to 2 months. Although enterococci exhibited the best survival rate, higher final counts suggested that E. coli is the more practical indicator of bovine fecal pollution.
TI  - [Infectious aetiologies of travelers' diarrhoea].
AB  - Traveler's diarrhoea (TD) occurs in 20 to 60% of European or North-American travelers in intertropical areas. Following return from endemic zone, malaria must always be evocated in front of febrile diarrhoea. Many causative infectious agents are involved in TD and their frequency may vary according to destination and seasons. The main agents involved in TD are Escherichia coli pathovars (especially enterotoxigenic and enteroaggregative E. coli) followed by enteroinvasive bacteria (Campylobacter spp., Shigella spp., Salmonella enterica), enteric viruses (norovirus, rotavirus) and protozoa (Gardia intestinalis, Cryptosporidium parvum et Entamoeba histolytica). The development of molecular biology methods as PCR may allow us to evaluate the relative frequency of these agents and especially of viral agents in TD. Protozoa and microsporidia are more frequently isolated in persistent and chronic TD, especially in compromised patients. A complete etiological research in routine microbiology laboratories is difficult and time-consuming, related to the high diversity of causative agents and the need for specific methods. Implementation of laboratory diagnosis is highly recommended when diarrhoea is associated with fever or presence of blood in stools, immunosuppression, antibiotic treatment (Clostridium difficile toxins) or in case of persistent/chronic diarrhoea. According to the high frequency of acquired antibiotic-resistance in enteric bacteria, an antibiogram must be performed for all causative bacterial agents.
TI  - Sunlight inactivation of Campylobacter jejuni and Salmonella enterica, compared with Escherichia coli, in seawater and river water.
AB  - The inactivation of Campylobacter jejuni and Salmonella enterica, compared with Escherichia coli, was determined in 100 l chambers of seawater and river water located at an outdoor site. The chambers (paired with dark controls) were seeded with waste stabilization pond effluent and laboratory-cultured pathogens, and exposed to sunlight in summer and winter experiments. All sunlight inactivation (k(S)) rates, as a function of cumulative global solar radiation (insolation), were far higher than the corresponding dark (k(D)) rates, with a ranking (and average k(S) rates for seawater and river water, respectively) of: C. jejuni (3.23; 2.34)>S. enterica (0.51; 0.37)>E. coli (0.34; 0.26). All the T(90) (time to 90% inactivation) values were higher in winter than in summer, but there was far greater similarity between the summer and winter S(90) (insolation needed for 90% inactivation) values. The rapid inactivation of C. jejuni was attributed to a high susceptibility to photooxidative damage. The results suggest that, in sunlight-exposed waters, E. coli will be a more conservative indicator for C. jejuni than for S. enterica, and C. jejuni transmission as a pathogenic agent is less likely than for S. enterica.
TI  - The role of gene fusions in the evolution of metabolic pathways: the histidine biosynthesis case.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Histidine biosynthesis is one of the best characterized anabolic pathways. There is a large body of genetic and biochemical information available, including operon structure, gene expression, and increasingly larger sequence databases. For over forty years this pathway has been the subject of extensive studies, mainly in Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica, in both of which details of histidine biosynthesis appear to be identical. In these two enterobacteria the pathway is unbranched, includes a number of unusual reactions, and consists of nine intermediates; his genes are arranged in a compact operon (hisGDC [NB]HAF [IE]), with three of them (hisNB, hisD and hisIE) coding for bifunctional enzymes. We performed a detailed analysis of his gene fusions in available genomes to understand the role of gene fusions in shaping this pathway. RESULTS: The analysis of HisA structures revealed that several gene elongation events are at the root of this protein family: internal duplication have been identified by structural superposition of the modules composing the TIM-barrel protein. Several his gene fusions happened in distinct taxonomic lineages; hisNB originated within gamma-proteobacteria and after its appearance it was transferred to Campylobacter species (epsilon-proteobacteria) and to some Bacteria belonging to the CFB group. The transfer involved the entire his operon. The hisIE gene fusion was found in several taxonomic lineages and our results suggest that it probably happened several times in distinct lineages. Gene fusions involving hisIE and hisD genes (HIS4) and hisH and hisF genes (HIS7) took place in the Eukarya domain; the latter has been transferred to some delta-proteobacteria. CONCLUSION: Gene duplication is the most widely known mechanism responsible for the origin and evolution of metabolic pathways; however, several other mechanisms might concur in the process of pathway assembly and gene fusion appeared to be one of the most important and common.
TI  - [Prevalence of the bacteria causing diarrea in a Rosario Hospital, Argentina].
AB  - Bacterial agents causing diarrea in patients attended in a hospital of Rosario, Argentina. The frequency of bacterial agents causing diarrhea can vary in patients of different areas, and through the time. In an epidemiological surveillance we studied 304 patients with diarrheal diseases looking for Salmonella enterica, Shigella spp, Campylobacter spp, Aeromonas spp, Yersinia enterocolitica, and diarrheogenic Escherichia coli. C. jejuni was isolated in 30 patients (9,9 %), Salmonella in 18 (5,9 %), and enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) in 7 (2,3 %). Most cases due ton C. jejuni had mucus and/or blood in their feces. Unexpectedly we didn't fine any cases due to Shigella spp. There was much less cases due to EPEC than in our previous studies, and occurred only in children of less than 5 years old. It is necesary to take in consideration that C. jejuni cause nearly all the cases of diarrhea in patients with mucus and blood in their feces actually in our region.
TI  - A waterborne outbreak of gastroenteritis with multiple etiologies among resort island visitors and residents: Ohio, 2004.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The implementation of treated municipal water systems in the 20th century led to a dramatic decrease in waterborne disease in the United States. However, communities with deficient water systems still experience waterborne outbreaks. In August 2004, we investigated an outbreak of gastroenteritis on South Bass Island, Ohio, an island of 900 residents that is visited by >500,000 persons each year. METHODS: To identify the source of illness, we conducted a case-control study and an environmental investigation. A case was defined as diarrhea in a person who traveled to the island during the period from May 1 through 30 September 2004 and became ill within 2 weeks after the visit. Healthy travel companions served as matched control subjects. We also performed an environmental assessment and extensive testing of island water sources. RESULTS: Among the 1450 persons reporting illness, Campylobacter jejuni, norovirus, Giardia intestinalis, and Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium were identified in 16, 9, 3, and 1 persons, respectively. We interviewed 100 case patients and 117 matched control subjects. Case patients were more likely to drink water on the island than control subjects (68% vs. 35%; matched odds ratio, 4.3; 95% confidence interval, 2.2-9.3). Sampling of ground water wells indicated contamination with multiple fecal microbes, including Escherichia coli, C. jejuni, Salmonella species, and Giardia species. Irregularities in sewage disposal practices that could have contaminated the underground aquifer were noted. CONCLUSIONS: The combined epidemiological and environmental investigation indicated that sewage-contaminated ground water was the likely source of this large outbreak. Long-term changes to the island's water supply and sewage management infrastructure are needed.
TI  - Low level nitrate or nitroethane preconditioning enhances the bactericidal effect of suboptimal experimental chlorate treatment against Escherichia coli and Salmonella Typhimurium but not Campylobacter in swine.
AB  - An experimental chlorate product that targets the respiratory nitrate reductase enzyme of bacteria such as Salmonella and Escherichia coli has shown promising results in reducing concentrations of these bacteria in the gut of food animals. Because expression of the target enzyme is induced by nitrate, we administered short-duration, low level nitrate or nitroethane preconditioning treatments to finishing swine to see if these would enhance the ability of an experimental chlorate product to kill these bacteria. Results from these studies showed that preconditioning the gut microflora of swine with low levels of nitrate or nitrocompounds enhanced (more than tenfold) the ability of the chlorate product to kill Salmonella and E. coli, but not Campylobacter. Further studies are needed before these compounds can be fed as feed additives to animals, although it is likely that nitrate preconditioning may be more near to market than the nitrocompounds, which may require more comprehensive review by regulatory authorities.
TI  - The beta-defensin gallinacin-6 is expressed in the chicken digestive tract and has antimicrobial activity against food-borne pathogens.
AB  - Food-borne pathogens are responsible for most cases of food poisoning in developed countries and are often associated with poultry products, including chicken. Little is known about the role of beta-defensins in the chicken digestive tract and their efficacy. In this study, the expression of chicken beta-defensin gallinacin-6 (Gal-6) and its antimicrobial activity against food-borne pathogens were investigated. Reverse transcription-PCR analysis showed high expression of Gal-6 mRNA in the esophagus and crop, moderate expression in the glandular stomach, and low expression throughout the intestinal tract. Putative transcription factor binding sites for nuclear factor kappa beta, activator protein 1, and nuclear factor interleukin-6 were found in the Gal-6 gene upstream region, which suggests a possible inducible nature of the Gal-6 gene. In colony-counting assays, strong bactericidal and fungicidal activity was observed, including bactericidal activity against food-borne pathogens Campylobacter jejuni, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Clostridium perfringens, and Escherichia coli. Treatment with 16 mug/ml synthetic Gal-6 resulted in a 3 log unit reduction in Clostridium perfringens survival within 60 min, indicating fast killing kinetics. Transmission electron microscopy examination of synthetic-Gal-6-treated Clostridium perfringens cells showed dose-dependent changes in morphology after 30 min, including intracellular granulation, cytoplasm retraction, irregular septum formation in dividing cells, and cell lysis. The high expression in the proximal digestive tract and broad antimicrobial activity suggest that chicken beta-defensin gallinacin-6 plays an important role in chicken innate host defense.
TI  - The contribution of cytolethal distending toxin to bacterial pathogenesis.
AB  - Cytolethal distending toxin (CDT) is a bacterial toxin that initiates a eukaryotic cell cycle block at the G2 stage prior to mitosis. CDT is produced by a number of bacterial pathogens including: Campylobacter species, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi, Shigella dystenteriae, enterohepatic Helicobacter species, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (the cause of aggressive periodontitis), and Haemophilus ducreyi (the cause of chancroid). The functional toxin is composed of three proteins; CdtB potentiates a cascade leading to cell cycle block, and CdtA and CdtC function as dimeric subunits, which bind CdtB and delivers it to the mammalian cell interior. Once inside the cell, CdtB enters the nucleus and exhibits a DNase I-like activity that results in DNA double-strand breaks. The eukaryotic cell responds to the DNA double-strand breaks by initiating a regulatory cascade that results in cell cycle arrest, cellular distension, and cell death. Mutations in CdtABC that cause any of the three subunits to lose function prevent the bacterial cell from inducing cytotoxicity. The result of CDT activity can differ somewhat depending on the eukaryotic cell types affected. Epithelial cells, endothelial cells, and keratinocytes undergo G2 cell cycle arrest, cellular distension, and death; fibroblasts undergo G1 and G2 arrest, cellular distension, and death; and immune cells undergo G2 arrest followed by apoptosis. CDT contributes to pathogenesis by inhibiting both cellular and humoral immunity via apoptosis of immune response cells, and by generating necrosis of epithelial-type cells and fibroblasts involved in the repair of lesions produced by pathogens resulting in slow healing and production of disease symptoms. Thus, CDT may function as a virulence factor in pathogens that produce the toxin.
TI  - Rapid separation and concentration of food-borne pathogens in food samples prior  to quantification by viable-cell counting and real-time PCR.
AB  - Buoyant density gradient centrifugation has been used to separate bacteria from complex food matrices, as well as to remove compounds that inhibit rapid detection methods, such as PCR, and to prevent false-positive results due to DNA originating from dead cells. Applying a principle of buoyant density gradient centrifugation, we developed a method for rapid separation and concentration following filtration and low- and high-speed centrifugation, as well as flotation and sedimentation buoyant density centrifugation, for 12 food-borne pathogens (Salmonella enterica, Escherichia coli, Yersinia enterocolitica, Campylobacter jejuni, Vibrio cholerae O139, Vibrio parahaemolyticus O3K6, Vibrio vulnificus, Providencia alcalifaciens, Aeromonas hydrophila, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Clostridium perfringens) in 13 different food homogenates. This method can be used prior to real-time quantitative PCR (RTi-qPCR) and viable-cell counting. Using this combined method, the target organisms in the food samples theoretically could be concentrated 250-fold and detected at cell concentrations as low as 10(1) to 10(3) CFU/g using the RTi-qPCR assay, and amounts as small as 10(0) to 10(1) CFU/g could be isolated using plate counting. The combined separation and concentration methods and RTi-qPCR confirmed within 3 h the presence of 10(1) to 10(2) CFU/g of Salmonella and C. jejuni directly in naturally contaminated chicken and the presence of S. aureus directly in remaining food items in a poisoning outbreak. These results illustrated the feasibility of using these assays for rapid inspection of bacterial food contamination during a real-world outbreak.
TI  - Berry phenolics: antimicrobial properties and mechanisms of action against severe human pathogens.
AB  - Antimicrobial activity and mechanisms of phenolic extracts of 12 Nordic berries were studied against selected human pathogenic microbes. The most sensitive bacteria on berry phenolics were Helicobacter pylori and Bacillus cereus. Campylobacter jejuni and Candida albicans were inhibited only with phenolic extracts of cloudberry, raspberry, and strawberry, which all were rich in ellagitannins. Cloudberry extract gave strong microbicidic effects on the basis of plate count with all studied strains. However, fluorescence staining of liquid cultures of virulent Salmonella showed viable cells not detectable by plate count adhering to cloudberry extract, whereas Staphylococcus aureus cells adhered to berry extracts were dead on the basis of their fluorescence and plate count. Phenolic extracts of cloudberry and raspberry disintegrated the outer membrane of examined Salmonella strains as indicated by 1-N-phenylnaphthylamine (NPN) uptake increase and analysis of liberation of [14C]galactose- lipopolysaccharide. Gallic acid effectively permeabilized the tested Salmonella strains, and significant increase in the NPN uptake was recorded. The stability of berry phenolics and their antimicrobial activity in berries stored frozen for a year were examined using Escherichia coli and nonvirulent Salmonella enterica sv. Typhimurium. The amount of phenolic compounds decreased in all berries, but their antimicrobial activity was not influenced accordingly. Cloudberry, in particular, showed constantly strong antimicrobial activity during the storage.
TI  - A survey of foodborne pathogens in bulk tank milk and raw milk consumption among  farm families in pennsylvania.
AB  - A 2-part study was conducted to determine the risk of exposure to human pathogens from raw milk. The first part of the study focused on determining raw milk consumption habits of dairy producers. A total of 248 dairy producers from 16 counties in Pennsylvania were surveyed. Overall, 105 (42.3%) of the 248 dairy producers consumed raw milk and 170 (68.5%) of the 248 dairy producers were aware of foodborne pathogens in raw milk. Dairy producers who were not aware of foodborne pathogens in raw milk were 2-fold more likely to consume raw milk compared with dairy producers who were aware of foodborne pathogens. The majority of dairy producers who consumed raw milk indicated that taste (72%) and convenience (60%) were the primary factors for consuming raw milk. Dairy producers who resided on the dairy farm were nearly 3-fold more likely to consume raw milk compared with those who lived elsewhere. In the second part of the study, bulk tank milk from the 248 participating dairy herds was examined for foodborne pathogens. Campylobacter jejuni (2%), Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (2.4%), Listeria monocytogenes (2.8%), Salmonella (6%), and Yersinia enterocolitica (1.2%) were detected in the milk samples. Salmonella isolates were identified as S. enterica serotype Typhimurium (n = 10) and S. enterica serotype Newport (n = 5). Of the 248 bulk tank milk samples, 32 (13%) contained > or = 1 species of bacterial pathogens. The findings of the study could assist in developing farm community-based educational programs on the risks of consuming raw milk.
TI  - Substrate specificity of bacterial oligosaccharyltransferase suggests a common transfer mechanism for the bacterial and eukaryotic systems.
AB  - The PglB oligosaccharyltransferase (OTase) of Campylobacter jejuni can be functionally expressed in Escherichia coli, and its relaxed oligosaccharide substrate specificity allows the transfer of different glycans from the lipid carrier undecaprenyl pyrophosphate to an acceptor protein. To investigate the substrate specificity of PglB, we tested the transfer of a set of lipid-linked polysaccharides in E. coli and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. A hexose linked to the C-6 of the monosaccharide at the reducing end did not inhibit the transfer of the O antigen to the acceptor protein. However, PglB required an acetamido group at the C-2. A model for the mechanism of PglB involving this functional group was proposed. Previous experiments have shown that eukaryotic OTases have the same requirement, suggesting that eukaryotic and prokaryotic OTases catalyze the transfer of oligosaccharides by a conserved mechanism. Moreover, we demonstrated the functional transfer of the C. jejuni glycosylation system into S. enterica. The elucidation of the mechanism of action and the substrate specificity of PglB represents the foundation for engineering glycoproteins that will have an impact on biotechnology.
TI  - PulseNet USA: a five-year update.
AB  - PulseNet USA is the molecular surveillance network for foodborne infections in the United States. Since its inception in 1996, it has been instrumental in detection, investigation and control of numerous outbreaks caused by Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli O157:[H7] (STEC O157), Salmonella enterica, Listeria monocytogenes, Shigella spp., and Campylobacter. This paper describes the current status of the network, including the methodologies used and its future possibilities. The currently preferred subtyping method in the network is pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), a proven highly discriminatory molecular subtyping method. New simpler sequencebased subtyping methods are under development and validation to complement and eventually replace PFGE. PulseNet is essentially a cluster detection network, but the data in the system will now also be used in attribution analyses of sporadic infections. The PulseNet platform will also be used as a primary tool in preparedness and response to acts of food bioterrorism.
TI  - Is the enthesitis-related arthritis subtype of juvenile idiopathic arthritis a form of chronic reactive arthritis?
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Enteric organisms are known to trigger reactive arthritis. The enthesitis-related arthritis (ERA) form of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) clinically resembles reactive arthritis. Therefore, we looked for a role of enteric bacteria in ERA. METHODS: Synovial fluid (SF) was obtained from 26 patients with ERA and 10 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Blood specimens were also obtained from patients with ERA and from 10 normal individuals. Lymphocyte proliferation assays were done on whole blood and SF mononuclear cells using as antigens crude lysates of the enteric bacteria Salmonella typhimurium, Yersinia enterocolitica, Shigella flexneri and Campylobacter jejuni. Crude lysate of Escherichia coli was used as a control antigen. HLA-B27 typing was done using the polymerase chain reaction. Homing of gut-specific T cells (CD103+) to the synovial compartment was studied using tri-colour flow cytometry. The antigen-specific cytokine profile was determined by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Antigen-specific lymphoproliferative responses were observed in 14 of 26 patients. Among these patients, 12 showed a response in SF (four each to S. typhimurium and C. jejuni, and in two each to S. flexneri and Y. enterocolitica), and two patients in blood (S. typhimurium in both). None of the healthy controls showed a response in the blood. Lymphoproliferative responses in SF were more frequent in patients with JIA (12/26) than in controls with RA (1/10, P < 0.05). Patients with an antigen-specific response had a higher ratio of SF/blood CD103+ T cells compared with those with no antigen-specific response (P < 0.01). Antigen-specific as well as mitogen-stimulated cytokine production showed a Th1 bias. CONCLUSION: Enteric bacteria may have a role in exacerbation of disease in patients with ERA. The immune response in patients with ERA is Th1-dominant.
TI  - Evaluation of bacterial and protozoal contamination of commercially available raw meat diets for dogs.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate bacterial and protozoal contamination of commercially available raw meat diets for dogs. DESIGN: Prospective longitudinal study. SAMPLE POPULATION: 240 samples from 20 raw meat diets for dogs (containing beef, lamb, chicken, or turkey), 24 samples from 2 dry dog foods, and 24 samples from 2 canned dog foods. PROCEDURE: Each product was purchased commercially on 4 dates approximately 2 months apart. Three samples from each product at each sampling period were evaluated via bacterial culture for non-type-specific Escherichia coli (NTSEC), Salmonella enterica, and Campylobacter spp. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed on selected isolates. Polymerase chain reaction assays were used to detect DNA from Cryptosporidium spp, Neospora spp, and Toxoplasma spp in samples obtained in the third and fourth sampling periods. RESULTS: One hundred fifty-three of 288 (53%) samples were contaminated with NTSEC. Both raw and prepared foods contained NTSEC during at least 1 culture period. Salmonella enterica was recovered from 17 (5.9%) samples, all of which were raw meat products. Campylobacter spp was not isolated from any samples. In 91 of 288 (31.6%) samples, there was no gram-negative bacterial growth before enrichment and in 48 of 288 (16.7%) samples, there was no aerobic bacterial growth before enrichment. Susceptibility phenotypes were variable. Cryptosporidium spp DNA was detected in 3 samples. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Bacterial contamination is common in commercially available raw meat diets, suggesting that there is a risk of foodborne illness in dogs fed these diets as well possible risk for humans associated with the dogs or their environments.
TI  - Monoclonal antibodies binding to the cell surface of Listeria monocytogenes serotype 4b.
AB  - Serotype 4b strains of the food-borne pathogen Listeria monocytogenes are responsible for a large portion of sporadic listeric infections and all major food-borne listeriosis outbreaks in humans. Hybridomas were produced from three fusions with lymphocytes of ND4 mice immunized either with the insoluble antigens of L. monocytogenes serotype 4b or with formalin-killed bacterial cells and screened for monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) reactive to L. monocytogenes serotype 4b. A set of 35 mAbs was identified by ELISA as having reactivity with both the insoluble antigen fraction and the whole-cell antigens. Thirteen of these mAbs belonged to immunoglobulin subclass G1 (IgG1), fifteen were IgG2a and seven mAbs were IgM. Only 20 out of the 35 mAbs were capable of detecting protein bands of various sizes ranging from 20 to 88 kDa in Western blots. Two of these mAbs, M2365 and M2367, were capable of binding to cell-surface antigens of live L. monocytogenes serotype 4b, as demonstrated by immunofluorescence microscopy and immunogold transmission electron microscopy. Immunofluorescence microscopy showed that M2365 and M2367 failed to bind to the cell surfaces of Escherichia coli O157 : H7, Salmonella enterica (serotype Typhimurium DT104) or Campylobacter jejuni. Evaluation of the cross-reactions of all 35 mAbs with whole-cell antigens of E. coli O157 : H7, S. Typhimurium, C. jejuni and Listeria innocua by ELISA indicated that the majority of the mAbs, including M2365 and M2367, did not cross-react with E. coli O157 : H7, S. Typhimurium or C. jejuni and showed no or a very weak reaction with L. innocua. Furthermore, M2365 and M2367 showed no reaction with whole-cell antigens derived from L. monocytogenes serotypes 1/2a, 1/2b and 3a, and from Listeria grayi, Listeria ivanovii and Listeria seeligeri, in an ELISA. Collectively, these data suggest that M2365 and M2367 have potential use in the development of immunological methods of laboratory diagnosis for L. monocytogenes serotype 4b in clinical or food samples.
TI  - Foodborne bacterial infection and hospitalization: a registry-based study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Foodborne bacterial gastrointestinal infections are important causes  of morbidity and mortality worldwide, and despite successful control programs in some developed countries, these infections continue to have a major impact on public health and economy. METHODS: On the basis of data from 3 national registries, we determined short- and long-term risks of hospitalization due to gastroenteritis, short-term complications, and long-term sequelae after infections with nontyphoid Salmonella enterica, Campylobacter species, Yersinia enterocolitica, diarrheagenic Escherichia coli, and Shigella species. RESULTS: Among 52,121 patients, 7524 (14.4%) were hospitalized with a diagnosis of gastroenteritis within 90 days after microbiological diagnosis. A total of 4941 patients (17.7%) with infections due to S. enterica and 1937 (10.8%) with infections due to Campylobacter species were admitted to the hospital. Complications, such as gastrointestinal perforation and invasive illness, occurred in 647 patients (1.2%). The risk of invasive illness was > 6-fold higher in patients with infections due to S. enterica (odds ratio [OR] compared with the general population, 30.3; 95% confidence interval [CI], 26.2-35.1) than in those with infections due to Campylobacter species (OR, 4.9; 95% CI, 3.5-6.8) (P < .001). Long-term sequelae were seen in 865 patients (1.7%). Among 1000 patients with infections due to S. enterica, 1820 days of hospital stay were attributable to gastroenteritis, complications, and long-term sequelae. The corresponding figure for Campylobacter infections was 714 days. CONCLUSIONS: Infections with bacteria that are usually foodborne cause considerable morbidity, in terms of severe gastroenteritis that requires admission to hospital, as well as complications and long-term sequelae. The risk of complications and sequelae depends on bacterial species, and nontyphoid Salmonella is particularly associated with a burden of severe morbidity.
TI  - Infections associated with cantaloupe consumption: a public health concern.
AB  - Fresh produce is an important part of a healthy diet and is consumed in greater quantity in the United States than ever before. Consumption of cantaloupe has recently been associated with several large outbreaks of infections in North America, highlighting the need for a better understanding of practices and processes that may contribute to contamination. We reviewed all cantaloupe-associated outbreaks that were reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and published in the literature. Twenty-three outbreaks occurred between 1984 and 2002; 1434 people became ill, 42 were hospitalized, and two died in these outbreaks. Aetiological agents in the outbreaks included five serotypes of Salmonella enterica, Campylobacter jejuni, Escherichia coli O157:H7, and norovirus. We reviewed processes contributing to cantaloupe contamination, conditions affecting survival and growth of bacterial pathogens on melons, and potential methods for sanitization. For maximum safety, industry, federal, and international partners must collaborate to ensure that appropriate interventions are in place to minimize the risk of contamination and prevent the growth of pathogens during cantaloupe production, processing, storage, and preparation.
TI  - Food safety knowledge of consumers and the microbiological and temperature status of their refrigerators.
AB  - The objectives of this study were to examine domestic food safety knowledge levels of consumers, establish the levels and incidence of bacterial contamination and operational temperatures in domestic refrigerators, and identify areas in which consumer food safety education is necessary in Ireland. A food safety knowledge questionnaire applied to a representative sample of households (n = 1,020) throughout the island of Ireland found the gaps in consumer food safety knowledge. Analysis of swab samples (n = 900) recovered from the domestic refrigerators in these households showed average total viable counts of 7.1 log CFU/cm2 and average total coliform counts of 4.0 log CFU/cm2. Analysis of swab samples also detected the incidence of Staphylococcus aureus (41%), Escherichia coli (6%), Salmonella enterica (7%), Listeria monocytogenes (6%), and Yersinia enterocolitica (2%). Campylobacter jejuni and E. coli O157:H7 were not detected in domestic refrigerators. The temperature profiles of a subset of the sampled refrigerators (100) were monitored for 72 h, and 59% were found to operate, on average, at temperatures above the recommended 5 degrees C. Knowledge and temperature survey results varied considerably, but consumers who scored better in terms of basic food safety knowledge had reduced levels of bacterial contamination in their refrigerators and reported a reduced incidence of food-associated illnesses. This study confirms the effect of basic food hygiene knowledge on hygienic practice and identifies specific areasfor emphasis in the development and delivery of effective food safety risk communication messages to consumers.
TI  - Rapid decay of Salmonella flagella antibodies during human gastroenteritis: a follow up study.
AB  - An indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) based on Salmonella re-polymerized flagella was employed to measure levels of immunoglobulin (Ig) G, IgM and IgA antibodies in sera from 303 Danish patients diagnosed with either Salmonella enteritidis or Salmonella typhimurium. The antibody-levels were assessed at one, three and six months after onset of salmonellosis, and sera from a control-group of 170 healthy blood donors were additionally analysed in order to establish cut-off values for the analysis. Cross-reactions to other Salmonella serotypes, as well as to Escherichia coli, Yersinia enterocolitica, Campylobacter jejuni, Campylobacter coli and Helicobacter pylori were observed. At one month after onset of symptoms, 70% of the patients recovering from a S. enteritidis infection carried detectable levels of anti-flagella antibodies, as did 77% of the patients recovering from S. typhimurium infection. Three months after onset of symptoms these detection rates had decreased to 46% and 40%; and six months after onset of symptoms the detection rates were 34% and 38%. This rapid decrease in the serum levels of flagella antibodies is in conflict with the "common knowledge" statement of a long-lasting anti-flagella immunoresponse. The present study suggests that such a tenacious statement is (or may be) inaccurate.
TI  - Mixed diarrhoeal infection caused by Vibrio cholerae and several other enteric pathogens in a 4-year-old child returning to Germany from Pakistan.
AB  - We report a mixed enteric infection in a 4-y-old child who returned from Pakistan with fever, vomiting and profuse diarrhoea leading to severe dehydration. Vibrio cholerae O1, Salmonella paratyphi A and Campylobacter coli were cultured from stool. Furthermore, Giardia lamblia antigen and hepatitis A RNA were detected. This is the first paediatric cholera case seen in Frankfurt/Main.
TI  - Ligand binding properties of bacterial hemoglobins and flavohemoglobins.
AB  - Bacterial hemoglobins and flavohemoglobins share a common globin fold but differ  otherwise in structural and functional aspects. The bases of these differences were investigated through kinetic studies on oxygen, carbon monoxide, and nitric oxide binding. The novel bacterial hemoglobins from Clostridium perfringens and Campylobacter jejuni and the flavohemoglobins from Bacillus subtilis and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi have been analyzed. Examination of the biochemical and ligand binding properties of these proteins shows a clear distinction between the two groups. Flavohemoglobins show a much greater tendency to autoxidation compared to bacterial hemoglobins. The differences in affinity for oxygen, carbon monoxide, and nitric oxide between bacterial hemoglobins and flavohemoglobins are mainly due to differences in the association rate constants. The second-order rate constants for oxygen and carbon monoxide binding to bacterial hemoglobins are severalfold higher than those for flavohemoglobins. A similar trend is observed for NO association with the oxidized iron(III) form of the proteins. No major differences are observed among the values obtained for the dissociation rate constants for the two groups of bacterial proteins studied, and these constants are all rather similar to those for myoglobin. Taken together, our data suggest that differences exist between the mechanisms of ligand binding to bacterial hemoglobins and flavohemoglobins, suggesting different functions in the cell.
TI  - Effect of the growth promoter avilamycin on emergence and persistence of antimicrobial resistance in enteric bacteria in the pig.
AB  - AIM: To assess the effect of the growth promoter avilamycin on emergence and persistence of resistance in enteric bacteria in the pig. METHODS AND RESULTS: Pigs (treated with avilamycin for 3 months and controls) were challenged with multi-resistant Salmonella Typhimurium DT104 and faecal counts were performed for enterococci, Escherichia coli, S. Typhimurium and Campylobacter (before, during and 5 weeks post-treatment). Representative isolates were tested for antibiotic resistance and for the presence of resistance genes. Avilamycin-resistant Enterococci faecalis (speciated by PCR) were isolated from the treated pigs and continued to be detected for the first week after treatment had ceased. The avilamycin-resistance gene was characterized by PCR as the emtA gene and speciation by PCR. MIC profiling confirmed that more than one strain of Ent. faecalis carried this gene. There was no evidence of increased antimicrobial resistance in the E. coli, Salmonella and Campylobacter populations, although there was a higher incidence of tetB positive E. coli in the treated pigs than the controls. CONCLUSION: Although avilamycin selects for resistance in the native enterococci population of the pig, no resistant isolates were detected beyond 1 week post-treatment. This suggests that resistant isolates were unable to persist once selective pressure was removed and were out-competed by the sensitive microflora. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Our data suggest the risk of resistant isolates becoming carcass contaminants and infecting humans could be minimized by introducing a withdrawal period after using avilamycin and prior to slaughter.
TI  - The prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibilities of Salmonella and Campylobacter in ducks in Taiwan.
AB  - Cloacal swabs were sampled from 100 duck farms in Taiwan between March 2000 and January 2001 for isolation and standard cultivation of Salmonella spp. and thermophilic Campylobacter spp. Salmonella spp. were isolated from 4.6% (91/2000) of ducks from 20% (20/100) of duck farms. Ten serotypes of Salmonella enterica were identified: S. Potsdam (31.9% of isolates), S. Dusseldorf (18.7%), S. Indiana (14.3%), S. Typhimurium (7.7%), S. Hadar (5.5%), S. Newport (4.4%), S. Derby (4.4%), S. Montevideo (2.2%), S. Schwarzengrund (2.2%), and S. Asinnine (1.1%). Isolation of S. Asinnine or S. Indiana from poultry had not hitherto been described in Taiwan. The salmonella isolation rate in ducklings under two weeks of age was significantly higher than the other age groups (P<0.05). Campylobacter spp. were isolated from 43.5% (1045/2400) of ducks from 92% (92/100) of duck farms. Among them, 991 isolates (94.8%) were identified as C. jejuni and 54 isolates (5.2%) as C. coli. The campylobacter isolation rate in ducklings under two weeks of age was significantly lower than other age groups (P<0.05). Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was conducted by the disk diffusion and E- test methods. The results indicated that Salmonella isolates were 100% susceptible to amikacin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, ceftraxone, cephalothin, ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, and polymyxin B. A markedly higher antimicrobial resistance to amoxicillin, florfenicol, flumequine, josamicin/trimethoprim, nalidixic acid, nitrofurantoin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, polymyxin B, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim and tetracycline was found in campylobacter isolates.
TI  - Use of molecular hydrogen as an energy substrate by human pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - Molecular hydrogen is produced as a fermentation by-product in the large intestine of animals and its production can be correlated with the digestibility of the carbohydrates consumed. Pathogenic Helicobacter species (Helicobacter pylori and H. hepaticus) have the ability to use H(2) through a respiratory hydrogenase, and it was demonstrated that the gas is present in the tissues colonized by these pathogens (the stomach and the liver respectively of live animals). Mutant strains of H. pylori unable to use H(2) are deficient in colonizing mice compared with the parent strain. On the basis of available annotated gene sequence information, the enteric pathogen Salmonella, like other enteric bacteria, contains three putative membrane-associated H(2)-using hydrogenase enzymes. From the analysis of gene-targeted mutants it is concluded that each of the three membrane-bound hydrogenases of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium are coupled with an H(2)-oxidizing respiratory pathway. From microelectrode probe measurements on live mice, H(2) could be detected at approx. 50 muM levels within the tissues (liver and spleen), which are colonized by Salmonella. The half-saturation affinity of whole cells of these pathogens for H(2) is much less than this, so it is expected that the (H(2)-utilizing) hydrogenase enzymes be saturated with the reducing substrate in vivo. All three enteric NiFe hydrogenase enzymes contribute to virulence of the bacterium in a typhoid fever-mouse model, and the combined removal of all three hydrogenases resulted in a strain that is avirulent and (in contrast with the parent strain) one that is not able to pass the intestinal tract to invade liver or spleen tissue. It is proposed that H(2) utilization and specifically its oxidation, coupled with a respiratory pathway, is required for energy production to permit growth and maintain efficient virulence of a number of pathogenic bacteria during infection of animals. These would be expected to include the Campylobacter jejuni, a bacterium closely related to Helicobacter, as well as many enteric bacteria (Escherichia coli, Shigella and Yersinia species).
TI  - Application of molecular genetic methods in diagnostics and epidemiology of food-borne bacterial pathogens.
AB  - Salmonella enterica, Campylobacter and Yersinia species, Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC), Listeria monocytogenes and Clostridium perfringens are the bacterial pathogens constituting the greatest burden of food-borne disease in Finland. Several molecular genetic methods have been applied to diagnose, discriminate and survey these bacteria. PCR, PCR-RFLP and PFGE are the most widely and successfully used. However, these methods are unable to replace conventional and internationally standardised phenotyping. Electronic database libraries of the different genomic profiles will enable continuous surveillance of infections and detection of possible infection clusters at an early stage. Furthermore, whole-genome sequence data have opened up new insights into epidemiological surveillance. Laboratory-based surveillance performed in a timely manner and exploiting adequate methods, and co-operation at local, national and international levels are among the key elements in preventing food-borne diseases. This paper reviews different applications of molecular genetic methods for investigating enteric bacterial pathogens and gives examples of the methods successfully used in diagnostics and epidemiological studies in Finland.
TI  - Outbreaks of enteric infections caused by multiple pathogens associated with calves at a farm day camp.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Transmission of enteric pathogens at venues where the public contacts farm animals is a growing problem, particularly among children. In 2000 and again in 2001, enteric illness outbreaks caused by multiple pathogens occurred at a farm day camp for children in Minnesota. METHODS: Camp attendees were interviewed about illness history and potential exposures each year. Stool samples from children and calves at the camp were tested for enteric pathogens. RESULTS: Eighty-four illnesses were documented among camp attendees in the 2 outbreaks; laboratory-confirmed infections included Cryptosporidium parvum (17 cases), Escherichia coli O157:H7 (4), non-O157 Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) (7) and Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium and Campylobacter jejuni (1 each). Kindergarten-fourth grade children provided 1-on-1 care for a bottle-fed calf. Sixty of 83 calves tested carried at least 1 pathogen, including Giardia spp. (26 calves), C. parvum (25), non-O157 STEC (17), Campylobacter spp. (11), 3 serotypes of Salmonella enterica (10) and E. coli O157:H7 (2). Risk factors among children included caring for an ill calf and getting visible manure on their hands. Always washing hands with soap after touching a calf and washing hands before going home were protective. Prevention measures implemented in 2000 failed to prevent the second outbreak. CONCLUSIONS: Calves were the reservoir of multiple enteric pathogens for children at a farm day camp. Health care providers should consider numerous zoonotic pathogens in patients presenting with gastroenteritis after contact with cattle. Public health officials should help venue operators prospectively implement published guidelines to prevent zoonotic disease transmission.
TI  - Bacterial flora of free-living double-crested cormorant (Phalacrocorax auritus) chicks on Prince Edward Island, Canada, with reference to enteric bacteria and antibiotic resistance.
AB  - Cloacal and pharyngeal swabs from 100 tree-nesting Double-crested cormorant (DCC) chicks were examined by culture for commensal and potentially pathogenic bacteria. No Salmonella or Erysipelothrix were isolated from the cloacal swabs. Twenty-two cloacal swabs were positive for Campylobacter, of which 14 were C. jejuni, C. coli, and 1 C. lari. None belonged to common serotypes isolated from humans or animals in recent years in Canada. Tests for antimicrobial drug resistance among 187 commensal Escherichia coli isolates from the cloacal swabs indicated that < or =5% were resistant to any of the 12 antibiotics tested. This contrasts with the frequently high resistance rates among E. coli isolates from poultry. Pharyngeal swabs from DCC were negative for Pasteurella multocida. Culture of cloacal swabs from 100 ground-nesting DCC chicks resulted in the recovery of 19 Salmonella isolates, all of which were S. enterica serotype Typhimurium. None of these isolates were resistant to any of the 12 antibiotics tested. Altogether, these findings suggest that DCC from this region are not being colonized with commensal or potentially pathogenic enteric bacteria from agricultural or human sources and that enteric bacteria isolated from these birds are unlikely to contribute to a gene pool of antimicrobial drug resistance.
TI  - Nonimmunized egg yolk powder can suppress the colonization of Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli O157:H7, and Campylobacter jejuni in laying hens.
AB  - If colonized, poultry shed enteric pathogens in the feces. Of those that colonize poultry Salmonella spp., Campylobacter jejuni (C. jejuni), and Escherichia coli (E. coli) O157:H7 are the most concern to the industry. The authors previously discovered that the introduction of 5% dried nonimmunized egg yolk powder in the regular feed could eliminate and prevent Salmonella enteritidis intestinal colonization of laying hens. Hence, the efficacy of nonimmunized dried egg yolk powder supplement in controlling the colonization of laying hens with Salmonella typhimurium (S. typhimurium), C. jejuni, and E. coli O157:H7 was investigated in this study. The 10% (wt/ wt) egg yolk powder eliminated S. typhimurium after 2 wk of feeding and the 5 and 7.5% (wt/wt) supplements significantly (P < 0.05) reduced the frequency of colonization. Similarly, 7.5 and 10% egg yolk powder reduced the colonization of C. jejuni and E. coli O157:H7 significantly (P < 0.05) after 1 wk of feeding. In the prevention trial, pathogen-free chickens were fed supplemented feed (10% egg yolk powder) for 4 wk and were then infected. S. typhimurium was prevented from colonizing the intestine throughout the 4-wk test, and E. coli O157:H7 colonization was delayed for 2 wk. C. jejuni and E. coli O157:H7 populations in the intestine were significantly (P < 0.05) suppressed by egg yolk powder supplementation throughout the test. None of the supplement concentrations affected BW or the mean weight and number of the eggs laid per hen. At the end of the study, the organisms were absent or significantly (P < 0.05) reduced in the intestine, ovary, oviduct, and spleen of hens fed the egg yolk powder treatment. This study indicates that nonimmunized egg yolk powder is able to reduce the frequency of colonization of foodborne pathogens and prevent these organisms from colonizing the intestinal tract. Addition of egg yolk powder to the regular feed at a concentration of 7.5 to 10% (wt/wt) may be a simple means of reducing or inhibiting S. typhimurium, C. jejuni, and E. coli O157:H7 colonization in laying hens.
TI  - Chemotaxis-guided movements in bacteria.
AB  - Motile bacteria often use sophisticated chemotaxis signaling systems to direct their movements. In general, bacterial chemotactic signal transduction pathways have three basic elements: (1) signal reception by bacterial chemoreceptors located on the membrane; (2) signal transduction to relay the signals from membrane receptors to the motor; and (3) signal adaptation to desensitize the initial signal input. The chemotaxis proteins involved in these signal transduction pathways have been identified and extensively studied, especially in the enterobacteria Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium. Chemotaxis-guided bacterial movements enable bacteria to adapt better to their natural habitats via moving toward favorable conditions and away from hostile surroundings. A variety of oral microbes exhibits motility and chemotaxis, behaviors that may play important roles in bacterial survival and pathogenesis in the oral cavity.
TI  - Application of oligonucleotide array technology for the rapid detection of pathogenic bacteria of foodborne infections.
AB  - A rapid and accurate method for detection for common pathogenic bacteria in foodborne infections was established by using oligonucleotide array technology. Nylon membrane was used as the array support. A mutation region of the 23S rRNA gene was selected as the discrimination target from 14 species (genera) of bacteria causing foodborne infections and two unrelated bacterial species. A pair of universal primers was designed for PCR amplification of the 23S rRNA gene. Twenty-one species (genera)-specific oligonucleotide detection probes were synthesized and spotted onto the nylon membranes. The 23S rRNA gene amplification products of 14 species of pathogenic bacteria were hybridized to the oligonucleotide array. Hybridization results were analyzed with digoxigenin-linked enzyme reaction. Results indicated that nine species of pathogenic bacteria (Escherichia coli, Campylobacter jejuni, Shigella dysenteriae, Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Proteus vulgaris, Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes and Clostridium botulinum) showed high sensitivity and specificity for the oligonucleotide array. Two other species (Salmonella enterica and Yersinia enterocolitica) gave weak cross-reaction with E. coli, but the reaction did not affect their detection. After redesigning the probes, positive hybridization results were obtained with Staphylococcus aureus, but not with Clostridium perfringens and Streptococcus pyogenes. The oligonucleotide array can also be applied to samples collected in clinical settings of foodborne infections. The superiority of oligonucleotide array over other tests lies on its rapidity, accuracy and efficiency in the diagnosis, treatment and control of foodborne infections.
TI  - Improvement in the detection rate of diarrhoeagenic bacteria in human stool specimens by a rapid real-time PCR assay.
AB  - A rapid laboratory system has been developed and evaluated that can simultaneously identify major diarrhoeagenic bacteria, including Salmonella enterica, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Campylobacter jejuni and Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli, in stool specimens by real-time PCR. Specific identification was achieved by using selective TaqMan probes, detecting two targets in each pathogen. A positive result was scored only when both targets of a pathogen were amplified and the difference between threshold cycles for detection was less than five. Diagnosis of enteric bacterial infections using this highly sensitive method, including DNA extraction and real-time PCR, requires only 3 h. Forty stool specimens related to suspected food poisoning outbreaks were analysed: 16 (40%) of these samples were found to be positive for diarrhoeagenic bacteria using a conventional culture method; 28 (70%) were positive using the real-time PCR assay. Of the 12 PCR-positive but culture-negative cases, 11 patients had consumed pathogen-contaminated or high-risk food. Analysis of faecal samples from 105 outpatients who complained of diarrhoea and/or abdominal pain identified 19 (18%) patients as being positive for diarrhoeagenic bacteria using the culture method. An additional six (6%) patients were found to be positive by PCR analysis.
TI  - Molecular characterization of class 1 integrons from Irish thermophilic Campylobacter spp.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: In this study a large random collection (n = 378) of Irish thermophilic Campylobacter isolates were investigated for the presence of integrons, genetic elements associated with the dissemination of antimicrobial resistance. METHODS: Purified genomic DNA from each isolate was analysed by PCR for the presence of class 1 integrons. Four gene cassette-associated amplicons were completely characterized. RESULTS: Sixty-two of the isolates possessed a complete class 1 integron with a recombined gene cassette located within a 1.0 kb amplicon containing an aadA2 gene. This cassette was present in both Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli isolates and following sequence analysis was shown to be similar to sequences recently reported in Salmonella enterica Hadar and on an 85 kb plasmid conferring quinolone resistance in Escherichia coli. CONCLUSIONS: Aminoglycoside aadA2-encoding class 1 integrons were identified among unrelated Campylobacter spp. Amino acid sequence comparisons revealed identical structures in both Salmonella and E. coli. The presence of class 1 integrons in Campylobacter spp. may be significant should these organisms enter the food chain and especially when antimicrobial treatment for severe infections is being considered.
TI  - Prevalence and characteristics of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp. and Campylobacter spp. isolated from slaughtered sheep in Switzerland.
AB  - Caecum samples collected from 653 slaughtered sheep from two Swiss abattoirs were examined. The aim of this study was: (i) to determine the prevalence of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC), Salmonella spp. and Campylobacter spp.; (ii) to further characterize isolated strains; and (iii) to discuss the results obtained with their relevance to food safety. The percentage of samples testing positive for STEC by a polymerase chain reaction was 29.9%. The prevalence of positive Salmonella spp. samples was 11.0% and of Campylobacter spp. 17.5%. In 55.3% of the 76 isolated non-O157 STEC strains, stx2 variants (mostly stx2d) were detected. Additional virulence factors were harbored by 55.3% of the STEC strains, 10.5% of them being eae positive, 55.3% ehxA positive and 2.6% astA positive. All isolated salmonella were identified as Salmonella enterica subsp. diarizonae serovar 61:k:1,5,(7). Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was performed for genotyping and 22 different restriction endonuclease digestion profiles were found among these strains for the different farms of origin. Of the 114 isolated Campylobacter spp. strains, 64.9% were shown to be Campylobacter jejuni and 35.1% Campylobacter coli, nine strains showed resistance against tetracycline, ciprofloxacin/nalidixic acid or streptomycin. In conclusion, sheep are a reservoir for the pathogens of latent zoonoses as non-O157 STEC, S. enterica subsp. diarizonae and Campylobacter spp. The maintenance of slaughter hygiene is consequently of crucial importance. It can be measured in daily practice by "slaughter-process-controls" and regular microbiological monitoring of carcasses. These are valuable tools for verifying slaughter hygiene according to hazard analysis critical control point principles.
TI  - Detection of PCR amplicons from bacterial pathogens using microsphere agglutination.
AB  - For rapid and inexpensive detection of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplicons, a novel microsphere agglutination assay has been developed. PCR is carried out using biotinylated forward and reverse primers, and the amplified DNA fragments are able to agglutinate streptavidin-coated microspheres (5.7 microm in diameter). Purification of PCR amplicons is unnecessary when initial primer concentrations are 250 nM. Agglutination can be identified visually within 2 min without any additional equipment or reagents. Using listeriolysin (lisA)-specific biotinylated primers, we have successfully detected and identified Listeria monocytogenes lisA+ cells among Salmonella typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus, Campylobacter jejuni and Escherichia coli O157:H7 cells. The simplicity of this protocol considerably reduces the time and cost of diagnostic PCR experiments. This procedure is potentially useful for various studies and field applications.
TI  - Detection of Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium by using a rapid, array-based immunosensor.
AB  - The multianalyte array biosensor (MAAB) is a rapid analysis instrument capable of detecting multiple analytes simultaneously. Rapid (15-min), single-analyte sandwich immunoassays were developed for the detection of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, with a detection limit of 8 x 10(4) CFU/ml; the limit of detection was improved 10-fold by lengthening the assay protocol to 1 h. S. enterica serovar Typhimurium was also detected in the following spiked foodstuffs, with minimal sample preparation: sausage, cantaloupe, whole liquid egg, alfalfa sprouts, and chicken carcass rinse. Cross-reactivity tests were performed with Escherichia coli and Campylobacter jejuni. To determine whether the MAAB has potential as a screening tool for the diagnosis of asymptomatic Salmonella infection of poultry, chicken excretal samples from a private, noncommercial farm and from university poultry facilities were tested. While the private farm excreta gave rise to signals significantly above the buffer blanks, none of the university samples tested positive for S. enterica serovar Typhimurium without spiking; dose-response curves of spiked excretal samples from university-raised poultry gave limits of detection of 8 x 10(3) CFU/g.
TI  - Antibacterial activities of phenolic benzaldehydes and benzoic acids against Campylobacter jejuni, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, and Salmonella enterica.
AB  - We evaluated the bactericidal activities of 35 benzaldehydes, 34 benzoic acids, and 1 benzoic acid methyl ester against Campylobacter jejuni, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes, and Salmonella enterica when these compounds were substituted on the benzene ring with 0, 1, 2, or 3 hydroxy (OH) and/or methoxy (OCH3) groups in a pH 7.0 buffer. Dose-response plots were used to determine the percentage of the sample that induced a 50% decrease in CFU after 60 min (BA50). Of the 70 compounds tested, 24 were found to be active against all four pathogens, and additional 4, 10, and 12 were found to be active against three, two, and one of the pathogens, respectively. C. jejuni was approximately 100 times as sensitive as the other three pathogens. The 10 compounds that were most active against the four pathogens (with average BA50 values ranging from 0.026 to 0.166) and are candidates for studies of activity in foods or for disinfections were 2,4,6-trihydroxybenzaldehyde, 2,5-dihydroxybenzaldehyde, 2,3,4-trihydroxybenzaldehyde, 2-hydroxy-5-methoxybenzaldehyde, 2,3-dihydroxybenzaldehyde, 2-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzaldehyde, 4-hydroxy-2,6-dimethoxybenzaldehyde, 2,5-dihydroxybenzaldehyde, 2,4-dihydroxybenzaldehyde. and 2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Comparison of the chemical structures of the test compounds and their activities revealed that (i) the aldehyde (CHO) group was more active than the carboxyl (COOH) group whether or not OH groups were present; (ii) compounds were most active with trisubstituted OH > disubstituted OH > monosubstituted OH; (iii) for disubstituted derivatives, 2-OH enhanced activities were exhibited by benzaldehyde but not by benzoic acid; (iv) compounds were more active with OH than with OCH3, irrespective of the position of substitution on the benzene ring; (v) compounds with mixed OH and OCH3 groups exhibited variable results, i.e., in some cases OCH3 groups enhanced activity and in other cases they did not; (vi) methoxybenzoic acids were largely inactive; and (vii) gallic acid was 20 times as active against S. enterica at pH 7.0 as it was at pH 3.7, suggesting that the ionization of its OH groups may enhance bactericidal activity.
TI  - Toward an international standard for PCR-based detection of food-borne thermotolerant Campylobacters: validation in a multicenter collaborative trial.
AB  - As part of a European research project, the performance of a PCR assay to detect  food-borne thermotolerant campylobacters (Campylobacter jejuni, C. coli, and C. lari) was evaluated through an international collaborative trial involving 12 participating laboratories. DNA from 10 target and 8 nontarget strains was tested, and the results were reported as the presence of a positive signal after gel electrophoresis. The overall inclusivity (sensitivity) was 93.7%, and the exclusivity (specificity) was 100%. The results indicate that the assay can become an international standard and can be confidently applied in microbiological laboratories.
TI  - Reduction of bacteria on pork carcasses associated with chilling method.
AB  - In addition to reducing the temperature of pork carcasses immediately after slaughter and before fabrication, blast chilling (snap chill) or conventional chilling can reduce bacterial populations associated with fresh meats. However, there is little information on bacteria survival resulting from the freeze or chill injury of meat products. In this study, porcine fecal slurries with and without pathogens (Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella Typhimurium, and Campylobacter coli) were inoculated onto skin-on and skin-off pork surfaces and subjected to industry-specific blast or conventional chilling conditions. A thin agar layer method was used for the recovery of freeze- or chill-injured cells. Test results indicated that there were no statistically significant (P > 0.05) differences between blast and conventional chilling treatments with respect to the reduction of high and low inoculation levels of mesophilic aerobic bacteria, total coliforms, or Escherichia coli on either skin-on or skin-off surfaces. Chilling treatments did not differ significantly (P > 0.05) with respect to their ability to reduce low (3 log10 CFU/cm2) levels of L. monocytogenes and Salmonella Typhimurium. However, C. coli was reduced to undetectable levels, even after enrichment, on pork surfaces inoculated with low levels (3 log10 CFU/cm2) and subjected to blast chilling. Blast and conventional chilling treatments were more effective against all pathogenic bacterial populations when pork surfaces where inoculated at high levels (5 log10 CFU/cm2). The effects of chilling techniques on microbial populations could provide pork processors with an additional intervention for pork slaughter or information to modify and/or improve the chilling process. The information obtained from this study has the potential to serve as a means of producing a microbiologically safer product.
TI  - Prevalence of enteroaggregative Escherichia coli among children with and without  diarrhea in Switzerland.
AB  - In a prospective study between July 1999 and September 2000, stool specimens of children below the age of 16 years with (n = 187) and without (n = 137) diarrhea were tested for the presence of enterovirulent bacteria by standard culture methods and by PCR. Targets for the PCR were the plasmid pCVD432 for enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAEC), the verotoxin 1 and verotoxin 2 genes for enterohemorrhagic E. coli, ipaH for enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC) and Shigella spp., genes coding for heat-stable and heat-labile toxins for enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC), and the eaeA gene for enteropathogenic E. coli. The following bacteria could be associated with diarrhea: Salmonella enterica (P = 0.001), Campylobacter spp. (P = 0.036), ETEC (P = 0.012), and EAEC (P = 0.006). The detection of EAEC, ETEC, and S. enterica was strongly associated with a history of recent travel outside of Switzerland. EAEC isolates were found in the specimens of 19 (10.2%) of 187 children with diarrhea and in those of 3 (2.2%) of 137 children without diarrhea (P = 0.006) and were the most frequently detected bacteria associated with diarrhea. Among the children below the age of 5 years, the specimens of 18 (11.9%) of 151 with diarrhea were positive for EAEC, while this agent was found in the specimens of 2 (2.2%) of 91 controls (P = 0.007). Enteropathogenic E. coli isolates were found in the specimens of 30 (16.4%) of the patients and in those of 15 (10.9%) of the controls, with similar frequencies in all age groups (P > 0.05). We conclude that EAEC bacteria are involved in a significant proportion of diarrhea cases among children. Children younger than 5 years of age are more often affected by EAEC than older children.
TI  - Rapid detection of Campylobacter coli, C. jejuni, and Salmonella enterica on poultry carcasses by using PCR-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
AB  - Contamination of retail poultry by Campylobacter spp. and Salmonella enterica is  a significant source of human diarrheal disease. Isolation and identification of these microorganisms require a series of biochemical and serological tests. In this study, Campylobacter ceuE and Salmonella invA genes were used to design probes in PCR-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), as an alternative to conventional bacteriological methodology, for the rapid detection of Campylobacter jejuni, Campylobacter coli, and S. enterica from poultry samples. With PCR-ELISA (40 cycles), the detection limits for Salmonella and Campylobacter were 2 x 10(2) and 4 x 10(1) CFU/ml, respectively. ELISA increased the sensitivity of the conventional PCR method by 100- to 1,000-fold. DNA was extracted from carcass rinses and tetrathionate enrichments and used in PCR-ELISA for the detection of Campylobacter and S. enterica, respectively. With PCR-ELISA, Salmonella was detected in 20 of 120 (17%) chicken carcass rinses examined, without the inclusion of an enrichment step. Significant correlation was observed between PCR-ELISA and cultural methods (kappa = 0.83; chi-square test, P < 0.001) with only one false negative (1.67%) and four false positives (6.67%) when PCR-ELISA was used to screen 60 tetrathionate enrichment cultures for Salmonella. With PCR-ELISA, we observed a positive correlation between the ELISA absorbance (optical density at 405 nm) and the campylobacter cell number in carcass rinse, as determined by standard culture methods. Overall, PCR-ELISA is a rapid and cost-effective approach for the detection and enumeration of Salmonella and Campylobacter bacteria on poultry.
TI  - Comparison of recovery methods for freeze-injured Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella Typhimurium, and Campylobacter coli in cell suspensions and associated with pork surfaces.
AB  - Cells injured as a result of freezing, heating, and acidification treatments may  not grow during conventional microbiological procedures owing to the presence of selective agents, compounds, or dyes in the media, impairing the cell's ability to repair itself and grow. Injured cells can be recovered by combining selective and nonselective media into a single system. With such combinations, the diffusion of the selective compounds or dyes is controlled, allowing for the resuscitation of injured cells of interest while also inhibiting the growth of undesirable background microflora. In this study, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella Typhimurium, and Campylobacter coli suspended in buffer or associated with pork surfaces were subjected to a freeze-thaw cycle (-15 degrees C for 24 h, 4 degrees C for 4 h). Following treatments, freeze-injured cells were plated on appropriate media for the overlay (OV), thin agar layer (TAL), and Lutri plate (LP) recovery methods. The levels of L. monocytogenes and Salmonella Typhimurium recovered from cell suspensions and pork surfaces by the TAL, OV, and LP methods following freeze treatments were not statistically different (P > 0.05) from recovery levels associated with nonselective media. Conversely, levels of pathogens on selective media were significantly reduced compared with those for the other methods employed. The TAL method's recovery of C. coli was not significantly different from that achieved with the nonselective media. Overall, the results presented in this study demonstrate that the TAL method not only was easier to perform, but also allowed improved isolation of single colonies for further characterization. This study may provide researchers with better methods to determine the effectiveness of industry-employed chilling processes in reducing pathogenic bacteria associated with red meat surfaces.
TI  - Immunological characterization of the Campylobacter jejuni 72Dz/92 cjaD gene product and its fusion with B subunit of E. coli LT toxin.
AB  - Campylobacter jejuni 72Dz/92 cjaD gene, orthologue of C. jejuni NCTC 11168 cj0113, C. jejuni M275 omp18 and C. jejuni ATCC 29428 omp18, has been cloned, sequenced and analysed from the viewpoint of its immunological attributes. Neither the 5' nor 3' fragment of the cjaD encodes protein capable of reacting with anti-Campylobacter antibodies. Several fusions of the cjaD with eltB, which encodes B subunit of the E. coli LT toxin, have been constructed. The hybrid proteins, which differ in respect to their cellular localization, retain the ability to react with GM1 and are recognized by the antibodies specific for both moieties of the proteins. The fusion protein equipped with signal sequence, reveals a stronger affinity to GM1 than its equivalent which is unable to cross the inner membrane. Two recombinant plasmids (pUWM405 expressing both LTB and CjaD proteins and pUWM299 containing cjaD gene fused into 3' end of Escherichia coli eltB gene lacking signal sequence) were introduced into avirulent Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium strain where they are stably maintained.
TI  - A 5-year study of the bacterial pathogens associated with acute diarrhoea on the  island of Crete, Greece, and their resistance to antibiotics.
AB  - During a 5-year period (1995-1999) a total of 7090 stool samples obtained from patients with acute diarrhoea, mostly community-acquired, were examined for bacterial pathogens, in the Greek island of Crete. One or more enteric pathogens were isolated from 987 patients (14%). Salmonella enterica were the most commonly isolated bacteria (6%), followed by Campylobacter spp. (4.2%), and enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) (1.8%). Yersinia enterocolitica (0.6%), Shigella spp. (0.3%), and Aeromonas hydrophila (0.04%), were less frequently isolated. Clostridium difficile was isolated from 65 out of 451 diarrhoeal specimens examined (14.4%). Toxin B was detected in all cases. No verotoxigenic E. coli strains were identified. Resistance to ampicillin was observed in 31.5% of the Salmonella, 58.3% of the Shigella and 31.5% of the EPEC isolates. Resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was observed in 4.4% of the Salmonella, 30.5% of the Shigella, and 18.5% of the EPEC isolates. High percentages of resistance to quinolones (44.5% to norfloxacin, and 40.5% to ciprofloxacin), were found among Campylobacter isolates, while resistance to erythromycin was observed in 14.9% of them. With the present study we continue the surveillance of bacterial pathogens associated with diarrhoeal disease on the island of Crete.

TI  - Bactericidal activities of plant essential oils and some of their isolated constituents against Campylobacter jejuni, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, and Salmonella enterica.
AB  - An improved method of sample preparation was used in a microplate assay to evaluate the bactericidal activity levels of 96 essential oils and 23 oil compounds against Campylobacter jejuni, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes, and Salmonella enterica obtained from food and clinical sources. Bactericidal activity (BA50) was defined as the percentage of the sample in the assay mixture that resulted in a 50% decrease in CFU relative to a buffer control. Twenty-seven oils and 12 compounds were active against all four species of bacteria. The oils that were most active against C. jejuni (with BA50 values ranging from 0.003 to 0.009) were marigold, ginger root, jasmine, patchouli, gardenia, cedarwood, carrot seed, celery seed, mugwort, spikenard, and orange bitter oils; those that were most active against E. coli (with BA50 values ranging from 0.046 to 0.14) were oregano, thyme, cinnamon, palmarosa, bay leaf, clove bud, lemon grass, and allspice oils; those that were most active against L monocytogenes (with BA50 values ranging from 0.057 to 0.092) were gardenia, cedarwood, bay leaf, clove bud, oregano, cinnamon, allspice, thyme, and patchouli oils; and those that were most active against S. enterica (with BA50 values ranging from 0.045 to 0.14) were thyme, oregano, cinnamon, clove bud, allspice, bay leaf, palmarosa, and marjoram oils. The oil compounds that were most active against C. jejuni (with BA50 values ranging from 0.003 to 0.034) were cinnamaldehyde, estragole, carvacrol, benzaldehyde, citral, thymol, eugenol, perillaldehyde, carvone R, and geranyl acetate; those that were most active against E. coli (with BA50 values ranging from 0.057 to 0.28) were carvacrol, cinnamaldehyde, thymol, eugenol, salicylaldehyde, geraniol, isoeugenol, citral, perillaldehyde, and estragole; those that were most active against L monocytogenes (with BA50 values ranging from 0.019 to 0.43) were cinnamaldehyde, eugenol, thymol, carvacrol, citral, geraniol, perillaldehyde, carvone S, estragole, and salicylaldehyde; and those that were most active against S. enterica (with BA50 values ranging from 0.034 to 0.21) were thymol, cinnamaldehyde, carvacrol, eugenol, salicylaldehyde, geraniol, isoeugenol, terpineol, perillaldehyde, and estragole. The possible significance of these results with regard to food microbiology is discussed.
TI  - Quorum sensing and production of autoinducer-2 in Campylobacter spp., Escherichia coli O157:H7, and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium in foods.
AB  - Autoinducer molecules are utilized by gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria to regulate density-dependent gene expression by a mechanism known as quorum sensing. PCR and DNA sequencing results showed that Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli possessed luxS, which is responsible for autoinducer-2 (AI-2) production. Using a Vibrio harveyi luminescence assay, the production of AI-2 was observed in milk, chicken broth, and brucella broth by C. coli, C. jejuni, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, and Escherichia coli O157:H7 under different conditions.
TI  - Characterization of the Campylobacter jejuni heptosyltransferase II gene, waaF, provides genetic evidence that extracellular polysaccharide is lipid A core independent.
AB  - Campylobacter jejuni produces both lipooligosaccharide (LOS) and a higher-molecular-weight polysaccharide that is believed to form a capsule. The role of these surface polysaccharides in C. jejuni-mediated enteric disease is unclear; however, epitopes associated with the LOS are linked to the development of neurological complications. In Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium the waaF gene encodes a heptosyltransferase, which catalyzes the transfer of the second L-glycero-D-manno-heptose residue to the core oligosaccharide moiety of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and mutation of waaF results in a truncated core oligosaccharide. In this report we confirm experimentally that C. jejuni gene Cj1148 encodes the heptosyltransferase II enzyme, WaaF. The Campylobacter waaF gene complements an S. enterica serovar Typhimurium waaF mutation and restores the ability to produce full-sized lipopolysaccharide. To examine the role of WaaF in C. jejuni, waaF mutants were constructed in strains NCTC 11168 and NCTC 11828. Loss of heptosyltransferase activity resulted in the production of a truncated core oligosaccharide, failure to bind specific ligands, and loss of serum reactive GM(1), asialo-GM(1), and GM(2) ganglioside epitopes. The mutation of waaF did not affect the higher-molecular-weight polysaccharide supporting the production of a LOS-independent capsular polysaccharide by C. jejuni. The exact structural basis for the truncation of the core oligosaccharide was verified by comparative chemical analysis. The NCTC 11168 core oligosaccharide differs from that known for HS:2 strain CCUG 10936 in possessing an extra terminal disaccharide of galactose-beta(1,3) N-acetylgalactosamine. In comparison, the waaF mutant possessed a truncated molecule consistent with that observed with waaF mutants in other bacterial species.
TI  - An antibody-immobilized capillary column as a bioseparator/bioreactor for detection of Escherichia coil O157:H7 with absorbance measurement.
AB  - A capillary-column-based bioseparator/bioreactor was developed for detection of Escherichia coli O157:H7 by chemically immobilizing anti-E. coli O157:H7 antibodies onto the inner wall of the column, forming the "sandwich" immunocomplexes (immobilized antibody-E. coli O157: H7-enzyme-labeled antibody) after the sample and the enzyme-labeled antibody passed through the column and detecting the absorbance of the product in the bioreactor with an optical detector. The effects of the blocking agent, flow rate of samples and substrates, buffer, MgCl2, and pH on the detection of E. coli O157:H7 were investigated. The parameters, 2% BSA in 1.0 x 10-2 M, pH 7.4, PBS as the blocking agent, 0.5 mL/h as the sample flow rate, 1.0 x 10(-2) M MgCl2, and 2.0 x 10(-4) M p-nitrophenyl phosphate in 1.0 M, pH 9.0 Tris buffer as the substrate for the enzymatic reaction, and 1.0 mL/h as the substrate flow rate, were used in the bioseparator/bioreactor system for detection of E. coli O157:H7. The selectivity of the system was checked, and other pathogens, including Salmonella typhimurium, Campylobacterjejuni, and Listeria monocytogenes, had no interference with the detection of E. coli O157:H7. Its working range was from 5.0 x 10(2) to 5.0 x 10(6) cfu/mL, and the total assay time was < 1.5 h without any enrichment. The relative standard deviation was approximately 2.0-7.3%.
TI  - Emerging food-borne pathogens.
AB  - The epidemiology of foodborne diseases is changing. While in many developing nations the efficient treatment of diarrhoeal diseases through oral rehydration has probably led to the prevention of many food related deaths, the underlying problems have not been solved. In these countries, the disease incidence of food-and waterborne disease is still increasing, and now data from other parts of the world indicate that new foodborne pathogens have emerged as important public health problems. Over the last two decades, bacterial infections caused by Campylobacter and enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli have emerged, well-recognized pathogens, such as Salmonella eoteritidis, have increased dramatically in disease incidence and important foodborne pathogens have become increasingly resistant to antimicrobial agents. The future strategy for prevention of foodborne disease should be founded in scientifically based evaluations of the whole food production chain 'from farm to table', including a description of the most important (risk) factors. Epidemiological studies of outbreaks as well as sporadic cases should be aimed at a better understanding of these factors. In terms of public health importance of the problem, the focus should be on the size of the problem, and the potential for improvement. The indications are that both in developed and developing countries there is significant potential for an improvement of the situation. With this aim in mind, international effort should focus on scientific assessments of the potential for risk reduction under different regional conditions.
TI  - The emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance in food-borne bacteria.
AB  - Since the early 1990s there has been a dramatic increase in resistance to antimicrobial drugs in Salmonella enterica and Campylobacter spp., and to a lesser extent in Vero cytotoxin-producing Escherichia coli O157 from cases of human infection in developed countries. For S. Typhimurium a particularly important aspect of this increase has been the widespread dissemination of a multiply drug-resistant (MR) strain of definitive phage type (DT) 104 in food animals since the early 1990s. The use of antimicrobials for prophylaxis in food producing animals has been an important factor in the emergence of strains with resistance to certain antimicrobials. It is hoped that recently introduced Codes of Practice for the prophylactic use of antimicrobials in food animals will result in a decline in the occurrence of drug resistant strains in the food chain.
TI  - A novel action of the proton pump inhibitor rabeprazole and its thioether derivative against the motility of Helicobacter pylori.
AB  - The motility of Helicobacter pylori was maximum at 37 degrees C and at pH 6. A newly developed proton pump inhibitor, rabeprazole (RPZ), and its thioether derivative (RPZ-TH) markedly inhibited the motility of H. pylori. The concentrations of the drug necessary to inhibit 50% of the motility were 0.25, 16, 16, and >64 microgram/ml for RPZ-TH, RPZ, lansoprazole, and omeprazole, respectively. No such inhibitory effects were observed with H(2) blockers or anti-H. pylori agents. The motilities of Campylobacter jejuni and C. coli-but not those of Vibrio cholerae O1 and O139, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, and Proteus mirabilis-were also inhibited. Prolonged incubation with RPZ or RPZ-TH inhibited bacterial growth of only H. pylori, except for a turbid colony mutant. The results indicate that RPZ and RPZ-TH have a characteristic inhibitory effect against the motility of H. pylori (spiral-shaped bacteria), which is distinguished from that against bacterial growth.
TI  - [Increase of bacterial resistance in human medicine by resistance genes of bacteria from meat supplying animals].
AB  - Two different groups of bacteria carrying genes encoding for resistance to antibiotics may be transmitted from animals to humans via food products: a.) obligate infectious agents (enteric pathogens, e.g. Salmonella enterica spp., Campylobacter spp., EHEC) and b) facultative pathogenic species (e.g. E. coli, enterococci). Thus far, it is unknown whether genes encoding for resistance to antibiotics from these bacteria may be transferred to bacteria in normal flora of the host. The transfers of genes encoding for resistance to vancomycin from animal sources to the mucosa of humans has been suggested. Thus, there is a threat that these plasmid-encoded resistance genes may also be transferred to other gram-positive organisms present in the human flora. Vancomycin is the antibiotic in reserve for treatment of infections caused by oxacillin (methicillin) resistant strains of S. aureus and by strains of pneumococcus resistant to penicillin.
TI  - Inhibition of Salmonella typhimurium in the chicken intestinal tract by a transformed avirulent avian Escherichia coli.
AB  - An avirulent, wild-type avian Escherichia coli (E. coli Av) was electrotransformed with a plasmid coding for the production of microcin 24 (pGOB18) and was designated E. coli AvGOB18. The transformant inhibited the growth of seven serotypes of Salmonella commonly associated with colonization and contamination of poultry products and seven strains of E. coli O157:H7 in the in vitro colicin/microcin assay. The transformant did not inhibit the replication of multiple isolates of Listeria monocytogenes or Campylobacter jejuni in similar assays. The transformant is nonconjugative, indicating that the plasmid would not be transmitted to other intestinal microflora in the environment. The transformant also survived in sterile tap and deionized water incubated at 25 C and 37 C in the laboratory for 30 days and was recovered from drinkers and birds in in vivo floor pen studies. In in vivo studies, E. coli AvGOB18 did not colonize the intestinal tract of broiler chicks when given as a single or multiple dose and did not reduce the Salmonella load in the broilers. But Salmonella typhimurium was reduced significantly in the intestinal tracts of broiler chickens when E. coli AvGOB18 was administered continually in the water supply.

TI  - [Resistance of respiratory and enteral bacteria to antibiotics].
AB  
TI  - Cloning, sequencing, and characterization of the lipopolysaccharide biosynthetic  enzyme heptosyltransferase I gene (waaC) from Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli.
AB  - Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli are common causes of gastrointestinal disease and a proportion of C. jejuni infections have been shown to be associated with the Guillain-Barre syndrome. The waaC gene from Campylobacter coli, involved in lipopolysaccharide core biosynthesis, was cloned by complementation of a heptose-deficient strain of Salmonella typhimurium, as judged by novobiocin sensitivity, lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-specific phage sensitivity, and polyacrylamide-resolved lipopolysaccharide profiles. The C. jejuni waaC gene was subsequently cloned using the waaC gene isolated from C. coli as a probe. The C. jejuni and C. coli waaC genes are capable of encoding proteins of 342 amino acids with calculated molecular masses of 39381Da and 39317Da, respectively. Sequence and in-vitro analyses suggested that the C. coli waaC gene may be transcribed from its own promoter. Translation of the C. coli waaC gene in a cell-free system yielded a protein with a Mr of 39000. The waaC gene was detected in every C. jejuni and C. coli isolate tested as judged by dot-blot hybridization analysis. Southern hybridization analysis indicated that both Campylobacter species contain a single copy of the waaC gene. Unlike Escherichia coli and S. typhimurium isolates, the waaC gene in C. jejuni and C. coli isolates does not appear to be linked to the waaF (rfaF) gene.
TI  - Acid-sensitive enteric pathogens are protected from killing under extremely acidic conditions of pH 2.5 when they are inoculated onto certain solid food sources.
AB  - Gastric acidity is recognized as the first line of defense against food-borne pathogens, and the ability of pathogens to resist this pH corresponds to their oral infective dose (ID). Naturally occurring and genetically engineered acid-sensitive enteric pathogens were examined for their ability to survive under acidic conditions of pH 2.5 for 2 h at 37 degreesC when inoculated onto ground beef. Each of the strains displayed significantly high survival rates under these normally lethal conditions. The acid-sensitive pathogens Campylobacter jejuni and Vibrio cholerae, which were protected at lower levels from acid-induced killing by ground beef under these conditions, were sensitive to killing in acidified media at pH 5.0 but survived at pH 6.0. Salmonella inoculated onto the surface of preacidified ground beef could not survive if the pH on the surface of the beef was 2.61 or lower but was viable if the surface pH was 3. 27. This implies that the pH of the microenvironment occupied by the bacteria on the surface of the food source is critical for their survival. Salmonella was also shown to be protected from killing when inoculated onto boiled egg white, a food source high in protein and low in fat. These results may explain why Salmonella species have a higher oral ID of approximately 10(5) cells when administered under defined conditions but have been observed to cause disease at doses as low as 50 to 100 organisms when consumed as part of a contaminated food source. They may also help explain why some pathogens are associated primarily with food-borne modes of transmission rather than fecal-oral transmission.
TI  - Resistance to antimicrobial agents used for animal therapy in pathogenic-, zoonotic- and indicator bacteria isolated from different food animals in Denmark: a baseline study for the Danish Integrated Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring Programme (DANMAP).
AB  - This study describes the establishment and first results of a continuous surveillance system of antimicrobial resistance among bacteria isolated from pigs, cattle and broilers in Denmark. The three categories of bacteria tested were: 1) indicator bacteria (Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium), 2) zoonotic bacteria (Campylobacter coli/jejuni, Salmonella enterica, Yersinia enterocolitica), and 3) animal pathogens (E. coli, Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), Staphylococcus hyicus, Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae). A total of 3304 bacterial isolates collected from October 1995 through December 1996 were tested for susceptibility to all major classes of antimicrobial agents used for therapy in Denmark. Bacterial species intrinsically resistant to an antimicrobial were not tested towards that antimicrobial. Acquired resistance to all antimicrobials was found. The occurrence of resistance varied by animal origin and bacterial species. In general, resistance was observed more frequently among isolates from pigs than from cattle and broilers. The association between the occurrence of resistance and the consumption of the antimicrobial is discussed, as is the occurrence of resistance in other countries. The results of this study show the present level of resistance to antimicrobial agents among a number of bacterial species isolated from food animals in Denmark. Thus, the baseline for comparison with future prospective studies has been established, enabling the determination of trends over time.
TI  - The survival and growth of acid-adapted mesophilic pathogens that contaminate meat after lactic acid decontamination.
AB  - Lactic acid decontamination (LAD) may adapt pathogens to lactic acid. Such organisms may have an increased resistance to acid and can contaminate meat after LAD. The survival and growth of acid adapted Campylobacter jejuni, Salmonella typhimurium. Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Staphylococcus aureus inoculated on skin surface of still warm pork belly cuts 2 h after LAD was examined during chilled (4 degrees C) storage and refrigeration abuse equivalent to 12.5 degrees C. Lactic acid decontamination included dipping in 1, 2 or 5% lactic acid solutions at 55 degrees C for 120 s. Lactic acid decontamination brought sharp reductions in meat surface pH, but these recovered with time after LAD at approximately 1-1.5 pH units below that of water-treated controls. A sharp decrease in the number of cfu of pathogens occurred on chilled 2-5% lactic acid treated pork belly cuts when the skin surface was less than pH 4.8-5.2. The reductions ranged from 0.1-0.3 log10 cfu cm-2 for E. coli O157:H7 to over 1.7-2.4 log10 cfu cm-2 for Camp. jejuni, respectively. Increase in storage temperature from 4 to 12.5 degrees C reduced delayed decrease in numbers of all pathogens except Camp. jejuni by a factor of two. Deaths in Camp. jejuni at 12.5 degrees C slightly exceeded those at 4 degrees C. After the initial sharp decline, the number of cfu of mesophilic pathogens decreased gradually at a rate similar to that on water-treated controls. Growth of all mesophilic pathogens except Camp. jejuni on 2-5% LAD meat occurred during storage at 12.5 degrees C when the meat surface pH exceeded 4.8-5.2, and was slower than on water-treated controls. Low temperature and acid-adapted E. coli O157:H7, Salm. typhimurium and Staph. aureus, and acid adapted Camp. jejuni that contaminate skin surface after hot 2-5% LAD, did not cause an increased health hazard, although microbiota and intrinsic parameters (lactic acid content, pH) were created that could advantage their survival and growth.
TI  - Antimicrobial properties of plant essential oils and essences against five important food-borne pathogens.
AB  - The antimicrobial properties of 21 plant essential oils and two essences were investigated against five important food-borne pathogens, Campylobacter jejuni, Salmonella enteritidis, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Listeria monocytogenes. The oils of bay, cinnamon, clove and thyme were the most inhibitory, each having a bacteriostatic concentration of 0.075% or less against all five pathogens. In general, Gram-positive bacteria were more sensitive to inhibition by plant essential oils than the Gram-negative bacteria. Campylobacter jejuni was the most resistant of the bacteria investigated to plant essential oils, with only the oils of bay and thyme having a bacteriocidal concentration of less than 1%. At 35 degrees C, L. monocytogenes was extremely sensitive to the oil of nutmeg. A concentration of less than 0.01% was bacteriostatic and 0.05% was bacteriocidal, but when the temperature was reduced to 4 degrees, the bacteriostatic concentration was increased to 0.5% and the bacteriocidal concentration to greater than 1%.
TI  - Host mutations (miaA and rpsL) reduce tetracycline resistance mediated by Tet(O)  and Tet(M).
AB  - The effects of mutations in host genes on tetracycline resistance mediated by the Tet(O) and Tet(M) ribosomal protection proteins, which originated in Campylobacter spp. and Streptococcus spp., respectively, were investigated by using mutants of Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli. The miaA, miaB, and miaAB double mutants of S. typhimurium specify enzymes for tRNA modification at the adenosine at position 37, adjacent to the anticodon in tRNA. In S. typhimurium, this involves biosynthesis of N6-(4-hydroxyisopentenyl)-2-methylthio-adenosine (ms2io6A). The miaA mutation reduced the level of tetracycline resistance mediated by both Tet(O) and Tet(M), but the latter showed a greater effect, which was ascribed to the isopentenyl (i6) group or to a combination of the methylthioadenosine (ms2) and i6 groups but not to the ms2 group alone (specified by miaB). In addition, mutations in E. coli rpsL genes, generating both streptomycin-resistant and streptomycin-dependent strains, were also shown to reduce the level of tetracycline resistance mediated by Tet(O) and Tet(M). The single-site amino acid substitutions present in the rpsL mutations were pleiotropic in their effects on tetracycline MICs. These mutants affect translational accuracy and kinetics and suggest that Tet(O) and Tet(M) binding to the ribosome may be reduced or slowed in the E. coli rpsL mutants in which the S12 protein is altered. Data from both the miaA and rpsL mutant studies indicate a possible link between stability of the aminoacyl-tRNA in the ribosomal acceptor site and tetracycline resistance mediated by the ribosomal protection proteins.
TI  - Cloning and characterization of a Campylobacter jejuni 72Dz/92 gene encoding a 30 kDa immunopositive protein, component of the ABC transport system; expression of the gene in avirulent Salmonella typhimurium.
AB  - Three gene libraries of Campylobacter jejuni 72Dz/92 DNA were prepared using lambda gt11, pSupercos and pWSK129 cloning vectors. Screening of the libraries with Escherichia coli absorbed antiserum generated against whole C. jejuni revealed several immunoreactive clones of apparent molecular masses 19, 28, 30 and 50 kDa. The most commonly isolated clones expressed 30 kDa protein. The nucleotide sequence of the 1768 bp C. jejuni DNA yielded one complete (ORF2) and two partial open reading frames (ORF1 and ORF3). ORF2 encoded CjaA protein exhibits relevant overall homology to several prokaryotic solute binding proteins (family 3), components of the ABC transport system, while the product of the truncated ORF3 (CjaB protein) shows extensive homology to Gram-negative bacterial proteins, members of the sugar transporter family. The genetic organization of the putative cjaAB operon was studied. The cjaA gene fragment (616 bp) was amplified from three C. jejuni strains isolated from patients with acute bloody diarrhea, whereas it was not amplified from strains which caused acute diarrhea with no blood in the stools. The gene was introduced into avirulent Salmonella typhimurium vaccine strain where it is expressed at a reasonably high level.
TI  - Infectious diarrhoea--an update.
AB  - Infectious diarrhoea is one of the most common illness affecting mankind. Recent  advancement have led to detailed understanding of causative agents and the pathogenesis of the infections. Fluid and electrolyte replacement remains the most important aspect of treatment. The role of antimicrobial agents is discussed.
TI  - Identification of a functional homolog of the Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium cysM gene encoding O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase B in Campylobacter jejuni.
AB  - The final step of L-cysteine biosynthesis in Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium consists of the formation of L-cysteine from O-acetylserine and sulfide. This reaction can be catalyzed by two enzymes, O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase A and O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase B, the former of which has been more rigorously characterized. In contrast to O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase A, O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase B is preferentially used for cysteine biosynthesis during anaerobic growth and is able to utilize thiosulfate as a substrate. Campylobacter jejuni is a micro-aerophilic, Gram-negative bacterium, and a member of the epsilon subdivision of eubacteria. We have cloned, sequenced, and expressed a gene from C. jejuni that encodes a protein of 299 aa with a calculated molecular mass of 32,367 Da. Complementation analysis of an E. coli cysteine auxotroph with the pMEK34-14 recombinant plasmid containing a 1.2-kb insert of chromosomal DNA from C. jejuni revealed that transformants were capable of growth in medium containing either sulfide or thiosulfate as sole sulfur sources. These data indicate that the cloned C. jejuni gene is a functional homolog of the cysM gene that codes for O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase B in E. coli and S. typhimurium.
TI  - Direct detection by PCR of Escherichia coli O157 and enteropathogens in patients  with bloody diarrhea.
AB  - Direct detection of Escherichia coli O157 and foodborne pathogens associated with bloody diarrhea were achieved using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) after the preparation of DNA from stool specimens using the microspin technique. PCR was compared with cultivation and toxin production tests with respect to the efficiency of detection of each pathogen; E. coli O157, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Salmonella serovar Enteritidis and Campylobacter jejuni. Detection of some or all of the above pathogens in clinical stool specimens was achieved using PCR. The minimum number of cells required for the detection of the above pathogens by PCR was 10(1) CFUs/0.5 g of stool sample. PCR was completed within 6 hr. The above pathogens were also detected in cultivation and toxin production tests. Partial purification of the template DNA using the microspin technique was essential for the elimination of PCR inhibitors from the DNA samples. This PCR method is an accurate, easy-to-read screening method for the detection of Shiga-like toxin producing E. coli O157 and enteropathogens associated with bloody diarrhea in stool specimens.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance in organisms causing diarrheal disease.
AB  - Antimicrobial resistance is becoming increasingly important in the treatment of enteric infections, particularly those due to Shigella, Vibrio cholerae, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (associated with traveler's diarrhea), and Salmonella typhi. The rate of antimicrobial resistance is highest in the developing world, where the use of antimicrobial drugs is relatively unrestricted. Of greatest immediate concern is the need for an effective, inexpensive antimicrobial that can be used safely as treatment for small children with dysentery due to Shigella, primarily Shigella dysenteriae type 1.
TI  - Risk factors for outbreaks of infectious intestinal disease linked to domestic catering.
AB  - The epidemiology of general outbreaks of infectious intestinal disease associated with domestic catering for large numbers is described and compared with foodborne outbreaks in other settings. From 1 January 1992 to 31 December 1994, the PHLS Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre identified 101 foodborne general outbreaks of infectious intestinal disease associated with domestic catering in England and Wales (16% of all foodborne outbreaks). Salmonella species were associated with 77 of the 101 outbreaks and S. enteriditis phage type 4 accounted for 57. Small round structured viruses were implicated in five outbreaks, Clostridium perfringens in four, Bacillus cereus in two, and Campylobacter sp and Escherichia coli in one each. No pathogen was identified in 11 outbreaks. Outbreaks occurred most commonly in summer. The commonest vehicles implicated were poultry/eggs in 44 outbreaks, desserts in 13, and meat/meat products in nine. Salad/vegetables, sauces, and fish/shellfish were each implicated in eight outbreaks. Raw shell eggs were implicated in a fifth of outbreaks. Inappropriate storage was the commonest fault, reported in association with 50 outbreaks (ambient temperature for long periods before serving in 29), inadequate heat treatment was reported in 35, cross contamination in 28, an infected food handler in 11, and other faults in 14. Outbreaks associated with catering on domestic premises were independently more likely than outbreaks in other settings to be associated with salmonellas, inappropriate storage of food, and consumption of poultry, eggs, or sauces. Public health services need to direct messages about the use, preparation, and storage of food to those who cater on domestic premises.
TI  - Surveillance for waterborne-disease outbreaks--United States, 1993-1994.
AB  - PROBLEM/CONDITION: Since 1971, CDC and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency have maintained a collaborative surveillance system for collecting and periodically reporting data that relate to occurrences and causes of waterborne-disease outbreaks (WBDOs). REPORTING PERIOD COVERED: This summary includes data for January 1993 through December 1994 and for previously unreported outbreaks in 1992. DESCRIPTION OF THE SYSTEM: The surveillance system includes data about outbreaks associated with water intended for drinking (i.e., drinking water) and those associated with recreational water. State, territorial, and local public health departments are primarily responsible for detecting and investigating WBDOs and voluntarily reporting them to CDC on a standard form. RESULTS: For the 2-year period 1993-1994, 17 states and one territory reported a total of 30 outbreaks associated with drinking water. These outbreaks caused an estimated 405,366 persons to become ill, including 403,000 from an outbreak of cryptosporidiosis in Milwaukee, the largest WBDO ever documented in the United States, and 2,366 from the other 29 outbreaks. No etiologic agent was identified for five (16.7%) of the 30 outbreaks. The protozoan parasites Giardia lamblia and Cryptosporidium parvum caused 10 (40.0%) of the 25 outbreaks for which the etiologic agent was identified. Two outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis occurred in large metropolitan areas (i.e., Milwaukee and Las Vegas/Clark County) and were associated with deaths among immunocompromised persons. The waterborne nature of these two outbreaks was not recognized until at least 2 weeks after the onset of the Milwaukee outbreak and until after the end of the Las Vegas outbreak. Campylobacter jejuni was implicated for three outbreaks and the following pathogens for one outbreak each: Shigella sonnei, Shigella flexneri, non-O1 Vibrio cholerae (in a U.S. territory; the vehicle was commercially bottled water), and Salmonella serotype Typhimurium (the outbreak was associated with seven deaths). Eight outbreaks of chemical poisoning were reported: three were caused by lead (one case each), two by fluoride, two by nitrate and one by copper. Twenty (66.7%) of the 30 outbreaks were associated with a well-water source. Fourteen states reported a total of 26 outbreaks associated with recreational water, in which an estimated 1,714 persons became ill. Fourteen (53.8%) of these 26 were outbreaks of gastroenteritis. The etiologic agent in each of these 14 outbreaks was identified; 10 (71.4%) were caused by G. lamblia or C. parvum. Six of these 10 were associated with chlorinated, filtered pool water, and three with lake water. One of the latter was the first reported outbreak of cryptosporidiosis associated with the recreational use of lake water. Four outbreaks of lake water-associated bacterial gastroenteritis were reported, two caused by S. sonnei, one by S. flexneri, and one by Escherichia coli O157:H7. Nine outbreaks of hot tub- whirlpool-, or swimming pool-associated pseudomonas dermatitis were reported. Two outbreaks of swimming pool-associated dermatitis had a suspected chemical etiology. The child who had the one reported case of primary amebic meningoencephalitis, caused by infection with Naegleria fowleri, died. INTERPRETATION: The number of WBDOs reported annually has been similar for each year during 1987-1994, except for an increase in 1992. Protozoan parasites, especially C. parvum and G. lamblia, remain important etiologic agents of WBDOs. The outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis in Milwaukee and Las Vegas demonstrate that WBDOs can occur in large metropolitan areas. Surveillance methods are needed that expedite the detection of WBDOs and the institution of preventive measures (e.g., boil-water advisories). ACTIONS TAKEN: Surveillance data that identify the types of water systems, their deficiencies, and the etiologic agents associated with outbreaks are used to evaluate the adequacy of current technologies for prov
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of chicken and turkey heterophil peptides CHP1, CHP2, THP1, and THP3.
AB  - Four avian heterophil antimicrobial cationic peptides (Chicken Heterophil Peptides 1 and 2, and Turkey Heterophil Peptides 1 and 3) were evaluated for in vitro microbicidal activity against selected avian pathogens and human pathogens which are harbored by birds. At concentrations of 16-2 micrograms/ml, all four avian peptides effected a greater than 90% reduction in the survival of Candida albicans, Salmonella enteriditis, and Campylobacter jejuni. None of the peptides, including the known antimicrobial peptide protamine (used as a positive control), were able to reduce the survival of Pasteurella multocida by 90% at the maximum peptide concentration (16 micrograms/ml) tested. At 16 micrograms/ml, the turkey peptide THP3 did not effect a 90% reduction in survival of Bordetella avium, Escherichia coli, or Salmonella typhimurium, while all of the other peptides tested were effective at this concentration or less. This peptide, THP3, does not share the same homologous amino acid sequence shared by the other three peptides. Under our experimental conditions, none of the peptides neutralized Infectious Bronchitis Virus, an enveloped coronavirus of chickens.
TI  - Metabolic activity of pathogenic bacteria during semicontinuous anaerobic digestion.
AB  - In natural environments such as anaerobic digesters, bacteria are frequently subjected to the stress of nutrient fluxes because of the continual changes in the flow of nutrients, and to survive, they must be capable of adapting readily to nutrient changes. In this study, the metabolic activities of Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Yersinia enterocolitica, Listeria monocytogenes, and Campylobacter jejuni were studied within culture bags (Versapor-200 filters, 0.22-microns pore size) in laboratory anaerobic digesters. The metabolic activity of these bacteria was indicated by their adenylate energy charge (EC) ratios and their ability to incorporate [3H]thymidine, which was related to the respective changes in viable numbers within the culture bags during anaerobic digestion. Fluctuations in the adenylate EC ratios, the uptake of [3H]thymidine, and the viable numbers of E. coli, S. typhimurium, Y. enterocolitica, and L. monocytogenes cells were probably due to constant changes in the amount of available nutrients within the anaerobic digesters. The viability of S. typhimurium increased quickly after a fresh supply of nutrients was added to the system as indicated by the uptake of [3H]thymidine and an increase in the adenylate EC ratios. The viable numbers of E. coli, S. typhimurium, Y. enterocolitica, and L. monocytogenes organisms declined rapidly from 10(7) to 10(8) CFU/ml to 10(3) to 10(4) CFU/ml and remained at this level for an indefinite period. The decimal reduction time calculated during the period of exponential decline ranged from 0.8 to 1.2 days for these bacteria. C. jejuni had the greatest mean decimal reduction time value (3.6 days).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Effect of trisodium phosphate on biofilm and planktonic cells of Campylobacter jejuni, Escherichia coli O157: H7, Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella typhimurium.
AB  - Trisodium phosphate (TSP) has been approved by the United States Department of Agriculture as a post-chill antimicrobial treatment for raw poultry. This study examines the effectiveness of TSP against planktonic (suspended) and biofilm (attached) cells of Campylobacter jejuni, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella typhimurium at room temperature (RT) and 10 degrees C. At either temperature E. coli O157:H7 was the most sensitive to TSP treatments; 10(6) cfu/ml of planktonic or 10(5) cfu/cm2 of biofilm cells were eliminated by a 30 s treatment with 1% TSP. Campylobacter jejuni was slightly less sensitive. Listeria monocytogenes was the most resistant to the effect of TSP, requiring exposure to 8% TSP for 10 min (RT) or 20 min (10 degrees C) to reduce biofilm bacteria by at least one log. Biofilm cells of S. typhimurium and Listeria monocytogenes were more resistant than planktonic cells. Salmonella typhimurium was more sensitive to treatments using TSP at 10 degrees C than at RT. In contrast, L. monocytogenes was more resistant to TSP at 10 degrees C. Trisodium phosphate appears to be an effective treatment for reducing populations of C. jejuni, E. coli O157:H7 and S. typhimurium. This product has the potential to be used for reduction of bacterial counts on other food products besides raw poultry or on food and non-food contact surfaces.
TI  - Short-term treatment of traveler's diarrhea with norfloxacin: a double-blind, placebo-controlled study during two seasons.
AB  - Clinical efficacy of norfloxacin for treatment of traveler's diarrhea in 106 Finnish tourists vacationing in Morocco was evaluated during two different seasons. When the criteria for diagnosis of traveler's diarrhea were fulfilled, norfloxacin (400 mg) or a placebo was given orally, twice daily for 3 days. All symptoms and signs subsided sooner in the norfloxacin group. The clearest difference was observed in the duration of diarrhea: 1.2 days in the norfloxacin group vs. 3.3 days in the placebo group (P < .001). The duration of diarrhea due to particular species was as follows for the two groups: in cases due to Salmonella enterica, 1.1 vs 4.1 days (P < .01); in cases due to Campylobacter jejuni, 1.8 vs. 5.0 days (P < .01); and in cases due to enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, 1.0 day vs. 3.1 days (P < .01). The rate of full recovery during administration of norfloxacin or a placebo was also greater among the norfloxacin recipients: 84% vs. 47% (P < .001). No significant adverse effects were reported. Norfloxacin proved to be safe and effective in therapy for traveler's diarrhea.
TI  - Survival of pathogenic bacteria during mesophilic anaerobic digestion of animal waste.
AB  - The survival of pathogenic bacteria was investigated during the operation of a full-scale anaerobic digester which was fed daily and operated at 28 degrees C. The digester had a mean hydraulic retention time of 24 d. The viable numbers of Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Yersinia enterocolitica, Listeria monocytogenes and Campylobacter jejuni were reduced during mesophilic anaerobic digestion. Escherichia coli had the smallest mean viable numbers at each stage of the digestion process. Its mean T90 value was 76.9 d. Yersinia enterocolitica was the least resistant to the anaerobic digester environment; its mean T90 value was 18.2 d. Campylobacter jejuni was the most resistant bacterium; its mean T90 value was 438.6 d. Regression analysis showed that there were no direct relationships between the slurry input and performance of the digester and the decline of pathogen numbers during the 140 d experimental period.
TI  - Early diagnosis of typhoid fever by an enzyme immunoassay using Salmonella typhi  outer membrane protein preparations.
AB  - An enzyme immunoassay (EIA) for detection of serum antibodies in patients with typhoid fever was developed using Salmonella typhi outer membrane protein (OMP) preparations as antigen. Acute phase (first week) sera from adult typhoid fever patients were tested as well as sera from the following control groups: adult travellers with diarrhea caused by enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, children infected with Campylobacter jejuni, healthy Mexican adult blood donors, and adults with septicemia caused by other organisms. At a 1:3,125 serum dilution, the mean absorbance values were 1.41 in the typhoid fever patients, and 0.57, 0.55, 0.51 and 0.52 in the respective control groups. Inhibition EIA studies using OMP preparations or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) as free antigen indicated that proteins can play an important role in the detection of antibodies in early typhoid fever. This EIA may be useful for the diagnosis of typhoid fever since results were obtained within about five hours and in an endemic area antibodies against Salmonella typhi OMP preparations appear early in the course of the disease.
TI  - [Prevalence of enteropathogenic bacteria in children with acute bloody diarrhea].
AB  - Between January to October 1991, were studied 148 samples of feces corresponding  to the same number of children with acute diarrhea. In 41 (27.7%) samples, were found macroscopic or microscopic blood. At least one associated bacterial pathogen capable to produce bloody diarrhea was isolated from 22 (53.7%) of these samples. Were isolated five (12.2%) Salmonella strains, all of them were S. enteritidis; nine (22.0%) Shigella: seven S. flexneri, one S. boydii, and other one S. sonnei; two (4.9%) enteroinvasive Escherichia coli strains, and six (14.6%) Campylobacter jejuni strains. A single associated invasive bacterial pathogen was isolated in 13 (31.7%) children. Mixed culture were found in nine children: five (12.2%) children had invasive pathogens association, and four (9.8%) children had invasive and no invasive pathogens association.
TI  - The effect of slurry storage and anaerobic digestion on survival of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - The decline in viable numbers of Salmonella typhimurium, Yersinia enterocolitica  and Listeria monocytogene in beef cattle slurry is temperature-dependent; they decline more rapidly at 17 degrees C than at 4 degrees C. Mesophilic anaerobic digestion caused an initial rapid decline in the viable numbers of Escherichia coli, Salm. typhimurium, Y. enterocolitica and L. monocytogenes. This was followed by a period in which the viable numbers were not reduced by 90%. The T90 values of E. coli, Salm. typhimurium and Y. enterocolitica ranged from 0.7 to 0.9 d during batch digestion and 1.1 to 2.5 d during semi-continuous digestion. Listeria monocytogenes had a significantly higher mean T90 value during semi-continuous digestion (35.7 d) than batch digestion (12.3 d). Anaerobic digestion had little effect in reducing the viable numbers of Campylobacter jejuni.
TI  - Seasonal variation in etiology of travelers' diarrhea. Finnish-Moroccan Study Group.
AB  - The etiology of travelers' diarrhea was studied in 579 adult Finnish tourists participating in two packaged tours to Morocco in the winter (n = 233) and fall (n = 346) of 1989. A research team accompanied the travelers, and a laboratory for enteric pathogens was established in Agadir. At least one pathogen was found in 62% of the 60 diarrhea cases in winter and in 58% of the 111 diarrhea cases in fall. Multiple pathogens were found less often in winter (8%) than in fall (21%, P less than .05). Campylobacter strains were the leading cause of travelers' diarrhea in winter, found alone or with other pathogens in 28% of the cases (but in only 7% in fall), whereas enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) was the most common pathogen in fall, present in 32% of the cases (8% in winter). Both differences are highly significant (P less than .001). Salmonella enterica was almost as common as ETEC in fall (25% of diarrhea cases) but rare in winter (10%, P less than .05). Thus, the etiology of travelers' diarrhea varied according to the season in the same tourist destination. This finding has relevance to both antimicrobial treatment and prophylaxis.
TI  - Enteropathogens associated with acute diarrheal disease in urban infants in Sao Paulo, Brazil.
AB  - To determine the prevalence and epidemiology of enteropathogens in acute infantile diarrhea, 500 infants less than or equal to 12 months of age with diarrhea and 500 age-matched control subjects coming to a Sao Paulo emergency room were studied. Enteropathogens were identified in 55% of case infants and 10% of controls; enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) of classic EPEC serotypes producing EPEC adherence factor (EAF) (26% of case infants), rotavirus (14%), Salmonella species (8%), enterotoxigenic E. coli (7%), and Shigella species (5%) were associated with diarrhea. Isolation of EAF+ classic EPEC decreased with increasing age of cases and peaked in spring, whereas rotavirus was least common in early infancy and peaked in fall and winter. Bloody stool had a 36% positive predictive value for Shigella infection, EAF+ classic EPEC were highly resistant to antimicrobial drugs. Among poor Sao Paulo infants, EAF+ classic EPEC equaled or exceeded rotavirus throughout the year as a cause of diarrhea bringing children to medical attention.
TI  - The use of plasmid profiles and nucleic acid probes in epidemiologic investigations of foodborne, diarrheal diseases.
AB  - The application of nucleic acid analyses to investigations of infectious disease  outbreaks has resulted in useful molecular strain markers that distinguish the epidemic clone of a particular pathogen and help identify specific vehicles of infection. We have successfully used plasmid profile analysis, restriction endonuclease digestion of plasmid and whole-cell DNAs, and nucleic acid hybridization to investigate recent outbreaks of foodborne diarrheal illness. Plasmid analysis has been important in identifying epidemic strains of Salmonella enteritidis and Escherichia coli O157:H7. In a culture survey of S. enteritidis isolates from humans and a variety of animals, including chickens and chicken eggs, we identified 16 distinct plasmid profiles and used these to differentiate strains, especially within commonly occurring phage types (Colindale 8 and 13a). HindIII digests of plasmid DNA were useful in distinguishing plasmids of similar mass but dissimilar enzyme target sequences; they clearly distinguished S. enteritidis strains causing systemic infections in children in parts of Africa from U.S. isolates. Investigations of outbreaks of hemorrhagic colitis have also been assisted by plasmid analysis. Restriction endonuclease digests of whole-cell DNA and Southern blot analysis, hybridizing with E. coli 16S and 23S rRNA (ribotyping), have been effective subtyping techniques, especially for plasmidless isolates of Campylobacter jejuni. In five outbreaks of C. jejuni infections, ribotyping of PvuII and ClaI digests distinguished individual epidemic strains within one commonly occurring C. jejuni serotype (Penner 2, Lior 4). Preliminary data show that ribotyping of NcoI digests can also distinguish individual epidemic strains of E. coli O157:H7 and may provide a more stable marker than plasmid profiles. Specific DNA probes derived from cloned virulence genes of E. coli have been invaluable in epidemic investigations and surveys. Using colony hybridization, we found in one survey of stool specimens from 174 dairy cattle that 11% of animals were asymptomatically carrying Shiga-like toxigenic E. coli other than O157:H7. We also found that newly synthesized oligonucleotide probes for the Shiga-like toxins I and II agreed 100% with cloned gene probes in a study of 613 E. coli strains. Future studies of these organisms will include the use of additional synthetic oligonucleotides as primers to amplify the toxin genes directly in patient and animal specimens by the polymerase chain reaction. There is a continuing and expanding role for molecular approaches in epidemiological investigations. The DNA methods described above are not based on the often complex expression of phenotypic characteristics, and, unlike sensitive and specific techniques such as phage typing, a single method can be used to study a variety of Gram-positive and negative bacterial pathogens.
TI  - Treatment of typhoid fever and infectious diarrhoea with ciprofloxacin.
AB  - Ciprofloxacin and other related fluorinated 4-quinolones have microbiological and pharmacokinetic properties that suggest they could be useful agents in the management of typhoid fever and bacterial gastroenteritis. Initial studies confirm that this is the case. Against fully sensitive Salmonella typhi ciprofloxacin is clinically as effective as chloramphenicol or co-trimoxazole. It is also effective treatment for antibiotic-resistant strains which cause epidemic and endemic infection throughout the world. Furthermore, ciprofloxacin appears to eliminate chronic carriage of Salm. typhi more efficiently than other antibiotics. Ciprofloxacin has excellent in-vitro activity against all the bacterial pathogens that commonly cause infective diarrhoea. There are limited data concerning its use in the treatment of shigella dysentery but, in appropriate situations, ciprofloxacin is effective treatment for salmonella enteritis and is also effective in infections complicated by septicaemia and bone and liver abscesses. Ciprofloxacin appears to be of benefit in Campylobacter jejuni enteritis and is effective in the treatment of travellers' diarrhoea were enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli and shigellae are most important.
TI  - Structural and functional analysis of two Campylobacter jejuni flagellin genes.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to characterize the flagellin gene of Campylobacter jejuni and to study the structure of this protein and the regulation of its synthesis. A part of the flagellin gene of C. jejuni strain 81116 was recently cloned by us. This DNA fragment was used as a probe to isolate the other homologous flagellin sequences from genomic libraries. The flagellin nucleotide sequence was determined from overlapping clones. Two copies of the flagellin gene were identified: genes fla A and fla B consisted of 1731 base pairs each, occurred as tandem repeats, and were 95% identical. Only mRNA that was transcribed from gene A was detected in flagellate cells. sigma 28-specific promoter sequences were found upstream of the transcription initiation site. Analysis of the flagellin protein sequence showed that the amino-terminal and the carboxyl-terminal regions were highly similar to other bacterial flagellins. The conserved regions can form alpha-helices with a nonpolar backbone at one side. We suggest that because these domains were conserved (i) they may be involved in polymerization or transport of flagellins or both, and (ii) they are important for maturation and stability of the flagellum.
TI  - [Sensitivity of enteropathogenic bacteria to furazolidone].
AB  - The sensitivity in vitro of 348 strains of 18 enteropathogen agents to furazolidone was investigated during the period of 1987-1989. All strains of Shigella sonnei (17), S. flexneri (17), S. boydii (16), Escherichia coli enteropathogen (40), E. coli enteroinvasive (20), Campylobacter jejuni (50), Vibrio cholerae 01 (5), Vibrio cholerae non 01 (5), V. parahaemolyticus (5), V. alginolyticus (2), Aeromonas hydrophila (5), A. caviae (5), A. sobria (5), and Plesiomonas shigelloides (12) were sensitive (MIC < or = 8 mg/l), except a strains of E. coli enteropathogen (MIC 16 mg/l). The 15.5% of the 51 strains of Salmonella enterica belonging to the type I isolated between 1987 and 1989 were resistant (MIC > or = 16 mg/l). A similar degree of resistance was observed in 20 strains of this agent isolated between 1978 and 1980. The 30 strains of Yersinia (including 15 strains of Y. enterocolitica 03) presented extreme values of MICs of 8 and 16 mg/l.
TI  - Production of specific monoclonal antibodies to Salmonella typhi flagellin and possible application to immunodiagnosis of typhoid fever.
AB  - Four murine monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to Salmonella typhi flagellin were produced. These MAbs did not react with eight other enterobacterial strains tested: Salmonella enteritidis, Salmonella typhimurium, Salmonella paratyphi A, Escherichia coli, Shigella flexneri, Shigella sonnei, Yersinia enterocolitica, and Campylobacter jejuni. All four MAbs cross-reacted with Salmonella muenchen flagellin indicating specificity for d antigenic flagellar epitope. One MAb (C4) was selected to develop a double antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to detect S. typhi flagellin in serum samples. By use of this assay S. typhi flagellar antigen was detected in 95.5% of serum samples from patients with positive hemoculture for S. typhi, in 93.6% of samples from patients with positive serodiagnosis of typhoid fever, in 26% of samples collected from patients who were initially hemoculture-positive for S. typhi and who had undergone 7-8 d of chemotherapy, in 8.5% of samples from healthy persons from an endemic area, and in no samples from healthy persons from a nonendemic area. The presence of high levels of flagellin antibody titers did not interfere with the antigen detection. The detection of S. typhi flagellar antigen in patient serum may have practical value for rapid diagnosis of typhoid fever.
TI  - Binding and killing of bacteria by bismuth subsalicylate.
AB  - Bismuth subsalicylate (BSS) is a compound without significant aqueous solubility  that is widely used for the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders. BSS was able to bind bacteria of diverse species, and these bound bacteria were subsequently killed. A 4-log10 reduction of viable bacteria occurred within 4 h after a 10 mM aqueous suspension of BSS was inoculated with 2 x 10(6) Escherichia coli cells per ml. Binding and killing were dependent on the levels of inoculated bacteria, and significant binding but little killing of the exposed bacteria occurred at an inoculum level of 2 x 10(9) E. coli per ml. Intracellular ATP decreased rapidly after exposure of E. coli to 10 mM BSS and, after 30 min, was only 1% of the original level. Extracellular ATP increased after exposure to BSS, but the accumulation of extracellular ATP was not sufficient to account for the loss of intracellular ATP. The killing of bacteria exposed to BSS may have been due to cessation of ATP synthesis or a loss of membrane integrity. Bactericidal activity of BSS was also investigated in a simulated gastric juice at pH 3. Killing of E. coli at this pH was much more rapid than at pH 7 and was apparently due to salicylate released by the conversion of BSS to bismuth oxychloride. It is proposed that the binding and killing observed for BSS contribute to the efficacy of this compound against gastrointestinal infections such as traveler's diarrhea.
TI  - Motility of Campylobacter jejuni in a viscous environment: comparison with conventional rod-shaped bacteria.
AB  - The motility of four strains of Campylobacter jejuni in solutions of varying viscosity was measured and compared to that of a number of conventional rod-shaped bacteria (CRSB). All the bacteria tested showed an initial increase in velocity in the low viscosity solutions--between 1 and 3 centipoise (1 P = 0.1 Pa s). However, only the campylobacters were actively motile in highly viscous solutions with velocities ranging from 60 to 100 micron s-1. All strains of C. jejuni tested showed three separate peaks of motility as the viscosity of the solution was increased. A higher proportion of C. jejuni cells exhibited longer path lengths when the viscosity of the surrounding medium was increased from 1.4 to 57 cP. The findings of the study suggest that C. jejuni has a motility suited to movement in a viscous environment, and that this ability might provide the organism with an ecological advantage when in intestinal mucus. It is proposed that the mechanism of motility changes depending on the viscosity of the supporting environment.
TI  - In vitro activity of azithromycin (CP-62,993), a novel macrolide, against enteric pathogens.
AB  - Azithromycin (CP-62,993 [9-deoxy-9A-methyl-9A-aza-9A-homoerythromycin]) is a novel macrolide antimicrobial. In this study the in vitro activity of CP-62,993 has been determined against selected enteropathogens, including Clostridium difficile, and compared with that of erythromycin. MICs were determined using an agar incorporation technique in Mueller-Hinton medium, containing saponin-lysed horse blood at a final concentration of 10% v/v, with an inoculum of 10(4) cfu. CP-62,993 was considerably more active than erythromycin against Salmonella typhi (MIC90 4 and greater than 32 mg/l, respectively), S. enteritidis (MIC90 4 and greater than 32 mg/l), Shigella flexneri (MIC90 2 and 32 mg/l), Sh. dysenteriae (MIC90 2 and 32 mg/l), Sh. sonnei (MIC90 4 and 32 mg/l), Campylobacter jejuni (MIC90 0.12 and 1 mg/l), Vibrio cholerae (MIC90 0.25 and 8 mg/l), V. parahaemolyticus (MIC90 0.5 and 8 mg/l), Yersinia enterocolitica (MIC90 4 and greater than 32 mg/l), Escherichia coli-ETEC (MIC90 4 and 32 mg/l), E. coli-EIEC (MIC90 4 and greater than 32 mg/l), Plesiomonas shigelloides (MIC90 1 and 8 mg/l) and Aeromonas hydrophila (MIC90 4 and 32 mg/l). CP-62,993 (MIC90 2 mg/l) was slightly less active than erythromycin (MIC90 1 mg/l) against isolates of C. difficile. The results suggest a potential clinical role for CP-62,993 in the treatment of enteric infections where antimicrobial therapy is indicated.
TI  - Expression of Campylobacter jejuni invasiveness in cell cultures coinfected with  other bacteria.
AB  - Enteroinvasive Salmonella, Shigella, and Escherichia coli strains were found to exert an effect which rendered Campylobacter jejuni capable of intracellular localization in epithelial cells in vitro. When monolayers of HEp-2 or A-549 cells were challenged with pure cultures of C. jejuni or Campylobacter coli, none of the eight strains tested invaded the cells. In contrast, four of these strains were able to localize intracellularly when the cells were challenged with a mixture of campylobacters and enteroinvasive Salmonella typhimurium, Shigella flexneri, Shigella boydii, Shigella sonnei, or E. coli strains. Invasiveness of campylobacters was also induced by one nonenteroinvasive strain of E. coli O124. Coinfection with other nonenteroinvasive E. coli strains did not induce invasiveness in C. jejuni. The degree of internalization induced by S. typhimurium was significantly higher than that induced by Shigella or E. coli strains. The invasive capacity of C. jejuni was found to differ considerably between strains. No evidence of an invasive potential was demonstrable for two C. coli strains or for two enterotoxigenic isolates of C. jejuni examined. C. jejuni was only able to localize intracellularly in cell cultures when the interaction occurred in a microaerobic atmosphere. None of the strains tested evoked keratoconjunctivitis in guinea pig eyes (Sereny test), regardless of the presence of coinfectants. The results indicate that a synergistic interaction that exists between C. jejuni and other enteropathogens facilitates invasion by C. jejuni.
TI  - [Rotavirus infection in the older child and adult].
AB  - Rotaviruses were detected in 1.3% of more than 10,000 stool samples from children--older than 6 years--and adults. Beside rotaviruses the main enteropathogenic agents found were salmonellae (6.3%) and Campylobacter jejuni/coli (1.7%). Similar as the rotavirus infection of infants, in adults symptoms and signs were nearly the same except that the disease was not so severe. A correlation of the rotavirus infection with certain behaviour or eating habits was not found.
TI  - The comparative activity of pefloxacin, enoxacin, ciprofloxacin and 13 other antimicrobial agents against enteropathogenic microorganisms.
AB  - In this study, we compared the activity of pefloxacin, enoxacin and ciprofloxacin against 269 enteropathogenic strains (Campylobacter jejuni, enteropathogenic Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi, Shigella spp., Vibrio cholerae and Yersinia enterocolitica) with that of rosoxacin, flumequin, nifuroxazide, erythromycin, chloramphenicol, ampicillin, cefotaxime, tetracycline, amikacin, netilmicin, sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim and co-trimoxazole. Pefloxacin, enoxacin and ciprofloxacin were always among the most active compounds. Furthermore, resistant strains or strains with elevated MIC values were not found. The MIC90 value for these three compounds was less than or equal to 0.25 mg/l, except for C. jejuni where it was 0.3 mg/l and 1.4 mg/l for pefloxacin and enoxacin, respectively.
TI  - Bacterial toxins and diarrhoea.
AB  - Bacteria and their toxins are responsible for an enormous burden of diarrhoeal disease. Knowledge about the toxins and their mechanisms of action is limited. Thus, although considerable information is available about the mechanism of action of cholera toxin and a small number of heat-stable enterotoxins, information on the role and action of many others is incomplete. The demonstration of a toxic effect in a test system does not necessarily imply that that activity is relevant to the pathogenesis of the diarrhoea. On the other hand, the absence of a toxic effect in experimental systems does not eliminate the possibility that a toxin is responsible for a particular organism's clinical effects. This is a field of active research and much more work is clearly required.
TI  - In vitro blastogenic response and immunoglobulin synthesis in murine spleen cells stimulated with lipopolysaccharides from Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli.
AB  - Lipopolysaccharides isolated from strains of Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli were mitogenic for spleen cells as measured by 3H-thymidine incorporation. The incorporation was dose dependent with an increase with increased concentration of LPS. Addition of LPS beyond 500 micrograms/ml gave inhibition of incorporation. Stimulation of the spleen cells for 3 days with LPS led to a polyclonal activation of immunoglobulin synthesis. The amount of immunoglobulins synthesised showed a maximum between the 9th and 11th day of incubation, and another maximum between the 15th and 17th day. The immunoglobulins produced were IgM antibodies. Specific antibodies against the LPS used for the stimulation were not detected.
TI  - Antibiotic sensitivity of enteropathogenic bacteria isolated from patients in a Sharjah hospital.
AB  - In recent years widespread circulation of salmonella and shigella strains resistant to multiple antibiotics has become an international problem. Accordingly the bacterial sensitivity to a range of antibiotics has been assessed in vitro and recorded for the period 1979-83 for patients from the Al Qassimi Hospital. A total of 229 enteric pathogens from 148 children and 59 adult patients were isolated and studied. Most of the enterobacteria were sensitive to colistin, gentamicin, trimethoprim and chloramphenicol (Salmonella typhi approached 100% sensitivity). High rates of sensitivity were also found to ampicillin in S. typhi (96%) and other salmonella serotypes (85%), whilst only 57% of Shigella species and 14% of Escherichia coli were sensitive to this antibiotic. Low rates of sensitivity to sulphamethoxazole, streptomycin and tetracycline were found in shigella and E. coli (ranging from 7 to 14%). Approximately 50% of S. typhi and other salmonella serotypes were sensitive to sulphamethoxazole and streptomycin and 80% to tetracycline. Resistance to three or more antibiotics was very common in shigella and enteropathogenic strains of E. coli (74-85%), less common in non-typhoid salmonella (29%) and exceptional in S. typhi strains. In general, shigella and E. coli isolates showed a high rate of resistance to several antibiotics, whilst S. typhi and other salmonella serotypes retained their original sensitivity to most of the antibiotics used in clinical practice.
TI  - Seroepidemiological studies with Campylobacter fetus.
AB  - 324 sera from unselected male and 581 sera from female patients as well as 268 sera from prostitutes were studied for antibodies against Campylobacter fetus using the complement fixation test. Antigen was Campylobacter fetus subspecies intestinalis. 3.9% of the sera showed low but relevant antibody titers. Statistically significant differences don't exist between the three population investigated. Serological cross reactions could not be observed using Salmonella typhimurium, Shigella flexneri, Escherichia coli O119 and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Antigenic relationship however was observed with the subspecies jejuni and fetus.
TI  - [Microbial infections of the small and large intestine].
AB  
TI  - In-vitro effect of edta-tris-lysozyme solutions on selected pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - The in-vitro effect of EDTA-Tris-lysozyme solution on 16 pathogenic bacteria of medical or veterinary importance was determined. Marked decreases in bacterial count occurred with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Moraxella osloensis and Campylobacter fetus, and smaller decreses with Salmonella typhimurium, Shigella boydii, Aeromonas hydrophila, proteus mirabilis, Listeria monocytogenes and Erysipelothrix insidiosa. The test solution had no effect on Klebsiella ozaenae, Brucella canis, Cornynebacterium pyogenes, Coryne, renale, Streptococcus equi and staphylococcus aureus.
