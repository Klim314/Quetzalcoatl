TI  == microbial dynamics during conversion from supragingival to subgingival biofilms in an in vitro model.
AB  == the development of dental caries and periodontal diseases result from distinct shifts in the microbiota of the tooth-associated biofilm. this in vitro study aimed to investigate changes in biofilm composition and structure, during the shift from a "supragingival" aerobic to a "subgingival" anaerobic profile. biofilms consisting of actinomyces oris, candida albicans, fusobacterium nucleatum, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mutans and veillonella dispar were aerobically grown in saliva-containing medium on hydroxyapatite discs. after 64 h, campylobacter rectus, prevotella intermedia and streptococcus anginosus were further added along with human serum, while culture conditions were shifted to microaerophilic. after 96 h, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola were finally added and the biofilm was grown anaerobically for another 64 h. at the end of each phase, biofilms were harvested for species-specific quantification and localization. apart from c. albicans, all other species gradually increased during aerobic and microaerophilic conditions,  but remained steady during anaerobic conditions. biofilm thickness was doubled during the microaerophilic phase, but remained steady throughout the anaerobic phase. extracellular polysaccharide presence was gradually reduced throughout the growth period. biofilm viability was reduced during the microaerophilic conversion, but was recovered during the anaerobic phase. this in vitro study has characterized the dynamic structural shifts occurring in an oral biofilm model during the switch from aerobic to anaerobic conditions, potentially modeling the  conversion of supragingival to subgingival biofilms. within the limitations of this experimental model, the findings may provide novel insights into the ecology of oral biofilms. this article is protected by copyright. all rights reserved.

TI  == periimplant bacteria associated with different transmucosal designs or smoking habits.
AB  == purpose: this study is to compare periimplant microbiota associated with implant  transmucosal designs or smoking habits. methods: submucosal samples from healthy  52 implants were collected for analysis of bacteria associated with bone-level (n = 37) or tissue-level (n = 15) implants or smoking habits, using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. profiles of periimplant bacteria of smokers (n = 5) were investigated using phylochip array version g3 and compared with nonsmokers (n = 5). results: the number of bone-level implants positive for at least 1 pathogen was higher than that of tissue level; however, differences in each bacterium were insignificant. the prevalence and abundance of treponema denticola in smokers were significantly higher than that in nonsmokers (p < 0.05). smokers  and nonsmokers exhibited similar periimplant microbiota based on the phylochip array, but they could be distinguished by limiting observations to only 18 operational taxonomic units. streptococcus macedonicus within firmicutes and prevotella within bacteroidetes were more abundant in smokers compared with nonsmokers. conclusion: prevalence of putative pathogens with bone-level implants was higher than tissue-level implants in nonsmokers. firmicutes and bacteroidetes were significantly higher in smokers. smoking therefore strongly influenced peri-implant bacterial composition of bone-level implant.

TI  == effects of adjunctive daily phototherapy on chronic periodontitis: a randomized single-blind controlled trial.
AB  == purpose: the purpose of this randomized single-blind controlled trial was to elucidate the clinical and antimicrobial effects of daily phototherapy (pt) as an adjunct to scaling and root planing (srp) in patients with chronic periodontitis. methods: the study was conducted from december 2013 to may 2014 at ewha womans university mokdong hospital, seoul, korea. forty-one patients with mild to moderate chronic periodontitis were randomly divided into two therapeutic groups  in a 1:1 ratio: srp+pt and srp (control) groups. all participants underwent full-mouth srp. pt was performed thrice a day for a month by using electric toothbrushes with embedded light-emitting diodes. plaque index, gingival index, probing pocket depth (ppd), clinical attachment level (cal), and bleeding on probing were assessed before (baseline) and four weeks after (follow-up) the treatment. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, parvimonas micra, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, streptococcus mutans, and streptococcus sobrinus levels were detected by a real-time polymerase chain reaction at the same points in time. results: the clinical parameters improved in both the groups. at the follow-up assessment, ppd was significantly decreased in the srp+pt group (p=0.00). further, ppd and cal showed significantly greater changes in the srp+pt group than in the srp group (ppd, p=0.03; cal, p=0.04). p. gingivalis and t. forsythia levels decreased in this group, but no significant intergroup differences were noted. conclusions: adjunctive pt seems to have clinical benefits, but evidence of its antimicrobial  effects is not sufficient. long-term studies are necessary to develop the most effective pt protocol and compare the effectiveness of pt with and without exogenous photosensitizers.

TI  == comparison of bacterial culture and 16s rrna community profiling by clonal analysis and pyrosequencing for the characterization of the dentine caries-associated microbiome.
AB  == culture-independent analyses have greatly expanded knowledge regarding the composition of complex bacterial communities including those associated with oral diseases. a consistent finding from such studies, however, has been the under-reporting of members of the phylum actinobacteria. in this study, five pairs of broad range primers targeting 16s rrna genes were used in clonal analysis of 6 samples collected from tooth lesions involving dentine in subjects  with active caries. samples were also subjected to cultural analysis and pyrosequencing by means of the 454 platform. a diverse bacterial community of 229 species-level taxa was revealed by culture and clonal analysis, dominated by representatives of the genera prevotella, lactobacillus, selenomonas, and streptococcus. the five most abundant species were: lactobacillus gasseri, prevotella denticola, alloprevotella tannerae, s. mutans and streptococcus sp. hot 070, which together made up 31.6 % of the sequences. two samples were dominated by lactobacilli, while the remaining samples had low numbers of lactobacilli but significantly higher numbers of prevotella species. the different primer pairs produced broadly similar data but proportions of the phylum bacteroidetes were significantly higher when primer 1387r was used. all of the primer sets underestimated the proportion of actinobacteria compared to culture. pyrosequencing analysis of the samples was performed to a depth of sequencing of 4293 sequences per sample which were identified to 264 species-level taxa, and resulted in significantly higher coverage estimates than  the clonal analysis. pyrosequencing, however, also underestimated the relative abundance of actinobacteria compared to culture.

TI  == oral bacterial dna findings in pericardial fluid.
AB  == background: we recently reported that large amounts of oral bacterial dna can be  found in thrombus aspirates of myocardial infarction patients. some case reports  describe bacterial findings in pericardial fluid, mostly done with conventional culturing and a few with pcr; in purulent pericarditis, nevertheless, bacterial pcr has not been used as a diagnostic method before. objective: to find out whether bacterial dna can be measured in the pericardial fluid and if it correlates with pathologic-anatomic findings linked to cardiovascular diseases. methods: twenty-two pericardial aspirates were collected aseptically prior to forensic autopsy at tampere university hospital during 2009-2010. of the autopsies, 10 (45.5%) were free of coronary artery disease (cad), 7 (31.8%) had mild and 5 (22.7%) had severe cad. bacterial dna amounts were determined using real-time quantitative pcr with specific primers and probes for all bacterial strains associated with endodontic disease (streptococcus mitis group, streptococcus anginosus group, staphylococcus aureus/staphylococcus epidermidis,  prevotella intermedia, parvimonas micra) and periodontal disease (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, fusobacterium nucleatus, and dialister pneumosintes). results: of 22 cases, 14 (63.6%) were positive for endodontic and 8 (36.4%) for periodontal-disease-associated bacteria. only one case was positive for bacterial culturing. there was a statistically significant association between the relative amount of bacterial dna in the pericardial fluid and the severity of cad (p=0.035). conclusions: oral bacterial dna was detectable in pericardial fluid and an association between the severity of cad and the total amount of bacterial  dna in pericardial fluid was found, suggesting that this kind of measurement might be useful for clinical purposes.

TI  == association between polycystic ovary syndrome, oral microbiota and systemic antibody responses.
AB  == polycystic ovary syndrome (pcos) is a hormonal disorder of women that not only is the leading cause of infertility but also shows a reciprocal link with oral health. this study aimed to investigate the hypothesis that the levels of putative periodontal pathogens in saliva and their antibody response in serum are elevated in pcos, compared to systemic health. a total of 125 women were included in four groups; 45 women with pcos and healthy periodontium, 35 women with pcos and gingivitis, 25 systemically and periodontally healthy women, 20 systemically  healthy women with gingivitis. salivary levels of seven putative periodontal pathogens were analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and serum antibody levels were analyzed by elisa. in women with pcos, salivary porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, streptococcus oralis and tannerella forsythia levels were higher than matched systemically healthy women,  particularly in the case of gingivitis. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and treponema denticola levels were similar among study groups. the presence of pcos  also enhanced p. gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and s. oralis serum antibody levels, when gingivitis was also present. gingival inflammation correlated positively with levels of the studied taxa in saliva, particularly in pcos. the presence of p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum in saliva also exhibited a strong positive correlation with the corresponding serum antibody levels. in conclusion, as an underlying systemic endocrine condition, pcos may quantitatively affect the composition of oral microbiota and the raised systemic response to selective members of this microbial community, exerting a confounding role in resultant gingival inflammation and periodontal health. the most consistent effect appeared to be exerted on p. gingivalis.

TI  == the presence of cariogenic and periodontal pathogens in the oral cavity of one-year-old infants delivered pre-term with very low birthweights: a case control study.
AB  == background: recently, the dental literature has focused mainly on the microbial colonization of healthy full-term infants and their mothers or caretakers. however, oral microbial acquisition by premature infants has not been adequately  investigated, and the correlation between pre-term birth and the presence of cariogenic and periodontal pathogens has not been determined. the aim of this study was to identify the presence and quantities of representative cariogenic and periodontal pathogens in the oral cavities of 12-month-old infants and compare the occurrence of these microbes between a cohort of pre-term infants with very low birthweights and a control cohort comprising full-term infants. methods: the research cohort was composed of 69 one-year-old infants, of whom 24  were born prematurely with very low birthweights and 45 of whom were carried to full term. information regarding the infants' gestational age, mode of delivery,  general health status, birthweight and antibiotic use were obtained from hospital records and through oral interviews. at 12 months of age, both groups of infants  were examined, and unstimulated saliva samples from the dorsum of the tongue and  dental plaque samples were collected. the microorganisms (streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus spp., actinomyces spp., aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, peptostreptococcus micros, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum) were identified and their quantities were evaluated using a pcr-based method. the chi-squared and fisher's factorial tests were used for the statistical evaluations. results: the infants had a high prevalence of cariogenic microbes and of fusosbacterium nucleatum and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. cariogenic microbes were detected in 91.7% of the very low birthweight infants and in all full-term infants. periodontal pathogens were present in 83% of the pre-term infants and in 96% of the full-term infants. a significant difference was found between the cohorts in terms of the presence of s. mutans. most of the  very low birthweight infants had negative values of this microbe, while the full-term infants had positive values. conclusions: this study confirms the early transmission of representative cariogenic and periodontal pathogens to the oral cavity of one-year-old infants and a higher prevalence of s. mutans in full-term  infants than in premature infants.

TI  == molecular identification and antibiotic resistant bacteria isolated from primary  dentition infections.
AB  == background: bacterial resistance to antibiotics is a health problem in many parts of the world. the aim of this study was to identify bacteria from dental infections and determine bacterial resistance to antibiotics used in dental care  in the primary dentition. methods: this cross-sectional study comprised 60 children who presented for dental treatment for active dental infections in the primary dentition. samples from dental infections were collected and bacteria were identified by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay. bacterial resistance to antibiotics was determined by colony forming units on agar plates containing amoxicillin, clindamycin and amoxillicin-clavulanic acid (a-ca) tested at 8 mug/ml or 16 mug/ml. results: clindamycin in both concentrations tested (8 mug/ml and 16 mug/ml) showed the highest bacterial resistance (85.9%), followed by amoxicillin (43.7%) and a-ca (12.0%). all comparisons among the three antibiotics used in the study exhibited statistical significance (p = <0.05) in both concentrations tested (8 mug/ml and 16 mug/ml), and under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. the most prevalent resistant species identified by pcr in primary dentition infections were: streptococcus oralis and prevotella intermedia (75.0%); treponema denticola and porphyromonas gingivalis (48.3%); streptococcus  mutans (45.0%); campylobacter rectus; and streptococcus salivarius (40%). conclusions: this study demonstrated that a-ca exhibited the lowest bacterial resistance for clinical isolates in primary dentition infections.

TI  == bioinformatic investigation of the cost management strategies of five oral microbes.
AB  == some amino acids are more energetically costly to synthesize de novo, therefore many microbes have evolved to regulate the metabolic expenditure of the cell and  reduce the energy burden of extracellular unrecyclable proteins. several oral bacterial species take up amino acids and peptides obtained from proteolysis of host proteins and hence do not rely only on de novo synthesis. the aim of this study was to investigate if five oral bacterial species implement cost management strategies to reduce the energy burden of extracellular unrecyclable proteins. since the relative de novo amino acid synthesis costs are proportional to the masses of the amino acids, the energy costs of producing proteins were assessed by calculating the mean amino acid mass for each protein. for porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, prevotella intermedia and  streptococcus sanguinis, the outer membrane/extracellular proteins are made up of a much larger percentage of lower average mass amino acids whereas cytoplasmic proteins are made up of a larger proportion of higher average mass amino acid residues. these results are consistent with the five oral bacterial species employing energy-saving mechanisms in the production of extracellular unrecyclable proteins. interestingly, the p. gingivalis and s. sanguinis genomes  exhibited significantly lower predicted mean amino acid masses compared with those of the genomes of the other three species, suggesting that this may provide them with an energy advantage with respect to protein biosynthetic cost.

TI  == influence of the periodontal status on the initial-biofilm formation on titanium  surfaces.
AB  == background: dental implants will be exposed to a complex ecosystem once they are  placed in the oral cavity. the bacterial colonization and biofilm formation on these devices will depend not only on the physicochemical surface implant properties but also on the periodontal health conditions of the patients, as these devices are exposed. purpose: the aim of this study was to correlate the subgingival microbial profile with the composition of initial biofilm formed on different microstructured titanium (ti) surfaces. materials and methods: ten periodontitis and 10 periodontally healthy subjects were included in this study.  the subjects wore a removable acrylic device with four different fixed ti surfaces for 48 hours. microbial samples of subgingival plaque and the biofilm formed on each ti surface were individually analyzed by the checkerboard dna-dna  hybridization technique. results: despite the roughness or hydrophilicity of the  ti surfaces, a characteristic pattern of bacterial adhesion was observed on each  of the study groups. however, significant differences in the proportion of the species that colonized the ti surfaces were found between the periodontitis and periodontally healthy groups. treponema denticola, neisseria mucosa, eikenella corrodens, and tannerella forsythia were detected in higher proportions on the ti disks placed in the periodontitis subjects, while significant higher proportions  of capnocytophaga sputigena, fusobacterium periodonticum, prevotella melaninogenica, and streptococcus mitis were detected on the ti disks placed in the periodontally healthy group. conclusions: the results obtained in this study  shows that the composition and the proportion of the species that initially colonize ti surfaces are highly influenced by the periodontal status more than the surface characteristics of the ti implant.

TI  == colonisation of gingival epithelia by subgingival biofilms in vitro: role of "red complex" bacteria.
AB  == objectives: biofilm formation on tooth surface results in colonisation and invasion of the juxtaposed gingival tissue, eliciting strong inflammatory responses that lead to periodontal disease. this in vitro study investigated the  colonisation of human gingival multi-layered epithelium by multi-species subgingival biofilms, and evaluated the relative effects of the "red complex" species (porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola). methods: the grown biofilm consisted of fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, veillonella dispar, p. gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, t. forsythia, t. denticola, actinomyces oris, streptococcus anginosus and streptococcus oralis, or its variant lacking the "red complex". after 48h in co-culture with the gingival epithelia, the bacterial species in the biofilm were quantified, whereas their localisation on the cell surface was investigated by combining confocal-laser scanning microscopy (clsm) and fluorescence in situ hybridisation  (fish), as well as by scanning electron microscopy (sem). results: exclusion of the "red complex" quantitatively affected s. oralis, but not other species. the "red-complex" species were all able to colonise the gingival epithelial cells. a  co-localisation trend was observed between p. gingivalis and t. denticola, as determined by fish. however, in the absence of all three "red complex" bacteria from the biofilm, an immense colonisation of streptococci (potentially s. oralis) was observed on the gingival epithelia, as confirmed by both clsm and sem. conclusions: while the "red complex" species synergise in colonizing gingival epithelia, their absence from the biofilm enhances streptococcal colonisation. this antagonism with streptococci reveals that the "red complex" may regulate biofilm virulence, with potential implications in periodontal pathogenesis.

TI  == the influence of orthodontic fixed appliances on the oral microbiota: a systematic review.
AB  == objective: to investigate whether there is scientific evidence to support the hypothesis that the presence of orthodontic fixed appliances influences the oral  microbiota. methods: the search for articles was conducted in pubmed; isi web of  knowledge and ovid databases, including articles published in english until may 17th, 2012. they should report human observational studies presenting the following keywords: "fixed orthodontic appliance" and "microbiological colonization"; or "periodontal pathogens"; or "streptococcus"; or "lactobacillus"; or "candida"; or "tannerella forsythia"; or "treponema denticola"; or "fusobacterium nucleatum"; or "actimomyces actinomycetemcomitans"; or "prevotella intermedia"; or "prevotella nigrescens"; or "porphyromonas gingivalis". articles were previously selected by title and abstract. articles that met the inclusion criteria were analyzed and classified as having low, moderate or high methodology quality. a new detailed checklist for quality assessment was developed based on the information required for applicable data extraction for reviews. the study design, sample, follow-up period, collection and microbial analysis methods, statistical treatment, results and discussion were assessed. results: the initial search retrieved 305 articles of which 33 articles were selected by title and abstract. after full-text reading, 8 articles met the inclusion criteria, out of which 4 articles were classified as having low and 4 as moderate methodological quality. the moderate methodological quality studies were included in the systematic review. conclusions: the literature revealed moderate evidence that the presence of fixed appliances influences the quantity and quality of oral microbiota.

TI  == molecular analysis of oral bacteria in dental biofilm and atherosclerotic plaques of patients with vascular disease.
AB  == background: oral bacteria have been detected in atherosclerotic plaques at a variable frequency; however, the connection between oral health and vascular and  oral bacterial profiles of patients with vascular disease is not clearly established. the aim of this study was to evaluate the presence of oral bacterial dna in the mouth and atherosclerotic plaques, in addition to assessing the patients' caries and periodontal disease history. methods: thirty samples of supragingival and subgingival plaque, saliva and atherosclerotic plaques of 13 patients with carotid stenosis or aortic aneurysm were evaluated, through real-time polymerase chain reaction, for the presence of streptococcus mutans (sm), prevotella intermedia (pi), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg) and treponema denticola (td). all patients were submitted to oral examination using the dmft (decayed, missing and filled teeth) and psr (periodontal screening and recording) indexes. histopathological analysis of the atherosclerotic plaques was performed. results: most of the patients were edentulous (76.9%). sm, pi, pg and td were detected in 100.0%, 92.0%, 15.3% and 30.7% of the oral samples, respectively. sm  was the most prevalent targeted bacteria in atherosclerotic plaques, detected in  100% of the samples, followed by pi (7.1%). the vascular samples were negative for pg and td. there was a statistically significant difference (p<0.05) between  the presence of pg and td in the oral cavity and vascular samples. conclusion: sm was found at a high frequency in oral and vascular samples, even in edentulous patients, and its presence in atherosclerotic plaques suggests the possible involvement of this bacterium in the disease progression.

TI  == transcriptional responses of treponema denticola to other oral bacterial species.
AB  == the classic organization by socransky and coworkers categorized the oral bacteria of the subgingival plaque into different complexes. treponema denticola, porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythia are grouped into the red complex that is highly correlated with periodontal disease. socransky's work closely associates red with orange complex species such as fusobacterium nucleatum and prevotella intermedia but not with members of the other complexes.  while the relationship between species contained by these complexes is in part supported by their ability to physically attach to each other, the physiological  consequences of these interactions and associations are less clear. in this study, we employed t. denticola as a model organism to analyze contact-dependent  responses to interactions with species belonging to the same complex (p. gingivalis and t. forsythia), the closely associated orange complex (using f. nucleatum and p. intermedia as representatives) and the unconnected yellow complex (using streptococcus sanguinis and s. gordonii as representatives). rna was extracted from t. denticola alone as well as after pairwise co-incubation for 5 hrs with representatives of the different complexes, and the respective gene expression profiles were determined using microarrays. numerous genes related to  motility, metabolism, transport, outer membrane and hypothetical proteins were differentially regulated in t. denticola in the presence of the tested partner species. further analysis revealed a significant overlap in the affected genes and we identified a general response to the presence of other species, those specific to two of the three complexes as well as individual complexes. most interestingly, many predicted major antigens (e.g. flagella, msp, ctlp) were suppressed in responses that included red complex species indicating that the presence of the most closely associated species induces immune-evasive strategies. in summary, the data presented here provide an in-depth understanding of the transcriptional responses triggered by contact-dependent interactions between microorganisms inhabiting the periodontal pocket.

TI  == impact of early colonizers on in vitro subgingival biofilm formation.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the impact of early colonizing species on the structure and the composition of the bacterial community developing in a subgingival 10-species biofilm model system. the model included streptococcus oralis, streptococcus anginosus, actinomycesoris, fusobacterium nucleatum subsp.  nucleatum, veillonella dispar, campylobacter rectus, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola. based on literature, we considered streptococcus oralis, streptococcus anginosus, and actinomyces oris as early colonizers and examined their role in the biofilms by either a delayed addition to the consortium, or by not inoculating at all the biofilms with these species. we quantitatively evaluated the resulting biofilms by real-time quantitative pcr and further compared the structures using confocal  laser scanning microscopy following fluorescence in situ hybridisation. the absence of the early colonizers did not hinder biofilm formation. the biofilms reached the same total counts and developed to normal thickness. however, quantitative shifts in the abundances of individual species were observed. in the absence of streptococci, the overall biofilm structure appeared looser and more dispersed. moreover, besides a significant increase of p. intermedia and a decrease of p. gingivalis , p. intermedia appeared to form filamented long chains that resembled streptococci. a. oris, although growing to significantly higher abundance in absence of streptococci, did not have a visible impact on the biofilms. hence, in the absence of the early colonizers, there is a pronounced effect on p. intermedia and p. gingivalis that may cause distinct shifts in the structure of the biofilm. streptococci possibly facilitate the establishment of p. gingivalis into subgingival biofilms, while in their absence p. intermedia became more dominant and forms elongated chains.

TI  == smoking-related cotinine levels and host responses in chronic periodontitis.
AB  == background and objective: smoking has been reported to increase the risk of periodontal disease by disrupting the balance of immune responses and tissue repair processes; however, this risk varies among smokers. cotinine levels in saliva are routinely used to measure the level of smoking, and reflect the quantity of nicotine, and other smoking-related xenobiotics that challenge host systems. this study delineated characteristics of inflammatory mediators in saliva and serum antibody responses to both periodontal pathogens and commensal bacteria in smokers as they related to cotinine levels. materials and methods: this case-control study (n = 279) examined salivary inflammatory mediator responses [interleukin (il)-1ss, il-10, prostaglandin e2, myeloperoxidase and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1], and serum igg antibody responses to three periodontal pathogens (aggregatibacter actinomyce-temcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola) and five commensal oral microorganisms (veillonella parvula, streptococcus sanguis, prevotella loescheii, actinomyces naeslundii, capnocytophaga ochracea). results: the patients were stratified into  health (n = 30), gingivitis (n = 55) and periodontitis (n = 184); cotinine levels correlated with reported smoking habits in health, less so with gingivitis, and were not correlated in periodontitis. of the inflammatory mediators/acute phase proteins, only il-1ss levels were positively associated (p < 0.001) with the pack years and cotinine levels. as might be predicted, patients with periodontitis smoked more (p < 0.001) and had higher levels of cotinine. il-1ss and antibody to a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis and t. denticola were significantly higher in the patients with periodontitis than either patients with gingivitis or who were healthy. conclusions: generally, antibody to the pathogens and commensals was lower with decreased cotinine levels. smoking exacerbated differences in both inflammatory mediators and three antibody in periodontal disease compared to healthy subjects.

TI  == inter-bacterial correlations in subgingival biofilms: a large-scale survey.
AB  == aim: although the complexity of the oral ecology and the ecological differences between health and disease are well accepted, a clear view on the dynamics in relation to disease is lacking. in this study, the prevalence and abundance of 20 key oral bacteria was assessed in health and disease and more importantly a closer look was given to the inter-bacterial relationships. materials and methods: a blinded microbiological database was analysed in this cross-sectional, retrospective study. the database was constructed based on microbiological analyses of samples from 6308 patients, with gradations of periodontitis (healthy to periodontitis). data concerning the abundance of 20 oral bacteria and probing  pocket depth were provided. results: porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, eubacterium nodatum, porphyromonas micra and porphyromonas intermedia showed a clear increase in abundance and prevalence with increasing pocket depth. correlation matrices illustrated that almost all microorganisms were in one way correlated to other species and most of these correlations were significant. several beneficial bacteria showed strong correlations with other beneficial bacteria. conclusion: knowledge on bacterial correlations can pave the way for new treatment options focusing on restoring the shifted balance.

TI  == effect of periodontal therapy on the subgingival microbiota over a 2-year monitoring period. i. overall effect and kinetics of change.
AB  == aim: to examine the 2-year post-therapy kinetics of change in the composition of  subgingival biofilms. material and methods: in this study, 178 chronic periodontitis subjects were recruited and clinically monitored at baseline, 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months after therapy. all subjects received scaling and root planing and 156 one or more of periodontal surgery, systemically administered amoxicillin + metronidazole or local tetracycline at pockets >/=5 mm. subgingival biofilm samples taken from each subject at each time point were analysed for their content of 40 bacterial species using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. the significance of changes in median species counts over time was sought using the wilcoxon or friedman tests and adjusted for multiple comparisons. results: mean counts were significantly reduced from baseline to 2 years for 30 of the 40  taxa. marked reductions were observed for periodontal pathogens including tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola and eubacterium nodatum. the kinetics of change differed from species to species. when data were subset according to baseline pd, patterns of change in the microbial profiles were generally similar. conclusion: periodontal therapy leads to a rapid reduction in periodontal pathogens, followed by a slower reduction in other taxa that can be sustained for at least 2 years.

TI  == altered phenotype and function of dendritic cells in individuals with chronic periodontitis.
AB  == objective: to investigate the effects of periodontal bacterial lysates on maturation and function of mature monocyte-derived dendritic cells (m-mddcs) derived from individuals with chronic periodontitis (cp) or healthy periodontal tissue (hp). design: m-mddcs derived from peripheral blood monocytes, cultured for 7 days in presence of interleukin (il)-4 and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (gm-csf), were stimulated with lysates of streptococcus sanguinis, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, or treponema denticola on day 4, and were then phenotyped. il-10, il-12 and ifn-gamma concentration in the supernatant of cultures were measured. results: expression of hla-dr was lower in bacterial-unstimulated mature m-mddc from cp compared to hp (p=0.04), while expression of cd1a and cd123 were higher in cp. the expression pattern of hla-dr, cd11c, cd123, and cd1a did not change on bacterial stimulation, regardless of the bacteria. stimulation with p. intermedia upregulated cd80 and cd86 in cp cells (p</=0.05). production of il-12p70 by bacterial-unstimulated m-mddcs was 5.8-fold greater in cp compared to hp. bacterial stimulation further increased il-12p70 production while decreasing il-10. significantly more ifn-gamma was produced in co-cultures of cp m-mddcs than with hp m-mddcs when cells were stimulated with p. intermedia (p=0.009). conclusions: bacterial-unstimulated m-mddc from cp exhibited a more immature phenotype but a cytokine profile biased towards proinflammatory response; this pattern was maintained/exacerbated after bacterial stimulation. p. intermedia upregulated co-stimulatory molecules and ifn-gamma expression in cp m-mddc. these events might contribute to periodontitis pathogenesis.

AB  == background and objective: subgingival biofilms are the prime etiological factor of periodontal disease. owing to their complex polymicrobial nature, quantification of individual bacterial species within the biofilm for research and diagnostic purposes can be methodologically challenging. the aims of this study were to establish a quantitative real-time pcr (qpcr) assay to quantify the bacteria used in our 10-species in vitro 'subgingival' biofilm model and to compare the quantitative outcome with fluorescence microscopy and colony-forming  unit (cfu) counts on selective agar plates. material and methods: the 10 species  included in the in vitro biofilm were streptococcus oralis, streptococcus anginosus, veillonella dispar, fusobacterium nucleatum, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, actinomyces oris, campylobacter rectus, porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia. the numbers of each species were quantified at two time points using qpcr, microscopy counting following fluorescence in-situ hybridization (fish) or immunofluorescence staining, and counting of cfus after growth on selective agar plates. results: all 10 species were successfully quantified using qpcr and fish or immunofluorescence, and the eight species culturable on selective agar plates were also quantified by counting the numbers  of cfus after growth on selective agar. in early biofilm cultures, all methods showed a significant correlation, although the absolute numbers differed between  methods. in late biofilm cultures, measurements obtained using qpcr and fish or immunofluorescence, but not by cfu counts, maintained significant correlation. cfu counts yielded lower values than did measurements made using the other two methods. conclusion: quantitative pcr and epifluorescence microscopy can be easily combined with each other to determine species-specific bacterial numbers within biofilms. however, conventional bacterial cultures cannot be as efficiently combined using these molecular detection methods. this may be crucial in designing and selecting appropriate clinical diagnostic methods for subgingival biofilm samples.

TI  == optimization of quantitative polymerase chain reactions for detection and quantification of eight periodontal bacterial pathogens.
AB  == background: the aim of this study was to optimize quantitative (real-time) polymerase chain reaction (qpcr) assays for 8 major periodontal pathogens, i.e. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, parvimonas micros, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tanerella forsythia and  treponema denticola, and of the caries pathogen streptococcus mutans. results: eighteen different primer pairs were analyzed in silico regarding specificity (using blast analysis) and the presence of secondary structures at primer binding sites (using mfold). the most specific and efficiently binding primer pairs, according to these analyses, were selected for qpcr-analysis to determine amplification efficiency, limit of quantification and intra-run reproducibility.  for the selected primer pairs, one for each species, the specificity was confirmed by assessing amplification of dna extracts from isolates of closely related species. for these primer pairs, the intercycler portability was evaluated on 3 different thermal cyclers (the applied biosystems 7300, the bio-rad iq5 and the roche light cycler 480). for all assays on the different cyclers, a good correlation of the standard series was obtained (i.e. r2 >/= 0.98), but quantification limits varied among cyclers. the overall best quantification limit was obtained by using a 2 mul sample in a final volume of 10 mul on the light cycler 480. conclusions: in conclusion, the proposed assays allow to quantify the bacterial loads of s. mutans, 6 periodontal pathogenic species and the genus fusobacterium.this can be of use in assessing periodontal risk, determination of the optimal periodontal therapy and evaluation of this treatment.

TI  == [role of infectious agents in the emergence of malignant tumors].
AB  == according to the data of the international agency for research on cancer (iarc),  at least 6 virus species (hpv, ebv, hhv-8/kshv, htlv-1, hbv, hcv), 4 helminthes species (schistosoma haematobium and japonicum, opisthorchis viverrini, clonorchis sinensis) and i bacterium species (helicobacter pylori) have been proved to be capable of causing the development of cancer. the analysis of the data available shows that merkel cell polyomavirus (mcv), herpes simplex virus (hsv), john cunningham polyomavirus (jcv), monkey virus 40 (sv40), cytomegalovirus (cmv), xenotropic murine leukemia virus (xmrv), helicobacter bilis and hepaticus, campylobacter jejuni, fusobacterium varium, enteropathogenic escherichia coli, enterotoxigenic bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides vulgatus, prevotella spp., streptococcus bovis and anginosus, treponema denticola, salmonella typhi, paratyphi and typhimurium, borrelia burgdorferi, bartonella spp., mycobacterium tuberculosis, chlamydia pneumoniae, trachomatis and psittaci, neisseria gonorrhoeae, propionibacterium acnes, tropheryma whippelii, schistosoma mansoni, opistorchis felineus, strongyloides stercoralis, taenia solium, candida  spp., paracoccidioides brasiliensis, histoplasma capsulatum and trichomonas vaginalis can also be potential etiological agents of cancer. apparently, detection of new associations between infectious agents and risk of the development of cancer will facilitate progress in elaboration of prophylaxis measures, early diagnostic methods and, probably, methods of treatment of malignant tumors.

TI  == subgingival microflora in inflammatory bowel disease patients with untreated periodontitis.
AB  == objective: to analyze the subgingival microflora composition of inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) patients with untreated chronic periodontitis and compare them with systemically healthy controls also having untreated chronic periodontitis. method: thirty ibd patients [15 with crohn's disease (cd) and 15 with ulcerative colitis (uc)] and 15 control individuals participated in the study. all patients had been diagnosed with untreated chronic periodontitis. from every patient, subgingival plaque was collected from four gingivitis and four periodontitis sites with paper points. samples from the same category (gingivitis or periodontitis) in each patient were pooled together and stored at -70 degrees  c until analysis using a checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique for 74 bacterial species. results: multiple-comparison analysis showed that the groups differed in bacterial counts for bacteroides ureolyticus, campylobacter gracilis, parvimonas micra, prevotella melaninogenica, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus mutans, and treponema denticola (p<0.001). cd  patients had significantly higher levels of these bacteria than uc patients either in gingivitis or in periodontitis sites (p<0.05). cd patients harbored higher levels of p. melaninogenica, s. aureus, s. anginosus, and s. mutans compared with controls both at gingivitis and at periodontitis sites (p<0.05). uc patients harbored higher levels of s. aureus (p=0.01) and p. anaerobius (p=0.05)  than controls only in gingivitis sites. conclusion: our study showed that even with similar clinical periodontal parameters, ibd patients harbor higher levels of bacteria that are related to opportunistic infections in inflamed subgingival  sites that might be harmful for the crucial microbe-host interaction.

TI  == a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled study on the clinical and microbial  effects of an essential oil mouth rinse used by patients in supportive periodontal care.
AB  == aim: this 3-month double-blind randomized placebo-controlled study evaluated the  clinical and microbial effects of an essential oil mouth rinse used as an adjunct to mechanical plaque control by patients in supportive periodontal care. material and methods: fifty patients were randomly allocated to an essential oil group (listerine((r)) coolmint; johnson & johnson, new brunswick, nj, usa) or placebo group to rinse twice per day as an adjunct to mechanical plaque control. at baseline and after 3 months, plaque index (pi), gingivitis index (gi), probing pocket depth, bleeding on probing (bop) and clinical attachment level were registered. subgingival plaque samples were collected for the detection and quantification of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, micromonas micros, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium genus and streptococcus mutans by means of real-time pcr (qpcr). patient's compliance, satisfaction and side effects were registered. results: twenty-three patients in the essential oil group (mean age:  57) and 21 in the placebo group (mean age: 55) with acceptable oral hygiene at intake (mean pi <1.5 on a scale of 5) adhered to the study protocol. gingivitis index, pi and bop significantly reduced over time (p </= 0.029); however, between group analyses revealed no significant differences. there was no significant change over time neither in detection frequency nor load for any of the microbiota. daily rinsing with an essential oil rinse was found safe and perceived beneficial by the patients. conclusion: patients in supportive periodontal care who are fairly compliant with oral hygiene may not benefit from  additional mouth rinsing using an essential oil solution.

TI  == peripheral arterial disease associated with caries and periodontal disease.
AB  == background: peripheral arterial disease (pad) is an important cardiovascular disorder of the peripheral arteries. chronic infections, such as periodontitis, may play an important role in the etiology and pathophysiology of pad and other cardiovascular conditions. recently, streptococcus mutans has been found with high frequency in atheromatous plaques. the aim of this study is to evaluate the  possible clinical and microbiologic association between pad and periodontitis and dental caries. methods: thirty patients with pad and 30 control individuals were  selected. pad and its severity were established by the use of the ankle-brachial  index (abi). clinical attachment loss (al); probing depth; decayed, missing, and  filled teeth (dmft) index; and c-reactive protein (crp) levels were evaluated. the presence of bacterial dna from streptococcus mutans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans was identified by polymerase chain reaction in subgingival biofilm and serum. results: patients with >/=30% al >/= 4 mm had six-fold increased risk of having pad (odds ratio = 8.18; 95% confidence interval = 1.21 to 35.23; p = 0.031). there was statistical difference in the crp (p = 0.0413) and dmft index (p = 0.0002), with elevated number of missing teeth (p = 0.0459) in the pad group compared with the control group. there were no significant differences in the frequency of bacteria in serum and subgingival plaque. conclusion: there was a positive relationship between periodontitis based on al and pad determined by the abi (odds ratio = 8.18).

TI  == adjunctive azithromycin in the treatment of aggressive periodontitis: microbiological findings of a 12-month randomized clinical trial.
AB  == objectives: to compare the subgingival microbiological outcomes of azithromycin or placebo as adjuncts to scaling and root planing (srp) in the treatment of aggressive periodontitis (agp), and to secondarily evaluate the microbiological effect of supragingival scaling in agp patients. methods: twenty-four agp subjects 13-26 years of age received a 15-day programme of supragingival scaling  (sc) and were then randomly assigned to srp with systemic azithromycin or placebo. subgingival samples were taken with sterile paper points at baseline, 15 days after sc, and at 3, 6 and 12 months following srp. microbiological analysis  was performed by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. results: changes in bacterial levels from baseline to 15 days after sc were similar in the 2 groups.  when subjects were analysed as a single group, significant reductions after sc were observed for actinomyces gerencseriae, capnocytophaga ochracea, and treponema denticola. during the 12-month follow-up, levels of most of the bacteria decreased in both groups in a similar pattern. for instance, actinomyces israelli, veillonella parvula, streptococcus gordonii, c. ochracea, eikenella corrodens, eubacterium nodatum, fusobacterium periodonticum and fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. polymorphum decreased significantly within the groups. conclusions: azithromycin was ineffective in lowering the subgingival levels of important putative periodontal pathogens in young agp subjects compared to placebo. clinical significance: scaling and root planing with adjunctive systemic azithromycin provides little additional benefit compared to placebo in reductions of major subgingival periodontal pathogens.

TI  == molecular analysis of 16s rrna genes identifies potentially periodontal pathogenic bacteria and archaea in the plaque of partially erupted third molars.
AB  == purpose: small subunit rrna sequencing and phylogenetic analysis were used to identify cultivable and uncultivable microorganisms present in the dental plaque  of symptomatic and asymptomatic partially erupted third molars to determine the prevalence of putative periodontal pathogens in pericoronal sites. materials and  methods: template dna prepared from subgingival plaque collected from partially erupted symptomatic and asymptomatic mandibular third molars and healthy incisors was used in polymerase chain reaction with broad-range oligonucleotide primers to amplify 16s rrna bacterial and archaeal genes. amplicons were cloned, sequenced,  and compared with known nucleotide sequences in online databases to identify the  microorganisms present. results: two thousand three hundred two clones from the plaque of 12 patients carried bacterial sequences from 63 genera belonging to 11  phyla, including members of the uncultivable tm7, sr1, and chloroflexi, and difficult-to-cultivate synergistetes and spirochaetes. dialister invisus, filifactor alocis, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas endodontalis, prevotella denticola, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola, which have been associated with periodontal disease, were found in significantly greater abundance in pericoronal compared with incisor sites. dialister invisus and f nucleatum were found in greater abundance in sites exhibiting clinical symptoms.  the archaeal species, methanobrevibacter oralis, which has been associated with severe periodontitis, was found in 3 symptomatic patients. conclusions: these findings have provided new insights into the complex microbiota of pericoronitis. several bacterial and archaeal species implicated in periodontal disease were recovered in greater incidence and abundance from the plaque of partially erupted third molars compared with incisors, supporting the hypothesis that the pericoronal region may provide a favored niche for periodontal pathogens in otherwise healthy mouths.

TI  == necrotizing periodontal diseases in hiv-infected brazilian patients: a clinical and microbiologic descriptive study.
AB  == objective: nowadays, necrotizing periodontal diseases have a low prevalence; however, a better understanding of the etiopathogenesis of these diseases is necessary for determining more adequate preventive and therapeutic strategies. method and materials: from a pool of 1,232 hiv-infected patients, 15 presented with necrotizing periodontal diseases, which were evaluated by full-mouth periodontal clinical measurements. subgingival biofilm samples were collected from necrotizing lesions of six of these individuals. the presence and levels of  47 bacterial species were determined by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. results: all 15 patients (10 had severe immunodeficiency) had been infected sexually. thirteen patients were taking antiretroviral medication (66.7% undergoing highly active antiretroviral therapy). regarding necrotizing periodontal diseases, necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (60%) was more prevalent  than necrotizing ulcerative periodontitis (40%). the frequency of supragingival biofilm and bleeding on probing ranged from 11.5% to 59.2% and 3.0% to 54.0%, respectively, whereas the mean probing depth and clinical attachment level were between 1.48 and 2.61 mm and 1.30 and 2.62 mm, respectively. species detected in  high prevalence and/or counts in necrotizing lesions included treponema denticola, eikenella corrodens, dialister pneumosintes, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus intermedius, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, and campylobacter rectus. in contrast, parvimonas micra, prevotella melaninogenica, fusobacterium nucleatum, eubacterium nodatum, and helicobacter pylori were observed in the lowest mean prevalence and/or counts. conclusion: necrotizing periodontal disease lesions in hiv-infected patients present a microbiota with high prevalence and/or counts of classical periodontal pathogens, in particular t denticola, as well as species not commonly considered as periodontal pathogens, such as e faecalis and d pneumosintes. in addition, these individuals with necrotizing periodontal disease frequently display severe immunodeficiency and aids-defining diseases such as tuberculosis.

TI  == gingival tissue transcriptomes in experimental gingivitis.
AB  == aims: we investigated the sequential gene expression in the gingiva during the induction and resolution of experimental gingivitis. material and methods: twenty periodontally and systemically healthy non-smoking volunteers participated in a 3-week experimental gingivitis protocol, followed by debridement and 2-week regular plaque control. we recorded clinical indices and harvested gingival tissue samples from four interproximal palatal sites in half of the participants  at baseline, day 7, day 14 and day 21 (the "induction phase"), and at day 21, day 25, day 30 and day 35 in the other half (the "resolution phase"). rna was extracted, amplified, reversed transcribed, amplified, labelled and hybridized using affymetrix human genome u133plus2.0 microarrays. paired t-tests compared gene expression changes between consecutive time points. gene ontology analyses summarized the expression patterns into biologically relevant categories. results: the median gingival index was 0 at baseline, 2 at day 21 and 1 at day 35. differential gene regulation peaked during the third week of induction and the first 4 days of resolution. leucocyte transmigration, cell adhesion and antigen processing/presentation were the top differentially regulated pathways. conclusions: transcriptomic studies enhance our understanding of the pathobiology of the reversible inflammatory gingival lesion and provide a detailed account of  the dynamic tissue responses during the induction and resolution of experimental  gingivitis.

TI  == clustering of subgingival microbial species in adolescents with periodontitis.
AB  == it has become increasingly recognized that groups of microorganisms interact within the subgingival plaque of adult subjects with periodontitis. it is much less clear, however, whether the consortia of microorganisms associated with periodontitis are different in early and more advanced cases of periodontitis. to investigate this point further, subgingival plaque was collected from six sites in 87 adolescents with periodontitis and 73 controls and the samples were analyzed for the detection of 18 microbial species using the dna-dna hybridization technique. actinomyces oris accounted for the highest proportion of the flora and was more predominant among controls. prevotella nigrescens, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, and tannerella forsythia were present at higher levels among the subjects with periodontitis. factor analyses identified one factor characterized by highly positive loadings for t. forsythia, campylobacter rectus, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, p. nigrescens, parvimonas micra, and treponema denticola, and another factor characterized by highly positive loadings of a. oris, capnocytophaga ochracea, eikenella corrodens, streptococcus intermedius, selenomonas noxia, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguinis, and veillonella parvula. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and streptococcus mutans did not load on any of the two factors, while fusobacterium  nucleatum loaded on both. these findings confirm the occurrence of clustering of  subgingival bacteria according to case status also among young individuals.

TI  == characterization of the normal bacterial flora in peri-implant sulci of partially and completely edentulous patients.
AB  == purpose: to characterize the normal bacterial flora and evaluate the presence of  periodontopathogenic bacteria around dental implants and to correlate them with the periodontal flora or, in completely edentulous patients, the alveolar gingival flora. materials and methods: clinical and radiographic parameters were  recorded to exclude peri-implantitis in 34 partially edentulous and 19 completely edentulous patients. partially edentulous patients were subdivided into two subgroups based on the depth of the periodontal pocket: </= 4 mm (n = 19) and > 4 mm (n = 15). microbial samples were collected from peri-implant sulci, the deepest periodontal sulci, and, for completely edentulous patients, from the alveolar gingiva. predominant aerobic bacteria were determined by microbiologic culturing, and multiplex polymerase chain reaction was used to detect five periodontopathogenic bacteria: porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythensis, treponema denticola, prevotella intermedia, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. results: in all the examined patients, oral streptococci were the most frequent aerobic peri-implant bacteria. the frequency of four periodontopathogenic bacteria in tooth sulci (a actino?mycetemcomitans, p gingivalis, t forsythensis, t denticola) was significantly higher around natural  teeth with deeper periodontal pockets, but there was no significant difference in the frequency of the same bacteria in peri-implant sulci in the two partially edentulous subgroups. in contrast, there were no such bacteria in the peri-implant sulci or the alveolar gingiva of completely edentulous patients. conclusions: in healthy peri-implant sulci, oral streptococci constitute the predominant bacterial flora. in partially edentulous patients four periodontopathogenic bacteria were detected around implants, and none of these bacteria were found around implants in completely edentulous patients.

TI  == the microbiota on different oral surfaces in healthy children.
AB  == introduction: knowledge of the early oral colonization patterns could provide a better understanding of oral biofilm development and disease initiation that in turn could be the basis for early preventive programmes. methods: microbial samples were collected from five different oral habitats from a total of 93 children (age 3-12 years), attending the dental school of the university of athens, who were split into three age groups. a total of 38 microbial species were sought out by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique. results: all of the test species, except parvimonas micra and porphyromonas gingivalis, differed significantly among sample locations providing quite distinct microbial  profiles for the different oral surfaces. supragingival and subgingival plaque had similar profiles and exhibited higher proportions of actinomyces species and  green complex while soft tissue samples were dominated by streptococci of the yellow complex. the profiles of the tongue dorsum and saliva were also similar. many of the species were in similar proportions in all three age groups for a given location. periodontal pathogens showed increases in proportions with increasing age. specifically, the red complex species (tannerella forsythia, p. gingivalis, treponema denticola) showed a significant increase in proportion with age (p < 0.05) in all sample locations. conclusions: the results showed a pattern of colonization in children similar to that previously found in adults. differences in the profile between age groups suggest a gradual maturation of the oral microbiota, with it being made up of an increasing number of orange and red  complex species.

TI  == detection of oral bacteria in cardiovascular specimens.
AB  == background/aims: oral bacteria, including cariogenic and periodontal pathogens, are thought to be etiological factors in the development of cardiovascular diseases. to define this relationship, we analyzed the distribution of oral bacterial species in cardiovascular specimens. method: following acceptance into  the study, 203 consecutive patients were analyzed, from whom 82 aortic valve specimens, 35 mitral valve specimens, and 86 aortic aneurysmal wall specimens, of which 16 contained aneurysmal thrombus tissues, were obtained. in addition, a total of 58 dental plaque specimens were collected from the same group of patients who underwent heart valve replacement or removal of aortic aneurysms. bacterial dna was extracted from both cardiovascular tissues and dental plaque in those cases and then species-specific polymerase chain reaction assays were used  to analyze the occurrences of six oral streptococcal and six periodontal bacterial species. results: streptococcus mutans was the most frequently detected species in the cardiovascular specimens, followed by aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. as for dental plaque specimens from patients who underwent cardiovascular operations, most of the tested periodontitis-related species as well as oral streptococci were detected at high frequencies. furthermore, the positive rate of s. mutans in cardiovascular specimens from patients whose dental plaque specimens were also positive for s. mutans was 78%, which was significantly higher than any other tested species when the same analysis was performed. conclusion: our results suggest that specific oral bacterial species,  such as s. mutans and a. actinomycetemcomitans, are related to bacteremia and may be etiologic factors for the development of cardiovascular diseases.

TI  == tinidazole inhibitory and cidal activity against anaerobic periodontal pathogens.
AB  == the in vitro activity of tinidazole against anaerobic periodontal pathogens (25 prevotella buccae, 18 prevotella denticola, 10 prevotella intermedia, 6 prevotella melaninogenica, 5 prevotella oralis, 10 fusobacterium nucleatum and 8  veillonella spp.) was determined by agar dilution. mic(90) values (minimum inhibitory concentration for 90% of the organisms) were 8 microg/ml for veillonella spp., 4 microg/ml for p. intermedia, 2 microg/ml for p. buccae, 1 microg/ml for fusobacterium spp. and 0.5 microg/ml for other prevotella spp. cidal activity was studied by killing curves with tinidazole and amoxicillin (alone and in combination) at concentrations similar to those achieved in crevicular fluid (41.2 microg/ml tinidazole and 14.05 microg/ml amoxicillin) against an inoculum of ca. 10(7)colony-forming units/ml of four bacterial groups, each one composed of four different strains of the following periodontal isolates: prevotella spp., fusobacterium spp. and veillonella spp. (anaerobes) and one amoxicillin-susceptible streptococcus spp. (facultative) in a proportion  of 1:1:1:1. when only beta-lactamase-negative prevotella or fusobacterium strains were tested, significantly higher reductions were found with amoxicillin (>4 log  reduction at 48 h) versus controls. the presence of beta-lactamase-positive prevotella spp. or f. nucleatum strains rendered amoxicillin inactive (no reductions at 48 h), with no differences from controls. amoxicillin+tinidazole produced >3 log reduction at 24h and >4 log reduction at 48 h regardless of the presence or not of beta-lactamase-positive strains. the presence in crevicular fluid of beta-lactamases produced by beta-lactamase-positive periodontal pathogens may have ecological and therapeutic consequences since it may protect beta-lactamase-negative periodontal pathogens from amoxicillin treatment. in vitro, tinidazole offered high antianaerobic activity against beta-lactamase-positive and -negative periodontal pathogens, avoiding amoxicillin inactivation.

AB  == background: the purpose of this study was to assess the effects of dental flossing on the microbial composition of interproximal plaque samples in matched  twins. methods: the study was a two-treatment, examiner-masked, randomized, parallel-group, controlled study. fifty-one twin pairs between 12 and 21 years of age were randomized to a 2-week supervised and unsupervised treatment regimen consisting of tongue brushing and toothbrushing or tongue brushing and toothbrushing plus flossing. the reverse-capture checkerboard hybridization assay was used to assess levels (abundance) of 26 microbial species in interproximal plaque samples collected from six sites per subject. an integrative computational predictive model estimated average changes in microbial abundance patterns of selected bacterial species from baseline to 2 weeks by comparing treatment groups. results: after the 2-week study period, putative periodontal pathogens and cariogenic bacteria were overabundant in the group that did not floss compared to the group that performed flossing. those included treponema denticola, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), prevotella intermedia, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), and streptococcus mutans. microbial species that are not consistent with the development of periodontal disease or dental caries were overabundant in the group that did floss compared to the non-flossing group. conclusion: in a well-matched twin cohort, tooth and tongue brushing plus flossing significantly decreased the abundance of microbial  species associated with periodontal disease and dental caries after a 2-week program.

AB  == posttreatment apical periodontitis is usually associated with persistent or secondary intraradicular infection. this study evaluated the presence and relative levels of 28 bacterial taxa in treated root canals of teeth with posttreatment apical periodontitis from german patients using 16s ribosomal rna (rrna) gene probes in a reverse-capture checkerboard hybridization assay. species-specific polymerase chain reaction (pcr) was also performed to detect enterococcus faecalis and candida albicans. bacterial dna was detected in all samples. twenty of the 28 taxon-specific probes tested were reactive with at least one sample. taxa detected more frequently included streptococcus species (47%), lactobacillus species (35%), dialister invisus (29%), eubacterium infirmum (29%), prevotella intermedia (29%), selenomonas sputigena (29%), synergistes oral clone ba121 (29%), and treponema denticola (29%). only eight taxa were present at levels >10(5). of these, streptococci and t. denticola were the most prevalent. species-specific pcr detected e. faecalis in 47% of the cases and c. albicans in  6%. findings of this study confirm the strong association between persistent/secondary intraradicular infection and posttreatment apical periodontitis. most cases harbored a mixed infection, and e. faecalis, if present, was never the most dominant species in the consortium. several other bacterial taxa were detected, and an involvement with the etiology of posttreatment apical periodontitis is suspected.

TI  == periodontal status of patients with dentin dysplasia type i: report of three cases within a family.
AB  == background: dentin dysplasia type i (ddi) is a rare hereditary disturbance of dentin formation. it is characterized by clinically normal-appearing crowns; obliteration of pulp chambers; and short, blunted and malformed roots that are commonly associated with periodontal attachment loss (pal). in this context, we report three cases within a family with similar clinical and radiographic features of ddi but with differing microbiologic and periodontal conditions. methods: a 42-year-old white female and her two daughters (25 and 10 years of age) presented with a diagnosis of ddi. probing depth (pd), clinical attachment level (cal), visible plaque, and bleeding on probing (bop) were recorded. subgingival biofilm samples were randomly collected and analyzed by checkerboard  dna-dna hybridization. results: the mother presented 34.9% of sites with pd > or  =4 mm, 41.3% of sites with cal > or =4 mm, and 57% of sites with bop; both daughters presented no sites with pd or cal >3 mm and <10% of sites with bop. microbiologic analysis detected gemella morbillorum, neisseria mucosa, and staphylococcus aureus in > or =50% of the mother's samples. the daughters showed  high levels (>10(4) bacterial cells) of some periodontopathic bacteria, including members of the red (porphyromonas gingivalis) and orange (fusobacterium periodonticum and f. nucleatum polymorphum) complexes and beneficial species of the yellow (streptococcus gordonii) and purple (veillonella parvula) complexes. the mother presented high mean levels only for four tested species (n. mucosa, prevotella melaninogenica, treponema denticola, and v. parvula). conclusion: a combination of radiographs, microbiologic analysis, and preventive professional monitoring care is important to avoid pal and to provide oral health in patients  with ddi.

TI  == pcr-based identification of selected pathogens associated with endodontic infections in deciduous and permanent teeth.
AB  == objective: the aim of the present study was to evaluate the presence of the selected pathogens in samples from deciduous and permanent tooth root canals by using pcr method and to determine the association of these organisms with clinical symptoms. study design: a total of 145 children, 5 to 13 years old, were involved in this study. the presence of selected pathogens (actinomyces israelii, candida albicans, enterococcus faecalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas endodontalis, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, streptococcus intermedius, treponema denticola, parvimonas micra, tannerella forsythensis, enterococcus faecium, prevotella melaninogenica) in infected root canals was studied using pcr. results: t. denticola (p = .012, .02) and e. faecalis (p = .012, .04) were highly associated with periapical radiolucency and previous pain, while p. gingivalis was associated with tenderness to percussion in both deciduous and permanent teeth (p = .01, .015). conclusion: the results of the present study confirm that certain species of microorganisms are associated with  clinical signs and symptoms of endodontic disease in both deciduous and permanent teeth.

TI  == comparative analysis of putative periodontopathic bacteria by multiplex polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == background and objective: the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) has been applied for the rapid and specific detection of periodontopathic bacteria in subgingival  plaque and is potentially of clinical benefit in the diagnosis and treatment of periodontitis subjects. however, several technical points need to be modified before the conventional pcr detection system can be used by clinicians. material  and methods: to develop a pcr-based technique more applicable for clinical use than conventional pcr, we established a multiplex pcr for five putative periodontopathic (treponema denticola, porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter  actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia and tannerella forsythia) and two nonperiodontopathic (streptococcus sanguinis and streptococcus salivarius) species of bacteria using whole-plaque suspension as templates, and detected bacteria in subgingival plaque taken from 85 subjects at the supportive periodontal therapy stage after active periodontal treatments. results: among putative periodontopathic bacteria, the detection frequency of t. denticola and p. gingivalis was elevated in parallel with higher probing pocket depth and clinical attachment loss, and had 4.2-14.1 times increasing odds of the clinical  parameters tested. detection of any of the five species of putative periodontopathic bacteria markedly increased the odds ratio of a higher probing pocket depth, clinical attachment loss and bleeding on probing. conclusion: the multiplex pcr system developed in this study enabled the detection of all the bacteria under investigation in one reaction tube in a less time- and labor-intensive manner than conventional pcr. these results support the potential clinical use of multiplex pcr for detecting periodontopathic bacteria and for evaluating therapeutic strategies and predicting the prognosis for each subject.

TI  == innate immune responses of gingival epithelial cells to nonperiodontopathic and periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  == background and objective: we have previously reported different susceptibilities  of periodontopathic and nonperiodontopathic bacteria to antimicrobial peptides and phagocytosis by neutrophils. differences between the two groups of bacteria may exist also in their ability to induce immune responses from the host. therefore, we evaluated the effects of various oral bacteria on innate immune responses by gingival epithelial cells. material and methods: hok-16b cells were  cocultured with live or lysed nonperiodontopathic (n = 3) and periodontopathic (n = 5) bacterial species. the levels of human beta defensin-1, -2 and -3, and of the cathelicidin, ll-37, were examined by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and the accumulated interleukin-8 and interleukin-1 alpha were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. results:  nonperiodontopathic bacteria up-regulated some antimicrobial peptides without affecting the levels of cytokines. in the periodontopathic group, the orange-complex bacteria induced antimicrobial peptides and interleukin-8 efficiently, but the red-complex bacteria often demonstrated suppressive effects. in contrast to live bacteria, bacterial lysates had no suppressive effects. in addition, some bacterial lysates demonstrated a reduced ability to induce antimicrobial peptides compared with live bacteria. conclusion: the nonperiodontopathic, the orange-complex, and the red-complex bacteria had different effects on the innate immune responses from gingival epithelial cells,  which may affect the outcome of their host-microbial interaction in gingival sulcus.

TI  == odontogenic bacteria in periodontal disease and resistance patterns to common antibiotics used as treatment and prophylaxis in odontology in spain.
AB  == resistance in streptococci or gram-negative bacteria is associated with antibiotic consumption. scarce information exists on the antibiotic susceptibility of bacterial isolates from patients with periodontitis in countries with high antibiotic consumption, as this is an area in which microbiological testing is not performed in daily practice. the present study was undertaken to explore the susceptibility of bacterial isolates in periodontitis to antibiotics prescribed in odontology in spain as treatment for local infections or prophylaxis for distant focal infections. periodontal samples were  prospectively collected in 48 patients classified by pocket depth of <4 mm and >or=4 mm. species were identified by culture, selecting the five most frequent morphotypes per sample, and polymerase chain reaction (pcr). susceptibility was determined by e-test. a total of 261 isolates were identified: 72.9% patients had streptococcus oralis; 70.8% streptococcus mitis; 60.4% prevotella buccae; 39.6% prevotella denticola; 37.5% fusobacterium nucleatum; 35.4% prevotella intermedia; 25% capnocytophaga spp.; 23% veillonella spp.; 22.9% prevotella melaninogenica and streptococcus sanguis; and <20% other species. streptococcus viridans resistance rates were 0% for amoxicillin, approximately 10% for clindamycin, 9-22% for tetracycline, and for azithromycin ranged from 18.2% for s. sanguis to  47.7% for s. mitis. prevotella isolates were susceptible to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, with amoxicillin resistance ranging from 17.1% in p. buccae to 26.3% in p. denticola. metronidazole resistance was <6% in all prevotella species, while clindamycin resistance ranged from 0 to 21.1%. beta-lactamase production was positive in 54.1% prevotella spp., 38.9% f. nucleatum, 30% capnocytophaga spp., and 10% veillonella spp. in this study, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid was the most active antibiotic against all species tested, followed by metronidazole in the case of anaerobes.

TI  == the microbiological profiles of saliva, supragingival and subgingival plaque and  dental caries in adults with and without type 2 diabetes mellitus.
AB  == introduction: the relationships between suspected bacteria in saliva, yeasts in oral rinse, and supragingival and subgingival plaque versus root surface and coronal caries in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus and a non-diabetic group were explored. methods: one-hundred and five patients with type 2 diabetes and 103 non-diabetic subjects were recruited; their periodontal status, plaque index  and magnitude of root surface and coronal caries were assessed. saliva and an oral rinse were cultured for mutans streptococci, lactobacilli and yeasts. toothbrush samples of supragingival plaque and curette samples of subgingival plaque were assessed for 17 bacterial species using the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method. results: type 2 diabetes patients had significantly more severe periodontitis, a higher plaque index and a higher prevalence and magnitude of root surface caries than non-diabetic subjects. significantly more diabetic subjects had higher levels of treponema denticola, prevotella nigrescens, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus oralis and streptococcus intermedius in their supragingival plaque than non-diabetic subjects. no significant difference  was found for the organisms in saliva, oral rinse and subgingival plaque between  the two groups. after adjustment for diabetic status, root surface caries was associated with an increased count of mutans streptococci, lactobacilli and yeasts in saliva and of streptococcus mutans in supragingival plaque samples. coronal caries was only associated with lactobacilli and yeasts in saliva. conclusion: the number of cariogenic organisms in saliva and oral rinse estimated by culture demonstrated a stronger association with both root surface and coronal caries compared to those 17 species assessed with the checkerboard method in supragingival and subgingival plaque.

TI  == phylogenetic analysis of bacterial and archaeal species in symptomatic and asymptomatic endodontic infections.
AB  == phylogenetic analysis of bacterial and archaeal 16s rrna was used to examine polymicrobial communities within infected root canals of 20 symptomatic and 14 asymptomatic patients. nucleotide sequences from approximately 750 clones amplified from each patient group with universal bacterial primers were matched to the ribosomal database project ii database. phylotypes from 37 genera representing actinobacteria, bacteroidetes, firmicutes, fusobacteria and proteobacteria were identified. results were compared to those obtained with species-specific primers designed to detect prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas  gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, peptostreptococcus micros, enterococcus sp., streptococcus sp., fusobacterium nucleatum, tannerella forsythensis and treponema denticola. since members of the domain archaea have been implicated in  the severity of periodontal disease, and a recent report confirms that archaea are present in endodontic infections, 16s archaeal primers were also used to detect which patients carried these prokaryotes, to determine if their presence correlated with severity of the clinical symptoms. a methanobrevibacter oralis-like species was detected in one asymptomatic and one symptomatic patient. dna from root canals of these two patients was further analysed using species-specific primers to determine bacterial cohabitants. trep. denticola was  detected in the asymptomatic but not the symptomatic patient. conversely, porph.  endodontalis was found in the symptomatic but not the asymptomatic patient. all other species except enterococci were detected with the species-specific primers  in both patients. these results confirm the presence of archaea in root canals and provide additional insights into the polymicrobial communities in endodontic  infections associated with clinical symptoms.

TI  == microbiota of the dorsum of the tongue after plaque accumulation: an experimental study in humans.
AB  == background: the purpose of the present investigation was to determine the effect  of the absence of tongue hygiene on the microbiota of the dorsum of the tongue. methods: ten volunteers (aged 19 to 22 years) entered the study at baseline and were instructed to abstain from tongue cleaning for 7 days, followed by a period  of 3 days without any kind of oral hygiene. subsequently, a period of 21 days of  washout was employed, and this protocol was repeated three times. microbiological samples were obtained from the dorsum of the tongue at baseline and at the end of the period of coating accumulation and analyzed using the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique. results: the species found in highest mean counts at baseline and day 10 were prevotella melaninogenica and veillonella parvula. the mean bacterial total counts enhanced significantly during the study (from 17.1x10(6) to 33.7x10(6)). proportions of red and blue complexes and levels of 18 species also increased after the period of coating accumulation, including several periodontal pathogens, such as prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, streptococcus constellatus, tannerella forsythensis, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and p. melaninogenica. conclusion: the tongue surface could be an important reservoir for periodontal pathogens and may play a  role in the recolonization of tooth surfaces and in the etiology of oral halitosis.

TI  == identification of oral bacteria associated with crevicular epithelial cells from  chronic periodontitis lesions.
AB  == bacterial invasion of host epithelial cells plays an important role in the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases; however, the interactions between subgingival species and the gingival crevice cells are not fully understood. this study determined the prevalence of a group of oral bacterial species on or in epithelial cells derived from periodontal pockets and the gingival crevice of subjects with periodontitis. samples of epithelial cells were obtained from 120 sites with periodontal pockets > or =4 mm and 92 periodontally healthy sites from 49 patients (mean age 46.3+/-1.4 years; 43% males) with chronic periodontitis. bacteria in or on epithelial cells were separated from unattached bacteria by percoll density-gradient centrifugation. the presence and levels of 33 oral species were determined in epithelial cell samples by whole genomic dna probes and the checkerboard method. the most frequently detected species were porphyromonas gingivalis (42%), treponema denticola (38%), prevotella intermedia  (37%), streptococcus intermedius (36%), campylobacter rectus (35%), streptococcus sanguinis (35%) and streptococcus oralis (34%). species of actinomyces were found in low prevalence and levels. the data indicated that there were more micro-organisms on or in epithelial cells obtained from periodontal pockets than  from healthy sulci; however, no significant differences regarding the percentage  and level of any specific species were found between these sites. veillonella parvula, s. oralis, streptococcus gordonii and streptococcus mitis tended to be more prevalent in sites without disease. these findings demonstrated that a wide  range of oral species may be detected on or in crevicular epithelial cells from sites with periodontitis and from periodontally healthy sulci.

TI  == detection of bacterial dna in atheromatous plaques by quantitative pcr.
AB  == this is the first study to analyze atheromatous plaques for the presence of bacterial dna from ten species, including periodontal species and chlamydia pneumoniae. we examined 129 samples of dna extracted from atheromas from 29 individuals for the presence of bacterial 16s rdna sequences from ten different species: porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (a.a.), tannerella forsythensis, eikenella corrodens, prevotella intermedia, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus mutans, treponema denticola and c. pneumoniae. all determinations were made using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (pcr) methods employing sybr green. species from the bacteroides family were found in about 17% of the young but approximately 80% in elderly patients. almost half of the samples contained dna from a. a. and c. pneumoniae, although the proportion of the latter was minimal. s. aureus and s. epidermidis were found with the lowest frequency, 5 and 10%, respectively. s. mutans was found in approximately 20% of the samples. the proportions of each bacterial species were calculated relative to the total amount of prokaryotic dna. the data support our previous findings of an association between periodontal organisms and vascular inflammation. we conclude  that dna from oral infectious agents is commonly found in atheromas from young but especially from elderly subjects, and that the contribution of c. pneumoniae  to the inflammation may be minimal.

TI  == streptococci dominate the diverse flora within buccal cells.
AB  == previously, we reported that intracellular actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans,  porphyromonas gingivalis, and tannerella forsythensis were present within buccal  epithelial cells from human subjects, as lesser components of a polymicrobial flora. in this study, we further characterized that intracellular flora by using  the same double-labeling techniques to identify fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia, oral campylobacter species, eikenella corrodens, treponema denticola, gemella haemolysans, granulicatella adiacens, and total streptococci within buccal epithelial cells. all those species were found within buccal cells. in every case, species recognized by green-labeled species-specific probes were accompanied by other bacteria recognized only by a red-labeled universal probe. streptococci appeared to be a major component of the polymicrobial intracellular  flora, being present at a level from one to two logs greater than the next most common species (g. adiacens). this is similar to what is observed in oral biofilms, where diverse species interact in complex communities that often are dominated by streptococci.

TI  == subgingival microbiota levels and their associations with periodontal status at the sampled sites in an adult sudanese population using miswak or toothbrush regularly.
AB  == little information is available on the effect of miswak use on gingival microbiota. we assessed levels of 28 oral bacteria in subgingival plaque of adult sudanese miswak (n = 38) and toothbrush users (n = 36) age range 20-53 years (mean 34.6 years) to study associations between these bacteria, oral hygiene method, and periodontal status at the sampled sites. a pooled subgingival plaque  sample from 6 probing sites of 1 selected tooth in each jaw was obtained from each subject. whole genomic dna probes and the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization were used in assessing 74 pooled samples. using 10(5) bacterial cells threshold,  between 2.6% and 47.4% of miswak users and between 2.8% and 36.1% of toothbrush users harbored the investigated species. the percentages of subjects with the investigated species at 10(6) bacterial cells varied between 2.6% and 39.5% in miswak and between 2.8% and 36.1% in toothbrush users. miswak users harbored significantly higher streptococcus intermedius, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, veillonella parvula, actinomyces israelii, and capnocytophaga gingivalis, and significantly lower selenomonas sputigena, streptococcus salivarius, actinomyces naeslundii, and streptococcus oralis than did toothbrush users. probing pocket depth > or = 6 mm showed significantly (p <  0.05) higher levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium nucleatum, and v. parvula than those 4-5 mm. our results indicate that the type of oral hygiene had a significant effect on levels of 11 out of 28 bacterial species, and that the type of effect was also dependent on type of bacteria and probing pocket depth.

AB  == background: little is known about the periodontal status of patients with sjogren's syndrome (ss), a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease characterized  by xerophthalmia and xerostomia. the aim of the present study was to evaluate whether the periodontal status of ss patients, in terms of clinical and microbiological parameters, differs from systemically healthy age- and gender-matched controls. methods: 8 primary ss and 10 secondary ss patients were  examined in comparison with 11 control subjects. all patients were diagnosed by the european community criteria. control subjects were systemically healthy and not undergoing periodontal treatment. the comparison of clinical status was made  in terms of mean periodontal parameters (plaque index, gingival index, gingival recession, probing pocket depth, probing attachment level and bleeding on probing) as well as the frequency distribution of probing pocket depth and probing attachment level measurements. microbiological assays of the subgingival  dental plaque samples were carried out by both a chairside enzyme test (periocheck) for the detection of peptidase activity (pa) and a polymerase chain  reaction (pcr) analysis for 9 selected periodontal micro-organisms (actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola, porphyromonas gingivalis, eikenella corrodens, campylobacter rectus, bacteroides forsythus, streptococcus oralis). results: the  occurrence, severity and extent of periodontal lesions were not significantly different between the 3 patient groups for all periodontal parameters examined. no significant differences in the sub-gingival plaque samples from control, primary or secondary ss patients for the pa test, frequency or type of periodontal micro-organisms observed. conclusion: no significant differences could be detected in either clinical or microbiological parameters of primary or  secondary ss patients compared with that of control subjects. the results of the  present study thus support the notion that the periodontal status of patients with ss do not differ from systemically healthy age- and gender-matched controls.

AB  == background/aim: the purpose of the present investigation was to determine the effect of self-performed supragingival plaque removal using either manual (crest  complete) or power (braun 3d plaque remover) toothbrushing on supra and subgingival plaque composition. methods: 47 periodontal maintenance subjects completed this single-blind 6 month longitudinal study. at baseline, samples of supra and separately subgingival plaque were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in each subject using sterile curettes and individually analyzed for their  content of 18 bacterial taxa using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. after random assignment to groups receiving either a manual (n=25) or power toothbrush  (n=22), subjects received instruction in oral hygiene and used their assigned toothbrush 2x daily for 6 months. clinical monitoring and microbiological sampling were repeated at 3 and 6 months. significant differences in microbiological measures over time were sought using the quade test and between brushing groups at each time point using the mann-whitney test. results: mean total counts were significantly reduced for supra- and subgingival plaque samples in the manual group and subgingival samples in the powered brushing group. actinomyces naeslundii and actinomyces israelii/gerencseriae were the most numerous organisms detected at baseline and showed the greatest reductions in counts in both brushing groups. streptococcus constellatus/intermedius was significantly reduced in both groups, while streptococcus mitis/oralis/sanguis was significantly reduced in the manual toothbrushing group. mean counts of species were more markedly altered in subgingival plaque. major reductions occurred in both groups for a. naeslundii, a. israelii/gerencseriae, peptostreptococcus micros, veillonella parvula, prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, s. mitis/oralis/sanguis and s. constellatus/intermedius. all taxa examined were reduced in prevalence (% of sites colonized) in the subgingival plaque samples for both brushing groups. the reductions in prevalence were greater for a. naeslundii, s. constellatus/intermedius, v. parvula, a. israelii/gerencseriae, s. mitis/oralis/sanguis, p. micros, streptococcus mutans and p. intermedia/nigrescens. mean prevalence was decreased more for porphyromonas gingivalis, campylobacter rectus/showae, treponema denticola and bacteroides forsythus in supragingival plaque than subgingival plaque. conclusions: the major finding was the effect of supragingival plaque removal on the composition of the  subgingival microbiota. counts and prevalence of most taxa examined were markedly decreased in both toothbrushing groups. this reduction should translate to a decreased risk of periodontal disease initiation or recurrence. further, the decreased prevalence of periodontal pathogens in supragingival plaque lowers potential reservoirs of these species.

AB  == aim: the current investigation evaluated changes in levels and proportions of 40  bacterial species in subgingival plaque samples during, immediately after and up  to 1 year after metronidazole or amoxicillin therapy combined with srp. method: after baseline clinical and microbiological monitoring, 17 adult periodontitis subjects received full mouth srp and 14 days systemic administration of either metronidazole (250 mg, tid, n=8) or amoxicillin (500 mg, tid, n=9). clinical measurements including % of sites with plaque, gingival redness, bleeding on probing and suppuration, pocket depth (pd) and attachment level (al) were made at baseline, 90, 180 and 360 days. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial surface of all teeth in each subject at baseline, 90, 180 and 360 days and from 2 randomly selected posterior teeth at 3, 7, and 14 days during and after antibiotic administration. counts of 40 subgingival species were determined using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. significance of differences over time was determined using the quade test and between groups using ancova. results: mean pd was reduced from 3.22+/-0.12 at baseline to 2.81+/-0.16 (p<0.01) at 360 days and  from 3.38+/-0.23 mm to 2.80+/-0.14 mm (p<0.01) in the amoxicillin and metronidazole treated subjects respectively. corresponding values for mean al were 3.21+/-0.30 to 2.76+/-0.32 (p<0.05) and 3.23+/-0.28 mm to 2.94+/-0.23 mm (p<0.01). levels and proportions of bacteroides forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola were markedly reduced during antibiotic administration and were lower than baseline levels at 360 days. counts (x10(5), +/-sem) of b. forsythus fell from baseline levels of 0.66+/-0.16 to 0.04+/-0.02,  0.13+/-0.04, 0.10+/-0.03 and 0.42+/-0.19 in the amoxicillin group at 14, 90, 180  and 360 days respectively (p<0.001). corresponding values for metronidazole treated subjects were: 1.69+/-0.28 to 0.02+/-0.01, 0.20+/-0.08, 0.22+/-0.06 and 0.22+/-0.08 (p<0.001). counts of campylobacter species, eubacterium nodatum, fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies, f. periodonticum and prevotella nigrescens were also detected at lower mean levels during and immediately after therapy, but gradually increased after withdrawal of the antibiotics. members of the genera actinomyces, streptococcus and capnocytophaga were minimally affected by metronidazole. however, amoxicillin decreased the counts and proportions of actinomyces species during and after therapy. conclusions: the data suggest that  metronidazole and amoxicillin are useful in rapidly lowering counts of putative periodontal pathogens, but must be accompanied by other procedures to bring about periodontal stability.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of silver nitrate against periodontal pathogens.
AB  == metal ions were evaluated as potential antimicrobial agents suitable for local delivery in the oral cavity for the treatment of periodontitis. silver nitrate, copper chloride, and zinc chloride were tested for antimicrobial activity in in vitro killing assays conducted in phosphate buffered saline with a series of oral bacteria including gram-negative periodontal pathogens and gram-positive streptococci. copper and zinc salts failed to exhibit strong and consistent activity against periodontal pathogens. in contrast, silver at a concentration of 0.5 microg/ml produced a 3 log10 reduction in colony forming units (cfu)/ml or greater against all periodontal pathogens tested including porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella denticola, bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium nucleatum vincentii, campylobacter gracilis, campylobacter rectus,  eikenella corrodens, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. in comparison, substantially higher concentrations of silver nitrate failed to kill oral streptococci. a silver nitrate concentration of 25 microg/ml produced log10 reductions in cfu/ml of 3.5-5 in killing assays performed in human serum against  p. gingivalis, demonstrating the ability of silver to retain activity in a biological medium similar to that encountered in vivo in the periodontal pocket.  these results identify silver nitrate, an antimicrobial that may possess advantages over traditional antibiotics, as a potential agent for controlled release local delivery in the oral cavity for the treatment of periodontitis.

TI  == smoking and subgingival microflora in periodontal disease.
AB  == aim: the present investigation was undertaken to analyze the influence of smoking on the periodontal disease associated subgingival microflora. the population included 33 smokers and 31 non-smokers in the age range 36-86 years. methods: microbial samples were obtained from 4 sites per patient. the checker-board dna-dna hybridization technology was used for detection of the bacterial species  p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, p. nigrescens, b. forsythus, a. actinomycetemcomitans, f. nucleatum, t. denticola, p. micros, c. rectus, e. corrodens, s. noxia and s. intermedius. results: using score 1 as cutoff, contrasting colonized versus non-colonized patients, 8 out of 12 species were detected in > or = 90% of both smokers and non-smokers. using score 4 as cutoff,  contrasting heavily colonized patients versus non-colonized and less heavily colonized patients, the detection rates decreased in both smokers and non-smokers. no significant differences in detection rates were observed between  smokers and non-smokers. logistic regression analysis indicated that neither smoking, probing depth nor gingival bleeding influenced the occurrence of the species analyzed. the lack of a smoking exposure dose-response further supported  the indication of a limited influence of smoking. conclusion: smoking exerts little, if any, influence on the subgingival occurrence of several of the bacteria most commonly associated with periodontal disease.

TI  == assessment of periradicular microbiota by dna-dna hybridization.
AB  == in the present study the "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridization technique was used  to identify bacteria in periapical endodontic lesions of asymptomatic teeth. thirty-four patients with root-filled teeth and apical periodontitis were divided into two groups, each containing 17 patients. in group 1, a marginal incision was performed during surgery to expose the lesion, and in group 2, a submarginal incision was applied. the gingiva and mucosa were swabbed with an 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate solution prior to surgery. bacterial dna was identified in all samples from the two groups using 40 different whole genomic probes. the mean number (+/- sd) of species detected was 33.7 +/- 3.3 in group 1 and 21.3 +/- 6.3 in group 2 (p < 0.001). the majority of the probe-detected bacteria were present in more lesions from group 1 than from group 2. the differences were most notable for campylobacter gracilis, porphyromonas endodontalis, propionibacterium acnes, capnocytophaga gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. nucleatum, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. polymorphum, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola, streptococcus constellatus and actinomyces naeslundii i. bacterial species such as actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and bacteroides forsythus were detected in more than 60% of the lesions from both groups. also, p. endodontalis was abundant in periapical tissue. the data supported the idea that  following a marginal incision, bacteria from the periodontal pocket might reach the underlying tissues by surgeon-released bacteremia. the study provided solid evidence that bacteria invade the periapical tissue of asymptomatic teeth with apical periodontitis. the detection of much more bacteria with the "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridization method than has previously been recovered by anaerobic culture indicated that the endodontic (and periodontal) microfloras should be redefined using molecular methods.

TI  == the clinical and microbiological effects of systemic ornidazole in sites with and without subgingival debridement in early-onset periodontitis patients.
AB  == background: the purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical and microbiological effects of systemic ornidazole (orn) in sites with or without subgingival debridement in early-onset periodontitis (eop) patients. methods: two pooled bacterial samples consisting of 4 sites each (scaled and non-scaled sites) were obtained from 30 individuals exhibiting eop. all patients received oral hygiene instruction (ohi), supragingival scaling and orn. subgingival scaling and root planing (srp) was carried out only in scaled sites. bacterial samples were taken at baseline (bl) and 1 week and 2, 6, and 12 months after systemic ornidazole administration (500 mg/bid for 7 days). one more sample was taken at scaled sites, one week after srp. results: one week following srp (scaled sites)  gram-negative facultative and anaerobic rods were significantly reduced while gram-positive facultative cocci were significantly increased. after orn administration, p. gingivalis, p. denticola, p. intermedia, b. forsythus, c. rectus, and s. sputigena were no longer detectable in either scaled or non-scaled sites. a statistically significant long-term (2, 6, and 12 months) reduction of p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, p. loescheii, b. forsythus, and c. rectus and a pronounced increase of s. milleri, s. oralis, and s. sanguis counts in both scaled and non-scaled sites were detected in comparison to baseline. a sustained  reduction of bleeding tendency and of probing depth was also observed in both scaled and non-scaled sites. conclusions: orn combined with srp effects beneficial shifts in the bacterial population associated with substantial clinical improvement, thereby indicating that orn is effective adjunct in the treatment of eop deep periodontal pockets where anaerobic bacteria are predominant.

TI  == porphyromonas gingivalis platelet aggregation activity: outer membrane vesicles are potent activators of murine platelets.
AB  == recent evidence has established an association between chronic periodontitis and  cardiovascular disease. periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease caused by a small group of gram-negative bacteria, of which porphyromonas gingivalis is considered an important causative agent. it has been proposed that dental plaque  bacteria and their products can disseminate into the bloodstream from the site of infection and promote thromboembolic events associated with atherosclerosis and myocardial infarction. in this regard, streptococcus sanguis and p. gingivalis have been shown to induce platelet aggregation in vitro. here we report that p. gingivalis was able to induce platelet aggregation, and that oral strains of actinobaillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus, campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia and trepenoma denticola failed to  aggregate platelets when tested for platelet aggregation activity under similar conditions. additionally, we show that vesicles (outer membrane evaginations that are shed into the environment by the bacteria) of p. gingivalis are potent inducers of mouse platelet aggregation in vitro. in summary, our data show that i) initial adherence of the bacterium to platelet may be facilitated by p. gingivalis fimbriae and ii) p. gingivalis vesicles possess platelet aggregation-inducing activity.

TI  == microbiological parameters associated with il-1 gene polymorphisms in periodontitis patients.
AB  == background, aims: polymorphisms in the cluster of il-1 genes have been significantly associated with the severity of adult periodontitis. the purpose of this study was to compare microbiological parameters in il-1 genotype negative and positive adult subjects with a range of periodontitis severities. method: the study included 108 subjects in good general health. clinical parameters were recorded at 6 sites/tooth excluding 3rd molars and included: plaque accumulation, gingival erythema, bleeding on probing, suppuration, pocket depth and attachment  level. subgingival plaque samples were collected from the mesiobuccal surface of  up to 28 teeth in each subject (mean 25.3) providing a total of 2736 samples. the levels of 40 subgingival taxa were determined in each sample using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. fingerstick blood samples were collected for il-1a (+4845) and il-1b (+3954) genotyping using pcr-based methods. results: the proportion of  il-1 genotype positive subjects that exhibited mean counts of specific subgingival species above selected thresholds was significantly higher than the proportion of genotype negative subjects. prominent among species that were detected at higher levels in genotype positive subjects were members of the "red" and "orange" complexes and included: bacteroides forsythus, treponema denticola,  the fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies, fusobacterium periodonticum, campylobacter gracilis, campylobacter showae and streptococcus constellatus. streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus gordonii and 3 capnocytophaga species were also detected more frequently at high numbers in genotype positive subjects. significantly higher mean counts of b. forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis, t. denticola, the f. nucleatum subspecies, f. periodonticum, campylobacter rectus, c. showae, eubacterium nodatum, s. constellatus, s. gordonii, and s. intermedius  were detected at periodontal pockets >6 mm in subjects who were genotype positive when compared with genotype negative subjects. the increase was due to increased  numbers of cells of these species rather than a major shift in proportion. conclusion: the data suggest that genotype positive subjects more frequently had  higher levels of "red" and "orange" complex species that are known to be strongly associated with measures of periodontal inflammation.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity of propolis and arnica montana against oral pathogens.
AB  == arnica and propolis have been used for thousands of years in folk medicine for several purposes. they possess several biological activities such as anti-inflammatory, antifungal, antiviral and tissue regenerative, among others. although the antibacterial activity of propolis has already been demonstrated, very few studies have been done on bacteria of clinical relevance in dentistry. also, the antimicrobial activity of arnica has not been extensively investigated. therefore the aim here was to evaluate in vitro the antimicrobial activity, inhibition of adherence of mutans streptococci and inhibition of formation of water-insoluble glucan by arnica and propolis extracts. arnica montana (10%, w/v) and propolis (10%, w/v) extracts from minas gerais state were compared with controls. fifteen microorganisms were used as follows: candida albicans--ntcc 3736, f72; staphylococcus aureus--atcc 25923; enterococcus faecalis--atcc 29212;  streptococcus sobrinus 6715; strep. sanguis--atcc 10556; strep. cricetus--hs-6; strep. mutans--ingbritt 1600; strep. mutans--omz 175; actinomyces naeslundii--atcc 12104, w 1053; act. viscosus omz 105; porphyromonas gingivalis;  porph. endodontalis and prevotella denticola (the last three were clinical isolates). antimicrobial activity was determined by the agar diffusion method and the zones of growth inhibition were measured. to assess cell adherence to a glass surface, the organisms were grown for 18 h at 37 degrees c in test-tubes at a 30  degree angle. to assay water-insoluble glucan formation, a mixture of crude glucosyltransferase and 0.125 m sucrose was incubated for 18 h at 37 degrees c in test-tubes at a 30 degree angle. arnica and propolis extracts (20 microl) were added to these tubes to evaluate the % of inhibition of cell adherence and water-insoluble glucan formation. the propolis extract significantly inhibited all the microorganisms tested (p < 0.05), showing the largest inhibitory zone for actinomyces spp. the arnica extract did not demonstrate significant antimicrobial activity. cell adherence and water-insoluble glucan formation were almost completely inhibited by the propolis extract at a final concentration of 400 microg/ml and 500 microg/ml, respectively. the arnica extract showed slight inhibition of the adherence of the growing cells (19% for strep. mutans and 15% for strep. sobrinus) and of water-insoluble glucan formation (29%) at these same  concentrations. thus, the propolis extract showed in vitro antibacterial activity, inhibition of cell adherence and inhibition of water-insoluble glucan formation, while the arnica extract was only slightly active in those three conditions.

TI  == subgingival microbial profile of papillon-lefevre patients assessed by dna-probes.
AB  == the prevalence of 18 selected bacterial species was assessed by means of "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridisation in a group of 12 saudi-arabian adolescents with papillon-lefevre syndrome. a total of 36 tooth sites were investigated. the  patients exhibited severe periodontal disease with deep pockets. all 12 patients  harboured the putative bacterial pathogens p. intermedia, f. nucleatum, p. micros and s. intermedius while t. denticola, b. forsythus, p. nigrescens, e. corrodens, s. noxia and c. rectus were recovered from 11 patients. p. gingivalis was recovered from 9 patients and 18 sites while corresponding figures for a. actinomycetemcomitans were 8 and 19, respectively. a number of the investigated species (b. forsythus, t. denticola, p. intermedia, c rectus) reached high levels (> or =10(6) cells) in more than 1/2 of the patients. on the other hand, bacteria such as a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis were infrequently encountered  at high levels in these subgingival samples. in conclusion, the analysis failed to demonstrate a pls-specific profile of the subgingival infection, since the bacterial composition of the sampled sites closely resembled that characterising  deep pockets in adult periodontitis patients.

TI  == characterization of a novel n-acetylneuraminic acid-specific fusobacterium nucleatum pk1594 adhesin.
AB  == fusobacterium nucleatum has been identified as significantly associated with sites with active periodontal disease and, as a group, the oral fusobacteria coaggregate with members of all oral bacteria genera tested. monoclonal antibodies were prepared and used in conjunction with other potential inhibitors, such as simple sugars and amino acids, to characterize coaggregation interactions, of f. nucleatum pk1594. four unique monoclonal antibodies, 5h11, 14c7, 19f2 and 29c12, were obtained by their ability to inhibit coaggregation of  f. nucleatum pk1594 with actinomyces israelii pk16. they were also capable of inhibiting other coaggregations including streptococcus oralis h1, s. oralis j22, capnocytophaga ochracea atcc33596, prevotella denticola pk1277 and prevotella intermedia pk1511. all of these interactions were completely inhibited by n-acetylneuraminic acid. neither n-acetylneuraminic acid nor monoclonal antibody  5h11 had any inhibitory effect on other f. nucleatum pk1594 interactions, including all galactose-inhibitable coaggregations. the results indicate that f.  nucleatum pk1594 expresses upon its surface a distinct type of adhesin that mediates coaggregation interactions that are inhibited by n-acetylneuraminic acid.

TI  == microbial complexes in subgingival plaque.
AB  == it has been recognized for some time that bacterial species exist in complexes in subgingival plaque. the purpose of the present investigation was to attempt to define such communities using data from large numbers of plaque samples and different clustering and ordination techniques. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in 185 subjects (mean age 51 +/- 16 years) with (n = 160) or without (n = 25) periodontitis. the presence and levels  of 40 subgingival taxa were determined in 13,261 plaque samples using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. clinical assessments were made at 6 sites per tooth at each visit. similarities between pairs of species were computed using phi coefficients and species clustered using an averaged unweighted linkage sort. community ordination was performed using principal components analysis and correspondence analysis. 5 major complexes were consistently observed using any of the analytical methods. one complex consisted  of the tightly related group: bacteroides forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola. the 2nd complex consisted of a tightly related core group including members of the fusobacterium nucleatum/periodonticum subspecies, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and peptostreptococcus micros. species associated with this group included: eubacterium nodatum, campylobacter rectus, campylobacter showae, streptococcus constellatus and campylobacter gracilis. the 3rd complex consisted of streptococcus sanguis, s. oralis, s. mitis, s. gordonii and s. intermedius. the 4th complex was comprised of 3 capnocytophaga species, campylobacter concisus, eikenella corrodens and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans serotype a. the 5th complex consisted of veillonella parvula and actinomyces odontolyticus. a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b, selenomonas noxia and actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2 (a. viscosus) were outliers with little relation to each other and the 5 major complexes. the 1st complex related strikingly to clinical measures of periodontal disease particularly pocket depth and bleeding on probing.

TI  == clinical and microbiological features of refractory periodontitis subjects.
AB  == the purpose of this investigation was to compare the clinical parameters and the  site prevalence and levels of 40 subgingival species in successfully treated and  refractory periodontitis subjects. 94 subjects received scaling and root planing  and if needed, periodontal surgery and systemically administered tetracycline. 28 refractory subjects showed mean full mouth attachment loss and/or > 3 sites showing attachment loss > 2.5 mm within 1 year post-therapy. 66 successfully treated subjects showed mean attachment level gain and no sites with attachment loss > 2.5 mm. baseline subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth and the presence and levels of 40 subgingival taxa were determined using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. the mean levels and % of sites colonized by each species (prevalence) was computed for each subject and differences between groups sought using the mann-whitney test. most of the 40 species tested, including actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola and bacteroides forsythus, were equally or less prevalent in the refractory group. prevotella nigrescens was significantly more prevalent in successfully treated subjects, while refractory subjects harbored a larger proportion of streptococcus species, particularly streptococcus constellatus. the odds of a subject being refractory was 8.6 (p < 0.001) if s. constellatus constituted > or = 3.5% of the  total dna probe count. since few microbiological differences existed between treatment outcome groups using dna probes to known species, the predominant cultivable microbiota of 33 subgingival samples from 14 refractory subjects was examined. 85% of the 1649 isolates were identified using probes to 69 recognized  subgingival species. the remaining unidentified strains were classified by analyzing 16s rrna gene sequences. many sequenced isolates were of taxa not considered a common part of the oral microbiota such as acinetobacter baumanni, gemella haemolysans, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus warneri, pseudomonas aeruginosa and novel species in the genera bartonella, ralstonia, neisseria, eubacterium, rothia, gordona, gemella, corynebacterium, leptotrichia, and actinomyces. refractory subjects constituted a heterogeneous group based on their subgingival microbiota. as a group, they did not harbor more of the "classic" periodontopathogens, although elevated proportions of s. constellatus were found.

AB  == this study examined the effect of oral food consumption on the prevalence and levels of subgingival bacteria and yeasts in 20 gastrostomy tube-fed children and 24 healthy controls. microbial identification was carried out using anaerobic culture and 16s rrna-based pcr identification methods. streptococcal and actinomyces species were recovered from 100% and 76% of all subjects and averaged 66% and 11% of total cultivable organisms, respectively. in decreasing order of prevalence, fusobacterium, enteric rods, prevotella intermedia/prevotella nigrescens, capnocytophaga, propionibacterium, yeasts, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, coagulase-negative staphylococcus, campylobacter rectus, bacteroides forsythus, and porphyromonas gingivalis were detected in 48% to 2% of the study subjects. the cultivable levels of these species varied widely among subjects. pcr detection showed c. rectus and eikenella corrodens both to occur in 93% of the study subjects and to be the most prevalent putative periodontal pathogens examined. in decreasing order of prevalence, pcr identified treponema denticola, a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. nigrescens, p. intermedia, b. forsythus,  and p. gingivalis in 38% to 21% of the subjects studied. tube-fed children and healthy controls exhibited similar subgingival microbial compositions. it appears from this study that oral food consumption is not a major determinant for the establishment of subgingival microbiota in children.

TI  == the relationship between gingivitis and the serum antibodies to the microbiota associated with periodontal disease in children with down's syndrome.
AB  == gingival inflammation in down's syndrome children (ds) develops earlier and is more rapid and extensive than in non-ds children. abnormalities in host response  to the oral flora have been proposed as etiological factors of this gingival inflammation. however, the relationship between gingivitis and the host response  to oral microorganisms in ds by age has not been determined. the objective of this study was to clarify this relationship. sera were obtained from 75 ds subjects (aged 2 to 18 years) and their gingival health assessed using a modified pma index (m-pma). antibody titers to porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), prevotella intermedia (pi), treponema denticola (td), fusobacterium nucleatum (fn), selenomonas sputigena (sel), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), and streptococcus mitis (mi) were determined using the micro-elisa. ds subjects under 4 years old were found to have significantly more gingival inflammation than did  normal children the same age. a significant positive correlation (r = 0.548, p <  0.0001) existed in the relationship between m-pma score and plaque score for subjects in the g1 age group (deciduous dentition). at g1, the average antibody titers to aa, mi, and fn exceeded those of the normal adult reference serum pool. in addition, igg antibody titers to pg, aa, fn, sel, and mi correlated significantly with the m-pma scores in the g1 age group. there was a correlation  between age (2 to 18 years) and these antibody titers. igg antibody titers to pg, aa, sel, and mi increased significantly with increasing m-pma score. furthermore, the igg antibody titers to pg were higher (p < 0.05) in the most extensive disease group compared to the ds no-disease group. the igg antibody titers to pg  at g3 (early puberty) were significantly higher when compared to g1 (preschool children). the igm antibody titers to aa at g3 were higher (p < 0.05) when compared to g1. this study suggests that colonization by aa and fn are closely associated with the onset of gingival inflammation in ds patients under 5 years old. colonization by pg, aa, sel, and mi in ds appears to be associated with gingivitis at puberty.

TI  == bacterial adherence to guided tissue regeneration barrier membranes exposed to the oral environment.
AB  == microbial colonization of barrier materials used in guided tissue regeneration (gtr) is known to adversely affect treatment outcomes. the purpose of this study  was to compare the rate at which 11 commonly-occurring oral bacteria species colonize three different barrier materials (collagen, expanded polytetrafluoroethylene, and polylactic acid). the study group consisted of 10 systemically healthy individuals with no history of periodontal disease and absence of antimicrobial therapy within the previous 3 months. in each patient, 4 teeth per quadrant (p1, p2, m1, m2) were selected and 3 teeth were randomly assigned as test teeth while the remaining tooth acted as a control site (i.e., natural colonization of the tooth surface). these teeth were then randomly assigned to receive one of the three barrier types (i.e., each patient received 4 barriers of each type, 1 per quadrant). a 2 x 5 mm piece of barrier material was  positioned over the oral surface of the buccal marginal gingiva and secured with  an external sling suture. with oral hygiene procedures suspended, one barrier of  each type was collected at 1, 3, 7, and 14 days. slot immunoblot assay demonstrated that all species types (a. actinomycetemcomitans, a. viscosus, b. melaninogenicus, f. nucleatum, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, s. mutans, s. sanguis, selenomonas sputigena, t. denticola, and t. vincentii) were present. semi-quantitative scoring (scale 0 to 3) of slot blot results and analysis by chi-square ratio and pearson correlation test indicated that while total bacteria adherence increased over time (p < 0.05), the 3 barrier types and the control sites did not differ in numbers or species of colonizing bacteria detected per time point. these results suggest that under these experimental conditions the barrier materials tested do not differ in bacteria adherence or antimicrobial properties.

TI  == bacteriologic findings in tonsillitis and pericoronitis.
AB  == bacteriologic samples from 31 young men were cultured quantitatively for aerobes  and anaerobes; these samples included 31 specimens of tonsils (16 infected and 15 healthy), 16 specimens from pericoronal pockets of lower third molars (11 infected and 5 symptom-free), and 6 postoperative specimens from lower-third-molar extraction sockets. anaerobes were isolated more often from infected third molars than from infected tonsils (14.5 isolates vs. 8.4 isolates, respectively; p < .001). infected tonsil samples contained significantly more anaerobic species if an adjacent partly erupted lower third molar was present rather than absent (10.3 isolates vs. 6.9 isolates, respectively; p < .05). eubacterium aerofaciens, clostridium species, peptostreptococcus micros, and prevotella oris were frequently isolated. streptococcus salivarius was found more frequently in tonsillar specimens, whereas corynebacterium species, prevotella denticola, capnocytophaga species, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and lactobacillus species were more common in pericoronal pocket samples. thus, partial eruption of lower third molars increases the number of anaerobic bacterial species on tonsils and many species can be isolated simultaneously from both tonsils and lower third molars.

TI  == phototoxicity of argon laser irradiation on biofilms of porphyromonas and prevotella species.
AB  == species of prevotella (pr.) and porphyromonas (po.) and other microorganisms were cultivated as biofilms on agar medium and examined for their susceptibility to argon laser irradiation (continuous mode; wavelengths, 488-514 nm; fluences, 20-200 j cm(-2)). fluences of 35 to 80 j cm(-2) inhibited biofilm growth in po. endodontalis, po. gingivalis, pr. denticola, pr. intermedia, pr. melaninogenica and pr. nigrescens. a fluence of 70 j cm(-2) did not affect biofilm growth in species of bacillus, candida, enterobacter, proteus, pseudomonas, staphylococcus  and streptococcus. the phototoxic effects of argon laser irradiation against prevotella and porphyromonas species were: (1) caused by the radiation alone; (2) modified by biofilm age; (3) dependent on the presence of atmospheric oxygen; (4) influenced by medium supplements of hemin, hemoglobin and blood; (5) greater when compared with other microbial species; (6) demonstrated without augmentation with an exogenous photosensitizer; and (7) apparently unrelated to the protoporphyrin  content of the cells. overall, these in vitro findings suggest that low doses of  argon laser radiation may be effective in the treatment and/or prevention of clinical infections caused by biofilm-associated species of prevotella or porphyromonas.

AB  == this study was designed to isolate oral bacteria exhibiting antagonism towards treponema denticola and to characterize the inhibitory activity. eleven bacterial isolates obtained from subgingival sites and identified as either staphylococcus  aureus or streptococcus mutans were found to inhibit the growth of t. denticola.  when the activity spectra of these isolates were analyzed, two additional periodontopathogens (porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia) were found to be affected, whereas most gram-positive bacteria were not. strains of s. aureus produce a bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance (heat stable and protease  sensitive), whereas the inhibitory effect of s. mutans appears to be related to the production of lactic acid. the negative interactions reported in this paper may govern population shifts observed in subgingival sites.

TI  == characterization of inhibitory effects of suspected periodontopathogens on osteogenesis in vitro.
AB  == by using an in vitro bone-forming culture system, the chick periosteal osteogenesis (cpo) model, the direct effects on osteogenesis of sonicated extracts derived from oral bacteria were examined. both extracts from bacterial species having strong associations with periodontal diseases (porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and prevotella intermedia, hereinafter referred to as suspected periodontopathogens) and extracts from species not correlated with periodontal disease (streptococcus sanguis, veillonella atypica, and prevotella denticola, hereinafter referred to as nonpathogenic bacteria) were tested. all bacterial cultures were grown under standard anaerobic culture conditions. sonicated bacterial extracts were prepared from the bacterial pellet. these were added in various proportions to the cpo cultures. parameters of osteogenesis, including alkaline phosphatase activity, calcium and p(i) accumulation, and collagen synthesis, were measured in 6-day-old cultures. compared with controls grown in the absence of bacterial products, osteogenesis was inhibited significantly in cultures treated with extracts derived from the suspected periodontopathogens. no osteogenic inhibition was observed in cultures treated with extracts from the nonpathogenic bacteria. these results suggest that the ability to inhibit osteogenesis in vitro may be a pathogenic property shared by a limited group of species. further characterization of the p. gingivalis extracts revealed that both proteinaceous and nonproteinaceous products, including lipopolysaccharide, were able to inhibit osteogenesis. p. gingivalis extract-mediated inhibition of osteogenesis in cpo cultures was blocked by indomethacin, implicating prostaglandins in the regulation of the bacterial effects. the bacterial extracts had either reversible or irreversible inhibitory effects on osteogenesis when added after differentiation or before/during differentiation of bone cells, respectively.

TI  == effect of proteolytic enzymes on the lysis and growth of oral bacteria.
AB  == previous studies have shown increased levels of proteolytic enzymes in affected periodontal sites. the aim of the present investigation was to evaluate the effect of proteolytic environments on the lysis and growth of selected oral bacteria associated with either healthy or diseased periodontal sites. the effect of trypsin, chymotrypsin and proteinase k on cell lysis was determined following  incubation with bacteria, whereas the effect of the same proteolytic enzymes on bacterial growth was tested using a disc-plate technique. overall, gram-positive  bacteria appeared to be more resistant to lysis than gram-negative bacteria. the  most susceptible bacteria were actinomyces spp., eubacterium saburreum, prevotella intermedia, capnocytophaga ochracea, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella loescheii, treponema denticola and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. the disc-plate procedure indicated that the growth of actinomyces spp., e. saburreum, c. ochracea, p. intermedia, p. loescheii, porphyromonas gingivalis and t. denticola were the most affected, more particularly by chymotrypsin and proteinase k. interestingly, the growth of f. nucleatum was rather stimulated by proteolytic enzymes. the observations reported in this investigation indicate that specific and general proteolytic activities have the ability to lyse some oral bacterial species and to interfere with their  growth. it is suggested that such effects could represent new mechanisms by which the bacterial ecology of subgingival sites may be affected.

TI  == characterization of hemolytic bacteria in subgingival plaque.
AB  == three-quarters of the patients with periodontal diseases surveyed in this study had one or more distinct types of hemolytic bacteria in their subgingival plaque. twelve different species of bacteria were identified, belonging to five genera (actinomyces, streptococcus, staphylococcus, prevotella, and actinobacillus). nine hemolytic isolates, consisting of four prevotella denticola strains, two actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2 strains, and one each of p. melaninogenica,  streptococcus constellatus, and a. naeslundii genospecies 1 strains were characterized. incorporation of pronase into blood agar medium inhibited hemolysis by all of the isolates, suggesting a proteinaceous component for each of their hemolysins. with one exception, hemolysin production appeared to be regulated by the concentration of environmental iron: exogenous hemin was found to inhibit hemolysin production, and the iron scavenging compound, 2,2'- dipyridyl, was found to promote hemolysin production by all of the strains except for the s. constellatus isolate. genomic libraries of each of the hemolytic plaque isolates were prepared in escherichia coli using pbr322. hemolytic clones  were isolated on blood agar medium containing ampicillin at frequencies ranging from 1-6.7 x 10(-4). extensive restriction mapping revealed regions of homology in the case of clones derived from three p. denticola strains isolated from the same subjects. two of the p. denticola-derived clones were virtually identical throughout the entrety of their > 5 kb inserts. the clone derived from the third  strain showed good homology to the other two within a 1.3 kb region, but the flanking dna showed no homology even though all three p. denticola isolates were  shown to be clonally related by ribotyping.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == black-pigmented gram-negative anaerobes in endodontic infections.
AB  == necrotic dental root canal infections are polymicrobial infections dominated by anaerobic bacteria. the number of different species in one canal is usually low,  approx. 4-7 species. the species isolated most frequently belong to the genera prevotella, porphyromonas, fusobacterium, peptostreptococcus, eubacterium and streptococcus. the frequency of isolation of black-pigmented gram-negative anaerobes in endodontic infections varies from 25% to > 50%. pr. intermedia is the most commonly found pigmented species, followed by pr. denticola and two porphyromonas species, p. gingivalis and p. endodontalis. several studies have shown that p. gingivalis and p. endodontalis are closely related to the presence  of acute symptoms in endodontic infections, whereas other black-pigmented gram-negative anaerobes are not. however, several other species may also be involved in acute infections. moreover, porphyromonas species have occasionally been isolated from cases with no symptoms. although porphyromonas spp. are clearly related to symptoms at the beginning of therapy, they are not important for the prognosis of the treatment.

TI  == identification of proteases from periodontopathogenic bacteria as activators of latent human neutrophil and fibroblast-type interstitial collagenases.
AB  == activation of latent human fibroblast-type and neutrophil interstitial procollagenases as well as degradation of native type i collagen by supra- and subgingival dental plaque extracts, an 80-kda trypsinlike protease from porphyromas gingivalis (atcc 33277), a 95-kda chymotrypsinlike protease from treponema denticola (atcc 29522), and selected bacterial species commonly isolated in periodontitis was studied. the bacteria included were prevotella intermedia (atcc 25261), prevotella buccae (es 57), prevotella oris (atcc 33573), porphyromonas endodontalis (es 54b), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (atcc 295222), fusobacterium nucleatum (atcc 10953), mitsuokella dentalis (dsm 3688), and streptococcus mitis (atcc 15909). none of the bacteria activated latent procollagenases; however, both sub- and supragingival dental plaque extracts (neutral salt extraction) and proteases isolated from cell extracts from potentially periodontopathogenic bacteria p. gingivalis and t. denticola were found to activate latent human fibroblast-type and neutrophil interstitial procollagenases. the fibroblast-type interstitial collagenase was more efficiently activated by bacterial proteases than the neutrophil counterpart, which instead preferred nonproteolytic activation by the oxidative agent hypochlorous acid. the proteases were not able to convert collagenase tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (timp-1) complexes into active form or to change the ability of timp-1 to inhibit interstitial collagenase. none of the studied bacteria, proteases from p. gingivalis and t. denticola, or extracts of supra- and subgingival dental plaque showed any significant collagenolytic activity. however, the proteases degraded native and denatured collagen fragments after cleavage by interstitial collagenase and gelatinase. our results indicate that proteases from periodontopathogenic bacteria can act as direct proteolytic activators of human procollagenases and degrade collagen fragments. thus, in concert with host enzymes the bacterial proteases may participate in periodontal  tissue destruction.
