TI  == subgingival microbial profiles of generalized aggressive and chronic periodontal  diseases.
AB  == objective: the aim of this study was to distinguish between generalized aggressive (gagp) and chronic periodontitis (cp) based on the subgingival microbial profiles predominant in these diseases. methods: two-hundred and sixty  subjects, 75 with gagp and 185 with cp were recruited. full-mouth clinical measurements were recorded. individual subgingival plaque samples were taken from 7 sites per subject and analyzed for the prevalence and levels of 51 species by chequerboard. differences between groups were examined by the mann-whitney test.  associations between bacterial species and gagp were examined by logistic regression analysis. results: actinomyces gerensceriae, actinomyces israelli, eubacterium nodatum and propionibacterium acnes were detected in significantly greater counts in gagp, whereas capnocytophaga ochracea, fusobacterium periodonticum, staphylococcus aureus and veillonella parvula were more predominant in cp patients (adjusted p < 0.001). e. nodatum (at mean levels >/=4  x 10(5)) increased significantly the probability of a subject being diagnosed with gagp than cp (or 2.44 [0.96-6.20]), whereas p. gingivalis (or 0.34 [0.11-0.93]) and t. denticola (or 0.35 [0.11-0.94]) were associated with cp. conclusions: very few subgingival species differed in prevalence and/or levels between gagp and cp in this sample population. in particular, e. nodatum was strongly related to gagp, whereas p. gingivalis and t. denticola were associated  with cp.

TI  == salivary microbiota of hiv-positive children and its correlation with hiv status, oral diseases, and total secretory iga.
AB  == aim: this study aimed to investigate the prevalence and levels of salivary microorganisms in hiv-positive children, and their correlation to hiv status, oral lesions, and salivary iga levels. design: forty-two hiv-positive and 36 control children were clinically examined, had their saliva collected and processed for the microbiological analysis of 38 bacterial taxa by the checkerboard method, and salivary iga quantification by elisa. results: the majority of the species tested were more prevalent in control children than in the hiv group. mean concentration of total salivary iga was similar in both groups. high levels of veillonella parvula were found in children with cheilitis  and herpes. tannerella forsythia, eikenella corrodens, and propionibacterium acnes were prevalent in children with gingivitis, while fusobacterium periodonticum, streptococcus gordonii, and streptococcus oralis were significantly more frequent in children with no oral lesions. significant negative correlations between salivary iga levels and eubacterium nodatum and oral streptococci were observed (p < 0.05). conclusion: hiv-seropositive children presented significantly lower prevalence and levels of several bacterial species  in saliva; hiv-positive children are able to mount a mucosal immune response; hiv-seropositive children under highly active antiretroviral therapy presented low prevalence of oral lesions.
