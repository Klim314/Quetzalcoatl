TI  == porphyromonas gingivalis outer membrane vesicles mediate coaggregation and piggybacking of treponema denticola and lachnoanaerobaculum saburreum.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis sheds outer membrane vesicles that contain several virulence factors, including adhesins. in this study, we investigated the ability of p. gingivalis outer membrane vesicles to mediate the coaggregation and piggybacking of treponema denticola and lachnoanaerobaculum saburreum. marked coaggregation between t. denticola and l. saburreum occurred in the presence of p. gingivalis outer membrane vesicles. sucrose was an effective chemoattractant for the motile species t. denticola. the addition of outer membrane vesicles to a mixture of t. denticola and l. saburreum significantly increased the number of nonmotile bacteria that migrated into a sucrose-filled capillary tube immersed in the bacterial mixture. under optimal conditions, the number of nonmotile l. saburreum in the capillary tube increased approximately 5-fold, whereas no increase occurred when boiled vesicles were used. this study showed that p. gingivalis outer membrane vesicles mediate coaggregation between t. denticola and l. saburreum and that nonmotile bacteria can be translocated by piggybacking on spirochetes.
