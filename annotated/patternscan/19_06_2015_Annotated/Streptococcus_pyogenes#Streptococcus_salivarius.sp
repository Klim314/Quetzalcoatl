TI  == transduction of the streptococcus pyogenes bacteriophage phim46.1, carrying resistance genes mef(a) and tet(o), to other streptococcus species.
AB  == phim46.1 - streptococcus pyogenes bacteriophage carrying mef(a) and tet(o), respectively, encoding resistance to macrolides (m phenotype) and tetracycline -  is widespread in s. pyogenes but has not been reported outside this species. phim46.1 is transferable in vitro among s. pyogenes isolates, but no information  is available about its transferability to other streptococcus species. we thus investigated phim46.1 for its ability to be transduced in vitro to recipients of  different streptococcus species. transductants were obtained from recipients of streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus gordonii, and streptococcus suis. retransfer was always achieved, and from s. suis to s. pyogenes occurred at a much greater frequency than in the opposite direction. in transductants phim46.1  retained its functional properties, such as inducibility with mitomycin c, presence both as a prophage and as a free circular form, and transferability. the transductants shared the same phim46.1 chromosomal integration site as the donor, at the 3' end of a conserved rna uracil methyltransferase (rum) gene, which is an integration hotspot for a variety of genetic elements. no transfer occurred to recipients of streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus oralis, and streptococcus salivarius, even though rum-like genes were also detected in the sequenced genomes of these species. a largely overlapping 18-bp critical sequence, where the site-specific recombination process presumably takes place, was identified in the rum genes of all recipients, including those of the species yielding no transductants. growth assays to evaluate the fitness cost of phim46.1 acquisition disclosed a negligible impact on s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, and s. gordonii transductants and a noticeable fitness advantage in s. suis. the s. suis transductant also displayed marked overexpression of the autolysin-encoding gene  atl.

TI  == use of streptococcus salivarius k12 in the prevention of streptococcal and viral  pharyngotonsillitis in children.
AB  == background: streptococcus salivarius k12 is an oral probiotic strain releasing two lantibiotics (salivaricin a2 and salivaricin b) that antagonize the growth of s. pyogenes, the most important bacterial cause of pharyngeal infections in humans also affected by episodes of acute otitis media. s. salivarius k12 successfully colonizes the oral cavity, and is endowed with an excellent safety profile. we tested its preventive role in reducing the incidence of both streptococcal and viral pharyngitis and/or tonsillitis in children. materials and methods: we enrolled 61 children with a diagnosis of recurrent oral streptococcal disorders. thirty-one of them were enrolled to be treated daily for 90 days with  a slow-release tablet for oral use, containing no less than 1 billion colony-forming units/tablet of s. salivarius k12 (bactoblis(r)), and the remaining 30 served as the untreated control group. during treatment, they were all examined for streptococcal infection. twenty children (ten per group) were also assessed in terms of viral infection. secondary end points in both groups were the number of days under antibiotic and antipyretic therapy and the number of days off school (children) and off work (parents). results: the 30 children who completed the 90-day trial with bactoblis(r) showed a significant reduction in their episodes of streptococcal pharyngeal infection (>90%), as calculated by  comparing the infection rates of the previous year. no difference was observed in the control group. the treated group showed a significant decrease in the incidence (80%) of oral viral infections. again, there was no difference in the control group. with regard to secondary end points, the number of days under antibiotic treatment of the treated and control groups were 30 and 900 respectively, days under antipyretic treatment 16 and 228, days of absence from school 16 and 228, and days of absence from work 16 and 228. the product was well tolerated by the subjects, with no side effects, and only one individual reported bad product palatability and dropped out. conclusion: prophylactic administration of s. salivarius k12 to children with a history of recurrent oral streptococcal disease resulted in a considerable reduction of episodes of both streptococcal and viral infections and reduced the number of days under antibiotic and/or antipyretic therapy and days of absence from school or work.

TI  == persistence of the oral probiotic streptococcus salivarius m18 is dose dependent  and megaplasmid transfer can augment their bacteriocin production and adhesion characteristics.
AB  == bacteriocin-producing probiotic streptococcus salivarius m18 offers beneficial modulatory capabilities within the oral microbiome, apparently through potent inhibitory activity against potentially deleterious bacteria, such as streptococcus pyogenes. the oral cavity persistence of s. salivarius m18 was investigated in 75 subjects receiving four different doses for 28 days. sixty per cent of the subjects already had some inhibitor-producing s. salivarius in their  saliva prior to probiotic intervention. strain m18's persistence was dependent upon the dose, but not the period of administration. culture analysis indicated that in some individuals the introduced strain had almost entirely replaced the indigenous s. salivarius, though the total numbers of the species did not increase. selected subjects showing either high or low probiotic persistence had  their salivary populations profiled using illumina sequencing of the v6 region of the 16s rrna gene. analysis indicated that while certain bacterial phenotypes were markedly modulated, the overall composition of the oral microbiome was not modified by the probiotic treatment. megaplasmids encoding bacteriocins and adhesion factors were transferred in vitro to generate a transconjugant s. salivarius exhibiting enhanced antimicrobial production and binding capabilities  to hep-2 cells. since no widespread perturbation of the existing indigenous microbiota was associated with oral instillation and given its antimicrobial activity against potentially pathogenic streptococci, it appears that application of probiotic strain m18 offers potential low impact alternative to classical antibiotic prophylaxis. for candidate probiotic strains having relatively poor antimicrobial or adhesive properties, unique derivatives displaying improved probiotic performance may be engineered in vitro by megaplasmid transfer.

TI  == endocarditis in adults with bacterial meningitis.
AB  == background: endocarditis may precede or complicate bacterial meningitis, but the  incidence and impact of endocarditis in bacterial meningitis are unknown. methods and results: we assessed the incidence and clinical characteristics of patients with meningitis and endocarditis from a nationwide cohort study of adults with community-acquired bacterial meningitis in the netherlands from 2006 to 2012. endocarditis was identified in 24 of 1025 episodes (2%) of bacterial meningitis.  cultures yielded streptococcus pneumoniae in 13 patients, staphylococcus aureus in 8 patients, and streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus salivarius in 1 patient each. clues leading to the diagnosis of endocarditis were cardiac murmurs, persistent or recurrent fever, a history of heart valve disease, and s aureus as the causative pathogen of bacterial meningitis. treatment consisted of prolonged antibiotic therapy in all patients and surgical valve replacement in 10 patients (42%). two patients were treated with oral anticoagulants, and both developed life-threatening intracerebral hemorrhage. systemic (70%) and neurological (54%) complications occurred frequently, leading to a high proportion of patients with unfavorable outcome (63%). seven of 24 patients (29%) with meningitis and endocarditis died. conclusions: endocarditis is an uncommon coexisting condition in bacterial meningitis but is associated with a high rate of unfavorable outcome.

TI  == clinical evaluation of the oral probiotic streptococcus salivarius k12 in the prevention of recurrent pharyngitis and/or tonsillitis caused by streptococcus pyogenes in adults.
AB  == background: streptococcus salivarius k12 has been shown to inhibit the growth of  streptococcus pyogenes due to bacteriocins release. because of its ability to colonize the oral cavity, we have tested the strain k12 for its efficacy in preventing streptococcal pharyngitis and/or tonsillitis in adults. methods: forty adults with a diagnosis of recurrent oral streptococcal pharyngitis were enrolled in the study. twenty of these subjects took for 90 days a tablet containing streptococcus salivarius k12 (bactoblis(r)). the other 20 subjects served as untreated controls. a 6-month follow-up was included to evaluate any persistent protective role. results: the 20 adults who completed the 90-day course of bactoblis(r) showed a reduction in their episodes of streptococcal pharyngeal infection (about 80%). the 90 days treatment was also associated with an approximately 60% reduction in the incidence of reported pharyngitis in the 6-month period following use of the product. the product was well tolerated by the subjects with no treatment-related side effects or drop-outs reported. conclusion: prophylactic administration of streptococcus salivarius k12 to adults having a history of recurrent oral streptococcal pathology reduced the number of  episodes of streptococcal pharyngeal infections and/or tonsillitis.

TI  == protective mechanisms of respiratory tract streptococci against streptococcus pyogenes biofilm formation and epithelial cell infection.
AB  == streptococcus pyogenes (group a streptococci [gas]) encounter many streptococcal  species of the physiological microbial biome when entering the upper respiratory  tract of humans, leading to the question how gas interact with these bacteria in  order to establish themselves at this anatomic site and initiate infection. here  we show that s. oralis and s. salivarius in direct contact assays inhibit growth  of gas in a strain-specific manner and that s. salivarius, most likely via bacteriocin secretion, also exerts this effect in transwell experiments. utilizing scanning electron microscopy documentation, we identified the tested strains as potent biofilm producers except for gas m49. in mixed-species biofilms, s. salivarius dominated the gas strains, while s. oralis acted as initial colonizer, building the bottom layer in mixed biofilms and thereby allowing even gas m49 to form substantial biofilms on top. with the exception of  s. oralis, artificial saliva reduced single-species biofilms and allowed gas to dominate in mixed biofilms, although the overall two-layer structure was unchanged. when covered by s. oralis and s. salivarius biofilms, epithelial cells were protected from gas adherence, internalization, and cytotoxic effects. apparently, these species can have probiotic effects. the use of affymetrix array technology to assess hep-2 cell transcription levels revealed modest changes after exposure to s. oralis and s. salivarius biofilms which could explain some of the protective effects against gas attack. in summary, our study revealed a protection effect of respiratory tract bacteria against an important airway pathogen and allowed a first in vitro insight into local environmental processes  after gas enter the respiratory tract.

TI  == preliminary pediatric clinical evaluation of the oral probiotic streptococcus salivarius k12 in preventing recurrent pharyngitis and/or tonsillitis caused by streptococcus pyogenes and recurrent acute otitis media.
AB  == background: the oral probiotic streptococcus salivarius k12 has been shown clearly to antagonize the growth of streptococcus pyogenes, the most important bacterial cause of pharyngeal infections in humans, by releasing two bacteriocins named salivaricin a2 and salivaricin b. unpublished observations indicate that it can also antagonize the growth of other bacteria involved in acute otitis media.  because of its ability to colonize the oral cavity and its safety profile, we have tested its efficacy in reducing the incidence of streptococcal pharyngitis and/or tonsillitis and episodes of acute otitis media. methods: we enrolled 82 children, including 65 with and 17 without a recent diagnosis of recurrent oral streptococcal pathology. of those with recurrent pathology, 45 were treated daily for 90 days with an oral slow-release tablet containing five billion colony-forming units of s. salivarius k12 (bactoblis((r))), and the remaining 20  served as an untreated control group. the 17 children without a recent diagnosis  of recurrent oral pathology were used as an additional control group. after 90 days of treatment, a 6-month follow-up period without treatment was included to evaluate a possible persistent protective role for the previously administered product. results: the 41 children who completed the 90-day course of bactoblis showed a reduction in their episodes of streptococcal pharyngeal infection (about 90%) and/or acute otitis media (about 40%), calculated by comparing infection rates in the previous year. the 90-day treatment also reduced the reported incidence of pharyngeal and ear infections by about 65% in the 6-month follow-up  period during which the product was not administered. subjects tolerated the product well, with no side effects or dropouts reported. conclusion: prophylactic administration of s. salivarius k12 to children with a history of recurrent oral  streptococcal pathology reduced episodes of streptococcal pharyngeal infections and/or tonsillitis as well as episodes of acute otitis media.

TI  == developing oral probiotics from streptococcus salivarius.
AB  == considerable human illness can be linked to the development of oral microbiota disequilibria. the predominant oral cavity commensal, streptococcus salivarius has emerged as an important source of safe and efficacious probiotics, capable of fostering more balanced, health-associated oral microbiota. strain k12, the prototype s. salivarius probiotic, originally introduced to counter streptococcus pyogenes infections, now has an expanded repertoire of health-promoting applications. k12 and several more recently proposed s. salivarius probiotics are now being applied to control diverse bacterial consortia infections including otitis media, halitosis and dental caries. other potential applications include upregulation of immunological defenses against respiratory viral infections and treatment of oral candidosis. an overview of the key steps required for probiotic development is also presented.

TI  == salivaricin g32, a homolog of the prototype streptococcus pyogenes nisin-like lantibiotic sa-ff22, produced by the commensal species streptococcus salivarius.
AB  == salivaricin g32, a 2667 da novel member of the sa-ff22 cluster of lantibiotics, has been purified and characterized from streptococcus salivarius strain g32. the inhibitory peptide differs from the streptococcus pyogenes-produced sa-ff22 in the absence of lysine in position 2. the salivaricin g32 locus was widely distributed in blis-producing s. salivarius, with 6 (23%) of 26 strains pcr-positive for the structural gene, slna. as for most other lantibiotics produced by s. salivarius, the salivaricin g32 locus can be megaplasmid encoded.  another member of the sa-ff22 family was detected in two streptococcus dysgalactiae of bovine origin, an observation supportive of widespread distribution of this lantibiotic within the genus streptococcus. since the inhibitory spectrum of salivaricin g32 includes streptococcus pyogenes, its production by s. salivarius, either as a member of the normal oral microflora or  as a commercial probiotic, could serve to enhance protection of the human host against s. pyogenes infection.

TI  == in vitro functional and immunomodulatory properties of the lactobacillus helveticus mimlh5-streptococcus salivarius st3 association that are relevant to the development of a pharyngeal probiotic product.
AB  == the use of proper bacterial strains as probiotics for the pharyngeal mucosa is a  potential prophylactic strategy for upper respiratory tract infections. in this context, we characterized in vitro the functional and immunomodulatory properties of the strains lactobacillus helveticus mimlh5 and streptococcus salivarius st3 that were selected during previous investigations as promising pharyngeal probiotics. in this study, we demonstrated in vitro that strains mimlh5 and st3,  alone and in combination, can efficiently adhere to pharyngeal epithelial cells,  antagonize streptococcus pyogenes, and modulate host innate immunity by inducing  potentially protective effects. in particular, we found that the strains mimlh5 and st3 activate u937 human macrophages by significantly inducing the expression  of the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha). nonetheless, the induction of the anti-inflammatory interleukin-10 (il-10) by mimlh5 or st3 was never lower than that of tnf-alpha, suggesting that these bacteria can potentially exert a regulatory rather than a proinflammatory effect. we also found that the strains mimlh5 and st3 induce cyclooxygenase 2 (cox-2) expression and demonstrated that toll-like receptor 2 (tlr-2) participates in the recognition of the strains mimlh5 and st3 by u937 cells. finally, we observed that these microorganisms grow efficiently when cocultured in milk, suggesting that the preparation of a milk-based fermented product containing both mimlh5 and st3 can be a practical solution for the administration of these bacteria. in conclusion, we propose the combined use of l. helveticus mimlh5 and s. salivarius st3 for the preparation of novel products that display probiotic properties for the pharyngeal mucosa.

TI  == salivaricin d, a novel intrinsically trypsin-resistant lantibiotic from streptococcus salivarius 5m6c isolated from a healthy infant.
AB  == in this work, we purified and characterized a newly identified lantibiotic (salivaricin d) from streptococcus salivarius 5m6c. salivaricin d is a 34-amino-acid-residue peptide (3,467.55 da); the locus of the gene encoding this  peptide is a 16.5-kb dna segment which contains genes encoding the precursor of two lantibiotics, two modification enzymes (dehydratase and cyclase), an abc transporter, a serine-like protease, immunity proteins (lipoprotein and abc transporters), a response regulator, and a sensor histidine kinase. the immunity  gene (sali) was heterologously expressed in a sensitive indicator and provided significant protection against salivaricin d, confirming its immunity function. salivaricin d is a naturally trypsin-resistant lantibiotic that is similar to nisin-like lantibiotics. it is a relatively broad-spectrum bacteriocin that inhibits members of many genera of gram-positive bacteria, including the important human pathogens streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae. thus, streptococcus salivarius 5m6c may be a potential biological agent for the control of oronasopharynx-colonizing streptococcal pathogens or may be used as a  probiotic bacterium.

TI  == comparative genomics and the role of lateral gene transfer in the evolution of bovine adapted streptococcus agalactiae.
AB  == in addition to causing severe invasive infections in humans, streptococcus agalactiae, or group b streptococcus (gbs), is also a major cause of bovine mastitis. here we provide the first genome sequence for s. agalactiae isolated from a cow diagnosed with clinical mastitis (strain fsl s3-026). comparison to eight s. agalactiae genomes obtained from human disease isolates revealed 183 genes specific to the bovine strain. subsequent polymerase chain reaction (pcr) screening for the presence/absence of a subset of these loci in additional bovine and human strains revealed strong differentiation between the two groups (fisher  exact test: p<0.0001). the majority of the bovine strain-specific genes ( approximately 85%) clustered tightly into eight genomic islands, suggesting these genes were acquired through lateral gene transfer (lgt). this bovine gbs also contained an unusually high proportion of insertion sequences (4.3% of the total  genome), suggesting frequent genomic rearrangement. comparison to other mastitis-causing species of bacteria provided strong evidence for two cases of interspecies lgt within the shared bovine environment: bovine s. agalactiae with  streptococcus uberis (nisin u operon) and streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae (lactose operon). we also found evidence for lgt, involving the salivaricin operon, between the bovine s. agalactiae strain and either streptococcus pyogenes or streptococcus salivarius. our findings provide insight  into mechanisms facilitating environmental adaptation and acquisition of potential virulence factors, while highlighting both the key role lgt has played  in the recent evolution of the bovine s. agalactiae strain, and the importance of lgt among pathogens within a shared environment.

TI  == salivaricin 9, a new lantibiotic produced by streptococcus salivarius.
AB  == salivaricin 9 (sal9) is a 2560 da lantibiotic having just 46 % amino acid identity with its closest known homologue, the streptococcus pyogenes lantibiotic sa-ff22. the sal9 locus (designated siv) in streptococcus salivarius strain 9 was partially sequenced and localized to an approximately 170 kb megaplasmid, which also harbours the locus for the lantibiotic salivaricin a4. the entire locus was  fully characterized in the draft genome sequence of s. salivarius strain jim8780  and shown to consist of eight genes, having the following putative functions: sivk, sensor kinase; sivr, response regulator; siva, sal9 precursor peptide; sivm, lantibiotic modification enzyme; sivt, abc transporter involved in the export of sal9 and concomitant cleavage of its leader peptide; and sivfeg, encoding lantibiotic self-immunity. intriguingly, in contrast to strain 9, the siv locus was chromosomally located in strain jim8780--the first lantibiotic locus shown not to be exclusively plasmid-associated in s. salivarius. sal9-containing extracts specifically induced lantibiotic production in both strain 9 and strain jim8780, indicating that sal9 functions as a signal peptide for upregulation of its own biosynthesis. screening representative strains of three streptococcal species (s. salivarius, s. pyogenes and s. mitis) for siva indicated that it was present only in s. salivarius, with 12 of 28 tested s. salivarius positive. since sal9 was inhibitory to all tested s. pyogenes strains  it appears to have potential as an important component of the bacteriocin armoury of s. salivarius probiotics intended to control s. pyogenes infections of the human oral cavity.

TI  == ozone in dentistry: microbiological effects of gas action depending on the method and the time of application using the ozonytron device. experimental study.
AB  == introduction: bactericidal, virucidal, and fungicidal activity of ozone is generally known and has been exploited for years in industry and medicine. ozone  therapy became an inherent element of the treatment of infection in such fields as surgery, dermatology, cosmetics, and dentistry. ozone is a gas, so it penetrates very well even into such tissues and spaces that are not easily accessible. thanks to the property of deep penetration and long ozone presence in tissues after treatment, a long-lasting bactericidal effect is achieved. the action of oxygen radicals is, however, not neutral for the human organism, therefore the use of an appropriate procedure and therapy algorithms is essential. material and methods: we decided to confirm the effect of antibacterial activity of ozone applied by means of the ozonytron device (made by biozonix) on model strains of streptococcus salivarius, pneumonia, pyogenes, and  agalactiae, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus and epidermidis, using two application patterns developed by us. results: we found a statistically significant difference in the size of zones of inhibited bacterial growth on all  media depending on the time of action of ozone. in the present paper, the bactericidal activity of ozone in relation to bacterial strains that are most frequently isolated from the oral cavity was confirmed. what is more, two models  of application of the gas on the infected medium were compared. conclusion: research on the use of ozone in combatting bacteria typical for dental diseases has shown that the gas has an oxidizing effect on these bacteria and is bactericidal.

TI  == oral bacteria as potential probiotics for the pharyngeal mucosa.
AB  == the research described here was aimed at the selection of oral bacteria that displayed properties compatible with their potential use as probiotics for the pharyngeal mucosa. we included in the study 56 bacteria newly isolated from the pharynges of healthy donors, which were identified at the intraspecies level and  characterized in vitro for their probiotic potential. the experiments led us to select two potential probiotic bacterial strains (streptococcus salivarius rs1 and st3) and to compare them with the prototype oral probiotic s. salivarius strain k12. all three strains efficiently bound to fadu human epithelial pharyngeal cells and thereby antagonized streptococcus pyogenes adhesion and growth. all were sensitive to a variety of antibiotics routinely used for the control of upper respiratory tract infections. immunological in vitro testing on  a fadu layer revealed different responses to rs1, st3, and k12. rs1 and st3 modulated nf-kappab activation and biased proinflammatory cytokines at baseline and after interleukin-1beta (il-1beta) induction. in conclusion, we suggest that  the selected commensal streptococci represent potential pharyngeal probiotic candidates. they could display a good degree of adaptation to the host and possess potential immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory properties.

TI  == partial recn gene sequencing: a new tool for identification and phylogeny within  the genus streptococcus.
AB  == partial sequences of the recn gene (1249 bp), which encodes a recombination and repair protein, were analysed to determine the phylogenetic relationship and identification of streptococci. the partial sequences presented interspecies nucleotide similarity of 56.4-98.2 % and intersubspecies similarity of 89.8-98 %. the mean dna sequence similarity of recn gene sequences (66.6 %) was found to be  lower than those of the 16s rrna gene (94.1 %), rpob (84.6 %), soda (74.8 %), groel (78.1 %) and gyrb (73.2 %). phylogenetically derived trees revealed six statistically supported groups: streptococcus salivarius, s. equinus, s. hyovaginalis/s. pluranimalium/s. thoraltensis, s. pyogenes, s. mutans and s. suis. the 'mitis' group was not supported by a significant bootstrap value, but three statistically supported subgroups were noted: streptococcus sanguinis/s. cristatus/s. sinensis, s. anginosus/s. intermedius/s. constellatus (the 'anginosus' subgroup) and s. mitis/s. infantis/s. peroris/s. oralis/s. oligofermentans/s. pneumoniae/s. pseudopneumoniae. the partial recn gene sequence comparison highlighted a high percentage of divergence between streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae and s. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis. this observation is confirmed by other gene sequence comparisons (groel, gyrb, rpob and soda). a high percentage of similarity was found between s. intermedius and s. constellatus after sequence comparison of the recn gene. to study the genetic  diversity among the 'anginosus' subgroup, recn, groel, soda, gyrb and rpob sequences were determined for 36 clinical isolates. the results that were obtained confirmed the high genetic diversity within this group of streptococci.

TI  == the streptococcal inhibitor of complement (sic) protects streptococcus pyogenes from bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance (blis) from streptococcus salivarius.
AB  == streptococcus salivarius inhibits the growth of streptococcus pyogenes in vitro.  streptococcus pyogenes has various virulence factors, including the streptococcus inhibitor of complement (sic). although sic inhibits the activity of the peptides ll-37 and nap1, the relationship between sic and the bacteriocin-like inhibitory  substance (blis) has not been elucidated. here, we evaluated whether s. salivarius blis affects s. pyogenes sic. we created three deltasic mutant strains from three s. pyogenes strains and performed deferred antagonism assays. the test strains were blis-positive s. salivarius jcm5707 and blis-negative s. salivarius  ncu12. deferred antagonism assays with jcm5707 showed that the inhibitory zones in the three deltasic mutant strains were wider than those in the three wild-type strains. streptococcus pyogenes was cultured in blis-containing broth and the change in sic in the supernatant was assessed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-de). the 2-de analysis of s. pyogenes exoproteins with the jcm5707 supernatant showed reduced sic compared with those without the jcm5707 supernatant. changes in sic mrna levels affected by s. salivarius blis were evaluated by a reverse transcriptase-pcr. the sic mrna level was affected more by the blis-positive s. salivarius than by the blis-negative strain. our result indicates that sic plays a role in the inhibition of s. salivarius blis.

TI  == analytical specificity and sensitivity of a real-time polymerase chain reaction assay for identification of bovine mastitis pathogens.
AB  == intramammary infection (imi), also known as mastitis, is the most frequently occurring and economically the most important infectious disease in dairy cattle. this study provides a validation of the analytical specificity and sensitivity of a real-time pcr-based assay that identifies 11 major pathogen species or species  groups responsible for imi, and a gene coding for staphylococcal beta-lactamase production (penicillin resistance). altogether, 643 culture isolates originating  from clinical bovine mastitis, human, and companion animal samples were analyzed  using the assay. the isolates represented 83 different species, groups, or families, and originated from 6 countries in europe and north america. the analytical specificity and sensitivity of the assay was 100% in bacterial and beta-lactamase identification across all isolates originating from bovine mastitis (n = 454). when considering the entire culture collection (including also the isolates originating from human and companion animal samples), 4 streptococcus pyogenes, 1 streptococcus salivarius, and 1 streptococcus sanguis strain of human origin were identified as streptococcus uberis, and 3 shigella spp. strains were identified as escherichia coli, decreasing specificity to 99% in strep. uberis and to 99.5% in e. coli. these false-positive results were confirmed by sequencing of the 16s rrna gene. specificity and sensitivity remained at 100% for all other bacterial targets across the entire culture collection. in conclusion, the real-time pcr assay shows excellent analytical accuracy and holds much promise for use in routine bovine imi testing programs. this study provides the basis for evaluating the assay's diagnostic performance against the conventional bacterial culture method in clinical field trials using  mastitis milk samples.

TI  == a quantitative approach to the effectiveness of ozone against microbiota organisms colonizing toothbrushes.
AB  == objectives: toothbrushes are rapidly contaminated with different microorganisms,  which colonize the oral cavity and interdental spaces. this can represent a possible cause of infection or reinfection. in this study, the ozone experimental effect upon toothbrushes microflora was estimated microbiologically before and after saturation with ozone gas. methods: fifty used toothbrushes coming from children and adults were entered our study. microorganisms were enumerated and identified. bristles from each brush were soaked in ozone saturated pbs solution  for 5, 10, 15, 20 and 30 min and the total microbial population was reassessed. results: counts of microorganisms isolated per brush varied between 10(2) and 10(7) cfu. candida albicans was present in used toothbrushes. no obligate anaerobes were isolated. members of streptococcaceae family were regularly found  (65.2%) belonging to the following species: streptococcus pyogenes, s. mutans, s. mitis, s. oralis, s. sobrinus, s. viridans, s. salivarius, s. sanguis, aerococcus viridans. a. viridans and s. mutans were more frequently isolated on children toothbrushes while staphylococcus aureus and s. epidermidis were found on adults  brushes. escherichia coli, pseudomonas sp. and enterococcus sp., were also recovered. we found that the ozone treatment decreased gradually the microbial load. however, a bacterial re-growth was effective following short ozonation period. decontamination was complete after an extended exposure to ozone for 30 min. conclusions: ozone application was found to remove the toothbrushes bristles microbiota following conventional brushing. maximum decontamination efficacy of ozone treatment was observed after 30 min while exposure for short time periods seems to be inefficient which probably reflect the low dose of ozone used in this study.

AB  == we studied the bioactivities of constituents from two tropical medicinal plants,  cunila spicata and hyptis fasciculata. these plants found in brazil belong to the labiatae family. four known compounds obtained from these herbs were identified as 3alpha, 24-dihydoxylurs-12-en-28-oic acid, betulinic acid, aurantiamide acetate, and aurantiamide benzoate by spectroscopic means. 3alpha, 24-dihydoxylurs-12-en-28-oic acid has potent inhibitory activity against streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, and porphyromomas gingivalis. aurantiamide benzoate exhibited moderate inhibitory activity against xanthine oxidase. it was clarified that herbs cunila spicata and hyptis fasciculata are effective against bronchitis and gout.

TI  == production of monoclonal antibodies against streptococcus mutans antigens.
AB  == several studies have been conducted in the last decades aiming to obtain an anti-caries vaccine, however some studies have demonstrated cross reactivity between streptococcus mutans surface antigens and the human cardiac tissue. in this work, the reactivity of five anti-streptococcus mutans monoclonal antibodies (moab) (24a, 56g, c8, e8 and f6) was tested against oral streptococci, cardiac antigens and skeletal and cardiac myosins, aiming to evaluate the specificity of  these moab. the hybrid producers of immunoglobulins of the igg2b class were cloned by limit dilution and expanded in vivo. moab were tested by elisa. the hybrid 24a reacted with s. mutans cct 1910, s. salivarius cct 0365 and s. pyogenes t23. no reactivity difference was observed among the tested species. cross reactivity with heart and cardiac myosin was not confirmed and only reaction with myosin of skeletal muscle was observed (p = 0.0381). the hybrid 56g reacted with all the tested microorganisms and there was statistically significant difference between s. mutans and s. pyogenes t23 (p < 0.001). this hybrid also reacted with myosin of skeletal muscle (p = 0.0095). c8, e8 and f6 presented low reactivity against oral streptococci strains and no reactivity against cardiac antigens. the data of this study showed that the 24a and 56g anti-s. mutans moab presented reactivity with s. pyogenes and s. salivarius, reinforcing the occurrence of common antigens between these species. the tested moab presented low cross-reactivity with myosin of skeletal muscle, but anti-heart activity could not be confirmed.

TI  == the effect of ingestion of milk supplemented with salivaricin a-producing streptococcus salivarius on the bacteriocin-like inhibitory activity of streptococcal populations on the tongue.
AB  == the colonization efficacies of salivaricin a (sala)-producing streptococcus salivarius strains 20p3 and 5 were compared when given in milk to 219 children, using either 2-day or 9-day dosing regimens. colonization levels overall were superior for strain 5, and the 9-day dosing schedule resulted in higher levels of both initial colonization and strain persistence. the indigenous streptococcal tongue populations of 20 (10.9%) of the 189 children in the 2-day trial showed markedly increased sala-like inhibitory activity following use of the s. salivarius-supplemented milk. all 20 of these children were found to have had relatively small (<5% of total s. salivarius) indigenous tongue populations of sala-producing s. salivarius, and the relative proportions and/or inhibitory activity of these sala producers on the childrens' tongues increased following ingestion of the s. salivarius-supplemented milk. because sala is known to be strongly inhibitory to streptococcus pyogenes, an important implication of this study is that the consumption of sala-producing probiotic s. salivarius could potentially help to effect a sustained increase in sala-mediated protection against s. pyogenes infection.

TI  == production of the lantibiotic salivaricin a and its variants by oral streptococci and use of a specific induction assay to detect their presence in human saliva.
AB  == salivaricin a (sala), the first streptococcus salivarius lantibiotic to be characterized, appears to be inhibitory to most streptococcus pyogenes strains. a variant of the sala structural gene (sala1) is present in more than 90% of s. pyogenes strains, but only strains of m serotype 4 and t pattern 4 produce the biologically active peptide. the present study identifies four additional variants (sala2 to sala5) of the sala structural gene and demonstrates that each  of the corresponding inhibitory peptides (sala2 to sala5) is produced in vitro. these variants appear to be similar to sala and sala1 in their inhibitory activity against micrococcus luteus and in their ability to act as inducers of sala production. it had previously been shown that s. pyogenes strain sf370 had a deletion (of approximately 2.5 kb) in the salm and salt genes of the sala1 locus. in the present study, several additional characteristic deletions within the sala1 loci were identified. s. pyogenes strains of the same m serotype all share  the same sala1 locus structure. since s. salivarius is a predominant member of the normal oral flora of healthy humans, strains producing anti-s. pyogenes lantibiotics, such as sala, may have excellent potential for use as oral probiotics. in the present study, we have used a highly specific sala induction system to directly detect the presence of sala in the saliva of humans who either naturally harbor populations of sala-producing s. salivarius or who have been colonized with the sala2-producing probiotic s. salivarius k12.

TI  == prevention of streptococcal pharyngitis by anti-streptococcus pyogenes bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances (blis) produced by streptococcus salivarius.
AB  == background & objectives: streptococcus salivarius is a numerically prominent member of the human oral microbiota that produces a variety of bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances (blis) having in vitro inhibitory activity against s. pyogenes. our previous studies of s. salivarius isolates from children using a deferred antagonism blis production (p)-typing scheme showed that the 9 per cent  of children having large populations of p-type 677 s. salivarius experienced fewer s. pyogenes acquisitions than either the 11 per cent of children having predominant p-type 226 populations or the 60 per cent of children with largely non-inhibitory (p-type 000) s. salivarius. amongst the other blis p-types detected were a number of strongly-inhibitory (p-type 777) s. salivarius. in the  present study the inhibitory agents produced by prototype strains of p-types 226, 677 and 777 s. salivarius are compared. methods: the prototype blis-producing s.  salivarius strains sn, 20p3, and k12 were isolated from tongue swabbings. blis p-typing was done using standard procedures. the blis molecules were purified and characterized. results: s. salivarius sn (p-type 226) produces a heat-labile muramidase. s. salivarius 20p3 (p-type 677) produces the 2315 da lantibiotic salivaricin a and s. salivarius k12 (p-type 777) produces two lantibiotics; salivaricin a2 (2368 da) and salivaricin b (2733 da). interpretation & conclusion: the p-type 777 s. salivarius strain produced salivaricin a2 and salivaricin b. the combined production of two anti-s. pyogenes blis activities by this strain indicates that it could be adopted as a colonizing strain in bacterial interference trials.

TI  == bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance (blis) production by the normal flora of the nasopharynx: potential to protect against otitis media?
AB  == the normal bacterial flora of the upper airways provides an important barrier to  invading pathogens. this study investigated the production of bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances (blis) by streptococci isolated from the nasopharyngeal flora of children who either do or do not experience recurrent acute otitis media (aom). twenty children with recurrent aom and 15 controls were tested. swabs from the nasopharynx were evaluated for streptococci having blis activity against two  representative strains of each of the aom pathogens streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis. streptococci displaying strong blis activity were characterized further and tested for known streptococcal bacteriocin structural genes. sixty-five per cent  of children had nasopharyngeal streptococcal isolates that were inhibitory to strains of one or more of the aom pathogens. six children (17 %) had streptococci that demonstrated strong blis activity against strains of at least three of the pathogenic species. three of these inhibitory isolates were streptococcus salivarius, two were s. pneumoniae and one was s. pyogenes. the inhibitory s. salivarius and s. pyogenes were shown to have structural genes for known streptococcal bacteriocins. no statistically significant difference was found between the two groups of children with respect to the presence of inhibitory streptococci in their nasopharyngeal floras. the finding of s. salivarius with strong inhibitory activity against several aom pathogens in the nasopharyngeal flora of children is unique. although there is no clear evidence from the present study that these organisms protect against aom, their low pathogenicity and strong in-vitro blis production capability indicate that they should be incorporated in future trials of bacteriotherapy for recurrent aom.

TI  == intra- and interspecies signaling between streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus pyogenes mediated by sala and sala1 lantibiotic peptides.
AB  == streptococcus salivarius 20p3 produces a 22-amino-acid residue lantibiotic, designated salivaricin a (sala), that inhibits the growth of a range of streptococci, including all strains of streptococcus pyogenes. lantibiotic production is associated with the sal genetic locus comprising sala, the lantibiotic structural gene; salbctx genes encoding peptide modification and export machinery proteins; and salykr genes encoding a putative immunity protein  and two-component sensor-regulator system. insertional inactivation of salb in s. salivarius 20p3 resulted in abrogation of sala peptide production, of immunity to sala, and of sala transcription. addition of exogenous sala peptide to salb mutant cultures induced dose-dependent expression of sala mrna (0.2 kb), demonstrating that sala production was normally autoregulated. inactivation of salr encoding the response regulator of the salkr two-component system led to reduced production of, and immunity to, sala. the sal genetic locus was also present in s. pyogenes sf370 (m type 1), but because of a deletion across the salbct genes, the corresponding lantibiotic peptide, designated sala1, was not produced. however, in s. pyogenes t11 (m type 4) the sal locus gene complement was apparently complete, and active sala1 peptide was synthesized. exogenously added sala1 peptide from s. pyogenes t11 induced sala1 transcription in s. pyogenes sf370 and in an isogenic s. pyogenes t11 salb mutant and sala transcription in s. salivarius 20p3 salb. thus, sala and sala1 are examples of streptococcal lantibiotics whose production is autoregulated. these peptides act  as intra- and interspecies signaling molecules, modulating lantibiotic production and possibly influencing streptococcal population ecology in the oral cavity.

TI  == the gene encoding iiab(man)l in streptococcus salivarius is part of a tetracistronic operon encoding a phosphoenolpyruvate: mannose/glucose phosphotransferase system.
AB  == glucose and mannose are transported in streptococci by the mannose-pts (phosphoenolpyruvate:mannose phosphotransferase system), which consists of a cytoplasmic iiab protein, called iiab(man), and an uncharacterized membrane permease. this paper reports the characterization of the man operon encoding the  specific components of the mannose-pts of streptococcus salivarius. the man operon was composed of four genes, manl, manm, mann and mano. these genes were transcribed from a canonical promoter (pman) into a 3.6 kb polycistronic mrna that contained a 5'-utr (untranslated region). the predicted manl gene product encoded a 35.5 kda protein and contained the amino acid sequences of the iia and  iib phosphorylation sites already determined from purified s. salivarius iiab(man)l. expression of manl in escherichia coli generated a 35 kda protein that reacted with anti-iiab(man)l antibodies. the predicted manm protein had an estimated size of 27.2 kda. manm had similarity with iic domains of the mannose-eii family, but did not possess the signature proposed for mannose-iic proteins from gram-negative bacteria. from multiple alignment analyses of sequences available in current databases, the following modified iic(man) signature is proposed: gx3g[dnh]x3g[livm]2xg2[stl][lt][eq]. the deduced product of mann was a hydrophobic protein with a predicted molecular mass of 33.4 kda. the mann protein contained an amino acid sequence similar to the signature sequence of the iid domains of the mannose-eii family. mano encoded a 13.7 kda protein. this gene was also transcribed as a monocistronic mrna from a promoter located in the mann-mano intergenic region. a search of current databases revealed the presence of iiab(man)l, manm, mann and mano orthologues in streptococcus mutans, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae and enterococcus faecalis. this work has elucidated the molecular structure of the mannose pts in streptococci and enterococci, and demonstrated the presence of a putative regulatory protein (mano) within the man operon.

TI  == a new alkaline ph-adjusted medium enhances detection of beta-hemolytic streptococci by minimizing bacterial interference due to streptococcus salivarius.
AB  == a new selective medium (cna-p) that reduces or eliminates the inhibitory activity of bacteriocin-producing streptococcus salivarius against beta-hemolytic streptococci has been developed and compared with sheep blood agar (sba) for the  sensitive detection of small numbers of beta-hemolytic streptococci in clinical specimens. cna-p has as its basis a commercial medium (difco columbia cna agar) supplemented with 5% (vol/vol) sheep blood, and the cna is further modified by addition of 100 mm pipes buffer [piperazine-n,n'-bis(2-ethanesulfonic acid)] (ph  7.5) to maintain cultures at an alkaline ph during incubation. cna-p was shown to inhibit the production and/or release of four different types of s. salivarius bacteriocins or bacteriocin-like inhibitory molecules. the efficacies of cna-p and sba for detection of beta-hemolytic streptococci in 1,352 pharyngeal samples  from 376 children were compared. the beta-hemolytic streptococcal isolates recovered from the samples included 314 group a (s. pyogenes), 61 group g, 33 group b, and 5 group c streptococci. of 314 samples that yielded s. pyogenes, 300 were positive on cna-p (96%) and 264 (86%) were positive on sba. a significantly  greater number of s. pyogenes isolates from these samples were recovered only on  cna-p (50 of 314) compared with the number of isolates recovered only on sba (14  of 314). in addition, the degree of positivity, a measure of the total numbers of s. pyogenes isolates on the plate, was significantly higher on cna-p than on sba  (2.40 versus 2.07; p < 0.001). interestingly, cna-p was also found to enhance the hemolytic activity of streptolysin o, allowing detection of streptolysin s-deficient s. pyogenes strains which might otherwise go undetected on sba and other isolation media.

TI  == increased interleukin-6, interferon-gamma and tumour necrosis factor-alpha production by tonsillar mononuclear cells stimulated with alpha-streptococci in patients with pustulosis palmaris et plantaris.
AB  == in vitro cytokine production by tonsillar mononuclear cells under culture conditions with or without lyophilized streptococcal antigens was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). under culture conditions without any stimulus, a certain amount of interferon (ifn)-gamma, tumour necrosis factor (tnf)-alpha, and interleukin (il)-6, was detected in the supernatant culture fluids from all 29 donors tested and just detectable levels of il-1alpha and il-2 were identified in 5 of 12 donors tested; but il-4 and il-5 were not detected in  any supernatants from 21 donors tested. in 16 patients with pustulosis palmaris et plantaris (ppp), all three alpha-streptococcal antigens from streptococcus, (s.) sanguis, s. salivarius and s. mitis induced production of il-6. ifn-gamma and tnf-alpha by tonsillar mononuclear cells at a significant level. however, no  significant induction of such cytokines by alpha-streptococcal stimulus was seen  in 13 donors without ppp. no significant difference in cytokine production by tonsillar mononuclear cells was seen between the ppp and non-ppp subjects, when stimulated with s. pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus cowan i and pokeweed mitogen.  in the experiments using tonsillar cell subsets, the cytokine inductions by alpha-streptococcal stimulus were found in monocyte-depleted cells as well as in  purified t-cells. but not in b-cells. these data suggest that il-6, ifn-gamma and tnf-alpha may play an important role in immunological reactions in the tonsils and that a hyper-immune response to some of alpha-streptococcal antigens through  increased production of such cytokines by tonsillar mononuclear cells, to which t-cells mainly contribute, may play a key role in the pathogenesis of ppp.

TI  == ctsr, a novel regulator of stress and heat shock response, controls clp and molecular chaperone gene expression in gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == clpp and clpc of bacillus subtillis encode subunits of the clp atp-dependent protease and are required for stress survival, including growth at high temperature. they play essential roles in stationary phase adaptive responses such as the competence and sporulation developmental pathways, and belong to the  so-called class iii group of heat shock genes, whose mode of regulation is unknown and whose expression is induced by heat shock or general stress conditions. the product of ctsr, the first gene of the clpc operon, has now been  shown to act as a repressor of both clpp and clpc, as well as clpe, which encodes a novel member of the hsp100 clp atpase family. the ctsr protein was purified and shown to bind specifically to the promoter regions of all three clp genes. random mutagenesis, dnasel footprinting and dna sequence deletions and comparisons were  used to define a consensus ctsr recognition sequence as a directly repeated heptad upstream from the three clp genes. this target sequence was also found upstream from clp and other heat shock genes of several gram-positive bacteria, including listeria monocytogenes, streptococcus salivarius, s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, s. thermophilus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, leuconostoc oenos, lactobacillus sake, lactococcus lactis and clostridium acetobutylicum. ctsr homologues were also identified in several of these bacteria, indicating that heat shock regulation by ctsr is highly conserved in gram-positive bacteria.

TI  == mutacin production by streptococcus mutans may promote transmission of bacteria from mother to child.
AB  == the production of bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances, mutacins, by mutans streptococci varies among isolates. to find if the degree of mutacin activity of  an isolate was related to its transmission between mother and her child, 19 mothers and their 18-month- to 3-year-old children were sampled for their oral mutans streptococci. in addition, the stability of mutacin activity was studied with isolates from the mothers and with isolates from five unrelated 5-year-old children in 5- to 7-year follow-up studies. a total of 145 oral mutans streptococcal isolates were serotyped by immunodiffusion, ribotyped, and mutacin  typed by the stab culture technique. mutacin was produced by 88% of the strains against more than 1 of the 14 indicator strains, representing mutans streptococci, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus gordonii, and streptococcus pyogenes. streptococcus mutans  isolates showed more inhibitory activity than did streptococcus sobrinus isolates. identical ribotypes had similar mutacin activity profiles within a subject, initially and in the follow-up studies, in all but two cases. the mothers harbored a total of 37 different mutans streptococcal ribotypes. six children were negative for mutans streptococci. transmission was probable in 9 of 20 mother-child pairs on the basis of the presence of identical strains, as determined by ribotyping and bacteriocin (mutacin) typing. s. mutans strains shared between a mother and her child showed a broader spectrum of inhibitory activity than did nontransmitted strains. in conclusion, the mutacin activity of  clinical isolates is reasonably stable, and this virulence factor seems to be of  clinical importance in early colonization by s. mutans.

AB  == the m6 protein from streptococcus pyogenes is the best-characterized member of a  family of cell envelope-associated proteins. based on the observation that the c-terminal sorting signals of these proteins can drive cell wall anchoring of heterologous unanchored proteins, we have cloned and expressed the emm6 structural gene for the m6 protein in various lactic acid bacteria (lab). the emm6 gene was successfully expressed from lactococcal promoters in several lactococcus lactis strains, an animal-colonizing lactobacillus fermentum strain,  lactobacillus sake, and streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus. the m6 protein was efficiently anchored to the cell wall in all strains tested. in lactobacilli, essentially all detectable m6 protein was cell wall associated. these results suggest the feasibility of using the c-terminal anchor moiety of m6 for protein surface display in lab.

TI  == inducer expulsion and the occurrence of an hpr(ser-p)-activated sugar-phosphate phosphatase in enterococcus faecalis and streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == inducer expulsion, a phenomenon in which rapidly metabolizable sugars cause cytoplasmic dephosphorylation and efflux of pre-accumulated sugar-phosphates (sugar-p), has been documented for streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus bovis, and lactococcus lactis, but not for other gram-positive bacteria. using intact cells and membrane vesicles, we show that enterococcus faecalis exhibits both inducer exclusion and inducer expulsion, and that the latter phenomenon is dependent on the metabolite-activated atp-dependent hpr(ser) kinase that phosphorylates ser-46 in hpr of the phosphotransferase system. a small, heat-stable, membrane-associated, hpr(ser-p)-activated sugar-p phosphatase (pase  ii), previously identified only in lc. lactis, is shown to be present in extracts of enterococcus faecalis and streptococcus pyogenes but not in those of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, or bacillis subtilis, organisms that do not exhibit the inducer expulsion phenomenon. further, lactobacillus brevis, an organism that exhibits inducer expulsion by a different mechanism, also apparently lacks pase ii. the results reveal that pase ii is present in those organisms that exhibit the coupled sugar-p hydrolysis/expulsion mechanism but not those that lack this mechanism. they provide correlative evidence that pase ii initiates inducer expulsion in species of enterococci, streptococci and lactococci.

TI  == role of serum antibodies to streptococci in patients with iga nephropathy.
AB  == serum antibodies to whole cells of streptococci and serum immune complexes were investigated in patients with iga nephropathy accompanied by tonsillitis and in healthy adult controls by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). serum iga levels to streptococcus salivarius, s. sanguis i and s. pneumoniae were higher in patients with iga nephropathy than in healthy controls. the levels of igg to s. pyogenes t12, s. gordonii and s. sanguis ii in patients with iga nephropathy were also higher than in healthy controls. serum immune complexes of igg and iga were  higher in patients with iga nephropathy than in healthy controls. serum levels of iga to some strains of streptococci tended to correlate with the level of iga immune complex in both patients and healthy controls. these results suggest that  antibodies to some strains of streptococci play a role in the pathogenesis of iga nephropathy.

TI  == [significance of normal oral flora, particularly group oral streptococci as defense mechanism against infection in healthy individuals (normal defense mechanism by oral streptococcus group)].
AB  == the alpha-streptococci, consisted of normal oral flora mainly, with inhibitory activity against pathogenic microbes in healthy individuals was investigated by group a streptococcus (indicator strain 6-22 nonmucoid t-12). rate of alpha-streptococci with inhibitory activity against group a streptococcus was increased as aging, and the rate in pre-school children was higher than that in school children. these results suggested that more than 90% of the tested alpha-streptococci with strong inhibitory activities (s. salivarius) against indicator strain had inhibitory activities against group a streptococcus (mucoid  t-6), h. influenzae, s. pneumoniae, group c streptococcus, and from 40% to 70% of the tested strains had also inhibitory activities against other pathogens. as there were many strains of alpha-streptococci with inhibitory activities against  pathogens, that usually detected in the upper respiratory infection, the problem  on the strains in the future will explain significance of the defense mechanism against upper respiratory infection and this can be applied clinically.

TI  == applications of blis typing to studies of the survival on surfaces of salivary streptococci and staphylococci.
AB  == a typing scheme based on detection of the production of bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances (blis) was a useful tool in a series of epidemiological studies of the spread and survival on surfaces of salivary streptococci and staphylococci. the organisms survived for longer periods on glass, plastic, stainless steel and latex surfaces than on unpainted wood or paper. the presence  of saliva as a suspending medium prolonged the viability of staphylococcus aureus c55 and streptococcus pyogenes ff22 but not of strep. salivarius min 5. young children were shown to carry strep. salivarius of identical blis-types on their fingers and in their saliva. blis typing of strep. salivarius strains obtained from telephone mouthpieces and from the tongue-sealed flap of envelopes was used  as a method of tracing the human source of the salivary deposits.

TI  == association between the 65-kilodalton heat shock protein, streptococcus sanguis,  and the corresponding antibodies in behcet's syndrome.
AB  == the etiology of behcet's syndrome (bs) is unknown, but a number of streptococcal  species have been implicated. a hypothesis was postulated that a shared antigen,  such as a stress protein, might account for some of these findings. indeed, a rabbit antiserum against a 65-kda heat shock protein of mycobacterium tuberculosis revealed a corresponding 65-kda band with all six streptococcus sanguis strains examined and s. pyogenes but not with s. salivarius. by applying  a panel of nine monoclonal antibodies to the mycobacterial 65-kda heat shock protein, an approximately 65-kda antigen was identified in the uncommon serotypes of s. sanguis st3 and h.83 and one with a different mr was identified in kth-1 and s. pyogenes. monoclonal antibodies y1.2, c1.1, ii h9, and ml30, which reacted with these streptococci, recognize residues 11 to 27, 88 to 123, 107 to 122, and  276 to 297 of the 65-kda heat shock protein, respectively, suggesting that these  residues are conserved among some uncommon serotypes of s. sanguis and s. pyogenes. immunoblot analyses of sera from patients with bs for immunoglobulin a  (iga) and igg antibodies revealed bands of 65 to 70 kda with the mycobacterial heat shock protein, s. sanguis strains, and s. pyogenes, although these reactivities were also found to a lesser extent in controls. a 65- to 70-kda band was found more frequently with s. sanguis kth-2 or kth-3 and iga in serum from patients with bs than with serum from controls (p less than 0.02). antibodies in  serum were then studied by a radioimmunoassay, and in patients with bs this revealed significantly raised iga antibodies to the recombinant 65-kda mycobacterial heat shock protein and to soluble protein extracts of s. sanguis st3, kth-1, kth-2, and kth-3. whereas significant anti-65-kda heat shock protein  and anti-s. sanguis st3 antibodies were also found in sera from patients with rheumatoid arthritis and recurrent oral ulcers, the anti-s. sanguis kth-1, kth-2, and kth-3 antibodies were confined to bs. the results are consistent with the hypothesis that some of the streptococcal antigens are associated with heat shock or stress proteins, which will need to be formally established by isolating heat  shock proteins from streptococci.

TI  == mutacin activity of strains isolated from children with varying levels of mutants streptococci and caries.
AB  == a total of 157 isolates of mutants streptococci from plaque and saliva of 94 children were studied for their serotypes, mutacin production, frequency and spectrum of activity. of these isolates 71% were identified as serotype c and 22% as serotype e. serotypes f, d and g, and one untypable strain made up about 7% of the isolates. more than one serotype was found in 13% of the children. mutacin was produced by 83% of the isolates against one or more of the 14 indicator strains representing mutants streptococci. streptococcus sanguis, strep. oralis,  strep. gordonii, strep. salivarius and strep. pyogenes. isolates that had a broad inhibitory spectrum also produced larger inhibition zones than isolates that inhibited fewer strains. when evaluating the effect of mutacin in vivo on plaque  ecology, it was found that the counts of mutans streptococci or the proportion of mutans streptococci in the total streptococcal count of plaque did not differ between plaques containing strains that produced much mutacin and those with little production. the findings also failed to reveal an association between caries experience and mutacin activity.

AB  == the purpose of this study was to clarify the etiological role of immune responses in tonsillar lymphocytes of the patients with pustulosis palmaris et plantaris (ppp). in order to determine their immune response to s. pyogenes t4, s. pyogenes t12, s mitis, s. salivarius, s. sanguis i, s. sanguis ii and s. pneumoniae, tonsillar lymphocytes from patients with ppp, ct, and sleep apnea syndrome (control) were cultured with formalinized streptococcal cellular antigens. blastoid transformation was investigated by [3h] -thymidine uptake, while antistreptococcal antibody production were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). the results were as follows. 1. tonsillar lymphocytes from ppp patients underwent blastoid transformation and accelerated the production of immunoglobulin g following the addition of s. sanguis i, s. sanguis ii s. mitis, s. pyogenes t4, and s. pyogenes t12, while those form ct patients and controls did so only with s. pyogenes t4 and s. pyogenes t12. 2. the spontaneous production of specific igg against various streptococci, including s. sanguis i, s. sanguis ii and s. mitis by tonsillar lymphocytes from patients with ppp was already higher than that from ct patients and controls. the specific igm  production was also increased above that in ppp patients without any antigens. 3. s. sanguis i, s. sanguis ii and s. salivarius antigens stimulated antigen-specific igm production in tonsillar lymphocytes from ppp patients. 4. the levels of specific igg production against s. sanguis i and s. sanguis ii by tonsillar lymphocytes from ppp patients showed a relationship with the serum levels of the ppp patients. these results suggested that the sensitization of alpha-streptococci, especially s. sanguis, in the tonsillar lacunae may lead to the specific production of anti-s. sanguis antibodies in patients with ppp, and these may be involved in the pathogenesis of ppp.

TI  == [investigation of the bacterial flora in the tonsillar lacunae and serum levels of streptococcal antigen-specific antibodies in patients with pustulosis palmaris et plantaris].
AB  == the purpose of this study was to clarify the relationship between bacterial flora in tonsillar lacunae and antistreptococcal antibody in sera of the patients with  pustulosis palmaris et plantaris (ppp). since the pustules develops or worsens after tonsillitis in many patients with ppp, a pathogenic role of tonsillar bacteria is suggested, but no significant association has been proven so far. in  this study, the aerobes in the tonsillar lacunae were identified and quantitated  in 15 adult patients with ppp and 9 adult patients with chronic tonsillitis (ct). in addition, serum streptococcal antigen-specific antibody levels in 40 adult patients with ppp, 18 adult patients with chronic tonsillitis, and 11 healthy volunteers (controls) were examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). the results were as follows. 1. a total of 53 strains (17 species) of aerobes were isolated and identified from the tonsillar lacunae in patients with ppp, while 35 strains (12 species) of aerobes were found in the patients with ct. 2. s. salivarius and s. pneumoniae were the dominant aerobes isolated from patients  with ppp or ct. 3. although the rates of isolation for staphylococcus and s. pneumoniae were lower in ppp patients than in ct patients, the rate for s. sanguis i was higher in ppp patients than in ct patients. 4. the percentage of alpha, gamma-streptococci to total aerobes in ppp patients was higher than in ct  patients. 5. the igg antibody titers against s. sanguis and s. mitis, and the igm antibody titers against all streptococci investigated in ppp patients were higher than those in both ct patients and controls. 6. moreover, both the igg antibody titers against s. pyogenes t4 and s. sanguis i and the igm antibody titers against s. sanguis i and s. sanguis ii of the patients in which ppp markedly improved after tonsillectomy were higher than those in which ppp showed less improvement postoperatively.

TI  == coaggregation of streptococcus sanguis and other streptococci with candida albicans.
AB  == thirteen strains of viridans group streptococci and two strains of other streptococci were tested for coaggregation with candida albicans. streptococcus sanguis strains generally exhibited low levels of adherence to 28 degrees c-grown exponential-phase yeast cells, but starvation of yeast cells for glucose at 37 degrees c (or at 28 degrees c) increased their coaggregating activity with these  streptococci by at least tenfold. this was a property common to four c. albicans  strains tested, two of which were able to form mycelia (6406 and men) and two of  which were not (mm2002 and ca2). the expression of the coaggregation adhesin during yeast cell starvation was inhibited by addition of trichodermin or amphotericin b. the strains of s. sanguis, streptococcus gordonii, and streptococcus oralis tested for coaggregating activity encompassed a diverse range of physiological and morphological types, yet all exhibited saturable coaggregation with starved c. albicans cells. there was no correlation of cell surface hydrophobicity, of either yeast or streptococcal cells, with their abilities to coaggregate. strains of streptococcus anginosus also coaggregated with starved yeast cells; streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus pyogenes coaggregated to a lesser degree with c. albicans, and the coaggregation with s. pyogenes was not promoted by yeast cell starvation; streptococcus mutans and enterococcus faecalis did not coaggregate with yeast. the coaggregation reactions of s. sanguis and s. gordonii with c. albicans were inhibited by edta and by heat or protease treatment of the yeast cells and were not reversible by the addition  of lactose or other simple sugars. these observations extend the range of intergeneric coaggregations that are known to occur between oral microbes and suggest that coaggregations of c. albicans with viridans group streptococci may be important for colonization of oral surfaces by the yeast.

TI  == properties of a phosphocarrier protein (hpr) extracted from intact cells of streptococcus sanguis.
AB  == cells of streptococcus sanguis strain challis were incubated with sodium lauroylsarcosinate to extract surface proteins. a polypeptide of apparent molecular mass 16 kda comprising about 12% of the extract was purified using anion-exchange chromatography. the polypeptide was shown to be a phosphocarrier protein (hpr) that could also be found in the soluble (cytoplasmic) fraction from cells broken by homogenization with glass beads. in vivo labelling of s. sanguis  cells with 32pi showed that the polypeptide carried a heat- and acid-stable phosphorylation and that during sucrose starvation the hpr became dephosphorylated. antiserum raised to the s. sanguis hpr reacted on western blots with hprs from all oral streptococci tested, together with strains of s. pyogenes and s. salivarius, but not with hprs from s. faecalis or s. bovis, nor with proteins from staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, actinomyces viscosus and  various lactobacilli. the s. sanguis hpr had a high content of alanine (17.2%) and was similar in overall amino acid composition to the hprs from s. mutans an s. salivarius. the n-terminal residues (to 37) of the s. sanguis hpr showed strong sequence identity (82%) with the n-terminal sequence of s. faecalis hpr. it is suggested that hpr in s. sanguis is associated closely with the cytoplasmic membrane. non-disruptive methods of removing cell-surface proteins from streptococci effect release of hpr and possibly other cytoplasmic components.

TI  == inhibitory substances produced by streptococcus salivarius and colonization of the upper respiratory tract with group a streptococci.
AB  == it has been proposed that inhibitory substances produced by viridans streptococci colonizing the upper respiratory tract aid in eradication of established group a  streptococcal colonization of that site. we studied the prevalence of inhibitory-substance producing strains of streptococcus salivarius in throat cultures from three groups of children: 16 children with persistently positive throat cultures for group a streptococci despite receiving recommended therapeutic courses of antibiotics (group i), 26 children from whom group a streptococci were eradicated from the upper respiratory tract by antibiotic therapy (group ii), and 18 children who never harboured group a streptococci in their upper respiratory tract during the study period (group iii). an in vitro deferred antagonism method was employed to detect inhibitory substances; 5233 strains of s. salivarius were examined. strains of s. salivarius producing inhibitory substances were isolated from 76-88% of the children in each group on  at least one occasion. however, only a small percentage of subjects in each group harboured strains producing these substances in every throat culture. the mean total percentage of s. salivarius strains producing inhibitory substances was 21.8% in children in group i, 22.4% in children in group ii, and 16.4% in children in group iii; these percentages were not statistically different (p greater than 0.1). in this study, we could not confirm a significant role for inhibitory substances produced by s. salivarius in the eradication of group a streptococci from the upper respiratory tract of colonized individuals.

TI  == enocin: an antibiotic produced by streptococcus salivarius that may contribute to protection against infections due to group a streptococci.
AB  == clinical studies have indicated that certain constituents of the normal throat flora may play a role in resistance to group a streptococcal infections. strains  of streptococcus salivarius were among the most active components of this protective flora. the present studies were designed to determine the mechanism responsible for the antagonism of group a streptococci by s. salivarius. cell-free filtrates made at the end of the logarithmic growth phase of s. salivarius inhibited the growth of group a streptococci. the only other organisms susceptible to inhibition by these filtrates were those that require exogenous pantothenate, as group a streptococci do. the activity of filtrates was primarily bacteriostatic and could be specifically reversed by pantothenate. activity was not due to a simple depletion of the vitamin but rather to the presence of a substance that interfered with the utilization of pantothenate. this substance, given the name enocin, was heat labile but was unaffected by proteolytic enzymes. thus, strains of s. salivarius that appear to enhance the resistance of certain individuals to streptococcal infection may exert their protective effect through  in situ production of the antibiotic enocin.

AB  == antigens extracted from cells of streptococcus pyogenes t6 and streptococcus mutans strains aht, bht, 10449, omz175, and k1r adsorbed to the sarcolemmal sheath of cardiac muscle cells in vitro. similar preparations from s. salivarius, s. sanguis, staphylococcus aureus, and lactobacillus casei had weak or negligible tissue-binding activity. tissue-bound bacterial antigens were detected with homologous rabbit antisera with both indirect immunofluorescence tests and an indirect radioimmunoassay. serological cross-reactivity was observed between the  tissue-binding factors of s. pyogenes and s. mutans cells but not between the bacteria and muscle tissue. in a comparative study of extraction procedures, the  greatest yield of tissue-binding factors was obtained from group a streptococci by cell disruption in buffer at 4 degrees c. hot aqueous phenol and hot water extracts were inactive. antibodies specific for the tissue-binding factor(s) were readily adsorbed from rabbit anti-s. pyogenes serum by a preparation of isolated  cytoplasmic membranes but not by a suspension of cell wall fragments. the heart-binding component of s. pyogenes cell extracts was inactivated by protease  digestion and heat treatment and to a lesser extent by periodic acid oxidation. the capacity of heart cell components to adsorb streptococcal antigens was reduced by protease treatment but not by the action of neuraminidase, hyaluronidase, organic solvents, or detergents.

TI  == adherence of veillonella species mediated by extracellular glucosyltransferase from streptococcus salivarius.
AB  == the effect of extracellular products from streptococcus salivarius on sucrose-dependent adherence to smooth surfaces by other oral bacteria was studied in vitro. strains of streptococcus mitis, streptococcus pyogenes, and veillonella parvula without innate ability to adhere to a steel wire were able to do so when  incubated with sucrose and cell-free culture fluid from s. salivarius strains 9759, 25975, cnii, and mepi. these culture fluids synthesized more adherent material and water-insoluble glucan than those from streptococcus mutans c67-1 and seven other s. salivarius strains. among the s. salivarius strains, glucosyltransferase (gt; dextransucrase, ec 2.4.1.5) activity varied more than 100-fold. cells of veillonella and s. mitis s3 that had been incubated in culture fluids from s. salivarius 25975 and 9759, respectively, and then washed adhered upon subsequent incubation with sucrose. this was due to adsorbed gt because (i)  the adherence was sensitive to dextranase; (ii) it was observed only with the high-gt culture fluids; (iii) it was dependent on sucrose; and (iv) the washed veillonella cells synthesized glucan, but not fructan, from sucrose. these results suggest that sucrose-dependent adherence of bacteria without such innate  ability can be mediated by (i) entrapment in insoluble glucan synthesized by s. salivarius culture fluids, and (ii) prior adsorption of gt from s. salivarius culture fluids. the possibility that gt formed by high-yield strains of s. salivarius is distributed through the mouth by the action of salivary flow and contributes to sucrose-dependent adherence and plaque formation is considered.

TI  == arthritogenicity in rats of cell walls from several streptococci staphylococci and two other bacteria.
AB  == bacterial cell walls from str. bovis, str. lactis, str. mutans, str. thermophilus, str. salivarius, and str. pyogenes were able to produce polyarthritis in rats but str. faecalis cell walls were nonarthritogenic. s. aureus cell walls produced extremely severe disease. it was also shown that cell  walls from s. epidermidis, b. megaterium, and m. lysodeikticus were nonarthritogenic. a close correlation was observed between development of arthritis and the delayed hypersensitivity to bacterial peptidoglycans but not with the ppd hypersensitivity. it was suggested that the adjuvanticity of bacterial cell walls is needed to induce the disease and that arthritogenicity requires a specific antigen in addition to the presence of an adjuvant-inducing agent.

TI  == selective adherence as a determinant of the host tropisms of certain indigenous and pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == the relationship between the selective abilities of bacteria to adhere and their  predilections for colonizing different mammalian hosts was investigated by using  bacteria indigenous to the tongue dorsum of humans and rats as models. streptococcus salivarius and s. sanguis averaged 22.6 and 2.8%, respectively, of  the cultivable bacteria recovered from swab samples of the tonges of five humans, but these organisms were not indigenous on the tongues of rats (charles river strain). s. faecalis and serum-requiring diphtheroids were consistently prominant on the tongues of rats, but they were not detected on the tongues of the humans examined. the ability of these organisms to adhere to the tongue surface of the hosts was compared by introducing mixtures of streptomycin-resistant strains into the mouths of human volunteers and rats. s. salivarius adhered in higher proportions to the dorsal tongue surface of humans than did strains of s. faecalis and the serum-requiring diphtheroid. s. sanguis also adhered to human tongues better than the serum-requiring diphtheroid. however, s. faecalis and the serum-requiring diphtheroid sorbed in higher proportions to the tongues of rats.  in an in vivo assay, human strains of s. pyogenes and s. salivarius attached in higher numbers to buccal epithelial cells derived from humans than to those obtained from rats, whereas the reverse was observed with a serum-requiring diphtheroid derived from rats. collectively, these studies show that bacteria sorb with a high degree of specificity to the tissues of different mammalian hosts, and the relative adherence of the organisms studied correlated with their  natural host tropisms. the selective adherence of s. salvarius and s. faecalis was similar to the tongues of conventional and germ-free rats, suggesting that the presence of an indigenous bacterial flora did not significantly influence their attachment selectivity. moreover, the ability of these organisms to colonize the tongues of gnotobiotic rats lacking an indigenous flora paralleled their adherence selectivity. direct scanning microscopic observations indicated that the tongue dorsum of conventional rats is highly papillated but contains relatively sparse bacterial populations. indigenous organisms colonized the bases of papillae on the anterior tip and lateral edges of the tongue as discrete microcolonies, but bacteria were rarely observed on other papillae. this localized and restricted pattern of colonization and the spatial distribution of  the microcolonies of indigenous bacteria present also suggest that antagonistic interactions are unlikely to account for the bacterial tropisms observed for colonization of the tongues of rats.

TI  == [nasopharyngeal microorganisms--antagonists of meningococci].
AB  == a study was made of the species composition of symbiotic microbial flora of the nasopharynx in healthy persons and meningococcus carriers, inhibiting in vitro the growth of the test strains of miningococci. saprophytic streptococci and particularly str. salivarius served as the principal and the most active antagonists of meningococci in both groups of the persons examined. comparison of the inhibitory activity of antagonists in the groups examined revealed no significant differences. however, there were seen differences in the quantitative composition of the isolated antagonists: saprophytic streptococci, particularly str. salivarius were isolated in great amounts, and more frequently from healthy  individuals, and nondifferentiated gram positive cocci of conditionally distinguished group--from carriers. taking into consideration the high inhibitory activity of str. salivarius it is supposed that it can be used as an indicator of the state of insensitiveness of the human organism to the meningococcus infection.

TI  == bacteriocin production and susceptibility among strains of streptococcus mutans grown in the presence of sucrose.
AB  == whereas the bacteriocin activity of eight strains of streptococcus mutans was unaffected by growth in the presence of sucrose, such a medium rendered five s. mutans and one s. salivarius indicator strains unsusceptible to the bacteriocins. in contrast, the susceptibility of three s. faecalis and one s. pyogenes strains  was unaltered when these indicators were grown in the presence of sucrose. since  the s. mutans and s. salivarius strains produced extracellular polysaccharides from sucrose whereas the s. faecalis and s. pyogenes strains did not, it was concluded that a coating of extracellular polysaccharides rendered normally susceptible organisms unsusceptible to bacteriocin action. this supports previous suggestions that such bacteriocins are not active in vivo and therefore play no role in regulating the microbial ecology in dental plaque.

TI  == parameters affecting the adherence and tissue tropisms of streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == virulent m protein-containing strains of streptococcus pyogenes were found to adhere well to human pharyngeal cells in vitro. in contrast, an avirulent m - strain and an enteropathogenic escherichia coli strain adhered feebly. when various rat tissues were exposed to mixtures of a virulent s. pyogenes strain and an enteropathogenic e. coli strain, the relative proportions of the two pathogenic strains recovered from mucosal surfaces differed among the sites studied. s. pyogenes cells were found to adhere in higher proportions than enteropathogenic e. coli cells to the mucosal surfaces of rat tongues, whereas on surfaces of the urinary bladder, their affinities were reversed. the data indicate that bacterial adherence is influenced by the specificity of both the bacterial and epithelial surfaces, and they suggest that adherence may influence  the tissue tropisms of pathogens. early stationary-phase cells of s. pyogenes attached better to epithelial cells than did bacteria in other growth phases. the adherence of s. pyogenes cells was impaired by pretreatment with trypsin, wheat germ lipase, tween 80, triton x-100, sodium lauryl sulfate, heat at 56 c, anti-group a antiserum, the presence of phospholipids, and preincubation of the epithelial cells with streptococcus salivarius cell walls. altering the ph or treatment with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid had no effect on the ability of s. pyogenes cells to adhere.

TI  == proportional distribution and relative adherence of streptococcus miteor (mitis)  on various surfaces in the human oral cavity.
AB  == a group of streptococci possessing the characteristics of streptococcus miteor (s. mitis) was found to predominate on nonkeratinized human oral mucosa. these organisms averaged from 76 to 89% of the total flora cultivable on anaerobically  incubated blood agar plates from cheek, lip, and ventral tongue surfaces. they averaged 34, 40, and 18% of the streptococci in dental plaque, in saliva, and on  the tongue dorsum, respectively. their ability to adhere to oral surfaces was studied by introducing mixtures of streptomycin-resistant strains of s. miteor, s. salivarius, and s. mutans into the mouths of volunteers. samples of oral surfaces taken 1 hr later indicated s. miteor adhered far better than the other streptococci to buccal mucosa and to teeth, but s. salivarius showed a higher affinity to the tongue dorsum. glucose-grown cells of s. mutans adhered feebly to all oral surfaces studied and were rapidly cleared from the mouth. cells of s. miteor and s. salivarius present naturally in saliva adhered to cleaned teeth comparable to in vitro cultivated strains. electron microscopy of cells of s. miteor attached to buccal epithelial cells obtained from germfree rats indicated  that the organisms possessed a fibrillar "fuzzy" coat which appeared to mediate their attachment to the epithelial cell membrane. this "fuzzy" coat was removed by treatment with trypsin, and it appears to be similar to that previously observed on cells of s. pyogenes and s. salivarius.
