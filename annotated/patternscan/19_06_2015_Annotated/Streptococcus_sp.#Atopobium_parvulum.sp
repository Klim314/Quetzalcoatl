TI  == antimicrobial activity of streptococcus salivarius k12 on bacteria involved in oral malodour.
AB  == objective: to investigate the antimicrobial activity of the bacteriocin-producing strain streptococcus salivarius k12 against several bacteria involved in halitosis. design: the inhibitory activity of s. salivarius k12 against solobacterium moorei ccug39336, four clinical s. moorei isolates, atopobium parvulum atcc33793 and eubacterium sulci atcc35585 was examined by a deferred antagonism test. eubacterium saburreum atcc33271 and parvimonas micra atcc33270,  which have been tested in previous studies, served as positive controls, and the  gram-negative strain bacteroides fragilis zib2800 served as a negative control. additionally, the occurrence of resistance in s. moorei ccug39336 to s. salivarius k12 was analysed by either direct plating or by passage of s. moorei ccug39336 on chloroform-inactived s. salivarius k12-containing agar plates. results: s. salivarius k12 suppressed the growth of all gram-positive bacteria tested, but the extent to which the bacteria were inhibited varied. e. sulci atcc35585 was the most sensitive strain, while all five s. moorei isolates were inhibited to a lesser extent. natural resistance seems to be very low in s. moorei ccug39336, and there was only a slight decrease in sensitivity after exposure to s. salivarius k12 over 10 passages. conclusion: our studies demonstrate that s. salivarius k12 has antimicrobial activity against bacteria involved in halitosis. this strain might be an interesting and valuable candidate for the development of an antimicrobial therapy for halitosis.

TI  == molecular identification of bacteria on the tongue dorsum of subjects with and without halitosis.
AB  == aim: compare the microbial profiles on the tongue dorsum in patients with halitosis and control subjects in a uk population using culture-independent techniques. materials and methods: halitosis patients were screened according to  our recently developed recruitment protocol. scrapings from the tongue dorsum were obtained for 12 control subjects and 20 halitosis patients. bacteria were identified by pcr amplification, cloning and sequencing of 16s rrna genes. results: the predominant species found in the control samples were lysobacter-type species, streptococcus salivarius, veillonella dispar, unidentified oral bacterium, actinomyces odontolyticus, atopobium parvulum and veillonella atypica. in the halitosis samples, lysobacter-type species, s. salivarius, prevotella melaninogenica, unidentified oral bacterium, prevotella veroralis and prevotella pallens were the most commonly found species. for the control samples, 13-16 (4.7-5.8%) of 276 clones represented uncultured species, whereas in the halitosis samples, this proportion increased to 6.5-9.6% (36-53 of 553 clones). in the control samples, 22 (8.0%) of 276 clones represented potentially novel phylotypes, and in the halitosis samples, this figure was 39 (7.1%) of 553 clones. conclusions: the microflora associated with the tongue dorsum is complex in both the control and halitosis groups, but several key species predominate in both groups.

TI  == diversity of bacterial populations on the tongue dorsa of patients with halitosis and healthy patients.
AB  == the primary purpose of the present study was to compare the microbial profiles of the tongue dorsa of healthy subjects and subjects with halitosis by using culture-independent molecular methods. our overall goal was to determine the bacterial diversity on the surface of the tongue dorsum as part of our ongoing efforts to identify all cultivable and not-yet-cultivated species of the oral cavity. tongue dorsum scrapings were analyzed from healthy subjects with no complaints of halitosis and subjects with halitosis, defined as an organoleptic score of 2 or more and volatile sulfur compound levels greater than 200 ppb. 16s  rrna genes from dna isolated from tongue dorsum scrapings were amplified by pcr with universally conserved bacterial primers and cloned into escherichia coli. typically, 50 to 100 clones were analyzed from each subject. fifty-one strains isolated from the tongue dorsa of healthy subjects were also analyzed. partial sequences of approximately 500 bases of cloned inserts from the 16s rrna genes of isolates were compared with sequences of known species or phylotypes to determine species identity or closest relatives. nearly complete sequences of about 1,500 bases were obtained for potentially novel species or phylotypes. in an analysis of approximately 750 clones, 92 different bacterial species were identified. about half of the clones were identified as phylotypes, of which 29 were novel to the tongue microbiota. fifty-one of the 92 species or phylotypes were detected in more than one subject. those species most associated with healthy subjects were streptococcus salivarius, rothia mucilaginosa, and an uncharacterized species of  eubacterium (strain ftb41). streptococcus salivarius was the predominant species  in healthy subjects, as it represented 12 to 40% of the total clones analyzed from each healthy subject. overall, the predominant microbiota on the tongue dorsa of healthy subjects was different from that on the tongue dorsa of subjects with halitosis. those species most associated with halitosis were atopobium parvulum, a phylotype (clone bs095) of dialister, eubacterium sulci, a phylotype  (clone dr034) of the uncultivated phylum tm7, solobacterium moorei, and a phylotype (clone bw009) of streptococcus: on the basis of our ongoing efforts to  obtain full 16s rrna sequences for all cultivable and not-yet-cultivated species  that colonize the oral cavity, there are now over 600 species.
