TI  - Lactobacillus ruminis is a predominant lactic acid producing bacterium in the caecum and rectum of the pig.
AB  - AIMS: To identify the predominant lactic acid producing bacteria in the small intestine, caecum and the rectum of the healthy pig. METHODS AND RESULTS: Samples obtained from the large intestine of healthy pigs post-mortem were cultured using a modified agar-MRS medium in roll tubes. Thirteen isolates were selected on the basis of their morphological characteristics and Gram stain reaction for gene sequencing. These isolates were characterized by DNA sequence analysis of 16S rDNA. Eight isolates were identified as Lactobacillus ruminis, two as Enterococcus faecium, one as Mitsuokella multiacidus and two as Escherichia coli. CONCLUSION: This is the first report of Lact. ruminis as the dominant lactic acid bacteria in the large intestine of the pig. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The results suggest that Lact. ruminis is a dominant bacterium in the large intestine of the healthy pig. Future work should focus on the role of this bacterium in relation to the physiological function of the intestine and the health of the animal.
TI  - Diet influences the ecology of lactic acid bacteria and Escherichia coli along the digestive tract of cattle: neural networks and 16S rDNA.
AB  - In this manuscript, the authors have sought to gain a better understanding of the interactions between Escherichia coli and lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from Rogossa MRS agar along the digestive tract of grain- and forage-fed cattle. E. coli from cattle receiving a high-grain diet were more numerous (P<0.05) than from the high-forage diet and the highest numbers were in the faeces. Isolates on Rogossa MRS agar were always greater in the high-grain diet (P<0.05) and contained a significant number of LAB. A random set of Rogossa MRS agar colonies was selected and artificial neural networks were used to develop a relationship between colony description and species which was validated using sequence analysis (16S rDNA). The neural networks correctly predicted species in more than 80 % of cases and was composed, primarily, of Lactobacillus vitulinus, Lactobacillus ruminis, Selenomonas ruminantium, Streptococcus bovis, Acidaminococcus fermentans and Megasphaera elsdenii. In conjunction with statistical diversity indices, it was demonstrated that diversity in the high-fibre diet was always lower and was a consequence of the dominance of Str. bovis. In contrast, the diversity in the high-grain diet was greater (P<0.05) and was a consequence of the decline in Str. bovis. These data demonstrate that there is a positive relationship between coliform and LAB isolates throughout the digestive tract of cattle, and diet is the major factor regulating bacterial composition.
