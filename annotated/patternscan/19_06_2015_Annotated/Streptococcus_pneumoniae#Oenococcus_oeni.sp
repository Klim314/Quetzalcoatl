TI  == pediococcus parvulus gtf gene encoding the gtf glycosyltransferase and its application for specific pcr detection of beta-d-glucan-producing bacteria in foods and beverages.
AB  == exopolysaccharide production by lactic acid bacteria is beneficial in the dairy and oat-based food industries and is used to improve the texture of the fermented products. however, beta-d-glucan-producing bacteria are considered spoilage microorganisms in alcoholic beverages because their secreted exopolysaccharides alter the viscosity of cider, wine, and beer, rendering them unpalatable. the plasmidic glycosyltransferase (gtf) gene of the pediococcus parvulus 2.6 strain isolated from ropy cider has been cloned and sequenced, and its gtf product was functionally expressed in streptococcus pneumoniae. the gtf protein, which has glycosyltransferase activity, belongs to the cog1215 membrane-bound glycosyltransferase family, and agglutination tests revealed that the enzyme enables s. pneumoniae to synthesize beta-d-glucan. pcr amplification and southern blot hybridization showed that the gtf gene is also present at different genomic  locations in the beta-d-glucan producers lactobacillus diolivorans g77 and oenococcus oeni i4 strains, also isolated from ropy cider. a pcr assay has been developed for the detection of exopolysaccharide-producing bacteria. forward and  reverse primers, included respectively in the coding sequences of the putative glycosyltransferase domain and the fifth trans-membrane segment of the gtf, were  designed. analysis of 76 ropy and nonropy lactic acid bacteria validated the method for specific detection of beta-d-glucan homopolysaccharide producer pediococcus, lactobacillus, and oenococcus strains. the limit of the assay in cider was 3 x 10(2) cfu/ml. this molecular method can be useful for the detection of ropy bacteria in cider before spoilage occurs, as well as for isolation of new exopolysaccharide-producing strains of industrial interest.

TI  == a putative glucan synthase gene dps detected in exopolysaccharide-producing pediococcus damnosus and oenococcus oeni strains isolated from wine and cider.
AB  == some lactic acid bacteria can induce viscosity in wine, beer and cider by production of exopolysaccharides (eps). a polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay was previously described for the detection of ropy pediococcus damnosus strains in wine [j. appl. microbiol. 90 (2001) 535]. the primers used in that study, pf5  and pf6, are investigated in addition to new primers which broaden the range of spoiling agents detectable by pcr. primers pf1 and pf8 allow the amplification of dna from ropy p. damnosus strains isolated from wine, as was observed with pf5 and pf6. in addition, pf1 and pf8, unlike pf5 and pf6, are able to generate an amplicon using template dna from a ropy p. damnosus strain isolated from cider and a ropy oenococcus oeni strain isolated from champagne. two different ropy lactobacillus species were also isolated, but their dna was not amplified using primers pf1 and pf8. the new primers pf1 and pf8 were chosen from the sequence of gene dps, a putative glucan synthase gene, found across all the ropy p. damnosus  strains isolated, from both wine or cider, and also in a ropy o. oeni strain. to  our knowledge, this is the first time that an eps-producing o. oeni strain is described. glucan biosynthesis was assessed by agglutination tests done with streptococcus pneumoniae type 37-specific antibodies, which specifically detect glucan-producing cells. the results show that there is a direct correlation between glucan production and detection of gene dps. therefore, dps is considered a candidate for the glucan synthase enzyme responsible for eps production by ropy strains of p. damnosus and o. oeni.
