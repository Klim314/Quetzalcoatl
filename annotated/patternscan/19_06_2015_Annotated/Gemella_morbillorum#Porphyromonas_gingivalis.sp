TI  == evaluation of the subgingival microbiota of alcoholic and non-alcoholic individuals.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to evaluate the composition of the subgingival microbiota of alcoholic and non-alcoholic individuals. methods: the study was conducted with 49 alcoholic and 49 non-alcoholic males of the philippe  pinel institute, rio de janeiro, brazil. the subjects were selected by convenience and two criteria were used to diagnose alcohol dependence: the cage (cut-down, annoyed, guilt, eyes-opener) questionnaire and the international statistical classification of diseases, 10th edition (who). subgingival biofilm samples were obtained from 4 sites, 2 with probing depth (pd) >/= 4 mm and 2 sites with pd < 4 mm. the presence and levels of 45 bacterial taxa were analysed  using the checkerboard technique. results: the prevalence of bacterial species was not significantly different between groups. however, alcoholics showed significantly higher mean counts of aggregactibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum nucleatum, and porphyromonas gingivalis (adjusted p < 0.001). moreover, alcoholics harboured significantly higher mean levels of capnocytophaga sputigena, fusobacterium nucleatum vincentii, f. nuc. nucleatum, gemella morbillorum, neisseria mucosa, p. gingivalis, streptococcus gordonii, and tannerella forsythia at sites with pd < 4 mm or >/= 4 mm compared to non-alcoholics (p </= 0.001). of interest, shallow sites of alcoholics presented  significantly higher mean levels of f. nuc. vincentii, f. nuc nucleatum, p. gingivalis, and t. forsythia than sites with pd >/= 4 mm of non-alcoholics (p </= 0.001). conclusions: alcoholics and non-alcoholics present a diverse and complex  microbiota; however, alcoholics harbour significantly higher levels of periodontopathic species in the subgingival microbiota than non-alcoholics.

TI  == comparison of the use of the halimeter and the oral chroma in the assessment of the ability of common cultivable oral anaerobic bacteria to produce malodorous volatile sulfur compounds from cysteine and methionine.
AB  == objective: to compare the use of the halimeter and the oral chroma to assess the  ability of common oral anaerobic bacteria isolated from the kuwaiti population to produce volatile sulfur compounds (vscs). materials and methods: broth cultures of common anaerobes isolated from supragingival plaque were centrifuged and pellets resuspended in phosphate buffer (ph 7.7) with an optical density od(550)  of 0.3. 100 mul of this suspension and 870 mul of buffer were added in 2 sterile  15-ml head space vials. reaction was initiated by addition of 30 mul of 33 mml-methionine and l-cysteine, respectively, in each vial and incubation at 37 degrees c for 90 min. 500 mul of 3 m phosphoric acid was added to tubes and was kept aside for 10 min. production of vscs was measured using the halimeter and the oral chroma. results: the major vsc producers identified by both halimeter and oral chroma with l-cystenine as substrate were campylobacter ureolyticus, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, prevotella intermedia, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and gemella morbillorum. the concentrations of hydrogen sulfide recorded by both halimeter and oral chroma were essentially identical. with l-methionine as substrate, both halimeter and oral chroma identified different complements of anaerobes with c. ureolyticus,p. gingivalis,fusobacterium nucleatum and p. intermedia as major vsc producers. the  concentrations of methyl mercaptan recorded by the halimeter were lower compared  to those assessed by the oral chroma. conclusion: the results suggest that the oral chroma may produce a more comprehensive assessment of vsc production by oral microflora than the halimeter.

TI  == periodontal status of patients with dentin dysplasia type i: report of three cases within a family.
AB  == background: dentin dysplasia type i (ddi) is a rare hereditary disturbance of dentin formation. it is characterized by clinically normal-appearing crowns; obliteration of pulp chambers; and short, blunted and malformed roots that are commonly associated with periodontal attachment loss (pal). in this context, we report three cases within a family with similar clinical and radiographic features of ddi but with differing microbiologic and periodontal conditions. methods: a 42-year-old white female and her two daughters (25 and 10 years of age) presented with a diagnosis of ddi. probing depth (pd), clinical attachment level (cal), visible plaque, and bleeding on probing (bop) were recorded. subgingival biofilm samples were randomly collected and analyzed by checkerboard  dna-dna hybridization. results: the mother presented 34.9% of sites with pd > or  =4 mm, 41.3% of sites with cal > or =4 mm, and 57% of sites with bop; both daughters presented no sites with pd or cal >3 mm and <10% of sites with bop. microbiologic analysis detected gemella morbillorum, neisseria mucosa, and staphylococcus aureus in > or =50% of the mother's samples. the daughters showed  high levels (>10(4) bacterial cells) of some periodontopathic bacteria, including members of the red (porphyromonas gingivalis) and orange (fusobacterium periodonticum and f. nucleatum polymorphum) complexes and beneficial species of the yellow (streptococcus gordonii) and purple (veillonella parvula) complexes. the mother presented high mean levels only for four tested species (n. mucosa, prevotella melaninogenica, treponema denticola, and v. parvula). conclusion: a combination of radiographs, microbiologic analysis, and preventive professional monitoring care is important to avoid pal and to provide oral health in patients  with ddi.

TI  == effects of glass ionomer and microfilled composite subgingival restorations on periodontal tissue and subgingival biofilm: a 6-month evaluation.
AB  == background: this 6-month study evaluated the effects of resin-modified glass-ionomer cement (rmgi) and microfilled composite (mc) subgingival restorations on periodontal tissues and subgingival biofilm. methods: fifty-four  periodontally healthy patients were assigned as follows: group 1 (n = 18), root exposure (re) without non-carious cervical lesions (nccl) treated with coronally  positioned flap (cpf); group 2 (n = 18), re with nccl treated rmgi restorations plus cpf; group 3 (n = 18), re with nccl treated with mc restorations plus cpf. probing depth (pd), visible local plaque score (pl), and local bleeding on probing (bop) were assessed at baseline and 6 months after surgeries. restored and non-restored root recoverage (rr) was assessed at 6 months. each experimental tooth was subgingivally sampled (baseline and 6 months) and analyzed by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. results: clinical results showed no significant differences among the groups regarding pl, bop, and pd at baseline and 6 months. the rr means were similar among the groups at 6 months. intragroup  analyses revealed that the proportions of 10 periodontopathogens decreased at 6 months for the control group. for the rmgi group, there was a significant decrease in the proportions of nine periodontopathogens. for the mc group, there  was a significant increase in the proportions of fusobacterium nucleatum polymorphum and gemella morbillorum and a decrease in five periodontopathogens. intergroup analyses showed an increase in the proportion of f. nucleatum polymorphum for the mc group. conclusions: in a 6-month evaluation, well-finished rmgi or mc subgingival restorations did not negatively affect periodontal health. furthermore, rmgi seems to exert more positive effects on the subgingival biofilm composition than mc.

TI  == subgingival plaque microbiota in hiv positive patients.
AB  == aim: to describe and compare the predominant bacterial and fungal species associated with gingivitis, periodontitis, and linear gingival erythema (lge), in hiv positive subjects with different immune status. methods: viral loads and cd4  levels determined hiv disease status. from pooled subgingival plaque, 16s and 18s rdna were cloned and sequenced to determine species identity. results: one hundred and nine bacterial species were identified from 14 subjects. nearly half  of the species were not cultivable. notably, the classical putative periodontal pathogens, treponema denticola, porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythia were below the limit of detection and were not detected. species of gemella, dialister, streptococcus and veillonella were predominant. in one hiv positive subject with periodontitis and low viral load, gemella morbillorum, a known opportunistic pathogen, constituted 84% of the clones. saccharomyces cerevisiae was the only fungal species detected in an lge subject and in periodontitis subjects with high viral loads. in periodontitis patients with low viral loads, candida albicans was predominant, while s. cerevisiae was only a minor component. conclusion: these case studies suggest that other bacterial species, rather than  the classical periodontal pathogens, may be involved in periodontal diseases of subjects with hiv. these data are indicative of opportunistic infections in a highly susceptible immunocompromised host.

TI  == antibiotic resistance profile of the subgingival microbiota following systemic or local tetracycline therapy.
AB  == background: tetracyclines have been extensively used as adjunctives to conventional periodontal therapy. emergence of resistant strains, however, has been reported. this study evaluated longitudinally the tetracycline resistance patterns of the subgingival microbiota of periodontitis subjects treated with systemic or local tetracycline therapy+scaling and root planing (srp). methods: thirty chronic periodontitis patients were randomly assigned to three groups: srp+500 mg of systemic tetracycline twice/day for 14 days; srp alone and srp+tetracycline fibers (actsite) at four selected sites for 10 days. subgingival plaque samples were obtained from four sites with probing pocket depths (ppd)> or =6 mm in each patient at baseline, 1 week, 3, 6 and 12 months post-therapy. samples were dispersed and diluted in pre-reduced anaerobically sterilized ringer's solution, plated on trypticase soy agar (tsa)+5% blood with or without 4 microg/ml of tetracycline and incubated anaerobically for 10 days. the percentage of resistant microorganisms were determined and the isolates identified by dna probes and the checkerboard method. significance of differences among and within  groups over time was sought using the kruskal-wallis and friedman tests, respectively. results: the percentage of resistant microorganisms increased significantly at 1 week in the tetracycline groups, but dropped to baseline levels over time. the srp+actsite group presented the lowest proportions of resistant species at 6 and 12 months. no significant changes were observed in the srp group. the predominant tetracycline-resistant species included streptococcus  spp., veillonela parvula, peptostreptococcus micros, prevotella intermedia, gemella morbillorum and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa). a high percentage of sites with resistant aa, porphyromonas gingivalis and tanerella forsythensis was observed in all groups at baseline. however, t. forsythensis was not detected in any group and p. gingivalis was not present in the srp+actsite group at 1 year post-therapy. aa was still frequently detected in all groups after therapy. however, the greatest reduction was observed in the srp+actsite group. conclusion: local or systemically administered tetracycline results in transitory selection of subgingival species intrinsically resistant to this drug. although the percentage of sites harboring periodontal pathogens resistant to tetracycline were quite elevated in this population, both therapies were effective in reducing their prevalence over time.

TI  == association of early onset periodontitis microbiota with aspartate aminotransferase activity in gingival crevicular fluid.
AB  == objectives: the objective of this study was to determine the relationship between the activity of the enzyme aspartate aminotransferase (ast) in gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) using the colorimetric periogard (ptm) test and the subgingival microflora in early onset periodontitis lesions. material and methods: the study population consisted of 25 otherwise healthy individuals exhibiting early onset periodontitis (eop). in each patient four experimental sites were identified comprising one deep periodontal pocket (pd >5 mm) randomly  chosen in each quadrant. bacterial samples were obtained from the experimental sites, consecutively cultured anaerobically and in 10% co(2) using selective and  nonselective media. isolates were characterized to species level by conventional  biochemical tests and various identification kits. clinical measurements as well  as ast activity, assessed either as positive or negative using the ptm, were recorded at the same sites. results: sixty-two sites exhibited ast positive and 38 ast negative activity. analysis of bacterial counts using the anova (mann whitney u-test) showed that streptococcus intermedius, peptostreptococcus micros, campylobacter concisus, bacteroides forsythus, camplobacter gracilis, campylobacter rectus and selenomonas sputigena were significantly higher in sites with ast-positive activity. the odds ratio of having high prevalence of s. intermedius, p. micros, c. concisus, b. forsythus, c. gracilis, c. rectus and s.  sputigena in the presence of a positive ast site was very high (range: 3.5-17.0). streptococcus sanguis, actinomyces naeslundii, gemella morbillorum, capnocytophaga gingivalis, veillonella parvula, fusobacterium varium, eubacterium lentum and prevotella oralis were detected in significantly higher proportions in sites with ast negative activity and manifested a negative odds ratio in the presence of ast positive sites. the logistic regression analysis revealed that smoking and bleeding upon probing showed a significant association with ast activity, while plaque and suppuration were not found to be significant predictors of ast activity. the co-infection of porphyromonas gingivalis, b. forsythus and p. micros, or p. gingivalis, b. forsythus and c. rectus were found  to be significantly associated with the ast activity (p<0.001). ast positive sites revealed significantly higher occurrence of co-infections by p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, s. sputigena or by p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, s. intermedius than ast negative sites (p<0.001). p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, a. naeslundii co-infection was found significantly higher in the ast negative sites (p<0.001).  conclusions: the present study found a high level of agreement between the presence of putative periodontal pathogens and positive ast scores at periodontal sites that clinically were considered to be potentially disease active. prospective studies should be performed to confirm the findings.
