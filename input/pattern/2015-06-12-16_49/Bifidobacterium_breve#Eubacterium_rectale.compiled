TI  - Effect of a new synbiotic mixture on atopic dermatitis in infants: a randomized-controlled trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clinical trials investigating the therapeutic effect of probiotics on atopic dermatitis (AD) show inconsistent results. Better results can possibly be achieved by combining probiotics with prebiotics, i.e. synbiotics. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the therapeutic effect of a synbiotic mixture on the severity of AD in infants. METHODS: In a double-blind, placebo-controlled multi-centre trial, 90 infants with AD [SCORing Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) score > or =15], aged < 7 months and exclusively formula fed, were randomly assigned to receive either an extensively hydrolysed formula with Bifidobacterium breve M-16V and a galacto-/fructooligosaccharide mixture (Immunofortis), or the same formula without synbiotics for 12 weeks. The primary outcome was severity of AD, assessed using the SCORAD index. A secondary outcome measure was intestinal microbiota composition. RESULTS: There was no difference in SCORAD score improvement between the synbiotic and the placebo group. The synbiotic group did have a significantly higher percentage of bifidobacteria (54.7% vs. 30.1%, P<0.001) and significantly lower percentages of Clostridium lituseburense/Clostridium histolyticum (0.5 vs. 1.8, P=0.02) and Eubacterium rectale/Clostridium coccoides (7.5 vs. 38.1, P<0.001) after intervention than the placebo group. In the subgroup of infants with IgE-associated AD (n=48), SCORAD score improvement was significantly greater in the synbiotic than in the placebo group at week 12 (-18.1 vs. -13.5 points, P=0.04). CONCLUSIONS: This synbiotic mixture does not have a beneficial effect on AD severity in infants, although it does successfully modulate their intestinal microbiota. Further randomized-controlled trials should explore a possible beneficial effect in IgE-associated AD.
TI  - Selective colonization of insoluble substrates by human faecal bacteria.
AB  - Insoluble plant polysaccharides and endogenous mucin are important energy sources for human colonic microorganisms. The object of this study was to determine whether or not specific communities colonize these substrates. Using faecal samples from four individuals as inocula for an anaerobic in vitro continuous flow system, the colonization of wheat bran, high amylose starch and porcine gastric mucin was examined. Recovered substrates were extensively washed and the remaining tightly attached bacterial communities were identified using polymerase chain reaction-amplified 16S rRNA gene sequences and fluorescent in situ hybridization. The substrate had a major influence on the species of attached bacteria detected. Sequences retrieved from bran were dominated by clostridial cluster XIVa bacteria, including uncultured relatives of Clostridium hathewayi, Eubacterium rectale and Roseburia species. Bacteroides species were also detected. The most abundant sequences recovered from starch were related to the cultured species Ruminococcus bromii, Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Bifidobacterium breve and E. rectale. The most commonly recovered sequences from mucin were from Bifidobacterium bifidum and uncultured bacteria related to Ruminococcus lactaris. This study suggests that a specific subset of bacteria is likely to be the primary colonizers of particular insoluble colonic substrates. For a given substrate, however, the primary colonizing species may vary between host individuals.
TI  - Analysis of intestinal flora of a patient with congenital absence of the portal vein.
AB  - A 14-year-old female patient, admitted for a closer examination of liver tumour (hepatocellular adenoma), was diagnosed as having a congenital absence of the portal vein. The blood ammonia level (approximately 120 micrograms dl-1) in the superior mesenteric vein was markedly low compared to the normal value of 300-350 micrograms dl-1 in the portal vein. The decreased ammonia concentration and urease activity of the patient's faeces were demonstrated. The dominant intestinal flora in the faeces of the patient, before operation, was Bifidobacterium sp., Bifidobacterium breve, Bifidobacterium lonqum, Lactobacillus plantarum, and after the operation Bacteroides vulgatus, Veillonella parvula, Peptococcus magnus Bifidobacterium longum. In contrast, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bacteroides ureolyticus, Bacteroides ovatus and Bacteroides distasonis, B. ovatus, Bifidobacterium adolescentis were dominant flora in the faeces of two healthy volunteers, respectively. Among microorganisms isolated from the patient, Morganella morganii, Candida sp., Eubacterium aerofacience and Eubacterium rectale were strongly positive in urease activity in vitro; Streptococcus mitior, Staphylococcus intermedius, Micrococcus kristinae, Selenomonas ruminantum, Bacteroides ureolyticus and Lactobacillus casei ss. pseudoplantarum from the healthy volunteers. These results imply the homeostatic regulation system of faecal ammonia concentration by urease-producing microorganisms in the patient.
