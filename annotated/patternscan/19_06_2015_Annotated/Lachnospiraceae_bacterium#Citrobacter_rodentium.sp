TI  == fermented dairy products modulate citrobacter rodentium-induced colonic hyperplasia.
AB  == we evaluated the protective effects of fermented dairy products (fdps) in an infection model, using the mouse pathogen citrobacter rodentium (cr). treatment of mice with fdp formulas a, b, and c or a control product did not affect cr colonization, organ specificity, or attaching and effacing lesion formation. fermented dairy product a (fdp-a), but neither the supernatant from fdp-a nor beta-irradiated (ir) fdp-a, caused a significant reduction in colonic crypt hyperplasia and cr-associated pathology. profiling the gut microbiota revealed that ir-fdp-a promoted higher levels of phylotypes belonging to alcaligenaceae and a decrease in lachnospiraceae (ruminococcus) during cr infection. conversely, fdp-a prevented a decrease in ruminococcus and increased turicibacteraceae (turicibacter). importantly, loss of ruminococcus and turicibacter has been associated with susceptibility to dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis. our results demonstrate that viable bacteria in fdp-a reduced cr-induced colonic crypt hyperplasia and prevented the loss of key bacterial genera that may contribute to disease pathology.
