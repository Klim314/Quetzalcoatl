TI  == probiotic table olives: microbial populations adhering on olive surface in fermentation sets inoculated with the probiotic strain lactobacillus paracasei impc2.1 in an industrial plant.
AB  == this study reports the dynamics of microbial populations adhering on the surface  of debittered green olives cv. bella di cerignola in fermentation sets inoculated with the probiotic strain lactobacillus paracasei impc2.1 in different brining conditions (4% and 8% (w/v) nacl) at room temperature and 4 degrees c. the probiotic strain successfully colonized the olive surface dominating the natural  lab population and decreasing the ph of brines to <or=5.0 after 30 days until the end of fermentation. the dynamics of microbial populations associated with olive  surface and belonging to the different groups indicated that inoculated olives held at room temperature did not host enterobacteriaceae at the end of fermentation. yeast populations were present in a low number (<or=log(10) 5.7 cfu/g) throughout the process. a considerable genetic diversity of lab species colonizing the olive surface was found mainly in inoculated set brined in 8% nacl, as indicated by the shannon diversity index calculated for each set. generally, strains of lactobacillus coryniformis, l. paracasei, l. plantarum, l.  pentosus, l. rhamnosus, l. brevis, l. mali, l. vaccinostercus, l.casei, leuconostoc mesenteroides, leuc. pseudomesenteroides, lactococcus lactis, weissella paramesenteroides, w. cibaria, enterococcus casseliflavus group and e.  italicus were identified during the whole process. in particular, l. pentosus was the most frequently isolated species and it showed a high strain diversity throughout fermentation in all processes except for the one held at 4 degrees c.  also a notable incidence of leuc. mesenteroides on olives was highlighted in this study during all fermentation. results indicated that the human strain l. paracasei impc2.1 can be considered an example of a strain used in the dual role  of starter and probiotic culture which allowed the control of fermentation processes and the realization of a final probiotic product with functional appeal.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of enterococcus species isolated from slovak bryndza cheese.
AB  == three hundred and ten enterococcal isolates (178 enterococcus faecium, 68 e. durans, 49 e. faecalis, 8 e. italicus, 3 e. gallinarum, 3 e. casseliflavus, and 1 e. hirae) from slovak bryndza cheese were evaluated for susceptibility to nine antimicrobial agents (vancomycin, teicoplanin, ampicillin, streptomycin, gentamicin, erythromycin, rifampicin, nitrofurantoin, and ciprofloxacin). all enterococcal isolates from bryndza cheese were susceptible to ampicillin, streptomycin, gentamicin, vancomycin, and teicoplanin as determined by the disk diffusion method. vancomycin resistance genes vana and vanb were not detected. resistance rates of enterococcal isolates to rifampicin, erythromycin, ciprofloxacin, and nitrofurantoin were 24, 26, 2, and 1 %, respectively. thirty-six % of e. faecium isolates and 22 % of the e. faecalis isolates were resistant to erythromycin. resistance to rifampicin was similar in e. faecium (31 %) and e. faecalis (29 %). both e. faecium and e. faecalis strains showed the same resistance to ciprofloxacin (2 %). e. durans isolates showed low levels of resistance to rifampicin, erythromycin, ciprofloxacin, and nitrofurantoin (1-4 %). forty-eight (30 %) of the e. faecium isolates, two (3 %) of the e. durans isolates, and six (12 %) of the e. faecalis isolates exhibited multidrug resistance. the highest frequency of resistant enterococci was observed in bryndza produced in winter season.

TI  == molecular identification and diversity of enterococci isolated from slovak bryndza cheese.
AB  == three hundred and eight presumed enterococcal isolates were recovered from bryndza, a soft sheep milk cheese. the cheese samples were obtained from five different commercial distributors in slovakia and were taken at three different seasonal intervals. all isolates were identified to the species level using genotypic tools. species-specific pcr using ddl genes highlighted the predominance of enterococcus faecium (176 isolates) and assigned 50 isolates to the species enterococcus faecalis. the remaining 82 isolates were classified using repetitive element sequence-based polymerase chain reaction (pcr) with primer (gtg)(5)-(gtg)(5)-pcr, in combination with phenylalanyl-trna synthase gene (phes) sequence analysis and by whole-cell protein analysis (sds-page). these strains were identified as enterococcus durans (59 strains), enterococcus italicus (8 strains), enterococcus casseliflavus (3 strains), enterococcus gallinarum (3 strains), enterococcus hirae (1 strain), and 8 strains were members of the species lactococcus lactis. of the seven enterococcal species isolated, three of them, e. durans, e. faecalis and e. faecium were present in all samples  studied, with e. faecium as the predominant one. the precise identification of enterococci in bryndza cheese is an essential step in the process of evaluation of their functional properties which will be further studied and assessed.

TI  == reclassification of enterococcus flavescens pompei et al. 1992 as a later synonym of enterococcus casseliflavus (ex vaughan et al. 1979) collins et al. 1984 and enterococcus saccharominimus vancanneyt et al. 2004 as a later synonym of enterococcus italicus fortina et al. 2004.
AB  == the taxonomic relatedness between the species enterococcus casseliflavus and enterococcus flavescens and between enterococcus italicus and enterococcus saccharominimus was investigated. literature data had already indicated the synonymy between e. casseliflavus and e. flavescens, but this observation had not been formally published. additional evidence that the two taxa represent a single species was provided by comparison of the partial sequences for three housekeeping genes, phenylalanyl-trna synthase alpha subunit (phes), rna polymerase alpha subunit (rpoa) and the alpha subunit of atp synthase (atpa). additional genomic data derived from dna-dna hybridization demonstrated that the  two species are synonymous. for e. italicus and e. saccharominimus, two recently  described taxa, a high 16s rrna gene sequence similarity of >99% and analogous phenotypic features indicated a close taxonomic relatedness. the same multilocus  sequence analysis scheme for the three housekeeping genes was also applied for e. italicus and e. saccharominimus and indicated possible conspecificity, an observation that was also confirmed by a high dna-dna hybridization value (>or=78%). data from the present study led to the proposal that e. flavescens should be reclassified as a later synonym of e. casseliflavus and that e. saccharominimus should be reclassified as a later synonym of e. italicus.
