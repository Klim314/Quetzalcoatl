interactions of salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar typhimurium with  gut bacteria.
the aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of the gut microbiota on the growth and survival of s. typhimurium. this was tested in two-species co-cultures and in mixed cultures with a simplified gut model microbiota. subsequently, interactions between s. typhimurium and human faecal bacteria were quantified in both batch and continuous culture systems simulating the human colon. the exponential growth of s. typhimurium was halted when the population of escherichia coli reached the maximum population density in a two-compartment co-culture system where the two species were separated by a 0.45 mum pore membrane. furthermore, the growth of some gut bacteria such as lactobacillus gasseri and bifidobacterium bifidum was inhibited by the presence of s. typhimurium in the other compartment. the survival of s. typhimurium was severely affected in mixed batch cultures with human faecal samples; a reduction of 10(3)-10(4) cfu/ml in the concentration of s. typhimurium was observed in these cultures. however, no effect on s. typhimurium survival was observed in mixed batch cultures with a simplified gut model microbiota under the same conditions. the effect of human faecal samples on s. typhimurium in a three-stage continuous culture was different to that obtained in batch cultures; its growth rather than survival was affected under these conditions. s. typhimurium growth was inhibited, and the bacterium was therefore eliminated by the continuous flow of the medium. depending upon culturing conditions, the gut microbiota caused either growth inhibition, inactivation or did not affect s. typhimurium.
bactericidal activity of mouse alpha-defensin cryptdin-4 predominantly affects noncommensal bacteria.
mouse paneth cell alpha-defensins, termed cryptdins, are secreted into the intestinal lumen, have microbicidal activity, and contribute to intestinal innate immunity. among them, cryptdin-4 (crp4) has the most potent microbicidal activity. in the intestinal lumen, commensal bacteria colonize and elicit beneficial effects in the host. however, the effects of crp4 against commensal bacteria are poorly understood. thus, we investigated the bactericidal activities of crp4 against commensal bacteria compared to noncommensal bacteria. oxidized crp4 showed only minimal or no bactericidal activity against 8 out of 12 commensal bacterial species, including bifidobacterium bifidum and lactobacillus casei. we further addressed a role of the conserved disulfide bonds of crp4 by analyzing reduced crp4 (r-crp4). r-crp4 demonstrated significantly greater bactericidal activities against 7 of 12 commensal bacteria than did oxidized crp4. oxidized crp4 and r-crp4 elicited equivalently potent bactericidal activities against 11 of the 11 noncommensal bacteria tested, such as salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium,and against 5 of 12 commensal bacteria. furthermore, when r-crp4 was exposed to a processing enzyme of cryptdins, i.e. mmp-7, r-crp4 was degraded and the bactericidal activities disappeared. these findings suggest that crp4 has selective bactericidal activities against intestinal microbiota and that the activities are dependent on the disulfide bonds.
a novel galactooligosaccharide mixture increases the bifidobacterial population numbers in a continuous in vitro fermentation system and in the proximal colonic contents of pigs in vivo.
prebiotics are nondigestible food ingredients that encourage proliferation of selected groups of the colonic microflora, thereby altering the composition toward a more beneficial community. in the present study, the prebiotic potential of a novel galactooligosaccharide (gos) mixture, produced by the activity of galactosyltransferases from bifidobacterium bifidum 41171 on lactose, was assessed in vitro and in a parallel continuous randomized pig trial. in situ fluorescent hybridization with 16s rrna-targeted probes was used to investigate changes in total bacteria, bifidobacteria, lactobacilli, bacteroides, and clostridium histolyticum group in response to supplementing the novel gos mixture. in a 3-stage continuous culture system, the bifidobacterial numbers for the first 2 vessels, which represented the proximal and traverse colon, increased (p < 0.05) after the addition of the oligosaccharide mixture. in addition, the oligosaccharide mixture strongly inhibited the attachment of enterohepatic escherichia coli (p < 0.01) and salmonella enterica serotype typhimurium (p < 0.01) to ht29 cells. addition of the novel mixture at 4% (wt:wt) to a commercial diet increased the density of bifidobacteria (p < 0.001) and the acetate concentration (p < 0.001), and decreased the ph (p < 0.001) compared with the control diet and the control diet supplemented with inulin, suggesting a great prebiotic potential for the novel oligosaccharide mixture.
[antimutagenic action of bacteria on mutagenesis induced by 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide in salmonella typhimurium].
it is shown that in the presence of culture liquid and cells of propionibacterium shermanii, p. pentosaceum, p. thoenii, p. coccoides, p. acnes, lactobacillus delbrueckii, streptococcus thermophilus, str. faecalis, bifidobacterium bifidum, and escherichia coli ab 1157 the mutagenicity of 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (4-nqo) in salmonella typhimurium ta 100 decreases significantly. the highest antimutagenic (desmutagenic) activity was found in culture liquid from all strains tested in the logarithmic growth phase; on aging of the cultures their antimutagenic activity decreased. the cells passaged in the medium containing 4-nqo demonstrate a higher antimutagenic activity than the control cells, and this effect is not related to the cell mutation. young cultures of all studied propionic bacteria and of str. faecalis release thiol compounds into medium. thiol accumulation in culture liquid from p. shermanii between 10 and 24 h was accompanied by culture transition to the active growth. over 24 h thiol content decreased. the maximal thiol accumulation by 24 h coincided with the maximal desmutagenic activity of the culture. it is suggested that desmutagenesis of the bacteria studied towards 4-nqo is connected with their production of reducing (possibly, sulfur-containing) compounds that inactivate electrophilic groups of the mutagen.
