TI  == microbial biofilm development on neonatal enteral feeding tubes.
AB  == neonates in intensive care units often require supporting medical devices and antibiotic treatment. the intensive care treatment combined with their immature immune system, the increased permeability of mucosa, and the undeveloped microflora of the gut may render the neonates highly vulnerable to colonisation and subsequent infections when exposed to opportunistic pathogens. these infections may not only be local gastrointestinal infections, but also systematic following translocation from the gastrointestinal system. this could be particularly alarming considering that common antibiotics may not be effective if the causative strain is multi-drug resistant.this chapter reviews our information on the microbial colonization of neonatal feeding tubes. the range of organisms which have been recovered are wide, and while primarily bacterial, fungi such as  candida have also been found. the bacteria are principally staphylococcus spp. and enterobacteriaceae. the enterobacteriaceae isolates are predominantly enterobacter cancerogenus, serratia marcescens, enterobacter hormaechei, escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae. many of these isolates encode for antibiotic resistance; e. hormaechei (ceftazidine and cefotaxime) and s. marcescens strains (amoxicillin and co-amoxiclav).

TI  == enterobacter and klebsiella species isolated from fresh vegetables marketed in valencia (spain) and their clinically relevant resistances to chemotherapeutic agents.
AB  == occurrence of antibiotic-resistant pathogenic or commensal enterobacteria in marketed agricultural foodstuffs may contribute to their incorporation into the food chain and constitutes an additional food safety concern. in this work, we have determined the clinically relevant resistances to 11 common chemotherapeutic agents in enterobacter and klebsiella isolates from fresh vegetables from various sources (supermarkets and greengrocers' shops in valencia, spain). a total of 96  isolates were obtained from 160 vegetables analyzed (50% positive samples): 68 enterobacter isolates (59 e. cloacae, two e. aerogenes, two e. cancerogenus, one  e. gergoviae, and four e. sakazakii, currently cronobacter spp.), and 28 klebsiella isolates (19 k. oxytoca and 9 k. pneumoniae). only seven isolates were susceptible to all agents tested, and no resistances to ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, and chloramphenicol were detected. most isolates were  resistant to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (74 [58 enterobacter and 16 klebsiella]) or to ampicillin (80 [55/25]). other resistances were less frequent: nitrofurantoin (13 isolates [12/1]), tetracycline (6 [5/1]), co-trimoxazole (3 [3/0]), cefotaxime (1 [1/0]), and streptomycin (2 [1/1]). multiresistant isolates to two (56 [41/15]), three (10 e. cloacae isolates), four (one e. cloacae and one k. pneumoniae isolate), and five (two e. cloacae isolates) chemotherapeutic agents were also detected. the presence of potential pathogens points to marketed fresh produce, which often is eaten raw, as a risk factor for consumer health. in addition, these results support the usefulness of these bacterial species as indicators of the spreading of antibiotic resistances into the environment, particularly in the food chain, and suggest their role as carriers of resistance  determinants from farms to consumers, which may constitute an additional "silent" food safety concern. therefore, there is a need to improve the hygienic quality of marketed fresh vegetables, from better methods to prevent contamination in the farms to the use of sanitizing practices at home.

TI  == comparative study on characteristics of azo dye decolorization by indigenous decolorizers.
AB  == this study provides a first attempt to explore indigenous strains with excellent  decolorization capability from the most biodiverse region in taiwan for dye-bearing wastewater treatment. bacterial isolates were obtained via serial selections under selection pressure of the fungicide nystatin and model textile dye(s). according to profiles of protein expression and pcr-augmented 16s rrna gene analyses for strain identification, >99% of nucleotide sequences in isolated strains were identical to type strains aeromonas hydrophila, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cancerogenus, proteus hauseri, acinetobacter johnsonii.  this first-attempt study not only explored most abundant decolorizers in taiwan,  but also compared their color removal performance for further applications.

TI  == neonatal enteral feeding tubes as loci for colonisation by members of the enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == background: the objective of this study was to determine whether neonatal nasogastric enteral feeding tubes are colonised by the opportunistic pathogen cronobacter spp. (enterobacter sakazakii) and other enterobacteriaceae, and whether their presence was influenced by the feeding regime. methods: one hundred and twenty-nine tubes were collected from two neonatal intensive care units (nicu). a questionnaire on feeding regime was completed with each sample. enterobacteriaceae present in the tubes were identified using conventional and molecular methods, and their antibiograms determined. results: the neonates were  fed breast milk (16%), fortified breast milk (28%), ready to feed formula (20%),  reconstituted powdered infant formula (pif, 6%), or a mixture of these (21%). eight percent of tubes were received from neonates who were 'nil by mouth'. organisms were isolated from 76% of enteral feeding tubes as a biofilm (up to 107 cfu/tube from neonates fed fortified breast milk and reconstituted pif) and in the residual lumen liquid (up to 107 enterobacteriaceae cfu/ml, average volume 250 mul). the most common isolates were enterobacter cancerogenus (41%), serratia marcescens (36%), e. hormaechei (33%), escherichia coli (29%), klebsiella pneumoniae (25%), raoultella terrigena (10%), and s. liquefaciens (12%). other organisms isolated included c. sakazakii (2%),yersinia enterocolitica (1%),citrobacter freundii (1%), e. vulneris (1%), pseudomonas fluorescens (1%), and p. luteola (1%). the enteral feeding tubes were in place between < 6 h (22%)  to > 48 h (13%). all the s. marcescens isolates from the enteral feeding tubes were resistant to amoxicillin and co-amoxiclav. of additional importance was that a quarter of e. hormaechei isolates were resistant to the 3rd generation cephalosporins ceftazidime and cefotaxime. during the period of the study, k. pneumoniae and s. marcescens caused infections in the two nicus. conclusion: this study shows that neonatal enteral feeding tubes, irrespective of feeding regime,  act as loci for the bacterial attachment and multiplication of numerous opportunistic pathogens within the enterobacteriaceae family. subsequently, these organisms will enter the stomach as a bolus with each feed. therefore, enteral feeding tubes are an important risk factor to consider with respect to neonatal infections.
