TI  == plantaricin ld1: a bacteriocin produced by food isolate of lactobacillus plantarum ld1.
AB  == plantaricin ld1, a bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus plantarum ld1, was characterized for biochemical and antimicrobial properties. bacteriocin showed stability at high temperatures (100 degrees c for 20 min and 121 degrees c for 15 min under 15 psi pressure), in a ph range of 2.0-8.0 and also in the presence of  organic solvents, surfactants and detergents. the crude preparation was not affected by catalase, amylase and lipase but activity was reduced in the presence of pepsin, trypsin and proteinase k showing proteinaceous nature of the compound. the molecular weight of bacteriocin was found to be approximately 6.5 kda, and antimicrobial activity was confirmed by bioassay. it inhibited not only related strains but also other gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria such as lactobacillus curvatus nrrl b-4562, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis nrrl b-1821, enterococcus faecium nrrl b-2354, enterobacter cloacae nrrl b-14298, micrococcus  luteus, staphylococcus aureus, urogenic escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhi, shigella flexneri and vibrio sp. these properties of plantaricin ld1 suggest its applications not only in food safety but in therapeutics as well.

TI  == development of an informatics platform for therapeutic protein and peptide analytics.
AB  == the momentum gained by research on biologics has not been met yet with equal thrust on the informatics side. there is a noticeable lack of software for data management that empowers the bench scientists working on the development of biologic therapeutics. sarvision|biologics is a tool to analyze data associated with biopolymers, including peptides, antibodies, and protein therapeutics programs. the program brings under a single user interface tools to filter, mine, and visualize data as well as those algorithms needed to organize sequences. as part of the data-analysis tools, we introduce two new concepts: mutation cliffs and invariant maps. invariant maps show the variability of properties when a monomer is maintained constant in a position of the biopolymer. mutation cliff maps draw attention to pairs of sequences where a single or limited number of point mutations elicit a large change in a property of interest. we illustrate the program and its applications using a peptide data set collected from the literature.

TI  == cloning and heterologous expression of plne, -f, -j and -k genes derived from soil metagenome and purification of active plantaricin peptides.
AB  == plantaricin gene-specific primers were used to obtain plne, -f, -j and -k structural gene amplicons from soil metagenome. these amplicons were cloned and expressed in pet32a (+) vector in escherichia coli bl21 (de3). plne, -f, -j and -k peptides were expressed as his-tagged-fusion proteins and were separated by ni(2+) -chelating affinity chromatography. the peptides were released from the fusion by enterokinase cleavage and separated from the carrier thioredoxin. the cleaved peptides were further analysed for antimicrobial activity and found to be active against listeria innocua nrrl b33314, micrococcus luteus mtcc 106 and lactic acid bacteria, such as enterococcus casseliflavus nrrl b3502, lactococcus  lactis lactis nrrl 1821, lactobacillus curvatus nrrl b4562 and lactobacillus plantarum nrrl b4496. e. coli has been successfully exploited as a host for heterologous expression with a significant yield of fused and cleaved peptides in the range of 8-12 and 1-1.5 mg/l of the culture, respectively. heterologous expression, therefore, can be used to overcome the constraints of low yield often reported from a native strain.

TI  == isolation, biochemical characterization, and cloning of a bacteriocin from the poultry-associated staphylococcus aureus strain ch-91.
AB  == staphylococcus aureus strain ch-91, isolated from a broiler chicken with atopic dermatitis, has a highly proteolytic phenotype that is correlated with the disease. we describe the isolation and biochemical and molecular characterization of the ai-type lantibiotic bacch91 from s. aureus ch-91 culture medium. the bacteriocin was purified using a three-stage procedure comprising precipitation with ammonium sulfate, extraction with organic solvents, and reversed-phase hplc. the bacch91 peptide is thermostable and highly resistant to cleavage by both prokaryotic and eukaryotic peptidases. the mic for the gram-positive bacteria ranged from 2.5 nm for microococcus luteus through 1.3-6.0 mum for staphylococcal strains up to more than 100 mum for lactococcus lactis. bacch91 was ineffective against the gram-negative strains tested at the maximal concentration (100 mum).  the amino acid sequence of bacch91 is similar to that of epidermin and gallidermin. the encoding gene (bacch91) occurred in two allelic variants distinguishable in the restriction fragment length polymorphism assay. variant i, identified in s. aureus ch-91, dominated in s. aureus strains of poultry origin,  although strains with variant ii were also identified in this group. s. aureus strains of human origin were characterized exclusively by variant ii.

TI  == optimization of nisin production by lactococcus lactis uq2 using supplemented whey as alternative culture medium.
AB  == lactococcus lactis uq2 is a nisin a-producing native strain. in the present study, the production of nisin by l. lactis uq2 in a bioreactor using supplemented sweet whey (sw) was optimized by a statistical design of experiments and response surface methodology (rsm). in a 1st approach, a fractional factorial design (ffd) of the order 2(5-1) with 3 central points was used. the effect on nisin production of air flow, sw, soybean peptone (sp), mgso(4)/mnso(4) mixture,  and tween 80 was evaluated. from ffd, the most significant factors affecting nisin production were sp (p = 0.011), and sw (p = 0.037). to find optimum conditions, a central composite design (ccd) with 2 central points was used. three factors were considered, sw (7 to 10 g/l), sp (7 to10 g/l), and small amounts of added nisin as self-inducer (ni 34.4 to 74.4 iu/l). nisin production was expressed as international units (iu). from rsm, an optimum nisin activity of 180 iu/ml was predicted at 74.4 iu/l ni, 13.8 g/l sp, and 14.9 or 5.11 g/l sw, while confirmatory experiments showed a maximum activity of 178 +/- 5.2 iu/ml, verifying the validity of the model. the 2nd-order model showed a coefficient of  determination (r(2)) of 0.828. optimized conditions were used for constant ph fermentations, where a maximum activity of 575 +/- 17 iu/ml was achieved at ph 6.5 after 12 h. the adsorption-desorption technique was used to partially purify  nisin, followed by drying. the resulting powder showed an activity of 102150 iu/g. practical application: nisin production was optimized using supplemented whey as alternative culture medium, using a native l. lactis uq2 strain. soybean  peptone, sw, and subinhibitory amounts of nisin were successfully employed to optimize nisin production by l. lactis uq2. dried semipurified nisin showed an activity of 102150 iu/g.

TI  == effectiveness and stability of plastic films coated with nisin for inhibition of  listeria monocytogenes.
AB  == plastic films were coated with a cellulose-based carrier solution containing nisin, a natural antimicrobial peptide with the potential to inhibit growth of food spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms such as listeria monocytogenes. five  commercial plastic films with different chemical compositions and surface properties were compared in this study: low-density polyethylene, ethylene-vinyl  acetate copolymer, and three types of ethylene-methacrylic acid copolymers: surlyn 1601, nucrel 0403, and nucrel 0903. the films were coated with nisin at a  concentration of 1000 iu/cm2. nisin-coated films were stored at room temperature  (21 degrees c) and at 4 degrees c and analyzed weekly for 12 weeks. antimicrobial activity of the different nisin-coated films against a nisin indicator strain, lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris atcc 14365, and against l. monocytogenes atcc  19115 was assessed using an inhibition zone assay. nisin incorporated into the films was recovered by a boiling and extraction procedure, and its activity was quantified using an agar well diffusion assay. film type did not have any significant effect on the antimicrobial activity of the nisin-coated films (p < 0.05); all five film types had comparable inhibition zones on both assays. the films maintained stable activity for the duration of the study, both at room temperature and refrigeration. the results of this study demonstrate that commercially available packaging films can be coated with nisin and the resulting antimicrobial films can be conveniently stored at room temperature with no adverse effect on nisin activity.

TI  == culturable bacteria present in the fluid of the hooded-pitcher plant sarracenia minor based on 16s rdna gene sequence data.
AB  == the culturable microbial community within the pitcher fluid of 93 sarracenia minor carnivorous plants was examined over a 2-year study. many aspects of the plant/bacterial/insect interaction within the pitcher fluid are minimally understood because the bacterial taxa present in these pitchers have not been identified. thirteen isolates were characterized by 16s rdna sequencing and subsequent phylogenetic analysis. the proteobacteria were the most abundant taxa  and included representatives from serratia, achromobacter, and pantoea. the actinobacteria micrococcus was also abundant while bacillus, lactococcus, chryseobacterium, and rhodococcus were infrequently encountered. several isolates conformed to species identifiers (>98% rdna gene sequence similarity) including serratia marcescens (isolates found in 27.5% of pitchers), achromobacter xylosoxidans (37.6%), micrococcus luteus (40.9%), bacillus cereus (isolates found in 10.2%), bacillus thuringiensis (5.4%), lactococcus lactis (17.2%), and rhodococcus equi (2.2%). species-area curves suggest that sampling efforts were sufficient to recover a representative culturable bacterial community. the bacteria present represent a diverse community probably as a result of introduction by insect vectors, but the ecological significance remains under explored.

TI  == characterization of the highly autolytic lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris strains co and 2250.
AB  == two highly autolytic lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris strains (co and 2250) were selected and analyzed for their autolytic properties. both strains showed maximum lysis when grown in m17 broth containing a limiting concentration of glucose (0.4 to 0.5%) as the carbohydrate source. lysis did not vary greatly with ph or temperature but was reduced when strains were grown on lactose or galactose. growth in m17 containing excess glucose (1%) prevented autolysis, although rapid lysis of l. lactis subsp. cremoris co did occur in the presence of 1% glucose if sodium fluoride (an inhibitor of glycolysis) was added to the medium. maximum cell lysis in a buffer system was observed early in the stationary phase, and for co, two ph optima were observed for log-phase and stationary-phase cells (6.5 and 8.5, respectively). autolysins were extracted from the cell wall fraction of each strain by using either 4% sodium dodecyl sulfate (sds), 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, or 4 m lithium chloride, and their activities were analyzed by renaturing sds-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on  gels containing micrococcus luteus or l. lactis subsp. cremoris co cells as the substrate. more than one lytic band was observed on each substrate, with the major band having an apparent molecular mass of 48 kda for co. each lytic band was present throughout growth and lysis. these results suggest that at least two  different autolytic enzymes are present in the autolytic l. lactis subsp. cremoris strains. the presence of the lactococcal cell wall hydrolase gene, acma  (g. buist, j. kok, k. j. leenhouts, m. dabrowska, g. venema, and a. j. haandrikman, j. bacteriol. 177:1554-1563, 1995), in strains 2250 and co was confirmed by southern hybridization. analysis of an acma deletion mutant of 2250  confirmed that the gene was involved in cell separation and had a role in cell lysis.

TI  == nisin-producing lactococcus lactis strains isolated from human milk.
AB  == characterization by partial 16s rrna gene sequencing, ribotyping, and green fluorescent protein-based nisin bioassay revealed that 6 of 20 human milk samples contained nisin-producing lactococcus lactis bacteria. this suggests that the history of humans consuming nisin is older than the tradition of consuming fermented milk products.

TI  == effect of chelators and nisin produced in situ on inhibition and inactivation of  gram negatives.
AB  == the ability of chelators and nisin generated in situ to inhibit and inactivate e. coli and other gram negatives in a model substrate was investigated. the effect of various chelators and different concentrations of exogenous nisin on inhibition of e. coli in broth medium showed that only edta and pyrophosphates were able to cause appreciable inhibition of e. coli by nisin. in a broth where l. lactis ncfb 497 produced nisin in a concentration of 250-300 iu/ml, pyrophosphates were unable to inactivate e. coli. under the same conditions, addition of edta led to inactivation of e. coli at neutral and slightly acidic ph only. a cocktail of strains of e. coli was less sensitive than e. coli atcc 25922 alone. pseudomonas aeruginosa was more sensitive and salmonellae more resistant.  edta also caused a slight reduction in the l. lactis population and its biochemical activity as regards ph drop and acid production. some of the inhibition of e. coli could be ascribed to the physical presence of lactococcus cells rather than their metabolites excreted into the medium. failure to observe  any inhibition in fermented broths at their natural ph (4.0) was ascribed to the  poor chelating power of edta under acid conditions.

TI  == synergistic antimicrobial effect of nisin whey permeate and lactic acid on microbes isolated from fish.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of a combination of lactic acid and whey permeate fermented by a nisin-producing lactococcus lactis strain was tested by the agar diffusion method using bacteria isolated from fish as test organisms. lactic acid inhibited all bacterial strains studied, but nisin whey permeate inhibited gram-positive bacteria only. the combination was more effective than lactic acid  alone against pseudomonas fluorescens and staphylococcus hominis isolated from fish, and pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc9721 and micrococcus luteus atcc9341.

TI  == structure-activity relationships in the peptide antibiotic nisin: role of dehydroalanine 5.
AB  == a mutant of the peptide antibiotic nisin in which the dehydroalanine residue at position 5 has been replaced by an alanine has been produced and structurally characterized. it is shown to have activity very similar to that of wild-type nisin in inhibiting growth of lactococcus lactis and micrococcus luteus but is very much less active than nisin as an inhibitor of the outgrowth of spores of bacillus subtilis. these observations, which parallel those of w. liu and j. n. hansen (appl. environ. microbiol. 59:648-651, 1993) on the corresponding mutant of the related antibiotic subtilin, are discussed in terms of the mechanism(s) of action of these antibiotics.

TI  == structure-activity relationships in the peptide antibiotic nisin: antibacterial activity of fragments of nisin.
AB  == the post-translationally modified peptide antibiotic nisin has been cleaved by a  number of proteases and the fragments produced purified, characterised chemically, and assayed for activity in inhibiting the growth of lactococcus lactis mg1614 and micrococcus luteus ncdo8166. these results provide information  on the importance of different parts of the nisin molecule for its growth-inhibition activity. removal of the c-terminal five residues leads to approximately a 10-fold decrease in potency, while removal of a further nine residues, encompassing two of the lanthionine rings, leads to a 100-fold decrease. there are some differences between analogous fragments of nisin and subtilin, suggesting possible subtle differences in mode of action. cleavage within, or removal of, lanthionine ring c essentially abolishes the activity of nisin. the fragment nisin1-12 is inactive itself, and specifically antagonises the growth-inhibitory action of nisin. these results are discussed in terms of current models for the mechanism of action of nisin.

TI  == improved method for quantification of the bacteriocin nisin.
AB  == nisin, a bacteriocin produced by lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, is used in some types of food preservation due to its inhibitory action on gram-positive bacteria and their spores. a commonly used agar diffusion bioassay technique for  quantification of nisin in food samples was modified to increase its sensitivity, accuracy and precision. several variables were evaluated. results showed micrococcus luteus as the most sensitive organism tested, a lower agar concentration (0 x 75% compared 1 x 5%) increased the sensitivity of the assay (21% improvement over standard method), and incorporation of 1% na2hpo4 buffer into the bioassay agar made it possible to prevent false inhibitory zones from developing due to the low ph of the test solutions. this resulted in a 57% improvement in accuracy and a 12% improvement in precision compared to the standard method.
