TI  - Bacterial community structure associated with elective cesarean section versus vaginal delivery in Chinese newborns.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Increasing attention is being paid to the potential for cesarean birth to influence the taxa of the bacteria that compose the infant intestinal microbiota. The present study characterized the diversity of the intestinal microbiota in newborn infants delivered vaginally (VD) or by cesarean section (CD). METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed using fecal specimens collected on days 2 and 4 of postnatal life from 25 VD infants and 16 CD infants. Profiles of the fecal microbiota were analyzed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis in combination with 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequencing of the clones corresponding to the degenerating gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) bands. RESULTS: On days 2 and 4 of postnatal life, VD and CD infants did not differ in the richness and evenness of the fecal bacterial community; however, the taxa of the fecal microbiota were significantly different between the 2 groups. In VD infants, Escherichia coli, Bacteroides sp, and Bifidobacterium longum were the dominant microbes. In CD infants, Staphylococcus sp, Clostridium sp, Enterobacter sp, and Streptococcus sp were more common. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that delivery method has a profound influence on the structure of the intestinal microbiota in Chinese newborn infants. This is in accordance with data reported in other regions.
TI  - Modulation of small intestinal homeostasis along with its microflora during acclimatization at simulated hypobaric hypoxia.
AB  - At high altitude (HA) hypobaric hypoxic environment manifested several pathophysiological consequences of which gastrointestinal (GI) disorder are very common phenomena. To explore the most possible clue behind this disorder intestinal flora, the major player of the GI functions, were subjected following simulated hypobaric hypoxic treatment in model animal. For this, male albino rats were exposed to 55 kPa (approximately 4872.9 m) air pressure consecutively for 30 days for 8 h/day and its small intestinal microflora, their secreted digestive enzymes and stress induced marker protein were investigated of the luminal epithelia. It was observed that population density of total aerobes significantly decreased, but the quantity of total anaerobes and Escherichia coli increased significantly after 30 days of hypoxic stress. The population density of strict anaerobes like Bifidobacterium sp., Bacteroides sp. and Lactobacillus sp. and obligate anaerobes like Clostridium perfringens and Peptostreptococcus sp. were expanded along with their positive growth direction index (GDI). In relation to the huge multiplication of anaerobes the amount of gas formation as well as content of IgA and IgG increased in duration dependent manner. The activity of some luminal enzymes from microbial origin like a-amylase, gluco-amylase, proteinase, alkaline phosphatase and beta-glucuronidase were also elevated in hypoxic condition. Besides, hypoxia induced in formation of malondialdehyde along with significant attenuation of catalase, glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase activity and lowered GSH/GSSG pool in the intestinal epithelia. Histological study revealed disruption of intestinal epithelial barrier with higher infiltration of lymphocytes in lamina propia and atrophic structure. It can be concluded that hypoxia at HA modified GI microbial imprint and subsequently causes epithelial barrier dysfunction which may relate to the small intestinal dysfunction at HA.

TI  - Analysis of interaction property of calycosin-7-O-beta-D-glucoside with human gut microbiota.
AB  - Calycosin-7-O-beta-d-glucoside as the major isoflavonoids in Astragali Radix has  been investigated intensively and has been reported to possess a wide range of pharmacological properties. However, the route and metabolites of calycosin-7-O-beta-d-glucoside by human intestinal bacteria are not well understood and its metabolites may accumulate to exert physiological effects. Therefore, the objective of this study was to screen the ability of the bacteria to metabolize calycosin-7-O-beta-d-glucoside and assess the effect of this compound on the intestinal bacteria. Finally, five strains including Bacteroides sp.13, and sp.58, Clostridium sp.21-2, Veillonella sp.43-1, and Bacillus sp.46 were isolated from human intestinal bacteria and were studied their abilities to convert calycosin-7-O-beta-d-glucoside. A total of six metabolites were identified in human incubated solution by ultra performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF-MS). The results indicated that hydrolysis, demethylation, dehydroxylation and acetylation were the major metabolism of calycosin-7-O-beta-d-glucoside. On the other hand, different strains of intestinal bacteria have varying degrees of growth sensitivity to calycosin-7-O-beta-d-glucoside. Growth of certain pathogenic bacteria such as Enterobacter, Enterococcus, Clostridium and Bacteroides was significantly repressed by calycosin-7-O-beta-d-glucoside, while commensal probiotics such as Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium were less severely affected. This indicates that calycosin-7-O-beta-d-glucoside exert significant effects on the intestinal environment by modulation of the intestinal bacterial population. Our observation provided further evidence for the importance of intestinal bacteria in the metabolism, absorption and potential activity of calycosin-7-O-beta-d-glucoside in human health and diseases.
TI  - Effect of liquiritin on human intestinal bacteria growth: metabolism and modulation.
AB  - Licorice is one of the oldest and most frequently used prescribed traditional Chimese medicines. However, the route and metabolites of liquiritin by human intestinal microflora are not well understood and its metabolites may accumulate to exert physiological effects. Therefore, our objective was to screen the ability of the bacteria to metabolize liquiritin and assess the effect of this compound on the intestinal bacteria. Finally, six strains, comprising Bacteroides sp. 22 and sp.57, Veillonella sp. 31 and sp.48, Bacillus sp. 46 and Clostridium sp. 51, were isolated and their abilities to convert liquiritin studied. A total of five metabolites were identified using ultra performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry in human incubated solution. The results indicated that hydrolysis, hydrogenation, methylation, deoxygenation and acetylation were the major routes of metabolism of liquiritin. On the other hand, effect of liquiritin on different strains of intestinal bacteria growth was detected using an Emax precision microplate reader. Growth of certain pathogenic bacteria, such as Enterobacter, Enterococcus, Clostridium and Bacteroides, was significantly repressed by liquiritin, while growth of commensal probiotics such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium was less severely affected. Our observation provided further evidence for the importance of intestinal bacteria in the metabolism, and the potential activity of liquiritin in human health and disease.
TI  - Description of Anaerobacterium chartisolvens gen. nov., sp. nov., an obligately anaerobic bacterium from Clostridium rRNA cluster III isolated from soil of a Japanese rice field, and reclassification of Bacteroides cellulosolvens Murray et al. 1984 as Pseudobacteroides cellulosolvens gen. nov., comb. nov.
AB  - An obligately anaerobic bacterial strain designated T-1-35(T) was isolated as a dominant cultivable cellulose-degrading bacterium from soil of a Japanese rice field as an anaerobic filter-paper degrader. Cells of strain T-1-35(T) stained Gram-positive and were non-spore-forming rods with rounded ends, 0.8-1.0x3.5-15.0 microm, and motile by means of two to four polar flagella. Cells of strain T-1-35(T) exhibited pleomorphism: in aged cultures (over 90 days of incubation), almost all cells were irregularly shaped. Although no spore formation was observed, cells tolerated high temperatures, up to 90 degrees C for 10 min. The temperature range for growth was 15-40 degrees C, with an optimum at 35 degrees C. The pH range for growth was 5.5-9.0, with an optimum at pH 8.0-8.5 (slightly alkaliphilic). Strain T-1-35(T) fermented some carbohydrates to produce ethanol and lactate as the major products. Major cellular fatty acids were iso-C16 : 0 and iso-C13 : 0 3-OH. Phylogenetic analysis based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence revealed that strain T-1-35(T) belonged to Clostridium rRNA cluster III. The closest relative of strain T-1-35(T) was Bacteroides cellulosolvens WM2(T), with 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity of 93.4 %. Phenotypic, physiological and molecular genetic methods demonstrated that strain T-1-35(T) was distinct from its phylogenetic relatives (members of Clostridium rRNA cluster III) because it predominantly produced ethanol, iso-C13 : 0 3-OH was a major cellular fatty acid and it always exhibited pleomorphism. On the basis of the results of a polyphasic taxonomic study, strain T-1-35(T) is considered to represent a novel genus and species, Anaerobacterium chartisolvens gen. nov., sp. nov. The type strain of Anaerobacterium chartisolvens is T-1-35(T) ( = DSM 27016(T) = NBRC 109520(T)). In addition, from the results of our phylogenetic analysis and its phenotypic features, the species Bacteroides cellulosolvens Murray et al. 1984 is proposed to be reclassified in the new genus Pseudobacteroides as Pseudobacteroides cellulosolvens gen. nov., comb. nov., with the type strain WM2(T) ( = ATCC 35603(T) = DSM 2933(T) = NRCC 2944(T)).
TI  - Time-dependent post mortem changes in the composition of intestinal bacteria using real-time quantitative PCR.
AB  - Post mortem or even normal changes during life occurring in major gut bacterial populations are not known. We investigated Bacteroides sp., Bifidobacterium sp., Clostridium leptum, Clostridium coccoides, Streptococcus sp., Lactobacillus sp. and Enterobacteriacaea ratios in 7 fecal samples from healthy volunteers and in 61 autopsies rectum and cecum samples and studied the effect of post mortem time using quantitative real-time PCR. Bacterial ratios in stool samples from volunteers and rectum samples from autopsy cases were similar and did not change significantly up to 5 days post mortem. In cecum, significant post mortem time-dependent differences were observed in ratios of Bacteroides sp. (p = 0.014) and Lactobacillus sp. (p = 0.024). Our results showed that ratios of Bacteroides sp., Bifidobacterium sp., Clostridium leptum, Clostridium coccoides, Streptococcus sp., Lactobacillus sp. and Enterobacteriacaea can be investigated in autopsy rectum samples up to 5 days after death.
TI  - Oral administration of heparin or heparosan increases the Lactobacillus population in gut microbiota of rats.
AB  - Heparin and heparosan have been confirmed to be effective blockers in inhibiting  adhesion of pathogens in vitro. However, their effects on gut microbiota in vivo remain unknown. Here we have studied the effects of oral administration of heparin or heparosan on gut microbiota in rats by polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE). Results showed that the predominant bacterial communities in the feces of heparin- or heparosan-treated animals were different from those of the saline-treated animals, with increased Lactobacillus spp. and decreased Enterococcus sp. Different DGGE banding patterns were also observed for the subpopulations of Lactobacillus and Bacteroides groups. In conclusion, heparin or heparosan may be used as an effective gut microbiota modulator by increasing the subpopulation of Lactobacillus.
TI  - Characterization of microbial community in the leachate associated with the decomposition of entombed pigs.
AB  - Foot and mouth disease (FMD) is one of the acute infectious diseases in hoofed and even-toed mammals, including pigs, and it occurs via acute infection by Aphthovirus. When FMD is suspected, animals around the location of origin are typically slaughtered and buried. Other methods such as rendering, composting, and incineration have not been verified in practice in Korea. After the FMD incident, the regular monitoring of the microbial community is required, as microorganisms greatly modify the characteristics of the ecosystem in which they live. This is the result of their metabolic activities causing chemical changes to take place in the surrounding environment. In this study, we investigated changes in the microbial community during a 24 week period with DNA extracts from leachate, formed by the decomposition of buried pigs at a laboratory test site, using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) with a genomic DNA. Our results revealed that Bacteroides coprosuis, which is common in pig excreta, and Sporanaerobacter acetigenes, which is a sulfur-reduced microbe, were continuously observed. During the early stages (0~2 weeks) of tissue decomposition, Clostridium cochlearium, Fusobacterium ulcerans, and Fusobacterium sp., which are involved in skin decomposition, were also observed. In addition, various microbes such as Turicibacter sanguinis, Clostridium haemolyticum, Bacteroides propionicifaciens, and Comamonas sp. were seen during the later stages (16~24 weeks). In particular, the number of existing microbial species gradually increased during the early stages, including the exponential phase, decreased during the middle stages, and then increased again during the later stages. Therefore, these results indicate that the decomposition of pigs continues for a long period of time and leachate is created continuously during this process. It is known that leachate can easily flow into the neighboring environment, so a long-term management plan is needed in burial locations for FMD-infected animals.
TI  - [Assessment of susceptibility of strictly anaerobic bacteria originated from different sources to fluoroquinolones and other antimicrobial drugs].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: During the past 20 years, several studies at a national level in different countries followed resistance trends for Bacteroides sp. and Clostridium difficile. This study analysed antimicrobial susceptibility 73 anaerobic bacteria strains of Bacteroides fragilis group (BFG) and C. difficile to fluoroquinolones and other antimicrobial drugs. METHODS: The strictly anaerobes strains isolated in different hospitals were sent to the Department of Medical Microbiology, Medical Uniwersity of Warsaw, where species determination was carried out with the API20 ANA (bioMerieux SA, Marcy-l'Etoile, France) system. Susceptibility to antimicrobials was determined using E-test. RESULTS: The rates of high resistance to ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin of BFG was respectively 84% and 31% and among of C. difficile strains respectively 92% and 36%). The percentage of BFG strains resistant to erythromycin and clindamycin were respectively 84% and 46%. The percentage of C. difficile strains resistant to erythromycin and clindamycin was 52%. Reduced level of susceptibility of BFG strains to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (8%) was confirmed. Resistance to cefoxitin was 16% of BFG strains. All tested strains as well as BFG and C. difficile were susceptible to metronidazole. Was observed reduced leve (EUCAST) of susceptibility of C. difficile strains to vancomycin (13%). CONCLUSIONS. Increasing resistance to various antimicrobial agents is a significant problem in Poland. This demonstrate the need to continue with antibiotic resistance testing and surveys in anaerobic bacteria.
TI  - Green-lipped mussel extract (Perna canaliculus) and glucosamine sulphate in patients with knee osteoarthritis: therapeutic efficacy and effects on gastrointestinal microbiota profiles.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate how changes in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) microbiota profile may influence nutraceutical efficacy in osteoarthritis (OA) and allow the formulation of a hypothesis that explains in part the inconsistent and contentious findings from OA clinical studies with green-lipped mussel (GLM) and glucosamine. METHODS: A non-blinded randomised clinical trial was conducted with 38 subjects diagnosed with knee OA. Each participant received either 3,000 mg/day of a whole GLM extract or 3,000 mg/day of glucosamine sulphate (GS), p.o. for 12 weeks. Faecal microbial analyses were carried out after collecting stools at T (0) and T (12) weeks. Additional pharmacometric measures were obtained from changes in arthritic scores in the Western Ontario McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) and the Lequesne algofunctional indices and the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS). An intention-to-treat analysis was employed and participant data collected at T (0), T (6) and T (12) weeks. RESULTS: There were no statistically significant changes in bacterial growth patterns determined by the Wilcoxon test. In both groups there was a trend towards a decrease in Clostridium and Staphylococcus species and increase in Lactobacillus, Streptococcus and Eubacterium species. In the GLM group Bifidobacterium tended to increase and Enterococcus and yeast species to decrease. The GS-treated group demonstrated a trend towards a decrease in Bacteroides and an increase in yeasts and Coliforms species, most notably Escherichia coli. We further confirm significant improvement (p < 0.05) in all OA outcome measures from T (0) to T (12) weeks for both the GLM and GS groups. The GSRS scores indicated that GIT function significantly improved over the 12 weeks duration with GLM and GS supplementation. CONCLUSION: Both GLM and GS reduced OA symptoms and non-significantly altered the gut microbiota profile from baseline. Changes in the microbiota profiles occurred in both treatment groups; the most notable being a reduction in the Clostridia sp. This study suggests that nutritional supplements such as GLM and GS may regulate some of the metabolic and immunological activities of the GIT microbiota. The decrease in Clostridia, a potent modulator of colonic Th17 and CD4+ regulatory T cells, was consistent with a decrease in inflammation; improved GSRS scores and OA symptoms for these OA participants. The GIT microbiota may be important factor in the first-pass metabolism of these nutraceuticals.
TI  - Electricity generation from cattle dung using microbial fuel cell technology during anaerobic acidogenesis and the development of microbial populations.
AB  - A microbial fuel cell (MFC) was constructed to investigate the possible generation of electricity using cattle dung as a substrate. After 30 days of operation, stable electricity was generated, and the maximum volumetric power density was 0.220 W/m(3). The total chemical oxygen demand (TCOD) removal and coulombic efficiency (CE) of the MFC reached 73.9+/-1.8% and 2.79+/-0.6%, respectively, after 120 days of operation. Acetate was the main metabolite in the anolyte, and other volatile fatty acids (VFAs) (propionate and butyrate) were present in minor amounts. The PCR-DGGE analysis indicated that the following five groups of microbes were present: Proteobacteria, Bacteroides, Chloroflexi, Actinobacteria and Firmicutes. Proteobacteria and Firmicutes were the dominant phyla in the sample; specifically, 36.3% and 24.2% of the sequences obtained were Proteobacteria and Firmicutes, respectively. Clostridium sp., Pseudomonas luteola and Ochrobactrum pseudogrignonense were the most dominant groups during the electricity generation process. The diversity of archaea dramatically decreased after 20 days of operation. The detected archaea were hydrogenotrophic methanogens, and the Methanobacterium genus disappeared during the periods of stable electricity generation via acidogenesis.
TI  - The antimicrobial action of chitosan, low molar mass chitosan, and chitooligosaccharides on human colonic bacteria.
AB  - Antibacterial effect of chitooligosaccharides (COS) and low molar mass chitosans  (LMWC) is considered as one of the most important characteristics of chitosan (CS) hydrolysates. Here, we show the in vitro effect of different COS, LMWC, and CS on representative anaerobic bacteria isolated from human colon as a possibility of targeting modification of colonic microflora composition by supplementation of dietary CS products by humans. Specific growth rate of seven selected nonpathogenic anaerobic bacterial strains (Clostridium paraputrificum, Clostridium beijerinckii, Roseburia intestinalis, Bacteroides vulgatus, Bacteriodes thetaiotaomicron, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Blautia coccoides) was determined in the presence of 0.25 and 0.5% COS (2, 3, and 6 kDa), 0.025 and 0.05% of LMWC (10 and 16 kDa), and 0.025 and 0.1% of CS in vitro. The growth rate decreased in all strains in the presence of COS and LMWC in higher concentrations in comparison to control incubations. A relatively higher resistance to CS hydrolyzates was detected in R. intestinalis and F. prausnitzii, and more susceptible were bacteria belonging to Bacteoides sp. and Clostridium sp. The antimicrobial activity, minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC), and minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBC) were determined. The antimicrobial activity increased with the degree of polymerization (DP). MIC ranged from 0.25 to 4.5% in dependence on bacterial strain and DP of CS/LMWC. MBC also decreased with DP. The most effective antimicrobial action was detected in LMWC with 16 kDa and CS. Weak antimicrobial activity was found in COS with small molecules (2 and 3 kDa).
TI  - Clostridia in premature neonates' gut: incidence, antibiotic susceptibility, and  perinatal determinants influencing colonization.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although premature neonates (PN) gut microbiota has been studied, data about gut clostridial colonization in PN are scarce. Few studies have reported clostridia colonization in PN whereas Bacteroides and bifidobacteria have been seldom isolated. Such aberrant gut microbiota has been suggested to be a risk factor for the development of intestinal infections. Besides, PN are often treated by broad spectrum antibiotics, but little is known about how antibiotics can influence clostridial colonization based on their susceptibility patterns. The aim of this study was to report the distribution of Clostridium species isolated in feces from PN and to determine their antimicrobial susceptibility patterns. Additionally, clostridial colonization perinatal determinants were analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 76 PN followed until hospital discharge in three French neonatal intensive care units (NICUs), 79% were colonized by clostridia. Clostridium sp. colonization, with a high diversity of species, increased throughout the hospitalization. Antibiotic courses had no effect on the clostridial colonization incidence although strains were found susceptible (except C. difficile) to anti-anaerobe molecules tested. However, levels of colonization were decreased by either antenatal or neonatal (during more than 10 days) antibiotic courses (p = 0.006 and p = 0.001, respectively). Besides, incidence of colonization was depending on the NICU (p = 0.048). CONCLUSION: This study shows that clostridia are part of the PN gut microbiota. It provides for the first time information on the status of clostridia antimicrobial susceptibility in PN showing that strains were susceptible to most antibiotic molecules. Thus, the high prevalence of this genus is not linked to a high degree of resistance to antimicrobial agents or to the use of antibiotics in NICUs. The main perinatal determinant influencing PN clostridia colonization appears to be the NICU environment.
TI  - Changes in gut microbiota in children with atopic dermatitis administered the bacteria Lactobacillus casei DN--114001.
AB  - Gut microbiota was analyzed in children, aged 6-18 months and suffering from atopic dermatitis before and after 3 month supplementation of their diet with Lactobacillus casei DN--114001 in a dose of 109 cells daily. On completion of this period the total number of fecal Lactobacillus sp. cells decreased from 7.86 Log10 CFU/g to 6.40 Log10 CFU/g. After the next 5 months (without dietary supplementation with the probiotic bacteria) the level of Lactobacillus sp. cells was maintained at the latter value. During the dietary supplementation with the probiotic strain, the level of Bifidobacterium cells was maintained at 6.15-6.89 Log10 CFU/g while after 5 months it decreased to 5.57 Log10 CFU/g. The population of Clostridium sp. was reduced after 3 months of dietary supplementation from 6.49 to 5.83 Log10 CFU/g and was maintained at the latter level during the next 5 months. The dietary supplementation had no effect on populations of Bacteroides sp., Enterococcus sp. and Enterobacteriaceae. Supplementation of children who developed atopic dermatitis with the preparation of Lactobacillus casei DN - 114001 positively affected their gut microbiota in terms of bifidobacteria and clostridia populations.
TI  - Epizootic rabbit enteropathy inoculum (TEC4): antibiograms and antibiotic fractionation.
AB  - Epizootic rabbit enteropathy (ERE) emerged and spread in Europe within the last 13 years causing major economical loss. The aims of the study was to evaluate antibiograms of TEC4, an inoculum composed of an extract of intestinal content of affected rabbits, and to test the potential of different antibiotic-based TEC4 fractions to reproduce the disease. Twenty nine different antibiotic discs were incubated for determining bacteria resistance. In a complementary study, nine tubes of liquid medium were inoculated with TEC4, incubated and added individually with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, bacitracin, ceftiofur, doxycycline, novobiocin, streptomycyin, tylosin, vancomycin and 0.9% saline solution as control. The content of each tube was washed by centrifugation and suspended in saline. The three most effective antibiotics are florfenicol, amoxycillin/clavulanic acid and tylosin. A high concentration of Clostridium sordelli and Bacillus firmus were isolated in all fractions. Species never cultured from TEC4 were identified as Fusobacterium necrogenes (in vancomycin fraction), Cellulomonas sp (in novobiocin fraction) and Bacteroides distasonis (in doxycycline fraction). The ERE was reproduced when bacitracin, doxycycline and 0.9% fractions were inoculated. Rabbits showed ERE clinical signs with the specific drop in daily weight gain.
TI  - Effect of beta -glucanase and xylanase supplementation of barley- and rye-based diets on caecal microbiota of broiler chickens.
AB  - 1. The aim was to investigate the effect of grain type (barley or rye) and exogenous enzymes (beta-glucanase or xylanase) on the composition of chicken caecal microbiota as examined by classical culturing and molecular techniques (fluorescent in-situ hybridisation (FISH) and terminal-restriction fragment-length polymorphism (T-RFLP)). 2. Plate counting revealed higher total numbers of anaerobic bacteria, lactic acid bacteria and yeasts in caecal contents of birds fed with rye-based diets than in birds fed with barley-based diets. 3. As assessed by FISH analysis, the most abundant bacterial groups in the broiler caeca were Clostridium coccoides-Eubacterium rectale followed by Bacteroides sp., Lactobacillus sp./Enterococcus sp., Bifidobacterium sp. and Enterobacteriaceae. For both cereal types, the enzyme supplementation significantly decreased the relative amount of Enterobacteriaceae. 4. The T-RFLP profiles indicated that the caecal microbiota of birds receiving rye-based diets was more diverse than that of birds fed on barley-based diets. 5. Irrespective of the method applied, the results indicate that the cereal type as well as the exogenous enzyme supplementation influence the microbiota in broiler chicken caeca, and may have the effect of reducing potentially pathogenic Enterobacteriaceae populations.
TI  - Dysbiosis of fecal microbiota in Crohn's disease patients as revealed by a custom phylogenetic microarray.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A custom phylogenetic microarray composed of small subunit ribosomal  RNA probes, representing approximately 500 bacterial species from the human and animal gut, was developed and evaluated for analysis of gut microbial diversity using fecal samples from healthy subjects and Crohn's disease (CD) patients. METHODS: Oligonucleotide probes ( approximately 40 mer) used on the microarray were selected from published articles or designed with the "GoArray" microarray probe design program using selected bacterial 16S rRNA sequences. Fecal 16S rDNA from individual samples of six healthy subjects and six CD patients were used as template to generate fluorescently labeled cRNA that was hybridized to the microarray. Differences revealed by the microarray in relative abundance of microbial populations between healthy and diseased patients were verified using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with species-specific primer sets. RESULTS: The microarray analyses showed that Eubacterium rectale, Bacteroides fragilis group, B. vulgatus, Ruminococcus albus, R. callidus, R. bromii, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii were 5-10-fold more abundant in the healthy subjects than in the CD patients, while Enterococcus sp., Clostridium difficile, Escherichia coli, Shigella flexneri, and Listeria sp. were more abundant in the CD group. CONCLUSIONS: The microarray detected differences in abundance of bacterial populations within the phylum Firmicutes that had been reported previously for the same samples based on phylogenetic analysis of metagenomic clone libraries. In addition, the microarray showed that Enterococcus sp. was in higher abundance in the CD patients. This microarray should be another useful tool to examine the diversity and abundance of human intestinal microbiota.
TI  - Bacteriophage treatment significantly reduces viable Clostridium difficile and prevents toxin production in an in vitro model system.
AB  - Clostridium difficile is primarily a nosocomial pathogen, causing thousands of cases of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea in the UK each year. In this study, we used a batch fermentation model of a C. difficile colonised system to evaluate the potential of a prophylactic and a remedial bacteriophage treatment regime to control the pathogen. It is shown that the prophylaxis regime was effective at preventing the growth of C. difficile (p = <0.001) and precluded the production of detectable levels of toxins A and B. The remedial treatment regime caused a less profound and somewhat transient decrease in the number of viable C. difficile cells (p = <0.0001), but still resulted in a lower level of toxin production relative to the control. The numbers of commensal bacteria including total aerobes and anaerobes, Bifidobacterium sp., Bacteroides sp., Lactobacillus sp., total Clostridium sp., and Enterobacteriaceae were not significantly decreased by this therapy, whereas significant detrimental effects were observed with metronidazole treatment. Our study indicates that phage therapy has potential to be used for the control of C. difficile; it highlights the main benefits of this approach, and some future challenges.
TI  - Isolation of bacteria from mouse caecal samples and description of Bacteroides sartorii sp. nov.
AB  - Caecal samples from wild-type and TNF(deltaARE) mice were cultured on selective media containing bile salts, amino acids or casein macro-peptides. Twenty-two strains were isolated and identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Twenty-one strains showed >98% similarity to known bacteria (Blautia spp., Clostridium innocuum, Enterococcus spp., Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus murinus, Parabacteroides goldsteinii and Shigella dysenteriae). One additional isolate, strain A-C2-0, was a new bacterium. The closest relatives were Bacteroides massiliensis, Bacteroides dorei and Bacteroides vulgatus (< or = 94% similarity). Strain A-C2-0 is a Gram-negative rod that does not form spores and has a G + C content of DNA of 41.5%. Its major cellular fatty acid is C(15:0 ANTEISO), and its major respiratory quinone is MK-9. Cells are aerotolerant but grow only under strict anoxic conditions. They are resistant to cefotaxime and tobramycin. When compared with related Bacteroides spp., the new bacterium was positive for alpha-arabinosidase, negative for glutamyl glutamic acid arylamidase and did not metabolise galactose, glucose, fructose, mannose, raffinose and sucrose. Strain A-C2-0 therefore merits recognition as a member of a novel species within the genus Bacteroides, for which the name Bacteroides sartorii is proposed. The type strain is A-C2-0(T) (= DSM 21941(T) = CCUG 57211(T)).
TI  - Detection and identification of rumen bacteria constituting a fibrolytic consortium dominated by Fibrobacter succinogenes.
AB  - A fibrolytic consortium, dominated by the rumen cellulolytic bacterium Fibrobacter succinogenes, was artificially constructed on hay stems to detect and identify rumen bacteria that can potentially interact with F. succinogenes. Consortium-bacterial members were determined by DGGE and sequencing analysis targeted bacterial 16S rDNA. An artificial consortium was formed in a 2-step incubation of hay stems; the first step with group 1, 2 or 3 F. succinogenes strains, the second step with rumen fluid. After consortium formation, morphologically different bacteria were observed in association with F. succinogenes. DGGE exhibited more than 30 bands, the pattern of which depended on the F. succinogenes group. Sequencing suggested that Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, Pseudobutyrivibrio ruminis, Clostridium sp., F. succinogenes group 2, Prevotella ruminicola and unclassified Bacteroides were prominent in the group 1 consortium and that Treponema bryantii, B. fibrisolvens, Acinetobacter sp, and Wolinella succinogenes were prominent in the group 2 consortium. However, in the group 3 consortium, F. succinogenes-like bacteria were microscopically undetectable, whereas cellulolytic Ruminococcus albus and F. succinogenes group 1 were prominent, suggesting that the group 3 cannot be a core member of this consortium. This study is the first attempt to identify bacterial members of a fibrolytic consortium dominated by a specific bacterium.
TI  - Characterization of bacteria, clostridia and Bacteroides in faeces of vegetarians using qPCR and PCR-DGGE fingerprinting.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: This study aimed to investigate the quantitative and qualitative changes of bacteria, Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium and Clostridium cluster IV in faecal microbiota associated with a vegetarian diet. METHODS: Bacterial abundances were measured in faecal samples of 15 vegetarians and 14 omnivores using quantitative PCR. Diversity was assessed with PCR-DGGE fingerprinting, principal component analysis (PCA) and Shannon diversity index. RESULTS: Vegetarians had a 12% higher abundance of bacterial DNA than omnivores, a tendency for less Clostridium cluster IV (31.86 +/- 17.00%; 36.64 +/- 14.22%) and higher abundance of Bacteroides (23.93 +/- 10.35%; 21.26 +/- 8.05%), which were not significant due to high interindividual variations. PCA suggested a grouping of bacteria and members of Clostridium cluster IV. Two bands appeared significantly more frequently in omnivores than in vegetarians (p < 0.005 and p < 0.022). One was identified as Faecalibacterium sp. and the other was 97.9% similar to the uncultured gut bacteriumDQ793301. CONCLUSIONS: A vegetarian diet affects the intestinal microbiota, especially by decreasing the amount and changing the diversity of Clostridium cluster IV. It remains to be determined how these shifts might affect the host metabolism and disease risks.
TI  - [Microbial diversity analysis in rotating drum biofilter for nitric oxide denitrifying removal].
AB  - PCR-DGGE was applied to analyze the microbial communities in rotating drum biofilter (RDB) for nitric oxide denitrifying removal under anaerobic conditions. The 16S rRNA genes (V3 region) were amplified with two universal primers (338F-GC and 518R). These amplified DNA fragments were separated by parallel DGGE. The DGGE profiles of biofilm samples from different sections of RDB are similar and about sixteen types of microorganisms are identified in the biofilm samples. These results show that microbial diversity of RDB firstly increases but then decreases with the addition of Cu II (EDTA) and the increase of NO removal efficiency. However, the change of microbial community is not significant during the process. Eight major bands of 16S rRNA genes fragments from DGGE profiles of biofilm samples were further eluted from gel, re-amplified, cloned and sequenced. The sequences of these fragments were compared with the database in GeneBank (NCBI). The gene analysis of 16S rRNA showed that the major populations are Cytopahga-Flexibacteria-Bacteroides (CFB) group Bacteroides, beta -Proteobacterium, gamma-Proteobacterium and Clostridium sp.. In addition, denitrification is related with band G-5, G-6 and G-8. G-5 is affiliated with gamma-Proteobacterium. Both G-6 and G-8 are affiliated with beta-Proteobacterium.
TI  - Prognostic factors and impact of antibiotherapy in 117 cases of anaerobic bacteraemia.
AB  - Bacteraemia due to anaerobic bacteria occurs infrequently, making the systematic  use of an anaerobic blood sample bottle in patients with sepsis controversial. We retrospectively reviewed the clinical and microbiological data from all cases of anaerobic bacteraemia in a teaching hospital over 2 years and determined the prognostic factors and antibiotic management. With the goal of evaluating the morbidity and mortality of bacteraemia due to anaerobic bacteria, a case-control study was also performed. One hundred eighty-four blood cultures from 125 patients grew at least one anaerobic bacterium, representing 0.5% of all and 7.0% of the positive blood cultures. One hundred seventeen patients were studied. In 24 cases, anaerobic blood cultures were associated with concomitant aerobic bacteria isolation. The most frequently isolated anaerobic species were Bacteroides sp. (n = 62), Clostridium sp. (n = 25), and Fusobacterium sp. (n = 12). The most frequent site of origin was the digestive tract (n = 61). In 51 cases, patients did not receive adequate empirical antianaerobic therapy. The mortality rate was 27%. Age [odds ratio (OR) 1.059; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.021-1.100], cancer history (OR 3.21, 95% CI 1.126-9.156), and ineffective definitive antibiotherapy (OR 19.292, 95% CI 5.330-69.832) were independently associated with increased hospital mortality. The 72 patients that could be matched with patients without anaerobic bacteria according to their primary diagnosis had a longer hospitalisation and a trend toward increased mortality (P = 0.08). Anaerobic bacteraemia contributed significantly to the morbidity of the patients, and adequate empirical antibiotherapy may play an important role in the clinical outcomes.
TI  - Lactobacillus rhamnosus R11 consumed in a food supplement survived human digestive transit without modifying microbiota equilibrium as assessed by real-time polymerase chain reaction.
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the survival of Lactobacillus rhamnosus R11 and Lactobacillus acidophilus R52 in the human digestive tract and their effects on the microbiota homeostasis. We designed an open human trial including 14 healthy volunteers. A 3-week exclusion period of fermented products was followed by a 12-day consumption period of 4 capsules daily containing 2 x 10(9)L. rhamnosus R11 and 1 x 10(8)L. acidophilus R52, and a 12-day wash-out period. The 2 strains and dominant bacterial groups of the microbiota were quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction. At the end of the capsule consumption period, high levels of L. rhamnosus R11 were detected in faecal samples from all volunteers, reaching a mean value of 7.1 log(10) colony-forming unit (CFU) equivalents/g of stool. L. acidophilus R52 was detected in the stools of only 1 volunteer, reaching a maximum level of 6.1 log(10) CFU equivalents/g of stool. Dilution plating enumerations performed in parallel provided less consistent and generally lower levels. No significant effect of capsule consumption was observed on microbiota homeostasis for the dominant faecal populations. Mean values of 8.8, 9.2, 9.9 and 10.6 log(10) CFU equivalents/g of stool were obtained for the Clostridium coccoides, Bifidobacterium sp., Bacteroides sp. and Clostridium leptum groups, respectively.
TI  - Characterization of an antibiotic resistant Clostridium hathewayi strain from a continuous-flow exclusion chemostat culture derived from the cecal contents of a feral pig.
AB  - The chemostat model has been an important tool in studying intestinal microflora. To date, several competitive exclusion products have been developed from such studies as prophylactic treatment against pathogenic bacteria. A continuous-flow chemostat model of a feral pig was developed using inocula from the cecal contents of a wild boar caught in East Texas. Several strains of antibiotic-sensitive bacteria were isolated including Bacteroides, Lactobacillus, Enterococcus and Clostridium sp. This study reports on the characterization of a multidrug-resistant Clostridium hathewayi strain that was isolated from this feral pig's cecal contents maintained in a continuous-flow chemostat system showing high resistance to carbapenems and macrolides (including the growth promoter tylosin). Clostridium hathewayi has been documented to be pathogenic to both humans and animals. Feral pigs may be an important source of pathogenic and antibiotic resistant bacteria and may pose potential risk to domestic species. Further work is needed to elucidate the prevalence of these reservoirs and assess the contribution these may play in the spread of disease and resistance.
TI  - Digestive tract microbiota in healthy volunteers.
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to standardize the methods of sample collection of mucus from the digestive tract and to determine the microbiota in healthy volunteers from Brazil, collecting samples from the mouth, esophagus, stomach, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, colon, and rectum. METHODS: Microbiota of selected healthy volunteers from the oral cavity (n=10), the esophagus (n=10), the upper digestive tract (n=20), and the lower digestive tract (n=24) were evaluated through distinct collection methods. Collection methods took into account the different sites, using basic scraping and swabbing techniques, stimulated saliva from the oral cavity, irrigation-aspiration with sterile catheters especially designed for the esophagus, a probe especially designed for upper digestive tract, and a special catheter for the lower digestive tract. RESULTS: (i) Mixed microbiota were identified in the oral cavity, predominantly Gram-positive aerobic and anaerobic cocci; (ii) transitional flora mainly in the esophagus; (iii) Veillonella sp, Lactobacillus sp, and Clostridium sp in the stomach and duodenum; (iv) in the jejunum and upper ileum, we observed Bacteroides sp, Proteus sp, and Staphylococcus sp, in addition to Veillonella sp; (v) in the colon, the presence of "nonpathogenic" anaerobic bacteria Veillonella sp (average 10(5) UFC) indicates the existence of a low oxidation-reduction potential environment, which suggests the possibility of adoption of these bacteria as biological markers of total digestive tract health. CONCLUSIONS: The collection methods were efficient in obtaining adequate samples from each segment of the total digestive tract to reveal the normal microbiota. These procedures are safe and easily reproducible for microbiological studies.
TI  - Effect of chitosan on the growth of human colonic bacteria.
AB  - Growth of 6 bacterial strains representing dominant members of the human colonic  microflora was measured in the presence of 0.025, 0.05 and 0.5 % chitosan (from shrimp shells, with a 97 % final degree of deacetylation). The effect of chitosan was variable and dependent on bacterial species. The most susceptible to chitosan were bacteria belonging to genera Bacteroides and Clostridium (91-97% growth inhibition). On the other hand, Roseburia sp., Eubacterium sp. and Faecalibacterium sp. were more resistant (63-83 % inhibition of growth). Chitosan can thus be considered as one of the means for influencing the bacterial population in the human colon.
TI  - Effect of tea phenolics and their aromatic fecal bacterial metabolites on intestinal microbiota.
AB  - Tea is rich in polyphenols and other phenolics that have been widely reported to  have beneficial health effects. However, dietary polyphenols are not completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and are metabolized by the gut microflora so that they and their metabolites may accumulate to exert physiological effects. In this study, we investigated the influence of the phenolic components of a tea extract and their aromatic metabolites upon bacterial growth. Fecal homogenates containing bacteria significantly catalyzed tea phenolics, including epicatechin, catechin, 3-O-methyl gallic acid, gallic acid and caffeic acid to generate aromatic metabolites dependent on bacterial species. Different strains of intestinal bacteria had varying degrees of growth sensitivity to tea phenolics and metabolites. Growth of certain pathogenic bacteria such as Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium difficile and Bacteroides spp. was significantly repressed by tea phenolics and their derivatives, while commensal anaerobes like Clostridium spp., Bifidobacterium spp. and probiotics such as Lactobacillus sp. were less severely affected. This indicates that tea phenolics exert significant effects on the intestinal environment by modulation of the intestinal bacterial population, probably by acting as metabolic prebiotics. Our observations provide further evidence for the importance of colonic bacteria in the metabolism, absorption and potential activity of phenolics in human health and disease. The bioactivity of different phenolics may play an important role in the maintenance of gastrointestinal health.
TI  - Assessing optimal fermentation type for bio-hydrogen production in continuous-flow acidogenic reactors.
AB  - In this study, the optimal fermentation type and the operating conditions of anaerobic process in continuous-flow acidogenic reactors was investigated for the maximization of bio-hydrogen production using mixed cultures. Butyric acid type fermentation occurred at pH>6, propionic acid type fermentation occurred at pH about 5.5 with E(h) (redox potential) >-278mV, and ethanol-type fermentation occurred at pH<4.5. The representative strains of these fermentations were Clostridium sp., Propionibacterium sp. and Bacteriodes sp., respectively. Ethanol fermentation was optimal type by comparing the operating stabilities and hydrogen production capacities between the fermentation types, which remained stable when the organic loading rate (OLR) reached the highest OLR at 86.1kgCOD/m(3)d. The maximum hydrogen production reached up to 14.99L/d.
TI  - Occurrence and activity of human intestinal bacteria involved in the conversion of dietary lignans.
AB  - The human intestinal microbiota is necessary for the production of enterolignans  from the dietary lignan secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG). However, little is known about the bacteria that contribute to SDG conversion. Therefore, we aimed at describing the occurrence and activity of SDG metabolising bacteria. The data showed differences in conversion efficiency between SDG deglycosylating species, but SDG was completely deglycosylated within 20 h by five of six strains. The strain Clostridium sp. SDG-Mt85-3Db showed the highest initial rate of SDG deglycosylation. Furthermore, we found that Bacteroides distasonis and B. fragilis made up 0.5% and 3.3% of total faecal bacteria, respectively. However, Clostridium sp. SDG-Mt85-3Db was detected within the dominant microbiota of only two out of 20 faecal samples. Bacteria involved in the demethylation step of SDG conversion also demethylated a variety of compounds other than SDG. In particular, Peptostreptococcus productus demethylated the lignans pinoresinol, lariciresinol and matairesinol. Finally, Eggerthella lenta catalysed the reduction of pinoresinol and lariciresinol to secoisolariciresinol.
TI  - Phylogeny of human intestinal bacteria that activate the dietary lignan secoisolariciresinol diglucoside.
AB  - The human intestinal microbiota is essential for the conversion of the dietary lignan secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG) via secoisolariciresinol (SECO) to the enterolignans enterodiol (ED) and enterolactone (EL). However, knowledge of the species that catalyse the underlying reactions is scant. Therefore, we focused our attention on the identification of intestinal bacteria involved in the conversion of SDG. Strains of Bacteroides distasonis, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides ovatus and Clostridium cocleatum, as well as the newly isolated strain Clostridium sp. SDG-Mt85-3Db, deglycosylated SDG. Demethylation of SECO was catalysed by strains of Butyribacterium methylotrophicum, Eubacterium callanderi, Eubacterium limosum and Peptostreptococcus productus. Dehydroxylation of SECO was catalysed by strains of Clostridium scindens and Eggerthella lenta. Finally, the newly isolated strain ED-Mt61/PYG-s6 catalysed the dehydrogenation of ED to EL. The results indicate that the activation of SDG involves phylogenetically diverse bacteria, most of which are members of the dominant human intestinal microbiota.
TI  - Phylogenetic analysis of TCE-dechlorinating consortia enriched on a variety of electron donors.
AB  - Two rapidly fermented electron donors, lactate and methanol, and two slowly fermented electron donors, propionate and butyrate, were selected for enrichment studies to evaluate the characteristics of anaerobic microbial consortia that reductively dechlorinate TCE to ethene. Each electron donor enrichment subculture demonstrated the ability to dechlorinate TCE to ethene through several serial transfers. Microbial community analyses based upon 16S rDNA, including terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) and clone library/sequencing, were performed to assess major changes in microbial community structure associated with electron donors capable of stimulating reductive dechlorination. Results demonstrated that five phylogenic subgroups or genera of bacteria were present in all consortia, including Dehalococcoides sp., low G+C Gram-positives (mostly Clostridium and Eubacterium sp.), Bacteroides sp., Citrobacter sp., and delta Proteobacteria (mostly Desulfovibrio sp.). Phylogenetic association indicates that only minor shifts in the microbial community structure occurred between the four alternate electron donor enrichments and the parent consortium. Inconsistent detection of Dehalococcoides spp. in clone libraries and T-RFLP of enrichment subcultures was resolved using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR). Q-PCR with primers specific to Dehalococcoides 16S rDNA resulted in positive detection of this species in all enrichments. Our results suggest that TCE-dechlorinating consortia can be stably maintained on a variety of electron donors and that quantities of Dehalococcoides cells detected with Dehalococcoides specific 16S rDNA primer/probe sets do not necessarily correlate well with solvent degradation rates.
TI  - Two proteins, Mn2+, and low molecular cofactor are required for C-glucosyl-cleavage of mangiferin.
AB  - C-Glucosides, in which sugars are attached to the aglycone by carbon-carbon bonds, are generally resistant to acid and enzyme hydrolysis. The C-glucosyl bond of mangiferin, a xanthone C-glucoside, was cleaved by anaerobic incubation with a human intestinal bacterium, Bacteroides sp. MANG, to give norathyriol. A cell-free extract obtained by sonication of B. sp. MANG demonstrated cleaving activity for mangiferin to norathyriol by adding NADH, diaphorase, and dithiothreitol. Both high molecular weight (>10 k) and low molecular weight (<10 k) fractions obtained from the cell-free extract were required for the activity. MnCl2 was necessary for the activity, but other metal ions were not. By purification of the high molecular weight fraction using DEAE-cellulose and Phenyl Sepharose column chromatography, two fractions, designated as proteins A and B, were separated and required for the activity. Neither protein A nor protein B alone showed any activity. This is the first report describing a C-glucosyl-cleaving enzyme from human intestinal bacterium that seems to involve a novel enzyme mechanism.
TI  - Effects of difructose anhydride III (DFA III) administration on rat intestinal microbiota.
AB  - The effects of difructose anhydride III (di-D-fructofuranose-1,2':2,3'-dianhydride; DFA III) administration (3% DFA III for 4 weeks) on rat intestinal microbiota were examined using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). According to DGGE profiles, the number of bacteria related to Bacteroides acidofaciens and uncultured bacteria within the Clostridium lituseburense group decreased, while that of bacteria related to Bacteroides vulgatus, Bacteroides uniformis and Ruminococcus productus increased in DFA III-fed rat cecum. In the cecal contents of DFA III-fed rats, a lowering of pH and an increase in short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), especially acetic acid, were observed. The DFA III-assimilating bacterium, Ruminococcus sp. M-1, was isolated from the cecal contents of DFA III-fed rats. The strain had 98% similarity with R. productus ATCC 27340T (L76595), and mainly produced acetic acid. These results confirmed that the bacteria harmful to host health were not increased by DFA III administration. Moreover, DFA III stimulated the growth of Ruminococcus sp. M-1 producing acetic acid, which may alter the intestinal microbiota towards a healthier composition. It is expected that DFA III would be a new candidate as a prebiotic.
TI  - Monitoring of microbial community structure and succession in the biohydrogen production reactor by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE).
AB  - To study the structure of microbial communities in the biological hydrogen production reactor and determine the ecological function of hydrogen producing bacteria, anaerobic sludge was obtained from the continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) in different periods of time, and the diversity and dynamics of microbial communities were investigated by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). The results of DGGE demonstrated that an obvious shift of microbial population happened from the beginning of star-up to the 28th day, and the ethanol type fermentation was established. After 28 days the structure of microbial community became stable, and the climax community was formed. Comparative analysis of 16S rDNA sequences from reamplifying and sequencing the prominent bands indicated that the dominant population belonged to low G+C Gram-positive bacteria (Clostridium sp. and Ethanologenbacterium sp.), beta-proteobacteria (Acidovorax sp.), gamma-proteobacteria (Kluyvera sp.), Bacteroides (uncultured bacterium SJA-168), and Spirochaetes (uncultured eubacterium E1-K13), respectively. The hydrogen production rate increased obviously with the increase of Ethanologenbacterium sp., Clostridium sp. and uncultured Spirochaetes after 21 days, meanwhile the succession of ethanol type fermentation was formed. Throughout the succession the microbial diversity increased however it decreased after 21 days. Some types of Clostridium sp. Acidovorax sp., Kluyvera sp., and Bacteroides were dominant populations during all periods of time. These special populations were essential for the construction of climax community. Hydrogen production efficiency was dependent on both hydrogen producing bacteria and other populations. It implied that the co-metabolism of microbial community played a great role of biohydrogen production in the reactors.
TI  - Analysis of the large bowel microbiota of colitic mice using PCR/DGGE.
AB  - AIM: To test combined polymerase chain reaction amplification of 16S rRNA gene sequences and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR/DGGE) as an analytical method to investigate the composition of the large bowel microbiota of mice during the development of colitis. METHODS AND RESULTS: The colonic microbiota of formerly germfree interleukin 10 (IL-10)-deficient mice that had been exposed to the faecal microbiota of specific pathogen-free animals was screened using PCR/DGGE. The composition of the large bowel microbiota of IL-10-deficient mice changed as colitis progressed. DNA fragments originating from four bacterial populations ('Bacteroides sp.', Bifidobacterium animalis, Clostridium cocleatum, enterococci) were more apparent in PCR/DGGE profiles of colitic mice relative to non-colitic animals, whereas two populations were less apparent (Eubacterium ventriosum, Acidophilus group lactobacilli). Specific DNA:RNA dot blot analysis showed that bifidobacterial ribosomal RNA (rRNA) abundance increased as colitis developed. CONCLUSIONS: PCR/DGGE was shown to be an effective method to demonstrate changes in the composition of the large bowel microbiota of mice in relation to progression of inflammatory disease. The intensity of staining of DNA fragments in DGGE profiles reflected increased abundance of bifidobacterial rRNA in the microbiota of colitic animals. As bifidobacterial fragments in PCR/DGGE profiles generated from microbiota DNA showed increased intensity of fragment staining, an increase in bifidobacterial numbers in colitic mice was indicated. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: PCR/DGGE analysis demonstrated an altered composition of the large bowel microbiota of colitic mice. This work will allow specific groups of bacteria to be targeted in future research concerning the pathogenesis of colitis.
TI  - Spatial distribution and stability of the eight microbial species of the altered  schaedler flora in the mouse gastrointestinal tract.
AB  - The overall complexity of the microbial communities in the gastrointestinal (GI)  tracts of mammals has hindered observations of dynamics and interactions of individual bacterial populations. However, such information is crucial for understanding the diverse disease-causing and protective roles that gut microbiota play in their hosts. Here, we determine the spatial distribution, interanimal variation, and persistence of bacteria in the most complex defined-flora (gnotobiotic) model system to date, viz., mice colonized with the eight strains of the altered Schaedler flora (ASF). Quantitative PCR protocols based on the 16S rRNA sequence of each ASF strain were developed and optimized to specifically detect as few as 10 copies of each target. Total numbers of the ASF strains were determined in the different regions of the GI tracts of three C.B-17 SCID mice. Individual strain abundance was dependent on oxygen sensitivity, with microaerotolerant Lactobacillus murinus ASF361 present at 10(5) to 10(7) cells/g of tissue in the upper GI tract and obligate anaerobic ASF strains being predominant in the cecal and colonic flora at 10(8) to 10(10) cells/g of tissue. The variation between the three mice was small for most ASF strains, except for Clostridium sp. strain ASF502 and Bacteroides sp. strain ASF519 in the cecum. A comparison of the relative distribution of the ASF strains in feces and the colon indicated large differences, suggesting that fecal bacterial levels may provide a poor approximation of colonic bacterial levels. All ASF strains were detected by PCR in the feces of C57BL/6 restricted flora mice, which had been maintained in an isolator without sterile food, water, or bedding for several generations, providing evidence for the stability of these strains in the face of potential competition by bacteria introduced into the gut.
TI  - Identification, detection, and spatial resolution of Clostridium populations responsible for cellulose degradation in a methanogenic landfill leachate bioreactor.
AB  - An anaerobic landfill leachate bioreactor was operated with crystalline cellulose and sterile landfill leachate until a steady state was reached. Cellulose hydrolysis, acidogenesis, and methanogenesis were measured. Microorganisms attached to the cellulose surfaces were hypothesized to be the cellulose hydrolyzers. 16S rRNA gene clone libraries were prepared from this attached fraction and also from the mixed fraction (biomass associated with cellulose particles and in the planktonic phase). Both clone libraries were dominated by Firmicutes phylum sequences (100% of the attached library and 90% of the mixed library), and the majority fell into one of five lineages of the clostridia. Clone group 1 (most closely related to Clostridium stercorarium), clone group 2 (most closely related to Clostridium thermocellum), and clone group 5 (most closely related to Bacteroides cellulosolvens) comprised sequences in Clostridium group III. Clone group 3 sequences were in Clostridium group XIVa (most closely related to Clostridium sp. strain XB90). Clone group 4 sequences were affiliated with a deeply branching clostridial lineage peripherally associated with Clostridium group VI. This monophyletic group comprises a new Clostridium cluster, designated cluster VIa. Specific fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) probes for the five groups were designed and synthesized, and it was demonstrated in FISH experiments that bacteria targeted by the probes for clone groups 1, 2, 4, and 5 were very abundant on the surfaces of the cellulose particles and likely the key cellulolytic microorganisms in the landfill bioreactor. The FISH probe for clone group 3 targeted cells in the planktonic phase, and these organisms were hypothesized to be glucose fermenters.
TI  - Urinary tract and genito-urinary suppurative infections due to anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - Anaerobes have been involved in many different types of urinary tract infection.  This review describes the microbiology, diagnosis and management of urinary tract and genito-urinary suppurative infections caused by anaerobic bacteria. The types of infections of the urinary tract in which anaerobes have been involved include para- or periurethral cellulitis or abscess, acute and chronic urethritis, cystitis, acute and chronic prostatitis, prostatic and scrotal abscesses, periprostatic phlegmon, ureteritis, periureteritis, pyelitis, pyelonephritis, renal abscess, scrotal gangrene, metastatic renal infection pyonephrosis, perinephric abscess, retroperitoneal abscess and other infections. The anaerobes recovered in these studies were Gram-negative bacilli (including Bacteroides fragilis and pigmented Prevotella and Porphyromonas sp.), Clostridium sp., anaerobic Gram-positive cocci and Actinomyces sp. In many cases, they were recovered mixed with coliforms or streptococci. The recovery of anaerobes requires the administration of antimicrobial therapy that is effective against these organisms. These antimicrobials include metronidazole, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, a carbapenem, cefoxitin and the combination of a penicillin and a beta-lactamase inhibitor. Percutaneous drainage, open surgical drainage or nephectomy might be indicated for abscesses.
TI  - Effects of alternative dietary substrates on competition between human colonic bacteria in an anaerobic fermentor system.
AB  - Duplicate anaerobic fermentor systems were used to examine changes in a community of human fecal bacteria supplied with different carbohydrate energy sources. A panel of group-specific fluorescent in situ hybridization probes targeting 16S rRNA sequences revealed that the fermentors supported growth of a greater proportion of Bacteroides and a lower proportion of gram-positive anaerobes related to Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Ruminococcus flavefaciens-Ruminococcus bromii, Eubacterium rectale-Clostridium coccoides, and Eubacterium cylindroides than the proportions in the starting fecal inoculum. Nevertheless, certain substrates, such as dahlia inulin, caused a pronounced increase in the number of bacteria related to R. flavefaciens-R. bromii and E. cylindroides. The ability of three strictly anaerobic, gram-positive bacteria to compete with the complete human fecal flora was tested in the same experiment by using selective plating to enumerate the introduced strains. The Roseburia-related strain A2-183(F) was able to grow on all substrates despite the fact that it was unable to utilize complex carbohydrates in pure culture, and it was assumed that this organism survived by cross-feeding. In contrast, Roseburia intestinalis L1-82(R) and Eubacterium sp. strain A2-194(R) survived less well despite the fact that they were able to utilize polysaccharides in pure culture, except that A2-194(R) was stimulated 100-fold by inulin. These results suggest that many low-G+C-content gram-positive obligate anaerobes may be selected against during in vitro incubation, although several groups were stimulated by inulin. Thus, considerable caution is necessary when workers attempt to predict the in vivo effects of probiotics and prebiotics from their effects in vitro.
TI  - Clinical review: bacteremia caused by anaerobic bacteria in children.
AB  - This review describes the microbiology, diagnosis and management of bacteremia caused by anaerobic bacteria in children. Bacteroides fragilis, Peptostreptococcus sp., Clostridium sp., and Fusobacterium sp. were the most common clinically significant anaerobic isolates. The strains of anaerobic organisms found depended, to a large extent, on the portal of entry and the underlying disease. Predisposing conditions include: malignant neoplasms, immunodeficiencies, chronic renal insufficiency, decubitus ulcers, perforation of viscus and appendicitis, and neonatal age. Organisms identical to those causing anaerobic bacteremia can often be recovered from other infected sites that may have served as a source of persistent bacteremia. When anaerobes resistant to penicillin are suspected or isolated, antimicrobial drugs such as clindamycin, chloramphenicol, metronidazole, cefoxitin, a carbapenem, or the combination of a beta-lactamase inhibitor and a penicillin should be administered. The early recognition of anaerobic bacteremia and administration of appropriate antimicrobial and surgical therapy play a significant role in preventing mortality and morbidity in pediatric patients.
TI  - Sulfate-reducing bacteria colonize pouches formed for ulcerative colitis but not  for familial adenomatous polyposis.
AB  - PURPOSE: Ileal pouch-anal anastomosis remains the "gold standard" in surgical treatment of ulcerative colitis and familial adenomatous polyposis. Pouchitis occurs mainly in patients with a background of ulcerative colitis, although the reasons for this are unknown. The aim of this study was to characterize differences in pouch bacterial populations between ulcerative colitis and familial adenomatous pouches. METHODS: After ethical approval was obtained, fresh stool samples were collected from patients with ulcerative colitis pouches (n = 10), familial adenomatous polyposis (n = 7) pouches, and ulcerative colitis ileostomies (n = 8). Quantitative measurements of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were performed. RESULTS: Sulfate-reducing bacteria were isolated from 80 percent (n = 8) of ulcerative colitis pouches. Sulfate-reducing bacteria were absent from familial adenomatous polyposis pouches and also from ulcerative colitis ileostomy effluent. Pouch Lactobacilli, Bifidobacterium, Bacteroides sp, and Clostridium perfringens counts were increased relative to ileostomy counts in patients with ulcerative colitis. Total pouch enterococci and coliform counts were also increased relative to ileostomy levels. There were no significant quantitative or qualitative differences between pouch types when these bacteria were evaluated. CONCLUSIONS: Sulfate-reducing bacteria are exclusive to patients with a background of ulcerative colitis. Not all ulcerative colitis pouches harbor sulfate-reducing bacteria because two ulcerative colitis pouches in this study were free of the latter. They are not present in familial adenomatous polyposis pouches or in ileostomy effluent collected from patients with ulcerative colitis. Total bacterial counts increase in ulcerative colitis pouches after stoma closure. Levels of Lactobacilli, Bifidobacterium, Bacteroides sp, Clostridium perfringens, enterococci, and coliforms were similar in both pouch groups. Because sulfate-reducing bacteria are specific to ulcerative colitis pouches, they may play a role in the pathogenesis of pouchitis.
TI  - Anaerobic bacteria and intrahepatic stones: detections of Clostridium sp. and Bacteroides fragilis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To detect anaerobic bacteria Clostridium sp. and Bacteroides fragilis  in intrahepatic stones by molecular genetic method. METHODS: DNA was extracted from 59 stone samples and subjected to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification targeting the 16S rRNA gene of Clostridium sp. and the glutamine synthetase gene of Bacteroides fragilis. Single-strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) analysis was performed to identify the Clostridium sp. RESULTS: 16S rRNA gene sequences for Clostridium sp. were identified in 49 stones (83%, 49/59). The two most common groups were detected in 19 (41%) and 17 (37%) of the 46 samples using SSPC analysis, and 25/59 (42%) stones were tested positive for Bacteroides fragilis. CONCLUSIONS: Anaerobes such as Clostridium sp. and Bacteroides fragilis present in intrahepatic stones and may play a role in stone formation. PCR is a useful technique to detect fastidious pathogens, which are difficult to culture. SSCP of PCR products is a rapid method in differentiating bacterial species.
TI  - 16S rRNA-based analysis of microbiota from the cecum of broiler chickens.
AB  - The microbiota of the intestinal tract of chickens plays an important role in inhibiting the establishment of intestinal pathogens. Earlier culturing and microscopic examinations indicated that only a fraction of the bacteria in the cecum of chickens could be grown in the laboratory. Therefore, a survey of cecal bacteria was done by retrieval of 16S rRNA gene sequences from DNA isolated from the cecal content and the cecal mucosa. The ribosomal gene sequences were amplified with universal primers and cloned or subjected to temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TTGE). Partial 16S rRNA gene sequences were determined from the clones and from the major bands in TTGE gels. A total of 1,656 partial 16S rRNA gene sequences were obtained and compared to sequences in the GenBank. The comparison indicated that 243 different sequences were present in the samples. Overall, sequences representing 50 phylogenetic groups or subgroups of bacteria were found, but approximately 89% of the sequences represented just four phylogenetic groups (Clostridium leptum, Sporomusa sp., Clostridium coccoides, and enterics). Sequences of members of the Bacteroides group, the Bifidobacterium infantis subgroup, and of Pseudomonas sp. each accounted for less than 2% of the total. Sequences related to those from the Escherichia sp. subgroup and from Lactobacillus, Pseudomonas, and Bifidobacterium spp. were generally between 98 and 100% identical to sequences already deposited in the GenBank. Sequences most closely related to those of the other bacteria were generally 97% or less identical to those in the databases and therefore might be from currently unknown species. TTGE and random cloning indicated that certain phylogenetic subgroups were common to all birds analyzed, but sequence data from random cloning also provided evidence for qualitative and quantitative differences among the cecal microbiota of individual birds reared under very similar conditions.
TI  - Comparative genomics and evolution of genes encoding bacterial (p)ppGpp synthetases/hydrolases (the Rel, RelA and SpoT proteins).
AB  - In the gram-negative model organism Escherichia coli, the effector molecule of the stringent response, (p)ppGpp, is synthesized by two different enzymes, RelA and SpoT, whereas in the gram-positive model organism Bacillus subtilis only one enzyme named Rel is responsible for this activity. Rel and SpoT also possess (p)ppGpp hydrolase activity. BLAST searches were used to identify orthologous genes in databases. The construction and bootstrapping of phylogenetic trees allowed classification of these orthologs. Four groups could be distinguished: With the exception of Neisseria and Bordetella (beta subdivision), the RelA and SpoT groups are exclusively found in the gamma subdivision of proteobacteria. Two Rel groups representing the actinobacterial and the Bacillus/Clostridium group were also identified. The SpoT proteins are related to the gram positive Rel proteins. RelA proteins carry substitutions in the HD domain (Aravind and Koonin, 1998, TIBS 23: 469-472) responsible for ppGpp degradation. A theory for the evolution of the specialized, paralogous relA and spoT genes is presented: After gene duplication of an ancestral rellike gene, the spoT and relA genes evolved from the duplicated genes. The distribution pattern of the paralogous RelA and SpoT proteins supports a new model of linear bacterial evolution (Gupta, 2000, FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 24: 367-402). This model postulates that the gamma subdivision of proteobacteria represents the most recently evolved bacterial lineage. However, two paralogous, closely related genes of Porphyromonas gingivalis (Cytophaga-Flavobacterium-Bacteroides phylum) encoding proteins with functions probably identical to the RelA and SpoT proteins do not fit in this model. Completely sequenced genomes of several obligately parasitic organisms (Treponema pallidum, Chlamydia species, Rickettsia prowazekii) and the obligate aphid symbiont Buchnera sp. APS as well as archaea do not contain rel-like genes but they are present in the Arabidopsis genome. In crosslinking experiments using different analogs of ppGpp as crosslinking reagents and RNA polymerase preparations of Escherichia coli, binding of ppGpp to distinct regions at the C-terminus of the beta subunit (the RpoB gene product) and/or at the N-terminus of the beta subunit (the RpoC gene product) was observed previously. RpoB and RpoC sequences of the species which do not possess a rel like gene do not exhibit specific insertions or deletions in the ppGpp binding regions.
TI  - Chemostat enrichments of human feces with resistant starch are selective for adherent butyrate-producing clostridia at high dilution rates.
AB  - Resistant starch (RS) enrichments were made using chemostats inoculated with human feces from two individuals at two dilution rates (D = 0.03 h(-1) and D = 0.30 h(-1)) to select for slow- and fast-growing amylolytic communities. The fermentations were studied by analysis of short-chain fatty acids, amylase and alpha-glucosidase activities, and viable counts of the predominant culturable populations and the use of 16S rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probes. Considerable butyrate was produced at D = 0. 30 h(-1), which corresponded with reduced branched-chain fatty acid formation. At both dilution rates, high levels of extracellular amylase activity were produced, while alpha-glucosidase was predominantly cell associated. Bacteroides and bifidobacteria predominated at the low dilution rate, whereas saccharolytic clostridia became more important at D = 0.30 h(-1). Microscopic examination showed that within 48 h of inoculation, one particular bacterial morphotype predominated in RS enrichments at D = 0.30 h(-1). This organism attached apically to RS granules and formed rosette-like structures which, with glycocalyx formation, agglomerated to form biofilm networks in the planktonic phase. Attempts to isolate this bacterium in pure culture were repeatedly unsuccessful, although a single colony was eventually obtained. On the basis of its 16S rDNA sequence, this RS-degrading, butyrate-producing organism was identified as being a previously unidentified group I Clostridium sp. A 16S rRNA-targeted probe was designed using this sequence and used to assess the abundance of the population in the enrichments. At 240 h, its contributions to total rRNA in the chemostats were 5 and 23% at D = 0.03 and 0.30 h(-1), respectively. This study indicates that bacterial populations with significant metabolic potential can be overlooked using culture-based methodologies. This may provide a paradigm for explaining the discrepancy between the low numbers of butyrate-producing bacteria that are isolated from fecal samples and the actual production of butyrate.
TI  - Sequence analysis of bacterial DNA in the colon and stomach of the Tyrolean Iceman.
AB  - The male human body found in an Alpine glacier on September 19, 1991 ("Tyrolean Iceman") has, for the first time in history, given scientists a chance to perform detailed anatomical, histological, and molecular investigations on the organs of a person from the Neolithic Age (5350-5100 B.P.). In the present study, tissue samples aseptically taken from the stomach and the colon of the mummy were utilized for DNA extraction, and the DNA was PCR-amplified, using primer pairs designed to bind to fragments of the 16s ribosomal RNA gene (16s rDNA) of a broad range of bacteria. The PCR products were cloned in plasmid vectors, and the recombinant clones (amplicons) were sequenced. The sequence data were finally used for scanning data libraries containing the corresponding sequences of present-day bacteria, to infer the putative ecophysiology of the ancient ones. The same procedure was repeated on some fragments of grass from the clothing found near the corpse. These fragments were taken as a control of the microbiological situation of the glacier. The results show that the flora of the Iceman's stomach is entirely composed of Burkholderia pickettii, an organism commonly found in aquatic habitats. The colon, on the other hand, contains several members of the fecal flora of humans, such as Clostridium perfringens, C. ghonii, C. sordellii, Eubacterium tenue, and Bacteroides sp. The Iceman's colon, however, was found to contain, rather unexpectedly, also some members of the genus Vibrio. The results are discussed in light of what is known about the preservation of microbial DNA at the Iceman's site and of previous parasitological studies performed on the Iceman himself and on human coprolites.
TI  - Antibiotic therapy attenuates colitis in interleukin 10 gene-deficient mice.
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Interleukin (IL)-10 gene-deficient mice, raised under germfree conditions, do not develop colitis, implying a role for bacteria. This study mapped the appearance of luminal colonic bacteria and, using antibiotic treatment, determined their association with colitis in IL-10 gene-deficient mice. METHODS: Mice were treated with ciprofloxacin or with neomycin and metronidazole. The intestine was harvested for histological scoring and bacterial assessment. RESULTS: At 2 weeks of age, before the development of colitis, IL-10 gene-deficient mice demonstrated an earlier appearance of Streptococcus and Clostridium sp., and had a greater proportion (P < 0.01) of bacteria adherent to the colonic mucosa. This pattern of increased adherent bacteria persisted for the 12 weeks of study. Treatment of mice before the onset of colonic inflammation, with either antibiotic regime, reduced mucosal adherent bacteria and prevented colitis (P < 0.01). In contrast, treatment of established colitis with neomycin and metronidazole did not reduce adherent bacterial levels, yet was more efficacious (P < 0.05) in treating established colitis than ciprofloxacin, which did reduce adherent colonic bacteria. CONCLUSIONS: In the IL-10 gene-deficient mouse model, the appearance and number of mucosal adherent colonic bacteria are altered before the onset of colitis. Antibiotics both prevent and treat the colitis through correction of this primary bacterial alteration.
TI  - The role of probiotic cultures in the control of gastrointestinal health.
AB  - The use of probiotics to enhance intestinal health has been proposed for many years. Probiotics are traditionally defined as viable microorganisms that have a beneficial effect in the prevention and treatment of specific pathologic conditions when they are ingested. There is a relatively large volume of literature that supports the use of probiotics to prevent or treat intestinal disorders. However, the scientific basis of probiotic use has been firmly established only recently, and sound clinical studies have begun to be published. Currently, the best-studied probiotics are the lactic acid bacteria, particularly Lactobacillus sp. and Bifidobacterium sp. However, other organisms used as probiotics in humans include Escherichia coli, Streptococcus sp., Enterococcus sp., Bacteroides sp., Bacillus sp., Propionibacterium sp. and various fungi. Some probiotic preparations contain mixtures of more than one bacterial strain. Probiotics have been examined for their effectiveness in the prevention and treatment of a diverse spectrum of gastrointestinal disorders such as antibiotic-associated diarrhea (including Clostridium difficile-associated intestinal disease), infectious bacterial and viral diarrhea (including diarrhea caused by rotavirus, Shigella, Salmonella, enterotoxigenic E. coli, Vibrio cholerae and human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency disorder, enteral feeding diarrhea, Helicobacter pylori gastroenteritis, sucrase maltase deficiency, inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, small bowel bacterial overgrowth and lactose intolerance. Probiotics have been found to inhibit intestinal bacterial enzymes involved in the synthesis of colonic carcinogens. There are many mechanisms by which probiotics enhance intestinal health, including stimulation of immunity, competition for limited nutrients, inhibition of epithelial and mucosal adherence, inhibition of epithelial invasion and production of antimicrobial substances. Probiotics represent an exciting prophylactic and therapeutic advance, although additional investigations must be undertaken before their role in intestinal health can be delineated clearly.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antimicrobial activities of T-3811ME, a novel des-F(6)-quinolone.
AB  - The in vitro and in vivo activities of T-3811ME, a novel des-F(6)-quinolone, were evaluated in comparison with those of some fluoroquinolones, including a newly developed one, trovafloxacin. T-3811, a free base of T-3811ME, showed a wide range of antimicrobial spectra, including activities against Chlamydia trachomatis, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In particular, T-3811 exhibited potent activity against various gram-positive cocci, with MICs at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited (MIC90s) of 0.025 to 6.25 microgram/ml. T-3811 was the most active agent against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and streptococci, including penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP). T-3811 also showed potent activity against quinolone-resistant gram-positive cocci with GyrA and ParC (GrlA) mutations. The activity of T-3811 against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and nonfermentative gram-negative rods was comparable to that of trovafloxacin. In common with other fluoroquinolones, T-3811 was highly active against Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Legionella sp., with MIC90s of 0.0125 to 0.1 microgram/ml. T-3811 showed a potent activity against anaerobic bacteria, such as Bacteroides fragilis and Clostridium difficile. T-3811 was the most active agent against C. trachomatis (MIC, 0.008 microgram/ml) and M. pneumoniae (MIC90, 0.0313 microgram/ml). The activity of T-3811 against M. tuberculosis (MIC90, 0.0625 microgram/ml) was potent and superior to that of trovafloxacin. In experimental systemic infection with a GrlA mutant of S. aureus and experimental pneumonia with PRSP in mice, T-3811ME showed excellent therapeutic efficacy in oral and subcutaneous administrations.
TI  - Oropharynx microbiota among alcoholics and non-alcoholics.
AB  - CONTEXT: The oropharynx microbiota plays an important role in the origin of infections, especially among alcoholics whose airway defenses are impaired. OBJECTIVE: To compare the normal oropharingeal flora in heavy alcohol drinker and non-alcoholics. PATIENTS: 117 persons, 58 heavy alcohol drinkers and 59 non-alcoholics. SETTING: Santa Casa de Sao Paulo Emergency Service. DESIGN: A blind prospective study. MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES: Prevalence of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, and fungi. RESULTS: The study of the oropharynx microbiota among heavy alcohol drinkers demonstrated the presence of anaerobic microorganisms in 84.5% of them, including: Bacteroides sp, Prevotella melaninogenica, Fusobacterium sp, Veilonella sp, Peptostreptococcus sp, Propionibacterium sp, Bifidobacterium sp and Clostridium sp, versus 30.5% (p < 0.005) of non-alcoholics. Candida sp was present in 34.5% of heavy alcohol drinkers and 5.1% of non-alcoholics (p < 0.005). Enterobacteria predominated among heavy alcohol drinkers (25%) compared with non-alcoholics (5.5%) only in the age group 14 to 34 years (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Based upon these results, it was possible to conclude that the knowledge of the oropharynx microbiota among heavy drinkers and non-alcoholics has an important predictive value concerning probable etiologic agents of lower airway infections. Infections caused by anaerobic microorganisms and fungi should be taken into consideration during the choice of empirical therapy for heavy alcohol drinkers.
TI  - Cloning of an EF-P homologue from Bacteroides fragilis that increases B. fragilis glutamine synthetase activity in Escherichia coli.
AB  - Investigations of possible regulators of Bacteroides fragilis glutamine synthetase (GS) activity were done in Escherichia coli using a compatible dual-plasmid system. The B. fragilis glnA gene, together with upstream and downstream flanking regions, was cloned onto the low copy number plasmid pACYC184 and expressed in the E. coli glnA ntrB ntrC deletion strain, YMC11. GS activity was monitored following co-transformation with a B. fragilis genomic library carried on the compatible plasmid pEcoR251. A gene was cloned that caused a twofold increase in B. fragilis GS activity but did not affect the activity of the E. coli GS enzyme or the B. fragilis sucrase (ScrL). Deletion of the B. fragilis glnA downstream region decreased basal levels of GS activity, but did not affect the ability of the cloned gene to increase the B. fragilis GS activity. Reporter gene analysis, using the B. fragilis glnA promoter region fused to the promoterless Clostridium acetobutylicum endoglucanase gene, showed no increase in reporter gene activity. This demonstrated that the increase in GS activity was not regulated at the transcriptional level, and that the cloned gene product was not affecting the copy number of the plasmid in trans. Sequence data indicated that the cloned gene had good amino acid identity to a range of elongation factor P (EF-P) proteins, the highest being to that of a Synechocystis sp (48%), and the least to Mycobacterium genitalium (27%). Amino acid identity to the E. coli EF-P was intermediate (37%). A possible role for EF-P in enhancing translation of the B. fragilis glnA mRNA is proposed.
TI  - In-vitro activity of spiramycin and metronidazole alone or in combination against clinical isolates from odontogenic abscesses.
AB  - One hundred and forty-eight isolates of bacteria from 20 intraoral odontogenic abscesses were tested for their susceptibility to spiramycin and metronidazole alone or in combination. All isolates, except Rothia spp. (one), Enterococcus avium (three), Haemophilus parainfluenzae (one) and Staphylococcus aureus (one) were sensitive to spiramycin and/or metronidazole. Among the anaerobes, spiramycin as well as metronidazole showed good antimicrobial activity against species of Prevotella, Eubacterium, Peptostreptococcus, Bacteroides and Porphyromonas. All the aerobes were resistant to metronidazole. A potential synergic effect was found in 17% of the clinical isolates tested, as the MICs of spiramycin and metronidazole for 25 isolates (21 isolates of Eubacterium, two of lactobacilli, one strain of Peptostreptococcus sp. and one Clostridium clostridiiforme) were significantly reduced by the addition of the other antibiotic.
TI  - The intestinal microflora during the first weeks of life.
AB  - Bacterial colonization of the neonatal gastrointestinal tract begins during birth when the neonate comes into contact with the maternal cervical and vaginal flora. In infants delivered by Caesarean section, bacteria colonizing the neonate gastrointestinal tract are provided by the environment. The first bacteria encountered in the majority of healthy infants, are facultative anaerobes, which remain predominant during the first 2 weeks of life. Among them, Staphylococcus, Enterobacteriaceae and Streptococcus were the genera most commonly isolated from the newborn faecal flora at birth. Facultative anaerobic bacteria are followed closely by Bifidobacterium sp. Clostridium perfringens is present within 2 days with an increase incidence in newborns delivered by a Caesarean section. Clostridium perfringens seems to be the precursor for installation of other anaerobic putrefactive bacteria, as Bacteroides and other Clostridium sp. The impact of Caesarean section and the period and quality of hospitalization are mainly implicated in changes of the normal newborn flora. Feeding seems to modulate the colonization pattern. In humans, breast milk plays a role in passive immunization of the neonatal intestine, and contains factors that promote the growth of Bifidobacterium bifidum in the intestinal flora. Formula feeding seems to promote implantation and persistence of Clostridium perfringens, and clearly enhances intestinal colonization of C. difficile in newborns.
TI  - Pyomyositis in children, caused by anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The author describes the microbiology and clinical features of six pyomyositis infections in children, which yielded anaerobic bacteria. Anaerobic bacteria alone were recovered in four instances, and they are mixed with facultative bacteria in two. There were 15 bacterial isolates (13 anaerobic, 2 facultative). The bacteria were Peptostreptococcus sp (5 isolates), Bacteroides fragilis (3), Clostridium sp (2), Fuso-bacterium nucleatum (1), Prevotella sp (1), Bateroides sp (1), Streptococcus pyogenes (1), and Escherichia coli (1). Recent trauma or injury had occurred in five cases; three such injuries were from penetrating objects. This study highlights the potential importance of anaerobic bacteria in children with pyomyositis.
TI  - Bacteroides infections in children.
AB  - From 1974 to 1990, 336 Bacteroides isolates were obtained from 312 specimens from 274 patients. They comprised 180 (54%) B. fragilis isolates, 55 (16%) B. theta-iotaomicron, 36 (11%) B. vulgatus, 34 (10%) B. distasonis, 21 (6%) B. ovatus and 10 (3%) B. uniformis. Infections in 253 (92%) patients were polymicrobial, but in 21 (8%) children, a Bacteroides sp. was isolated in pure culture. Most Bacteroides isolates were from peritoneal fluid (114), abscesses (110), wound infections (20), blood cultures (10) and from patients with pneumonia (14) or chronic otitis media (8). Predisposing conditions were present in 145 (53%) children; these were previous surgery (46), trauma (28), malignancy (21), prematurity (19), immunodeficiency (18), steroid therapy (12) foreign body (10), diabetes (9) and sickle cell disease (7). The micro-organisms isolated most commonly mixed with Bacteroides spp. were anaerobic cocci (221), Escherichia coli (122), Fusobacterium spp. (38) and Clostridium spp. (30). All patients received antimicrobial therapy in conjunction with surgical drainage or correction of pathology in 197 (72%) cases. All but 12 (5%) patients recovered. These data illustrate the importance of Bacteroides spp. in infections in children.
TI  - Microbiology of secondary bacterial infection in scabies lesions.
AB  - Aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were grown from specimens obtained from 30 children with secondarily infected scabies lesions. Aerobic or facultative bacteria only were present in 14 (47%) patients, anaerobic bacteria only were present in 6 (20%) patients, and a mixed anaerobic-aerobic flora was present in 10 (33%) patients. Fifty isolates were recovered (1.7 per specimen); 27 were aerobic or facultative bacteria and 23 were strict anaerobes. The predominant aerobic and facultative bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus (nine isolates), group A streptococci (five isolates), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (three isolates). The predominant anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus sp. (nine isolates) and pigmented Prevotella and Porphyromonas spp. (four isolates). Single bacterial isolates were recovered from nine (30%) patients; five of these were S. aureus. Sixteen organisms isolated from 12 (40%) patients produced the enzyme beta-lactamase. Organisms that resided in the mucous membranes close to or in contact with the lesions predominated in those infections. Enteric gram-negative rods were recovered in leg and trunk lesions. Group A streptococci and S. aureus predominated in finger and hand lesions. Bacteroides fragilis group and Clostridium sp. were isolated from leg lesions, and pigmented Prevotella sp. and Porphyromonas and Fusobacterium spp. were recovered from finger lesions. The polymicrobial etiology of secondarily infected scabies lesions in children and the association of bacterial flora with the anatomical sites of the lesions are demonstrated.
TI  - Phylogenetic evidence that the gram-negative nonsporulating bacterium Tissierella (Bacteroides) praeacuta is a member of the Clostridium subphylum of the gram-positive bacteria and description of Tissierella creatinini sp. nov.
AB  - The 16S rRNA gene sequence of the type strain of Tissierella praeacuta (formerly  Bacteroides praeacutus) was determined by PCR direct sequencing. A comparative sequence analysis showed that T. praeacuta is a member of the Clostridium subphylum of the gram-positive bacteria and has a close phylogenetic affinity with the species that form Clostridium cluster XII (M. D. Collins, P. A. Lawson, A. Willems, J. J. Cordoba, J. Fernandez-Garayzabal, P. Garcia, J. Cai, H. Hippe, and J. A. E. Farrow, Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 44:812-826, 1994). Although T. praeacuta is gram negative and does not produce endospores, 16S rRNA sequence data showed that it is closely related genealogically (level of sequence similarity, 99.9%) to Clostridium hastiforme. On the basis of our results and the results of previous studies, a second species of Tissierella, Tissierella creatinini sp. nov., is described.
TI  - Clinical features and aerobic and anaerobic microbiological characteristics of cellulitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the aerobic and anaerobic microbiological characteristics of cellulitis and correlate them with the infection site. DESIGN: Of 342 specimens, 64 obtained using needle aspiration and 278 using swabs were studied over 10 years. RESULTS: Bacterial growth was noted in 15 (23%) of the 64 needle aspirates and 259 (93%) of the 278 swab aspirates. The microbial results of the 15 specimens obtained through needle aspiration are separately presented. Aerobic or facultative bacteria only were present in 138 (53%) of swab samples, anaerobic bacteria only in 69 (27%), and mixed aerobic-anaerobic flora in 52 (20%). In total, there were 582 isolates, 247 aerobic or facultative and 335 anaerobic bacteria, with an average of 2.2 isolates per specimen. The predominance of certain isolates in different anatomical sites correlated with their distribution in the normal flora adjacent to the infected site. The highest recovery rates of anaerobes was from the neck, trunk, groin, external genitalia, and leg areas. Aerobes outnumbered anaerobes in the arm and hand. The predominant aerobes were Staphylococcus aureus, group A streptococci, and Escherichia coli. The predominant anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus sp, Bacteroides fragilis group, Prevotella and Porphyromonas sp, and Clostridium sp. Certain clinical findings correlated with the following organisms: swelling and tenderness with Clostridium sp, Prevotella sp, S aureus, and group A streptococci; regional adenopathy with B fragilis group; bulbous lesions with Enterobacteriaceae; gangrene and necrosis with Peptostreptococcus sp, B fragilis group, Clostridium sp, and Enterobacteriaceae; foul odor with Bacteroides sp; and gas in tissues with Peptostreptococcus sp, B fragilis group and Clostridium sp. Certain predisposing conditions correlated with the following organisms: trauma with Clostridium sp; diabetes with Bacteroides sp, Enterobacteriaceae, and S aureus; and burn with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. CONCLUSION: These data highlight the polymicrobial nature of cellulitis.
TI  - [Susceptibility of bacteria isolated from clinical material to ciprofloxacin].
AB  - The aim of the study was to evaluate susceptibility to ciprofloxacin of bacteria  species isolated from different specimens of clinical materials. The investigated strains (830) were identified using conventional methods. The antibacterial activity of ciprofloxacin was studied by the method of drug dilution in Mueller-Hinton agar. Among aerobic bacteria, only 5 strains (0.6%) were resistant to ciprofloxacin in concentration 4 micrograms/ml; two belonged to E. coli species, two to S. aureus and one was a Streptococcus group B., Corynebacterium sp. MIC90 = 0.12 microgram/ml turned out to be most resistant, next, Gram-negative rods MIC90 = 0.5 microgram/ml, coagulase-negative and positive staphylococci and Neisseria sp. MIC90 = 1.0 microgram/ml. Enterococcus faecalis and anaerobes were the least susceptible to ciprofloxacin. Their MIC90 was 2 and 16 micrograms/ml respectively. Among 20 anaerobic strains, up to 10 were resistant to ciprofloxacin, mainly from Bacteroides and Clostridium genus.
TI  - The role of encapsulated anaerobic bacteria in synergistic infections.
AB  - The effect of encapsulation on the virulence, survival, and protection of anaerobic bacteria from phagocytosis is reviewed. Support for the importance of encapsulated Gram-negative anaerobic rods (Bacteroides sp., Prevotella sp. and Porphyromonas sp.), anaerobic and facultative Gram-positive cocci (AFGPC) was provided by their higher recovery rate in oropharyngeal infections, abscesses and blood, compared to their number in the normal flora. The pathogenicity of Bacteroides, Fusobacterium, Clostridium, and AFGPC was studied by inoculating them into mice and observing their ability to induce subcutaneous abscesses. Encapsulated Bacteroides, Fusobacteria, and AFGPC generally induced abscesses, whereas non-encapsulated organisms did not. However, many of the strains that had only a minimal number of encapsulated organisms (< 1%) survived in the abscesses, and they became heavily encapsulated when inoculated with other viable or non-viable encapsulated bacteria. Thereafter, these strains were able to induce abscesses when injected alone. Encapsulated Gram-negative anaerobic rods and AFGPC-induced bacteraemia and translocation, and increased the mortality of the infected animals more often than did the non-encapsulated form of the same strains. As determined by using selective antimicrobial therapy and quantitative cultures of abscesses induced in mice, possession of a capsule generally made Gram-negative anaerobic rods more important than their aerobic counterparts. Synergistic potentials were seen between encapsulated Gram-negative anaerobic rods and all tested aerobic bacteria and most AFGPC, and also between most AFGPC and Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Staphylococcus aureus. These studies demonstrated the importance of encapsulated anaerobes in mixed infections.
TI  - Effect of different combinations of antibiotics on experimental septic peritonitis in rabbits.
AB  - This study was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy of different combinations of antimicrobial agents in the treatment of experimental septic peritonitis. Two hundred rabbits, divided into ten groups of 20 rabbits each, were used. Septic peritonitis was provoked in two stages: treatment of animals by mechanical lavage or antibiotics was performed during the first stage; blood cultures, isolation and identification of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in the peritoneal cavity were performed during the second stage. The parameters assessed were survival and, in the second phase, the formation of peritoneal abscesses. The most significant finding was noted in the first phase, where diffuse peritonitis took place, with a very high mortality rate due to bacteremia and sepsis. In both blood and pus from the peritoneal cavity cultures in all groups, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis (among the aerobes) and Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium sp. and Peptostreptococcus sp. (among anaerobes) were the predominant pathogens identified. High mortality rates appeared to be due to the aerobic microbes, particularly Escherichia coli, whereas abscess formation was related to the anaerobes, particularly Bacteroides fragilis. All antibiotics tested were effective, whether alone or in combination. Metronidazole, however, was the most effective in the reduction of intraabdominal abscesses. The lowest mortality rate was observed in animals injected with piperacillin and a combination of cefoxitin and an aminoglycoside with metronidazole. Finally, good peritoneal lavage seemed to be as effective as any combination of antibiotic treatment.
TI  - Increase of mannose residues, as Salmonella typhimurium-adhering factor, on the cecal mucosa of germ-free chickens infected with Eimeria tenella.
AB  - To study increase of the Salmonella population in the cecum of chickens infected  with Eimeria tenella, quantitative changes in mannose residues on the cecal mucosa were investigated. Inhibition of S typhimurium adherence to the cecum by a 2% carbohydrate (D-mannose, D-galactose, L-fucose, alpha-methyl-D-glucoside) in phosphate-buffered saline solution was examined. Only D-mannose had inhibitory effects. Whereas, D-galactose had somewhat enhancing effects on adherence of S typhimurium to the cecal mucosa of uninfected germ-free chickens. In infected and uninfected chickens, D-mannose inhibited adherence of S typhimurium. D-Mannose significantly (P < 0.05) increased adherence of Bacteroides sp. In infected and uninfected chickens, D-mannose did not have any effect on adherence of Clostridium perfringens and Bifidobacterium thermophilum. Under microscopic observation, only concanavalin A and Lens culinaris agglutinin, of 8 lectins examined, were recognized as lectin-positive staining lines or spots in the cecal mucosa, indicating presence of mannose residues on the cecal mucosa. In E tenella-infected chickens, lectin-positive staining was seen strongly on the coarse surface of damaged cells and at the bottom of the crypts. These results indicate that coccidial infection may induce increase of mannose residues on the intestinal surface and allow adhesion of more salmonellae to the intestine.
TI  - Value of cultures of tissue samples taken at operation for lower intestinal perforation.
AB  - Tissue cultures from perforations of the lower intestinal tract commonly yield both aerobes (coliform organisms) and anaerobes (Bacteroides sp. and Clostridium sp.). To determine the consistency of this pattern and the value of intraoperative cultures, the authors reviewed the hospital records of 115 patients with perforation of the appendix (100 patients) or colon (15 patients), treated between 1987 and 1990, in whom organisms were cultured from tissue samples taken intraoperatively. Attention was paid to the organisms cultured, their distribution and antibiotic sensitivity in initial samples and in subsequent samples obtained when there were septic complications. On average, 4.7 bacterial isolates per patient were obtained. The common organisms were as expected: Bacteroides fragilis, Escherichia coli and Clostridium sp. Although the culture results did not affect the management of these patients, the sensitivity of Bacteroides fragilis to cefoxitin was found to be lower than expected, indicating a shift in sensitivity.
TI  - [The role anaerobes in dermatitis digitalis et interdigitalis in cattle].
AB  - Altogether 52 tissue samples and swabs from the corium of the claw of diseased cattle were investigated. Microbiological examinations revealed the presence of 11 strictly anaerobic bacterial strains that belonged to the species Peptococcus asacharolyticus, Pc. sacharolyticus, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Bacteroides asacharolyticus and B. melaninogenicus. The remaining isolates were classified as Bacteroides, Fusobacterium, Streptococcus and Clostridium. In the above-mentioned strains observations of their biochemical, morphological and enzymatic properties (Tab. I) were carried out. Their resistance to antibiotics was evaluated from the qualitative viewpoint (Tab. II). Capillary isotachophoresis was used to determine the amounts of volatile fatty acids that developed during glucose fermentation (Tab. III). In the single clinical samples the above-mentioned strains occurred as association of microorganism. The anaerobic genera Bacteroides and Fusobacterium were found in 52% of the samples (Bacteroides sp. and Fusobacterium sp. were recorded in 25% and 12% of the samples, respectively, whereas in 15% of the samples both species occurred). According to our results the etiology of dermatitis digitalis et interdigitalis is closely connected with the incidence of anaerobes. Of the latter, those belonging to the genera Bacteroides and Fusobacterium are of major importance.
TI  - Antibacterial in vitro-activity of meropenem against 200 clinical isolates in comparison to 11 selected antibiotics.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of meropenem, a new parenteral carbapenem, was tested  in vitro by an agar dilution method against 200 clinical isolates (gram-negative/positive aerobes and anaerobes). Meropenem was compared with imipenem, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, piperacillin, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin; and metronidazole, cefoxitin, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, vancomycin when appropriate. Meropenem and imipenem exhibited an extended spectrum of activity with low minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs). Only one strain each of Enterococcus faecium and Pseudomonas (Xanthomonas) maltophilia were resistant. Of the carbapenems, imipenem was slightly more active against Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus agalactiae, and staphylococci, but meropenem was obviously more active against enterobacteriaceae and Clostridium perfringens. Both, meropenem and imipenem had similar activities towards Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Streptococcus pyogenes and Bacteroides sp. All other antibiotics tested were less potent than the carbapenems with the exception of ciprofloxacin which generally exhibited similar antibacterial activities, except for anaerob microorganisms.
TI  - New selective medium for isolating Clostridium difficile from faeces.
AB  - AIMS: To compare CCFA (cycloserine, cefoxitin fructose agar) with a new selective medium CDMN (containing cysteine hydrochloride, norfloxacin, and moxalactam) for the isolation of Clostridium difficile after direct faecal culture. METHODS: The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of norfloxacin was determined for 64 strains of C difficile, 17 strains of other Clostridium sp, and 66 various isolates of faecal origin, together with MIC determinations of moxalactam against the 81 strains of Clostridium sp and 15 isolates of Bacteroides sp. Using C difficile agar base with 0.5 g/l of cysteine hydrochloride, norfloxacin and moxalactam were incorporated into the medium and compared with CCFA for the isolation of C difficile after direct faecal culture. RESULTS: Norfloxacin (12 mg/l) inhibited the growth of enterobacteriaceae and faecal streptococci; moxalactam (32 mg/l) inhibited the growth of most strains of Bacteroides sp tested, together with Clostridium sp other than C difficile. Using the antibiotics in combination (CDMN), the growth and colonial morphology of 64 strains of C difficile were unaffected. When CDMN medium was compared with CCFA for the isolation of C difficile from 832 faeces from inpatients with diarrhoea, the CDMN agar isolated 20% more strains and reduced the number of contaminating colonies by 30%. CONCLUSIONS: CDMN both improves the isolation rate of C difficile from faecal specimens and reduces the growth of other organisms compared with CCFA.
TI  - Supplementation of an adapted formula with bovine lactoferrin: 1. Effect on the infant faecal flora.
AB  - The development of the infant faecal flora was studied over the first three months of life in infants receiving breast milk, a modern adapted formula and adaptations of this formula. Breast-fed infants developed a flora rich in Bifidobacterium sp. Facultative anaerobes were ubiquitous, but in relatively small numbers within the diet group. Other obligate anaerobes, such as Clostridium sp. and Bacteriodes sp. were rarely isolated. Standard formula produced a flora rich in bifidobacteria, but the growth of facultative organisms was not suppressed by this diet. Clostridium sp. and Bacteroides sp. were more common in this feeding group. After the addition of lactoferrin at 10 mg/100 ml to the formula diet, a flora similar to that of the standard formula-fed babies was achieved. Lactoferrin at 100 mg/100 ml was able to establish a "bifidus flora" in half of the babies given this formula, but only at age three months. Clostridium sp. and Bacteroides sp. were common faecal isolates from babies receiving both the lactoferrin diets.
TI  - The acute phase of experimental infection with Trypanosoma cruzi is more severe in mice monoassociated with strict anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - 1. The influence of some components of the normal human intestinal flora on the acute phase of experimental infection with strain CL of Trypanosoma cruzi was studied in 30-day-old germ-free or gnotobiotic CFW (LOB) mice monoassociated with Bacteroides fragilis, Peptostreptococcus sp or Clostridium sp by intragastric inoculation of 10(6) bacteria 10 days before the intraperitoneal infection with 5 x 10(3) trypomastigotes/g body weight. 2. Significantly earlier parasitemia peak and mortality were observed in Bacteroides fragilis- and Clostridium-associated mice (16.75 +/- 0.96 and 15.00 +/- 1.15 days, respectively) when compared with germfree animals (18.83 +/- 1.17 days). More precocious mortality (10.40 +/- 2.06 days) and, curiously, much lower blood parasitemia were observed in Peptostreptococcus-associated mice than in other gnotobiotic mice. 3. The extent of cardiac tissue parasitism decreased in the following order: germfree, B. fragilis-associated, Clostridium-associated, and Peptostreptococcus-associated animals. The levels of inflammatory reaction decreased in the following order: germfree, Peptostreptococcus-associated, Clostridium-associated, and B. fragilis-associated mice. 4. These results show that the acute phase of experimental infection with T. cruzi was more severe in mice associated with strict anaerobic bacteria when compared with germfree animals. This suggests that a normal intestinal flora may be another factor, in addition to nutritional and genetic factors, responsible for the different susceptibility of organisms of the same species infected with T. cruzi.
TI  - Oral associated bacterial infection in horses: studies on the normal anaerobic flora from the pharyngeal tonsillar surface and its association with lower respiratory tract and paraoral infections.
AB  - Two hundred and seventy bacterial isolates were obtained from the pharyngeal tonsillar surface of 12 normal horses and 98 obligatory anaerobic bacteria were characterised. Of these, 57 isolates belonging to 7 genera (Peptostreptococcus (1); Eubacterium (9); Clostridium (6); Veillonella (6); Megasphera (1); Bacteroides (28); Fusobacterium (6)) were identified, and 16 of these were identified to species level (P. anaerobius (1); E. fossor (9); C. villosum (1); B. fragilis (1); B. tectum (2); B. heparinolyticus (2)). Three hundred and twenty isolates were obtained from 23 samples from horses with lower respiratory tract (LRT) or paraoral (PO) bacterial infections. Of the 143 bacteria selected for detailed characterisation, obligate anaerobes accounted for 100 isolates, facultative anaerobes for 42 isolates and obligate aerobes for one isolate. Phenotypic characterisation separated 99 of the isolates into 14 genera. Among the obligately anaerobic species, Gram-positive cocci including P. anaerobius comprised 25% of isolates, E. fossor 11% and other Gram-positive rods (excluding Clostridium sp.) 18% of isolates. The Gram-negative rods comprised B. fragilis 5%, B. heparinolyticus 5%, asaccharolytic pigmented Bacteroides 3% and other Bacteroides 13%, while a so-far unnamed species of Fusobacterium (7%), and Gram-negative corroding rods (3%) were isolated. Among the facultatively anaerobic isolates, S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus accounted for 31% of isolates, followed by Pasteurella spp. 19%, Escherichia coli 17%, Actinomyces spp. 9%, Streptococcus spp. 9%. Incidental facultative isolates were Enterococcus spp. 2%, Enterobacter cloaceae 2%, Actinobacillus spp. 2% and Gram-negative corroding rods 5%. On the basis of the similarities (as determined by DNA hybridization data and/or phenotypic characteristics) of some of the bacterial species (e.g. E. fossor and B. heparinolyticus) isolated from both the normal pharyngeal tonsillar surfaces and LRT and PO diseases of horses, it is considered that the most likely source of bacteria involved in these disease processes is flora from the oral cavity.
TI  - [Influence of cefodizime via intravenous bolus injection on human fecal flora].
AB  - Cefodizime (CDZM), a newly developed injectable cephem antibiotic, was given to 8 healthy male volunteers with ages 23-28 years (mean: 24 years) and body weights 54-73 kg (mean: 64 kg). 4 volunteers received 2 g b.i.d., intravenous infusion for 5 days, and 4 volunteers had 4 g b.i.d. for the same duration. We studied changes in bacterial flora and drug levels in feces, as well as changes in susceptibility of isolated microbes to CDZM, cefmetazole, cefotaxime (CTX) and cefoperazone. Adverse drug reactions and changes in laboratory findings were also investigated. The following results were obtained. 1. In fecal flora for the 2 g b.i.d. group, on day 3 of treatment Enterobacteriaceae were identified in only 2 of the 4 cases. Individual microbe counts decreased or fell below detection limit (10(2) cells/g) on day 3 of treatment. Colony forming units (CFUs) of Enterobacteriaceae on day 5 of treatment were similar to those on day 3. After the end of treatment, its CFUs increased. The mean CFU of Enterobacteriaceae on day 10 after the end of treatment increased to about the same level as before dosing. However, some microbes did not revert to pretreatment levels. Of other Gram-negative bacilli, Pseudomonas sp. increased in one case transiently on day 3 of treatment. After day 3 of treatment, its CFU decreased. Gram-positive microbes showed various changes. Mean CFU of yeast like organism (YLO) increased between day 3 of treatment and day 3 after the end of treatment and its mean CFU decreased on day 10 after the treatment. As for anaerobes, CFUs of Bacteroides fragilis group organisms and overall anaerobes showed no distinctive changes. Clostridium difficile were detected in two cases. In one case, C. difficile was noted at levels between 1.1 X 10(3) cells/g and 2.0 X 10(6) cells/g at the following sampling times: days 1 and 3 of treatment and days 3, 5, 10 and 20 after the end of treatment. In other case, it was noted at levels of 1.8 X 10(5) cells/g on day 20 after the end of treatment. D-1 toxin was detected in one case before dosing, and in three cases (the concentration of D-1 toxin was 250 ng/g or 500 ng/g) on day after treatment. Enterobacteriaceae in fecal flora of 4 cases given 4 g b.i.d. frequently decreased or fell below detection limit on days 3 and 5 of treatment and day 3 after the end of treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Azoreductase activity of anaerobic bacteria isolated from human intestinal microflora.
AB  - A plate assay was developed for the detection of anaerobic bacteria that produce  azoreductases. With this plate assay, 10 strains of anaerobic bacteria capable of reducing azo dyes were isolated from human feces and identified as Eubacterium hadrum (2 strains), Eubacterium spp. (2 species), Clostridium clostridiiforme, a Butyrivibrio sp., a Bacteroides sp., Clostridium paraputrificum, Clostridium nexile, and a Clostridium sp. The average rate of reduction of Direct Blue 15 dye (a dimethoxybenzidine-based dye) in these strains ranged from 16 to 135 nmol of dye per min per mg of protein. The enzymes were inactivated by oxygen. In seven isolates, a flavin compound (riboflavin, flavin adenine dinucleotide, or flavin mononucleotide) was required for azoreductase activity. In the other three isolates and in Clostridium perfringens, no added flavin was required for activity. Nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that each bacterium expressed only one azoreductase isozyme. At least three types of azoreductase enzyme were produced by the different isolates. All of the azoreductases were produced constitutively and released extracellularly.
TI  - Relationship of bacteriologic characteristics to semen indices in men attending an infertility clinic.
AB  - Bacteria can be isolated from most seminal fluid samples, but the significance of these microorganisms is uncertain because most men lack symptoms associated with bacterial infection of the reproductive tract. We obtained semen samples from 37 men attending a Special Infertility Clinic and assessed the relationship between seminal fluid microorganisms and seminal fluid analysis including sperm motility, morphology, and concentration; the numbers of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and other white blood cells; and the hamster zona-free oocyte sperm penetration assay. Aerobic and/or anaerobic bacteria were recovered from 36 of the 37 samples. One hundred eighty-eight isolates (113 aerobes, 74 anaerobes, and one yeast) were recovered, with a mean of 5.2 isolates per semen specimen. The microorganisms recovered from the samples included: coagulase-negative staphylococci (89%), viridans streptococci (65%), diphtheroids (86%), Peptostreptococcus sp (62%), Bacteroides sp (27%), Gardnerella vaginalis (19%), Lactobacillus sp (16%), Actinomyces sp (16%), Enterococcus (11%), and Veillonella (11%). Other microorganisms including group B streptococcus, Hemophilus, Escherichia coli, Mobiluncus, and Clostridium were each recovered from fewer than 10% of the specimens. When the microbiology of seminal fluid specimens with or without polymorphonuclear leukocytes was compared, the presence of polymorphonuclear leukocytes in the semen was not associated with the isolation of staphylococci (33 versus 25%), viridans streptococci (33 versus 28%), Bacteroides sp (17 versus 37%), or Peptostreptococcus (31 versus 33%) (P greater than .05 for each comparison). The proportion of semen samples yielding bacterial isolates was similar after categorization by normal motility (more than 60%), pyospermia (six or more leukocytes per 100 sperm), sperm concentration, morphology, and a normal sperm penetration assay (11% or more).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Digestive tract microflora liberates low molecular weight peptides with immunotriggering activity.
AB  - Antibiotic digestive tract decontamination in BALB/c-mice resulted in a significant reduction of peritoneal macrophage function and lymphocyte proliferation. Considerable evidence has accumulated showing that certain species of the indigenous gastrointestinal (GI)-tract microflora, e.g. Bacteroides sp., Clostridium sp., Lactobacillus sp., and Propionibacterium sp., liberate low molecular weight peptides which are able to trigger basic immune responses. Eradication of the GI-tract microflora apparently results in a lack of peptide production correlating to immunosuppression in experimental BALB/c-mice. Substitution of peptides in GI-tract decontaminated mice reconstituted macrophage function as well as proliferation of lymphatic tissue.
TI  - Multicenter in vitro comparison of piperacillin and nine other antibacterials against 1,629 clinical isolates.
AB  - The antibacterial spectrum of activity of piperacillin was compared with that of  other antibiotics against isolates of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas cepacia, Pseudomonas maltophilia, Serratia marcescens, Enterococcus sp, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides bivius, and Clostridium difficile obtained from laboratories at hospitals in St. Louis, in Memphis, and in Newark, New Jersey. Of the 1,629 isolates tested, 91% were susceptible to piperacillin, 90% to mezlocillin, 87% to ticarcillin/clavulanate and imipenem, 83% to ceftazidime, 81% to cefoperazone, 80% to ciprofloxacin, 77% to ceftriaxone, 71% to aztreonam, and 51% to cefoxitin.
TI  - Apparition of Clostridium sp. and Bacteroides in the intestine of the newborn delivered by cesarian section.
AB  - Anaerobic flora plays a key role in preventing intestinal colonization with potential pathogens. Nowadays, the mechanisms involved in the colonization resistance provided by the anaerobic microflora are to be clarified. Numerous factors seem to intervene in the regulation of the intestinal flora. The purpose of the present study was to correlate the presence or relative absence of Clostridium sp. and Bacteroides with the colonization by C. perfringens, which is involved in lethal infections in an immunologically compromised host. The intestinal bacterial colonization of 20 newborns delivered by cesarian section was assessed sequentially over the first 14 days of life. C. perifringens is a strongly reducing microorganism and undoubtedly causes a decrease in the oxidoreduction potential of the newborn feces favouring the subsequent colonization by other putrefactive bacteria. C. perfringens seems to be the precursor for installation of putrefractive bacteria, as Bacteroides and other Clostridium sp.
TI  - Accuracy and reproducibility of the 4-hour ATB 32A method for anaerobe identification.
AB  - The ATB 32A system (API System SA, La Balme les Grottes, Montalieu-Vercieu, France) was evaluated for use in the identification of 214 anaerobes. Organisms included 73 isolates of the Bacteroides fragilis group, 24 Bacteroides spp., 10 fusobacteria, 43 clostridia, 28 cocci, and 36 gram-positive, nonsporeforming rods. With the concomitant use of Gram stain, pigmentation, catalase testing, and aerobic growth, the ATB 32A system correctly identified 97% of the B. fragilis group isolates, 88% of Bacteroides spp., 50% of fusobacteria, 74% of clostridia, 100% of cocci, and 86% of the gram-positive, nonsporeforming rods. Overall, 188 strains (88%) were correctly identified, with 18 (8%) requiring extra tests, other than the four mentioned above, for correct identification. Eight strains were misidentified, including one Bacteroides sp., three fusobacteria, one Clostridium sp., and three gram-positive, nonsporeforming rods. Reproducibility was very good, with 12 of 14 strains (86%) tested in triplicate yielding identical correct results on each of three occasions and 2 strains (14%) yielding identical correct results on two occasions. There was a low-probability identification (including the correct species) on the third testing. The ATB 32A system represents a worthwhile advance in systems used for the identification of clinically significant anaerobic bacteria.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of biliary tract disease.
AB  - A retrospective analysis of the experiences of two military hospitals over 4 years in the recovery of organisms from biliary tract specimens was done. Bacterial growth was obtained in 123 bile specimens. Aerobic and facultative bacteria only were present in 59 specimens (48%), aerobic bacteria only were present in 4 specimens (3%), and mixed anaerobic and aerobic or facultative bacteria were present in 60 specimens (49%). Of 286 isolates recovered, 216 were aerobic or facultative (1.8 per specimen) and 70 were anaerobic (0.6 per specimen). The predominant bacteria were Escherichia coli (71 isolates), group D streptococci (42 isolates), Klebsiella sp. (29 isolates), Clostridium sp. (27 isolates), Bacteroides sp. (28 isolates), and Enterobacter sp. (16 isolates). Polymicrobial infections were present in 108 instances (88%). A higher recovery rate of anaerobes was present in patients with chronic infections than in those with acute infections and did not correlate with the presence of gallstones or use of antimicrobial prophylaxis.
TI  - Bacteriotherapy for chronic relapsing Clostridium difficile diarrhoea in six patients.
AB  - Six patients with chronic relapsing diarrhoea caused by Clostridium difficile were treated with rectal instillation of homologous faeces (one patient) or a mixture of ten different facultatively aerobic and anaerobic bacteria diluted in sterile saline (five patients). The mixture led to a prompt loss of Cl difficile and its toxin from the stools and to bowel colonisation by Bacteroides sp, which had not been present in pre-treatment stool samples. Strains of Escherichia coli, Cl bifermentans, and Peptostreptococcus productus in the mixture inhibited the in-vitro growth of Cl difficile, which in turn inhibited the growth of Bacteroides ovatus, Bacteroides vulgatus, and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron. The finding that Bacteroides sp had been absent during the patients' illness but was present after recovery suggests that the absence of Bacteroides sp may result in chronic relapsing Cl difficile diarrhoea, and that its presence may prevent colonisation by Cl difficile.
TI  - [Aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora of crural ulcers].
AB  - In a group of 600 patients treated in the Metropolitan Dermatological Hospital in Warsaw bacteriological examination were carried out of swabs from the untreated crural ulcers. In 95% of these cultures growth of pathological aerobic organisms was obtained. Coagulase-positive staphylococci (St. aureus) and Gram-negative bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus vulgaris, Enterobacter sp and E. coli) prevailed. In 27% of cases the cultured strains were resistant to the generally available antibiotics. In the second group in 70 patients no growth of anaerobes exclusively was noted. Pathological aerobes and anaerobes in the same case were found in 45% of cultures. In the remaining ones pathogenic aerobes were present with a similar frequency as in the preceding group. Of the anaerobes the most frequently cultured species were Gram-negative bacteria such as Bacteroides melaninogenicus, Bacteroides sp, and Bacteroides fragilis. Among pathogenic anerobic cocci Peptostreptococcus and Peptococcus were most frequent. In 2 cases spore-forming anaerobic bacteria (Clostridium perfringens) were obtained. Forty-eight percent of anaerobes were resistant to the commonly used antibiotics.
TI  - Enumeration and isolation of cellulolytic and hemicellulolytic bacteria from human feces.
AB  - The fibrolytic microbiota of the human large intestine was examined to determine  the numbers and types of cellulolytic and hemicellulolytic bacteria present. Fecal samples from each of five individuals contained bacteria capable of degrading the hydrated cellulose in spinach and in wheat straw pretreated with alkaline hydrogen peroxide (AHP-WS), whereas degradation of the relatively crystalline cellulose in Whatman no. 1 filter paper (PMC) was detected for only one of the five samples. The mean concentration of cellulolytic bacteria, estimated with AHP-WS as a substrate, was 1.2 X 10(8)/ml of feces. Pure cultures of bacteria isolated on AHP-WS were able to degrade PMC, indicating that interactions with other microbes were primarily responsible for previous low success rates in detecting fecal cellulolytic bacteria with PMC as a substrate. The cellulolytic bacteria included Ruminococcus spp., Clostridium sp., and two unidentified strains. The mean concentration of hemicellulolytic bacteria, estimated with larchwood xylan as a substrate, was 1.8 X 10(10)/ml of feces. The hemicellulose-degrading bacteria included Butyrivibrio sp., Clostridium sp., Bacteroides sp., and two unidentified strains, as well as four of the five cellulolytic strains. This work demonstrates that many humans harbor intestinal cellulolytic bacteria and that a hydrated cellulose source such as AHP-WS is necessary for their consistent detection and isolation.
TI  - Recovery of anaerobic bacteria from clinical specimens in 12 years at two military hospitals.
AB  - Examination of 15,844 clinical specimens submitted over 12 years (1973 to 1985) to the anaerobic microbiology laboratories in two military hospitals demonstrated the recovery of anaerobic bacteria in 4,458 (28.1%) specimens. The specimens yielded 6,557 anaerobic isolates (1.47 isolates per specimen). Bacteroides spp. accounted for 43% of all isolates; anaerobic gram-positive cocci, 26%; Clostridium spp., 7%; and Fusobacterium spp., 4%. Bacteroides spp. predominated in abscesses, obstetrical and gynecological (OBG) infections, abdominal infections, cysts, wounds, and tumors. Members of the Bacteroides fragilis group accounted for 44% of all Bacteroides spp., and of them, B. fragilis was mostly isolated in abscesses, wounds, abdomen, and blood. Pigmented Bacteroides spp. accounted for 21% of all Bacteroides sp. isolates and were mostly isolated in sinus, eye, chest, bone, and ear infections. Bacteroides melaninogenicus accounted for 42% of this group's isolates. Bacteroides bivius accounted for 9% of Bacteroides spp., and most isolates were found in OBG infections. Anaerobic gram-positive cocci were mostly isolated in OBG infections, abscesses, and wounds. The predominant anaerobic gram-positive cocci were Peptostreptococcus magnus (18%), Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus (17%), Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (16%), and Peptostreptococcus prevotii (13%). Clostridium spp. were mostly isolated from wounds, abscesses, abdominal infections, and blood. The predominant strain was Clostridium perfringens (48%). Fusobacterium spp. were recovered in abscesses and abdominal and OBG infections. The predominant isolate was Fusobacterium nucleatum (47%). These data illustrate the relative frequency of the different anaerobic bacteria in a variety of infections and demonstrate the predominance of certain isolates at different sites.
TI  - Comparative study of cefotetan and cefoxitin in the treatment of intra-abdominal  infections.
AB  - One hundred eighty-eight patients were enrolled in a multicenter, randomized clinical trial to compare the safety and effectiveness of 1 to 2 gm cefotetan every 12 hours with those of 1 to 2 gm cefoxitin every 6 hours in patients with intra-abdominal infections. Most of the infections were community acquired, were associated with gastrointestinal tract perforation, and were caused by both anaerobic and aerobic bacteria. The median duration of therapy was 6 days for each group. The clinical response rate for the 95 evaluable patients in the cefotetan group was 98%, and that for the 43 evaluable patients in the cefoxitin group was 95%. Bacteriologically, 97% of the 58 evaluable patients in the cefotetan group and 89% of the 27 evaluable patients in the cefoxitin group had a satisfactory or presumed satisfactory response; two patients in the cefotetan group and three in the cefoxitin group were considered bacteriologic failures. Cefotetan was as effective as cefoxitin in eradicating Bacteroides fragilis and other species of Bacteroides, Clostridium sp., and gram-negative bacilli. The incidence of treatment-related adverse reactions for cefotetan (27%) was not statistically different from that for cefoxitin (17%). No clinically significant differences were detected between the treatment groups in changes in the results of clinical laboratory tests performed before and after treatment; a decrease in hematocrit among the cefotetan group was statistically greater (p = 0.04) than that for the cefoxitin group, and a decrease in serum creatinine level for the cefoxitin group was greater than that for the cefotetan group (p = 0.02). Cefotetan may represent an effective, safe, and cost-saving alternative to cefoxitin for the prompt treatment of community-acquired intra-abdominal infections.
TI  - In vitro activity of cefotaxime against clinically significant pathogens.
AB  - The present in vitro antibacterial activities of cefotaxime and 8 other cephalosporins (cefoperazone, cefmenoxime, cefpiramide, latamoxef, cefamandole, cefmetazole, cefotiam and cephazolin) were evaluated simultaneously in 384 strains of Gram-positive cocci, 595 strains of Enterobacteriaceae, 240 strains of non-fermenters and 143 strains of anaerobes and miscellaneous organisms. The results were expressed as minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) range, MIC50 and MIC90. Of the beta-lactams, cefotaxime and latamoxef exhibited the highest activity against a wide variety of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. MIC90 of cefotaxime, however, for species of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Xanthomonas maltophilia, enterococci, Bacteroides sp. and Clostridium difficile were more than 100 mg/L. Cefpiramide and cefoperazone were generally less active than these 2 agents. All strains were tested for beta-lactamase production by the cefinase disc method and the relationship of susceptibility to beta-lactams was evaluated in each species. The need was demonstrated for periodic susceptibility testing to be performed to better guide empirical antimicrobial therapy.
TI  - Establishment of specific pathogen-free rabbits by inoculation of hysterectomy-derived rabbits with fecal suspension and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - Establishment of a specific pathogen-free (SPF) rabbit colony was attempted by transferring a total of 127 hysterectomy-derived rabbits directly into a barrier room where SPF rats had been reared. All rabbits except four died of mucoid enteritis-like diarrhea during 2 and 6 weeks of age. A second experiment consisted of four groups of hysterectomy-derived rabbits including: (1) noninoculated controls; (2) rabbits inoculated with suspension of feces from the survivors; (3) rabbits inoculated with a bacterial inoculum (Bacteroides spp. and Eubacterium sp. isolated from conventional rabbits); and (4) rabbits inoculated with Streptococcus faecalis in addition to the inoculum used for group 3. All rabbits in group 1 died of diarrhea by 3 weeks of age. Survival rates of groups 2, 3 and 4 are 53%, 38% and 40%, respectively. On 7 days after the inoculation, Bacteroides was not recovered from fecal samples of group 1, but was recovered from many samples of the inoculated groups. Populations of Enterobacteriaceae and Clostridium in the samples in group 1 were larger than each of those in the inoculated groups. The present results suggest that the lethal diarrhea, after transferring hysterectomy-derived animals directly into a barrier room, can be controlled by inoculation with non-pathogenic anaerobes, especially Bacteroides.
TI  - Coloradocin, an antibiotic from a new Actinoplanes. I. Taxonomy, fermentation and biological properties.
AB  - Coloradocin was discovered in a screen for anti-anaerobe activity. The producing  organism was determined to be a new species of Actinoplanes, designated Actinoplanes coloradoensis sp. nov. Coloradocin inhibits Bacteroides, Clostridium and other anaerobes. It does not inhibit most aerobic bacteria but is effective against Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Haemophilus influenzae. Coloradocin has low acute toxicity.
TI  - [Effect of norfloxacin on bacterial flora in human feces].
AB  - Norfloxacin (NFLX), a synthetic oral antibacterial agent of quinolone carboxylic  acid, was given orally for 5 full days at a dose of 200 mg, three times daily after each meal to healthy normal men with ages between 22 and 25 years weighing 53.0 to 84.0 kg (average 67.0 kg). The actual regimen followed was that the drug was administered twice after lunch and supper on the first day of dosing, and once after breakfast on the last day of dosing. On the 5th day before the start of dosing, on the first, 3rd and 5th days (last dosing day) of dosing, and on the 3rd, 5th, 10th and 20th days after the end of dosing, effects of the drug on the fecal flora were examined and its fecal levels were determined. Susceptibilities against NFLX and nalidixic acid (NA) of various fecal isolates from 7 men were determined. Adverse effects and influences on clinical laboratory tests were also examined. The results obtained are summarized below. 1. Following the drug administration, a transient decrease or disappearance of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp., Citrobacter sp. and Enterobacter sp. of Enterobacteriaceae was noted. The 3 strains other than E. coli were isolated from increasing number of cases after the end of dosing. No constant trend was observed in the isolation of Proteus sp. Organisms belong to Enterobacteriaceae were isolated only in 4 and 2 cases after 3 and 5 days of the start of dosing, respectively, but then gradually increased to the predose level. Among other Gram-negative bacteria, no constant trend was noted in the isolation frequency of Plesiomonas sp. Pseudomonas sp. was isolated from 6 and 5 cases on the 3rd day after dosing and on the 3rd day after the end of dosing, respectively; the frequency of isolation increased after dosing. Gram-positive bacteria such as Staphylococcus sp. were isolated with a reduced frequency on the 3rd day of dosing. However, the number of isolates increased in all cases both on the 5th day of dosing and on the 3rd day after the end of dosing, and then decreased. No change was noticed in the number of isolates of Enterococcus sp., and no constant trend was observed for Micrococcus sp. and YLO. The average count of the whole aerobic bacteria did not change. Some strains decreased significantly after the start of dosing. 2. Among anaerobes, Bacteroides fragilis and other Bacteroides were isolated on every test day.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Antimicrobial substance from a human Lactobacillus strain.
AB  - Lactobacillus sp. strain GG, which was isolated from the feces of a normal person, produced a substance with potent inhibitory activity against a wide range of bacterial species. It inhibited anaerobic bacteria (Clostridium spp., Bacteroides spp., Bifidobacterium spp.), members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas spp. Staphylococcus spp., and Streptococcus spp., as demonstrated by a microbiological assay; however, it did not inhibit other lactobacilli. The inhibitory activity occurred between pH 3 and 5 and was heat stable. Bactericidal activity against Escherichia coli was demonstrated at a dilution of 1:128. The inhibitory substance was distinct from lactic and acetic acids. It had a low molecular weight (less than 1,000) and was soluble in acetone-water (10:1). Because of these characteristics, the inhibitory material could not be considered a bacteriocin; it most closely resembled a microcin, which has been associated previously with members of the family Enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - Synergistic combinations of antimicrobial agents against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - Studies evaluating the in vitro and in vivo synergistic potential of combined antimicrobial agents against anaerobic bacteria are reviewed. Most studies evaluated therapy against Bacteroides sp. (mostly Bacteroides fragilis group). The combinations found to be most effective against B. fragilis were between metronidazole and clindamycin, spiramycin or gentamicin and between clindamycin and aminoglycosides. Against Bacteroides melaninogenicus the effective combinations were penicillin or clindamycin plus gentamicin and metronidazole and spiramycin or gentamicin. Occasional synergy was observed against Clostridium sp. and anaerobic cocci with clindamycin and gentamicin. Synergistic combinations have the potential of clinical use in serious anaerobic infections.
TI  - Antagonistic effect exerted by three strictly anaerobic strains against various strains of Clostridium perfringens in gnotobiotic rodent intestines.
AB  - Our purpose was to study bacterial antagonism between a limited number of strictly anaerobic strains and Clostridium perfringens in the intestinal tract of gnotobiotic rodents. Gnotobiotic mice harboring a Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, a Fusobacterium necrogenes, and a Clostridium sp. strain were protected against pathogenic B, C, and D C. perfringens serotypes. A drastic antagonistic effect of this three-strain association was also observed against a nonpathogenic C. perfringens serotype A (CpA). It was less efficient in gnotobiotic rats than in mice and less efficient in gnotobiotic mice fed an autoclaved diet than in mice fed the same diet sterilized by irradiation. No diffusible inhibitory substances against CpA were detected in feces of gnotobiotic mice harboring the three antagonistic strains, and no nutrient depletion was demonstrated in filtrates prepared from 10-fold diluted feces of these mice. In vitro mixed cultures of the three antagonistic strains failed to inhibit growth of CpA, whereas CpA did not multiply in a 10-fold diluted feces from gnotobiotic mice. A reverse correlation between the initial number of antagonistic strains and the division number of CpA was determined using serially diluted fecal suspensions. Thus, large numbers of viable cells of both antagonistic strains were required to inhibit the target strain in fecal suspensions as was also found in gnotobiotic mice intestines. However, no diffusible inhibitory substance was detectable nor could depletion of growth factors be identified as causing antagonism. Whatever factors that may be responsible for antagonism were found to be influenced by the host and its diet.
TI  - Bifidobacterium, Bacteroides, and Clostridium spp. in fecal samples from breast-fed and bottle-fed infants with and without iron supplement.
AB  - Bifidobacterium, Bacteroides, and Clostridium spp. isolated from the feces of 23  neonates during the first 3 months of life were identified. Of the 23 neonates, 10 were breast fed, 6 received an infant formula with iron supplement (5 mg/liter), and 7 received the formula without iron supplement (iron concentration, less than 0.5 mg/liter). The Bifidobacterium spp. most frequently isolated from the three groups of infants were B. longum, B. breve, B. adolescentis, and B. bifidum. The bacteroides spp. most frequently isolated were B. fragilis and B. vulgatus. The most common Clostridium sp. in the three groups of infants was C. perfringens. The type of milk did not select for species of Bifidobacterium, Bacteroides, or Clostridium, except for Clostridium butyricum, which was isolated significantly more often from bottle-fed infants with iron supplement than from the other groups, and Clostridium tertium, which was more often isolated from breast-fed infants. The species of the three anaerobic genera did not persist for a long period of time in the three groups of infants.
TI  - Role of encapsulated anaerobic bacteria in synergistic infections.
AB  - The effect of encapsulation on the virulence, survival, and protection of anaerobic bacteria from phagocytosis is reviewed. Support for the importance of encapsulated Bacteroides sp. and anaerobic and facultative Gram-positive cocci (AFGPC) was provided by their higher recovery rate in oropharyngeal infections, compared to their number in the normal oral flora. Studies of the pathogenicity of anaerobic bacteria of the Bacteroides, Fusobacterium, and Clostridium genera and AFGPC are also presented. The organisms were inoculated into mice and their ability to induce subcutaneous abscesses was determined. Encapsulated Bacteroides, Fusobacteria, and AFGPC generally induced abscesses, whereas unencapsulated organisms did not. However, many of the strains that had only a minimal number of encapsulated organisms (less than 1%) survived in the abscess, and became heavily encapsulated when inoculated with other viable or nonviable encapsulated bacteria. These strains were thereafter able to induce abscesses when injected alone. Encapsulated Bacteroides sp. and anaerobic cocci induced bacteremia and translocation, and increased the mortality of the infected animals more often than did the unencapsulated form of the same strains. The relative importance of encapsulated anaerobes in relation to their aerobic and facultative counterparts in mixed infection was studied, using selective antimicrobial therapy and quantitative cultures of abscesses induced in mice. With few exceptions, possession of a capsule made Bacteroides sp. more important than their aerobic counterparts. Synergistic potentials were seen between encapsulated Bacteroides sp. and all tested aerobic bacteria and most AFGPC, and between most AFGPC and Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Staphylococcus aureus. These studies demonstrated the importance of encapsulated anaerobes in mixed infections.
TI  - In vitro activity of two new aryl-fluoroquinolone antimicrobial agents, difloxacin (A-56619) and A-56620 compared to that of other antimicrobial agents.
AB  - The in vitro activity of difloxacin (A-56619) and A-56620, two new aryl-difluoroquinolones, was compared to that of other new quinolones and several parenteral and oral antimicrobial agents. A-56620 inhibited 90% of Enterobacteriaceae at less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, Staphylococcus aureus 0.25 micrograms/ml, hemolytic streptococci 2 micrograms/ml, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 2 micrograms/ml, Bacteroides sp. and Clostridium at 8 micrograms/ml. A-56620 was equal or 2-fold more active than norfloxacin and ofloxacin, and 2-8-fold less active than ciprofloxacin. Difloxacin had similar in vitro activity with many isolates but usually was 2-8-fold less active than A-56620. Both agents inhibited beta-lactamase positive Haemophilus influenzae (MIC 0.015 micrograms/ml) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (MK less than or equal to 0.008 micrograms/ml). Both agents were more active against streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae than norfloxacin, ofloxacin and enoxacin, but not more active than ciprofloxacin. They inhibited Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii and Serratia marcescens resistant to cephalosporins and methicillin-resistant S. aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Spontaneously resistant mutants were seen with Enterobacteriaceae, P. aeruginosa and S. aureus at a frequency similar to that found for other new quinolones. These agents show overall in vitro activity comparable to other quinolones in clinical trial or recently approved for clinical use.
TI  - Etiological agent and primary source of infection in 42 cases of focal intracranial suppuration.
AB  - The microbiological findings for 42 patients with focal intracranial suppuration  were analyzed and correlated with the different sources of primary infection. Streptococcus spp. were identified in focal intracranial suppuration of all origins except postcraniotomy. Microaerophilic streptococci were important in cases secondary to respiratory tract infection and in those of unknown origin. Streptococcus faecalis, Proteus spp., and Bacteroides fragilis were the organisms most commonly found in polymicrobial otogenic abscesses. Clostridium sp. was the main microorganism implicated in postcraniotomy suppurations.
TI  - Anaerobic osteomyelitis in children.
AB  - Twenty-six pediatric patients with osteomyelitis caused by anaerobic bacteria are presented. The etiologic factors were chronic mastoiditis (7 patients), decubitus ulcers (5), chronic sinusitis (4), periodontal abscesses (3), bites (3), paronychia (2), trauma (1) and scalp infection after fetal monitoring (1). Seventy-four organisms (2.8 isolates/specimen), including 63 anaerobes (2.4/specimen), and 11 facultative and aerobic bacteria (0.4/specimen) were recovered. The predominant organisms were anaerobic cocci (29 isolates), Bacteroides sp. (21), Fusobacterium sp. (8), Streptococcus sp. (5) and Clostridium sp. (4). The organisms generally reflected the microbial flora of the mucous surface adjacent to the infected site. Ten beta-lactamase-producing organisms were recovered from 7 (27%) patients. These included all isolates of the Bacteroides fragilis (4) and of Staphylococcus aureus (3), 2 of the 12 Bacteroides melaninogenicus group and 1 of 3 Bacteroides oralis. The clinical, diagnostic and therapeutic aspects of anaerobic osteomyelitis in children are discussed.
TI  - [Multicenter study of ofloxacin activity on bacteria isolated from a hospital environment].
AB  - Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of ofloxacin were evaluated by agar dilution for 1508 bacterial strains isolated in five hospitals. For Enterobacteriaceae sensitive to nalidixic acid, MICs ranged from 0.008 to 1 microgram/ml (mode MIC: 0.12); the different species of Enterobacteriaceae exhibited similar mode MICs (0.12) with the exception of E. coli (0.06-0.12), P. mirabilis (0.5) and Providencia (0.25). Among strains intermediate and resistant to nalidixic acid, most of which were Serratia, Providencia and Citrobacter, 41% had a MIC within the susceptibility range, while the others had a MIC of 2 to 8 micrograms/ml, or even 64 micrograms/ml in a few instances. Ofloxacin also exhibited satisfactory activity against P. aeruginosa, with MICs ranging from 0.25 to 16 micrograms/ml (mode MIC: 2) for 87% of strains, and A. calcoaceticus, with MICs from 0.25 to 2 micrograms/ml (mode MIC: 1). Haemophilus sp. (MIC: 0.008 to 0.06 microgram/ml; mode MIC: 0.03), Gonococci (mode MIC: 0.008), and Meningococci (mode MIC: 0.016) were very sensitive to ofloxacin. The spectrum of ofloxacin included Gram positive cocci: MICs of Staphylococci were 0.06 to 2 micrograms/ml (mode MIC: 0.5); Enterococci, other Streptococci and Pneumococci were less sensitive, with MICs of 2 to 4 micrograms/ml for the majority of strains. As for anaerobic bacteria, ofloxacin proved more active against Clostridium (0.5 to 2 micrograms/ml) than Bacteroides (0.5 to 16 micrograms/ml).
TI  - [Multicenter study of the activity of pefloxacin on bacteria isolated in a hospital milieu].
AB  - Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of pefloxacin were evaluated by agar dilution for 3422 bacterial strains isolated in nine hospitals. Enterobacteriaceae proved very sensitive to pefloxacin: 62 p. 100 of 1743 strains tested had MIC less than or equal to 0.12 and 90 p. 100 less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml; but the percent of strains with MIC greater than or equal to 2 varied among the different groups of Enterobacteriaceae: 2.7 p. 100 for E. coli to 39 p. 100 for Serratia. 55 p. 100 for Pseudomonas and 81 p. 100 of Acinetobacter were inhibited by 1 micrograms/ml or less (mode MIC 1 and 0.5 micrograms/ml). Haemophilus sp.: 0.03 and 0.06 micrograms/ml and Gonococci were very sensitive to pefloxacin. The spectrum of pefloxacin extended to Gram positive cocci: MIC of Staphylococci were 0.06 to 8 micrograms/ml (mode MIC: 0.5); Enterococci, other Streptococci and Pneumococci were less sensitive: 2 and 4 micrograms/ml for the majority of strains. Concerning anaerobic bacteria, pefloxacin was more active against Clostridium (0.5 to 1 microgram/ml generally), than against Bacteroides (4 to 16 micrograms/ml).
TI  - The influence of the host on expression of intestinal microbial enzyme activities involved in metabolism of foreign compounds.
AB  - The activities of four enzymes (beta-glucuronidase, nitrate reductase and nitroreductase) in selected intestinal bacteria (Escherichia coli, Clostridium sp., Streptococcus sp., Bacteroides sp. and Lactobacillus salivarius) were measured after growth in vitro and in vivo. The five strains differed in their activities with Clostridium sp. being the most active for beta-glucosidase, beta-glucuronidase and nitroreductase, and E. coli the most active producer of nitrate reductase. Enzyme activity in vivo tended to be higher than in vitro but there were instances where the comparative activities were reversed.
TI  - [Multicenter study of the in vitro effect of imipenem (N-formimidoyl-thienamycin) on hospital bacteria].
AB  - Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of imipenem were evaluated by agar dilution for 2 895 bacterial strains isolated in 9 hospitals. Imipenem proved highly active against Enterobacteriaceae, with an MIC less than or equal to 0.25 for 63% of the 1 556 tested strains, less than or equal to 1 for 89.6% and less than or equal to 4 for 99%. The different groups of Enterobacteriaceae exhibited similar mode MICs (0.12 to 0.25), with the exception of Serratia (0.25-0.5), P. mirabilis (0.5), indole-positive Proteus (2), and Providencia (1). MICs of most cefotaxime-resistant strains were within the susceptibility range. Imipenem also exhibited satisfactory activity against P. aeruginosa (mode MIC 1-2) and Acinetobacter sp. (mode MIC: 0.25-0.5). MICs ranged from 0.03 to 4 (mode MIC: 0.5) for Haemophilus sp. and 0.25 to 1 for Gonococci, regardless of beta-lactamase-production status. MICs for Meningococci were less than or equal to 0,06. Methicillin-susceptible Staphylococci had low MICs, ranging from 0.008 to 0.5 (mode MIC : 0.016); MICs for methicillin-resistant strains varied widely, from 0.016 to 64, and were higher after incubation at 30 degrees C. Streptococci, except for Enterococci, and Pneumococci were highly susceptible (usually 0.008-0.03); MICs for Enterococci varied from 0,12 to 32 (mode MIC: 1-2). Except for four C. difficile strains, all tested anaerobic strains were inhibited by concentrations less than or equal to 1 (mode MICs: 0.06 for C. perfringens and 0.03 for B. fragilis).
TI  - [In vitro activity of ceftriaxone on hospital bacteria. Results of a multicenter  study].
AB  - Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of ceftriaxone were determined by agar dilution for 2 099 strains isolated in six teaching hospitals. MICs were less than 1 microgram/ml for the great majority of Enterobacteriaceae, with mode MICs varying across groups from less than 0.008 micrograms/ml for Proteus (mirabilis and indole-positive) to 0.25 for Enterobacter. Only a few resistant strains were found, mainly among Enterobacter and Citrobacter. Ceftriaxone proved noticeably less active against P. aeruginosa and Acinetobacter (mode MICs: 16 micrograms/ml). Haemophilus sp. and Gonococci, regardless of beta-lactamase production status, as well as Neisseria meningitidis, were highly susceptible (MIC less than 0.008-0.032). Ceftriaxone was moderately active against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (MIC: 2 to 8 micrograms/ml) and failed to inhibit methicillin resistant strains. Enterococci were slightly susceptible or resistant, whereas the other Streptococci and Pneumococci had low MICs (0.03-0.25). A fairly wide range of MICs was found for anaerobes (Clostridium: 0.06-2, Bacteroides: 0.5-32). Our data show that its particularly strong activity against Proteus, Haemophilus and Neisseria sets ceftriaxone apart from the other third-generation cephalosporins.
TI  - In vitro effects of sulphasalazine, azodisal sodium, and their metabolites on Clostridium difficile and some other faecal bacteria.
AB  - The effects of sulphasalazine (SASP), azodisal sodium (ADS), and their metabolites were tested in vitro on aerobic and anaerobic faecal bacterial strains. Sulphapyridine (SP) had a mild to moderate effect on Escherichia coli and Streptococcus faecalis. SASP also had a growth-inhibitory effect on Strep. faecalis. The other substances had no effect on the aerobic strains. SASP, SP, 5-aminosalicylic acid, and, to a certain extent, N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid exerted a growth-inhibitory effect on the anaerobic strains. Of special interest was the inhibitory effect on Clostridium difficile strains. In recent years the possibility that overgrowth of Cl. difficile could cause flare-ups of inflammatory bowel disease has been discussed. Some studies suggested that SASP treatment could predispose to Cl. difficile superinfection, whereas others found SASP more probable to exert a prophylactic effect. Our findings support the theory that SASP treatment reduces rather than promotes the risk of Cl. difficile superinfection.
TI  - [Tinidazole in the therapy of anaerobic pulmonary infections].
AB  - The purpose of the study in 10 patients with anaerobic lung infections was to demonstrate the efficacy of therapy with Tinidazole. In 9 patients, the clinical evaluation as well as X-ray and bacteriological evidence showed positive results of therapy, while in one patient a mixed anaerobic infection with Streptococcus an., Bacteroides frag., and Clostridium sp. was still present after the end of therapy. Side effects were not observed with Tinidazole therapy.
TI  - [In vitro activity of the amoxicillin-clavulanic acid combination on anaerobic bacteria. Comparison with amoxicillin, lamoxactam and metronidazole].
AB  - Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of the combination amoxicillin + clavulanic acid (AAC) (2/1 w/w) on 84 strains of obligate anaerobes were measured by the agar diffusion method and compared to those of amoxicillin (AMO), lamoxactam (LAM) and metronidazole (MET). For the 47 Bacteroides fragilis strains tested, the mode MIC was 0.5 microgram/ml with AAC, 1-2 with MET, 0.5-1 with LAM and 8-16 with AMO. A similar range of activity was found on the 16 other strains of Bacteroides sp.. AAC and AMO have a comparable activity on Clostridium perfringens (mode MIC 0.016-0.032 microgram/ml), superior to that of LAM (mode MIC 0.125) and MET (mode MIC 0.5). AAC and AMO have an almost identical activity on Peptococci and Peptostreptococci, the MIC for both drugs being less than 0.125 microgram/ml. A similar activity was found for LAM and MET.
TI  - [In vitro activity of ceftizoxime on hospital bacteria. Results of a multicenter  study].
AB  - The susceptibility to ceftizoxime of all bacterial strains isolated from seven university-affiliated hospitals over one month was tested with disk-diffusion technique. Additionally, the MIC of 1937 strains selected at random was evaluated by the agar dilution method. The majority of Enterobacteriaceae are inhibited at a concentration of less than 1 microgram/ml with a mode MIC varying from 0.008 to 0.12 among the various groups. A few Enterobacter and Citrobacter strains are resistant. Little activity was demonstrated by ceftizoxime on Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter sp. (mode MIC 32 and 8 micrograms/ml respectively). Haemophilus sp. (MIC 0.01-0.03) and Neisseria (MIC less than 0,008-0,016) are very susceptible to the drug. The MIC of methicillin-sensitive strains of Staphylococcus aureus varies from 1 to 4 micrograms/ml ; Enterococci are less susceptible, whereas other Streptococci and Pneumococci have low MICs (less than 0.008-0.025). The susceptibility of anaerobic pathogens varies widely between species, and within species ; MIC ranges from 0.008 to 32 micrograms/ml for Clostridium sp. and 0.25 to 128 micrograms/ml for Bacteroides sp.
TI  - Development of the normal gastrointestinal microflora of specific pathogen-free chickens.
AB  - The development of the normal intestinal microflora of the small intestine, caecum and large intestine of specific pathogen-free (SPF) chickens, was studied in the period from hatching to 84 days of age. No bacteria were detected in any of the sites at hatchery (day 1), but by day 3 significant levels of faecal streptococci and coliforms were isolated from all sites. The flora of the small intestine was limited to faecal streptococci and coliforms for the first 40 days and then lactobacilli became established and dominated the flora. A large variety of facultative and strictly anaerobic organisms colonized the caecum. Many of these species were transient and were only present for a limited period; after 40 days the flora stabilized to consist predominantly of faecal streptococci, Escherichia coli, Bacteroides spp. and Lactobacillus sp. The flora of the large intestine was composed of organisms also present in the small intestine or the caecum. These findings differ from previously published studies on conventionally reared chickens in that the number of species isolated and the population levels of organisms are much lower. This probably reflects the absence of continuous environmental challenge to the chickens because of the housing and feeding facilities in which the chickens were maintained.
TI  - Motility as a factor in bowel colonization by Roseburia cecicola, an obligately anaerobic bacterium from the mouse caecum.
AB  - Roseburia cecicola strain GM is a motile obligate anaerobe that was isolated from mouse caecal mucosa. Twenty-five strains of motility mutants were obtained from populations of strain GM (wild-type) that had been exposed to UV light. Unlike GM cells, mutant bacteria were either non-motile and non-flagellated (Fla-) or migrated slowly or atypically in semi-solid medium. Strain GM and two mutant strains, SLS (Fla-) and WES (atypically motile), were used in mouse colonization experiments. In separate experiments, each strain colonized (4.8 X 10(9) to 1.5 X 10(10) c.f.u. per g caecum) the caecum of germfree mice inoculated intragastrically with pure cultures of the bacteria. In mice mono-associated with either mutant strain, bacteria which were non-motile or atypically motile predominated in their caeca (greater than 99% of total bacteria recovered). In mice mono-associated with motile cells of strain GM, mutant strains which had lost wild-type motility became predominant in the caecal populations (97% of total bacteria recovered at 48 to 70 days after inoculation). Mice mono-associated with either strain SLS or strain GM were colonized by one strain each of Escherichia coli, Candida pintolopesii, a Bacteroides sp., and a Clostridium sp. Most (99%) of the R. cecicola cells recovered from the caeca of these animals had typical wild-type motility. Motility, although not essential for R. cecicola to colonize germfree mice, is apparently advantageous to this bacterium when other micro-organisms are present with it in the mouse caecum. Motility may thus be essential for R. cecicola to colonize conventional laboratory mice.
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of cefoxitin in surgery].
AB  - Cefoxitin (CFX) was administered to 13 patients who were admitted to the surgical ward of the hospital. The results of the study as follows; Disc susceptibility tests of the 11 strains isolated from the patients to antibiotic were performed and 10 strains showed good susceptibility to CFX. The clinical response was good in all 4 patients with surgical infections. It is noted that 1 patient with mixed infection caused by E. coli, Clostridium sp. and Bacteroides sp. showed good response to CFX. Out of 9 patients treated with CFX for prophylaxis of postoperative infections, 8 patients responded effectively to CFX, and clinical efficacy rate was 88.9%. No side effects were noted due to CFX. It is considered from these results of the study that CFX is a highly effective and safe drug for treatment of infections and for the prevention of postoperative infections in surgery.
TI  - [Bacteriology of the bile in cholecystopathies. Radiological association].
AB  - A clinicobacteriological survey was undertaken in 55 patients undergoing biliary  surgery, because of chronic and acute cholecystitis. Some radiological preoperative and operative aspects were analised in order to detect any relation of these aspects with biliary tract infection. The bile cultures were positive in 34,5% and 20,0% for aerobes an anaerobes microorganisms respectively. The microorganisms most frequently isolated were Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella, Bacteroides sp and Clostridium sp, as aerobian and anaerobian. The statistical analysis showed significance between the presence of bacteria in the biliary tract and pathological operative cholangiography. It had not significance with the radiological preoperative aspects.
TI  - In vitro activity of U-57930E against anaerobic bacteria and its comparison with  clindamycin, ampicillin, carbenicillin and tetracycline.
AB  - The in vitro activity of U-57930E, a pipecolic acid amide of clindamycin, was compared with those of clindamycin, ampicillin, carbenicillin and tetracycline against 321 anaerobic clinical isolates. The MIC (micrograms/ml) of U-57930E that inhibited 95% Bacteroides fragilis, Peptococcus prevotii, B. melaninogenicus and P. asaccharolyticus was 0.0625; 0.03125 for Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, B. vulgatus, Propionibacterium and Peptococcus species. Clindamycin, on the other hand, gave MIC values of 0.5 microgram/ml for B. fragilis, P. prevotii and P. asaccharolyticus, 0.25 for Propionibacterium sp. All strains of Clostridium perfringens were inhibited by 0.5 microgram/ml of U-57930E. Both clindamycin and U-57930E showed similar MIC values for all strains of Fusobacterium nucleatum and Propionibacterium acnes tested. The MIC values for ampicillin, carbenicillin and tetracycline were within the expected range. U-57930E had a 4 approximately 8 fold lower MIC than clindamycin and is significantly active against anaerobic bacteria.
TI  - [Antibacterial effects of niridazole. II. Effects on aerobic and anaerobic bacteria].
AB  - Niridazole which is chemically related to metronidazole is endowed with much better antibacterial activity. First, several genera of aerobic bacteria, such as Salmonella and Escherichia, are susceptible to niridazole, whereas metronidazole is completely ineffective. There exist, however, some particular strains which are naturally resistant to niridazole. The in vitro activity of niridazole is still increased, if these facultative anaerobic bacteria are tested under anaerobic growth conditions. Second, niridazole has a higher in vitro activity against anaerobic bacteria, such as Bacteroides spp., Clostridium spp., Fusobacterium spp. and Peptococcus sp., than metronidazole. Extremely low MIC values of niridazole were found ranging from 0.0037 to 0.06 microgram/ml. Propionibacterium acnes, which are resistant to the action of metronidazole, are also relatively resistant to niridazole.
TI  - Piperacillin sodium: antibacterial spectrum, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, and adverse reactions.
AB  - Piperacillin sodium is a beta lactam antibiotic with a broad range of antibacterial activity that includes gram-negative bacilli, gram-positive cocci (except penicillinase-producing S. aureus) and anaerobic pathogens such as Clostridium difficile, and Bacteroides fragilis. Piperacillin inhibits many of the members of the Enterobacteriaceae, including Klebsiella sp and Pseudomonas, at lower concentrations than required for carbenicillin and ticarcillin. Piperacillin sodium is administered by intramuscular and intravenous injection and is widely distributed throughout body fluids and tissues. Like other newer penicillins, piperacillin is excreted by both renal and biliary mechanisms. The primary route of elimination is by glomerular filtration, which results in high urinary concentrations of the unchanged compound. Piperacillin has been approved for patients with serious infection caused by susceptible strains of specific organisms in intra-abdominal, urinary tract, gynecologic, lower respiratory tract, skin and skin structure, bone and joint, and gonococcal infections and septicemia. As with other penicillins, piperacillin has a low frequency of toxicity. The usual dose of piperacillin in adults with serious infections with normal renal function is 3-4 g every 4-6 hr as a 20-30 min infusion, with a maximum dose of 24 g per day. It is stable in most large volume parenteral solutions. Less serious infectins (requiring smaller dosages) may be treated by intramuscular injection; however, no more than 2 g should be given at any one injection site. Overall, piperacillin has a greater degree of activity than other penicillins. Evidence from prospective studies indicates that piperacillin is a highly effective agent for the treatment of patients with infections caused by susceptible organisms.
TI  - Antibacterial properties of bile acid oxazoline compounds.
AB  - Chenooxazoline (50-100 microM) inhibited (greater than 50%) both 7 alpha and 7 beta-dehydroxylase activities in whole cells and cell extracts of Eubacterium sp. V.P.I. 12708. Chenooxazoline (greater than or equal to 50 microM) and methylchenooxazoline (greater than 25 microM) but not lithooxazoline (less than or equal to 100 microM) inhibited growing cultures of Eubacterium sp. V.P.I. 12708. Chenooxazoline (100 microM) also inhibited the growth of certain members of the genera Eubacterium, Clostridium, Bacteroides and Staphylococcus but not Pseudomonas, Escherichia, Salmonella or the eucaryotic microorganism, Saccharomyces cerevisiae (less than or equal to 400 microM).
TI  - Comparative in vitro activities of niridazole and metronidazole against anaerobic and microaerophilic bacteria.
AB  - In vitro susceptibilities of anaerobic bacteria (Bacteroides spp., Fusobacterium  spp., Clostridium spp., and Peptococcus sp.) and of Campylobacter jejuni and C. coli to niridazole and metronidazole were determined. The minimum inhibitory concentrations for niridazole ranged from 0.0037 to 1.0 microgram/ml and, for metronidazole, from 0.25 to 128 micrograms/ml.
TI  - Impact of cefoperazone therapy on fecal flora.
AB  - To evaluate the effects of parenteral cefoperazone therapy upon human fecal flora, fecal specimens obtained from four patients before and during therapy (as well as after therapy for one patient) were cultured quantitatively for facultative, aerobic, and anaerobic bacteria and for fungi. Cefoperazone therapy was associated with major changes in fecal flora. There was suppression to undetectable levels or an appreciable reduction in all anaerobic bacteria as well as suppression of all initially detected Enterobacteriaceae. During therapy, there was acquisition or an increase in counts of Candida spp., so that these became the most numerous fecal microorganisms in all patients. In addition, Pseudomonas spp. and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus sp. were acquired by three patients. These marked alterations in flora have potentially important consequences.
TI  - Susceptibilities of anaerobic bacteria to N-formimidoyl thienamycin (MK0787) and  to other antibiotics.
AB  - The susceptibilities of 462 clinical anaerobic bacterial isolates to N-formimidoyl thienamycin and 16 other currently available and investigational antibiotics were determined by the agar dilution technique. N-Formimidoyl thienamycin was significantly more active than the reference antibiotics against most organisms tested, especially Bacteroides sp., including clindamycin-resistant strains. All 462 isolates were inhibited by 4 micrograms of N-formimidoyl thienamycin per ml, and no resistant strains were found in the species tested. N-Formimidoyl thienamycin was less active (i.e., had a higher 50% minimal inhibitory concentration) against Fusobacterium sp. than clindamycin, SM-1652, and piperacillin, and less active against Clostridium difficile than metronidazole, but was equally active or more active than the other reference antibiotics tested.
TI  - Methane and hydrogen production by human intestinal anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The gas above liquid cultures of a variety of human intestinal anaerobic bacteria was sampled and analysed by headspace gas chromatography. Hydrogen production was greatest with strains of the genus Clostridium, intermediate with anaerobic cocci and least with Bacteroides sp. Very few strains produced methane although small amounts were detected with one strain of B. thetaiotaomicron, C. perfringens and C. histolyticum. There may be a relationship between these anaerobic bacteria and several gastrointestinal disorders in which there is a build up of hydrogen or methane in the intestines.
TI  - Bacteriology of acute obstructive suppurative cholangitis of the aged.
AB  - Bacteriological examination was performed on bile from 23 patients with acute obstructive suppurative cholangitis. Of 23 bile cultures, 15 yielded aerobic and anaerobic bacteria and 8 yielded aerobic bacteria only. No specimen grew anaerobic bacteria only. A total of 20 cultures yielded a polymicrobial flora, and 3 cultures grew one single aerobic bacterium. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp., enterococci, Bacteroids fragilis, and Clostridium perfringens were the predominant bacterial flora in bile of these patients. Bacteremia was documented in 10 of the 12 patients cultured. All bacteremias involved aerobic bacteria and were polymicrobial in three patients. The frequent presence of anaerobes in bile of patients with acute obstructive suppurative cholangitis suggests that antimicrobial therapy should provide adequate coverage for anaerobic bacteria and enteric organisms.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic bacteriology of peritonsillar abscess in children.
AB  - Aspiration of peritonsillar abscess (quinsy) was aseptically performed in 16 children. Patients' median age was 10 years (range 6 to 17 years), and 12 were males. Unilateral abscess was present in all but one child. All aspirates were cultured for aerobes and anaerobes and yielded bacterial growth in all patients. Anaerobes were isolated in all patients; in 3 patients (19%), they were the only organism isolated, and in 13 (81%), they were mixed with aerobes. There were 91 anaerobic isolates (5.7 per specimen): 42 Bacteroides sp. (including 23 B. melaninogenicus, 5 B. oralis and 4 B. ruminicola ss. brevis); 18 anaerobic Gram-positive cocci (including 10 Peptostreptococcus sp., 4 Peptococcus sp. and 4 microaerophilic streptococci); 15 Fusobacterium sp.; and 3 Clostridium sp. There were 32 aerobic isolates (2.0 per specimen): 11 gamma-hemolytic streptococci, 8 alpha-hemolytic streptococci, 4 Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci, 4 Haemophilus sp. and 3 S. aureus. Beta-lactamase production was noted in 13 isolates recovered from 11 patients (68%). These were all isolates of S. aureus (3), 8 of 23 B. melaninogenicus (35%), and 2 of 5 B. oralis (40%). Our findings indicate the major role of anaerobic organisms in the polymicrobial etiology of peritonsillar abscesses in children, and demonstrate the presence of many beta-lactamase-producing organisms in two thirds of the patients.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic bacteriology of cholesteatoma.
AB  - Cholesteatoma specimens were obtained from 28 patients undergoing surgery for chronic otitis media and cholesteatoma. All specimens were cultured for aerobic and anaerobic organisms. Bacterial growth was present in specimens of 24 of the 28 patients. A total of 74 bacterial isolates were present (40 aerobes and 34 anaerobes). Aerobes alone were isolated from 8 (33%) of culture positive patients, 4 patients (26.7%) yielded only anaerobes, and 12 (50%) had both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Fifty isolates (27 aerobes and 23 aerobes) were present in a concentration greater than 10(6) CFU/gm. The most commonly isolated aerobic organisms were P. aeruginosa (9), Proteus sp. (7), K. pneumoniae (5), S. aureus (5), and E. coli (4). The anaerobic bacteria most commonly isolated were gram-positive anaerobic cocci (12), Bacteroides sp. (12, including 5 B. fragilis group), Clostridium sp. (3), and Bifidobacterium sp. (3). The above findings indicate the polymicrobial aerobic and anaerobic bacteriology of cholesteatoma.
TI  - Rapid temperature programmed gas-liquid chromatography of volatile fatty acids (C1-C7) for the identification of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - A gas liquid chromatography method for the separation of 10 volatile fatty acids  (C1-C7 and isomers) has been improved by using oven temperature programmed conditions. In our conditions, the proprietary stationary phase SP 1220 introduced by Supelco Inc., gave sharp separation of volatile fatty acids in less than 8 min. This method was suitable for analyses with both thermal conductivity and flame ionization detectors.
TI  - Anaerobic bacteremia in children.
AB  - Twenty-nine anaerobic isolates were recovered from 28 pediatric patients with anaerobic bacteremia: 14 Bacteroides sp (11 in the B fragilis group); four anaerobic Gram-positive cocci; four Clostridium sp; four Propionibacterium acnes; and three Fusobacterium sp. No aerobic bacteria were isolated from these patients. The gastrointestinal tract was the possible portal of entry in 13 instances, eight of which were due to Bacteroides organisms, four to Clostridium sp, and one to F nucleatum. The ear, sinus, and oropharynx were probable portals of entry in seven instances, four of which were due to Peptococcus sp and two to Fusobacterium sp. Five patients (18%) died; four had bacteremia caused by B fragilis group, and one had bacteremia caused by P acnes. The average duration of antimicrobial therapy was 20 days (range, seven to 72 days). The early recognition and rapid institution of appropriate antimicrobial and surgical therapy are of utmost importance in improving the outcome of these patients.
TI  - Bacterial studies of peritoneal cavity and postoperative surgical wound drainage  following perforated appendix in children.
AB  - This study reports bacterial specimens obtained from 112 children presenting with a ruptured appendix. Additional samples were studied from 11 of these patients who developed a postoperative surgical draining wound. Bacterial growth occurred in 100 peritoneal fluid specimens. Anaerobic bacteria alone were present in 14 specimens, aerobes alone in 12, and mixed aerobic an anerobic flora in 74 specimens. There were 144 aerobic isolates (1.4 per specimen). The predominant isolates were: E. coli (57 specimens); alpha-hemolytic steptococcus (16 specimens); gamma-hemolytic streptococcus (15 specimens); Group D streptococcus (12 specimens); and P. aeruginosa (9 specimens). There were 301 anaerobic isolates (three per specimen). The predominant isolates were: 157 Bacteroides spp. (including 92 B. fragilis group and 26 B. melaninogenicus group); 62 gram-positive anaerobic cocci (including 30 Peptococcus sp.; 29 Peptostreptococcus sp.); 27 Fusobactenium sp.; and 16 Clostridium sp. B. fragilis and Peptococcus sp. occurred in 23 patients. Beta lactamase production was detectable in 98 isolates recovered from 74 patients. These included all isolates of B. fragilis and six of the 23 Bacteroides sp. Forty-nine organisms (16 aerobic and 33 anaerobic) were recovered from the draining wounds. The predominant organisms were: B. fragilis (8 specimens); E. coli (6 specimens); Peptostreptococcus sp. (5 specimens); and three specimens each of P. aeruginosa and Peptococcus sp. Most of these isolates were also recovered from the peritoneal cavity of the patients. These findings demonstrate the polymicrobial aerobic and anaerobic nature of peritoneal cavity and postoperative wound flora in children with perforated appendix, and demonstrate the presence of beta lactamase-producing organisms in three-fourths of the patients.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic bacteriology of perirectal abscess in children.
AB  - Aspirates of pus from perirectal abscesses in 28 children were studied for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. A total of 87 isolates (64 anaerobic and 23 aerobic) were recovered from the patients, an average of 2.3 anaerobes and 0.8 aerobes per specimen. Anaerobic organisms alone were recovered from 15 specimens (54%), and in nine specimens (32%) they were mixed with aerobic organisms. Aerobic organisms were recovered in pure culture in only four patients (14%). The predominant anaerobic organisms were Bacteroides sp (32 isolates, including 14 B fragilis group and seven B melaninogenicus group), Gram-positive anaerobic cocci (15), Fusobacterium sp (six), and Clostridium sp (three). The predominant aerobic organisms were Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus (six of each), group A beta-hemolytic streptococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus morganii (two of each). Five children had a serious underlying chronic disease; three of these had an accompanying bacteremia and two died. Incision and drainage were performed on all patients: some children also received parenteral, or oral antibiotic treatment, or both.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic bacteriology of pilonidal cyst abscess in children.
AB  - Aspirates of pus from pilonidal abscesses in 25 children were studied for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. A total of 76 isolates (63 anaerobic and 13 aerobic) were recovered from the patients, accounting for 2.52 anaerobes and 0.52 aerobes per specimen. Anaerobic organisms were recovered from all the specimens, and in eight cases (32%) they were mixed with aerobic organisms. The predominant anaerobic organisms were Bacteroides sp (36 isolates, including ten B fragilis group and ten B melaninogenicus group), Gram-positive anaerobic cocci (16). Fusobacterium sp (five), and Clostridium sp (four). The predominant aerobic organisms were Escherichia coli (four) and group D streptococci, alpha-hemolytic streptococci, and Proteus sp (two of each). We believe this study is the first to demonstrate the mixed anaerobic and aerobic bacteriology of pilonidal cyst abscesses in children.
TI  - Chronic otitis media in children. Microbiological studies.
AB  - Aspiration of the exudate through the open perforation was performed in 68 children with chronic otitis media. The middle ear aspirate and a swab specimen of the external auditory canal were cultured aerobically and anaerobically. Seventy-eight isolates were recovered from the middle ears, 99 from the external ear canals, and 95 were present at both sites. Aerobes only were isolated from 33 patients (48.5%), nine (13.2%) had only anaerobes, and 26 (38%) had a culture that grew both aerobes and anaerobes. There were 99 aerobic isolates. Aerobes commonly recovered were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus sp, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Haemophilus influenzae. There were 74 anaerobes isolated. Anaerobes commonly isolated were anerobic Gram-positive cocci, Bacteroides sp, and Clostridium sp. These findings demonstrate the polymicrobial bacteriology of chronic otitis media in children. Cultures collected from the external auditory canals prior to their sterilization can be misleading. Reliable information can be obtained from the ear exudates when collected through the open perforation in the tympanic membrane.
TI  - Recovery of anaerobic bacteria from pediatric patients. A one-year experience.
AB  - During 1975, 115 speciments from the soft tissues, body fluids, and purulent sites in 105 pediatric ward and nursery patients were submitted to the clinical laboratory for anaerobic study, and 75% of the cultures were positive. In most instance specimens were collected in anaerobic transport tubes containing peptone yeast extract and glucose. In the laboratory, samples were processed by the anaerobic holding jar method. Nineteen different anaerobic organisms were isolated; the average number of species per specimen was 1.8 Bacteroides sp were the most common isolates (45 strains). Other isolates included 44 anaerobic cocci (15 of which were Peptostreptococcus sp), 22 Propionibacterium sp, ten Fusobacterium sp, nine Clostridium sp, eight Veillonella sp, six Bifidobacterium sp, and four Eubacterium sp. The main sources of anaerobic isolates included 52 gastric aspirates, 46 soft tissue sites, 14 blood specimens, 12 CSF samples, and 12 samples from the external ear canals. Forty-one (43%) of the 86 specimens that contained anaerobic bacteria also had aerobic organisms present.
TI  - Comparison of three methods of susceptibility testing of bacteroidaceae, peptococcaceae and other anaerobes to doxycycline.
AB  - The in vitro activity of doxycycline against 147 strains of gram-positive and gram-negative anaerobes was determined by broth dilution, agar dilution and agar diffusion tests. The strains were isolated from clinical specimens in 1977. Saccharolytic Bacteroides strains (39 B. fragilis, 6 B. thetaiotaomicron, 4 B. vulgatus) showed broth dilution MICs of less than or equal to 0.0625-4.0 microgram/ml after 5 h incubation and MICs of less than or equal to 16 microgram/ml after 15 h incubation at 37 degrees C. With strains of B. oralis, B. melaninogenicus ss. intermedius, B. corrodens, Veillonella sp. and Megasphaera elsdenii the broth dilution MICs were less than or equal to 0.0625-32 microgram/ml after 15 h incubation. Peptostreptococcus spp., Propionibacterium acnes, Eubacterium sp., Bifidobacterium sp. and Clostridium sp. had broth dilution MICs of less than or equal to 2 microgram/ml, whereas Peptococcus spp. were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.0625 to greater than 32 microgram/ml. With the great majority of strains tested, MICs were 2 to 256 times higher in agar than in broth dilution tests. Clinical and experimental studies seem to be needed to determine which of the in vitro data are correlated to the outcome of doxycycline therapy. Several groups and species were separately considered for statistical analysis of the relationship between zone size and MIC. With gram-positive anaerobes, correlation was poor between broth dilution MIC and zone size (correlation coefficients r = - 0.168 for Peptococcaceae, and r = - 0.108 for P. acnes). When calculating the regression lines for agar dilution MICs and zone diameters, a higher correlation was found (r = - 0.9 for Peptococcaceae; r = - 0.397 for P. acnes). With B. fragilis and other Bacteroides species correlation coefficients were r = - 0.807 to r = - 0.891 for broth and agar dilution MICs and zone size but stochastic linearity was lacking.
TI  - Increase in the population of duodenal immunoglobulin A plasmocytes in axenic mice associated with different living or dead bacterial strains of intestinal origin.
AB  - Various bacterial strains were tested for their ability to stimulate immunoglobulin A (IgA) plasmocytes to populate the duodenal lamina propria in axenic mice. The mice were associated with the strains for at least 4 weeks. The strains inhabiting the conventional mouse intestine and belonging to the genera Lactobacillus, Streptococcus, Eubacterium, Actinobacillus, Micrococcus, Corynebacterium, and Clostridium (including the extremely oxygen-sensitive ones) are only slightly or nonimmunogenic, whereas the strains belonging to the genera Bacteroides and Escherichia have an immunogenic effect. The same result was obtained with Bacteroides and Escherichia strains isolated from the digestive tract of other animal species. The kinetics of appearance of intestinal IgA plasmocytes are similar in axenic mice monoassociated with a stimulatory strain and in conventional mice. The association of two or more strains with axenic mice leads either to the same or a greater number of duodenal IgA plasmocytes as that obtained with the most stimulatory strain monoassociated with axenic mice. The maximum stimulation recorded in all of these trials represents about two-thirds of that observed in conventional mice and was obtained in the duodenum of gnotoxenic mice harboring four bacterial strains isolated from the conventional mouse microflora. The orally administered killed cells of two immunogenic strains, E. coli and Bacteroides sp., are as immunogenic as the living cells, provided that their concentration in the digestive tract is sufficient.
TI  - Monensin, Eimeria tenella infection, and effects on the bacterial populations in  the ceca of gnotobiotic chickens.
AB  - Bacteria-free chicks in separate plastic film isolators were inoculated orally with single species of bacteria. Within an isolator, half the birds were fed unmedicated feed and half received feed containing 100 ppm monensin. With clostridium perfringens as the established species of monoflora, bacterial counts from the duodenum were 10(4) times lower and counts from the ceca were three times lower in monensin-fed birds compared to unmedicated birds. Infection with Eimeria tenella stimulated an eight-fold increase in the numbers of C. perfringens in the ceca of unmedicated birds but no increase in monensin-fed birds. With Bacteroides sp. or Streptococcus faecalis as monoflora, there was no difference in the cecal or duodenal populations between medicated and unmedicated birds uninfected with coccidia. In contrast to C. perfringens, populations of Bacteroides sp. and S. faecalis in the ceca decreased five to 100-fold in both medicated and unmedicated chicks after infection with E. tenella. Duodenal populations of C. perfringens, Bacteroides sp., and S. faecalis were unaffected by the coccidial infection.
TI  - Urease assay and urease-producing species of anaerobes in the bovine rumen and human feces.
AB  - A growth medium and test were developed for rapid detection of urease in fermentative anaerobic bacteria. Using nonselective rumen fluid roll-tube agar medium and the new test, it was confirmed that Peptostreptococcus productus is often the most numerous urease-forming species in human feces. Also, some fecal strains of Ruminococcus albus, Clostridium innocuum, and Clostridium beijerinckii produced urease. Single strains of Fusobacterium prausnitzii, Coprococcus catus, and Streptococcus mitis that were strongly ureolytic on isolation later lost this ability. Urease activity was also detected in many strains of nonselectively isolated rumen species. They include Succinivibrio dextrinosolvens, Treponema sp., Ruminococcus bromii (not previously known to be present in the rumen), Butyrivibrio sp., Bifidobacterium sp., Bacteroides ruminicola, and P. productus. Most P. productus strains contain urease; however, the uniformity of this feature in the other species noted above is not known. The urease in many of these species was not detected if the growth medium contained 0.2% or more (each) yeast extract and Trypticase.
TI  - [Susceptibility to Thiamphenicol and Chloramphenicol of Anaerobic Bacteria (author's transl)].
AB  - The in vitro susceptibility to thiamphenicol and chloramphenicol of 272 anaerobes, most of which were recent clinical isolated, was determined by broth dilution tests, With chloramphenicol, 133 anaerobic gram-negative non-sporing rods (48 Bacteroides fragilis, 13 B. thetaiotaomicron, 14 B. oralis, 16 Sphaerophorus varius etc.) had MIC values of 0.03 through 16 microng/ml. Very similar results (MIC, 0.06-16 microng/ml) were obtained with thiamphenicol. In concentrations of 4 microng/ml or less chloramphenicol inhibited 90.2% and thiamphenicol 78.95% of the strains. Strains with only moderate sensitivity to both antibiotics (MIC, 8 or 16 microng/ml) belonged to B. fragilis or other Bacteroides species. Members of the Fusobacterium and Sphaerophorus group were susceptible to less than or equal to 2 microng chloramphenicol/ml and less than or equal to 4 microng thiamphenicol/ml respectively. With both antibiotics, 102 strains of gram-positive non-sporing anaerobes (P. acnes, Peptostreptococcus spp., Peptococcus spp.) were susceptible to less than or equal to 8 microng/ml. Of 37 Clostridium isolates, 35 (belonging to C. perfringens, C. septicum, C. cadaveris etc.) were inhibited by concentrations of 8 microng/ml or less of chloramphenicol and thiamphenicol. Only one strain each of C. perfringens and Clostridium sp. had an MIC of 16 microng thiamphenicol/ml. Accordingly, resistance to thiamphenicol or chloramphenicol was not observed. A standardized monodisk agardiffusion test was performed on 40 Bacteroidaceae, 18 Peptococcaceae and 20 C, (P.) acnes strains. Only a poor correlation was observed between MIC and zone size for thiamphenicol and chloramphenicol. Therefore, inhibition zone diameter measurement cannot be regarded as a reliable method to detect chloramphenicol or thiamphenicol resistance in anaerobes. Thiamphenicol, which is virtually as active against anaerobes as chloramphenicol but lacks serious toxicity, may well play an important role in the therapy of various anaerobic infections.
TI  - In vitro sensitivity of anaerobic bacteria to fosfomycin.
AB  - The minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined in 98 strains of anaerobic  bacteria that came from clinical samples against fosfomycin, penicillin, cephalothin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, clindamycin and lincomycin. The results obtained indicate that fosfomycin is usually inactive against Bacteroides sp. and is active up to 32 mug/ml or less against 85% of Peptococcus and 95% of Peptostreptococcus, being consequently comparatively less active than the rest of the antibiotics that were tested against Bacteroides, sp., while against Peptococcus and Peptostreptococcus it is less active than penicillin, cephalothin, clindamycin and lincomycin, and somewhat more active than chloramphenicol and tetracycline.
TI  - Susceptibility to erythromycin of anaerobes of the genera Bacteroides, Fusobacterium, Sphaerophorus, Veillonella, Clostridium, Corynebacterium, Peptococcus, Peptostreptococcus.
AB  - The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of erythromycin were determined by broth dilution tests for 313 anaerobic strains, most of which were clinical isolates. All the gram-positive anaerobes tested (84 Peptococcaceae, including 21 Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and 15 Peptococcus variabilis; 65 Corynebacterium acnes and 29 Clostridium strains, including 13 C. perfringens) were sensitive (MIC values 0.012 through 3.12 microgram erythromycin/ml); so were 111 cultures of gram-negative anaerobes (52 Bacteroides fragilis, 12 B. thetaiotaomicron, 7 B. vulgatus, 13 B. oralis, 4 B. melaninogenicus, 10 Sphaerophorus necrophorus, 2 Veillonella sp., 11 members of other species). Erythromycin at concentrations of 6.25 through 200.0 microgram/ml was active against 24 strains (1 B. fragilis, 4 Fusobacterium fusiforme, 9 Sph. freundi, 10 Sph. varius). The present results are compared to the limited number of reports existing with regard to the susceptibility of anaerobes to erythromycin.
TI  - A special report: four-year study of a boy with combined immune deficiency maintained in strict reverse isolation from birth.
AB  - A 4-year study of a boy with combined immune deficiency is presented, and the impact of this disease on various aspects of his growth and development is examined. There is no evidence of immune deficiency in either parent or in the genetic background on the maternal side. Three children of a brother of the mother's father may have had immune deficiencies but two have grown to be teenagers with no problems. Another died. At autopsy, however, lymph nodes appeared normal. The deceased older brother had severe combined immune deficiency (SCID). The autopsy findings showed Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia to be the direct cause of death and these findings contributed to the diagnosis of SCID. After a successful germ-free birth, the male infant (DV) was placed in the isolator. Laboratory tests were normal except that the x-rays showed no thymic shadow, his absolute lymphocyte count ranged from 399-440/mm and the lymphocytes showed no proliferative response to phytohemagglutinin (PHA). Specific tests showed the antibody-producing immune system and the cell-mediated immune system to be severely defective. The patient's lymphocytes elicited positive responses by lymphocytes from father, mother, and sister. Subsequent search in national and international tissue-typing laboratories has shown four HLA matches but none has been nonreactive in mixed lymphocyte culture (MLC). therefore, this patient has remained in isolation to the present; now he is 4 years old. Approximately 35 species of microorganisms, mostly transient contaminants, have been isolated, taking into account that the same organism may have been identified under different names in different laboratories. Those isolated frequently and in sufficiently high concentration to indicate colonization have been speciated as follows: anaerobes-Propionibacterium acnes, Lactobacillus catenaforme (disappeared spontaneously), Bacteroides oralis ss. elongatus, Clostridium (perenne, hastiforme, bifermentans), Bacteroides clostridiiformis ss. clostridiiformis; aerobes-Alcaligenes faecalis (eradicated by antibiotics), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterobacter agglomerans, Microcossu sp. subgroup 1, Bacillus pulvifaciens (disappeared spontaneously); yeasts-Candida (tropicalis, parapsilosis). Seven are considered to be probable components of the current autoflora: P. acnes, C. bifermentans, B. clostridiiformis ss. clostridiiformis, S. epidermidis, Micrococcus sp. subgroup 1, E. agglomerans, C. parapsilosis. No viruses or protozoa have been isolated. At age 3 years, the mean quantitation of anaerobic cells was 7.9 X 10(7) viable cells/g feces; this falls short of the mean anaerobic load from normal children. The mean aerobic concentration was 1.2 X 10(8) viable cells/g feces, not unlike normal children. Qualitatively his flora has abnormally few species and lacks those most common in normal subjects. This child has had no evidence of infection and has always been in excellent health even though some organisms which could be pathogenic under some circumstances have been isolated...
TI  - A rapid glutamic decarboxylase test for identification of bacteria.
AB  - A simple rapid glutamic decarboxylase test is described. This test was found useful in the identification of Escherichia coli, Shigella sp., Providencia alcalifaciens, Clostridium perfringens and Bacteroides fragilis.
TI  - A modified plate holding system for anaerobic cultures.
AB  - A modified plate holding system for anaerobes has been developed which: 1) effectively reduces the volume of oxygen-free gas required, 2) promotes earlier bacterial growth, and 3) monitors the anaerobic atmosphere of the holding vessel and the rate of gas flow. Cultures of Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium perfringens, C. septicum, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptococcus sp. and Propionibacterium sp. were evaluated for optimal growth. All cultures grew as well as or better when preincubated in the holding system for one to three hours then incubated in a GasPak system for the remainder of the 24 hours, as compared to incubation only in the GasPak or holding system for the entire 24-hour period.
TI  - The reduction of N-hydroxy-4-acetylaminobiphenyl by the intestinal microflora of  the rat.
AB  - The role of the intestinal flora in the conversion of N-hydroxy-4-acetyl-aminobiphenyl (N-OH-AABP) to 4-acetylaminobiphenyl has been examined. This reaction, which reverses the metabolic activation of the parent carcinogen, can be demonstrated in cultures of some bacteria indigenous to the intestinal microflora. These include cultures of Clostridium sp., Clostridium perfringens, Peptostreptococcus productus I, and Bacteroides fragilis ss. thetaiotaomicron and ss. vulgatus. In contrast, cultures of Lactobacillus plantarum and Escherichia coli show little or no capacity for this reaction. The reduction of N-OH-AABP is also carried out by homogenates of liver, kidney, and brain. On a weight basis, the cecal flora is considerably more active in reducing N-OH-AABP than are homogenates of tissues of the gastrointestinal tract. The cecal flora also has a greater activity for reducing N-OH-AABP than the stomach flora, an observation which may relate to the induction of tumors in the forestomach but not in the cecum of rats fed this compound. The products of the metabolism of N-OH-AABP have been compared in germ-free and conventional animals. Glucuronide conjugates of N-OH-AABP are found in the cecal contents and feces only of the germ-free rats, while 4-acetylaminobiphenyl is found in the feces only of conventional rats. These results suggest that the flora, by hydrolyzing glucuronides and reducing N-OH-AABP, may influence the level of metabolities of 4-acetylaminobiphenyl which are critical for carcinogenesis.
TI  - Competitive effects of intestinal microflora on Vibrio cholerae in gnotobiotic mice.
AB  - The coexistence of Vibrio cholerae and several intestinal bacteria was determined in gnotobiotic mice. The bacteria tested included a Bacteroides sp, Clostridium difficile, Clostridium perfringens type A, 2 separate isolates of Escherichia coli, 2 different Lactobacilli, 2 separate isolates of Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas maltophilia, and Streptococcus faecalis. Each species of bacteria became established and was recovered repeatedly from the stools during the studies. No single strain or species was found that would eliminate V cholerae from these mice within 2 wk. Not until a combination of E coli, P mirabilis, and S faecalis was present in the mice did V cholerae disappear from the stools in 14 da.
TI  - The relationship between nitro group reduction and the intestinal microflora.
AB  - The capacity of rats to reduce a 25-mg dose of p-nitrobenzoic acid (PNBA) was measured by quantifying the amount of this compound recovered in the urine as p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) and its conjugates. It was found that germfree rats converted approximately 1% of PNBA to PABA; in conventional rats the conversion was approximately 25%. Various bacteria isolated from the rat cecum were selectively associated with germfree rats and it was demonstrated that these bacteria colonized their gastrointestinal tracts. In assoication with Lactobacillus plantarum, the conversion of PNBA to PABA increased to 3.9%. When these rats were further associated with Clostridium sp. and Streptoccocus faecalis, the conversion increased to approximately 12%. A general correlation was found between the capacity of constituents of the microflora to reduce PNBA in vitro and when associated with the germfree rat. Cecectomy, which removes a substantial portion of the microflora of the rat, decreases the capacity of the conventional rat to reduce PNBA. Similar experiments with p-nitrobenzenesulfonamide indicate that this compound is also largely reduced by the flora. Evidence that the reduction of the nitro group in these compounds is carried out by the intestinal microflora explains previous observations in which the reduction of these compounds in rats did not correlate with the activity of liver enzymes putative for these reactions.
TI  - Studies on the cecal microflora of commercial broiler chickens.
AB  - A study was made of the cecal microflora isolated from broilers (5-week-old) reared under typical commercial husbandry conditions. Three hundred and twenty-five bacterial strains (randomly isolated from colonies representing 49 to 81% of the microscopic count) were isolated from cecal digesta of six animals on a rumen fluid roll tube medium (M98-5). Seventy-seven percent of these strains consisted of strict anaerobes: gram-negative, pleomorphic cocci (5.2%), Peptostreptococcus (1.5%), gram-positive rods (36.1% as Propionibacterium acnes and Eubacterium sp.), gram-negative rods (18.6% as Bacteroides clostridiiformis, B. hypermegas and B. fragilis) and sporeforming rods (15.7% as Clostridium sp.). Two types of facultatively anaerobic bacteria (gram-positive cocci and Escherichia coli) were also isolated and constituted 17.5% of the remaining flora. The distribution of the bacterial groups isolated from six cecal samples varied considerably. Data on the growth requirements of anaerobic strains indicated that many could be cultured in a simple medium consisting of an energy source, minerals, reducing agent, Trypticase, and yeast extract (or a vitamin mixture in place of yeast extract). The growth of some of these bacteria was also enhanced by CO(2) and rumen fluid. These preliminary data suggest that some of the more numerous anaerobes isolated from the chicken cecum may not require complex nutrients for growth and, in fact, may be nutritionally similar to rumen anaerobes.
TI  - Oxygen sensitivity of various anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - Anaerobes differ in their sensitivity to oxygen, as two patterns were recognizable in the organisms included in this study. Strict anaerobes were species incapable of agar surface growth at pO(2) levels greater than 0.5%. Species that were found to be strict anaerobes were Treponema macrodentium, Treponema denticola, Treponema oralis n. sp., Clostridium haemolyticum, Selenomonas ruminatium, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, Succinivibrio dextrinosolvens, and Lachnospira multiparus. Moderate anaerobes would include those species capable of growth in the presence of oxygen levels as high as 2 to 8%. The moderate anaerobes could be exposed to room atmosphere for 60 to 90 min without appreciable loss of viability. Species considered as moderate anaerobes were Bacteroides fragilis, B. melaninogenicus, B. oralis, Fusobacteria nucleatum, Clostridium novyi type A, and Peptostreptococcus elsdenii. The recognition of at least two general types of anaerobes would seem to have practical import in regard to the primary isolation of anaerobes from source material.
