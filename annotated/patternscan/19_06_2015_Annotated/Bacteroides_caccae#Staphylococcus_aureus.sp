TI  == [bacteria isolated from surgical infections and its susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents - special references to bacteria isolated between april 2011 and march 2012].
AB  == bacteria isolated from surgical infections during the period from april 2011 to march 2012 were investigated in a multicenter study in japan, and the following results were obtained. in this series, 785 strains including 31 strains of candida spp. were isolated from 204 (78.8%) of 259 patients with surgical infections. five hundred and twenty three strains were isolated from primary infections, and 231 strains were isolated from surgical site infection. from primary infections, anaerobic gram-negative bacteria were predominant, followed by aerobic gram-negative bacteria, while from surgical site infection aerobic gram-positive bacteria were predominant, followed by anaerobic gram-negative bacteria. among aerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of enterococcus spp. was highest, followed by streptococcus spp. and staphylococcus  spp., in this order, from primary infections, while enterococcus spp. was highest, followed by staphylococcus spp. from surgical site infection. among aerobic gram-negative bacteria, escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas  aeruginosa and enterobacter cloacae, in this order, and from surgical site infection, e. coli was most predominantly isolated, followed by p. aeruginosa, k. pneumoniae, and e. cloacae. among anaerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of eggerthella lenta was the highest from primary infections, followed by parvimonas micra, collinsella aerofaciens, lactobacillus acidophilus and finegoldia magna, and from surgical site infection, e. lenta was most predominantly isolated, followed by p micra and l. acidophilus, in this order. among anaerobic gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of bacteroidesfragilis was the highest from primary infections, followed by bilophila wadsworthia, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides uniformis and bacteroides vulgatus, and from surgical site infection, b. fragilis was most predominantly isolated, followed by bacteroides caccae, b. thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides ovatus and b. wadsworthia, in this order. in this series, vancomycin-resistant mrsa (methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus  spp. and multidrug-resistant p. aeruginosa were not observed. we should carefully follow up b. wadsworthia which was resistant to various antimicrobial agents, and also bacteroides spp. which was resistant to many beta-lactams.

TI  == [bacteria isolated from surgical infections and its susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents--special references to bacteria isolated between april 2006  and march 2007].
AB  == tendency of isolated bacteria from infections in abdominal surgery during the period from april 2006 to march 2007 were investigated in a multicenter study in  japan, and the following results were obtained. in this series, 474 strains including 23 strains of candida spp. were isolated from 170 (75.2%) of 226 patients with surgical infections. two hundred and twenty-six strains were isolated from primary infections, and 224 strains were isolated from postoperative infections. from primary infections, anaerobic gram-negative bacteria were predominant, followed by aerobic gram-negative bacteria, while from postoperative infections aerobic gram-positive bacteria were predominant, followed by anaerobic gram-negative bacteria. among aerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of staphylococcus spp. was higher from postoperative infections, while enterococcus spp. was higher from primary infections. among aerobic gram-negative bacteria, escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae and pseudomonas aeruginosa, in this order, and from postoperative infections, p. aeruginosa was the most predominantly isolated, followed by e. coli and e. cloacae. among anaerobic gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of bilophila wadsworthia was the highest from primary infections, followed by bacteroides fragilis and from postoperative infections, b. fragilis was most predominately isolated, followed by bacteroides caccae, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and b. wadsworthia in this order. in this series, we noticed no  methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, nor multidrug-resistant p. aeruginosa. there were three strains of methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative  staphylococcus aureus, but all of them had good susceptibilities against various  anti-mrsa antibiotics. we should carefully follow up b. wadsworthia.

TI  == leukemoid reaction in epidermal squamous cell carcinoma.
AB  == there have been no previous concrete reports of leukemoid reactions associated with squamous cell carcinoma originating in cutaneous tissue. here we report a case of epidermal squamous cell carcinoma of the sacral region and an associated  leukemoid reaction. the tumor invaded deeply and destroyed both the sacrum and coccyx. the white blood cell count was greater than 20,000/mm3. after resection of the tumor, white blood cells transiently decreased, but did not fall under 10,000/mm3. post-operative infection by methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and bacteroides caccae caused sepsis and further elevation of the leukocytes to greater than 50,000/mm3. the leukemoid reaction in the case appeared to have been caused initially by direct invasion of bone by epidermal squamous cell carcinoma and later by severe infection.
