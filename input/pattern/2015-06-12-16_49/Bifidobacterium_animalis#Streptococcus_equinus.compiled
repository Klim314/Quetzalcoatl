TI  - Screening of species-specific lactic acid bacteria for veal calves multi-strain probiotic adjuncts.
AB  - The selection of promising specific species of lactic acid bacteria with potential probiotic characteristics is of particular interest in producing multi species-specific probiotic adjuncts in veal calves rearing. The aim of the present work was to select and evaluate in vitro the functional activity of lactic acid bacteria, Bifidobacterium longum and Bacillus coagulans strains isolated from veal calves in order to assess their potential use as multi species-specific probiotics for veal calves. For this purpose, bacterial strains isolated from faeces collected from 40 healthy 50-day-calves, were identified by RiboPrinter and 16s rRNA gene sequence. The most frequent strains belonged to the species B. longum, Streptococcus bovis, Lactobacillus animalis and Streptococcus macedonicus. Among these, 7 strains were chosen for testing their probiotic characteristics in vitro. Three strains, namely L. animalis SB310, Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei SB137 and B. coagulans SB117 showed varying individual but promising capabilities to survive in the gastrointestinal tract, to adhere, to produce antimicrobial compounds. These three selected species-specific bacteria demonstrated in vitro, both singularly and mixed, the functional properties needed for their use as potential probiotics in veal calves.
TI  - Biological and genetic classification of canine intestinal lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria.
AB  - To investigate the distribution of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) inhabiting canine intestines, a total of 374 gram-positive LAB and bifidobacteria (BF) isolated from large intestinal contents in 36 dogs were classified and identified by phenotypic and genetic analyses. Based on cell morphological sizes, these isolates were divided into seven biotypes containing the genera Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Enterococcus, and Streptococcus. The LAB and BF isolates were classified into 38 chemotypes based on SDS-PAGE protein profile analysis of whole cells. Furthermore, partial 16S rDNA sequencing analysis demonstrated the presence of 24 bacterial species in the 38 chemotypes from 36 dogs. The identified species consisted of ten species belonging to the genus Lactobacillus (78.8%), seven species to the genus Bifidobacterium (6.8%), five species to the genus Enterococcus (11.6%), one species of Streptococcus bovis (2.0%), and one species of Pediococcus acidilactici (0.8%). In particular, the most predominant species in canine intestines were L. reuteri, L. animalis, and L. johnsonii and were found in the high frequency of occurrence of 77.8, 80.6, and 86.1%, respectively. Besides these, Enterococcus faecalis, Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis, Pediococcus acidilactici, and Streptococcus bovis were also isolated in the present study. The sequences of the isolates also showed high levels of similarity to those of the reference strains registered previously in the DDBJ and the similarity was above 97.2%. Their partial 16S rRNA genes were registered in the DDBJ.
