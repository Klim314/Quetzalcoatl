TI  == eubacterium limosum activates isoxanthohumol from hops (humulus lupulus l.) into  the potent phytoestrogen 8-prenylnaringenin in vitro and in rat intestine.
AB  == recently, it was shown that the exposure to the potent hop phytoestrogen 8-prenylnaringenin (8-pn) depends on intestinal bacterial activation of isoxanthohumol (ix), but this occurs in only one-third of tested individuals. as  the butyrate-producing eubacterium limosum can produce 8-pn from ix, a probiotic  strategy was applied to investigate whether 8-pn production could be increased in low 8-pn producers, thus balancing phytoestrogen exposure. using fecal samples from high (hop +) and low (hop -) 8-pn-producing individuals, a hop + and hop - dynamic intestinal model was developed. in parallel, hop + and hop - human microbiota-associated rats were developed, germ-free (gf) rats acting as negative controls. ix and then ix + e. limosum were administered in the intestinal model and to the rats, and changes in 8-pn production and exposure were assessed. after dosing ix, 80% was converted into 8-pn in the hop + model and highest 8-pn production, plasma concentrations, and urinary and fecal excretion occurred in the hop + rats. administration of the bacterium triggered 8-pn production in the  gf rats and increased 8-pn production in the hop - model and hop - rats. 8-pn excretion was similar in the feces (294.1 +/- 132.2 nmol/d) and urine (8.5 +/- 1.1 nmol/d ) of all rats (n = 18). in addition, butyrate production increased in  all rats. in conclusion, intestinal microbiota determined 8-pn production and exposure after ix intake. moreover, e. limosum administration increased 8-pn production in low producers, resulting in similar 8-pn production in all rats.
