isolation of a selected microbial consortium capable of degrading methyl parathion and p-nitrophenol from a contaminated soil site.
a bacterial consortium with the ability to degrade methyl parathion and p-nitrophenol, using these compounds as the only carbon source, was obtained by selective enrichment in a medium with methyl parathion. samples were taken from moravia, medellin; an area that is highly contaminated, owing to the fact that it was used as a garbage dump from 1974 to 1982. acinetobacter sp, pseudomonas putida, bacillus sp, pseudomonas aeruginosa citrobacter freundii, stenotrophomonas sp, flavobacterium sp, proteus vulgaris, pseudomonas sp, acinetobacter sp, klebsiella sp and proteus sp were the microorganisms identified within the consortium. in culture, the consortium was able to degrade 150 mg l(-)(1) of methyl-parathion and p-nitrophenol in 120 h, but after adding glucose or peptone to the culture, the time of degradation decreased to 24 h. in soil, the consortium was also able to degrade 150 mg l(-)(1) of methyl parathion in 120 h at different depths and also managed to decrease the toxicity.
