TI  == abundance and diversity of mucosa-associated hydrogenotrophic microbes in the healthy human colon.
AB  == hydrogenotrophic microbiota have a significant impact on colonic health; however, little is known about their diversity and ecology in situ. here, molecular-based  methods and multivariate analyses were used to examine the abundance and diversity of mucosa-associated hydrogenotrophic microbes in 90 biopsies collected from right colon, left colon and rectum of 25 healthy subjects. functional genes  of all three hydrogenotrophic groups were detected in at least one colonic region of all subjects. methanogenic archaea (ma) constituted approximately one half of  the hydrogenotrophic microbiota in each colonic region. sulfate-reducing bacteria (srb) were more abundant than acetogens in right colon, while acetogens were more abundant than srb in left colon and rectum. ma genotypes exhibited low diversity, whereas srb genotypes were diverse and generally similar across the three regions within subject but significantly variable among subjects. multivariate cluster analysis defined subject-specific patterns for the diversity of srb genotypes; however, neither subject- nor region-specific clusters were observed for the abundance of hydrogenotrophic functional genes. sequence analyses of functional gene clones revealed that mucosa-associated srb were phylogenetically related to  desulfovibrio piger, desulfovibrio desulfuricans and bilophila wadsworthia; whereas ma were related to methanobrevibacter spp., mb. smithii and the order methanomicrobiales. together these data demonstrate for the first time that the human colonic mucosa is persistently colonized by all three groups of hydrogenotrophic microbes, which exhibit segmental and interindividual variation  in abundance and diversity.

TI  == anaerobic degradation of lactate by syntrophic associations of methanosarcina barkeri and desulfovibrio species and effect of h(2) on acetate degradation.
AB  == when grown in the absence of added sulfate, cocultures of desulfovibrio desulfuricans or desulfovibrio vulgaris with methanobrevibacter smithii (methanobacterium ruminantium), which uses h(2) and co(2) for methanogenesis, degraded lactate, with the production of acetate and ch(4). when d. desulfuricans or d. vulgaris was grown in the absence of added sulfate in coculture with methanosarcina barkeri (type strain), which uses both h(2)-co(2) and acetate for  methanogenesis, lactate was stoichiometrically degraded to ch(4) and presumably to co(2). during the first 12 days of incubation of the d. desulfuricans-m. barkeri coculture, lactate was completely degraded, with almost stoichiometric production of acetate and ch(4). later, acetate was degraded to ch(4) and presumably to co(2). in experiments in which 20 mm acetate and 0 to 20 mm lactate were added to d. desulfuricans-m. barkeri cocultures, no detectable degradation of acetate occurred until the lactate was catabolized. the ultimate rate of acetate utilization for methanogenesis was greater for those cocultures receiving the highest levels of lactate. a small amount of h(2) was detected in cocultures  which contained d. desulfuricans and m. barkeri until after all lactate was degraded. the addition of h(2), but not of lactate, to the growth medium inhibited acetate degradation by pure cultures of m. barkeri. pure cultures of m. barkeri produced ch(4) from acetate at a rate equivalent to that observed for cocultures containing m. barkeri. inocula of m. barkeri grown with h(2)-co(2) as  the methanogenic substrate produced ch(4) from acetate at a rate equivalent to that observed for acetate-grown inocula when grown in a rumen fluid-vitamin-based medium but not when grown in a yeast extract-based medium. the results suggest that h(2) produced by the desulfovibrio species during growth with lactate inhibited acetate degradation by m. barkeri.
