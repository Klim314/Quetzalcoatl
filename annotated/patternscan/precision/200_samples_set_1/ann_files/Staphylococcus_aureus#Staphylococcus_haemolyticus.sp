TI  == prevalence, species distribution and antimicrobial resistance patterns of methicillin-resistant staphylococci in lithuanian pet animals.
AB  == background: the bacterial genus staphylococcus consists of many species that causes infections in pet animals. antimicrobial resistant staphylococci cause infections that are difficult to treat and they are important from the point of one health perspective. the aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of  methicillin-resistant staphylococcus (mrs) species, including methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) in diseased pet animals (group a) and kennel dogs (group b) in lithuania and to characterize the isolates according to  their antimicrobial resistance. results: twenty-one mrs isolates were obtained from 395 clinical samples (5.3 %; ci 95 % 3.5-8.0) of group a animals. sixteen, four and one isolates were from dogs, cats and a pet rabbit, respectively. the meca gene was present in 20 isolates, whereas one isolate was positive for the mecc gene. twenty-one mrs isolates (20.0 %; ci 95 % 13.5-28.6) were obtained from the vagina of female dogs (n = 105) (group b). all isolates carried the meca gene. twelve mrs species were isolated of which s. pseudintermedius was the most  common (18/42) followed by s. haemolyticus (8/42) and s. lentus (4/42). mrsa was  not found. all mrs strains were susceptible to vancomycin, linezolid, daptomycin  and quinupristin/dalfopristin. resistance to tetracycline (16/21), clindamycin (15/21) and erythromycin (14/21) was the most common types of resistance in group a animals. three isolates also demonstrated resistance to rifampin. resistance toward gentamicin (16/21), ciprofloxacin (15/21), macrolides (15/21) and tetracycline (12/21) was the most common in kennel dogs (group b). the most common genes encoding resistance to antimicrobials (excluding beta-lactams) in isolates from group a pets were tetk (21/42), aph(3')-iiia (11/42) and aac(6')-ie-aph(2'')-ia (9/42). conclusions: a wide range of mrs species were found in pet animals in lithuania. mrsa was not found.

TI  == decade-long use of the antimicrobial peptide combination tyrothricin does not pose a major risk of acquired resistance with gram-positive bacteria and candida  spp.
AB  == tyrothricin, an antimicrobial peptide combination produced by bacillus brevis consisting of gramicidins and tyrocidins commands broad antimicrobial activity against gram-positive bacteria and some yeasts in vitro. the polypeptide and its  components have been used therapeutically for about 60 years in the local treatment of infected skin and infected oro-pharyngeal mucous membranes. though older studies suggest that resistance development of originally susceptible microorganisms towards tyrothricin is a rare event, data concerning recent state  of resistance are lacking. in the present in vitro study the susceptibility to tyrothricin of clinical isolates of bacterial and yeast origin from superficial swabs of the skin and mucous membranes of outpatients and inpatients obtained from clinical material in the second half of the year 2003 was determined. using  a microdilution assay, the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic and mic90, defined as the concentration that inhibits at least 90 percent of the tested strains) of 20 strains each of staphylococcus aureus of the variety mssa (susceptible to methicillin), staphylococcus aureus of the variety mrsa (methicillin resistant), staphylococcus haemolyticus, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis, corynebacterium spec., candida albicans and candida parapsilosis was determined. all of the tested gram-positive bacteria turned out  to be highly susceptible to tyrothricin with mics </= 4mg/l. the tested yeast strains were susceptible to the polypeptide antibiotic as well, but (with mics of 16 mg/l and 32 mg/l, respectively) to a lesser extent. no acquired resistance of  the tested strains was determined, indicating that the risk of resistance development against topically applied tyrothricin is only marginal, if there is any at all. thus, long-term-, i.e. decade-long use of topically applied tyrothricin and its components in the local treatment of infected skin does not pose a major risk with respect to acquired resistance of originally susceptible gram-positive bacteria and yeasts, not even in the case of staphylococcus aureus, both with mssa and mrsa strains. the broad anti-bacterial and anti-fungal activity of tyrothricin combined with its lacking risk for resistance development make the antimicrobial peptide a valuable addition to our therapeutic armamentarium in the treatment of infected skin.

TI  == identification of abc transporter genes conferring combined pleuromutilin-lincosamide-streptogramin a resistance in bovine methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the genetic basis of combined pleuromutilin-lincosamide-streptogramin a resistance in 26 unrelated methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons) from dairy cows suffering from mastitis. the 26 pleuromutilin-resistant staphylococcal isolates were screened for the presence of the genes vga(a), vga(b), vga(c), vga(e), vga(e) variant, sal(a), vmlr, cfr, lsa(a), lsa(b), lsa(c), and lsa(e) by pcr. none of the 26 isolates carried the genes vga(b), vga(c), vga(e), vga(e) variant, vmlr, cfr, lsa(a), lsa(b), or lsa(c). two staphylococcus haemolyticus and single staphylococcus xylosus, staphylococcus lentus, and staphylococcus hominis were vga(a)-positive. twelve s. aureus, two staphylococcus warneri, as well as single s. lentus and s. xylosus carried the lsa(e) gene. moreover, single s. aureus, s. haemolyticus, s. xylosus, and staphylococcus epidermidis were positive for both genes, vga(a) and lsa(e). the sal(a) gene was found in a single staphylococcus sciuri. all abc transporter  genes were located in the chromosomal dna, except for a plasmid-borne vga(a) gene in the s. epidermidis isolate. the genetic environment of the lsa(e)-positive isolates was analyzed using previously described pcr assays. except for the s. warneri and s. xylosus, all lsa(e)-positive isolates harbored a part of the previously described enterococcal multiresistance gene cluster. this is the first report of the novel lsa(e) gene in the aforementioned bovine cons species. this is also the first identification of the sal(a) gene in a s. sciuri from a case of bovine mastitis. moreover, the sal(a) gene was shown to also confer pleuromutilin resistance.

TI  == conjunctival flora of clinically normal and diseased turtles and tortoises.
AB  == background: in captive breed turtles and tortoises conjunctival disease is common. our aim was to investigate the bacterial and fungal flora present in the  eyes of healthy and pathological chelonians and to compare findings in turtles with those in tortoises. results: samples were taken from the conjunctival sacs of 34, diseased and healthy, chelonians (18 tortoises and 16 turtles) and submitted to bacterial and fungal investigation. all samples showed bacterial growth. thirteen animals (38%), harboured a single bacterial species as sole isolate and twenty-one animals (62%) harboured more than one species. detection of multiple bacterial infection was clearly greater in tortoises compared to turtles. most frequently isolated bacterial species were bacillus spp. (13 isolates), staphylococcus xylosus (10 isolates), sphingomonas paucimobilis (6 isolates), staphylococcus sciuri and aeromonas hydrophila/caviae (each 5 isolates), ochrobactrum anthropi (3 isolates), citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae and pseudomonas luteola (each 2 isolates). only one isolate of kocuria varians/rosea, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus auricularis, staphylococcus  haemolyticus, staphylococcus lentus, morganella morganii, pasteurella multocida,  pasteurella pneumotropica/haemolytica, proteus spp., pseudomonas putida, salmonella enterica ssp. arizonae, stenotrophomonas maltophilia and vibrio parahaemolyticus was evidenced. the presence in 8 animals of mycoplasma spp. and  in 1 animal with severe conjunctivitis of chlamydia spp. was detected by pcr. candida spp. was also isolated from two healthy animals. conclusions: a clear predominance of gram positive isolates in tortoises and gram negative isolates in turtles was found. however, we cannot ascribe the observed difference to the diversity of animal species, as other factors, including especially different characteristics of the living environments, may play a role. almost all bacterial species isolated may have clinical significance, mostly as opportunistic pathogens, both for humans and animals. that chelonians are often carrier of bacteria with zoonotic potential is a well-known fact, in particular with regard  to salmonella spp. therefore, it is not surprising the detection of a strain of salmonella enterica ssp. arizonae in the eye of one of the animals tested. worthy of note is the finding of chlamydia spp. in a severe case of conjunctivitis, though we cannot epidemiologically assess a cause-effect relationship between presence of chlamydia and disease.

TI  == characterization of methicillin-resistant and -susceptible staphylococcal isolates from bovine milk in northwestern china.
AB  == emergence of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (mr-cons) in bovine milk is a major public health concern. the primary purpose of this research was to determine molecular genetic characteristics and antibiotic resistance of staphylococcal isolates recovered from milk of mastitic cows in the shaanxi province in northwestern china. one hundred and thirteen methicillin-susceptible  staphylococcus aureus (mssa), one meca-positive and phenotype-positive mrsa, seven meca- and mecc- negative but phenotype-positive mrsa and two mr-cons including one oxacillin-susceptible meca-positive staphylococcus haemolyticus (os-mrsh) and one meca-positive and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis (mrse) isolates were recovered from 214 quarter milk samples on 4 dairy farms. all above 123 isolates were subjected to antibiotic resistance profiling. s. aureus isolates were also genotyped using the spa typing and the multilocus sequence typing (mlst). eight mrsa and 2 mr-cons isolates were additionally tested for sccmec types. resistance was common among isolates against ampicillin or penicillin (80.5%), kanamycin (68.3%), gentamicin (67.5%),  tetracycline (43.9%) and chloramphenicol (30.1%). however, no isolate was resistant to vancomycin or teicoplanin. twenty, 29 and 58 isolates showed resistance to 1, 2 or more than 2 antibiotics, respectively. the predominant multidrug resistance profile was penicillin/ampicillin/kanamycin/gentamicin/tetracycline (46 isolates). most s. aureus isolates belonged to spa types t524 (n = 63), t11772 (a new type, n = 31)  and t4207 (n = 15). at the same time, mlst types st71 (n = 67) and st2738 (a new  type, n = 45) were identified as dominant sequence types. the meca-positive and phenotype-positive mrsa isolate had a composite genotype t524-st71-sccmeciva, while 7 meca-negative but phenotype-positive mrsa isolates were all t524-st71. the os-mrsh isolate contained a type v sccmec cassette, while the mrse isolate possessed a non-typeable sccmec. the spa-mlst types t11772-st2738 (n = 27), t11807-st2683 (n = 4) and t11771-st2738 (n = 3) were newly identified genotypes of s. aureus. these new genotypes and multidrug-resistant staphylococci could pose additional threat to animal and human health.

TI  == aspartate inhibits staphylococcus aureus biofilm formation.
AB  == biofilm formation renders staphylococcus aureus highly resistant to conventional  antibiotics and host defenses. four d-amino acids (d-leu, d-met, d-trp and d-tyr) have been reported to be able to inhibit biofilm formation and disassemble established s. aureus biofilms. we report here for the first time that both d- and l-isoforms of aspartate (asp) inhibited s. aureus biofilm formation on tissue culture plates. similar biofilm inhibition effects were also observed against other staphylococcal strains, including s. saprophyticus, s. equorum, s. chromogenes and s. haemolyticus. it was found that asp at high concentrations (>10 mm) inhibited the growth of planktonic n315 cells, but at subinhibitory concentrations decreased the cellular metabolic activity without influencing cell growth. the decreased cellular metabolic activity might be the reason for the production of less protein and dna in the matrix of the biofilms formed in the presence of asp. however, varied inhibition efficacies of asp were observed for biofilms formed by clinical staphylococcal isolates. there might be mechanisms other than decreasing the metabolic activity, e.g. the biofilm phenotypes, affecting biofilm formation in the presence of asp.

TI  == characterization of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus spp. isolated from dogs  in korea.
AB  == staphylococci were isolated from dogs in animal hospitals, animal shelters, and the daegu pet expo to investigate the characteristics of circulating methicillin-resistant staphylococcal (mrs) strains in companion animals in korea. a total of 36/157 isolates were classified as mrs, and subdivided as follows: 1 methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), 4 methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis, 2 methicillin-resistant staphylococcus haemolyticus,  and 29 mrs spp. among the 36 mrs isolates tested, 100% were resistant to oxacillin and penicillin, and at least 50% were resistant to sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (69.4%), erythromycin (63.9%), tetracycline (58.3%), cefoxitin (55.6%), clindamycin (50.0%) or pirlimycin (50.0%). additionally, 34/36 mrs isolates (94.4%) were meca positive, 15 of which were further classified as sccmec type v, 6 isolates as type i, 4 isolates as type iiib, 1 isolate as type iva, 1 isolate as type iv, with 7 isolates being non-classifiable. the results of multilocus sequence typing and spa typing for the one mrsa strain were st 72 (1-4-1-8-4-4-3) and spa t148. our results provide  evidence that companion animals like dogs may be mrs carriers, and that continued surveillance of mrs in companion animals is required to prevent increased incidences in humans.

TI  == drug resistance and molecular epidemiology of aerobic bacteria isolated from puerperal infections in bangladesh.
AB  == puerperal infection is a common complication during postnatal period in developing countries. bacterial species, drug resistance, and genetic characteristics were investigated for a total of 470 isolates from puerperal infections in bangladesh for a 2-year period (2010-2012). the most common species was escherichia coli (n=98), followed by enterococcus faecalis (n=54), staphylococcus haemolyticus (n=33), proteus mirabilis (n=32), staphylococcus aureus (n=27), klebsiella pneumoniae (n=22), and enterobacter cloacae (n=21). s.  aureus and acinetobacter baumannii were isolated at a higher frequency from wound infections after cesarean section, while e. coli, e. cloacae, and k. pneumoniae were isolated from community-acquired endometritis and urinary tract infections.  resistance to third-generation cephalosporins was frequent for enterobacteriacae, and was mainly mediated by blactx-m-1 group beta-lactamases. the ctx-m gene in e. coli from the four phylogroups was identified as blactx-m-15, and phylogroup b2 isolates with blactx-m-15 were classified into st131 with o25b allele, harboring  aac(6')-ib-cr and various virulence factors. carbapenemase genes blandm-1 and blandm-7 were identified in one isolate each of phylogroup a e. coli. methicillin-resistant s. aureus isolates had type iv or v sccmec, including isolates of st361 (cc672), which is related to an emerging st672 clone in the indian subcontinent. this study revealed the recent epidemiological status of aerobic bacteria causing puerperal infections in bangladesh, providing useful information to improve clinical practice and infection control.

TI  == reduction of teat skin mastitis pathogen loads: differences between strains, dips, and contact times.
AB  == the purpose of these experiments was to (1) assess differences in mastitis pathogen strain sensitivities to teat disinfectants (teat dips), and (2) determine the optimum time for premilking teat dips to remain in contact with teat skin to reduce pathogen loads on teat skin. two experiments were conducted using the excised teat model. in experiment 1, the differences in mastitis pathogen strain sensitivities to 4 commercially available dips (dip a: 1% h2o2; dip b: 1% chlorine dioxide; dip c: 1% iodophor; and dip d: 0.5% iodophor) were evaluated. four strains of 11 common mastitis pathogens (staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, mycoplasma bovis, streptococcus dysgalactiae, streptococcus uberis, escherichia coli, staphylococcus chromogenes, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus hyicus, staphylococcus xylosus, and staphylococcus haemolyticus) were tested. in experiment 2, the percentage log reduction of mastitis pathogens (escherichia coli, streptococcus uberis, streptococcus dysgalactiae, klebsiella species, staphylococcus chromogenes, staphylococcus haemolyticus, staphylococcus xylosus, and staphylococcus epidermidis) on teat skin with 3 commercially available teat dips: dip a; dip d;  and dip e: 0.25% iodophor, using dip contact times of 15, 30, and 45 s, was evaluated. experiment 1 results indicated significant differences in strain sensitivities to dips within pathogen species: staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus chromogenes, and streptococcus uberis. species differences were also found where mycoplasma bovis (97.9% log reduction) was the most sensitive to tested teat dips and staphylococcus haemolyticus (71.4% log reduction) the most resistant. experiment 2 results indicated that contact times of 30 and 45 s were  equally effective in reducing recovered bacteria for dips d and e and were also significantly more effective than a 15-s contact time. no differences were seen in recovered bacteria between tested contact times after treatment with dip a. it can be concluded that different mastitis pathogen species and strains within species may possess different sensitivities to teat dips, which may have implications in selection of teat dips on dairies. furthermore, a 30-s premilking dip contact time for iodophors and 15 s for h2o2 dips may be optimal in reducing  pathogen load in the shortest amount of time. a reduction in premilking teat dip  contact time may improve milking parlor efficiency.

TI  == etiologic diagnosis and clinical treatment of multiple drug-resistant bacteria infection in elderly patients with stroke-associated pneumonia after neurosurgery.
AB  == our objective is to analyze the etiology and antibiotics resistance rate of multiple drug-resistant bacteria infection in elderly patients with stroke-associated pneumonia from neurosurgery department, providing a reference for clinical treatment. sputum of 372 elderly patients with stroke-associated pneumonia (sap) from neurosurgery department was collected for sputum culture and drug sensitivity test, and pathogenic bacteria distribution and drug resistance rate of antibiotics were discussed. among 372 pathogenic bacteria, there were 95  cases with gram-positive cocci, the percentage was 15.32 %; there were 277 cases  with gram-negative bacilli, the percentage was 59.95 %; there were 54 cases with  fungus, the percentage was 14.51 %; the common gram-positive cocci included staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus haemolyticus and staphylococcus epidermidis, with percentages of 15.32 %, 2.96 % and 4.30 % respectively; the common gram-negative bacilli included pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae, with percentages of 23.92 %, 14.25 % and 9.95 % respectively; the highest drug resistance rates of staphylococcus aureus were 100.00 % to penicillin, erythrocin and oxacillin, the highest drug resistance rate of staphylococcus epidermidis was 87.50 % to erythrocin, the highest drug resistance rate of staphylococcus haemolyticus was 100.00 % to penicillin and erythrocin, the lowest drug resistance rates of three gram-negative bacilli were  0 % to teicoplanin and vancomycin; the highest drug resistance rates of escherichia coli were 100.00 % to ceftriaxone and ticarcillin, and the lowest drug resistance rate was 11.32 % to ciprofloxacin; the highest drug resistance rate of pseudomonas aeruginosa was 100.00 % to ceftriaxone, and the lowest drug resistance rate was 22.47 % to imipenem; the highest drug resistance rate of klebsiella pneumoniae was 81.08 % to aztreonam, and the lowest drug resistance rate was 0.00 % to imipenem. stroke-associated pneumonia is common clinically in  elderly patients from neurology department, the early-stage and rational use of antibiotics should be applied according to the etiologic distribution and drug resistance characteristics. meanwhile, prevention measures should be applied.

TI  == coagulase-negative staphylococci.
AB  == the definition of the heterogeneous group of coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons) is still based on diagnostic procedures that fulfill the clinical need to  differentiate between staphylococcus aureus and those staphylococci classified historically as being less or nonpathogenic. due to patient- and procedure-related changes, cons now represent one of the major nosocomial pathogens, with s. epidermidis and s. haemolyticus being the most significant species. they account substantially for foreign body-related infections and infections in preterm newborns. while s. saprophyticus has been associated with acute urethritis, s. lugdunensis has a unique status, in some aspects resembling  s. aureus in causing infectious endocarditis. in addition to cons found as food-associated saprophytes, many other cons species colonize the skin and mucous membranes of humans and animals and are less frequently involved in clinically manifested infections. this blurred gradation in terms of pathogenicity is reflected by species- and strain-specific virulence factors and the development of different host-defending strategies. clearly, cons possess fewer virulence properties than s. aureus, with a respectively different disease spectrum. in this regard, host susceptibility is much more important. therapeutically, cons are challenging due to the large proportion of methicillin-resistant strains and  increasing numbers of isolates with less susceptibility to glycopeptides.

TI  == acinetobacter baumannii neonatal mastitis: a case report.
AB  == introduction: neonatal mastitis is a rare infection. when it does occur, infants  younger than 2 months of age are typically affected and the majority of cases are caused by staphylococcus aureus. we present the first reported case of neonatal mastitis caused by acinetobacter baumannii, an unusual organism for this type of  infection. case presentation: a 15-day-old full-term caucasian male neonate presented to our emergency room following fever at home and was admitted for routine neonatal sepsis evaluation. after admission, he developed purulent drainage from his right nipple, was diagnosed with mastitis, and was started on empiric therapy with clindamycin and cefotaxime with presumed coverage for s. aureus. drainage culture identified pan-susceptible acinetobacter baumannii/haemolyticus and antibiotic therapy was changed to ceftazidime. he was  discharged after 5 days of ceftazidime with complete resolution of his symptoms.  conclusions: this case illustrates the importance of obtaining drainage cultures  in mastitis cases because of the possibility of organisms besides s. aureus causing infection. acinetobacter baumannii is considered part of the normal human flora and is associated with serious infections in intensive care units. this is  the first case report describing acinetobacter baumannii as an etiologic agent of neonatal mastitis and highlights the importance of including unusual organisms in the differential for infectious etiologies for general practitioners.

TI  == improvement in staphylococcus and bacillus strain differentiation by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry profiling by using microwave-assisted enzymatic digestion.
AB  == rationale: distinguishing between individual bacterial strains below the species  level is a challenge to matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms) bacterial profiling. we propose a quick method for improving strain differentiation of two staphylococcus and one bacillus species. methods: an alternative procedure to the extraction protocol recommended by bruker daltonics was developed. ethanol-sterilized cells of six s. aureus and six s. haemolyticus strains were digested by trypsin using 2-min microwave irradiation and were then analyzed. twenty-eight strains belonging to two ecotypes of b. subtilis were subjected to the same procedure to extend the scope of the method. results: s. aureus and s. haemolyticus strains, only partially distinguishable by the standard sample preparation procedure, were subjected to microwave-assisted tryptic digestion. the repeatability of the procedure was checked in three experiments accomplished at weekly intervals. clear distinction of the strains was achieved by cluster analysis. the differentiation of b. subtilis ecotypes was also improved significantly by the digestion method. the discriminatory power of the novel method was supported by an increase in the number of strain-specific peaks, as compared to the standard method. conclusions: the method modulates the discriminatory power of maldi-tof ms profiling. the differentiation of a set of s. aureus, s. haemolyticus and b. subtilis strains was improved significantly after microwave-accelerated tryptic digestion of the cellular material.

TI  == [identification of staphylococci directly from positive blood culture bottles by  maldi-tof ms system].
AB  == bloodstream infections are substantial causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. staphylococcus species are the most commonly isolated microorganisms from blood cultures in clinical microbiology laboratories. maldi-tof ms (matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time- of- flight mass spectrometry)  system allows the identification of microorganisms directly from positive blood culture bottles. the aim of this study was to evaluate the maldi-tof ms system for the identification of staphylococci directly from the positive blood culture  bottles which revealed the presence of gram-positive cocci by staining. a total of 96 positive blood culture bottles that yielded gram-positive cocci by gram stain were evaluated. these blood cultures were obtained from 69 patients between december 2013-february 2014. conventional methods and bd phoenix automated bacterial identification system (becton dickinson, usa) were used for routine identification. the strains were also identified by real-time taqman pcr (qpcr) which was considered as the reference method. in maldi-tof ms method, maldi sepsityper kit was used for the bacterial identification and all measurements were carried out by using microflex lt instrument and flexcontrol 3.0 software (bruker daltonics, usa). of 96 culture bottles positive for gram-positive cocci,  90 were correctly identified as staphylococci at genus level with all the three study methods (qpcr, bd phoenix, bruker maldi-tof ms). the other six samples were identified as enterococcus faecium (n= 4) and streptococcus pyogenes (n= 2) by both phoenix and the maldi-tof systems. of the 90 samples, 87 were identified at  the species level (15 s.aureus, 33 s.epidermidis, 29 s.hominis, 10 s.haemolyticus) and three at the genus level by the reference qpcr method. when comparing the results obtained by qpcr and bruker maldi-tof ms, incompatibility was detected for three isolates. those isolates were identified as s.hominis by qpcr, however two of them were identified as s.haemolyticus and one as s.epidermidis by maldi-tof ms. compared with real-time taqman pcr it was detected that bruker maldi tof ms was identified 100% of s.aureus to the genus and species level and 100% and 96.6% of coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns) to the genus and species level, respectively. in conclusion, it was thought that bruker maldi  tof ms system may allow rapid and reliable identification of s.aureus and cns directly from positive blood culture bottles compared with the routine methods used in the clinical microbiology laboratory.

TI  == bacteriophage-derived chap domain protein, p128, kills staphylococcus cells by cleaving interpeptide cross-bridge of peptidoglycan.
AB  == p128 is an anti-staphylococcal protein consisting of the staphylococcus aureus phage-k-derived tail-associated muralytic enzyme (tame) catalytic domain (lys16)  fused with the cell-wall-binding sh3b domain of lysostaphin. in order to understand the mechanism of action and emergence of resistance to p128, we isolated mutants of staphylococcus spp., including meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), resistant to p128. in addition to p128, the mutants also showed resistance to lys16, the catalytic domain of p128. the mutants showed loss of fitness as shown by reduced rate of growth in vitro. one of the mutants tested was found to show reduced virulence in animal models of s. aureus septicaemia suggesting loss of fitness in vivo as well. analysis of the antibiotic sensitivity pattern showed that the mutants derived from mrsa strains  had become sensitive to meticillin and other beta-lactams. interestingly, the mutant cells were resistant to the lytic action of phage k, although the phage was able to adsorb to these cells. sequencing of the fema gene of three p128-resistant mutants showed either a truncation or deletion in fema, suggesting that improper cross-bridge formation in s. aureus could be causing resistance to  p128. using glutathione s-transferase (gst) fusion peptides as substrates it was  found that both p128 and lys16 were capable of cleaving a pentaglycine sequence,  suggesting that p128 might be killing s. aureus by cleaving the pentaglycine cross-bridge of peptidoglycan. moreover, peptides corresponding to the reported cross-bridge of staphylococcus haemolyticus (ggsgg, agsgg), which were not cleaved by lysostaphin, were cleaved efficiently by p128. this was also reflected in high sensitivity of s. haemolyticus to p128. this showed that in spite of sharing a common mechanism of action with lysostaphin, p128 has unique properties, which allow it to act on certain lysostaphin-resistant staphylococcus strains.

AB  == staphylococcal species acquire antibiotic resistance by incorporating the mobile-genetic element sccmec. we previously found that sccmec-encoded psm-mec rna suppresses exotoxin production as a regulatory rna, and the psm-mec translation product increases biofilm formation in staphylococcus aureus. here, we examined whether the regulatory role of psm-mec on host bacterial virulence properties is conserved among other staphylococcal species, s. epidermidis and s. haemolyticus, both of which are important causes of nosocomial infections. in s.  epidermidis, introduction of psm-mec decreased the production of cytolytic toxins called phenol-soluble modulins (psms) and increased biofilm formation. introduction of psm-mec with a stop-codon mutation that did not express psm-mec protein but did express psm-mec rna also decreased psm production, but did not increase biofilm formation. thus, the psm-mec rna inhibits psm production, whereas the psm-mec protein increases biofilm formation in s. epidermidis. in s.  haemolyticus, introduction of psm-mec decreased psm production, but did not affect biofilm formation. the mutated psm-mec with a stop-codon also caused the same effect. thus, the psm-mec rna also inhibits psm production in s. haemolyticus. these findings suggest that the inhibitory role of psm-mec rna on exotoxin production is conserved among staphylococcal species, although the stimulating effect of the psm-mec gene on biofilm formation is not conserved.

TI  == surveillance of antimicrobial resistance among clinical isolates recovered from a tertiary care hospital in al qassim, saudi arabia.
AB  == background: the emergences of antimicrobial-resistances have become an important  issue in global healthcares. limitations in surveying hinder the actual estimates of resistance in many countries. the aim: the present study was designed to retrospectically survey antimicrobial susceptibility for resistance profiling of  dominant pathogens in a tertiary-care center in buraidah, saudi arabia from january-2011 to december-2011. materials and methods: the design was cross-sectional and spanned records of a 1000 bacterial non-related isolates. antibiograms were based on the 2012 clinical and laboratory standards institute guidelines. results: showed that staphylococcus aureus, acinetobacter baumannii,  klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus epidermidis, and escherichia coli, were the most resistant. all isolates of s. aureus, s. epidermidis, and staphylococcus haemolyticus, were resistant to penicillin (100%), and oxacillin with 52%, 75%, and 82%, respectively. interestingly, an increasing trend of resistance-pattern was seen for the three species against gentamicin 26%, 50%, 68% ciprofloxacin 22%, 50%, 68%, tetracycline 30%, 44%, 27%, erythromycin 26%, 64%, 73%, and clindamycin 20%, 47%, 50% suggesting potential between-species transfer of resistances. acinetobacter baumannii was resistances  to all antibiotics tested including ciprofloxacin (90%), ceftazidime (89%), cefepime (67%), trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (66%), amikacin (63%), gentamicin (51%), tetracycline (43%), piperacillin-tazobactam (42%), and imipenem (9%). a similar pattern was seen by p. aeruginosa. furthermore, a typical pattern of resistance in k. pneumoniae carbapenemase-producing organisms was observed. conclusion: we have shown staphylococci, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enteric bacteria were the most resistant species in this region.

TI  == diversity and evolution of oligopeptide permease systems in staphylococcal species.
AB  == several oligopeptide permease (opp) systems have been found in staphylococcal species, including opp1-4, opp3' and the arginine catabolic mobile element (acme)-encoded opp system (acme-opp). they confer upon bacteria the increasing fitness, but their evolutionary histories remain unclear. in this work, we performed a genome-wide identification of opp systems in staphylococcal species.  novel opp systems were identified, including the duplicate of opp4 in staphylococcus pseudintermedius and the acme-opp-like systems in coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons). phylogenetic analysis revealed that all  of the identified opp systems were derived from opp3 system by operon duplication during species divergence, while lateral gene transfer might also confer to the dissemination of opp in staphylococci. in addition, we proposed an improved theory on evolution of acme: the opp and arginine-deiminase systems were firstly  transferred from staphylococcus haemolyticus to staphylococcus epidermidis independently; in s. epidermidis they were assembled together and then transferred to staphylococcus aureus.

TI  == diversity of antibiotic resistance genes and staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec elements in faecal isolates of coagulase-negative staphylococci from nigeria.
AB  == background: coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons) are opportunistic pathogens found as colonisers of the human gut. this study was carried out to examine the genetic resistance mechanisms in faecal isolates of cons. the study investigated  53 non-duplicate cons isolates obtained from the fresh stool samples of apparently healthy subjects in the community of ile-ife, south-western nigeria. antibiotic susceptibility testing was assessed by the disc diffusion test while antibiotic resistance genes were analysed by pcr. meca positive isolates were analysed by staphylococcal chromosome cassette mec (sccmec) and cassette chromosome recombinase (ccr) complex typing methods. results: resistance genes were detected only in isolates that showed resistance by phenotypic screening. the aac(6')-aph(2") gene was detected in all the three isolates resistant to gentamicin. four of the five erythromycin resistant isolates were positive for the ermc gene, the remaining isolate carried the msra gene. the tetk gene was detected in 6 of the 7 tetracycline resistant isolates while 4 possessed the tetm gene. three of the isolates (s. haemolyticus, s. xylosus and s. capitis) had both genes. several sccmec types were found: sccmec i- ccrabbeta2-alpha2 (4 isolates:  3 s. epidermidis, 1 s. warneri), sccmecivb- ccrabbeta2-alpha3 (1 isolate: s. epidermidis), sccmecivd- ccrabbeta2-alpha3 (8 isolates: 3 s. epidermidis, 2 s. xylosus, 1 s. saprophyticus, 1 s. warneri, 1 s. capitis), and untypable (2 isolates: s. epidermidis). conclusion: this genetic background could be a reservoir for interspecies gene transfer among cons and s. aureus in the intestinal tract.

TI  == staphylococcus, not mrsa? a final report of carriage and conversion rates in nursing students.
AB  == objective: to evaluate and characterize staphylococcal carriage, possibly including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), and conversion rates in nursing students across clinical semester rotations and to describe risk factors. design: a prospective longitudinal cohort design with six times of measurement. data collected august 2010 to may 2012. institutional review board approval (2010f5693). setting: texas state university, san marcos, tx. participants: eighty-seven nursing students. interventions: a positive mrsa swab  was considered an end point for participation. intervention offered was bactroban (mupirocin) for nasal decolonization and an oral antibiotic, doxycycline; follow-up post treatment collection sample was done to verify decolonization prior to next clinical rotation. main outcome measures: screening for staphylococcus aureus and mrsa identification; confirmation and antibiotic susceptibility by vitek 2; self-administered questionnaires delineating demographics and risk factors; panel logistic regression models by stata version  13. results: mrsa colonization did not increase. s. aureus incidence was 17.7 - 26.4%. staphylococcal species incidence other than s. aureus increased (9.2 - 82.3%). the following odds ratio (or) associations were found to be statistically significant: boil or skin infections with s. aureus (or = 2.94, p < .01), working or volunteering in a healthcare facility odds with species other than s. aureus (or = 4.41, p < .01) and gym and sports facilities odds with s. other (or 2.45, p < .01). the most frequently occurring species at wave 5 was s. hominis (21 isolates) while the most frequently occurring species at wave 6 was s. epidermidis (25 isolates). conclusions: mrsa colonization did not increase during longitudinal study. s. aureus colonization remained fairly stable throughout the  study (17 - 26%). species colonization with non s. aureus species (e.g. s. hominis, s. epidermis, s. haemolyticus) increased significantly (9.2 - 82.3%) during clinical rotations. knowledge of infection control and compliance may have contributed to an absence of mrsa colonization; however, the colonization by other staphylococci has been shown to be a risk factor for mrsa acquisition.

TI  == nasal carriage of methicillin resistant staphylococci.
AB  == coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons) are believed to function as reservoirs, as well as possible sources of staphylococcal chromosome cassette mec (sccmec) to staphylococcus aureus, but the frequency, preferred partners, and factors promoting sccmec transfer are not known. such postulated in vivo genetic transfer events are likely to occur at anatomical sites such as the normal nasal mucosa, which is known to be colonized by both cons and coagulase positive staphylococci. in this study, we characterized s. aureus and cons strains colonizing the anterior nares of 67 patients in denmark. a total of 54 patients (80%) were colonized with staphylococci that included nine different species identified by internal transcribed spacer pcr (its-pcr) and 16s rna sequencing. the highest rates of colonization were found for s. epidermidis (58%) and s. aureus (39%). methicillin resistance was present in s. aureus (53%), s. epidermidis (53%), s. haemolyticus (33%), and s. hominis (62%). genetic backgrounds were characterized  by spa typing for s. aureus and by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis for cons. sccmec typing showed that sccmec type iv (2b) was the most common in the entire collection (65%). carriage of multiple species was detected in 20 patients (30%), 16 of whom were colonized with both s. aureus and s. epidermidis. in two cases, simultaneous carriage of different methicillin resistant species was detected. however, the strains carried different sccmec types. additional studies in the same epidemiological settings are warranted to identify interspecific genetic events that involve the acquisition of sccmec by s. aureus.

TI  == characterization of the staphylococcal cassette chromosome composite island of staphylococcus haemolyticus sh32, a methicillin-resistant clinical isolate from china.
AB  == staphylococcal cassette chromosome (scc) elements contribute considerably to virulence and resistance to antibiotic agents in staphylococci. scc elements in coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons) are highly diverse and there is evidence  suggesting that they serve as a reservoir for antibiotic resistance genes in methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa). however, only a small number  of scc elements have been characterized in cons and their exact roles in the emergence and evolution of mrsa remain to be demonstrated. here, we determined the structure of an scc composite island (cish32) found in the clinical staphylococcus haemolyticus isolate sh32 by whole-genome dna sequencing. cish32 was 48 kb in length and mainly composed of two imperfect scc elements, namely (i) a psisccmec(sh32) part containing a class c1 mec gene complex but lacking ccr genes and (ii) a sccsh32 part with a ccra5b3 gene complex but lacking mec genes.  in addition, cish32 contained a type iii restriction-modification system and several resistance loci, for example genes conferring resistance to cadmium and arsenic. psisccmec(sh32) is almost entirely identical to a pseudo sccmec element  found in s. haemolyticus wch1 and shares pronounced sequence similarity to a psisccmec element of s. haemolyticus jcsc1435. however, staphylococci other than  s. haemolyticus, including s. aureus and s. epidermidis, contain homologs of sccsh32 that are more similar to sccsh32 than those elements found in s. haemolyticus, suggesting that cish32 of s. haemolyticus sh32 was assembled in recent evolutionary events. moreover, the composite structure of cish32 indicates that the detection of class c1 mec and ccra5b3 gene complexes in s. haemolyticus  does not always indicate the existence of a ut9-type sccmec element, which has remained questionable.

TI  == microbial diversity and dynamics during the production of may bryndza cheese.
AB  == diversity and dynamics of microbial cultures were studied during the production of may bryndza cheese, a traditional slovak cheese produced from unpasteurized ewes' milk. quantitative culture-based data were obtained for lactobacilli, lactococci, total mesophilic aerobic counts, coliforms, e. coli, staphylococci, coagulase-positive staphylococci, yeasts, fungi and geotrichum spp. in ewes' milk, curd produced from it and ripened for 0 - 10 days, and in bryndza cheese produced from the curd, in three consecutive batches. diversity of prokaryotes and eukaryotes in selected stages of the production was studied by non-culture approach based on amplification of 16s rdna and internal transcribed spacer region, coupled to denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and sequencing. the culture-based data demonstrated an overall trend of growth of the microbial population contributing to lactic acid production and to ripening of the cheese,  lactobacilli, lactococci and geotrichum spp. growing up to densities of 10(8) cfu/g, 10(9) cfu/g and 10(5) cfu/g, respectively, in all three consecutive batches of bryndza cheese. the diversity of bacteria encompassed acinetobacter calcoaceticus, acinetobacter guillouiae, acinetobacter sp., acinetobacter johnsonii, citrobacter braakii, clostridium bartlettii, corynebacterium callunae, corynebacterium maris, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter asburiae, enterobacter hormaechei, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus pallens, escherichia  coli, haemophilus haemolyticus, hafnia alvei, kluyvera cryocrescens, lactobacillus helveticus, lactococcus garvieae, lc. lactis subsp. cremoris, lc. lactis subsp. lactis, "leuconostoc garlicum", mannheimia glucosida, mannheimia haemolytica, pseudomonas sp., ps. fluorescens, "ps. reactans", raoultella ornithinolytica, r. terrigena, "rothia arfidiae", staphylococcus aureus, staph. epidermidis, staph. felis, staph. pasteuri, staph. sciuri, staph. xylosus, streptococcus parauberis, str. thermophilus and variovorax paradoxus. the diversity of yeasts and fungi encompassed alternaria alternata, "ascomycete sp.", aspergillus fumigatus, beauveria brongniartii, candida xylopsoci, c. inconspicua, cladosporium cladosporioides, debaromyces hansenii, fomes fomentarius, galactomyces candidus, gymnoascus reesii, chaetomium globosum, kluyveromyces marxianus, metarhizium anisopliae, penicillium aurantiogriseum, p. camemberti, p. freii, p. polonicum, p. viridicatum, pichia kudriavzevii, sordaria alcina, trichosporon lactis and yarrowia lipolytica.

TI  == [pathogens of prostatitis and their drug resistance: an epidemiological survey].
AB  == objective: to investigate the epidemiological features of the pathogens responsible for prostatitis in the changshu area, and offer some evidence for the clinical treatment of prostatitis. methods: this study included 2 306 cases of prostatitis that were all clinically confirmed and subjected to pathogenic examinations in 3 hospitals of changshu area from 2008 to 2012. neisseria gonorrhoeae, mycoplasma urealyticum and chlamydia trachomatis were detected by nucleic acid amplification abi 7500, the bacterial data analyzed by vitek-2 compact, the drug-resistance to antibacterial agents determined using the whonet  5.6 software, and the enumeration data processed by chi-square test and curvilinear regression analysis using spss 19.0. results: the main pathogens responsible for prostatitis were found to be staphylococcus haemolyticus (30%), staphylococcus epidermidis (12%), enterococcus faecalis (9%), escherichia coli (6%), staphylococcus warneri and staphylococcus aureus (3%), mycoplasma urealyticum (8%), chlamydia trachomatis (5%) and neisseria gonorrhoeae (6%). statistically significant increases were observed in the detection rates of escherichia coli (chi2 = 17.56, p<0.05), mycoplasma urealyticum (chi2 = 8.73, p<0.05), chlamydia trachomatis (chi2 = 8.73, p<0.05) and enterococcus (chi2 = 8.22, p<0.05), but not in other pathogens. the resistance rates of gram-positive  bacteria to erythromycin and benzylpenicillin g were both above 45%, but with no  significant difference between the two, those of oxacillin (chi2 = 10.06, p<0.05) and cefoxitin (chi2 = 9.89, p<0.05) were markedly increased, but those of quinolones, gentamycin and clindamycin remained low, except rifampicin (chi2 = 11.09, p<0.05). the resistance rates of gram-negative bacteria to cefazolin and ampicillin were relatively high (mean 57.3%), and those to ceftriaxone (chi2 = 11.26, p<0.05) and trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole (chi2 =11.00, p< 0.05) significantly high; those to amikacin, cefepime, piperacillin/tazobactam and imipenem remained at low levels with no significant changes. however, the resistance rates of mycoplasma urealyticum to ciprofloxacin (chi2 = 11.18, p<0.05) and azithromycin (chi2 = 9.89, p<0.05) were remarkably increased. conclusion: gram-positive bacteria are the major pathogens responsible for prostatitis, but escherichia coli, enterococcus and sexually transmitted disease  pathogens are found to be involved in recent years. quinolones and aminoglycosides are generally accepted as the main agents for the treatment of gram-positive bacterial infection. however, rational medication for prostatitis should be based on the results of pathogen isolation and drug sensitivity tests in a specific area.

AB  == objective: this study was designed to identify the presence, type and origin of bacteria adjacent to the metal implant in the infected region in a canine model of pyogenic vertebral osteomyelitis treated with single-stage anterior autogenous bone grafting and instrumentation. methods: dogs with pyogenic spondylodiscitis underwent one-stage debridement, autogenous bone grafting and titanium plate instrumentation and perioperative antibiotic therapy. the implants and adjacent vertebral bones were removed surgically at various postoperative time points (4,  8, 12 and 24 weeks) for bacteria detection. bacteria were detected from retrieved spinal implants as well as surrounding bones by culture and/or pyrosequencing methods in 17 (85%) of all 20 animals. the positive rate for bacteria presence was 45% by culture and 80% by pyrosequencing method. results: radiological or macroscopic examination showed no signs for infection recurrence in any animal regardless of bacteria presence at the surgical site. however, organism identical with the causative bacterium for spinal infection was found in only two of nine culture-positive animals. conclusion: within the confines of the study, the use of metallic implants in an infected area did not lead to a clinically relevant infection although bacteria may exist at the surgical site. the use of metallic implants in an infected area of the spine is safe. the metallic implants may not  be the "culprit" for the persistence or recurrence of infection.

TI  == a new plant-derived antibacterial is an inhibitor of efflux pumps in staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == an in-depth evaluation was undertaken of a new antibacterial natural product (1)  recently isolated and characterised from the plant hypericum olympicum l. cf. uniflorum. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined for a panel of bacteria, including: meticillin-resistant and -susceptible strains of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus haemolyticus; vancomycin-resistant and -susceptible enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium; penicillin-resistant and -susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae; group a streptococci (streptococcus pyogenes); and clostridium difficile. mics were 2-8 mg/l for most staphylococci and all enterococci, but were >/=16 mg/l for s. haemolyticus and were >32 mg/l for all species in the presence of blood. compound 1 was also tested against gram-negative bacteria, including escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium but was inactive. the mic for mycobacterium bovis bcg was 60  mg/l, and compound 1 inhibited the atp-dependent mycobacterium tuberculosis mure  ligase [50% inhibitory concentration (ic(50)) = 75 mum]. in a radiometric accumulation assay with a strain of s. aureus overexpressing the nora multidrug efflux pump, the presence of compound 1 increased accumulation of (14)c-enoxacin  in a concentration-dependent manner, implying inhibition of efflux. only moderate cytotoxicity was observed, with ic50 values of 12.5, 10.5 and 8.9 mum against human breast, lung and fibroblast cell lines, respectively, highlighting the potential value of this chemotype as a new antibacterial agent and efflux pump inhibitor.

AB  == the occurrence and antibiotic susceptibility profile of staphylococcus isolates of healthy farm animal origin in nkonkobe municipality as well as the prevalence  of putative antibiotic resistance genes were investigated using phenotypic and molecular methods. a total of 120 staphylococcus isolates were isolated from 150  animal samples and consisted of staphylococcus haemolyticus (30 %) and staphylococcus aureus (23.3 %) from pig, staphylococcus capitis (15 %) from goat, s. haemolyticus (5 %) and staphylococcus xylosus (15 %) from cattle, and other staphylococci (11.7 %) from dead chicken and pigs. besides this, the presence of  these isolates was observed from the animal dung, showing that the organisms are  shed to the environment. about 23.3 % of these isolates were coagulase-positive and 76.7 % were coagulase-negative staphylococcus. between 75 and 100 % of the isolates were resistant to penicillin g, tetracycline, sulfamethoxazole, and nalidixic acid; about 38 % were methicillin-resistant staphylococci, including 12.6 % methicillin-resistant s. aureus from pigs. in total, 12 % of all isolates  were vancomycin resistant. also, 12 % of the isolates were erythromycin resistant, while 40.2 % were resistant to ceftazidime. only the genes meca and mphc could be confirmed, whereas the genes vana, vanb, erma, ermb, and ermc could not be detected. the high phenotypic antibiotic resistance and the presence of some associated resistance genes is a potential threat to public health and suggest the animals to be important reservoirs of antibiotic resistance determinants in the environment.

TI  == r-thanatin inhibits growth and biofilm formation of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis in vivo and in vitro.
AB  == staphylococcus epidermidis is one of the most frequent causes of device-associated infections, because it is known to cause biofilms that grow on  catheters or other surgical implants. the persistent increasing resistance of s.  epidermidis and other coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons) has driven the need for newer antibacterial agents with innovative therapeutic strategies. thanatin is reported to display potent antibiotic activities, especially against extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase-producing escherichia coli. the present study aimed to investigate whether a shorter derivative peptide (r-thanatin) could be used as a novel antibacterial agent. we found that r-thanatin was highly potent in vitro against coagulase-negative staphylococci, such as s. epidermidis, s. haemolyticus, and s. hominis, and inhibited biofilm formation at subinhibitory concentrations. properties of little toxicity to human red blood cells (hrbcs) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells, a low incidence of resistance, and relatively high stability in plasma were confirmed. excellent in vivo protective  effects were also observed using a methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis (mrse)-induced urinary tract infection rat model. electron microscopy and confocal laser-scanning microscopy analyses suggested that r-thanatin disturbed cell division of mrse severely, which might be the reason for inhibition of mrse  growth. these findings indicate that r-thanatin is active against the growth and  biofilm formation of mrse in vitro and in vivo. r-thanatin might be considered as a specific drug candidate for treating cons infections.

AB  == aims: the aim of this study was to determine the biodiversity of the skin staphylococcal community from patients with atopic dermatitis (ad) and superantigen (sag) detection from staphylococcus aureus isolates. methods and results: in this study, we developed a novel multiplex pcr that allows the identification and discrimination of bacteria belonging to the staphylococcus genus both staph. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococcus - staph. capitis,  staph. epidermidis, staph. haemolyticus and staph. hominis isolated from the skin of patients with ad. in addition, a multiplex pcr assay that allows the rapid screening of the 19 genes that encode staphylococcal enterotoxins (ses), se-like  toxins and toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 was also performed and applied in staph.  aureus isolates. the microflora of the skin of patients with ad was dominated by  staph. aureus (69 isolates, 35.6%) followed by staph. epidermidis (59 isolates, 30.4%) species. the selm and seln genes were the most frequently detected in our  study (15 isolates, 71.4%), followed by seg and selo (14 isolates, 66.7%). conclusions: our molecular-based approach successfully identified the staphylococcal microflora that was relatively specific to patients with ad. considering skin colonization and expression of virulence factors, the staph. aureus may play a relevant role in ad pathophysiology. significance and impact of the study: this ability to classify disease-related microbial species provides new insights into the relevance of those microbes in human disorders.

TI  == occupational exposure of pharmaceutical workers to drug actives and excipients and their effect on staphylococcus spp. nasal carriage and antibiotic resistance.
AB  == background: pharmaceutical manufacturing workers are exposed to significant amounts of product ingredients, including antibiotics. such exposure could affect their nasal microflora. objective: to assess the effect of exposure to various unidentified pharmaceutical ingredients in cephalosporin-manufacturing and non-cephalosporin plants on the nasal carriage of staphylococcus spp. and their antibiotic resistance. methods: nasal swab samples were collected from 39 workers in both plants on three different occasions. staphylococci were isolated and identified to genus level. antibiotic resistance profiles were determined and subsequent identification to species level was performed. results: there was complete absence of s. aureus in the samples collected from workers in both facilities. multiple drug resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (mdr cons) prevalence rates were higher in the non-cephalosporin plant than in the cephalosporin plant, with resistance towards six classes of antibiotics. s. epidermidis was the prevalent species in the non-cephalosporin plant and s. haemolyticus prevailed in the cephalosporin-producing plant. conclusions: the observed prevalence of cons in both production plants was the same. however, exposure to intermittent non-cephalosporin pharmaceuticals results in higher prevalence of mdr cons compared to continuous exposure to cephalosporin.

TI  == [frequency distribution and antibiotic resistance of pathogens from the cerebrospinal fluid of 116 children with bacterial meningitis].
AB  == objective: to determine the frequency distribution and antibiotic resistance of pathogens isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid samples of children with bacterial meningitis (bm) and to provide a basis for the timely and effective treatment of childhood bm. methods: retrospective analysis was performed on pathogens isolated from 5097 cerebrospinal fluid samples collected from children  in kunming children's hospital between january 2008 and june 2012, as well as drug sensitivity test results. kirby-bauer antibiotic testing was used to analyze the sensitivity of these pathogens to commonly used antibiotics. results: a total of 116 pathogen strains were detected from the 5097 cerebrospinal fluid samples,  including 77 (66.4%) gram-positive strains, 30 (25.9%) gram-negative strains, and 9 (7.8%) fungal strains, with a positive rate of 2.28%. the six most frequently isolated pathogens were staphylococcus epidermidis (32 strains, 27.6%), streptococcus pneumoniae (15 strains, 12.9%), escherichia coli (15 strains, 12.9%), staphylococcus haemolyticus (9 strains, 7.8%), cryptococcus neoformans (8 strains, 6.9%) and staphylococcus aureus (6 strains, 5.2%). coagulase-negative staphylococci was the predominant pathogen in neonates and young infants with bm, and its sensitivity rates to penicillin, erythromycin and clindamycin were lower  than 40%. streptococcus pneumoniae had a penicillin sensitivity rate of 13.4%, while sensitivity rates to erythromycin and clindamycin reached 60.0%. no staphylococcus and streptococcus pneumoniae pathogens resistant to vancomycin were found. gram-negative bacilli had relatively high sensitivity rates to imipenem, meropenem, cefoperazone/sulbactam and cefepime. conclusions: gram-positive cocci are the predominant pathogens for childhood bm over the past  five years. the detected pathogens develop high resistance to commonly used antibiotics. to prevent misdiagnosis, careful attention should be paid to bm caused by cryptococcus neoformans.

TI  == patient nostril microbial flora: individual-dependency and diversity precluding prediction of staphylococcus aureus acquisition.
AB  == the potential role of a patient's resident microbial flora in the risk of acquiring multiresistant bacteria (mrb) during hospitalization is unclear. we investigated this role by cross-sectional study of 103 patients at risk of acquisition of staphylococcus aureus (sa), resistant (mrsa) or not (mssa) to methicillin, recruited in four french hospitals. the flora was analysed by an exhaustive culture-based approach combined with molecular and/or mass-spectrometry-based identification, and sa strain typing. forty-three of the  53 sa-negative patients at entry were followed for up to 52 weeks: 19 (44.2%) remained negative for sa and 24 (55.8%) became positive, including 19 (79%) who acquired an mssa, four (17%) who acquired an mrsa and one who acquired both (4%). fifty-one different species were identified among the 103 patients, of which two, corynebacterium accolens and staphylococcus haemolyticus (p = 0.02-0.01), were more prevalent in the absence of sa. however, the same number of patients carrying or not these two species acquired an mssa/mrsa during follow-up, regardless of antibiotic treatment received. clustering analysis showed that the  microbial flora was highly specific to each patient, and not predictive for acquisition of mssa/mrsa or not. patient-specific microbial resident flora is not predictive of sa acquisition.

TI  == reactive oxygen species and the bacteriostatic and bactericidal effects of isoconazole nitrate.
AB  == bacterial superinfections often occur in dermatomycoses, resulting in greatly inflamed or eczematous skin. the objective of this study was to evaluate the antibacterial efficacy of isoconazole nitrate (isn), a broad-spectrum antimicrobial imidazole, commonly used to treat dermatomycoses. several gram-positive bacteria minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) for isn (isn solution or isn-containing creams: travogen or corticosteroid-containing travocort) and ampicillin were obtained using the broth-dilution method. speed of onset of the bactericidal effect was determined with bacterial killing curves. reactive oxygen species (ros) were visualised by staining cells with singlet oxygen detector stain. compared with ampicillin mics, isn mics for bacillus cereus, staphylococcus haemolyticus and staphylococcus hominis were lower and isn mics for corynebacterium tuberculostearicum and streptococcus salivarius were similar. incubation with isn led to a 50% kill rate for staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant strains (mrsa). post-isn incubation, 36% (30 min) and 90% (60 min) of s. aureus cells were positive for ros. isoconazole nitrate has a broad bacteriostatic and bactericidal action, also against a mrsa strain that was not reduced by the corticosteroid in the travocort cream. data suggest that the antibacterial effect of isn may be ros dependent. an antifungal agent with robust antibacterial activity can provide a therapeutic advantage in treating dermatomycoses with suspected bacterial superinfections.

TI  == hydramacin-1 in action: scrutinizing the barnacle model.
AB  == hydramacin-1 (hm1) from the metazoan hydra exerts antimicrobial activity against  a wide range of bacterial strains. notably, hm1 induces the aggregation of bacterial cells, accompanied by precipitation. to date, the proposed mechanism of peptide-lipid interaction, termed the barnacle model, has not been described on the molecular level. here, we show by biochemical and biophysical techniques that the lipid-peptide interactions of hm1 are initiated by electrostatic and hydrophobic effects, in particular, by tryptophan and neighboring polar amino acid residues that cause an interfacial localization of the peptide between two self-contained lipid bilayers. the high binding constants of hm1 upon lipid interaction are in the range of other potent antimicrobial peptides, e.g., magainin, and can be reasonably explained by two distinct epitopes on the surface of the peptide's global structure, which both contain swt(k/r) motifs. the residues of this motif favor localization of the peptide in the head group region of phospholipid bilayers up to a penetration depth of 4 a and a minor participation of the lipids' hydrocarbon regions. our results expand the knowledge about the molecular modes of action antimicrobial peptides use to tackle their target cells. furthermore, the aggregation of living bacteria by hm1 was observed for a broad range of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. therefore, the detailed view of peptide-lipid interactions described by the barnacle model consolidates it among the established models.

TI  == microbiological diagnosis and antibiotic therapy in patients with community-acquired pneumonia and acute copd exacerbation in daily clinical practice: comparison to current guidelines.
AB  == background: the aim of this secondary analysis was to evaluate current microbiological approaches, microbiology, and antibiotic therapy in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (cap) and acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive  pulmonary disease (aecopd) in clinical practice and to compare them with current  international guidelines. methods: a total of 362 patients with suspected cap were enrolled in 14 european centers in a prospective multicenter study. results: a total of 279 inpatients (cap, n = 222; aecopd, n = 57) were evaluated. a total  of 83 (37 %) cap patients and 25 (44 %) aecopd patients did not undergo any microbiological tests. in patients with cap/aecopd, blood culture was performed in 109 (49 %)/16 (28.1 %), urinary antigen tests for legionella pneumophila in 67 (30 %)/9 (16 %), and sputum investigation in 55 (25 %)/17 (30 %), respectively. the most frequent pathogens in cap were streptococcus pneumoniae, mycoplasma pneumoniae, chlamydia pneumoniae, l. pneumophila, staphylococcus aureus, and enterobacter cloacae; in aecopd they were escherichia coli, haemophilus haemolyticus, haemophilus influenzae, and moraxella catarrhalis. all cap patients (mean = 11.1 days) and 35 (61.4 %) of aecopd patients (mean = 8.9 days) received  antibiotics. cap patients were given mostly aminopenicillin with beta-lactamase inhibitors and aecopd patients were given mostly cephalosporins. conclusions: pathogens isolated in cap and aecopd and the antibiotic therapy used are in good  accordance with the guidelines. blood culture, recommended for all cap patients,  was performed in only 50 % of the cases and antibiotic therapy lasted longer than the suggested 5-7 days. therefore, international guidelines regarding performance of blood culture and duration of antibiotic therapy should be adopted more often. this duration was independent of the number of isolated pathogens and number of symptoms on admission. therefore, the question arises as to whether microbiological data are necessary only for patients who are resistant to initial therapy.

TI  == an international activity and spectrum analysis of linezolid: zaaps program results for 2011.
AB  == through a continuing resistance surveillance monitoring program, linezolid was shown to maintain its spectrum and potency against a collection of 8059 clinically relevant gram-positive strains collected from patients at 79 medical centers in 33 countries and hong kong. linezolid mic90 values were 2 mug/ml for methicillin-resistant and -susceptible staphylococcus aureus and enterococci, and the mic90 value was 1 mug/ml for coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons), beta-hemolytic streptococci, streptococcus pneumoniae, and viridans group streptococci. reference broth microdilution susceptibility testing for linezolid  demonstrated a 99.83% susceptibility rate for all organisms. all s. aureus were inhibited by </=2 mug/ml. three (0.3%) of 928 strains of cons had a linezolid mic of 4 mug/ml and contained the cfr resistance gene; 1 also had a mutation in l3. there were 14 linezolid-resistant strains detected from 7 countries (brazil [5],  france [1], germany [2] greece [2], italy [2], ireland [1], and spain [1]) representing 5 species (e. faecium, s. capitis, s. epidermidis, s. hominis, s. lugdenensis). a mobile cfr gene was noted in 2 species having elevated linezolid  mic values; one was a s. haemolyticus isolate with a mic at 4 mug/ml. resistance  rates were as follows for the 6 groups of organisms sampled in the 2011 zaaps program: cons, 1.2%; enterococci, 0.39%; among s aureus, s. pneumoniae, viridans  group streptococci, and beta-hemolytic streptococci, no resistance was detected.  as the activities of commonly used antimicrobials continue to be compromised by evolving resistance mechanisms in gram-positive pathogens, linezolid-resistant strains remain uncommon and without increasing occurrence.

TI  == enterotoxin-encoding genes in staphylococcus spp. from bulk goat milk.
AB  == although staphylococcus aureus has been implicated as the main staphylococcus species causing human food poisoning, recent studies have shown that coagulase-negative staphylococcus could also harbor enterotoxin-encoding genes. such organisms are often present in goat milk and are the most important mastitis-causing agents. therefore, this study aimed to investigate the occurrence of enterotoxin-encoding genes among coagulase-positive (cops) and coagulase-negative (cons) staphylococci isolated from raw goat milk produced in the semi-arid region of paraiba, the most important region for goat milk production in brazil. enterotoxin-encoding genes were screened in 74 staphylococci isolates (30 cops and 44 cons) by polymerase chain reaction targeting the genes sea, seb, sec, sed, see, seg, seh, and sei. enterotoxin-encoding genes were found in nine (12.2%) isolates, and four different genes (sea, sec, seg, and sei) were identified amongst the isolates. the most frequent genes were seg and sei, which were often found simultaneously in 44.5% of the isolates. the gene sec was the most frequent among the classical  genes, and sea was found only in one isolate. all cops isolates (n=7) harboring enterotoxigenic genes were identified as s. aureus. the two coagulase-negative isolates were s. haemolyticus and s. hominis subsp. hominis and they harbored sei and sec genes, respectively. a higher frequency of enterotoxin-encoding genes was observed amongst cops (23.3%) than cons (4.5%) isolates (p<0.05), reinforcing the importance of s. aureus as a potential foodborne agent. however, the potential risk posed by cons in goat milk should not be ignored because it has a higher occurrence in goat milk and enterotoxin-encoding genes were detected in some isolates.

TI  == microbiology of the gut of the kola nut weevil, balanogastris kolae.
AB  == reports have shown that many insects have microbes in their gut system. gut microbes are very important for insect vitality and much of their nutrition is derived from products of microbial metabolism. the habitat of balanogastris kolae (desbrocher des loges) (coleoptera: curculionidae) suggests that they possess the ability to digest varieties of sugars particularly starch and protein materials present in the kola nut, cola nitida schott & endlicher (malvales: malvaceae). the aim of this study was to characterize the gut bacterial communities of the kola weevil, b. kolae. to ascertain this, the gut bacterial community of a kola nut-feeding weevil, b. kolae was characterized using culture-dependent methods. the bacterial counts in the foregut, midgut and hindgut were 7.14 +/- 0.11 x 10(6)cfu ml(-1), 2.68 +/- 0.13 x 10(7) cfu ml(-1) and 1.43 +/- 0.20 x 10(6) cfu ml(-1) respectively. there were no significant differences in the total bacterial count of the foregut, midgut and hindgut. the bacterial species were identified to be fusobacterium nucleatum, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, corynebacterium fascians, arthrobacter globiformis, serratia marcescens, bacillus brevis, vibrio haemolyticus and flavobacterium breve. the majority of these isolates were demonstrated to have both proteolytic and amylolytic activities.

TI  == genetic characterization of antimicrobial resistance in coagulase-negative staphylococci from bovine mastitis milk.
AB  == coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns; n=417) were isolated from bovine milk and  identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. nineteen different species were identified, and staphylococcus xylosus, staphylococcus chromogenes, staphylococcus haemolyticus, and staphylococcus sciuri were the most prevalent species. resistance to oxacillin (47.0% of the isolates), fusidic acid (33.8%), tiamulin (31.9%), penicillin (23.3%), tetracycline (15.8%), streptomycin (9.6%), erythromycin (7.0%), sulfonamides (5%), trimethoprim (4.3%), clindamycin (3.4%), kanamycin (2.4%), and gentamicin (2.4%) was detected. resistance to oxacillin was attributed to the meca gene in 9.7% of the oxacillin-resistant isolates. the remaining oxacillin-resistant cns did not contain the mecc gene or meca1 promoter mutations. the meca gene was detected in staphylococcus fleurettii, staphylococcus epidermidis, staph. haemolyticus, and staph. xylosus. resistance to tetracycline was attributed to the presence of tet(k) and tet(l), penicillin resistance to blaz, streptomycin resistance to str and ant(6)-ia, and erythromycin resistance to erm(c), erm(b), and msr. resistance to tiamulin and fusidic acid could not be attributed to an acquired resistance gene. in total, 15.1% of the cns isolates were multidrug resistant (i.e., resistant to 2 or more  antimicrobials). the remaining cns isolates were susceptible to antimicrobials commonly used in mastitis treatment. methicillin-resistant cns isolates were diverse, as determined by meca gene sequence analysis, staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec typing, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. arginine catabolic mobile element types 1 and 3 were detected in both methicillin-resistant and methicillin-susceptible staph. epidermidis and were associated with sequence types st59 and st111. because this study revealed the presence of multidrug-resistant cns in a heterogeneous cns population, we recommend antibiogram analysis of cns in persistent infections before treatment with antimicrobials.

TI  == prevalence of methicillin-resistant staphylococci species isolated from computer  keyboards located in secondary and postsecondary schools.
AB  == methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) is a public health threat within the general community, thereby warranting identification of mrsa reservoirs within the community. computer terminals in schools were sampled for s. aureus and methicillin-resistant staphylococci. the overall prevalence of mrsa on computer keyboards was low: 0.68% for a postsecondary institution and 2% and 0% for two secondary institutes. the mrsa isolate from the postsecondary institution did not correspond to the canadian epidemic clusters, but is related  to the usa 700 cluster, which contains strains implicated in outbreaks within the u.s. the isolate from the secondary institute's keyboard was typed as cmrsa7 (usa 400), a strain that has been implicated in both canadian and u.s. epidemics. methicillin-resistant s. haemolyticus and s. epidermidis were also isolated from  keyboards, indicating that a mixed community of methicillin-resistant staphylococci can be present on keyboards. although the prevalence was low, the presence of mrsa combined with the high volume of traffic on these student computer terminals demonstrates the potential for public-access computer terminals and computer rooms at educational institutes to act as reservoirs.

TI  == surveillance and evidence of contamination in hospital environment from meticillin and vancomycin-resistant microbial agents.
AB  == introduction: direct contact is undoubtedly the main means of transmission of hospital infections. an investigative study was therefore conducted to assess workplace surfaces at risk from microbial contamination. methods: the study was conducted using swabs and contact slides placed on the palms of healthcare workers during their routine patient care and on workplace surfaces (e.g. telephones, computers, medication trolleys, taps) in treatment rooms, operating theatres and wards. disposable swabs were used for rapid screening and read with  a bioluminometer. at the same time, a sample was taken from those testing positive using a contact slide. the samples testing positive for staphylococci underwent identification to assess resistance to meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrs/mrsa) and to vancomycin (visa/vrsa). results: meticillin-resistant staphylococcus strains were found on 14.7% (20/136) of samples taken from the hands of workers and 35.7% (15/42) of those from hospital  surfaces. an even higher resistance to meticillin and/or vancomycin than that found for s. aureus was identified in nosocomial strains of coagulase negative staphylococci, including s. epidermidis and s. haemolyticus. conclusion: the study concludes that there is thus a need for greater care in complying with procedures designed and support for surveillance to reduce the risk of infection.

TI  == improving linezolid use decreases the incidence of resistance among gram-positive microorganisms.
AB  == surveillance studies have shown the emergence of infections with linezolid-resistant bacteria. the relationship between appropriate linezolid use  and the spread of linezolid resistance among gram-positive microorganisms in a single tertiary referral centre was evaluated. in an initial observational study, a prospective prescription-indication study was conducted on intensive care areas and haematology, neurosurgery, vascular surgery and nephrology wards during 2009. an intervention through follow-up feedback on audit results from may-june 2010 was then conducted. from july-december 2010, a second drug-use study of linezolid was conducted, with the same objectives and methodology. to assess the antimicrobial pressure of linezolid, an ecological study was conducted from 2006-2010 in the same hospital wards. indications for linezolid in the initial study were considered suitable in 38.5% of cases, whilst in the second study the  rate was 51.2% (33% increase). linezolid consumption fell by 57% in the second half of 2010. a significant correlation was found between its inadequate use (ddd/1000 patient-days) and the incidence of linezolid-resistant strains/1000 patient-days (r=0.93; p=6.9e-024); 85% of the variability in the incidence of linezolid resistance was predicted by its inadequate use. its partial correlations were significant for enterococcus faecium (r=0.407; p=0.049), staphylococcus epidermidis (r=0.874; p=2.3e-008) and staphylococcus haemolyticus  (r=0.406; p=0.049) but not staphylococcus aureus (r=0.051; p=0.704). a relationship was found between appropriate linezolid use and the incidence of linezolid-resistant strains of e. faecium, s. epidermidis and s. haemolyticus.

TI  == what distinguishes highly pathogenic staphylococci from medium- and non-pathogenic?
AB  == members of the genus staphylococcus are widespread as commensals of humans and animals where they colonize the skin or mucous membranes. while this coexistence  remains mostly untroubled, especially for the healthy host, the bacteria may pose a serious threat for the human or animal host when they get access to inner layers of the body through breaches in skin or membranes. among the members of the genus a wide span exists in the ability to cope with the hostile conditions encountered in the bloodstream of the living host as a scarce supply of certain nutrients, attacks of the immune system, or anti-infective measures undertaken in the clinical field. in this respect, staphylococcus aureus is by far the most versatile species of the genus. its equipment with a huge repertoire of different virulence factors and additional supportive gene products that increase the capability to survive within the living host makes s. aureus the leading pathogen not only within the genus but also one of the most threatening microorganisms regarding hospitally and community-acquired infections. compared with s. aureus,  the other virulent species of the genus like s. epidermidis, s. lugdunensis, s. saprophyticus, and s. haemolyticus have a more limited arsenal of virulence factors resulting in a specialized spectrum of diseases and a generally lower degree of pathogenicity. besides the highly and medium-pathogenic staphylococci,  the genus comprises also species like s. carnosus, s. xylosus, and s. equorum that are generally inconspicuous regarding clinical occurrences. some strains of  this group are used in the food industry and can be graded as non-pathogenic. this review aims to work out the differences between the pathogenic properties of highly and medium-pathogenic staphylococcal species and to draw a comparison between the pathogenic species and the food-grade s. carnosus tm300.

TI  == [atypical agents of wound infection and targeted samples].
AB  == all open wounds are primarily contaminated and subsequently colonized by microorganisms, predominantly bacteria. only about 30% of chronic wounds are also infected. factors which favor the development of infection are the following: large quantity of bacteria, presence of virulence factors, their quantity and number, predominantly the synergy of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, and formation of biofilm. common agents of infection of acute and chronic wounds are  staphylococcus aureus, mrsa, streptococcus beta-haemolyticus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacteroides spp., and candida albicans. difference between acute and  chronic wound is in the predominance of individual agents, with an observation that staphylococcus aureus is predominant in both cases. atypical agents of chronic wound infection are rare, unusual, not found in the area in which we live, not proven by standard microbiological methods, but molecular methods are needed instead. they are predominantly opportunists, varying in the expression of virulence factors, or they have changed their phenotype characteristics and are not the agents of primary wound infections. they are the agents of secondary infections. atypical agents of the chronic wound infection are diverse, from the  anaerobe group, peptoniphilus spp., anaerococcus spp., bacteroides ureolyticus, finegoldia magma, the group of gram positive rods of the corynebacterium genus, the group of bacteria from aquatic environment mycobacterium fortuitum complex, and vibrio alginolyticus. the targeted samples are biopsy sample as the "gold standard" and/or aspirate, when a significant quantity of exudate is present. targeted samples are obligatory when there is a progression and decomposition of  the base of the wound, increase in the size or depth of the wound, isolation of multiresistant microbes, or absence of clinical response to empirical antimicrobial therapy. in the diagnosis of opportunistic pathogens or atypical agents of chronic wound infection, it is necessary to be thorough, meticulous, and conduct revision of the patient, diagnosis, treatment and samples. crucial for the detection of the agents atypical wound infection is discussion and agreement with clinical microbiologist. essential for the quality diagnosis is decontamination of the wound before taking targeted samples. the targeted sample  is biopsy specimen as the "gold standard", less frequently aspirate, depending on the quantity and content of the wound. swab as a sample is not recommended. if there is no other choice, only exceptionally surface swabs may be taken, but only under the following conditions: decontamination of the wound with the application of levine's or z-technique of taking of swabs.

TI  == characterization of methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococci in the clinical setting: a multicentre study in nigeria.
AB  == background: the staphylococci are implicated in a variety of human infections; however, many clinical microbiology laboratories in nigeria do not identify staphylococci (in particular coagulase negative staphylococci - cns) to the species level. moreover, data from multi-centre assessment on antibiotic resistance and epidemiology of the staphylococci are not available in nigeria. this study investigated 91 non-duplicate staphylococcal isolates obtained from the microbiology laboratories of eight hospitals in nigeria during the period january to april 2010. methods: identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed using the vitek 2 system, detection of resistance genes by  pcr, and molecular characterization was determined by sccmec typing, spa and multilocus sequence typing (mlst). results: all the isolates were susceptible to  mupirocin, tigecycline, vancomycin and linezolid, but 72.5% of cns and 82.3% of staphylococcus aureus were resistant to cotrimoxazole, while multiresistance was  observed in 37 of the 40 cns isolates. untypeable sccmec types (ccrc/class a mec  and ccr-negative/class c2 mec gene complex) in two methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) were identified. additionally, ccr-negative/class a mec and ccr type 4/class c2 mec gene complex was detected in one isolate each of s. sciuri and s. haemolyticus, respectively. the s. aureus isolates were classified into 21 spa types including two new types (t8987, t9008) among the methicillin-susceptible s. aureus (mssa) isolates. two (cc8-sccmecnon-typeable and cc88-sccmec iv) and four (cc8-sccmec iii/iv/v; cc30-sccmec ii/iii; cc88-sccmec iv; and st152-sccmecnon-typeable) mrsa clones were identified in maiduguri (north-east nigeria) and south-west nigeria, respectively. the proportion of panton-valentine leukocidin (pvl)-positive mssa was high (44.4%) and 56.3% of these strains were associated with sequence type (st) 152. conclusions: the identification of multiresistant meca positive s. haemolyticus and s. sciuri from clinical samples indicates that characterization of cns is important in providing information on their diversity and importance in nigeria.  there is the need to develop new sccmec classification methods for non-typeable methicillin-resistant staphylococci, and to curtail the spread and establishment  of the s. aureus st152 clone in nigeria. the study presents the first report of a pvl-positive st152-sccmecnontypeable mrsa and sccmec typing of methicillin-resistant cns in nigeria.

TI  == antibacterial activity of selected metabolites from chilean lichen species against methicillin-resistant staphylococci.
AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activities of eight compounds isolated from lichens, collected in several southern regions of chile (including antarctica), were evaluated against methicillin-resistant clinical isolates strains of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus haemolyticus and staphylococcus warneri. the minimum inhibitory concentrations, calculated in microdilution, were ranging  from 8 microg ml(-1) for sphaerophorin to 1024 microg ml(-1) for fumarprotocetraric acid. these findings suggest, however, that the natural compounds from lichens are good candidates for the individuation of novel templates for the development of new antimicrobial agents or combinations of drugs for chemotherapy.

TI  == staphylococcus haemolyticus prophage phish2 endolysin relies on cysteine, histidine-dependent amidohydrolases/peptidases activity for lysis 'from without'.
AB  == staphylococcus aureus is an important pathogen, with methicillin-resistant (mrsa) and multi-drug resistant strains becoming increasingly prevalent in both human and veterinary clinics. s. aureus causing bovine mastitis yields high annual losses to the dairy industry. conventional treatment of mastitis by broad range antibiotics is often not successful and may contribute to development of antibiotic resistance. bacteriophage endolysins present a promising new source of antimicrobials. the endolysin of prophage phish2 of staphylococcus haemolyticus strain jcsc1435 (phish2 lysin) is a peptidoglycan hydrolase consisting of two catalytic domains (chap and amidase) and an sh3b cell wall binding domain. in this work, we demonstrated its lytic activity against live staphylococcal cells and investigated the contribution of each functional module to bacterial lysis by testing a series of deletion constructs in zymograms and turbidity reduction assays. the chap domain exhibited three-fold higher activity than the full length protein and optimum activity in physiological saline. this activity was further enhanced by the presence of bivalent calcium ions. the sh3b domain was shown to be required for full activity of the complete phish2 lysin. the full length enzyme and the chap domain showed activity against multiple staphylococcal strains, including mrsa strains, mastitis isolates, and cons.

TI  == comparative study of nasal bacterial carriage in pediatric patients from two different geographical regions.
AB  == the aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of bacterial carriage in the anterior nares of two different patient cohorts, aged 5-15 years. by use of a sensitive enrichment broth, gram-positive and -negative bacteria were cultured from the two cohorts of each 100 patients at the referral clinic in eritrea and at a german university hospital. in the german cohort, 27% of the patients were positive either for gram-negative (n=5) or -positive bacteria, including staphylococcus aureus (n=8; mrsa (n=2)), staphylococcus epidermidis (n=12), corynebacterium spp. (n=4), and streptococcus pyogenes (n=1). in comparison, the  eritrean cohort revealed 33% bacterial carriers in the anterior nares. among the  identified species were s. aureus (n=2), s. epidermidis (n=13), streptococcus haemolyticus (n=9), and gram-negative rods including klebsiella pneumoniae/oxytoca (n=5), enterobacter agglomerans (n=4), escherichia coli (n=2), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=1). noteworthy, none of the eritrean patients were  positive for mrsa. in both cohorts there was no co-occurrence of gram-positive and -negative bacteria in the anterior nares. however, we observed in two subjects of the eritrean cohort co-colonization with s. epidermidis and s. haemolyticus. the occurrence of gram-negative bacteria was less significant by age in the german cohort, whereas in the eritrean cohort gram-negative bacteria were more frequently detected in carriers aged 5-9 years. continued surveillance  of s. aureus and gram-negative bacteria carriage deserves further attention and might help to determine future trends in the characteristics of nasal carriage, subsequent incidence of infections, and the potential effectiveness of targeted population based intervention.

TI  == linezolid-resistant clinical isolates of meticillin-resistant coagulase-negative  staphylococci and enterococcus faecium from china.
AB  == seventeen meticillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (mrcons), including ten staphylococcus capitis, four staphylococcus cohnii, two staphylococcus haemolyticus and one staphylococcus sciuri, and an enterococcus faecium isolate with various levels of linezolid resistance were isolated from intensive care units in a chinese hospital. pfge indicated that the four s. cohnii isolates belonged to a clonal strain, and that nine of the s. capitis isolates were indistinguishable (clone a1) and the other one was closely related  (clone a2). a g2576t mutation was identified in domain v of the 23s rrna gene in  the e. faecium isolate. besides the g2576t mutation, a novel c2104t mutation was  detected in the nine clone a1 s. capitis isolates. the cfr gene was detected in all the staphylococci except an s. sciuri isolate, whose 23s rrna gene contained  the g2576t mutation. there was a clonal dissemination of linezolid-resistant mrcons in intensive care units of our hospital, and this is the first report, to  our knowledge, of linezolid-resistant staphylococci and enterococci in china.

TI  == rapid microarray-based identification of different meca alleles in staphylococci.
AB  == to screen isolates and to identify meca alleles, published meca sequences were analyzed, and a microarray for the rapid discrimination of meca alleles was designed. a genbank analysis yielded 135 full-length gene sequences annotated as  meca. these sequences clustered into 32 different alleles corresponding to 28 unique amino acid sequences and to 15 distinct hybridization patterns on this microarray. a collection of 78 clinical and veterinary isolates of staphylococcus spp. was characterized using this assay. nine of the 15 expected patterns, as well as one as-yet-unknown pattern, were identified. these patterns were detected in various epidemic methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus strains, in s. pseudintermedius, and in coagulase-negative species such as s. epidermidis, s. fleurettii, or s. haemolyticus. there was no correlation between the different meca hybridization patterns and the sccmec type. determination of mics showed that meca alleles corresponding to only four of these nine patterns were associated with beta-lactam resistance. the meca alleles that did not confer beta-lactam resistance were largely restricted to coagulase-negative staphylococci of animal origin, such as s. sciuri and s. vitulinus. because of the diversity of sequences and the different impact on beta-lactam susceptibility, the existence of different meca alleles needs to be taken into account when designing diagnostic assays for the detection of meca.

TI  == application of the antibiotic batumin for accurate and rapid identification of staphylococcal small colony variants.
AB  == background: staphylococcus aureus is a major human pathogen causing significant morbidity and mortality. the s. aureus colonies in osteomyelitis, in patients with cystic fibrosis and patients with endoprosthesis rejection frequently have an atypical morphology, i.e. staphylococcal small-colony variants, which form a naturally occurring subpopulation of clinically important staphylococci. identification of these small colony variants is difficult, because of the loss of typical phenotypic characteristics of these variants.we wanted to improve and  simplify the diagnosis of staphylococcal infection using a diagnostic preparation, consisting of 5 mug batumin paper disks. batumin possesses a unique  selective activity against all studied staphylococcus spp., whereas all other species tested thus far are batumin resistant. we assessed the efficacy of the batumin diagnostic preparation to identify staphylococcal small colony variants,  isolated from osteomyelitis patients. findings: with the batumin diagnostic preparation, all 30 tested staphylococcal small-colony variants had a growth inhibition zone around the disk of minimum 25 mm, accordant with the inhibition zones of the parent strains, isolated from the same patients. conclusions: the batumin diagnostic preparation correctly identified the small-colony variants of  s. aureus, s. haemolyticus and s. epidermidis as belonging to the genus staphylococcus, which differ profoundly from parental strains and are difficult to identify with standard methods. identification of staphylococcal small-colony  variants with the batumin diagnostic preparation is technically simple and can facilitate practical laboratory work.

TI  == a novel resistance mechanism to triclosan that suggests horizontal gene transfer  and demonstrates a potential selective pressure for reduced biocide susceptibility in clinical strains of staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == the widely used biocide triclosan selectively targets fabi, the nadh-dependent trans-2-enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase, which is an important target for narrow-spectrum antimicrobial drug development. in relation to the growing concern about biocide resistance, we compared in vitro mutants and clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus with reduced triclosan susceptibility. clinical isolates of s. aureus as well as laboratory-generated mutants were assayed for minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) phenotypes and genotypes related to reduced triclosan susceptibility. a potential epidemiological cut-off (ecoff) mbc of >4 mg/l was observed for triclosan in clinical isolates of s. aureus. these showed significantly lower mics and higher mbcs than laboratory mutants. these groups of strains also had few similarities in the triclosan resistance mechanism. molecular analysis identified novel resistance mechanisms linked to the presence of an additional sh-fabi allele derived from staphylococcus haemolyticus. the lack of predictive value of in-vitro-selected mutations for clinical isolates indicates that laboratory tests in the present form appear to be of limited value. more importantly, detection of sh-fabi as a novel resistance mechanism with high potential for horizontal gene transfer demonstrates for the first time that a biocide could exert a selective pressure able to drive the spread of a resistance determinant in a human pathogen.

TI  == misidentification of vancomycin-resistant staphylococcus aureus as coagulase-negative staphylococcus.
AB  == reduced vancomycin susceptibility in staphylococcus aureus in many cases appears  to be associated with changes in biological characteristics, including reduced coagulase activity, cell wall thickening, slow growth, smaller colonies, decreased pigment formation and less or no haemolysis. whether these changes affect identification by routine methods has not been reported. in this study, 24 vancomycin-susceptibility-reduced coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons) strains (including 22 staphylococcus haemolyticus strains and two staphylococcus epidermidis strains) were retested by pcr-based detection of staphylococcus aureus-specific genes (nuc, coa and 16s rrna). the results showed that six isolates identified by conventional biochemical tests as s. haemolyticus contained nuc, coa and 16s rrna genes. these six strains were serial-passaged daily on nutrient agar without vancomycin supplementation, and vancomycin-susceptible revertants were obtained after 15 continuous passages. revertant isolates were coagulase-positive and were identified as s. aureus by automated testing methods. this suggests that biochemical changes in s. aureus strains with reduced vancomycin susceptibility should be highlighted and that the detection of these strains requires more attention and improved techniques.

TI  == intestinal staphylococcus spp. and virulent features associated with coeliac disease.
AB  == aim: to determine whether intestinal staphylococcus spp. and their pathogenic features differed between coeliac disease (cd) patients and healthy controls. methods: 60 children, including active cd (n=20) and non-active cd (n=20) patients and healthy controls (n=20), were studied. staphylococci were isolated from faeces and identified by pcr and dna sequencing. the carriage of virulent genes, including adhesion (atle and fbe), cell aggregation (icad), global regulatory (agr and sar) and methicillin-resistant (meca) genes, was analysed by  pcr. results: staphylococcus epidermidis was more abundant in the microbiota of active and non-active cd patients than in controls. staphylococcus haemolyticus was more abundant in active cd patients than in control subjects. staphylococcus  aureus was less abundant in active cd patients than in the other child groups. staphylococcus spp. diversity was higher in active cd patients than in non-active cd patients and controls. the presence of the meca gene and the simultaneous presence of both the meca and atle genes were higher in s. epidermidis clones isolated from cd patients, with active and non-active disease, than in those from control subjects. the individual presence of the other virulent genes was lower in s. epidermidis from active cd patients than in those from the other -child- groups. conclusions: increased abundance of s. epidermidis carrying the meca gene, in active and non-active cd patients, most likely reflects increased exposure of these subjects to opportunistic pathogens and antimicrobials.

TI  == methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa): an interim report of carriage and conversion rates in nursing students.
AB  == objective: to evaluate and characterize mrsa and staphylococci carriage and conversion rates in nursing students across clinical semester rotations and to describe risk factors. design: a prospective, longitudinal cohort design (interim report) with three times of measurement. data collected between august 2010 and may 2011 (ongoing longitudinal study to may 2012). institutional review board approval (2010f5693). setting: texas state university, san marcos, tx. participants: eighty-seven nursing students. interventions: a positive mrsa swab  represented an end-point for a participant. intervention offered was bactroban (mupirocin) for nasal decolonization and an oral antibiotic, doxycycline; posttreatment collection to verify decolonization prior to next clinical rotation. main outcome measures: screening for staphylococcus aureus and mrsa identification; confirmation and antibiotic susceptibility by vitek 2. self-administered questionnaires collected demographics and risk factors. generalized estimating equations calculated population-averaged panel logistic regression models allowing for an ar(1) error by stata version 12. results: mrsa  colonization did not increase. s. aureus prevalence (20-26%). species prevalence  other than s. aureus increased (9.2% to 80%). the following associations were found to be statistically significant: boil or skin infection odds with s. aureus (or = 2.43, p < .05), working or volunteering in healthcare facility odds with s. other (or = 2.72, p < .05) and gym and sports activities odds with s. other (or = 4.98, p < .001). conclusions: mrsa colonization did not increase. knowledge and understanding of mrsa (risks) may play a role in compliance and barrier precautions. s. aureus colonization remained stable (25-30%). species colonization other than s. aureus (e.g. s. epidermis, s. haemolyticus) increased  to significant levels.

AB  == the development of reduced vancomycin susceptibility in staphylococcus aureus in  many cases appears to be associated with characteristic changes. these changes may have pitfall of identifying s. aureus by automated testing methods like vitek 32. in this study, we retested 24 heterogeneous vancomycin-intermediate staphylococcus haemolyticus (h-vish) collected in 2008-2010 at the department of  clinical microbiology by conventional biochemical tests and polymerase chain reaction (pcr). the heterogeneous vancomycin-intermediate s. aureus (hvisa) reversion test and electron microscopic examination were also used. six isolates  of 24 h-vish possessed nuc, coa, and 16s rrna genes, and could be reversed into s. aureus. it suggested that biochemical and morphological changes in hvisa and vancomycin-intermediate s. aureus (visa) should be considered, and the detection  of s. aureus, especially reduced vancomycin susceptibility isolates, requires more attention and different techniques.

TI  == uvc-irradiation sublethal stress does not alter antibiotic susceptibility of staphylococci (mrsa, mssa, and coagulase-negative staphylococci) to beta-lactam,  macrolide, and fluoroquinolone antibiotic agents.
AB  == skin tanning, either by exposure to natural sunlight or through use of uv sunbeds, has become a popular practice in the us, where it is estimated that approximately 1 million times per day someone in the us uses uv radiation for skin tanning, equating to 30 million americans (circa 10% of the us population) who use a tanning bed. as well as exposing the host to periods of uv radiation, such practices also expose commensal skin bacteria, including staphylococcus aureus, to such uv radiation. previous work has indicated that environmental stresses on bacteria may lead to an upregulation of stress responses, in an attempt for the organism to combat the applied stress and remain viable. uv light may act as an environmental stress on bacteria, and so it was the aim of this study to examine the effect of uvc light on the antibiotic susceptibility of commensal skin bacteria, to determine if uv radiation would increase the antibiotic resistance of such skin flora and thus lead to a potential skin flora  with increased antibiotic resistance. previously, it has been shown that uvc light has a greater mutational effect on bacteria compared to lower-energy uv forms, including uva and uvb light. therefore, we decided to employ uvc light in  our study to amplify the potential for mutational events occurring in skin staphylococci organisms (n=8) including methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus (n=2), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (n=4), and coagulase-negative staphylococci (staphylococcus haemolyticus) (n=2) were exposed to varying degrees of sublethal radiation via uvc light, and their minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) susceptibility was determined by broth dilution assay against three classes of commonly used antibiotics, namely beta-lactams (penicillin), macrolides (erythromycin), and fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin). there was no significant difference between antibiotic susceptibility before uvc  exposure and until maximum sublethal stress, prior to cell death due to fatal uvc exposure with the cells. these results indicate that uv environmental stress/exposure does not upregulate antibiotic resistance, and therefore these data indicate that uvc radiation does not lead to a more antibiotic-resistant population in the staphylococci organisms post-exposure.

TI  == species distribution of coagulase negative staphylococci isolated from different  clinical specimens.
AB  == staphylococci are gram positive, non motile, asporogenous bacteria that characteristically divide in more than one plane to form irregular cluster. species are classified as coagulase-positive staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci. coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons) are reported to be the third causative agent of nosocomial infections and the most frequent cause of nosocomial bloodstream infections. strains of cons those are resistant to methicillin referred to as methicillin resistant coagulase negative  staphylococci (mrcons). now a days, mrcons has been increasing as a serious nosocomial pathogen having the property of multi drug resistance. the present study was conducted to see the species distribution, antibiotic resistance patterns and some virulence factors of cons isolated from different clinical specimens. this cross sectional descriptive study was carried out in the department of microbiology, mymensingh medical college during the period from july 2009 to may 2011. a total of 300 clinical specimens were collected for this  study of which 240 were found culture positive as single isolate. among them 110  were from surgical wound, 80 from pus of skin infections, 30 from burn ulcer exudates and 20 from diabetic ulcer exudates. a total of 80 strains of cons were  isolated from them. besides cons other isolated bacteria were s. aureus, pseudomonas spp and escherichia coli. the cons were initially detected by coagulase test. all the strains that were either slide or tube coagulase negative were further identified by different biochemical tests using a commercial kit histaph identification kit (himedia laboratories ltd) which comprise a set of 12  standard biochemical tests. a total of 16 species were identified. these were s.  epidermidis, s. saprophyticus, s. caprae, s. haemolyticus, s. simulans, s. xylosus, s. hyicus, s. hominis, s. warneri, s. auricularis, s. lugdunensis, s. felis, s. capitis, s. chromogenes, s. carnosus and s. gallinarum. of them s. epidermidis was the most prevalent (17%) followed by s. saprophyticus (15%), s. caprae (11%), s. haemolyticus (9%).

AB  == staphylococci are not part of the normal fish microflora. the presence of staphylococci on fish is an indication of (a) post-harvest contamination due to poor personnel hygiene, or (b) disease in fish. the aim of this study was to determine the prevalence, molecular genetic characteristics, antibiotic resistance and virulence factors of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa), methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) and methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (mr-cons) isolated from 200 samples of retail ready-to-eat raw fish (sashimi) collected from the japanese prefecture of hiroshima. we characterized 180 staphylococcal strains. a majority of the grocery stores surveyed (92%, 23/25) contained fish contaminated with staphylococcus species. we recovered 175 s. aureus isolates from 174 (87%, 174/200) samples, with 170 isolates of mssa. for the mrsa and mr-cons, 10 isolates were obtained from 10 samples (5%, 10/200) collected from 10 shops (40%, 10/25) belonging to four supermarket chains. sccmec typing revealed the presence of a type iv.1 sccmec cassette in s. warneri isolates, a type ii.1 sccmec cassette in s. haemolyticus isolates and a cassette in methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) isolates that could not be typed. molecular typing of two mrsa isolates by spa sequencing and multilocus sequence typing (mlst) identified t1767 and st8, respectively. antibiotic resistance genes that confer resistance to aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, beta-lactams, macrolides, lincosamides and streptogramin b (mls(b)) antibiotics were detected. genes encoding one or more of the following virulence factors: staphylococcal enterotoxins (seb, and sed), toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 (tst), exfoliative toxin (etaa) were detected in 14.2% (25/175) of s. aureus isolates. the accessory gene regulator (agr) typing of s. aureus isolates revealed that agr type 1 was most prevalent (96.5%, 169/175) followed by type 2 (2.2%, 4/175) and type 3 (1.1%, 2/175). none of the s. aureus isolates carried the panton-valentine leucocidin (pvl) encoding genes,  lukf-pv and luks-pv. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to show mrsa and mr-cons isolated from retail ready-to-eat food in japan. our results showed that sashimi is a likely vehicle for transmission of multidrug-resistant and toxigenic staphylococci.

AB  == staphylococci are a major cause of intramammary infections (imi) in ruminants. the main aim of this study was to investigate staphylococcal imi in dairy cattle  with emphasis on persistence and distribution of staphylococcal species and genotypes. with a sampling interval of 4-8 weeks, over a year, 4030 samples from  206 cows in 4 herds were collected. coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns) and staphylococcus aureus were detected in 13.2% and 4.2% of the samples, respectively. selected cns isolates from quarter milk samples were identified to  species level using soda sequencing. staphylococcus chromogenes (32%) and staphylococcus simulans (25%) predominated. the proportion of s. chromogenes was  greater in primiparous (52%) than in multiparous cows (12%), while the opposite was the case for staphylococcus epidermidis (6% and 21%, respectively). isolates  from possibly persistent imi were selected for pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge). six staphylococcal species were found to cause persistent imi; s. aureus, s. chromogenes, s. simulans, s. epidermidis, staphylococcus haemolyticus and staphylococcus warneri. it was shown that several pulsotypes (pts) within each species were associated with persistent infections, but only a few were spread and caused persistent imi in multiple cows within a herd. of special interest was the observation that only one, or a few, strains of each species caused persistent imi in multiple cows within a same herd. this indicates strain differences with respect to transmissibility and pathogenicity.

AB  == while methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) st398 is known to be widespread in pig farms, few studies have investigated the species diversity and  sccmec types of methicillin-resistant non-s. aureus staphylococci (mrnas) residing in the nose of pigs. we examined nasal swab samples of 200 pigs originating from 10 belgian pig farms previously found positive for mrsa st398. suspected staphylococcal isolates were subjected to a 16s rrna-meca-nuc pcr. confirmed mrnas were genotypically identified to the species level and investigated with a sccmec typing pcr. mrnas (n=72) were detected on all 10 farms and were carried by 29.5% of the pigs. seven mrnas species were found: staphylococcus epidermidis (38.9%), staphylococcus sciuri (18.1%), staphylococcus pasteuri (18.1%), staphylococcus rostri (12.5%), staphylococcus warneri (8.3%), staphylococcus haemolyticus (2.7%) and staphylococcus hominis (1.4%). sccmec cassettes were of type iva (29.2%), type ivc (25%), type iii (22.2%), type v (5.6%) or could not be assigned to any of the known types (nt types) (18.1%). five distinct nt types were found. the predominance of methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis (mrse) in our samples is remarkable, as mrse is mainly associated with humans. the finding of three different sccmec elements (iva, v, nt type 1) in mrnas that also prevail or predominate in mrsa st398 shows that mrnas might be an important sccmec reservoir for mrsa in pigs. yet, the occurrence of multiple other sccmec types illustrates that further studies are required to understand the presence and spread of sccmec in methicillin-resistant staphylococci from animals.

TI  == validation of the bact/alert(r) 3d system for rapid sterility testing of biopharmaceutical samples.
AB  == the bact/alert(r) 3d system was validated to determine the sterility of different types of biopharmaceutical samples such as water for injection, unprocessed bulk, and finished bulk. the installation, operation, and performance qualification were completed and verified under good manufacturing practices. during the installation and operation validation stages, the functionality and security of the system and software were completed and verified. for the performance qualification, 11 microorganisms were evaluated, six compendial (pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, candida albicans, aspergillus niger, clostridium sporogenes), one representing the number one microbial species in sterile product recalls (burkholderia cepacia), and four environmental isolates (kocuria rhizophila, staphylococcus haemolyticus, methylobacterium radiotolerans, and penicillium spp.). nine of the microorganisms were spiked into three different types of biopharmaceutical samples by three different analysts on different days to ascertain the equivalence, ruggedness, sensitivity, time of detection, and repeatability. in all samples, the bact/alert(r) exhibited equivalent or better detection than the standard test. with the exception of m. radiotolerans, all 11 microorganisms were detected within 2.5 days using the bact/alert(r) system and the standard test. the detection times for m. radiotolerans in the three sample types averaged 5.77 days. the minimum detectable level of cells for all the microorganisms tested was found to be within 1 to 2 cfu. the system optimized sterility testing by the simultaneous on-line, non-destructive incubation and detection of microbial growth.

TI  == development of pcr primers and a dna macroarray for the simultaneous detection of major staphylococcus species using groesl gene.
AB  == staphylococcus spp., including s. aureus, s. intermedius, s. hyicus, s. epidermidis, s. saprophyticus, s. haemolyticus, s. xylosus, and s. carnosus, are  major bacterial species associated with food poisoning, and human and veterinary  clinics. traditional methods for the identification of these staphylococci are time-consuming, laborious, or inaccurate. therefore, rapid and accurate diagnostic methods are needed. in this study, we designed the dna probes and polymerase chain reaction (pcr) primers for the detection of the aforementioned staphylococcus species. these primers were proved to be specific for the detection of their corresponding target strains. furthermore, by using a consensus primer pair, we were able to co-amplify the intergenic region of groes-groel for these staphylococci. followed by a chromogenic macroarray system  with the specific probes on the plastic chips, these staphylococci in milk products or clinical samples could be simultaneously detected. when the system was used for the inspection of milk or urine samples containing n x 10(0) target  cells per milliliter of the sample, all these staphylococcal species could be identified after an 8-h pre-enrichment step. this system also allowed the adequate diagnosis of bacteremia, since n x 10(0) target cells per milliliter of  the blood samples could be detected after a 12-h pre-enrichment. compared to the  multiplex pcr method, this approach has the additional advantage that it allowed  the discrimination of more bacterial strains-even some bacterial strains that may generate pcr products with the same molecular sizes.

TI  == [evaluation of rapid genotype assay for the identification of gram-positive cocci from blood cultures and detection of meca and van genes].
AB  == rapid and accurate identification of bacterial pathogens grown in blood cultures  of patients with sepsis is crucial for prompt initiation of appropriate therapy in order to decrease related morbidity and mortality rates. although current automated blood culture systems led to a significant improvement in bacterial detection time, more rapid identification systems are still needed to optimise the establishment of treatment. novel genotype technology which is developed for  the rapid diagnosis of sepsis, is a molecular genetic assay based on dna multiplex amplification with biotinylated primers followed by hybridization to membrane bound probes. the aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of "genotype(r) bc gram-positive test for the identification of gram-positive cocci  grown in blood cultures and rapid detection of meca and van genes. this test uses dna.strip(r) technology which includes a panel of probes for identification of 17 gram-positive bacterial species and is able to determinate the methicillin and vancomycin resistance mediating genes (meca and vana, vanb, vanc1, vanc2/c3) simultaneously, in a single test run. a total of 55 positive blood cultures from  bactectm plus/f (becton dickinson, usa) aerobic and pediatric blood culture vials were included in the study. the isolates which exhibit gram-positive coccus morphology by gram staining were identified by genotype (r) bc gram-positive test (hain life science, germany). all of the samples were also identified with the use of phoenix pmic/id panel (becton dickinson, usa) and antibiotic susceptibilities were determined. of the 55 blood culture isolates, 17 were identified as staphylococcus epidermidis [all were methicillin-resistant (mr)], 9 were s.aureus (one was mr), 18 were s.hominis (10 were mr), 4 were e.faecalis, 3  were e. faecium (one was vanconycin-resistant), 2 were s.saprophyticus (one was mr), 1 was s.warneri and 1 was s.haemolyticus, by phoenix automated system. genotype(r) bc gram-positive test results revealed consistency with phoenix system regarding bacterial identification in 46 (83.6%) of the samples. the two bacteria identified as s.saprophyticus by the phoenix system could not be identified by the genotype(r) bc test since this species were not included in the identification panel of the system, however, meca gene were detected in these two samples by genotype(r) bc test. genotype(r) bc test detected meca gene in five samples which were not detected as methicillin resistant by the phoenix system. besides polymicrobial growth was determined in five samples by genotype (r) bc test, but not by the automated system. one e.faecium isolate with vana gene was correctly identified by genotype(r) bc test. in conclusion, genotype(r) bc gram-positive test is a fast and reliable test for the identification of the most important gram-positive pathogens and meca and van genes directly from positive blood culture bottles. this test was also found superior than the automated phoenix system regarding the detection of polymicrobial growth. these data indicated that, routine use of dna strip technology-based assay would be useful for clinical diagnosis in patients with sepsis.

TI  == methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci on pig farms as a reservoir of heterogeneous staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec elements.
AB  == methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) likely originated by acquisition of the staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (sccmec) from coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns). however, it is unknown whether the same sccmec types are present in mrsa and cns that reside in the same niche. here we describe a study to determine the presence of a potential meca reservoir among cns recovered from 10 pig farms. the 44 strains belonged to 10 different staphylococcus species. all s. aureus strains belonged to sequence type 398 (st398), with sccmec types v and iva. type ivc, as well as types iii and vi, novel subtypes of type iv, and not-typeable types, were found in cns. s. aureus,  s. epidermidis, and s. haemolyticus shared sccmec type v. the presence of sccmec  type ivc in several staphylococcal species isolated from one pig farm is noteworthy, suggesting exchange of this sccmec type in cns, but the general distribution of this sccmec type still has to be established. in conclusion, this study shows that sccmec types among staphylococcal species on pig farms are heterogeneous. on two farms, more than one recovered staphylococcal species harbored the same sccmec type. we conclude that staphylococci on pig farms act as a reservoir of heterogeneous sccmec elements. these staphylococci may act as a source for transfer of sccmec to s. aureus.

TI  == endophthalmitis: a rare but devastating metastatic bacterial complication of hemodialysis catheter-related sepsis.
AB  == there are many infectious complications related to vascular access in patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis. we report two cases of endophthalmitis as a  metastatic infection associated with a tunneled catheter and a temporary dual lumen catheter. both patients were diabetic. a 61-year-old female on maintenance  hemodialysis by a jugular tunnelized catheter during the past year was receiving  parenteral antibiotics for catheter salvage due to fever episodes in the last 3 months. she was admitted to the hospital presenting pain, proptosis, conjunctival hyperemia, corneal infiltrate, and visual acuity of no light perception (nlp). a  51-year-old male recently undergoing hemodialysis by a temporary dual lumen catheter presented fever. his catheter was removed, but he was admitted to the hospital presenting fever, decreased vision, edema, and pain in his left eye. on  examination, eyelid edema, conjunctival hyperemia, purulent secretion, hypopyon in the pupils, and visual acuity of nlp were verified. a diagnosis of endogenous  endophthalmitis was made in both patients on clinical grounds and computed tomography. evisceration of the left eye was the first option of treatment for both patients due to poor vision. cultures of the eviscerated ocular globes showed staphylococcus hemolyticus and staphylococcus aureus, respectively. after  evisceration, both patients received treatment, had a good outcome, and were discharged to continue their hemodialysis program. metastatic bacterial endophthalmitis is a rare complication of dialysis catheter-related bacteremia. when suspected, urgent ophthalmologic evaluation and treatment are needed to reduce the risk of losing vision in the affected eye.

TI  == intravenous device associated blood stream staphylococcal infection in paediatric patients.
AB  == background & objectives: intravenous device (ivd) associated nosocomial blood stream infections due to staphylococci are major cause of morbidity and mortality. the present study was carried out to assess the frequency of staphylococcal ivd associated infections in a paediatric ward of a tertiary case  hospital. prevalence of resistance to commonly used antimicrobials in hospital acquired staphylococcal isolates was also tested. methods: children admitted in paediatric wards with ivd for more than 48 h were enrolled. blood, ivd tip at the time of removal, skin swab at the site of insertion of ivd and nasal swab were collected and cultured by standard protocol. all staphylococcal isolates from any source were analyzed for antimicrobial susceptibility by disk diffusion method. genotyping matching of those staphylococcal isolates was done which were isolated from different sites of the same patient, but were phonotypically similar. genotype of blood isolate was compared with genotype of isolate from nose/ivd/skin. results: staphylococcus aureus was the most frequent blood isolate (8.7%) followed by candida (2.9%), coagulase negative staphylococci (cons 2.6%),  pseudomonas spp. (0.4%), klebsiella spp. (0.3%) and escherichia coli (0.1%). isolation of microorganisms from blood was significantly higher in patients whose skin, ivd and nose were colonized by same microorganism (p<0.001). none of the staphylococcal isolate was found to be resistant to glycopeptides (vancomycin and teicoplanin). high penicillin and oxacillin resistance was present in both s. aureus (penicillin resistance; 76.8%, oxacillin resistance; 66.7%) and cons (penicillin resistance; 73.3%, oxacillin resistance; 60.0%). among cons biotypes, s. haemolyticus was commonest blood isolate while s. epidermidis was commonest isolate from skin/nose. only 33.3 per cent of s. aureus blood stream infections and most of s. epidermidis and s. haemolyticus blood infections were ivd associated. interpretation & conclusions: staphylococci were the major causative  agent of nosocomial blood stream infections. all episodes of septicaemia due to s. epidermidis and s. haemolyticus were ivd associated while only 1/3 of s. aureus septicaemia was ivd associated.

TI  == rapid and accurate identification of human-associated staphylococci by use of multiplex pcr.
AB  == although staphylococci are identified by phenotypic analysis in many clinical laboratories, these results are often incorrect because of phenotypic variation.  genetic analysis is necessary for definitive species identification. in the present study, we developed a simple multiplex-pcr (m-pcr) for species identification of human-associated staphylococci, which were as follows: staphylococcus aureus, s. capitis, s. caprae, s. epidermidis, s. haemolyticus, s. hominis, s. lugdunensis, s. saprophyticus, and s. warneri. this method was designed on the basis of nucleotide sequences of the thermonuclease (nuc) genes that were universally conserved in staphylococci except the s. sciuri group and showed moderate sequence diversity. in order to validate this assay, 361 staphylococcal strains were studied, which had been identified at the species levels by sequence analysis of the hsp60 genes. in consequence, m-pcr demonstrated a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 100%. by virtue of simplicity and accuracy, this method will be useful in clinical research.

TI  == [investigation of reduced vancomycin susceptibility in methicillin-resistant staphylococci].
AB  == the first staphylococcus aureus strain with reduced susceptibility to vancomycin  was reported from japan in 1996, and since then an increasing numbers of cases had been reported from various countries. along with the unfeasibility in the identification of these strains with routine laboratory methods, the use of glycopeptid antibiotics in infections due to these strains may result in therapeutic failure. the aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of vancomycin intermediate staphylococcus (vis) and heterogenous vis (hvis) strains  with the use of agar screening, macro e-test, and population analysis profile (pap-uc; population analysis profile-area under the curve) methods. a total of 148 methicillin-resistant staphylococcus strains isolated from different clinical samples (48 tracheal aspirate, 48 blood, 39 wound swabs, eight urine, two cerebrospinal fluid, two pleural fluid, one catheter tip sample) between november 2007 and may 2009, were included in the study. of the isolates 107 were identified as s.aureus and 41 were coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns; 23 staphylococcus epidermidis, six staphylococcus haemolyticus, five staphylococcus  chromogenes, three staphylococcus hominis and four others) by api staph kit (biomerieux, usa). methicillin resistance has been determined by standard disk diffusion method with oxacillin (1 microg) and cefoxitin (30 microg) disks, according to "clinical and laboratory standarts institute (clsi)" guidelines. for the identification of vis and hvis strains, brain-heart infusion agar plates containing 6 microg/ml vancomycin (bhi-v6) were used for screening. the suspected visa/hvisa strains which grew in this agar were further tested by macro e-test and pap-auc methods. total vis and hvis rates among the tested isolates, were found as 3.4% (5/148) and 1.4% (2/148), respectively. these rates for cns strains were 9.8% (4/41) and 2.4% (1/41), and for s.aureus strains were 0.9% (1/107) ve 0.9% (1/107), respectively. in the evaluation of the seven patients who were infected with visa/hvisa strains, it was detected that all had history of use of  glycopeptid antibiotics except one whose history was not reached, and all were hospitalized in intensive care units, except one who had an infected knee prosthesis. since macro e-test and pap-auc methods could not be performed for all of the isolates, there was a probability that our resistance rates did not reflect the real results, nevertheless vis and hvis prevalence that we found in our study, seemed to be higher than those data reported previously from our country. in conclusion, since the number of visa/hvisa strains may increase in time, surveillance for vancomycin resistance in methicillin-resistant staphylococci should be carried out in hospitals periodically.

TI  == detection and differentiation of staphylococcal contamination of clinical surfaces using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis.
AB  == the detection and identification of staphylococci from the environment of at-risk patients can be an important step in determining the role of the environment in hospital-acquired infections. current methods that are used to identify these pathogens are either limited in their capabilities, expensive and/or labour intensive. we developed a denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) analysis protocol for the detection and identification of staphylococci that takes advantage of species-specific polymorphisms in the gene that encodes elongation factor tu (tuf). the protocol was optimised by performing polymerase chain reaction (pcr)-dgge analysis on dna isolated from pure cultures of 27 different staphylococcal species. this resulted in the separation of the pcr products into  19 different band positions, including unique positions for important species such as staphylococcus aureus, s. hominis, s. lugdunensis, s. warneri, s. capitis, s. caprae and s. saprophyticus. application of the method was demonstrated by swabbing 15 clinical surfaces in an isolation room occupied by a  patient before and after routine cleaning. pcr-dgge analysis of tuf showed that despite cleaning efforts, the surfaces remained contaminated with several species of staphylococci, including s. aureus, s. epidermidis, s. lugdunensis, s. hominis, s. haemolyticus and s. simulans. we conclude that dgge of tuf represents a promising technique for the detection, characterisation and monitoring of mixed assemblages of staphylococci in the healthcare environment.

AB  == methicillin resistance in staphylococci is conferred by the acquisition in its chromosome of the meca gene, which is located on a mobile genetic element called  staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (sccmec). genetic type of sccmec is defined by combination of mec gene complex class and cassette chromosome recombinase gene (ccr) allotype. in this study, we analyzed genetic diversity of  the sccmec in 11 staphylococcus haemolyticus strains and a staphylococcus sciuri  strain, which were recently isolated from clinical specimens in bangladesh. among these strains, only two s. haemolyticus strains were proved to have the known types of sccmec, that is, sccmec v (class c2 mec-ccrc) and vii (class c1 mec-ccrc). five s. haemolyticus strains were assigned two unique mec-ccr gene complexes combination; that is, class c1 mec-ccra4b4 (four isolates) and class a  mec-ccrc (one isolate). in the remaining four s. haemolyticus strains with class  c1 mec, no known ccr allotypes could be detected. a single s. sciuri strain with  class a mec complex carried a ccra gene belonging to a novel allotype designated  ccra7, together with ccrb3. the ccra7 gene in the s. sciuri strain showed 61.7%-82.7% sequence identity to the ccra gene sequences published so far, and 75.3% identity to ccra3, which is a component of the type 3 ccr complex (ccra3-ccrb3) in methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus. the results of the  present study indicated that mec gene complex and ccr genes in coagulase-negative staphylococci are highly divergent, and distinct from those of common methicillin-resistant s. aureus. identification of the novel ccra7 allotype combined with ccrb3 suggested an occurrence of recombination between different ccr complexes in nature.

TI  == effect of photodynamic therapy on clinical isolates of staphylococcus spp.
AB  == staphylococcus spp. are opportunistic microorganisms known for their capacity to  develop resistance against antimicrobial agents. the objective of this study was  to evaluate the effect of photodynamic therapy (pdt) on 20 staphylococcus strains isolated from the human oral cavity, including s. aureus, s. schleiferi, s. epidermidis, s. capitis, s. haemolyticus, and s. lentus. a suspension of each staphylococcus strain (10(6) cells/ml) was submitted to pdt using methylene blue  and a low power laser. the isolated effects of methylene blue, laser treatment and ciprofloxacin were also evaluated. after the experimental treatments, 0.1 ml  aliquots of the suspensions were seeded onto bhi agar for determination of the number of colony-forming units (cfu/ml). the results were analyzed by analysis of variance and tukey's test (p < 0.05). the mean reduction in bacterial counts of the strains submitted to pdt ranged from 4.89 to 6.83 cfu (log10)/ml, with the observation of a decreasing susceptibility to treatment of s. schleiferi, s. haemolyticus, s. epidermidis, s. capitis, s. aureus, and s. lentus. the results showed that pdt was effective in reducing the number of viable cells of all clinical staphylococcus isolates studied.

TI  == susceptibility patterns of coagulase-negative staphylococci to several newer antimicrobial agents in comparison with vancomycin and oxacillin.
AB  == coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons) have emerged as important nosocomial pathogens. cons resistance to meticillin and other semisynthetic penicillins is now common. elevated vancomycin minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) have been reported and are associated with worse treatment outcomes. several newer antibiotics have recently become available for the treatment of gram-positive infections. the purpose of this study was to assess the in vitro activity of telavancin, daptomycin, linezolid and tigecycline in comparison with oxacillin and vancomycin against 653 non-duplicate clinical isolates of cons by the agar dilution method. the greatest variability in mic was observed for oxacillin. presence of the meca gene conferred higher mics for oxacillin but did not influence mics to all other antibiotics tested. telavancin tended to have mics that were 1-2 dilutions lower than vancomycin. daptomycin had good activity against all isolates. staphylococcus haemolyticus, staphylococcus hominis subsp.  novobiosepticus, staphylococcus saprophyticus, staphylococcus schleiferi and staphylococcus simulans were the most daptomycin-susceptible cons species tested. the validity of the agar dilution method for daptomycin was confirmed, with >90%  isolates having mics that were within 1 dilution of parallel etest results. within-species mic variation was most restricted for linezolid and tigecycline, with the exception of staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus haemolyticus  that demonstrated higher overall mics to tigecycline.

TI  == an unexpected location of the arginine catabolic mobile element (acme) in a usa300-related mrsa strain.
AB  == in methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), the arginine catabolic mobile element (acme) was initially described in usa300 (t008-st8) where it is located downstream of the staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (sccmec). a common health-care associated mrsa in copenhagen, denmark (t024-st8) is clonally  related to usa300 and is frequently pcr positive for the acme specific arca-gene. this study is the first to describe an acme element upstream of the sccmec in mrsa. by traditional sccmec typing schemes, the sccmec of t024-st8 strain m1 carries sccmec iva, but full sequencing of the cassette revealed that the entire  j3 region had no homology to published sccmec iva. within the j3 region of m1 was a 1705 bp sequence only similar to a sequence in s. haemolyticus strain jcsc1435  and 2941 bps with no homology found in genbank. in addition to the usual direct repeats (dr) at each extremity of sccmec, m1 had two new dr between the orfx gene and the j3 region of the sccmec. the region between the orfx dr (dr1) and dr2 contained the ccrab4 genes. an acme ii-like element was located between dr2 and dr3. the entire 26,468 bp sequence between dr1 and dr3 was highly similar to parts of the acme composite island of s. epidermidis strain atcc12228. sequencing of an acme negative t024-st8 strain (m299) showed that dr1 and the sequence between dr1 and dr3 was missing. the finding of a mobile acme ii-like element inserted downstream of orfx and upstream of sccmec indicates a novel recombination between staphylococcal species.

TI  == prevalence and characteristics of methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci from livestock, chicken carcasses, bulk tank milk, minced meat, and contact persons.
AB  == background: methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (mr-cns) are of increasing importance to animal and public health. in veterinary medicine and  along the meat and milk production line, only limited data were so far available  on mr-cns characteristics. the aim of the present study was to evaluate the prevalence of mr-cns, to identify the detected staphylococci to species level, and to assess the antibiotic resistance profiles of isolated mr-cns strains. results: after two-step enrichment and growth on chromogenic agar, mr-cns were detected in 48.2% of samples from livestock and chicken carcasses, 46.4% of samples from bulk tank milk and minced meat, and 49.3% of human samples. using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms), 414 selected mr-cns strains belonged to seven different species (s. sciuri, 32.6%; s. fleurettii, 25.1%; s. haemolyticus, 17.4%; s. epidermidis,  14.5%, s. lentus, 9.2%; s. warneri, 0.7%; s. cohnii, 0.5%). s. sciuri and s. fleurettii thereby predominated in livestock, btm and minced meat samples, whereas s. epidermidis and s. haemolyticus predominated in human samples. in addition to beta-lactam resistance, 33-49% of all 414 strains were resistant to certain non-beta-lactam antibiotics (ciproflaxacin, clindamycin, erythromycin, tetracycline). conclusions: a high prevalence of mr-cns was found in livestock production. this is of concern in view of potential spread of meca to s. aureus (mrsa). multiresistant cns strains might become an emerging problem for veterinary medicine. for species identification of mr-cns isolated from different origins, maldi-tof ms proved to be a fast and reliable tool and is suitable for screening of large sample amounts.

TI  == diversity of plasmids and transmission of high-level mupirocin mupa resistance gene in staphylococcus haemolyticus.
AB  == the coagulase-negative staphylococci are known for their ability to acquire resistance genes, which limits the choice of therapeutic options for the treatment of infections caused by these microorganisms. in this study, the diversity of high-level mupirocin resistance plasmids (mup(r) ) was investigated  in four strains of staphylococcus haemolyticus belonging to different pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) types or subtypes, isolated in a brazilian hospital. these strains harbor the mupa gene in large plasmids. in addition, the presence of is257 sequences flanking the mupa gene was also shown.  two isolates belonging to two different pfge types exhibited a similar polymorphism for a fragment of the mupa gene and the closest proximal flanking copies of the is257, suggesting horizontal transmission of s. haemolyticus mupirocin resistance plasmids in the environment and a role of this species as a  reservoir of the mupa gene.

TI  == differentiation of staphylococcus spp. by high-resolution melting analysis.
AB  == high-resolution melting analysis (hrma) is a fast (post-pcr) high-throughput method to scan for sequence variations in a target gene. the aim of this study was to test the potential of hrma to distinguish particular bacterial species of  the staphylococcus genus even when using a broad-range pcr within the 16s rrna gene where sequence differences are minimal. genomic dna samples isolated from 12 reference staphylococcal strains (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus capitis,  staphylococcus caprae, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus haemolyticus, staphylococcus hominis, staphylococcus intermedius, staphylococcus saprophyticus, staphylococcus sciuri, staphylococcus simulans, staphylococcus warneri, and staphylococcus xylosus) were subjected to a real-time pcr amplification of the 16s rrna gene in the presence of fluorescent dye evagreen, followed by hrma. melting profiles were used as molecular fingerprints for bacterial species differentiation. hrma of s. saprophyticus and s. xylosus resulted in undistinguishable profiles because of their identical sequences in the analyzed 16s rrna region. the remaining reference strains were fully differentiated either directly or via high-resolution plots obtained by heteroduplex formation between  coamplified pcr products of the tested staphylococcal strain and phylogenetically unrelated strain.

TI  == facile synthesis and antibacterial activity of naturally occurring 5-methoxyfuroflavone.
AB  == a convenient synthesis of 5-methoxyfuroflavone (6, pongaglabol methyl ether), a constituent of some pongamia or millettia genus, was achieved by starting from 2,4-dihydroxy-6-methoxyacetophenone via a chalcone precursor, followed by treatment with 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-1,4-benzoquinone (ddq). this five-step reaction (total yield: 21.6%) is more facile with that of previously utilized procedures using each different starting material. antibacterial activities of the above compound and its precursor chalcones, which also belongs to the class of furoflavonoids, were tested by the disc diffusion method against shigella dysenteriae, salmonella typhi, streptococcus-beta-haemolyticus, and staphylococcus aureus. 5-methoxyfuroflavone showed moderate bactericidal activity against all tested bacterial strains, whereas its corresponding chalcone compound revealed a selective activity.

TI  == characterization of a new sccmec element in staphylococcus cohnii.
AB  == background: many sccmec elements of coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons) could not be typed using multiplex pcr. such a 'non-typable' sccmec was encountered in  a staphylococcus cohnii isolate. methodology/principal findings: the sccmec type  of methicillin-resistant s. cohnii clinical isolate wc28 could not be assigned using multiplex pcr. newly-designed primers were used to amplify ccra and ccrb genes. the whole sccmec was obtained by three overlapping long-range pcr, targeting regions from left-hand inverted repeat (irl) to ccra/b, from ccra/b to  meca and from meca to orfx. the region abutting irl was identified using inverse  pcr with self-ligated enzyme-restricted wc28 fragments as the template. wc28 sccmec had a class a mec gene complex (meci-mecr1-meca). the ccra and ccrb genes  were closest (89.7% identity) to ccra(shp) of staphylococcus haemolyticus strain  h9 and to ccrb3 (90% identity) of staphylococcus pseudintermedius strain km241, respectively. two new genes potentially encoding aaa-type atpase were found in j1 region and a psitn554 transposon was present in j2 region, while j3 region was the same as many sccmec of staphylococcus aureus. wc28 sccmec abutted an incomplete scc element with a novel allotype of ccrc, which was closest (82% identity) to ccrc1 allele 9 in staphylococcus saprophyticus strain atcc 15305. only two direct target repeat sequences, one close to the 3'-end of orfx and the  other abutting the left end of wc28 sccmec, could be detected. conclusions/significance: a new 35-kb sccmec was characterized in a s. cohnii isolate, carrying a class a mec gene complex, new variants of ccra5 and ccrb3 and two novel genes in the j1 region. this element is flanked by 8-bp perfect inverted repeats and is similar to type iii sccmec in s. aureus and a sccmec in s. pseudintermedius but with different j1 and j3 regions. wc28 sccmec was arranged in tandem with an additional scc element with ccrc, scc(wc28), but the two elements might have integrated independently rather than constituted a composite. this study adds new evidence of the diversity of sccmec in cons and highlights the need for characterizing the 'non-typable' sccmec to reveal the gene pool associated with meca.

TI  == rapid identification of staphylococci from prosthetic joint infections using maldi-tof mass-spectrometry.
AB  == hospital-acquired infections associated with implanted medical devices are most commonly caused by staphylococci. current methods of species identification are slow, costly, and sometimes unreliable. we evaluated the ability of a bruker daltonics microflex maldi-tof/ms in conjunction with maldi biotyper software to identify 158 characterized staphylococcal isolates from prosthetic joint infections, including 36 staphylococcus aureus, 100 staphylococcus epidermidis, 10 staphylococcus capitis, 8 staphylococcus lugdunensis, 2 staphylococcus warneri, and 2 staphylococcus haemolyticus isolates using the extraction method recommended by bruker daltonics. the suggested species identification by the maldi biotyper software was correct for all isolates, indicating reliable differentiation between s. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci. applying  the recommended criteria of the maldi biotyper software all 158 isolates gave scores >/=2.0, implying secure genus and probable species identification for all  isolates. 34/36 s. aureus, 36/100 s. epidermidis, 5/10 s. capitis, 6/8 s. lugdunensis, 2/2 s. haemolyticus, 0/2 s. warneri displayed scores >/=2.3 implying highly probable species identification. for s. epidermidis 25/100 additional isolates had a score close to 2.3. it appears that additional clinically relevant staphylococcal isolates in the data base might aid in identification at scores implying highly probable species identification. the ability of the maldi biotyper software to recognize clonally-related strains within a species group (i.e. sub-typing) was investigated, and showed great potential. in conclusion, the maldi-tof/ms maldi biotyper system provides a promising rapid and reliable method of identifying clinical isolates from prosthetic joint infections to the species level, and has potential for sub-typing.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibilities of coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns) and streptococci from bovine subclinical mastitis cases.
AB  == the prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibilities of staphylococci and streptococci were assessed from subclinical mastitis cases. one hundred coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns) and 34 streptococci were identified. the most frequently isolated species were staphylococcus haemolyticus (27%) and staphylococcus simulans (24%). susceptible cns species revealed the highest resistance to penicillin g (58%), ampicillin (48%), neomycin (20%), and oleandomycin (14%). cns methicillin resistance rates within 82 isolates were 21.95% and 1.22% by disk diffusion and pcr methods, respectively. these results suggested the disk diffusion method was more prone to yield false positives. partial sequencing of the 16s rrna region from the meca carrying isolate (s. haemolyticus) was homologous with s. haemolyticus sequences/accessions obtained from genbank. however, the meca gene sequence from this isolate was more closely  allied with the s. aureus meca gene of human origins. identical sequence data was acquired from the national center for biotechnology information (ncbi) database,  suggesting horizontal gene transfer between the two species. cns beta-lactamase activity within 81 isolates was 29.63%. the most frequently isolated streptococcus species were s. uberis (52%) and s. agalactiae (15%). oleandomycin  was the least effective antimicrobial agent on these isolates with 59% susceptibility. results indicated that cns and streptococci exhibited various antimicrobial resistance responses. consequently, isolation and identification of udder pathogens in herds suffering from subclinical agents is essential to select the most effective antimicrobial agent. moreover, multiple resistance features of methicillin resistant (mr) isolates should be considered during antimicrobial susceptibility tests.

AB  == coagulase-negative species of staphylococcus are often associated with opportunistic hospital-acquired infections that arise from the colonization of indwelling catheters. here we show that the antiparasitic drug nitazoxanide (ntz) and its active metabolite, tizoxanide (tiz), are inhibitory to the growth of staphylococcus epidermidis and other staphylococci, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus strains, under aerobic and microaerobic conditions (mics, 8 to 16 microg/ml). at sub-mic levels, ntz and tiz also inhibited biofilm production under static conditions by strains of s. epidermidis and staphylococcus haemolyticus with a 50% inhibitory concentration of approximately 2.5 microg/ml (8 microm). the 5-nitro group was required for biological activity, and a hydrophilic derivative of ntz (amix) also inhibited biofilm formation. ntz did not disperse the existing biofilm but did block further accumulation. sub-mics of ntz had no effect on primary attachment to surfaces at either 4 or 37 degrees c. the inhibitory action of ntz and tiz, but not vancomycin, on biofilm production could be reversed by the addition of zinc salts (2.5 to 40 microm) but not other metals, suggesting that ntz might target the zinc-dependent accumulation-associated protein (aap) that mediates accumulation on surfaces. however, neither ntz nor tiz formed chelation complexes with zinc salts, based on spectrophotometric and nuclear magnetic resonance analyses, and addition of excess zinc to ntz-grown bacteria (apo-aap) did not restore the accumulation phenotype. our studies suggest that sub-mic levels of ntz may affect the assembly or function of cell structures associated with the biofilm phenotype.

TI  == [evolution in the antibiotic susceptibility and resistance].
AB  == over the last decade the proliferation of antibiotic-resistant pathogens has been a growing problem, especially in some geographic areas, making useless most of the classical antibiotic therapies. the rapid emergence of resistant bacteria is  the result of different factors as the intrinsic microbial complexity, the growing attitude to travel of humans, animals and goods, the use of antibiotics outside hospitals, and the lack of precise therapeutic chooses for high risk group of patients. the antibiotic-resistance becomes certainly a serious problem  when a resistant pathogen, and often multi-resistant today, is present in an infective site. in fact in a recent estimate of the centre for disease control and prevention (cdc) about 90.000 deaths per year in the usa are attributable to  bacterial infections and in particular to resistant pathogens. it appears clear that the clinic relevance of this problem is the decimation of the sensible germs of the normal flora that leads to the upper hand of the only resistant bacteria.  the antibiotic therapy, in fact, select the resistance and each bacteria has developed a particular strategy to survive: mutations of the genetic content or acquisition of resistance genes from the external. among the gram positive bacteria, besides methicillin resistant staphyloccocus aureus, there are other pathogens such as coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons), enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis, some species of streptococci and multiresistant corynebacterium. the cons, eg. s. epidermidis, s. hominis and s. haemolyticus, are recognized as new important nosocomial pathogens and are not only responsible of invasive infections but have become in few years resistant to oxacillin (more  than 60%) and multiresistant. the unsuspected fragility of glycopeptides, which for 40 years have been the most important treatment against infections due to gram-positive bacteria, has posed the need for new antimicrobial molecules. among the therapeutic possible options there are linezolid, tygecyline and daptomycin,  but new other molecules are appearing in the clinical use like ceftobiprole and dalbavancin.

TI  == [dosage adjustment of vancomycin in continuous infusion in critically ill-patients].
AB  == introduction: as the susceptibility of staphylococcal strains to glycopeptides rises, it is becoming necessary to increase vancomycin dosages. objective: to evaluate an administration protocol for vancomycin using continuous infusion with a loading dose of 30 mg/kg followed by 30 mg/kg per 24h in intensive care patients presenting creatinine clearance (clc) greater than 50. results: a total  of 22 patients were included in the study. serum vancomycin concentrations after  24h (c24h) ranged from 25 to 30 mg/l in seven of 14 patients with clc less than 120 ml/min (50 %), compared with three patients (21 %) with c24h greater than 35  mg/l and four patients (29 %) with c24 h less than 25 mg/l. however, c24h was less than 20mg/l for the eight patients with clc greater or equal to 120 ml/min.  bacteriological data was available for eight of the 14 patients with clc less than 120 ml/min, and in these eight patients, the c24h/mic was greater or equal to 8; seven of these patients had an auc/mic greater or equal to 350. conclusion: assay of serum vancomycin concentrations after 24h of treatment is necessary to enable rapid adjustment of vancomycin concentration in order to improve therapeutic efficacy or avoid nephrotoxicity.

TI  == diversity of staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec structures in coagulase-negative staphylococci and relationship to drug resistance.
AB  == the objective of this study was to determine the distribution of staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (sccmec) elements in meticillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (mr-cons) isolated from a tertiary-care hospital in mexico and to examine the relationship to drug resistance. fifty selected mr-cons isolates collected from catheters (n=15), blood (n=15), bone (n=9), bronchial lavage (n=2) and urine (n=2) and one isolate each from an abscess, cerebrospinal fluid, eye, pleural effusion, synovial fluid, tracheal aspirate and wound secretion were examined. susceptibility testing was performed by the broth  microdilution method. sccmec types were determined by multiplex pcr and pfge was  carried out as described previously for staphylococcus aureus. among the mr-cons  strains studied, the most frequently isolated species were staphylococcus epidermidis (n=26) and staphylococcus haemolyticus (n=13). staphylococcus cohnii  (n=5), staphylococcus hominis (n=3), staphylococcus sciuri (n=1), staphylococcus  pasteuri (n=1) and the recently described species staphylococcus pettenkoferi (n=1) were also identified. the most frequent mr-cons genotype identified was sccmec type iva in s. epidermidis isolates, which also showed a high diversity in their pfge patterns. a clone was found that amplified both sccmec iii and v elements in five isolates examined. the single mr s. pettenkoferi isolate harboured sccmec type ivd and the single mr s. pasteuri isolate harboured sccmec  type i. the carriage of sccmec type iii was associated with resistance or intermediate resistance to meropenem (p <0.05). these results confirm the high prevalence of s. epidermidis sccmec iva and the high genetic diversity among mr-cons strains. as far as is known, this is the first report describing the newly identified s. pettenkoferi possessing sccmec ivd and s. pasteuri harbouring sccmec type i. mr-cons harbouring sccmec type iii were found to be more resistant to meropenem.

TI  == decontamination efficacy of antiseptic agents on in vivo grown biofilms on rough  titanium surfaces.
AB  == objective: four common antimicrobial agents were evaluated for their efficacy in  reduction of aerobic bacteria intraorally grown in biofilms on rough titanium samples. the solutions investigated contained chlorhexidine, essential oil, octenidine, or citric acid. method and materials: twenty volunteers wore splints  with titanium sleeves intraorally for 10 days. following irrigation with the antiseptics, the sleeves were removed and biofilm samples were taken by swabbing. the bacteria were first examined microscopically by gram staining. these samples  from the surfaces were then cultured under aerobic conditions to identify and quantify the colonizing bacteria. results: compared to untreated controls, significant (p < .05) differences in antimicrobial efficacy were observed for the different regimens depending on bacterial species or even the subtype. the reduction rates achieved varied from 30.0% after 2 minutes of rinsing with chlorhexidine to 99.8% after 8 minutes of rinsing with octenidine. conclusion: the irrigation regimens studied in this investigation reduced bacterial colonization in a mature biofilm grown intraorally on rough titanium surfaces. the highest absolute reduction was achieved after 8 minutes, but only the 2-minute reduction rates are significant for clinical practice. taking this into  consideration, the distinct decontamination efficacy of octenidine and citric acid is evident.

TI  == metabolism of azo dyes by human skin microbiota.
AB  == reduction of methyl red (mr) and orange ii (or ii) by 26 human skin bacterial species was monitored by a rapid spectrophotometric assay. the analysis indicated that skin bacteria, representing the genera staphylococcus, corynebacterium, micrococcus, dermacoccus and kocuria, were able to reduce mr by 74-100 % in 24 h, with only three species unable to reduce completely the dye in that time. among the species tested, only corynebacterium xerosis was unable to reduce or ii to any degree by 24 h, and only staphylococcus delphini, staphylococcus sciuri subsp. sciuri and pseudomonas aeruginosa were able to reduce completely this dye  within 24 h. mr reduction started with early-exponential growth in staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, and around late-exponential/early-stationary growth in p. aeruginosa. reduction of or ii, ponceau s and ponceau bs started during late-exponential/early-stationary growth  for all three species. using liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization mass spectrometry analyses, mr metabolites produced by staph. aureus, staph. epidermidis and p. aeruginosa were identified as n,n-dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine  and 2-aminobenzoic acid. searches of available genomic and proteomic data revealed that at least four of the staphylococci in this study, staphylococcus haemolyticus, staph. epidermidis, staphylococcus cohnii and staphylococcus saprophyticus, have hypothetical genes with 77, 76, 75 and 74 % sequence identity to azo1 encoding an azoreductase from staph. aureus and hypothetical proteins with 82, 80, 72 and 74 % identity to azo1, respectively. in addition, staphylococcus capitis has a protein with 79 % identity to azo1. western analysis detected proteins similar to azo1 in all the staphylococci tested, except staph.  delphini, staph. sciuri subsp. sciuri and staphylococcus auricularis. the data presented in this report will be useful in the risk assessment process for evaluation of public exposure to products containing these dyes.

TI  == comparative study of two plasticins: specificity, interfacial behavior, and bactericidal activity.
AB  == a comparative study was designed to evaluate the staphylococcidal efficiency of two sequence-related plasticins from the dermaseptin superfamily we screened previously. their bactericidal activities against staphylococcus aureus as well as their chemotactic potential were investigated. the impact of the gras/grar two-component system involved in regulating resistance to cationic antimicrobial  peptides (camps) was evaluated. membrane disturbing activity was quantified by membrane depolarization assays using the dis-c3 probe and by membrane integrity assays measuring beta-galactosidase activity with recombinant strain st1065 reflecting compromised membranes and cytoplasmic leakage. interactions of plasticins with membrane models composed of either zwitterionic lipids mimicking  the s. aureus membrane of camp-resistant strains or anionic lipids mimicking the  negative charge-depleted membrane of camp-sensitive strains were analyzed by jointed brewster angle microscopy (bam), polarization modulation infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (pm-irras), and differential scanning calorimetry (dsc) to yield detailed information about the macroscopic interfacial organization, in situ conformation, orientation of the peptides at the lipid-solvent interface, and lipid-phase disturbance. we clearly found evidence of distinct interfacial behaviors of plasticins we linked to the distribution of  charges along the peptides and structural interconversion properties at the membrane interface. our results also suggest that amidation might play a key role in gras/grar-mediated camp sensing at the bacterial surface.

TI  == vancomycin dosage optimization in patients with malignant haematological disease  by pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analysis.
AB  == background: the use of vancomycin against staphylococcus aureus is currently debated because of the increasing resistance developed by this pathogen. nevertheless, antibacterial effectiveness is a limited resource that must be protected and restored. novel dosage strategies based on pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analyses are needed to retain effectiveness that  could improve drug exposure in patients infected with such pathogens. objective:  the aim of this study was to assess whether standard or higher vancomycin dosages are required to increase the probability of attaining a target pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic index for several staphylococcal strains and thus to estimate the minimum vancomycin daily dose related to a high probability of effective treatment in patients with malignant haematological disease. methods: monte carlo simulation was performed to calculate the cumulative fraction of response (cfr) for different vancomycin daily dosages, using a population pharmacokinetic model previously defined in patients with malignant haematological disease and the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) distribution for vancomycin against several staphylococcal species (vancomycin-susceptible s. aureus and vancomycin-intermediate s. aureus [visa], s. epidermidis, s. haemolyticus and coagulase-negative staphylococcus [cns] species) obtained from the european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing (eucast) in order to predict the dose that would achieve the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic index value associated with efficacy (the area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 hours divided by the mic [auc(24)/mic >/=400]). results: cfr values showed dependence on the renal function of the patient and the causative pathogen. only in patients with a creatinine clearance (cl(cr)) <60 ml/min did the standard vancomycin dosage (2000 mg/day) induce cfrs >60% for all staphylococci, except the visa strains. cfrs for s. aureus of 90.6%, 47.3% and 31.2% for cl(cr) values of <60, 60-120 and >120 ml/min, respectively, were obtained, whereas for the visa strains, the corresponding values were only 14.0%, 0.3% and 0%. the impact of potential pathogens on cfrs is also significant. according to our pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analysis, in patients with normal renal function  (cl(cr) between 60 and 120 ml/min) vancomycin 2000 mg/day leads to a risk of not  achieving the recommended auc(24)/mic breakpoint of 52.7%, 70.4%, 74.9% and 80.3% for s. aureus, s. haemolyticus, cns and s. epidermidis, respectively. application of our results to clinical practice graphically allows us to obtain the recommended dose for any a priori-selected probability of attaining the auc(24)/mic ratio of >/=400 and to evaluate the cfrs for any dosing regimen used  in this population group, depending on the patients' renal function. conclusions: application of pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analysis based on monte carlo simulation offers an excellent tool for selecting the therapeutic option with the highest probability of clinical success in patients with malignant haematological disease. thus, for vancomycin-susceptible s. aureus, if a cfr >/=80 is assumed as clinically acceptable, vancomycin doses of 1500, 3000 and 4000 mg/day for a cl(cr) of <60, 60-120 and >120 ml/min, respectively, will be required.

TI  == effect of bovine lactoferrin on the internalization of coagulase-negative staphylococci into bovine mammary epithelial cells under in-vitro conditions.
AB  == coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns) have emerged as bovine mastitis pathogens  in many countries. cns mastitis is generally mild but can persist in the udder for long periods. pathogenesis of cns intramammary infection is not well understood. in the present study, adhesion, invasion and intracellular replication of twenty-two cns strains isolated from bovine mastitis and the effect of bovine lactoferrin (blf) on the internalization were studied in vitro in a bovine mammary epithelial (bme) cell model. the cns strains were of staphylococcus chromogenes, staph. simulans, staph. epidermidis, staph. haemolyticus and staph. cohnii urealyticus; two strains of staph. aureus were used as controls. seven of the cns strains originated from persistent and five from transient mastitis infections. the in-vitro susceptibility of the strains to blf was also investigated. all cns species examined had an adhesive ability equal to that of staph. aureus, but internalization varied among staphylococcal strains. the antagonistic effect of blf on the adhesion and invasion of cns strains was weak, but blf significantly decreased intracellular replication and replication rates of cns. no correlation between the in-vitro susceptibility of the strain to blf or internalization among clinical signs of mastitis was established. no difference between the persistent and transient cns strains in adhesion, invasion or replication rate was recorded. this in-vitro bme cell model can be used to study the virulence potential of mastitis pathogens, although the  severity and persistence of eventual infections shall be further investigated in  vivo. the role of blf in intramammary infection caused by cns may be limited.

AB  == the staphylococcus carnosus genome has the highest gc content of all sequenced staphylococcal genomes, with 34.6%, and therefore represents a species that is set apart from s. aureus, s. epidermidis, s. saprophyticus, and s. haemolyticus.  with only 2.56 mbp, the genome belongs to a family of smaller staphylococcal genomes, and the ori and ter regions are asymmetrically arranged with the replichores i (1.05 mbp) and ii (1.5 mbp). the events leading up to this asymmetry probably occurred not that long ago in evolution, as there was not enough time to approach the natural tendency of a physical balance. unlike the genomes of pathogenic species, the tm300 genome does not contain mobile elements  such as plasmids, insertion sequences, transposons, or star elements; also, the number of repeat sequences is markedly decreased, suggesting a comparatively high stability of the genome. while most s. aureus genomes contain several prophages and genomic islands, the tm300 genome contains only one prophage, phitm300, and one genomic island, nusca1, which is characterized by a mosaic structure mainly composed of species-specific genes. most of the metabolic core pathways are present in the genome. some open reading frames are truncated, which reflects the nutrient-rich environment of the meat starter culture, making some functions dispensable. the genome is well equipped with all functions necessary for the starter culture, such as nitrate/nitrite reduction, various sugar degradation pathways, two catalases, and nine osmoprotection systems. the genome lacks most of the toxins typical of s. aureus as well as genes involved in biofilm formation, underscoring the nonpathogenic status.

TI  == tuberculosis in southern chinese renal-transplant recipients.
AB  == objectives: to analyze the characteristics of tuberculosis (tb) in southern chinese renal transplant recipients, and summarize the corresponding experiences  in diagnosis and management. method: retrospectively study 41 documented post-transplant tb cases out of the 2333 patients who received kidney transplantation in the first affiliated hospital of sun yat-sen university between jan. 1991 and apr. 2007. results: tb in the post-renal-transplant population in southern china displayed the following characteristics: (i) high incidence within a short time after transplantation, the median interval between  renal transplantation and diagnosis of tb was 8 months (range: 1-156 months) and  56.1% were diagnosed within the first year post-transplant; (ii) high prevalence  (51.2%) of extra-pulmonary tuberculosis; (iii) high co-infection rate (19.5%), pathogens included candida albicans, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, acinetobacter haemolyticus and cytomegalovirus; (iv) fever (82.9%), cough (56.1%) and sputum (39.0%) are the most common clinical manifestations; (v) purified protein derivative of tuberculin (ppd) skin test had little diagnostic value in this group with a negative result in all 41 cases; (vi) acute rejection  (29.3%) and liver function damage (17.1%) were the main adverse effects of anti-tuberculosis chemotherapy; (vii) mortality of patients with post-transplant  tuberculosis reached up to 22.0%. conclusions: chinese renal transplant recipients face a high risk of tb because of their immuno-compromised state and epidemiological prevalence of the disease. therefore, attention should be given to this differential diagnosis in clinical practice. balancing the benefits and disadvantages of anti-tuberculosis chemotherapy is of importance for this specific population.

TI  == the origin of a methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus isolate at a neonatal ward in sweden-possible horizontal transfer of a staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec between methicillin-resistant staphylococcus haemolyticus and staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == the first methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) strain originated when a staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (sccmec) with the gene meca was integrated into the chromosome of a susceptible s. aureus cell. the sccmec elements are common among the coagulase-negative staphylococci, e.g. staphylococcus haemolyticus, and these are considered to be potential sccmec donors when new clones of mrsa arise. an outbreak of mrsa occurred at a neonatal  intensive-care unit, and the isolates were all of sequence type (st) 45, as characterized by multilocus sequence typing, but were not typeable with respect to sccmec types i, ii, iii or iv. during the same time period, methicillin-resistant s. haemolyticus (mrsh) isolates identified in blood cultures at the same ward were found to be genotypically homogenous by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, and did not carry a type i, ii, iii or iv sccmec either. thus, the hypothesis was raised that an sccmec of mrsh had been transferred to a methicillin-susceptible s. aureus strain and thereby created a new clone of mrsa that caused the outbreak. this study showed that mrsa from the  outbreak carried a ccrc and a class c mec complex that was also found among mrsh  isolates. partial sequencing of the mec complexes showed more than 99% homology,  indicative of a common type v sccmec. this finding may provide evidence for a recent horizontal transfer of an sccmec from mrsh to an identified potential recipient, an st45 methicillin-susceptible s. aureus strain, thereby creating a new clone of mrsa that caused the outbreak.

TI  == high in vitro antimicrobial activity of synthetic antimicrobial peptidomimetics against staphylococcal biofilms.
AB  == objectives: the aim of the study was to investigate the antimicrobial effect of different antibiotics and synthetic antimicrobial peptidomimetics (samps) on staphylococcal biofilms. methods: biofilms of six staphylococcal strains (two staphylococcus haemolyticus, two staphylococcus epidermidis and two staphylococcus aureus isolates) were grown for 24 h in microtitre plates. they were washed and treated for 24 h with different concentrations of linezolid, tetracycline, rifampicin and vancomycin and four different samps. after treatment, the redox indicator alamar blue was used to quantify metabolic activity of bacteria in biofilms, and confocal laser scanning microscopy with live/dead staining was used to further elucidate any effects. results: at mic levels, rifampicin and tetracycline showed a marked reduction of metabolic activity in the s. epidermidis and s. haemolyticus biofilm. linezolid had a moderate effect and vancomycin had a poor effect. mic x10 and mic x100 improved the antimicrobial activity of all antibiotics, especially vancomycin. however, metabolic activity was not completely suppressed in strong biofilm-producing strains. at mic x10, the three most effective samps (ltx5, ltx9 and ltx10) were able to completely eliminate metabolic activity in the s. epidermidis and s. haemolyticus biofilms, which was also confirmed by complete cell death using confocal laser scanning microscopy investigations. although none of the ltx samps could fully suppress metabolic activity in the s. aureus biofilm, their effect was superior to all tested antibiotics. conclusions: samps had superior antimicrobial activity in staphylococcal biofilms compared with conventional antibiotics and are potential new therapeutic agents for biofilm-associated infections.

TI  == diversity of staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec structures in methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus haemolyticus  strains among outpatients from four countries.
AB  == in staphylococci, methicillin (meticillin) resistance (mr) is mediated by the acquisition of the meca gene, which is carried on the size and composition variable staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (sccmec). mr has been extensively studied in staphylococcus aureus, but little is known about mr coagulase-negative staphylococci (mr-cons). here, we describe the diversity of sccmec structures in  mr-cons from outpatients living in countries with contrasting environments: algeria, mali, moldova, and cambodia. their mr-cons nasal carriage rates were 29, 17, 11, and 31%, respectively. ninety-six mr-cons strains, comprising 75 (78%) staphylococcus epidermidis strains, 19 (20%) staphylococcus haemolyticus strains, 1 (1%) staphylococcus hominis strain, and 1 (1%) staphylococcus cohnii strain, were analyzed. eighteen different sccmec types were observed, with 28 identified  as type iv (29%), 25 as type v (26%), and 1 as type iii (1%). fifteen strains (44%) were untypeable for their sccmec. thirty-four percent of mr-cons strains contained multiple ccr copies. type iv and v sccmec were preferentially associated with s. epidermidis and s. haemolyticus, respectively. mr-cons constitute a widespread and highly diversified mr reservoir in the community.

TI  == pathogenic microbiological flora recovered from ear, nose and throat specimens in a regional hospital in kosovo.
AB  == background: to investigate the recovery of pathogenic bacteria, fungi and parasites isolated from ear, nose and throat specimens in large population group  in a secondary health care institution. methods: retrospective study results of all microbiologic cultures submitted from the outpatient clinic of a large, secondary health care practice, for the time period january 2001 until december 2005 were identified from a microbiologic specimen database. the results from these cultures were entered into a database, tabulating site from which the culture was taken, from whom the material was sent and the type of organism recovered. results: from a total of 17,362 specimens, 88% results in the normal bacterial flora. remaining 12% were pathological bacterial, fungal and parasite flora: 1218 from ear specimens, 376 from nose and. 474 from throat specimens. in  40% of cases material was sent by primary health care provider, in 52% of cases material was taken during systematic screening and only in about 8% the material  was sent from an ent specialist. the most frequent pathogens isolated from ear specimens are staphylococcus saprophiticus and aureus, 24.6 and 17.7%, followed by pseudomonas auriginosa in 13.2%; from nose specimens the most often isolated pathogenic bacteria is staphylococcus aureus in 52.4%, streptococcus spp. in 16%  and branhamella in 13% of nose specimens. from the throat specimens staphylococcus aureus in 48.7%, enterococcus in 13.3%, streptococcus beta-haemolyticus gr. a in 11.8% and streptococcus beta-haemolyticus gr. b in 8.4% of cases. conclusions: staphylococcus spp, pseudomonas, escherichia and streptococcus spp. are leading pathogens from ear, nose and throat specimens, so  further investigation on appropriate antibiotics use and bacterial resistance will be welcome.

TI  == susceptibility of common aerobic pathogens to tigecycline: results of a surveillance study in germany.
AB  == tigecycline is a novel antimicrobial agent for parenteral use encompassing a broad spectrum of bacterial pathogens, including multi-resistant organisms. here, we report the results of the first nationwide surveillance trial that was conducted in order to evaluate the susceptibility of bacterial isolates to tigecycline in a european country prior to its clinical use. a total of 2,610 gram-positive and gram-negative organisms recovered from hospitalized patients were tested. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined using the microdilution method. all enterococci, staphylococci (including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus; mrsa), and streptococci tested were  tigecycline-susceptible, except one isolate of staphylococcus haemolyticus. among the gram-negative bacteria, 100% of the escherichia coli isolates (including extended spectrum beta-lactamase [esbl]-producers) were tigecycline-susceptible,  while about 10% of the enterobacter cloacae and klebsiella pneumoniae isolates were resistant. based on the results of this surveillance study, tigecycline may  represent a suitable option most notably for the empiric treatment of bacterial mixed infections, including in clinical situations in which multi-resistant organisms are suspected.

TI  == history and evolution of antibiotic resistance in coagulase-negative staphylococci: susceptibility profiles of new anti-staphylococcal agents.
AB  == coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns) are a heterogenous group of gram-positive  cocci that are widespread commensals among mammalia. unlike their coagulase-positive counterpart, staphylococcus aureus, cns produce few virulence  patterns and normally refrain from invading tissue. yet, not only can cns cause infections in normal host tissue, but modern medicine has also seen their rise as opportunists that display adherence to medical device materials to produce a protective biofilm. cns have historically been more resistant to antimicrobials,  including the beta-lactam antibiotics, than s. aureus and some hospitals reveal rates of oxacillin resistance in cns approaching 90%. cross resistance to non-beta-lactam agents has been a recurrent theme over the past 40 years in the cns. thus, there has been a pressing need for newer antimicrobial agents with good antistaphylococcal activity. those new agents tend to have excellent antistaphylococcal activity include daptomycin, linezolid, oritavancin, telavancin, tigecycline, dalbavancin, new quinolones, and ceftibiprole, several of which have unique mechanisms of action. the mic(9)(0) for these new compounds  typically ranges from 0.5-4 mug/ml. staphylococcal biofilm formation is quite common in cns infections and markedly increases the mic for most older antimicrobials. several of the newer agents offer some promise of penetration of  biofilm to inhibit or kill adherent staphylococci. cns will likely remain a major cause of infections in the modern age, evolve further antimicrobial resistance mechanisms, and require development of newer antimicrobials for curative therapy.

TI  == a three-year surveillance of nosocomial infections by methicillin-resistant staphylococcus haemolyticus in newborns reveals the disinfectant as a possible reservoir.
AB  == objective: study of the clonality of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus haemolyticus responsible of epidemic infections in a neonatal intensive care unit. patients and methods: methicillin-resistant staphylococcus haemolyticus isolates were collected during the period from march 2004 to november 2006, from  newborns, the clean hands of nurses and from disinfectant bottles used in the unit. molecular typing by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) was achieved for all isolates. results: forty-six isolates of s. haemolyticus resistant to methicillin were collected from 42 newborns, the hand of two nurses and from two  disinfectant bottles used in the unit. pfge analysis revealed five types (a, b, c, d and e) among newborns isolates. types a and b were predominant. nurses' isolates revealed pfge types similar to types a and b. disinfectant isolates were of type b. qaca/b pcr analysis revealed that the majority of type b isolates contain the disinfectant resistance gene qaca/b. no isolate of type a possessed this gene. conclusion: these results suggest that mrsh neonatal infections are caused by a limited number of clones. clone b was able to survive in disinfectant bottles and to conserve its ability to infect newborns. we therefore conclude that the disinfectant can serve as a reservoir for mrsh and point out the need to control all disinfectants used in a neonatal intensive care unit.

TI  == evaluation of three different molecular markers for the detection of staphylococcus aureus by polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == the aim of this study was to target three genes of staphylococcus aureus-fmha (coding for a factor of unknown function), catalase and fema (coding for a factor essential for methicillin resistance) to establish and validate a pcr assay for the detection of this pathogen. two pairs of primers were designed for fmha and one pair each for catalase and fema genes. the pcr assays were standardized and found to give specific amplicons under similar reaction parameters. target specificity of the primers was confirmed by dna sequencing of the amplicons. while the initial inclusivity and exclusivity test reactions were in agreement in case of three of the primer pairs, one pair based on fmha gene produced a non-specific product with a template dna used in exclusivity test reactions. forty-five strains of s. aureus were subjected to these pcr assays for their evaluation. three among the four pairs of primers, one against each gene detected all the 45 strains precisely whereas one of the pcr assays using primers targeting the fmha gene did not generate the specific amplicon with several of the strains. seven unidentified strains of gram-positive cocci subjected to these pcr assays produced negative results for each culture. six of the strains were identified as staphylococcus haemolyticus and one strain as staphylococcus arlettae by 16s ribosomal gene analyses. all the three assay systems showed a detection limit of 100 cells per 20mul reaction assay. for validation of these assay systems, 80 coded samples of 11% skimmed milk spiked with different pathogens were received from niced (national institute of cholera and enteric diseases), kolkata and subjected to these pcr assays. all the three assays could  detect s. aureus correctly in two of the samples. amongst 150 raw milk samples, 36 (24%) were found positive for s. aureus. we conclude that fmha, catalase and fema genes are conserved in s. aureus and, therefore, could be used as specific targets for its detection and identification by pcr. the protocols developed herein could be used for rapid and specific detection of this pathogen in food, clinical and environmental samples, especially milk.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance and heat sensitivity of oxacillin-resistant, meca-positive staphylococcus spp. from unpasteurized milk.
AB  == eight staphylococcus spp. carrying the meca gene were isolated from oxacillin enrichments of 70 unpasteurized milk samples. the isolates were identified as five staphylococcus epidermidis, two staphylococcus lentus, and one staphylococcus haemolyticus. no meca-positive staphylococcus aureus were isolated. all isolates carried genes for other antibiotic resistances in addition to meca. the results establish that meca-carrying coagulase-negative staphylococcus spp. in unpasteurized milk have the potential to be a reservoir of other genes encoding antimicrobial resistance. two s. epidermidis isolates with qaca/b genes were resistant to benzalkonium chloride. decimal reduction times (d-values) for the meca-staphylococcus spp. at 56 degrees c in whole milk ranged  from 1.46 to 2.82 min. d-values at 56 degrees c for nine s. aureus milk isolates  ranged from 10.8 to 20.1 min. heat treatments intended to control s. aureus may be an effective means to protect consumers of milk and dairy products. contact with or consumption of milk and dairy products that have not been heat treated may lead to the spread of antimicrobial resistance genes in staphylococcus spp. to animals and humans.

TI  == genetic classification and distinguishing of staphylococcus species based on different partial gap, 16s rrna, hsp60, rpob, soda, and tuf gene sequences.
AB  == the analysis of 16s rrna gene sequences has been the technique generally used to  study the evolution and taxonomy of staphylococci. however, the results of this method do not correspond to the results of polyphasic taxonomy, and the related species cannot always be distinguished from each other. thus, new phylogenetic markers for staphylococcus spp. are needed. we partially sequenced the gap gene (approximately 931 bp), which encodes the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, for 27 staphylococcus species. the partial sequences had 24.3 to 96% interspecies homology and were useful in the identification of staphylococcal species (f. layer, b. ghebremedhin, w. konig, and b. konig, j. microbiol. methods 70:542-549, 2007). the dna sequence similarities of the partial staphylococcal gap sequences were found to be lower than those of 16s rrna (approximately 97%),  rpob (approximately 86%), hsp60 (approximately 82%), and soda (approximately 78%). phylogenetically derived trees revealed four statistically supported groups: s. hyicus/s. intermedius, s. sciuri, s. haemolyticus/s. simulans, and s.  aureus/epidermidis. the branching of s. auricularis, s. cohnii subsp. cohnii, and the heterogeneous s. saprophyticus group, comprising s. saprophyticus subsp. saprophyticus and s. equorum subsp. equorum, was not reliable. thus, the phylogenetic analysis based on the gap gene sequences revealed similarities between the dendrograms based on other gene sequences (e.g., the s. hyicus/s. intermedius and s. sciuri groups) as well as differences, e.g., the grouping of s. arlettae and s. kloosii in the gap-based tree. from our results, we propose the partial sequencing of the gap gene as an alternative molecular tool for the taxonomical analysis of staphylococcus species and for decreasing the possibility of misidentification.

TI  == structural and biological characterization of a capsular polysaccharide produced  by staphylococcus haemolyticus.
AB  == the dna sequence of the genome of staphylococcus haemolyticus jcsc1435 revealed a putative capsule operon composed of 13 genes in tandem. the first seven genes (capabcdefg(sh)) showed > or = 57% similarity with the staphylococcus aureus cap5 or cap8 locus. however, the caphijklm(sh) genes are unique to s. haemolyticus and include genes encoding a putative flippase, an aminotransferase, two glycosyltransferases, and a transcriptional regulator. capsule-like material was  readily apparent by immunoelectron microscopy on bacteria harvested in the postexponential phase of growth. electron micrographs of a jcsc1435 mutant with a deleted cap region lacked the capsule-like material. both strains produced small  amounts of surface-associated material that reacted with antibodies to polyglutamic acid. s. haemolyticus cap genes were amplified from four of seven clinical isolates of s. haemolyticus from humans, and three of these strains produced a serologically cross-reactive capsular polysaccharide. in vitro assays  demonstrated that the acapsular mutant strain showed greater biofilm formation but was more susceptible to complement-mediated opsonophagocytic killing than the parent strain. structural characterization of capsule purified from s. haemolyticus strain jcsc1435 showed a trisaccharide repeating unit: -3-alpha-l-fucnac-3-(2-nac-4-n-asp-2,4,6-trideoxy-beta-d-glc)-4-alpha-d-glcnac-.  this structure is unique among staphylococcal polysaccharides in that its composition includes a trideoxy sugar residue with aspartic acid as an n-acyl substituent.

AB  == coagulase-negative staphylococcus spp. was considered nonpathogenic until the emergence of multiresistance and the demonstration of their participation as infectious agents. in brazil, oxacillin resistance may be present in over 80% of  isolates, and the clinical and laboratory standards institute standardized a disk-diffusion method to predict this resistance in staphylococcus. the aim of this study was to evaluate the variability among commercial disks of oxacillin (1 microg) and cefoxitin (30 microg) widely used in clinical laboratories of microbiology, compared with meca gene and minimum inhibitory concentration (mic)  of oxacillin. the use of oxacillin and cefoxitin disks simultaneously allowed the detection of important differences, particularly, in less frequent species such as s. cohnii, s. haemolyticus, s. saprophyticus, and s. sciuri. disks of cefoxitin of the brand 2 displayed good correlation with the meca gene (98.7%) and oxacillin mic (97.8%), while major discrepancies were observed using disks of brand 1. one of the critical points in the diffusion disk test is the quality of  the disks: the use of better quality disks associated with molecular methods lead to better results to define the best antibiotic therapy.

TI  == staphplex system for rapid and simultaneous identification of antibiotic resistance determinants and panton-valentine leukocidin detection of staphylococci from positive blood cultures.
AB  == phenotypic methods take several days for identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of staphylococcal isolates after gram-positive cocci in clusters (gpcc) are observed in positive blood cultures. we developed and validated a staphplex system that amplifies and detects 18 gene targets simultaneously in 1 reaction for species-level identification of staphylococci, detection of genes encoding panton-valentine leukocidin (pvl), and antimicrobial  resistance determinants of staphylococci. the staphplex system was compared to phenotypic methods for organism identification and antimicrobial resistance detection for positive blood culture specimens in which gpcc were observed. among a total of 360 gpcc specimens, 273 (75.8%), 37 (10.3%), 37 (10.3%), 1 (0.3%), 3 (0.8%), and 9 (2.5%) were identified by staphplex as coagulase-negative staphylococcus (cons), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), methicillin-susceptible s. aureus (mssa), or mixed infections of cons and mrsa, cons and mssa, or nonstaphylococci, respectively, with an overall accuracy of 91.7%. the 277 cons-containing specimens were further identified to the species level as containing 203 (73.3%) staphylococcus epidermidis isolates, 10 (3.6%) staphylococcus haemolyticus isolates, 27 (9.7%) staphylococcus hominis isolates,  1 (0.4%) staphylococcus lugdunensis isolate, and 36 (13.0%) other cons isolates,  with an overall accuracy of 80.1% compared to an api staph test and cdc reference identification. numerous very major errors were noticed when detection of aaca, erma, ermc, tetm, and tetk was used to predict in vitro antimicrobial resistance, but relatively few major errors were observed when the absence of these genes was used to predict susceptibility. the staphplex system demonstrated 100% sensitivity and specificity, ranging from 95.5% to 100.0% when used for staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec typing and pvl detection. staphplex provides simultaneous staphylococcal identification and detection of pvl and antimicrobial resistance determinants within 5 h, significantly shortening the time needed for phenotypic identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing.

AB  == a comparative study was performed to examine the respective accuracy of 16s rdna  sequencing and of the commercial biochemical assay id32 staph (biomerieux, marcy  l'etoile, france) in the identification of 232 staphylococcal samples representing 20 species and subspecies isolated from 367 dogs. notable differences in species distribution were observed by comparing genotypic and phenotypic data. partial sequencing of 16s rdna resulted in an unambiguous identification of 226 (97.4%) of the isolates, whereas the phenotypic approach resulted in a correct diagnosis of 162 (69.8%) of the isolates. statistical agreement between genotypic and phenotypic identification of staphylococci was substantial (kappa coefficient of 0.6-0.8) for staphylococcus aureus, s. hominis, s. warneri, s. cohnii subsp. urealyticus, and s. simulans, and "almost perfect" (kappa coefficient of 0.8-1) for s. intermedius, s. epidermidis, s. equorum, s. haemolyticus, s. sciuri, and s. kloosi. no agreement above that expected by chance (kappa coefficient=0) was observed for s. schleiferi subsp. coagulans, which was either confounded with s. intermedius and s. capitis, or categorized as unacceptable by the biochemical assay. given the growing importance of this pathogen in veterinary medicine and its frequent misidentification with related staphylococci, a pcr-rflp approach producing a s. schleiferi-specific restriction profile was developed. this fast and reliable assay represents a valuable tool in assisting in the monitoring of this pathogen.

TI  == in vitro activity of antimicrobial agents against oxacillin resistant staphylococci with special reference to staphylococcus haemolyticus.
AB  == one hundred and sixty seven isolates of staphylococci isolated from the inpatients of a tertiary care referral hospital in south india were speciated and activity of oxacillin, glycopeptides, linezolid and quinupristin/dalfopristin against these isolates was tested by broth microdilution method. of the 114 coagulase negative staphylococci (cons), 49.1 % were s. haemolyticus, isolated predominantly from urine (64.6%), while the rest belonged to 11 other species. more than half the isolates of s. aureus (52.8%) and 68.4% of the cons were oxacillin resistant. all the strains were uniformly susceptible to vancomycin, linezolid and quinupristin/dalfopristin; but 25.6% isolates of s. haemolyticus showed reduced susceptibility to teicoplanin (mic: 8-16 mg/l). our study demonstrates the high prevalence of oxacillin resistance among hospital isolates  of s. aureus and cons in india. vancomycin, along with the newer agents like linezolid and quinupristin/dalfopristin remains the drug of choice for treating multi drug resistant staphylococcal infections.

TI  == multiple staphylococcal cassette chromosomes and allelic variants of cassette chromosome recombinases in staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci from norway.
AB  == we investigated the nature of the staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (sccmec) elements and cognate insertion sites in a collection of 42 clinical staphylococcal isolates of various species from norway. the ccr and mec genes and the attachment sites (attl/attr) were identified by pcr, southern blot hybridization, and dna sequencing. we found 10 possibly new sccmec types and one  previously unreported variant of sccmec type iii (mec complex a, ccrab3, and ccrc7) in staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus haemolyticus, and staphylococcus hominis. eleven of 42 strains contained multiple copies of ccr, suggesting the presence of mosaic structures composed of multiple scc elements. s. haemolyticus contained ccrab2 genes identical to those in s. aureus sccmec type iv but lacked is1272 and mec regulators. two new allelic ccr variants, ccrc6 and ccrc7, were identified. also, the presumed functional version of ccrb1 was found in a meca-positive s. hominis strain and in meca-negative s. epidermidis and s. hominis strains. only minor differences in direct repeats in the left and  right boundaries (attr/attl) were observed, while there was more variation in the inverted repeats. coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons) contained several representatives of different ccr complexes and thus seemed to harbor multiple or  composite new types of sccmec. the enormous diversity observed in the sccmec elements implies a large sccmec reservoir in cons.

TI  == [antimicrobial resistance and molecular epidemiology of coagulase-negative staphylococci in chengdu].
AB  == objective: to investigate the antimicrobial resistance and molecular prevalence of coagulase-negative staphylococcus (cons) in chengdu. methods: disk diffusion method was used to test antimicrobial resistance of 2038 cons isolated from 15 hospitals and 6 cdcs (center for disease control and prevention) in chengdu, the  results were interpreted according to the guideline of national committee for clinical laboratory standards. cons were typed with plasmid and pfge (pulsed field gel electrophoresis) profiles. results: (1) s. epidermidis, s. haemolyticus, and s. saprophyticus accounted for 82.2% of the cons isolated from  chengdu, with different constituent ratio of cons among patients, medical staff,  sick children and normal people. (2) cons resisted to one or more antimicrobial agents with resistance rate of 80.4% . cons resisted highly to smz, penicillin-g, ampicillin, erythromycin, tmp-smz and tetracycline, but were susceptible to vancomycin, norfloxacin and amikacin. 25 antimicrobial resistance profiles were acquired, and amp + ery + p-g + smz, amp + gen + str + tet, amp + p-g + tet, chl  + ery + p-g + smz + ts, ern + nov + p-g + smz + ts, as well as p-g + smz + ts were main profiles. the main antimicrobial resistance profiles of cons isolated from patients, medical staff, sick children and normal people had some differences, but the antimicrobial resistance of main biochemical subtypes was similar a lot. (3) plasmid prevalence of cons was 72.9%, with 12 plasmid profiles ( i -h ) of all cons. the main profiles were i , u , and mi type, which accounted for 80.1% of 1485 cons with plasmid. (4) 29 pfge genotypes and 112 subtypes were  found in 2038 strains. genotypes a, b, c, d and e were the predominant types in cons from patients, medical staff, sick children and normal people and contributed 89.1% to 2038 cons. genotypes a was the major type and had similar constituent ratio in cons from 4 sources, and no enough similarity of constituent ratio in other dominant genotypes. conclusion: antimicrobial resistance rate of cons was very high in chengdu and multi-resistance existed in various populations generally. high homology was found in cons from different sources, especially from medical staff as well as sick children and infant, and a latent inter-transmission may occur in these populations. so it was no time to delay the monitoring and investigation of antimicrobial resistance and molecular epidemiology for cons in chengdu.

TI  == occurrence, species distribution, antimicrobial resistance and clonality of methicillin- and erythromycin-resistant staphylococci in the nasal cavity of domestic animals.
AB  == beta-lactams and macrolides are important antibiotics for treatment of staphylococcal infections in both humans and animals. the aim of the study was to investigate the occurrence, species distribution and clonality of methicillin- and erythromycin-resistant staphylococci in the nasal cavity of dogs, horses, pigs, and cattle in denmark. nasal swabs were collected from a total of 400 animals, including 100 individuals of each species. methicillin- and erythromycin-resistant staphylococci were isolated on selective media, identified by 16s rdna sequencing, and typed by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (pfge). methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (mrcons) harbouring meca were isolated from horses (50%) and dogs (13%), but not from food animals. the species identified were s. haemolyticus (n=21), s. vitulinus (n=19), s. sciuri (n=13), s. epidermidis (n=8), and s. warneri (n=2). meca-mediated methicillin resistance in s. vitulinus was described for the first time. methicillin-resistant s. aureus was not detected. pfge analysis revealed the presence of specific mrcons clones in samples originating from the same veterinary hospital or equine farm. erythromycin-resistant s. aureus (ersa) was detected in 38% of pigs and all isolates harboured a constitutively expressed erm(c) gene. the vast majority (37/38) of pigs carrying ersa originated from a farm characterized by frequent use of macrolides. most ersa isolates (28/38) displayed indistinguishable or closely related pfge patterns, indicating clonal distribution within the farm. based on the analysis of data on antimicrobial consumption, the occurrence of mrcons in companion animals and that of ersa in pigs reflected national and local patterns of antimicrobial usage.

TI  == the investigation of staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci nasal carriage among patients undergoing haemodialysis.
AB  == the frequency of nasal staphylococcal colonization among haemodialysed patients was investigated. the swabs were collected in 1998 and 2004 from 28 and 43 patients, respectively. staphylococcus aureus colonization rates were 57.1% and 27.9% in 1998 and 2004, respectively. twenty-six coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns) isolates were cultured: s. epidermidis (21), s. lugdunensis (2), single s.  haemolyticus, s. warneri, and s. capitits isolates. one s. aureus and 10 cns isolates were methicillin resistant. the methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) was resistant to beta-lactams, tetracycline, and harbored the pvl gene encoding the panton-valentine leukocidin. the decrease in s. aureus colonization at 6-year interval was observed. the presence of the pvl gene and a favorable antibiotic susceptibility pattern of the mrsa suggest that the isolate was a member of community-acquired mrsa (ca-mrsa). concluding, screening of haemodialysed patients for staphylococcal colonization accompanied by characterization of cultured isolates is important to understand its epidemiology and to develop infection prevention measures and treatment strategies.

TI  == fusidic acid resistance, mediated by fusb, in bovine coagulase-negative staphylococci.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to determine the occurrence of fusidic acid resistance, mediated by the fusb gene, among coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons) isolated from bovine mastitis. methods: a total of 113 cons isolates were  screened for susceptibility to fusidic acid by using a disc diffusion method. the fusb gene was detected by using pcr and subsequent dna sequencing. the localization of fusb was determined by hybridization. results: the fusb gene was  detected in 3 of 11 fusidic acid-resistant bovine cons isolates. the organization of the fusb downstream region on a 40 kb plasmid in a staphylococcus haemolyticus isolate (288/96) was highly similar to the previously reported organization of fusb on plasmid pub101 from a staphylococcus aureus isolate of human origin. the  fusb gene was chromosomally located in the remaining two isolates. conclusions: fusidic acid resistance mediated by fusb is not the dominant resistance mechanism in fusidic acid-resistant cons studied in this work. the similarity between the organization of the fusb downstream region in s. haemolyticus (isolate 288/96) and on plasmid pub101 from an s. aureus isolate of human origin indicates a common ancestral origin of these genes.

TI  == a new evolutionary variant of the streptogramin a resistance protein, vga(a)lc, from staphylococcus haemolyticus with shifted substrate specificity towards lincosamides.
AB  == we found a new variant of the streptogramin a resistance gene, vga(a)lc, in clinical isolates of staphylococcus haemolyticus resistant to lincomycin and clindamycin but susceptible to erythromycin and in which no relevant lincosamide  resistance gene was detected. the gene vga(a)lc, differing from the gene vga(a) at the protein level by seven amino acid substitutions, was present exclusively in s. haemolyticus strains resistant to both lincosamides and streptogramin a (ls(a) phenotype). antibiotic resistance profiles of the atp-binding cassette (abc) proteins vga(a)(lc) and vga(a) in the antibiotic-susceptible host s. aureus rn4220 were compared. it was shown that vga(a)lc conferred resistance to both lincosamides and streptogramin a, while vga(a) conferred significant resistance to streptogramin a only. detailed analysis of the seven amino acid substitutions, distinguishing the two related abc proteins with different substrate specificities, identified the substrate-recognizing site: four clustered substitutions (l212s, g219v, a220t, and g226s) in the spacer between the two atp-binding cassettes altered the substrate specificity and constituted the lincosamide-streptogramin a resistance phenotype. a transport experiment with radiolabeled lincomycin demonstrated that the mechanism of lincosamide resistance in s. haemolyticus was identical to that of the reported macrolide-streptogramin  b resistance conferred by msr(a).

AB  == testing 54 strains of staphylococci (staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, s. haemolyticus, s. warneri, s. hominis, s. capitis) revealed that s. aureus in contrast to coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns) is more resistant to bactoriocidal action of human thrombodefensins (resistance index: 60.3 vs 25.6%), less hydrophilicolipophilic balance-hlb: -0.42 vs -0.64) and less charged (x-potential: -32.4 vs -35.6 mv). in groups of staphylococci (s. aureus and cns)  correlation links of bacterial resistance to human thrombodefensins with their hlb and x-potential (r=-0.32...-0.36). by in vitro experiments, it was shown that 5 passages of staphylococci in meat-peptonic broth with human thrombodefensins (50 mkg protein/ml) lead to adaptation of bacteria followed by the formation of resistance to cationic peptides from thrombocytes, a decrease of hydrophobicity and x-potencial. the role of physico-chemical properties in providing thrombodefensin-resistance of staphylococci as a developmental factor of infectious-and-inflammatory process and persistence of bacteria was confirmed with salmonella infection.

TI  == automated systems in the identification and determination of methicillin resistance among coagulase negative staphylococci.
AB  == coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons) are an important cause of nosocomial bacteremia, specially in patients with indwelling devices or those submitted to invasive medical procedures. the identification of species and the accurate and rapid detection of methicillin resistance are directly dependent on the quality of the identification and susceptibility tests used, either manual or automated.  the objective of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of two automated systems--microscan and vitek--in the identification of cons species and determination of susceptibility to methicillin, considering as gold standard the  biochemical tests and the characterization of the meca gene by polymerase chain reaction, respectively. microscan presented better results in the identification  of cons species (accuracy of 96.8 vs 78.8%, respectively); isolates from the following species had no precise identification: staphylococcus haemolyticus, s.  simulans, and s. capitis. both systems were similar in the characterization of methicillin resistance. the higher discrepancies for gene mec detection were observed among species other than s. epidermidis (s. hominis, s. saprophyticus, s. sciuri, s. haemolyticus, s. warneri, s. cohnii), and those with borderline mics.

TI  == automated ribotyping to distinguish the different non sau/ non sep staphylococcal emerging pathogens in orthopedic implant infections.
AB  == several species belonging to staphylococcus genus, other than staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis (non sau/ non sep species), exhibit increasing abilities as opportunistic pathogens in the colonisation of periprosthetic tissues. consequently, the availability of means for accurate identification is crucial to assess the pathogenic characteristics and to clarify clinical relevance of the individual species. here, 146 clinical staphylococcal isolates belonging to non sau/ non sep species from prosthesis-associated orthopedic infections were analyzed by conventional enzymatic galleries and by automated ribotyping. twelve different species were recognised: s. capitis, s. caprae, s. cohnii, s. equorum, s. haemolyticus, s. hominis, s. lugdunensis, s. pasteuri, s. sciuri, s. simulans, s. warneri, s. xylosus. ribotype identifications were compared with the phenotypes obtained by the api 20 staph system and/or id 32 staph system. id 32 staph profiles were more consistent with  ribotyping results than api staph profiles. across the different staphylococcal species investigated, correct identifications with api staph were 45%, while with id 32 staph they were 59%. it has, however, to be mentioned that id 32 staph was  mostly applied to discriminate unmatched ribotyping and api staph identifications, thus to a subpopulation of strains with ""atypical"" metabolic profile. automated ribotyping provided a correct identification for 91% of the isolates. these results confirm automated ribotyping as a convenient rapid technique, still subject to improvements, which will accurately and rapidly recognise the newly emerging staphylococcal pathogens in implant-related orthopedic infections.

AB  == background: methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and coagulase-negative staphylococcus infections are a worldwide concern. currently,  these isolates have also shown resistance to vancomycin, the last therapy used in these cases. it has been observed that quinones and other related compounds exhibit antibacterial activity. this study evaluated the antibacterial activity,  toxicity and in vivo dermal irritability of lapachol extracted from tabebuia avellanedae and derivatives against methicillin-resistant staphylococcal isolates. in addition, its mechanism of action was also analyzed. methods: the compounds beta-lapachone, 3-hydroxy beta n lapachone and alpha-lapachone were tested to determine the mic values against methicillin-resistant s. aureus, s. epidermidis and s. haemolyticus strains, being the two last ones hetero-resistant to vancomycin. experiments of protein synthesis analysis to investigate the naphthoquinones action were assessed. in vitro toxicity to eukaryotic bsc-40 african green monkey kidney cell cultures and in vivo primary dermal irritability in healthy rabbits were also performed. results: the compounds tested showed antibacterial activity (mics of 8, 4/8 and 64/128 microg/ml to beta-lapachone, 3-hydroxy beta n lapachone and alpha-lapachone, respectively), but no bactericidal activity was observed (mbc > 512 microg/ml for all compounds). although it has been observed toxic effect in eukaryotic cells, the compounds were shown to be atoxic when applied as topic preparations in healthy rabbits. no inhibition of proteins synthesis was observed. conclusion: our results suggest that quinones could be used in topic preparations against wound infections caused by staphylococci, after major investigation of the pharmacological properties of  the compounds. studies about the use of these compounds on tumoral cells could be carried on, due to their effect in eukaryotic cells metabolism.

TI  == identification and molecular characterization of mannitol salt positive, coagulase-negative staphylococci from nasal samples of medical personnel and students.
AB  == the identification of mannitol salt positive, coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns) is often disregarded when staphylococcus aureus is screened in clinical samples using mannitol salt agar. however, the emergence of cns as important human pathogens has indicated that reliable methods for the identification of clinically significant cns are of great importance in understanding the epidemiology of infections caused by them. the identification and molecular characterization of mannitol salt positive cns from nasal samples of medical personnel and students is reported here. a total of 84 mannitol salt positive staphylococcal isolates were obtained from 240 nasal samples, of which 15 were cns. the api staph system classified the cns isolates into six species, and one-third of the isolates were identified with confidence levels of <80 %. 16s-23s rrna intergenic spacer length polymorphism analysis (its-pcr) identified  only two species (staphylococcus haemolyticus and staphylococcus saprophyticus).  this identification was confirmed by antibiotyping, species-specific pcr and pfge. the results from this study indicate that its-pcr is a potentially useful and reliable tool, enabling hospital laboratories to obtain rapid, full and accurate identification of cns at the species level.

TI  == predictive factors of outcome following staphylococcal peritonitis in continuous  ambulatory peritoneal dialysis.
AB  == background and aims: staphylococcus epidermidis and other coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons) are the most common agents of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (capd) peritonitis. episodes caused by staphylococcus aureus  evolve with a high method failure rate while cons peritonitis is generally benign. the purpose of this study was to compare episodes of peritonitis caused by cons species and s. aureus to evaluate the microbiological and host factors that affect outcome. material and methods: microbiological and clinical data were retrospectively studied from 86 new episodes of peritonitis caused by staphylococci species between january 1996 and december 2000 in a university dialysis center. the influence of microbiological and host factors (age, sex, diabetes, use of vancomycin, exchange system and treatment time on capd) was analyzed by logistic regression model. the clinical outcome was classified into two results (resolution and non-resolution). results: the odds of peritonitis resolution were not influenced by host factors. oxacillin susceptibility was present in 30 of 35 s. aureus lineages and 22 of 51 cons (p = 0.001). there were  32 of 52 (61.5%) episodes caused by oxacillin-susceptible and 20 of 34 (58.8%) by oxacillin-resistant lineages resolved (p = 0.9713). of the 35 cases caused by s.  aureus, 17 (48.6%) resolved and among 51 cons episodes 40 (78.4%) resolved. resolution odds were 7.1 times higher for s. epidermidis than s. aureus (p = 0.0278), while other cons had 7.6 times higher odds resolution than s. epidermidis cases (p = 0.052). episodes caused by s. haemolyticus had similar resolution odds to s. epidermidis (p = 0.859). conclusions: s. aureus etiology is an independent factor associated with peritonitis non-resolution in capd, while s. epidermidis and s. haemolyticus have a lower resolution rate than other cons.  possibly the aggressive nature of these agents, particularly s. aureus, can be explained by their recognized pathogenic factors, more than antibiotic resistance.

TI  == whole-genome sequencing of staphylococcus haemolyticus uncovers the extreme plasticity of its genome and the evolution of human-colonizing staphylococcal species.
AB  == staphylococcus haemolyticus is an opportunistic bacterial pathogen that colonizes human skin and is remarkable for its highly antibiotic-resistant phenotype. we determined the complete genome sequence of s.haemolyticus to better understand its pathogenicity and evolutionary relatedness to the other staphylococcal species. a large proportion of the open reading frames in the genomes of s.haemolyticus, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis were conserved in their sequence and order on the chromosome. we identified a region of the bacterial chromosome just downstream of the origin of replication that showed little homology among the species but was conserved among strains within a species. this novel region, designated the "oric environ," likely contributes to  the evolution and differentiation of the staphylococcal species, since it was enriched for species-specific nonessential genes that contribute to the biological features of each staphylococcal species. a comparative analysis of the genomes of s.haemolyticus, s.aureus, and s.epidermidis elucidated differences in  their biological and genetic characteristics and pathogenic potentials. we identified as many as 82 insertion sequences in the s.haemolyticus chromosome that probably mediated frequent genomic rearrangements, resulting in phenotypic diversification of the strain. such rearrangements could have brought genomic plasticity to this species and contributed to its acquisition of antibiotic resistance.

TI  == increase of faecal bifidobacteria due to dietary oligosaccharides induces a reduction of clinically relevant pathogen germs in the faeces of formula-fed preterm infants.
AB  == in a previous study on formula-fed preterm infants, we were able to demonstrate that dietary oligosaccharides (a mixture of 90% galacto-oligosaccharides and 10%  fructo-oligosaccharides in a concentration of 1 g/dl) stimulate the growth of faecal bifidobacteria. in the present explorative analysis of this study, we focus on the effect of the dominance of bifidobacteria on the presence of clinically relevant pathogens (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus haemolyticus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter, klebsiella, proteus, streptococcus group b, clostridium difficile, bacillus subtilis and acinetobacter). conclusion: the data demonstrate that stimulation of bifidobacteria by prebiotic oligosaccharides reduces the presence of clinically relevant pathogens in the faecal flora, indicating that prebiotic substances might have the capacity to protect against enteral infections.

TI  == survey of extreme solvent tolerance in gram-positive cocci: membrane fatty acid changes in staphylococcus haemolyticus grown in toluene.
AB  == we exploited the unique ecological niche of oil fly larval guts to isolate a strain of staphylococcus haemolyticus which may be the most solvent-tolerant gram-positive bacterium yet described. this organism is able to tolerate 100% toluene, benzene, and p-xylene on plate overlays and saturating levels of these solvents in monophasic liquid cultures. a comparison of membrane fatty acids by gas chromatography after growth in liquid media with and without toluene showed that in cells continuously exposed to solvent the proportion of anteiso fatty acids increased from 25.8 to 33.7% while the proportion of 20:0 straight-chain fatty acids decreased from 19.3 to 10.1%. no changes in the membrane phospholipid composition were noted. thus, s. haemolyticus alters its membrane fluidity via fatty acid composition to become more fluid when it is exposed to solvent. this response is opposite that commonly found in gram-negative bacteria, which change  their fatty acids so that the cytoplasmic membrane is less fluid. extreme solvent tolerance in s. haemolyticus is not accompanied by abnormal resistance to anionic or cationic detergents. finally, six strains of staphylococcus aureus and five strains of staphylococcus epidermidis, which were not obtained by solvent selection, also exhibited exceptional solvent tolerance.

AB  == pd-140248 is an isomerase inhibitor and topoisomerase ii inhibitor under development by parke-davis and co as a potential treatment for bacterial infection. although no details of active development have been published in the scientific literature since 1996, in september 1999, the company confirmed that pd-140248 is still in active development [338530]. the compound is one of two new pyrrolidinyl naphthyridines (the other compound being pd-131628) with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, including activity against quinolone-resistant bacteria. pd-140248 demonstrates strong in vitro activity, particularly against gram-positive bacteria, such as quinolone-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (s aureus), staphylococcus epidermidis (s epidermidis), staphylococcus haemolyticus (s haemolyticus), methicillin- and ciprofloxacin-resistant s aureus, streptococcus species, streptococcus pneumoniae (s pneumoniae) and enterococcus faecalis (e faecalis). an mic90 value of 0.015 microg/ml was obtained against haemophilus influenzae (h influenzae) and moraxella catarrhalis [160129]. the (3r,1s) enantiomer, pd-140248, demonstrated a 1- to 10-fold enhanced activity against gram-positive and gram-negative organisms in vitro and in vivo compared to its stereoisomers, and has thus been targeted for further preclinical studies [133377].

TI  == [microbiological external quality assurance program (meqap)--evaluation of results obtained in sanitary epidemiological laboratories in 2002].
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate reliability of identification and determination of sensitivity to antibiotics and chemotherapeutics of some gram positive cocci strains in 34 sanitary-epidemiological stations. all laboratories  engaged in this study received 3 strains: s. aureus (s. aureus sc+ cf+, resistant to methicillin., or s. aureus sc - cf+, sensitive to methicillin), coagulase-negative staphylococci (s. epidermidis or s. haemolyticus or s. saprophyticus) and enterococcus sp. (e. faecalis hlar-positive or e. faecalis hlar-negative or e. faecium or e. gallinarum). all these strains previously were  identified in department of bacteriology of national institute of hygiene. of the 68 staphylococci strains tested, 66 isolates were correctly identified. among the 34 enterococcal strains studied the greatest difficulty in identification was caused by e. gallinarum strain--(8 out of 13 strains were incorrectly recognised). the determination of the sensitivity of the control strains to antibiotics and chemotherapeutic agents, generally was performed correctly in accordance with to the nccls and national recommendations. some incorrect results of the antibiograms were caused by an erroneous interpretation of the zones of inhibition.

TI  == species-level identification of staphylococcal isolates by real-time pcr and melt curve analysis.
AB  == a real-time pcr assay was developed to identify common staphylococcal species. a  single set of consensus primers was designed to amplify a portion of the 16s rrna gene, and a pair of fluorescence resonance energy transfer probes was used to identify species based on the unique melt properties of the probes resulting from sequence variations in the amplicons from each species. nine common staphylococcal strains (s. aureus, s. capitis, s. epidermidis, s. haemolyticus, s. hominis, s. lugdunensis, s. schleiferi, s. simulans, and s. warneri) were used for assay development. the species-specific melting profiles were validated by correctly identifying 36 of 37 coagulase-negative staphylococcal (cons) isolates  identified by ribotyping. in a study of clinical isolates, the pcr/melt curve approach correctly identified 56/56 s. aureus isolates identified by coagulase/protein a latex agglutination. fifty-four cons clinical isolates characterized using the api staph assay were studied, with the pcr/melt curve approach yielding matching identifications for 32/54 (59%). the api staph assay was unable to identify 18 cons isolates, and differing results were obtained for  4 isolates. sequencing of the 22 discrepant or unidentified cons samples revealed that the pcr/melt curve results were correct for all but one isolate. thus, pcr/melt curve analysis achieved a nearly 100% accuracy and performed better than biochemical testing. performance of the pcr/melt curve approach requires less than 2 h after colony selection. this method thus provides a rapid and accurate approach to the identification of staphylococcal species in the clinical laboratory.

TI  == investigation of staphylococcus strains with heterogeneous resistance to glycopeptides in a turkish university hospital.
AB  == background: the hetero-glycopeptide intermediate staphylococci is considered to be the precursor of glycopeptide intermediate staphylococci especially vancomycin intermediate staphylococcus aureus (visa). for this purpose, we aimed to investigate the heterogeneous resistance to glycopeptide and their frequencies in 135 staphylococcus strains. methods: heterogeneous resistance of staphylococcus strains was detected by inoculating the strains onto brain heart infusion agar supplemented with 4 mg/l of vancomycin (bha-v4). agar dilution method was used for determining mics of glycopeptides and population analysis profile was performed for detecting frequency of heterogeneous resistance for the parents of  selected strains on bha-4. results: eight (6%) out of 135 staphylococcus strains  were exhibited heterogeneous resistance to at least one glycopeptide. one (1.2%)  out of 81 s. aureus was found intermediate resistance to teicoplanin (mic 16 mg/l). other seven strains were staphylococcus haemolyticus (13%) out of 54 coagulase negative staphylococci (cons). six of the seven strains were detected heterogeneously reducing susceptibility to vancomycin (mics ranged between 5-8 mg/l) and teicoplanin (mics ranged between 32-64 mg/l), and one s. haemolyticus was found heterogeneous resistance to teicoplanin (mic 32 mg/l). frequencies of heterogeneous resistance were measured being one in 10(6) - 10(7) cfu/ml. mics of vancomycin and teicoplanin for hetero-staphylococci were determined as 2-6 folds  and 3-16 folds higher than their parents, respectively. these strains were isolated from six patients (7%) and two (4%) of health care workers hands. hetero-visa strain was not detected. conclusion: heterogeneous resistance to glycopeptide in cons strains was observed to be significantly more emergent than  those of s. aureus strains (vancomycin p 0.001, teicoplanin, p 0.007). the increase mics of glycopeptide resistance for subpopulations of staphylococci comparing with their parents could be an important clue for recognizing the early steps in the appearance of visa strains. we suggested to screen clinical s. aureus and cons strains, systematically, for the presence of heterogeneously resistance to glycopeptide.

TI  == rapid identification of staphylococcal strains from positive-testing blood culture bottles by internal transcribed spacer pcr followed by microchip gel electrophoresis.
AB  == pcr analysis of the 16s-23s rrna gene internal transcribed spacer (its) followed  by microchip gel electrophoresis (mge) was evaluated for its usefulness in identification of staphylococci. forty its pcr patterns were demonstrated among 228 isolated colonies of staphylococcus aureus: 26 patterns for methicillin-susceptible s. aureus (mssa; 91 strains), 11 patterns for methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa; 99 strains), and 3 patterns for both mssa  and mrsa (38 strains). thirty-seven control strains of coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns) representing 16 species showed unique its pcr patterns (24 patterns) at the species and subspecies levels: two patterns for s. caprae, s. cohnii, s. haemolyticus, and s. saprophyticus; three patterns for s. lugdunensis; four patterns for s. capitis; and one pattern for each of the other cns species.  the combined pcr-mge method was prospectively adapted to the positive blood culture bottles, and this method correctly identified mssa and mrsa in 102 (89%)  of 114 blood cultures positive for s. aureus on the basis of the its pcr patterns. eight its pcr patterns were demonstrated from 166 blood culture bottles positive for cns. the most frequent cns species isolated from blood cultures were s. epidermidis (76%), s. capitis (11%), and s. hominis (8%). overall, all 280 blood culture bottles shown to contain a single staphylococcus species by routine phenotypic methods were correctly identified by the pcr-mge method at the species level, whereas the organism failed to be identified in 8 culture bottles (3%) with mixed flora. the pcr-mge method is useful not only for rapid identification  ( approximately 1.5 h) of staphylococci in positive blood culture bottles, but also for strain delineation of s. aureus.

TI  == methicillin-resistant staphylococcal bacteremia in patients with hematologic malignancies: clinical and microbiological retrospective comparative analysis of  s. haemolyticus, s. epidermidis and s. aureus.
AB  == although staphylococcus haemolyticus (sh) represents an emerging etiology of methicillin-resistant (mr) coagulase-negative staphylococcal nosocomial bacteremia, little is known of clinical significance of this infection. thus, we  performed case-control retrospective comparative analysis of mrsh bacteremias (mrshb), methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis bacteremias (mrseb), and methicillin-resistant s. aureus bacteremias (mrsab) in patients with hematologic  malignancies. most patients in the three groups were neutropenic and had a central venous catheter (cvc) in place at the onset of bacteremia. however, mrshb patients had a cvc in place prior to bacteremia for a time significantly more prolonged than mrseb and mrsab ones (p<0.05). severe sepsis or septic shock were  more common in patients with mrsab as compared with mrshb (p=0.02). nosocomial attributable mortality rate was very low in the 3 study groups (0 to 5.4%) and only two patients developed metastatic infections. overall, reduced susceptibility to teicoplanin was observed in 19 (47.5%) mrsh and in 4 (10%) mrse isolates. resistance to teicoplanin was observed in 6 isolates, all mrsh. reduced susceptibility or resistance to vancomycin was observed in 2 isolates, both mrsh. all mrsa isolates were susceptible to the glycopeptides. comparison between cases of bacteremia in patients with mrsh isolates with reduced susceptibility to teicoplanin and those with susceptible mrsh did not reveal significant differences in the clinical-microbiological response to teicoplanin therapy and outcome. our results seem to suggest that mrshb in hematologic patients is associated with low morbidity and mortality rates. mrsh frequently shows a reduced susceptibility to teicoplanin; however these in vitro data do not seem associated with an unfavorable clinical response to teicoplanin therapy for mrshb in patients with hematologic malignancies.

TI  == three cases of destructive native valve endocarditis caused by staphylococcus lugdunensis.
AB  == described here are three cases of acute native valve endocarditis due to the coagulase-negative pathogen staphylococcus lugdunensis with serious complications. two of the three patients died despite optimal antibiotic therapy  and cardiovascular surgery. these cases demonstrate the aggressive nature of s. lugdunensis and emphasize the importance of identifying coagulase-negative staphylococci to the species level and not considering the isolation of s. lugdunensis from normally sterile body fluids as contamination. on the contrary,  when this organism is found in patients with endocarditis, early surgery should be considered. the possibility that this organism could be misidentified as s. aureus because of "autocoagulation" and that commercial identification systems may misidentify it as s. haemolyticus, s. hominis or s. warneri should also be remembered.

TI  == evaluation of six commercial identification kits for the identification of staphylococcus aureus isolated from bovine mastitis.
AB  == aims: comparison of six commercially available in human medicine well-established slide agglutination systems for the identification of staphylococcus aureus. methods and results: slide agglutination tests were compared with the conventional tube coagulase test, biochemical identification and with the molecular identification by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) amplification of species-specific parts of the gene encoding the 23s rna. systems evaluated included masta-staph (mast diagnostics), staphylase-test (oxoid), staphytect-plus (oxoid), staphyloslide latex (becton dickinson), slidex staph plus (biomerieux) and dry spot staphytect plus (oxoid). a total of 141 staphylococcal strains isolated from cases of bovine mastitis including 90 s. aureus, 14 staphylococcus  epidermidis, 10 staphylococcus warneri, 13 staphylococcus xylosus, 11 staphylococcus haemolyticus and three other coagulase-negative staphylococci were tested with each method. staphylococcus aureus strains were selected by macrorestriction analysis with pulsed field gel electrophoresis (pfge). only genetically unrelated strains were included in the study. the sensitivities and specificities of the test were as follows: masta-staph 86.7 and 90.1%, staphylase-test 78.4 and 85.1%, staphytect-plus 81.1 and 86.5%, staphyloslide latex 77.8 and 84.4%, slidex staph plus 77.8 and 84.4%, dry spot staphytect plus  75.6 and 83.0%. conclusions: the results of this evaluation suggest that the six  slide agglutination methods tested can provide rapid identification of s. aureus  also from bovine mastitis. the sensitivity and specificity seems to be less than  those reported from human s. aureus isolates. significance and impact of the study: this is one of the first comparative reported investigations about the applicability of different commercially available slide agglutination tests for the detection of s. aureus from bovine mastitis using pfge selected clinical isolates.

TI  == [bacterial causes of meningitis in newborns].
AB  == introduction: bacterial meningitis jeopardizes the life of affected newborns and  in survived children often leaves permanent sequels. the sooner the diagnosis is  established and the therapy is started, the more a prosperous outcome can be expected. when the indication is established, lumbar punction should be performed. on the basis of the results of cytological and biochemical analyses of the cerebrospinal fluid (csf) that point to bacterial meningitis, the initial therapy should begin even before the results of bacteriological analyses. it is important to know which causes are to be expected in order to make an adequate choice of antibiotics for initial therapy. the aim of this study is to identify the causes of meningitis, frequency of their occurrings and mortality-rate in the affected newborns. patients and methods: a prospective study was carried out in the paediatric department of the institute from january 1, 1978 to december 31, 2000. patients originated from all parts of yugoslavia. after the establishing of indication, lumbar punction was performed. csf was sent to cytological, biochemical and bacteriological analyses. diagnosis of meningitis was established when at least two criteria of four were fulfilled: 1. isolation of the cause by csf culture; 2. elevation of csf leukocyte count more than 20 with predominance of polymorphonuclear leukocytes; 3. hypoglucorrhachia (glycaemia less than 40 mg  percent or less than 50 percent of glycaemia); 4. identification of bacteria by the gram stain of csf sediment. in 173 newborns the cause of bacterial meningitis was confirmed. results and discussion: causes of meningitis were as follows: e. coli in 46 newborns (n) (26.5%), streptococcus b haemolyticus group b in 35 n (20.2%), k. pneumoniae in 27 n (15.6%), k. oxytoca in 3 n (1.7%), proteus spp in  14 n (8%), salmonella spp in 12 n, pseudomonas spp in 9 n, streptococcus pneumoniae in 9 n, acinetobacter calcoaceticus in 4 n, enterobacter spp in 3 n, l. monocytogenes and serratia marcescens and staphylococcus aureus in 2 n each, and in one n. meningitidis, streptococcus group d, citrobacter, morganella morganii and alkaligenes xilosoxidans. over the period 1978-1987, the most frequent causes were: e. coli (28.2%), sbhb (26.8%) and klebsiella spp (11.3%). over the period 1991-2000, order and frequency of causes had been changed: klebsiella spp (26.8%), e. coli (19.2%), sbhb (14.1%), etc. in addition, new causes appeared, namely: morganella morganii, citrobacter, k. oxitoca and alkaligenes xylosoxidans (table 2). of a total of 173 patients, 52 (30.1%) died:  of 124 children with meningitis caused by gram-negative bacteria, 39 (31.4%) died, and of 49 children with gram-positive bacteria, 13 (26.5%) died (table 1).  comparing the first and the last decade, mortality decreased by only 0.2% (table  2). the explanation might be that the patients came to the institute too late, and after manifestation of resistant and multiresistant causes that obscured the  appropriate selection of antibiotics for initial therapy. the precious time between the onset of the disease and start of the therapy was lost in this way. newborns with bacterial meningitis should be treated only in health institutions  where the intensive care units for newborns exist. conclusion: the most frequent  causes of meningitis are the following: e. coli, sbhb and klebsiella pn. frequency of causes of meningitis changed with time. new uncommon causes have appeared. the mortality-rate remained very high.

TI  == antimicrobial efficacy of a new antibiotic-loaded poly(hydroxybutyric-co-hydroxyvaleric acid) controlled release system.
AB  == objective: failure of orthopaedic devices, mainly femoral hip replacements, due to infection is of increasing medical importance. there is a need for improved antibiotic delivery systems in the treatment of orthopaedic infections and here we have evaluated polyhydroxyalkanoate formulations for their suitability as a constant delivery system for gentamicin. methods: gentamicin was incorporated in  poly(hydroxybutyric-co-hydroxyvalerate) (phbv) with 8% or 12% hydroxyvalerate (hv) content at 2:1 or 5:1 (weight to weight) ratio. in conjunction with an elution study, a scanning electron microscopy and a porosity study were carried out to explore physical characteristics of the complexes before and after the leaching effect. the antibacterial effectiveness of the complexes was analysed in a bacterial adhesion assay using clinical isolates of staphylococcus haemolyticus and staphylococcus aureus. in addition, the polymers were exposed to pooled human blood to test their biocompatibility in both static and dynamic environments. results: we have shown that increasing the hv content from 8% to 12% leads to a faster release of the integrated antibiotic. an increase in antibiotic content enhanced the homogeneity while decreasing the permeability of the complexes and reducing the release rate. a significant reduction in the number of the adherent  s. aureus and gentamicin-resistant s. haemolyticus within a 48 h exposure to our  formulations confirmed the effectiveness of the phbv/gentamicin complexes. finally, these formulations did not alter the haemodynamics of the pooled blood samples after an extended period of time. conclusion: taken together, the phbv/gentamicin formulations may prove to be effective preventive therapeutic modalities in implant-related staphylococcus infections.

TI  == comparison of the bbl chromagar staph aureus agar medium to conventional media for detection of staphylococcus aureus in respiratory samples.
AB  == screening for staphylococcus aureus has become routine in certain patient populations. this study is the first clinical evaluation of the bbl chromagar staph aureus agar (csa) medium (bd diagnostics, sparks, md.) for detection of s.  aureus in nasal surveillance cultures and in respiratory samples from cystic fibrosis (cf) patients. s. aureus colonies appear mauve on csa. other organisms are inhibited or produce a distinctly different colony color. s. aureus was identified from all media by slide coagulase, exogenous dnase, and mannitol fermentation assays. susceptibility testing was performed using the agar dilution method. a total of 679 samples were evaluated. all samples were inoculated onto csa. nasal surveillance cultures were inoculated onto sheep blood agar (sba) (bd  diagnostics), and samples from cf patients were inoculated onto mannitol salt agar (msa) (bd diagnostics). of the 679 samples cultured, 200 organisms produced  a mauve color on csa (suspicious for s. aureus) and 180 were positive for s. aureus on sba or msa. of 200 csa-positive samples 191 were identified as s. aureus. nine mauve colonies were slide coagulase negative and were subsequently identified as staphylococcus lugdunensis (one), staphylococcus epidermidis (three), staphylococcus haemolyticus (one), and corynebacterium species (four). csa improved the ability to detect s. aureus by recovering 12 s. aureus isolates  missed by conventional media. of the 192 s. aureus isolates recovered, 122 were methicillin susceptible and 70 were methicillin resistant. overall, the sensitivity and specificity of csa in this study were 99.5 and 98%, respectively. there was no difference in the performance of the slide coagulase test or in susceptibility testing performed on s. aureus recovered from csa compared to sba  or msa. our data support the use of csa in place of standard culture media for detection of s. aureus in heavily contaminated respiratory samples.

TI  == evaluation of the uro-quick, a new rapid automated system, for the detection of well-characterized antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
AB  == the uro-quick system has been employed to detect antibiotic resistance in genotypically and/or phenotypically well-characterized bacterial species including those that might not be easily identified by routine procedure. in order to achieve full agreement between the antibiotic susceptibility results obtained by the reference method (nccls) and the uro-quick system, the optimal experimental conditions (inoculum size, time of incubation and antibiotic concentration) for each strain to be used by the automatic system were determined. the shorter time periods for generation of correct susceptibility results were 180 min for ampicillin- and ciprofloxacin-resistant escherichia coli and for esbl- and inhibitor-resistant tem (irt)-producing e. coli; 360 min for penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae, as well as for strains with reduced susceptibility to this antibiotic (both intermediate, and resistant isolates). the same time was required to detect erythromycin-resistant pneumococci irrespective of their mechanism of resistance (ribosomal methylation  and efflux-mediated), streptococcus pyogenes exhibiting the three erythromycin-resistance phenotypes (constitutive, inducible and m-type) and klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis and moraxella morganii refractory to third-generation cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, ciprofloxacin and other classes of antimicrobial agents; 480 min for penicillin-resistant, constitutive and inducible oxacillin-resistant (oxa-r) staphylococcus aureus and oxa-r staphylococcus epidermidis. the same period of time was also necessary to find the great majority of drug-resistance exhibited by pseudomonas aeruginosa. teicoplanin-resistant staphylococcus haemolyticus, vancomycin-resistant (vana, vanb, vanc) high-level aminoglycoside-resistant (hlar) enterococcus spp, and imipenem-resistant p. aeruginosa required longer incubation (24 h) to be detected. the results obtained indicate that uro-quick might be a reliable and promising instrument for the correct detection of the above antibiotic resistance markers.

AB  == infections caused by coagulase-negative staphylococci are becoming increasingly important, particularly those of nosocomial origin, as the organisms are frequently multi-resistant. new antimicrobial strategies are needed. the bactericidal activity of a combination of cefpirome with either vancomycin or teicoplanin against 12 strains of methicillin-resistant staphylococci with a decreased susceptibility to teicoplanin was determined in vitro by a time killing method. strains mu3 and mu50 of staphylococcus aureus were also studied. cefpirome (0.125-0.5 x mic) combined with vancomycin (0.25-1 x mic) or teicoplanin (0.125-1 x mic) acted synergically against 12 isolates over 18 h in most cases. a synergistic killing effect was also observed with the mu3 and mu50  strains of glycopeptide-intermediate s. aureus but over a longer period.

AB  == following the discovery in 1992 that resistance to vancomycin could be transferred in vitro from a strain of staphylococcus haemolyticus to staphylococcus aureus, the threat that a similar event could happen in vivo has existed. in 1996, the threat became a reality in japan followed by reports of low-level heteroresistant s. aureus from elsewhere in the world. however, the threat has not gone away; indeed it has become more intimidating within the past  2 years with the isolation of higher-level resistance to vancomycin transferred on a plasmid from enterococcus faecalis. the mechanisms of resistance are different in each of the types of s. aureus with reduced susceptibility to the glycopeptides: in one hetero-vancomycin intermediate-susceptible s. aureus (hvisa) and vancomycin intermediate-susceptible s. aureus (visa), cell wall biosynthesis is altered, hindering glycopeptide reaching its target, and in the other vancomycin-resistant s. aureus (vrsa) the target is altered. this review attempts to place into context the threat posed to patients by the appearance of  strains of s. aureus more resistant to one of the key therapeutic agents used in  our hospitals. it will do so by raising a number of important questions followed  by the presentation of experimental evidence that may or may not provide answers  that heighten or lower the threat.

TI  == [prevalence of aa(6')-aph(2")ia gene among high-level aminoglycoside resistant enterococci and staphylococci].
AB  == according to new reports the aac (6')-aph (2")ia gene is no longer the only gene  encoding resistance to gentamycin in gram-positive cocci and therefore the current method for predicting synergism aminoglycosides with bacterial cell wall  active agents in this bacteria may need revision. to further our knowledge of aminoglycoside resistance mechanism in gram-positive cocci in gdansk region we tested presence of aac (6')-aph (2")ia gene among 22 enterococcal (e. faecalis) and 41 staphylococcal (s. haemolyticus, s. aureus, s. epidermidis) gentamycin-resistant isolates. presence of aac (6')-aph (2")ia gene varied from 50% (n = 6) in gentamycin-resistant s. epidermidis, 80% (n = 10) in gentamycin resistant s. haemolyticus 88% in methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) (n = 25). in enterococcus faecalis this gene was noticed only in 59% (n =  22) of gentamycin-resistant isolates. these results suggest that spread of resistance gene among different species is limited and aac (6')-aph (2")ia mediated gentamycin-resistance mechanism is more common among mrsa and staphylococcus haemolyticus.

TI  == [composition of ame encoding gene in gram positive cocci--study on spread of aminoglycoside resistance].
AB  == aminoglycoside modifying enzymes (ames) are major factors which confer aminoglycoside resistance on bacteria. composition of six genes encoding ames (including lately described aph 2"-genes) was investigated by pcr for 16 clinical isolates of enterococcus faecalis, 16 clinical isolates of coagulase-positive (s. aureus) and 13 clinical isolates of coagulase negative staphylococci (s. haemolyticus, s. epidermidis) collected in gdansk region (northern poland) in the years 1998-2001. diversity of ame encoding gene profiles (composition) was used to analyze spread of ame encoding gene among and within studied group of cocci. according to presence of particular genes we distinguish eleven different ame encoding gene profiles: seven profiles were unique for particular species while the most common was shared among s. aureus, coagulase negative staphylococci and  enterococci. regarding profile frequency statistical analysis (fstat, amova, cluster analysis upgma) shows: the difference between s. aureus and enterococci and coagulase-negative staphylococci, lack of difference between enterococci and  coagulase-negative staphylococci, higher variability within than between studied  species and presence of multispecies cluster. on the basis of the reports about ability of staphylococci to synthesis enterococcal pheromones, this finding lets  assume that spread of aminoglycoside resistance gene among gram (+) cocci is limited only by the ability of stains to synthesis or induction of synthesis conjugation protein.

TI  == different susceptibilities of staphylococcus and gram-negative rods to epigallocatechin gallate.
AB  == we examined the antibacterial effects of epigallocatechin gallate (egcg, the main constituent of tea catechins) against various strains of staphylococcus and gram-negative rods. compared to the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of egcg against s. aureus, s. epidermidis, s. hominis, and s. haemolyticus (50-100 micro g/ml), higher mics (>or=800 micro g/ml) were observed against gram-negative rods, including escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella typhi, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and serratia marcescens. and difference was observed between the binding abilities of egcg with viable s. aureus and with e. coli. the bactericidal activity of egcg for s. aureus was blocked dose-dependently by purified peptidoglycan but not by lipopolysaccharide  or dextran. it was also found that peptone and protein, but not amino acids, in the culture medium greatly affected the antibacterial activity of egcg. these results indicate that the structure of the bacterial cell wall and the different  affinities of egcg with the various cell wall components are responsible for the  different susceptibilities of staphylococcus and gram-negative rods to egcg.

TI  == [post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--i. gram-positive bacteria].
AB  == as a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, and carbapenems. changes in the bacterial susceptibility for czop were also evaluated with the resistance ratio calculated with breakpoint mic. sixteen species (2,363 strains) of gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the  clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2001, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus epidermidis  (msse), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis (mrse), staphylococcus haemolyticus, staphylococcus saprophyticus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus avium, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae (pssp), penicillin-intermediate resistant s. pneumoniae (pisp), penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp), streptococcus milleri group and peptostreptococcus spp. the antibacterial activity of czop either against mssa or msse was preferable (mic90: 2 or 0.5 micrograms/ml) and comparable to those of other cephems. czop was also effective  on mrse (mic90: 16 micrograms/ml) but not on mrsa. czop and other cephems had low antibacterial activity against s. haemolyticus (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against s. saprophyticus was comparable to or higher than those of other cephems, but the mic90 of czop in 2001 was higher than those in 1996-2000 (32 vs 1-2 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop  against e. faecalis was comparable to that of cefpirome (cpr; mic90: 16 micrograms/ml) and higher than those of other cephems. no antibacterial activity  of czop against e. faecium and e. avium was observed, like other drugs. the antibacterial activity of czop against s. pyogenes was as potent as those of cefotiam and cpr (mic90: < or = 0.063 microgram/ml), and, against s. agalactiae,  was also preferable (mic90: 0.125 microgram/ml). czop indicated preferable antibacterial activity either against pssp, pisp, or prsp (mic90: 0.25, 1, or 2 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against s. milleri group was also preferable, but the mic90 of czop in 2001 was higher than those in 1996-2000 (4 vs 0.5 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against peptostreptococcus spp. was preferable but weaker than those of cefazolin and cefmetazole. the resistance ratio estimated from breakpoint mic of czop was 95.9% in mrsa, 93.5% in prsp, 63.3% in pisp, 35.8% in s. haemolyticus, 27.9% in e. faecalis, and 13.3% mrse. those resistance ratios were comparable to those for cefepime (cfpm), but e. faecalis showed 91.2% for cfpm. the difference in the resistance ratio of e. faecalis demonstrated that czop successfully maintained its antibacterial activity against these species. in correlation of drug susceptibility, 40.3% of prsp was not inhibited at breakpoint mic either czop or  cfpm while 69.2% at breakpoint mic either czop or ceftazidime. in conclusion, the antibacterial activities of czop against the gram-positive bacteria obtained from the 6-year duration study were consistent with the results from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. a decline in the sensitivities of s. saprophyticus, s. milleri group, pisp, and prsp to czop, however, was suggested.

TI  == [optimizing microbiological controls of corneal organ culture media].
AB  == background/aims: to compare the efficiency of an automated method using blood bottles with conventional microbiological tests for controlling sterility in cornea organ culture media. methods: two complementary studies were conducted. experimental study: standard organ culture media were contaminated with four different inocula of 14 bacteria and 3 fungi. the bactericidal activity of organ  culture media were evaluated after 48 hours of incubation at 31c. observational study: 357 samples of organ culture media were collected over 1 year in our cornea bank. for both studies, media were inoculated in three blood bottles (aerobic, anaerobic, fungal) placed in an automat with automated detection every  10 minutes, and in three conventional microbiological media as a control. changes in organ culture medium color and growth on conventional broth were checked daily by visual inspection. all samples were observed experimentally for 14 days. the sensitivity and rapidity of contamination detection were compared across the three methods: blood bottles, conventional method, and visual inspection of medium color. results: experimental study: organ culture medium eradicated five bacteria: s. pneumoniae, b. catarrhalis, e. coli, p. acnes and h. influenzae. for the others, (methicillin-resistant s. aureus, methicillin-sensitive s. aureus, s. epidermidis, s. haemolyticus, p. aeruginosa, a. baumannii, b. subtilis, k. pneumoniae, e. faecalis, c. albicans, c. kruzei, a. fumigatus) the blood bottle method, the conventional microbiological method, and the visual inspection detected microbiological growth respectively in 100%, 76.5%, and 70% of cases. mean detection time using blood bottles was 15.1 hours (standard deviation, 13.8; range, 2-52). in cases of detection by the blood-bottle method and the conventional method, the former was always faster: 95.5% versus 65.2% detection within 24 hours (p=0.022). observational study: the global contamination rate was 8% (29/357 analysis). the gain in sensitivity with blood bottles was 25% compared with the conventional method. five bacteria (three coag. neg staphylococcus, one  e. faecalis, one p. paucimobilis) were detected only by the blood bottles. in addition, these were always detected more quickly with, respectively, 66.6% versus 26.6% detection with 24 hours (p=0.028). conclusions: blood bottles detect contaminations of cornea organ culture media more efficiently and faster than conventional microbiological methods. they make it possible to reduce the quarantine period with an equally high security level. consequently, they should  be recommended in cornea preservation guidelines.

AB  == asymptomatic prostatitis is classified as category iv in nih classification of prostatitis syndrome (1999). no report concerning this category has been present. we investigated this category histopathologically and clinically, in order to clarify the histopathological distribution and its correlation to the clinical features, in this study. among 785 patients who were suspected prostate cancer because of their high prostatic specific antigen (psa) values and to have a sextant prostate needle biopsy was performed between january, 1996 and december,  2000, 88 patients (11.2%) were diagnosed as nih category iv prostatitis (asymptomatic prostatitis). we observed all pathological specimens stained with hematoxylin-eosine, and classified them into subtypes according to the classification criteria for prostatitis defined by true et al. (1999). we also investigated the relationship between histopathological distribution and clinical features such as psa values, psa density, the incidence of pyuria or bacteriuria. in the histopathological study, grade distributions were 12.5% (11/88) in mild, 71.6% (63/88) in moderate, and 15.9% (14/88) in severe. location distributions were 2.3% (2/88) in glandular, 68.2% (60/88) in periglandular, and 29.5% (26/88)  in stromal. no relationship between these subtypes and clinical features was recognized statistically. however, 7 patients (7.95%) were diagnosed as prostate  cancers, later. pyuria was found in 29.1% (23/79). bacteriuria was present in 14.3% (11/77). isolated bacteria were 4 strains of enterococcus faccalis, 2 strains of each of pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus, and one strain of each of escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, staphylococcus haemolyticus, and staphylococcus epidermidis. gram positive rod, and candida sp. no relationship between these subtypes and bacterial species was recognized. these results indicated that the incidence of niii category iv prostatits was not low without correlation to any clinical features. however, we should pay attention to the presence of prostate cancer, because a small number of the patients were diagnosed as prostate cancer, later.

TI  == phylogenetic study of staphylococcus and macrococcus species based on partial hsp60 gene sequences.
AB  == a 600 bp partial hsp60 gene sequence has been described previously as a novel genetic marker for species identification and phylogenetic studies within the genus staphylococcus. in the present study, the 600 bp partial hsp60 gene sequences of 40 validly described staphylococcus species and subspecies and four  macrococcus species were pcr-amplified and sequenced. phylogenetic analysis revealed excellent concordance between the unrooted dendrograms based on partial  hsp60 and 16s rrna gene sequences. the genus macrococcus is clearly separated from the genus staphylococcus, but is closely related to the 'sciuri group', the  only staphylococci that are cytochrome c oxidase-positive. the remaining staphylococcus species clustered into five broad-based subdivisions, which corresponded to the 'aureus group', the 'epidermidis group', the 'haemolyticus group', the 'saprophyticus group' and the 'intermedius group'. these results agreed remarkably well with the current taxonomy of this diverse family, which is based on classical phenotypic and biochemical testing. furthermore, pairwise sequence comparisons indicated that the hsp60 gene is more divergent and more discriminatory than the 16s rrna gene for species differentiation among strains of the genera staphylococcus and macrococcus. it is concluded that the hsp60 gene may be an efficient alternative target for taxonomic and phylogenetic studies on  members of these genera.

AB  == objective: to investigate the hvr-pcr genotype of methicillin-resistant staphylococci in local hospitals and compare it with the antibiograms, with aview to selecting effective antibacterial agents, moreover, to discuss preliminarily its role in molecular epidemiology. methods: the minimal inhibitory concentrations(mics) of 86 mrsa, 10 mrse(mc's. epidemidis), 5 msse(mc's. epidemidis), 8 mrsh(mc's. haemolyticus) and 5 mssh(mc's. haemolyticus) clinical isolates collected from 4 local hospitals were tested by serial two-fold agar dilution method; their dna were extracted by moved basic lytic method, whose polymerase chain reaction(pcr) products amplified, based on the size of mec-associated hypervariable region(hvr) were analyzed by pag vertical and agarose gel electrophoresis. results: mrsa, mrse and mrsh were grouped into 4, 3  and 2 hvr genotypes respectively according to the size of the pcr products. the pcr products amplified from 9 of 10 mrse isolates were the same as the products amplified from mrsa isolates. mrsa strains in this study were mainly hvr genotypes a and d, which accounted for 52.32% and 39.53%; genotypes b and c were  the most multi-drug resistant, but genotype d was multi-sensitive. the i genotype of mrse was multi-drug resistant, but its genotype iii was multi-drug sensitive.  the genotype a of mrsh was more resistant than genotype b. conclusion: these results suggest that hvr-pcr genotype method is an easy and fast method for epidemiological investigation of nosocomial infections caused by mrsa, and it is  helpful for clinical selection of antibacterial agents. this method can compare the mec determinants of mrsa and mc'cnst isolates and hence to search for the origin of the mec determinant.

AB  == the goal of this exercise was to organize external quality assurance (qa) of antibiotic susceptibility testing for laboratories participating in earss and to  assess the comparability of susceptibility test results across countries, and guidelines. in september 2000, uk neqas distributed a set of three streptococcus  pneumoniae strains, two staphylococcus aureus strains and one streptococcus haemolyticus strain. laboratories reported the guideline followed, the interpretation of the susceptibility test result and the mic, if tested. in this  study we considered results 'concordant' if the reported interpretation of the participating laboratory agreed with the designated interpretation of reference laboratories. overall, 433 (92%) of 471 laboratories from 23 countries reported back. of the 8685 tests that were assessed, 8322 (96%) were interpreted correctly by the participants. concordance for detection of penicillin non-susceptibility in the three s. pneumoniae strains was 96%, 90% and 87%, respectively. laboratories performed extremely well in detecting oxacillin resistance in the homogeneously methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) strain, but the concordance  rate dropped from 100% to 77% in the heterogeneously resistant mrsa strain. concordance for detection of teicoplanin resistance in the s. haemolyticus strain was 82%. we stratified concordance rates first for country and then for guideline used, but observed only minor differences among countries and guidelines. quantitative methods yielding an mic were more concordant than non-mic methods for penicillin resistance in the s. pneumoniae strains (94% versus 79%). the nccls guideline was the most frequently followed, by 61% of laboratories from 19  countries. this exercise shows that, overall, countries participating in earss are capable of delivering susceptibility data of good quality. the comparability  of susceptibility data for penicillin resistance in s. pneumoniae and for homogeneous methicillin resistance in s. aureus is satisfactory among european countries and across guidelines. however, we emphasize the importance of determining an mic for suspected penicillin non-susceptible s. pneumoniae and for suspected glycopeptide non-susceptible s. aureus. laboratories, particularly in some countries, may need to improve their capability to detect oxacillin resistance in heterogeneously resistant mrsa. for continuous external quality assessment we recommend that laboratories participate in national and international schemes with frequent distribution of control strains.

TI  == an investigation into the microflora of heroin.
AB  == in 2000, an unusual increase of morbidity and mortality among illegal injecting drug users in the uk and ireland was reported and clostridium novyi was identified as the likely source of the serious infection, although infections due to c. botulinum and bacillus cereus were also reported. because heroin was a possibile source of infection, this study investigated the microflora of heroin samples seized in england during 2000 and 2002. two methods were developed for the examination of the microflora of heroin. the first consisted of suspension of the drug in maximum recovery diluent (mrd) which was inoculated directly into clostridium botulinum isolation cooked meat broth (cbi). the second method rendered the heroin soluble in citric acid, concentrated particulate material (and bacterial cells) by filtration and removed heroin residues by washing with citric acid and phosphate-buffered saline before placing the filter in cbi broth. duplicate cbi broths from both methods were incubated without heating and after heating at 60 degrees c for 30 min. subcultures were made after incubation for 7  and 14 days on to eight different solid media. the methods were evaluated with heroin samples spiked with either c. botulinum or c. novyi spore suspensions; recovery of 10 spores in the original sample was demonstrated. fifty-eight heroin samples were tested by citric acid solubilisation and 34 by the mrd suspension technique. fifteen different gram-positive species of four genera were recognised. no fungi were isolated. aerobic endospore-forming bacteria (bacillus  spp. and paenibacillus macerans) were the predominant microflora isolated and at  least one species was isolated from each sample. b. cereus was the most common species and was isolated from 95% of all samples, with b. licheniformis isolated  from 40%. between one and five samples yielded cultures of b. coagulans, b. laterosporus, b. pumilus, b. subtilis and p. macerans. staphylococcus spp. were isolated from 23 (40%) samples; s. warneri and s. epidermidis were the most common and were cultured from 13 (22%) and 6 (10%) samples respectively. one or two samples yielded cultures of s. aureus, s. capitis and s. haemolyticus. the remainder of the flora detected comprised two samples contaminated with c. perfringens and two samples with either c. sordellii or c. tertium. multiple bacterial species were isolated from 43 (74%) samples, a single species from the  remaining 15. in 13 samples b. cereus alone was isolated, in one b. subtilis alone and in one sample b. pumilus alone. c. botulinum and c. novyi were not isolated from any of the heroin samples. recommendations for the optimal examination of the microflora of heroin are given.

TI  == organization of the antiseptic resistance gene qaca and tn552-related beta-lactamase genes in multidrug- resistant staphylococcus haemolyticus strains  of animal and human origins.
AB  == a part (12 kb) of a plasmid containing the beta-lactamase genes of tn552, the disinfectant resistance gene qaca, and flanking dna has been cloned from a staphylococcus haemolyticus isolate and sequenced. this region was used to map the corresponding regions in six other multiresistant s. haemolyticus isolates of human and animal origin. the organizations of the genetic structures were almost  identical in all isolates studied. the beta-lactamase and qaca genes from s. haemolyticus have >99.9% identities at the nucleotide level with the same genes from s. aureus, demonstrating that various staphylococcal species able to colonize animal and human hosts can exchange the genetic elements involved in resistance to antibiotics and disinfectants. the use of antibiotics and disinfectants in veterinary practice and animal husbandry may also contribute to  the selection and maintenance of resistance factors among the staphylococcal species. different parts of the 12-kb section analyzed had high degrees of nucleotide identity with regions from several other different staphylococcus aureus plasmids. this suggests the contribution of interplasmid recombination in  the evolutionary makeup of this 12-kb section involving plasmids that can intermingle between various staphylococcal species. the lateral spread of resistance genes between various staphylococcal species is probably facilitated by the generation of large multiresistance plasmids and the subsequent interspecies exchange of them.

TI  == microbiology of acute otitis externa.
AB  == objective: to isolate and characterize bacteria and fungi from acute otitis externa (aoe) and to obtain susceptibility profiles on each bacterial isolate. study design: prospective core series. methods: specimens were collected from the external canals of subjects with clinically diagnosed acute otitis externa. species-level identification for each bacterial isolate recovered was obtained by combining phenotypic and genotypic data. end point mean inhibitory concentration  (mic) testing was performed using national committee for clinical laboratory standards (nccls) recommended methods. results: in alcon-sponsored clinical studies conducted in 1998 to 2000, microbiology specimens were collected from 2039 subjects (2240 diseased ears) by 101 investigators throughout the united states. a total of 2838 bacteria, 32 yeast, and 17 molds were recovered from 2048 ears clinically diagnosed as acute otitis externa. of the 202 bacterial species recovered, the species most frequently isolated was pseudomonas aeruginosa (38%). the next 10 species most frequently isolated were: staphylococcus epidermidis, 9.1%; staphylococcus aureus, 7.8%; microbacterium otitidis, 6.6%; microbacterium  alconae, 2.9%; staphylococcus caprae, 2.6%; staphylococcus auricularis, 2.0%; enterococcus faecalis, 1.9%; enterobacter cloacae, 1.6%; staphylococcus capitis subsp. ureolyticus,1.4%; and staphylococcus haemolyticus, 1.3%. susceptibility profiles of s. epidermidis isolates revealed the greatest frequency of high-level resistance to selected antibiotics (>/=8 microg/ml): 23%, neomycin-resistant; 11%, oxacillin-resistant; and 12%, ofloxacin-resistant. susceptibility profiles of s. aureus isolates revealed a lower frequency of high-level resistance: 6.3%,  neomycin-resistant; 2.7%, oxacillin-resistant; and 4.5%, ofloxacin-resistant. p.  aeruginosa with high-level resistance to quinolones (>/=128 mcg/ml for ofloxacin) was recovered from only 1 subject. likewise, resistance of p. aeruginosa to aminoglycosides was rare. twenty isolates had neomycin mics >/=64 mcg/ml and 10 isolates had gentamicin mics >/=16 mcg/ml. the coryneform isolates identified as  microbacterium otitidis had an intrinsic lack of susceptibility to quinolones (ofloxacin mics >/=16 mcg/ml) and aminoglycosides (tobramycin mics >/=32 mcg/ml and gentamicin mics >/=8 mcg/ml). conclusions: bacterial infections of the external ear canal are most often caused by p. aeruginosa. however, there are a great number of other gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial species that are  recovered from patients with acute otitis externa. because of this diverse etiology, the best topical therapeutic choice for topical therapy is for the most potent, broad-spectrum (especially anti-p. aeruginosa) antibiotic available.

TI  == mediastinitis after cardiac surgery: improvement of bacteriological diagnosis by  use of multiple tissue samples and strain typing.
AB  == the diagnosis of postsurgical mediastinitis (psm) among patients with sternal wound complication (swc) after cardiac surgery is sometimes difficult, as fever,  elevated c-reactive protein levels, and chest pain can be caused by a general inflammatory reaction to the operative trauma and/or sternal dehiscence without infection. the definitions of psm usually used emphasize clinical signs and symptoms easily observed by the surgeon. the aim of the study was to investigate  whether the use of standardized multiple tissue sampling, optimal culturing methods, and strain typing, together with a microbiological criterion for infection, could identify more infected patients than clinical assessment alone.  patients reexplored due to swc after cardiac artery bypass grafting (cabg) or heart valve replacement (hvr) with or without cabg performed at the department for cardio-thoracic surgery at the uppsala university hospital between 10 march 1998 and 9 september 2000 were investigated prospectively. tissue samples were taken from the sternum or adjacent mediastinal tissue, preferably before the administration of antibiotics. culturing was performed both directly (on agar plates) and using enrichment broth. species identification was performed by standard methods, and strain typing was performed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. a total of 41 cases with at least five tissue samples each were  included in the study group. of these patients, 32 were infected according to the microbiological criterion (i.e., the same strain was found in >/=50% of the samples). staphylococcus epidermidis was the primary pathogen in 38% of the cases (12/32), s. aureus was the primary pathogen in 31% (10/32), p. acnes was the primary pathogen in 25% (8/32), and s. simulans and s. haemolyticus were the primary pathogens in 3% (1/32) each. all cases of s. aureus infection and 86% (12/14) of coagulase-negative staphylococcus (cons) infections were identified from primary cultures. all cases fulfilling the microbiological criterion for s.  aureus infection were clinically diagnosed as cases of infection, but among the 14 cases fulfilling the criterion for microbiological diagnosis of cons infection, only 10 appeared to qualify clinically as cases of infection. among the patients with sternal dehiscence in whom a microbiological diagnosis was established, 67% (12/18) had a cons infection, compared to 14% (2/14) of those without sternal dehiscence. the difference was statistically significant. psm caused by s. aureus is readily identified by the surgeon, whereas 30% of cases with cons infections may be misinterpreted as noninfected. multiple sampling before administration of antibiotics, primary culturing on agar plates, species identification, strain typing, and susceptibility testing should be used to ensure a fast and microbiologically correct diagnosis which identifies the primary pathogen and infected patients among those with minor infective symptoms. the role of p. acnes as a possible cause of psm needs further investigation. psm  caused by cons is significantly related to sternal dehiscence.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of imipenem against isolates from complicated urinary tract infections.
AB  == antimicrobial activity of imipenem was measured using 4725 strains isolated from  patients with complicated urinary tract infections (cutis) between 1988 and 2000. imipenem was inactive against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecium and some non-fermenting gram-negative rods. resistant strains (mic>16 mg/l) were observed in staphylococcus haemolyticus (22%), enterococcus faecalis (4%), enterococcus avium (8%), serratia marcescens (5%) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (7%). although the prevalence of imipenem-resistant strains of s. aureus, s. epidermidis and p. aeruginosa was sporadically high in some years, no steady increase was seen over  the period. resistant strains were rare in other major uropathogenic species. these results suggest that imipenem is still one of the most reliable antimicrobial drugs.

TI  == [quantitative changes of cd3+, cd4+, cd8+, hla-dr+, t lymphocytes and cd25+ cells in eutrophic full-term neonates with staphylococcal septicemia].
AB  == objective: influence of staphylococcal septicemia on changes of share and changes of amount of cd3+ lymphocytes and their subpopulation as well as cd25+ cells in eutrophic full-term neonates. materials and methods: in 52 full-term neonates, with birthweight ranged from 2900 to 4500 g, including 30 infants with staphylococcal septicemia caused by staphylococcus epidermidis (19 cases), s. sciuri (2 cases) s. varneri, s. hominis, s. haemolyticus and s. aureus (6 cases)  and 22 healthy neonates (control group) the subpopulation of cd3+, cd4+, cd8+, hla-dr+ lymphocytes in venous blood was estimated using flow cytometer facscan with monoclonal antibodies of becton dickinson. results: average percentage of cd3+ (69.2 +/- 5.9%), cd4+ (48.9 +/- 10.7%) and hla-dr+ (1.8 +/- 0.9%) lymphocytes and average cd4+/cd8+ ratio (2.97 +/- 1.33) in neonates with septicemia did not significantly differ from average values of these parameters in healthy neonates that were: cd3+ (69.1 +/- 9.0%), cd4+ (47.4 +/- 10.6%), hla-dr+ (1.5 +/- 0.5%) and cd4+/cd8+ (2.29 +/- 1.29). likewise the average numbers of these lymphocytes were close to the values found in the control group. whereas the average subpopulation of cd8+ (19.2 +/- 4.6%) lymphocytes in ill neonates was significantly lower (p = 0.007) than in healthy ones (23.6 +/- 6.6%), and the average number of cd25+ cells was essentially (p = 0.01) higher in septicemia neonates (8.5 +/- 2.5) compared to the control group (6.6 +/- 1.3%). average numbers of these cells in ill neonates did not substantially differ from  their average values in control group. conclusions: 1. staphylococcal septicemia  significantly decreases the values of subpopulation of cd8+ lymphocytes and increases the number of cd25+ cells in eutrophic full-term neonates. 2. estimation of lymphocytes, and their subpopulation and cd25+ cells in neonates with staphylococcal septicemia may be useful in assessment of immunological changes in severe infections.

AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2000 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, and  penicillins. fifteen species, 1,062 strains, of gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from january to december, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa; n = 127), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa; n = 123), staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 104), staphylococcus haemolyticus (n = 58), streptococcus pyogenes (n = 100), streptococcus agalactiae (n = 50), streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 125), enterococcus faecalis (n = 150), enterococcus faecium (n = 50), enterococcus avium (n = 50), and peptostreptococcus spp. (p. anaerobius, p. asaccharolyticus, p. magnus, p. micros, p. prevotii; n = 125). czop possessed stable antibacterial activities against all strains tested throughout 5 years. the mic90 of czop against mrsa and s. haemolyticus tended to decrease while against s. pneumoniae and peptostreptococcus spp., tended to increase year by year. however, the mic90 just changed a little and were consistent with the results from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. increases in the mic90 against s. pneumoniae were also observed with cefpirome (cpr), cefepime (cfpm), flomoxef (fmox), sulbactam/cefoperazone (sbt/cpz), and imipenem (ipm). increases in the mic90 against peptostreptococcus spp. were also  observed with ceftazidime (caz), cpr, cfpm, fmox, sbt/cpz, and ipm. the decreases in the sensitivities were not always considered to depend upon generation of resistant bacteria because the annual mic range of each antibacterial agent was almost generally wide every year and the annual sensitivity of each strain to the agents extremely varied. in conclusion, the annual antibacterial activities of czop against the gram-positive bacteria did not considerably change. it, therefore, was suggested that czop had maintained high antibacterial activity during 5 years of post-marketing.

TI  == evaluation of the vitek 2 system for identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of medically relevant gram-positive cocci.
AB  == a study was conducted to evaluate the new vitek 2 system (biomerieux) for identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing of gram-positive cocci. clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus (n = 100), coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns) (n = 100), enterococcus spp. (n = 89), streptococcus agalactiae (n = 29), and streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 66) were examined with the id-gpc identification card and with the ast-p515 (for staphylococci), ast-p516 (for enterococci and s. agalactiae) and ast-p506 (for pneumococci) susceptibility cards. the identification comparison methods were the api staph for staphylococci and the api 20 strep for streptococci and enterococci; for antimicrobial susceptibility testing, the agar dilution method according to the procedure of the national committee for clinical laboratory standards (nccls) was used. the vitek 2 system correctly identified to the species level (only one choice or after simple supplementary tests) 99% of s. aureus, 96.5% of s. agalactiae, 96.9% of s. pneumoniae, 92.7% of enterococcus faecalis, 91.3% of staphylococcus haemolyticus, and 88% of staphylococcus epidermidis but was least able to identify enterococcus faecium (71.4% correct). more than 90% of gram-positive cocci were identified within 3 h. according to the nccls breakpoints, antimicrobial susceptibility testing with the vitek 2 system gave 96% correct category agreement, 0.82% very major errors, 0.17% major errors, and 2.7% minor errors. antimicrobial susceptibility testing showed category agreement from 94 to 100% for s. aureus, from 90 to 100% for cns, from 91 to 100% for enterococci, from 96 to 100% for s. agalactiae, and from 91 to 100% for s. pneumoniae. microorganism-antibiotic combinations that gave very major errors were cns-erythromycin, cns-oxacillin, enterococci-teicoplanin, and enterococci-high-concentration gentamicin. major errors were observed for cns-oxacillin and s. agalactiae-tetracycline combinations. in conclusion the results of this study indicate that the vitek 2 system represents an accurate and acceptable means for performing identification and antibiotic susceptibility tests with medically relevant gram-positive cocci.

AB  == as a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, and carbapenems. changes in the bacterial sensitivity for czop were  also evaluated with the resistance ratio calculated with breakpoint mic. sixteen  species (1,913 strains) of gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2000, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa; n = 178), methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa; n = 199), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus epidermidis (msse; n = 98), methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis (mrse; n = 164), staphylococcus haemolyticus (n = 72), staphylococcus saprophyticus (n = 28), enterococcus faecalis (n = 206), enterococcus faecium (n  = 91), enterococcus avium (n = 72), streptococcus pyogenes (n = 133), streptococcus agalactiae (n = 138), penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae (pssp; n = 133), penicillin-intermediate resistant s. pneumoniae (pisp; n = 100), penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp; n = 29), streptococcus milleri group (n = 135) and peptostreptococcus spp. (n = 137). czop possessed comparable antibacterial activities against mssa and msse to other cephems, and was also effective on mrse but not on mrsa. an antibacterial activity of czop against s. saprophyticus was comparable to or higher than other cephems. czop, however, did not indicate an antibacterial activity against s. haemolyticus, just like other cephems. an antibacterial activity of czop against e. faecalis was comparable to cefpirome (cpr) and higher than other cephems. no antibacterial activity of czop against e. faecium and e. avium was observed, just like other drugs. an antibacterial activity of czop against s. pyogenes was as potent as that of cefotiam (ctm), cefepime (cfpm) and cpr, and that against s. agalactiae was also preferable. czop and other cephems also had a preferable antibacterial activity against s. milleri group that was most sensitive to benzylpenicillin. an antibacterial activity of czop against peptostreptococcus spp. was preferable but weaker than that of cefazolin, ctm and cefmetazole. the resistance ratio estimated with breakpoint mic of czop was 96.5% in mrsa, 93.1% in prsp, 60.0% in  pisp, 40.3% in s. haemolyticus, 22.3% in e. faecalis, and 15.9% in mrse. those resistance ratios were similar to those for cfpm, but e. faecalis showed 90.8% resistance for cfpm. the difference in the resistance ratio of e. faecalis demonstrated that czop successfully maintained its antibacterial activity against this species. in conclusion, no remarkable annual change in the antibacterial activities of czop against the gram-positive bacteria was observed. the sensitivities of pisp and prsp to czop, however, was suggested to be decreasing.

TI  == proficiency of italian clinical laboratories in detecting reduced glycopeptide susceptibility in enterococcus and staphylococcus spp. using routine laboratory methodologies.
AB  == objective: to assess the ability of 59 clinical microbiology laboratories distributed throughout italy to correctly identify and detect reduced susceptibility to glycopeptides in staphylococci and vana-, vanb- or vanc-mediated glycopeptide resistance in enterococci. methods: eight test strains comprising three staphylococci (s. aureus atcc 29212 and two vancomycin-intermediate s. haemolyticus [11105301, 10030683y]) and five enterococci (e. faecalis atcc 29212, e. faecalis atcc 51299 vanb, e. faecium aib40 vana, e. faecalis v583 vanb and e. gallinarum aib39 vanc1) were distributed to 59 italian clinical microbiology laboratories. each isolate was blind-coded, and laboratories were instructed to identify the strains and test isolates for susceptibility to teicoplanin and vancomycin using their standard methods. results were assessed against consensus test results obtained by a reference laboratory. in addition, to complement data interpretation, laboratories were asked to provide retrospective routine test results from their respective hospitals. results: all 59 laboratories participating in the study completed the  susceptibility testing and provided data for analysis. a total of 53 laboratories provided retrospective routine data. overall, laboratories were able to identify  isolates to the genus level successfully. e. gallinarum and s. haemolyticus posed problems for species identification, with only 40.6 and 71.2%, respectively, of results reported correctly; most incorrect results were reported as 'other species'. for enterococcal test strains, vana phenotypes were detected correctly  by 96.6% of laboratories; vanb by 30.5% (e. faecalis atcc 51299) and 88.1% (e. faecalis v583); and vanc1 by 67.8%. for staphylococcal test strains, 28.8% (s. haemolyticus 11105301) and 23.7% (s. haemolyticus 10030683y) of the laboratories  were able to detect reduced susceptibility to vancomycin. errors in detecting vancomycin resistance in vanb and vanc1 enterococci were made with all methods, most noticeably by disk diffusion users. for staphylococci, most errors in reporting vancomycin-intermediate resistance occurred with disk diffusion and vitek (software version 5.04) users. overall, considerably fewer errors occurred  with the detection of teicoplanin resistance, especially for staphylococci. for 1999, routine results show that 41/1749 (2.4%) of e. faecium, 220/11 180 (2.0%) of e. faecalis, 29/24 927 (0.12%) of s. aureus and 54/22 102 (0.24%) of coagulase-negative staphylococci were reported as resistant to vancomycin. conclusion: italian laboratories are able to identify staphylococci and enterococci adequately, although all methodologies used have problems in identifying e. gallinarum and coagulase-negative staphylococci to the species level. while vana phenotypes were efficiently detected, problems were experienced in detecting vanb and vanc phenotypes. the majority of laboratories were unable to detect reduced vancomycin susceptibility in staphylococci adequately, especially with disk diffusion and older vitek systems. teicoplanin appeared useful as a marker for detecting vancomycin resistance, particularly with disk diffusion. should enterococcal vanb or staphylococcal glycopeptide-intermediate phenotypes become prevalent in italy, it is likely that they would be under-detected. new systems under development, such as vitek2, should improve this situation.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo activities of a novel cephalosporin, bms-247243, against methicillin-resistant and -susceptible staphylococci.
AB  == the recent emergence of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) with decreased susceptibility to vancomycin has intensified the search for alternative therapies for the treatment of infections caused by this organism. one approach has been to identify a beta-lactam with improved affinity for pbp 2a, the target  enzyme responsible for methicillin resistance in staphylococci. bms-247243 is such a candidate, with mics that inhibit 90% of isolates tested (mic(90)s) of 4,  2, and 8 microg/ml for methicillin-resistant strains of s. aureus, s. epidermidis, and s. haemolyticus, respectively, as determined on plates with mueller-hinton agar and 2% nacl. the bms-247243 mics for mrsa were minimally affected by the susceptibility testing conditions (inoculum size, prolonged incubation, addition of salt to the test medium) or by staphylococcal beta-lactamases. bms-247243 mic(90)s for methicillin-susceptible staphylococcal species ranged from < or = 0.25 to 1 microg/ml. the bms-247243 mic(90) for beta-lactamase-producing s. aureus strains was fourfold higher than that for beta-lactamase-nonproducing strains. bms-247243 is hydrolyzed by staphylococcal beta-lactamases at 4.5 to 26.2% of the rates measured for cephaloridine. the affinity of bms-247243 for pbp 2a was >100-fold better than that of methicillin or cefotaxime. bms-247243 is bactericidal for mrsa, killing the bacteria twice as fast as vancomycin. these in vitro activities of bms-247243 correlated with its in vivo efficacy against infections in animals, including the neutropenic murine  thigh and rabbit endocarditis models involving mrsa strains. in conclusion, bms-247243 has in vitro and in vivo activities against methicillin-resistant staphylococci and thus may prove to be useful in the treatment of infections caused by these multidrug-resistant organisms.

TI  == european survey of glycopeptide susceptibility in staphylococcus spp.
AB  == objective: to reassess the relative potencies of teicoplanin and vancomycin following several years of clinical usage. methods: the glycopeptide susceptibilities of clinical isolates of staphylococci collected from 70 hospitals in 1995 were determined using nccls (national committee for clinical laboratory standards) methods. results: in total, 2885 isolates of staphylococcus aureus and 1480 isolates of coagulase-negative staphylococci were collected. s. aureus was significantly less susceptible to vancomycin (mic50 1 mg/l) than teicoplanin (mic50 0.5 mg/l), but the reverse was the case for s. haemolyticus and s. epidermidis. no s. aureus isolate was resistant (>/=32 mg/l) to either glycopeptide, but nine isolates of coagulase-negative staphylococci had an mic of teicoplanin of 32 mg/l. respiratory isolates of s. aureus were less susceptible to glycopeptides than those from other sites. staphylococci from belgium and italy were less susceptible to teicoplanin than isolates from other countries. conclusions: this european survey shows that in 10 years of clinical use there have been no major changes in the susceptibility of staphylococci to the glycopeptides.

TI  == sample preparation of gram-positive bacteria for identification by matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight.
AB  == a new sample preparation method was developed for fresh, whole-cell gram-positive bacteria to be analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi tof ms). with fresh, whole-cell gram-negative bacteria of the enterobacteriaceae family, we had previously achieved spectra consisting of >50 peaks and mass ranges of 2-25 kda. because similar spectral quantity could not be achieved for gram-positive bacteria, using this same protocol, we investigated an alternative approach that focuses on the thick peptidoglycan layer of the cell wall. gram-positive bacteria were incubated with 0.05-0.5 mg/ml lysozyme for 30 min prior to being analyzed by maldi tof ms.  lysozyme is an enzymatically stable, 14-kda protein that specifically cleaves between peptidoglycan disaccharide subunits. a significant increase in overall number of peaks (>50) in the 2-14 kda range was observed without interference from the presence of lysozyme. we show that for four different species (staphylococcus aureus, s. haemolyticus, streptococcus pyogenes, and s. agalactiae) reproducible subset of peaks were found within spectra from a reference strain and two unrelated clinical isolates. the data suggests that this sample preparation may be useful for increasing the overall number of peaks within spectra for subsequent development of bacterial identification strategies.

TI  == consensus pcr and microarray for diagnosis of the genus staphylococcus, species,  and methicillin resistance.
AB  == we propose the use of dna microarray for the discrimination of homologous products after a single pcr amplification with consensus primers. the method was  applied to staphylococcus identification. the fema nucleotide sequences, which are phylogenetically conserved among the staphylococci, were first amplified using a consensus primer pair together with the meca sequence, a molecular marker for methicillin resistance. products were then identified on a glass array. the microarray contained five selective dna capture probes for the simultaneous and differential identification of the five most clinically relevant staphylococcal species (s. aureus, s. epidermidis, s. haemolyticus, s. hominis, and s. saprophyticus), while a consensus capture probe could detect all fema sequences,  allowing the identification of the genus staphylococcus. the meca sequence hybridized to a specific capture probe. the identification was univocal because only a single capture probe had to be present for each sequence to be identified. the hybridization and identification processes were completed in less than 2 h. current results demonstrate that low-density microarrays are powerful multigenotypic post-pcr analyzers and could compete with conventional bacteria identification.

TI  == identification of clinical staphylococcal isolates from humans by internal transcribed spacer pcr.
AB  == the emergence of coagulase-negative staphylococci not only as human pathogens but also as reservoirs of antibiotic resistance determinants requires the deployment  and development of methods for their rapid and reliable identification. internal  transcribed spacer-pcr (its-pcr) was used to identify a collection of 617 clinical staphylococcal isolates. the amplicons were resolved in high-resolution  agarose gels and visually compared with the patterns obtained for the control strains of 29 staphylococcal species. of the 617 isolates studied, 592 (95.95%) were identified by its-pcr and included 11 species: 302 isolates of staphylococcus epidermidis, 157 of s. haemolyticus, 79 of s. aureus, 21 of s. hominis, 14 of s. saprophyticus, 8 of s. warneri, 6 of s. simulans, 2 of s. lugdunensis, and 1 each of s. caprae, s. carnosus, and s. cohnii. all species analyzed had unique its-pcr patterns, although some were very similar, namely, the group s. saprophyticus, s. cohnii, s. gallinarum, s. xylosus, s. lentus, s. equorum, and s. chromogenes, the pair s. schleiferi and s. vitulus, and the pair  s. piscifermentans and s. carnosus. four species, s. aureus, s. caprae, s. haemolyticus, and s. lugdunensis, showed polymorphisms on their its-pcr patterns. its-pcr proved to be a valuable alternative for the identification of staphylococci, offering, within the same response time and at lower cost, higher  reliability than the currently available commercial systems.

AB  == the in vitro activity of daptomycin was assessed in comparison with that of vancomycin and penicillin against a wide range of gram-positive aerobic clinical  isolates. mics were determined by an agar dilution method on mueller-hinton agar  (nccls/eucast) and on isotonic agar adjusted to contain 50 mg/l free calcium (bsac). both media were enriched with 5% horse blood for fastidious organisms. daptomycin mics for all 172 staphylococci, including methicillin-susceptible and  methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus haemolyticus, were 0.03-0.5 mg/l. for 99 of the 100 enterococci (enterococcus faecalis, n = 50; enterococcus faecium, n = 50), including 37 vancomycin-resistant isolates, they were 0.25-2 mg/l. for all 108 beta-haemolytic streptococci, including streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus agalactiae, daptomycin mics were 0.016- 0.25 mg/l; for 101 alpha-haemolytic streptococci, including streptococcus pneumoniae and 'viridans' streptococci, they were 0.016-2 mg/l. for miscellaneous vancomycin-resistant isolates including lactobacillus spp., lactococcus spp., leuconostoc spp., pediococcus spp. and isolates of enterococcus casseliflavus and enterococcus gallinarum, daptomycin mics were 0.03-2 mg/l; mics for the seven isolates of listeria monocytogenes were 0.25-4 mg/l. there was little difference between the results on mueller-hinton agar and  on supplemented isotonic agar the discrepant results occasionally obtained tended to be one dilution higher on supplemented isotonic agar. daptomycin was active (mics < or = 2 mg/l) against all the isolates tested with the exception of one isolate each of e. faecium and l. monocytogenes (mics = 4 mg/l). our results indicate that daptomycin mics are independent of methicillin and vancomycin mics.

TI  == identification of slide coagulase positive, tube coagulase negative staphylococcus aureus by 16s ribosomal rna gene sequencing.
AB  == aims: to ascertain the clinical importance of a strain of slide coagulase positive but tube coagulase negative staphylococcus species isolated from the blood culture of a 43 year old patient with refractory anaemia with excessive blasts in transformation who had neutropenic fever. methods: the isolate was investigated phenotypically by standard biochemical methods using conventional biochemical tests and two commercially available systems, the vitek (gpi) and api (staph) systems. genotypically, the 16s ribosomal rna (rrna) gene of the bacteria was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) and sequenced. the sequence  of the pcr product was compared with known 16s rrna gene sequences in the genbank by multiple sequence alignment. results: conventional biochemical tests did not reveal a pattern resembling a known staphylococcus species. the vitek system (gpi) showed that it was 94% s. simulans and 3% s. haemolyticus, whereas the api  system (staph) showed that it was 86.8% s. aureus and 5.1% s. warneri. 16s rrna gene sequencing showed that there was a 0 base difference between the isolate and s. aureus, 28 base difference between the isolate and s. lugdunensis, 39 base difference between the isolate and s. schleiferi, 21 base difference between the  isolate and s. haemolyticus, 41 base difference between the isolate and s. simulans, and 23 base difference between the isolate and s. warneri, indicating that the isolate was a strain of s. aureus. vancomycin was subsequently prescribed and blood cultures taken four days after the start of treatment were negative. conclusions: 16s rrna gene sequencing was useful in ascertaining the clinical importance of the strain of slide coagulase positive but tube coagulase  negative staphylococcus species isolated from blood culture and allowing appropriate management.

TI  == in vitro activity of levofloxacin against coagulase-positive and -negative staphylococci.
AB  == the in vitro activity of levofloxacin compared with that of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and norfloxacin were examined by conventional in vitro tests against 150 clinical isolates of staphylococci, subdivided according to species and susceptibility to methicillin. although the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of all quinolones were highest in methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus strains, the activity of levofloxacin was almost complete in methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis and methicillin-resistant s. haemolyticus when compared with ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, which showed more than 30% resistance. methicillin-susceptible s. aureus and s. epidermidis strains were susceptible to all quinolones with few differences between the antibiotics tested. the minimal bactericidal activity of levofloxacin was within the double dilution range of mic values for all strains tested, demonstrating its potent role against staphylococci. in time-kill studies, levofloxacin exerted bactericidal activity within 3 h against all staphylococci. these in vitro results suggest that levofloxacin is a potent fluoroquinolone against coagulase-negative staphylococci and that it is both methicillin-susceptible and  resistant. further studies are necessary to determine the role of this drug in the treatment of infections sustained by these microorganisms.

TI  == development of a pcr assay for identification of staphylococci at genus and species levels.
AB  == we have developed a pcr-based assay which allows the detection of staphylococci at the genus level by targeting the tuf gene, which encodes the elongation factor tu. degenerate pcr primers derived from consensus regions of several tuf genes were used to amplify a target region of 884 bp from 11 representative staphylococcal species. subsequently, the entire nucleotide sequence of these amplicons was determined. the analysis of a multiple alignment of these sequences revealed regions conserved among staphylococci but distinct from those of other gram-positive bacteria genetically related to staphylococci. pcr primers complementary to these regions could amplify specifically and efficiently a dna fragment of 370 bp for all of 27 different staphylococcal species tested. there was no amplification with genomic dna prepared from 53 nonstaphylococcal species  tested to verify the specificity of the assay (20 gram positive and 33 gram negative). furthermore, this assay amplified efficiently all 27 american type culture collection (atcc) staphylococcal reference strains as well as 307 clinical isolates of staphylococci from the quebec city region. analysis of the multiple sequence alignment for the 884-bp fragment for the 11 staphylococcal species as well as comparison of the sequences for the 370-bp amplicon from five  unrelated atcc and clinical strains for each of the species s. aureus, s. epidermidis, s. haemolyticus, s. hominis, and s. saprophyticus demonstrated sufficient interspecies polymorphism to generate genus- and species-specific capture probes. this sequence information allowed the development of staphylococcus-specific and species-specific (targeting s. aureus, s. epidermidis, s. haemolyticus, s. hominis, or s. saprophyticus) capture probes hybridizing to the 370-bp amplicon. in conclusion, this pcr assay is suitable for detection of staphylococci at both genus and species levels.

TI  == genetic organization of the chromosome region surrounding meca in clinical staphylococcal strains: role of is431-mediated meci deletion in expression of resistance in meca-carrying, low-level methicillin-resistant staphylococcus haemolyticus.
AB  == we report on the structural diversity of meca gene complexes carried by 38 methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and 91 methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococcus strains of seven different species with a special reference to its correlation with phenotypic expression of methicillin resistance. the most prevalent and widely disseminated mec complex had the structure meci-mecr1-meca-is431r (or is431mec), designated the class a meca gene  complex. in contrast, in s. haemolyticus, meca was bracketed by two copies of is431, forming the structure is431l-meca-is431r. of the 38 s. haemolyticus strains, 5 had low-level methicillin resistance (mic, 1 to 4 mg/liter) and characteristic heterogeneous methicillin resistance as judged by population analysis. in these five strains, is431l was located to the left of an intact meci gene, forming the structure is431l-class a meca-gene complex. in other s. haemolyticus strains, is431l was associated with the deletion of meci and mecr1,  forming the structure is431l-deltamecr1-meca-is431mec, designated the class c meca gene complex. mutants with the class c meca gene complex were obtained in vitro by selecting strain sh621, containing the is431l-class a meca gene complex  with low concentrations of methicillin (1 and 3 mg/liter). the mutants had intermediate level of methicillin resistance (mic, 16 to 64 mg/liter). the meca gene transcription was shown to be derepressed in a representative mutant strain, sh621-37. our study indicated that the meci-encoded repressor function is responsible for the low-level methicillin resistance of some s. haemolyticus clinical strains and that the is431-mediated meci gene deletion causes the expression of methicillin resistance through the derepression of meca gene transcription.

TI  == relationship of staphylococcal isolates in a moroccan hospital by comparing phenotypical and genotypical tests.
AB  == the relationship of staphylococcus isolates was determined among a collection of  26 clinical strains at the centre hospitalier universitaire de rabat. these isolates originated principally from blood culture and wounds. in order to affirm the clonal origins of these isolates, six phenotype (biotype, anti-biotype, serotype, phage type), and genotype (random amplified polymorphic dna, pulsed field gel electrophoresis) methods were used. biotyping, anti-biotyping, phage and serotyping were generally not sufficient while many isolates remained non-phage typeable. random amplified polymorphic dna analysis used in epidemiological typing seemed suitable for s. epidermidis and s. haemolyticus. however, rigorous standardization will be needed to assure reliable results. pulsed field gel electrophoresis discriminated more efficiently than random amplification polymorphic dna analysis. this study attests to the suitability of  two or more methods in combination for typing staphylococcus isolates.

AB  == rwj-54428 (mc-02,479) is a new cephalosporin with a high level of activity against gram-positive bacteria. in a broth microdilution susceptibility test against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), rwj-54428 was as active as vancomycin, with an mic at which 90% of isolates are inhibited (mic(90)) of 2 microg/ml. for coagulase-negative staphylococci, rwj-54428 was 32  times more active than imipenem, with an mic(90) of 2 microg/ml. rwj-54428 was active against s. aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and staphylococcus haemolyticus isolates with reduced susceptibility to glycopeptides (rwj-54428 mic range, < or = 0.0625 to 1 microg/ml). rwj-54428 was eight times more potent than  methicillin and cefotaxime against methicillin-susceptible s. aureus (mic(90), 0.5 microg/ml). for ampicillin-susceptible enterococcus faecalis (including vancomycin-resistant and high-level aminoglycoside-resistant strains), rwj-54428  had an mic(90) of 0.125 microg/ml. rwj-54428 was also active against enterococcus faecium, including vancomycin-, gentamicin-, and ciprofloxacin-resistant strains. the potency against enterococci correlated with ampicillin susceptibility; rwj-54428 mics ranged between < or = 0.0625 and 1 microg/ml for ampicillin-susceptible strains and 0.125 and 8 microg/ml for ampicillin-resistant strains. rwj-54428 was more active than penicillin g and cefotaxime against penicillin-resistant, -intermediate, and -susceptible strains of streptococcus pneumoniae (mic(90)s, 0.25, 0.125, and < or = 0.0625 microg/ml, respectively). rwj-54428 was only marginally active against most gram-negative bacteria; however, significant activity was observed against haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis (mic(90)s, 0.25 and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively). this survey of the susceptibilities of more than 1,000 multidrug-resistant gram-positive isolates to rwj-54428 indicates that this new cephalosporin has the potential to be useful in the treatment of infections due to gram-positive bacteria, including strains resistant to currently available antimicrobials.

AB  == the primary purpose of the multicenter international study "resist" was to obtain an update on the degree of multidrug resistance among methicillin-resistant staphylococci collected from a geographically diverse sample. a total of 3,307 staphylococcal isolates were recovered from single patients and primarily from clinical specimens that were collected at 20 collaborating regional health centers located in several countries in europe, asia, and latin america during a  3- to 4-month period each in 1997 and 1998. all strains were deposited at the laboratory of molecular genetics at itqb/unl in oeiras, portugal, for quality control and for testing by microbiological and molecular typing techniques; the laboratory of microbiology at the rockefeller university serving as organizational center. the majority of strains, 3,100, were methicillin-resistant, of which 1,749 were coagulase positive (methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, mrsa), and 1,351 were coagulase negative (methicillin-resistant coagulase negative staphylococci, mrcns). the overall frequency of drug resistance traits among the 1,749 mrsa strains was high (over 70% and up to and over 90% of the strains) to ciprofloxacin, erythromycin,  clindamycin, gentamicin, and tetracycline, and was somewhat less frequent to sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (45%), chloramphenicol (30%), and rifampin (38%). none of the 3,307 staphylococcal isolates showed reduced susceptibility to vancomycin except for a single methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative isolate.  the great majority of staphylococci were also susceptible to the new antimicrobial synercid. in contrast, resistance to teicoplanin was significant among methicillin-resistant strains of coagulase-negative staphylococci, particularly among staphylococcus haemolyticus. mrsa isolates showed marked geographic variation in their patterns of multiresistance, most likely reflecting the properties of unique multiresistant mrsa clones dominant in the hospitals that provided the mrsa isolates from the various geographic areas. the multiresistance patterns of mrsa strains and strains of methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci originating at the same country source also showed striking differences, suggesting that resistance to antimicrobial agents emerged under different antibiotic pressures in these bacterial species.

TI  == staphylococcal lipases: biochemical and molecular characterization.
AB  == to date, the nucleotide sequences of nine different lipase genes from six staphylococcus species, three from s. epidermidis, two from s. aureus, and one each from s. haemolyticus, s. hyicus, s. warneri, and s. xylosus, have been determined. all deduced lipase proteins are similarly organized as pre-pro-proteins, with pre-regions corresponding to a signal peptide of 35 to 38  amino acids, a pro-peptide of 207 to 321 amino acids with an overall hydrophilic  character, and a mature peptide comprising 383 to 396 amino acids. the lipases are secreted in the pro-form and are afterwards processed to the mature form by specific proteases. the pro-peptide of the s. hyicus lipase is necessary for efficient translocation and for protection against proteolytic degradation. despite being very similar in their primary structures the staphylococcal lipases show significant differences in their biochemical and catalytic properties, such  as substrate selectivity, ph optimum and interfacial activation. the lipase from  s. hyicus is unique among the staphylococcal and bacterial lipases in that it has not only lipase activity, but also a high phospho-lipase activity. all staphylococcal lipases are dependent on ca(2+), which is thought to have a function in stabilizing the tertiary structure of the lipases. evidence exists that staphylococcal lipases like other bacterial lipases, possess a lid-like domain that might be involved in the interfacial activation of these enzymes.

AB  == twelve clinical strains of staphylococcus haemolyticus (eight methicillin resistant and three methicillin susceptible), isolated from blood cultures between 1982 and 1997, were investigated for teicoplanin and vancomycin susceptibility profiles. on the basis of conventional mic tests and breakpoints,  four isolates were susceptible (mics, 1 to 8 microgram/ml) and eight were resistant (mics, 32 to 64 microgram/ml) to teicoplanin while all were susceptible to vancomycin (mics, 1 to 2 microgram/ml). all four strains for which the conventional teicoplanin mics were within the range of susceptibility expressed heterogeneous resistance to teicoplanin and homogeneous vancomycin susceptibility. of the eight strains for which the conventional teicoplanin mics  were within the range of resistance, six expressed heterogeneous and two expressed homogeneous teicoplanin resistance while seven showed heterogeneous vancomycin resistance profiles (with subpopulations growing on 8 microgram of the drug per ml at frequencies of >/=10(-6) for six strains and 10(-7) for one) and one demonstrated homogeneous vancomycin susceptibility. of six bloodstream isolates of other staphylococcal species (s. aureus, s. epidermidis, and s. simulans), for all of which the conventional teicoplanin mics were >/=4 microgram/ml and the vancomycin mics were </=2 microgram/ml, none exhibited heterogeneous susceptibility profiles for teicoplanin while three showed homogeneous and three showed heterogeneous susceptibility profiles for vancomycin (with subpopulations growing on 8 microgram of the drug per ml found for only one strain). the results of this study indicate that a heterogeneous response to glycopeptides is a common feature of s. haemolyticus isolates and suggest that susceptibility to glycopeptides as determined by conventional mic tests may not be predictive of the outcome of glycopeptide therapy.

TI  == in vitro activity of monoclonal and recombinant yeast killer toxin-like antibodies against antibiotic-resistant gram-positive cocci.
AB  == background: monoclonal (mabkt) and recombinant single-chain (scfvkt) anti-idiotypic antibodies were produced to represent the internal image of a yeast killer toxin (kt) characterized by a wide spectrum of antimicrobial activity, including gram-positive cocci. pathogenic eukaryotic and prokaryotic microorganisms, such as candida albicans, pneumocystis carinii, and a multidrug-resistant strain of mycobacterium tuberculosis, presenting specific, although yet undefined, kt-cell wall receptors (ktr), have proven to be killed in vitro by mabkt and scfvkt. mabkt and scfvkt exert a therapeutic effect in vivo in experimental models of candidiasis and pneumocystosis by mimicking the functional activity of protective antibodies naturally produced in humans against ktr of infecting microorganisms. the swelling tide of concern over increasing bacterial  resistance to antibiotic drugs gives the impetus to develop new therapeutic compounds against microbial threat. thus, the in vitro bactericidal activity of mabkt and scfvkt against gram-positive, drug-resistant cocci of major epidemiological interest was investigated. materials and methods: mabkt and scfvkt generated by hybridoma and dna recombinant technology from the spleen lymphocytes of mice immunized with a kt-neutralizing monoclonal antibody (mab kt4) were used in a conventional colony forming unit (cfu) assay to determine, from a qualitative point of view, their bactericidal activity against staphylococcus aureus, s. haemolyticus, enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium, and streptococcus pneumoniae strains. these bacterial strains are characterized by different patterns of resistance to antibiotics, including methicillin, vancomycin, and penicillin. results: according to the experimental conditions adopted, no bacterial isolate proved to be resistant to the activity of mabkt and scfvkt. conclusions: scfvkt exerted a microbicidal activity against multidrug resistant bacteria, which may represent the basis for the drug modeling of new antibiotics with broad antibacterial spectra to tackle the emergence of microbial resistance.

AB  == surveillance in two medium-size (250-300 beds) hospitals located in the most populated islands of cape verde was undertaken in july 1997 in order to obtain data concerning nasal carriage of staphylococci. nasal swabs (172) taken from inpatients and health care workers (hcw) from different internment services yielded 68 staphylococcus aureus and 105 coagulase-negative staphylococcal (cns)  isolates, demonstrating extensive colonization of both inpatients and hcw by s. aureus (carriage rate 41%) and cns (carriage rate 65%). the most frequent cns species were s. epidermidis and s. haemolyticus. three species--s. aureus, s. epidermidis, and s. sciuri-were recovered from wound swabs. the antibiotic susceptibility profiles of s. aureus and cns differed sharply: all 68 s. aureus were resistant to penicillin but were fully susceptible to oxacillin as well as the other antimicrobial agents tested-gentamicin; erythromycin, except for three  strains; ciprofloxacin; sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, except for two strains; vancomycin; and amoxicillin/clavulanate. in contrast, most (91/105) of cns were resistant to both penicillin and oxacillin, and a variable but substantial proportion of cns isolates also carried multiresistant traits to gentamicin, erythromycin, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, and amoxicillin/clavulanate. the analysis by pfge of the methicillin-susceptible s. aureus (mssa) and the methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis (mrse) strains provided evidence for extensive cross-infection and cross-colonization from hcw to patients.

TI  == nationwide german multicenter study on prevalence of antibiotic resistance in staphylococcal bloodstream isolates and comparative in vitro activities of quinupristin-dalfopristin.
AB  == antibiotic-resistant gram-positive bacteria have become an increasing problem in  the last two decades. in order to evaluate the prevalence of antibiotic resistance in staphylococcal bloodstream isolates in germany, 2,042 staphylococci collected in 21 tertiary-care hospitals were investigated during a 3-year period  (march 1996 to march 1999). altogether, 1,448 s. aureus isolates and 594 coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons) that comprised 13 different species were  included. furthermore, the antistaphylococcal activities of quinupristin-dalfopristin were compared with those of eight other compounds by the broth microdilution method. the rates of oxacillin resistance in staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, s. haemolyticus, and other cons were 13.5, 69, 90, and 34%, respectively. in oxacillin-resistant strains high rates of resistance (up to 100%) to erythromycin, clindamycin, ciprofloxacin, and gentamicin were also observed. however, no strain appeared to be resistant to vancomycin or quinupristin-dalfopristin. the streptogramin combination exhibited  excellent in vitro activity against all staphylococcal species tested, regardless of the patterns of resistance to other drug classes. in terms of mics at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited, quinupristin-dalfopristin was 2 times more active against s. aureus isolates, 4 to 16 times more active against s. haemolyticus, and 8 to 32 times more active against s. epidermidis than vancomycin or teicoplanin.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of staphylococci isolated from otitis externa in dogs.
AB  == samples were obtained from 65 unmedicated adult dogs, processed for isolation of  staphylococcus species and tested for susceptibility to penicillin g, gentamicin, oxacillin, tetracycline, trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole, streptomycin, ampicillin and rifampin. forty-four isolates were obtained, which represents 67.7% of samples. coagulase-negative species were most commonly found, and the most frequently isolated staphylococcus species were staph. epidermidis and staph. aureus. other species, such as staph. simulans, staph. haemolyticus, staph. saprophyticus and staph. intermedius were also isolated. resistance to antibiotics was frequently observed, with 90.9% of the isolates showing resistance to at least one drug. the most active antimicrobial agents against staphylococci isolated from otitis externa of dogs were rifampin and oxacillin. multidrug resistance was a common finding, and one strain of staph. haemolyticus  species, was resistant to all tested antimicrobial agents. resistance to three or more different drugs was a common finding, observed in 16 strains (36.4%) of both coagulase-positive and coagulase-negative staphylococci. this study highlights the emergence of cases of otitis externa determined by coagulase-negative staphylococcus strains and once more emphasizes the need for bacterial culture with species identification and susceptibility testing of swab specimens from the ear canal in order to choose appropriate antimicrobial agents.

TI  == comparison of genes involved in penicillin resistance in staphylococci of bovine  origin.
AB  == ten penicillin-resistant and -susceptible staphylococci, isolated from bovine mastitis milk, were studied for the presence of genes that are, or may be, involved in resistance against penicillin. the repressor (blai), antirepressor (blar1), and structural (blaz) genes of the beta-lactamase-operon were found to be closely linked in all penicillin-resistant strains. the beta-lactamase gene cluster was more commonly located on chromosomal rather than plasmid dna in the strains studied. the transposase (p480) gene, which has been identified in the staphylococcus aureus beta-lactamase transposon tn552, was found in only one single penicillin-resistant s. aureus strain. the other penicillin-resistant s. aureus isolates contained is1181 in close location with the beta-lactamase gene cluster. in only one s. haemolyticus isolate was the beta-lactamase gene cluster  found in close association with is257. penicillin-resistant s. aureus strains, which were additionally resistant to tetracycline, contained is257 in close association with the tetracycline resistance gene (tetk). sequence analysis of blai, blar1, and blaz in two penicillin-resistant s. aureus strains revealed 94-96% sequence homology with bla in staphylococci of human origin. the results indicate a predominance of class i bla transposons rather than tn3 family class ii transposons in the isolates used in this study.

TI  == rapid identification of staphylococcus epidermidis.
AB  == during the collection of airborne bacteria in a museum in england some bacterial  strains were isolated which due to their fatty acid profiles were clearly identified as members of the genus staphylococcus. as fatty acid compositions of  coagulase-negative staphylococci are very similar, differing only in quantities but not in qualities, further identification at the species level without a fatty acid database was not achieved. investigation of the isolates using the staph id  32 api system resulted in an identification of the isolates as staphylococcus epidermidis (probabilities of 79.7-95.5%). for further genotypic characterization of these isolates, some staphylococcus epidermidis strains from different sources and the type strains of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus capitis, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus gallinarum, staphylococcus haemolyticus, staphylococcus hominis, staphylococcus warneri and staphylococcus xylosus were subjected to repetitive-sequence pcr, including enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (eric) pcr, box-pcr and repetitive extragenic palindromic unit sequence (rep) pcr. eric- and box-pcr yielded a species-specific banding pattern for all staphylococcus epidermidis strains. furthermore, all staphylococcal reference strains investigated exhibited distinct banding patterns, clearly distinguishable from that of staphylococcus epidermidis. no species-specific banding patterns could be observed after rep-pcr. as species identification of coagulase-negative staphylococci by fatty acid analyses and biochemical tests is known to be difficult eric- and box-pcr seem to be excellent tools for the identification of staphylococcus epidermidis isolates.

TI  == binding of von willebrand factor by coagulase-negative staphylococci.
AB  == coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns) are the most common infectious micro-organisms isolated from prosthetic devices. to determine whether von willebrand factor (vwf) acts as an adhesin in bacterial recognition, bacterial binding of recombinant vwf (rvwf) was studied. eleven cns strains, belonging to s. epidermidis, s. haemolyticus and s. hominis species, bound soluble rvwf, but to a lesser extent than s. aureus. s. epidermidis strain h2-w bound 125i-labelled rvwf in a dose-dependent manner. the binding could be inhibited by unlabelled rvwf and thrombospondin, but not by fibrinogen, vitronectin or the carbohydrates  n-acetylgalactoseamine, d-galactose, d-glucose, and d-fucose. pre-incubation of rvwf with type i collagen and arg-gly-asp-ser (rgds) peptides did not inhibit binding, whereas pre-incubation of rvwf with heparin decreased binding significantly. the interaction between cns and rvwf was sensitive to proteinase treatment of bacterial cells. cns strains bound to immobilised rvwf an extent greater or equal to the positive control strain s. aureus cowan i. rvwf binding structures from bacterial cell wall were detected by immunoblot. cowan i strain had 140-, 90- and 38-kda binding molecules. s. haemolyticus strain sm131 and s. epidermidis strain h2-w had two (120 and 60 kda) and five (120, 90, 60, 52 and 38 kda) binding molecules, respectively. similar binding structures were formed when cell wall extracts from these strains were incubated with thrombospondin. these results indicate that specific ligand-receptor interaction between cns and rvwf may contribute to bacterial adhesion and colonisation on biomaterial surfaces. heparin-binding domains of rvwf might be the crucial regions for bacterial attachment. rvwf and thrombospondin may recognise similar molecules in staphylococcal cell wall extracts.

TI  == a comparison of antimicrobial resistance rates in gram-positive pathogens isolated in the uk from october 1996 to january 1997 and october 1997 to january  1998.
AB  == rates of resistance for two consecutive years for 28 centres (10 teaching, nine associate teaching and nine district general hospitals) in the uk were compared.  combined rates of resistance for each of the hospital types of staphylococcus aureus to methicillin revealed an increase in the rate of resistance in teaching  hospitals (12.5% year 1, 23.5% year 2), but, for associate teaching and district  general hospitals rates fell (associate teaching 19.1% year 1, 11.9% year 2; district general 16.5% year 1 and 11.3% year 2). using conventional methodology to determine mics, no strain was considered to have reduced susceptibility to vancomycin. among coagulase-negative staphylococci, increased resistance was observed for staphylococcus epidermidis to rifampicin, for staphylococcus haemolyticus to clindamycin, for staphylococcus saprophyticus to penicillin and for staphylococcus spp. to clindamycin, methicillin and rifampicin. for streptococcus pneumoniae an upward trend in low-level resistance to penicillin was observed (18 of the 28 centres), however, for high-level resistance the trend was in the opposite direction (only four centres showed an increase). for enterococcus faecalis there was a trend to a fall in levels of resistance, the only exception being an increase in high-level gentamicin resistance (10.5% year  1, 15.1% year 2, p = 0.0388). for enterococcus faecium rates of resistance were not significantly different except for increases in resistance to nitrofurantoin  and rifampicin.

TI  == mixed infection in adult bacterial meningitis.
AB  == 12 adult patients suffering from bacterial meningitis caused by mixed infection were identified at kaohsiung chang gung memorial hospital over a period of 13 years (1986-1998), and they accounted for 6.5% (12/184) of our culture-proven adult bacterial meningitis. the 12 cases included seven males and five females, aged 17-74 years. six of the 12 cases had community-acquired infections and the other six had nosocomially-acquired infections. ten of the 12 cases had associated underlying diseases, with head trauma and/or neurosurgical procedure being the most frequent. both gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens were identified in these 12 cases with gram-negative pathogens outnumbering the gram-positive ones. the implicated pathogens, starting with the most frequent, included enterobacter species (enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes), klebsiella species (klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca), escherichia coli, staphylococcus species (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus haemolyticus), pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, enterococcus, serratia marcescens, citrobacter diversus, proteus mirabilis, streptococcus viridans and neisseria meningitidis. six of the 12 cases were found to have multi-antibiotic-resistant strains, which included e. cloacae in one, a. baumannii in one, k. pneumoniae in one and s. aureus in three. the management of  these 12 cases included appropriate antibiotics and neurosurgical procedures including shunt revision. despite the complexity of implicated pathogens and the  high incidence of emergence of resistant strains, the overall mortality rate (8.3%, 1/12) was not higher than that in adult bacterial meningitis. however, complete recuperation was difficult in adult patients with mixed bacterial meningitis.

TI  == coagulase-negative staphylococci and mammary gland infections in cows.
AB  == coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns) are the most frequently isolated bacteria  from bovine mammary gland milk samples. the objective of this study was to determine the type of inflammation evoked by cns in the mammary gland of cows during their first lactation. twenty-four israeli-holstein heifers in their first lactation were tested for bacteriological status, somatic cell count (scc) and differential leucocyte count in milk 60-120 days postparturition and every 50-60  days after until drying off. following the first testing, the 96 quarters of the  24 heifers were classified as follows: 69.8% as no bacterial growth (nbg), 27.1%  infected with cns and 3.1% infected with staphylococcus aureus. during lactation, 84.5% quarters had no change in their classification, 6.2% were newly infected with other pathogens, 3.1% were classified as self-cured and in 6.2% sporadic bacteria were isolated. among the cns, s. intermedius, s. chromogenes and s. haemolyticus were the most frequently isolated. milk from cns-infected quarters had significantly higher scc than milk from nbg quarters. an analysis of the leucocyte pattern in milk from cns vs. nbg quarters revealed a significant increase in polymorphonuclears and a significant decrease in the percentage of total lymphocytes and lymphocytes bearing cd4+ or cd8+. the high percentage of cns-infected quarters that remained unchanged in their bacterial status during the first lactation, indicates that those cns have the ability to elude the immune system and persist in the mammary gland for a long time. the persisting infection, resulting to some extent from an increase of scc by some cns strains,  suggests that in the near future control steps will have to be taken into consideration, in order to enhance the improvement of milk quality.

TI  == distribution of insertion sequence-like element is1272 and its position relative  to methicillin resistance genes in clinically important staphylococci.
AB  == the distribution of insertion sequence-like element is1272 was analyzed for clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and staphylococcus haemolyticus. in each of the staphylococcal species, is1272 was detected in both methicillin-resistant (mr) and methicillin-susceptible strains of different genetic types. in mr isolates, is1272 was generally located downstream of the truncated mecr1 gene (deltamecr1), with an identical junction sequence occurring between deltamecr1 and is1272, although insertion of an additional gene sequence in the junction sequence was detected in one s. epidermidis isolate. these findings suggest that the mec element with the rearranged form of mecr1 (deltamecr1-is1272) has been transmitted to multiple clones of staphylococci.

TI  == outbreak of mupirocin-resistant staphylococci in a hospital in warsaw, poland, due to plasmid transmission and clonal spread of several strains.
AB  == an outbreak of mupirocin-resistant (mur) staphylococci was investigated in two wards of a large hospital in warsaw, poland. fifty-three mur isolates of staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, s. haemolyticus, s. xylosus, and s. capitis were identified over a 17-month survey which was carried out after introduction of the drug for the treatment of skin infections. the isolates were  collected from patients with infections, environmental samples, and carriers; they constituted 19.5% of all staphylococcal isolates identified in the two wards during that time. almost all the mur isolates were also resistant to methicillin  (methicillin-resistant s. aureus and methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci). seven of the outbreak isolates expressed a low-level-resistance phenotype (mul), whereas the remaining majority of isolates were found to be highly resistant to mupirocin (muh). the mupa gene, responsible for the muh phenotype, has been assigned to three different polymorphic loci among the strains in the collection analyzed. the predominant polymorph, polymorph i (characterized by a mupa-containing ecori dna fragment of about 16 kb), was located on a specific plasmid which was widely distributed among the entire staphylococcal population. all mur s. aureus isolates were found to represent a single epidemic strain, which was clonally disseminated in both wards. the s. epidermidis population was much more diverse; however, at least four clusters of  closely related isolates were identified, which suggested that some strains of this species were also clonally spread in the hospital environment. six isolates  of s. epidermidis were demonstrated to express the mul and muh resistance mechanisms simultaneously, and this is the first identification of such dual mur  phenotype-bearing strains. the outbreak was attributed to a high level and inappropriate use of mupirocin, and as a result the dermatological formulation of the drug has been removed from the hospital formulary.

TI  == molecular characterization and transfer among staphylococcus strains of a plasmid conferring high-level resistance to mupirocin.
AB  == in this work, mupirocin resistance was correlated with the presence of plasmids in methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) strains isolated in the rio de janeiro federal university hospital in brazil, where topical mupirocin has been used extensively since 1990. of 19 strains studied, those exhibiting high-level resistance carried a large and relaxable plasmid of about 35 kb. mupirocin-sensitive derivatives, obtained by growth at 42 c of a strain exhibiting high-level resistance, were devoid of the large plasmid, which was designated pmg1. mupirocin resistance was transferred to strain rn8411 during overnight filter-matings at low frequencies (7.0 x 10(-9)/donor). the pmg1 plasmid was shown to be responsible for high-level mupirocin resistance in our isolates and to be incompatible with pgo1. hybridization experiments suggested that mupirocin resistance in pmg1 is due to the presence of the iles-2 gene. the  pmg1 plasmid was successfully and bidirectionally transferred from staphylococcus aureus to staphylococcus epidermidis, suggesting that the latter may be a reservoir of this resistance plasmid. no transfer was detected to staphylococcus  haemolyticus. the development of self-transferable high-level mupirocin resistance should be considered when using mupirocin to control the spread of mrsa in hospitals.

TI  == combinations of vancomycin and beta-lactams are synergistic against staphylococci with reduced susceptibilities to vancomycin.
AB  == evidence of synergism between combinations of vancomycin and beta-lactam antibiotics against 59 isolates of methicillin-resistant staphylococci (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and staphylococcus haemolyticus) for which vancomycin mics ranged from 1 to 16 microg/ml were tested by broth microdilution checkerboard, disk diffusion, agar dilution, and time-kill antimicrobial susceptibility tests. the combination of vancomycin and oxacillin demonstrated synergy by all test methods against 30 of 59 isolates; no antagonism was seen. synergy with vancomycin was also found by modified disk diffusion testing for ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, cefpodoxime, and amoxicillin-clavulanate but not for aztreonam. evidence of synergy correlated directly with vancomycin mics. the efficacy of vancomycin given alone and in combination with nafcillin was tested in the rabbit model of experimental endocarditis caused by three clinical isolates of glycopeptide-intermediate-susceptible s. aureus (gisa) (isolates hip5827, hip5836, and mu50). two of the gisa isolates (isolates mu50 and hip5836) were extremely virulent in this model, with 27 of 42 (64%) animals dying during the 3-day trial. therapy with either vancomycin or nafcillin given as a single agent was ineffective for animals infected with hip5827 or mu50. however, the combination of vancomycin and nafcillin resulted in a mean reduction of 4.52 log10 cfu/g of aortic valvular vegetations per g compared to the reduction for controls for animals infected with hip5827 and a reduction of 4. 15 log10 cfu/g for animals infected with mu50. renal abscesses caused by hip5827 were sterilized significantly better with the combination of vancomycin and nafcillin than by either treatment alone. we conclude that the combination of vancomycin and beta-lactams with antistaphylococcal activity is an effective regimen for the treatment of infections with clinical strains of staphylococci which demonstrate reduced susceptibility to glycopeptides.

TI  == mupirocin resistance in staphylococci: development and transfer of isoleucyl-trna synthetase-mediated resistance in vitro.
AB  == mupirocin resistance could be transferred from highly resistant clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus to highly sensitive recipients of staph. aureus, staph.  epidermidis and staph. haemolyticus. transconjugants of the latter two organisms  could transfer this resistance into mupirocin-sensitive staph. aureus. moderately resistant strains did not transfer this resistance to sensitive recipients, nor did strains with high-level mupirocin resistance developed by serial transfer or  habituation. the inhibitory effects of mupirocin on crude isoleucyl-trna synthetases (irs) isolated from mupirocin-sensitive and -resistant strains of staph. aureus have been determined. drug concentrations needed to produce 50% inhibition, i50 values, were very low against irs from a highly sensitive strain, somewhat higher against irs from moderately resistant strains, much higher against enzyme from strains trained in vitro to high-level resistance, and considerably higher still against irs extracted from clinical isolates possessing high-level mupirocin resistance and from the transconjugates of such strains resulting from crosses with mupirocin-sensitive strains. it is concluded that high-level resistance in clinical isolates is plasmid-mediated involving a second, mupirocin-resistant irs whereas in moderately resistant strains, and in strains trained in vitro to high-level resistance, chromosomal mutations are likely to be responsible for decreasing irs sensitivity.

AB  == from december 1997 to march 1998, 25 methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus  (mrsa) isolates exhibiting negative staphylase (oxoid ltd., basingstoke, england) reactions were identified from various clinical specimens from 13 patients in six intensive care units (icus) or in wards following a stay in an icu at the national taiwan university hospital. the characteristics of these isolates have not been previously noted in other mrsa isolates from this hospital. colonies of  all these isolates were grown on trypticase soy agar supplemented with 5% sheep blood and were nonhemolytic and unpigmented. seven isolates, initially reported as staphylococcus haemolyticus (5 isolates) and staphylococcus epidermidis (2 isolates) by the routine identification scheme and with the vitek gpi system (biomerieux vitek, inc., hazelwood, mo.), were subsequently identified as s. aureus by positive tube coagulase tests, standard biochemical reactions, and characteristic cellular fatty acid chromatograms. the antibiotypes obtained by the e test, coagulase types, restriction fragment length polymorphism profiles of the staphylococcal coagulase gene, and random amplified polymorphic dna patterns  generated by arbitrarily primed pcr of the isolates disclosed that two major clones disseminated in the icus. clone 1 (16 isolates) was resistant to clindamycin and was susceptible to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (tmp-smz) and was coagulase type ii. clone 2 (eight isolates) was resistant to clindamycin and  tmp-smz and was coagulase type iv. these two epidemic clones from icus are unique and underline the need for caution in identifying mrsa strains with colonial morphologies not of the typical type and with negative staphylase reactions.

AB  == seventy laboratories in nine european countries (belgium, france, germany, italy, the netherlands, portugal, spain, switzerland and the uk) each collected 100 consecutive gram-positive bacterial pathogens during 1995. mics were determined by a co-ordinating laboratory in each country using an agar incorporation method  with mueller hinton medium (nccls). quality control was ensured by distribution of five test strains to the co-ordinating laboratories. a total of 7078 isolates  was collected: 2885 staphylococcus aureus, 1706 enterococci, 1480 coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns), 932 streptococcus spp. (including 289 strains of s. pneumoniae) and 75 miscellaneous species. of these, the country coordinators successfully re-tested 6824 isolates. using nccls interpretive criteria, overall 39 isolates (including 28 strains of enterococci) were teicoplanin-resistant (0.57%) and 38 (mostly cns; 0.56%) were intermediate, whilst 32 isolates (including 30 strains of enterococci) were resistant to vancomycin (0.47%) and 7 (all enterococci; 0.10%) were intermediate. the overall  resistance rate was < or = 0.5%. the two glycopeptides were essentially active against the major pathogens encountered in the survey. the only real difference with clinical implications from previously reported susceptibility data is the emergence and spread of resistance in enterococci, particularly in e. faecium. resistance was highest in ssti, uti, bloodstream and gi infections; no resistance was encountered in rti, gynaecological infections or central nervous system infections. this resistance was also geographically diverse: resistance to vancomycin in e. faecalis was present only in france, germany, italy, portugal and spain (italy and spain only for teicoplanin), whilst resistance to teicoplanin and vancomycin in e. faecium was present in all countries except spain. eight isolates (0.5% of all enterococci) were vancomycin-resistant but teicoplanin-susceptible, exhibiting the vanb phenotype. these were four strains of e. faecalis and four strains of e. faecium. whilst isolates of s. haemolyticus had higher mic of teicoplanin than other cns, and were more susceptible to vancomycin, overall resistance to teicoplanin was low (3.3% in s. haemolyticus; 0.6% in cns). s. haemolyticus was a relatively rare pathogen, accounting for 6.3% of all cns isolates, and 1.4% of all gram-positives collected. the results of this survey show that, despite occasional nosocomial problems (e.g. with enterococci and s. haemolyticus), teicoplanin or vancomycin remain adequate therapy for infections caused by gram-positive pathogens in the 1990s.

TI  == european glycopeptide susceptibility survey of gram-positive bacteria for 1995. european glycopeptide resistance survey study group.
AB  == in the european glycopeptide susceptibility survey 7078 gram-positive isolates collected in 1995 from 70 centers in 9 countries of western europe were examined, using a standardized, quantitative susceptibility testing method. of the 7078 isolates, 6824 (96.4%) were tested by the national coordinating centers. teicoplanin (mode mic 0.5 microgram/ml) was generally twice as active as vancomycin (mode mic 1 microgram/ml) against staphylococcus aureus (n = 2852). all isolates were susceptible to vancomycin (mic < or = 4 micrograms/ml) and all  but four to teicoplanin (mic < or = 8 micrograms/ml); these four isolates were of intermediate susceptibility (mic 16 micrograms/ml). with coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 1444), the distribution of mic of teicoplanin was wider than for vancomycin. two and two-tenths percent of coagulase-negative staphylococci excluding staphylococcus haemolyticus required 16 micrograms/ml teicoplanin for inhibition (intermediate) and 0.4% > or = 32 micrograms/ml (resistant). among isolates of s. haemolyticus, 4.4% were of intermediate susceptibility (mic 16 micrograms/ml) and 3.3% were resistant (mic > or = 32 micrograms/ml) to teicoplanin. however, this species represented only 6.3% of the isolates of coagulase-negative staphylococcus spp. generally, teicoplanin (mode mic < or = 0.12 microgram/ml) was four to eight times more active than vancomycin (mode mic  < or = 0.5 microgram/ml) against the 770 streptococcal isolates. glycopeptide-susceptible enterococcus spp. (n = 1695) were generally four times more susceptible to teicoplanin (mode mic 0.25 microgram/ml) than to vancomycin (mode mic 1 microgram/ml). combined vancomycin and teicoplanin (vana phenotype) resistance was observed more frequently (9.3%) in isolates of enterococcus faecium than in enterococcus faecalis (0.8%). four isolates of unspeciated enterococci (1.4%) also expressed this resistance phenotype. four isolates of e.  faecium and four of e. faecalis expressed the vanb-type (low-level, vancomycin only) resistance. spain was the only country not to submit resistant e. faecium strains while resistant e. faecalis isolates came only from spain and italy.

TI  == an inexpensive and reliable method for routine identification of staphylococcal species.
AB  == the aim of this study was to develop a simple, reliable, and inexpensive in-house system for routine species identification of staphylococci in clinical practice.  the system combines 15 key tests (including carbohydrate fermentation) performed  in micro-well strips and antimicrobial disk diffusion susceptibility tests performed on standardised paper disk method antibiotic sensitivity medium agar. twenty-eight staphylococcal reference strains belonging to 18 different species were correctly identified using this in-house system. a total of 291 clinical staphylococci isolates were evaluated with the in-house system and a conventional identification scheme. the in-house system identified 281 (96.6%) of these 291 isolates. eleven different species were recognised. the five species most frequently identified were staphylococcus epidermidis (48.6%), staphylococcus aureus (27.8%), staphylococcus haemolyticus (8.2%), staphylococcus hominis (5.7%), and staphylococcus warneri (5.3%). there was an agreement of 86.3% between the species identification obtained with the in-house system and the conventional identification scheme. all coagulase-negative isolates initially identified as species other than staphylococcus epidermidis as well as indistinctly identified isolates were also evaluated with a commercial identification system. the agreement between species identification obtained with the in-house system and the commercial system for 101 identified isolates was 73%. several isolates that were difficult to distinguish with the conventional scheme and/or the commercial system were identified with the aid of the antimicrobial susceptibility test included in the in-house system. the described  test scheme should be of value for identification of clinically significant staphylococci species.

TI  == sirr, a novel iron-dependent repressor in staphylococcus epidermidis.
AB  == in staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus aureus, a number of cell wall- and cytoplasmic membrane-associated lipoproteins are induced in response to iron  starvation. to gain insights into the molecular basis of iron-dependent gene regulation in the staphylococci, we sequenced the dna upstream of the 3-kb s. epidermidis sitabc operon, which northern blot analysis indicates is transcriptionally regulated by the growth medium iron content. we identified two  dna sequences which are homologous to elements of the corynebacterium diphtheriae dtxr regulon, which controls, in response to iron stress, for example, production of diphtheria toxin, siderophore, and a heme oxygenase. upstream of the sitabc operon and divergently transcribed lies a 645-bp open reading frame (orf), which  codes for a polypeptide of approximately 25 kda with homology to the dtxr family  of metal-dependent repressor proteins. this orf has been designated sirr (staphylococcal iron regulator repressor). within the sitabc promoter/operator region, we also located a region of dyad symmetry overlapping the transcriptional start of sitabc which shows high homology to the dtxr operator consensus sequence, suggesting that this region, termed the sir box, is the sirr-binding site. the sirr protein was overexpressed, purified, and used in dna mobility shift assays; sirr retarded the migration of a synthetic oligonucleotide based on the sir box in a metal (fe2+ or mn2+)-dependent manner, providing confirmatory evidence that this motif is the sirr-binding site. furthermore, southern blot analysis of staphylococcal chromosomal dna with the synthetic sir box as a probe  confirmed that there are at least five sir boxes in the s. epidermidis genome and at least three in the genome of s. aureus, suggesting that sirr controls the expression of multiple target genes. using a monospecific polyclonal antibody raised against sirr to probe western blots of whole-cell lysates of s. aureus, s. carnosus, s. epidermidis, s. hominis, s. cohnii, s. lugdunensis, and s. haemolyticus, we identified an approximately 25-kda cross-reactive protein in each of the staphylococcal species examined. taken together, these data suggest that sirr functions as a divalent metal cation-dependent transcriptional repressor which is widespread among the staphylococci.

TI  == the pattern of micro-organisms and the efficacy of new macrolide in acute lower respiratory tract infections.
AB  == lower respiratory tract infection (lrti) is one of the major health problems in developing countries such as indonesia. according to the national household health survey conducted by the ministry of health in 1992, lrtis still rank fourth as the main cause of death in indonesia. the problem of lrtis could be simply managed as long as the causative organism can be identified and the proper antibiotic known. in some occasions, it is not quite so easy to identify the causative micro-organism, especially in lower tract infections. there are several methods of obtaining specimens from lrtis for cultures. the easiest, most simple  way is to collect expectorated sputum. unfortunately, because of the high rate of contamination by upper respiratory tract flora, this method is not reliable. recognizing the difficulties with routine expectorated sputum cultures, two alternative approaches have been suggested. one approach is to bypass potential expectorated sputum 'contaminants' in the oropharynx by transtracheal aspiration  or transthoracic aspiration. the second approach is to modify the usual technique of processing expectorated sputum by either washing techniques or by quantitative cultures. azithromycin and clarithromycin are chemically related to macrolide erithromycin. both antibiotics retain the traditional macrolide spectrum of activity against gram-positive and atypical pneumonia pathogens, while demonstrating improved activity against gram-negative bacteria. the american thoracic society (ats) recommended the use of macrolide for outpatients with community-acquired pneumonia, without comorbidity and 60 years of age or younger. a total of 34 outpatients with acute lrtis were open-comparative, randomly allocated to treatment with the new macrolide in persahabatan hospital, jakarta,  1996. the purposes of this study were: (i) to identify the causative micro-organisms; and (ii) to evaluate the clinical efficacy of the new macrolide  in these infections. azithromycin 500 mg was given orally once a day for 3 days and was administered 1 h before or 2 h after every meal. clarithromycin 500 mg was given orally every 12 h for 10 days. the diagnosis of the patients were: 16 with pneumonia, 10 with acute bronchitis and 8 with acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis. in this study of 34 patients, the sputum specimens were washed with n acetylcysteine before culture and we could only detect micro-organisms in one patient. before treatment, we found 47 strains in 33 (97.05%) patients and after  treatment we found five strains. from serological examination, only four (11.76%) atypical bacterial were detected. the most frequently found microorganisms were 23 strains of klebsiella pneumoniae (40.42%), 10 of streptococcus alpha haemolyticus (21.26%), five of streptococcus pneumoniae (10.63%) and five of staphylococcus aureus (10.63%). the atypical bacterial were: two legionella pneumophila, one mycoplasma pneumoniae and one chlamydia pneumoniae. the clinical efficacy of new macrolides were 100% and the bacteriological responses with eradication of 94.12% vs 70.59% of isolates in the azithromycin and clarithromycin groups are shown in table 1. there were no adverse reactions detected in the two treatment groups until the end of the study.

TI  == molecular cloning of a 32-kilodalton lipoprotein component of a novel iron-regulated staphylococcus epidermidis abc transporter.
AB  == our previous studies identified two iron-regulated cytoplasmic membrane proteins  of 32 and 36 kda expressed by both staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus  aureus. in this study we show by triton x-114 phase partitioning and tritiated palmitic acid labelling that these proteins are lipoproteins which are anchored into the cytoplasmic membrane by their lipid-modified n termini. in common with those of some other gram-positive bacteria, these highly immunogenic lipoproteins were released from the bacterial cell into the culture supernatants, with release being promoted by growth of the bacteria under iron-restricted conditions. immunoelectron microscopy with a monospecific rabbit antiserum to the 32-kda s. epidermidis lipoprotein showed that the majority of the antigen was distributed throughout the staphylococcal cell wall. only minor quantities were detected in the cytoplasmic membrane, and exposure of the lipoprotein on the bacterial surface was minimal. a monoclonal antibody raised to the 32-kda lipoprotein of s. aureus was used in immunoblotting studies to investigate the conservation of this antigen among a variety of staphylococci. the monoclonal antibody reacted with polypeptides of 32 kda in s. epidermidis and s. aureus and of 40 kda in staphylococcus hominis. no reactivity was detected with staphylococcus lugdunensis, staphylococcus cohni, or staphylococcus haemolyticus. the gene encoding the 32-kda lipoprotein from s. epidermidis has been isolated from a lambda zap ii genomic dna library and found to be a component of an iron-regulated operon encoding a novel abc-type transporter. the operon contains  three genes, designated sita, -b, and -c, encoding an atpase, a cytoplasmic membrane protein, and the 32-kda lipoprotein, respectively. sitc shows significant homology both with a number of bacterial adhesins, including fima of  streptococcus parasanguis and scaa of streptococcus gordonii, and with lipoproteins of a recently described family of abc transporters with proven or putative metal ion transport functions. although the solute specificity of this novel transporter has not yet been determined, we speculate that it may be involved in either siderophore- or transferrin-mediated iron uptake in s. epidermidis.

TI  == distribution of staphylococcus species among human clinical specimens and emended description of staphylococcus caprae.
AB  == by dna-dna hybridization on microplates, we identified 1,230 strains of staphylococci from human clinical specimens and determined the distribution of species. the 10 staphylococcus species isolated most often were s. epidermidis (31.3%), s. aureus (23.3%), s. haemolyticus (12.2%), s. caprae (10.7%), s. simulans (4.4%), s. hominis (4.0%), s. capitis (3.9%), s. saprophyticus (3.6%), s. warneri (2.2%), and s. lugdunensis (1.3%). from these results, we realized that s. caprae strains were widely distributed in human clinical specimens. the description in bergey's manual of systematic bacteriology indicates that no strains of s. caprae produce acid from fructose and mannitol, but all our s. caprae strains produced acid from fructose and mannitol. consequently, many strains of s. caprae isolated from human clinical specimens have been misidentified as s. haemolyticus or s. hominis by conventional biochemical tests. in this paper, we propose an emended description of s. caprae.

TI  == soft salt-mannitol agar-cloxacillin test: a highly specific bedside screening test for detection of colonization with methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == the early detection of colonization with methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) of patients in intensive-care units is an essential step in the strategy for preventing mrsa epidemics. in this study, tubes containing soft salt-mannitol agar with cloxacillin (6 microg/ml) (ssmac) were prepared for inoculation of clinical samples at patients' bedsides by personnel of an intensive-care unit. a total of 1,914 swabs from different sample sites of 81 patients were dipped into ssmac tubes, and after 24 h of incubation (in an incubator located near the intensive-care unit), an evident color change was considered by the intensive-care-unit personnel to be an mrsa alarm. sixty-three  (3.3%) ssmac tubes were considered positive for mrsa, 1,827 (95.4%) were considered negative, and 24 (1.2%) were considered intermediate. compared with values for parallel conventional surveillance cultures for mrsa, excluding tubes  with intermediate results, the ssmac test had a sensitivity of 72.7%, a specificity of 99.2%, a positive predictive value of 76.2%, and a negative predictive value of 99.0%. when intermediate tubes were considered positive, the  corresponding values were 75.3, 98.2, 63.2, and 99.0%, respectively. the sensitivity and specificity values of the test to identify mrsa-colonized patients were 89.4 and 100%, respectively. oropharyngeal and naris specimens were the most reliable samples for mrsa detection. false-negative results were frequent in bronchial aspirates with low (< 10(3) to 10(6) cfu/ml) mrsa counts. false-positive results were mainly due to methicillin-resistant staphylococcus haemolyticus. the ssmac tube is a useful, rapid, and inexpensive tool for the early identification of mrsa-colonized patients and, consequently, for the implementation of measures to prevent the spread of mrsa.

TI  == determination of the chromosomal relationship between meca and gyra in methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci.
AB  == meca, the gene that mediates methicillin resistance, and its accompanying mec locus dna, insert near the gyra gene in staphylococcus aureus. to investigate whether there is a similar relationship between meca and gyra in coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns), meca- and gyra-specific dna fragments were used to probe methicillin-resistant isolates of staphylococcus epidermidis (mrse) (n = 11) and staphylococcus haemolyticus (mrsh) (n = 11). the gyra probe hybridized to the same smai dna fragment as the meca probe in all strains tested. however, since the size of the smai fragments containing meca and gyra varied from 73 to 600 kb, the distance between the two genes was determined more precisely. cloned meca or gyra fragments plus vector sequences each containing a  smai site were introduced into the chromosome of three isolates each of mrse and  methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), and the sizes of the generated smai fragments were determined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. the distance between gyra and meca was found to be between 38 and 42 kb in both mrse and mrsa, and the two genes were in the same relative orientation in all strains. restriction fragment length polymorphism (rflp) patterns around the gyra gene in  cns were identical, but species specific, for all 10 mrse and 10 mrsh isolates examined. in contrast, 8 of 11 methicillin-susceptible s. epidermidis isolates and 7 of 7 methicillin-susceptible s. haemolyticus isolates had different gyra rflp patterns. these data show that meca is site and orientation specific, relative to gyra, in both mrse and mrsa. in addition, the local environment around gyra in methicillin-resistant cns, in contrast to methicillin-susceptible  isolates, is similar, suggesting clonality or the requirement for specific dna sequences with which the mec complex must interact for chromosomal integration to occur.

TI  == identification of staphylococcus species and subspecies by the chaperonin 60 gene identification method and reverse checkerboard hybridization.
AB  == a previous study (s. h. goh et al., j. clin. microbiol. 34:818-823, 1996) demonstrated that a 600-bp region of the chaperonin 60 (cpn60) genes from various bacterial isolates could be amplified by pcr with a pair of degenerate primers and that the products could be used as species-specific probes for staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, s. haemolyticus, s. lugdunensis, s. saprophyticus, and s. schleiferi. to further validate the utility of bacterial cpn60 genes as universal targets for bacterial identification (id), reverse checkerboard chemiluminescent  hybridization experiments were performed with dna probes from 34 different staphylococcus species and subspecies. with the exception of probes from the cpn60 genes of s. intermedius and s. delphini, which cross hybridized, all were species specific. two subspecies of both s. capitis and s. cohnii were differentiated from one another, while dnas from the two s. schleiferi subspecies cross hybridized. when 40 known staphylococcus isolates were tested in a blind experiment by the cpn60 gene method, 36 strains, representing six species and one subspecies (s. sciuri, s. caseolyticus, s. hominis, s. warneri, s. hyicus, s. haemolyticus, and s. capitis subsp. ureolyticus), were correctly identified. dna  from the four remaining isolates, known to be s. hyicus bovine strains, failed to hybridize to dna from the s. hyicus target strain or any other staphylococcus species. however, dnas from these s. hyicus isolates did cross hybridize with each other. new dna sequence data and evidence from previous studies suggest some genetic divergence between the two groups of s. hyicus isolates. our results demonstrate that this cpn60 gene-based id method has the potential to be a basic  method for bacterial id. studies are in progress to further validate the utility  of this cpn60 gene system for id of staphylococcus and other genera, including those of slow-growing microorganisms.

AB  == ly333328 is a semisynthetic n-alkyl derivative of ly264826, a naturally occurring structural analog of vancomycin. ly333328 was evaluated for its in vitro inhibitory and bactericidal activities in comparison with those of the two currently available glycopeptides (vancomycin and teicoplanin). glycopeptide-susceptible test strains included a total of 311 isolates (most of clinical origin) from the genera staphylococcus, enterococcus, streptococcus, aerococcus, gemella, lactococcus, listeria, corynebacterium, and clostridium. test strains resistant or intermediate to vancomycin and/or teicoplanin included  56 clinical isolates of enterococcus (of the vana, vanb, and vanc phenotypes) and 32 clinical isolates of staphylococcus (s. haemolyticus, s. epidermidis, and s. aureus), 31 strains of gram-positive genera outside the spectrum of activity of vancomycin (leuconostoc, pediococcus, lactobacillus, and erysipelothrix), and laboratory-derived organisms obtained after exposure of susceptible staphylococcus isolates to teicoplanin (6 strains) or laboratory-derived organisms with resistance determinants received from vana enterococci (2 enterococcus and 25 listeria transconjugants). ly333328 was highly active against staphylococci, enterococci, and listeriae (whether they were clinical or laboratory-derived strains) resistant to the currently available glycopeptides. in particular, the mics of ly333328 did not vary substantially between teicoplanin-susceptible and teicoplanin-resistant staphylococci and between vancomycin-susceptible and vancomycin-resistant enterococci. ly333328 demonstrated fairly good inhibitory activity even against most strains of leuconostoc, pediococcus, and erysipelothrix (mic range, 1 to 8 microg/ml), whereas it proved less active (although much more active than vancomycin or teicoplanin) against lactobacillus strains. in minimal bactericidal concentration (mbc) and time-kill studies, ly333328 demonstrated excellent bactericidal activity; enterococci, in particular, which were largely tolerant of vancomycin and teicoplanin, were uniformly killed by ly333328, with mbc-to-mic ratios of 4 to 8 for most vancomycin-susceptible and vancomycin-resistant strains. in attempts to select for resistant clones, no survivors stably growing in the presence of 10 microg of ly333328 per ml were obtained from the staphylococcus and enterococcus test strains exposed to the drug.

AB  == pcr-amplified trna gene (tdna) intergenic spacer length polymorphism (tdna-ilp) was analyzed for its ability to identify to the species level type strains (n = 18) and clinical isolates (n = 163) of staphylococci. amplified products obtained by pcr with outwardly directed consensus tdna primers were separated by agarose and polyacrylamide gel electrophoreses. the results were compared with those obtained by biochemical identification and ribotyping. each type strain presented a specific tdna-ilp pattern. pcr with fluorescent primers allowed for the detection of labelled dna fragments on polyacrylamide gels by using an automated  laser fluorescence sequencer and provided enhanced pattern resolution in comparison with that by analysis on agarose gels. tdna patterns indistinguishable from those of the type strains were produced by clinical isolates of all tested species except for some isolates of s. aureus (n = 3) and s. haemolyticus (n = 1), which showed variant patterns. strains of s. saprophyticus and s. xylosus showed very closely related profiles, and s. cohnii subspecies were indistinguishable. the identities obtained by tdna-ilp analysis agreed with those obtained by the biochemical method to the species level for 99% (162 of 163) of the strains tested and to the subspecies level for 96% (156 of 163) of the strains tested. these results indicate that fluorescence-labelled pcr analysis of tdna-ilp provides an accurate and rapid molecular method for the identification of human staphylococci.

AB  == a conjugative plasmid, pxu10, encoding high-level mupirocin resistance was transferred from a staphylococcus haemolyticus isolate, cn216, to other coagulase-negative staphylococci and a restriction deficient staphylococcus aureus strain, xu21, but not to clinical isolates or a restriction-proficient laboratory strain (strain wbg541) of s. aureus. however, from xu21 it was cotransferred with a 3.5-kb chloramphenicol resistance plasmid to wbg541. the results demonstrated the ability of pxu10 to mobilize nonconjugative plasmids.

TI  == synergistic hemolytic activity of staphylococcus lugdunensis is mediated by three peptides encoded by a non-agr genetic locus.
AB  == some strains of the coagulase-negative staphylococcus lugdunensis produce a synergistic hemolytic activity (slush), phenotypically similar to the delta-hemolysin of s. aureus. reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography of supernatants from s. lugdunensis 307 yielded three late-eluting peaks of 3.5 kda with synergistic hemolytic activity. a degenerate oligonucleotide probe was designed from partial amino acid sequences of the 23-amino-acid (aa) tryptic fragments from one of the three peaks and hybridized to a single 2.8-kb hindiii chromosomal fragment. the relevant portion of this fragment was cloned by pcr, and sequencing showed the presence of three related open reading frames (orfs), slush-a, slush-b, and slush-c, preceded by an unrelated short potentially coding  sequence (orf-x), cotranscribed on a polycistronic 838-nucleotide mrna. the amino acid sequences of the peptides from the three peaks align perfectly with the predicted sequences from the three slush orfs (peak i = slush-b; peak ii = slush-c; peak iii = slush-a). these three peptides are closely related (amino acid homology, >76%) and do not show significant homology to s. aureus delta-hemolysin but do resemble a salmonella typhimurium invasin and the "gonococcal growth inhibitor," a bacteriocin secreted by staphylococcus haemolyticus. the predicted orf-x gene product is a 24-aa peptide with no homology to the slush peptides.

AB  == the species, meca gene, beta-lactamase activity, the ability of slime formation and drug susceptibilities of 386 strains of staphylococci which were isolated from blood in our laboratory were studied. the coagulase typing of each strains identified as s. aureus was also determined. these 386 strains consisted of various species, e.g., s. aureus, s. epidermidis, s. capitis, s. caprae, s. hominis, s. simulans, s. haemolyticus, and s. lugdunensis. meca (methicillin-resistant gene) was detected in 84 (67.7%) of 124 s. aureus and 195  (75.3%) of 259 cns, but there was no statistical difference. however meca positive rate was higher in s. epidermidis and s. caprae, lower in s. hominis compared with s. aureus, s. lugdunensis having meca has not been reported, but one of two our s. lugdunensis strains had meca. the positive rate (77.4%: 65/84)  of beta-lactamase of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) was lower than that (95.5%: 187/195) of methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (mrcns). concerning the ability of slime formation, cns had higher  positive rate, especially in case of mrcns (46.2%: 84/182) than s. aureus. on the other hand, mrcns showed a tendency to be less resistant to some antimicrobials than mrsa. especially against cephalothin (cet), the resistant rate of mrsa and mrcns were 86.9% and 5.6%, respectively. among the main species of mrcns, s. capitis and s. caprae were more resistant than s. epidermidis and s. simulans to  cefaclor (ccl), cefmetazole (cmz), flomoxef (fmox) and fosfomycin (fom). hereafter, one should be careful about infectious disease caused by cns especially in immuno-compromised host, because many species of cns have higher positive rate of beta-lactamase and slime formation than s. aureus beside meca.

AB  == in 1994, microbiology laboratories of ten portuguese hospitals analysed isolated  microorganisms found in blood and urine samples and studied antimicrobial susceptibilities of the most frequent bacterial pathogens. from 63780 blood samples, the most frequent were staphylococcus spp. and from 69189 urine samples  significant numbers of escherichia coli, enterococcus spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa and candida spp. were isolated. escherichia coli strains (c.7000) revealed a low percentage of resistance to antibiotics with the exceptions of ampicillin (48%) and co-trimoxazol (25%). klebsiella pneumoniae isolates (c.2000) revealed important resistance to ampicillin (98%), cephalotin (31%), co-trimoxazol (38%) and gentamicin (28%), while values for 3rd generation cephalosporins varied among hospitals, with several strains showing phenotype of  extended-spectrum beta-lactamase. a great variation in resistance values of p. aeruginosa (c.4000) was found in relation to the antibiotics as well as to the hospitals. resistance to methicillin in s. aureus (c.6000) was high, reaching an  average of 47%, and it was even higher with s. epidermidis (c.3000) and s. haemolyticus (c.650). only vancomycin was always active against these strains. in e. faecalis (c.2500) resistance was of 2% to ampicillin, 35% to gentamicin, 45% to streptomycin and 1% to vancomycin. e. faecium isolates (c.300) showed the most worrying results with 70% resistance to ampicillin, 42% to gentamicin, 59% to streptomycin and 9% (30 strains isolated in 5 hospitals) to vancomycin. vancomycin resistant strains were also resistant to all other antibiotics.

TI  == characterization of is1272, an insertion sequence-like element from staphylococcus haemolyticus.
AB  == we have previously shown (g. l. archer, d. m. niemeyer, j. a. thanassi, and m. j. pucci, antimicrob. agents chemother. 38:447-454, 1994) that some methicillin-resistant staphylococcal isolates contain a partial deletion of the genes (mecr1 and meci) that regulate the transcription of the methicillin resistance structural gene (meca). when a fragment of dna inserted at the point of the mecr1 deletion was used as a probe, hybridization with multiple bands was  detected for staphylococcus haemolyticus genomic dna. in the present study, dna sequencing of four unique clones recovered from a lambda library of s. haemolyticus revealed identical 1,934-bp elements. each element, designated is1272, contained 16-bp terminal inverted repeats (sequence identity, 15 of 16 bp) and two open reading frames of 819 and 687 bp; there were no flanking target  site duplications. database searches yielded amino acid homology with proteins predicted to be encoded by open reading frames from a putative insertion sequence element from enterococcus hirae. dna probes from each end and the middle of is1272 were hybridized with restriction endonuclease-digested genomic dna from clinical s. haemolyticus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and staphylococcus aureus isolates. each of the 20 or more copies of the element found in s. haemolyticus isolates was intact, and copies were found in most chromosomal smai fragments. s. aureus and s. epidermidis isolates contained mostly incomplete fragments of the element, and there were many more hybridizing fragments in methicillin-resistant  than in methicillin-susceptible isolates. is1272, which appears to be primarily resident in s. haemolyticus, has disseminated to multiple staphylococcal species  and is prevalent in multiresistant isolates.

TI  == hsp60 gene sequences as universal targets for microbial species identification: studies with coagulase-negative staphylococci.
AB  == a set of universal degenerate primers which amplified, by pcr, a 600-bp oligomer  encoding a portion of the 60-kda heat shock protein (hsp60) of both staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis were developed. however, when used as a dna probe, the 600-bp pcr product generated from s. epidermidis failed to cross-hybridize under high-stringency conditions with the genomic dna of s. aureus and vice versa. to investigate whether species-specific sequences might exist within the highly conserved hsp60 genes among different staphylococci, digoxigenin-labelled hsp60 probes generated by the degenerate hsp60 primers were prepared from the six most commonly isolated staphylococcus species (s. aureus 8325-4, s. epidermidis 9759, s. haemolyticus atcc 29970, s. schleiferi atcc 43808, s. saprophyticus kl122, and s. lugdunensis crsn 850412). these probes were used for dot blot hybridization with genomic dna of 58 reference and clinical isolates of staphylococcus and non-staphylococcus species. these six staphylococcus species hsp60 probes correctly identified the entire set of staphylococcal isolates. the species specificity of these hsp60 probes was further demonstrated by dot blot hybridization with pcr-amplified dna from mixed  cultures of different staphylococcus species and by the partial dna sequences of  these probes. in addition, sequence homology searches of the ncbi blast databases with these partial hsp60 dna sequences yielded the highest matching scores for both s. epidermidis and s. aureus with the corresponding species-specified probes. finally, the hsp60 degenerate primers were shown to amplify an anticipated 600-bp pcr product from all 29 staphylococcus species and from all but 2 of 30 other microbial species, including various gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, mycobacteria, and fungi. these preliminary data suggest the presence of species-specific sequence variation within the highly conserved hsp60 genes of staphylococci. further work is required to determine whether these degenerate hsp60 primers may be exploited for species-specific microbic identification and phylogenetic investigation of staphylococci and perhaps other  microorganisms in general.

TI  == antibacterial activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin. rationale for clinical use.
AB  == most gram-positive organisms are highly susceptible to the streptogramin, quinupristin/dalfopristin (rp 59500; synercid). minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of isolates (mic90) were < or = 1 mg/l for staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, s. haemolyticus, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes and listeria  monocytogenes. importantly, quinupristin/dalfopristin shows similar activity against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains of s. aureus, and streptococci with benzylpenicillin (penicillin g)- or erythromycin-acquired resistance. enterococci have varying susceptibility to quinupristin /dalfopristin, although most isolates tested are susceptible to the drug, including vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant enterococcus faecium. e. faecalis are generally the least susceptible. among the gram-negative respiratory pathogens moraxella catarrhalis is susceptible and haemophilus influenzae is moderately susceptible to quinupristin/ dalfopristin; however, enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. are resistant.  the drug is active against anaerobic organisms tested, including clostridium perfringens, lactobacillus spp., bacteroides fragilis and peptostreptococcus. synergy has been demonstrated in vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant e. faecium, and methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. aureus with the combination  of vancomycin and quinupristin/ dalfopristin. quinupristin/dalfopristin shows antibacterial activity in vivo in animal models of infection, including methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. aureus infection in rabbits, s. aureus and s. pneumoniae in mice, and erythromycin-sensitive and -resistant viridans group streptococci infections in rats. the drug is rapidly bactericidal against gram-positive organisms (with the exception of enterococci) at concentrations similar to or within 4-fold of the mic, and it has a long postantibiotic effect both in vitro and in vivo.

TI  == susceptibility of staphylococci and enterococci to glycopeptides comparison of 3  test methods.
AB  == the significance of grampositive bacteria, especially staphylococci and enterococci, as nosocomial pathogens has increased in the last decade. furthermore, resistance to commonly used antibiotics like beta-lactams has also become more common and even resistance to glycopeptides has been observed. we evaluated the susceptibility of 150 staphylococcal clinical isolates (52 s. epidermidis, 52 s. haemolyticus, 10 s. saprophyticus, 10 s. hominis, 4 s. warneri, 4 s. simulans, 4 s. capitis and 14 s. aureus) and of 50 enterococci (49  e. faecalis, 1 e. faecium) to the glycopeptides, vancomycin and teicoplanin. the  data from the agar dilution test used as reference method were compared with the  results from the e test and the agar disk diffusion test. concerning vancomycin,  no resistance among all the staphylococcal isolates was observed whereas one single enterococcal strain (e. faecium) proved to be resistant. the overall resistance of staphylococcal isolates against teicoplanin was about 10.7% (15 s.  haemolyticus, 1 s. epidermidis) being mainly due to the high proportion of s. haemolyticus strains (52 out of 150) among the staphylococcal isolates. teicoplanin resistance among the enterococci was not detected. for vancomycin, a  very close correlation between the mics from the agar dilution test and the e test was noticed. as concerns teicoplanin, the mics from the e-test were usually  somewhat lower than those obtained by the agar dilution test. no correlation was  found between the mics of resistant and intermediate staphylococcal strains and the results from the teicoplanin agar disk diffusion test. for routine teicoplanin susceptibility testing of staphylococci, the determination of the mic (e.g., by the e test) is much more reliable for detecting resistant strains than  the agar disk diffusion test.

AB  == the in vitro activity of wy-49605 (sun5555) (wy) was compared with those of cefaclor, cefixime, and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid against 2,958 consecutive clinical isolates from five medical centers and 402 respiratory pathogens from 18 other facilities. most members of the family enterobacteriaceae were inhibited by wy (mic at which 50% of the isolates are inhibited [mic50], < or = 2.0 micrograms/ml). mic90s of > or = 8.0 micrograms/ml were observed for enterobacter cloacae, serratia spp., and proteus mirabilis. wy was the most active drug against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mic90, 0.12 microgram/ml)  and other coagulase-negative staphylococci (mic90, 4.0 micrograms/ml). the four drugs were not active against nonenteric gram-negative bacilli, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus haemolyticus. at  2.0 micrograms/ml, wy inhibited 82% of enterococcus faecalis strains and was equal to or superior to the other drugs against streptococci, haemophilus influenzae, and moraxella catarrhalis.

TI  == antibacterial activity of wy-49605 compared with those of six other oral agents and selection of disk content for disk diffusion susceptibility testing.
AB  == the in vitro antimicrobial activity of an oral penem, wy-49605, was compared with those of six other oral antimicrobial agents against 598 bacterial isolates representing 51 different species. wy-49605 exhibited good activity against most  gram-positive bacteria and members of the family enterobacteriaceae. it had little activity against nonfermenting gram-negative bacilli, enterobacter spp., serratia spp., enterococci, staphylococcus haemolyticus, and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus. its activity was unaffected by the beta-lactamases of neisseria gonorrhoeae, haemophilus influenzae, and staphylococci. disk diffusion susceptibility tests were performed with 5-, 10-, 15-, and 30-micrograms wy-49605 disks. the 5-micrograms disk is recommended, with tentative breakpoints of > or = 16 mm for susceptibility (mic, < or = 2.0 microgram/ml) and < or = 12 mm for resistance (mic, > or = 8.0 micrograms/ml).

TI  == subspecies discrimination of staphylococci from revision arthroplasties by ribotyping.
AB  == sixty-six cultures of staphylococcus spp. were obtained from bone and tissue samples collected from 37 patients during revision arthroplasties and were speciated and ribotyped to assess strain diversity in each species. there were 10 ribotypes among 51 isolates of s. epidermidis, three among three isolates of s. capitis, two among four isolates of s. aureus and two among two isolates of s. simulans. one ribotype was found among each of: two isolates of s. warneri; two isolates of s. haemolyticus and single isolates of s. cohnii and s. saprophyticus. low molecular weight bands of ribotype patterns characterized one  or two related species whereas high molecular weight bands were useful for distinguishing types within species. specimens from 17 patients yielded more than one isolate of staphylococcus spp. in 13 of these patients the isolates were representatives of a single species but in only eight did ribotyping show the isolates to be identical. the findings of multiple species and ribotypes from samples taken from the same patient may have implications for understanding the nature of infection in revision arthroplasty and for antibiotic therapy.

TI  == evaluation of staphylococci isolated from a blood culture system (colorbact).
AB  == during a one-year period, all blood cultures positive for staphylococci from two  of the smaller danish counties with non-university hospitals only were evaluated. the isolates were speciated and coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons) were biotyped. furthermore, antibiogram, phage typing and lectin typing were performed for all isolates. clinical information was obtained by telephone, and before any  bacteriological identification was performed, a preliminary judgment was made as  to whether the positive blood culture was of clinical significance. a total of 3,500 blood cultures were evaluated and 426 (12.2%) were positive. one hundred and sixty blood cultures from 137 patients contained staphylococci; 36 of these patients had a pure culture of staphylococcus aureus. one hundred and twenty-four cons were found and identified as s. epidermidis (81), s. hominis (19), s. haemolyticus (8), s. simulans (1), and micrococcus species (3), and another 12 staphylococcal isolates which could not be identified to species level. a total of 35 patients had mixed cultures, including 6 with s. aureus as one of the isolates and 15 with mixed cons. clinical relevance was estimated in 90% of cases where the later bacterial identification showed s. aureus, whereas clinical relevance was absent in the majority of cases including cons. methicillin and gentamicin resistance was absent among s. aureus, but frequent among cons, especially s. epidermidis, where 40% were resistant to methicillin and 30% to gentamicin.

AB  == the fibronectin-binding proteins of staphylococcus aureus are considered to be important virulence factors for colonisation and infection. the polymerase chain  reaction (pcr) was used to detect part of a gene equivalent to the fbna gene of s. aureus in 120 isolates of staphylococci (s. aureus, s. epidermidis, s. haemolyticus, s. simulans, s. hominis, s. warneri, s. cohnii and s. lugdunensis). primers specific for the binding domain region of the fbna gene of s. aureus produced pcr products of the predicted sizes (93 and 207 bp). the identity of the pcr products was confirmed by digestion with ddei and nucleic acid hybridisation. the fibronectin-binding activity of the staphylococci was determined with a particle agglutination assay (paa). the fbn gene was found to be present by pcr in 107 of the 120 staphylococci tested, irrespective of their site of isolation,  and expression of the gene was detected by paa in 101 of the 120 strains.

TI  == staphylococcus haemolyticus contains two d-glutamic acid biosynthetic activities, a glutamate racemase and a d-amino acid transaminase.
AB  == two d-glutamic acid biosynthetic activities, glutamate racemase and d-amino acid  transaminase, have been described previously for bacteria. to date, no bacterial  species has been reported to possess both activities. genetic complementation studies using escherichia coli wm335, a d-glutamic acid auxotroph, and cloned chromosomal dna fragments from staphylococcus haemolyticus revealed two distinct  dna fragments containing open reading frames which, when present, allowed growth  on medium without exogenous d-glutamic acid. amino acid sequences of the two open reading frames derived from the dna nucleotide sequences indicated extensive identity with the amino acid sequence of pediococcus pentosaceous glutamate racemase in one case and with that of the d-amino acid transaminase of bacillus spp. in the second case. enzymatic assays of lysates of e. coli wm335 strains containing either the cloned staphylococcal racemase or transminase verified the  identities of these activities. subsequent dna hybridization experiments indicated that staphylococcus aureus, in addition to s. haemolyticus, contained homologous chromosomal dna for each of these genes. these data suggest that s. haemolyticus, and probably s. aureus, contains genes for two d-glutamic acid biosynthetic activities, a glutamate racemase (dga gene) and a d-amino acid transaminase (dat gene).

TI  == antistaphylococcal activity of cefdinir, a new oral third-generation cephalosporin, alone and in combination with other antibiotics, at supra- and sub-mic levels.
AB  == cefdinir is one of the few oral third generation cephalosporins that shows useful activity against nosocomial gram-positive pathogens. for this reason the anti-staphylococcal potency of the new drug, alone or in combination with other drugs was further characterized. against penicillin-resistant, oxacillin-susceptible staphylococcus isolates, cefdinir demonstrated useful in-vitro activity. mic90 values (in mg/l) were 0.25 for staphylococcus aureus (30 strains), 0.06 for staphylococcus epidermidis (24), 0.125 for staphylococcus hominis (10), 0.5 for both staphylococcus xylosus (15) and staphylococcus capitis (11) and 4 for staphylococcus saprophyticus (10), while staphylococcus haemolyticus (12) was less susceptible with a mic90 value of 32. cefdinir activity was not adversely affected by several variables such as ph, inoculum size or the presence of serum or urine. the new cephem induced a pae on all isolates studied: with s. aureus the extent of regrowth suppression ranged from 0.8 to 1 h, and with the other species from 0.5 (s. epidermidis) to 4.1 h (s. haemolyticus). development of resistant strains was rare. at the highest level used (10 x mic) mutants arose with a frequency of 6 x 10(-8) with s. haemolyticus and 2 x 10(-9) with s. epidermidis. the absence of a paradoxical effect of increasing concentrations of cefdinir on its bactericidal activity was confirmed  up to a value of 500-fold the mics. when cefdinir activity was assessed in association with ciprofloxacin, netilmicin, clarithromycin, fosfomycin, rifampicin, teicoplanin and vancomycin using the chequerboard and time-kill techniques, indifference predominated with all strains and in all combinations. synergism was detected only in 11 out of a total of 175 tests performed by the chequerboard method. using the time-kill technique cefdinir reacted synergically  in 25 of 126 tests. antagonism was never observed. s. aureus exposed to sub-inhibitory concentrations of cefdinir failed to grow on mannitol-salt agar and to produce haemolysins, but retained coagulase activity. penicillinase production was also lost in about 17% of the survivors. hydrophobicity changes were detected in all species tested with the exception of s. saprophyticus.

TI  == molecular epidemiology of staphylococcus spp. contamination in the ward environment: study on meca and fema genes in methicillin-resistant strains.
AB  == staphylococcus spp. were isolated from the ward environment and antibiotic susceptibility tests were performed. twenty-nine strains out of 274 isolates were s. aureus, and 41.4% of the s. aureus strains were methicillin resistant (mrsa).  all 12 strains of mrsa were also resistant to oxacillin, ceftizoxime, ampicillin  and clindamycin. among the coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns), methicillin-resistant (mr) strains of s. epidermidis, s. capitis, s. warneri, s.  haemolyticus, s. hominis, s. auricularis, s. saprophyticus and s. cohnii were isolated. eight of the 10 s. haemolyticus strains were methicillin resistant. the fema gene was detected in s. aureus (mssa and mrsa), but not in cns by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) analysis and southern blot analysis. the meca gene was found in all the mrsa and mr-s. epidermidis strains tested, and one of the two mr-s. hominis strains, but not in mssa, ms-s. epidermidis, ms-s. hominis, or ms-s. haemolyticus. dna from one strain of mr-s. hominis and 2 strains of mr-s. haemolyticus was not amplified by pcr using the meca gene primer, or hybridized by southern blotting. the ambiguity that meca was detected in some mr-cns strains, but not in others is discussed.

TI  == activation of the human immunodeficiency virus long terminal repeat in thp-1 cells by a staphylococcal extracellular product.
AB  == staphylococcal strains can release a factor that strongly activates the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) long terminal repeat (ltr) in thp-1 cells transfected with the hiv-1 ltr-driven luciferase reporter gene (thp-1 ltrluc). the factor is present in the overnight culture fluid and is readily released from the organisms into aqueous medium by vigorous mixing. staphylococcal extracellular material is a complex mixture of polysaccharide and protein containing peptidoglycan and teichoic acid, released in part by cell wall turnover. the importance of the carbohydrate component is emphasized by concanavalin a (con a) inhibition of staphylococcal product-induced ltr activation but not of activation by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate or tumor necrosis factor. the effect of con a was decreased or abolished by sugars in the  order methyl alpha-d-mannopyranoside > methyl alpha-d-glucopyranoside > mannose > glucose = fructose > n-acetylglucosamine. wheat germ agglutinin was less inhibitory than con a; in this instance n-acetylglucosamine decreased inhibition, whereas methyl alpha-d-mannopyranoside or methyl alpha-d-glucopyranoside did not. the induction of luciferase activity in thp-1 ltrluc by the staphylococcal extracellular product also was inhibited by fetal bovine and normal human serum.  a comparison of 31 staphylococcal isolates (9 staphylococcus aureus, 11 staphylococcus epidermidis, 2 staphylococcus haemolyticus, 4 staphylococcus hominis, 2 staphylococcus capitis, 2 staphylococcus warneri, 1 staphylococcus saprophyticus) revealed wide variation in ltr activating activity that did not correlate closely with slime production. our findings, using induction of luciferase in thp-1 ltrluc as a model for upregulation of hiv infection, raise the possibility that staphylococci, as well as certain other microorganisms, release carbohydrate-containing exopolymers, which can activate the hiv-1 ltr, thus influencing progression of hiv infection.

TI  == staphylococci express a receptor for human transferrin: identification of a 42-kilodalton cell wall transferrin-binding protein.
AB  == staphylococcus aureus and the coagulase-negative staphylococci are commonly responsible for peritonitis in renal patients undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. to simulate growth conditions in vivo, staphylococci isolated from peritoneal infections were cultured in used human peritoneal dialysate (hpd). immunoblotting experiments using cell wall preparations from these staphylococci revealed the presence of the host iron-binding glycoprotein transferrin bound to s. aureus, s. epidermidis, s. capitis, s. haemolyticus, and  s. hominis but not to s. warneri or s. saprophyticus. similar results were obtained by incubating broth-grown staphylococci with human transferrin, although, in contrast to s. aureus, the coagulase-negative staphylococci bound more transferrin after growth in iron-restricted broth. to determine whether the  staphylococci express a saturable specific receptor for human transferrin, the interaction of human 125i-transferrin with the staphylococci was examined. both s. aureus and s. epidermidis bound the radiolabelled iron-saturated ligand in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. from competition binding assays, the affinity (kd) and number of receptors were estimated for s. epidermidis (kd, 0.27 microm; 4,200 receptors per cell) and s. aureus (kd, 0.28 microm; 4,200 receptors per cell). s. epidermidis but not s. aureus receptor activity was partially iron  regulated. human apotransferrin and iron-saturated transferrin and rabbit and rat transferrins competed equally well for the staphylococcal receptor. bovine and porcine transferrins and ovotransferrin as well as human and bovine lactoferrins  were much less effective at competing with human transferrin. treatment of whole  staphylococci with protease abolished transferrin binding, indicating the involvement of cell surface protein. western blots (immunoblots) of cell wall preparations probed with human transferrin revealed the presence of a 42-kda transferrin-binding protein common to both s. aureus and s. epidermidis. on western strip blots, the binding of human transferrin to this protein was blocked by labelled human transferrin but not by albumin, immunoglobulin g, or bovine transferrin or ovotransferrin. to assess the conservation of the 42-kda transferrin-binding protein, cell wall proteins of s. epidermidis, s. haemolyticus, s. capitis, s. hominis, s. warneri, and s. saprophyticus were western blotted and probed with human transferrin. only s. warneri and s. saprophyticus lacked the 42-kda wall protein, consistent with their inability to  bind transferrin. these data show that the staphylococci express a specific receptor for human transferrin based at least in part on a common 42-kda cell wall protein.

AB  == recently, it has become more important to establish rapid and reliable methods for identifying bacterial species and their drug resistances because of the high  incidence of nosocomial infection caused by multi-drug resistant bacteria. at first, several enzymes were tested to evaluate the efficacy of dna extraction. n-acetylmuramidase, lysozyme and achromopeptidase were most effective to extract  dna from e. faecalis, e. faecium and s. aureus, respectively. after achromopeptidase extraction, the meca gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) in clinically isolated mrsa (95 strains), mssa (66), mrse (methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis, 37), msse (methicillin-sensitive s. epidermidis, 1), s haemolyticus(5), s.hominis(1) and others (enterococcus, pseudomonas, and streptococcus, total 45). pcr products were analyzed by agarose  gel electrophoresis. the positive rates were 95% (mrsa), 1.5% (mssa), and 97% (mrse). the meca gene was also positive in 2/2 of methicillin-resistant s.haemolyticus and 2/3 of methicillin-sensitive s.haemolyticus and 1/1 of methicillin-resistant s.hominis. the meca gene was not detected in 45 non-staphylococcal strains. meca and fema gene by pcr and pbp 2' by irma were further detected in newly isolated mrsa (20 strains), mssa(20), mrse(14), msse(1) and s.simulans(2). complete correlation between mpipc susceptibility and meca were found. the fema gene was positive in 39/40 of s. aureus, and 0/14 of s.epidermidis, 2/3 of s.simulans. pbp2' were positive in 20/20 of mrsa, 0/20 of mssa, 14/14 of mrse, 0/1 of msse, 1/1 of methicillin-resistant s.simulans, and 0/2 of methicillin-sensitive s.simulans. in conclusion, diagnoses of mrsa by simultaneous detection of meca and fema gene as well as pbp2' are similarly useful because of their specificity and rapidity.

AB  == selection of the appropriate nacl concentration for test medium for oxacillin susceptibility testing of staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci has been problematic when using different antimicrobial susceptibility testing methods. broth microdilution, using cation-adjusted mueller-hinton broth + 2% nacl, is the currently recommended reference method. there is currently no recommendation for the addition of nacl to agar for dilution susceptibility tests when staphylococcus species are tested with oxacillin. we examined the effects of adding 0, 2%, 4%, and 5% nacl to mueller-hinton agar and broth for agar dilution, etest, and broth microdilution tests. the results of these tests were compared with the reference broth microdilution results and with the results of a hybridization assay using a mec gene probe. we tested 223 strains of staphylococci, 128 of which were mec gene positive and had oxacillin minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) > or = 4 micrograms/ml. seven strains of s. aureus were mec probe negative but were oxacillin resistant. seven coagulase-negative strains (three s. epidermidis, one  s. haemolyticus, and three s. simulans) were mec probe positive and were oxacillin susceptible. the mics for oxacillin-resistant strains increased two- to fourfold with the addition of 2% nacl, but the mics for oxacillin-susceptible strains were unchanged. major and very major interpretative rates ranged from 18.2% to 20.2% for agar dilution and etest without nacl added to the medium, and  these rates decreased to < 1% with the addition of 2% nacl to the medium. the addition of 4% or 5% nacl caused major error rates of > 17% for all test methods.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == comparative prophylactic efficacies of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, cefazolin, and vancomycin in experimental model of staphylococcal wound infection.
AB  == recent shifts in the species and antibiotic resistance patterns of bacteria causing nosocomial infections present new challenges for providing effective prophylaxis in surgery. traditional regimens lack activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococci and many gram-negative species causing nosocomial infections. the new fluoroquinolones exhibit in vitro activity against many emerging surgical wound pathogens. to determine the potential of this class  of antimicrobial agents for use in surgery, we compared the prophylactic efficacies of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin with those of cefazolin and vancomycin  in a guinea pig model of abscess formation. four staphylococcus aureus strains, one staphylococcus epidermidis strain, and one staphylococcus haemolyticus strain were evaluated. vancomycin was the most effective prophylactic agent, exhibiting  in vivo activity against all strains which was superior or equivalent to those of all other agents tested. cefazolin was the least effective agent and surpassed the two quinolones in prophylactic efficacy against only one organism, a quinolone- and methicillin-resistant strain of s. aureus. the two quinolones provided excellent protection against infection with all but the quinolone-resistant isolate. the in vivo emergence of quinolone resistance among  quinolone-susceptible isolates was not detected. the methicillin-resistant, quinolone-susceptible s. epidermidis and s. haemolyticus isolates were extremely  susceptible to prophylaxis, exhibiting 50% infective doses above 4 x 10(6) cfu for seven of the eight antibiotic-strain combinations. we conclude that ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin may be effective antistaphylococcal agents in surgery. the role of these agents remains to be defined, and the definition should include consideration of an adverse effect upon antibiotic resistance patterns of organisms causing nosocomial infections.

AB  == a total of 85 strains of gram positive cocci isolated from beach water and sand located in valparaiso bay, and vina del mar, chile, were examined for 59 morphological, physiological and biochemical characteristics. the taxonomic data  were analysed by numerical taxonomy using ssm coefficient and the unweighted pair group method of association (upgma). at 80% similarity level, four phenons were obtained. of the 85 strains 31% were classified as staphylococcus epidermidis, 9% were classified as staphylococcus haemolyticus, 36% were classified as staphylococcus spp. and 24% as staphylococcus aureus. epidemiological considerations are made in relation with the probable impact that the isolation of staphylococcus aureus and coagulase negative staphylococci would have on the health of the population.

TI  == crystal violet reactions of coagulase negative staphylococci.
AB  == twenty four reference strains and 112 clinical isolates of coagulase negative staphylococci (cns) were examined for their reactions in the crystal violet test. some species gave a white reaction and others a purple reaction. results were consistent and reproducible and each species gave only one pattern of crystal violet reaction. within the limited variety of species represented in the clinical isolates, staphylococcus saprophyticus and s haemolyticus gave crystal violet purple reactions, in contrast to s epidermidis, which always gave a white  reaction. investigations suggested that the mechanism of the crystal violet test  in s haemolyticus may be similar to that previously described in s aureus. further work is needed to characterise the ability of crystal violet to modify s  epidermidis and other central nervous system species. the crystal violet reaction, which has strong associations with invasiveness, phage group susceptibilities, colonisation persistence abilities, and nosocomial origin in s  aureus may also be useful in studies of cns disease.

TI  == dissemination among staphylococci of dna sequences associated with methicillin resistance.
AB  == dna probes consisting of puc19 containing cloned staphylococcus aureus chromosomal fragments were constructed from two methicillin-resistant s. aureus strains with different dna sequences 5' to meca, the gene that mediates methicillin resistance. the probe from one strain, bms1, contained a portion of the regulatory sequences (the terminal 641 bp of mecr1 and all of meci) associated with the induction and repression of meca transcription (pgo195). the  second probe, from strain col (pgo198), contained dna not found in strain bms1. this dna was within the sequences added at the site of a mecr1 deletion. genomic  digests of 14 s. aureus isolates recovered between 1961 and 1969 all hybridized with pgo198. in contrast, 78% (36 of 46) of the s. aureus organisms isolated since 1988 hybridized with pgo195 but not with pgo198; the remainder hybridized with pgo198. no s. aureus isolates hybridized with both probes. staphylococcus epidermidis digests hybridized with pgo198 (46%), pgo195 (14%), or both probes (35%); all 20 staphylococcus haemolyticus isolates hybridized with pgo198. the restriction fragment length polymorphism patterns of all pgo198-hybridizing regions in s. aureus were identical to those in strain col. in addition, the mecr1 deletion junction nucleotide sequences of eight s. aureus and six s. epidermidis isolates were identical. however, 21 of 23 s. epidermidis and all 20  s. haemolyticus isolates had from 5 to more than 20 additional chromosomal bands  that hybridized with pgo198; none of 21 s. aureus isolates had additional hybridizing bands. these data suggest that the additional dna responsible for the mecr1 deletion was part of a repetitive, and possibly mobile, element resident in coagulase-negative staphylococci but not in s. aureus. these data also support a  hypothesis that the deletion event occurred in a coagulase-negative staphylococcus with subsequent acquisition of the interrupted sequences by s. aureus.

TI  == prevalence of antibiotic resistance among clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant staphylococci.
AB  == the prevalence of methicillin-resistant and multiply antibiotic-resistant staphylococci causing infections in hospitalized patients was studied over a two-year period. among 122 clinically significant staphylococci, the prevalence of methicillin resistance was 66%, with a higher prevalence of staphylococcus haemolyticus (85%) and staphylococcus epidermidis (83%) observed than of staphylococcus aureus (49%). multiple antibiotic resistance was observed more frequently among coagulase-negative staphylococcus (52 to 70%) than among staphylococcus aureus (17%). all strains of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus  aureus were susceptible to glycopeptide antibiotics and to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, whereas approximately 50% of coagulase-negative staphylococci exhibited either moderate susceptibility or resistance to teicoplanin. for these latter strains, vancomycin remains the agent of choice, whereas teicoplanin cannot be recommended unless its efficacy is established by mic determination.

TI  == residual bacterial contamination on reusable pulse oximetry sensors.
AB  == background: an early study demonstrated that standard cleaning techniques did not adequately disinfect reusable pulse oximetry sensors that had been intentionally  contaminated with high titers of pathogenic microorganisms. this current study evaluated patient-ready sensors being used in hospitals, by testing them for bacterial contamination. methods: reusable pulse oximetry sensors from 15 hospitals throughout the united states were tested. each sensor was deemed by the hospital to be ready for patient use, and it had been prepared for use according  to hospital procedures. patient-contact areas of each sensor were swabbed, and the swabs were analyzed for bacterial contamination using standard testing procedures. this study had two stages, and different sensors were tested in each  stage. in the "bacterial-growth stage," swabs were evaluated for bacterial contamination but organisms were not identified; in the "identification stage," bacterial species were identified. results: forty-four sensors were evaluated, 16 in the bacterial-growth stage and 28 in the identification stage. bacteria were cultured from 29 of the 44 sensors (66%), including 20 that had been cleaned with alcohol or an antibacterial/antiviral agent. among the isolated organisms were staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus haemolyticus, enterococcus faecalis, and klebsiella oxytoca. bacterial contamination was found on sensors from 12 of the 15 participating hospitals. conclusions: these data demonstrate the need to define effective cleaning methods for reusable sensors, and we are currently conducting such studies. the data also suggest that disposable patient-dedicated  sensors may be the most appropriate choice when infection control is of particular concern.

AB  == the distributions of the mec regulator genes meci and mecr1, which were identified on the chromosome of meca-carrying staphylococcus aureus n315, in methicillin-resistant staphylococci isolated in japan and various countries were  studied. screening by dot blot hybridization by using polymerase chain reaction (pcr)-amplified probes revealed that at least the 5'-end region of the mecr1 gene was present in all strains tested, whereas about 40% of the strains were negative for the meci gene. the data suggested that these regulator genes were the original components of the additional mec region dna of methicillin-resistant s.  aureus as well as methicillin-resistant, coagulase-negative staphylococci of seven staphylococcal species (s. epidermidis, s. haemolyticus, s. hominis, s. sciuri, s. capitis, s. caprae, and s. warneri). the meci gene, which presumably codes for the repressor protein of the meca gene, was found to harbor a point mutation in all six meci-positive methicillin-resistant s. aureus strains, and their basal level of meca gene transcription was elevated compared with that of strain n315, which harbors a presumably intact counterpart of the meci gene. the  data suggested that the meci gene encodes for a strong repressor function on meca gene transcription and is deleted or mutated in clinical methicillin-resistant s. aureus strains with high levels of resistance to methicillin.

TI  == occurrence of macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin resistances among staphylococcal clinical isolates at a university medical center. is false susceptibility to new macrolides and clindamycin a contemporary clinical and in vitro testing problem?
AB  == a total of 2189 staphylococcal strains at the university of iowa hospitals and clinics (iowa city, ia) were initially screened to determine the incidence of constitutive (29.8%) and potential inducible macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin  (mls) resistance (11.3%). staphylococcus haemolyticus and s. epidermidis (62.5% and 55.3%) showed the highest incidence of constitutive resistance. staphylococcus hominis had the highest incidence of inducible resistance (40.6%), while s. aureus had the lowest rate for both resistance types. the overall ratio  of constitutive-inducible mls resistance was 4:1. among strains initially speciated using the vitek system gpi card, there was only a 69% species identification reproducibility, and 78% accuracy versus a reference identification method. a random sample of 105 staphylococcus spp. isolates with discordant macrolide (erythromycin resistant) and lincosamide (clindamycin susceptible) susceptibility patterns were tested against 16 antimicrobial agents  by using a reference broth microdilution method. all erythromycin-resistant staphylococcus spp. were also resistant to other 14-member macrolides and azithromycin, while all organisms remained susceptible to clindamycin, rifampin,  vancomycin, and the streptogramin compounds (rp59500 and virginiamycin). resistance to teicoplanin was identified among some oxacillin-resistant s. haemolyticus strains. of 105 isolates, 65 (62%) showed inducible mls resistance,  28 (27%) were noninducible, and 12 (11%) were either fully susceptible or resistant to the mls drugs (vitek system interpretation errors). mls disk induction tests revealed two inducible resistance phenotypes: ml and mls. staphylococcus aureus showed the highest inducible resistance rate at 95% with an mls-predominant pattern. in contrast, endemic s. haemolyticus isolates did not demonstrate inducible resistance that is, efflux-mediated erythromycin resistance.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == gram-positive pathogens (n = 525) isolated from bloodstream infections were tested by a reference broth microdilution method to establish antibiotic susceptibility trends (1985 to 1991). cefazolin, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, novobiocin, oxacillin, rifampin, teicoplanin, vancomycin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, daptomycin and two investigational glycopeptides (ly264826 and mdl62873) were investigated. strains were selected without bias (first two isolates each month/species; no patient duplicates) as follows: 132 staphylococcus aureus, 129 staphylococcus epidermidis, 72 staphylococcus haemolyticus, 130 enterococcus faecalis and 62 other enterococci. all isolates were susceptible to vancomycin and teicoplanin except for staphylococcus haemolyticus which had a resistant teicoplanin mic90 of 64 micrograms/ml. the susceptibilities to vancomycin and teicoplanin were unchanged over the monitored  period. daptomycin, ly264826 and mdl62873 also demonstrated consistent activity;  mdl62873 being superior with a mic90 of 0.12 micrograms/ml. in 1990-1991 a significantly increased resistance to ciprofloxacin was observed among oxacillin-resistant strains of staphylococci. our data suggest that the emergence of invasive vancomycin-resistant strains in gram-positive isolates remains a rare phenomenon. however, we have experienced an emergence of numerous ciprofloxacin-resistant strains among staphylococci that precludes its empirical  use at our institution.

TI  == infection problems for the 1990's--do we have an answer?
AB  == there is and has been continued change in organisms causing infection in the hospital. in the past few years, although gram-negative bacteria have remained a  major cause of mortality, gram-positive bacteria and fungi have become increasingly important. this has caused organisms such as methicillin-resistant staphylococci, enterococci, xanthomonas maltophilia and multiply resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa to be common pathogens. can this difficult state of affairs be changed by better antimicrobial prescribing practices? yes and no. virtually any agent will select mrsa and mrse since the chromosomal location of the resistance of multiple-antibiotics makes such selection common and explains the rapid rate of the fluoroquinolones as therapy of mrsa. restriction of oral vancomycin will markedly reduce the pressure to select enterococcus faecium and thus limit the spread of the organisms and delay transmission of glycopeptide resistance to s. aureus. judicious use of antibiotics in the intensive care environment will be major factor in "saving" antibiotics for other patients since the icu patient goes to other parts of the hospital carrying with him/her the baggage of resistant staphylococcus haemolyticus, klebsiella, p. aeruginosa, acinetobacter, enterobacter, xanthomonas and pseudomonas cepacia. all of these organisms have the potential to become resistant to the agents heretofore used to treat them and are common in icu patients.

AB  == in adults, intense staphylococcal skin colonization and hyperactivity of polymorphonuclear leukocyte (pmn) oxidative metabolism are characteristic features of atopic dermatitis. precise data on childhood atopic dermatitis are lacking. in a prospective study we analysed the pmn chemiluminescence activity with special reference to staphylococcal stimuli in 19 children (mean age 6.2 years) with mild to moderate atopic dermatitis. staphylococcus aureus was isolated from 17/19 (90%) of children with atopic dermatitis and 13/45 (29%) of healthy age-matched controls (p less than 0.001). the mean (sem) chemiluminescence activity of unstimulated atopic dermatitis-pmn was 0.34 (0.009) (controls: 0.092 (0.003) x 10(6) cpm/10(6) pmn/min (p less than 0.02). staphylococcal antigens (s. aureus, s. epidermidis, s. haemolyticus) induced a 1.9-3.1-fold higher peak chemiluminescence response in children with atopic dermatitis than in controls (p less than 0.05). the time interval until peak chemiluminescence activity was considerably shorter for all stimuli in atopic dermatitis. we conclude that pmn of children with atopic dermatitis are "primed", showing enhanced release of reactive oxygen metabolites even in the "resting" state, and are easily stimulated by staphylococcal antigens present on the skin of patients with atopic dermatitis from early childhood on. we speculate that pmn hyperreactivity may contribute to chronic skin damage in atopic dermatitis.

TI  == phage typing of coagulase-negative staphylococci.
AB  == seventy-nine staphylococcal strains isolated from blood cultures (57 coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns) and 22 s. aureus) and 308 cns isolated from the skin of healthy donors were phage typed. s. epidermidis and s. capitis were readily typed with 91 strains out of 124 and 24 strains out of 43 strains being successful. species such as s. haemolyticus, s. hominis and s. simulans could be moderately phage typed. others gave only a few strains capable of being  typed, such as s. saprophyticus and s. sciuri. under our experimental conditions  the s. warneri, s. xylosus and s. cohnii could not be typed with our set of phages.

TI  == in vitro activity of ro 23-9424, a dual-action antibacterial agent, against bacterial isolates from cancer patients compared with those of other agents.
AB  == the in vitro activity of ro 23-9424 against bacterial isolates from patients with cancer was compared with those of fleroxacin, ciprofloxacin, cefoperazone, and ceftazidime. ro 23-9424 inhibited the majority of the members of the family enterobacteriaceae and all aeromonas isolates at a concentration of less than or  equal to 1.0 micrograms/ml. it was also active against acinetobacter spp. and haemophilus influenzae, including beta-lactamase-producing strains. the mic for 90% of isolates (mic90) of pseudomonas aeruginosa was 16.0 micrograms/ml. all group a and b streptococci were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.25 micrograms/ml, and 90% of group g streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae were  inhibited by 1.0 micrograms/ml. all methicillin-susceptible strains of staphylococcus aureus and 60% of methicillin-resistant strains were susceptible to 2.0 micrograms of ro 23-9424 per ml, whereas the mic90 for staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus hominis isolates was 4.0 micrograms/ml. staphylococcus haemolyticus and enterococcus spp. were less susceptible; mic90s for them were 16.0 and 32.0 micrograms/ml. ro 23-9424 has a broad antibacterial spectrum and potential utility for therapy of infections in cancer patients.

TI  == in vitro activity of decaplanin (m86-1410), a new glycopeptide antibiotic.
AB  == the in vitro activity of decaplanin (formerly m86-1410), a novel glycopeptide antimicrobial agent, was tested against 169 gram-positive bloodstream isolates from patients at the university of iowa hospitals and clinics and 12 selected vancomycin-resistant strains. enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium, staphylococcus aureus, streptococci, bacilli, corynebacteria, and listeria were inhibited by decaplanin (mics for 90% of the strains tested [mic90s], 0.12 to 4 micrograms/ml). however, some rarely isolated and selected enterococcus sp. populations had a mic90 of 16 micrograms/ml, and s. haemolyticus strains had a mic90 of 8 micrograms/ml. these in vitro results suggest that decaplanin may be useful against most gram-positive strains, even though some enterococcus species  and coagulase-negative staphylococci were potentially resistant (mics, greater than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml).

TI  == dynamics of coagulase-negative staphylococcal colonization in patients and employees in a surgical intensive care unit.
AB  == because there is little information about the frequency of carriage of various species of coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns) in hospital staff, we prospectively investigated nasal cns in patients and personnel in a surgical intensive care unit (sicu). the majority of cns from personnel were staphylococcus epidermiditis. the cns species from patients on admission were more diverse and included multiply antibiotic-resistant s. haemolyticus. patients' cns became more like cns colonizing personnel after admission with respect to both antimicrobial susceptibility and speciation. plasmid and antibiotic sensitivity profiles of s. epidermidis resistant to multiple antibiotics from five patients were identified as those from one employee, but there was no evidence that this was of clinical significance. a variety of factors influence nasal colonization by cns in sicus. the nasal cns of patients change after admission and may become more resistant and less diverse. the factors influencing changes in the antibiotic susceptibility and the aetiology of cns infection require further study.

AB  == by using broth microdilution, 373 clinical isolates of staphylococci were studied to determine their susceptibilities to ci-960, win 57273, ciprofloxacin, mupirocin, vancomycin, teicoplanin, and ramoplanin. test strains comprised 179 strains of staphylococcus aureus and 194 strains of coagulase-negative species. strains of s. aureus were susceptible to ci-960, which had a mode mic of 0.032 micrograms/ml and an mic for 90% of the strains of 2 micrograms/ml. ci-960 was equally active against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant s. aureus strains as well as ciprofloxacin-resistant strains. similarly, win 57273 was highly active, with a mode mic of 0.008 micrograms/ml and an mic for 90% of the strains  of 1 micrograms/ml. no cross-resistance to ci-960 and win 57273 among ciprofloxacin-resistant strains was detected. mupirocin was four- to eightfold more active than ramoplanin, vancomycin, and teicoplanin. with regard to coagulase-negative staphylococci, ci-960 and win 57273 were the most active of the test compounds, inhibiting all strains at 0.5 and 1 micrograms/ml, respectively. against the same strains, mupirocin was fourfold more active than ramoplanin and eightfold more active than vancomycin. five strains of s. haemolyticus were found to be resistant to ciprofloxacin, while resistance to teicoplanin was found among strains of s. epidermidis, s. haemolyticus, s. hominis, s. saprophyticus, s. simulans, s. warneri, and s. xylosus.

TI  == survey of methicillin-resistant clinical strains of coagulase-negative staphylococci for meca gene distribution.
AB  == a total number of 125 methicillin-resistant (mic, greater than or equal to 16) coagulase-negative staphylococcus strains isolated in japan were surveyed for the distribution of the meca gene, the structural gene for penicillin-binding protein 2', which is the causative genetic element for the intrinsic resistance of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus. screening with colony hybridization  by using a cloned meca gene probe revealed that 121 strains (96.8%) belonging to  the nine coagulase-negative staphylococcus species (s. epidermidis, s. haemolyticus, s. saprophyticus, s. sciuri, s. simulans, s. hominis, s. capitis, s. warneri, and s. caprae) carried meca in their genome, indicating wide distribution of the gene among coagulase-negative staphylococcus species. most (93.4%) of the meca-carrying strains were producers of penicillinase. four strains, including two s. haemolyticus and two s. saprophyticus strains, did not  carry meca in spite of their resistance to methicillin. one of them was of low-level resistance (mic, 16), but three of them had moderate- to high-level resistance to methicillin (mic, 64). analysis of gel electrophoretic banding patterns of penicillin-binding proteins of these strains showed absence of penicillin-binding protein 2' but some alterations in signal intensities of the other penicillin-binding proteins. the result indicated that about 3% of methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci in these hospitals had a resistance mechanism different from that associated with the production of penicillin-binding protein 2', as has been reported in the case of a borderline methicillin-resistant strain of s. aureus.

TI  == on the relationship between theoretical presumptions asbestos genotoxicity and the practical monitoring of exposed workers.
AB  == from the genotoxic viewpoint, there exists a sufficient evidence for asbestos carcinogenicity to human population and animals. asbestos is a solid cancer promoter (cocarcinogen) of non-mutagenic character having epigenetic effects (15, 16). no data have been published on its mutagenic activity in "in vivo" conditions in man. the only results are those of our pilot study carried out in the period of 1981-1983, which cast doubts on the official view of non-mutagenic  character of asbestos--at least under occupational conditions of its processing (34, 36, 37). the study presented here represents ten years' efforts made in the  biological (cytogenetic) monitoring of persons occupationally exposed to asbestos in a factory for its processing (occupational risk). simultaneously, a preliminary answer is given to the question whether the osinek factory (situated  in a housing area) is or is not dangerous for inhabitants of the town of kostelec nad orlici, namely for their genetic apparatus (environmental risk). using the method of chromosome aberrations analysis in peripheral blood lymphocytes, a total of 431 subjects (245 males and 186 females) were examined in the period of  1981 to 1988. of these, 111 persons were from control workplaces (from osinek or--starting from 1984--from other plants in kostelec nad orlici; in addition to  that 14 pensioners without any occupational exposure were examined). the average  age of workers exposed to asbestos risk was 42.7 years, in the controls it was 43.9 years, in pensioners exposed to asbestos earlier 63.5 years and in those never exposed to asbestos 66.5 years. the average number of years spent at osinek factory amounted to 21.5 years. about one third of employees were found to suffer from allergies (first of all those of air passages) and one sixth from chronic ailments of the upper air passages (staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus influenzae and streptococcus beta-haemolyticus were diagnosed most frequently). a third part of workers from high-risk workshops are smokers, only a fourth of the controls. about 40% of workers regularly consume alcoholic drinks. the average morbidity rate at osinek in 1981 to 1988 was 6.3% (in workers as high as 9%), which is about 2% higher as compared with mean values obtained in the district of rychnov  nad kneznou and east-bohemian region. within the nine-year period (1981-1989), 21 occupational diseases were diagnosed, while in the previous 24 years there were 24 cases of an occupational disease. earlier they were mainly asbestoses (87%), in the last period mainly cancer diseases coinciding with asbestosis (81%).(abstract truncated at 400 words)

AB  == the distribution of the fosb gene, coding for fosfomycin resistance, in 105 fosfomycin-resistant isolates of staphylococcus from various geographical areas,  was studied by southern blot hybridization. nucleotide sequences related to fosb  were detected in 36 strains belonging to five species. plasmids bearing fosb were often of a size similar to that of pip1842 (2.54 kb) in s. epidermidis, most often small (2.4 to 4.1 kb) in other species including s. aureus where a 2.7-kb plasmid was found in 16 out of the 18 strains studied. the fosb gene was geographically dispersed since it was present in six different locations in france and also in japan. the weak hybridization observed with plasmid dna of certain strains of s. aureus, s. epidermidis, s. haemolyticus, s. saprophyticus,  and s. warneri may indicate gene heterogeneity for fosfomycin resistance in staphylococcus spp.

TI  == identification of methicillin-resistant strains of staphylococci by polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == a simple and reliable method using a polymerase chain reaction (pcr) was devised  to identify methicillin-resistant staphylococci. by using lysates of the strain to be tested as templates and 22-mer oligonucleotides as primers, a 533-bp region of meca, the structural gene of a low-affinity penicillin-binding protein (pbp 2'), was amplified by pcr and detected by agarose gel electrophoresis. results obtained by this method were compared with those obtained by broth microdilution  mic determination for 210 and 100 clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus and  coagulase-negative staphylococci, respectively. of 99 meca-negative s. aureus isolates, 100% of the strains were methicillin susceptible and 98% of the strains were oxacillin susceptible. three strains (3%) of 111 meca-positive s. aureus isolates exhibited almost the same susceptibility to beta-lactams as the meca-negative ones and did not produce detectable amounts of pbp 2' despite the presence of the meca gene. one of them yielded typically methicillin-resistant variants at a low frequency with concomitant recovery of pbp 2' production. the meca gene was also found in coagulase-negative staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus haemolyticus, staphylococcus sciuri, staphylococcus saprophyticus, and staphylococcus caprae and conferred resistance on most of the bacteria.

AB  == clinical strains belonging to ten staphylococcus species were investigated for their abilities to develop single-step resistance in vitro to vancomycin and teicoplanin. surviving clones were only recovered from strains of three species,  namely s. aureus, s. epidermidis, and s. haemolyticus. a similar ratio of grown to plated cells (approximately 1 x 10(-8)) was mostly obtained from strains of s. aureus and s. epidermidis. higher ratios (1 x 10(-6) to 1 x 10(-7)) were obtained from strains of s. haemolyticus, especially when exposed to teicoplanin. when tested for susceptibility, many survivors exhibited vancomycin and teicoplanin minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) below the drug concentration used for in vitro selection, probably due to an inoculum effect in the plating procedure. however, mics were particularly high in many clones of s. haemolyticus (up to 12.8 microg/ml for vancomycin, and > or = 102.4 microg/ml for teicoplanin).

TI  == evaluation of the staph-zym system with staphylococci isolated from bovine intramammary infections.
AB  == a total of 148 staphylococci isolated from bovine intramammary infections were used to evaluate the staph-zym system (rosco, taastrup, denmark). the overall accuracy of the system was 91.9%. the system correctly identified all strains of  staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus simulans, and staphylococcus xylosus and 95% of staphylococcus intermedius strains. of 33 staphylococcus hyicus strains, 31 (93.9%) were classified correctly by the staph-zym system, as well as 8 (80%)  of 10 staphylococcus chromogenes strains. all 11 staphylococcus epidermidis strains and the 1 staphylococcus haemolyticus strain included in the study were identified, but the staph-zym system had difficulty distinguishing strains of staphylococcus warneri and staphylococcus hominis from other species in the s. epidermidis group. the staph-zym system correctly identified all six s. xylosus strains and two of three staphyloccus sciuri strains. the staph-zym system was considered an acceptable alternative to conventional methods for identification of bovine mammary gland isolates.

TI  == development of in-vitro resistance to glycopeptide antibiotics: assessment in staphylococci of different species.
AB  == forty-two clinical isolates belonging to ten species of staphylococci were studied for their ability to develop single-step resistance, in vitro, to glycopeptide antibiotics. selection was attempted through separate exposure to four glycopeptides (vancomycin, teicoplanin, and two investigational semisynthetic derivatives of the latter, td-a3 and cta-a1) on agar containing 10  mg/l of the test drug. no survivors from any test strain were recovered after exposure to td-a3 or cta-a1. after exposure to vancomycin or teicoplanin, surviving clones were only recovered from strains of three species, staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, and s. haemolyticus. emergence of resistant clones was easier to observe from strains of s. haemolyticus exposed to teicoplanin. when tested for susceptibility, many survivors exhibited vancomycin  and teicoplanin mics below the drug concentration used for in-vitro selection, probably due to an inoculum effect in the plating procedure. in particular, the vancomycin mics did not exceed 8 mg/l for s. aureus and s. epidermidis clones, and reached 16 mg/l for some clones from a s. haemolyticus strain. teicoplanin mics did not exceed 8 mg/l for s. aureus clones, but reached 64 mg/l for some clones of s. epidermidis, and were particularly high (64 to greater than or equal to 128 mg/l) for most clones of s. haemolyticus. in contrast, against all clones  selected from all three species, the mics of td-a3 and cta-a1 did not exceed 2 and 4 mg/l, respectively. morphological investigations indicated that the colonies of a highly resistant s. haemolyticus clone were smaller and more butyraceous in consistency than those of the parent strain. in transmission and scanning electron microscopy studies, this same s. haemolyticus clone showed a more irregular cell wall than the parent strain.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of teicoplanin and vancomycin against united states teicoplanin clinical trial isolates of gram-positive cocci.
AB  == in this study, the in vitro activity of teicoplanin and vancomycin was directly compared against 503 gram-positive cocci isolated during the u.s. teicoplanin clinical trials. both antibiotics were equally active against oxacillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, oxacillin-sensitive and oxacillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis, and other coagulase-negative staphylococci, except staphylococcus haemolyticus. teicoplanin was fourfold more active than vancomycin against oxacillin-resistant s. aureus (mic90, 0.5 vs. 2.0 micrograms/ml), whereas vancomycin was more active than teicoplanin (mic90, 2.0 vs. 8.0 micrograms/ml) against oxacillin-resistant s. haemolyticus. teicoplanin was two- to eightfold more active than vancomycin against the streptococci and enterococci tested.

AB  == the capability of miocamycin to induce a postantibiotic effect (pae) on a group a streptococcus beta-haemolyticus clinical isolate and on staphylococcus aureus atcc 29213 has been studied. erythromycin was chosen as a reference molecule. the exposure time to antibiotics was 90 min. the removal technique of the antibiotic  agents consisted of a 1:200 dilution in cultural broth. miocamycin displayed a pae of 2 h 30 min in relation to the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of streptococcus and a pae of 2 h 30 min in relation to the mic of staphylococcus. the pae value lasting longer than the others was of 5 h 40 min towards streptococcus and of 4 h 18 min towards staphylococcus at a concentration eightfold the mic. erythromycin showed a pae of 1 h 36 min in relation to the mic of streptococcus and a pae of 1 h 30 min in relation to the mic of staphylococcus. the pae value lasting longer than the others was of 3 h 15 min against streptococcus and of 2 h 30 min against staphylococcus at a concentration eightfold the mic. in some cases a pae was observed in relation to subinhibitory  concentrations (1/2 mic). miocamycin therefore proved to possess a more evident capability to induce a pae against the clinical isolate of group a streptococcus  beta-haemolyticus and on staphylococcus aureus atcc 29213 than did erythromycin.

AB  == the in vitro activity of ly264826, a novel glycopeptide antibiotic produced by amycolatopsis orientalis, was compared with those of vancomycin, teicoplanin, and oxacillin against 311 gram-positive clinical isolates from patients with cancer,  ly264826 had lower mics for 90% of isolates (mic90) than vancomycin for all species tested. it was active against oxacillin-resistant isolates including staphylococcus aureus (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml), staphylococcus haemolyticus (mic90, 2.0 micrograms/ml), enterococcus spp. (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml), bacillus cereus (mic90, 0.25 micrograms/ml), and corynebacterium jeikeium (mic90, 0.12 micrograms/ml). for s. aureus, including oxacillin-resistant isolates, the mics of ly264826 were similar to those of teicoplanin. for coagulase-negative staphylococci, however, ly264826 had mics that were 4- to 32-fold lower than those of teicoplanin. against most streptococcal species the activities of ly264826 and teicoplanin were similar. bactericidal activity against staphylococcus spp. and most streptococcus pyogenes isolates was less than or equal to 1 dilution of the mic. one isolate of s. pyogenes and all enterococcus faecalis strains tested were tolerant of ly264826, with mbcs greater than or equal to 32-fold greater than the mics. the addition of 50% human serum resulted  in a significant increase in activity only against staphylococcus epidermidis. variations in ph from 6.4 to 8.4 and in inoculum from 10(3) to 10(7) cfu/ml did not significantly affect the activity of ly264826.

TI  == presence of an additional penicillin-binding protein in methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus haemolyticus, staphylococcus hominis,  and staphylococcus simulans with a low affinity for methicillin, cephalothin, and cefamandole.
AB  == the presence of an additional penicillin-binding protein (pbp) was demonstrated in methicillin-resistant strains of staphylococcus epidermidis, s. haemolyticus,  s. hominis, and s. simulans. in these four species, the apparent molecular mass of this protein was analogous to that of pbp 2' of methicillin-resistant s. aureus sr 1550-9. it exhibited a low affinity for methicillin, cephalothin, and cefamandole; and its synthesis was methicillin inducible. peptide mapping of this pbp from the four species yielded identical results that were analogous to those  obtained with s. aureus sr 1550-9. these results suggest that this protein is similar to, if not the same as, pbp 2' of s. aureus and that it is involved in methicillin resistance in the four species studied.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of cefpirome and cefepime, two new cephalosporins.
AB  == in in vitro tests the broad-spectrum cephalosporins cefpirome and cefepime were highly active against enterobacteriaceae, although often less so against strains  resistant to amoxicillin-clavulanate and ticarcillin-clavulanate, and against most strains of acinetobacter spp. and aeromonas hydrophila. they were also active against pseudomonas aeruginosa, although strains with non-plasmid mediated beta-lactam resistance were sometimes less sensitive. other pseudomonas spp. varied in their sensitivity. both agents were highly active against haemophilus influenzae, but beta-lactamase-producing branhamella catarrhalis were somewhat less sensitive. neisseria gonorrhoeae were susceptible, although non-beta-lactamase producing penicillin-resistant strains had higher mics. gardnerella vaginalis was also susceptible and campylobacter coli/jejuni usually  susceptible. both antibiotics had good activity against staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci except for methicillin-resistant strains and staphylococcus haemolyticus which were of borderline sensitivity. all streptococci were sensitive, with the exception of highly penicillin-resistant pneumococci and enterococci against which cefpirome had greater activity than cefepime. both antibiotics had little useful activity against the bacteroides fragilis group or bacteroides oralis group but were active against most other anaerobes. clostridium difficile and some other clostridium species were resistant.

TI  == vitronectin and type-i collagen binding by staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci.
AB  == binding of 125i-labelled type-i collagen and 125i-labelled vitronectin (human serum spreading factor or s-protein) was studied using staphylococcus aureus and  coagulase-negative staphylococci of different species. binding of collagen and vitronectin was time dependent for s. aureus isp 546, and s. haemolyticus e 2498/86. co-operative binding of vitronectin and collagen by staphylococcal cells was demonstrated. binding to s. haemolyticus e 2498/86 was more rapid and was enhanced in vitronectin/collagen mixtures than for either protein separately. furthermore, pre-incubation of staphylococcal cells with unlabelled collagen enhanced vitronectin binding. when cells of s. haemolyticus e 2498/86 were treated with pronase e, proteinase k, subtilopeptidase a or trypsin, vitronectin-binding was decreased by 50% or more, whereas collagen-binding was protease resistant. for the strains of s. aureus tested, both vitronectin and collagen binding were found to be protease sensitive. type-i collagen peptides inhibited collagen-binding to s. haemolyticus e 2498/86, whereas vitronectin-binding was not affected perhaps indicating different receptors for these proteins. the binding of both collagen and vitronectin was shown to be reversible, since bound 125i-collagen and 125i-vitronectin were displaced after adding excess of the homologous protein.

TI  == comparative post-antibiotic effect of five antibiotics against ten aerobic gram-positive cocci.
AB  == the post-antibiotic effect (pae) is the persistent suppression of bacterial growth after a short antibiotic exposure. it is well documented with a variety of antibiotics and micro-organisms and may have important therapeutic implications.  the authors have evaluated the pae produced by teicoplanin, fucidin, gentamicin,  rifampicin and ciprofloxacin against a total of ten gram-positive organisms (s. aureus (2), mrsa (2), s. epidermis (2) s. haemolyticus (2) and e. faecalis (2)).  all the organisms were clinical isolates with variable sensitivity patterns confirmed by disc and mic testing. mics were performed by the broth dilution method using a final inoculum of 10 x 5 cfu/ml. the pae was estimated by adding 5 x mic of each antibiotic to a log phase of growth of approximately 10 x 7 cfu/ml, and incubating at 37 degrees c for 1 h. antibiotic was removed by 1000-fold dilution in nutrient broth, and total viable counts were carried out hourly by the miles and misra method for a further 9 h. all the antibiotics tested showed a pae against the organisms tested, except for fucidin and ciprofloxacin against the enterococci. overall, teicoplanin showed a maximum pae of 5 h against msra and a minimum of 0.6 h against e. faecalis. gentamicin, rifampicin and ciprofloxacin also showed a variable range. fucidin showed the least pae against  the ten organisms, ranging from 0-1.3 h, except for s. epidermidis (fuc-r) which  had a pae of up to 4.5 h. the duration of pae of each antibiotic/organism combination varied and was associated with the sensitivity pattern of the organism.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == the prevalence of staphylococcal resistance to penicillinase-resistant penicillins. a retrospective and prospective national surveillance trial of isolates from 40 medical centers.
AB  == in a retrospective survey of resistance to penicillinase-resistant penicillins (prps) in 152,076 clinical staphylococcal strains isolated in 40 united states hospitals in 1985 and 1986, rates of resistance to oxacillin were found to be 11  and 13%, respectively, among staphylococcus aureus isolates. the rates were approximately four times higher among coagulase-negative staphylococcal strains.  in a prospective study of 1,408 wound or bacteremia isolates from the participant hospitals, oxacillin and methicillin agar screening, disk diffusion, and broth microdilution testing were conducted at a single reference laboratory. these tests yielded prp resistance rates of 15% among s. aureus, 75% among s. epidermidis, and 48% among other coagulase-negative strains. no major changes in  the distribution of resistance rates among hospitals or by hospital type were observed. dilution susceptibility testing of several antimicrobial agents against prp-resistant isolates and species-matched susceptible isolates from the same hospital showed that teicoplanin and vancomycin were the most active drugs (100%  of s. aureus isolates were susceptible). teicoplanin and vancomycin disk diffusion testing of all prp-resistant staphylococcal strains also showed that these isolates were susceptible to the glycopeptides. however, agar dilution screening and broth microdilution tests revealed that several coagulase-negative  strains, predominantly s. haemolyticus, had teicoplanin mics greater than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml. s. haemolyticus isolates represented a very small number of the total stains tested. teicoplanin and vancomycin were also the most  active drugs when tested against older (1962-82) clinical prp-resistant s. aureus strains from the reference laboratory collection. the methods found to be superior in detecting prp-resistant strains were the oxacillin 6 micrograms/ml agar screening test in 4% nacl-supplemented mueller-hinton agar and the 1 microgram oxacillin disk test. by reference laboratory standards, participant laboratories were incorrect in only 2.3% of species identifications and 4.5% of oxacillin-susceptibility determinations, indicating acceptable contemporary agreement and accuracy.

TI  == [resistance profiles of the various species of the genus staphylococcus to 15 clinically-used antimicrobials].
AB  == a total of 78 strains of 11 species of staphylococcus genus (29 s. aureus, 48 staphylococcus coagulase-negative and 1 s. intermedius strain,) were studied in order to determine the resistance patterns to fifteen commonly used antimicrobial agents. out of 48 staphylococcus coagulase-negative strains studied, 8 (4/15 s. epidermidis, 1/10 s. hominis, 1/6 s. haemolyticus, 2/3 s. xylosus) showed resistance patterns similar to that of s. aureus strains against beta-lactam antibiotics, aminoglycosides, chloramphenicol and fosfomycin, and 10 exhibit beta-lactamase-activity. although the 7 s. saprophyticus strains assayed were beta-lactamase-negative by the chromogenic cephalosporin method after induction,  the penicillin g minimal inhibitory concentration values were slightly higher than those obtained with other beta-lactamase-negative species. the susceptibilities to erythromycin and clindamycin suggested that macrolides-lincosamides-streptogramin type b (mls) resistance was present in a large number of staphylococcus coagulase-negative strains. in all the staphylococcus genus, the aminoglycosides resistance seems to be mediated by the  same aminoglycosides modifying-enzymes. vancomycin was very active against the 11 species assayed. rifampicin was effective with all staphylococcus coagulase-negative strains. the s. aureus rifampicin-resistant were also resistant to oxacillin, and variable against aminoglycosides, chloramphenicol, fosfomycin, erythromycin and clindamycin. only 5 strains were resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (tms), 1 s. aureus oxacillin-susceptible, 1 s. aureus oxacillin-resistant, 2 s. xylosus and 1 s. warneri strains.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance in nosocomial isolates of staphylococcus haemolyticus.
AB  == staphylococcus haemolyticus is frequently cultured from hospitalized patients and is characterized by resistance to multiple antimicrobial agents. we found that s. haemolyticus represented 70 of 524 (13%) coagulase-negative staphylococcal isolates identified by the clinical microbiology laboratories of two hospitals over 2 months. s. haemolyticus isolates were recovered from wounds (44%), urine (26%), blood (10%), and other sources (20%). all s. haemolyticus isolates were tested for susceptibility to six antimicrobial agents; 77% were resistant to three or more agents, and 41% were resistant to five or six agents. in addition,  among 47 multiply resistant isolates, high mics (greater than or equal to 6.25 micrograms/ml) of vancomycin (62% of isolates) and teicoplanin (91% of isolates)  were found. dna probes which were derived from s. epidermidis or s. aureus and which contained sequences associated with resistance to antimicrobial agents were used to detect specific genes in the total cellular and plasmid dnas of 10 resistant s. haemolyticus isolates. resistance gene probes and the numbers of resistant isolates hybridizing were as follows: methicillin, 10 of 10; gentamicin, 9 of 10; erythromycin, 7 of 10; and trimethoprim, 0 of 10. genes for  resistance to methicillin were found only in chromosomal locations, genes for resistance to gentamicin were found in both chromosomal and plasmid locations, and genes for resistance to erythromycin were found in plasmid locations only. with the exception of trimethoprim resistance determinants, similar genes were found among concurrently isolated multiply resistant s. epidermidis isolates from our hospitals. s. haemolyticus is a potentially important nosocomial species which readily acquires antimicrobial resistance genes and which shares, to some extent, in a common gene pool with s. epidermidis.

TI  == comparative virulence of human isolates of coagulase-negative staphylococci tested in an infant mouse weight retardation model.
AB  == human infections caused by coagulase-negative staphylococci have steadily increased in numbers and severity. causes may be the use of artificial prostheses, immunocompromising chemotherapy and radiation therapy, and sophisticated surgical techniques, to name a few. although the infectivity of coagulase-negative staphylococci as a group has been well documented for humans,  attempts to study the pathogenesis of infections caused by individual species of  coagulase-negative staphylococci have been hampered by the lack of an animal model that is not refractory to infection by these organisms. in the study reported here, a 2-day-old-mouse weight retardation test was used to assay the virulence of 60 clinical and reference strains of coagulase-negative staphylococci. these strains represented eight species of coagulase-negative staphylococci. the most virulent strains were demonstrated to be of the species staphylococcus haemolyticus, s. saprophyticus, and s. epidermidis. the data further suggest that production of slime is a marker of virulence in s. epidermidis and that intraspecies differences in virulence occur.

AB  == the authors examined 150 strains of s. aureus and 180 strains of s. epidermidis isolated from different dermatoses. the determination of s. aureus and s. epidermidis was based on common routine tests as plasmacoagulase, production of hemolysin, acid production from mannitol and production of pigment. this determination was verified with the aid of a new identification system staphytest. the staphytest confirmed the previous diagnosis of s. aureus in 60.66% and that of s. epidermidis in 31.66% of strains only. the remaining strains were identified by means of staphytest as s. simulans, s. xylosus, s. hominis, s. haemolyticus, s. warneri, s. auricularis, s. sciuri and micrococcus sp. the authors discuss the importance of an curate identification of skin staphylococci by means of staphytest for taxonomic purposes and for classification of staphylococci influence on different dermatoses.

TI  == bacterial contamination of intraocular lenses: the source of the bacteria.
AB  == in order to investigate potential sources for the bacterial contamination of intraocular lenses, specimens were taken for culture from a variety of sites. a swab from the lid margin, the operating room air, an intraocular lens which was allowed to rest on the eye, and the sodium hyaluronate were cultured during routine intercapsular lens implant surgery on 31 patients. positive cultures were obtained from six intraocular lenses. subtyping by three independent methods showed that isolates from five of these lenses were indistinguishable from bacteria cultured from the air. in the case of the sixth lens a bacterial isolate from the lid margin matched with that from the lens. staphylococcus epidermidis was cultured from four lenses; staphylococcus haemolyticus was also isolated from one of these four lenses and the remaining two lenses produced isolates of staphylococcus aureus.

TI  == inactivation of lincosaminide antibiotics in staphylococcus. identification of lincosaminide o-nucleotidyltransferases and comparison of the corresponding resistance genes.
AB  == resistance to lincomycin by inactivation has been detected in numerous clinical isolates of staphylococcus; in crude extracts of staphylococcus haemolyticus bm4610 and staphylococcus aureus bm4611, inactivation of lincomycin and clindamycin requires the presence of a nucleoside 5'-triphosphate (atp, gtp, ctp, or utp) as nucleotidyl donor and mg2+ as cofactor. the biochemical mechanism of lincosaminide inactivation was elucidated by determination of the structure of inactivated lincomycin and clindamycin by physicochemical techniques, including uv absorption spectrophotometry, 31p and 1h nuclear magnetic resonance, and periodate oxidation. in the two strains, inactivation of lincomycin gave rise to  lincomycin 3-(5'-adenylate), whereas clindamycin was inactivated through its conversion to clindamycin 4-(5'-adenylate). the gene lina' encoding the 3-lincomycin, 4-clindamycin o-nucleotidyltransferase in s. aureus bm4611 has been sequenced and displays 93% homology with the gene lina encoding the 3-lincomycin, 4-clindamycin o-nucleotidyltransferase found in s. haemolyticus bm4610. the two enzymes are 161 amino acids long and differ by 14 amino acid substitutions.

TI  == protective effect of glucan against experimentally induced staphylococcal mastitis in ewes.
AB  == glucan, an immunostimulant, was evaluated for its ability to modify a staphylococcal mammary challenge in ewes. glucan was administered subcutaneously  to ewes prior to lactation or during lactation, and all ewes, including a control group, were subsequently challenged intramammarily with staphylococcus haemolyticus 40 days after the mean lambing date. the glucan treatment was shown  to modify the staphylococcal mammary infection as the milk bacterial counts from  all of the glucan-treated groups were significantly reduced compared to controls. for the glucan-treated groups, the highest mean somatic cell counts were recorded 1 day post-challenge, while for the control group, the mean cell count rose more  gradually to peak by 3 days post-challenge. glucan did not increase serum lysozyme levels or blood neutrophil bactericidal activity. however, there was a negative correlation between the bactericidal activity of blood neutrophils collected from the glucan-treated ewes prior to challenge and their mean milk bacterial counts post-challenge. glucan was observed to stimulate ovine mammary macrophages in vitro, while the addition of zymosan or opsonised killed staphylococcus aureus to macrophage cultures had no effect. these studies indicate that, in sheep, glucan can enhance some elements of the immune system against staphylococcal infections.

TI  == the in vitro activity of ramoplanin (a-16686/mdl 62,198), vancomycin and teicoplanin against methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus spp.
AB  == ramoplanin (a-16686/mdl 62,198) is a novel lipoglycopeptide antimicrobial, comprised of three closely related polypeptides containing chlorinated phenyl moieties and d-mannose, isolated from the fermentation products of actinoplanes sp. atcc 33076. the antimicrobial activity of ramoplanin is limited to gram-positive bacteria and its reportedly unacceptable administration side-effects suggest that any potential clinical role will be limited to the topical therapy of superficial skin infections and the eradication of bacteria, representing a possible nosocomial cross-infection source, from carriage sites. in this study the mics of ramoplanin have been determined for methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant isolates of staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis and s. haemolyticus and compared with those of two glycopeptide antimicrobials, vancomycin and teicoplanin. mics were determined using an agar incorporation technique in mueller-hinton medium with an inoculum of 10(5) cfu. ramoplanin was 2-8 times more active than either vancomycin or teicoplanin against methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant isolates of s. aureus and methicillin-susceptible isolates of s. epidermidis. isolates of methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis and both methicillin-susceptible and -resistant isolates of s. haemolyticus were generally less susceptible to teicoplanin than to vancomycin. ramoplanin was significantly more active than either vancomycin or teicoplanin against these isolates. these results suggest that the clinical evaluation of ramoplanin as a topical antibacterial agent for the control of superficial infections caused by staphylococcus spp. and for the eradication of methicillin-resistant s. aureus from carriage sites, is justified.

TI  == bactericidal activity of teicoplanin in an in-vitro two-compartment kinetic model.
AB  == the bactericidal activity of teicoplanin was studied in a model system in which antibiotic concentration is continuously varied. a two-compartment open model was used to reproduce, in vitro serum pharmacokinetics of teicoplanin in humans during 24 h after iv administration. staphylococcal and streptococcal strains of  various species were tested. teicoplanin showed rapid killing of staphylococcus epidermidis and staph. hominis. all strains of staph. epidermidis were rapidly killed in spite of the high mic values (4-16 mg/l). the killing effect against staph. haemolyticus was less rapid and marked than against staph. epidermidis, with strain to strain variation. a 99.9% kill was achieved for most strains within 22 h, but with other isolates regrowth occurred which was due to the presence of highly resistant cells in the original population. other staphylococci (staph. aureus, staph. saprophyticus) and streptococcus pyogenes, str. bovis and str. salivarius were reduced by 99.9% within 22 h. bactericidal activity against other streptococci (str. mutans, str. agalactiae, str. faecalis, str. faecium) was less marked; against str. sanguis teicoplanin was bacteriostatic.

TI  == phenotypic expression and genetic heterogeneity of lincosamide inactivation in staphylococcus spp.
AB  == we examined the resistance phenotype and the genetic basis of lincosamide modification in 25 clinical isolates of staphylococcus spp. inactivating lincomycin and clindamycin. the strains were resistant to high levels of lincomycin but remained susceptible to clindamycin. however, mbcs and inoculum effects showed that the activity of clindamycin was impaired. the distribution in these strains of nucleotide sequences related to lina and lina', the genes encoding lincosamide nucleotidylation in staphylococcus haemolyticus bm4610 and s. aureus bm4611, respectively, was studied by dot blot hybridization. the genes  responsible for lincosamide inactivation in staphylococcus spp. were found to constitute a family of related sequences which are not species specific.

TI  == in vitro antistaphylococcal activity of pefloxacin alone and in combination with  other antistaphylococcal drugs.
AB  == mics of pefloxacin and nine antistaphylococcal drugs were determined for 200 isolates of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus haemolyticus, staphylococcus hominis, and staphylococcus saprophyticus. all the strains were susceptible to pefloxacin, vancomycin, and rifampin. oxacillin-resistant strains were uniformly resistant to cephalothin and were more likely to be resistant to gentamicin, erythromycin, clindamycin, doxycycline, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole than were oxacillin-susceptible strains. time-kill  studies with 23 strains of s. aureus, s. epidermidis, and s. haemolyticus indicated that the relative order of bactericidal activities was gentamicin greater than or equal to pefloxacin greater than oxacillin greater than vancomycin greater than rifampin. pefloxacin combined with oxacillin or vancomycin killed staphylococci more rapidly than oxacillin or vancomycin alone but less rapidly than pefloxacin alone. gentamicin combined with oxacillin, vancomycin, or pefloxacin resulted in the most rapid killing of gentamicin-susceptible strains. rifampin combined with oxacillin, vancomycin, or  pefloxacin reduced the bactericidal activities of those drugs, but rifampin resistance was not observed as it was with rifampin alone. pefloxacin is a potentially useful antistaphylococcal agent.

TI  == quality control limits for teicoplanin susceptibility tests and confirmation of disk diffusion interpretive criteria.
AB  == for monitoring the performance of teicoplanin susceptibility tests, the following quality control limits are recommended: staphylococcus aureus atcc 29213, mic of  0.12 to 0.5 micrograms/ml; enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212, mic of 0.06 to 0.25  micrograms/ml; and s. aureus atcc 25923, zones 15 to 19 mm in diameter (30-micrograms disks). however, some lots of mueller-hinton agar provided unusually large zones of inhibition with both vancomycin and teicoplanin disks, and these lots should be excluded before routine use. teicoplanin and vancomycin  differed only in their activity against oxacillin-resistant strains of staphylococcus haemolyticus, which had decreased susceptibility to teicoplanin but were fully susceptible to vancomycin. for tests with 30-micrograms teicoplanin disks, zones less than or equal to 10 and greater than or equal to 14 mm in diameter represent resistant and susceptible breakpoints, respectively.

AB  == the in vitro susceptibilities of 260 strains of coagulase-negative staphylococci  to penicillin g, oxacillin, nafcillin, methicillin, cephalothin, and seven non-beta-lactam antimicrobial agents were determined and compared with the susceptibilities of 54 strains of staphylococcus aureus with known patterns of susceptibility. penicillin g susceptibility for s. aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus haemolyticus, and staphylococcus hominis was readily  determined by using beta-lactamase tests with induced cells and with a standardized microdilution test. mic criteria for susceptibility used for s. aureus were applicable to the coagulase-negative species. percentages of organisms susceptible were as follows: s. epidermidis, 7%; s. haemolyticus, 5%; and s. hominis, 47%. oxacillin susceptibility for these four species was readily  determined by using a modification of the microdilution test. mic criteria for susceptibility used for s. aureus were applicable to s. haemolyticus and s. hominis, but alternate criteria were necessary for s. epidermidis. percentages of organisms susceptible were as follows: s. epidermidis, 29%; s. haemolyticus, 36%; and s. hominis, 97%. staphylococcus saprophyticus differed from the other staphylococcal species; all strains were beta-lactamase negative and were penicillin susceptible but had higher penicillin g mics than did susceptible strains of the other species. there was total cross resistance among the penicillinase-resistant penicillins and cephalothin for the coagulase-negative staphylococci as well as for s. aureus; oxacillin mics were more reliable than mics of the other drugs or a standardized disk diffusion test for distinguishing  resistant from susceptible strains. vancomycin, rifampin, and ciprofloxacin were  consistently active against all staphylococci. erythromycin, clindamycin, gentamicin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole were more active against oxacillin-susceptible staphylococci than against oxacillin-resistant staphylococci.

AB  == flurithromycin is an (8,s)-8-fluoroerythromycin isolated from the fermentation broth of streptomyces erythraeus atcc 31772, a blocked mutant of a strain producer of erythromycin. its in vitro antibacterial activity has been determined on recent clinical isolates of respiratory pathogens. the range of mic for streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus beta-haemolyticus group a is from 0.0015 to 0.006 microgram/ml, for haemophilus influenzae from 0.012 to 0.4 microgram/ml, for staphylococcus aureus from 0.1 to 3.1 micrograms/ml. its action is bacteriostatic and increases at alkaline ph. among anaerobes clostridium perfringens, bacteroides fragilis, other species of bacteroides and peptostreptococcus are particularly susceptible. flurithromycin also showed some  activity on mycobacterium bovis, m. scrofulaceum and m. phley. the determination  of killing curves indicated that in most cases a killing effect was obtained at 4 x mic. a combination of flurithromycin with ampicillin or doxycycline sometimes was synergic, but more often additive and never antagonistic. the possible interference of flurithromycin on some parameters of the natural system of defense was determined. at concentrations equal to therapeutic levels in blood and tissues, flurithromycin did not influence chemotaxis, phagocytosis, metabolic activation and the killing activity of neutrophils.

TI  == slime production by bovine milk staphylococcus aureus and identification of coagulase-negative staphylococcal isolates.
AB  == staphylococcus aureus isolates from bovine milk were assessed for capsule or slime production. when pure s. aureus cultures in milk were inoculated directly into serum-soft agar constituted with a modified staphylococcus 110 medium, 100%  of the isolates grew with diffuse colony morphology. diffuse colony morphology was rapidly lost on subculture and was more rapidly lost in brain heart infusion-serum-soft agar. no evidence was seen for encapsulation in india ink preparations or by the clumping factor test. it was concluded that freshly isolated s. aureus strains produce slime, not true capsules. during examination of the 84 milk samples that grew staphylococci in addition to s. aureus (27.4%),  a significant number of coagulase-negative staphylococcal species were encountered and identified by conventional tests as s. simulans (41.7%), s. xylosus (11.9%), s. epidermidis (3.6%), s. saprophyticus (3.6%), s. hyicus (2.9%), s. cohnii (1.2%), s. haemolyticus (1.2%), and s. warneri (1.2%). five isolates (6.0%) were not identified. attempts were also made to identify the isolates by the api staph-ident system, which gave an overall accuracy of 45.2%.  the susceptibilities of the isolates to a variety of antibiotics were determined, and they appeared to be less resistant than human clinical isolates.

AB  == the purified antigonococcal substance produced by staphylococcus haemolyticus no. 7 has shown a broad antigonococcal spectrum and a narrow antibacterial spectrum.  the inhibitor produced in vitro was also active in the guinea pig subcutaneous chamber. the inhibitor has shown hemolytic activity; the human, horse, and mouse  erythrocytes were the most susceptible. hemolytic and antigonococcal activities were inhibited in the presence of phosphatidylcholine. the amino acid composition of the antigonococcal substance was characterized by the absence of proline, tyrosine, histidine, cysteine, and tryptophan. the molecular weight was found to  be 2,565, and the major isoelectric points were 4.8 and 4.9 in the presence of 8  m urea and 4.6 without urea. the inhibitor has some properties similar to those of the delta toxin of staphylococcus aureus, although the two substances are different based mainly on their chemical characteristics. also an antiserum directed against the gonococcal inhibitor did not give a precipitation line with  the delta toxin, indicating that the two substances are antigenically unrelated.

AB  == representatives of 13 species of staphylococcus were examined using a small-scale procedure for the sequential extraction of isoprenoid quinones and polar lipids.  menaquinones were the only isoprenoid quinones found in the 77 test strains which were divided into three groups based upon the predominant isoprenologue detected: (i) s. hyicus subsp. hyicus, s. sciuri subsp. lentus and s. sciuri subsp. sciuri  contained unsaturated menaquinones with six isoprene units; (ii) s. capitis, s. cohnii, s. epidermidis, s. haemolyticus, s. hominis, s. hyicus subsp. chromogenes, s. intermedius, s. saprophyticus, s. simulans, s. warneri and s. xylosus contained unsaturated menaquinones with seven isoprene units and (iii) s. aureus contained unsaturated menaquinones with eight isoprene units and varying amounts of the corresponding lower isoprenologue. all of the organisms contained  very similar polar lipid patterns consisting of diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, beta-gentiobiosyl diacylglycerol and a number of glycolipids and phospholipids. one of the glycolipids was chromatographically indistinguishable from beta-gentiotriosyl diacylglycerol. lysylphosphatidylglycerol was a major component in s. aureus and s. intermedius but was usually present in minor amounts in the coagulase-negative strains. the polar lipid data underline the homogeneity of the genus staphylococcus and distinguish staphylococci from aerobic, gram-positive cocci and from the phylogenetically related aerobic, endospore-forming bacteria. menaquinone composition can also be used to separate staphylococci from other aerobic, gram-positive cocci.

TI  == identification, clinical distribution, and susceptibility to methicillin and 18 additional antibiotics of clinical staphylococcus isolates: nationwide investigation in italy.
AB  == a multicentric study of clinical staphylococcus isolates was performed by seven operative units working in different areas of italy. over a 6-month period, a total of 3,226 staphylococci, isolated from in- and outpatients, were identified  and tested for antimicrobial susceptibility by a protocol agreed upon by all units. on the basis of their bacteriolytic-activity patterns and other conventional tests, the isolates were identified by lyogroups , which closely correlate with human staphylococcus species. lyogroup i (staphylococcus aureus) and lyogroup iii (staphylococcus capitis) were the most and the least frequently  isolated staphylococci, respectively. significant differences depending on strain origin from in- or outpatients were only observed with lyogroup iv (i.e., novobiocin- resistant staphylococci), whose isolation from outpatients was three  times greater than from inpatients. lyogroup i was predominant among isolates from most clinical sources. lyogroup iv predominated in strains isolated from the urinary tract; lyogroup v (staphylococcus epidermidis) predominated in strains from blood, cerebrospinal fluid, and indwelling artificial devices; and lyogroup  vi ( staphylococcus hominis, staphylococcus haemolyticus, and staphylococcus warneri ) predominated in strains from bile and the male genital tract. the incidence of methicillin resistance within the different lyogroups varied from unit to unit, suggesting epidemiological differences among different hospitals and different geographical areas. on the whole, methicillin resistance was more frequent in coagulase-negative staphylococci than in s. aureus and ranged from 19% for lyogroups i and iii to 30% for lyogroup ii (staphylococcus simulans). laboratory testing with 18 additional antibiotics suggested the occurrence of some specific differences in susceptibility among the different lyogroups . the rate of organisms resistant to the various antibiotics was greater among methicillin-resistant than among methicillin -susceptible staphylococci; particularly marked differences occurred with cephalosporins, rifampin, gentamicin, and tobramycin. the results suggested an increasing spread in italy,  during the last few years, of staphylococcal resistance to methicillin and to many other antibiotics. some questions about the actual reliability of laboratory tests for the determination of staphylococcal susceptibility to methicillin and other beta-lactam antibiotics were raised by parallel test performances in which  both unsupplemented and 5% nacl-supplemented mueller-hinton agars were used. the  presence of nacl heightened, on the whole, the number of resistant strains detected; however, a few isolates resistant in the unsupplemented medium and susceptible in the salt-supplemented medium were also encountered. this was true  not only for methicillin but also for all other beta-lactam antibiotics tested except cefamandole. with cefamandole, the presence of 5% nacl reduced the number  of resistant strains detected.

TI  == staphylococci isolated from abscesses in slaughtered animals: characterization and epidemiological studies.
AB  == a total of 71 strains of gram positive, catalase positive cocci were isolated from 112 abscesses observed during inspection of slaughtered animals (sheep, cattle, pigs and goats). on the basis of lysostaphin sensitivity, all strains were identified as staphylococci. however, 4 of them did not ferment glucose anaerobically. classification at the species level was accomplished by complete characterization of the strains. amongst the 35 coagulase positive isolates, 30 were classified as s. aureus, 2 as s. intermedius and 3 could not be classified.  of the 36 coagulase negative cultures, 1 was classed as s. hyicus subsp. hyicus,  3 as s. simulans, 2 as s. haemolyticus, 5 as s. hominis, 3 as s. epidermidis, 2 as s. capitis, 3 as s. warneri, 4 as s. xylosus, 1 as s. cohnii and 1 as s. saprophyticus. the remaining 11 strains could not be classified. seventeen of the 30 s. aureus strains belonged to biotype c, 7 were classified as intermediate (shared properties of biotypes a and c), 3 as similar to bitype c, 1 as similar to biotype a and 2 could not be biotyped. twelve of the 16 biotype c strains showed characteristic properties of ovine s. aureus. the number of strains lysed  by phages of human and bovine origin was 11 and 18, respectively. as many as 25 strains (23 s. aureus and 2 coagulase positive, unclassified cultures) produced enterotoxins. the enterotoxins produced were: c (14 strains), d (2 strains), a (1 strain), e (1 strain), a + c (1 strain) and a + d (6 strains). a good correlation between the type of enterotoxin produced, biotype and phage type was observed.

TI  == numerical taxonomy of staphylococci.
AB  == over two hundred staphylococci from human and animal sources and representatives  of established species of staphylococcus, micrococcus and planococcus were compared in a numerical phenetic survey using 115 unit characters. data were analyzed using the jaccard coefficient and the unweighted pair group method with  averages algorithm. cluster composition was not markedly affected by test error,  estimated as 3.49%. the staphylococci were assigned to eighteen clusters containing four or more strains and to three single member clusters. most of the  clusters were distinct and homogeneous though two were divided into subclusters.  some of the clusters and subclusters were equated with the established taxa s. aureus, s. capitis, s. cohnii, s. epidermidis, s. haemolyticus, s. hominis, s. hyicus, s. saprophyticus, s. sciuri subspecies lentus, s. sciuri subspecies sciuri, s. simulans, s. warneri and s. xylosus, the remaining ones may represent  the nuclei of additional centres of variation. the numerical data also cast doubts upon the reliability of some of the tests recommended for the identification of coagulase-negative staphylococci.

TI  == binding of fibronectin to staphylococcus strains.
AB  == fibronectin, a major protein component of plasma and loose connective tissue has  previously been shown to bind to several strains of staphylococcus aureus. we examined a large number of strains of different species of staphylococcus with respect to their ability to bind fibronectin. the relative numbers of strains defined as fibronectin-binders among the different species were as follows: s. aureus (22 of 23), s. haemolyticus (5 of 5), s. warneri (8 of 11), s. hyicus (5 of 6), s. hominis (13 of 17), s. saprophyticus (11 of 20), s. epidermidis (4 of 7), and s. simulans (8 of 10). only three species showed a predominance of nonbinders over binders: s. capitis (4 of 14), s. xylosus (0 of 4), and s. cohnii (3 of 11). these data indicate that staphylococcal species isolated from soft tissue infections frequently have the ability to bind fibronectin and suggest that the ability to bind to this protein may contribute to the virulence of coagulase-positive and coagulase-negative staphylococci.

TI  == chemical composition and structure of cell wall teichoic acids of staphylococci.
AB  == the cell wall teichoic acid structures of 22 staphylococci including 13 type strains were determined. most of the strains contain a poly(polyolphosphate) teichoic acid with glycerol and/or ribitol as polyol component. the polyolphosphate backbone is partially substituted with various combinations of sugars and/or amino sugars. most of the substituents occur in a monomeric form but some strains also contain dimers of n-acetylglucosamine as substituents. staphylococcus hyicus subsp. hyicus nctc 10350 and s. sciuri dsm 20352 revealed rather complex cell wall teichoic acids. they consist of repeating sequences of phosphate-glycerol-phosphate-n-acetylglucosamine. the amino sugar component is present in this case as a monomer or an oligomer (n less than or equal to 3). moreover, the glycerol residues are partially substituted with n-acetylglucosamine. the cell wall teichoic acid of s. auricularis is a poly(n-acetylglucosaminyl-phosphate) polymer similar to that found in s. caseolyticus atcc29750. the cell wall teichoic acid structures for type strains of s. auricularis, s. capitis, s. cohnii, s. haemolyticus, s. hominis, s. hyicus  subsp. hyicus, s. sciuri, s. xylosus and s. warneri were determined for the first time in detail. the structures of some of the previously described teichoic acids had to be revised (s. epidermidis, s. simulans, s. aureus phage type 187).

AB  == cellular fatty acid composition was examined in 61 strains of coagulase-negative  staphylococci of bovine milk origin and 19 strains of staphylococcus aureus and s. epidermidis serving as reference strains. the 61 strains had been divided into 9 species in accordance with the classification of kloos & schleifer. when s. aureus and the coagulase-negative staphylococci were examined, they contained iso-c15:0, anteiso-c15:0, c18:0, and c20:0 as main fatty acids. there was no marked difference in the cellular fatty acid composition between any two staphylococcal species. the percent cellular fatty acid composition of each species was regarded as one of the quantities of continuity and subjected to the  analysis of variance by the unary configuration method. as a result, s. capitis,  s. cohnii, s. epidermidis, and s. xylosus seemed to have a cellular fatty acid composition a little different from that of any other species. when similarity values among all the strains were calculated, they were 0.89 or more and made it  possible to divide all the strains into two large groups at the similarity value  of 0.90. in the one group the iso-c15:0 was a characteristic fatty acid. in the other group the anteiso-c15:0 was a characteristic fatty acid. to the first group belonged s. hyicus and s. lentus. to the second group belonged s. cohnii, s. epidermidis, s. haemolyticus, s. hominis, s. saprophyticus, and s. warneri. in the two groups were distributed s. aureus, s. capitis, s. simulans, and s. xylosus.

TI  == [resistance to antibiotics of bacteria involved in respiratory infections (author's transl)].
AB  == the present status of resistance to antibiotics of bacteria involved in respiratory infections is reviewed. schematically it can outlined as follows. streptococcus b-haemolyticus as well as pneumococcus did not change their sensitivity to penicillin, but some strains are now resistant to tetracycline. streptococcus viridans, enterococcus and h. influenzae did not change substantially their sensitivity to antibiotics. staphylococcus aureus is the bacterial species that always poses some problems with regard to antibiotic resistance. due to the selection of strains penicillinase-producing because of the large use of penicillin, the most part of clinical isolates of staphylococci  is now resistant to penicillin. in addition an increased number of strains resistant to the other antibiotics has been registered as soon as they has been introduced in therapy. the resistant strains spread in a particularly rapid way in hospital. the introduction in therapy of penicillinase-resistant penicillins constituted a remarkable advance in therapy of staphylococcal infection. however, there is now a growing number of indications about the emergence of methicillin resistant strains of staphylococci. on the other hand it must be recalled that since 1960 a marked reduction of incidence and mortality in severe staphylococcal infections has been noted. incidence and mortality of respiratory infections due  to gram-negative bacilli is augmented particularly in connection with a larger use of immunosuppressive and antineoplastic therapies, of particular surgical or  reanimation procedures, of intensive courses of antibiotic therapy etc. emergence of pseudomonas, proteus, serratia, providencia, etc. infections poses many difficult problems of chemotherapy since these species are scarcely sensitive to  antibiotics. carbenicillin, cephalosporins, sisomicin, tobramycin, amikacin are the more recent drugs that alone or in combination may offer some chances of success in this field.

AB  == the antimicrobial property of human uterine cervical mucus was tested in three groups of women. healthy women, using no contraception, women using an intrauterine device and women receiving hormonal treatment for contraception. cervical mucus was taken on the 10th, 14th, 18th and 22nd day of the menstrual cycle. cervical mucus had a strong inhibitory effect on the growth of micrococcus lysodeicticus in all three groups. the strength of the inhibitory effect on the other microorganisms were in the following order: staphylococcus albus, staphylococcus aureus, proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli, candida albicans, streptococcus haemolyticus, streptococcus faecalis. use of an intrauterine device did not affect the antimicrobial effect of cervical mucus. the use of hormonal contraceptive canceled the antimicrobial effect on the series of microorganisms,  with the exception of m. lysodeicticus. the maximum inhibitory effect occurred on the 14th day and declined toward the end of the menstrual cycle.

TI  == [the inhibition of various bacterial proteinases with natural proteinase inhibitiors(author's transl)].
AB  == proteus mirabilis, citrobacter intermedius, staphylococcus aureus haemolyticus and staphylococcus albus produce extracellualr proteinases with maximum activity  at ph 7.8. these proteinases are inhibited practically completely by human and animal blood serum. this inhibitory activity of human serum is caused by alpha2-macroglobulin. ovomucoid showed nearly the same inhibitory activity as alpha2-macroglobulin.

TI  == the occurrence of peroxide in cultures of pneumococcus.
AB  == 1. conditions which favor the formation and accumulation of peroxide in broth cultures of pneumococcus are free access of air, and the absence of catalase, peroxidase, and other catalysts capable of decomposing this compound. under these favorable conditions peroxide becomes demonstrable in the culture fluid during the logarithmic phase of growth and persists for a period of at least 6 to 12 days. 2. in the absence of these favorable conditions the formation of peroxide is inhibited. in a culture with deficient oxygen exposure the accumulation of peroxide is delayed; when anaerobic conditions are maintained the substance is not formed. in the presence of active catalysts, peroxide does not accumulate in  the medium in quantities sufficient to give a positive reaction. the accumulation of peroxide in pneumococcus cultures is dependent upon the balance between the amount produced by the microorganisms and the amount destroyed by substances in the medium. 3. the peroxide formed in pneumococcus cultures is unstable. it gradually disappears during prolonged incubation at 37 degrees c.; it is less stable in alkaline than in neutral or acid media. it is destroyed in culture filtrates exposed to the temperature of boiling water for 15 minutes, and to that of steam under pressure (15 pounds) for 10 minutes. 4. peroxide formation occurred early in broth cultures of the seven strains of pneumococcus and of the  six strains of non-hemolytic streptococci studied. fifteen of twenty-three strains of streptococcus haemolyticus and one of three strains of streptococcus mucosus formed peroxide. in the positively reacting cultures of streptococcus haemolyticus and streptococcus mucosus the presence of peroxide was not demonstrable until the 3rd to 5th day of incubation. peroxide could not be detected at any time during growth of the two strains of staphylococcus aureus.
