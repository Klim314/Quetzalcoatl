TI  == proteolytic activity of gut bacteria isolated from the velvet bean caterpillar anticarsia gemmatalis.
AB  == the development of proteinase inhibitors as potential insect control agents has been constrained by insect adaptation to these compounds. the velvet bean caterpillar (anticarsia gemmatalis) is a key soybean pest species that is well-adapted to proteinase inhibitors, particularly serine-proteinase inhibitors, which are abundant in the caterpillar host. the expression of diverse proteolytic enzymes by gut symbionts may allow the velvet bean caterpillar to circumvent proteinase inhibitors produced by the host plant. in this study, we characterized the proteolytic activity of the four nonpathogenic species of gut bacteria isolated from the velvet bean caterpillar-bacillus cereus, enterococcus gallinarum, enterococcus mundtii and staphylococcus xylosus. two proteinase substrates, n-alpha-benzoyl-l-arg-p-nitroanilide (l-bapna) and n-alpha-p-tosyl-l-arg methyl ester (l-tame) and five proteinase inhibitors [aprotinin, e-64, ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (edta), pepstatin and n-alpha-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone (tlck)] as well as cacl2, ph and temperature profiles were used to characterize the expressed proteolytic activity of these bacterial strains in vitro. kinetic parameters for proteolytic activity  were also estimated. the results of these experiments indicated that serine- and  cysteine-proteinase activities were expressed by all four gut bacteria symbionts  of the velvet bean caterpillar. the cysteine- and serine-proteinase activities of these gut symbionts were distinct and different from that of gut proteinases of the caterpillar itself. this finding provides support for the potential involvement of gut symbionts in the mitigation of the negative effects of serine-proteinase inhibitors in the velvet bean caterpillar.

TI  == characterization and identification of proteolytic bacteria from the gut of the velvetbean caterpillar (lepidoptera: noctuidae).
AB  == the characterization and identification of proteolytic bacteria from the gut of the velvetbean caterpillar (anticarsia gemmatalis) were the objectives of this study. twelve aerobic and anaerobic isolates of proteolytic bacteria were obtained from the caterpillar gut in calcium caseinate agar. the number of colony forming units (cfus) of proteolytic bacteria was higher when the bacteria were extracted from caterpillars reared on artificial diet rather than on soybean leaves (1.73 +/- 0.35 x 10(3) and 0.55 +/- 0.22 x 10(3) cfu/mg gut, respectively). the isolated bacteria were divided into five distinct groups, according to their polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment-length polymorphism profiles. after molecular analysis, biochemical tests and fatty acid profile determination, the bacteria were identified as bacillus subtilis, bacillus cereus, enterococcus gallinarum, enterococcus mundtii, and staphylococcus xylosus. bacterial proteolytic activity was assessed through in vitro colorimetric assays for (general) proteases, serine proteases, and cysteine proteases. the isolated bacteria were able of hydrolyzing all tested substrates,  except staphylococcus xylosus, which did not exhibit serine protease activity. this study provides support for the hypothesis that gut proteases from velvetbean caterpillar are not exclusively secreted by the insect cells but also by their symbiotic gut bacteria. the proteolytic activity from gut symbionts of the velvetbean caterpillar is suggestive of their potential role minimizing the potentially harmful consequences of protease inhibitors from some of this insect  host plants, such as soybean, with implications for the management of this insect pest species.

TI  == enterocin 012, a bacteriocin produced by enterococcus gallinarum isolated from the intestinal tract of ostrich.
AB  == enterococcus gallinarum strain 012, isolated from the duodenum of ostrich, produced enterocin 012 which is active against ent. faecalis, lactobacillus acidophilus, lact. sake, listeria innocua, propionibacterium acidipropionici, propionibacterium sp., clostridium perfringens, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella typhimurium. one of the four pathogenic strains of escherichia coli isolated from the intestinal tract of ostrich was inhibited by enterocin 012. no  antimicrobial activity was recorded against bacillus cereus, cl. sporogenes, cl.  tyrobutyricum, leuconostoc cremoris, pediococcus pentosaceus, staphylococcus carnosus and streptococcus thermophilus. enterocin 012 was resistant to treatment with lysozyme, catalase, lipase and papain, but sensitive to proteinase k, alpha-chymotrypsin, trypsin and pepsin. treatment of enterocin 012 with gastric juice from the duodenum resulted in a 50% loss of antibacterial activity. half of the activity was lost when incubated at 80 degrees c for 30 min, or when kept overnight at a ph of 1.0-5.0 and ph 11.0 and 12.0, respectively. enterocin 012 production started in mid-logarithmic growth and reached a maximum of 800 au ml-1, but increased further to 1600 au ml-1 in the stationary growth phase. the peptide is approximately 3.4 kda in size, as determined after partial purification with amberlite xad-1180 and ammonium sulphate precipitation, followed by tricine-sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. the mechanism of antimicrobial activity against lact. sake lmg 13558 is bactericidal and caused cell lysis of active growing cells.
