TI  == a sequential statistical approach towards an optimized production of a broad spectrum bacteriocin substance from a soil bacterium bacillus sp. yas 1 strain.
AB  == bacteriocins, ribosomally synthesized antimicrobial peptides, display potential applications in agriculture, medicine, and industry. the present study highlights integral statistical optimization and partial characterization of a bacteriocin substance from a soil bacterium taxonomically affiliated as bacillus sp. yas 1 after biochemical and molecular identifications. a sequential statistical approach (plackett-burman and box-behnken) was employed to optimize bacteriocin (bac yas 1) production. using optimal levels of three key determinants (yeast extract (0.48% (w/v), incubation time (62 hrs), and agitation speed (207 rpm)) in peptone yeast beef based production medium resulted in 1.6-fold enhancement in bac yas 1 level (470 au/ml arbitrary units against erwinia amylovora). bac yas 1  showed activity over a wide range of ph (1-13) and temperature (45-80 degrees c). a wide spectrum antimicrobial activity of bac yas 1 against the human pathogens (clostridium perfringens, staphylococcus epidermidis, campylobacter jejuni, enterobacter aerogenes, enterococcus sp., proteus sp., klebsiella sp., and salmonella typhimurium), the plant pathogen (e. amylovora), and the food spoiler  (listeria innocua) was demonstrated. on top and above, bac yas 1 showed no antimicrobial activity towards lactic acid bacteria (lactobacillus bulgaricus, l. casei, l. lactis, and l. reuteri). promising characteristics of bac yas 1 prompt  its commercialization for efficient utilization in several industries.

TI  == diverse and bioactive endophytic aspergilli inhabit cupressaceae plant family.
AB  == aspergilli are filamentous, cosmopolitan and ubiquitous fungi which have significant impact on human, animal and plant welfare worldwide. due to their extraordinary metabolic diversity, aspergillus species are used in biotechnology  for the production of a vast array of biomolecules. however, little is known about aspergillus species that are able to adapt an endophytic lifestyle in cupressaceae plant family and are capable of producing cytotoxic, antifungal and  antibacterial metabolites. in this work, we report a possible ecological niche for pathogenic fungi such as aspergillus fumigatus and aspergillus flavus. indeed, our findings indicate that a. fumigatus, a. flavus, aspergillus niger var. niger and a. niger var. awamori adapt an endophytic lifestyle inside the cupressaceous plants including cupressus arizonica, cupressus sempervirens var. fastigiata, cupressus semipervirens var. cereiformis, and thuja orientalis. in addition, we found that extracts of endophytic aspergilli showed significant growth inhibition and cytotoxicity against the model fungus pyricularia oryzae and bacteria such as bacillus sp., erwinia amylovora and pseudomonas syringae. these endophytic aspergilli also showed in vitro antifungal effects on the cypress fungal phytopathogens including diplodia seriata, phaeobotryon cupressi and spencermartinsia viticola. in conclusion, our findings clearly support the endophytic association of aspergilli with cupressaceae plants and their possible  role in protection of host plants against biotic stresses. observed bioactivities of such endophytic aspergilli may represent a significant potential for bioindustry and biocontrol applications.

TI  == antiproliferative, antifungal, and antibacterial activities of endophytic alternaria species from cupressaceae.
AB  == recent research has shown the bioprospecting of endophytic fungi from cupressaceae. here, we further uncover that the healthy cypress plants such as cupressus arizonica, cupressus sempervirens var. cereiformis, and thuja orientalis host highly bioactive endophytic alternaria fungal species. indeed, endophytic alternaria alternata, alternaria pellucida, and alternaria tangelonis  were recovered from healthy cupressaceous trees. biodiversity and bioactivity of  recovered endophytic alternaria species were a matter of biogeography and host identity. we further extracted such alternaria's metabolites and highlighted their significant antiproliferative, growth inhibitory, and antibacterial activities against the model target fungus pyricularia oryzae and the model pathogenic bacteria bacillus sp., erwinia amylovora, and pseudomonas syringae. in vitro assays also indicated that endophytic alternaria species significantly inhibited the growth of cypress fungal phytopathogens diplodia seriata, phaeobotryon cupressi, and spencermartinsia viticola. in conclusion, since the recovered alternaria species were originally reported as pathogenic and allergenic fungi, our findings suggest a possible ecological niche for them inside the foliar tissues of cupressaceous trees. moreover, in this study, the significant bioactivities of endophytic alternaria species in association with cupressaceae plant family are reported.

TI  == autoinduction in erwinia amylovora: evidence of an acyl-homoserine lactone signal in the fire blight pathogen.
AB  == erwinia amylovora causes fire blight disease of apple, pear, and other members of the rosaceae. here we present the first evidence for autoinduction in e. amylovora and a role for an n-acyl-homoserine lactone (ahl)-type signal. two major plant virulence traits, production of extracellular polysaccharides (amylovoran and levan) and tolerance to free oxygen radicals, were controlled in  a bacterial-cell-density-dependent manner. two standard autoinducer biosensors, agrobacterium tumefaciens ntl4 and vibrio harveyi bb886, detected ahl in stationary-phase cultures of e. amylovora. a putative ahl synthase gene, eami, was partially sequenced, which revealed homology with autoinducer genes from other bacterial pathogens (e.g., cari, esai, expi, hsii, yeni, and luxi). e. amylovora was also found to carry eamr, a convergently transcribed gene with homology to luxr ahl activator genes in pathogens such as erwinia carotovora. heterologous expression of the bacillus sp. strain a24 acyl-homoserine lactonase  gene aiia in e. amylovora abolished induction of ahl biosensors, impaired extracellular polysaccharide production and tolerance to hydrogen peroxide, and reduced virulence on apple leaves.
