TI  == cefadroxil in the horse: pharmacokinetics and in vitro antibacterial activity.
AB  == sodium cefadroxil was administered as a single intravenous dose (25 mg/kg) to six healthy adult mares. plasma samples were collected over a 24-h period and cefadroxil concentrations were measured by microbiological assay. the pharmacokinetic behavior of the drug was appropriately described in terms of a one-compartment open model. values for the major pharmacokinetic terms were: extrapolated initial plasma concentration = 59.2 +/- 15.0 micrograms/ml; half-life = 46 +/- 20 min; apparent volume of distribution = 462 +/- 191 ml/kg; and body clearance = 7.0 +/- 0.6 ml/min.kg. in a subsequent study, a suspension of cefadroxil monohydrate was administered intragastrically (25 mg/kg) to the same six horses. plasma concentrations of the drug peaked at 1-2 h but, in general, absorption was both poor and inconsistent. the data were unsuitable for  determination of cefadroxil bioavailability from this oral dosage form. ninety-nine isolates of eleven bacterial species obtained from clinically ill horses were tested for susceptibility to cefadroxil. all strains of streptococcus equi, streptococcus zooepidemicus, coagulase-positive staphylococci, corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis and five out of six strains of actinobacillus  suis were highly susceptible to the drug (mic less than 4 micrograms/ml). escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and salmonella sp. showed intermediate susceptibility (mic 4-16 micrograms/ml), while all isolates of corynebacterium (rhodococcus) equi, enterobacter cloacae and pseudomonas aeruginosa proved to be  highly resistant to cefadroxil (mic greater than 128 micrograms/ml).
