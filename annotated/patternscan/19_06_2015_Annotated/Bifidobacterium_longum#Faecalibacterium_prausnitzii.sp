TI  == specific gut microbiota features and metabolic markers in postmenopausal women with obesity.
AB  == background: gut microbial gene richness and specific bacterial species are associated with metabolic risk markers in humans, but the impact of host physiology and dietary habits on the link between the gut microbiota and metabolic markers remain unclear. the objective of this study was to identify gut metagenomic markers associated with estimates of insulin resistance, lipid metabolism and inflammation in obesity, and to explore whether the associations between metagenomic and metabolic markers persisted after adjustment for body fat, age and habitual dietary intake. methods: faecal dna from 53 women with obesity was analysed through quantitative metagenomic sequencing and analysis, and a systematic search was performed for bacterial genes associated with estimates of insulin resistance, inflammation and lipid metabolism. subsequently, the correlations between metagenomic species and metabolic markers were tested by linear regression models, with and without covariate adjustment. results: one hundred and fourteen metagenomic species correlated with metabolic markers (p<0.001) including akkermansia muciniphila, bilophila wadsworthia, bifidobacterium longum and faecalibacterium prausnitzii, but also species not previously associated with metabolic markers including bacteroides faecis and dorea longicatena. the majority of the identified correlations between bacterial  species and metabolic markers persisted after adjustment for differences in body  fat, age and dietary macronutrient composition; however, the negative correlation with insulin resistance observed for b. longum and f. prausnitzii appeared to be  modified by the intake of dietary fibre and fat, respectively. conclusions: this  study shows that several gut bacterial species are linked to metabolic risk markers in obesity, also after adjustment for potential confounders, such as long-term diet composition. the study supports the use of gut metagenomic markers for metabolic disease prediction and warrants further investigation of causality.

TI  == intestinal microbiota and allergic diseases: a systematic review.
AB  == evidence suggests that possible imbalances in intestinal microbiota composition may be implicated in the occurrence of allergic diseases. although several studies published until 2006 indicated a correlation between microbiota composition and allergic symptoms, it has not been possible to distinguish protective microorganisms from those associated with increased risk of allergic diseases. therefore, the objective of this study was to review the studies published since 2007 that address the intestinal microbiota in allergic diseases. twenty-one studies were identified after excluding those that performed a clinical intervention before stool collection. in the early microbiota of children who later developed allergies, lower bacterial diversity was observed, with a predominance of firmicutes; a higher count of bacteroidaceae; a higher prevalence of the anaerobic bacteria bacteroides fragilis, escherichia coli, clostridium difficile, bifidobacterium catenulatum, bifidobacterium bifidum, and  bifidobacterium longum; and a lower prevalence of bifidobacterium adolescentis, b. bifidum, and lactobacillus. in the microbiota of allergic children whose intestinal microbiota was assessed at the onset of allergic symptoms, there was a higher count of bacteroides; a lower count of akkermansia muciniphila, faecalibacterium prausnitzii, and clostridium; a higher prevalence of b. adolescentis; a lower prevalence of b. catenulatum and staphylococcus aureus; and a lower bacterial diversity.

TI  == faecalibacterium prausnitzii upregulates regulatory t cells and anti-inflammatory cytokines in treating tnbs-induced colitis.
AB  == background and aims: faecalibacterium prausnitzii (f. prausnitzii) is a common anaerobic bacteria colonized in the human gut and inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) patients are usually lack of f. prausnitzii. the aims of this study were to evaluate the anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory capacity of f. prausnitzii by comparing it with bifidobacterium longum (b. longum) in both cellular and animal  experiments. methods: human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) and 2, 4,  6-trinitrobenzenesulphonic acid (tnbs)-induced colitis rat models were treated with f. prausnitzii, b. longum, f. prausnitzii supernatant or f. prausnitzii medium, respectively. interleukin (il)-10, tgf-beta1 and il-12p70 in human pbmcs  culture supernatant and rat blood serum were detected. the frequency of cd25(+)foxp3(+)treg in human pbmcs, rat pbmcs and rat splenocytes were investigated. besides, the t-bet, gata-3, ror-gammat and foxp3 mrna in human pbmcs, histopathologic characteristics of the intestinal mucosal and weight loss  in the rat models were examined. results: f. prausnitzii, b. longum and f. prausnitzii supernatant clearly facilitated the induction of il-10 and tgf-beta1, while induced relatively mild production of il-12p70 in both cellular and animal  models. the f. prausnitzii, b. longum and supernatant differed in their capacity  to induce t-bet, gata-3 and ror-gammat mrna expression in human pbmcs (both bacterial strains inhibited the expression of ror-gammat while supernatant inhibited the t-bet and gata-3). however, all of them induced the foxp3 and treg  production and ameliorated the tnbs-induced colitis. in addition, f. prausnitzii  supernatant exhibited the supreme anti-inflammatory capacity. conclusions: f. prausnitzii and its unidentified metabolites in the supernatant are promising candidates in treating ibd, and further research remains necessary to elucidate the safety, efficacy, optimum and mechanism of this bacterium in the clinical practice.

TI  == effects of a gluten-free diet on gut microbiota and immune function in healthy adult human subjects.
AB  == diet influences the composition of the gut microbiota and host's health, particularly in patients suffering from food-related diseases. coeliac disease (cd) is a permanent intolerance to cereal gluten proteins and the only therapy for the patients is to adhere to a life-long gluten-free diet (gfd). in the present preliminary study, the effects of a gfd on the composition and immune function of the gut microbiota were analysed in ten healthy subjects (mean age 30.3 years) over 1 month. faecal microbiota was analysed by fluorescence in situ  hybridisation (fish) and quantitative pcr (qpcr). the ability of faecal bacteria  to stimulate cytokine production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc) was determined by elisa. no significant differences in dietary intake were found before and after the gfd except for reductions (p = 0.001) in polysaccharides. bifidobacterium, clostridium lituseburense and faecalibacterium prausnitzii proportions decreased (p = 0.007, p = 0.031 and p = 0.009, respectively) as a result of the gfd analysed by fish. bifidobacterium, lactobacillus and bifidobacterium longum counts decreased (p = 0.020, p = 0.001 and p = 0.017, respectively), while enterobacteriaceae and escherichia coli counts increased (p  = 0.005 and p = 0.003) after the gfd assessed by qpcr. tnf-alpha, interferon-gamma, il-10 and il-8 production by pbmc stimulated with faecal samples was also reduced (p = 0.021, p = 0.037, p = 0.002 and p = 0.007, respectively) after the diet. therefore, the gfd led to reductions in beneficial  gut bacteria populations and the ability of faecal samples to stimulate the host's immunity. thus, the gfd may constitute an environmental variable to be considered in treated cd patients for its possible effects on gut health.

TI  == effect of inulin on the human gut microbiota: stimulation of bifidobacterium adolescentis and faecalibacterium prausnitzii.
AB  == prebiotics are food ingredients that improve health by modulating the colonic microbiota. the bifidogenic effect of the prebiotic inulin is well established; however, it remains unclear which species of bifidobacterium are stimulated in vivo and whether bacterial groups other than lactic acid bacteria are affected by inulin consumption. changes in the faecal microbiota composition were examined by real-time pcr in twelve human volunteers after ingestion of inulin (10 g/d) for a 16-d period in comparison with a control period without any supplement intake. the prevalence of most bacterial groups examined did not change after inulin intake, although the low g+c % gram-positive species faecalibacterium prausnitzii exhibited a significant increase (10.3% for control period v. 14.5% during inulin intake, p=0.019). the composition of the genus bifidobacterium was studied in four of the volunteers by clone library analysis. between three and five bifidobacterium spp. were found in each volunteer. bifidobacterium adolescentis and bifidobacterium longum were present in all volunteers, and bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum, bifidobacterium animalis, bifidobacterium bifidum and bifidobacterium dentium were also detected. real-time pcr was employed to quantify the four most prevalent bifidobacterium spp., b. adolescentis, b. longum, b. pseudocatenulatum and b. bifidum, in ten volunteers carrying detectable levels of bifidobacteria. b. adolescentis showed the strongest response to inulin consumption, increasing from 0.89 to 3.9% of the total microbiota (p=0.001). b. bifidum was increased from 0.22 to 0.63% (p<0.001) for the five volunteers for whom this species was present.

TI  == exopolysaccharides produced by intestinal bifidobacterium strains act as fermentable substrates for human intestinal bacteria.
AB  == eleven exopolysaccharides (eps) isolated from different human intestinal bifidobacterium strains were tested in fecal slurry batch cultures and compared with glucose and the prebiotic inulin for their abilities to act as fermentable substrates for intestinal bacteria. during incubation, the increases in levels of short-chain fatty acids (scfa) were considerably more pronounced in cultures with eps, glucose, and inulin than in controls without carbohydrates added, indicating that the substrates assayed were fermented by intestinal bacteria. shifts in molar proportions of scfa during incubation with eps and inulin caused a decrease in the acetic acid-to-propionic acid ratio, a possible indicator of the hypolipidemic effect of prebiotics, with the lowest values for this parameter being obtained for eps from the species bifidobacterium longum and from bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum strain c52. this behavior was contrary to that  found with glucose, a carbohydrate not considered to be a prebiotic and for which a clear increase of this ratio was obtained during incubation. quantitative real-time pcr showed that eps exerted a moderate bifidogenic effect, which was comparable to that of inulin for some polymers but which was lower than that found for glucose. pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of 16s rrna gene fragments using universal primers was employed to analyze microbial groups other  than bifidobacteria. changes in banding patterns during incubation with eps indicated microbial rearrangements of bacteroides and escherichia coli relatives. moreover, the use of eps from b. pseudocatenulatum in fecal cultures from some individuals accounted for the prevalence of desulfovibrio and faecalibacterium prausnitzii, whereas incubation with eps from b. longum supported populations close to anaerostipes, prevotella, and/or oscillospira. thus, eps synthesized by  intestinal bifidobacteria could act as fermentable substrates for microorganisms  in the human gut environment, modifying interactions among intestinal populations.

TI  == influence of bifidobacterium longum bb536 intake on faecal microbiota in individuals with japanese cedar pollinosis during the pollen season.
AB  == it has been reported that intake of yogurt or powder supplemented with the bifidobacterium longum bb536 probiotic strain alleviated subjective symptoms and  affected blood markers of allergy in individuals with japanese cedar pollinosis (jcpsis) during the pollen seasons of 2004 and 2005, based on randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. furthermore, the 2004 study found that intestinal bacteria such as the bacteroides fragilis group significantly fluctuated during the pollen season in jcpsis individuals and intake of bb536 yogurt tended to suppress these fluctuations. the present study investigated faecal microbiota to examine whether any changes occurred during the pollen season and whether any influence was exerted by intake of bb536 powder in the 2005 pollen season, which happened to be a heavy season, to confirm the 2004 findings and to evaluate the relationship of microbiota with symptom development. in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 44 jcpsis subjects received bb536 or a placebo for 13 weeks during the pollen season. another 14 japanese cedar pollen (jcp)-specific ige negative healthy subjects received placebo for the same period. faecal samples were collected before (week 0), during (weeks 4, 8 and 13) and after (week 17) intervention, and out of jcp season (week 28). faecal microbiota were analysed using terminal-rflp (t-rflp) and real-time pcr methods. principal component analysis based on t-rflp indicated distinct patterns of microbiota between healthy subjects and jcpsis subjects in the placebo group, but an intermediate pattern in the bb536 group at week 13, the last stage of the pollen season. the coordinate of principal component 1 at week  13 correlated with composite scores of jcpsis symptoms recorded during the pollen season. faecalibacterium prausnitzii and the bacteroides fragilis group were identified as the main contributors to microbiotal fluctuations. real-time pcr indicated that bb536 intake suppressed increases in the bacteroides fragilis group compared with the placebo group (p <0.05). these results suggest that faecal microbiota in jcpsis subjects, but not healthy subjects, fluctuate at the  end of the pollen season and that bb536 intake plays a role in maintaining normal microbiota.
