TI  == meningococcal septic shock after iud insertion, a case presentation.
AB  == neisseria meningitidis is a normal commensal of human mucous membranes that is no longer considered to be restricted to the nasopharynx. due to the practice of oral sex, the mucous membranes of the cervix, urethra or anus have become a potential infection site for this bacterium. inserting an intrauterine device (iud), can alter the protective barrier of the endocervical mucosa, allowing for  bacterial infection and systemic spread. we present a case report of a 40-year-old woman who presented with abdominal pain, spotting and fever after inserting an iud and developed a fulminant septic shock. blood cultures and cultures from ascites showed the presence of neisseria meningitidis group y. from our knowledge, there are a few cases presented in the literature of toxic shock syndrome after iud insertion, caused by staphylococcus aureus or streptococcus group a, but this is the first case of meningococcal sepsis after iud insertion described. so, even though iuds rarely cause significant infection, physicians should consider this device as a possible source in reproductive-age women with the clinical features of sepsis.

TI  == evaluation of the nanosphere verigene gram-positive blood culture assay with the  versatrek blood culture system and assessment of possible impact on selected patients.
AB  == the verigene gram-positive blood culture (bc-gp) assay (nanosphere, northbrook, il) is a molecular method for the rapid identification of gram-positive organisms and resistance markers directly from blood culture bottles. a total of 148 versatrek redox 1 40-ml aerobic bottles demonstrating gram-positive bacteria were tested. results were compared with those from conventional biochemical and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (maldi-tof) identifications. we obtained isolates of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) (24), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa) (14), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis (mrse) (17), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus epidermidis (msse) (9), other coagulase-negative staphylococci (19), streptococcus salivarius (5), streptococcus parasanguinis (2), streptococcus sanguinis (1), streptococcus cristatus (1), the streptococcus bovis group (5), streptococcus agalactiae (9), the streptococcus anginosus group (1), streptococcus pneumoniae (6), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vre fcm) (16), vancomycin-susceptible  enterococcus faecalis (3), aerococcus viridans (2), bacillus (6), corynebacterium (8), lactobacillus (2), micrococcus (2), neisseria mucosa (1), escherichia coli (3), candida tropicalis (1), propionibacterium (1), and rothia (1). overall agreement with the culture results was 95%. a total of 137 of 138 (99%) monomicrobial cultures were concordant. we tested 9 polymicrobial samples and found 33% agreement. a chart review of 31 patients with mrsa, mssa, or vre demonstrated that the nanosphere bc-gp assay might have led to more appropriate antibiotic selection for these patients an average of 42 h earlier. additionally, contact isolation could have been initiated an average of 37 h earlier for patients with mrsa or vre. the bc-gp assay may have a positive impact on patient  care, health care costs, and antibiotic stewardship.

TI  == enterococcus faecalis inhibits superantigen toxic shock syndrome toxin-1-induced  interleukin-8 from human vaginal epithelial cells through tetramic acids.
AB  == the vaginal mucosa can be colonized by many bacteria including commensal organisms and potential pathogens, such as staphylococcus aureus. some strains of s. aureus produce the superantigen toxic shock syndrome toxin-1, which can penetrate the vaginal epithelium to cause toxic shock syndrome. we have observed  that a female was mono-colonized with enterococcus faecalis vaginally as tested in aerobic culture, even upon repeated culture for six months, suggesting this organism was negatively influencing colonization by other bacteria. in recent studies, we demonstrated an "outside-in" mechanism of cytokine signaling and consequent inflammation that facilitates the ability of potential pathogens to initiate infection from mucosal surfaces. thus, we hypothesized that this strain  of e. faecalis may make anti-inflammatory factors which block disease progression of more pathogenic organisms. e. faecalis mn1 inhibited interleukin-8 production  from human vaginal epithelial cells in response to the vaginal pathogens candida  albicans, gardnerella vaginalis, and neisseria gonorrhoeae, as well as to toxic shock syndrome toxin-1. we further demonstrated that this organism secretes two tetramic acid compounds which appear responsible for inhibition of interleukin-8  production, as well as inhibition of t cell proliferation due to toxic shock syndrome toxin-1. microbicides that include anti-inflammatory molecules, such as  these tetramic acid compounds naturally produced by e. faecalis mn1, may be useful in prevention of diseases that develop from vaginal infections.

TI  == epithelial control of the human pdc response to extracellular bacteria.
AB  == plasmacytoid pre-dendritic cells (pdcs) are specialized in responding to nucleic  acids, and link innate with adaptive immunity. although the response of pdcs to viruses is well established, whether pdcs can respond to extracellular bacteria remains controversial. here, we demonstrate that extracellular bacteria such as neisseria meningitidis, haemophilus influenzae, and staphylococcus aureus activate pdcs to produce ifn-alpha, tnf-alpha, il-6, and to upregulate cd86 expression. we observed that pdcs were present within tonsillar crypts and oro-nasopharyngeal epithelium, where they may contact extracellular bacteria, in  situ. tonsil epithelium-conditioned supernatants inhibited ifn-alpha, tnf-alpha,  and il-6 triggered by the direct contact of n. meningitidis or s. aureus with pdcs. however, pdc priming of naive t cells was not affected, suggesting that tonsil epithelium micro-environment limits local inflammation while preserving adaptive immunity in response to extracellular bacteria. our results reveal an important and novel function of pdcs in the initiation of the mucosal innate and  adaptive immunity to extracellular bacteria.

TI  == bacterial adhesion on the titanium and zirconia abutment surfaces.
AB  == objective: microorganisms harboring the oral cavity, mainly those related to periodontal diseases, are the most potential etiologic factor of failure in long-term implant treatment. the material used for abutment components may influence the adhesion and colonization of microbial species. the aim of this in  vivo investigation was to evaluate the biofilm formation on machined (mpt) or cast titanium (cpt) and zirconia abutments (zc). methods: six healthy subjects were enrolled in this randomized crossover clinical investigation. the study was  conducted in three phases according to abutment surface evaluated. each subject used an individual oral splint containing four disks of the same tested substrate, two located in the anterior and two in the posterior region, totalizing 12 specimens for subject. participants were asked to use the removable intraoral splint during 24 h. dna checkerboard hybridization method was used to identify and quantify 38 bacterial species colonizing formed biofilm on the abutment substrates. results: pathogens and non-pathogens species were found colonizing the three substrates surfaces. fusobacterium nucleatum, neisseria mucosa, porphyromonas aeruginosa, peptostreptococcus anaerobios, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus parasanguinis, and tanerella forsythia were the only species with no significant differences over the tested materials (p > 0.05). all the other target species presented significant differences sought by friedman test (p < 0.0001). conclusions: there was a significant difference in the total bacterial count between the three groups. cpt presented the higher mean counts, followed by mpt and zc. cpt group also showed a higher mean incidence of species than mpt and zc. the anterior or posterior region of disks placement did not show significant differences in relation to bacterial adhesion.

TI  == periodontal status of patients with dentin dysplasia type i: report of three cases within a family.
AB  == background: dentin dysplasia type i (ddi) is a rare hereditary disturbance of dentin formation. it is characterized by clinically normal-appearing crowns; obliteration of pulp chambers; and short, blunted and malformed roots that are commonly associated with periodontal attachment loss (pal). in this context, we report three cases within a family with similar clinical and radiographic features of ddi but with differing microbiologic and periodontal conditions. methods: a 42-year-old white female and her two daughters (25 and 10 years of age) presented with a diagnosis of ddi. probing depth (pd), clinical attachment level (cal), visible plaque, and bleeding on probing (bop) were recorded. subgingival biofilm samples were randomly collected and analyzed by checkerboard  dna-dna hybridization. results: the mother presented 34.9% of sites with pd > or  =4 mm, 41.3% of sites with cal > or =4 mm, and 57% of sites with bop; both daughters presented no sites with pd or cal >3 mm and <10% of sites with bop. microbiologic analysis detected gemella morbillorum, neisseria mucosa, and staphylococcus aureus in > or =50% of the mother's samples. the daughters showed  high levels (>10(4) bacterial cells) of some periodontopathic bacteria, including members of the red (porphyromonas gingivalis) and orange (fusobacterium periodonticum and f. nucleatum polymorphum) complexes and beneficial species of the yellow (streptococcus gordonii) and purple (veillonella parvula) complexes. the mother presented high mean levels only for four tested species (n. mucosa, prevotella melaninogenica, treponema denticola, and v. parvula). conclusion: a combination of radiographs, microbiologic analysis, and preventive professional monitoring care is important to avoid pal and to provide oral health in patients  with ddi.

TI  == nasal carriage of pathogenic bacteria in medical students: effects of clinic exposure on prevalence and antibiotic susceptibility.
AB  == staphylococcus aureus is a major cause of community-acquired and nosocomial infections worldwide. one important source of this pathogen for nosocomial infections is the nasal carriage of s. aureus among hospital personnel. there are only a few studies investigating the carriage of s. aureus in a community of medical students. oral and nasal flora of 179 medical students with varying clinical exposures were determined. oral cultures revealed no nosocomial pathogen and nasal cultures showed an increasing rate of s. aureus carriage with increasing clinical exposure. methicillin resistance also demonstrated a tendency toward increasing with increasing clinical exposure.

TI  == nasopharyngeal aerobic bacterial flora and staphylococcus aureus nasal carriage in deaf children.
AB  == objective: to determine the nasopharyngeal aerobic bacterial flora and staphylococcus aureus nasal carriage in deaf children and the role of flora in deafness. study design: a prospective, controlled study. methods: nasopharyngeal  and nasal swabs were collected from 87 deaf children with acquired etiology at zonguldak primary school for the deaf and 56 healthy children. the children with  genetic base (syndromic or nonsyndromic, familial or sporadic, ad, ar or x-linked recessive), and also with the history of drug exposure, head trauma, birth trauma, prematurity, hyperbilirubinemia and the viral diseases with high fever (like mumps and measles) were excluded from the study. swabs were inoculated on to a variety of bacteriological culture media, which were then incubated in an appropriate atmosphere. colonisation of group a beta hemolytic streptococcus, streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria menengitidis, moraxella catarrhalis and s. aureus in upper respiratory tract were investigated. antimicrobial susceptibility testing of the isolates were determined according to national committee for clinical laboratory standards (nccls) guidelines. results: although, the rates of colonization of the nasopharyngeal aerobic bacteria and nasal s. aureus did not differ significantly between deaf children and normal healthy subjects, less colonization rates were found in deaf children than normal healthy subjects. s. aureus was isolated from 18 (20.7%) deaf children. all s. aureus isolates from deaf children were susceptible to oxacillin. penicillin susceptibility rate was 22.2%. conclusion: it is considered that nasopharyngeal and nasal colonizations of deaf children with potentially pathogenic aerobic bacterial flora is not a significant risk factor for acquired infections when compared with healthy children.

AB  == a 66 year old patient presented with a nine month history of recurrent oral ulcerations involving the tongue. we diagnosed chancriform pyoderma and a previously not identified multiple myeloma with secondary immunoglobulin deficiency. clinically and histologically we excluded a necrotizing ulcerative stomatitis as found in individuals with cellular immunodeficiency as in late-stage hiv-infection. on culture only neisseria catarrhalis was found. chancriform pyoderma is often associated with local bacterial infections, especially staphylococcus aureus. the most common sites are the genitalia and periorbital region; involvement of the oral mucosa is uncommon. to the best of our knowledge, this is the fourth reported case with tongue lesions. the multiple myeloma-associated immunoglobulin deficiency might have facilitated the oral manifestations of chancriform pyoderma.

TI  == the effect of cigarette smoke on adherence of respiratory pathogens to buccal epithelial cells.
AB  == smoking is associated with an increased risk of respiratory tract infection in adults. in children, exposure to cigarette smoke is a risk factor for respiratory tract infection and bacterial meningitis: active smoking and passive exposure to  cigarette smoke is also associated with carriage of some potentially pathogenic species of bacteria in both adults and children. the aims of the study were to determine the effect of active smoking on: (1) bacterial binding to epithelial cells; (2) expression of host cell antigens that act as receptors for some species; and (3) the effects of passive exposure to water-soluble components of cigarette smoke on bacterial binding. flow cytometry was used to assess binding to buccal epithelial cells of the following species labelled with fluorescein isothiocyanate: neisseria meningitidis, neisseria lactamica, streptococcus pneumoniae, bordetella pertussis, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis,  staphylococcus aureus. flow cytometry was also used to assess expression of host  cell antigens which have been identified as bacterial receptors. for each species, binding to cells of smokers was significantly higher than to cells of non-smokers; however, expression of host cell antigens was similar on epithelial  cells of both groups. non-dilute cigarette smoke extract reduced binding of bacteria to epithelial cells, but dilutions between 1 in 10 and 1 in 320 enhanced binding. we conclude that smokers might be more densely colonised by a variety of potentially pathogenic bacteria. the enhanced bacterial binding to epithelial cells of smokers is not related to enhanced expression of host cell antigens that can act as receptors for some species, but possibly to components in the smoke that alter charge or other properties of the epithelial cell surface. passive coating of mucosal surfaces with components of cigarette smoke might enhance binding of potentially pathogenic bacteria.

TI  == levels of rifampin and ciprofloxacin in nasal secretions: correlation with mic90  and eradication of nasopharyngeal carriage of bacteria.
AB  == to predict the efficacy of antibiotics in eliminating nasopharyngeal carriage of  organisms such as neisseria meningitidis, haemophilus influenzae, and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), a novel approach for measuring drug concentrations in nasal secretions was developed. five healthy individuals received four doses of rifampin and then, at a later date, ciprofloxacin. at 2, 5, and 8 h after the last dose, serum, saliva, and cold-stimulated nasal secretion samples were collected, and drug levels were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography. nasopharyngeal levels of rifampin reached but did not substantially exceed 90% of the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic90) for h. influenzae, exceeded the mic90 for n. meningitidis,  and were well above that for mrsa. ciprofloxacin levels in nasal secretions far exceeded the mic90 for meningococci and haemophilus organisms but were below that for mrsa. these findings are consistent with the clinical studies showing that rifampin eliminates, in most instances, the nasal carriage of n. meningitidis and to a lesser extent h. influenzae. a single dose of ciprofloxacin has been shown to eradicate meningococci, yet a long course of treatment with this drug is not adequate for mrsa. on the basis of these results, clinical trials with ciprofloxacin to eliminate nasopharyngeal carriage of h. influenzae appear to be  warranted.

TI  == focal vulvitis: a characteristic syndrome and cause of dyspareunia. features, natural history, and management.
AB  == based on the study of 67 affected women during a period of 15 years, we report the clinical features and natural history of focal vulvitis, a unique syndrome characterized by severe and persistent superficial dyspareunia and the presence of one to 11 (median three) minute, exquisitely tender areas of focal inflammation or ulceration on the mucosa of the vestibule. three fourths of all lesions occur around the bartholin gland ducts or between them posteriorly. histopathologic study of tissues from seven patients has not shown a characteristic pattern of inflammation and fails to confirm a reported association between these lesions and the minor vestibular glands. these histologic studies and an in-depth clinical and epidemiologic investigation in nine patients, including microbiologic studies to identify infection by herpes simplex virus. neisseria gonorrhoeae, staphylococcus aureus, beta-hemolytic streptococci, chlamydia trachomatis, mycoplasmas, candida sp., trichomonads, or mycobacterium sp., have not established an infectious etiology for this syndrome  or evidence that it represents an unusual form of an autoimmune disease or behcet's syndrome. treatment with topical antimicrobial or corticosteroid creams, antibiotics given systemically, or cryotherapy has not been of demonstrable benefit. approximately one half of patients eventually experience spontaneous remission but many appear to remain symptomatic indefinitely. surgical excision of the hymenal ring and contiguous mucosa of the vestibule has brought relief and permitted resumption of sexual activity in seven of eight treated patients. while promising, operation should be reserved for patients who have experienced unremitting dyspareunia associated with the characteristic focal inflammatory lesions for at least 6 months.
