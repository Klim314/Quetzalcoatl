TI  == spirotetronate antibiotics with anti-clostridium activity from actinomadura sp. 2eps.
AB  == the rare actinomycetes strain 2eps was isolated from soil and analysis of cultural, morphological characteristics, diaminopimelic acid content of its cell  wall, and 16s rrna gene sequence indicates that 2eps belongs to genus actinomadura. in addition, neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree also confirmed the  relationships of this strain to other members of actinomadura. a butanol extract  with antibacterial activity was purified by reversed-phase chromatography to obtain three bioactive compounds, designated as compounds 1, 2 and 3. the structures of these compounds were determined using spectroscopic analysis ((1)h-nmr and (13)c-nmr) and mass spectrometric analysis (hr-tof-ms). compounds 1-3 were identified and found to be the same as those included in the japanese patent number jp 09227587 for spirotetronate antibiotics and are be-45722a (1), be-45722b (2) and be-45722c (3), respectively. all compounds were active against  gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923, bacillus cereus atcc 14579, and b. subtilis atcc 6633) with low mic values between 0.08 and 5.0 microg/ml. moreover, both 1 and 3 also exhibited strong activity, with similar mic values, against clostridium perfringens s107 at 0.63 microg/ml and c. difficile 630 at 0.08 microg/ml. these results suggest the identified spirotetronate compounds may have potential in the treatment of clostridium infections. overall, this analysis demonstrates that rare actinomycetes are a promising source for discovery of antimicrobial compounds.

TI  == the influence of fat and monoacylglycerols on growth of spore-forming bacteria in processed cheese.
AB  == highly undesirable microbial contaminants of processed cheese are endospore-forming bacteria of the genera bacillus and clostridium. survival of bacillus subtilis, b. cereus, clostridium butyricum and c. sporogenes was examined in model processed cheese samples supplemented with monoacylglycerols. in processed cheese samples, monoacylglycerols of undecanoic, undecenoic, lauric  and adamantane-1-carboxylic acid at concentration of 0.15% w/w prevented the growth and multiplication of both bacillus species throughout the storage period. the two species of clostridium were less affected by monoacylglycerols in processed cheese samples and only partial inhibition was observed. the effect of  milk fat content on microbial survival in processed cheese was also evaluated. the growth of bacillus sp. was affected by the fat level of processed cheese while population levels of clostridium sp. did not differ in processed cheese samples with 30, 40 and 50% fat in dry matter.

TI  == hygienic quality and antibiotic resistance profile of sliced butchery.
AB  == in order to investigate the microbiological quality of different meat products on the greek market, 200 samples were collected from the following preparations: boiled turkey (n=50), boiled pork ham (n=50), smoked turkey (n=50) and smoked pork ham (n=50). in all cold meat preparations clostridium perfringens vegetative and spore forms, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli and other clostridium sp lec(-), as well as lactobacillus, bacillus sp. and salmonella sp. were recovered. for instance bacillus cereus was present in 6% of the samples. l. monocytogenes,  campylobacter jejuni and campylobacter coli were rarely present (1-4%) while yersinia enterocolitica and campylobacter lari were absent. differences in the occurrence of s. aureus, salmonella sp., e. coli and spore forms of c. perfringens in boiled and smoked samples, reflects either the differences in the  processing of the foods or could be associated to the extensive handling by the personnel during the purchasing (storage, slicing, wrapping). antibiotic resistance on specific antibiotics for each pathogen was also studied. a multiresistance antibiotic profile was effective for most bacterial strains, and  pronounced resistance profiles were observed for the commonly used antibiotics as ampicillin, penicillin, cephalothin, streptomycin followed by ceftriaxone and gentamycin. albeit this high observed resistance profile, the tested strains generally conserved their susceptibility to amikacin, aztreonam, chloramphenicol  and tylosin conserved an almost absent resistance. antibiotics commonly used for  therapeutic purposes, as well as antibiotics added to feed stuff of animals for increasing animal flesh production should contribute to the extensive spreading of antibiotic resistance in food and the environment. systematically monitoring of the microbiological quality of cold butchery preparations must be done, in order to preserve food quality, optimizing the processing and elaboration methods of the product and safeguard the public health.

TI  == effect of high pressure on the microbiological quality of cooked chicken during storage at normal and abuse refrigeration temperatures.
AB  == vacuum-packaged cooked poultry meat was treated at a range of pressures (400-600  mpa) and hold times (1, 2 and 10 min), followed by storage at 4 degrees , 8 degrees or 12 degrees c for up to 35 days. weissella viridescens was found to be  the dominant microorganism in the pressure-treated meat, constituting 100% of the microflora identified at 500 and 600 mpa. none of the pressure-treated samples had obvious signs of spoilage during the 35 day storage period, even when the weissella count was >7 log(10) cfu/g. studies on a typical w. viridescens isolate showed it to be relatively pressure-resistant in poultry meat, with <1 log reduction in numbers after a treatment of 2 min at 600 mpa. agar diffusion assays showed that the isolate also caused the inhibition of a number of gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens, including strains of clostridium botulinum, listeria monocytogenes, bacillus cereus and escherichia coli. the selection of a pressure-resistant organism, such as this weissella sp. could be advantageous in  extending the shelf-life, and also microbiological safety, of the cooked meat, as it could give protection in addition to the pressure treatment itself.

TI  == detection of bacterial dna in latin american patients with reactive arthritis by  polymerase chain reaction and sequencing analysis.
AB  == objective: bacteria and/or their antigens are thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of reactive arthritis (rea). polymerase chain reaction (pcr) using the 16s ribosomal rna-pcr method was used to identify bacterial dna in synovial fluid (sf) and tissue (st) in a well defined group of patients with chronic rea.  in addition, species found were identified by means of sequence analysis. methods: we examined 15 st and 5 sf samples of 15 patients with rea, 5 st samples of 5 patients with osteoarthritis (oa), and 8 sf from 8 patients with closed traumatic knee injuries using a nested pcr with universal 16s rrna primers. in addition, a nested pcr was developed to detect dna sequences of salmonella sp. and mycoplasma sp. automated sequencing and comparative data analysis (genbank) were also performed to identify the species. results: bacterial dna was identified in 8 cases, 5 st and 3 sf; chlamydia trachomatis (n = 2), pseudomonas  sp. (n = 3), and bacillus cereus (n = 2) were the most common microorganisms identified. a variety of microorganisms including clostridium sp., lactobacillus  sp., pseudomonas migulae, p. fluorescens, and p. putida, and neisseria meningitidis serogroup b were also identified. in half of the cases (4/8) 2 to 3  bacterial antigens were identified simultaneously. conclusion: bacterial dna is present in the joints in patients with chronic rea. a wide spectrum of bacteria including some not previously associated with rea were identified. further studies are needed to establish their exact role in the pathogenesis of rea and related arthritides.

TI  == bacterial spore inhibition and inactivation in foods by pressure, chemical preservatives, and mild heat.
AB  == sucrose laurates, sucrose palmitate, sucrose stearates, and monolaurin (lauricidin) were evaluated for inhibitory effects against spores of bacillus sp., clostridium sporogenes pa3679, and alicyclobacillus sp. in a model agar system. the combined treatment of sucrose laurate, high hydrostatic pressure, and mild heat was evaluated on spores of bacillus and alicyclobacillus in foods. the  minimum inhibitory concentrations of the sucrose esters were higher than that of  lauricidin for all spores tested in the model agar system, but lauricidin was not the most readily suspended in the test media. the sucrose laurates and sucrose palmitate were more effective and more readily suspended than the sucrose stearates. a combined treatment of sucrose laurate (<1.0%), 392 megapascals (mpa) at 45 degrees c for 10 to 15 min provided 3- to 5.5-log10 cfu/ml reductions from  initial populations of 10(6) cfu/ml for bacillus subtilis 168 in milk, bacillus cereus 14579 in beef, bacillus coagulans 7050 in tomato juice (ph 4.5), alicyclobacillus sp. n1089 in tomato juice (ph 4.5), and alicyclobacillus sp. n1098 in apple juice. the most notable change in the appearance of the products was temporary foaming during mixing of the sucrose laurate in the foods. the effect of sucrose laurate appeared to be inhibitory rather than lethal to the spores. the inhibitory effects observed on bacillus and alicyclobacillus spores by the combined treatment of pressure, mild heat, and sucrose laurate appear promising for food applications where alternatives to high heat processing are desired.

TI  == [development from actions of bacterial phospholipases c on eucaryotic plasma membranes to molecular biology of gpi-anchored proteins].
AB  == bacterial phospholipases c are known to act on biomembranes, since they can cleave the phosphodiester linkage between the polar head and the hydrophobic moiety of each phospholipid in these membranes. these enzymes have been classified into three groups; phosphatidylcholine (pc)-, sphingomyelin (sm)- and  phosphatidylinositol (pi)-degrading phospholipases c. enzymatic properties and toxicities of these phospholipases c are reviewed, in relation to author's research. studies on the hemolytic phospholipases of clostridium sp., bacillus cereus etc., revealed that hydrolysis of choline-containing phospholipids such as pc and sm was responsible for the hemolysis of mammalian erythrocytes by these enzymes in the presence of ca2+ and/or mg2+. also, the studies on a structure-activity correlation of sm-hydrolyzing phospholipase c from b. cereus disclosed the similarity of active sites between this enzyme and bovine pancreatic dnase i. by action of pi-degrading phospholipases c, several membrane  proteins such as alkaline phosphatase, 5'-nucleotidase, vsg (protozoal surface glycoprotein) etc., were shown to be released from the plasma membranes of eucaryotic cells. from structural analysis, these proteins have been revealed to  be glycosylphosphatidylinositol (gpi)-anchored proteins bound to the plasma membranes with carboxyl terminal-attached glycolipid. biochemistry and molecular  biology of gpi-anchored proteins, including the structures and biosynthetic routes of gpi glycolipids as well as the process of gpi attachment to proteins, requirements of c-terminal signal peptide for the protein modification by gpi, and distribution of gpi-anchored proteins in living world, are described in relation to our studies.

TI  == characterization, production, and purification of leucocin h, a two-peptide bacteriocin from leuconostoc mf215b.
AB  == leuconostoc mf215b was found to produce a two-peptide bacteriocin referred to as  leucocin h. the two peptides were termed leucocin halpha and leucocin hbeta. when acting together, they inhibit, among others, listeria monocytogenes, bacillus cereus, and clostridium perfringens. production of leucocin h in growth medium takes place at temperatures down to 6 degrees c and at ph below 7. the highest activity of leucocin h in growth medium was demonstrated in the late exponential  growth phase. the bacteriocin was purified by precipitation with ammonium sulfate, ion-exchange (sp sepharose) and reverse phase chromatography. upon purification, specific activity increased 10(5)-fold, and the final specific activity was 2 x 10(7) bu/od280. amino acid composition analyses of leucocin halpha and leucocin hbeta indicated that both peptides consisted of around 40 amino acid residues. their n-termini were blocked for edman degradation, and the  methionin residues of leucocin hbeta did not respond to cyanogen bromide (cnbr) cleavage. absorbance at 280 nm indicated the presence of tryptophan residues and  tryptophan-fracturing opened for partial sequencing by edman degradation. from leucocin halpha, the sequence of 20 amino acids was obtained; from leucocin hbeta the sequence of 28 amino acid residues was obtained. no sequence homology to other known bacteriocins could be demonstrated. it also appeared that the two peptides themselves shared little or no sequence homology. the presence of soy oil did not affect the activity of leucocin h in agar.

TI  == studying the effect of temperature on microbial growth using multiplicative model.
AB  == the specific growth rates of brochothrix thermosphacta, listeria monocytogenes, yersinia enterocolitica, bacillus cereus, escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella spp., staphylococcus aureus and clostridium perfringens at various temperatures were taken from the food micromodel database, and the data sets of specific growth rate versus temperature were fitted using the multiplicative model (r = a  td, r = specific growth rate; t = temperature; a, d = regression parameters). the exponential d-value derived from microbial growth at suboptimum temperatures reflected the effectiveness of temperature in enhancing growth. a microorganism with a large d-value exhibited a large increment of growth rate as temperature increased. the d-value of a microorganism was related to the temperature range for growth. the temperature range for the growth of psychrotrophs was usually narrow for b. thermosphacta and y. enterocolitica; hence the d-values of these two psychrotrophs were close to 1 whereas d-values of mesophiles, such as b. cereus, e. coli o157:h7, salmonella spp., and s. aureus, were 2.31-2.90, and the  d-value of c. perfringens, a thermophile, was 3.29. the values of parameter a of  the model were affected by extra salt added into cultures. for all the strains mentioned above, the a-values decreased when the cultures contained higher levels of salt. the lowering of the a-value implied that the influence of temperature on the growth rate in the model was reduced. the change of the d-value was dependent on the capability of the microorganism to overcome the obstacle to growth and was affected by the composition of the nutrients and by inhibitory factors in the culture. the influence of environmental factors on the d-value was also found in  chinese sausages. the d-value of a dominant spoilage strain of enterococcus sp. derived from sausages was 0.833 whereas the d-value derived from mrs cultures was 2.36. in refrigerated foods which usually contained some preservatives and were stored at low temperature, the d-value of psychrotrophic spoilage bacteria was around 1. in this case, the linear model could be a reasonable choice for predicting the proliferation of spoilage bacteria.

TI  == risk factors for outbreaks of infectious intestinal disease linked to domestic catering.
AB  == the epidemiology of general outbreaks of infectious intestinal disease associated with domestic catering for large numbers is described and compared with foodborne outbreaks in other settings. from 1 january 1992 to 31 december 1994, the phls communicable disease surveillance centre identified 101 foodborne general outbreaks of infectious intestinal disease associated with domestic catering in england and wales (16% of all foodborne outbreaks). salmonella species were associated with 77 of the 101 outbreaks and s. enteriditis phage type 4 accounted for 57. small round structured viruses were implicated in five outbreaks, clostridium perfringens in four, bacillus cereus in two, and campylobacter sp and escherichia coli in one each. no pathogen was identified in 11 outbreaks. outbreaks occurred most commonly in summer. the commonest vehicles implicated were poultry/eggs in 44 outbreaks, desserts in 13, and meat/meat products in nine. salad/vegetables, sauces, and fish/shellfish were each implicated in eight  outbreaks. raw shell eggs were implicated in a fifth of outbreaks. inappropriate  storage was the commonest fault, reported in association with 50 outbreaks (ambient temperature for long periods before serving in 29), inadequate heat treatment was reported in 35, cross contamination in 28, an infected food handler in 11, and other faults in 14. outbreaks associated with catering on domestic premises were independently more likely than outbreaks in other settings to be associated with salmonellas, inappropriate storage of food, and consumption of poultry, eggs, or sauces. public health services need to direct messages about the use, preparation, and storage of food to those who cater on domestic premises.

AB  == cell walls from various gram-positive bacteria were incorporated at a concentration of 0.2% (w/v) into polyacrylamide gels as a substrate for detection of cell wall hydrolases. bacterial extracts from crude cell wall preparations were denatured with sodium dodecyl sulfate and 2-mercaptoethanol and subjected to denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in gels containing bacterial cell walls. after renaturation in the presence of purified and buffered 1% (v/v) triton x-100, cell wall hydrolases were visualized as clear lytic zones against the opaque cell wall background. one to fifteen bands with lytic activity could be detected, depending on bacterial extracts and on the nature of the cell walls  incorporated into gels. crude cell wall extracts were the best source of cell wall hydrolases from various gram-positive bacteria such as clostridium perfringens (15 bands), micrococcus luteus (1 band), bacillus megaterium (4 bands), bacillus sp. (6 bands), b. cereus (3 bands), b. subtilis (7 bands), staphylococcus aureus (13 bands), streptococcus faecalis (3 bands), and strep. pyogenes (5 bands). molecular masses of cell wall hydrolases ranged from 17 to 114.6 kda. lytic activities against cell walls of corynebacterium sepedonicum (clavibacter michiganense pv. sepedonicum) could be shown with the cell wall extracts of strep. pyogenes (45.7 kda), strep. faecalis (67 kda), b. megaterium (67 kda), and staph. aureus (67 kda).
