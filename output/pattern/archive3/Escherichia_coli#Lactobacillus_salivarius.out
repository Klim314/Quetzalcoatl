soluble products of escherichia coli induce mitochondrial dysfunction-related sperm membrane lipid peroxidation which is prevented by lactobacilli.
unidentified soluble factors secreted by e. coli, a frequently isolated microorganism in genitourinary infections, have been reported to inhibit mitochondrial membrane potential (deltapsim), motility and vitality of human spermatozoa. here we explore the mechanisms involved in the adverse impact of e. coli on sperm motility, focusing mainly on sperm mitochondrial function and possible membrane damage induced by mitochondrial-generated reactive oxygen species (ros). furthermore, as lactobacilli, which dominate the vaginal ecosystem of healthy women, have been shown to exert anti-oxidant protective effects on spermatozoa, we also evaluated whether soluble products from these microorganisms could protect spermatozoa against the effects of e. coli. we assessed motility (by computer-aided semen analysis), deltapsim (with jc-1 dye by flow cytometry), mitochondrial ros generation (with mitosox red dye by flow cytometry) and membrane lipid-peroxidation (with the fluorophore bodipy c11 by flow cytometry) of sperm suspensions exposed to e. coli in the presence and in the absence of a combination of 3 selected strains of lactobacilli (l. brevis, l. salivarius, l. plantarum). a transwell system was used to avoid direct contact between spermatozoa and microorganisms. soluble products of e. coli induced deltapsim loss, mitochondrial generation of ros and membrane lipid-peroxidation, resulting in motility loss. soluble factors of lactobacilli prevented membrane lipid-peroxidation of e. coli-exposed spermatozoa, thus preserving their motility. in conclusion, sperm motility loss by soluble products of e. coli reflects a mitochondrial dysfunction-related membrane lipid-peroxidation. lactobacilli could protect spermatozoa in the presence of vaginal disorders, by preventing ros-induced membrane damage.
in vitro evaluation of the safety and probiotic properties of lactobacilli isolated from chicken and calves.
a total of 73 chicken and calves isolates were diagnosed using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms). after a preliminary subtractive screening based on the high acid tolerance at ph 2.5 and bile resistance at 0.3% oxgall, twenty isolates belonging to the species lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus agilis, lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus murinus and lactobacillus amylovorus were in vitro screened for the safety assessment and probiotic properties, including antibiotics susceptibility patterns, biochemical activity and potential for competitive exclusion of biofilm producing pathogens determined by crystal violet and/or quantitative fluorescent in situ hybridisation (fish) assays utilizing 5'cy 3 labelled probe enter1432 for enteric group. antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed according to the iso norm 10932. the sixteen strains were susceptible to certain antimicrobial agents, except for two chicken (l. salivarius 12k, l. agilis 13k) and two calves (l. reuteri l10/1, l. murinus l9) isolates with the presence non wild-type ecoffs (epidemiological cut-off) for gentamicin (>/=256 mug ml(-1)), tetracycline (>/=128 mug ml(-1)), kanamycin (>/=256 mug ml(-1)) and streptomycin (>/=96 mug ml(-1)). the two referenced chicken isolates gave positive aac(6')ie-aph(2'')ia and tet(l) pcr results. the wild-type ecoffs isolates were subjected to the apizym analysis for enzyme profile evaluation and amino acid decarboxylase activities determined by qualitative plate method and multiplex pcr for the detection of four genes involved in the production of histamine (histidine decarboxylase, hdc), tyramine (tyrosine decarboxylase, tyrdc) and putrescine (via eithers ornithine decarboxylase, odc, or agmatine deiminase, agdi). from examined strains only two chicken isolates (l. reuteri 14k; l. salivarius 15k) had no harmful beta-glucuronidase, beta-glucosidase activities connected with detrimental effects in the gastrointestinal tract and together no amino acid decarboxylase activities and no genes associated with biogenic amines production though only chicken l. salivarius 15k whole cells and acid supernatants shown strong suppressive potential against biofilm-forming klebsiella and escherichia coli. our results highlight that above-mentioned isolate l. salivarius 15k fulfils the principle requirements of a qualified probiotic and may be seen as a reliable candidate for further validation studies in chicken.
adhesive ability means inhibition activities for lactobacillus against pathogens  and s-layer protein plays an important role in adhesion.
eighty-five strains of lactobacillus were isolated from the pig intestine and identified by sequencing analysis based on 16s rrna gene, from which five lactobacillus strains with high adhesive ability were selected. the inhibition ability of the five lactobacillus strains with or without s-layer proteins against adherence of escherichia coli k88 and salmonella enteritidis 50335 to caco-2 was evaluated in vitro with lactobacillus rhamnosus gg strain (lgg) as a positive control. in addition, tolerance of lactobacilli to heat, acid, bile, zn(2+) and cu(2+) were assessed. all five selected strains, lactobacillus salivarius zj614 (jn981856), lactobacillus reuteri zj616 (jn981858), l. reuteri zj617 (jn981859), l. reuteri zj621 (jn981863) and l. reuteri zj623 (jn981865), showed inhibition against the two pathogens, e. coli k88 and s. enteritidis 50335. l. reuteri zj621 showed higher inhibition ability than the others to s. enteritidis 50335 (p < 0.05). sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) analysis indicated that all five strains had abundant bands with molecular weight ranging from 34 to 130 kda as well as had a common band of approximately 42 kda. after treatment with 5 m licl to remove s-layer protein, the inhibition activities of the lactobacilli against pathogens decreased significantly (p < 0.05). the results showed that higher adhesive ability means higher inhibition activity for lactobacillus against pathogen, in which s-layer proteins plays an important role.
antimicrobial potential for the combination of bovine lactoferrin or its hydrolysate with lactoferrin-resistant probiotics against foodborne pathogens.
previous reports have shown that several probiotic strains can resist the antibacterial activity of bovine lactoferrin (blf), but the results are inconsistent. moreover, a portion of orally administered apo-blf is digested in vivo by pepsin to yield blf hydrolysate, which produces stronger antibacterial activity than that observed with apo-blf. however, whether blf hydrolysate affects the growth of probiotic strains is unclear. therefore, various probiotic strains in taiwan were collected and evaluated for activity against apo-blf and blf hydrolysate in vitro. thirteen probiotic strains were evaluated, and the growth of lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356, lactobacillus salivarius atcc 11741, lactobacillus rhamnosus atcc 53103, bifidobacterium longum atcc 15707, and bifidobacterium lactis bcrc 17394 were inhibited by both apo-blf and blf hydrolysate. the growth of 8 strains were not affected by apo-blf and blf hydrolysate, including l. rhamnosus atcc 7469, lactobacillus reuteri atcc 23272, lactobacillus fermentum atcc 11739, lactobacillus coryniformis atcc 25602, l. acidophilus bcrc 14065, bifidobacterium infantis atcc 15697, bifidobacterium bifidum atcc 29521, and pediococcus acidilactici atcc 8081. however, apo-blf and its hydrolysate inhibited the growth of foodborne pathogens, including escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, staphylococcus aureus, and enterococcus faecalis. moreover, the supernatants produced by l. fermentum, b. lactis, and b. longum inhibited the growth of most pathogens. importantly, a combination of apo-blf or blf hydrolysate with the supernatants of cultures of the organisms described above showed synergistic or partially synergistic effects against the growth of most of the selected pathogens. in conclusion, several probiotic strains are resistant to apo-blf and blf hydrolysate, warranting clinical studies to evaluate the antimicrobial potential for the combination of apo-blf or its hydrolysate with specific probiotics.
effects of lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus reuteri, and pediococcus acidilactici on the nematode caenorhabditis elegans include possible antitumor activity.
this study examined the effects of three lactic acid bacteria (lab) strains on the nematode caenorhabditis elegans. lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus reuteri, and pediococcus acidilactici were found to inhibit the development and growth of the worm. compared to escherichia coli used as the control, l. reuteri and p. acidilactici reduced the lifespan of wild-type and short-lived daf-16 worms. on the contrary, l. salivarius extended the lifespan of daf-16 worms when used live, but reduced it as uv-killed bacteria. the three lab induced the expression of genes involved in pathogen response and inhibited the growth of tumor-like germ cells, without affecting daf16 localization or increasing corpse cells. our results suggest the possible use of c. elegans as a model for studying the antitumor attributes of lab. the negative effects of these lab strains on the nematode also indicate their potential use against parasitic nematodes.
isolation and characterization of lactobacillus salivarius mtc 1026 as a potential probiotic.
researchers are becoming more interested in studying probiotics at present due to their benefit to human and animal health. in this study, newly isolated strains from human feces were evaluated for probiotic properties. a total of sixty isolated strains were collected from feces and six out of sixty isolated strains could inhibit the growth of salmonella typhi and salmonella typhimurium. the strain which gave the best inhibitory effect was selected for further characterization as a probiotic strain. the identification of this strain was analyzed on the basis of morphological and biochemical characteristics and 16s rdna gene sequence. this strain was gram-positive, rod shaped, and catalase and oxidase-negative, and produced acids from d-glucose, d-fructose, lactose, mannitol, sorbitol, inulin and starch. it could not hydrolyze esculin or red blood cells. based on its 16s rdna gene sequence, it was lactobacillus salivarius, and so was called l. salivarius mtc 1026 in this study, and was closely related with l. salivarius dspv 344t isolated from the calf gut. it was able to survive in gastric and small intestinal juices at ph 2.0 and 1.0% bile salt for several hours and also could grow at 45 degrees c. moreover, this strain showed inhibitory activity against a variety of food-borne pathogens. it was highly sensitive to piperacillin, chloramphenicl, ampicillin, erythromycin and ceftazidime. after plasmid curing, this strain was susceptible to gentamicin, amikacin, norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin. l. salivarius mtc 1026 could significantly inhibit the adhesion process of e. coli atcc 25922 and s. typhimurium atcc 13311 on caco-2 monolayers in a competition assay and also reduced invasion of both pathogens (4-log cfu/ml) in an exclusion and displacement assay. therefore, it was clearly demonstrated in this study that l. salivarius mtc 1026 has shown promising properties as a candidate for a potential probiotic for applications in humans and animals.
in vitro antagonistic activities of animal intestinal strains against swine-associated pathogens.
a wide range of enteropathogens cause costly diarrhoeal diseases in fattening piglets and account for food-related infections in humans. the objective of this study was to screen beneficial bacterial strains from the gastrointestinal tract of various animal sources for antagonistic activity against diverse pathogens associated with hazardous pig production times. using agar spot assays, 15 well-characterized strains belonging to lactobacillus, enterococcus, bifidobacterium and bacillus were studied for inhibition of clostridium perfringens type a, various serovars of enterotoxigenic escherichia coli and salmonella enterica, as well as brachyspira pilosicoli. strong antagonists were further analyzed by studying their cell-free supernatants with and without ph neutralization, proteinase k and catalase treatment. enterobacteriaceae were effectively inhibited by lactobacillus salivarius and lactobacillus reuteri strains, independent from the animal source, and on a lower level by single strains belonging to lactobacillus mucosae, lactobacillus amylovorus and bifidobacterium thermophilum, due to organic acid production. the bacillus subtilis strain was found to produce an anti-clostridial and anti-brachyspira metabolite of proteinaceous nature. homofermentative lactobacilli and b. thermophilum could suppress the growth of b. pilosicoli, the causative agent of intestinal spirochaetosis, whereas heterofermentative strains belonging to l. reuteri and l. mucosae had no effect. the lactic acid bacteria exerted their activity primarily by organic acid release, except one enterococcus faecium and l. amylovorus strain, which exhibited antagonism through joint activity of lactate and hydrogen peroxide. the findings of this study provide a basis for further in vitro studies and encourage feeding studies to evaluate the antagonistic potential of promising strains in pig production.
antagonistic activity of lactobacillus acidophilus ry2 isolated from healthy infancy feces on the growth and adhesion characteristics of enteroaggregative escherichia coli.
enteroaggregative escherichia coli (eaggec) infection is an important cause of acute diarrhea, affecting children in developing countries and travelers visiting tropical or subtropical areas. three probiotics can exert bacteriostatic or bactericidal effects on human and animal intestinal pathogens, the efficiency of probiotics on eaggec infection remains unclear. in this study, the antagonistic activity of probiotic bacteria isolated from infant faeces was examined against several eaggec stains. while three isolates, lactobacillus acidophilus ry2, lactobacillus salivarius mm1 and lactobacillus paracasei en4 were shown to significantly inhibit the growth of eaggec. in addition, the antagonistic activity of the lactobacillus species was maintained despite heating (100 degrees c, 15 min) of cell free culture supernatant (cfcs). the antagonistic activity of the cfcs however, could be reduced following lactate dehydrogenase treatment and at ph 7.2. furthermore, in an adhesion-inhibition assay, l. acidophilus ry2 was shown to be more effective than l. salivarius mm1 and l. paracasei en4. this study suggests that l. acidophilus ry2 could be used as a probiotic organism against eaggec.
effects of rosa rugosa petals on intestinal bacteria.
the effects of pulverized petal of rosa rugosa on the growth of 10 species of intestinal and pathogenic bacteria were investigated. growth of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli was not affected by the addition of the petal in plate cultivation. however, the growth of bacteroides vulgatus, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, and bacillus cereus was completely inhibited by the addition of 0.1, 0.5, 0.1, and 0.05% (w/v) of the petal respectively. in liquid cultivation, the addition of the petal (0.5%) stimulated the growth of bifidobacterium breve and slightly inhibited the growth of lactobacillus salivarius. but the growth of e. coli, s. aureus, b. cereus, and salmonella sp. was inhibited by nearly 50%. hydrolyzable tannins isolated from r. rugosa, rugosin d, and tellimagradin ii showed antibacterial activities against e. coli, s. aureus, b. cereus, and salmonella sp., but little or no effect against bif. breve and l. salivarius. r. rugosa petal showed selective antibacterial activities against intestinal and pathogenic bacteria, and the selectivity resembled that of prebiotics such as oligosaccharides and dietary fiber. hydrolyzable tannins in r. rugosa, such as rugosin d and tellimagradin ii, must be active constituents.
three lactobacillus strains from healthy infant stool inhibit enterotoxigenic escherichia coli grown in vitro.
enterotoxigenic escherichia coli (etec) are a major cause of sporadic diarrhea disease in humans, affecting mainly infants in developing countries and travelers from industrialized countries visiting tropical or subtropical areas. in this study, we screen the antagonistic activity by inoculating wells among etec agar cultures to assess inhibition zones created by the lactobacilli spent culture supernatant (scs) from healthy infant stool. only three isolates possessed antagonistic activity, acid and bile tolerance and could adhere to the cultured human intestinal c2bbel (caco-2) cell line. isolate identification using api 50chl strips showed that they belonged to different lactobacillus species, i.e., lactobacillus acidophilus ry2, lactobacillus salivarius mm1 and lactobacillus paracasei en4. the scs still had an inhibitory effect on etec after heating (100 degrees c, 15 min). the lactate dehydrogenase treatment or the ph of scs was adjusted to neutral (ph 7.2) to reduce the scs inhibitory effect. antimicrobial activity was performed by incubating the lactic acid bacteria (lab)-scs with etec suspension. after 4h of co-culture, etec growth was inhibited. this study suggests that l. acidophilus ry2, l. salivarius mm1 and l. paracasei en4 could be used as an effective control for etec.
antimicrobial potential of four lactobacillus strains isolated from breast milk.
aims: the antimicrobial potential of four lactobacilli (lactobacillus salivarius  cect5713, lactobacillus gasseri cect5714, l. gasseri cect5715 and lactobacillus fermentum cect5716), isolated from fresh human breast milk, was evaluated in this study and compared with lactobacillus coryniformis cect5711, a reuterin-producing strain isolated from an artisan goat's cheese. methods and results: agar diffusion tests, competitive adhesion assays and mucin expression assays were carried out in order to value the antibacterial properties of the lactobacilli strains. the antibacterial capability of the strains was tested in vivo by using a murine infection model with salmonella choleraesuis. the results revealed that all the strains studied, displayed antibacterial properties against pathogenic bacteria. however, the antibacterial potential varied among the lactobacilli tested and, in fact, l. salivarius cect5713 showed not only the best in vitro antibacterial activity, but also the highest protective effect against a salmonella strain in the murine infection model. conclusion: the four breast-milk lactobacilli, and particularly l. salivarius cect5713, possess potent antibacterial activities that result in a higher protection against s. choleraesuis cect4155 in a mouse infection model. significance and impact of the study: these results suggest that lactobacilli from breast milk could contribute to an anti-infective protection in neonates and would be excellent candidates for the development of infant probiotic products.
selection of lactobacilli for chicken probiotic adjuncts.
during inhibitory activity screening of 296 strains of lactic acid bacteria from  the gastro-intestinal tract of chicks, 77 strains showed inhibition against enteric indicator strains (salmonella enteritidis and escherichia coli). eight different strains identified as lactobacillus salivarius were selected for the following attributes: their ability to inhibit all the indicator strains; a high adhesion efficiency to the epithelial cells of chickens and also their resistance to a number of antibiotics, monensin, bile salts and ph 3.0. the inhibitory action was not affected by the addition of catalase and no inhibition was detected after neutralizing the supernatant culture fluid. the competitiveness of the most promising strains, lact. salivarius ctc2183 and ctc2197, was assessed in chicken feed mixture and in vivo. it was concluded that both strains were capable of becoming predominant over the indigenous flora in the incubated chicken feed mixture. in vivo tests showed that lact. salivarius ctc2197 was able to colonize and overcome lact. salivarius ctc2183 and the indigenous flora in the crop and caecum of the inoculated chicks.
identification and screening for antimicrobial activity against clostridium difficile of bifidobacterium and lactobacillus species isolated from healthy infant faeces.
the antimicrobial activity against clostridium difficile of 109 lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from 32 healthy korean infants was measured. the ability to show similar activity against escherichia coli o157:h7 and staphylococcus aureus was also looked for. twelve of the 109 lab showed activity against c. difficile and 19 strains were active against e. coli o157:h7, but none against s. aureus. four strains had antimicrobial activity against both c. difficile and e. coli o157:h7. of the 12 strains that had activity against c. difficile, four strains were excluded as streptococcus species, while the other eight were identified using polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assays using group-specific primers designed from the nucleotide sequences of the 16s rdna and internal transcribed spacer (its) regions of the bifidobacterium and lactobacillus species. based on the sequencing results, the eight strains screened were identified as bifidobacterium infantis and lactobacillus salivarius.
survival of escherichia coli o157:h7 in traditional african yoghurt fermentation.
growth and survival of a nontoxigenic strain of escherichia coli o157:h7 (atcc 43888) was determined in traditionally fermented pasteurized milk. preheated milk was inoculated with 1% (v/v) of a mixed culture of lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (ncimb 11778) and streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus (ncimb 110368) and incubated at 25, 30, 37 or 43 degrees c for 24 h. e. coli o157:h7 (10(5) cfu/ml) were introduced into the milk pre- and post-fermentation. fermented milk samples were subsequently stored at either 4 degrees c (refrigerator temperature) or 25 degrees c (to mimic african ambient temperature) for 5 days. after 24 h of fermentation, the ph of the samples fermented at the higher temperatures of 37-43 degrees c decreased from 6.8 to 4.4-4.0 ( +/- 0.2) whereas at the lower temperature of 25 degrees c, the ph decreased to ph 5.0 +/- 0.1. during this period, viable counts for e. coli o157:h7 increased from 10(5) to 10(8) - 10(9) cfu/ml except in milk fermented at 43 degrees c wherein viability declined to 10(4) cfu/ml. in fermented (25-30 degrees c) milk stored at 4 degrees c for 5 days, e. coli o157:h7 viability decreased from 10(8-9) to 10(6-7) cfu/ml whereas milk fermented at 43 degrees c resulted in loss of detectable cells. in contrast, storage of fermented milk samples at 25 degrees c for 5 days eventually resulted in complete loss of viability irrespective of fermentation temperature. stationary phase e. coli o157:h7 inoculated post-fermentation (25 and 43 degrees c) survived during 4 degrees c storage, but not 25 degrees c storage. fermentation temperature and subsequent storage temperature are critical to the growth and survival of e. coli o157:h7 in traditional fermented products involving yoghurt starter cultures.
lactobacilli in human dental caries and saliva.
samples (98 plaque and 72 saliva) from 93 patients with dental caries were investigated for lactobacillus species which comprised 65 (62.5%) of 104 isolates. yeasts (20.1%), streptococcus spp. (8.7%), staphylococcus spp. (2.9%) and a few unidentified species (5.8%), were also found. the lactobacillus isolates were l. brevis (24.6%) l. fermentum (18.5%) l. casei (16.9%), l. delbrueckii (15.4%), l. plantarum (9.23%), l. acidophilus (7.69%), l. jensenii (4.62%), l. salivarius (1.54%) and l. gasseri (1.54%). the most common species was l. brevis (24.6%). the strains tested for beta-lactamase production showed 75.4% positive. all the lactobacillus strains were tested for bacteriocin production against escherichia coli, salmonella spp., shigella dysenteriae, s. sonnei, klebsiella spp. and campylobacter sp. all the lactobacilli except l. jensenii produced bacteriocin against at least one of the indicator organisms. the involvement of lactobacillus in dental caries was established, although its role and mechanism is not well understood. the ability of lactobacillus spp. to protect their host against certain diseases by inhibiting the growth of potential pathogens was evident.
bacteriocin production by lactobacillus salivarius of animal origin.

antimicrobial activity of neutralized extracellular culture filtrates of lactic acid bacteria isolated from a cultured indian milk product ('dahi').
neutralized extracellular culture filtrate obtained from isolates of lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus delbruecki ssp. bulgaricus, lactobacillus salivarius and lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis from 'dahi' showed weak to moderate inhibition of staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, escherichia coli, bacillus brevis, bacillus circulans, bacillus coagulans, bacillus laterosporus, bacillus subtilis and pseudomonas aeruginosa when tested by the diffusion agar well assay method. the effective minimum quantity of lactic culture filtrates required to obtain complete inhibition of an inoculum of 10(3) cfu/ml of the bacteria tested was between 20 and 26% (vol/vol), as determined by the agar incorporation method. neutralized extracellular culture filtrate of these lactic cultures added at a level of 10% in sterile, 10% reconstituted non-fat dry milk was able to either suppress or retard growth of selected bacterial cultures when incubated at 37 degrees c for 24 h. this study indicated the antimicrobial activity of dahi and the potential of using neutralized extracellular culture filtrate of lactic acid bacteria in the biopreservation of foods.
purification and certain properties of a bacteriocin from streptococcus mutans.
an inhibition factor from streptococcus mutans strain c3603 (serotype c) was purified and isolated, and its properties indicated that it was a bacteriocin. bacteriocin c3603 is a basic protein with a pi value of 10 and a molecular weight of 4,800. the activity of this bacteriocin was not affected by ph over a range of 1.0 to 12.0 or by storage at 100 degrees c for 10 min at ph 2.0 to 7.0 or storage at 121 degrees c for 15 min at ph 4.0. pronase; papain, phospholipase c, trypsin, and alpha-amylase had no effect on the activity of the bacteriocin, whereas alpha-chymotrypsin and pancreatin were partially active against it. bacteriocin activity was greater against certain s. mutans strains of serotypes b, c, e, and f than against certain s. mutans strains of serotypes a, d, and g. bacteriocin c3603 was also effective against selected strains of s. sanguis, s. salivarius, s. bovis, s. faecium, s. lactis, lactobacillus casei, l. plantarum, l. fermentum, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium longum, propionibacterium acnes, and bacteroides melaninogenicus, but it was not effective against certain strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, corynebacterium parvum, and candida albicans. the inhibition of s. mutans strains bht and ps-14 by bacteriocin c3603 was found to be due to the bacteriocidal activity of the bacteriocin. when water or a diet containing bacteriocin c3603 was consumed by gnotobiotic and specific pathogen-free rats infected with s. mutans ps-14, the caries score was found to be significantly reduced.
