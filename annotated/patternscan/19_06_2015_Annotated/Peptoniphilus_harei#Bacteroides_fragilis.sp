TI  == antibiotic susceptibility profiles of anaerobic pathogens in the netherlands.
AB  == the antibiotic susceptibility profile of the bacteroides fragilis group, gram-positive anaerobic cocci (gpac), fusobacterium spp., prevotella spp., veillonella spp. and bilophila wadsworthia for amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, clindamycin and metronidazole was determined. human  clinical isolates were isolated between 2011 and 2013 at the microbiological diagnostic laboratory of the university medical center groningen, the netherlands and subjected to maldi-tof ms identification and susceptibility testing using e-test for mic determination. differences in clindamycin susceptibility between species of the b. fragilis group and gpac were observed, with bacteroides ovatus  and peptoniphilus harei having the highest resistance rates. compared to other european countries, in the netherlands the mic90 for clindamycin of fusobacteria  is low. metronidazole resistance was first encountered in the genus prevotella in 2013, but not in species of gpac as reported in belgium and bulgaria. the differences in clindamycin resistance between the different european countries and reports of metronidazole resistance within the genera prevotella and gpac warrant more extensive susceptibility studies on anaerobic pathogens.
