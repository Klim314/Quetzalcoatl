TI  - Multiplex PCR for the detection of Piscirickettsia salmonis, Vibrio anguillarum,  Aeromonas salmonicida and Streptococcus phocae in Chilean marine farms.
AB  - A multiplex (m-)PCR-based protocol was designed for the simultaneous detection of the main marine bacterial pathogens in Chilean salmon farms: Streptococcus phocae, Aeromonas salmonicida, Vibrio anguillarum and Piscirickettsia salmonis. Each of the 4 oligonucleotide primer pairs exclusively amplified the target gene of the specific bacterial pathogen. The detection limit of the m-PCR using purified total bacterial DNA was 50 pg microl(-1) for V anguillarum, 500 fg microl(-1) for P. salmonis, and 5 pg microl(-1) for S. phocae and A. salmonicida. This corresponded to average limits in the m-PCR sensitivity of 3.69 x 10(5) CFU ml(-1) of V anguillarum, 1.26 x 10(4) CFU m(-1) of S. phocae, and 5.33 x 10(4) CFU ml(-1) of A. salmonicida, while the detection limits for the spiked fish tissues, regardless of the sample (spleen, kidney, liver or muscle) were 2.64 +/- 0.54 x 10(7) CFU g(-1) for V. anguillarum, 9.03 +/- 1.84 x 10(5) CFU g(-1) for S. phocae, 3.8 +/- 0.78 x 10(3) CFU mg(-1) for A. salmonicida and 100 P. salmonis cells. However, high amounts of DNA from 3 bacterial species had a reduction of -1 log-unit on the amplification sensitivity of S. phocae or A. salmonicida when these were present in lower concentration in the multiplex reaction. The assay described in this study is a rapid, sensitive and efficient tool to detect the presence of S. phocae, A. salmonicida, V. anguillarum and P. salmonis simultaneously from pure cultures and tissues from clinically diseased fish. Therefore, it may be a useful alternative to culture-based methods for the diagnosis of infections in fish obtained from Chilean salmon farms.
TI  - Phenoloxidase in the scallop Chlamys farreri: purification and antibacterial activity of its reaction products generated in vitro.
AB  - Phenoloxidase (PO) was purified from hemocytes of the scallop Chlamys farreri using native-PAGE and gel permeation column chromatography, and then substrate specificity and antibacterial activity generated from reaction products of purified PO were analyzed. The results showed purified PO had a molecular mass of 576 kDa in native-PAGE and 53 kDa in denatured PAGE, and could catalyze the substrates L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA), dopamine, catechol and hydroquinone suggesting it is a type of p-diphenoloxidase. Using dopamine as a substrate, PO reaction products significantly inhibited the growth of Vibrio alginolyticus, Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Aeromonas salmonicida. No significant inhibition was found in Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus iniae, Micrococcus lysodeikticus and Edwardsiella tarda. When L-DOPA was used as a substrate, significant inhibition occurred in A. salmonicida only.
TI  - Ovarian hydrobursitis in female camels (Camelus dromedaries): biochemical, bacterial and protozoal evaluation.
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate female camels affected with ovarian hydrobursitis (n = 31) for hematological and biochemical findings and for bacterial and protozoal infections. Blood samples were obtained and surgical ablation of the affected bursa was performed. Bursal fluid, follicular fluid, and serum were subjected to hormonal and biochemical analyses. Bursal fluids were cultured and colonies were identified using BioMerieux Vitek two compact system. Passive haemagglutination test was used for detection of Trypanosoma evansi. Indirect ELISA technique was carried out for detection of anti-Hydatid cysts anti-bodies. Neutrophilia was found in the affected animals (P = 0.01) with tendencies for monocytosis (P = 0.06) and eosinophelia (P = 0.05). Bursal fluid had a tendency for high estradiol-17beta concentration compared to blood serum (P = 0.07). Progesterone and cholesterol concentrations were similar in bursal fluid, follicular fluid and serum. Total protein, phosphorus, and magnesium concentrations were greater (P < 0.05) in the bursal fluid than in serum. Oligella urethralis, Alloiococcus otitis, Granulicatella adicens, Escherichia coli, Sphingobacterium thalpophilum, Streptococcus sanguinis, Aeromonas salmonicida, Pseudomonas stutzeri, Staphylococcus warneri, Staphylococcus hominis, and Rhizobium radiobacter were isolated from 46.7% of bursal fluids. T. evansi was positive in 9.7% of cases. None were positive for hydatid cyst. Accordingly, we suggest that the ovarian hydrobursitis syndrome is initially an inflammatory process and the accumulated bursal fluid is partially originated from follicular fluid.
TI  - Characterization of probiotic carnobacteria isolated from rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) intestine.
AB  - AIMS: To characterize two probiotic carnobacterial isolates, Carnobacterium maltaromaticum (B26) and C. divergens (B33), derived from rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) intestine. METHODS AND RESULTS: Both cultures, which were able to colonize the fish gut mucosal layer, comprised nonsporogenous, nonmotile, Gram-positive, catalase and oxidase-negative rods. The growth of both carnobacteria occurred between 0 and 37 degrees C, in 0-10% (w/v) NaCl and at pH 5-10. Specifically, strain B26 grew in nutrient broth supplemented with 15% (w/v) NaCl. The most abundant cellular fatty acid of both cultures was 9-octadecenoic acid (18 : 1 n-9) (B26 = 52.6%; B33 = 40.6%), which was characteristic of Carnobacterium. Both cultures were inhibitory to Aeromonas salmonicida, Aer. hydrophila, Streptococcus iniae and Vibrio anguillarum, and strain B33 inhibited Listeria monocytogenes. Both carnobacteria, which did not contain plasmids, produced inhibitory compounds against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. CONCLUSIONS: Both probiotic cultures, B26 and B33, had unique phenotypic characteristics and showed a broad spectrum of antibiotic resistance against varying pathogenic bacteria. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The results of this study contribute to new information and significance of carnobacterial species.
TI  - The development of probiotics for the control of multiple bacterial diseases of rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss (Walbaum).
AB  - JB-1 and GC2, which were equated with Bacillus sp. and Aeromonas sobria respectively, were recovered from the digestive tract of rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss and ghost carp, Cyprinus sp. respectively, and demonstrated effectiveness as probiotics for the control of infections caused by Aeromonas salmonicida, Lactococcus garvieae, Streptococcus iniae, Vibrio anguillarum, Vibrio ordalii and Yersinia ruckeri. When administered to rainbow trout (average weight = 12 g) for 14 days in feed dosed at 2 x 10(8) cells g(-1) of feed, JB-1 led to a reduction in mortalities to 0-13% after challenge with a range of bacterial pathogens compared to 80-100% mortalities of the controls. Similarly, use of GC2 reduced mortalities to 0-16% following the challenge compared to 80-100% mortalities of the controls. The mode of action reflected nutrition, production of inhibitory substances and stimulation of the innate immune responses. Specifically, JB-1 and especially GC2 were positive for siderophore and chitinase production, and increased lysozyme, phagocytic and respiratory burst activity.
TI  - Bacterial vaccines for fish--an update of the current situation worldwide.
AB  - During the last few years, the use of vaccines for disease prevention in aquaculture has expanded both with regard to the number of fish species and number of microbial diseases. According to the responses to a questionnaire received from 41 countries, vaccination is used in the commercial aquaculture of species like Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax), sea bream (Sparus aurata), barramundi (Lates calcarifer), tilapia (Tilapia spp), turbot (Scophthalmus maximus L.), yellowtail (Seriola quinqueradiata), purplish and gold-striped amberjack (Seriola dumereli), striped jack (Pseudocaranx dentex) and channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus). The range of bacterial infections for which vaccines are commercially available now comprises classical vibriosis (Listonella anguillarum, Vibrio ordalii), furunculosis (Aeromonas salmonicida subsp. salmonicida), cold-water vibriosis (Vibrio salmonicida), yersiniosis (Yersinia ruckeri), pasteurellosis (Photobacterium damselae supsp. piscicida), edwardsiellosis (Edwardsiella ictaluri), winter ulcer (Moritella viscosa), and streptococcosis/lactococcosis (Streptococcus iniae, Lactococcus garviae). Furthermore, experimental vaccines are used against diseases such as infection with Vibrio harveyi and Photobacterium damsela subsp. damsela in barramundi, piscirickettsiosis and bacterial kidney disease in salmonids, as well as infection with Flexibacter maritimus (now: Tenacibaculum maritimum) in turbot. There was good agreement between the information received from different sources in the same country. Most vaccines are licensed products, but some non-licensed vaccines are also used in commercial fish farms. Most bacterial vaccines are inactivated products and recombinant vaccine technology has so far been used to a very limited extent. Salmonid fish are usually immunised with multivalent vaccines by intraperitoneal injection. In marine fish species vaccination is generally performed by immersion, but use of injection vaccination is increasing, particularly in the Mediterranean region. Only limited use of orally administered fish vaccines is reported. In general, the effect of vaccination against bacterial infections is good. The best protection is obtained with injectable, adjuvanted vaccines. However, injection-site adverse reactions often occur when such products are used.
TI  - Bass hepcidin synthesis, solution structure, antimicrobial activities and synergism, and in vivo hepatic response to bacterial infections.
AB  - Bass hepcidin was purified from the gill of hybrid striped bass (Morone chrysops  x Morone saxatilis) based on antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli. This 21-amino acid peptide has 8 cysteines engaged in 4 disulfide bonds and is very similar to human hepcidin, an antimicrobial peptide with iron regulatory properties. To gain insight into potential role(s) of bass hepcidin in innate immunity in fish, we synthesized the peptide, characterized its antimicrobial activities in vitro, determined its solution structure by NMR, and quantified hepatic gene expression in vivo following infection of bass with the fish pathogens, Streptococcus iniae or Aeromonas salmonicida. Its structure is very similar to that of human hepcidin, including the presence of an antiparallel beta-sheet, a conserved disulfide-bonding pattern, and a rare vicinal disulfide bond. Synthetic bass hepcidin was active in vitro against Gram-negative pathogens and fungi but showed no activity against key Gram-positive pathogens and a single yeast strain tested. Hepcidin was non-hemolytic at microbicidal concentrations and had lower specific activity than moronecidin, a broad spectrum, amphipathic, alpha-helical, antimicrobial peptide constitutively expressed in bass gill tissue. Good synergism between the bacterial killing activities of hepcidin and moronecidin was observed in vitro. Hepcidin gene expression in bass liver increased significantly within hours of infection with Gram-positive (S. iniae) or Gram-negative (A. salmonicida) pathogens and was 4-5 orders of magnitude above base-line 24-48 h post-infection. Our results suggest that hepcidin plays a key role in the antimicrobial defenses of bass and that its functions are potentially conserved between fish and human.
TI  - Effects of bacteria on the growth of an amoeba infecting the gills of turbot.
AB  - We analysed the influence of various bacteria on the in vitro growth of trophozoites of a Platyamoeba strain isolated from diseased gill tissues of cultured turbot. Little or no growth was shown by amoebae cultured in the presence of (1) the turbot-pathogenic bacteria Vibrio anguillarum, Aeromonas salmonicida or Streptococcus sp., (2) Pasteurella piscicida or Vibrio vulnificus (pathogenic for some fishes but not turbot), or (3) the non-pathogenic 'environmental' bacteria Vibrio campbelli, Vibrio fluvialis or Pseudomonas dondorofii. The only bacteria which were successfully utilized as food sources were Aeromonas hydrophila (pathogenic for some fishes but not turbot) and the non-pathogens Vibrio natriegens, Pseudomonas nautica and Escherichia coli. These results suggest that the colonization of the gills of cultured turbot by the epizoic amoeba Platyamoeba may be an indicator of faecal contamination.
TI  - Identification of Lactococcus garvieae by PCR.
AB  - Lactococcus garvieae junior synonym Enterococcus seriolicida) is an emerging zoonotic agent isolated from economically important fish (rainbow trout and yellowtail), from cattle, and from humans. Clindamycin susceptibility is the only phenotypic test which can differentiate L. garvieae from Lactococcus lactis, another emerging agent in humans. A PCR assay for the identification of L. garvieae was developed and resulted in an amplified fragment of 1,100 bp in size. The PCR assay was shown to be specific to L. garvieae. The PCR assay was positive for all the L. garvieae strains tested, which originated from three different continents (Asia, Australia, and Europe). The PCR assay was negative for the phenotypically similar L. lactis and for all the other fish pathogens tested, including Streptococcus iniae and Aeromonas salmonicida. The PCR assay was applied to plasma obtained from diseased animals and was found sensitive enough to detect bacteria from 1 microl of plasma. The PCR assay that was developed is the only practical test besides the clindamycin test which can specifically identify the zoonotic agent L. garvieae and which can differentiate it from L. lactis.
TI  - Identification and characterization of the insertion element IS1070 from Leuconostoc lactis NZ6009.
AB  - A novel insertion sequence, designated IS1070, was identified on the lactose plasmid of Leuconostoc lactis NZ6009 by nucleotide sequence analysis. The 1027-bp sequence contains partially matched (24 of 28 bp) inverted repeats and has one long open reading frame. The deduced 305-amino-acid sequence demonstrated homology to transposases of IS30 from Escherichia coli, IS4351 from Bacteroides fragilis, IS1086 from Alcaligenes eutrophus, IS1161 from Streptococcus salivarius, ISAS2 from Aeromonas salmonicida and a putative protein encoded by ORF3 of virus SpV1-R8A2 B from Spiroplasma citri. At least fifteen IS1070-like sequences were detected in the genome of the parent Lc. lactis strain and five of these were situated on plasmids. Analysis of the direct repeats of two of these copies with that of IS1070 revealed differences in the target duplication lengths.
TI  - Health status of salmonids in river systems in Natal. III. Isolation and identification of bacteria.
AB  - Both pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacteria were isolated from fish, both salmonid and non-salmonid, from selected river systems in Natal. Pasteurella pisicida was isolated for the first time from fish in South Africa. The isolation of Yersinia ruckeri, Aeromonas salmonicida, and Edwardsiella tarda were recorded for the first time from fish in Natal. A. hydrophila and Flexibacter columnaris were found to be widespread throughout the river systems in Natal. The Streptococcus species which caused serious disease problems in trout in the Cape Province and Transvaal was not isolated from any of the fish examined in Natal.
