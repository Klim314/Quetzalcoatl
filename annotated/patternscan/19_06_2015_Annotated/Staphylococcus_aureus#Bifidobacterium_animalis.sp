TI  == antimicrobial activity and antibiotic susceptibility of and spp. intended for use as starter and probiotic cultures.
AB  == antimicrobial activity and antibiotic susceptibility were tested for 23 lactobacillus and three bifidobacterium strains isolated from different ecological niches. agar-well diffusion method was used to test the antagonistic effect (against staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, bacillus cereus and candida albicans) of acid and neutralized (ph 5.5) lyophilized concentrated supernatants (cell-free supernatant; cfs) and whey (cell-free whey fractions; cfw) from de man-rogosa-sharpe/trypticase-phytone-yeast broth and skim milk. acid cfs and cfw showed high acidification rate-dependent bacterial inhibition; five strains were active against c. albicans. neutralized cfs/cfw assays showed six strains active against s. aureus (l. acidophilus l-1, l. brevis 1, l. fermentum 1, b. animalis subsp. lactis l-3), e. coli (l. bulgaricus 6) or b. cereus (l. plantarum 24-4capital ve, cyrillic). inhibition of two pathogens with neutralized cfs (l. bulgaricus 6, l. helveticus 3, l. plantarum 24-2l, l. fermentum 1)/cfw (l. plantarum 24-5d, l. plantarum 24-4capital ve, cyrillic) was detected. some strains maintained activity after ph neutralization, indicating presence of active substances. the antibiotics minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were  determined by the epsilometer test method. all strains were susceptible to ampicillin, gentamicin, erythromycin and tetracycline. four lactobacilli were resistant to one antibiotic (l. rhamnosus lio 1 to streptomycin) or two antibiotics (l. acidophilus l-1 and l. brevis 1 to kanamycin and clindamycin; l.  casei l-4 to clindamycin and chloramphenicol). vancomycin mics > 256 mug/ml indicated intrinsic resistance for all heterofermentative lactobacilli. the antimicrobially active strains do not cause concerns about antibiotic resistance  transfer and could be used as natural biopreservatives in food and therapeutic formulations.

TI  == antistaphylococcal action of lacto- and bifidobacteria and interleukn-2.
AB  == antistaphylococcal action of lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus imv b-7281, l. acidophilus lmv b-7279 and bifidobacterium animalis vkb as well as interleukin-2 (il-2) has been determined on the model of experimental staphylococcal infection in mice. it has been established that peroral administration of certain probiotic strains of lacto- and bifidobacteria or composition l. acidophilus lmv b-7279--l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus imv b-7281 with il-2 to mice favored the reducing of terms of staphylococcus persistence in the kidneys of experimental mice. the studied schemes are promising for treatment of patients with surgical infection.

TI  == synergistic antibacterial efficacies of the combination of bovine lactoferrin or  its hydrolysate with probiotic secretion in curbing the growth of meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == the occurrence of multidrug-resistant or meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) has become an important issue in clinics. this study evaluated a combinatorial treatment approach by using the well-documented antibacterial protein apo-bovine lactoferrin (apo-blf) or its hydrolysate and specific probiotic supernatants for controlling mrsa infection. clinical mrsa strains were isolated from different patient specimens. apo-blf-hydrolysate possessed stronger anti-mrsa activity than complete blf in that it inhibited the growth of most mrsa strains tested in vitro. otherwise, the supernatants produced by lactobacillus fermentum (atcc 11739), bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum (atcc 15707) and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis (bcrc 17394) inhibited the growth of various mrsa strains. further, l. fermentum or b. animalis subsp. lactis supernatant plus apo-blf or blf-hydrolysate led to partially synergistic to synergistic growth-inhibitory activity against mrsa strains. however, l. fermentum and not b. animalis subsp. lactis or b. longum subsp. longum was observed to resist the antibacterial activity of both apo-lf and blf-hydrolysate. therefore, it is suggested that l. fermentum could be the best candidate to be used with apo-blf or blf-hydrolysate as a live supplement against mrsa infections.

TI  == the effect of lacto- and bifidobacteria in monoculture on the vaginal microflora  in norm and in cases of intravaginal staphylococcosis.
AB  == the influence of probiotic strains of lactobacillus casei imv b-7280, lactobacillus acidophilus imv b-7279, bifidobacterium animalis vkl, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus imv b-7281 and bifidobacterium animalis vkb, each strain separately, to the range of the urogenital tract microflora in physiological norm and in cases of experimental intravaginal staphylococcosis of  mice induced by staphylococcus aureus 8325-4. it was found that all these strains had different efficiency in staphylococcus aureus 8325-4 growth suppression in the vagina of infected mice and affect the spectrum of microorganisms. lactobacillus casei imv b-7280 strain had effective antistaphylococcal effect and reduced the number of coliform bacteria and fungi in the vagina in cases of intravaginal staphylococcosis of mice. lactobacillus casei imv b-7280 strain is promising to create probiotic drugs effective in treating intravaginal staphylococcosis.

TI  == the effect of lacto- and bifidobacteria compositions on the vaginal microflora in cases of intravaginal staphylococcosis.
AB  == the effect of intravaginal injection of lactobacillus casei imv b-7280, lactobacillus acidophilus imv b-7279, bifidobacterium animalis vkl and bifidobacterium animalis vkb strains in various compositions on the range of microflora of the urogenital tract on the model of experimental intravaginal staphylococcosis of mice was determined. it was established that under the influence of various compositions of these strains changes in microflora spectrum occurred: the number of representatives of normoflora increased and the number of pathogenic microorganisms, including staphylococci, streptococci, coliform bacteria and fungi, significantly decreased. it was determined that strains of lacto- and bifidobacteria, that were studied, are prospective components of future probiotic drugs efficient in treating staphylococcosis.

TI  == incorporation of probiotic bacteria in whey cheese: decreasing the risk of microbial contamination.
AB  == for dairy products that are consumed fresh, contamination by spoilage microorganisms and pathogens from the environment is a major concern. contamination has been associated with a number of outbreaks of foodborne illnesses; however, consistent data pertaining to the microbial safety of whey cheeses specifically have not been reported. hence, the goals of this research effort were (i) to manufacture a probiotic whey cheese with bifidobacterium animalis and lactobacillus casei and (ii) to assess the antimicrobial activity of these probiotics against a set of foodborne pathogens (listeria innocua, salmonella enteritidis, and staphylococcus aureus) and food spoilage microorganisms (pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli). three ranges of these microbial contaminants were used for inoculation of cheeses: 10(3) to 10(4), 10(4) to 10(6), and 10(6) to 10(8) cfu/g. inoculation in plain culture medium served as a control. the inhibition produced by the probiotics was calculated, and the major effect was found to be bacteriostatic. in specific cases, full inhibition was observed, i.e., by b. animalis against p. aeruginosa and by l. casei against salmonella enteritidis and l. innocua. conversely, the least inhibition was detected for l. casei against p. aeruginosa. our results suggest that use of these probiotic strains can extend the shelf life of whey cheeses and make them safer by delaying or preventing growth of common contaminant bacteria.

TI  == the effect of pomegranate (punica granatum l.) byproducts and ellagitannins on the growth of human gut bacteria.
AB  == the consumption of pomegranate products leads to a significant accumulation of ellagitannins in the large intestines, where they interact with complex gut microflora. this study investigated the effect of pomegranate tannin constituents on the growth of various species of human gut bacteria. our results showed that pomegranate byproducts and punicalagins inhibited the growth of pathogenic clostridia and staphyloccocus aureus. probiotic lactobacilli and bifidobacteria were generally not affected by ellagitannins, while relatively small growth inhibition by ellagic acid likely resulted from decreasing media quality due to the formation of tannin-protein complexes. the effect of pomegranate ellagitannins on bifidobacteria was species- and tannin-dependent. the growth of  bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis was slightly inhibited by punicalagins, punicalins, and ellagic acid. pomx supplementation significantly enhanced the growth of bifidobacterium breve and bifidobacterium infantis.

TI  == growth-inhibitory effects of galla rhois-derived tannins on intestinal bacteria.
AB  == the growth-inhibitory activity of galla rhois-derived materials towards 17 intestinal bacteria was evaluated using an impregnated paper disc method. the biologically active components of galla rhois were characterized as the tannins methyl gallate (mg) and gallic acid (ga) by spectral analysis. the growth responses varied with bacterial strain tested. in the test using 10 mg disc-1, mg and ga produced a clear inhibitory effect on harmful bacteria such as clostridium perfringens, cl. paraputrificum, eubacterium limosum, bacteroides fragilis, staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli. methyl gallate showed no growth-inhibitory activity towards bifidobacterium adolescentis or b. longum whereas the growth of b. bifidum, b. breve, b. infantis, b. animalis, b. thermophilum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lact. plantarum and streptococcus faecalis was slightly affected. however, ga did not adversely affect the growth of the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. at 5 mg disc-1, mg significantly inhibited the growth of cl. perfringens and cl. paraputrificum but did not affect the growth of the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. at 1 mg disc-1, mg greatly inhibited the growth of cl. perfringens alone. these results may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of galla rhois.
