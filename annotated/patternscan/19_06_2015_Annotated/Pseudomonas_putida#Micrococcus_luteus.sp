TI  == enzyme fusion for whole-cell biotransformation of long-chain sec-alcohols into esters.
AB  == enzyme fusion was investigated as a strategy to improve productivity of a two-step whole-cell biocatalysis. the biotransformation of long-chain sec-alcohols into esters by an alcohol dehydrogenase (adh) and baeyer-villiger monooxygenases (bvmos) was used as the model reaction. the recombinant escherichia coli, expressing the fusion enzymes between the adh of micrococcus luteus nctc2665 and the bvmo of pseudomonas putida kt2440 or rhodococcus jostii rha1, showed significantly greater bioconversion activity with long-chain sec-alcohols (e.g., 12-hydroxyoctadec-9-enoic acid (1a), 13-hydroxyoctadec-9-enoic acid (2a), 14-hydroxyicos-11-enoic acid (4a)) when compared to the recombinant e. coli expressing the adh and bvmos independently. for instance, activity of the recombinant e. coli expressing the adh-gly-bvmo, in which glycine-rich peptide was used as the linker, with 1a was increased up to 22 mumol g dry cells-1 min-1. this value is over 40 % greater than the recombinant e. coli expressing the adh and bvmo independently. the substantial improvement appeared to be driven by an increase in the functional expression of the bvmos and/or an increase in mass transport efficiency by localizing two active sites in close proximity.

TI  == expression levels of chaperones influence biotransformation activity of recombinant escherichia coli expressing micrococcus luteus alcohol dehydrogenase  and pseudomonas putida baeyer-villiger monooxygenase.
AB  == we demonstrated for the first time that the archaeal chaperones (i.e., gamma-prefoldin and thermosome) can stabilize enzyme activity in vivo. ricinoleic acid biotransformation activity of recombinant escherichia coli expressing micrococcus luteus alcohol dehydrogenase and the pseudomonas putida kt2440 baeyer-villiger monooxygenase improved significantly with co-expression of gamma-prefoldin or recombinant themosome originating from the deep-sea hyperthermophile archaea methanocaldococcus jannaschii. furthermore, the degree of enhanced activity was dependent on the expression levels of the chaperones. for example, whole-cell biotransformation activity was highest at 12 micromol/g dry cells/min when gamma-prefoldin expression level was approximately 46% of the  theoretical maximum. this value was approximately two-fold greater than that in e. coli, where the gamma-prefoldin expression level was zero or set to the theoretical maximum. therefore, it was assumed that the expression levels of chaperones must be optimized to achieve maximum biotransformation activity in whole-cell biocatalysts.

TI  == a novel c-type lysozyme from mytilus galloprovincialis: insight into innate immunity and molecular evolution of invertebrate c-type lysozymes.
AB  == a c-type lysozyme (named as mgclyz) gene was cloned from the mussel mytilus galloprovincialis. blast analysis indicated that mgclyz was a salivary c-type lysozyme which was mainly found in insects. the nucleotide sequence of mgclyz was predicted to encode a polypeptide of 154 amino acid residues with the signal peptide comprising the first 24 residues. the deduced mature peptide of mgclyz was of a calculated molecular weight of 14.4 kd and a theoretical isoelectric point (pi) of 8.08. evolution analysis suggested that bivalve branch of the invertebrate c-type lysozymes phylogeny tree underwent positive selection during  evolution. by quantitative real-time rt-pcr (qrt-pcr) analysis, mgclyz transcript was widely detected in all examined tissues and responded sensitively to bacterial challenge in hemocytes and hepatopancreas. the optimal temperature and  ph of recombinant mgclyz (rmgclyz) were 20 degrees c and 4, respectively. the rmgclyz displayed lytic activities against gram-positive bacteria including micrococcus luteus and staphyloccocus aureus, and gram-negative bacteria including vibrio anguillarum, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas putida, proteus mirabilis and bacillus aquimaris. these results suggest that mgclyz perhaps play  an important role in innate immunity of m. galloprovincialis, and invertebrate c-type lysozymes might be under positive selection in a species-specific manner during evolution for undergoing adaptation to different environment and diverse pathogens.

TI  == comparison of aerosol and bioaerosol collection on air filters.
AB  == air filters efficiency is usually determined by non-biological test aerosols, such as potassium chloride particles, arizona dust or di-ethyl-hexyl-sebacate (dehs) oily liquid. this research was undertaken to asses, if application of non-biological aerosols reflects air filters capacity to collect particles of biological origin. the collection efficiency for non-biological aerosol was tested with the palas set and iso fine test dust. flow rate during the filtration process was 720 l/h, and particles size ranged 0.246-17.165 mum. the upstream and downstream concentration of the aerosol was measured with a laser particle counter pcs-2010. tested bioaerosol contained 4 bacterial strains of different shape and size: micrococcus luteus,micrococcus varians, pseudomonas putida and bacillus subtilis. number of the biological particles was estimated with a culture-based method. results obtained with bioaerosol did not confirmed 100% filters efficiency noted for the mineral test dust of the same aerodynamic diameter. maximum efficiency tested with bacterial cells was 99.8%. additionally, cells reemission from filters into air was also studied. bioaerosol contained 3 bacterial strains: micrococcus varians, pseudomonas putida and bacillus subtilis. it was proved that the highest intensity of the reemission process was during the first 5 min. and reached maximum 0.63% of total number of bacteria retained in filters. spherical cells adhered stronger to the filter fibres than cylindrical ones. it was concluded that non-biological aerosol containing particles of the same shape and surface characteristics (like dehs spherical particles) can not give representative results for all particles present in the filtered air.

TI  == survival of campylobacter jejuni under conditions of atmospheric oxygen tension with the support of pseudomonas spp.
AB  == campylobacter jejuni is a major food-borne pathogen. despite causing enteritis in humans, it is a well-adapted intestinal microorganism in animals, hardly ever generating disease symptoms. nevertheless, as a true microaerophilic microorganism it is still puzzling how campylobacter cells can survive on chicken meat, the main source of human infection. in this study, we demonstrate that c. jejuni is able to withstand conditions of atmospheric oxygen tension when cocultured with pseudomonas species, major food-spoiling bacteria that are frequently found on chicken meat in rather high numbers. using an in vitro survival assay, interactions of 145 c. jejuni wild-type strains and field isolates from chicken meat, broiler feces, and human clinical samples with type strains and food isolates of pseudomonas spp., proteus mirabilis, citrobacter freundii, micrococcus luteus, and enterococcus faecalis were studied. when inoculated alone or in coculture with proteus mirabilis, citrobacter freundii, micrococcus luteus, or enterococcus faecalis type strains, campylobacter cells were able to survive ambient oxygen levels for no more than 18 h. in contrast, campylobacter bacteria inoculated with type strains or wild-type isolates of pseudomonas showed a prolonged aerobic survival of up to >48 h. this microbial commensalism was diverse in c. jejuni isolates from different sources; isolates from chicken meat and humans in coculture with pseudomonas putida were able to use this survival support better than fecal isolates from broilers. scanning electron microscopy revealed the development of fiberlike structures braiding p.  putida and c. jejuni cells. hence, it seems that microaerophilic c. jejuni is able to survive ambient atmospheric oxygen tension by metabolic commensalism with pseudomonas spp. this bacterium-bacterium interaction might set the basis for survival of c. jejuni on chicken meat and thus be the prerequisite step in the pathway toward human infection.

TI  == monitoring the effects of chiral pharmaceuticals on aquatic microorganisms by metabolic fingerprinting.
AB  == the effects of the chiral pharmaceuticals atenolol and propranolol on pseudomonas putida, pseudomonas aeruginosa, micrococcus luteus, and blastomonas natatoria were investigated. the growth dynamics of exposed cultures were monitored using a bioscreen instrument. in addition, fourier-transform infrared (ft-ir) spectroscopy with appropriate chemometrics and high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc) were employed in order to investigate the phenotypic changes and possible degradation of the drugs in exposed cultures. for the majority of the bacteria studied there was not a statistically significant difference in the organism's phenotype when it was exposed to the different enantiomers or mixtures of enantiomers. in contrast, the pseudomonads appeared to respond differently to propranolol, and the two enantiomers had different effects on the cellular phenotype. this implies that there were different metabolic responses in the organisms when they were exposed to the different enantiomers. we suggest that our findings may indicate that there are widespread effects on aquatic communities in which active pharmaceutical ingredients are present.

TI  == resistance of bacterial biofilms formed on stainless steel surface to disinfecting agent.
AB  == the natural ability of microorganisms for adhesion and biofilm formation on various surfaces is one of the factors causing the inefficiency of a disinfection agent, despite its proven activity in vitro. the aim of the study was to determine the effectiveness of disinfecting substances on bacterial biofilms formed on stainless steel surface. a universally applied disinfecting agent was used in the tests. bacterial strains: listeria innocua, pseudomonas putida, micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus hominis strains, were isolated from food contact surfaces, after a cleaning and disinfection process. the disinfecting agent was a commercially available acid specimen based on hydrogen peroxide and peroxyacetic acid, the substance that was designed for food industry usage. model tests were carried out on biofilm formed on stainless steel (type 304, no 4 finish). biofilms were recorded by electron scanning microscope. the disinfecting agent in usable concentration, 0.5% and during 10 minutes was ineffective for biofilms. the reduction of cells in biofilms was only 1-2 logarithmic cycles. the use of the agent in higher concentration--1% for 30 minutes caused reduction of cell number by around 5 logarithmic cycles only in the case of one microorganism, m. luteus. for other types: l. innocua, p. putida, s. hominis, the requirements placed on disinfecting agents were not fulfilled. the results of experiments proved that bacterial biofilms are resistant to the disinfectant applied in its operational parameters. disinfecting effectiveness was achieved after twofold increase of the agent's concentration.

TI  == linear alkylbenzene sulfonate tolerance in bacteria isolated from sediment of tropical water bodies polluted with detergents.
AB  == the discharge of untreated detergent-bearing waste introduces linear alklcylbenzene sulfonates (las) to the aquatic environment. the surfactant persists in some streams and rivers in nigeria, some is adsorbed to suspended materials and end in the sediment of the receiving water bodies. in this study, bacteria isolated from sediments of some tropical detergent-effluent-polluted streams were tested for tolerance to las using the media dilution technique. las-tolerance was indicated by growth of the bacteria in the presence of the surfactant. the ph, concentrations of surfactant, population of heterotrophic bacteria and population of las-tolerant bacteria in the sediments were determined. a direct relationship (r = 0.9124) was found between the alkaline conditions (ph= 8.2-12.0) and high surfactant concentrations (45-132 mg/g) in the sediment. the sediments harboured a high population and a wide variety of bacteria; the populations of viable heterotrophic bacteria (vhb: 2.9 x 10(5) to 1.2 x 10(7) cfu/g) and las tolerant bacteria (ltb: 1.5 x 10(4) to 1.2 x 10(6) cfu/g) had a direct relationship (r = 0.9500). an inverse relationship resulted between each of them and the concentration of surfactant in the sediment, r(vhb/las) = -0.9303 and r(ltb/las) = -0.9143, respectively. twelve bacteria species were isolated from the sediment: alcaligenes odorans, bacillus subtilis,  burkholderia cepacia, citrobacter freundii, citrobacter diversus, escherichia coli, micrococcus luteus, micrococcus albus, pseudomonas putida, pseudomonas stutzeri, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcusfaecalis. most of them were adapted to the surfactant with their maximum acceptable concentrations ranging between 0.03 and >1.0% (w/v). the sediments could serve as source of adapted organisms which can be used in bio-treatment of las-bearing waste.

TI  == spring constants and adhesive properties of native bacterial biofilm cells measured by atomic force microscopy.
AB  == bacterial biofilms were imaged by atomic force microscopy (afm), and their elasticity and adhesion to the afm tip were determined from a series of tip extension and retraction cycles. though the five bacterial strains studied included both gram-negative and -positive bacteria and both environmental and laboratory strains, all formed simple biofilms on glass surfaces. cellular spring constants, determined from the extension portion of the force cycle, varied between 0.16+/-0.01 and 0.41+/-0.01 n/m, where larger spring constants were measured for gram-positive cells than for gram-negative cells. the nonlinear regime in the extension curve depended upon the biomolecules on the cell surface: the extension curves for the smooth gram-negative bacterial strains with the longest lipopolysaccharides on their surface had a larger nonlinear region than the rough bacterial strain with shorter lipopolysaccharides on the surface. adhesive forces between the retracting silicon nitride tip and the cells varied between cell types in terms of the force components, the distance components, and the number of adhesion events. the gram-negative cells' adhesion to the tip showed the longest distance components, sometimes more than 1 microm, whereas the shortest distance adhesion events were measured between the two gram-positive cell types and the tip. fixation of free-swimming planktonic cells by nhs and edc perturbed both the elasticity and the adhesive properties of the cells. here we consider the biochemical meaning of the measured physical properties of simple biofilms and implications to the colonization of surfaces in the first stages of  biofilm formation.

TI  == [study of ectoparasitism of ultramicrobacteria of the genus kaistia, strains nf1  and nf3 by electron and fluorescence microscopy].
AB  == transmission electron and fluorescence microscopy was used to study the character of the interaction of free-living ultramicrobacterial (umb) strains nf1 and nf3,  affiliated with the genus kaistia, and seven species of gram-positive and gram-negative heterotrophic bacteria. strains nf1 and nf3 were found to exhibit parasitic activity against gram-positive bacillus subtilis and gram-negative acidovorax delafildii. umb cells are tightly attached to the envelopes of the victim cells and induce their lysis, thus demonstrating the features of typical ectoparasitism. the selectivity of parasitism of the studied umb to the victim bacteria has been shown: only two soil microorganisms of the seven test objects,  b. subtilis atcc 6633 and an aerobic gram-negative bacterium a. delafildii 39, were found to be sensitive to umb attack. other bacteria (micrococcus luteus vkm  ac-2230, staphylococcus aureus 209-p, pseudomonas putida bs394, escherichia coli  c 600, and pantoea agglomerans atcc 27155) were not attacked by umb. it was established for the first time that free-living umb may be facultative parasites  not only of phototrophic bacteria, as we have previously demonstrated, but of heterotrophic bacteria as well. the umb under study seem to play an important role in the regulation of the quantity of microorganisms and in the functioning of microbial communities in some natural ecotopes.

TI  == resistance induction and enhanced tuber production by pre-inoculation with bacterial strains in potato plants against phytophthora infestans.
AB  == efficacy of resistance induction by the bacterial isolates pseudomonas putida (trl2-3), micrococcus luteus (trk2-2) and flexibacteraceae bacterium (mrl412), which were isolated from the rhizosphere of plants growing in jeju mountain, were tested in a greenhouse. the disease severity caused by phytophthora infestans was effectively reduced in the potato plants pre-inoculated with bacterial isolates compared with those of the untreated control plants growing in a greenhouse. in order to estimate the level of protection by the bacterial isolates, mancozeb wp  (diesen m(r), kyong nong) and dl-3-amino butyric acid (baba) were pre-treated, whereas dimethomorph wp (forum(r), kyong nong) and phosphonic acid (h3po3) were post-treated the challenge inoculation with the pathogen. disease severities of chemical pre-treated as well as post-treated plants were reduced compare to those of the untreated. the disease reduction in the plants pre-treated with mancozeb wp was the highest, whereas that of post-treated with dimethomorph wp was the lowest. the yields of plants pre-inoculated with three bacterial isolates were greatly increased than those of control plants. these results suggest that biological control by bacterial isolates might be an alternative strategy against late blight disease in potato plants growing in greenhouse.

TI  == observations of infection structures after inoculation with colletotrichum orbiculare on the leaves of cucumber plants pre-inoculated with two bacterial strains pseudomonas putida or micrococcus luteus.
AB  == infection structures were observed at the penetration sites on the leaves of cucumber plants inoculated with colletotrichum orbiculare using a fluorescence microscope. the cucumber plants were previously drenched with suspension of bacterial strains pseudomonas putida or micrococcus luteus. the plants pre-inoculated with both bacterial strains were resistant against anthracnose after inoculation with c. orbiculare. to investigate the resistance mechanism by  both bacterial strains, the surface of infected leaves was observed at the different time after challenge inoculation. at 3 days after inoculation there were no differences in the germination and appressorium formation of conidia of c. orbiculare as well as in the callose formation of the plants between both bacteria pre-inoculated and non-treated. at 5 days, the germination and appressorium formation of the fungal conidia were, however, significantly decreased on the leaves of plants pre-inoculated with m. luteus at the concentration with 1.0 x 10(7) cfu/ml. furthermore, callose formation of plants cells at the penetration sites was apparently increased. in contrast, there were  no defense reactions of the plants at the concentration with 1.0 x 10(6) cfu/ml of m. luteus. similarly, inoculation p. putida caused no plant resistance at the  low concentration, whereas increase of callose formation was observed at the higher concentration. the results of this study suggest that the resistant mechanisms might be differently expressed by the concentration of pre-treatment with bacterial suspension.

TI  == development of a rapid 1-h fluorescence-based cytotoxicity assay for listeria species.
AB  == listeria monocytogenes is cytotoxic to the lymphocyte-origin hybridoma ped-2e9 cell line. the relative cytotoxicity can be calculated by assaying the release of alkaline phosphatase (alp) from the infected cell line. in this study, a fluorogenic substrate (4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate, mup) was used to quantify  the alp activity. the assay is 3.5-fold more sensitive than the colorimetric-based assay and requires only 1 h to differentiate virulent from avirulent strains. in addition to various listeria species, 27 different common foodborne or clinical microorganisms were tested with the fluorescence-based cytotoxicity assay and only six cultures (bacillus cereus, citrobacter freundii,  serratia marcescens, pseudomonas putida, corynebacterium glutamicum and micrococcus luteus) showed cytotoxic effects similar to l. monocytogenes. to use  this assay as a confirmatory test for virulent l. monocytogenes suspect strains,  pure cultures must be isolated from the sample prior to testing.

TI  == construction of biofilms with defined internal architecture using dielectrophoresis and flocculation.
AB  == a novel approach was developed for the construction of biofilms with defined internal architecture using ac electrokinetics and flocculation. artificial structured microbial consortia (asmc) consisting of localized layered microcolonies of different cell types were formed by sequentially attracting different cell types to high field regions near microelectrodes using dielectrophoresis. stabilization of the microbial consortia on the electrode surface was achieved by crosslinking the cells using the flocculant polyethyleneimine (pei). consortia of escherichia coli, micrococcus luteus, and saccharomyces cerevisiae were made as model systems. also, more natural consortia were made of the bacteria pseudomonas putida, clavibacter michiganense, and methylobacterium mesophilum, which are found together in consortia during biodegradation of metal-cutting waste fluids.

TI  == isolation and characterization of is1409, an insertion element of 4-chlorobenzoate-degrading arthrobacter sp. strain tm1, and development of a system for transposon mutagenesis.
AB  == a new insertion element of 1,449 bp with 25-bp perfect terminal repeats, designated is1409, was identified in the chromosome of 4-chlorobenzoate-degrading arthrobacter sp. strain tm1 ncib12013. upon insertion, is1409 causes a target duplication of 8 bp. is1409 carries only a single open reading frame of 435 codons encoding the transposase tnpa. both tnpa and the overall organization of is1409 are highly similar to those of some related insertion elements of the isl3 group (j. mahillon and m. chandler, microbiol. mol. biol. rev. 62:725--774, 1998). is1409 was also found in other 4-chlorobenzoate-degrading arthrobacter strains and micrococcus luteus. based on is1409, a series of transposons carrying resistance genes for chloramphenicol and gentamicin were constructed. these transposons were used to demonstrate transposition events in vivo and to mutagenize arthrobacter sp. strains.

TI  == structure of the dnaa and dnaa-box region in the mycoplasma capricolum chromosome: conservation and variations in the course of evolution.
AB  == we have previously shown that the dnaa gene and the dnaa-box region were conserved in bacteria representative of all three major branches of the eubacterial phylogenic tree: high g + c gram+, low-g + c gram+ and gram-. in the  present work, we determined the structure of the dnaa region of mycoplasma capricolum and found that the dnaa gene and at least two other genes, rpmh and dnan, were conserved in this bacterium. an unusually high level of amino acid (aa) substitutions was observed in m. capricolum dnaa. it was the case even in those aa which were well conserved in other bacterial species. the nontranslatable region upstream from the dnaa gene was also conserved in this bacterium, as it was universally found in both gram+ and gram- bacteria. an additional nontranslatable region downstream from the dnaa gene, which is common  to gram+ bacteria, was also found in m. capricolum, consistent with the proposal  that m. capricolum is gram+ in origin. these regions were rich in a + t and contained ten dnaa-box-like sequences (9-mers that differ from ttatccaca by one or two bases).

TI  == structure and function of dnaa and the dnaa-box in eubacteria: evolutionary relationships of bacterial replication origins.
AB  == dnaa protein (a trans-acting element) and its binding sequence, dnaa-box: (a cis-acting element) are two elements essential for the initiation of chromosomal  replication in escherichia coli and other enteric bacteria. recently these two elements have been found to be conserved in three gram-positive bacteria (bacillus subtilis, micrococcus luteus and mycoplasma capricolum) as well as in gram-negative pseudomonads. dnaa protein was also found to be essential in the initiation of the replication of the b. subtilis chromosome, and regions containing multiple repeats of dnaa-box (dnaa-box region) are found to be active  as autonomously replicating elements both in b. subtilis and pseudomonads. in this microreview we compare first the structures of these dnaa-box regions and their locations on the chromosome and then functional aspects of dnaa protein and dnaa-box regions in the initiation and regulation of chromosomal replication. from these observations we propose evolutionary relationships between replication origins of eubacteria.

AB  == a phylogenetic tree constructed by 5s rrna analysis is composed of three major branches in eubacteria: high g + c gram+, low g + c gram+ and gram- [hori and osawa, mol. biol. evol. 4 (1987) 445-472]. we have shown that the characteristic  dnaa region is common among escherichia coli (gram-), pseudomonas putida (gram-), and bacillus subtilis (low g + c gram+). we have now determined the structure of  the dnaa region of micrococcus luteus, as a representative of the last branch, high g + c gram+. the dnaa gene and at least three other genes, rnpa, rpmh and dnan were found to be conserved in m. luteus. large nontranslatable regions were  found flanking the dnaa gene. the upstream region is conserved in the four bacteria so far examined. on the other hand, the downstream region is conserved only in gram+ bacteria, m. luteus and b. subtilis. the consensus sequence of the  dnaa box in m. luteus seems to be ttgtccaca, in contrast to ttatccaca of other bacteria. these results confirm our hypothesis that the dnaa region is the replication origin of the ancestral bacteria and that the essential feature of the dnaa protein and dnaa-box combination is conserved in eubacteria.
