TI  == bacteriocin production and gene sequencing analysis from vaginal lactobacillus strains.
AB  == the human vagina is a complex and dynamic ecosystem containing an abundance of microorganisms. in women of childbearing age, this system is dominated by lactobacillus spp. in the present work, seventeen newly isolated vaginal strains  were identified by 16s rdna sequencing and were investigated for their antimicrobial properties. twelve of the isolated lactobacillus strains showed activity against one or more microorganisms. six and five of them produced substances that inhibited the growth of two different klebsiella strains and staphylococcus aureus, respectively. two lactobacilli strains were active against an escherichia coli strain, one isolate was active against an enterococus faecalis strain and another lactobacilli strain showed antimicrobial activity against a candida parapsilosis strain. the nature of the active compounds was additionally studied, and the presence of bacteriocin-like substances was proved. the genes related to the bacteriocin production in three of the newly isolated strains were identified and sequenced. the presence of gassericin a operon in the genome of the species lactobacillus crispatus was described for the first time. the presence of antimicrobial activity contributes to their possible use as potential probiotic strains after further research.

TI  == [lactobacillus inhibit adhesion of staphylococcus aureus to hela cells].
AB  == to assess the ability of the previously selected human vaginal isolates of lactobacillus crispatus (l. crispatus) t79-3, t90-1 and lactobacillus jensenii (l. jensenii) t118-3, t231-1 to inhibit the growth of staphylococcus aureus and block their adhesion to hela cells. the inhibitory bioactive substances produced  by these lactobacillus were also identified. inhibitory substances interaction tests were carried out by using a streak-diffusion method on agar plates. three types of interaction were performed to determine the inhibitory effect of lactobacillus on adhesion of staphylococcus aureus to hela cells: exclusion group (lactobacillus and hela followed by pathogens), competition group (lactobacillus, hela and pathogens together) and displacement group (pathogens and hela followed  by the addition of lactobacillus). the number of hela cells adhered to staphylococcus aureus was quantified by bacteria colony counts on lb plate. the results showed that lactic acids produced by the lactobacillus are the main substances that can inhibit staphylococcus aureus growth and there is variation among the three types of interaction regarding the inhibitory activity against staphylococcus aureus. the effects of lactobacillus on blocking the adhesion to hela cells were concentration dependent. all four lactobacillus isolates displayed the ability to inhibit staphylococcus aureus growth and block staphylococcus aureus adherence to hela cells. exclusion group was the most effective, and t79-3 showed greater capacity to block staphylococcus aureus adherence compared with the other three isolates. the present study suggests the  potential ability of l. crispatus t79-3 as probiotic for the treatment and prevention of urogenital infections in women.

TI  == adhesion forces and coaggregation between vaginal staphylococci and lactobacilli.
AB  == urogenital infections are the most common ailments afflicting women. they are treated with dated antimicrobials whose efficacy is diminishing. the process of infection involves pathogen adhesion and displacement of indigenous lactobacillus crispatus and lactobacillus jensenii. an alternative therapeutic approach to antimicrobial therapy is to reestablish lactobacilli in this microbiome through probiotic administration. we hypothesized that lactobacilli displaying strong adhesion forces with pathogens would facilitate coaggregation between the two strains, ultimately explaining the elimination of pathogens seen in vivo. using atomic force microscopy, we found that adhesion forces between lactobacilli and three virulent toxic shock syndrome toxin 1-producing staphylococcus aureus strains, were significantly stronger (2.2-6.4 nn) than between staphylococcal pairs (2.2-3.4 nn), especially for the probiotic lactobacillus reuteri rc-14 (4.0-6.4 nn) after 120 s of bond-strengthening. moreover, stronger adhesion forces resulted in significantly larger coaggregates. adhesion between the bacteria occurred instantly upon contact and matured within one to two minutes, demonstrating the potential for rapid anti-pathogen effects using a probiotic. coaggregation is one of the recognized mechanisms through which lactobacilli can  exert their probiotic effects to create a hostile micro-environment around a pathogen. with antimicrobial options fading, it therewith becomes increasingly important to identify lactobacilli that bind strongly with pathogens.

TI  == lactobacillus species shift in distal esophagus of high-fat-diet-fed rats.
AB  == aim: to analyze the microbiota shift in the distal esophagus of sprague-dawley rats fed a high-fat diet. methods: twenty sprague-dawley rats were divided into high-fat diet and normal control groups of 10 rats each. the composition of microbiota in the mucosa from the distal esophagus was analyzed based on selective culture. a variety of lactobacillus species were identified by molecular biological techniques. bacterial dna from lactobacillus colonies was extracted, and 16s rdna was amplified by pcr using bacterial universal primers. the amplified 16s rdna products were separated by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). every single band was purified from the gel and sent to be sequenced. results: based on mucosal bacterial culturing in the distal esophagus, staphylococcus aureus was absent, and total anaerobes and lactobacillus species were decreased significantly in the high-fat diet group compared with the normal control group (p < 0.01). detailed dgge analysis on the  composition of lactobacillus species in the distal esophagus revealed that lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus gasseri (l. gasseri) and lactobacillus reuteri (l. reuteri) comprised the lactobacillus species in the high-fat diet group, while the composition of lactobacillus species in the normal control group consisted of l. gasseri, lactobacillus jensenii and l. reuteri. conclusion: high-fat diet led to a mucosal microflora shift in the distal esophagus in rats,  especially the composition of lactobacillus species.

TI  == antagonistic potential against pathogenic microorganisms and hydrogen peroxide production of indigenous lactobacilli isolated from vagina of chinese pregnant women.
AB  == objective: to investigate the indigenous lactobacilli from the vagina of pregnant women and to screen the isolates with antagonistic potential against pathogenic microorganisms. methods: the strains were isolated from pregnant women's vagina and identified using the api50ch system. the ability of the isolates to produce hydrogen peroxide was analyzed semi-quantitatively using the tmb-hrp-mrs agar. the antagonistic effects of the isolates on pathogenic microorganisms were determined with a double layer agar plate. results: one hundred and three lactobacilli strains were isolated from 60 samples of vaginal secretion from healthy pregnant women. among them, 78 strains could produce hydrogen peroxide, in which 68%, 80%, 80%, and 88% had antagonistic effects against candida albicans cmcc98001, staphylococcus aureus cmcc26003, escherichia coli cmcc44113, and pseudomonas aeruginosa cmcc10110, respectively. conclusion: the recovery of hydrogen peroxide-producing lactobacilli decreases with the increasing pregnant age and time. the most commonly isolated species from vagina of chinese pregnant  women are lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus crispatus. most of l. acidophilus and l. crispatus produce a high h2o2 level.

TI  == quantitative survival of aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms in port-a-cul and copan transport systems.
AB  == transport media should preserve the viability and stability of microorganisms in  clinical specimens. in this study, the port-a-cul transport system and the copan  transport system without charcoal, both designed to preserve anaerobes, were evaluated. dacron swabs were inoculated with two combinations of facultative and  anaerobic organisms typically found in vaginal swab samples. combination i contained candida albicans, escherichia coli, enterococcus spp., group b streptococci, lactobacillus crispatus, and staphylococcus aureus. combination ii  contained lactobacillus iners, peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus, mycoplasma hominis, prevotella bivia, prevotella corporis, porphyromonas asaccharolytica, mobiluncus curtisii, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and gardnerella vaginalis. duplicate swabs were placed into the two transporters and held for 24, 48, 72, and 96 h at 4 and 24 degrees c. both transporters maintained the viability of organisms better at 4 degrees c than at 24 degrees c. prevotella bivia and prevotella corporis had a loss of viability in both transporters at both temperatures. however, at 24 degrees c, there was a significantly greater loss of viability for mycoplasma hominis, prevotella bivia, prevotella corporis, and peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus when the organisms were stored in copan transport  medium than when they were stored in port-a-cul transport medium for 96 h (p < 0.002). some organisms proliferated in the transport media, but when transporters were held at 24 degrees c for 96 h, a significantly greater increase in the concentrations of group b streptococci and candida albicans, escherichia coli, and enterococcus spp. organisms in copan medium than in port-a-cul medium was observed (p < 0.002). at room temperature, the port-a-cul system is superior to the copan system with respect to the preservation of fastidious microorganisms and the prevention of the proliferation of facultative organisms.

TI  == lactobacillus isolates from weaned piglets' mucosa with inhibitory activity against common porcine pathogens.
AB  == twelve lactobacilli isolates from mucosa of 3-5-week-old weaned pigs were found to exert good antimicrobial activity against common porcine pathogens (s. aureus, b. cereus, e. coli, c. perfringens). two of them produced in addition to lactic acid also considerable amounts of acetic acid, and 6 of them produced hydrogen peroxide and metabolites other than organic acids. isolates 4/26 and 2/25 (identified as l. crispatus or l. amylovorus) were inhibitory against most strains of s. aureus, b. cereus and e. coli, and especially the strain 4/26 survived well in simulated gastric and intestinal juice. diarrhea-causing e. coli o8k88h9 ent(+) was successfully inhibited by the growing culture as well as by the catalase-treated and neutralized supernatant of l. reuteri 12/26. mucin degradation and multiple resistance to antibiotics were not observed.

TI  == enolases from gram-positive bacterial pathogens and commensal lactobacilli share  functional similarity in virulence-associated traits.
AB  == enolase occurs as a cytoplasmic and a surface-associated protein in bacteria. enolases of the bacterial pathogens streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae and staphylococcus aureus, as well as of the commensal lactic acid bacteria, lactobacillus crispatus and lactobacillus johnsonii, were purified as his(6)-fusion proteins from recombinant escherichia coli. the fusion proteins were compared for putative virulence-associated functions, i.e., binding of human plasminogen, enhancement of plasminogen activation by human plasminogen activators, as well as binding to immobilized laminin, fibronectin and collagens. the individual enolases showed varying efficiencies in these functions. in particular, highly and equally effective interactions with plasminogen and laminin were seen with lactobacillar and staphylococcal enolases.

TI  == simultaneous display of multiple foreign peptides in the flid capping and flic filament proteins of the escherichia coli flagellum.
AB  == the bacterial flagellum is composed of more than 20 different proteins. the filament, which constitutes the major extracellular part of the flagellum, is built up of approximately 20,000 flic molecules that assemble at the growing distal end of the filament. a capping structure composed of five flid molecules located at the tip of the filament promotes polymerization of flic. lack of flid  leads to release of the subunits into the growth medium. we show here that flid can be successfully used in bacterial surface display. we tested various insertion sites in the capping protein, and the optimal region for display was at the variable region in flid. deletion and/or insertion at other sites resulted in decreased formation of flagella. we further developed the technique into a multihybrid display system in which three foreign peptides are simultaneously expressed within the same flagellum, i.e., d repeats of fnbpa from staphylococcus aureus at the tip and fragments of yada from yersinia enterocolitica as well as slpa from lactobacillus crispatus along the filament. this technology can have biotechnological applications, e.g., in simultaneous delivery of several effector molecules.

TI  == inhibition of staphylococcus aureus by the commensal bacteria of human milk.
AB  == aims: to study the bacterial diversity in expressed human milk with a focus on detecting bacteria with an antimicrobial activity against staphylococcus aureus,  known as a causative agent of maternal breast infections and neonatal infections. methods and results: random isolates (n = 509) were collected from breast milk samples (n = 40) of healthy lactating women, genotypically identified, and tested for antimicrobial activity against staph. aureus. commensal staphylococci (64%) and oral streptococci (30%), with staph. epidermidis, strep. salivarius, and strep. mitis as the most frequent isolates, were the predominant bacterial species in breast milk. one-fifth of staph. epidermidis and half of strep. salivarius isolates suppressed growth of staph. aureus. enterococci (ent. faecalis), isolated from 7.5% of samples, and lactic acid bacteria (lab) (lactobacillus rhamnosus, lact. crispatus, lactococcus lactis, leuconoctoc mesenteroides), isolated from 12.5% of samples, were also effective against staph. aureus. one l. lactis isolate was shown to produce nisin, a bacteriocin used in food industry to prevent bacterial pathogens and spoilage. conclusions: expressed breast milk contains commensal bacteria, which inhibit staph. aureus. significance and impact of the study: the strains inhibitory against the pathogen staph. aureus have potential use as bacteriotherapeutic agents in preventing neonatal and maternal breast infections caused by this bacterium.

TI  == comparison of the growth and hydrogen peroxide production by vaginal probiotic lactobacilli under different culture conditions.
AB  == objective: the purpose of this study was to determine the optimal conditions for  the growth and hydrogen peroxide production by vaginal lactobacilli. study design: two vaginal lactobacillus strains were cultured under different growth conditions (temperature, ph, agitation, and growth media) with a fractional factorial experimental design. results: the optimal growth conditions of lactobacillus paracasei crl (centro de referencia para lactobacilus culture collection) 1289 and lactobacillus crispatus crl 1266 were temperature 37 degrees c and initial ph 6.5, nonagitated cultures, in autolysat de levure; peptone, tryptone, tween 80 et glucose (laptg) broth for l paracasei or in de man-rogosa-sharpe (mrs) and laptg broths for l crispatus. the hydrogen peroxide production, detected only in agitated cultures, was higher at 37 degrees c and ph 6.5. the oxidative metabolite produced the self-inhibition of the lactobacilli growth. in mixed cultures of lactobacilli and staphylococcus aureus under the optimal conditions of hydrogen peroxide production, the pathogen growth was inhibited. conclusion: the results provided information about the factors that affect the hydrogen peroxide production and about the most favorable conditions with which to obtain the highest biomass in the shortest possible time.

TI  == assessment of the capacity of lactobacillus to inhibit the growth of uropathogens and block their adhesion to vaginal epithelial cells.
AB  == to gain insight into the mechanisms by which lactobacillus blocks the adherence of uropathogens to vaginal epithelial cells and inhibits their growth, 15 lactobacillus strains and 22 uropathogens were studied. lactobacilli from hemagglutination group iii, identified as lactobacillus crispatus, showed greater capacity to block uropathogen adherence than those from hemagglutination groups ii and i (61.9%, 49.5%, and 52.6% of blockage, respectively). pseudomonas aeruginosa pa5 and klebsiella pneumoniae kp7 were the uropathogens most susceptible to blockage, and staphylococcus aureus sa11 and proteus mirabilis pm1 were the most resistant. lactobacillus inhibited uropathogen growth better in liquid assays; the 3 lactobacillus groups showed similar inhibitory power (72.3%, 71.9%, and 74.2% of light transmittance). p. aeruginosa pa5 was the most inhibited, and enterococcus species e15 was the least inhibited. there is considerable variation among lactobacillus strains regarding their adherence to uroepithelium, blockage of uropathogen attachment, and inhibition of uropathogen  growth. although these properties are independent, they may coincide and therefore allow for these strains to balance the vaginal ecosystem and to make them useful as probiotics.

TI  == selection of vaginal h2o2-generating lactobacillus species for probiotic use.
AB  == lactobacilli are believed to contribute to the control of the vaginal microflora  by different mechanisms such as production of antagonistic substances like lactic acid, bacteriocins, and h2o2. this paper describes the selection of h2o2-generating lactobacilli among 35 hydrophobic isolates from the human vagina. lactobacillus crispatus f117, which generated the highest h2o2 level, was chosen  to study: (a) the kinetics of h2o2 production considering different culture conditions, and (b) the effect of this metabolite on the growth of urogenital tract pathogens. the levels of h2o2 in l. crispatus supernatant increased during  its growth and were maximum at the early stationary phase (3.29 mmol h2o2 l-1) under aerated conditions (agitated cultures). in nonagitated cultures there were  no detectable levels of h2o2. l. crispatus f117 spent supernatant inhibited staphylococcus aureus growth in plaque assay. inhibition was due to h2o2 since catalase treatment of the supernatant suppressed inhibition. in mixed cultures performed with l. crispatus and s. aureus a significant decrease in pathogen growth was observed. the inhibitory effect depended on the initial inoculum of s. aureus. further evaluation of the properties of l. crispatus f117 will be performed to consider its inclusion in a probiotic for local use in the vaginal tract.
