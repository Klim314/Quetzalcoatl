TI  == [bacterially conditioned thromboembolism in dairy cows--a retrospective study of  31 necropsy cases with special consideration of the causative complex].
AB  == a study of 340 necropsied dairy cattle from northern bavaria resulted in 31 animals (9%) showing evidence of pyemic thromboembolism. the most frequent pathomorphologic lesions consisted in endocarditis valvularis thromboticans of the tricuspid and/or mitral valve (21), embolic pneumonia (26), nephritis (13) and renal infarction (12). the most common isolate found in bacteriologic culture was arcanobacterium pyogenes in 26 of 31 cases, followed by staphylococcus aureus (2), mannheimia haemolytica (2) and streptococcus bovis (1) in rare cases. in 27  of 31 cows a possible cause of pyemic thromboembolism was found; in 23 cases claw diseases and decubital ulcera were probably responsible.

TI  == clinical evaluation of postpartum vaginal mucus reflects uterine bacterial infection and the immune response in cattle.
AB  == bacteria contaminate the uterus of most dairy cattle after parturition and endometritis causes infertility. an endometritis score can be ascribed based on the vaginal mucus character and odour but it is not clear if the clinical score reflects the number of uterine bacteria or the inflammatory response. the present study tested the hypothesis that clinical evaluation of endometritis reflects the number of bacteria present in the uterus, and the acute phase protein response. swabs (n = 328) were collected from the uterine lumen of dairy cattle, 21 and 28  days postpartum, vaginal mucus was scored for character and odour, and blood samples collected for acute phase protein measurement. bacteria were identified following aerobic and anaerobic culture, and the bacterial growth density was scored semi-quantitatively. when bacteria were categorised by their expected pathogenic potential in the uterus, purulent or fetid odour vaginal mucus was associated with the growth density of pathogenic bacteria but not opportunist contaminants. when bacteria were analysed independently, arcanobacterium pyogenes, proteus and fusobacterium necrophorum growth densities were associated  with mucopurulent or purulent vaginal mucus. the bacterial growth densities for a. pyogenes, escherichia coli, non-hemolytic streptococci, and mannheimia haemolytica were associated with a fetid mucus odour. peripheral plasma concentrations of alpha(1)-acid glycoprotein were higher if there was a fetid compared with a normal vaginal mucus odour (1.50 +/- 0.09 mg/ml versus 1.05 +/- 0.02 mg/ml, p < 0.001), but did not differ significantly between vaginal mucus character scores. the evaluation of the character and odour of vaginal mucus reflects the number of bacteria in the uterus, and the acute phase protein response.

TI  == biofilm bacteria: formation and comparative susceptibility to antibiotics.
AB  == the calgary biofilm device (cbd) was used to form bacterial biofilms of selected  veterinary gram-negative and gram-positive pathogenic bacteria from cattle, sheep, pigs, chicken, and turkeys. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum biofilm eradication concentration (mbec) of ampicillin, ceftiofur, cloxacillin, oxytetracycline, penicillin g, streptomycin, tetracycline, enrofloxacin, erythromycin, gentamicin, tilmicosin, and trimethoprim-sulfadoxine  for gram-positive and -negative bacteria were determined. bacterial biofilms were readily formed on the cbd under selected conditions. the biofilms consisted of micro-colonies encased in extracellular polysaccharide material. biofilms composed of arcanobacterium (actinomyces) pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus hyicus, streptococcus agalactiae, corynebacterium renale, or corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis were not killed by the antibiotics tested but  as planktonic bacteria they were sensitive at low concentrations. biofilm and planktonic streptococcus dysgalactiae and streptococcus suis were sensitive to penicillin, ceftiofur, cloxacillin, ampicillin, and oxytetracycline. planktonic escherichia coli were sensitive to enrofloxacin, gentamicin, oxytetracycline and  trimethoprim/ sulfadoxine. enrofloxacin and gentamicin were the most effective antibiotics against e. coli growing as a biofilm. salmonella spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates growing as planktonic populations were sensitive to enrofloxacin, gentamicin, ampicillin, oxytetracycline, and trimethoprim/sulfadoxine, but as a biofilm, these bacteria were only sensitive to enrofloxacin. planktonic and biofilm pasteurella multocida and mannheimia haemolytica had similar antibiotic sensitivity profiles and were sensitive to most of the antibiotics tested. the cbd provides a valuable new technology that can be used to select antibiotics that are able to kill bacteria growing as biofilms.

TI  == [pneumonia in calves: characterization of the bacterial spectrum and the resistance patterns to antimicrobial drugs].
AB  == the population under study included young calves with pneumonia (group a, n = 13) and their controls (group b, n = 9), as well as older calves from which the lungs with (group c, n = 90) or without (group d, n = 10) lesions were collected after  slaughter. arcanobacterium pyogenes was the organism most commonly isolated from  calves in group a (46%), followed by haemophilus somnus (23%), mannheimia haemolytica (15%), streptococcus suis and pasteurella multocida (7.7% each). only s. suis (22%) and p. multocida (11%) were found in group b. p. multocida was isolated from 32% group c calves, h. somnus from 11%, a. pyogenes from 7.8%, m. haemolytica from 2.2% and s. suis from 1.1%. no specific pathogens were isolated  in group d. prevalence of mycoplasma bovis infection was 69% in group a and 37% in group c. ninety-eight strains were tested for resistance to antibiotics. resistance to penicillin and ampicillin was present only in m. haemolytica (46%). high percentages of resistant strains were observed for streptomycin (48-100%), tetracycline (15-43%), sulfonamides alone (14-100%) or in combination with trimethoprim (0-100%). therapeutic approaches to bacterial calf pneumonia in the  area under study should be modified according to the isolated bacterial population, the observed antimicrobial resistances and the growing importance of  mycoplasma bovis.
