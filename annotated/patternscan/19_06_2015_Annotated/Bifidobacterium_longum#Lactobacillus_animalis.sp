TI  == immune modulating capability of two exopolysaccharide-producing bifidobacterium strains in a wistar rat model.
AB  == fermented dairy products are the usual carriers for the delivery of probiotics to humans, bifidobacterium and lactobacillus being the most frequently used bacteria. in this work, the strains bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis ipla r1 and bifidobacterium longum ipla e44 were tested for their capability to modulate immune response and the insulin-dependent glucose homeostasis using male wistar rats fed with a standard diet. three intervention groups were fed daily for 24 days with 10% skimmed milk, or with 10(9) cfu of the corresponding strain  suspended in the same vehicle. a significant increase of the suppressor-regulatory tgf- beta cytokine occurred with both strains in comparison with a control (no intervention) group of rats; the highest levels were reached in rats fed ipla r1. this strain presented an immune protective profile, as it was able to reduce the production of the proinflammatory il-6. moreover, phosphorylated akt kinase decreased in gastroctemius muscle of rats fed the strain ipla r1, without affecting the glucose, insulin, and homa index in blood,  or levels of glut-4 located in the membrane of muscle and adipose tissue cells. therefore, the strain b. animalis subsp. lactis ipla r1 is a probiotic candidate  to be tested in mild grade inflammation animal models.

TI  == the diversity of intestinal microbiota of mongolians living in inner mongolia, china.
AB  == the mongolian nationality has developed their unique lifestyle and dietary habit  for thousands of years. however, by now, little research has been focused on mongolian gut microbiota and how it is related to different dietary habits. in this study, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qpcr) methods were applied to reveal the diversity of  predominant gut bacteria of 48 healthy mongolians recruited from hohhot city and  the xilin gol pasturing area in inner mongolia. compared to similar studies of other nationalities, results from the present study have confirmed that the composition of mongolian gut microbiota is highly similar at the phylum level (firmicutes, bacteroidetes, proteobacteria and actinobacteria) but variable at the genus level. especially, the numbers of phascolarctobacterium, lactobacillus  and bifidobacterium are rather high. dgge profiles of lactobacillus and bifidobacterium revealed that lactobacillus casei, bifidobacterium longum and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis were predominant in the gut of the mongolian subjects studied. on the contrary, lactobacillus helveticus was detected in every pasturing area mongolian, but not in any of the hohhot city mongolians. qpcr results revealed that the numbers of lactobacillus and bifidobacterium of xilin gol mongolians were significantly higher (p<0.05) than that of hohhot mongolians, whereas the numbers of enterobacterium were significantly lower (p<0.05). in addition, by partial least squares discriminate  analysis and cluster analysis of data generated from dgge and qpcr experiments, a striking difference in the composition of intestinal microbiota of mongolians living in hohhot city and the xilin gol pasturing area has been found. this study clearly shows that diet affects the microbiota composition of mongolians living in different circumstances, i.e. urban versus rural.

TI  == synergistic antibacterial efficacies of the combination of bovine lactoferrin or  its hydrolysate with probiotic secretion in curbing the growth of meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == the occurrence of multidrug-resistant or meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) has become an important issue in clinics. this study evaluated a combinatorial treatment approach by using the well-documented antibacterial protein apo-bovine lactoferrin (apo-blf) or its hydrolysate and specific probiotic supernatants for controlling mrsa infection. clinical mrsa strains were isolated from different patient specimens. apo-blf-hydrolysate possessed stronger anti-mrsa activity than complete blf in that it inhibited the growth of most mrsa strains tested in vitro. otherwise, the supernatants produced by lactobacillus fermentum (atcc 11739), bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum (atcc 15707) and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis (bcrc 17394) inhibited the growth of various mrsa strains. further, l. fermentum or b. animalis subsp. lactis supernatant plus apo-blf or blf-hydrolysate led to partially synergistic to synergistic growth-inhibitory activity against mrsa strains. however, l. fermentum and not b. animalis subsp. lactis or b. longum subsp. longum was observed to resist the antibacterial activity of both apo-lf and blf-hydrolysate. therefore, it is suggested that l. fermentum could be the best candidate to be used with apo-blf or blf-hydrolysate as a live supplement against mrsa infections.

TI  == in vitro growth of four individual human gut bacteria on oligosaccharides produced by chemoenzymatic synthesis.
AB  == the present study aimed at examining oligosaccharides (os) for potential stimulation of probiotic bacteria. nineteen structurally well-defined candidate os covering groups of beta-glucosides, alpha-glucosides and alpha-galactosides with degree of polymerization 2-4 were prepared in >100 mg amounts by chemoenzymatic synthesis (i.e. reverse phosphorolysis or transglycosylation). fourteen of the os are not naturally occurring and five (beta-d-glucosyl-fructose, beta-d-glucosyl-xylitol, alpha-glucosyl-(1,4)-d-mannose, alpha-glucosyl-(1,4)-d-xylose; alpha-glucosyl-(1,4)-l-fucose) have recently been synthesized for the first time. these os have not been previously tested for effects of bacterial growth and here the ability of all 19 os to support growth of four gastrointestinal bacteria: three probiotic bacteria bifidobacterium lactis, bifidobacterium longum, and lactobacillus acidophilus, and one commensal bacterium, bacteroides vulgatus has  been evaluated in monocultures. the disaccharides beta-d-glucosyl-xylitol and beta-d-glucosyl-(1,4)-xylose noticeably stimulated growth yields of l. acidophilus ncfm, and additionally, beta-d-glucosyl-(1,4)-xylose stimulated b. longum bl-05. alpha-glucosyl-(1,4)-glucosamine and alpha-glucosyl-(1,4)-n-acetyl-glucosamine enhanced the growth rate of b. animalis subsp. lactis and b. longum bl-05, whereas l. acidophilus ncfm and bac. vulgatus  did not grow on these os. alpha-galactosyl-(1,6)-alpha-galactosyl-(1,6)-glucose advanced the growth rate of b. animalis subsp. lactis and l. acidophilus ncfm. thus several of the structurally well-defined os supported growth of beneficial gut bacteria. this reflects a broad specificity of their sugar transporters for os, including specificity for non-naturally occurring os, hence showing promise for design of novel prebiotics.

TI  == effect of probiotics lactobacillus and bifidobacterium on gut-derived lipopolysaccharides and inflammatory cytokines: an in vitro study using a human colonic microbiota model.
AB  == gut-derived lipopolysaccharides (lps) are critical to the development and progression of chronic low-grade inflammation and metabolic diseases. in this study, the effects of probiotics lactobacillus and bifidobacterium on gut-derived lipopolysaccharide and inflammatory cytokine concentrations were evaluated using  a human colonic microbiota model. lactobacillus reuteri, l. rhamnosus, l. plantarum, bifidobacterium animalis, b. bifidum, b. longum, and b. longum subsp.  infantis were identified from the literature for their anti-inflammatory potential. each bacterial culture was administered daily to a human colonic microbiota model during 14 days. colonic lipopolysaccharides, and gram-positive and negative bacteria were quantified. raw 264.7 macrophage cells were stimulated with supernatant from the human colonic microbiota model. concentrations of tnf-alpha, il-1beta, and il-4 cytokines were measured. lipopolysaccharide concentrations were significantly reduced with the administration of b. bifidum (-46.45 +/- 5.65%), l. rhamnosus (-30.40 +/- 5.08%), b. longum (-42.50 +/- 1.28%), and b. longum subsp. infantis (-68.85 +/- 5.32%) (p < 0.05). cell counts  of gram-negative and positive bacteria were distinctly affected by the probiotic  administered. there was a probiotic strain-specific effect on immunomodulatory responses of raw 264.7 macrophage cells. b. longum subsp. infantis demonstrated higher capacities to reduce tnf-alpha concentrations (-69.41 +/- 2.78%; p < 0.05) and to increase il-4 concentrations (+16.50 +/- 0.59%; p < 0.05). colonic lipopolysaccharides were significantly correlated with tnf-alpha and il-1beta concentrations (p < 0.05). these findings suggest that specific probiotic bacteria, such as b. longum subsp. infantis, might decrease colonic lipopolysaccharide concentrations, which might reduce the proinflammatory tone. this study has noteworthy applications in the field of biotherapeutics for the prevention and/or treatment of inflammatory and metabolic diseases.

TI  == probiotics in milk replacer influence lamb immune function and meat quality.
AB  == this study was undertaken to assess the effect of milk replacer (mr) containing lactobacillus acidophilus and a mix of bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis and bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum on lamb immune response and on lamb meat quality. a 6-week-trial was conducted on 40 male comisana lambs, divided into four groups, fed maternal milk (mm), mr, mr with l. acidophilus supplementation (mrl) and mr with a mix (1 : 1) of b. animalis subsp. lactis and b. longum subsp. longum supplementations (mrb). lambs fed mr containing a mix of bifidobacteria showed the highest in vivo cellular immune response to phytohemagglutinin, whereas mm and mrb showed the highest antibody response to ovalbumin. at day 11 of the trial, mrl displayed the highest value of interleukin-10; differences disappeared among groups subsequently. blood cholesterol levels in lambs fed mr containing l. acidophilus was almost halved compared with that found in mm and mr groups. meat from artificially reared lambs was characterized by trans-11 18:1 and total conjugated 18:2n-6, whereas meat from the dam-suckled lambs was characterized by 14:0, cis-9 14:1 and 16:0. polyunsaturated to saturated fatty acid ratio was higher in meat of mr, mrl and mrb than in mm lambs. meat from artificially reared lamb fed mr containing probiotics showed an improved fatty acid profile for human diet.

TI  == screening of species-specific lactic acid bacteria for veal calves multi-strain probiotic adjuncts.
AB  == the selection of promising specific species of lactic acid bacteria with potential probiotic characteristics is of particular interest in producing multi  species-specific probiotic adjuncts in veal calves rearing. the aim of the present work was to select and evaluate in vitro the functional activity of lactic acid bacteria, bifidobacterium longum and bacillus coagulans strains isolated from veal calves in order to assess their potential use as multi species-specific probiotics for veal calves. for this purpose, bacterial strains  isolated from faeces collected from 40 healthy 50-day-calves, were identified by  riboprinter and 16s rrna gene sequence. the most frequent strains belonged to the species b. longum, streptococcus bovis, lactobacillus animalis and streptococcus  macedonicus. among these, 7 strains were chosen for testing their probiotic characteristics in vitro. three strains, namely l. animalis sb310, lactobacillus  paracasei subsp. paracasei sb137 and b. coagulans sb117 showed varying individual but promising capabilities to survive in the gastrointestinal tract, to adhere, to produce antimicrobial compounds. these three selected species-specific bacteria demonstrated in vitro, both singularly and mixed, the functional properties needed for their use as potential probiotics in veal calves.

TI  == use of tuf gene-based primers for the pcr detection of probiotic bifidobacterium  species and enumeration of bifidobacteria in fermented milk by cultural and quantitative real-time pcr methods.
AB  == due to the increasing use of bifidobacteria in probiotic products, it is essential to establish a rapid method for the qualitative and quantitative assay  of the bifidobacteria in commercial products. in this study, partial sequences of the tuf gene for 18 bifidobacterium strains belonging to 14 species were determined. alignment of these sequences showed that the similarities among these bifidobacterium species were 82.24% to 99.72%. based on these tuf gene sequences, 6 primer sets were designed for the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay of b. animalis subsp. animalis, b. animalis subsp. lactis, b. bifidum, b. breve, b. longum subsp. infantis, b. longum subsp. longum, and the genus of bifidobacterium, respectively. these bifidobacterium species are common probiotic species present in dairy and probiotic products. when each target bifidobacterium spp. was assayed with the designed primers, pcr product with expected size was generated. in addition, for each target species, more than 70 bacterial strains other than the target species, including strains of other bifidobacterium species, strains of lactobacillus spp., enterococcus spp., and other bacterial species, all generated negative results. pcr assay with primers specific to b. animalis subsp. lactis and b. longum subsp. longum confirmed the presence of these bifidobacterium species in commercial yogurt products. in addition, for each product, enumeration of the bifidobacteria cells by culture method with bim-25 agar and the quantitative real-time pcr showed similar cell counts. such results indicated that within 15-d storage (4 degrees c) after manufacture, all the bifidobacteria cells originally present in yogurt products were viable and culturable during the storage.

TI  == predominant genera of fecal microbiota in children with atopic dermatitis are not altered by intake of probiotic bacteria lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bi-07.
AB  == the effect of probiotic bacteria lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm and bifidobacterium lactis bi-07 on the composition of the lactobacillus group, bifidobacterium and the total bacterial population in feces from young children with atopic dermatitis was investigated. the study included 50 children randomized to intake of one of the probiotic strain or placebo. microbial composition was characterized by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, quantitative pcr and, in a subset of subjects, by pyrosequencing of the 16s rrna  gene. the core population of the lactobacillus group was identified as lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus oris, leuconostoc mesenteroides, while the bifidobacterial community included bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium longum and bifidobacterium catenulatum. the fecal numbers of l. acidophilus and b. lactis increased significantly after intervention, indicating survival of the ingested bacteria. the levels of bifidobacterium correlated positively (p=0.03), while the levels of the lactobacillus group negatively (p=0.01) with improvement of atopic eczema evaluated by the severity scoring of atopic dermatitis index. this correlation was observed across the whole study cohort and not attributed to the probiotic intake. the main conclusion of the study is that administration of l. acidophilus ncfm and b. lactis bi-07 does not affect the composition and diversity of the main bacterial populations in feces.

TI  == exopolysaccharides produced by lactobacillus and bifidobacterium strains abrogate in vitro the cytotoxic effect of bacterial toxins on eukaryotic cells.
AB  == aims: to evaluate the capability of the exopolysaccharides (eps) produced by lactobacilli and bifidobacteria from human and dairy origin to antagonize the cytotoxic effect of bacterial toxins. methods and results: the cytotoxicity of bacillus cereus extracellular factors on caco-2 colonocytes in the presence/absence of the eps was determined by measuring the integrity of the tissue monolayer and the damage to the cell membrane (extracellular lactate dehydrogenase activity). additionally, the protective effect of eps against the haemolytic activity of the streptolysin-o was evaluated on rabbit erythrocytes. the eps produced by bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis a1 and ipla-r1, bifidobacterium longum nb667 and lactobacillus rhamnosus gg were able to counteract the toxic effect of bacterial toxins on the eukaryotic cells at 1mg ml(-1) eps concentration. the eps a1 was the most effective in counteracting the  effect of b. cereus toxins on colonocytes, even at lower doses (0.5mg ml(-1) ), whereas eps nb667 elicited the highest haemolysis reduction on erythrocytes. conclusions: the production of eps by lactobacilli and bifidobacteria could antagonize the toxicity of bacterial pathogens, this effect being eps and biological marker dependent. significance and impact of the study: this work allows gaining insight about the mechanisms that probiotics could exert to improve the host health.

TI  == exopolysaccharides produced by bifidobacterium longum ipla e44 and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis ipla r1 modify the composition and metabolic activity of human faecal microbiota in ph-controlled batch cultures.
AB  == exopolysaccharides (eps) isolated from two bifidobacterium strains, one of human  intestinal origin (bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum ipla e44) and the other from dairy origin (bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis ipla r1), were subjected to in vitro chemically simulated gastrointestinal digestion, which showed the absence of degradation of both polymers in these conditions. polymers  were then used as carbon sources in ph-controlled faecal batch cultures and compared with the non-prebiotic carbohydrate glucose and the prebiotic inulin to  determine changes in the composition of faecal bacteria. a set of eight fluorescent in situ hybridisation oligonucleotide probes targeting 16s rrna sequences was used to quantify specific groups of microorganisms. growth of the opportunistic pathogen clostridium histolyticum occurred with all carbohydrates tested similarly to that found in negative control cultures without added carbohydrate and was mainly attributed to the culture conditions used rather than enhancement of growth by these substrates. polymers e44 and r1 stimulated growth  of lactobacillus/enterococcus, bifidobacterium, and bacteroides/prevotella in a similar way to that seen with inulin. the eps r1 also promoted growth of the atopobium cluster during the first 24h of fermentation. an increase in acetic and lactic acids was found during early stages of fermentation (first 10-24h) correlating with increases of lactobacillus, bifidobacterium, and atopobium. propionic acid concentrations increased in old cultures, which was coincident with the enrichment of clostridium cluster ix in cultures with eps r1 and with the increases in bacteroides in cultures with both microbial eps (r1 and e44) and inulin. the lowest acetic to propionic acid ratio was obtained for eps e44. none  of the carbohydrates tested supported the growth of microorganisms from clostridium clusters xiva+b and iv, results that correlate with the poor butyrate production in the presence of eps. thus, eps synthesized by bifidobacteria from dairy and intestinal origins can modulate the intestinal microbiota in vitro, promoting changes in some numerically and metabolically relevant microbial populations and shifts in the production of short chain fatty acids.

TI  == production of exopolysaccharides by lactobacillus and bifidobacterium strains of  human origin, and metabolic activity of the producing bacteria in milk.
AB  == this work reports on the physicochemical characterization of 21 exopolysaccharides (eps) produced by lactobacillus and bifidobacterium strains isolated from human intestinal microbiota, as well as the growth and metabolic activity of the eps-producing strains in milk. the strains belong to the species  lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus vaginalis, bifidobacterium animalis, bifidobacterium longum, and bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum. the molar mass distribution of eps fractions showed 2 peaks of different sizes, which is a feature shared with some eps from bacteria of food origin. in general, we detected an association between the eps size distribution and the eps-producing species, although because of the low numbers of human bacterial eps tested, we could not conclusively establish a correlation. the main monosaccharide components of the eps under study were glucose, galactose, and rhamnose, which are the same as those found in food polymers; however, the rhamnose and glucose ratios was generally higher than the  galactose ratio in our human bacterial eps. all eps-producing strains were able to grow and acidify milk; most lactobacilli produced lactic acid as the main metabolite. the lactic acid-to-acetic acid ratio in bifidobacteria was 0.7, close to the theoretical ratio, indicating that the eps-producing strains did not produce an excessive amount of acetic acid, which could adversely affect the sensory properties of fermented milks. with respect to their viscosity-intensifying ability, l. plantarum h2 and l. rhamnosus e41 and e43r were able to increase the viscosity of stirred, fermented milks to a similar extent as the eps-producing streptococcus thermophilus strain used as a positive  control. therefore, these human eps-producing bacteria could be used as adjuncts  in mixed cultures for the formulation of functional foods if probiotic characteristics could be demonstrated. this is the first article reporting the physicochemical characteristics of eps isolated from human intestinal microbiota.

TI  == probiotic cheddar cheese: influence of ripening temperatures on proteolysis and sensory characteristics of cheddar cheeses.
AB  == bifidobacterium longum 1941, b. animalis subsp. lactis lafti b94, lactobacillus casei 279, lb. casei lafti l26, lb. acidophilus 4962, or lb. acidophilus lafti l10 were used as an adjunct in the production of cheddar cheeses, which were ripened at 4 and 8 degrees c for 24 wk. effects of ripening temperatures and probiotic adjuncts on proteolysis and sensory evaluation of the cheeses were examined. higher ripening temperature increased the level of proteolysis in the cheeses. product of proteolysis and organic acids released during ripening were shown to be important for the flavor of cheddar cheeses. there were positive and  significant correlations between the levels of soluble nitrogen, lactic, acetic,  and butyric acids, percentage hydrolysis of alpha(s1)-cn and beta-cn to the scores of cheddary flavor (p < 0.05). scores for sour-acid and vinegary flavors were higher in cheeses with the addition of bifidobacterium sp. or lb. casei 279  ripened at 8 degrees c. the scores were positively and significantly correlated to the level of lactic, acetic, and free amino acids in the cheeses (p < 0.05). the results show that both 4 and 8 degrees c have potential for use in the ripening of probiotic cheddar cheeses.

TI  == prevention of tnbs-induced colitis by different lactobacillus and bifidobacterium strains is associated with an expansion of gammadeltat and regulatory t cells of  intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes.
AB  == background: probiotics may protect against inflammatory bowel disease through regulation of lamina propria lymphocytes (lpls) function. data are lacking on possible involvement of intraepithelial lymphocytes (iels). the aim of this study was to investigate whether different probiotic mixtures prevented gut inflammatory disease and the role of both iels and lpls. methods: balb/c mice received 2 probiotic mixtures orally for 3 weeks, as mix1 (lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium longum), or mix2 (lactobacillus plantarum, streptococcus thermophilus, and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis). colitis  was induced by intrarectal administration of trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (tnbs). probiotics in stools were analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr). colon subpopulations of iels and lpls were assayed by flow cytometry. serum cytokines were measured by cytometric bead array (cba). results: all probiotics colonized the intestine. the 2 mixtures prevented the tnbs-induced intestinal damage, and mix1 was the most effective. the mix1 protection was associated with a reduction in cd4(+) cells of iels and lpls, an increase in gammadeltat cells of iels, and a decrease in gammadeltat cells of lpls. an expansion of t regulatory (treg) cells of iels was induced by mix1 and mix2. both probiotic mixtures inhibited tumor necrosis factor (tnf)-alpha and monocyte chemotactic protein (mcp)-1 production and upregulated interleukin (il)-10. in addition, mix1 prevented the tnbs-induced increase of il-12 and interferon (ifn)-gamma. conclusions: the 2 probiotic mixtures were able to prevent the tnbs-induced colitis; the l. acidophilus and b. longum mixture was the most effective. other than an involvement of lpls, our results report a novel importance of the iels population in probiotic protection.

TI  == evaluation of the passage of lactobacillus gasseri k7 and bifidobacteria from the stomach to intestines using a single reactor model.
AB  == background: probiotic bacteria are thought to play an important role in the digestive system and therefore have to survive the passage from stomach to intestines. recently, a novel approach to simulate the passage from stomach to intestines in a single bioreactor was developed. the advantage of this automated  one reactor system was the ability to test the influence of acid, bile salts and  pancreatin.lactobacillus gasseri k7 is a strain isolated from infant faeces with  properties making the strain interesting for cheese production. in this study, a  single reactor system was used to evaluate the survival of l. gasseri k7 and selected bifidobacteria from our collection through the stomach-intestine passage. results: initial screening for acid resistance in acidified culture media showed a low tolerance of bifidobacterium dentium for this condition indicating low survival in the passage. similar results were achieved with b. longum subsp. infantis whereas b. animalis subsp. lactis had a high survival.these initial results were confirmed in the bioreactor model of the stomach-intestine passage. b. animalis subsp. lactis had the highest survival rate (10%) attaining approximately 5 x 106 cfu ml-1 compared to the other tested  bifidobacteria strains which were reduced by a factor of up to 106. lactobacillus gasseri k7 was less resistant than b. animalis subsp. lactis but survived at cell concentrations approximately 1000 times higher than other bifidobacteria. conclusion: in this study, we were able to show that l. gasseri k7 had a high survival rate in the stomach-intestine passage. by comparing the results with a previous study in piglets we could confirm the reliability of our simulation. of  the tested bifidobacteria strains, only b. animalis subsp. lactis showed acceptable survival for a successful passage in the simulation system.

TI  == detection of bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis (bb12) in the intestine after feeding of sows and their piglets.
AB  == a real-time pcr method has been developed to distinguish bifidobacterium animalis subspecies in the gastrointestinal tracts of pigs. identification of a highly conserved single-copy tuf gene encoding the elongation factor tu involved in bacterial protein biosynthesis was used as a marker to differentiate homologous bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis (strain bb12) from bifidobacterium animalis subsp. animalis, as well as bifidobacterium suis, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium longum, several species of lactobacillus, and enterococcus faecium. real-time pcr detection of serially diluted dna extracted from a pure culture of bb12 was linear for bacterial numbers ranging from 10 to 10,000 tuf gene copies per pcr (r(2) = 0.99). relative differences in bb12 bacterial numbers in pigs fed daily with bb12 were determined after detection of bb12 tuf gene copies in dna extracted from the intestinal contents. piglets treated with bb12 immediately after birth maintained a high level of bb12 in their large intestines with continuous daily administration of bb12. piglets born to bb12-treated sows during the last third of their gestation and also treated with bb12 at birth (t/t group) had a higher number of bb12 organisms per gram of intestinal contents compared to placebo-treated piglets born to placebo-treated sows (c/c group), bb12-treated sows (t/c group), or piglets born to placebo sows but treated with bb12 immediately after birth (c/t group). in addition, there was a significant increase in gene expression for toll-like receptor 9 (tlr9) in piglets from the t/t group, with no change in tlr2 and tlr4. these findings suggest that the tuf gene represents a specific and functional marker for detecting bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis strain bb12 within the microbiota of the intestine.

TI  == effects of yogurt and bifidobacteria supplementation on the colonic microbiota in lactose-intolerant subjects.
AB  == aims: colonic metabolism of lactose may play a role in lactose intolerance. we investigated whether a 2-week supplementation of bifidobacterium longum (in capsules) and a yogurt enriched with bifidobacterium animalis could modify the composition and metabolic activities of the colonic microbiota in 11 chinese lactose-intolerant subjects. methods and results: the numbers of total cells, total bacteria and the eubacterium rectale/clostridium coccoides group in faeces  as measured with fluorescent in situ hybridization and the faecal beta-galactosidase activity increased significantly during supplementation. the number of bifidobacterium showed a tendency to increase during and after supplementation. with pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, in subjects in which b. animalis and b. longum were not detected before supplementation, both strains were present in faeces during supplementation, but disappeared after supplementation. the degree of lactose digestion in the small intestine and the oro-caecal transit time were not different before and after supplementation, whereas symptom scores after lactose challenge decreased after supplementation. conclusions: the results suggest that supplementation modifies the amount and metabolic activities of the colonic microbiota and alleviates symptoms in lactose-intolerant subjects. the changes in the colonic microbiota might be among the factors modified by the supplementation which lead to the alleviation of lactose intolerance. significance and impact of the study: this study provides evidence for the possibility of managing lactose intolerance with dietary lactose (yogurt) and probiotics via modulating the colonic microbiota.

TI  == antibiotic resistance of lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacterium spp. isolated from dairy and pharmaceutical products.
AB  == the outlines of antibiotic resistance of some probiotic microorganisms were studied. this study was conducted with the double purpose of verifying their ability to survive if they are taken simultaneously with an antibiotic therapy and to increase the selective properties of suitable media for the isolation of samples containing mixed bacterial populations. we isolated from commercial dairy and pharmaceutical products, 34 strains declared as probiotics, belonging to the  genera bifidobacterium and lactobacillus, and 21 strains of starter culture bacteria. all the microorganisms have been compared by electrophoresis of the soluble proteins for the purpose of identifying them. a multiplex-pcr with genus- and species-specific primers was used to detect for bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis presence. all bifidobacteria were b. animalis subsp. lactis except  one bifidobacterium longum. sometimes the identification showed that the used strain was not the one indicated on the label. the lactobacilli were lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. the streptococci were all streptococcus thermophilus. the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) of 24 common antibiotic substances has been valued by the broth microdilution method. all tested strains were susceptible to ampicillin, bacitracin, clindamycin, dicloxacillin, erytromycin, novobiocin, penicillin g, rifampicin (mic(90) ranging from 0.01 to 4 microg/ml);  resistant to aztreonam, cycloserin, kanamycin, nalidixic acid, polymyxin b and spectinomycin (mic(90) ranging from 64 to >1000 microg/ml). the susceptibility to cephalothin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, lincomycin, metronidazole, neomycin, paromomycin, streptomycin, tetracycline and vancomycin was variable and depending on the species.

TI  == exopolysaccharides produced by probiotic strains modify the adhesion of probiotics and enteropathogens to human intestinal mucus.
AB  == exopolysaccharides (epss) are exocellular polymers present in the surface of many bacteria, including lactobacillus and bifidobacterium. the genome sequence of several strains revealed the presence of eps-encoding genes. however, the physiological role that epss play in the bacterial ecology still remains uncertain. in this study, we have assessed the effect of epss produced by lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, bifidobacterium longum nb667, and bifidobacterium animalis ipla-r1 on the adhesion of probiotic and enteropathogen strains to human intestinal mucus. the eps fraction gg had no significant effect on the adhesion of l. rhamnosus gg and b. animalis ipla-r1. however, the eps fractions nb667 and  ipla-r1 significantly reduced the adherence of both probiotic strains. in contrast, the three eps fractions increased the adhesion of enterobacter sakazakii atcc 29544 and escherichia coli nctc 8603. higher adherence of salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium atcc 29631 and clostridium difficile atcc 9689 was detected in the presence of the eps fractions gg and nb667. in general,  these effects were obtained at eps concentrations of up to 5 mg/ml, and they were eps dose dependent. the competitive exclusion of probiotics in the presence of eps could suggest the involvement of these biopolymers in the adhesion to mucus.  the increase in the adherence of enteropathogens could be explained if components of the pathogen surface are able to bind to specific epss and the bound epss are  able to adhere to mucus. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first work reporting the effect of epss from probiotics on bacterial adhesion properties.

TI  == a dynamic model that simulates the human upper gastrointestinal tract for the study of probiotics.
AB  == a dynamic model of the human upper gastrointestinal (gi) tract was designed to better simulate conditions of ingestion and digestion, by including a food matrix as part of the model design. the dynamic model consisted of two reactors maintained at 37 degrees c, one simulating stomach conditions and the other simulating duodenum conditions. the model was tested by comparing survival of bacteria isolated from humans (bifidobacterium infantis, lactobacillus johnsonii, lactobacillus rhamnosus, and lactobacillus acidophilus) animals (bifidobacterium  animalis, 2 strains), and fermented dairy products (bifidobacterium longum, lactobacillus kefir, lactobacillus kefirgranum, and leuconostoc mesenteroides) with their survival as determined by conventional methods. five strains were not  able to survive (>3 log reduction) 15 min in a medium acidified at ph 2.0 using the conventional testing method, but survival was improved significantly for some strains in the dynamic model. two strains (bifidobacterium animalis atcc 25527 and lactobacillus johnsonii la-1 ncc 533) showed good survival with both methods. the dynamic model was shown to better represent the events during upper gi tract  transit than the conventional methods, by incorporation of a food matrix to buffer the gastric acidity and therefore expose bacteria to ph levels found in vivo before, during, and after a meal.

TI  == production of oligosaccharides in yogurt containing bifidobacteria and yogurt cultures.
AB  == yogurts were prepared by using yogurt cultures combined to mixed cultures of bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium animalis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium infantis, and bifidobacterium longum) and  by adding a preincubation step (1.5 h at 50 degrees c) with bifidobacteria to the conventional method of manufacture in order to produce oligosaccharides. the survival of bifidobacteria was drastically affected during storage of yogurts, except for products containing b. animalis, in which viable counts remained at >10(6) cfu/g after 28 d of storage at 4 degrees c. oligosaccharides with a degree of polymerization of 3 were produced during the preincubation step (0.31 to 0.68%), and the amount in the final products varied according to the species of bifidobacteria inoculated during the preincubation step or the concentration of bifidobacteria used as second inoculum during the fermentation process. in fact,  the higher concentration of oligosaccharides measured at the end of the fermentation process (0.72%) and the 28 d-storage period (0.67%) was obtained for yogurts containing b. infantis. however, yogurts containing b. breve showed higher beta-galactosidase activities and had lower lactose concentrations after the fermentation process and the storage period than the other yogurts. the use of a mixed cultures of bifidobacteria (b. animalis, b. infantis, or b. breve) thus allows the production of yogurts in which bifidobacteria can survive in relatively high cell numbers and contain appreciable amount of oligosaccharides.

TI  == nucleotide sequence, expression and transcriptional analysis of the bifidobacterium longum mb 219 lacz gene.
AB  == the gene encoding beta-galactosidase was isolated by functional complementation of escherichia coli from bifidobacterium longum mb219, which exhibited the highest activity among ten bifidobacterium strains tested of the species b. longum, b. breve, b. adolescentis, b. indicum, b. animalis and b. cuniculi. the nucleotide sequence of the 5.0-kb fragment conferring the positive beta-galactosidase phenotype to e. coli revealed the presence of a lacz-type gene encoding a 1023-amino-acid protein that was preceded by a ribosome binding site.  a sequence showing 72% identity with the proline trna of bacillus subtilis and a  gene probably encoding the dna-3-methyladenine glycosydase i were located downstream from the lacz gene, after a gap of 30-50 unsequenced base pairs. by primer-extension analysis, the transcription start site of the lacz gene was mapped 65 nt upstream from the start codon, and it enabled identification of the  -10 region of the putative promoter. the nucleotide sequence of lacz and its deduced amino acid sequence were compared with those of beta-galactosidase genes  and enzymes from other microorganisms. high similarity was demonstrated between the b. longum beta-galactosidase and its counterparts in lactobacillus delbruckii subsp. bulgaricus, streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus, e. coli, clostridium acetobutylicum, leuconostoc lactis, klebsiella pneumoniae and kluyveromyces marxianus var. lactis, all belonging to the lacz family. the b. longum mb219 lacz gene was cloned in bifidobacterium and its expression was observed in strains with otherwise low levels of endogenous activity. the expression increased by factors of 1.5-50 and enabled those strains that do not grow on lactose to use this sugar as sole carbon source.

TI  == growth-inhibitory effects of galla rhois-derived tannins on intestinal bacteria.
AB  == the growth-inhibitory activity of galla rhois-derived materials towards 17 intestinal bacteria was evaluated using an impregnated paper disc method. the biologically active components of galla rhois were characterized as the tannins methyl gallate (mg) and gallic acid (ga) by spectral analysis. the growth responses varied with bacterial strain tested. in the test using 10 mg disc-1, mg and ga produced a clear inhibitory effect on harmful bacteria such as clostridium perfringens, cl. paraputrificum, eubacterium limosum, bacteroides fragilis, staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli. methyl gallate showed no growth-inhibitory activity towards bifidobacterium adolescentis or b. longum whereas the growth of b. bifidum, b. breve, b. infantis, b. animalis, b. thermophilum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lact. plantarum and streptococcus faecalis was slightly affected. however, ga did not adversely affect the growth of the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. at 5 mg disc-1, mg significantly inhibited the growth of cl. perfringens and cl. paraputrificum but did not affect the growth of the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. at 1 mg disc-1, mg greatly inhibited the growth of cl. perfringens alone. these results may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of galla rhois.

TI  == taxonomy and physiology of probiotic lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the current taxonomy of probiotic lactic acid bacteria is reviewed with special focus on the genera lactobacillus, bifidobacterium and enterococcus. the physiology and taxonomic position of species and strains of these genera were investigated by phenotypic and genomic methods. in total, 176 strains, including  the type strains, have been included. phenotypic methods applied were based on biochemical, enzymatical and physiological characteristics, including growth temperatures, cell wall analysis and analysis of the total soluble cytoplasmatic  proteins. genomic methods used were pulsed field gel electrophoresis (pfge), randomly amplified polymorphic dna-pcr (rapd-pcr) and dna-dna hybridization for bifidobacteria. in the genus lactobacillus the following species of importance as probiotics were investigated: l. acidophilus group, l. casei group and l. reuteri/l. fermentum group. most strains referred to as l. acidophilus in probiotic products could be identified either as l. gasseri or as l. johnsonii, both members of the l. acidophilus group. a similar situation could be shown in the l. casei group, where most of the strains named l. casei belonged to l. paracasei subspp. a recent proposal to reject the species l. paracasei and to include this species in the restored species l. casei with a neotype strain was supported by protein analysis. bifidobacterium spp. strains have been reported to be used for production of fermented dairy and recently of probiotic products. according to phenotypic features and confirmed by dna-dna hybridization most of the bifidobacteria strains from dairy origin belonged to b. animalis, although they were often declared as b. longum by the manufacturer. from the genus enterococcus, probiotic ec. faecium strains were investigated with regard to the  vana-mediated resistance against glycopeptides. these unwanted resistances could  be ruled out by analysis of the 39 kda resistance protein. in conclusion, the taxonomy and physiology of probiotic lactic acid bacteria can only be understood  by using polyphasic taxonomy combining morphological, biochemical and physiological characteristics with molecular-based phenotypic and genomic techniques.

TI  == digoxigenin-labeled deoxyribonucleic acid probes for the enumeration of bifidobacteria in fecal samples.
AB  == the numbers of bifidobacteria in fecal samples were specifically determined by colony hybridization with the mixture of digoxigenin-labeled dna probes that were prepared from whole chromosomal dna of bifidobacterium longum 6001 and bifidobacterium adolescentis 6003. these dna probes strongly hybridized with dna  of b. longum, b. adolescentis, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium suis, bifidobacterium infantis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium angulatum, and bifidobacterium animalis. detectable positive signals with dna of bifidobacterium pseudolongum ssp. pseudolongum, bifidobacterium catenulatum, and bifidobacterium  thermophilum were also found after hybridization. when dot-blot hybridization was performed with whole cells of 47 reference strains containing 11 species (16 strains) of bifidobacteria, all of the bifidobacteria tested could be specifically detected by using these dna probes; lactobacillus fermentum jcm 1173, however, showed a slight nonspecific signal. the counts of bifidobacteria by colony hybridization in the fecal samples of four of the five subjects were the same as the counts that were obtained by the conventional method using bl agar medium. furthermore, no significant difference existed in the number of bifidobacteria that were determined by either method.
