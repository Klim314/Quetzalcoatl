TI  == the effect of a contraceptive vaginal ring and oral contraceptives on the vaginal flora.
AB  == premenopausal women seeking a steroid contraceptive method were allowed to choose between a contraceptive vaginal ring (cvr) containing levonorgestrel and estradiol used in a 3-week in, 1-week out regimen (n=20) and an oral contraceptive (oc) containing levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol in a 28-day regimen (n = 10). cultures from the posterior vaginal fornix were obtained before therapy in both groups and monthly for 6 months for the cvr group and after 1, 3, and 6 months for the oc group. these cultures were streaked on specific media to  provide quantitative aerobic and anaerobic, lactobacillus, candida sp., gardnerella vaginalis and neisseria gonorrhoeae counts in micro-organisms per milliliter. a comparison of the number and types of organisms isolated from vaginal cultures obtained initially and at 6 months demonstrated no statistically significant differences in colony counts between cvr and oc users. the results of this study suggest that the use of the cvr is not associated with a greater growth of pathogens than is oral administration of a progestin and estrogen combination.
