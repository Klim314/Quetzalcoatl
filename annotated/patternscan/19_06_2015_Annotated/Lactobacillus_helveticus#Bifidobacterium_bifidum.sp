TI  == bifidobacterium bifidum r0071 results in a greater proportion of healthy days and a lower percentage of academically stressed students reporting a day of cold/flu: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.
AB  == acute psychological stress is positively associated with a cold/flu. the present  randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study examined the effect of three potentially probiotic bacteria on the proportion of healthy days over a 6-week period in academically stressed undergraduate students (n 581) who received lactobacillus helveticus r0052, bifidobacterium longum ssp. infantis r0033, bifidobacterium bifidum r0071 or placebo. on each day, participants recorded the  intensity (scale: 0 = not experiencing to 3 = very intense) for nine cold/flu symptoms, and a sum of symptom intensity >6 was designated as a day of cold/flu.  b. bifidum resulted in a greater proportion of healthy days than placebo (p</= 0.05). the percentage of participants reporting >/= 1 d of cold/flu during the 6-week intervention period was significantly lower with b. bifidum than with placebo (p< 0.05). there were no effects of b. infantis or l. helveticus compared with placebo on either outcome. a predictive model accounted for influential characteristics and their interactions on daily reporting of cold/flu episodes. the proportion of participants reporting a cold on any given day was lower at weeks 2 and 3 with b. bifidum and b. infantis than with placebo for the average level of stress and the most commonly reported number of hours of sleep. daily intake of bifidobacteria provides benefit related to cold/flu outcomes during acute stress.

TI  == multistrain probiotic modulation of intestinal epithelial cells' immune response  to a double-stranded rna ligand, poly(i.c).
AB  == a commercially available product containing three probiotic bacterial strains (lactobacillus helveticus r0052, bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis r0033, and bifidobacterium bifidum r0071) was previously shown in animal trials to modulate both th1 and th2 immune responses. clinical studies on this combination  of bacteria have also shown positive health effects against seasonal winter diseases and rotavirus infection. the goal of this study was to use a well-established in vitro intestinal epithelial (ht-29) cell model that has been  shown to constitutively express double-stranded rna (dsrna) sensors (toll-like receptor 3 [tlr3], retinoic acid-inducible gene i, melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5, and dsrna-activated protein kinase). by using  the ht-29 cell model, we wanted to evaluate whether or not this combination of three bacteria had the capacity to immune modulate the host cell response to a dsrna ligand, poly(i.c). using a custom-designed, two-color expression microarray targeting genes of the human immune system, we investigated the response of ht-29 cells challenged with poly(i.c) both in the presence and in the absence of the three probiotic bacteria. we observed that the combination of the three bacteria  had a major impact on attenuating the expression of genes connected to proinflammatory th1 and antiviral innate immune responses compared to that obtained by the poly(i.c)-only challenge. major pathways through which the multistrain combination may be eliciting its immune-modulatory effect include the tlr3 domain-containing adapter-inducing beta interferon (trif), mitogen-activated protein kinase, and nf-kappab signaling pathways. such a model may be useful for  selecting potential biomarkers for the design of future clinical trials.

TI  == novel probiotic-fermented milk with angiotensin i-converting enzyme inhibitory peptides produced by bifidobacterium bifidum mf 20/5.
AB  == in previous research, we have demonstrated that bifidobacterium bifidum mf 20/5 fermented milk possessed stronger angiotensin converting enzyme (ace) inhibitory  activity than other lactic acid bacteria, including lactobacillus helveticus dsm  13137, which produces the hypotensive casokinins ile-pro-pro (ipp) and val-pro-pro (vpp). the aim of this study is to investigate the ace-inhibitory peptides released in b. bifidum mf 20/5 fermented milk. the novel ace-inhibitory  peptide lvypfp (ic50 = 132 mum) is reported here for the first time. additionally, other bioactive peptides such as the ace-inhibitor lplp (ic50 = 703 mum), and the antioxidant vlpvpqk were identified. moreover, the peptide and amino acid profiles, the ace-inhibitory activity (acei), ph, and degree of hydrolysis of the fermented milk were determined and compared with those obtained in milk fermented by l. helveticus dsm 13137. the sequences of the major bioactive peptides present in fermented milk of b. bifidum and l. helveticus were identified and quantified. b. bifidum released a larger amount of peptides than l. helveticus but no ipp or vpp were detected in b. bifidum fermented milk. also  the lactotripeptide concentrations and acei were higher in l. helveticus fermented milk when the ph was maintained at 4.6. this may represent a technical  advantage for b. bifidum that reduces the ph at a slow enough rate to facilitate  the peptide generation without the need for ph control. thus these findings show  the potential for the use of this probiotic strain to produce fermented milk with a wider range of health benefits including reduction of blood pressure.

TI  == hypolipidemic effects of lactic acid bacteria fermented cereal in rats.
AB  == background: the objectives of the present study were to investigate the efficacy  of the mixed culture of lactobacillus acidophilus (dsm 20242), bifidobacterium bifidum (dsm 20082) and lactobacillus helveticus (ck60) in the fermentation of maize and the evaluation of the effect of the fermented meal on the lipid profile of rats. methods: rats were randomly assigned to 3 groups and each group placed on a diet a (high fat diet into which a maize meal fermented with a mixed culture of lb acidophilus (dsm 20242), b bifidum (dsm 20082) and lb helveticus (ck 60) was incorporated), b (unfermented high fat diet) or c (commercial rat chow) respectively after the first group of 7 rats randomly selected were sacrificed to obtain the baseline data. thereafter 7 rats each from the experimental and control groups were sacrificed weekly for 4 weeks and the plasma, erythrocytes, lipoproteins and organs of the rats were assessed for cholesterol, triglyceride and phospholipids. results: our results revealed that the mixed culture of lb acidophilus (dsm 20242), b bifidum (dsm 20082) and lb helveticus (ck 60) were able to grow and ferment maize meal into 'ogi' of acceptable flavour. in addition to plasma and hepatic hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia, phospholipidosis in plasma, as well as cholesterogenesis, triglyceride constipation and phospholipidosis in extra-hepatic tissues characterized the consumption of unfermented hyperlipidemic diets. however, feeding the animals with the fermented maize diet reversed the dyslipidemia. conclusion: the findings of this study indicate that consumption of mixed culture lactic acid bacteria (lb acidophilus (dsm 20242), bifidobacterium bifidum (dsm 20082) and lb helveticus (ck 60) fermented food results in the inhibition of fat absorption. it also inhibits the activity of hmg coa reductase. this inhibition may be by feedback inhibition or repression of the transcription of the gene encoding the enzyme via activation of the sterol regulatory element binding protein (srebp) transcription factor. it is also possible that consumption of fermented food enhances conversion of cholesterol to bile acids by activating cholesterol-7alpha-hydroxylase.

TI  == immunomodulatory impact of a synbiotic in t(h)1 and t(h)2 models of infection.
AB  == background and methods: the immunomodulatory activity of a synbiotic combination  containing three bacterial strains (lactobacillus helveticus r0052, bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis r0033 and bifidobacterium bifidum r0071) and short-chain fructooligosaccharide was examined in two distinct infectious rat models. in the t(h)1 model, wistar rats were administered the synbiotic combination for 2 weeks prior to challenge with a single oral dose of enterotoxigenic escherichia coli or vehicle. in the t(h)2 model, pretreated rats  were challenged with a single subcutaneous dose of hook worm, nippostrongylus brasiliensis. blood samples were collected 3 hours or 4 days postchallenge and serum levels of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines were measured. results: significant reductions in pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (il)-1alpha, il-1beta, il-6, and tumour necrosis factor (tnf)-alpha were observed in both models suggesting a single, unifying mode of action on an upstream regulator. the n. brasiliensis study also compared the effect of the individual strains to synbiotic. for most of cytokines the combination appeared to average the effect of the individual strains with the exception of il-4 and il-10 where there was apparent synergy for the combination. furthermore, the cytokine response varied by strain. conclusions: it was concluded that this synbiotic combination of these three microbes could be beneficial in both t(h)1 and t(h)2 diseases.

TI  == efficacy of a synbiotic supplementation in the prevention of common winter diseases in children: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study.
AB  == background and aims: the purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy of a synbiotic supplementation in reducing common winter diseases in children. methods: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre study was conducted in young school-age children (3-7 years old) during a winter period. participants were otherwise healthy children who suffered from at least three episodes of ear, nose and throat (ent), respiratory tract or gastrointestinal illness during the previous winter. they were supplemented daily with either a synbiotic preparation (lactobacillus helveticus r0052, bifidobacterium infantis r0033, bifidobacterium bifidum r0071, and fructooligosaccharide) or a matched placebo for 3 months. over this period, all emergent health episodes of any type  were recorded by parents in a diary. they were checked by investigators at regular monthly visits. the main study outcome was the percentage of children free of any episode during the study course. results: we randomized 135 children  (mean age: 4.1+/-1.0 years) to the synbiotic group (n = 62) or placebo (n = 73) group. at least one illness episode was reported in 32 children in the synbiotic  group and 50 in the placebo group (51.6% versus 68.5%). this corresponded to a significant 25% relative risk reduction (95% ci 0.6-44.3%; p = 0.045). this difference was due to a decrease in the number of children who suffered from at least one ent, respiratory tract or gastrointestinal disorder (50.0% with synbiotic versus 67.1% with placebo; p = 0.044). at least one sickness school day loss was noted in 25.8% of children with the synbiotic as compared with 42.5% with placebo (p = 0.043). no treatment related side effects were detected in either group. conclusions: this study suggests that a 3-month supplementation with this synbiotic preparation can decrease the risk of occurrence of common infectious diseases in children and limits the risk of school day loss.

TI  == comparison of the phospholipid composition of bifidobacterium and lactobacillus strains.
AB  == phospholipid composition of 10 bifidobacterium strains of human intestinal origin and of 9 lactobacillus strains was determined by quantitative two-dimensional thin-layer chromatography. phospholipids of three bifidobacterium strains from honey bees and of two strains from bovine rumen liquor were qualitatively investigated. diphosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylglycerol were present in strains of both genera. all bifidobacterium strains contained as specific phospholipids a new polyglycerolphospholipid, compound 15, and its lyso derivatives, earlier detected in b. bifidum var. pennsylvanicus. also, lyso compounds of diphosphatidylglycerol and alanyl phosphatidylglycerol were only present in this genus in variable amounts. lysyl phosphatidylglycerol was the only ninhydrin-positive phospholipid in seven lactobacillus strains. in l. delbruckii and l. helveticus it was absent and partially replaced by an unidentified ninhydrin-negative phospholipid. the differences in phospholipid composition between bifidobacteria and lactobacilli may be another argument to differentiate these two genera.
