TI  == comparative in-vitro and in-vivo activity of am-1155 against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the in-vitro activity of am-1155, a 6-fluoro-8-methoxy quinolone, was compared with those of temafloxacin, sparfloxacin, tosufloxacin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin  and cefmetazole, a cephamycin, against a variety of anaerobic bacteria. although  am-1155 demonstrated only modest activity against the bacteroides fragilis group  and prevotella bivia (mic90s > or =3.13 mg/ml), 76% of the b. fragilis strains tested were inhibited at am-1155 concentrations of 0.78 mg/l. am-1155 was highly  active against prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium spp., clostridium perfringens and mobiluncus spp. (mic90s < or =0.39 mg/l). an in-vivo study using a mixed infection with am-1155- and tosufloxacin-susceptible  b. fragilis and escherichia coli strains in rat granuloma pouch was performed. am-1155 was effective against both organisms whereas tosufloxacin was effective only against e. coli. these results correlated well to the higher pouch levels of am-1155 than those of tosufloxacin. clostridium difficile overgrowth was found in the caecum of mice treated with ampicillin both 1 and 7 days after 5 days dosing, but not in am-1155-treated mice. these results suggest that the clinical efficacy of am-1155 against infections involving most anaerobic bacteria except for the b. fragilis group and p. bivia should be evaluated further.

TI  == distribution and mobility of the tetracycline resistance determinant tetq.
AB  == we tested 34 american type culture collection (atcc) and 168 clinical bacterial isolates, from the human urogenital and oral tracts and streptococci isolated from cows with mastitis, for the presence of the tetq gene using a polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay and dna-dna hybridization. the identities of pcr products were confirmed by southern blot hybridization of whole-cell dna. eleven  of the atcc strains were positive for tetq, including five bacteroides spp., five prevotella spp. and a single isolate of mitsuokella multiacidus. twenty-eight (29%) of the 95 clinical gram-negative isolates carried the tetq gene, while eight (11%) of the 73 clinical gram-positive isolates carried the tetq gene. this is the first description of tetq in gram-positive species. all isolates except one peptostreptococcus sp. carried tetq integrated into the chromosome. the tetq  gene could be transferred from prevotella bivia, bacteroides ovatus, bacteroides  fragilis, bacteroides vulgatus and bacteroides distasonis into an enterococcus faecalis recipient at frequencies of 10(-7)-10(-9) per recipient. in contrast, tetq failed to transfer from two isolates of prevotella intermedia, two isolates  of porphyromonas gingivalis, one isolate of mobiluncus curtisii and one isolate of peptostreptococcus sp. the latter two are gram-positive species. the pcr assay was used to screen 198 proteinase k-treated biopsies of prostate, periprostate and bladder from 84 men with prostatitis. thirty-four (40%) of the patients had one or more positive samples, suggesting that the pcr assay could be of value in  screening patient material directly for the presence of bacteria.

TI  == in vitro activity of fk037, a new parenteral cephalosporin, against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the activity of fk037, a new parenteral cephalosporin, was compared with those of cefpirome, ceftazidime, and flomoxef against 322 recent clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria. a fastidious facultative anaerobe, gardnerella vaginalis, was also studied. fk037 inhibited 90% of isolates of peptostreptococcus anaerobius, peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, clostridium perfringens, mobiluncus spp., g. vaginalis, and porphyromonas gingivalis at < or = 0.78 micrograms/ml. the mics of fk037 for 50 and 90% of bacteroides fragilis isolates were 25 and > 200 micrograms/ml, respectively; the activity of fk037 was comparable to those of cefpirome and ceftazidime but lower than that of flomoxef. the activity of fk037  against fusobacterium nucleatum, fusobacterium varium, and bilophila wadsworthia  decreased when inoculum size was increased from 10(6) to 10(8) cfu/ml. little influence of inoculum size on the activity of fk037 was observed for other isolates tested. medium ph affected the activity of fk037 against f. varium (mics at phs 5 and 7, 3.13 and 100 micrograms/ml, respectively) and bacteroides gracilis (mics at phs 5 and 7, 12.5 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively) but not against other organisms tested. fk037 was less resistant than flomoxef to hydrolysis by beta-lactamase group 2e derived from b. fragilis gai 0558 and gai 10150.
