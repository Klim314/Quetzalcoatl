TI  == diffusible signal factor (dsf) quorum sensing signal and structurally related molecules enhance the antimicrobial efficacy of antibiotics against some bacterial pathogens.
AB  == background: extensive use of antibiotics has fostered the emergence of superbugs  that are resistant to multidrugs, which becomes a great healthcare and public concern. previous studies showed that quorum sensing signal dsf (diffusible signal factor) not only modulates bacterial antibiotic resistance through intraspecies signaling, but also affects bacterial antibiotic tolerance through interspecies communication. these findings motivate us to exploit the possibility of using dsf and its structurally related molecules as adjuvants to influence antibiotic susceptibility of bacterial pathogens. results: in this study, we have demonstrated that dsf signal and its structurally related molecules could be used to induce bacterial antibiotic susceptibility. exogenous addition of dsf signal (cis-11-methyl-2-dodecenoic acid) and its structural analogues could significantly increase the antibiotic susceptibility of bacillus cereus, possibly through reducing drug-resistant activity, biofilm formation and bacterial fitness. the synergistic effect of dsf and its structurally related molecules with antibiotics on b. cereus is dosage-dependent. combination of dsf with gentamicin showed an obviously synergistic effect on b. cereus pathogenicity in an in vitro model. we also found that dsf could increase the antibiotic susceptibility of other bacterial species, including bacillus thuringiensis, staphylococcus aureus, mycobacterium smegmatis, neisseria subflava and pseudomonas aeruginosa. conclusion: the results indicate a promising potential of using dsf and its structurally related molecules as novel adjuvants to conventional antibiotics for treatment of infectious diseases caused by bacterial pathogens.

TI  == the prevalence of gentamicin 2'-n-acetyltransferase in the proteeae and its role  in the o-acetylation of peptidoglycan.
AB  == the prevalence of aac(2')-ia, a gene coding for gentamicin 2'-n-acetyltransferase in providencia stuartii, among species of the proteeae was investigated to determine if it is a common resistance factor and whether the correlation observed in p. stuartii between its expression and the levels of peptidoglycan o-acetylation represents a general feature of bacteria producing this form of modified peptidoglycan. an evaluation of the mics of gentamicin for each of the species of the proteeae did not reveal any apparent relationship between resistance and the degree of o-acetylation of peptidoglycan. the entire aac(2')-ia gene was used as a probe in southern hybridization experiments against genomic dna from each species of the proteeae. a sequence with strong homology to aac(2')-ia was present only in proteus penneri while weak hybridization was also  observed to the restriction digested dna from providencia rettgeri. other bacteria that o-acetylate peptidoglycan were also screened with this probe and a  homologous dna sequence was only found in neisseria subflava. these data suggest  that aac(2')-ia may contribute to the o-acetylation of peptidoglycan in p. stuartii, but a more specific enzyme must also be produced for this function.

TI  == production and characterisation of mouse monoclonal antibodies reactive with the  lipopolysaccharide core of pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  == monoclonal antibodies (mabs) to the core antigen region of lipopolysaccharide (lps) of pseudomonas aeruginosa were produced from mice immunised with whole cells of heat-killed rough mutants of pseudomonas aeruginosa expressing partial or complete core lps. mabs were screened in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay  (elisa) against three different antigen cocktails: s-form lps from three p. aeruginosa strains, r-form lps from six p. aeruginosa strains and, as a negative  control, r-form lps from salmonella typhimurium and escherichia coli. selected mabs were subsequently screened against a range of extracted lps and whole cells  from both reference strains and clinical isolates of p. aeruginosa. the antibodies were also screened in elisa against whole-cell antigens from other pseudomonas spp. as well as strains of haemophilus influenzae, neisseria subflava and staphylococcus aureus. five mabs reacting with the core component of p. aeruginosa lps were finally selected. two of these, mabs 360.7 and 304.1.4, were  particularly reactive in immunoblots against unsubstituted core lps, including that from o-antigenic serotypes of p. aeruginosa. the mabs also reacted with some of the other pseudomonas spp., but not with p. cepacia or xanthomonas (pseudomonas) maltophilia. cross-reactivity with whole cells from other bacterial species was minimal or not observed. reactivity of mabs with some staph. aureus strains was observed, and binding to the protein a component was implicated. the  reactivity of the mabs was investigated further by flow cytometry and immunogold  electronmicroscopy. the suitability of the mabs for an immunological assay for detection of p. aeruginosa in respiratory secretions from cf patients is discussed.
