TI  == intestinal microbiota and allergic diseases: a systematic review.
AB  == evidence suggests that possible imbalances in intestinal microbiota composition may be implicated in the occurrence of allergic diseases. although several studies published until 2006 indicated a correlation between microbiota composition and allergic symptoms, it has not been possible to distinguish protective microorganisms from those associated with increased risk of allergic diseases. therefore, the objective of this study was to review the studies published since 2007 that address the intestinal microbiota in allergic diseases. twenty-one studies were identified after excluding those that performed a clinical intervention before stool collection. in the early microbiota of children who later developed allergies, lower bacterial diversity was observed, with a predominance of firmicutes; a higher count of bacteroidaceae; a higher prevalence of the anaerobic bacteria bacteroides fragilis, escherichia coli, clostridium difficile, bifidobacterium catenulatum, bifidobacterium bifidum, and  bifidobacterium longum; and a lower prevalence of bifidobacterium adolescentis, b. bifidum, and lactobacillus. in the microbiota of allergic children whose intestinal microbiota was assessed at the onset of allergic symptoms, there was a higher count of bacteroides; a lower count of akkermansia muciniphila, faecalibacterium prausnitzii, and clostridium; a higher prevalence of b. adolescentis; a lower prevalence of b. catenulatum and staphylococcus aureus; and a lower bacterial diversity.

TI  == lactobacillus gasseri ks-13, bifidobacterium bifidum g9-1, and bifidobacterium longum mm-2 ingestion induces a less inflammatory cytokine profile and a potentially beneficial shift in gut microbiota in older adults: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study.
AB  == objective: this study determined whether older adults who consumed a probiotic mixture would have a greater proportion of circulating cd4+ lymphocytes, altered  cytokine production, and a shift in intestinal microbiota toward a healthier microbial community. methods: participants (70 +/- 1 years [mean +/- sem]; n = 32) consumed a probiotic (lactobacillus gasseri ks-13, bifidobacterium bifidum g9-1, and bifidobacterium longum mm2) or a placebo twice daily for 3 weeks with a 5-week washout period between intervention periods. blood and stools were collected before and after each intervention. the percentage of circulating cd4+  lymphocytes and ex vivo mitogen-stimulated cell cytokine production were measured. in stools, specific bacterial targets were quantified via quantitative  polymerase chain reaction (qpcr) and community composition was determined via pyrosequencing. results: during the first period of the crossover the percentage  of cd4+ cells decreased with the placebo (48% +/- 3% to 31% +/- 3%, p < 0.01) but did not change with the probiotic (44% +/- 3% to 42% +/- 3%) and log-transformed  concentrations of interleukin-10 increased with the probiotic (1.7 +/- 0.2 to 3.4 +/- 0.2, p < 0.0001) but not the placebo (1.7 +/- 0.2 to 2.1 +/- 0.2). with the probiotic versus the placebo a higher percentage of participants had an increase  in fecal bifidobacteria (48% versus 30%, p < 0.05) and lactic acid bacteria (55%  versus 43%, p < 0.05) and a decrease in escherichia coli (52% versus 27%, p < 0.05). several bacterial groups matching faeacalibactierium prausnitzii were more prevalent in stool samples with the probiotic versus placebo. conclusions: the probiotic maintained cd4+ lymphocytes and produced a less inflammatory cytokine profile possibly due to the changes in the microbial communities, which more closely resembled those reported in healthy younger populations.

TI  == a study of the effect of dietary fiber fractions obtained from artichoke (cynara  cardunculus l. var. scolymus) on the growth of intestinal bacteria associated with health.
AB  == the effect of different fractions enriched in soluble fiber obtained from artichoke using citric acid or citric acid/hemicellulase on the selective growth  of lactobacillus plantarum 8114 and bifidobacterium bifidum atcc 11863 was evaluated. gompertz modeling of lactobacillus plantarum 8114 growth showed a higher specific growth rate (mu: 0.16 h(-1)) in the presence of fractions isolated from stems using hemicellulase (fraction a) than in the presence of glucose (mu: 0.09 h(-1)). in the case of bifidobacterium bifidum 11863, the highest mu was obtained for the microorganism grown in the presence of fraction a and for the fraction isolated from stems without hemicellulase, their rate being  twice that observed for glucose (0.04 h(-1)). the positive prebiotic activity scores observed with respect to escherichia coli 25922 indicated that fibers assayed are metabolized as well as glucose by lactobacillus plantarum 8114 and bifidobacterium bifidum atcc 11863 and that they are selectively metabolized by these microorganisms. the potential capacity to selectively stimulate the growth  of intestinal bacteria associated with health shown by fraction a can be ascribed to its high inulin and low methylation degree pectin contents.

TI  == cocktails of probiotics pre-adapted to multiple stress factors are more robust under simulated gastrointestinal conditions than their parental counterparts and  exhibit enhanced antagonistic capabilities against escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == background: the success of the probiotics in delivery of health benefits depends  on their ability to withstand the technological and gastrointestinal conditions;  hence development of robust cultures is critical to the probiotic industry. combinations of probiotic cultures have proven to be more effective than the use  of single cultures for treatment and prevention of heterogeneous diseases. we investigated the effect of pre- adaptation of probiotics to multiple stresses on  their stability under simulated gastrointestinal conditions and the effect of their singular as well as their synergistic antagonistic effect against selected  enteric pathogens. methods: probiotic cultures were inoculated into mrs broth adjusted to ph 2 and incubated for 2 h at 37 degrees c. survivors of ph 2 were subcultured into 2% bile acid for 1 h at 37 degrees c. cells that showed growth after exposure to 2% bile acid for 1 h were finally inoculated in fresh mrs broth and incubated at 55 degrees c for 2 h. the cells surviving were then used as stress adapted cultures. the adapted cultures were exposed to simulated gastrointestinal conditions and their non- adapted counterparts were used to compare the effects of stress adaptation. the combination cultures were tested for their antipathogenic effects on escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus. results: acid and bile tolerances of most of the stress-adapted cells were higher than of the non-adapted cells. viable counts of all the stress-adapted lactobacilli and bifidobacterium longum lmg 13197 were higher after sequential exposure to simulated gastric and intestinal fluids. however, for b. longum bb46  and b. bifidum lmg 13197, viability of non-adapted cells was higher than for adapted cells after exposure to these fluids. a cocktail containing l. plantarum  + b. longum bb46 + b. longum lmg 13197 best inhibited s. aureus while e. coli was best inhibited by a combination containing l. acidophilus la14 150b + b. longum bb46 + b. bifidum lmg 11041. a cocktail containing the six non- adapted cultures  was the least effective in inhibiting the pathogens. conclusion: multi-stress pre-adaptation enhances viability of probiotics under simulated gastrointestinal  conditions; and formulations containing a mixture of multi stress-adapted cells exhibits enhanced synergistic effects against foodborne pathogens.

TI  == interactions of salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar typhimurium with  gut bacteria.
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of the gut microbiota on the growth and survival of s. typhimurium. this was tested in two-species co-cultures and in mixed cultures with a simplified gut model microbiota. subsequently, interactions between s. typhimurium and human faecal bacteria were quantified in  both batch and continuous culture systems simulating the human colon. the exponential growth of s. typhimurium was halted when the population of escherichia coli reached the maximum population density in a two-compartment co-culture system where the two species were separated by a 0.45 mum pore membrane. furthermore, the growth of some gut bacteria such as lactobacillus gasseri and bifidobacterium bifidum was inhibited by the presence of s. typhimurium in the other compartment. the survival of s. typhimurium was severely affected in mixed batch cultures with human faecal samples; a reduction of 10(3)-10(4) cfu/ml in the concentration of s. typhimurium was observed in these cultures. however, no effect on s. typhimurium survival was observed in mixed batch cultures with a simplified gut model microbiota under the same conditions.  the effect of human faecal samples on s. typhimurium in a three-stage continuous  culture was different to that obtained in batch cultures; its growth rather than  survival was affected under these conditions. s. typhimurium growth was inhibited, and the bacterium was therefore eliminated by the continuous flow of the medium. depending upon culturing conditions, the gut microbiota caused either growth inhibition, inactivation or did not affect s. typhimurium.

TI  == nature of the antimicrobial activity of lactobacillus caseibifidobacterium bifidum and bifidobacterium animalis against foodborne pathogenic and spoilage microorganisms.
AB  == the antimicrobial activities as well as the nature of the inhibitory compounds obtained from lactobacillus casei, bifidobacterium bifidum and bifidobacterium animalis strains were assayed on foodborne pathogenic - staphyloccoccus aureus subsp. aureus (ccug atcc(r) 25926) and escherichia coli (atcc(r) 25922) - and spoilage microorganisms - pseudomonas aeruginosa (atcc(r) 27853). test producer strains showed inhibitory effect on all indicator microorganisms in diffusion of  cell-free concentrated supernatant by agar in well methods (10.0-22.5 mm) in periods of 24, 48 and 72 h. inhibitory compounds showed no sensitivity to the action of proteolytic enzyme trypsin and were completely inactivated by adjusting the ph of the cell-free 20 x concentrated supernatant to 7.0. the results demonstrated that antimicrobial substances do not have proteinaceous nature and are caused by the action of organic acids with decreasing medium ph.

TI  == experimental determination and characterization of the gap promoter of bifidobacterium bifidum s17.
AB  == the dna sequence upstream of the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene (gap) of various strains of bifidobacteria is used in a number of vector systems  for homologous and heterologous expression in this group of bacteria. to date none of the bifidobacterial gap promoters (pgap) have been verified experimentally. here, we probe a range of putative bifidobacterial promoters hypothesized to show high constitutive transcriptional activity using a beta-glucuronidase reporter system. in silico analysis revealed a predicted bacterial promoter upstream of the gap gene of bifidobacterium bifidum s17. the corresponding dna sequences was cloned into the promoter probe vector pmdy23 and  yielded highest reporter activities among the promoter sequences tested confirming previous studies. using rapid amplification of cdna ends (5'-race), we identified the transcription start site (tss) of pgap of b. bifidum s17. the experimentally determined tss and the associated -10 and -35 regions do not match with the promoter predicted in silico. moreover, a potential ribosome-binding site (rbs) was identified upstream of the atg start codon of the gap gene, which  is complementary to the 3'-end of the 16s rrna with only 1 mismatch suggesting efficient initiation of translation. alignment of the pgap sequences of a number  of representative bifidobacteria showed a high level of conservation and the presence of -35 and -10 regions, which are similar but not identical to the consensus promoter sequences of house-keeping genes of escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis. collectively, these results confirm the suitability of pgap for high level, constitutive expression in bifidobacteria.

TI  == antioxidant and antibacterial activities of exopolysaccharides from bifidobacterium bifidum wbin03 and lactobacillus plantarum r315.
AB  == the objective of this study was to investigate the antioxidant and antibacterial  activities of exopolysaccharide (eps) from bifidobacterium bifidum wbin03 (b-eps) and lactobacillus plantarum r315 (l-eps). the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (dpph)-radical scavenging, hydroxyl radical-scavenging, and superoxide radical-scavenging abilities were measured to evaluate antioxidant activity. inhibition of erythrocyte hemolysis and lipid peroxidation was also measured. both b-eps and l-eps had strong scavenging ability against dpph and superoxide radicals at high concentration. the inhibitory effect of b-eps on erythrocyte hemolysis was stronger than that of l-eps in a concentration range from 0.30 to 1.00 mg/ml, whereas the hydroxyl scavenging ability of l-eps (39.15 +/- 0.58%) was significantly higher than that of 0.15 mg/ml ascorbic acid (24.33 +/- 1.17%)  and b-eps (17.89 +/- 3.30%) at 0.10 mg/ml. the inhibition of lipid peroxidation of 0.50 mg/ml b-eps and l-eps was 13.48 +/- 1.74% and 12.43 +/- 0.51%, respectively, values lower than that of ascorbic acid at the same concentration (23.20 +/- 1.41%). furthermore, all these abilities were enhanced in a concentration-dependent manner. agar diffusion assay showed that both eps exhibited antibacterial activities against tested pathogens such as cronobacter sakazakii, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, staphyloccocus aureus, candida albicans, bacillus cereus, salmonella typhimurium, and shigella sonnei at 300 mug/ml. in conclusion, both eps have antimicrobial and antioxidant activities and could have applications in the food industry.

TI  == influence of bovine lactoferrin on the growth of selected probiotic bacteria under aerobic conditions.
AB  == bovine lactoferrin (blf) is a natural glycoprotein, and it shows broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. however, reports on the influences of blf on probiotic bacteria have been mixed. we examined the effects of apo-blf (between 0.25 and 128 mg/ml) on both aerobic and anaerobic cultures of probiotics. we found that blf had similar effects on the growth of probiotics under aerobic or anaerobic conditions, and that it actively and significantly (at concentrations of >0.25 mg/ml) retarded the growth rate of bifidobacterium bifidum (atcc 29521), b. longum (atcc 15707), b. lactis (bcrc 17394), b. infantis (atcc 15697), lactobacillus reuteri (atcc 23272), l. rhamnosus (atcc 53103), and l. coryniformis (atcc 25602) in a dose-dependent manner. otherwise, minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) were 128 or >128 mg/ml against b. bifidum, b. longum, b. lactis, l. reuteri, and l. rhamnosus (atcc 53103). with regard to mics, blf showed at least four-fold lower inhibitory effect on probiotics than on pathogens. intriguingly, blf (>0.25 mg/ml) significantly enhanced the growth of rhamnosus (atcc 7469) and l. acidophilus (bcrc 14065) by approximately 40-200 %,  during their late periods of growth. supernatants produced from aerobic but not anaerobic cultures of l. acidophilus reduced the growth of escherichia coli by about 20 %. thus, blf displayed a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on the growth  of most probiotic strains under either aerobic or anaerobic conditions. an antibacterial supernatant prepared from the aerobic cultures may have significant practical use.

TI  == influence of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis against group b streptococcus on  the early newborn gut composition and evaluation of the anti-streptococcus activity of bifidobacterium strains.
AB  == several factors are known to influence the early colonization of the gut in newborns. among them, the use of antibiotics on the mother during labor, referred to as intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (iap), has scarcely been investigated, although this practice is routinely used in group b streptococcus (gbs)-positive  women. this work is therefore aimed at verifying whether iap can influence the main microbial groups of the newborn gut microbiota at an early stage of microbial establishment. fifty-two newborns were recruited: 26 born by mothers negative to gbs (control group) and 26 by mothers positive to gbs and subjected to iap with ampicillin (iap group). selected microbial groups (lactobacillus spp., bidobacterium spp., bacteroides fragilis, clostridium difficile, and escherichia coli) were quantified with real-time pcr on dna extracted from newborn feces. further analysis was performed within the bidobacterium genus by using dgge after amplification with genus-specific primers. results obtained showed a significant decrease of the bifidobacteria counts after antibiotic treatment of the mother. bifidobacteria were found to be affected by iap not only quantitatively but also qualitatively. in fact, iap determined a decrement in the frequency of bidobacterium breve, bidobacterium bifidum, and bidobacterium dentium with respect to the control group. moreover, this study has preliminarily evaluated that some bifidobacterial strains, previously selected for use in infants, have antibacterial properties against gbs and are therefore potential candidates for being applied as probiotics for the prevention of gbs infections.

TI  == lactobacillus strains isolated from infant faeces possess potent inhibitory activity against intestinal alpha- and beta-glucosidases suggesting anti-diabetic potential.
AB  == purpose: inhibitors of intestinal alpha-glucosidases are used therapeutically to  treat type 2 diabetes mellitus. bacteria such as actinoplanes sp. naturally produce potent alpha-glucosidase inhibitor compounds, including the most widely available drug acarbose. it is not known whether lactic acid bacteria (lab) colonising the human gut possess inhibitory potential against glucosidases. hence, the study was undertaken to screen labs having inherent alpha- and beta-glucosidase inhibitory potential. methods: this study isolated, screened, identified and extracted lactobacillus strains (lb1-15) from human infant faecal  samples determining their inhibitory activity against intestinal maltase, sucrase, lactase and amylase. lactobacillus reference strains (ref1-7), a gram positive control (ctrl1) and two gram negative controls (ctrl2-3), were also analysed to compare activity. results: faecal isolates were identified by dna sequencing, with the majority identified as unique strains of lactobacillus plantarum. some strains (l. plantarum, l. fermentum, l. casei and l. rhamnosus) had potent and broad spectrum inhibitory activities (up to 89%; p < 0.001; 500 mg/ml wet weight) comparable to acarbose (up to 88%; p < 0.001; 30 mg/ml). inhibitory activity was concentration-dependent and was freely available in the supernatant, and was not present in other bacterial genera (bifidobacterium bifidum and escherichia coli or salmonella typhimurium). interestingly, the potency and spectrum of inhibitory activity across strains of a single species (l. plantarum) differed substantially. some lactobacillus extracts had broader spectrum activities than acarbose, effectively inhibiting beta-glucosidase activity (lactase) as well as alpha-glucosidase activities (maltase, sucrase and  amylase). anti-diabetic potential was indicated by the fact that oral gavage with a l. rhamnosus extract (1 g/kg) was able to reduce glucose excursions (area under curve; 22%; p < 0.05) in rats during a carbohydrate challenge (starch; 2 g/kg). conclusion: these results definitively demonstrate that lactobacillus strains present in the human gut have alpha- and beta-glucosidase inhibitory activities and can reduce blood glucose responses in vivo. although the potential use of lab such as lactobacillus as a dietary supplement, medicinal food or biotherapeutic for diabetes is uncertain, such an approach might offer advantages over drug therapies in terms of broader spectrum activities and fewer unpleasant side effects. further characterisation of this bioactivity is warranted, and chronic studies should be undertaken in appropriate animal models or diabetic subjects.

TI  == effect of bacterial cell-free supernatants on infectivity of norovirus surrogates.
AB  == bacterial metabolic products were evaluated for inhibitory effects on viral propagation in cell culture. cell-free supernatants (cfs) were prepared from growth of enterococcus faecalis atcc 19433, pseudomonas fluorescens atcc 13525, escherichia coli 08, staphylococcus epidermidis atcc 12228, bacillus subtilis 168, bacillus coagulans 185a, b. coagulans 7050, clostridium sporogenes pa3679, and a commercial probiotic mixture of lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus rhamnosus, bifidobacterium bifidum, lactobacillus salivarius, and streptococcus thermophilus in microbiological medium or milk. the inhibitory effects of cfs on  the propagation of murine norovirus 1 and tulane virus in raw 264.7 and llcmk2 cells, respectively, were evaluated in the continuous presence of cfs or after exposure of host cells to cfs. slight inhibition of viral propagation was observed for murine norovirus and tulane virus in the continuous presence of cfs  of b. subtilis 168 and e. faecalis 19433, respectively. cfs cytotoxicity was also determined by microscopic examination. virus persisted in the cfs that demonstrated cytotoxic effects, suggesting a lack of direct effect of cfs on virions. the viral propagation indicates a general lack of competitive inhibition by bacterial extracellular products and bears significance in understanding the persistence of virus in food and human systems shared by bacteria that are recognized for their colonization and competitive capabilities.

TI  == effect of lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium bifidum supplementation to standard triple therapy on helicobacter pylori eradication and dynamic changes in intestinal flora.
AB  == to investigate lactobacillus acidophilus (l. acidophilus) and bifidobacterium bifidum (b. bifidum) supplementation to triple therapy for helicobacter pylori (h. pylori) eradication and dynamic changes in intestinal flora in children with  h. pylori infection. one hundred h. pylori-infected children were randomly assigned to two groups: treatment group (n = 43), standard triple anti-h. pylori  therapy plus probiotics of l. acidophilus and b. bifidum for 2 weeks followed by  taking probiotics for another 4 weeks; control group (n = 45), standard triple anti-h. pylori therapy for 6 weeks. after 6-week treatment, (1)(3)c-urease breath test was performed and side effects were monitored during the observation period. quantitative pcr with 16s rrna-gene-targeted species-specific primers was carried out for the analysis of human intestinal b. bifidum, l. acidophilus, and escherichia coli (e. coli). as expected, treatment group could significantly enhance the h. pylori eradication rate (83.7 vs. 64.4 %, p < 0.05). b. bifidum, l. acidophilus, and e. coli showed no statistical difference before or after therapy in the treatment group. the number of b. bifidum and l. acidophilus was significantly decreased after 2-week treatment in the control group, but after 6-week treatment it significantly increased and nearly returned to the level before treatment. the number of e. coli increased significantly after 2-week treatment, while after 6-week treatment, it nearly decreased to the level before  treatment. l. acidophilus and b. bifidum supplementation is effective for h. pylori eradication compared with triple therapy alone.

TI  == bopa does not have a major role in the adhesion of bifidobacterium bifidum to intestinal epithelial cells, extracellular matrix proteins, and mucus.
AB  == the ability of bifidobacteria to adhere to the intestine of the human host is considered to be important for efficient colonization and achieving probiotic effects. bifidobacterium bifidum strains dsm20456 and mimbb75 adhere well to the  human intestinal cell lines caco-2 and ht-29. the surface lipoprotein bopa was previously described to be involved in mediating adherence of b. bifidum to epithelial cells, but thioacylated, purified bopa inhibited the adhesion of b. bifidum to epithelial cells in competitive adhesion assays only at very high concentrations, indicating an unspecific effect. in this study, the role of bopa  in the adhesion of b. bifidum was readdressed. the gene encoding bopa was cloned  and expressed without its lipobox and hydrophobic signal peptide in escherichia coli, and an antiserum against the recombinant bopa was produced. the antiserum was used to demonstrate the abundant localization of bopa on the cell surface of  b. bifidum. however, blocking of b. bifidum bopa with specific antiserum did not  reduce adhesion of bacteria to epithelial cell lines, arguing that bopa is not an adhesin. also, adhesion of b. bifidum to human colonic mucin and fibronectin was  found to be bopa independent. the recombinant bopa bound only moderately to human epithelial cells and colonic mucus, and it failed to bind to fibronectin. thus, our results contrast the earlier findings on the major role of bopa in adhesion,  indicating that the strong adhesion of b. bifidum to epithelial cell lines is bopa independent.

TI  == unraveling the leloir pathway of bifidobacterium bifidum: significance of the uridylyltransferases.
AB  == the gnb/lnb (galacto-n-biose/lacto-n-biose) pathway plays a crucial role in bifidobacteria during growth on human milk or mucin from epithelial cells. it is  thought to be the major route for galactose utilization in bifidobacterium longum as it is an energy-saving variant of the leloir pathway. both pathways are present in b. bifidum, and galactose 1-phosphate (gal1p) is considered to play a  key role. due to its toxic nature, gal1p is further converted into its activated  udp-sugar through the action of poorly characterized uridylyltransferases. in this study, three uridylyltransferases (galt1, galt2, and ugpa) from bifidobacterium bifidum were cloned in an escherichia coli mutant and screened for activity on the key intermediate gal1p. galt1 and galt2 showed udp-glucose-hexose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase activity (ec 2.7.7.12), whereas ugpa showed promiscuous utp-hexose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase activity (ec 2.7.7.10). the activity of ugpa toward glucose 1-phosphate was about 33-fold higher than that toward gal1p. galt1, as part of the bifidobacterial leloir pathway, was about 357-fold more active than galt2, the functional analog  in the gnb/lnb pathway. these results suggest that galt1 plays a more significant role than previously thought and predominates when b. bifidum grows on lactose and human milk oligosaccharides. galt2 activity is required only during growth on substrates with a gnb core such as mucin glycans.

TI  == efficacy of different probiotic combinations on death and necrotizing enterocolitis in a premature rat model.
AB  == objective: the aim of the present study was to investigate the most effective probiotic combinations to prevent death and necrotizing enterocolitis (nec) in a  premature rat model. methods: one hundred fifty-eight premature sprague-dawley premature rats were enrolled. probiotic strains bifidobacterium bifidum, b longum, lactobacillus acidophilus, l plantarum, and b breve were fed as a single  strain or mixture with 2 or 3 strains for a total of 9 study groups; control groups received no exogenous probiotic supplement. fecal samples were collected for 72 hours to detect probiotic strains and pathologic strains by real-time polymerase chain reaction. colony counts of probiotic strains escherichia coli and klebsiella were compared between groups before and after 36 hours of the study period. the incidence of death and nec were compared via fisher exact test  between groups. results: the results demonstrated that l plantarum alone (p = 0.0026) and b bifidum with b longum together (p = 0.0017) were more effective in  reducing nec as compared with the control group. all of the study groups except b breve and b bifidum with b breve definitely prevented death compared with controls. b bifidum and b longum together had significantly lower mortality than  the control group (p < 0.0001). colony counts of e coli and klebsiella in stool samples were significantly decreased in the b bifidum, b longum, and l plantarum  group compared with the other study and control groups after 36 hours. conclusions: administration of a mixture of probiotic strains with b bifidum and  b longum was most effective in preventing death and nec in this animal model, and these observations provide an evidence-based strategy for designing further neonatal clinical trials.

TI  == evaluation of adhesion properties and antibacterial activities of the infant gut  commensal bifidobacterium bifidum prl2010.
AB  == bifidobacteria are extensively exploited by the food industry as health-promoting microorganisms. however, very little is known about the molecular mechanisms responsible for these beneficial activities, or the molecular players that sustain their ability to colonize and persist within the human gut. here, we have investigated the enteric adaptation features of the gut commensal bifidobacterium bifidum prl2010, originally isolated from infant feces. this strain was able to survive under gastrointestinal challenges, while it was shown to adhere to human  epithelial intestinal cell monolayers (caco 2 and ht-29), thereby inhibiting adhesion of pathogenic bacteria such as escherichia coli and cronobacter sakazakii.

TI  == antimicrobial potential for the combination of bovine lactoferrin or its hydrolysate with lactoferrin-resistant probiotics against foodborne pathogens.
AB  == previous reports have shown that several probiotic strains can resist the antibacterial activity of bovine lactoferrin (blf), but the results are inconsistent. moreover, a portion of orally administered apo-blf is digested in vivo by pepsin to yield blf hydrolysate, which produces stronger antibacterial activity than that observed with apo-blf. however, whether blf hydrolysate affects the growth of probiotic strains is unclear. therefore, various probiotic  strains in taiwan were collected and evaluated for activity against apo-blf and blf hydrolysate in vitro. thirteen probiotic strains were evaluated, and the growth of lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356, lactobacillus salivarius atcc 11741, lactobacillus rhamnosus atcc 53103, bifidobacterium longum atcc 15707, and bifidobacterium lactis bcrc 17394 were inhibited by both apo-blf and blf hydrolysate. the growth of 8 strains were not affected by apo-blf and blf hydrolysate, including l. rhamnosus atcc 7469, lactobacillus reuteri atcc 23272,  lactobacillus fermentum atcc 11739, lactobacillus coryniformis atcc 25602, l. acidophilus bcrc 14065, bifidobacterium infantis atcc 15697, bifidobacterium bifidum atcc 29521, and pediococcus acidilactici atcc 8081. however, apo-blf and  its hydrolysate inhibited the growth of foodborne pathogens, including escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, staphylococcus aureus, and enterococcus faecalis. moreover, the supernatants produced by l. fermentum, b. lactis, and b.  longum inhibited the growth of most pathogens. importantly, a combination of apo-blf or blf hydrolysate with the supernatants of cultures of the organisms described above showed synergistic or partially synergistic effects against the growth of most of the selected pathogens. in conclusion, several probiotic strains are resistant to apo-blf and blf hydrolysate, warranting clinical studies to evaluate the antimicrobial potential for the combination of apo-blf or its hydrolysate with specific probiotics.

AB  == bifidobacterium bifidum is one of the most frequently found bifidobacteria in the intestines of newborn infants. we previously reported that b. bifidum possesses unique metabolic pathways for o-linked glycans on gastrointestinal mucin (yoshida e, sakurama h, kiyohara m, nakajima m, kitaoka m, ashida h, hirose j, katayama t, yamamoto k, kumagai h. 2012. bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis uses two different beta-galactosidases for selectively degrading type-1 and type-2 human milk oligosaccharides. glycobiology. 22:361-368). the nonreducing termini of o-linked glycans on mucin are frequently covered with histo-blood group antigens. here, we identified a gene agabb from b. bifidum jcm 1254, which encodes glycoside hydrolase (gh) family 110 alpha-galactosidase. agabb is a 1289-amino acid polypeptide containing an n-terminal signal sequence, a gh110 domain, a carbohydrate-binding module (cbm) 51 domain, a bacterial ig-like (big) 2 domain and a c-terminal transmembrane region, in this order. the recombinant enzyme expressed in escherichia coli hydrolyzed alpha1,3-linked gal in branched blood group b antigen [galalpha1-3(fucalpha1-2)galbeta1-r], but not in a linear xenotransplantation antigen (galalpha1-3galbeta1-r). the enzyme also acted on group b human salivary mucin and erythrocytes. we also revealed that cbm51 specifically bound blood group b antigen using both isothermal titration calorimetry and a solid-phase binding assay, and it enhanced the affinity of the  enzyme toward substrates with multivalent b antigens. we suggest that this enzyme plays an important role in degrading b antigens to acquire nutrients from mucin oligosaccharides in the gastrointestinal tracts.

TI  == [interaction of bifidobacterium bifidum with members of normal microflora in human intestine microsymbiocenosis].
AB  == aim: study the influence of exometabolites of b. bifidum on biological properties of bacteria that are the members of normoflora and their ability to interact with associative microsymbionts. materials and methods: bacterial strains that are members of the normal microflora of human intestine: b. bifidum, lactobacillus acidophilus, enterococcusfaecium and escherichia coli lactose positive non-hemolytic (lac "+"/hly "-") were used. as opportunistic microorganisms cultures of e. coli lactose negative hemolytic (lac "-"/hly "+"), klebsiella pneumoniae and staphylococcus aureus were used. isolation and identification of microorganisms was performed by generally accepted methods according to guidances. in the first series of experiments influence of b. bifidum metabolites on biological properties of microorganisms that are members ofnormoflora was studied. in the second series--the influence of bifidobacteria supernatants on interrelations of b. bifidum, l. acidophilus and e. coli lac "+"/hly "-" with opportunistic associants. growth properties (gp), biofilm formation (bff) and anti-lysozyme activity (ala) of microorganisms was studied photometrically. optical density measurement were performed on elx808 (biotek, u.s.a.) photometer. the data obtained were treated by nonparametric method using mann-whitney criteria. results: b. bifidum supernatant was established to stimulate in 33.3-66.7% of cases or did not alter growth/reproduction, bff and ala of microorganisms that are characteristic for eubiosis of intestine including bacteria of the same species that could have implications for realization by bifidobacteria ofbiotope colonization resistance. features of interaction ofexometabolites of bifidobacteria with microorganisms that are characteristic for eubiosis of human intestine consisting in enchantment or changes of effects of the influence of normoflora members on bff of associants were revealed. the maximum enchantment of inhibitory effect of indigenous strains under the influence ofbifidobacteria was noted in associations e. coli lac "+"/hly "-" e. coli lac "-"/hly "+" as well as e. faecium--s. aureus. conclusion: thus, the data obtained may be used for detection of mechanisms of functioning of normal microsymbiocenosis in human associative symbiosis.

TI  == novel bifidobacterium promoters selected through microarray analysis lead to constitutive high-level gene expression.
AB  == for the development of a food-grade expression system for bifidobacterium, a strong promoter leading to high-level expression of cloned gene is a prerequisite. for this purpose, a promoter screening host-vector system for bifidobacterium has been established using beta-glucosidase from bifidobacterium  lactis as a reporter and bifidobacterium bifidum bgn4 as a host, which is beta-glucosidase negative strain. seven putative promoters showing constitutive high-level expression were selected through microarray analysis based on the genome sequence of b. bifidum bgn4. they were cloned into upstream of beta-glucosidase gene and transformed into escherichia coli dh5alpha and b. bifidum bgn4. promoter activities were analyzed both in e. coli and b. bifidum bgn4 by measuring beta-glucosidase activity. beta-glucosidase activities in all of the transformants showed growth-associated characteristics. among them, p919 was the strongest in b. bifidum bgn4 and showed maximum activity at 18 h, while p895 was the strongest in e. coli dh5alpha at 7 h. this study shows that novel strong promoters such as p919 can be used for high-level expression of foreign genes in bifidobacterium and will be useful for the construction of an efficient  food-grade expression system.

TI  == modulation of phenotypic and functional maturation of dendritic cells by intestinal bacteria and gliadin: relevance for celiac disease.
AB  == dc maturation and functions are influenced by microbial and environmental stimuli, which could contribute to immune dysfunction. here, we have investigated the role of enterobacteria (escherichia coli cbl2 and shigella cbd8) isolated from cd patients, bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium longum cect 7347 and bifidobacterium bifidum cect 7365), and gliadins on phenotypic and functional features of mddcs and in coculture with caco-2 cells. the ultimate goal of our study is to understand the roles played by specific components of the gut microbiota in cd. enterobacteria induced marked alterations in mddc morphology, inducing podosome dissolution and dendrites, and activated mddc adhesion and spreading. enterobacteria also induced inflammatory cytokine production (ifn-gamma, tnf-alpha, and il-12), partially resembling the gliadin-induced th1-type cytokine profile. b. longum cect 7347 and b. bifidum cect 7365 induced minor mddc morphological changes and activated adhesion and spreading and inflammatory cytokine production to a lesser extent compared with enterobacteria. b. longum cect 7347 also induced lower cd86 and cd40 expression on mddcs than the two enterobacteria. the aforementioned bifidobacterial strain also reduced gliadin-induced ifn-gamma production and increased il-10 secretion when both stimuli were combined. similar trends were detected for mddcs cocultured with caco-2 cells. b. longum cect 7347 reversed the gliadin-reduced zo-1 expression in caco-2 cells. thus, our results suggest that specific components of the gut microbiota may influence phenotypic and functional maturation of dcs differently  and their interactions with epithelial cells. this could ultimately define the role of dcs in cd progression.

TI  == in vitro inhibition of expression of virulence genes responsible for colonization and systemic spread of enteric pathogens using bifidobacterium bifidum secreted molecules.
AB  == enteric pathogens such as salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium and enterohaemorrhagic escherichia coli require an initial indispensable step of attachment or invasion of enterocytes before they can produce systemic disease and translocate to their target organs. prevention of either of these steps will  result in an avirulent state and limit their pathogenicity. in vitro tests demonstrated that molecules secreted by bifidobacterium bifidum interfere with both attachment and invasion. the main regulatory genes controlling the virulence factors essential for these pathogenicity steps were efficiently down-regulated when treated with chromatographically separated b. bifidum cell free fractions as measured by reporter constructs and confirmed by rt-pcr. moreover, the ability of both pathogens to colonize eukaryotic cells was significantly reduced, and the capacity of salmonella to survive and multiply within macrophages was also diminished upon treatment with these bioactive molecules. these results indicate  that probiotic bifidobacteria strains may represent an effective alternative approach to control food-borne enteric pathogens.

TI  == effect of a synbiotic on microbial community structure in a continuous culture model of the gastric microbiota in enteral nutrition patients.
AB  == patients with dysphagia require long-term nutritional support. this can be delivered by the enteral route via a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (peg) tube. enteral nutrition (en) bypasses the body's innate defences that prevent the microbial colonization of the proximal gut, which predisposes to microbial overgrowth. a continuous culture model simulating the upper gastrointestinal tract microbiota of en patients was used to investigate the effects of a synbiotic (lactobacillus acidophilus dun-311, bifidobacterium bifidum bb-02, bifidobacterium lactis bl-01, synergy 1) on microbial community structure and metabolism. a peg tube was inserted into the fermenters to study biofilm formation. the synbiotic delivered in sterile semi-skimmed milk (sssm) was introduced either 48 h prior to or after peg tube insertion. the synbiotic reduced biofilm formation on peg tube surfaces, with suppression of escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae when it was added subsequent to peg insertion. when synbiotic feeding was commenced prior to peg insertion, colonization by staphylococcus aureus, candida albicans and candida famata was also inhibited. lactate production increased in response the synbiotic or control (sssm). these results indicate that the use of a synbiotic has the potential to reduce pathogen colonization on peg tube surfaces in vivo, thereby reducing the incidence of biofilm-related infectious complications.

TI  == effects of non-fermented and fermented soybean milk intake on faecal microbiota and faecal metabolites in humans.
AB  == the effects of non-fermented soybean milk (nfsm) and fermented soybean milk (fsm) intake on the faecal microbiota and metabolic activities in 10 healthy volunteers were investigated. soybean oligosaccharides, raffinose and stachyose were utilized by bifidobacteria except for bifidobacterium bifidum, but most strains of escherichia coli and clostridium perfringens could not use them. during the dietary administration of fsm, the number of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli in the faeces increased (p < 0.05), and clostridia decreased (p < 0.05). moreover, the concentrations of faecal sulphide were decreased (p < 0.01) in the intake of  fsm. during the dietary administration of nfsm, the number of bifidobacteria tended to increase. these results indicate that the consumption of soybean milk,  especially fsm, is related to improvement of the intestinal environment.

TI  == insights into physiological and genetic mupirocin susceptibility in bifidobacteria.
AB  == mupirocin is an antibiotic commonly used in selective media for the isolation of  bifidobacteria. however, little is known about the genetic traits responsible for bifidobacterial resistance to mupirocin. our investigation demonstrates that all  of the bifidobacteria tested exhibit a phenotype of generally high resistance to  this antibiotic. the genotypic reason for bifidobacterial mupirocin resistance was further characterized by sequencing of the isoleucyl-trna synthetase gene (iles) coupled with three-dimensional modeling of the encoded protein and cloning of the iles gene of bifidobacterium bifidum prl2010 in a mupirocin-sensitive escherichia coli strain. these analyses revealed key amino acid residues of the iles protein that apparently are crucial for conferring a mupirocin resistance phenotype to bifidobacteria.

TI  == role of intestinal bacteria in gliadin-induced changes in intestinal mucosa: study in germ-free rats.
AB  == background and aims: celiac disease (cd) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the small intestine that is induced by dietary wheat gluten proteins (gliadins) in genetically predisposed individuals. the overgrowth of potentially pathogenic  bacteria and infections has been suggested to contribute to cd pathogenesis. we aimed to study the effects of gliadin and various intestinal bacterial strains on mucosal barrier integrity, gliadin translocation, and cytokine production. methodology/principal findings: changes in gut mucosa were assessed in the intestinal loops of inbred wistar-avn rats that were reared under germ-free conditions in the presence of various intestinal bacteria (enterobacteria and bifidobacteria isolated from cd patients and healthy children, respectively) and  cd-triggering agents (gliadin and ifn-gamma) by histology, scanning electron microscopy, immunofluorescence, and a rat cytokine antibody array. adhesion of the bacterial strains to the iec-6 rat cell line was evaluated in vitro. gliadin  fragments alone or together with the proinflammatory cytokine interferon (ifn)-gamma significantly decreased the number of goblet cells in the small intestine; this effect was more pronounced in the presence of escherichia coli cbl2 and shigella cbd8. shigella cbd8 and ifn-gamma induced the highest mucin secretion and greatest impairment in tight junctions and, consequently, translocation of gliadin fragments into the lamina propria. shigella cbd8 and e.  coli cbl2 strongly adhered to iec-6 epithelial cells. the number of goblet cells  in small intestine increased by the simultaneous incubation of bifidobacterium bifidum iata-es2 with gliadin, ifn-gamma and enterobacteria. b. bifidum iata-es2  also enhanced the production of chemotactic factors and inhibitors of metalloproteinases, which can contribute to gut mucosal protection. conclusions:  our results suggest that the composition of the intestinal microbiota affects the permeability of the intestinal mucosa and, consequently, could be involved in the early stages of cd pathogenesis.

TI  == the role of hemagglutination and effect of exopolysaccharide production on bifidobacteria adhesion to caco-2 cells in vitro.
AB  == it is believed that an important criterion for a potential probiotic strain is that it is capable of adhering to mucosal surfaces in the human gastrointestinal  tract. the purpose of this study was to investigate a possible relationship between exopolysaccharide production and adhesion to caco-2 cells by bifidobacterium breve a28 and bifidobacterium bifidum a10. in a preselection process, the hemagglutination abilities of these bacteria were determined prior to undertaking adhesion studies. b. breve a28, which produces large amounts of eps (97.00 +/- 2.00 mg/l) and has good hemagglutination abilities (+3) was found  to adhere strongly to caco-2 cells. under gastrointestinal conditions, the high eps producing- b. breve a28 was found to have better viability and adhesion to caco-2 cells than the low eps producing- b. bifidum a10. also, b. breve a28 was found to be more effective at inhibiting escherichia coli atcc 11229 than b. bifidum a10. this investigation showed that high eps production and adhesion ability may be important in the selection of bifidobacteria as probiotic strains.

TI  == an exo-alpha-sialidase from bifidobacteria involved in the degradation of sialyloligosaccharides in human milk and intestinal glycoconjugates.
AB  == bifidobacteria are health-promoting enteric commensals that are assumed to proliferate predominantly in the intestines of breast-fed infants by assimilating human milk oligosaccharides (hmos) that are frequently fucosylated and/or sialylated. we previously identified two different alpha-l-fucosidases in bifidobacterium bifidum and showed that the strain furnishes an extracellular degradation pathway for fucosylated hmos. however, the catabolism of sialylated hmos by bifidobacteria has remained unresolved. here we describe the identification and characterization of an exo-alpha-sialidase in bifidobacteria.  by expression cloning, we isolated a novel exo-alpha-sialidase gene (siabb2) from b. bifidum jcm1254, which encodes a protein (siabb2) consisting of 835-amino-acid residues with a predicted molecular mass of 87 kda. siabb2 possesses an n-terminal signal sequence, a sialidase catalytic domain classified into the glycoside hydrolase family 33 (gh33) and a c-terminal transmembrane region, indicating that the mature siabb2 is an extracellular membrane-anchored enzyme. the recombinant enzyme expressed in escherichia coli showed the highest activity  in an acidic ph range from 4.0 to 5.0, and at 50 degrees c. notably, 80% activity remained after 30 min incubation at 80 degrees c, indicating that the enzyme is highly thermostable. siabb2 liberated sialic acids from sialyloligosaccharides, gangliosides, glycoproteins and colominic acid; however, the linkage preference of the enzyme was remarkably biased toward the alpha2,3-linkage rather than alpha2,6- and alpha2,8-linkages. expression of siabb2 in b. longum 105-a, which has no endogenous exo-alpha-sialidase, enabled this strain to degrade sialyloligosaccharides present in human milk. our results suggest that siabb2 plays a crucial role in bifidobacterial catabolism of sialylated hmos.

TI  == highlighting new phylogenetic specificities of crohn's disease microbiota.
AB  == background: recent studies suggest that gastrointestinal (gi) microbes play a part in the pathogenesis of crohn's disease (cd). methods: fecal samples were collected from 16 healthy individuals and 16 cd patients (age- and sex-matched).  the dna extracted from these samples were subjected to two different methods of microbiome analysis. specific bacterial groups were quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) methods using primers designed using a high-throughput in-house bioinformatics pipeline. the same dna extracts were also used to produce fluorescently labeled crna amplicons to interrogate a custom-designed phylogenetic microarray for intestinal bacteria. results: even though the intersubject variability was high, differences in the fecal microbiomes of healthy and cd patients were detected. faecalibacterium prausnitzii and escherichia coli were more represented in healthy and ileal cd patients, respectively. additionally, probes specific for ruminococcus bromii, oscillibacter valericigenes, bifidobacterium bifidum, and eubacterium rectale produced stronger hybridization signals with the dna samples from healthy subjects. conversely, species overrepresented in cd patients were e. coli, enterococcus faecium, and species from the proteobacteria not normally found in the healthy human gi tract. furthermore, we detected "healthy specific" molecular species or operational taxonomic units (otus) that are not closely related to any known species (faecalibacterium, subdoligranulum, and oscillospora species), indicating that the phylogenetic dysbiosis is broader than at strain or species level. conclusions: these two techniques of microbiome analysis provided a statistically robust new picture of the dysbiosis in fecal microbiota from ileal  cd patients. specifically, we identified a set of six species discriminant for cd, which provides a preliminary diagnostic tool.

TI  == dietary glycosaminoglycans interfere in bacterial adhesion and gliadin-induced pro-inflammatory response in intestinal epithelial (caco-2) cells.
AB  == dietary components may have an important role in maintaining a balanced gut microbiota composition. celiac disease is an autoimmune enteropathy caused by gliadins, and has been associated with a reduced proportion of bifidobacterium in gut microbiota. this study evaluates the influence of glycosaminoglycans (gags) on bacterial adhesion and their contribution in the gliadins-induced inflammatory response. the adhesion of potential probiotic (bifidobacterium longum cect 7347 and bifidobacterium bifidum cect 7365), commensal (escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis) and pathogenic (salmonella enterica cect 443 and listeria monocytogenes cect 935) bacteria to mucin and caco-2 cell cultures was determined. gliadins were subjected to in vitro digestion (pepsin/pancreatin-bile), with/out gags, and the presence or not of cell suspensions of b. longum (10(8) cfu/ml). b. longum, e. coli, and l. monocytogenes, markedly interact with the high-sulphur-containing fraction of gags. the gags reduced the gliadins-mediated production of interleukin-1beta, but not tumour necrosis factor-alpha. the results suggest that gags may ameliorate gliadin-induced inflammatory response, though they also slightly interfere with the action of b. longum.

TI  == lactobacillus acidophilus induces virus immune defence genes in murine dendritic  cells by a toll-like receptor-2-dependent mechanism.
AB  == lactobacilli are probiotics that, among other health-promoting effects, have been ascribed immunostimulating and virus-preventive properties. certain lactobacillus spp. have been shown to possess strong interleukin-12 (il-12) -inducing properties. as il-12 production depends on the up-regulation of type i interferons (ifns), we hypothesized that the strong il-12-inducing capacity of lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm in murine bone-marrow-derived dendritic cells (dcs) is caused by an up-regulation of ifn-beta, which subsequently induces il-12 and the double-stranded rna binding toll-like receptor-3 (tlr-3). the expression  of the genes encoding ifn-beta, tlr-3, il-12 and il-10 in dcs upon stimulation with l. acidophilus ncfm was determined. lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm induced a much stronger expression of ifn-beta, il-12 and il-10 compared with the synthetic double-stranded rna ligand poly i:c, whereas the levels of expressed tlr-3 were similar. whole genome microarray gene expression analysis revealed that other genes related to viral defence were significantly up-regulated and among the strongest induced genes in dcs stimulated with l. acidophilus ncfm. the ability to induce ifn-beta was also detected in another l. acidophilus strain (x37), but  was not a property of other probiotic strains tested, i.e. bifidobacterium bifidum z9 and escherichia coli nissle 1917. the ifn-beta expression was markedly reduced in tlr-2(-/-) dcs, dependent on endocytosis, and the major cause of the induction of il-12 and tlr-3 in dcs stimulated with l. acidophilus ncfm. collectively, our results reveal that certain lactobacilli trigger the expression of viral defence genes in dcs in a tlr-2 manner dependent on ifn-beta.

AB  == bifidobacteria are predominant bacteria present in the intestines of breast-fed infants and offer important health benefits for the host. human milk oligosaccharides are one of the most important growth factors for bifidobacteria  and are frequently fucosylated at their non-reducing termini. previously, we identified 1,2-alpha-l-fucosidase (afca) belonging to the novel glycoside hydrolase (gh) family 95, from bifidobacterium bifidum jcm1254 (katayama t, sakuma a, kimura t, makimura y, hiratake j, sakata k, yamanoi t, kumagai h, yamamoto k. 2004. molecular cloning and characterization of bifidobacterium bifidum 1,2-alpha-l-fucosidase (afca), a novel inverting glycosidase (glycoside hydrolase family 95). j bacteriol. 186:4885-4893). here, we identified a gene encoding a novel 1,3-1,4-alpha-l-fucosidase from the same strain and termed it afcb. the afcb gene encodes a 1493-amino acid polypeptide containing an n-terminal signal sequence, a gh29 alpha-l-fucosidase domain, a carbohydrate binding module (cbm) 32 domain, a found-in-various-architectures (fivar) domain and a c-terminal transmembrane region, in this order. the recombinant enzyme was  expressed in escherichia coli and was characterized. the enzyme specifically released alpha1,3- and alpha1,4-linked fucosyl residues from 3-fucosyllactose, various lewis blood group substances (a, b, x, and y types), and lacto-n-fucopentaose ii and iii. however, the enzyme did not act on glycoconjugates containing alpha1,2-fucosyl residue or on synthetic alpha-fucoside (p-nitrophenyl-alpha-l-fucoside). the afca and afcb genes were introduced into the b. longum 105-a strain, which has no intrinsic alpha-l-fucosidase. the transformant carrying afca could utilize 2'-fucosyllactose as the sole carbon source, whereas that carrying afcb was able  to utilize 3-fucosyllactose and lacto-n-fucopentaose ii. we suggest that afca and afcb play essential roles in degrading alpha1,2- and alpha1,3/4-fucosylated milk  oligosaccharides, respectively, and also glycoconjugates, in the gastrointestinal tracts.

TI  == dynamics of bacterial community in solid-state fermented feed revealed by 16s rrna.
AB  == aims: the aim of the present study was to monitor the changes in the composition  of microbiota in solid-state fermented feed and to evaluate their biosafety. methods and results: in the solid-state fermentation, six probiotic bacteria strains were used as inoculum and soybean meal were used as carbohydrate source.  at 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10 and 15 days, samples were collected for further analysis. denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) analysis showed that bifidobacterium bifidum and bacillus licheniformis were always present throughout the fermentation. bifidobacterium bifidum, enterococcus faecalis and lactobacillus acidophilum were dominant throughout the entire fermentation as monitored by lactobacillus-specific pcr-dgge. probiotics supplementation could reduce the levels of the pathogenic bacteria such as staphylococcus aureus and enterotoxigenic escherichia coli (etec) by species-specific real-time pcr. and salmonella spp. was not detected throughout the entire fermentation. conclusions: probiotics supplemented are always dominant throughout the whole period of solid-state fermentation and effective in preventing the growth of pathogens. significance and impact of the study: based on the results, the high quality, stable solid-state fermented feed could be produced and applied in the pigs to improve the animal performances.

TI  == in vitro anti-adhesive activity of green tea extract against pathogen adhesion.
AB  == camellia sinensis polysaccharide has been reported to possess anti-adhesive activity against pathogens. the present study was designed to investigate whether hot water extracts obtained from green tea leaves might inhibit pathogen adhesion to human or mouse cell lines. green tea extract-4 (csi-4) with the maximum yield  of 4% (w/v) is composed of a major proportion of carbohydrates containing 40% uronic acids, but lack of catechins. it showed strong inhibitory activities against hemagglutination mediated by pathogens helicobacter pylori, propionibacterium acnes and staphylococcus aureus with the minimum inhibitory concentrations of 0.01-0.5 mg/ml. csi-4 further demonstrated an inhibitory effect on the adhesion of these pathogens to host cell lines with the ic(50) values (50% inhibition of adhesion) of 0.14-2.3 mg/ml. it exhibited the highest activity against p. acnes, but no inhibitory effects were observed against lactobacillus acidophilus, bifidobacterium bifidum, escherichia coli, or staphylococcus epidermidis. our results suggest that csi-4 may exert a selective anti-adhesive effect against certain pathogenic bacteria with no adverse effects against beneficial or commensal bacteria.

TI  == comparative analysis of four beta-galactosidases from bifidobacterium bifidum ncimb41171: purification and biochemical characterisation.
AB  == four different beta-galactosidases (previously named bbgi, bbgii, bbgiii and bbgiv) from bifidobacterium bifidum ncimb41171 were overexpressed in escherichia  coli, purified to homogeneity and their biochemical properties and substrate preferences comparatively analysed. bbgi was forming a hexameric protein complex  of 875 kda, whereas bbgii, bbgiii and bbgiv were dimers with native molecular masses of 178, 351 and 248 kda, respectively. bbgii was the only enzyme that preferred acidic conditions for optimal activity (ph 5.4-5.8), whereas the other  three exhibited optima in more neutral ph ranges (ph 6.4-6.8). na(+) and/or k(+)  ions were prerequisite for bbgi and bbgiv activity in bis-tris-buffered solutions, whereas mg(++) was strongly activating them in phosphate-buffered solutions. bbgii and bbgiii were slightly influenced from the presence or absence of cations, with mg(++), mn(++) and ca(++) ions exerting the most positive effect. determination of the specificity constants (k(cat)/k(m)) clearly indicated that bbgi (6.11 x 10(4) s(-1) m(-1)), bbgiii (2.36 x 10(4) s(-1) m(-1)) and especially bbgiv (4.01 x 10(5) s(-1) m(-1)) are highly specialised in the hydrolysis of lactose, whereas bbgii is more specific for beta-d-(1-->6) galactobiose (5.59 x 10(4) s(-1) m(-1)) than lactose (1.48 x 10(3) s(-1) m(-1)).  activity measurements towards other substrates (e.g. beta-d-(1-->6) galactobiose, beta-d-(1-->4) galactobiose, beta-d-(1-->4) galactosyllactose, n-acetyllactosamine, etc.) indicated that the beta-galactosidases were complementary to each other by hydrolysing different substrates and thus contributing in a different way to the bacterial physiology.

TI  == a novel alpha-galactosidase from bifidobacterium bifidum with transgalactosylating properties: gene molecular cloning and heterologous expression.
AB  == a genomic library of bifidobacterium bifidum (ncimb 41171) dna was constructed in escherichia coli ra11r (mela(-)b(+)) and one alpha-galactosidase encoding gene was isolated. conceptual translation combined with insertional mutagenesis analysis indicated an open reading frame (orf) of 759 amino acid (aa) residues encoding an alpha-galactosidase (named as mela) of 82.8 kda. partial purification and characterisation showed that the enzyme had an apparent native molecular mass of approximately 243 kda and a subunit size of approximately 85 kda. the enzyme belongs to glycosyl hydrolases 36 family with high aa sequence similarities (approximately 73%) to other known alpha-galactosidases of bifidobacterial origin. under optimum ph conditions for activity (ph 6.0) and high melibiose concentration (40% w/v), the enzyme was able to form oligosaccharides with degree of polymerisation (dp) > or = 3 at higher concentration than dp = 2, with a total yield of 20.5% (w/w).

TI  == effects of probiotic bacteria and their genomic dna on th1/th2-cytokine production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) of healthy and allergic  subjects.
AB  == among the factors potentially involved in the increased prevalence of allergic diseases, modification of the intestinal flora or lack of microbial exposure during childhood has been proposed. t(h)2-cytokines increase the production of ige and stimulate mast cells and eosinophils, whereas t(h)1-cytokines, such as ifn-gamma, may suppress ige synthesis and stimulate the expression of the secretory piece of iga. thus, a dysregulation in the expression of t(h)1- and t(h)2-cytokines may contribute to the initiation and maintenance of allergic diseases. lactobacilli belonging to the natural intestinal microflora were reported to reduce the incidence of atopic dermatitis and the severity of allergic manifestations and to modulate t(h)1/t(h)2 responses. the mechanisms still remain to be elucidated. we sought to assess the effect of different probiotics, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, lactobacillus gasseri (pa16/8), bifidobacterium bifidum (mp20/5), and bifidobacterium longum (sp07/3), on the t(h)1 and t(h)2 responses of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) from healthy subjects and from patients with allergy against house dust mite to staphylococcus enterotoxin a (sea) and dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (dpt). to elucidate the molecular basis of these effects, the effects of bacterial genomic  dna were compared with the effects of viable bacteria. pbmcs from allergic patients and from healthy donors were incubated for 24 or 48 h, respectively, with or without sea and dpt allergens. the effects of preincubation with live probiotic bacteria and the effect of their genomic dna, added simultaneously to cultures and incubated for 24h, were assessed by measuring t(h)1/t(h)2-cytokine production. the tested live gram-positive probiotic bacteria and their genomic dna inhibited sea- and dpt-stimulated secretion of t(h)2-cytokines (il-4 and il-5) and enhanced the stimulation of ifn-gamma. this effect was dose-dependent with a dosage-optimum, which was identical for all lactic acid producing bacteria (lab) tested (10 bacteria per pbmc) and their dna (75 ng/ml). based on the maximal effects achieved with lab and their dna, more than 50% of the effects seem to be contributed by dna. no significant effect was induced by the control,  gram-negative escherichia coli tg1. lactobacilli and bifidobacteria reduced sea-stimulated il-4 and il-5 production more effectively in pbmcs from healthy subjects than from allergic patients. in contrast to this, inhibition of dpt-stimulated il-4- and il-5-secretion was more pronounced in cells from allergic subjects. compared with living lab, bacterial dna inhibited il-4- and il-5-secretion in a similar manner. sea- and even more so dpt-stimulated ifn-gamma stimulation by living lab was less pronounced in allergic than in healthy subjects, whereas ifn-gamma stimulation by their dna was more pronounced  in allergic subjects. the tested probiotic bacteria as well as their genomic dna  modulated the t(h)1/t(h)2 response to some allergens dose-dependently. dna seems  to contribute to 50% of the effect exerted by living bacteria in this in vitro model. the magnitude of the probiotic effects differed between healthy and allergic subjects. whether the modulation found for the tested strains might be useful for the prevention and treatment of allergic diseases has to be assessed in clinical trials.

TI  == characterization of plasmids from human infant bifidobacterium strains: sequence  analysis and construction of e. coli-bifidobacterium shuttle vectors.
AB  == a survey of infant fecal bifidobacterium isolates for plasmid dna revealed that a significant portion of the strains, 17.6%, carry small plasmids. the majority of  plasmid-harboring strains belonged to the bifidobacterium longum/infantis group.  most of the plasmids could be assigned into two groups based on their sizes and the restriction profiles. three plasmids, pb44 (3.6 kb) from b. longum, pb80 (4.9 kb) from bifidobacterium bifidum, and pb21a (5.2kb) from bifidobacterium breve were sequenced. while the former two plasmids were found to be highly similar to  previously characterized rolling-circle replicating pkj36 and pkj56, respectively, the third plasmid, pb21a, does not share significant nucleotide homology with known plasmids. however, it might be placed into the pcibb1-like group of bifidobacterial rolling-plasmids based on the homology of its rep protein and the overall molecular organization. two sets of escherichia coli-bifidobacterium shuttle vectors constructed based on pb44 and pb80 replicons were capable of transforming b. bifidum and b. breve strains with efficiency up to 3x10(4)cfu/microg dna. additionally, an attempt was made to employ a broad host range conjugation element, rp4, in developing of e. coli-bifidobacterium gene transfer system.

TI  == characterisation of glutamine fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase (ec 2.6.1.16) and n-acetylglucosamine metabolism in bifidobacterium.
AB  == bifidobacterium bifidum, in contrast to other bifidobacterial species, is auxotrophic for n-acetylglucosamine. growth experiments revealed assimilation of  radiolabelled n-acetylglucosamine in bacterial cell walls and in acetate, an end-product of central metabolism via the bifidobacterial d: -fructose-6-phosphate shunt. while supplementation with fructose led to reduced n-acetylglucosamine assimilation via the d: -fructose-6-phosphate shunt, no significant difference was observed in levels of radiolabelled n-acetylglucosamine incorporated into cell walls. considering the central role played by glutamine fructose-6-phosphate transaminase (glms) in linking the biosynthetic pathway for n-acetylglucosamine to hexose metabolism, the glms of bifidobacterium was characterized. the genes encoding the putative glms of b. longum dsm20219 and b. bifidum dsm20082 were cloned and sequenced. bioinformatic  analyses of the predicted proteins revealed 43% amino acid identity with the escherichia coli glms, with conservation of key amino acids in the catalytic domain. the b. longum glms was over-produced as a histidine-tagged fusion protein. the purified c-terminal his-tagged glms possessed glutamine fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase activity as demonstrated by synthesis of glucosamine-6-phosphate from fructose-6-phosphate and glutamine. it also possesses an independent glutaminase activity, converting glutamine to glutamate  in the absence of fructose-6-phosphate. this is of interest considering the apparently reduced coding potential in bifidobacteria for enzymes associated with glutamine metabolism.

TI  == comparison of the concentrations of phenolic compounds in olive oils and other plant oils: correlation with antimicrobial activity.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of different edible vegetable oils was studied. in vitro results revealed that the oils from olive fruits had a strong bactericidal  action against a broad spectrum of microorganisms, this effect being higher in general against gram-positive than gram-negative bacteria. thus, olive oils showed bactericidal activity not only against harmful bacteria of the intestinal  microbiota (clostridium perfringens and escherichia coli) also against beneficial microorganisms such as lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium bifidum. otherwise, most of the foodborne pathogens tested (listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella enterica, yersinia sp., and shigella sonnei) did not survive after 1 h of contact with olive oils. the dialdehydic form of decarboxymethyl oleuropein and ligstroside aglycons, hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol,  were the phenolic compounds that statistically correlated with bacterial survival. these findings were confirmed by testing each individual phenolic compound, isolated by hplc, against l. monocytogenes. in particular, the dialdehydic form of decarboxymethyl ligstroside aglycon showed a potent antimicrobial activity. these results indicate that not all oils classified as "olive oil" had similar bactericidal effects and that this bioactivity depended on their content of certain phenolic compounds.

AB  == the aim of the present study was to study different strains of bifidobacteria for adhesion to caco-2 intestinal epithelial cells (iecs) and to test for the mrna response of these cells following interaction with bifidobacteria. adhesion was tested at different ph conditions using model epithelia consisting of transwell cultures of fully differentiated caco-2 cells. microarrays were used to characterize changes in global expression profiles of caco-2 cells co-cultured with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) and challenged with non-pathogenic escherichia coli d2241 or four different strains of bifidobacteria. furthermore, cytokine mrna of iecs in responses to challenge with bifidobacterium bifidum s17 or e. coli d2241 was tested in pbmc-sensitised caco-2 cells using rt-pcr. bifidobacteria showed strain-specific adhesion to caco-2. shift of apical ph from 7 to 4.5 resulted in strain-specific changes of adhesion. global expression profiles of pbmc-sensitised caco-2 cells revealed differential  expression of a significant number of genes only after challenge with e. coli d2241 while cells were essentially unresponsive to challenge with four strains of bifidobacteria showing different adhesion properties. using a rt-pcr approach, in the same system a similar differential expression after challenge with e. coli d2241 or b. bifidum s17 was observed for various immune markers. the presented results suggest that caco-2 cells might be specifically unresponsive to challenge with bifidobacteria irrespective of the level of adhesion.

TI  == a novel galactooligosaccharide mixture increases the bifidobacterial population numbers in a continuous in vitro fermentation system and in the proximal colonic  contents of pigs in vivo.
AB  == prebiotics are nondigestible food ingredients that encourage proliferation of selected groups of the colonic microflora, thereby altering the composition toward a more beneficial community. in the present study, the prebiotic potential of a novel galactooligosaccharide (gos) mixture, produced by the activity of galactosyltransferases from bifidobacterium bifidum 41171 on lactose, was assessed in vitro and in a parallel continuous randomized pig trial. in situ fluorescent hybridization with 16s rrna-targeted probes was used to investigate changes in total bacteria, bifidobacteria, lactobacilli, bacteroides, and clostridium histolyticum group in response to supplementing the novel gos mixture. in a 3-stage continuous culture system, the bifidobacterial numbers for  the first 2 vessels, which represented the proximal and traverse colon, increased (p < 0.05) after the addition of the oligosaccharide mixture. in addition, the oligosaccharide mixture strongly inhibited the attachment of enterohepatic escherichia coli (p < 0.01) and salmonella enterica serotype typhimurium (p < 0.01) to ht29 cells. addition of the novel mixture at 4% (wt:wt) to a commercial  diet increased the density of bifidobacteria (p < 0.001) and the acetate concentration (p < 0.001), and decreased the ph (p < 0.001) compared with the control diet and the control diet supplemented with inulin, suggesting a great prebiotic potential for the novel oligosaccharide mixture.

AB  == the anti-infectious activity of probiotic bifidobacteria against shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli (stec) o157:h7 was examined in a fatal mouse stec infection model. stable colonization of the murine intestines was achieved by the oral administration of bifidobacterium breve strain yakult (naturally resistant to streptomycin sulfate) as long as the mice were treated with streptomycin in their drinking water (5 mg/ml). the pathogenicity of stec infection, characterized by marked body weight loss and subsequent death, observed in the infected controls was dramatically inhibited in the b. breve-colonized group. moreover, stx production by stec cells in the intestine was almost completely inhibited in the b. breve-colonized group. a comparison of  anti-stec activity among several bifidobacterium strains with natural resistance  to streptomycin revealed that strains such as bifidobacterium bifidum atcc 15696  and bifidobacterium catenulatum atcc 27539(t) did not confer an anti-infectious activity, despite achieving high population levels similar to those of effective  strains, such as b. breve strain yakult and bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum dsm 20439. the effective strains produced a high concentration of acetic acid (56 mm) and lowered the ph of the intestine (to ph 6.75) compared to the infected control group (acetic acid concentration, 28 mm; ph, 7.15); these effects were thought to be related to the anti-infectious activity of these strains because the combination of a high concentration of acetic acid and a low ph was found to inhibit stx production during stec growth in vitro.

TI  == in vitro inhibition of escherichia coli o157:h7 by bifidobacterial strains of human origin.
AB  == the ability of bifidobacteria isolated from infant feces to inhibit enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli serotype o157:h7 in vitro and reduce its adhesion to human enterocyte-like caco-2 cells was evaluated in comparison to american type culture collection bifidobacterial reference strains. five bifidobacterium isolates from infant feces were identified and characterized by morphology, fructose-6-phosphate phosphoketolase (f6ppk) assay, polymerase chain  reaction using bifidobacterial 16s rdna specific primers, carbohydrate fermentation patterns, resistance to lysozyme, acid, bile and hydrogen peroxide as well as their ability to inhibit e. coli o157:h7 using the agar spot technique. infant isolates showed greater resistance to bile, acid, lysozyme and  more antimicrobial activity against e. coli o157:h7 than atcc strains. two infant isolates identified as b. bifidum rbl 71 and b. bifidum rbl 460 showed good adhesion and significant potential for reducing adhesion of e. coli o157:h7 to caco-2 cells. this effect was dependent on bifidobacterial cell concentration. these results show that bifidobacteria isolated from infants may be useful for improving probiotic formulae with respect to protection against e. coli o157:h7 infection.

TI  == in vitro growth responses of bifidobacteria and enteropathogens to bovine and human lactoferrin.
AB  == a series of in vitro experiments was performed to test the ability of bovine and  human lactoferrin to influence the growth of the gram-positive probiotic bacteria, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium infantis, and lactobacillus acidophilus, as well as the gram-negative enteric bacteria, e. coli o157:h7 and salmonella typhimurium. none of the lactoferrin preparations stimulated the growth of the tested strains. however, iron-free apo-lactoferrin (bovine and human) and 66% iron-saturated bovine lactoferrin dramatically slowed the growth of e. coli o157:h7 in single culture experiments, while 98% iron-saturated preparations had no effect. in coculture experiments of b. infantis and e. coli,  the iron-limited preparations of lactoferrin also slowed the growth of the latter without inhibiting the bifidobacteria. these results suggest that lactoferrin in  iron-limited forms may have the potential to be combined with probiotic bacteria  in biotherapeutic products, which could help balance human gut microflora and limit the overgrowth of certain enteric microorganisms.

TI  == growth-inhibiting effects of seco-tanapartholides identified in artemisia princeps var. orientalis whole plant on human intestinal bacteria.
AB  == aims: the present work aimed at isolating antibacterial constituents from the whole plant of artemisia princeps var. orientalis active towards nine human intestinal bacteria. methods and results: the growth-inhibiting activities of materials derived from the artemisia whole plant towards test bacteria were examined using an impregnated paper disc method. the biologically active constituents of the artemisia whole plant were characterized as the sesquiterpene lactones seco-tanapartholides a and b by spectroscopic analysis. in a test using  1 mg per disc, seco-tanapartholides a and b produced a clear inhibitory effect against clostridium perfringens, bacteroides fragilis and staphylococcus aureus.  these compounds did not affect the growth of test lactic acid-producing bacteria  (bifidobacterium adolescentis, bif. breve, lactobacillus acidophilus and lact. casei) and escherichia coli, whereas weak growth inhibition towards bif. bifidum  was observed. at 0.5 mg per disc, seco-tanapartholides a and b exhibited moderate growth inhibition towards cl. perfringens but weak growth inhibition towards bact. fragilis and staph. aureus. conclusions: inhibitory action of seco-tanapartholides a and b towards specific bacteria without any adverse effects on lactic acid-producing bacteria may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of a. princeps var. orientalis whole plant. significance and impact of the study: these naturally occurring artemisia whole plant-derived materials could be useful as a new preventive agent against various diseases caused by harmful intestinal bacteria such as clostridia.

TI  == high-efficiency synthesis of oligosaccharides with a truncated beta-galactosidase from bifidobacterium bifidum.
AB  == an exceptionally large beta-galactosidase, bif3, with a subunit molecular mass of 188 kda (1,752 amino acid residues) was recently isolated from bifidobacterium bifidum dsm20215 [moller et al. (2001) appl environ microbiol 67:2276-2283]. the  bif3 polypeptide comprises a signal peptide followed by an n-terminal beta-galactosidase region and a c-terminal galactose-binding motif. we have investigated the functional importance of the c-terminal part of the bif3 sequence by deletion mutagenesis and expression of truncated enzyme variants in escherichia coli. deletion of approximately 580 amino acid residues from the c-terminal end converted the enzyme from a normal, hydrolytic beta-galactosidase  into a highly efficient, transgalactosylating enzyme. quantitative analysis showed that the truncated beta-galactosidase utilised approximately 90% of the reacted lactose for the production of galacto-oligosaccharides, while hydrolysis  constituted a 10% side reaction. this 9:1 ratio of transgalactosylation to hydrolysis was maintained at lactose concentrations ranging from 10% to 40%, implying that the truncated beta-galactosidase behaved as a "true" transgalactosylase even at low lactose concentrations.

TI  == in vitro investigations of the effect of probiotics and prebiotics on selected human intestinal pathogens.
AB  == abstract this study investigated the effects of selected probiotic microorganisms, in combination with prebiotics, on certain human intestinal food-borne pathogens. probiotics grown with different carbohydrate sources were observed to inhibit growth of escherichia coli, campylobacter jejuni and salmonella enteritidis, with the extent of inhibition varying according to the carbohydrate source provided. prebiotics identified as being preferentially utilised by the probiotics tested were oligofructose (fos), inulin, xylo-oligosaccharide (xos), and mixtures of inulin:fos (80:20 w/w) and fos:xos (50:50 w/w). two of the probiotics, lactobacillus plantarum and bifidobacterium bifidum were selected for further co-culture experiments. each was combined with  the selected prebiotics, and was observed to inhibit pathogen growth strongly. results suggested that acetate and lactate were directly conferring antagonistic  action, which was not necessarily related to a lowering of culture ph.

TI  == selective growth inhibitor toward human intestinal bacteria derived from pulsatilla cernua root.
AB  == among 21 medicinal plants, the growth-inhibiting activity of pulsatilla cernua root-derived materials toward human intestinal bacteria was examined by using an  impregnated paper disk method. the biologically active components of p. cernua roots were characterized as 4-hydroxy-3-methoxycinnamic acid and 3,4-dihydroxycinnamic acid by spectroscopic analysis. the activity was compared with that of six commercially available cinnamic acid derivatives trans-cinnamaldehyde, trans-cinnamic acid, cinnamyl alcohol, 2-methoxycinnamic acid, 3-methoxycinnamic acid, and 4-methoxycinnamic acid. the growth responses varied with each bacterial strain tested. two isolated compounds revealed a potent inhibition against clostridium perfringens, and moderate to weak activity  against escherichia coli was exhibited by 4-hydroxy-3-methoxycinnamic acid. weak  or no inhibitory activity was obtained against the bifidobacteria or lactobacillus acidophilus. the inhibitory effect was much more pronounced in c. perfringens and e. coli as compared to b. adolescentis, b. bifidum, b. fragilis,  b. longum, or l. acidophilus. cinnamaldehyde exhibited a strong growth-inhibiting activity, but no inhibition was observed from treatments with trans-cinnamic acid, cinnamyl alcohol, 2-methoxycinnamic acid, 3-methoxycinnamic acid, and 4-methoxycinnamic acid. these results may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of p. cernua root.

TI  == intra- and extracellular beta-galactosidases from bifidobacterium bifidum and b.  infantis: molecular cloning, heterologous expression, and comparative characterization.
AB  == three beta-galactosidase genes from bifidobacterium bifidum dsm20215 and one beta-galactosidase gene from bifidobacterium infantis dsm20088 were isolated and  characterized. the three b. bifidum beta-galactosidases exhibited a low degree of amino acid sequence similarity to each other and to previously published beta-galactosidases classified as family 2 glycosyl hydrolases. likewise, the b.  infantis beta-galactosidase was distantly related to enzymes classified as family 42 glycosyl hydrolases. one of the enzymes from b. bifidum, termed bif3, is most  probably an extracellular enzyme, since it contained a signal sequence which was  cleaved off during heterologous expression of the enzyme in escherichia coli. other exceptional features of the bif3 beta-galactosidase were (i) the monomeric  structure of the active enzyme, comprising 1,752 amino acid residues (188 kda) and (ii) the molecular organization into an n-terminal beta-galactosidase domain  and a c-terminal galactose binding domain. the other two b. bifidum beta-galactosidases and the enzyme from b. infantis were multimeric, intracellular enzymes with molecular masses similar to typical family 2 and family 42 glycosyl hydrolases, respectively. despite the differences in size, molecular composition, and amino acid sequence, all four beta-galactosidases were highly specific for hydrolysis of beta-d-galactosidic linkages, and all four enzymes were able to transgalactosylate with lactose as a substrate.

TI  == bifidobacterium bifidum exhibits a lipopolysaccharide-like mitogenic activity for murine b lymphocytes.
AB  == to determine the role of bifidobacteria in the systemic and mucosal antibody response, we examined the direct modulatory effect of bifidobacteria on the synthesis of antibodies by murine spleen b cells. whole spleen b cells were cultured with bifidobacterium bifidum or clostridium perfringens (welch's bacilli, negative control), and antibody synthesis was measured by elisa and enzyme-linked immunospot assay. the b. bifidum, but not c. perfringens, substantially increased total secretion of major immunoglobulin (ig) isotypes and the number of iga-secreting cells. in addition, b. bifidum increased proliferation of spleen cells by threefold, and c. perfringens had little to diminishing effect on the cells. these results indicate that b. bifidum increased ig synthesis through its mitogenic influence on b cells. further, b. bifidum induced spleen b cells to be reactive to transforming growth factor-beta 1 and interleukin-5 and resulted in increased surface iga expression (approximately threefold) and total iga production (> 20-fold) but not increased production of igm and igg2a isotypes. together, these studies indicate that b. bifidum can act  as a lipopolysaccharide-like polyclonal activator for b cells. furthermore, that  bifidobacteria enable b cells to respond to transforming growth factor-beta 1 and interleukin-5 for the iga production has important implications for the primary defense against pathogens in the gastrointestinal tract.

TI  == ability of lactoferrin to promote the growth of bifidobacterium spp. in vitro is  independent of receptor binding capacity and iron saturation level.
AB  == lactoferrin (lf) is an iron-binding protein which has been shown to inhibit the growth of various bacterial pathogens and promote the growth of anaerobic bacteria of the genus bifidobacterium in vitro. the present study was designed to investigate whether the bifidobacteria growth promotion activity of lf is correlated with either the binding of lf to bifidobacterial cells or the iron saturation of lf. bovine lf (blf) from mature milk increased the growth of b. infantis and b. breve in vitro in a dose-dependent fashion, while much less growth promotion activity was found for b. bifidum. in contrast, human lf (hulf)  from mature milk promoted the growth of b. bifidum and was inactive for b. infantis and b. breve, while blf from colostrum was devoid of bifidobacteria growth promotion activity. changes in the iron content of lf did not alter the bifidobacteria growth promotion activity of either blf or hulf preparations. competitive binding studies with biotinylated milk blf showed that binding of blf was inhibited by unlabelled blf and hulf but not by beta-lactoglobulin, alpha-lactalbumin or transferrin. binding of blf to b. bifidum and b. breve was c. 40-fold higher than binding to escherichia coli. colostrum blf was also found  to bind to b. bifidum and b. breve, despite a lack of in-vitro growth promotion activity. collectively, these results demonstrate that the ability of lf to promote the growth of bifidobacterium spp. in vitro is independent of the iron saturation level for lf and suggest that binding of lf to bifidobacteria cells may be involved but is not sufficient for stimulation of bifidobacterial growth.

TI  == immune modulation of blood leukocytes in humans by lactic acid bacteria: criteria for strain selection.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria in food can transiently colonize the intestine and exert beneficial effects (probiotic). survival during intestinal transit or adhesion to epithelium or both seem to be important for modifying the host's immune reactivity. because lactobacillus acidophilus strain la1 is adherent to enterocytes in vitro, we hypothesize that contact with immune cells may occur in  vivo. however, bifidobacterium bifidum strain bb12, which shows high fecal colonization, is another potential immunomodulator. twenty-eight volunteers were  divided into two groups and given a fermented product containing one of the two strains. lymphocyte subsets and leukocyte phagocytic activity were studied in blood. no modifications were detected in lymphocyte subsets. in contrast, phagocytosis of escherichia coli ssp. was enhanced in both groups (p < 0.001 for  both). bacterial adhesion to enterocytes, fecal colonization, or both seem to be  valuable selection criteria for immunomodulation. antiinfective mechanisms of defense can be enhanced after ingestion of specific lactic acid bacteria strains.

AB  == previous studies in our laboratory suggested that lactobacillus acidophilus strain dds-1 (la1) has a suppressive effect on chemically induced tumors in experimental animals. in an effort to understand the possible mechanisms underlying this effect, we investigated the ability of la1 to induce the production of interleukin-1 alpha (il-1 alpha) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha), which have potent cytocidal and cytostatic effects on tumor cells. the mouse macrophage cell line raw264.7 was incubated with live or heat-killed cells of four strains of l. acidophilus or bifidobacterium bifidum. escherichia coli was used as a source of lipopolysaccharide that is known to induce the above cytokines. the amount of the cytokines present in the culture fluid was quantitated by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. la1 induced the production of higher levels of il-1 alpha and tnf-alpha than other lactobacilli and bifidobacteria. stimulation of the production of the cytokines was not due to the lipopolysaccharide (lps) component, since lps at concentrations equivalent to, or 100-fold greater than, that of la1 induced only negligible amounts of il-1 alpha  and tnf-alpha. these results reveal that non-lps component(s) of la1 stimulate(s) the production of il-1 alpha and tnf-alpha by macrophages, indicating that this organism stimulates the production of immunologic factors.

TI  == [the stimulating action of exogenous rnase on eubiotic strains of lactobacillus,  bifidobacterium and escherichia coli].
AB  == the influence of bacillus intermedius rnaase on the multiplication on b.b.bifidum, l.fermentum and e. coli was studied. the study revealed that the stimulating action depended on the dose of the enzyme, the microbial species and  the growth phase of the inoculate. rnaase, added to the nutrient medium, was shown to induce the acceleration of the synthesis of dna, rna, protein, as well as mitosis. at the same time the stimulating action of rnaase was accompanied not only by the reduction of the duration of the lag phase, but in some cases even by an increase in the specific growth rate.

TI  == characterization of the lactose transport system in the strain bifidobacterium bifidum dsm 20082.
AB  == lactose was fermented but not assimilated by the strain bifidobacterium bifidum dsm 20082. the sugar uptake was measured with lactose 14c. km and v(max) values were respectively 2.6 mm and 12.11 nmol/min/mg of cell protein. the lactose transport system and the beta-d-galactosidase were stimulated when the cells were grown with lactose, but isopropyl-beta-d-thiogalactopyranoside had no effect. lactose uptake was inhibited by compounds which interfered with proton and metal  ionophore. na+, li+, or k+ did not affect incorporation of lactose. furthermore,  the lactose uptake decreased when an inhibitor of atp synthesis was used. from the results of this study, the stain contained an active lactose transport system, probably a proton symport as described for escherichia coli but with a different regulation system.

TI  == [antimutagenic action of bacterial culture liquid on mutagenesis induced by 2-nitrofluorene in salmonella typhimurium strains].
AB  == it was shown that cell extracts and cells of streptococcus faecalis decrease the  mutagenic effect of 2-nitrofluorene in salmonella typhimurium strain ta1538 by 73 and 48%, respectively. cell extracts and cells of bifidobacterium bifidum and propionibacterium shermanii exhibited weak antimutagenic activity. no antimutagenic effect was found in escherichia coli ab1157, lactobacillus delbrueckii, or streptococcus thermophilus. antimutageneicity of the cell extract of str. faecalis is both associated with extracellular factors interacting with 2-nitrofluorene (desmutagenesis) and with factors affecting intracellular processes of mutagen biotransformation and mutation induction. thiol compounds produced by growing str. faecalis may be desmutagenic factors. a relatively heat-stable substance or substances of a peptide nature with a mm less than 12 kda are antimutagenic factors affecting intracellular processes of mutagenesis.

TI  == immunomodulation of human blood cells following the ingestion of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == because of the lack of data that convincingly show immunomodulatory properties of lactic acid bacteria in humans, a study was performed in which healthy volunteers were divided into two groups and given a fermented milk product supplemented with lactobacillus acidophilus strain la1 or bifidobacterium bifidum strain bb 12 for  3 wk. blood was sampled throughout the study to assess changes in lymphocyte subsets or leukocyte phagocytic activity following consumption of the fermented products. no modifications of lymphocyte subpopulations were detected. in contrast, phagocytosis of escherichia coli sp. in vitro was enhanced after the administration of both fermented products. the increment in phagocytosis was coincident with fecal colonization by the lactic acid bacteria and persisted for  6 wk after ingestion of the fermented products. by this time, the fecal lactobacilli and bifidobacteria had returned to concentrations prior to consumption. nonspecific, anti-infective mechanisms of defense can be enhanced by the ingestion of specific lactic acid bacteria strains. these strains can be used as nutritional supplements to improve the immune function of particular age groups, i.e., the neonate or the elderly, for which these functions are diminished.

TI  == [antimutagenic action of bacteria on mutagenesis induced by 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide in salmonella typhimurium].
AB  == it is shown that in the presence of culture liquid and cells of propionibacterium shermanii, p. pentosaceum, p. thoenii, p. coccoides, p. acnes, lactobacillus delbrueckii, streptococcus thermophilus, str. faecalis, bifidobacterium bifidum,  and escherichia coli ab 1157 the mutagenicity of 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (4-nqo) in salmonella typhimurium ta 100 decreases significantly. the highest antimutagenic (desmutagenic) activity was found in culture liquid from all strains tested in the logarithmic growth phase; on aging of the cultures their antimutagenic activity decreased. the cells passaged in the medium containing 4-nqo demonstrate a higher antimutagenic activity than the control cells, and this effect is not related to the cell mutation. young cultures of all studied propionic bacteria and of str. faecalis release thiol compounds into medium. thiol accumulation in culture liquid from p. shermanii between 10 and 24 h was accompanied by culture transition to the active growth. over 24 h thiol content decreased. the maximal thiol accumulation by 24 h coincided with the maximal desmutagenic activity of the culture. it is suggested that desmutagenesis of the  bacteria studied towards 4-nqo is connected with their production of reducing (possibly, sulfur-containing) compounds that inactivate electrophilic groups of the mutagen.

TI  == influence of intestinal bacterial flora on cytokine (il-1, il-6 and tnf-alpha) production by mouse peritoneal macrophages.
AB  == the effect of bacterial flora on cytokine production from resident peritoneal macrophages was investigated in the mouse. the production of il-1, il-6 and tnf-alpha was determined in germ-free, and "conventionalized" mice, as well as in monoxenic mice implanted with either the gram-negative bacterium e. coli, or the  gram-positive organism bifidobacterium bifidum. macrophages from the "conventionalized" mice produced significantly more il-1 and il-6 in vitro than those of the germ-free mice. il-1 and il-6 production from germ-free mice implanted with e. coli was comparable to that from "conventionalized" mice. however, implantation with bifidobacterium bifidum did not increase production of these two cytokines above levels observed for macrophages from the germ-free mice. a little tnf-alpha was produced by only the macrophages from the "conventionalized" and monoxenic mice implanted with e. coli. soon after implantation, the bacterial flora stimulated cytokine production by mouse peritoneal macrophages and our results suggest that gram negative bacteria are the most efficient stimulus for this production.

TI  == antibacterial spectrum of lactoferricin b, a potent bactericidal peptide derived  from the n-terminal region of bovine lactoferrin.
AB  == a physiologically diverse range of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria was found to be susceptible to inhibition and inactivation by lactoferricin b, a peptide produced by gastric pepsin digestion of bovine lactoferrin. the list of susceptible organisms includes escherichia coli, salmonella enteritidis, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris, yersinia enterocolitica, pseudomonas aeruginosa, campylobacter jejuni, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus mutans, corynebacterium diphtheriae, listeria monocytogenes and clostridium perfringens.  concentrations of lactoferricin b required to cause complete inhibition of growth varied within the range of 0.3 to 150 micrograms/ml, depending on the strain and  the culture medium used. the peptide showed activity against e. coli o111 over the range of ph 5.5 to 7.5 and was most effective under slightly alkaline conditions. its antibacterial effectiveness was reduced in the presence of na+, k+, mg2+ or ca2+ ions, or in the presence of various buffer salts. lactoferricin  b was lethal, causing a rapid loss of colony-forming capability in most of the species tested. pseudomonas fluorescens, enterococcus faecalis and bifidobacterium bifidum strains were highly resistant to this peptide.

AB  == the sensitivity of lymphocytes of healthy persons to s. aureus peptidoglycan as compared with that to the polyclonal stimulator zymosan c3b and peptidoglycans of other bacteria (streptococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, bacterium bifidum) was  analyzed with a test system permitting the determination of specific reactivity to peptidoglycans. the analysis showed that at the peak of luminol-dependent chemiluminescence (25-30 minutes) individual reactivity to s. aureus peptidoglycan varied within wide limits (the coefficient of lymphocyte stimulation was 1.4-9.6, 3.5 +/- 0.6), exceeding sensitivity to other bacteria, as well as the values obtained in the negative control. the conclusion of the wide spread of sensitization to s. aureus peptidoglycan and the possibility of using this preparation for the study of cell-mediated immunity reactions was made.

TI  == effect of lactic acid producing bacteria on the human intestinal microflora during ampicillin treatment.
AB  == 20 healthy volunteers participated in a double blind study concerning the effect  of lactic acid producing bacteria on the intestinal microflora during ampicillin  treatment. 10 volunteers received 500 mg ampicillin tablets t.i.d. together with  capsules containing lactic acid producing bacteria (lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium bifidum) for 7 days, and the other 10 volunteers were given 500 mg ampicillin tablets together with placebo capsules t.i.d. for 7 days. both groups of volunteers continued the intake of the capsules t.i.d. for another 14 days after the ampicillin administration had been completed. the number of enterococci, streptococci and corynebacteria decreased during ampicillin administration but returned to normal levels after 14 days. yeasts increased during the antibiotic treatment but returned to the same levels as before treatment within 14 days. escherichia coli strains were suppressed in most volunteers during ampicillin administration. the numbers of anaerobic gram-positive cocci and rods decreased in most subjects during ampicillin treatment but were normalized within 2 weeks. bacteroides strains were recovered  in higher numbers in the lactic acid producing bacteria group compared to the placebo group. the volunteers receiving lactic acid producing bacteria were recolonized slightly faster than those having placebo. there were adverse effects observed in 3 subjects receiving ampicillin plus placebo. in the lactic acid producing bacteria group, one subject had diarrhoea on day 3 to on day 3 to day 7.

TI  == purification and certain properties of a bacteriocin from streptococcus mutans.
AB  == an inhibition factor from streptococcus mutans strain c3603 (serotype c) was purified and isolated, and its properties indicated that it was a bacteriocin. bacteriocin c3603 is a basic protein with a pi value of 10 and a molecular weight of 4,800. the activity of this bacteriocin was not affected by ph over a range of 1.0 to 12.0 or by storage at 100 degrees c for 10 min at ph 2.0 to 7.0 or storage at 121 degrees c for 15 min at ph 4.0. pronase; papain, phospholipase c, trypsin, and alpha-amylase had no effect on the activity of the bacteriocin, whereas alpha-chymotrypsin and pancreatin were partially active against it. bacteriocin activity was greater against certain s. mutans strains of serotypes b, c, e, and  f than against certain s. mutans strains of serotypes a, d, and g. bacteriocin c3603 was also effective against selected strains of s. sanguis, s. salivarius, s. bovis, s. faecium, s. lactis, lactobacillus casei, l. plantarum, l. fermentum, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium longum, propionibacterium acnes, and bacteroides melaninogenicus, but it was not effective against certain strains of  escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, corynebacterium parvum, and candida albicans. the inhibition of s. mutans strains bht and ps-14 by bacteriocin c3603  was found to be due to the bacteriocidal activity of the bacteriocin. when water  or a diet containing bacteriocin c3603 was consumed by gnotobiotic and specific pathogen-free rats infected with s. mutans ps-14, the caries score was found to be significantly reduced.

AB  == the interactions between bifidobacterium bifidum n4 (b. bifidum) and escherichia  coli k-12 (e. coli) were investigated in their mixed cultures. under conditions in which both bacteria grew well in their pure culture, b. bifidum inhibited the  growth of e. coli even when the latter was inoculated at 10(4)-fold and preincubated for 41 hr. the inhibition in the mixed cultures appeared when the ph values were reduced below 4.6. when the lowering of ph was prevented by the addition of naoh, no inhibition was observed. at the same initial ph of 6.5, lactic acid and acetic acid, metabolites of b. bifidum, had more inhibitory effect on the growth of e. coli than other aliphatic fatty acids. on the other hand, in the mixed cultures with e. coli, b. bifidum grew in the absence of its essential vitamins, riboflavin and pantetheine and, furthermore, aerobically.
