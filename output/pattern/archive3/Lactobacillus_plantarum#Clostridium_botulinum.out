partial characterization of bacteriocins produced by two lactobacilus strains with probiotic properties.
the probiotic characteristics of lactobacillus brevis bg18 and lb. plantarum bg33, isolated from traditional turkish tulum cheese were assessed. these two bacteriocinproducer strains exhibited good probiotic characteristics such as resistance in media containing 0.3% bile salt, pepsin (3 mg ml(-)(1)), and pancreatine (1 mg ml(-)(1)) as well as acid resistance at ph 2. they were also adhered to caco-2 epithelial cells in a manner comparable to escherichia coli lmg3083 (etec) and salmonella typhimurium sl1344. the strains produced a heat-stable antimicrobial compound that was shown to be proteinaceous in nature, and therefore, referred to as bacteriocins. the bacteriocins were able to inhibit growth of a number grampositive bacteria such as listeria monocytogenes, clostridium botulinum, staphylococcus aureus and bacillus cereus. tricine-sds-page of the active fraction resulted in single bands with estimated molecular masses of 2.5 kda and 2.7 kda for lb. brevis bg18 and lb. plantarum bg33 bacteriocins, respectively.
inhibitory spectra and modes of antimicrobial action of gallotannins from mango kernels (mangifera indica l.).
this study investigated the antimicrobial activities and modes of action of penta-, hexa-, hepta-, octa-, nona-, and deca-o-galloylglucose (gallotannins) isolated from mango kernels. the mics and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) against food-borne bacteria and fungi were determined using a critical dilution assay. gram-positive bacteria were generally more susceptible to gallotannins than were gram-negative bacteria. the mics of gallotannins against bacillus subtilis, bacillus cereus, clostridium botulinum, campylobacter jejuni, listeria monocytogenes, and staphylococcus aureus were 0.2 g liter(-1) or less; enterotoxigenic escherichia coli and salmonella enterica were inhibited by 0.5 to 1 g liter(-1), and lactic acid bacteria were resistant. the use of lipopolysaccharide mutants of s. enterica indicated that the outer membrane confers resistance toward gallotannins. supplementation of lb medium with iron eliminated the inhibitory activity of gallotannins against staphylococcus aureus, and siderophore-deficient mutants of s. enterica were less resistant toward gallotannins than was the wild-type strain. hepta-o-galloylglucose sensitized lactobacillus plantarum tmw1.460 to hop extract, indicating inactivation of hop resistance mechanisms, e.g., the multidrug resistance (mdr) transporter hora. carbohydrate metabolism of lactococcus lactis mg1363, a conditionally respiring organism, was influenced by hepta-o-galloylglucose when grown under aerobic conditions and in the presence of heme but not under anaerobic conditions, indicating that gallotannins influence the respiratory chain. in conclusion, the inhibitory activities of gallotannins are attributable to their strong affinity for iron and likely additionally relate to the inactivation of membrane-bound proteins.
bacteriocin-mediated inhibition of clostridium botulinum spores by lactic acid bacteria at refrigeration and abuse temperatures.
the bacteriocinogenicity of lactococcus lactis atcc 11454, pediococcus pentosaceus atcc 43200, p. pentosaceus atcc 43201, lactobacillus plantarum bn, l. plantarum lb592, l. plantarum lb75, and lactobacillus acidophilus n2 against clostridium botulinum spores at 4, 10, 15, and 35 degrees c was investigated by modified deferred and simultaneous antagonism methods. all the strains, except l. acidophilus n2, produced inhibition zones on lawns of c. botulinum spores at 30 degrees c. l. plantarum bn, l. lactis atcc 11454, and p. pentosaceus atcc 43200 and 43201 were bacteriocinogenic at 4, 10, and 15 degrees c. supplementation of brain heart infusion agar with 0 to 5% nacl increased the radii of inhibition zones during simultaneous antagonism assays. detectable bacteriocin activities were extracted from freeze-thawed agar cultures of l. plantarum bn and l. lactis atcc 11454 which had been grown at 4 and 10 degrees c. these results suggest that low levels of l. plantarum bn or l. lactis atcc 11454, in the presence of 3 or 4% nacl, could be formulated into minimally processed refrigerated food products for protection against possible botulism hazards.
