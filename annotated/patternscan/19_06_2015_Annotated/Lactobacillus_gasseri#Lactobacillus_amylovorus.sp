TI  == distinctive intestinal lactobacillus communities in six-month-old infants from rural malawi and south-western finland.
AB  == objectives: our aim was to compare the composition and diversity of lactobacillus microbiota in infants living in malawi and south-western finland. methods: the composition and diversity of the lactobacillus group was analyzed in the feces of healthy six-month-old infants living in rural malawi (n = 44) and south-western finland (n = 31), using the quantitative polymerase chain reaction method (qpcr)  and pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis fingerprinting (dgge). results: malawian infants had higher counts of lactobacilli than their finnish counterparts (7.45 log cells/g vs. 6.86 log cells/g, p < 0.001, respectively) and the lactobacillus community was richer and more diverse in the malawian infants.  leuconostoc citreum and weissella confusa were the predominant species in both study groups, but malawian infants were more often colonized by these species (100 % vs. 74.2 % p < 0.001; 95.5 % vs. 41.9 %, p < 0.001, respectively). moreover, lactobacillus ruminis, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus mucosae were detected more often in the malawian infants (59.1  % vs. 0.0 %, p < 0.001; 38.6 % vs. 9.7 %, p = 0.004; 29.5 % vs. 0.0 %, p < 0.001; 22.7 % vs. 3.2 %, p = 0.017, respectively). however, lactobacillus casei group species were only detected in the finnish infants. conclusions: malawian infants  have a more abundant lactobacillus microbiota with a distinct composition compared to finnish infants. the environment, including diet and hygiene, may be  among the factors influencing these differences.

TI  == vaginal lactobacillus gasseri cmul57 can inhibit herpes simplex type 2 but not coxsackievirus b4e2.
AB  == this study aimed at demonstrating the antiviral activity of lactobacillus gasseri cmul57 (l. gasseri cmul57), l. acidophilus cmul67 and l. plantarum cmul140 against herpes simplex type 2 (hsv-2) and coxsackievirus b4e2 (cvb4e2), which are enveloped and naked viruses, respectively. these lactobacilli were non-cytotoxic  and were able to reduce the cytopathic effect induced by hsv-2 in vero cell monolayers. however, lactobacilli were not active against cvb4e2. tested lactobacilli displayed anti-hsv-2 activity when they were co-incubated with the virus prior to inoculating the mixture to vero cell monolayers. the detection of  hsv-2 dna by pcr in pellets of bacteria/virus mixtures let us to hypothesize that anti-hsv-2 activity of lactobacilli resulted from the viruses' entrapment. this study showed the capabilities of vaginal lactobacilli to inhibit enveloped viruses such as hsv-2.

TI  == solution structure of acidocin b, a circular bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus acidophilus m46.
AB  == acidocin b, a bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus acidophilus m46, was originally reported to be a linear peptide composed of 59 amino acid residues. however, its high sequence similarity to gassericin a, a circular bacteriocin from lactobacillus gasseri la39, suggested that acidocin b might be circular as well. acidocin b was purified from culture supernatant by a series of hydrophobic interaction chromatographic steps. its circular nature was ascertained by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (maldi-tof) mass spectrometry and tandem mass spectrometry (ms/ms) sequencing. the peptide sequence was found to consist of 58 amino acids with a molecular mass of 5,621.5  da. the sequence of the acidocin b biosynthetic gene cluster was also determined  and showed high nucleotide sequence similarity to that of gassericin a. the nuclear magnetic resonance (nmr) solution structure of acidocin b in sodium dodecyl sulfate micelles was elucidated, revealing that it is composed of four alpha-helices of similar length that are folded to form a compact, globular bundle with a central pore. this is a three-dimensional structure for a member of subgroup ii circular bacteriocins, which are classified based on their isoelectric points of approximately 7 or lower. comparison of acidocin b with carnocyclin a, a subgroup i circular bacteriocin with four alpha-helices and a pi of 10, revealed differences in the overall folding. the observed variations could be attributed to inherent diversity in their physical properties, which also required the use of different solvent systems for three-dimensional structural elucidation.

TI  == sortase-deficient lactobacilli: effect on immunomodulation and gut retention.
AB  == surface proteins of probiotic microbes, including lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus gasseri, are believed to promote retention in the gut and mediate host-bacterial communications. sortase, an enzyme that covalently couples a subset of extracellular proteins containing an lpxtg motif to the cell surface, is of particular interest in characterizing bacterial adherence and communication with the mucosal immune system. a sortase gene, srta, was identified in l. acidophilus ncfm (lba1244) and l. gasseri atcc 33323 (lgas_0825). additionally, eight and six intact sortase-dependent proteins were predicted in l. acidophilus  and l. gasseri, respectively. due to the role of sortase in coupling these proteins to the cell wall, deltasrta deletion mutants of l. acidophilus and l. gasseri were created using the upp-based counterselective gene replacement system. inactivation of sortase did not cause significant alteration in growth or survival in simulated gastrointestinal juices. meanwhile, both deltasrta mutants  showed decreased adhesion to porcine mucin in vitro. murine dendritic cells exposed to the deltasrta mutant of l. acidophilus or l. gasseri induced lower levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines tnf-alpha and il-12, respectively, compared  with the parent strains. in vivo co-colonization of the l. acidophilus deltasrta  mutant and its parent strain in germ-free 129s6/svev mice resulted in a significant one-log reduction of the deltasrta mutant population. additionally, a similar reduction of the deltasrta mutant was observed in the caecum. this study  shows for the first time that sortase-dependent proteins contribute to gut retention of probiotic microbes in the gastrointestinal tract.

TI  == the effect of probiotics supplementation on helicobacter pylori eradication rates and side effects during eradication therapy: a meta-analysis.
AB  == background: previous meta-analyses reported that probiotics improve the effectiveness of helicobacter pylori (h. pylori) eradication during antibiotic therapy, while results regarding a possible reduction of side effects remained inconclusive. moreover, the effectiveness of different strains of probiotics has  not been studied so far. it is further conceivable that probiotics will produce additional effects only if antibiotics are relatively ineffective. methods: this  meta-analysis includes eligible randomized controlled trials examining effects of probiotics supplementation on eradication rates (er) and side effects, published  up to may 2014. sub-group analysis was performed to compare different probiotic strains and antibiotic therapies with different effectiveness in controls (er <80% vs.>80%). publication bias was assessed with funnel plots and harbord's test. the quality of the trials was assessed with the cochrane risk of bias tool. results: thirty-three rcts involving a total of 4459 patients met the inclusion criteria in case of eradication rates of which 20 assessed total side effects in  addition. overall, the pooled eradication rate in probiotics supplementation groups was significantly higher than in controls (itt analysis: rr 1.122, 95% ci  1.086-1.159, pp analysis: rr 1.114, 95% ci 1.070-1.159). sub group-analysis could, however, confirm this finding only for four individual strains (lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei dn-114001, lactobacillus gasseri, and bifidobacterium infantis 2036) and for relatively ineffective antibiotic therapies. there was a significant difference between groups in the overall incidence of side effects (rr 0.735, 95% ci 0.598-0.902). this result was, however, only confirmed for non-blinded trials. conclusions: the pooled data suggest that supplementation with specific strains of probiotics compared with eradication therapy may be considered an option for increasing eradication rates, particularly when antibiotic therapies are relatively ineffective. the impact on  side effects remains unclear and more high quality trials on specific probiotic strains and side effects are thus needed.

TI  == screening of different probiotic strains for their in vitro ability to metabolise oxalates: any prospective use in humans?
AB  == background: oxalate is the salt-forming ion of oxalic acid and can generate oxalate salts combining with various cations, such as sodium, potassium, magnesium, and calcium. approximately 75% of all kidney stones are composed primarily of calcium oxalate (caox) and hyperoxaluria, a condition involving high urinary oxalate concentration, is considered a primary risk factor for kidney stone formation, known as nephrolithiasis. current therapeutic strategies often fail in their compliance or effectiveness, and caox stone recurrence is still common. after an initial stone, there is a 50% chance of forming a second stone within 7 years if the condition is left untreated. the potential therapeutic application of some probiotics, mainly lactobacilli and bifidobacteria, in reducing hyperoxaluria in vivo through intestinal oxalate degrading activity is compelling and initial reports are promising. this study was undertaken to screen different lactobacillus and bifidobacterium strains for their capacity to degrade oxalate in vitro using reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc). methods: the oxalate-degrading activity of 13 lactobacilli and 5 bifidobacteria was tested using a novel hplc method after growth in a broth culture added with 10 mm ammonium oxalate. experiments were repeated 3 times. oxalobacter formigenes (dsm 4420) was used as positive reference to validate hplc oxalate-degrading capability assays. results: lactobacillus strains were more efficient than bifidobacteria in degrading oxalates. l. paracasei lpc09 (dsm 24243) gave the best result, as 68.5% of ammonium oxalate was converted at the end of incubation, whereas the following best converters belong to the l. gasseri and l. acidophilus species. the relatively low conversion rate observed for most  bifidobacteria can probably be attributed to intrinsic oxalate toxicity toward this genus. conclusions: humans lack the enzymes needed to directly metabolise oxalate, and this potentially toxic compound is, therefore, managed using alternative pathways. as oxalate-degrading bacteria are present in the endogenous microbiota of the human intestine, although with significant individual differences, it is possible to hypothesise that the administration of selected oxalate-degrading probiotics could be an alternative and innovative approach to reducing the intestinal absorption of oxalate and the resulting urinary excretion.

TI  == development of an integration mutagenesis system in lactobacillus gasseri.
AB  == lactobacillus gasseri atcc 33323 is a member of the acidophilus-complex group, microbes of human origin with significant potential for impacting human health based on niche-specific traits. in order to facilitate functional analysis of this important species, a upp-based counterselective chromosomal integration system was established and employed for targeting the lipoteichoic acid (lta) synthesis gene, ltas, in l. gasseri atcc 33323. the ltas gene encodes a phosphoglycerol transferase responsible for building the glycerol chain of lta. no isogenic mutant bearing the deletion genotype was recovered, but an integration knockout mutant was generated with insertion inactivation at the ltas locus. the ltas deficient derivative exhibited an altered cellular morphology and significantly reduced ability to adhere to caco-2 intestinal cell monolayers, relative to the wild-type parent strain.

TI  == identification of lactobacilli from deep carious lesions by means of species-specific pcr and maldi-tof mass spectrometry.
AB  == background: the aim of the present study was to compare maldi-tof results for the identification of 87 lactobacilli, isolated from soft or hard carious dentin from 70 first molars of 7- to 8-year-old children with those obtained by species-specific pcr. methods: the 87 isolates were analyzed by maldi-tof ms (microflex lt, maldi biotyper 3.0, bruker daltonik, bremen, germany), using a reference data base of 4110 strains including > 90 lactobacillus species. for the identification with species-specific pcr, oligonucleotide primers (16s rrna) specific for l. casei, l. paracasei, l. rhamnosus, l. gasseri, l. plantarum, and  l. acidophilus were used; type strains served as controls. the pcr-products were  separated electrophoretically on a 1.5% agarose gel and identified by their position on the gel. results: for 93% of the strains both methods produced concordant results: 40 strains were identified as l. rhamnosus, 16 as l. paracasei subsp. paracasei, 15 as l. paracasei subsp. tolerans, 4 as l. paracasei, 3 as l. gasseri, 2 as l. plantarum, and 1 as l. casei. in 4.5% of the  cases the results were discordant. of the 3 strains, not identified by species-specific pcr, 1 strain was identified by maldi-tof ms as l. spec. and 1 as l. parabuchneri. one strain could not be identified by either method. conclusions: both methods are highly sensitive. limitations can be the precision  of the primers (pcr) or the scarcity of strains from a certain habitat in the data base. additional information is necessary for the strains without or with discordant identification.

TI  == evaluation of phytate-degrading lactobacillus culture administration to broiler chickens.
AB  == probiotics have been demonstrated to promote growth, stimulate immune responses,  and improve food safety of poultry. while widely used, their effectiveness is mixed, and the mechanisms through which they contribute to poultry production are not well understood. microbial phytases are increasingly supplemented in feed to  improve digestibility and reduce antinutritive effects of phytate. the microbial  origin of these exogenous enzymes suggests a potentially important mechanism of probiotic functionality. we investigated phytate degradation as a novel probiotic mechanism using recombinant lactobacillus cultures expressing bacillus subtilis phytase. b. subtilis phya was codon optimized for expression in lactobacillus and cloned into the expression vector ptrk882. the resulting plasmid, ptd003, was transformed into lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus gallinarum, and lactobacillus gasseri. sds-page revealed a protein in the culture supernatants of lactobacillus ptd003 transformants with a molecular weight similar to that of the b. subtilis phytase. expression of b. subtilis phytase increased phytate degradation of l. acidophilus, l. gasseri, and l. gallinarum approximately 4-, 10-, and 18-fold over the background activity of empty-vector transformants, respectively. phytase-expressing l. gallinarum and l. gasseri were administered to broiler chicks fed a phosphorus-deficient diet. phytase-expressing l. gasseri  improved weight gain of broiler chickens to a level comparable to that for chickens fed a control diet adequate in phosphorus, demonstrating proof of principle that administration of phytate-degrading probiotic cultures can improve performance of livestock animals. this will inform future studies investigating whether probiotic cultures are able to provide both the performance benefits of feed enzymes and the animal health and food safety benefits traditionally associated with probiotics.

TI  == [phenotypic and genotypic characterization of probiotic bacterial strains used in medicinal products].
AB  == introduction: the optimization of quality testing strategy of products containing probiotics might allow to general improvement of its safer use in humans. the goal of the study was the evaluation of quality expressed by identity, colony forming unit (cfu) and antibiotic sensitivity ofprobiotics used in medicinal products available in poland using the appropriate and validated procedures. methods: the medicinal products containing l. rhamnosus, l. acidophilus, l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and b. animalis subsp. lactis, l. helveticus, and l. gasseri were tested for species identity performed with validated rep-pcr (boxa 1r) method. the antimicrobial susceptibility of working seeds and strains isolated to 26 antibiotics were tested by disk diffusion and e-test methods using relevant references as recommended by eucast. the numbers of probiotic strains, expressed as cfu count per package, was done using plating plunge method. results: all strains tested, except b. lactis, were found to be resistant to trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole, nalidixic acid, metronidazole, and colistin. b. lactis was resistant to aminoglycosides. l. rhamnosus strains were found to be resistant to vancomycin, (mic > 256 microg/ml) similarly to atcc strains (l. rhamnosus gg 53103 and 244). the sensitivity to other antibiotics was strain specific. the rep-pcr method was found species and strain specific. all products  tested fulfilled declared countent as measured by cfu count/package. conclusions: quality of medicinal products containing probiotics was found undoubted and confirmed. the optimized strategy of quality monitoring of probiotics used in medicinal products can be used in dietary supplements and foodstuffs intended for particular nutritional uses.

TI  == development of a tiered multilocus sequence typing scheme for members of the lactobacillus acidophilus complex.
AB  == members of the lactobacillus acidophilus complex are associated with functional foods and dietary supplements because of purported health benefits they impart to the consumer. many characteristics of these microorganisms are reported to be strain specific. therefore, proper strain typing is essential for safety assessment and product labeling, and also for monitoring strain integrity for industrial production purposes. fifty-two strains of the l. acidophilus complex (l. acidophilus, l. amylovorus, l. crispatus, l. gallinarum, l. gasseri, and l. johnsonii) were genotyped using two established methods and compared to a novel multilocus sequence typing (mlst) scheme. pcr restriction fragment length polymorphism (pcr-rflp) analysis of the hsp60 gene with alui and taqi successfully clustered 51 of the 52 strains into the six species examined, but it lacked strain-level discrimination. random amplified polymorphic dna pcr (rapd-pcr) targeting the m13 sequence resulted in highly discriminatory profiles  but lacked reproducibility. in this study, an mlst scheme was developed using the conserved housekeeping genes fusa, gpma, gyra, gyrb, lepa, pyrg, and reca, which  identified 40 sequence types that successfully clustered all of the strains into  the six species. analysis of the observed alleles suggests that nucleotide substitutions within five of the seven mlst loci have reached saturation, a finding that emphasizes the highly diverse nature of the l. acidophilus complex and our unconventional application of a typically intraspecies molecular typing tool. our mlst results indicate that this method could be useful for characterization and strain discrimination of a multispecies complex, with the potential for taxonomic expansion to a broader collection of lactobacillus species.

TI  == differences in vaginal lactobacilli composition of iranian healthy and bacterial  vaginosis infected women: a comparative analysis of their cytotoxic effects with  commercial vaginal probiotics.
AB  == background: vaginal flora of healthy women is dominated by lactobacillus species  which can prevent bacterial vaginosis. objectives: the current study aimed to determine the differences in vaginal lactobacilli composition of iranian healthy  and bacterial vaginosis (bv) infected women and compared their cytotoxic effects  with commercial vaginal probiotics. patients and methods: one hundred and seventy eight vaginal specimens were collected from healthy and bv infected women. lactobacillus colonies were obtained by culturing on laked blood bhi and mrs medias and genetically defined by 16s rrna sequencing. differentiating the specimens to normal, intermediate and bv infected were carried out by ison and hey grading protocol. identification of lactobacillus strains in vaginal specimens were performed by multiplex pcr. the inhibitory effects of lactobacilli on hela (tumoral cervical cells) and hncf-pi52 (normal cervical cells) were conducted by mtt and trypan blue assays. results: l. crispatus, l. gasseri, l. iners, l. jensenii, l. acidophilus and l. rhamnosus were the most frequently occurring species in vagina of healthy iranian women. l. crispatus and l. jensenni were significantly higher in the normal than in the bv infected groups.  also the cytotoxic effect of l. crispatus on tumoral cervical cells was higher than other lactobacilli including commercial probiotics. conclusions: as l. crispatus and l. jensenni were significantly higher in bv infected women and the  cytotoxic effect of l. crispatus on tumoral cervical cells was high, introduction of new probiotics seems necessary.

TI  == [illumina sequencing 16s rrna tagging reveals diverse vaginal microbiomes associated with bacterial vaginosis].
AB  == objective: to analyze and compare vaginal microbiomes in healthy women at child-bearing ages and patients with bacterial vaginosis (bv). methods: a total of 74 vaginal swabs of the vaginal fornix were collected from 37 bv patients and  37 healthy women. bv status was assessed according to amsels clinical criteria for all the subjects and confirmed using gram-stain criteria (nugent scores). genomic dna of the samples was extracted for amplifying the 16s rrna v6 hypervariable region by pcr and pyrosequencing by illumina. bipes, uchime, tsc and gast were employed to analyze the information of the species from the samples. results: lactobacillus was the predominant species in healthy women (more than 95%), including mainly l. iners and l. crispatus, with a small quantity of gardnerella, granulicatella, streptococcus, prevotella, escherichia and other genus. the alpha diversity was significantly increased in 30 bv patients (p<0.001), and beta diversity also changed obviously shown by decreased  lactobacillus (varying from 45% to 1%, consisting mainly of l. iners) or even absence lactobacillus in 6 cases, with increased relative abundance of gardnerella, prevotella, granulicatella, anaerococcus, parvimonas, peptoniphilus.harei, peptostreptococcus, and dialister. different from previous data, 7 bv cases showed a predominance of the rare species l.gasseri and l.acidophilus (75% to 50%). conclusion: lactobacillus is the predominant vaginal  species in healthy women (mainly l. iners and l. crispatus) co-existing with many other bacteria and a variety of microorganisms. lactobacillus is significantly decreased and even absent in most of bv patients, and some cases show the predominance of the rare species l.gasseri and l.acidophilus.

TI  == lactobacillus species isolated from vaginal secretions of healthy and bacterial vaginosis-intermediate mexican women: a prospective study.
AB  == background: lactobacillus jensenii, l. iners, l. crispatus and l. gasseri are the most frequently occurring lactobacilli in the vagina. however, the native species vary widely according to the studied population. the present study was performed  to genetically determine the identity of lactobacillus strains present in the vaginal discharge of healthy and bacterial vaginosis (bv) intermediate mexican women. methods: in a prospective study, 31 strains preliminarily identified as lactobacillus species were isolated from 21 samples collected from 105 non-pregnant mexican women. the samples were classified into groups according to  the nugent score criteria proposed for detection of bv: normal (n), intermediate  (i) and bacterial vaginosis (bv). we examined the isolates using culture-based methods as well as molecular analysis of the v1-v3 regions of the 16s rrna gene.  enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (eric) sequence analysis was performed to reject clones. results: clinical isolates (25/31) were classified into four groups based on sequencing and analysis of the 16s rrna gene: l. acidophilus (14/25), l. reuteri (6/25), l. casei (4/25) and l. buchneri (1/25). the remaining six isolates were presumptively identified as enterococcus species. within the l. acidophilus group, l. gasseri was the most frequently isolated species, followed by l. jensenii and l. crispatus. l. fermentum, l. rhamnosus and l. brevis were also isolated, and were placed in the l. reuteri, l. casei and l.  buchneri groups, respectively. eric profile analysis showed intraspecific variability amongst the l. gasseri and l. fermentum species. conclusions: these findings agree with previous studies showing that l. crispatus, l. gasseri and l. jensenii are consistently present in the healthy vaginal ecosystem. additional species or phylotypes were detected in the vaginal microbiota of the non-pregnant mexican (hispanic-mestizo) population, and thus, these results further our understanding of vaginal lactobacilli colonisation and richness in this particular population.

TI  == detection and quantification of probiotic strain lactobacillus gasseri k7 in faecal samples by targeting bacteriocin genes.
AB  == lactobacillus gasseri k7 is a probiotic strain that produces bacteriocins gassericin k7 a and k7 b. in order to develop a real-time quantitative pcr assay  for the detection of l. gasseri k7, 18 reference strains of the lactobacillus acidophilus group and 45 faecal samples of adults who have never consumed strain  k7 were tested with pcr using 14 pairs of primers specific for gassericin k7 a and k7 b gene determinants. incomplete gassericin k7 a or k7 b gene clusters were found to be dispersed in different lactobacilli strains as well as in faecal microbiota. one pair of primers was found to be specific for the total gene cluster of gassericin k7a and one for gassericin k7b. the real-time pcr analysis  of faecal samples spiked with k7 strain revealed that primers specific for the gene cluster of the gassericin k7 a were more suitable for quantitative determination than those for gassericin k7 b, due to the lower detection level. targeting of the gassericin k7 a or k7 b gene cluster with specific primers could be used for detection and quantification of l. gasseri k7 in human faecal samples without prior cultivation. the results of this study also present new insights into the prevalence of bacteriocin-encoding genes in gastrointestinal tract.

TI  == genomic and phenotypic evidence for probiotic influences of lactobacillus gasseri on human health.
AB  == certain lactic acid bacteria (lab) have the capacity to occupy mucosal niches of  humans, including the oral cavity, gastrointestinal tract, and vagina. among commensal, lab are species of the acidophilus complex, which have proven to be a  substantial reservoir for microorganisms with probiotic attributes. specifically, lactobacillus gasseri is an autochthonous microorganism which has been evaluated  for probiotic activity based on the availability of genome sequence and species-specific adaptation to the human mucosa. niche-related characteristics of l. gasseri contributing to indigenous colonization include tolerance of low ph environments, resistance to bile salts, and adhesion to the host epithelium. in humans, l. gasseri elicits various health benefits through its antimicrobial activity, bacteriocin production, and immunomodulation of the innate and adaptive systems. the genomic and empirical evidence supporting use of l. gasseri in probiotic applications is substantiated by clinical trial data displaying maintenance of vaginal homeostasis, mitigation of helicobacter pylori infection,  and amelioration of diarrhea.

TI  == differences in tlr9-dependent inhibitory effects of h(2)o(2)-induced il-8 secretion and nf-kappa b/i kappa b-alpha system activation by genomic dna from five lactobacillus species.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) show anti-inflammatory effects, and their genomic dna  was identified as one of the anti-inflammatory components. despite the differences in anti-inflammatory effects between live lab dependent not only on genus but also species, this effect has not been compared at the genomic dna level. we compared the anti-inflammatory effects of the genomic dna from five lactobacillus species-lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus plantarum, and lactobacillus reuteri-using caco-2 cells. to evaluate anti-inflammatory effects, decreases in h(2)o(2)-induced il-8 secretion and inhibition of h(2)o(2)-induced nf-kappab/ikappab-alpha system activation were examined. all lab genomic dnas dose-dependently decreased h(2)o(2)-induced il-8 secretion and inhibited h(2)o(2)-induced nf-kappab/ikappab-alpha system activation. comparison of these effects between lactobacillus species showed that the anti-inflammatory effects of l. acidophilus genomic dna are lower than those of the other species. furthermore, suppression of toll-like receptor 9 (tlr9), a specific receptor of bacterial dna, expression by rnai abolished the decrease of h(2)o(2)-induced il-8 secretion and inhibition of h(2)o(2)-induced nf-kappab/ikappab-alpha system activation by lab genomic dna. our results demonstrated that the anti-inflammatory effects of genomic dna differ between lactobacillus species and tlr9 is one of the major pathways responsible for the anti-inflammatory effect of lab genomic dna.

TI  == effect of supplementation of probiotics and phytosterols alone or in combination  on serum and hepatic lipid profiles and thyroid hormones of hypercholesterolemic  rats.
AB  == probiotic bacteria and phytosterols are natural hypocholesterolemic agents with potential cardiovascular benefits. accordingly, the present study was conducted to evaluate the effect of supplementation of probiotics and phytosterols alone or in combination on serum and hepatic lipid profiles and thyroid hormones of hypercholesterolemic rats. mixed probiotics treatment consisted of 8 probiotic strains: 2 strains of each of lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus gasseri, and lactobacillus reuteri. the rats were fed for 8 wk with the given treatments in addition to a high-fat-high-cholesterol basal diet to induce hypercholesterolemia. results showed that supplementation significantly reduced serum total cholesterol, low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (ldl-c), high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides compared with the controls. the symbiotic treatment was more effective in lowering ldl-c, whereas mixed probiotics treatment more effectively lowered serum total cholesterol and ldl-c than the phytosterol-containing treatment. the phytosterol-containing treatments induced the increased activity of thyroid glands, as evident by elevated levels of serum total thyroxine, total triiodothyronine, and free triiodothyronine. in conclusion, the lipid profile can effectively be reduced to  lower the incidence of cardiovascular disease using combinations of lactobacillus-based probiotics and phytosterols in functional foods.

TI  == isolation and characterization of bacteriocin-producing bacteria from the intestinal microbiota of elderly irish subjects.
AB  == aims: to isolate and characterize bacteriocins produced by predominant species of lactic acid bacteria from faeces of elderly subjects. methods and results: screening over 70,000 colonies, from faecal samples collected from 266 subjects,  using the indicator organisms lactobacillus bulgaricus lmg 6901 and listeria innocua dpc 3572, identified 55 antimicrobial-producing bacteria. genomic fingerprinting following apai digestion revealed 15 distinct strains. the antimicrobial activities associated with 13 of the 15 strains were sensitive to protease treatment. the predominant antimicrobial-producing species were identified as lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus crispatus and enterococcus spp. a number of previously characterized bacteriocins, including abp-118 and salivaricin b (from lact. salivarius), enterocin b (enterococcus faecium), lactacin b (lact. acidophilus),  gassericin t and a variant of gassericin a (lact. gasseri), were identified. interestingly, two antimicrobial-producing species, not generally associated with intestinally derived microorganisms were also isolated: lactococcus lactis producing nisin z and streptococcus mutans producing mutacin ii. conclusion: these data suggest that bacteriocin production by intestinal isolates against our chosen targets under the screening conditions used was not frequent (0.08%). significance and impact of the study: the results presented are important due to  growing evidence indicating bacteriocin production as a potential probiotic trait by virtue of strain dominance and/or pathogen inhibition in the mammalian intestine.

TI  == evaluation of lactobacillus strains for selected probiotic properties.
AB  == eleven strains of lactobacillus collected in the culture collection of dairy microorganisms (ccdm) were evaluated for selected probiotic properties such as survival in gastrointestinal fluids, antimicrobial activity, and competition with non-toxigenic escherichia coli o157:h7 for adhesion on caco-2 cells. the viable count of lactobacilli was reduced during 3-h incubation in gastric fluid followed by 3-h incubation in intestinal fluid. all strains showed antimicrobial activity  and the three most effective strains inhibited the growth of at least 16 indicator strains. antimicrobial metabolites of seven strains active against lactobacillus and clostridium indicator strains were found to be sensitive to proteinase k and trypsin, which indicates their proteinaceous nature. the degree  of competitive inhibition of non-toxigenic e. coli o157:h7 adhesion on the surface of caco-2 cells was strain-dependent. a significant decrease (p < 0.05) in the number of non-toxigenic e. coli o157:h7 adhering to caco-2 cells was observed with all lactobacilli. three strains were selected for additional studies of antimicrobial activity, i.e., lactobacillus gasseri ccdm 215, lactobacillus acidophilus ccdm 149, and lactobacillus helveticus ccdm 82.

TI  == restoring specific lactobacilli levels decreases inflammation and muscle atrophy  markers in an acute leukemia mouse model.
AB  == the gut microbiota has recently been proposed as a novel component in the regulation of host homeostasis and immunity. we have assessed for the first time  the role of the gut microbiota in a mouse model of leukemia (transplantation of baf3 cells containing ectopic expression of bcr-abl), characterized at the final  stage by a loss of fat mass, muscle atrophy, anorexia and inflammation. the gut microbial 16s rdna analysis, using pcr-denaturating gradient gel electrophoresis  and quantitative pcr, reveals a dysbiosis and a selective modulation of lactobacillus spp. (decrease of l. reuteri and l. johnsonii/gasseri in favor of l. murinus/animalis) in the baf3 mice compared to the controls. the restoration of lactobacillus species by oral supplementation with l. reuteri 100-23 and l. gasseri 311476 reduced the expression of atrophy markers (atrogin-1, murf1, lc3,  cathepsin l) in the gastrocnemius and in the tibialis, a phenomenon correlated with a decrease of inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-6, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, interleukin-4, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor,  quantified by multiplex immuno-assay). these positive effects are strain- and/or  species-specific since l. acidophilus ncfm supplementation does not impact on muscle atrophy markers and systemic inflammation. altogether, these results suggest that the gut microbiota could constitute a novel therapeutic target in the management of leukemia-associated inflammation and related disorders in the muscle.

TI  == comparative meta-analysis of the effect of lactobacillus species on weight gain in humans and animals.
AB  == background: obesity is associated with alteration of the gut microbiota. in order to clarify the effect of lactobacillus-containing probiotics (lcp) on weight we performed a meta-analysis of clinical studies and experimental models. we intended to assess effects by lactobacillus species. methods: a broad search with no date or language restriction was performed. we included randomized controlled  trials (rcts) and comparative clinical studies in humans and animals or experimental models assessing the effect of lactobacillus-containing probiotics on weight. we primarily attempted to extract and use change from baseline values. data were extracted independently by two authors. results were pooled by host and by lactobacillus species and are summarized in a meta-analysis of standardized difference in means (smds). results: we identified and included 17 rcts in humans, 51 studies on farm animals and 14 experimental models. lactobacillus acidophilus administration resulted in significant weight gain in humans and in animals (smd 0.15; 95% confidence intervals 0.05-0.25). results were consistent in humans and animals. lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus ingluviei were associated with weight gain in animals. lactobacillus plantarum was associated with weight loss in animals and lactobacillus gasseri was associated with weight  loss both in obese humans and in animals. conclusions: different lactobacillus species are associated different effects on weight change that are host-specific. further studies are needed to clarify the role of lactobacillus species in the human energy harvest and weight regulation. attention should be drawn to the potential effects of commonly marketed lactobacillus-containing probiotics on weight gain.

TI  == qualitative and semiquantitative analysis of lactobacillus species in the vaginas of healthy fertile and postmenopausal chinese women.
AB  == the present study aimed to investigate the prevalence and quantity of lactobacillus species in the vaginas of healthy chinese women. vaginal samples from 92 fertile and 22 postmenopausal healthy chinese women were analysed using a 16s rrna gene clone library and species-specific pcr followed by sequencing and real-time pcr. a total of 13 different lactobacillus species were detected. species-specific pcr showed that 3% of the fertile women were colonized by one species of lactobacillus and 97% were colonized by two or more species. among the postmenopausal women, 91% were colonized by one species of lactobacillus and 9% were colonized by two species. in the fertile women, l. iners (82.61%), l. crispatus (70.65%) and l. gasseri (67.39%) were more prevalent than l. jensenii (40.22%), l. acidophilus (39.13%), l. brevis (23.91%), l. plantarum (5.43%), l. johnsonii (3.26%), l. fermentum (2.17%), l. salivarius (2.17%), l. rhamnosus (1.09%), l. reuteri (1.09%) and l. paracasei (1.09%); l. delbrueckii was not detected. in the postmenopausal women, l. fermentum, l. rhamnosus, l. reuteri and l. delbrueckii were not detected, and the other 10 species were detected in just  a few samples. the prevalence of these species according to the clone library differed from the prevalence indicated by the species-specific pcr. according to  the semiquantitative analysis, the total lactobacillus dna concentrations were higher in fertile women than in postmenopausal women. sixty-one per cent of the fertile women were predominantly colonized by l. iners, 35% by l. crispatus, and  2% by l. gasseri. associations between pairs of lactobacillus species in fertile  women were significant (p<0.05) between the following pairs: l. iners and l. gasseri, l. iners and l. jensenii, l. iners and l. acidophilus, l. gasseri and l. acidophilus, and l. gasseri and l. jensenii. in conclusion, this study provided detailed information on lactobacillus species colonizing the vaginas of healthy chinese fertile and postmenopausal women. the study also showed that the diversity of lactobacillus species in fertile women was higher than in postmenopausal women. according to our study, different techniques, such as species-specific pcr and comparison against a 16s rrna gene clone library, resulted in different findings regarding species prevalence. these findings highlight the importance of standardization of techniques used for evaluation of  bacterial communities. according to our findings regarding species associations,  l. iners and l. gasseri may have influences on colonization and proliferation of  other vaginal lactobacillus species.

TI  == effect of antioxidant activity and functional properties of chingshey purple sweet potato fermented milk by lactobacillus acidophilus, l. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, and l. gasseri strains.
AB  == in this study, individual selected lactic acid bacteria strains lactobacillus acidophilus (la), l. delbrueckii subsp. lactis (ldl), and l. gasseri (lga) were grown in chingshey purple sweet potato (cpsp) substrate/media. cpsp is rich in anthocyanin, which possesses antioxidant activity and in vitro cell assay. the antioxidant ability and functional properties of the fermented milk were examined. high-performance liquid chromatographic (hplc) method was used to analyze the free amino acid, organic acids, and anthocyanin content. total phenolic compounds, scavenging effects of 1,1-diphenyl-2-picyl-hydrazyl (dpph) radicals, and scavenging effects of superoxide anion radicals were determined to  evaluate the antioxidant ability of the samples. the cell proliferation of the fermented psp milk was evaluated by 3-(4,5-dimethyldiazol-2-yl)-2,5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (mtt) assay. the result indicated that the antioxidant ability of the fermented cpsp milk through la, ldl, and lga strains was significantly higher than cpsp. the main anthocyanins present in the samples are  cyanidin and delphinidin. mtt assay has revealed that incubation with both psp and fermented cpsp milk prevented the cell death of macrophage-like raw264.7 cells. the potential health benefit of fermented psp milk through la, ldl, and lga strains makes the further application of cpsp in health food highly worthwhile. practical application: (1) in our study, we have employed the gamma-aminobutyric acid (gaba), organic acid contents, total phenol content, anthocyanins content, dpph, oxygen radical absorbance capacity, superoxide dismutase activity assay, and cytotoxicity assay to assess the functional properties of fermented cpsp milk by different lactic acid bacteria. (2) our results have revealed that the fermented cpsp milk samples possess high gaba concentrations, organic acid contents, anthocyanins contents, and antioxidant activity. this will provide potential opportunity to develop different functional food products from fermented cpsp milk. (3) the potential health benefit of fermented cpsp milk makes the further application of cpsp in health food highly worthwhile.

TI  == differential targeting of the e-cadherin/beta-catenin complex by gram-positive probiotic lactobacilli improves epithelial barrier function.
AB  == the intestinal ecosystem is balanced by dynamic interactions between resident and incoming microbes, the gastrointestinal barrier, and the mucosal immune system. however, in the context of inflammatory bowel diseases (ibd), where the integrity of the gastrointestinal barrier is compromised, resident microbes contribute to the development and perpetuation of inflammation and disease. probiotic bacteria  have been shown to exert beneficial effects, e.g., enhancing epithelial barrier integrity. however, the mechanisms underlying these beneficial effects are only poorly understood. here, we comparatively investigated the effects of four probiotic lactobacilli, namely, lactobacillus acidophilus, l. fermentum, l. gasseri, and l. rhamnosus, in a t84 cell epithelial barrier model. results of dna microarray experiments indicating that lactobacilli modulate the regulation of genes encoding in particular adherence junction proteins such as e-cadherin and beta-catenin were confirmed by quantitative reverse transcription-pcr (qrt-pcr).  furthermore, we show that epithelial barrier function is modulated by gram-positive probiotic lactobacilli via their effect on adherence junction protein expression and complex formation. in addition, incubation with lactobacilli differentially influences the phosphorylation of adherence junction  proteins and the abundance of protein kinase c (pkc) isoforms such as pkcdelta that thereby positively modulates epithelial barrier function. further insight into the underlying molecular mechanisms triggered by these probiotics might also foster the development of novel strategies for the treatment of gastrointestinal  diseases (e.g., ibd).

TI  == lactobacilli and bifidobacteria induce differential interferon-beta profiles in dendritic cells.
AB  == the health promoting effects of probiotics are well-documented; however, current  knowledge on immunostimulatory effects is based on data from a single strain or a limited selection of strains or species. here, we compared the capacity of 27 lactobacilli and 16 bifidobacteria strains to stimulate bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (dc). most lactobacilli strains, including lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus plantarum, induced strong il-12 and tnf-alpha production and up-regulation of maturation markers. in contrast, all bifidobacteria and certain lactobacilli strains were low il-12 and tnf-alpha inducers. il-10 and il-6 levels showed less  variation and no correlation with il-12 and tnf-alpha. dc matured by strong il-12-inducing strains also produced high levels of interferon (ifn)-beta. when combining two strains, low il-12 inducers inhibited this ifn-beta production as well as il-12 and th1-skewing chemokines. the ifn-beta induction was mediated through c-jun n-terminal kinase (jnk) irrespective of the stimulating strain. the inhibitory bacteria induced higher levels of the transcription factor c-jun dimerization protein (jdp)-2, thereby counteracting the effect of jnk. our data demonstrate that lactobacilli can be divided into two groups of bacteria featuring contrasting effects, while all bifidobacteria exhibit uniform effects.  this underlines the importance of selecting the proper strain(s) for probiotic purposes.

AB  == the aim of the study was to evaluate the safety and persistence of selected lactobacillus strains in the gastrointestinal tract (git) of healthy adult volunteers after oral consumption of high doses of lactobacilli to identify potential candidates for probiotic and biotechnological applications. in the first phase of the study, nine individuals consumed capsules containing lactobacillus gasseri 177 and e16b7, lactobacillus acidophilus 821-3, lactobacillus paracasei 317 and lactobacillus fermentum 338-1-1 (each daily dose  1x1010 cfu) for 5 consecutive days. data on gut health, blood parameters, and liver and kidney function were collected. the persistence of lactobacillus strains was assessed by culturing combined with arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction (ap-pcr) and pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge) on days 0, 5, 8, 10 and 20 from faecal samples. all strains survived gastrointestinal passage and were detected on the 5th day. l. acidophilus 821-3 was detected in four volunteers on the 8th day (4.3 to 7.0 log10 cfu/g) and in two on the 10th day (8.3 and 3.9 log10 cfu/g, respectively). in the second phase  of the study, five additional volunteers consumed l. acidophilus 821-3 (daily 1x1010 cfu) for 5 consecutive days. the strain was subsequently detected in faeces of all individuals using real-time pcr on the 10th day (range 4.6-6.7; median 6.0 log10 cell/g) in both phases of the study for at least 5 days after discontinuation of consumption. the administration of high doses of different lactobacillus strains did not result in any severe adverse effects in git and/or  abnormal values of blood indices. thus, the strain l. acidophilus 821-3 is a promising candidate for probiotic and biotechnological applications. further studies will be performed to confirm the strain persistence and safety in a larger number of individuals.

AB  == this study aimed at utilizing ultrasound treatment to further enhance the growth  of lactobacilli and their isoflavone bioconversion activities in biotin-supplemented soymilk. strains of lactobacilli (lactobacillus acidophilus bt 1088, l. fermentum bt 8219, l. acidophilus ftdc 8633, l. gasseri ftdc 8131) were treated with ultrasound (30 khz, 100 w) at different amplitudes (20%, 60% and 100%) for 60, 120 and 180 s prior to inoculation and fermentation in biotin-soymilk. the treatment affected the fatty acids chain of the cellular membrane lipid bilayer, as shown by an increased lipid peroxidation (p<0.05). this led to increased membrane fluidity and subsequently, membrane permeability (p<0.05). the permeabilized cellular membranes had facilitated nutrient internalization and subsequent growth enhancement (p<0.05). higher amplitudes and longer durations of the treatment promoted growth of lactobacilli in soymilk, with viable counts exceeding 9 log cfu/ml. the intracellular and extracellular beta-glucosidase specific activities of lactobacilli were also enhanced (p<0.05)  upon ultrasound treatment, leading to increased bioconversion of isoflavones in soymilk, particularly genistin and malonyl genistin to genistein. results from this study show that ultrasound treatment on lactobacilli cells promotes (p<0.05) the beta-glucosidase activity of cells for the benefit of enhanced (p<0.05) isoflavone glucosides bioconversion to bioactive aglycones in soymilk.

AB  == a group of lactobacilli isolated from the cervix of 31 healthy women was characterized by (gtg)(5)-polymerase chain reaction (pcr) fingerprinting in order to evaluate this method for identification of vaginal lactobacilli. obtained fingerprints were compared with profiles available in an in-house database of the ccm bacteria collection covering type and reference strains of multiple lactic acid bacteria including lactobacilli. selected strains representing individual clusters were further identified by phes gene sequencing. in total, six lactobacillus species were found among lactobacilli isolated from the cervix of healthy women. the (gtg)(5)-pcr method identified lactobacillus gasseri (11 strains), lactobacillus fermentum (one), and some of the lactobacillus jensenii strains (eight out of 11), but failed to identify the remaining strains, including the lactobacillus crispatus (18), lactobacillus mucosae (one), and lactobacillus vaginalis (one) species. l. jensenii strains were distributed over  two fingerprint clusters. the majority of samples was dominated by one (gtg)(5)-pcr type. the rep-pcr fingerprinting using the (gtg)(5) primer allowed straightforward identification of many, but not all, isolates. this method has been shown to be a useful tool for fast screening and grouping of vaginal lactobacilli, but its combination with another identification method is needed to obtain reliable identification results. in addition, lactobacillus acidophilus was not shown to be the most common inhabitant of the female genital tract as generally assumed.

TI  == construction of vectors for inducible and constitutive gene expression in lactobacillus.
AB  == microarray analysis of the genome of lactobacillus acidophilus identified a number of operons that were differentially expressed in response to carbohydrate  source or constitutively expressed regardless of carbohydrate source. these included operons implicated in the transport and catabolism of fructooligosaccharides (fos), lactose (lac), trehalose (tre) and genes directing  glycolysis. analysis of these operons identified a number of putative promoter and repressor elements, which were used to construct a series of expression vectors for use in lactobacilli, based on the broad host range pwv01 replicon. a  beta-glucuronidase (gusa3) reporter gene was cloned into each vector to characterize expression from each promoter. gus reporter assays showed fos, lac and tre based vectors to be highly inducible by their specific carbohydrate and repressed by glucose. additionally, a construct based on the phosphoglycerate mutase (pgm) promoter was constitutively highly expressed. to demonstrate the potential utility of these vectors, we constructed a plasmid for the overexpression of the oxalate degradation pathway (frc and oxc) of l. acidophilus ncfm. this construct was able to improve oxalate degradation by l. gasseri atcc 33323 and compliment a l. acidophilus oxalate-deficient mutant. development of these expression vectors could support several novel applications, including the  expression of enzymes, proteins, vaccines and biotherapeutics by intestinal lactobacilli.

TI  == phylogenomic reconstruction of lactic acid bacteria: an update.
AB  == background: lactic acid bacteria (lab) are important in the food industry for the production of fermented food products and in human health as commensals in the gut. however, the phylogenetic relationships among lab species remain under intensive debate owing to disagreements among different data sets. results: we performed a phylogenetic analysis of lab species based on 232 genes from 28 lab genome sequences. regardless of the tree-building methods used, combined analyses yielded an identical, well-resolved tree topology with strong supports for all nodes. the lab species examined were divided into two groups. group 1 included families enterococcaceae and streptococcaceae. group 2 included families lactobacillaceae and leuconostocaceae. within group 2, the lab species were divided into two clades. one clade comprised of the acidophilus complex of genus  lactobacillus and two other species, lb. sakei and lb. casei. in the acidophilus  complex, lb. delbrueckii separated first, while lb. acidophilus/lb. helveticus and lb. gasseri/lb. johnsonii were clustered into a sister group. the other clade within group 2 consisted of the salivarius subgroup, including five species, lb.  salivarius, lb. plantarum, lb. brevis, lb. reuteri, lb. fermentum, and the genera pediococcus, oenococcus, and leuconostoc. in this clade, lb. salivarius was positioned most basally, followed by two clusters, one corresponding to lb. plantarum/lb. brevis pair and pediococcus, and the other including oenococcus/leuconostoc pair and lb. reuteri/lb. fermentum pair. in addition, phylogenetic utility of the 232 genes was analyzed to identify those that may be  more useful than others. the genes identified as useful were related to translation and ribosomal structure and biogenesis (trsb), and a three-gene set comprising genes encoding ultra-violet resistance protein b (uvrb), dna polymerase iii (polc) and penicillin binding protein 2b (pbpb). conclusions: our  phylogenomic analyses provide important insights into the evolution and diversification of lab species, and also revealed the phylogenetic utility of several genes. we infer that the occurrence of multiple, independent adaptation events in lab species, have resulted in their occupation of various habitats. further analyses of more genes from additional, representative lab species are needed to reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying adaptation of lab species to various environmental niches.

AB  == identification of lactobacillus sp. strains by phenotypic methods may lead to doubtful results possibly interfering in the reliability of the epidemiological and probiotics studies. therefore this study aimed to determine the best methodology for the identification of the large diversity of lactobacilli species found in the vagina by comparing two techniques, one based on their biochemical profile and other employing molecular biology. a carbohydrate fermentation test (api 50 ch) was compared with multiplex polymerase chain reaction (pcr) for the identification of species of vaginal lactobacilli from 135 healthy women. the kappa index was used to evaluate agreement between the methods. using the molecular technique, l. crispatus (32.6%), l. jensenii (25%) and l. gasseri (20.6%) were the most frequent species. however, using the biochemical technique, the most frequent species were: l. acidophilus (34.8%), l. crispatus (27.2%) and  l. fermentum (13%). although l. acidophilus was the most frequent specie found by biochemical tests, no strain of this microorganism was detected by pcr. agreement between the methods was low for identification of all the most common species. although rates of l. crispatus detected were similar using both methods (32.6% and 27.2%), agreement between them was relatively low (kappa = 0.52). conclusions: our results confirmed the limitation of the biochemical method and the applicability of a previously published molecular method (multiplex pcr) for  the identification of lactobacilli in the vaginal tract, focusing on further necessity of its improvement for also targeting l. vaginalis and l. iners.

TI  == induction of protective immunity against microbial challenge by targeting antigens expressed by probiotic bacteria to mucosal dendritic cells.
AB  == efficient vaccines combined with adjuvants potentiate and enhance antibody avidity and increase t cell longevity, particularly in individuals with compromised immunity. the efficacy of a novel vaccine can be improved by specifically targeting its immunogenic subunits and expressing it in live probiotic vector (i.e. lactobacillus acidophilus) that protects vaccine bioavailability and to induces not only mucosal but also systemic immunity against microbes. accordingly, our data clearly show that specific lactobacillus  species (l. gasseri) not only optimally activate dcs but also deliver targeted antigens to mucosal dcs via 12-mer peptides derived from a phage display library  resulting in robust humoral and t cell immunity against microbial challenge. this effort is accomplished via novel tools that provide "targeting" of the vaccine, evaluation of innovative vaccine effectiveness against a wide array of microbes,  and controlling gene expression/presentation technologies in probiotic lactobacilli that can be orally consumed at high levels resulting in natural delivery of a "targeted" antigen to mucosal dcs. in this review i will discuss the potential benefits and efficacy of the employed vaccine strategy that may be  feasible for various studies in the field.

AB  == background: although probiotic bacteria and their metabolites alter enterocyte gene expression, rapid, non-genomic responses have not been examined. the present study measured accumulation of tracer (2 microm) glucose by caco-2 cells after exposure for 10 min or less to a chemically defined medium (cdm) with different monosaccharides before and after anaerobic culture of probiotic lactobacilli. results: growth of l. acidophilus was supported by cdm with 110 mm glucose, fructose, and mannose, but not with arabinose, ribose, and xylose or the sugar-free cdm. glucose accumulation was reduced when caco-2 cells were exposed for 10 min to sterile cdm with glucose (by 92%), mannose (by 90%), fructose (by 55%), and ribose (by 16%), but not with arabinose and xylose. exposure of caco-2  cells for 10 min to bacteria-free supernatants prepared after exponential (48 h)  and stationary (72 h) growth phases of l. acidophilus cultured in cdm with 110 mm fructose increased glucose accumulation by 83% and 45%, respectively; exposure to a suspension of the bacteria had no effect. the increase in glucose accumulation  was diminished by heat-denaturing the supernatant, indicating the response of caco-2 cells is triggered by as yet unknown heat labile bacterial metabolites, not by a reduction in cdm components that decrease glucose uptake. supernatants prepared after anaerobic culture of l. gasseri, l. amylovorus, l. gallinarum, and l. johnsonii in the cdm with fructose increased glucose accumulation by 83%, 32%, 27%, and 14%, respectively. conclusion: the rapid, non-genomic upregulation of sglt1 by bacterial metabolites is a heretofore unrecognized interaction between probiotics and the intestinal epithelium.

TI  == vaginal lactobacilli as potential probiotics against candida spp.
AB  == urogenital infections affect millions of people every year worldwide. the treatment of these diseases usually requires the use of antimicrobial agents, and more recently, the use of probiotic lactic acid bacteria (lab) cultures for the management of vaginal infections has been extensively studied. in this work, 11 vaginal lactobacilli isolates, previously obtained from healthy patients, were studied to screen microorganisms with probiotic properties against candida spp. the lab were tested for their ability of auto-aggregation, co-aggregation with c. albicans, c. glabrata, c. krusei, and c. tropicalis, adhesion to caco-2 epithelial cells and production of lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide (h2o2). all  lactobacilli isolates tested were able to auto-aggregate (ranging from 25.3% to 75.4% assessed at 4 hours of incubation) and to co-aggregate with the four candida species into different degrees; among them l. crispatus showed the highest scores of co-aggregation. the highest amount of lactic acid was produced  by l. salivarius (13.9 g/l), followed by l. johnsonii (6.5 g/l), l. acidophilus (5.5 g/l), and l. jensenii (5.4 g/l). all isolates produced h2o2, but the highest levels (3 - 10 mg/l) were observed for l. acidophilus, l. crispatus, l. gasseri,  l. johnsonii, and l. vaginalis. only l. agilis, l. jensenii, l. johnsonii and l.  ruminus were able to adhere to epithelial caco-2 cells. among the isolates evaluated, l agilis, l. jensenii, l. johnsonii, and l. ruminus exhibited simultaneously several desirable properties as potential probiotic strains justifying future studies to evaluate their technological properties in different pharmaceutical preparations for human use.

TI  == viability and growth characteristics of lactobacillus in soymilk supplemented with b-vitamins.
AB  == ten strains of lactobacillus were evaluated for their viability in soymilk. lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 314, l. acidophilus ftdc 8833, l. acidophilus ftdc 8633 and l. gasseri ftdc 8131 displayed higher viability in soymilk and were thus selected to be evaluated for viability and growth characteristics in soymilk supplemented with b-vitamins. pour plate analyses showed that the supplementation of all b-vitamins studied promoted the growth of lactobacilli to a viable count exceeding 7 log cfu/ml. alpha-galactosidase specific activity of lactobacilli as  determined spectrophotometrically showed an increase upon supplementation of b-vitamins. high-performance liquid chromatography analyses revealed that this led to increased hydrolysis of soy oligosaccharides and subsequently higher utilization of simple sugars. production of organic acids as determined via high-performance liquid chromatography also showed an increase, accompanied by a  decrease in ph of soymilk. additionally, the supplementation of b-vitamins also promoted the synthesis of riboflavin and folic acid by lactobacilli in soymilk. our results indicated that b-vitamin-supplemented soymilk is a good proliferation medium for strains of lactobacilli.

TI  == lactobacillus taiwanensis sp. nov., isolated from silage.
AB  == strain firdi 006t, isolated from silage cattle feed, was characterized by using phenotypic and molecular taxonomic methods. the strain was a homofermentative lactic acid bacterium; the cells stained gram-positive and were catalase-negative, non-motile, facultatively anaerobic rods. 16s rrna gene sequence analysis revealed that the strain belongs phylogenetically to the genus  lactobacillus and can be placed within the lactobacillus acidophilus-delbrueckii  group. lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus johnsonii were the most closely related species, with 16s rrna gene sequence similarities of 99.53 and 99.46% to  the respective type strains. low gyrb gene sequence similarities (<90%) and low dna-dna reassociation values (<45%) were obtained between the strain and the phylogenetically closest neighbours. based on phenotypic and genetic evidence, the strain is considered to represent a novel species, for which the name lactobacillus taiwanensis sp. nov. is proposed. the type strain is firdi 006t (=bcrc 17755t =dsm 21401t).

TI  == prediction of surface exposed proteins in streptococcus pyogenes, with a potential application to other gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == the in silico prediction of bacterial surface exposed proteins is of growing interest for the rational development of vaccines and in the study of bacteria-host relationships, whether pathogenic or host beneficial. this interest is driven by the increase in the use of dna sequencing as a major tool in the early characterization of pathogenic bacteria and, more recently, even of complex ecosystems at the host-environment interface in metagenomics approaches. current  protein localization protocols are not suited to this prediction task as they ignore the potential surface exposition of many membrane-associated proteins. therefore, we developed a new flow scheme, surfg+, for the processing of protein  sequence data with the particular aim of identification of potentially surface exposed (pse) proteins from gram-positive bacteria, which was validated for streptococcus pyogenes. the results of an exploratory case study on closely related lactobacilli of the acidophilus group suggest that the yogurt bacterium lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (l. bulgaricus) dedicates a relatively  important fraction of its coding capacity to secreted proteins, while the probiotic gastrointestinal (gi) tract bacteria l. johnsonii and l. gasseri appear to encode a larger variety of pse proteins, that may play a role in the interaction with the host.

TI  == oligosaccharide-mediated inhibition of the adhesion of pathogenic escherichia coli strains to human gut epithelial cells in vitro.
AB  == the aim of the study was to investigate the ability of pectic oligosaccharides (pos) to inhibit adhesion of three strains of verotoxigenic escherichia coli, three strains of enteropathogenic e. coli, and one nonclinical strain of desulfovibrio desulfuricans to human intestinal epithelial cell cultures. lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus gasseri were included for comparison. attachment was determined in the human ht29 cell line by viable count of adherent bacteria. pos in buffer at ph 7.2 were antiadhesive at a dose of 2.5 mg ml(-1), reducing adhesion of enteropathogenic e. coil and verotoxigenic e. coli strains to less than 30% of control values. concentrations resulting in 50% inhibition ranged from 0.15 to 0.46 mg ml(-1). l. acidophilus was not significantly affected, but adhesion of l. gasseri was reduced to 29% of the control value. pos reduced the adhesion of d. desulfuricans to 0.33% of the control value. pos also  had a protective effect against e. coli verocytotoxins vt1 and vt2 at concentrations of 0.01 and 1 microg ml(-1), respectively.

TI  == characterization of the amylovorin locus of lactobacillus amylovorus dce 471, producer of a bacteriocin active against pseudomonas aeruginosa, in combination with colistin and pyocins.
AB  == lactobacillus amylovorus dce 471 produces amylovorin l, a bacteriocin with an antibacterial activity against some strains of the lactobacillus lineage. based on the sequence of one active peptide, a gene encoding active amylovorin l was cloned and sequenced. genome walking allowed us to sequence a larger fragment of  7577 bp of genomic dna, with 12 predicted orfs. the previously characterized amylovorin l peptide-encoding gene is preceded by another gene encoding a small polypeptide with a typical bacteriocin-processing double-glycine site, suggesting that amylovorin l is a two-component class iib bacteriocin (amylovorin lalpha/beta). lalpha and lbeta show the highest similarity to gassericin t from lactobacillus gasseri sbt2055 and blpn from streptococcus pneumoniae r6, respectively, and to lafa and lafx, which form the lactacin f bacteriocin of lactobacillus johnsonii ncc 533. as for other lactic acid bacteria bacteriocins,  amylovorin l showed no activity against the gram-negative opportunistic pathogen  pseudomonas aeruginosa on its own, but showed synergistic inhibitory activity when used in combination with the peptide antibiotic colistin, and, remarkably, with the p. aeruginosa soluble bacteriocins, pyocins s1 and s2.

TI  == analysis of the genome sequence of lactobacillus gasseri atcc 33323 reveals the molecular basis of an autochthonous intestinal organism.
AB  == this study presents the complete genome sequence of lactobacillus gasseri atcc 33323, a neotype strain of human origin and a native species found commonly in the gastrointestinal tracts of neonates and adults. the plasmid-free genome was 1,894,360 bp in size and predicted to encode 1,810 genes. the gc content was 35.3%, similar to the gc content of its closest relatives, l. johnsonii ncc 533 (34%) and l. acidophilus ncfm (34%). two identical copies of the prophage lgai (40,086 bp), of the sfi11-like siphoviridae phage family, were integrated tandomly in the chromosome. a number of unique features were identified in the genome of l. gasseri that were likely acquired by horizontal gene transfer and may contribute to the survival of this bacterium in its ecological niche. l. gasseri encodes two restriction and modification systems, which may limit bacteriophage infection. l. gasseri also encodes an operon for production of heteropolysaccharides of high complexity. a unique alternative sigma factor was present similar to that of b. caccae atcc 43185, a bacterial species isolated from human feces. in addition, l. gasseri encoded the highest number of putative  mucus-binding proteins (14) among lactobacilli sequenced to date. selected phenotypic characteristics that were compared between atcc 33323 and other human  l. gasseri strains included carbohydrate fermentation patterns, growth and survival in bile, oxalate degradation, and adhesion to intestinal epithelial cells, in vitro. the results from this study indicated high intraspecies variability from a genome encoding traits important for survival and retention in the gastrointestinal tract.

TI  == ecophysiology of the developing total bacterial and lactobacillus communities in  the terminal small intestine of weaning piglets.
AB  == weaning of the pig is generally regarded as a stressful event which could lead to clinical implications because of the changes in the intestinal ecosystem. the functional properties of microbiota inhabiting the pig's small intestine (si), including lactobacilli which are assumed to exert health-promoting properties, are yet poorly described. thus, we determined the ecophysiology of bacterial groups and within genus lactobacillus in the si of weaning piglets and the impact of dietary changes. the si contents of 20 piglets, 4 killed at weaning (only sow  milk and no creep feed) and 4 killed at 1, 2, 5, and 11 days post weaning (pw; cereal-based diet) were examined for bacterial cell count and bacterial metabolites by fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish). lactobacilli were the predominant group in the si except at 1 day pw because of a marked reduction in their number. on day 11 pw, bifidobacteria and e. coli were not detected, and enterobacteriaceae and members of the clostridium coccoides/eubacterium rectale cluster were only found occasionally. l. sobrius/l. amylovorus became dominant species whereas the abundance of l. salivarius and l. gasseri/johnsonii declined. concentration of lactic acid increased pw whereas ph, volatile fatty acids, and ammonia decreased. carbohydrate utilization of 76 lactobacillus spp. isolates was studied revealing a shift from lactose and galactose to starch, cellobiose, and xylose, suggesting that the bacteria colonizing the si of piglets adapt to the newly introduced nutrients during the early weaning period. identification of isolates based on partial 16s rrna gene sequence data and comparison with fermentation data furthermore suggested adaptation processes below the species level. the results of our study will help to understand intestinal bacterial ecophysiology and to develop nutritional regimes to prevent or counteract complications during the weaning transition.

TI  == antimicrobial properties of milkfat globule membrane fractions.
AB  == milkfat globule membranes (mfgms) were prepared from bovine cream according to standard procedures. these membranes and peptide hydrolysates, which were generated by proteolysis with immobilized digestive enzymes, were screened for antibacterial activity against escherichia coli o157:h7, listeria monocytogenes,  salmonella enterica typhimurium, pseudomonas fluorescens, bacillus cereus, lactobacillus acidophilus, and lactobacillus gasseri. assays were first performed on beef heart infusion (bhi) plates spotted with test protein-peptide fractions and then seeded with lawns of indicator cells to monitor the zone of growth inhibition. under these experimental conditions, mfgms were most active against salmonella typhimurium and p. fluorescens. however, antibacterial activity was not seen after plating on luria-bertani (lb) medium. we determined that the antimicrobial effects observed on bhi plates were due to the generation of h2o2 by xanthine oxidase, a major protein constituent of the mfgms, as a result of purine catalysis. this substrate is present in bhi but lacking in lb medium. evaluation of purified xanthine oxidase alone resulted in analogous data trends.  the growth of probiotic lactobacillus strains were affected only marginally when  grown on lactobacilli deman rogosa sharpe plates, suggesting the decreased sensitivity of these bacteria to h2o2. in this study, several mfgm hydrolysates exhibited variable antibacterial activity against test food pathogens on agar plates prepared with m9 minimal media, and this variation was not attributable to xanthine oxidase enzymatic activity. the probiotic microorganisms were mostly resilient to these antibacterial fractions. bovine mfgm fractions may represent an excellent resource material from which to generate native, naturally occurring biodefensive proteins and/or peptides.

TI  == are probiotics detectable in human feces after oral uptake by healthy volunteers?
AB  == goals: assessment of the presence of probiotic bacteria in feces after oral ingestion. background: probiotic bacteria are said to have beneficial effects on  the host. as a precondition for any effect, probiotic strains must survive passage through the gastrointestinal tract. study: the feces of seven volunteers  were analyzed for the presence of probiotic strains after one week's oral ingestion of each of six commercially available products: e. coli nissle 0.5-5 x  10(9) cells (mutaflor), enterococcus faecium sf 68 7.5 x 10(7) cells (bioflorin), lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium infantis both 1 x 10(9) cells (infloran), lactobacillus gasseri and bifidobacterium longum both 1 x 10(8) cells (omniflora), lactobacillus casei rhamnosus 1 x 10(9) cells (antibiophilus), and yoghurt enriched with lactobacillus casei immunitas 1 x 10(10) cells (actimel). ten colonies were selected from each stool sample, and dna was extracted and typed using random amplification of polymorphic dna (rapd). typing patterns of the ingested probiotics and the fecal isolates were compared. results: fingerprints identical to the ingested probiotic strains were recovered from fecal samples of 4/7 volunteers after one week of mutaflor, from 4/6 after taking bioflorin, and from 1/6 after infloran. cultivation of strains of the same species from fecal specimens was negative after consumption of antibiophilus, omniflora and actimel. conclusions: after oral consumption of probiotics, e. coli and enterococci could be detected in stool samples (57% and 67%, respectively). in contrast, with only one exception, ingested lactobacilli and bifidobacteria could not be detected in human feces.

TI  == molecular and biochemical characterizations of human oral lactobacilli as putative probiotic candidates.
AB  == introduction: the objective of this study was to characterize the lactobacilli from the human oral cavity as a potential source of probiotic strains. methods: samples were collected from four different locations within the oral cavity: surface of healthy tooth, oral mucous membrane, surface of tooth decay and deep tooth decay. on the basis of morphological and biochemical properties eight categories were formed and 26 isolates were selected for further characterization. the isolates were determined as lactobacillus sp. using primers specific for 16s rdna. sequencing of 16s rdna genes and repetitive sequence-based polymerase chain reactions were used for determination to species and subspecies  levels. results: predominant species were lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus  plantarum, lactobacillus salivarius and lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei, while lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus cellobiosus, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis and lactobacillus gasseri were also present. the isolates lactobacillus salivarius bgho1, lactobacillus fermentum bgho36 and bgho64, lactobacillus gasseri bgho89 and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis  bgho99 exhibited antagonistic action on the growth of staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, micrococcus flavus, salmonella enteritidis, streptococcus  pneumoniae and streptococcus mutans, but not on growth of candida albicans. moreover, the isolates l. salivarius bgho1 and l. gasseri bgho89 were tolerant to low ph and high concentration of bile salts. conclusion: taken together, these findings imply that l. salivarius bgho1 and l. gasseri bgho89 might be subjects for additional investigation as potential probiotic strains.

TI  == similarity and differences in the lactobacillus acidophilus group identified by polyphasic analysis and comparative genomics.
AB  == a set of lactobacilli were investigated by polyphasic analysis. multilocus sequence analysis, dna typing, microarray analysis, and in silico whole-genome alignments provided a remarkably consistent pattern of similarity within the lactobacillus acidophilus complex. on microarray analysis, 17 and 5% of the genes from lactobacillus johnsonii strain ncc533 represented variable and strain-specific genes, respectively, when tested against four independent isolates of l. johnsonii. when projected on the ncc533 genome map, about 10 large clusters of variable genes were identified, and they were enriched around the terminus of replication. a quarter of the variable genes and two-thirds of the strain-specific genes were associated with mobile dna. signatures for horizontal  gene transfer and modular evolution were found in prophages and in dna from the exopolysaccharide biosynthesis cluster. on microarray hybridizations, lactobacillus gasseri strains showed a shift to significantly lower fluorescence  intensities than the l. johnsonii test strains, and only genes encoding very conserved cellular functions from l. acidophilus hybridized to the l. johnsonii array. in-silico comparative genomics showed extensive protein sequence similarity and genome synteny of l. johnsonii with l. gasseri, l. acidophilus, and lactobacillus delbrueckii; moderate synteny with lactobacillus casei; and scattered x-type sharing of protein sequence identity with the other sequenced lactobacilli. the observation of a stepwise decrease in similarity between the members of the l. acidophilus group suggests a strong element of vertical evolution in a natural phylogenetic group. modern whole-genome-based techniques are thus a useful adjunct to the clarification of taxonomical relationships in problematic bacterial groups.

TI  == lactobacillus strains isolated from the vaginal microbiota of healthy women inhibit prevotella bivia and gardnerella vaginalis in coculture and cell culture.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to investigate how human vaginal isolates of lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus jensenii, lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus crispatus inhibit the vaginosis-associated pathogens gardnerella vaginalis and prevotella bivia. results show that all the strains in coculture condition reduced the viability of g. vaginalis and p. bivia, but with differing  degrees of efficacy. the treatment of g. vaginalis- and p. bivia-infected cultured human cervix epithelial hela cells with l. gasseri strain ks120.1 culture or cell-free culture supernatant (cfcs) results in the killing of the pathogens that are adhering to the cells. the mechanism of the killing activity is not attributable to low ph and the presence of lactic acid alone, but rather to the presence of hydrogen peroxide and proteolytic enzyme-resistant compound(s) present in the cfcss. in addition, coculture of g. vaginalis or p. bivia with l.  gasseri ks120.1 culture or ks120.1 bacteria results in inhibition of the adhesion of the pathogens onto hela cells.

TI  == characterisation of prototype nurmi cultures using culture-based microbiological  techniques and pcr-dgge.
AB  == undefined nurmi-type cultures (ntcs) have been used successfully to prevent salmonella colonisation in poultry for decades. such cultures are derived from the caecal contents of specific-pathogen-free birds and are administered via drinking water or spray application onto eggs in the hatchery. these cultures consist of many non-culturable and obligately anaerobic bacteria. due to their undefined nature it is difficult to obtain approval from regulatory agencies to use these preparations as direct fed microbials for poultry. in this study, 10 batches of prototype ntcs were produced using an identical protocol over a period of 2 years. traditional microbiological techniques and a molecular culture-independent methodology, polymerase chain reaction combined with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge), were applied to characterise  these cultures and also to examine if the constituents of the ntcs were identical. culture-dependent analysis of these cultures included plating on a variety of selective and semi-selective agars, examination of colony morphology,  gram-staining and a series of biochemical tests (api, biomerieux, france). two sets of pcr-dgge studies were performed. these involved the amplification of universal and subsequently lactic acid bacteria (lab)-specific hypervariable regions of a 16s rrna gene by pcr. resultant amplicons were subjected to dgge. sequence analysis was performed on subsequent bands present in resultant dgge profiles using the basic local alignment search tool (blast). microbiological culturing techniques tended to isolate common probiotic bacterial species from the genera lactobacillus, lactococcus, bifidobacterium, enterococcus, clostridium, escherichia, pediococcus and enterobacterium as well as members of the genera, actinomyces, bacteroides, propionibacterium, capnocytophaga, proteus, and klebsiella. bacteroides, enterococcus, escherichia, brevibacterium, klebsiella, lactobacillus, clostridium, bacillus, eubacterium, serratia, citrobacter, enterobacter, pectobacterium and pantoea spp. in addition to unculturable bacteria were identified as constituents of the ntcs using universal pcr-dgge analysis. a number of the sequences detected by lab-specific pcr-dgge were homologous to those of a number of lactobacillus spp., including l. fermentum, l. pontis, l. crispatus, l. salivarius, l. casei, l. suntoryeus, l. vaginalis, l. gasseri, l. aviaries, l. johnsonii, l. acidophilus, and l. mucosae  in addition to a range of unculturable lactobacilli. while ntcs are successful due to their complexity, the presence of members of lactobacillus spp. amongst other probiotic genera, in these samples possibly lends to the success of the ntc cultures as probiotics or competitive exclusion products in poultry over the decades. pcr-dgge proved to be an effective tool in detecting non-culturable organisms present in these complex undefined cultures. in conclusion, while the culture-dependent identification methods or pcr-dgge alone cannot comprehensively elucidate the bacterial species present in such complex cultures, their complementarity provides useful information on the identity of the constituents of ntcs and will aid in future development of defined probiotics. moreover, for the purpose of analysing prototype ntcs during their development, pcr-dgge overcomes the limitations associated with conventional culturing methods including their low sensitivities, inability to detect unculturable bacteria and  unknown species, very slow turnabout time and poor reproducibility. this study demonstrated that pcr-dgge is indeed more valuable in detecting predominant microbial populations between various ntcs than as an identification methodology, being more applicable as a quality control method used to analyse for batch-to-batch variation during ntc production.

AB  == oxalic acid is found in dietary sources (such as coffee, tea, and chocolate) or is produced by the intestinal microflora from metabolic precursors, like ascorbic acid. in the human intestine, oxalate may combine with calcium, sodium, magnesium, or potassium to form less soluble salts, which can cause pathological  disorders such as hyperoxaluria, urolithiasis, and renal failure in humans. in this study, an operon containing genes homologous to a formyl coenzyme a transferase gene (frc) and an oxalyl coenzyme a decarboxylase gene (oxc) was identified in the genome of the probiotic bacterium lactobacillus acidophilus. physiological analysis of a mutant harboring a deleted version of the frc gene confirmed that frc expression specifically improves survival in the presence of oxalic acid at ph 3.5 compared with the survival of the wild-type strain. moreover, the frc mutant was unable to degrade oxalate. these genes, which have not previously been described in lactobacilli, appear to be responsible for oxalate degradation in this organism. transcriptional analysis using cdna microarrays and reverse transcription-quantitative pcr revealed that mildly acidic conditions were a prerequisite for frc and oxc transcription. as a consequence, oxalate-dependent induction of these genes occurred only in cells first adapted to subinhibitory concentrations of oxalate and then exposed to ph 5.5. where genome information was available, other lactic acid bacteria were screened for frc and oxc genes. with the exception of lactobacillus gasseri and bifidobacterium lactis, none of the other strains harbored genes for oxalate utilization.

TI  == lactobacillus species isolated from the vagina: identification, hydrogen peroxide production and nonoxynol-9 resistance.
AB  == background: lactic acid production is considered to be the major protection mechanism of lactobacilli against vaginal infections due to genital pathogens. some species of lactobacillus are also hydrogen peroxide (h(2)o(2)) producers. nonoxynol-9 (n-9) is a nonionic detergent and is the active component of many spermicidal preparations. it immobilizes sperm by disrupting the cell membrane and is believed to act similarly on a number of bacteria and viruses. it is known that n-9 inhibits lactobacilli in vitro at concentrations of 0.1% to 1%. purpose: the present study was conducted to identify the species of lactobacillus isolated from vaginal fluids of reproductive-age women and to characterize the h(2)o(2)-producing and n-9-resistant strains in an argentine population. results: we identified lactobacillus acidophilus, l. fermentum, l. gasseri, l. jensenii, l. casei subsp. casei, l. brevis and l. delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii as the most frequent species. in this argentine, south american population, 62% of women had h(2)o(2)-producing vaginal lactobacilli. we found a high number of sensitive  strains. sixty-two h(2)o(2)-producer strains were detected, 50 (80.6%) strains were sensitive to n-9 and 12 (19.4%) strains were resistant to the inhibitory effect of n-9. discussion: the vaginal microecologic findings are comparable to those found in other populations and suggest that (1) vaginal microecologic conditions are likely to be similar among argentine women as in other countries,  and (2) n-9 may have deleterious effects as in other populations.

TI  == oral lactobacilli in chronic periodontitis and periodontal health: species composition and antimicrobial activity.
AB  == background/aims: lactobacilli are known to play an important role in the maintenance of health by stimulating natural immunity and contributing to the balance of microflora. however, their role in chronic periodontitis is unclear. we aimed to identify oral lactobacilli in chronic periodontitis and periodontally healthy subjects, and to determine their antimicrobial activity against putative  oral pathogens. methods: a total of 238 lactobacillus isolates from the saliva and subgingival sites of 20 chronic periodontitis and 15 healthy subjects were collected. in all, 115 strains were identified using rapid amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis. antimicrobial activity against streptococcus mutans, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia was assessed. results: lactobacilli belonging to 10 species were identified. the most prevalent strains in healthy persons were lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus fermentum and in chronic periodontitis patients, lactobacillus plantarum. obligately homofermentatives, particularly l. gasseri, were less prevalent in chronic periodontitis patients compared with healthy subjects (8% vs. 64% for l. gasseri, p < 0.01). sixty-nine percent of tested lactobacilli inhibited s. mutans, 88% a. actinomycetemcomitans, 82% p. gingivalis and 65% p. intermedia. the strongest antimicrobial activity was associated with lactobacillus paracasei, l. plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, and lactobacillus salivarius. the strains from periodontally healthy patients showed a lower antimicrobial activity against s. mutans than the strains from chronic periodontitis patients. conclusion: the composition of oral lactoflora in chronic periodontitis and healthy subjects differs, with a higher prevalence of homofermentative lactobacilli, particularly l. gasseri, in the latter group. both homo- and heterofermentative oral lactobacilli suppress the growth of periodontal pathogens, but the antimicrobial properties are strain, species and origin specific.

TI  == [antifungal effect in selected natural compounds and probiotics and their possible use in prophylaxis of vulvovaginitis].
AB  == objective: a survey of effective natural compounds and probiotics with antifungal activity and their possible use in vulvovaginitis as a prophylactic or therapeutic drug. design: review of literature. setting: charles university at prague, pharmaceutical faculty at hradec kralove. methods: and review of literature and publications from medical data-bases. conclusions: certain natural compounds were proved to exert antimycotic effects. the efficiency of garlic extract under in vitro conditions against yeast of c. albicans family becomes manifest within one hour. essential oils present in the cayenne pepper (capsodum  frutescens) exert considerable antifungal activity against c. albicans as well. clove exerts lower antimycotic effects. the effects of chinese leek are similar to garlic. propolis also possesses antifungal properties, and sensitivity of the  yeast strains decreases in the following order: c. albicans > c. tropicalis > c.  crusei > c. guilliermondii. its efficiency depends on the composition and place of origin. tea trea oil (melalauca alternifolia) is inhibiting strains of candida family (genus) in minimal inhibiting concentration, higher concentrations are necessary for c. crusei and c. norvengensis. in the prophylaxis of vaginal candidoses, oral administration of the strains of lactobacilus rhamnosus gr-1 and l. fermentum rc-14, b-54 may be recommended. moreover there are suitable strains  of l. brevis cd-2, l. salivarius fv-2, l. gasseri mb 335, l. plantarum, useful in the form of gel capsules (l. plantarum) or vaginal tablets (l. gasseri). the strains of l. acidophilus crl 1294 and l. salivarius crl 1328 display the capacity of self aggregation and co-aggregation with candida. it should be pointed out that the probiotic strain of lactobacillus (especially l. casei and l. rhamnosus) may, in exceptional cases, cause bacteriemia and sepsis, especially in immunodeficient patients and those who underwent surgery of alimentary tract.  no protective effect against yeast infection was detected with vitamin e, any positive effect was not unequivocally confirmed with zinc, but adjusting zinc levels to normal may be recommended.

TI  == caseinoglycomacropeptide inhibits adhesion of pathogenic escherichia coli strains to human cells in culture.
AB  == caseinoglycomacropeptide (cgmp) derived from kappa-casein was investigated for its ability to inhibit the adhesion of 3 strains of verotoxigenic escherichia coli (vtec) and 3 strains of enteropathogenic escherichia coli (epec) to human ht29 tissue cell cultures. effects on adhesion of desulfovibrio desulfuricans, lactobacillus pentosus, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus acidophilus, and lactobacillus gasseri were also investigated. generally, cgmp exerted effective anti-adhesive properties at a dose of 2.5 mg/ml, albeit with a high degree of strain specificity. the cgmp reduced adhesion of vtec strains to <50% of the control and reduced adhesion of epec strains to between 80 and 10% of the control. the cgmp also reduced the adhesion of l. pentosus and l. casei to 44 and 42%, respectively. a slight but significant reduction of l. acidophilus, to 81%,  was observed, but no significant effects were detected with either dsv. desulfuricans or l. gasseri. further investigation of the dose response relationships with the e. coli strains gave ic50 values ranging between 0.12 and  1.06 mg/ml.

TI  == [inhibitory activity of vaginal lactobacillus bacteria on yeasts causing vulvovaginal candidiasis].
AB  == growing frequency of therapeutical failures of vulvovaginal candidiasis, resulting from resistance of certain species of candida to imidazole agents, raises interest in the use of probiotics from lactobacillus genera as prophylaxis. unfortunately, little is known about inhibitory mechanisms of lactobacillus on candida. the aim of this study was to compare the activity of selected lactobacillus species, representing the physiological vaginal flora, against candida as well as investigation whether their inhibitory activity against candida is related strictly to hydrogen peroxide and lactic acid production. 125 strains from vaginal smears of healthy women were classified by making use of phenotypic and genotypic methods. the majority of strains belonged  to l. acidophilus: l. acidophilus sensu stricto, l. crispatus, l. gasseri and l.  johnsonii as well as l. fermentum and l. plantarum species. culture supernatants  of selected 25 strains representing the isolated species were examined for their  inhibitory activity against the growth of candida albicans and c. glabrata. the results showed that the strongest and the fastest activity against c. albicans was demonstrated by l. delbrueckii strains, producing the largest quantities of hydrogen peroxide. on the other hand, extended activity, demonstrable after 24 hours, was shown by non-h2o2 producing l. plantarum supernatants. growth of c. glabrata was not inhibited by any of the examined strains of lactobacillus. comparison of activity of live active cultures of lactobacillus strains and their mixtures with this of pure h2o2 and lactic acid has shown that pure chemical compounds were less active than the cultures. this suggests that mixtures of lactobacillus strains are in cooperation with each other using many different metabolites.

TI  == susceptibility to some antifungal drugs of vaginal lactobacilli isolated from healthy women.
AB  == samples were taken from the lateral vaginal wall of 19 healthy women. lactobacilli were isolated from ten of these women. fifty-eight lactobacillus isolates were identified as l. gasseri, l. vaginalis, l. acidophilus, l. delbrueckii spp. lactis, l. crispatus, l. plantarum, l. cellobiosus, l. jensenii, l. salivarius, l. curvatus, l. brevis and l. oris. the inhibitory effect of isoconazole and oxiconazole in 0.2, 0.1 and 0.05 microg/ml concentrations on 58 lactobacillus spp. and candida albicans (ajd 180) were investigated, using an agar diffusion method. although both antifungal drugs showed a large inhibitory effect on c. albicans, oxiconazole had a very low inhibitory effect on lactobacillus isolates. the natural resistance of lactobacilli to anti-fungal drugs may enable the development of an antifungal drug(s)/ probiotic combination  for antifungal activity and lactobacilli replacement therapy.

TI  == anaerobic induction of adherence to laminin in lactobacillus gasseri strains by contact with solid surface.
AB  == the effect of growth conditions on adhesion was studied in six species belonging  to lactobacillus acidophilus homology groups. namely, 17 strains including 6 fresh isolates of l. gasseri from human feces were assessed for their adherence to immobilized fibronectin, laminin, and type iv collagen. these extracellular matrix proteins were used as a model of damaged intestinal mucosa. when the bacteria were grown on mrs agar under anaerobic conditions, all eight l. gasseri  strains and one l. johnsonii strain showed strong adhesiveness to laminin, but not when grown in static mrs broth. a similar pattern was observed in four l. gasseri strains in terms of adherence to fibronectin. no l. gasseri or l. johnsonii strains exhibited adhesion to type iv collagen under either growth condition. adhesion of l. acidophilus, l. crispatus, l. amylovorus, and l. gallinarum was not affected by the growth conditions. although protease treatment of l. gasseri cells abolished the adhesion, periodate oxidation of the cells increased it except in one strain. the adherence of l. gasseri cells was diminished by periodate and alpha-mannosidase treatments of immobilized laminin.  the above results suggest that mannose-specific proteinaceous adhesion can be induced in l. gasseri by contact with a mucosal surface in the anaerobic intestinal lumen.

TI  == lactobacilli in the intestinal microbiota of swedish infants.
AB  == lactobacillus colonisation was examined in 112 swedish infants. faecal samples obtained at 1, 2, 4 and 8 weeks and at 6, 12 and 18 months of age were cultivated quantitatively on rogosa agar. lactobacilli were speciated by pcr and typed to the strain level by randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd). lactobacilli reached a peak at 6 months when 45% of the infants were colonised. l. rhamnosus and l. gasseri were the most common species in this period. colonisation by lactobacilli in general (p < 0.01) and l. rhamnosus in particular (p < 0.05) was  more common in breast-fed than in weaned infants at 6 months of age. lactobacillus isolation reached a nadir of 17% by 12 months (p < 0.0001), but increased to 31% by 18 months of age p < 0.05). the food-related species l. paracasei, l. plantarum, l. acidophilus and l. delbrueckii dominated in this second phase. a single strain persisted for at least 3 weeks in 17% of the infants during the first 6 months, most commonly l. rhamnosus. lactobacillus population counts in colonised infants increased from 10(6.4) cfu/g at 1 week to  10(8.8) cfu/g at 6 months, and then dropped to 10(5.4) cfu/g faeces at 12 months  of age. lactobacillus colonisation was not significantly related to delivery mode, or to presence of siblings or pets in the household. our results suggest that certain lactobacillus species, especially l. rhamnosus, thrive in the intestinal flora of breast-fed infants. after weaning they are replaced by other  lactobacillus species of types found in food.

TI  == marker-free chromosomal integration of the manganese superoxide dismutase gene (soda) from streptococcus thermophilus into lactobacillus gasseri.
AB  == a strategy for functional gene replacement in the chromosome of lactobacillus gasseri is described. the phospho-beta-galactosidase ii gene (lacii) was functionally replaced by the manganese superoxide dismutase (mnsod) gene (soda) from streptococcus thermophilus, by adapting the insertional inactivation method  described for lactobacilli [russell, w.m. and klaenhammer, t.r. 2001 efficient system for directed integration into the lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus gasseri chromosomes via homologous recombination. appl. environ. microbiol. 67, 4361-4364]. l. gasseri carrying the heterologous soda gene grew on lactose as efficiently as the wild-type parent. an active mnsod was expressed in  the transgenic strain, and the enzyme migrated on page-sod activity gels to the same position as that of mnsod from s. thermophilus. the expression of mnsod from a single copy of soda integrated in the chromosome of l. gasseri provided enhanced tolerance to hydrogen peroxide, and extended the viability of carbon/energy starved cultures stored at 25 degrees c. this is the first report showing the successful utilization of the pori plasmids system to generate marker-free gene integration in l. gasseri strains.

TI  == expression of a heterologous manganese superoxide dismutase gene in intestinal lactobacilli provides protection against hydrogen peroxide toxicity.
AB  == in living organisms, exposure to oxygen provokes oxidative stress. a widespread mechanism for protection against oxidative stress is provided by the antioxidant  enzymes: superoxide dismutases (sods) and hydroperoxidases. generally, these enzymes are not present in lactobacillus spp. in this study, we examined the potential advantages of providing a heterologous sod to some of the intestinal lactobacilli. thus, the gene encoding the manganese-containing sod (soda) was cloned from streptococcus thermophilus ao54 and expressed in four intestinal lactobacilli. a 1.2-kb pcr product containing the soda gene was cloned into the shuttle vector ptrk563, to yield psoda, which was functionally expressed and complemented an escherichia coli strain deficient in mn and fesods. the plasmid,  psoda, was subsequently introduced and expressed in lactobacillus gasseri nck334, lactobacillus johnsonii nck89, lactobacillus acidophilus nck56, and lactobacillus reuteri nck932. molecular and biochemical analyses confirmed the presence of the  gene (soda) and the expression of an active gene product (mnsod) in these strains of lactobacilli. the specific activities of mnsod were 6.7, 3.8, 5.8, and 60.7 u/mg of protein for l. gasseri, l. johnsonii, l. acidophilus, and l. reuteri, respectively. the expression of s. thermophilus mnsod in l. gasseri and l. acidophilus provided protection against hydrogen peroxide stress. the data show that mnsod protects cells against hydrogen peroxide by removing o(2)(.-) and preventing the redox cycling of iron. to our best knowledge, this is the first report of a soda from s. thermophilus being expressed in other lactic acid bacteria.

AB  == lactobacillus johnsonii ncc 533 is a member of the acidophilus group of intestinal lactobacilli that has been extensively studied for their "probiotic" activities that include, pathogen inhibition, epithelial cell attachment, and immunomodulation. to gain insight into its physiology and identify genes potentially involved in interactions with the host, we sequenced and analyzed the 1.99-mb genome of l. johnsonii ncc 533. strikingly, the organism completely lacked genes encoding biosynthetic pathways for amino acids, purine nucleotides,  and most cofactors. in apparent compensation, a remarkable number of uncommon and often duplicated amino acid permeases, peptidases, and phosphotransferase-type transporters were discovered, suggesting a strong dependency of ncc 533 on the host or other intestinal microbes to provide simple monomeric nutrients. genome analysis also predicted an abundance (>12) of large and unusual cell-surface proteins, including fimbrial subunits, which may be involved in adhesion to glycoproteins or other components of mucin, a characteristic expected to affect persistence in the gastrointestinal tract (git). three bile salt hydrolases and two bile acid transporters, proteins apparently critical for git survival, were also detected. in silico genome comparisons with the >95% complete genome sequence of the closely related lactobacillus gasseri revealed extensive synteny  punctuated by clear-cut insertions or deletions of single genes or operons. many  of these regions of difference appear to encode metabolic or structural components that could affect the organisms competitiveness or interactions with the git ecosystem.

TI  == the role of probiotics in the treatment and prevention of helicobacter pylori infection.
AB  == literature reporting activity of probiotics in infections due to helicobacter pylori has been reviewed to assess their value in combating such infections. several in vitro studies show that lactobacilli or their cell-free cultures inhibit or kill h. pylori, prevent its adhesion to mammalian epithelial cells and prevent il8 release. in vivo models demonstrate that pre-treatment with a probiotic can prevent h. pylori infections and/or that administration of probiotics markedly reduced an existing infection. thirteen clinical trials have  been published. in six (180 patients), a probiotic was used alone; five of these  had an encouraging result-in three there were significantly reduced breath test readings and in two others some patients were cleared of infection. in seven further trials (682 patients), probiotics were added to a therapeutic regimen of  antibiotics, resulting in an increased cure rate in two studies, and reduced side-effects in four. trials in which fermented milk products or whole cultures of lactobacilli were used tended to show better results than when the probiotic was taken in the form of bacteria alone. not all the studies were randomised, double-blind and placebo controlled, and some involved only small numbers of patients. the results suggest that probiotics may have a place as adjunctive treatment in h. pylori infections and possibly in prophylaxis. future trials should address in particular the type of patient (asymptomatic volunteers, symptomatic patients), choice of probiotic strain(s), a wide range of probiotic strains (lactobacillus acidophilus, l. johnsonii, l. gasseri, lactobacillus gg, bifidobacterium longum, and bioyoghurts) have been used-some non-viable, regimens (doses and duration) and criteria of success (breath test, histology, culture, serology).

TI  == susceptibility of lactobacillus spp. to antimicrobial agents.
AB  == bacteria used as probiotics or in starter cultures may serve as hosts of antibiotic resistance genes, which can be transferred to pathogenic bacteria. before launching a starter culture or a probiotic product into the market, it is  therefore important to verify that the single bacterial isolates (strains) do not contain transferable resistance genes. a study has been undertaken to establish the levels of susceptibility of lactobacillus spp. to various antimicrobial agents. this is a prerequisite for differentiating putative transferable resistance from natural resistance. a selection of 62 strains has been screened with the use of the etest (abbiodisk, stockholm, sweden) for their susceptibility to 25 antimicrobial agents. the strains belonged to the following species: lactobacillus plantarum/pentosus, l. rhamnosus, l. paracasei, l. sakei, l. curvatus and species of the l. acidophilus group: l. johnsonii, l. crispatus, l.  gasseri, and l. acidophilus. the results from the etests have shown that the level of susceptibility to the antimicrobial agents is species-dependent. for the following antimicrobial agents, susceptibility varied several folds between species: vancomycin, teicoplanin, tetracycline, norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, fusidic acid, and clindamycin. the differences between the species were more subtle for the rest of the tested antimicrobial agents. on the basis of the result, it was possible to suggest minimal inhibition concentrations (mics) for the individual lactobacillus species to be used as a microbiological breakpoint when screening strains for transferable resistance genes.

AB  == we have identified and sequenced the genes encoding the aggregation-promoting factor (apf) protein from six different strains of lactobacillus johnsonii and lactobacillus gasseri. both species harbor two apf genes, apf1 and apf2, which are in the same orientation and encode proteins of 257 to 326 amino acids. multiple alignments of the deduced amino acid sequences of these apf genes demonstrate a very strong sequence conservation of all of the genes with the exception of their central regions. northern blot analysis showed that both genes are transcribed, reaching their maximum expression during the exponential phase.  primer extension analysis revealed that apf1 and apf2 harbor a putative promoter  sequence that is conserved in all of the genes. western blot analysis of the licl cell extracts showed that apf proteins are located on the cell surface. intact cells of l. johnsonii revealed the typical cell wall architecture of s-layer-carrying gram-positive eubacteria, which could be selectively removed with licl treatment. in addition, the amino acid composition, physical properties, and genetic organization were found to be quite similar to those of s-layer proteins. these results suggest that apf is a novel surface protein of the lactobacillus acidophilus b-homology group which might belong to an s-layer-like family.

TI  == comparison of two selective media for the detection and enumeration of lactobacilli in human faeces.
AB  == the enumeration of faecal bacteria is an important requirement for many studies of bowel health. one approach is the use of selective culture media for the culture and identification of genera or species from faeces. this study compares  the culture of lactobacilli from dilution series of faecal samples from six healthy human volunteers on two commonly used media, lamvab and rogosa agar. colonies were counted after a 72-h anaerobic incubation at 37 degrees c, and colony morphology recorded by a single observer. dna was isolated from a representative number of colonies and genus-specific pcr, single-stranded conformation polymorphism (sscp) and dna sequencing performed. total colony counts ranged from <3.00 to 7.48 log(10) cfu/g of faeces for lamvab and 5.09 to 7.66 log(10) cfu/g for rogosa. for each subject, the total colony count was higher on rogosa than that obtained with lamvab agar. sscp analysis and dna sequencing indicated that colony morphology was not an accurate predictor of genus identity. growth of two species, lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus gasseri, was not supported on lamvab medium. rogosa agar was more likely to support growth of non-lactobacillus species. therefore, neither medium  gave a fully accurate representation of the lactobacilli species present in human faecal samples.

TI  == vaginal lactobacillus flora of healthy swedish women.
AB  == species of the lactobacillus acidophilus complex are generally considered to constitute most of the vaginal lactobacillus flora, but the flora varies between  studies. however, this may be due to difficulties in identifying the closely related species within the l. acidophilus complex by using traditional methods and to variations in the vaginal status of the participants. two hundred two isolates from the vaginal fluids of 23 swedish women without bacterial vaginosis, as defined by the criteria of nugent et al. (r. p. nugent, m. a. krohn, and s. l. hillier, j. clin. microbiol. 29:297-301, 1991), were typed by randomly amplified  polymorphic dna (rapd) analysis and identified to the species level by temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis, multiplex pcr, and 16s ribosomal dna sequencing. the vaginal flora of most participants was dominated by a single rapd type, but five of them harbored two rapd types representing two different species or strains. the most frequently occurring species were lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus iners, and lactobacillus jensenii. l. iners  has not previously been reported as one of the predominant lactobacillus species  in the vagina.

TI  == a novel immunostimulating aspect of lactobacillus gasseri: induction of "gasserokine" as chemoattractants for macrophages.
AB  == the chemotactic activity of the culture supernatants from 14 strains of lactobacillus acidophilus and l. gasseri was examined for murine macrophages. significant macrophage chemotactic activity was observed in three strains of l. acidophilus and all strains of l. gasseri. the highest activity was observed in the supernatant (1131-sup) from 24-h cultures of l. gasseri jcm1131t. the chemotactic factor from 1131-sup, designated as "gasserokine", was purified by the c18 reverse phase and ion-exchange chromatography. the purity of gasserokine  was checked by hplc with the reverse-phase mode. the chemotactic activity of gasserokine was also observed for human monocytes. the macrophage chemotaxis induced by l. gasseri jcm1131t culture supernatants was discovered to be a new biological function exerted by probiotic lactic acid bacteria. therefore, the activity is expected to be used for one of the functional parameters in the immunomodulating properties of probiotic lactic acid bacteria.

TI  == at oligonucleotides inducing b lymphocyte activation exist in probiotic lactobacillus gasseri.
AB  == this study determined oligonucleotide sequences of mitogenic dna derived from lactic acid bacteria (lab). the chromosomal dna, which was purified from 12 out of 16 strains of lactobacillus acidophilus group lab, induced proliferation of splenic lymphocytes. when dna from l. gasseri jcm1131t was cloned and amplified using pcr, the mitogenic activities of b lymphocytes were significantly increased by 108 of 321 dna clones. ten high homologous nucleotide sequences were found as  possible dna sequences of mitogens, and were then chemically synthesized (sol-lg1 to sol-lg10). two nucleotide sequences (sol-lg7 and sol-lg10) that consist of only a and t nucleotides (at oligonucleotides) were characterized as b lymphocyte specific mitogens because they resulted in proliferation of b lymphocytes but not of t lymphocytes. sol-lg7 preferentially bound to large b lymphocytes and enhanced the expression of the cd86 antigen more than the cd69 antigen on b lymphocytes. the findings show that mitogenic at oligonucleotides are likely to restrict pre-activated subsets of b lymphocytes. this study demonstrated that novel at oligonucleotides triggering b lymphocyte mitogenic responses exist in the nucleoids of l. gasseri and proposed that they have potential as applicants for the production of new functional foods, "bio-defense foods".

AB  == a total of 91 type and reference strains of the lactobacillus casei group and the l acidophilus group were characterized by the automated ribotyping device riboprinter microbial characterization system. the l. casei group was divided into five (c1-c5) genotypes by ribotyping. among them, the strain of l. casei atcc 334 was clustered to the same genotype group as most of l. paracasei strains and l casei jcm 1134t generated a riboprint pattern that was different from the type strain of l. zeae. these results supported the designation of l. casei atcc  334 as the neotype strain, but were not consistent with the reclassification of l. casei jcm 1134t as l. zeae. the l. acidophilus group was also divided into 14  (a1-a11, b1-b3) genotypes by ribotyping. l. acidophilus, l. amylovorus, l. crispatus and l. gallinarum generated ribotype patterns that were distinct from the patterns produced by l. gasseri and l. johnsonii. this result confirmed previous data that the l. acidophilus group divided to two major clusters. five strains of l. acidophilus and two strains of l. gasseri were correctly reidentified by ribotyping. most strains belonging to the l. casei group and the  l. acidophilus group were discriminated at the species level by automated ribotyping. thus this riboprinter system yields rapid, accurate and reproducible  genetic information for the identification of many strains.

TI  == rapid identification of 11 human intestinal lactobacillus species by multiplex pcr assays using group- and species-specific primers derived from the 16s-23s rrna intergenic spacer region and its flanking 23s rrna.
AB  == rapid and reliable two-step multiplex polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assays were established to identify human intestinal lactobacilli; a multiplex pcr was used for grouping of lactobacilli with a mixture of group-specific primers followed by four multiplex pcr assays with four sorts of species-specific primer mixtures for identification at the species level. primers used were designed from nucleotide sequences of the 16s-23s rrna intergenic spacer region and its flanking 23s rrna  gene of members of the genus lactobacillus which are commonly isolated from human stool specimens: lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus delbrueckii (ssp. bulgaricus and ssp. lactis), lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus jensenii, lactobacillus paracasei (ssp. paracasei and ssp. tolerans), lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus rhamnosus and lactobacillus salivarius (ssp. salicinius and ssp. salivarius). the established two-step multiplex pcr assays were applied  to the identification of 84 lactobacillus strains isolated from human stool specimens and the pcr results were consistent with the results from the dna-dna hybridization assay. these results suggest that the multiplex pcr system established in this study is a simple, rapid and reliable method for the identification of common lactobacillus isolates from human stool samples.

AB  == increasing numbers of functional foods and pharmaceutical preparations are being  promoted with health claims based on the potential probiotic characteristics of lactic acid bacteria and on their capacity for stimulating the host immune system. however, the specific immune effects of oral administration of these microbes still remains undefined. in this study, we tested the hypothesis that production of immunologic mediators by leukocytes in mice is affected by orally administered lactic acid bacteria. the specific objectives of this study were to  evaluate the effects of exposure to eight different lactic acid bacteria in mice  on ex vivo cytokine and nitric oxide production in leukocyte cultures. mice were  gavaged with 1 x 10(9) viable bacteria and peritoneal, peyer's patch and splenic  leukocytes were isolated 8 h later. these were cultured for 2 or 5 days in the presence or absence of mitogens and then interleukin (il)-6, il-12, interferon (ifn)-gamma, tumor necrosis factor (tnf)-alpha, and nitric oxide production was measured. the results revealed that lactobacillus acidophilus and l. casei potentiated il-6 and il-12 production by peritoneal cells whereas l. acidophilus  upregulated ifn-gamma and nitric oxide. in contrast, l. helveticus, l. gasseri, l. reuteri, and bifidobacterium attenuated the production of il-6, ifn-gamma, and nitric oxide by peritoneal cells. tnf-alpha was not detectable in peritoneal cultures. none of the bacteria altered ex vivo production of cytokines or nitric  oxide by peyer's patch or spleen cell cultures. taken together, the results suggest that prior oral exposure to lactic acid bacteria could differentially potentiate or attenuate subsequent cytokine and nitric oxide production by peritoneal cells.

AB  == the current taxonomy of probiotic lactic acid bacteria is reviewed with special focus on the genera lactobacillus, bifidobacterium and enterococcus. the physiology and taxonomic position of species and strains of these genera were investigated by phenotypic and genomic methods. in total, 176 strains, including  the type strains, have been included. phenotypic methods applied were based on biochemical, enzymatical and physiological characteristics, including growth temperatures, cell wall analysis and analysis of the total soluble cytoplasmatic  proteins. genomic methods used were pulsed field gel electrophoresis (pfge), randomly amplified polymorphic dna-pcr (rapd-pcr) and dna-dna hybridization for bifidobacteria. in the genus lactobacillus the following species of importance as probiotics were investigated: l. acidophilus group, l. casei group and l. reuteri/l. fermentum group. most strains referred to as l. acidophilus in probiotic products could be identified either as l. gasseri or as l. johnsonii, both members of the l. acidophilus group. a similar situation could be shown in the l. casei group, where most of the strains named l. casei belonged to l. paracasei subspp. a recent proposal to reject the species l. paracasei and to include this species in the restored species l. casei with a neotype strain was supported by protein analysis. bifidobacterium spp. strains have been reported to be used for production of fermented dairy and recently of probiotic products. according to phenotypic features and confirmed by dna-dna hybridization most of the bifidobacteria strains from dairy origin belonged to b. animalis, although they were often declared as b. longum by the manufacturer. from the genus enterococcus, probiotic ec. faecium strains were investigated with regard to the  vana-mediated resistance against glycopeptides. these unwanted resistances could  be ruled out by analysis of the 39 kda resistance protein. in conclusion, the taxonomy and physiology of probiotic lactic acid bacteria can only be understood  by using polyphasic taxonomy combining morphological, biochemical and physiological characteristics with molecular-based phenotypic and genomic techniques.

TI  == antimutagenicity and the influence of physical factors in binding lactobacillus gasseri and bifidobacterium longum cells to amino acid pyrolysates.
AB  == antimutagenic and binding properties of 28 strains of lactobacillus gasseri and 2 strains of bifidobacterium longum on the mutagenicity of amino acid pyrolysates were investigated in vitro using a streptomycin-dependent (sd510) strain of salmonella typhimurium ta 98. four strains of l. acidophilus (sbt0274, sbt1703, sbt10239, and sbt10241) and 1 strain of b. longum (sbt 2928) exhibited the highest percentage of antimutagenicity and binding. these 5 strains were further  optimized for other physical factors influencing the mechanism of binding, such as cell and mutagen concentration, ph, and incubation time. in all of the selected strains, 2 mg of cells bound with 88 to 95% of 0.2 mg of 3-amino-1,4 dimethyl-5h-pyrido[4,3-b]indole in 30 min at ph 7.0. other amino acid pyrolysates, such as 3-amino-1-methyl-5h-pyrido[4,3-b]indole, 2-amino-6-methyldi-pyrido[1,2-a:3',2'-d]imidazole, 2-amino-3-methyl-imidazo[4,5,f]quinoline, and 2-amino-3,4-dimethyl-imidazo[4,5,f]quinoline were also tested for the binding ability of these strains. we observed that the complexity of the mutagens greatly influenced the binding properties. the binding of 3-amino-1,4 dimethyl-5h-pyrido[4,3-b]indole to the purified cell walls was very high compared with that of the crude cell wall, peptidoglycan, or the cell extract. binding was inhibited when the cell walls were subjected to treatment with metaperiodate or trichloroacetic acid but not when they were subjected to treatment with lysozyme, trypsin, or proteinase k, reflecting the role of the carbohydrate component as a  binding site.

TI  == sequence analysis by cloning of the structural gene of gassericin a, a hydrophobic bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus gasseri la39.
AB  == gassericin a, a bacteriocin from lactobacillus gasseri la39, was purified to homogeneity from the culturesupernatant mainly by reverse-phase chromatography. the molecular weight of gassericin a was found to be 5,652 by mass analysis, unlike the estimated 3,800 found by sds-page. however, when the purified preparation was treated with lysylendopeptidase, it migrated as a single band to  5,600 with bacteriocin activity on sds-page. n- and c-terminal amino acids could  not be identified. the internal amino acid could be identified after gassericin a was hydrolyzed with lysylendopeptidase. the dna of the structural gene of gassericin a was sequenced by cloning of the gene from chromosomal dna with an oligonucleotide probe. the structural gene of gassericin a was found on the chromosomal dna as an open reading frame encoding a protein composed of 91 amino  acids. the amino acid sequence of mature gassericin a was predicted to be 58 residues from the dna sequence and results of mass analysis. these results suggested that gassericin a has a closed circular structure with n- and c-terminals linked. gassericin a is a hydrophobic class ii bacteriocin; it was 98% identical with acidocin b produced by lactobacillus acidophilus m46.

TI  == adherence of human vaginal lactobacilli to vaginal epithelial cells and interaction with uropathogens.
AB  == three strains of lactobacillus, identified as lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus gasseri, and lactobacillus jensenii, were selected from among 70 isolates from the vaginas of healthy premenopausal women for properties relevant  to mucosal colonization or antagonism. all three self-aggregated and adhered to epithelial vaginal cells, displacing well-known vaginal pathogens, such as g. vaginalis, and inhibiting the growth in vitro of escherichia coli and streptococcus agalactiae. the surface components involved in self-aggregation appeared to be proteins for l. gasseri and lipoproteins for l. acidophilus and l. jensenii, as judged by susceptibility to treatment with appropriate degrading enzymes. the factors responsible for adherence to epithelial vaginal cells seemed to be glycoproteins (l. acidophilus and l. gasseri) and carbohydrate (l. jensenii). the receptors of the vaginal cells were glycolipids, which presumably  were the targets of the competition observed between the lactobacilli and the pathogenic microbes.

TI  == isolation and partial characterization of bacteriocins produced by lactobacillus  gasseri jcm 2124.
AB  == four antibacterially active peptides (b1 to b4) were purified from the culture broth of l. gasseri jcm 2124. the b2 peptide (gassericin b2) was determined to be 4400 da by mass spectrometry and partially sequenced. gassericin b2 did not show  any sequence similarities to other known bacteriocins. the b1 and b3 peptides shared identical sequences with two peptides of a two-component bacteriocin from  lactobacillus acidophilus. however, synergistic activity upon complementation of  b1 and b3 was not observed. based on amino acid sequencing and molecular mass, it is suggested that b1 and b4 peptides were derived from b3 (gassericin b3).

TI  == functional analysis of the gene encoding immunity to lactacin f, lafi, and its use as a lactobacillus-specific, food-grade genetic marker.
AB  == lactacin f is a two-component class ii bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus johnsonii vpi 11088. the laf operon is composed of the bacteriocin structural genes, lafa and lafx, and a third open reading frame, orfz. two strategies were employed to study the function of orfz. this gene was disrupted in the chromosome of nck64, a lafa729 lafx orfz derivative of vpi 11088. a disruption cassette consisting of orfz interrupted with a cat gene was cloned into psa3 and introduced into nck64. manipulation of growth temperatures and antibiotic selection resulted in homologous recombination which disrupted the chromosomal copy of orfz with the cat gene. this orfz mutation resulted in loss of immunity to lactacin f but had little effect on production of lafx, which is not bactericidal without lafa. expression of orfz in this orfz- background rescued the immune phenotype. expression of orfz in a bacteriocin-sensitive derivative of vpi 11088 also reestablished immunity. these data indicate that orfz, renamed lafi, encodes the immunity factor for the lactacin f system. the sensitivity of various lactobacillus strains to lactacin f was further evaluated. lactacin f inhibited 11 strains including several members of the a1, a2, a3, a4, b1, and b2  l. acidophilus homology groups. expression of lafi in bacteriocin-sensitive strains l. acidophilus atcc 4356, l. acidophilus ncfm/n2, l. fermentum ncdo1750,  l. gasseri atcc 33323, and l. johnsonii atcc 33200 provided immunity to lactacin  f. furthermore, it was shown that lactacin f production by vpi 11088 could be used to select for l. fermentum ncdo1750 transformants containing the recombinant plasmid encoding lafi. the data demonstrate that lafi is functional in heterologous hosts, suggesting that it may be a suitable food-grade genetic marker for use in lactobacillus species.

TI  == the presence of two s-layer-protein-encoding genes is conserved among species related to lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  == previously we have shown that the type strain of lactobacillus acidophilus possesses two s-protein-encoding genes, one of which is silent, on a chromosomal  segment of 6 kb. the s-protein-encoding gene in the expression site can be exchanged for the silent s-protein-encoding gene by inversion of this slp segment. in this study the presence of s-protein and corresponding s-protein-encoding genes of strains belonging to species that are closely related to l. acidophilus was determined. all strains investigated were identified by numerical comparison of highly standardized one-dimensional sds-page whole-cellular-protein patterns. western blot and southern blot methods were used to identify the presence of, and homology between, s-proteins and s-protein-encoding genes. from these analyses we conclude that strains of l. acidophilus, l. crispatus, l. amylovorus and l. gallinarum possess an s-layer and contain two slp genes. strains of l. helveticus possess an s-layer but have only  one intact slp gene. strains of l. gasseri, l. johnsonii and l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus have neither an s-layer nor s-protein-encoding genes hybridizing with probes derived from the l. acidophilus slpa or slpb region. the  presence of a highly conserved 5' region in the slp genes of strains of l. acidophilus, l. crispatus, l. amylovorus and l. gallinarum suggests that s-layer  variation is a common feature for strains of these species.

TI  == composition of the lactobacillus acidophilus complex isolated from vaginal flora.
AB  == one hundred and fifty human vaginal samples containing a diversity of pathogens or nonpathogens (gardnerella vaginalis, streptococcus sp., staphylococcus sp., candida albicans. mycoplasma sp.) were examined for their content in lactobacilli of the lactobacillus acidophilus complex. although all samples contained lactobacilli, strains of the l. acidophilus complex were present in only twenty-nine cases. isolates were further characterized and compared with type strains or reference strains in an attempt to differentiate by phenotypic means the genospecies of the l. acidophilus complex. data regarding specific activities of beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) and of phospho-beta-galactosidase (p-beta-gal) provided no specific information at the species level within the l. acidophilus complex. dna-relatedness differentiates this genospecies. most lactobacilli isolated from the vaginal flora of symptomatic women were genotypically close to  l. gasseri cip 102991t by the technique of dna/dna hybridization.

TI  == lactobacillus- and bifidobacterium-mediated antigenotoxicity in the colon of rats.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) are proposed to have several beneficial effects, including the inactivation of carcinogens. we have studied the potential of lactobacillus acidophilus (from a commercially available yogurt), lactobacillus gasseri (p79), lactobacillus confusus (dsm20196), streptococcus thermophilus (ncim 50083), bifidobacterium breve and bifidobacterium longum (from human infant stool) to prevent the induction of dna damage by n-methyl-n'-nitro-n-nitrosoguanidine (mnng, 7.5 mg/kg body wt) in colon cells of  the rat. using the new technique of single cell microgel electrophoresis, all investigated strains were antigenotoxic toward mnng after a single dose of 10(10) viable cells/kg body wt p.o. eight hours before the carcinogen. one-half and one-tenth of this initial dose resulted in a loss of protective activity. high doses of heat-treated l. acidophilus strains were also not antigenotoxic. one mechanism of the preventive effect could be that bacterial metabolites or components are responsible. accordingly, selected examples were investigated in vitro in colon cells of the rat. metabolically active l. acidophilus cells, as well as an acetone extract of the culture, prevented mnng-induced dna damage. different cell fractions from l. acidophilus (cytoplasm, cell wall skeleton, cell wall) were devoid of antigenotoxic activity, whereas the peptidoglycan fraction and whole freeze-dried cells were antigenotoxic. as a second carcinogen, 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (dmh) was used. a dose- and time-response study was first performed to assess the effects of dmh in several segments of the gastrointestinal (gi) tract. exposure for 16 hours to 15 or 25 mg dmh/kg body wt  p.o. induced dna damage in cells of the distal colon of rats, whereas no cytotoxicity was seen. pretreatment orally with lab on four consecutive mornings  before dmh gavage (8 hours after the last lab application) revealed that l. acidophilus, l. confusus, l. gasseri, b. longum, and b. breve inhibited the genotoxic effect of dmh. one of four s. thermophilus and one of three lactobacillus delbrueckeii ssp. bulgaricus strains were also protective. heat-treated l. acidophilus did not inhibit dmh-induced genotoxicity. a few aliquots of the colon cells were processed immunohistochemically for the presence of the "proliferation cell nuclear antigen" (pcna). dmh treatment did not increase pcna, nor was there any modulation by lab. the effect of l. acidophilus  on foreign compound-metabolizing enzymes (phase i and phase ii) in liver and colon cells of rats revealed only one parameter to be modulated, namely, a two- to three-fold increase in the levels of nadph-cytochrome p-450 reductase. the meaning of this finding, in terms of possible chemoprevention by lab, remains unclear. in conclusion, our studies show that most, but not all, lab tested could strongly inhibit genotoxicity in the gi tract of the rat and that viable lab organisms are required for the protective effect in vivo. the comet assay technique is a powerful tool to elucidate such in vivo antigenotoxic activities in tumor target tissues.

TI  == positive selection, cloning vectors for gram-positive bacteria based on a restriction endonuclease cassette.
AB  == lactococcus lactis contains numerous restriction and modification (r/m) systems of different specificities. a novel iis type r/m system encoded by the llai operon has previously been characterized from the l. lactis conjugative plasmid ptr2030. the llai operon is composed of six genes: first, a small regulatory gene llaic precedes the methylase gene llaim. the following three genes, llai.1, llai.2, llai.3, are all essential for restriction endonuclease activity and are designed as the restriction cassette llair. the forth open reading frame of unknown function follows the llair gene cassette. we have successfully subcloned  the three llair genes, llai.1, llai.2, and llai.3, without llaim, as a suicide cassette into the three shuttle vectors ptrkl2, ptrkh2, and pbv5030. a promoter (p6) from lactobacillus acidophilus atcc4356, which is functional in e. coli, lactococci, and lactobacilli (djordjevic and topisirovic, unpublished) was cloned upstream of the three gene cassette. restriction activity was evaluated in escherichia coli and several gram-positive bacteria. the llair restriction cassette was not functional in e. coli, but its presence was lethal to l. lactis, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus johnsonii, lactobacillus acidophilus, carnobacterium pisicola, enterococcus faecalis, bacillus subtilis, and leuconostoc gelidum. several novel, positive selection cloning vectors were developed that can exploit unique cloning sites within the llair cassette. insertions in llai.1 resulted in complete inactivation of restriction activity and provided unconditional selection for recombinant plasmids in surviving transformants. these positive selection cloning vectors are the first for gram-positive bacteria that are based on a restriction endonuclease cassette. functional activity of the llair genes in various gram-positive bacteria would also enable use of these cloning vectors for positive selection of promoters, terminators, and regulatory sequences across these genera.

TI  == factors involved in adherence of lactobacilli to human caco-2 cells.
AB  == a quantitative assay performed with bacterial cells labelled with [3h]thymidine was used to investigate factors involved in the adherence of human isolates lactobacillus acidophilus bg2fo4 and ncfm/n2 and lactobacillus gasseri adh to human caco-2 intestinal cells. for all three strains, adherence was concentration dependent, greater at acidic ph values, and significantly greater than adherence  of a control dairy isolate, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus 1489. adherence of l. acidophilus bg2fo4 and ncfm/n2 was decreased by protease treatment of the bacterial cells, whereas adherence of l. gasseri adh either was  not affected or was enhanced by protease treatment. putative surface layer proteins were identified on l. acidophilus bg2fo4 and ncfm/n2 cells but were not  involved in adherence. periodate oxidation of bacterial cell surface carbohydrates significantly reduced adherence of l. gasseri adh, moderately reduced adherence of l. acidophilus bg2fo4, and had no effect on adherence of l.  acidophilus ncfm/n2. these results indicate that lactobacillus species adhere to  human intestinal cells via mechanisms which involve different combinations of carbohydrate and protein factors on the bacterial cell surface. the involvement of a secreted bridging protein, which has been proposed as the primary mediator of adherence of l. acidophilus bg2fo4 in spent culture supernatant (m.-h. coconnier, t. r. klaenhammer, s. kerneis, m.-f. bernet, and a. l. servin, appl. environ. microbiol. 58:2034-2039, 1992), was not confirmed in this study. rather, a ph effect on caco-2 cells contributed significantly to the adherence of this strain in spent culture supernatant.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == lactobacilli are often used in products of animal origin because of their technological properties and as protective cultures against pathogenic microorganisms, however they are supposed to be related to human infections as well. therefore 39 strains of species that are in biotechnological usage, including the type strains, and some clinical isolates were investigated. 9 strains of l. acidophilus, 7 of l. gasseri and 23 strains of l. rhamnosus were tested. biochemical and physiological properties were proved by classical tests.  analysis of the total soluble cytoplasmatic protein patterns was performed with diamine silver staining, a technique not previously applied to lactobacilli. classical tests were able to confirm all strains as belonging to one of the three species. analysis of protein patterns allowed to differentiate between strains of the same species. in case of l. acidophilus biotechnologically used strains and clinical isolates were clustered separately. l. rhamnosus formed three clusters.  sds-page of proteins together with diamine silver staining seems to be helpful to detect intra-species differences. it was stated, that technologically used strains of lactobacilli could clearly be differentiated from another and also from clinical isolates.

(1980; international journal of systematic bacteriology 30, 53-68). another cluster corresponded to dna group b.  it contained two subclusters, which agreed perfectly with dna subgroups b1 (l. gasseri) and b2 (l. johnsonii), respectively. the 23s rrna genes were partially sequenced and 23s-rrna-targeted oligonucleotide probes were designed for identification of dna groups a1, b1 and b2. probe lbg reacted with all strains of electrophoretic cluster b1 (l. gasseri), probe lbj hybridized with strains of cluster b2 (l. johnsonii) and probe lba with strains of cluster a1 (authentic l.  acidophilus). the probes were successfully used for the identification of strains belonging to the respective species. the phylogenetic relationship of a representative of l. johnsonii was determined by comparative sequence analysis of the 16s rrna genes. it is very closely related to l. gasseri.

AB  == lactobacillus strain adh is a bile-resistant, bacteriocin-producing human isolate that was phenotypically classified within the lactobacillus acidophilus group. total dna and phage dna extracted from strain adh were separately digested with bcli and ligated with bcli-digested pgk12. following electroporation of these ligation mixtures directly into strain adh, electrotransformants were recovered at frequencies of 1.5 x 10(3) and 2.0 x 10(4)/micrograms of pgk12 for preparations of pgk12::phage dna and pgk12::total dna, respectively. among the electrotransformants screened, 6 and 22% contained passenger dna of either phage  dna or chromosomal origin, respectively, as determined by restriction-enzyme analyses and hybridization assays. derivatives of pgk12 containing passenger dna  of chromosomal (ptrk120) or phage (ptrk121) origin and ptrk15 (native cryptic plasmid) were evaluated for use as species-specific probes. the strain adh-derived probes hybridized primarily to members of the b-1 and b-2 lactobacilli homology groups and demonstrated strain-specific polymorphisms within these groups. identical hybridization patterns were established for strain adh and lactobacillus gasseri vpi 6033 (atcc 19992). identification of dna probes and establishment of a host-vector cloning system have facilitated our efforts to characterize the lactobacillus chromosome and to distinguish between closely related species thought to be important inhabitants of the gastrointestinal tract.

TI  == identification of vaginal lactobacilli from asymptomatic women.
AB  == in the present work, carried out by means of phenotypic and genotypic tests, it has been demonstrated that none of the vaginal lactobacilli isolated from asymptomatic women were genetically close to l. acidophilus atcc 4356. strains of homofermentative lactobacilli were identified as lactobacillus gasseri, l. jensenii and l. crispatus, while in the heterofermentative only one strain was classified as l. fermentum. moreover a genetically homologous group of heterofermentative lactobacilli, that could represent a new species, were evidenced.

TI  == immunoelectron microscopic studies on the localization of peptidoglycan peptide subunit pentapeptides in bacterial cell walls.
AB  == the peptide subunit pentapeptide h-l-ala-d-glu(l-lys-d-ala-d-ala-oh)-nh2 of peptidoglycan was localized in the cell walls of several gram-positive bacteria employing the indirect immunoferritin technique. specific antibodies to the d-alanyl-d-alanine moiety of non-crosslinked peptide subunit pentapeptide were raised in rabbits by immunization with synthetic immunogen albumin-(ch2co-gly-l-ala-l-ala-d-ala-d-ala-oh)39. specificity of these antibodies for the peptide subunit pentapeptide and not for the peptide subunit tetrapeptide was corroborated in a farr-type radio-active hapten binding assay. specificity of labelling with ferritin was established by immunoelectron microscopic controls, and by the excellent correlation between specific labelling of cells with ferritin and the particular peptidoglycan primary structure of bacterial strains  investigated. cells of lactobacillus gasseri, streptococcus pyogenes and staphylococcus aureus revealing non-crosslinked peptide subunit pentapeptides in  their peptidoglycans could specifically be labelled. lactobacillus acidophilus and bacillus subtilis, on the contrary, missing such pentapeptides, failed in labelling. the implication of this method to possibly localize the points of attack of penicillin or cycloserine is discussed.
