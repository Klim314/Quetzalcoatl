influence of controlled lactic fermentation on growth and sporulation of bacillus cereus in milk.
the growth and sporulation of bacillus cereus nvh 45 in a fermentor with controlled ph or simulated ph conditions were investigated. the study was carried out in a fermentor to measure the influence of a rapid and a slow lactic acid production on the inhibition of b. cereus in a controlled environment during the initial part of fermentation and to observe if other factors than lactic acid influenced the inhibition. in the controlled ph experiments the ph was allowed to decrease to an end ph 5.0, 5.5 or 6.0 either by lactobacillus casei 2756 (a fast acid producer) or lactobacillus acidophilus ncfb 1748 (a slow acid producer). in co-cultures of lb. casei 2756 and b. cereus nvh 45, low numbers (10-70 cfu/ml) of b. cereus nvh 45 were observed at end ph 5.5 (72 h) while at ph 5.0 no viable cells (<10 cfu/ml) were detected (48-72 h). b. cereus nvh 45 did not sporulate in co-culture with lb. casei 2756. in co-culture with lb. acidophilus ncfb 1748, b. cereus nvh 45 sporulated and survived as spores. in these co-cultures b. cereus nvh 45 grew to higher maximum counts (>10(7) cfu/ml) than with lb. casei 2756 (<10(7) cfu/ml). significantly different amounts of lactic acid were observed between the two co-cultures after 7 and 12 h. a rapid decrease of ph appears to prevent b. cereus from sporulating and it seems that it is enough to just reach ph 5.0 rapidly and keep that ph to achieve the desirable inhibition of b. cereus. in the simulated ph experiments b. cereus nvh 45 was inoculated in the fermentor and the different ph developments from different lab strains were monitored by addition of lactic acid. these experiments showed the same tendency: a fast ph reduction during the initial hours of fermentation, simulating lactococci, resulted in complete inhibition of b. cereus nvh 45 (<10 cfu/ml). however, when simulating the ph development of the two different lactobacillus strains, complete inhibition of b. cereus nvh 45 was not seen. in co-cultures competition for nutrients with consequences for cell density appears to be important. based on these results it seems that b. cereus must reach a certain density to induce sporulation.
isolation and characterization of two bacteriocins of lactobacillus acidophilus lf221.
lactobacillus acidophilus lf221 produced bacteriocin-like activity against different bacteria including some pathogenic and food-spoilage species. besides some lactic acid bacteria, the following species were inhibited: bacillus cereus, clostridium sp., listeria innocua, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus d. l. acidophilus lf221 produced at least two bacteriocins, acidocin lf221 a and acidocin lf221 b, which were purified by ammonium sulphate precipitation, ion-exchange chromatography, hydrophobic interaction and reverse-phase fplc. the antibacterial substances were heat-stable, sensitive to proteolytic enzymes (trypsin, pepsin, pronase, proteinase k) and migrated as 3500- to 5000-da proteins on sodium dodecyl sulphate/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. the sequences of 46 amino-terminal amino acid residues of peptide a and 35 of peptide b were determined. among the residues identified, no modified amino acids were found. no significant homology was found between the amino acid sequences of acidocin lf221 a and other bacteriocins of lactic acid bacteria and 26% homology was found between acidocin lf221 b and brevicin 27. l. acidophilus lf221 may be of interest as a probiotic strain because of its human origin and inhibition of pathogenic bacteria, especially clostridium difficile.
antibacterial effect of the adhering human lactobacillus acidophilus strain lb.
the spent culture supernatant of the human lactobacillus acidophilus strain lb produces an antibacterial activity against a wide range of gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens. it decreased the in vitro viability of staphylococcus aureus, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella typhimurium, shigella flexneri, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, bacillus cereus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacter spp. in contrast, it did not inhibit lactobacilli and bifidobacteria. the activity was heat stable and relatively sensitive to enzymatic treatments and developed under acidic conditions. the antimicrobial activity was independent of lactic acid production. activity against s. typhimurium sl1344 infecting human cultured intestinal caco-2 cells was observed as it was in the conventional c3h/he/oujco mouse model with s. typhimurium c5 infection and oral treatment with the lb spent culture supernatant.
antimicrobial activity of lactobacilli: preliminary characterization and optimization of production of acidocin b, a novel bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus acidophilus m46.
approximately 1000 lactobacillus strains were isolated and screened for the production of antimicrobial activity, using a target panel of spoilage organisms and pathogens. only eight positive strains were found; two of these were studied in more detail. lactobacillus salivarius m7 produces the new broad spectrum bacteriocin salivaricin b which inhibits the growth of listeria monocytogenes, bacillus cereus, brochothrix thermosphacta, enterococcus faecalis and many lactobacilli. a new atypical bacteriocin produced by lact. acidophilus m46, acidocin b, combines the inhibition of clostridium sporogenes with a very narrow activity spectrum within the genus lactobacillus and was selected for further characterization. acidocin b is sensitive to trypsin, heat-stable (80 degrees c for 20 min) and can be extracted from the culture supernatant fluid with butanol. native acidocin b occurs as a large molecular weight complex (100 kda), while with sds-page the partly purified activity migrates as a peptide of 2.4 kda. optimization of the cultivation conditions resulted in an eightfold increase of the amount of acidocin b produced during growth. growth is not necessary for acidocin b production; washed producer cells can synthesize the bacteriocin in a chemically defined production medium. the application potential of acidocin b is discussed.
antimicrobial activity of neutralized extracellular culture filtrates of lactic acid bacteria isolated from a cultured indian milk product ('dahi').
neutralized extracellular culture filtrate obtained from isolates of lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus delbruecki ssp. bulgaricus, lactobacillus salivarius and lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis from 'dahi' showed weak to moderate inhibition of staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, escherichia coli, bacillus brevis, bacillus circulans, bacillus coagulans, bacillus laterosporus, bacillus subtilis and pseudomonas aeruginosa when tested by the diffusion agar well assay method. the effective minimum quantity of lactic culture filtrates required to obtain complete inhibition of an inoculum of 10(3) cfu/ml of the bacteria tested was between 20 and 26% (vol/vol), as determined by the agar incorporation method. neutralized extracellular culture filtrate of these lactic cultures added at a level of 10% in sterile, 10% reconstituted non-fat dry milk was able to either suppress or retard growth of selected bacterial cultures when incubated at 37 degrees c for 24 h. this study indicated the antimicrobial activity of dahi and the potential of using neutralized extracellular culture filtrate of lactic acid bacteria in the biopreservation of foods.
effects of lactic acid bacteria and organic acids on growth and germination of bacillus cereus.
growth and germination of vegetative cells and endospores of bacillus cereus were affected by streptococcus lactis, streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus acidophilus, and lactobacillus bulgaricus in nonfat milk medium and by salts of organic acids in broth medium. growth of the lactic acid bacteria was not affected by b. cereus. b. cereus increased rapidly to about 10 cfu/ml when cells were added at the beginning of growth of lactic acid bacteria; it was inactivated slowly when added after 24 h and rapidly when added after 72 h of lactic acid bacterial growth. streptococci were more inhibitory to the growth of b. cereus than lactobacilli were at 24 h. spore germination was not affected after 24 h, but it was inhibited after 48 and 72 h of lactic acid bacterial growth. acetate was more inhibitory to the growth of vegetative cells, while formate was more inhibitory to spore germination. acetate, formate, and lactate (all at 0.1 m) completely inactivated multiplication of b. cereus at ph 6.1, 6.0, and 5.6, respectively. spores of b. cereus were more resistant to these organic acids compared with the resistance of vegetative cells. formate, lactate, and acetate (all at 0.1 m) caused 50% inhibition of spore germination at ph 4.4, 4.3, and 4.2, respectively.
