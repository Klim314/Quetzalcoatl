TI  == an in vitro comparative study determining bactericidal activity of stabilized chlorine dioxide and other oral rinses.
AB  == objective: the study was conducted to determine the bactericidal activity of a stabilized chlorine dioxide oral rinse (closys oral rinse) compared to products currently available on the market. methods: oral bacteria associated with gingivitis and periodontitis were exposed to rinses for one minute and five minutes. the numbers of colony forming units per milliliter (cfu/ml) were measured prior to and following exposure to determine the bactericidal activity.  results: as expected, listerine and crest pro-health demonstrated complete kill on all bacteria exposed within one minute. breath rx exhibited the weakest levels of bactericidal effects overall. closys and chlorhexidine rinses proved identical 100% kills against the periodontal pathogens at five minutes; in some cases, closys oral rinse achieved a higher kill at the one-minute mark over the chlorhexidine rinse. conclusion: the results demonstrated that closys oral rinse  has potential for providing a therapeutic benefit, making it an attractive option to induce compliance in patients concerned about taste and tooth discoloration during oral health therapy.

TI  == cleavage of a recombinant human immunoglobulin a2 (iga2)-iga1 hybrid antibody by  certain bacterial iga1 proteases.
AB  == to understand more about the factors influencing the cleavage of immunoglobulin a1 (iga1) by microbial iga1 proteases, a recombinant human iga2/iga1 hybrid molecule was generated. in the hybrid, termed iga2/a1 half hinge, a seven-amino-acid sequence corresponding to one half of the duplicated sequence making up the iga1 hinge was incorporated into the equivalent site in iga2. insertion of the iga1 half hinge into iga2 did not affect antigen binding capacity or the functional activity of the hybrid molecule, as judged by its ability to bind to iga fcalpha receptors and trigger respiratory bursts in neutrophils. although the iga2/a1 hybrid contained only half of the iga1 hinge, it was found to be cleaved by a variety of different bacterial iga1 proteases, including representatives of those that cleave iga1 in the different duplicated halves of the hinge, namely, those of prevotella melaninogenica, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. sanguis, neisseria meningitidis types 1 and 2, n. gonorrhoeae types 1 and 2, and haemophilus influenzae type 2. thus, for these enzymes the recognition site for iga1 cleavage is contained within half of the iga1 hinge region; additional distal elements, if required, are provided by either an iga1 or an iga2 framework. in contrast, the iga2/a1 hybrid appeared to be resistant to cleavage with s. oralis and some h. influenzae type 1 iga1 proteases, suggesting  these enzymes require additional determinants for efficient substrate recognition.

TI  == pathogenicity of encapsulated bacteroides melaninogenicus group, b. oralis and b. ruminicola subsp. brevis in abscesses in mice.
AB  == the pathogenicity of 27 clinical isolates of the bacteroides melaninogenicus (bm) group and four clinical isolates of b. oralis and b. ruminicola subsp. brevis were investigated by inoculating them into mice and subsequently determining their ability to cause subcutaneous (sc) or intraperitoneal abscesses. only 11 isolates of bm group and one b. ruminicola induced abscesses in mice, and all were found to be heavily encapsulated on recovery from the abscesses (more than 50 per cent of the organisms were encapsulated). when the other 23 isolates, however, were injected sc in combination with either klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, staphylococcus  aureus or streptococcus pyogenes, abscesses were formed in 16 of the 23 combinations. the bacteroides spp. recovered from the mixed infection were heavily encapsulated. capsules also formed in bacteroides if the organisms were injected together with capsular material or formalin killed cells of k. pneumoniae or encapsulated bacteroides sp. once non-encapsulated or only slightly encapsulated strains acquired a capsule, they could induce abscesses on reinoculation into mice.

TI  == bacterial interference by oropharynegeal and clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == anaerobic isolates were tested for bacterial inhibitory activity. of 144 isolates, 102 were from oropharynegeal washings, and 42 were from clinical specimens. thirteen facultative bacterial species (seven members of the enterobacteriaceae and six species of gram-positive cocci) were used as indicators of inhibition. eleven anaerobic species were isolated from oral secretions. all isolates of bacteroides melaninogenicus, the most commonly recovered species, consistently inhibited several species of indicator bacteria.  bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides oralis, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius had unprecictable inhibitory activity, whereas most of the other oral anaerobes were  noninhibitory. the 42 clinical species were generally noninhibitory.
