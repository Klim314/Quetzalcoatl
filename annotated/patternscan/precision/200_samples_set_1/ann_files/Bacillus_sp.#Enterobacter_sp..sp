TI  == potential use of bacillus thuringiensis bacteriocins to control antibiotic-resistant bacteria associated with mastitis in dairy goats.
AB  == mastitis caused by microbial infections in dairy goats reduces milk yield, modifies milk composition, and potentially contributes to morbidity in herds and  consumers of dairy products. microorganisms associated with mastitis in dairy goats are commonly controlled with antibiotics, but it is known that continued use of these chemical agents promotes antibiotic resistance among bacterial populations. recently, it has been shown that bacteriocins of bacillus thuringiensis inhibit growth of food-borne pathogens and also bacteria associated with bovine mastitis. however, there is no report on their ability to inhibit microorganisms linked to mastitis in dairy goats. in this study, using 16s rdna and its regions of rdna, we identified nine bacterial isolates and an encapsulated yeast associated with mastitis in dairy goats. enterococcus durans,  brevibacillus sp., and staphylococcus epidermidis 2 were resistant to, respectively, 75, ~67, ~42, and ~42 % of the antibiotics screened. in addition, 60 % of the bacterial isolates were resistant to penicillin, ampicillin, vancomycin, and dicloxacillin. importantly, 60 % of the isolates were inhibited by the bacteriocins, but s. epidermidis 1, enterobacter sp., escherichia vulneris, and cryptococcus neoformans were not susceptible to these antimicrobial peptides. using brevibacillus sp. and staphylococcus chromogenes as indicator bacteria, we show that peptides of ~10 kda that correspond to the molecular mass  of bacteriocins used in this study are responsible for the inhibitory activity. our results demonstrate that multiple antibiotic-resistant bacteria associated with subclinical mastitis in dairy goats from guanajuato, mexico, are susceptible to bacteriocins produced by b. thuringiensis.

TI  == antimicrobial and immunomodulatory efficacy of extracellularly synthesized silver and gold nanoparticles by a novel phosphate solubilizing fungus bipolaris tetramera.
AB  == background: particulates of nanometers size have occupied a significant area in the field of medicinal and agricultural purposes due to their large surface-to-volume ratio and exceptional physicochemical, electronic and mechanical properties. myconanotechnology, an interface between mycology and nanotechnology is budding nowadays for nanoparticle-fabrication using fungus or its metabolites. in the present study, we have isolated and characterized a novel phosphate solubilizing fungus b. tetramera kf934408 from rhizospheric soil. this  phosphatase releasing fungus was subjected to extracellular synthesis of metal nanoparticles by redox reaction. results: silver (agnps) and gold nanoparticles (aunps) were characterized by dynamic light scattering and transmission electron  microscopic analysis. the formulated agnps were irregular shaped with a size ranging between 54.78 nm to 73.49 nm whereas aunps were spherical or hexagonal, with a size of 58.4 and 261.73 nm, respectively. the nanoparticles were assessed  for their antibacterial and antifungal efficacy. the results showed effective antimicrobial activity of agnps against bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, enterobacter aeroginosa and trichoderma sp. at higher concentrations, however, aunps possessed only moderate antibacterial efficacy while they found no antifungal activity. cytotoxicity analysis of nanoparticles on j774 and thp1 alpha cell lines revealed the dose dependence in case of agnps, while aunps were  non-toxic at both low and high doses. furthermore, significant elevation of intracellular ros was observed after 4 h of incubation with both the nanoparticles. the capping of fungal proteins on the particulates might be involved in the activities demonstrated by these inert metal nanoparticles. conclusion: in conclusion, the findings showed that the metal nanoparticles synthesized by fungus b. tetramera could be used as an antimicrobial agents as well as cost effective and nontoxic immunomodulatory delivery vehicle.

TI  == a sequential statistical approach towards an optimized production of a broad spectrum bacteriocin substance from a soil bacterium bacillus sp. yas 1 strain.
AB  == bacteriocins, ribosomally synthesized antimicrobial peptides, display potential applications in agriculture, medicine, and industry. the present study highlights integral statistical optimization and partial characterization of a bacteriocin substance from a soil bacterium taxonomically affiliated as bacillus sp. yas 1 after biochemical and molecular identifications. a sequential statistical approach (plackett-burman and box-behnken) was employed to optimize bacteriocin (bac yas 1) production. using optimal levels of three key determinants (yeast extract (0.48% (w/v), incubation time (62 hrs), and agitation speed (207 rpm)) in peptone yeast beef based production medium resulted in 1.6-fold enhancement in bac yas 1 level (470 au/ml arbitrary units against erwinia amylovora). bac yas 1  showed activity over a wide range of ph (1-13) and temperature (45-80 degrees c). a wide spectrum antimicrobial activity of bac yas 1 against the human pathogens (clostridium perfringens, staphylococcus epidermidis, campylobacter jejuni, enterobacter aerogenes, enterococcus sp., proteus sp., klebsiella sp., and salmonella typhimurium), the plant pathogen (e. amylovora), and the food spoiler  (listeria innocua) was demonstrated. on top and above, bac yas 1 showed no antimicrobial activity towards lactic acid bacteria (lactobacillus bulgaricus, l. casei, l. lactis, and l. reuteri). promising characteristics of bac yas 1 prompt  its commercialization for efficient utilization in several industries.

TI  == production of humic substances through coal-solubilizing bacteria.
AB  == in this paper, the production of humic substances (hs) through the bacterial solubilization of low rank coal (lrc) was evaluated. the evaluation was carried out by 19 bacterial strains isolated in microenvironments with high contents of coal wastes. the biotransformed lrc and the hs produced were quantified in vitro  in a liquid growth medium. the humic acids (ha) obtained from the most active bacterial strain were characterized via elemental composition (c, h, n, o), ir analyses, and the e4/e6 ratio; they were then compared with the ha extracted chemically using naoh. there was lrc biotransformation ranged from 25 to 37%, and hs production ranged from 127 to 3100 mg . l(-1). more activity was detected in the isolated strains of bacillus mycoides, microbacterium sp, acinetobacter sp, and enterobacter aerogenes. the ha produced by b. mycoides had an ir spectrum and an e4/e6 ratio similar to those of the ha extracted with naoh, but their elemental composition and their degree of aromatic condensation was different. results suggest that these bacteria can be used to exploit the lrc resulting from coal mining activities and thus produce hs in order to improve the content of humified organic matter in soils.

TI  == chemical composition of essential oil from ripe fruit of schinus terebinthifolius raddi and evaluation of its activity against wild strains of hospital origin.
AB  == the essential oil (eo) composition of ripe fruit of s. terebinthifolius raddi was analyzed by gc-ms. the oil extraction yielded 6.54 +/- 1.06% (w/w). seventeen compounds were identified, accounting for 91.15% of the total oil, where monoterpenes constituted the main chemical class (85.81%), followed by sesquiterpenes (5.34%). the major monoterpene identified was delta-3-carene (30.37%), followed by limonene (17.44%), alpha-phellandrene (12.60%) and alpha-pinene (12.59%). trans-caryophyllene (1.77%) was the major sesquiterpene identified. the antibacterial activity of the essential oil was evaluated against wild strains of hospital origin (escherichia coli, pseudomonas sp., klebsiella oxytoca, corynebacterium sp., staphylococcus aureus, enterobacter sp., enterobacter agglomerans, bacillus sp., nocardia sp. and streptococcus group d).  the essential oil of the ripe fruit of s. terebinthifolius raddi has shown to be  active against all tested wild strains, with minimum inhibitory concentration ranging from 3.55 mug/ml to 56.86 mug/ml. however, it has revealed some differences in susceptibility: the general, gram-positive species showed greater  sensitivity to the action of eo, which is probably due to the lower structural complexity of their cell walls.

TI  == evidence of polyethylene biodegradation by bacterial strains from the guts of plastic-eating waxworms.
AB  == polyethylene (pe) has been considered nonbiodegradable for decades. although the  biodegradation of pe by bacterial cultures has been occasionally described, valid evidence of pe biodegradation has remained limited in the literature. we found that waxworms, or indian mealmoths (the larvae of plodia interpunctella), were capable of chewing and eating pe films. two bacterial strains capable of degrading pe were isolated from this worm's gut, enterobacter asburiae yt1 and bacillus sp. yp1. over a 28-day incubation period of the two strains on pe films, viable biofilms formed, and the pe films' hydrophobicity decreased. obvious damage, including pits and cavities (0.3-0.4 mum in depth), was observed on the surfaces of the pe films using scanning electron microscopy (sem) and atomic force microscopy (afm). the formation of carbonyl groups was verified using x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (xps) and microattenuated total reflectance/fourier transform infrared (micro-atr/ftir) imaging microscope. suspension cultures of yt1 and yp1 (10(8) cells/ml) were able to degrade approximately 6.1 +/- 0.3% and  10.7 +/- 0.2% of the pe films (100 mg), respectively, over a 60-day incubation period. the molecular weights of the residual pe films were lower, and the release of 12 water-soluble daughter products was also detected. the results demonstrated the presence of pe-degrading bacteria in the guts of waxworms and provided promising evidence for the biodegradation of pe in the environment.

TI  == highly effective bacterial agents against cimbex quadrimaculatus (hymenoptera: cimbicidae): isolation of bacteria and their insecticidal activities.
AB  == cimbex quadrimaculatus (hymenoptera: cimbicidae) is one of the serious pests of almonds in turkey and worldwide. since there is no effective control application  against this pest, it has been a serious problem up to now. therefore, we aimed to find an effective bacterium that can be utilized as a biocontrol agent against c. quadrimaculatus in pest management. we isolated seven bacteria from dead and live c. quadrimaculatus larvae, and evaluated the larvicidal potency of all isolates on the respective pest. based on the morphological, physiological, biochemical and molecular properties (partial sequence of 16s rrna gene), the isolates were identified to be bacillus safensis (cq1), bacillus subtilis (cq2),  bacillus tequilensis (cq3), enterobacter sp. (cq4), kurthia gibsonii (cq5), staphylococcus sp. (cq6) and staphylococcus sciuri (cq7). the results of the larvicidal activities of these isolates indicated that the mortality value obtained from all treatments changed from 58 to 100 %, and reached 100 % with b.  safensis (cq1) and b. subtilis (cq2) on the 3rd instar larvae within 10 days of application of 1.89 x 10(9) cfu/ml bacterial concentration at 25 degrees c under  laboratory conditions. findings from this study indicate that these isolates appear to be a promising biocontrol agent for c. quadrimaculatus.

TI  == microstructure, microbial profile and quality characteristics of high-pressure-treated chicken nuggets.
AB  == high-pressure processing (300 mpa for 5 min) as a non-thermal post-processing intervention was employed to improve the shelf life and qualities of cooked refrigerated chicken nuggets. pomegranate peel extract (1%) was also used as a source of natural antioxidant and antimicrobial in chicken nuggets. microstructure, microbial profile, instrumental colour, texture profile and lipid oxidation were evaluated. high-pressure treatment and pomegranate peel extract did not influence significantly the colour and textural properties of cooked chicken nuggets. thiobarbituric acid reactive substance values significantly (p < 0.05) increased in pressure-treated nuggets. microstructural studies revealed shrinkage in the structure and loosening of the dense network of meat emulsion due to high-pressure treatment. pressure treatment resulted in a reduction of 2-3.0 log10 cfu/g in total plate count and enterobacteriaceae count. molecular characterization studies revealed that enterobacter amnigenus and enterobacter sp. in control and bacillus licheniformis, enterococcus gallinarum and acinetobacter baumannii in high-pressure-treated chicken nuggets were the major spoilage bacteria.

TI  == isolation and enzyme bioprospection of endophytic bacteria associated with plants of brazilian mangrove ecosystem.
AB  == the mangrove ecosystem is a coastal tropical biome located in the transition zone between land and sea that is characterized by periodic flooding, which confers unique and specific environmental conditions on this biome. in these ecosystems,  the vegetation is dominated by a particular group of plant species that provide a unique environment harboring diverse groups of microorganisms, including the endophytic microorganisms that are the focus of this study. because of their intimate association with plants, endophytic microorganisms could be explored for biotechnologically significant products, such as enzymes, proteins, antibiotics and others. here, we isolated endophytic microorganisms from two mangrove species, rhizophora mangle and avicennia nitida, that are found in streams in two mangrove systems in bertioga and cananeia, brazil. bacillus was the most frequently isolated genus, comprising 42% of the species isolated from cananeia and 28% of the species from bertioga. however, other common endophytic genera such as pantoea, curtobacterium and enterobacter were also found. after identifying the isolates, the bacterial communities were evaluated for enzyme production. protease activity was observed in 75% of the isolates, while endoglucanase activity occurred in 62% of the isolates. bacillus showed the highest activity rates for amylase and esterase and endoglucanase. to our knowledge, this is the first reported diversity analysis performed on endophytic  bacteria obtained from the branches of mangrove trees and the first overview of the specific enzymes produced by different bacterial genera. this work contributes to our knowledge of the microorganisms and enzymes present in mangrove ecosystems.

TI  == effects of ensiling fermentation and aerobic deterioration on the bacterial community in italian ryegrass, guinea grass, and whole-crop maize silages stored  at high moisture content.
AB  == the effects of storage period and aerobic deterioration on the bacterial community were examined in italian ryegrass (ir), guinea grass (gg), and whole-crop maize (wm) silages. direct-cut forages were stored in a laboratory silo for 3, 7, 14, 28, 56, and 120 d without any additives; live counts, content  of fermentation products, and characteristics of the bacterial community were determined. 2,3-butanediol, acetic acid, and lactic acid were the dominant fermentation products in the ir, gg, and wm silages, respectively. the acetic acid content increased as a result of prolonged ensiling, regardless of the type  of silage crop, and the changes were distinctively visible from the beginning of  gg ensiling. pantoea agglomerans, rahnella aquatilis, and enterobacter sp. were the major bacteria in the ir silage, indicating that alcoholic fermentation may be due to the activity of enterobacteria. staphylococcus sciuri and bacillus pumilus were detected when ir silage was spoiled, whereas between aerobically stable and unstable silages, no differences were seen in the bacterial community  at silo opening. lactococcus lactis was a representative bacterium, although acetic acid was the major fermentation product in the gg silage. lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus brevis, and morganella morganii were suggested to be associated with the increase in acetic acid due to prolonged storage. enterobacter cloacae appeared when the gg silage was spoiled. in the wm silage, no distinctive changes due to prolonged ensiling were seen in the bacterial community. throughout the ensiling, weissella paramesenteroides, weissella confusa, and klebsiella pneumoniae were present in addition to l. plantarum, l. brevis, and l. lactis. upon deterioration, acetobacter pasteurianus, klebsiella variicola, enterobacter hormaechei, and bacillus gibsonii were detected. these results demonstrate the diverse bacterial community that evolves during ensiling  and aerobic spoilage of ir, gg, and wm silages.

TI  == analysis of interaction property of calycosin-7-o-beta-d-glucoside with human gut microbiota.
AB  == calycosin-7-o-beta-d-glucoside as the major isoflavonoids in astragali radix has  been investigated intensively and has been reported to possess a wide range of pharmacological properties. however, the route and metabolites of calycosin-7-o-beta-d-glucoside by human intestinal bacteria are not well understood and its metabolites may accumulate to exert physiological effects. therefore, the objective of this study was to screen the ability of the bacteria  to metabolize calycosin-7-o-beta-d-glucoside and assess the effect of this compound on the intestinal bacteria. finally, five strains including bacteroides  sp.13, and sp.58, clostridium sp.21-2, veillonella sp.43-1, and bacillus sp.46 were isolated from human intestinal bacteria and were studied their abilities to  convert calycosin-7-o-beta-d-glucoside. a total of six metabolites were identified in human incubated solution by ultra performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (uplc-q-tof-ms). the results indicated that hydrolysis, demethylation, dehydroxylation and acetylation were the major metabolism of calycosin-7-o-beta-d-glucoside. on the other hand, different strains of intestinal bacteria have varying degrees of growth sensitivity to calycosin-7-o-beta-d-glucoside. growth of certain pathogenic bacteria such as enterobacter, enterococcus, clostridium and bacteroides was significantly repressed by calycosin-7-o-beta-d-glucoside, while commensal probiotics such as lactobacillus, bifidobacterium were less severely affected. this indicates that calycosin-7-o-beta-d-glucoside exert significant effects on the intestinal environment by modulation of the intestinal bacterial population.  our observation provided further evidence for the importance of intestinal bacteria in the metabolism, absorption and potential activity of calycosin-7-o-beta-d-glucoside in human health and diseases.

TI  == calcium carbonate precipitation by heterotrophic bacteria isolated from biofilms  formed on deteriorated ignimbrite stones: influence of calcium on eps production  and biofilm formation by these isolates.
AB  == heterotrophic caco3-precipitating bacteria were isolated from biofilms on deteriorated ignimbrites, siliceous acidic rocks, from morelia cathedral (mexico) and identified as enterobacter cancerogenus (22e), bacillus sp. (32a) and bacillus subtilis (52g). in solid medium, 22e and 32a precipitated calcite and vaterite while 52g produced calcite. urease activity was detected in these isolates and caco3 precipitation increased in the presence of urea in the liquid  medium. in the presence of calcium, eps production decreased in 22e and 32a and increased in 52g. under laboratory conditions, ignimbrite colonization by these isolates only occurred in the presence of calcium and no caco3 was precipitated.  calcium may therefore be important for biofilm formation on stones. the importance of the type of stone, here a siliceous stone, on biological colonization is emphasized. this calcium effect has not been reported on calcareous materials. the importance of the effect of calcium on eps production and biofilm formation is discussed in relation to other applications of caco3 precipitation by bacteria.

AB  == biomethanated distillery spent wash (bmds) retains dark black colour with complex persistent organic pollutants even after anaerobic treatment. the specific ratio  (4:3:1:1) of proteus mirabilis (fj581028), bacillus sp. (fj581030), raoultella planticola (gu329705) and enterobacter sakazakii (fj581031) decolourised bmds up  to 76% within 192 hr along with degradation of persistent organic compounds in presence of glucose (1%) and peptone (0.1%). the colour removal ability was noted due to ligninolytic enzyme activity. where the maximum manganese peroxidase was 1.93 u ml(-1) and laccase activity equalled 0.84 u ml(-1). the gas chromatography-mass spectrophotometry (gc-ms) analysis confirmed the direct correlation between colourant and persistent organic pollutants due to simultaneous reduction of colour and pollutants present in bmds. the seed germination test showed reduction of 75% toxicity after bacterial treatment process.

TI  == molecular identification of microbial community in surface and undersurface douchi during postfermentation.
AB  == to find the reason for fermentation failure of surface douchi during postfermentation, the microbial communities in undersurface and surface samples were investigated using cell counting method and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). the results showed that the microbial biomass in surface  douchi was obviously different from that in undersurface douchi even sampled from the same fermentation tanks, and a 10- to 100-fold reduction of microbial cell counts in undersurface had been observed. the bacterial dgge profile and principal component analysis (pca) results indicated that only lactococcus lacts  subsp. lactis and bacillus thermoamylovorans were detected from surface douchi, while lactococcus lacts subsp. lactis, staphylococcus lentus and 2 uncultured strains occupied the dominant positions in undersurface douchi; when amplified using bacillus-specific primers, bacillus thermoamylovorans, bacillus subtilis, and enterobacter sp. were found in undersurface douchi, while only bacillus thermoamylovorans were detected from surface douchi; compared to the bacteria and bacillus, the dgge profiles and pca plot of fungi indicated that the fungal community between surface and undersurface douchi was similar and mainly composed by yeasts. in this study, we detected the microbial biomass and species in postfermentation stage of douchi, and the various microbial diversity in undersurface and surface samples might be the cause of the fermentation failure in surface fermentation tanks.

TI  == effect of liquiritin on human intestinal bacteria growth: metabolism and modulation.
AB  == licorice is one of the oldest and most frequently used prescribed traditional chimese medicines. however, the route and metabolites of liquiritin by human intestinal microflora are not well understood and its metabolites may accumulate  to exert physiological effects. therefore, our objective was to screen the ability of the bacteria to metabolize liquiritin and assess the effect of this compound on the intestinal bacteria. finally, six strains, comprising bacteroides sp. 22 and sp.57, veillonella sp. 31 and sp.48, bacillus sp. 46 and clostridium sp. 51, were isolated and their abilities to convert liquiritin studied. a total  of five metabolites were identified using ultra performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry in human incubated solution. the results indicated that hydrolysis, hydrogenation, methylation, deoxygenation and acetylation were the major routes of metabolism of liquiritin.  on the other hand, effect of liquiritin on different strains of intestinal bacteria growth was detected using an emax precision microplate reader. growth of certain pathogenic bacteria, such as enterobacter, enterococcus, clostridium and  bacteroides, was significantly repressed by liquiritin, while growth of commensal probiotics such as lactobacillus and bifidobacterium was less severely affected.  our observation provided further evidence for the importance of intestinal bacteria in the metabolism, and the potential activity of liquiritin in human health and disease.

TI  == identification of polybacterial communities in patients with postoperative, posttraumatic, and endogenous endophthalmitis through 16s rrna gene libraries.
AB  == endophthalmitis is a potential vision-threatening complication following surgical procedures (postoperative endophthalmitis [poe]), trauma (posttraumatic endophthalmitis [pte]), and bacteremic seeding of the eye from a distant infection site (endogenous endophthalmitis [ee]). several studies have revealed the polybacterial characteristics of endophthalmitis, which make the administration of antibiotics to treat the disease challenging. however, until now, the polybacterial communities of poe, pte, and ee have not been precisely studied. hence, the present study was designed to identify the bacterial community of endophthalmitis through 16s rrna gene libraries. of the 40 intraocular samples tested, 30 libraries were constructed with bacterial nested-pcr-positive samples. the obtained recombinant clones were screened through amplified rrna gene restriction analysis (ardra) to identify unique clones. the multiple types of ardra patterns (p=0.345) and diverse bacterial sequences (p=0.277) within the libraries revealed the polybacterial nature of infection in poe, pte, and ee. moreover, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on polybacterial infection in ee. gram-positive bacteria, including bacillus spp. (n=19), streptococcus spp. (n=18), staphylococcus spp. (n=6), exiguobacterium spp. (n=3), gemella spp. (n=2), enterococcus spp. (n=2), a lysinibacillus sp. (n=1), a clostridium sp. (n=1), and a nocardia sp. (n=1), and  gram-negative bacteria, including serratia spp. (n=18), pseudomonas spp. (n=10),  enterobacter spp. (n=8), acinetobacter spp. (n=3), pantoea spp. (n=3), a haemophilus sp. (n=1), and a massilia sp. (n=1), were identified. interestingly,  among them, 10 bacterial species were not previously reported to be associated with endophthalmitis or other ocular infections. besides, the presence of 4 unidentifiable clones suggests the possibility of novel organisms that might cause eye infections. therefore, it is recommended that, in addition to the polybacterial nature of poe, pte, and ee infections, the spectrum of the pathogenic bacterial community identified in this work should be considered while administering antibiotic therapy in suspected endophthalmitis cases.

TI  == microbial inoculants and organic amendment improves plant establishment and soil  rehabilitation under semiarid conditions.
AB  == the re-establishment of autochthonous shrub species is an essential strategy for  recovering degraded soils under semiarid mediterranean conditions. a field assay  was carried out to determine the combined effects of the inoculation with native  rhizobacteria (bacillus megaterium, enterobacter sp, bacillus thuringiensis and bacillus sp) and the addition of composted sugar beet (sb) residue on physicochemical soil properties and lavandula dentata l. establishment. one year  after planting, bacillus sp. and b. megaterium + sb were the most effective treatments for increasing shoot dry biomass (by 5-fold with respect to control) and enterobacter sp + sb was the most effective treatments for increasing dry root biomass. all the treatments evaluated significantly increased the foliar nutrient content (npk) compared to control values (except b. thuringiensis + sb). the organic amendment had significantly increased available phosphorus content in rhizosphere soil by 29% respect to the control. enterobacter sp combined with sugar beet residue improved total n content in soil (by 46% respect to the control) as well as microbiological and biochemical properties. the selection of  the most efficient rhizobacteria strains and their combined effect with organic residue seems to be a critical point that drives the effectiveness of using these biotechnological tools for the revegetation and rehabilitation of degraded soils  under semiarid conditions.

TI  == cultivable endophytic bacteria from leaf bases of agave tequilana and their role  as plant growth promoters.
AB  == agave tequilana weber var. 'azul' is grown for the production of tequila, inulin  and syrup. diverse bacteria inhabit plant tissues and play a crucial role for plant health and growth. in this study culturable endophytic bacteria were extracted from leaf bases of 100 healthy agave tequilana plants. in plant tissue  bacteria occurred at mean population densities of 3 million cfu/g of fresh plant  tissue. three hundred endophytic strains were isolated and 16s rdna sequences grouped the bacteria into eight different taxa that shared high homology with other known sequences. bacterial endophytes were identified as acinectobacter sp., a. baumanii, a. bereziniae, cronobacter sakazakii, enterobacter hormaechei,  bacillus sp. klebsiella oxytoca, pseudomonas sp., enterococcus casseliflavus, leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides and gluconobacter oxydans. isolates were confirmed to be plant growth promoting bacteria (pgpb) by their capacities for nitrogen fixation, auxin production, phosphate solubilization, or  antagonism against fusarium oxysporum ac132. e. casseliflavus jm47 and k. oxytoca jm26 secreted the highest concentrations of iaa. the endophyte acinectobacter sp. jm58 exhibited the maximum values for nitrogen fixation and phosphate solubilization index (psi). inhibition of fungi was found in pseudomonas sp. jm9p and k. oxytoca jm26. bacterial endophytes show promise for use as bio-inoculants  for agave cultivation. use of endophytes to enhance cultivation of agave may be particularly important for plants produced by micropropagation techniques, where  native endophytes may have been lost.

TI  == differential activity of autochthonous bacteria in controlling drought stress in  native lavandula and salvia plants species under drought conditions in natural arid soil.
AB  == the effectiveness of autochthonous plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria was studied in lavandula dentata and salvia officinalis growing in a natural arid mediterranean soil under drought conditions. these bacteria identified as bacillus megaterium (bm), enterobacter sp. (e), bacillus thuringiensis (bt), and  bacillus sp. (bsp). each bacteria has different potential to meliorate water limitation and alleviating drought stress in these two plant species. b. thuringiensis promoted growth and drought avoidance in lavandula by increasing k  content, by depressing stomatal conductance, and it controlled shoot proline accumulation. this bacterial effect on increasing drought tolerance was related to the decrease of glutathione reductase (gr) and ascorbate peroxidase (apx) that resulted sensitive indexes of lower cellular oxidative damage involved in the adaptative drought response in b. thuringiensis-inoculated lavandula plants. in contrast, in salvia, having intrinsic lower shoot/root ratio, higher stomatal conductance and lower apx and gr activities than lavandula, the bacterial effects on nutritional, physiological and antioxidant enzymatic systems were lower. the benefit of bacteria depended on intrinsic stress tolerance of plant involved. lavadula demonstrated a greater benefit than salvia to control drought stress when inoculated with b. thuringiensis. the bacterial drought tolerance assessed as survival, proline, and indolacetic acid production showed the potential of this bacteria to help plants to grow under drought conditions. b. thuringiensis may be used for lavandula plant establishment in arid environments. particular characteristic of the plant species as low shoot/root ratio and high stomatal conductance are important factors controlling the bacterial effectiveness improving nutritional, physiological, and metabolic plant activities.

TI  == physical impaction injury effects on bacterial cells during spread plating influenced by cell characteristics of the organisms.
AB  == aims: to understand the factors that contribute to the variations in colony-forming units (cfu) in different bacteria during spread plating. methods and results: employing a mix culture of vegetative cells of ten organisms varying in cell characteristics (gram reaction, cell shape and cell size), spread plating to the extent of just drying the agar surface (50-60 s) was tested in comparison  with the alternate spotting-and-tilt-spreading (sats) approach where 100 mul inoculum was distributed by mere tilting of plate after spotting as 20-25 microdrops. the former imparted a significant reduction in cfu by 20% over the spreader-independent sats approach. extending the testing to single organisms, gram-negative proteobacteria with relatively larger cells (escherichia, enterobacter, agrobacterium, ralstonia, pantoea, pseudomonas and sphingomonas spp.) showed significant cfu reduction with spread plating except for slow-growing methylobacterium sp., while those with small rods (xenophilus sp.) and cocci (acinetobacter sp.) were less affected. among gram-positive nonspore formers, staphylococcus epidermidis showed significant cfu reduction while staphylococcus haemolyticus and actinobacteria (microbacterium, cellulosimicrobium and brachybacterium spp.) with small rods/cocci were unaffected. vegetative cells of bacillus pumilus and b. subtilis were generally unaffected while others with larger rods (b. thuringiensis, brevibacillus, lysinibacillus and paenibacillus spp.) were significantly affected. a simulated plating study coupled with live-dead bacterial staining endorsed the chances of cell disruption with spreader impaction in afflicted organisms. conclusions: significant reduction in cfu could occur during spread plating due to physical impaction injury to bacterial cells depending on the spreader usage and the variable effects on different organisms are determined by gram reaction, cell size and cell shape. the inoculum spreader could impart physical disruption of vegetative cells against a hard surface. significance and impact of study: possibility of cfu reduction in sensitive organisms and the skewed selection of hardier organisms during spread plating, and the recommendation of sats as an easier and safer alternative for cfu enumerations.

TI  == medium optimization to improve the flocculation rate of a novel compound bioflocculant, cbf-256, using response surface methodology and flocculation characters.
AB  == a novel compound bioflocculant, cbf-256, was obtained using three bacterial strains, bacillus sp., enterobacter sp., and aeromonas sp., which were screened from activated sludge of a printing and dyeing wastewater treatment plant. response surface methodology was employed to optimize the fermentation medium dosage to improve the flocculation rate of cbf-256, which increased from 69.00% to 82.65%. in addition the yield of the compound bioflocculant increased from 2.31 g.l(-1) to 2.84 g.l(-1). the flocculating efficiency distribution of the components of the culture broth indicated that the supernatant was the most effective component in the flocculation process. fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy were used to analyze the fermentation medium and composite bacteria. the compound flocculants were produced easily, and during the flocculation process, all the flocculation ingredients settled down in the remaining sludge along with the bacteria screened from the activated sludge, without causing secondary pollution.

TI  == diversity of sporadic symbionts and nonsymbiotic endophytic bacteria isolated from nodules of woody, shrub, and food legumes in ethiopia.
AB  == fifty-five bacterial isolates were obtained from surface-sterilized nodules of woody and shrub legumes growing in ethiopia: crotalaria spp., indigofera spp., and erythrina brucei, and the food legumes soybean and common bean. based on partial 16s rrna gene sequence analysis, the majority of the isolates were identified as gram-negative bacteria belonging to the genera achromobacter, agrobacterium, burkholderia, cronobacter, enterobacter, mesorhizobium, novosphingobium, pantoea, pseudomonas, rahnella, rhizobium, serratia, and variovorax. seven isolates were gram-positive bacteria belonging to the genera bacillus, paenibacillus, planomicrobium, and rhodococcus. amplified fragment length polymorphism (aflp) fingerprinting showed that each strain was genetically distinct. according to phylogenetic analysis of reca, glnii, rpob, and 16s rrna gene sequences, rhizobium, mesorhizobium, and agrobacterium were further classified into six different genospecies: agrobacterium spp., agrobacterium radiobacter, rhizobium sp., rhizobium phaseoli, mesorhizobium sp., and putative new rhizobium species. the strains from r. phaseoli, rhizobium sp. iar30, and mesorhizobium sp. err6 induced nodules on their host plants. the other strains did not form nodules on their original host. nine endophytic bacterial strains representing seven genera, agrobacterium, burkholderia, paenibacillus, pantoea, pseudomonas, rhizobium, and serratia, were found to colonize nodules of crotalaria incana and common bean on co-inoculation with symbiotic rhizobia. four endophytic rhizobium and two agrobacterium strains had identical nifh gene sequences with symbiotic rhizobium strains, suggesting horizontal gene transfer.  most symbiotic and nonsymbiotic endophytic bacteria showed plant growth-promoting properties in vitro, which indicate their potential role in the promotion of plant growth when colonizing plant roots and the rhizosphere.

TI  == resistance and inactivation kinetics of bacterial strains isolated from the non-chlorinated and chlorinated effluents of a wwtp.
AB  == the microbiological quality of water from a wastewater treatment plant that uses  sodium hypochlorite as a disinfectant was assessed. mesophilic aerobic bacteria were not removed efficiently. this fact allowed for the isolation of several bacterial strains from the effluents. molecular identification indicated that the strains were related to aeromonas hydrophila, escherichia coli (three strains), enterobacter cloacae, kluyvera cryocrescens (three strains), kluyvera intermedia, citrobacter freundii (two strains), bacillus sp. and enterobacter sp. the first five strains, which were isolated from the non-chlorinated effluent, were used to test resistance to chlorine disinfection using three sets of variables: disinfectant concentration (8, 20 and 30 mg.l(-1)), contact time (0, 15 and 30 min) and water temperature (20, 25 and 30 degrees c). the results demonstrated that the strains have independent responses to experimental conditions and that the most efficient treatment was an 8 mg.l(-1) dose of disinfectant at a temperature of 20 degrees c for 30 min. the other eight strains, which were isolated from the chlorinated effluent, were used to analyze inactivation kinetics using the disinfectant at a dose of 15 mg.l(-1) with various retention times (0, 10, 20, 30, 60 and 90 min). the results indicated that during the inactivation process, there was no relationship between removal percentage and retention time and that the strains have no common response to the treatments.

TI  == diversity of the bacterial and fungal microflora from the midgut and cuticle of phlebotomine sand flies collected in north-western iran.
AB  == background: phlebotomine sand flies are the vectors of the leishmaniases, parasitic diseases caused by leishmania spp. little is known about the prevalence and diversity of sand fly microflora colonizing the midgut or the cuticle. particularly, there is little information on the fungal diversity. this information is important for development of vector control strategies. methodology/principal findings: five sand fly species: phlebotomus papatasi, p. sergenti, p. kandelakii, p. perfiliewi and p. halepensis were caught in bileh savar and kaleybar in north-western iran that are located in endemic foci of visceral leishmaniasis. a total of 35 specimens were processed. bacterial and fungal strains were identified by routine microbiological methods. we characterized 39 fungal isolates from the cuticle and/or the midgut. they belong  to six different genera including penicillium (17 isolates), aspergillus (14), acremonium (5), fusarium (1), geotrichum (1) and candida (1). we identified 33 gram-negative bacteria: serratia marcescens (9 isolates), enterobacter cloacae (6), pseudomonas fluorescens (6), klebsiella ozaenae (4), acinetobacter sp. (3),  escherichia coli (3), asaia sp. (1) and pantoea sp. (1) as well as gram-positive  bacteria bacillus subtilis (5) and micrococcus luteus (5) in 10 isolates. conclusion/significance: our study provides new data on the microbiotic diversity of field-collected sand flies and for the first time, evidence of the presence of asaia sp. in sand flies. we have also found a link between physiological stages (unfed, fresh fed, semi gravid and gravid) of sand flies and number of bacteria that they carry. interestingly pantoea sp. and klebsiella ozaenae have been isolated in old world sand fly species. the presence of latter species on sand fly cuticle and in the female midgut suggests a role for this arthropod in dissemination of these pathogenic bacteria in endemic areas. further experiments  are required to clearly delineate the vectorial role (passive or active) of sand  flies.

AB  == an investigation of bacterial diversity in compost was performed using molecular  chronometer in order to reveal its phylogeny. thirty-three bacterial isolates isolated from compost were analyzed by 16s rrna gene sequencing which revealed phylogenetic lineage of class bacilli, gamma, beta-proteobacteria, and actinobacteria. among these lineages, isolates belonging to class bacilli consisted of species from genera staphylococcus, bacillus, terribacillus, and lysinibacillus. from phylum actinobacteria: microbacterium barkeri and kocuria sp. were identified. other bacterial groups had phylogenetic linkage with genera  comamonas and acidovorax (class beta-proteobacteria); serratia, klebsiella, and enterobacter (class gamma-proteobacteria). similar isolates were analyzed through ardra. amplified product of 16s rrna gene from each isolates was subjected to cleavage by enzymes hpaii, hinfi, and mspi in separate reaction tubes. hpaii generated 2-6 bands ranging from 90-688 bp, hinfi generated 2-5 bands of 71-1,038 bp, and mspi 2-7 bands of 69-793 bp. the restriction patterns from hpaii, hinfi,  and mspi were normalized separately and combined by means of pattern recognition  software "diversity database." hpaii had highest discrimination index (0.72) than hinfi (0.68) and mspi (0.65), and the combination of all three showed discrimination index (0.69). numerical analysis of ardra patterns demonstrated sufficient phylogenetic information for characterizing bacterial diversity. phylogenetic relationship obtained among isolates through ardra was compared with 16s rrna gene sequence and ardra results showed sufficiently similar 16s rrna gene sequence analysis, but not an overlapping. it has been observed that ardra technique facilitates the identification of bacteria in less than 36 h as compared to traditional 16s rrna gene sequencing.

TI  == bacterial superinfection in zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis.
AB  == background: zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis (zcl) is a polymorphic disease. it is generally accepted that bacterial superinfection may play a role in the clinical appearance of the lesions and may delay or prevent the healing process.  however, the pattern of bacterial pathogens involved has rarely been investigated. material/methods: the aim of this study was to identify the bacterial species contaminating the suspected zcl and their susceptibility to commonly used antibiotics. microscopic examination of stained smears and cultures were used to differentiate zcl from non-zcl lesions in a rural area north of isfahan, iran from july to december 2009. bacteria were isolated from the lesions and identified and antibiotic susceptibility was determined by standard microbiological techniques. results: the results show that 602 (68%) of 855 patients were positive for zcl, of which 83.4% with volcano-shape, 8.8% psoriasiform, 6.6% popular form and 1.2% with other atypical forms of zcl. the bacteria were isolated from 66.8% of zcl (70% of volcano-shape, 60% of psoriasiform and 25% of popular form) and 64.7% of non-zcl lesions. the most common species were staphylococcus aureus (41.7%) and s. epidermidis (28%) followed by bacillus sp. streptococcus pyogenes, escherichia coli, klebsiella sp., proteus sp., enterobacter sp. and pseudomonas aeroginosa. ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, cefazolin and clindamycin were the most effective antibiotics. conclusions: bacterial superinfection appears to be very common in zcl, but its prevalence is not different from that of non-zcl lesions and it has little effect on the clinical appearance of anthroponotic cutaneous leishmaniasis (acl). local  lesion care and management of bacterial superinfection must be considered in the  treatment of zcl.

AB  == aims: to elucidate the cause of high variations and inconsistencies in bacterial  cfu observed within and between different experiments while assessing viable bacterial counts through spread plating (sp). methods and results: following the  inconsistent results, cfu estimations were undertaken through conventional sp using the spreader, or a modified approach that did not use spreader employing four organisms. the latter approach involving spotting-and-tilt-spreading of inoculum on agar surface [spotting spreading (ss)] yielded higher cfu by 11-120%  over the weighted average depending on the organism and diluent. the adverse effect owing to the spreader was the most obvious in escherichia coli followed by staphylococcus epidermidis, enterobacter cloacae and bacillus pumilus. plate attributes that determined the surface moisture levels of agar medium and the spreading practice adopted by the personnel formed two other major influencing factors. plating for shorter periods (<60 s) using fresh 15/20 ml plates caused loss of 3-12% cfu owing to inoculum adhesion to spreader irrespective of glass or polypropylene make. on the other hand, prolonging the plating brought down the cfu significantly. spreader movement on agar surface subsequent to the exhaustion of free moisture, which was marked by the experiencing of some friction to smooth spreader movement, was detrimental to vegetative cells, while bacillus spores were less affected. conclusions: the study brings out that the way sp is carried  out exerts significant effects on cfu influenced by plate conditions. prolonged use of spreader on dry agar surface could be highly detrimental to bacterial cells. a mild use of spreader accounting for spreader-adhering inoculum or the practice of ss not involving the spreader is recommended. significance and impact of the study: this study unravels the effects owing to the spreader on bacterial  cells and the cfu and recommends an alternate approach of ss to minimize cfu inconsistencies and to maximize the viable bacterial counts.

TI  == application of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis to microbial diversity analysis in chinese douchi.
AB  == background: douchi is a traditional chinese soybean food which has been consumed  for thousands years as an important protein source and flavouring ingredient. studies have rarely been carried out to investigate its microbial composition and these are urgently required for the commercial labels and safety considerations.  results: microbial counts were statistically significant different among douchi samples. although the maximum diversity indexes of bacterial, bacillus and fungal polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge) patterns were only 79%, 70% and 64%, some microorganisms, e.g. bacillus subtilis, bacillus amyloliquefaciens, pseudomonas sp., saccharomyces cerevisiae and pichia  farinose, were found to share dominant positions in most douchi samples. in addition, some pathogens, e.g. staphylococcus saprophyticus, pantoea sp., staphylococcus sciuri, enterobacter sp. and staphylococcus sp., were also identified. conclusion: the pcr-dgge technique was used for the first time as an  effective method to assess the microbial communities in different chinese douchi  samples. this information may be useful in improving the product quality, reformatting production methods, extending shelf life and scaling up the fermentation process.

TI  == biodegradation of organic compounds of molasses melanoidin (mm) from biomethanated distillery spent wash (bmds) during the decolourisation by a potential bacterial consortium.
AB  == molasses melanoidin (mm) is a major pollutant in biomethanated distillery spent wash (bmds) due to its recalcitrant properties. the 75% colour and 71% cod of mm  (1,000 ppm) were reduced with developed bacterial consortium comprising proteus mirabilis (iitrm5; fj581028), bacillus sp. (iitrm7; fj581030), raoultella planticola (iitrm15; gu329705) and enterobacter sakazakii (iitrm16, fj581031) in  the ratio of 4:3:2:1 within 10 days at optimized nutrient. bacterial consortium showed manganese peroxidase and laccase activity during mm decolourisation. the dominant growth of r. planticola and e. sakazakii was noted in consortium during  mm decolourisation. the comparative gc-ms analysis of extracted compounds of control and degraded samples showed that most of the compounds present in control were completely utilized by bacterial consortium along with production of some metabolites. the developed bacterial consortium could be a tool for the decolourisation and degradation of melanoidin containing bmds.

TI  == host plant induced variation in gut bacteria of helicoverpa armigera.
AB  == helicoverpa are important polyphagous agricultural insect pests and they have a worldwide distribution. in this study, we report the bacterial community structure in the midgut of fifth instar larvae of helicoverpa armigera, a species prevalent in the india, china, south asia, south east asia, southern & eastern africa and australia. using culturable techniques, we isolated and identified members of bacillus firmus, bacillus niabense, paenibacillus jamilae, cellulomonas variformis, acinetobacter schindleri, micrococcus yunnanesis, enterobacter sp., and enterococcus cassiliflavus in insect samples collected from host plants grown in different parts of india. besides these the presence of sphingomonas, ralstonia, delftia, paracoccus and bacteriodetes was determined by  culture independent molecular analysis. we found that enterobacter and enterococcus were universally present in all our helicoverpa samples collected from different crops and in different parts of india. the bacterial diversity varied greatly among insects that were from different host plants than those from the same host plant of different locations. this result suggested that the type of host plant greatly influences the midgut bacterial diversity of h. armigera, more than the location of the host plant. on further analyzing the leaf from which the larva was collected, it was found that the h. armigera midgut bacterial community was similar to that of the leaf phyllosphere. this finding indicates that the bacterial flora of the larval midgut is influenced by the leaf surface bacterial community of the crop on which it feeds. additionally, we found that laboratory made media or the artificial diet is a poor bacterial source for these insects compared to a natural diet of crop plant.

TI  == culture-based and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis of the bacterial community structure from the intestinal tracts of earthworms(eisenia fetida).
AB  == the bacterial communities in the intestinal tracts of earthworm were investigated by culture-dependent and - independent approaches. in total, 72 and 55 pure cultures were isolated from the intestinal tracts of earthworms under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, respectively. aerobic bacteria were classified as aeromonas (40%), bacillus (37%), photobacterium (10%), pseudomonas (7%), and shewanella (6%). anaerobic bacteria were classified as aeromonas (52%), bacillus (27%), shewanella (12%), paenibacillus (5%), clostridium (2%), and cellulosimicrobium (2%). the dominant microorganisms were aeromonas and bacillus species under both  aerobic and anaerobic conditions. in all, 39 dna fragments were identified by polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge) analysis. aeromonas sp. was the dominant microorganism in feeds, intestinal tracts, and casts of earthworms. the dgge band intensity of aeromonas from feeds, intestinal tracts, and casts of earthworms was 12.8%, 14.7%, and 15.1%, respectively. the other strains identified were bacillus, clostridium, enterobacter, photobacterium, pseudomonas, shewanella, streptomyces, uncultured chloroflexi bacterium, and uncultured bacterium. these results suggest that pcr-dgge analysis was more efficient than the culture-dependent approach for the  investigation of bacterial diversity and the identification of unculturable microorganisms.

TI  == effects of stimulation of copper bioleaching on microbial community in vineyard soil and copper mining waste.
AB  == long-term copper application in vineyards and copper mining activities cause heavy metal pollution sites. such sites need remediation to protect soil and water quality. bioremediation of contaminated areas through bioleaching can help  to remove copper ions from the contaminated soils. thus, the aim of this work was to evaluate the effects of different treatments for copper bioleaching in two diverse copper-contaminated soils (a 40-year-old vineyard and a copper mining waste) and to evaluate the effect on microbial community by applying denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) of 16s ribosomal dna amplicons and dna sequence analysis. several treatments with hcl, h(2)so(4), and feso(4) were evaluated by stimulation of bioleaching of copper in the soils. treatments and extractions using feso(4) and h(2)so(4) mixture at 30 degrees c displayed more copper leaching than extractions with deionized water at room temperature. treatment with h(2)so(4) supported bioleaching of as much as 120 mg kg(-1) of copper from vineyard soil after 115 days of incubation. dgge analysis of the treatments revealed that some treatments caused greater diversity of microorganisms in the vineyard soil compared to the copper mining waste. nucleotide blast of pcr-amplified fragments of 16s rrna gene bands from dgge indicated the presence of rhodobacter sp., silicibacter sp., bacillus sp., paracoccus sp., pediococcus sp., a myxococcales, clostridium sp., thiomonas sp.,  a firmicute, caulobacter vibrioides, serratia sp., and an actinomycetales in vineyard soil. contrarily, sphingomonas was the predominant genus in copper mining waste in most treatments. paracoccus sp. and enterobacter sp. were also identified from dgge bands of the copper mining waste. paracoccus species is involved in the copper bioleaching by sulfur oxidation system, liberating the copper bounded in the soils and hence promoting copper bioremediation. results indicate that stimulation of bioleaching with a combination of feso(4) and h(2)so(4) promoted bioleaching in the soils and can be employed ex situ to remediate copper-impacted soils.

TI  == a multiphasic approach for the identification of endophytic bacterial in strawberry fruit and their potential for plant growth promotion.
AB  == this study used a multiphasic approach, characterized by the simultaneous use of  culture-dependent and culture-independent methods, to investigate endophytic bacterial communities in strawberry (fragaria ananassa) fruit. a total of 92 bacterial endophytes were isolated and initially grouped by their repetitive extragenic palindromic (rep)-pcr banding pattern and biochemical features. phylogenetic analysis of the 16s rrna gene sequences of 45 representatives showed that the isolates belonged to the species bacillus subtilis (eight isolates), bacillus sp. (seven isolates), enterobacter sp. (seven isolates), enterobacter ludwigii (six isolates), lactobacillus plantarum (six isolates), pseudomonas sp.  (five isolates), pantoea punctata (three isolates), and curtobacterium citreum (three isolates). nucleic acids were extracted from the strawberry fruit and subjected to 16s rrna gene directed polymerase chain reaction denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (16s rrna pcr-dgge). the species b. subtilis, enterobacter sp., and pseudomonas sp. were detected both by isolation and dgge. the dgge fingerprints of total bacterial dna did not exhibit bands corresponding to several of the representative species isolated in the extinction dilution (l. plantarum, c. citreum, and p. punctata). in contrast, bands in the dgge profile that were identified as relatives of arthrobacter sp. and one uncultivable erythrobacter sp. were not recovered by cultivation techniques. after isolation,  the nitrogen fixation ability and the in vitro production of indole-3-acetic acid (iaa) equivalents and siderophores were evaluated. a high percentage of isolates  were found to possess the ability to produce siderophores and iaa equivalents; however, only a few isolates belonging to the genera pseudomonas and enterobacter showed the ability to fix nitrogen. plant growth promotion was evaluated under greenhouse conditions and revealed the ability of the bacillus strains to enhance the number of leaves, shoot length, root dry weight, and shoot dry weight. the activity of the bacterial isolate identified as b. subtilis na-108 exerted the greatest influence on strawberry growth and showed a 42.8% increase in number of  leaves, 15.26% for high shoot, 43.5% increase in root dry weight, and a 77% increase in shoot dry weight when compared with untreated controls.

AB  == degradation of the fungicide thiophanate-methyl (tm) by enterobacter sp. tds-1 and bacillus sp. tds-2 isolated from sandy soil previously treated with tm was studied in mineral salt medium (msm) and soil. both strains were able to grow in  msm supplemented with tm (50 mg l(-1)) as the sole carbon source. over a 16 days  incubation period, 60 and 77% of the initial dose of tm were degraded by strains  tds-1 and tds-2, respectively, and disappearance of tm was described by first-order kinetics. medium supplementation with glucose markedly stimulated bacterial growth; while the final rate of tm degradation was reduced by 21 and 27% for strains tds-1 and tds-2, respectively as compared to medium with tm only. moreover, this additional carbon source changed the tm degradation kinetics, which proceeded according to a zero-order model. this effect was linked to substrate competition and/or a strong decrease of medium ph. isolates degraded tm (100 mg kg(-1)) in soil with rate constants of 0.186 and 0.210 day(-1), following first-order rate kinetics, and the time in which the initial tm concentration was reduced by 50% (dt50) in soils inoculated with strains tds-1 and tds-2 were 6.3 and 5.1 days, respectively. analysis of tm degradation products in soil showed that the tested strains may have the potential to transform carbendazim (mbc) to  2-aminobenzimidazole (2-ab), and may be useful for a bioremediation of mbc-polluted soils.

TI  == interaction and nanotoxic effect of zno and ag nanoparticles on mesophilic and halophilic bacterial cells.
AB  == the toxicity of two commonly used nanoparticles, silver and zinc oxide on mesophilic and halophilic bacterial cells has been investigated. enterobacter sp., marinobacter sp., bacillus subtilis, halophilic bacterium sp. emb4, were taken as model systems. the nanotoxicity was more pronounced on gram negative bacteria. zno nanoparticles reduced the growth of enterobacter sp. by 50%, while  80% reduction was observed in halophilic marinobacter sp. in case of halophiles,  this may be attributed to higher content of negatively charged cardiolipins on their cell surface. interestingly, bulk zno exerted minimal reduction in growth.  ag nanoparticles were similarly cytotoxic. nanotoxicity towards gram positive cells was significantly less, possibly due to presence of thicker peptidoglycan layer. the bacterium nanoparticle interactions were probed by electron microscopy and energy dispersive x-ray analysis. the results indicated electrostatic interactions between nanoparticles and cell surface as the primary step towards nanotoxicity, followed by cell morphological changes, increase in membrane permeability and their accumulation in the cytoplasm.

AB  == culture-independent techniques were used for the detection of pathogenic bacteria in drinking water at potentially critical control points along the production lines at a german dairy company and a spanish dry cured ham company. denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) was used to describe bacterial population shifts indicating biological instability in the drinking water samples. autochthonous bacteria were identified by sequencing the excised dgge dna bands.  more specifically, real-time pcr was applied to detect a number of pathogenic bacteria, i.e. listeria monocytogenes, mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis, campylobacter jejuni, enterococcus spp., salmonella spp, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. due to the detection limits of the  real-time pcr method, a specific protocol was established in order to meet the technical detection requirements and to avoid unwanted polymerase inhibitions. autochthonous bacterial populations were found to be highly stable at most of the sampling points. only one sampling point exhibited population shifts at the german dairy company. enterococci and p.aeruginosa were detected in some water samples from these companies by molecular biology detection methods, but not by conventional culturing methods. some opportunistic bacteria as enterobacter sp.,  acinetobacter, sphingomonas sp. and non-pathogenic bacillus, were also detected after dna sequencing of dgge bands.

TI  == bisphenol a removal by the dracaena plant and the role of plant-associating bacteria.
AB  == dracaena sanderiana and dracaena fragrans plants, as representatives of native, tropical, evergreen plants with fibrous root systems, were evaluated for bisphenol a (bpa) tolerance and uptake capability. d. sanderiana demonstrated significantly higher bpa removal capability than d. fragrans. therefore, it was chosen for further study. d. sanderiana tolerated bpa toxicity levels up to 80 microm, while higher bpa concentrations damaged the plant. in the sterile hydroponic system with an initial bpa concentration of 20 microm, the plant could uptake approximately 50% of the bpa. the plant's ability to translocate bpa was confirmed by the detection of bpa that accumulated at the roots and stems, but not at the leaves of the plant. upon bpa exposure, the d. sanderiana secreted extracellular plant mucilage as a protective barrier to the toxic compound. in the non-sterile treatment, the bpa dissipation was contributed not only by the d. sanderiana plant, but also by the co-existing microbes. the bpa reached 85% of the initial concentration at 20 microm. among the six plant-associating bacterial isolates, bacillus cereus strain bpw4 and enterobacter sp. strain bpw5 colonized  the d. sanderiana root surface and facilitated bpa dissipation in the hydroponic  treatment system. in addition, the success of the bpa treatment in the hazardous  waste landfill leachate demonstrated the potential application of d. sanderiana plant in the phytoremediation of bpa contaminated wastewater or industrial leachate.

TI  == physiological adaptations and tolerance towards higher concentration of selenite  (se(+4)) in enterobacter sp. ar-4, bacillus sp. ar-6 and delftia tsuruhatensis ar-7.
AB  == environmental contamination with selenium is a major health concern. a few bacterial strains have been isolated that can transform toxic selenite to non-toxic elemental selenium only at low concentrations (0.001-150 mm) in recent  past. we have previously reported isolation and characterization of few selenite-tolerant bacterial strains. these strains were found to be resistant to  selenite at (300-600 mm) concentrations. in the present study we have characterized some physiological adaptations of strains enterobacter sp. ar-4, bacillus sp. ar-6 and delftia tsuruhatensis ar-7 during exposure to higher concentration of selenite under aerobic and anaerobic environments. adaptive responses are largely associated with alteration of cell morphology and change in total cellular fatty acid composition. interestingly, electron microscopy studies revealed substantial decrease in cell size and intracellular deposition of se(0)  crystals when reduction is carried out under aerobic conditions. on the other hand, cell size increased with adhesion of se(0) on cell surface during anaerobic reduction. fatty acid composition analysis demonstrated selective increase in saturated and cyclic fatty acids and decrease in unsaturated ones during aerobic  transformation. changes observed during anaerobic transformation were in surprising contrast as indicated by total absence of saturated and cyclic fatty acids. results presented here provide evidences for putative occurrence of two distinct mechanisms involved in tolerance towards higher concentrations of selenite utilization under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. further, prior exposure to higher concentration of se(+4) enabled rapid adaptation indicating role of inducible system in adaptation.

TI  == effect of plant age on endophytic bacterial diversity of balloon flower (platycodon grandiflorum) root and their antimicrobial activities.
AB  == balloon flower (platycodon grandiflorum) is widely cultivated vegetable and used  as a remedy for asthma in east asia. experiments were conducted to isolate endophytic bacteria from 1-, 3-, and 6-year-old balloon flower roots and to analyze the enzymatic, antifungal, and anti-human pathogenic activities of the potential endophytic biocontrol agents obtained. total 120 bacterial colonies were isolated from the interior of all balloon flower roots samples. phylogenetic analysis based on 16s rrna gene sequences showed that the population of 'low g +  c gram-positive bacteria' (lgcgpb) gradually increased 60.0-80.0% from 1 to 6 years balloon flower sample. on the other hand, maximum hydrolytic enzyme activity showing endophytic bacteria was under lgcgpb, among the bacterial strains, bacillus sp. (bf1-1 and bf3-8), bacillus sp. (bf1-2 and bf3-5), and bacillus sp. (bf1-3, bf3-6, and bf6-4) showed maximum enzyme activities. besides, bacillus licheniformis (bf3-5 and bf6-6) and bacillus pumilus (bf6-1) showed maximum antifungal activity against phytophthora capsici, fusarium oxysporum, rhizoctonia solani, and pythium ultimum. moreover, bacillus licheniformis was found in 3 and 6 years balloon flower roots, but bacillus pumilus was found only  in 6 years sample. it is presumed that older balloon flower plants invite more potential antifungal endophytes for there protection from plant diseases. in addition, bacillus sp. (bf1-2 and bf3-5) showed maximum anti-human pathogenic activity. so, plant age is presumed to influence diversity of balloon flower endophytic bacteria.

TI  == application of real-time pcr, dgge fingerprinting, and culture-based method to evaluate the effectiveness of intrinsic bioremediation on the control of petroleum-hydrocarbon plume.
AB  == real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr), denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge), and the culture-based method were applied in the intrinsic bioremediation study at a petroleum-hydrocarbon contaminated site. the  genes of phenol hydroxylase (phe), ring-hydroxylating toluene monooxygenase (rmo), naphthalene dioxygenase (nah), toluene monooxygenase (tol), toluene dioxygenase (tod), and biphenyl dioxygenase (bph4) were quantified by real-time pcr. results show that phe gene was detected in groundwater contaminated with benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene isomers (btex) and methyl tert-butyl ether (mtbe), and this indicates that intrinsic bioremediation occurred at this contaminated site. results from dgge analyses reveal that the petroleum-hydrocarbon plume caused the variation in microbial communities. in this study, mtbe degraders including pseudomonas sp. nknu01, bacillus sp. nknu01, klebsiella sp. nknu01, enterobacter sp. nknu01, and enterobacter sp. nknu02 were  isolated from the contaminated groundwater using the cultured-based method. results from mtbe biodegradation experiment show that the isolated bacteria were  affected by propane. this indicates that propane may influence the metabolic pathway of mtbe by these bacteria. knowledge and comprehension obtained from this study will be helpful in evaluating the occurrence and effectiveness of intrinsic bioremediation on the remediation of petroleum-hydrocarbon contaminated groundwater.

TI  == growth and gaseous emissions of pure and mixed small intestinal bacterial cultures: effects of bile and vancomycin.
AB  == simultaneous cultivations in anaerobiosis, aerobiosis and with microaerobic gas mixture were used to clarify the bile (oxgall) effects on the pure and mixed cultures of enterobacterial strains in simulations in portable microbe enrichment unit (pmeu) linked with chempro100i((r)) gas detector. the effects of vancomycin  were evaluated in aerobic cultures. growth and metabolic activity of cultures were also followed by measuring sugar consumption, ph alterations, and colony counts on bd chromagar orientation plates. results showed that the two fermentatively different strains of facultative anaerobes, escherichia coli e 17  and klebsiella mobilis atcc 13048 grew in balance regardless of oxygen level, bile acid concentration or other components of the mixed cultures, bacillus cereus or staphylococcus aureus. when the evaporations of the mixed cultures of e. coli, k. mobilis and s. aureus were compared with the emissions of the corresponding pure cultures by chempro100i((r)) gas sensing detector, the pure cultures of bile resistant e. coli and k. mobilis produced more gaseous components than the mixed culture indicating that these organisms cooperate and use the substrate more effectively together than separately. a survey of the aseptic bacterial isolations from the bile tract in a big university hospital, (salzburg, austria) during 3 years, showed that these bacterial groups dominated. only 13.24% of the 287 patient samples were sterile, and around 180 strains of both e. coli and klebsiella/enterobacter groups were found amongst 973 isolates from 249 patients (together 35.57%). enterococcus sp. accounted for 246 isolates  being the largest group of strains (24.25% of all the isolates). in anaerobiosis  it was shown that klebsiella neutralized the acids produced in the mixed acid fermentation of the e. coli. the ethanol produced from both groups evaporated in  the gas stream of the pmeu culturing step and its formation also removes excess acidity from the cultures. the synergistic behaviour and symbiotic function between e. coli and klebsiella/enterobacter strains is suggested.

TI  == a mid-gut microbiota is not required for the pathogenicity of bacillus thuringiensis to diamondback moth larvae.
AB  == the mode of action of the entomopathogenic bacterium bacillus thuringiensis (bt)  remains a matter of debate. recent reports have claimed that aseptic lepidopteran hosts were not susceptible to bt and that inoculation with mid-gut bacteria restores pathogenicity. these claims are controversial because larvae were rendered aseptic by consuming antibiotics, although the effect of these antibiotics on bt was not examined. we tested the generality of the mid-gut bacteria hypothesis in the diamondback moth, plutella xylostella using properly controlled experiments that investigated the effect of antibiotic consumption and absence of gut microbiota separately. we found that purified bt toxin and spore/toxin mixtures were fully pathogenic to larvae reared aseptically. persistence of antibiotics in larval tissues was implicated in reducing host mortality because larval consumption of the antibiotic rifampicin reduced the pathogenicity of rifampicin-sensitive bt strains but not rifampicin-resistant strains. inoculating larvae with enterobacter sp. mn2 reduced the mortality of larvae feeding on bt hd-1 and the presence of a culturable gut microbiota also reduced the pathogenicity of the bt toxin cry1ac, in agreement with other studies indicating that an intestinal microbiota can protect taxonomically diverse hosts  from pathogen attack. as ingestion of antibiotics suppresses host mortality the vegetative growth of bt in the host must be important for its pathogenicity. furthermore, claims that aseptic larvae are not susceptible to bt must be supported by experiments that control for the effect of administering antibiotics.

AB  == the genetic diversity of siderophore-producing bacteria of tobacco rhizosphere was studied by amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis (ardra), 16s rrna sequence homology and phylogenetics analysis methods. studies demonstrated that 85% of the total 354 isolates produced siderophores in iron limited liquid medium. a total of 28 ardra patterns were identified among the 299 siderophore-producing bacterial isolates. the 28 ardra patterns represented bacteria of 14 different genera belonging to six bacterial divisions, namely beta-, gamma-, alpha-proteobacteria, sphingobacteria, bacilli, and actinobacteria. especially, gamma-proteobacteria consisting of pseudomonas, enterobacter, serratia, pantoea, erwinia and stenotrophomonas genus encountered 18 different ardra groups. results also showed a greater siderophore-producing bacterial diversity than previous researches. for example, sphingobacterium (isolates g-2-21-1 and g-2-27-2), pseudomonas poae (isolate g-2-1-1), enterobacter endosymbiont (isolates g-2-10-2 and n-5-10), delftia acidovorans (isolate g-1-15), and achromobacter xylosoxidans (isolates n-46-11hh and n-5-20)  were reported to be able to produce siderophores under low-iron conditions for the first time. gram-negative isolates were more frequently encountered, with more than 95% total frequency. for gram-positive bacteria, the bacillus and rhodococcus were the only two genera, with 1.7% total frequency. furthermore, the pseudomonas and enterobacter were dominant in this environment, with 44.5% and 24.7% total frequency, respectively. it was also found that 75 percent of the isolates that had the high percentages of siderophore units (% between 40 and 60) belonged to pseudomonas. pseudomonas sp. g-229-21 screened out in this study may  have potential to apply to low-iron soil to prevent plant soil-borne fungal pathogen diseases.

TI  == contributions of gut bacteria to bacillus thuringiensis-induced mortality vary across a range of lepidoptera.
AB  == background: gut microbiota contribute to the health of their hosts, and alterations in the composition of this microbiota can lead to disease. previously, we demonstrated that indigenous gut bacteria were required for the insecticidal toxin of bacillus thuringiensis to kill the gypsy moth, lymantria dispar. b. thuringiensis and its associated insecticidal toxins are commonly used for the control of lepidopteran pests. a variety of factors associated with the insect host, b. thuringiensis strain, and environment affect the wide range of susceptibilities among lepidoptera, but the interaction of gut bacteria with these factors is not understood. to assess the contribution of gut bacteria to b. thuringiensis susceptibility across a range of lepidoptera we examined larval mortality of six species in the presence and absence of their indigenous gut bacteria. we then assessed the effect of feeding an enteric bacterium isolated from l. dispar on larval mortality following ingestion of b. thuringiensis toxin. results: oral administration of antibiotics reduced larval mortality due to b. thuringiensis in five of six species tested. these included vanessa cardui (l.),  manduca sexta (l.), pieris rapae (l.) and heliothis virescens (f.) treated with a formulation composed of b. thuringiensis cells and toxins (dipel), and lymantria  dispar (l.) treated with a cell-free formulation of b. thuringiensis toxin (mvpii). antibiotics eliminated populations of gut bacteria below detectable levels in each of the insects, with the exception of h. virescens, which did not  have detectable gut bacteria prior to treatment. oral administration of the gram-negative enterobacter sp. nab3, an indigenous gut resident of l. dispar, restored larval mortality in all four of the species in which antibiotics both reduced susceptibility to b. thuringiensis and eliminated gut bacteria, but not in h. virescens. in contrast, ingestion of b. thuringiensis toxin (mvpii) following antibiotic treatment significantly increased mortality of pectinophora  gossypiella (saunders), which was also the only species with detectable gut bacteria that lacked a gram-negative component. further, mortality of p. gossypiella larvae reared on diet amended with b. thuringiensis toxin and enterobacter sp. nab3 was generally faster than with b. thuringiensis toxin alone. conclusion: this study demonstrates that in some larval species, indigenous gut bacteria contribute to b. thuringiensis susceptibility. moreover,  the contribution of enteric bacteria to host mortality suggests that perturbations caused by toxin feeding induce otherwise benign gut bacteria to exert pathogenic effects. the interaction between b. thuringiensis and the gut microbiota of lepidoptera may provide a useful model with which to identify the factors involved in such transitions.

(l16) produced an increase of lag phase of growth and decreased a growth rate of  all fungal strains. these isolates were selected for futher studies. in vitro non-rhizospheric maize soil (centrally and sprayed inoculated) and in vitro maize (ears apex and base inoculated) were treated with antagonistics and pathogenic strains alone in co-inoculated cultures. bacillus amyloliquefaciens significantly reduced f. verticillioides and a. flavus count in maize soil inoculated centrally. kluyveromyces sp. l16 reduced f. verticillioides and a. flavus count in maize soil inoculated by spray. kluyveromyces sp. l16 was the most effective treatment limiting percent infections by f. verticillioides on the maize ears.

TI  == growth, encystment and survival of acanthamoeba castellanii grazing on different  bacteria.
AB  == free-living amoebae of the genus acanthamoeba are widely distributed in soil and  water collections, where trophozoites (vegetative, multiplicative stages) feed mainly by phagocytosis and thus control bacterial populations in the environment. here, we examined the growth, encystment and survival of acanthamoeba castellanii receiving different bacteria (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter cloacae, bacillus subtilis, bacillus megaterium, micrococcus luteus, and staphylococcus aureus) in nonnutrient saline. all bacteria assayed induced a  dose-dependent proliferative response, in most cases maximized with a bacterial dose of 1 x 10(9) ml(-1); except for m. luteus, trophozoites grew better with viable than with heat-killed bacteria. in addition, acanthamoeba growth was improved by adding bacteria on alternate days. single-dose experiments indicated  a temporal association between the growth of trophozoite and bacterial consumption, and higher consumption of m. luteus, e. coli and p. aeruginosa, bacterial species that allowed the highest trophozoite yields. long-term acanthamoeba-bacteria incubation revealed that encystment was significantly delayed by almost all the bacteria assayed (including s. aureus, which elicited a poor growth response) and that the presence of bacteria markedly increased cyst yield; final cyst recovery clearly depended on both the dose and the type of the  bacterium given, being much higher with e. coli, m. luteus and p. aeruginosa.

AB  == the bacillus cereus group comprises a diverse array of non-pathogenic bacteria as well as pathogens such as bacillus thuringiensis. their spores are found together in soil and leaves and are therefore likely to commonly interact within hosts. mixed infections of pathogenic b. thuringiensis and non-pathogenic strains have been little studied, despite their potential impact on biological control and the evolutionary ecology of virulence. antibiotic secreting strains of b. cereus have been shown to be able to synergize b. thuringiensis (bt) infections. we explored  the ecology of these mixed infections more broadly in the diamondback moth (dbm). we tested whether antibiotic-expressing b. cereus can synergize bt infections initiated with spores, investigated whether ingestion of antibiotic-expressing b. cereus had any consequences for the larval gut flora and whether synergistic interactions with b. cereus increase bt reproduction. ingestion of high-antibiotic secreting b. cereus synergized infections of b. thuringiensis in  diamondback moth larvae, but at a lower level than previously reported. coinfection also increased slightly the number of bt spores found in cadavers. culture independent analysis of gut homogenates indicated that ingestion of an antibiotic-expressing strain of b. cereus reduced the abundance of the gut flora  and led to gut communities being dominated bacteria with dgge profiles very similar to pure b. cereus cultures. ingestion of b. cereus, regardless of genotype, reduced densities of an enteric isolate of enterobacter sp. these findings support the hypothesis that antibiotic secretion in the gut synergizes b. thuringiensis infections by reducing the abundance of the commensal gut flora  and facilitating invasion by bacteria in the b. cereus group.

TI  == hydrogen and polyhydroxybutyrate producing abilities of microbes from diverse habitats by dark fermentative process.
AB  == thirty five bacterial isolates from diverse environmental sources such as contaminated food, nitrogen rich soil, activated sludges from pesticide and oil refineries effluent treatment plants were found to belong to bacillus, bordetella, enterobacter, proteus, and pseudomonas sp. on the basis of 16s rrna gene sequence analysis. under dark fermentative conditions, maximum hydrogen (h(2)) yields (mol/mol of glucose added) were recorded to be 0.68 with enterobacter aerogenes egu16 followed by 0.63 with bacillus cereus egu43 and bacillus thuringiensis egu45. h(2) constituted 63-69% of the total biogas evolved. out of these 35 microbes, 18 isolates had the ability to produce polyhydroxybutyrate (phb), which varied up to 500 mg/l of medium, equivalent to a yield of 66.6%. the highest phb yield was recorded with b. cereus strain egu3. nine strains had high hydrolytic activities (zone of hydrolysis): lipase (34-38 mm) -bacillus sphaericus strains egu385, egu399 and egu542; protease (56-62 mm) -bacillus sp. strains egu444, egu447 and egu445; amylase (23 mm) -b. thuringiensis egu378, marine bacterium strain egu409 and pseudomonas sp. strain egu448. these strains with high hydrolytic activities had relatively low h(2) producing abilities in the range of 0.26-0.42 mol/mol of glucose added and only b. thuringiensis strain egu378 had the ability to produce phb. this is the first  report among the non-photosynthetic microbes, where the same organism(s) -b. cereus strain egu43 and b. thuringiensis strain egu45, have been shown to produce h(2) - 0.63 mol/mol of glucose added and phb - 420-435 mg/l medium.

TI  == bacterial contamination of random-donor platelets in a university hospital in the midwestern region of brazil.
AB  == background: bacterial blood contamination was probably the first recognized transfusion-transmitted disease. although the transfusion-associated bacterial sepsis has been known for a long time, it remains an important health problem. at present it is the most frequently reported cause of infectious transfusion-related fatalities. the aims of the study were to determine the prevalence of microbiologic contamination in random-donor platelets (rdps) and to identify the isolated microorganism obtained from a brazilian university hemotherapy service. study design and methods: a total of 2000 rdps were analyzed from november 2004 to june 2005. the time of storage of the platelet (plt) concentrates studied ranged from the day of donation (day 0) to the fifth day of  storage (day 5). the rdp cultures were initially performed in pools with bottles  containing brain heart infusion (bhi) growth medium, and cultures were incubated  aerobically at 37 degrees c for up to 7 days and subcultured onto chocolate agar  at 37 degrees c for 48 hours under conditions of microaerophilia. in the cases of positivity of one pool, the culture was individually performed for all the samples of that pool. results: eight units (0.4%; 95% confidence interval, 0.31-0.49) were found to be contaminated. isolated microorganisms were three acinetobacter lwoffii, one enterobacter intermedium, one serratia phymuthica, one staphylococcus haemolyticus, one staphylococcus hominis, and one bacillus sp. conclusion: plt concentrates were contaminated with bacteria in 0.4 percent of tested units, which represents a potential risk to patients and a public health problem. regarding the contaminant microorganisms, a predominance of gram-negative agents was observed (62.5%).

TI  == screening for anti-infective properties of several medicinal plants of the mauritians flora.
AB  == several plants of the mauritian flora alleged to possess anti-infective properties were studied against different strains of pathogenic bacteria and fungi. the grounded dried plant materials were extracted with different extractants and screened for anti-microbial activity using the disk diffusion and the micro-dilution techniques. preliminary screening revealed that the methanol extracts were most active. salmonella enteritidis, enterobacter cloacae and bacillus subtilis were the three test organisms, which were found to be susceptible to all the crude methanolic extracts of the different plants investigated (100% susceptibility), followed by escherichia coli (57.1%) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (57.1%), and staphylococcus aureus (28.6%). the lowest minimum inhibitory concentration recorded for the different crude methanol extracts against staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, salmonella enteritidis, enterobacter cloacae, bacillus subtilis and the mould fungus candida albicans were 500, 1000, 125, 250, 1000 and 125 micro g/ml, respectively. bioautography using cladosporium cucumerinum revealed that dichloromethane (dcm) extracts had the highest activity against the phytopathogenic fungus. it was also noted that the dcm extracts of michelia champaca and antidesma madagascariense yielded the maximum number of growth inhibiting compounds against cladosporium cucumerinum. activity of the different crude extracts was also investigated against several phytopathogenic filamentous fungi, colletotrichum glocosporoides, rhizoctonia solani, sclerotinia sclerotium, guignardia sp. and fusarium oxysporum. it was found that crude hexane extracts as well as crude dcm extracts exhibited marked activity against several strains of fungi, especially colletotrichum glocosporoides, sclerotinia sclerotium and guignardia sp.

TI  == midgut bacteria required for bacillus thuringiensis insecticidal activity.
AB  == bacillus thuringiensis is the most widely applied biological insecticide and is used to manage insects that affect forestry and agriculture and transmit human and animal pathogens. this ubiquitous spore-forming bacterium kills insect larvae largely through the action of insecticidal crystal proteins and is commonly deployed as a direct bacterial spray. moreover, plants engineered with the cry genes encoding the b. thuringiensis crystal proteins are the most widely cultivated transgenic crops. for decades, the mechanism of insect killing has been assumed to be toxin-mediated lysis of the gut epithelial cells, which leads  to starvation, or b. thuringiensis septicemia. here, we report that b. thuringiensis does not kill larvae of the gypsy moth in the absence of indigenous midgut bacteria. elimination of the gut microbial community by oral administration of antibiotics abolished b. thuringiensis insecticidal activity, and reestablishment of an enterobacter sp. that normally resides in the midgut microbial community restored b. thuringiensis-mediated killing. escherichia coli  engineered to produce the b. thuringiensis insecticidal toxin killed gypsy moth larvae irrespective of the presence of other bacteria in the midgut. however, when the engineered e. coli was heat-killed and then fed to the larvae, the larvae did not die in the absence of the indigenous midgut bacteria. e. coli and  the enterobacter sp. achieved high populations in hemolymph, in contrast to b. thuringiensis, which appeared to die in hemolymph. our results demonstrate that b. thuringiensis-induced mortality depends on enteric bacteria.

TI  == bacteria fauna from the house fly, musca domestica (l.).
AB  == the house fly, musca domestica has long been considered a potential agent for disease transmission ever since its existence. the general truth of this assertion remains undisputed till the present day in spite of increasing awareness toward an improved sanitation and better hygiene. the habitual movement of house fly from filthy substrata such as human faeces, animal excreta, carcasses, garbage, etc. makes them ideal candidates for disease transmission such as cholera, shigellosis, salmonellosis and others when settling on food. fly as a potential mechanical vector of pathogenic bacteria was elucidated in this study by examining flies from various breeding sites such as food courts, dumping ground, food processing areas and poultry farm in peninsular malaysia. the flies  were baited with 10% sugar solution on a glass slide in the field. all materials  used for collection of samples were sterile. bacteria from fly sample were isolated using the normal isolation technique. bacillus sp., coccobacillus sp., staphylococcus sp., microccus sp., streptococcus sp., acinetobacter sp., enterobacter sp., proteus sp., escherichia sp., klebsiella sp. and yeast cells were isolated from feaces, vomitus, external surfaces and internal organs of house fly. newly emerged house fly did not harbour any bacteria.

TI  == antifungal and antibacterial activities of mexican tarragon (tagetes lucida).
AB  == mexican tarragon (tagetes lucida cv. asteraceae: campanulatae) is an important, nutritious plant and an effective herbal medicine. seven coumarins, 7,8-dihydroxycoumarin (4), umbelliferone (7-hydroxycoumarin) (5), scoparone (6,7-dimethoxycoumarin) (7), esculetin (6,7-dihydroxycoumarin) (11), 6-hydroxy-7-methoxycoumarin (12), herniarin (7-methoxycoumarin) (13), and scopoletin (6-methoxy-7-hydroxycoumarin) (14), and three flavonoids, patuletin (18), quercetin (19), and quercetagetin (20), were isolated from ch2cl2 and meoh  extracts from aerial parts of t. lucida. in addition, 6,7-diacetoxy coumarin (15), 6-methoxy-7-acetylcoumarin (16), and 6-acetoxy-7-methoxycoumarin (17) derivatives were synthesized. 8-methoxypsoralen (1), 8-acetyl-7-hydroxycoumarin (2), 7,8-dihydroxy-6-meth-oxycoumarin (3), 6,7-dimethoxy-4-methylcoumarin (6), 5,7-dihydroxy-4-methylcoumarin (8), 4-hydroxycoumarin (9), 4-hydroxy-6,7-dimethylcoumarin (10), naringenin (21), glycoside-7-rhamnonaringin  (22), and rutin (23) were commercially obtained (sigma-aldrich). all of these compounds and extracts (m1 and m2) were assayed against bacteria and fungi. the antibacterial activity was determined on bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella typhi, salmonella sp., shigella boydii, shigella sp., enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter agglomerans,  sarcina lutea, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, yersinia enterolitica, vibrio cholerae (three el tor strains, cdc-v12, clinic case, and indre-206, were obtained from contaminated water), and v. cholerae (no-o1). the evaluated fungi were aspergillus niger, penicillium notatum, fusarium moniliforme, fusarium sporotrichum, rhizoctonia solani, and trichophyton mentagrophytes. the most active compounds against gram-positive and -negative bacteria were the dihydroxylated coumarins 3 and 4. in addition, 2-4, 6, 7, and 11 showed an interesting activity against v. cholerae, a key bacterium in the contaminated water; 2-4 were the most active. coumarins were the most effective compounds against gram-negative bacteria. the extract meoh/ch2cl2 (1: 4) m2 at 0.4 microg/disk inhibited the growth of e. coli and p. mirabilis (40%), k. pneumoniae (31.1%), salmonella sp. (35.5%), and shigella sp. (0%) at 72 h of culture. the dimethoxy compounds 6 and 7 showed a strong activity against fungal  strains, especially t. mentagrophytes and r. solani (100% of inhibition at 125.0  and 250.0 microg/ml, respectively).

TI  == improvement of arbuscular mycorrhiza development by inoculation of soil with phosphate-solubilizing rhizobacteria to improve rock phosphate bioavailability ((sup32)p) and nutrient cycling.
AB  == the interactive effect of phosphate-solubilizing bacteria and arbuscular mycorrhizal (am) fungi on plant use of soil p sources of low bioavailability (endogenous or added as rock phosphate [rp] material) was evaluated by using soil microcosms which integrated (sup32)p isotopic dilution techniques. the microbial  inocula consisted of the am fungus glomus intraradices and two phosphate-solubilizing rhizobacterial isolates: enterobacter sp. and bacillus subtilis. these rhizobacteria behaved as "mycorrhiza helper bacteria" promoting establishment of both the indigenous and the introduced am endophytes despite a gradual decrease in bacterial population size, which dropped from 10(sup7) at planting to 10(sup3) cfu g(sup-1) of dry rhizosphere soil at harvest. dual inoculation with g. intraradices and b. subtilis significantly increased biomass  and n and p accumulation in plant tissues. regardless of the rhizobacterium strain and of the addition of rp, am plants displayed lower specific activity ((sup32)p/(sup31)p) than their comparable controls, suggesting that the plants used p sources not available in their absence. the inoculated rhizobacteria may have released phosphate ions ((sup31)p), either from the added rp or from the less-available indigenous p sources, which were effectively taken up by the external am mycelium. soluble ca deficiency in the test soil may have benefited p solubilization. at least 75% of the p in dually inoculated plants derived from the added rp. it appears that these mycorrhizosphere interactions between bacterial and fungal plant associates contributed to the biogeochemical p cycling, thus promoting a sustainable nutrient supply to plants.

TI  == differential activity of a lectin from solieria filiformis against human pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == a lectin isolated from the red alga solieria filiformis was evaluated for its effect on the growth of 8 gram-negative and 3 gram-positive bacteria cultivated in liquid medium (three independent experiments/bacterium). the lectin (500 microg/ml) stimulated the growth of the gram-positive species bacillus cereus and inhibited the growth of the gram-negative species serratia marcescens, salmonella typhi, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, proteus sp, and pseudomonas aeruginosa at 1000 microg/ml but the lectin (10-1000 microg/ml) had no effect on  the growth of the gram-positive bacteria staphylococcus aureus and b. subtilis, or on the gram-negative bacteria escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium. the purified lectin significantly reduced the cell density of gram-negative bacteria, although no changes in growth phases (log, exponential and of decline) were observed. it is possible that the interaction of s. filiformis lectin with the cell surface receptors of gram-negative bacteria promotes alterations in the flow of nutrients, which would explain the bacteriostatic effect. growth stimulation of the gram-positive bacterium b. cereus was more marked in the presence of the lectin at a concentration of 1000 microg/ml. the stimulation of the growth of b.  cereus was not observed when the lectin was previously incubated with mannan (125 microg/ml), its hapten. thus, we suggest the involvement of the binding site of the lectin in this effect. the present study reports the first data on the inhibition and stimulation of pathogenic bacterial cells by marine alga lectins.

TI  == identification of novel eubacteria from spent mushroom compost (smc) waste by dna sequence typing: ecological considerations of disposal on agricultural land.
AB  == a small study was undertaken to examine the microbiological characteristics of spent mushroom compost (smc), which is the major waste by-product of the mushroom industry and which is regularly disposed off by application to agricultural land. the primary aim of this study was to examine smc for the presence of faecal bacterial pathogens, including campylobacter spp., salmonella spp. and listeria monocytogenes. secondly it was desirable to quantify bacterial and fungal populations within smc, and also qualitatively identify the diversity of bacterial populations within smc, through employment of rdna pcr and direct sequencing techniques on the culturable microflora. conventional microbiological  analyses of smc material (n=30) from six commercial operations in both northern ireland and the republic of ireland, failed to detect salmonella spp, listeria spp. or campylobacter spp. in any of the smc material examined. total aerobic plate counts gave a mean count of log10 7.01 colony forming units (cfu) per gram  smc material (range: log10 6.53-7.52 cfu/g). fungal counts gave a mean count of log(10) 4.57 cfu per gram smc material (range: log10 3.93-4.98 cfu/g). from a total of greater than 50 colony picks, a total of 12 bacterial morphotypes were identified and were further examined by employment of partial 16s rrna gene amplification and sequencing techniques, yielding several genera and species, including bacillus licheniformis, bacillus subtilis, klebsiella/enterobacter sp.  microbacterium sp. paenibacillus lentimorbus, pseudomonas mevalonii, sphingobacterium multivorum and stenotrophomonas sp. this is the first preliminary report on the microbial diversity of smc waste and demonstrates the presence of several species that have not been previously described in smc, in addition to two potentially novel species within the genera microbacterium and stenotrophomonas. it is thereby important to examine the ecological microbe-microbe and plant-microbe interactions that are occurring between the native bacterial soil flora and those added annually (theoretically estimated at  approximately 10(18) cells) through the application of smc. such studies would be beneficial in helping to ascertain the ecological consequences involved in the disposal of smc waste on agricultural land.

TI  == microbial diversity and prevalence of virulent pathogens in biofilms developed in a water reclamation system.
AB  == bacterial biofilm is a common phenomenon in both natural and engineered systems which often becomes a source of contamination and microbially influenced corrosion. it is thought that formation of biofilm in the monoculture of several  bacterial species is regulated by acylhomoserine lactone (ahl) quorum-sensing signals. in this study, we investigated the microbial diversity and existence of  ahl-producing and ahl-degrading bacterial species in the biofilm samples from a water reclamation system located in a tropical environment. 16s ribosomal dna sequencing analysis indicated the presence of at least 11 bacterial species, including the frequently encountered bacterial pathogens pseudomonas aeruginosa and klebsiella pneumoniae, and several rare pathogens. we showed that only two groups of isolates, belonging to p. aeruginosa and enterobacter agglomerans, produced ahl signals. we also found that three bacterial isolates, i.e., agrobacterium tumefaciens xj01, bacillus cereus xj08, and ralstonia sp. xj12, expressed ahl degradation enzymes. furthermore, we showed that p. aeruginosa isolate hl43 was virulent against animal model caenorhabditis elegans and released 2-6-fold more pyocyanin cytotoxin than p. aeruginosa strains pa01 and pa14, the two commonly used laboratory strains. these data indicate the complexity and importance of biofilm research in water reclamation.

AB  == citrus variegated chlorosis (cvc) is caused by xylella fastidiosa, a phytopathogenic bacterium that can infect all citrus sinensis cultivars. the endophytic bacterial communities of healthy, resistant, and cvc-affected citrus plants were studied by using cultivation as well as cultivation-independent techniques. the endophytic communities were assessed in surface-disinfected citrus branches by plating and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). dominant isolates were characterized by fatty-acid methyl ester analysis as bacillus pumilus, curtobacterium flaccumfaciens, enterobacter cloacae, methylobacterium spp. (including methylobacterium extorquens, m. fujisawaense, m. mesophilicum, m. radiotolerans, and m. zatmanii), nocardia sp., pantoea agglomerans, and xanthomonas campestris. we observed a relationship between cvc symptoms and the frequency of isolation of species of methylobacterium, the genus that we most frequently isolated from symptomatic plants. in contrast, we isolated c. flaccumfaciens significantly more frequently from asymptomatic plants than from those with symptoms of cvc while p. agglomerans was frequently isolated from tangerine (citrus reticulata) and sweet-orange (c. sinensis) plants, irrespective of whether the plants were symptomatic or asymptomatic or showed symptoms of cvc. dgge analysis of 16s rrna gene fragments amplified from total plant dna resulted in several bands that matched those from the bacterial isolates, indicating that dgge profiles can be used to detect some endophytic bacteria of citrus plants. however, some bands had no match with any isolate, suggesting the occurrence of other, nonculturable or as yet uncultured, endophytic bacteria. a specific band with a high g+c ratio was observed only in asymptomatic plants. the higher frequency of c. flaccumfaciens in asymptomatic plants suggests a role for this organism in the resistance of plants to cvc.

TI  == cay-i, a fungicidal saponin from capsicum sp. fruit.
AB  == saponins are steroidal or terpenoid-based glycosides with surface active properties. a steroidal saponin, cay-1, with a molecular weight of 1243.35 da, was isolated and purified to homogeneity from commercially available dry, ground  fruit of capsicum frutescens. cay-1 was shown to be a potent fungicide for the germinating conidia of aspergillus flavus, a. fumigatus, a. parasiticus and a. niger with species-dependent ld90 values between 3 and 20 microm. activity against some aspergillus species was affected by the test medium used. in vitro assays, cay-1 was effective against pneumocystis carinii (ic50): 9.5 microm) and  candida albicans (ic90: 6.2 microm). cay-1 had no effect on the viability of the  nongerminating conidia of the two filamentous fungi, p. carinii and c. albicans,  nor on the conidial type of fusarium oxysporum. it was ineffective against the bacteria enterobacter agglomerans, bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus. cay-1 was not cytotoxic to a 549 lung carcinoma cells or hela cells at effective fungicidal concentrations. the results indicate that cay-1 is an effective fungicide for aspergillus species, c. albicans and p. carinii at concentrations below the threshold for mammalian cell toxicity.

TI  == kinetic study of two novel enantiomeric tricyclic beta-lactams which efficiently  inactivate class c beta-lactamases.
AB  == a detailed kinetic study of the interaction between two ethylidene derivatives of tricyclic carbapenems, lek 156 and lek 157, and representative beta-lactamases and d-alanyl-d-alanine peptidases (dd-peptidases) is presented. both compounds are very efficient inactivators of the enterobacter cloacae 908r beta-lactamase,  which is usually resistant to inhibition. preliminary experiments indicate that various extended-spectrum class c beta-lactamases (act-1, cmy-1, and mir-1) are also inactivated. with the e. cloacae 908r enzyme, complete inactivation occurs with a second-order rate constant, k(2)/k', of 2 x 10(4) to 4 x 10(4) m(-1) s(-1), and reactivation is very slow, with a half-life of >1 h. accordingly, lek  157 significantly decreases the mic of ampicillin for e. cloacae p99, a constitutive class c beta-lactamase overproducer. with the other serine beta-lactamases tested, the covalent adducts exhibit a wide range of stabilities, with half-lives ranging from long (>4 h with the tem-1 class a enzyme), to medium (10 to 20 min with the oxa-10 class d enzyme), to short (0.2 to 0.4 s with the nmca class a beta-lactamase). by contrast, both carbapenems behave as good substrates of the bacillus cereus metallo-beta-lactamase (class b). the streptomyces sp. strain r61 and k15 extracellular dd-peptidases exhibit low levels of sensitivity to both compounds.

TI  == 16s rdna-based identification of bacteria from conjunctival swabs by pcr and dgge fingerprinting.
AB  == purpose: establishment of a new molecular biology technique for the identification of multiple bacteria from the ocular environment, which can be applied supplementarily to cultivation in cases of severe bacterial infections. methods: from 60 human conjunctivae (29 with purulent and 31 with nonpurulent conjunctivitis), swabs were taken and dna was extracted. fragments of 200 bp, spanning the v3 region of the eubacterial 16s rdna, were amplified by polymerase  chain reaction (pcr) and separated by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). for phylogenetic identification, dgge bands were excised and directly sequenced, or 16s rdna clone libraries were constructed and clones were screened  by dgge. sequences were compared with sequences of known bacteria listed in the embl database. furthermore, the results were compared with results obtained from  conventional cultivation. results: 16s rdna could be amplified from 25 of 29 investigated swabs taken from purulent conjunctivitis eyes and from 2 of 31 investigated swabs taken from nonpurulent conjunctivitis eyes. sixteen samples showed monomicrobial and 11 samples showed polymicrobial infections. the following genera (n is number of samples) were detected: staphylococcus (n = 8),  corynebacterium (n = 7), propionibacterium (n = 7), streptococcus (n = 6), bacillus (n = 2), acinetobacter (n = 3), pseudomonas (n = 3), proteus (n = 1), and brevundimonas (n = 1). four sequences could not be identified to the genus level. they had highest sequence similarities both to sequences of pantoea and enterobacter (n = 1), kingella and neisseria (n = 1), serratia and aranicola (n = 1), and leuconostoc and weissella (n = 2), respectively. culture was only positive for coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 9), corynebacteria (n = 3), staphylococcus aureus (n = 1), streptococcus sp. (n = 1), proteus sp. (n = 1), klebsiella oxytoca (n = 1), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 1). in total, 45% of  the 60 analyzed conjunctival swabs were pcr positive, whereas only 22% were culture positive. no sample positive by culture gave negative results by pcr. conclusions: 16s rdna sequence analyses and dgge fingerprinting are appropriate methods for the detection and identification of monomicrobial as well as polymicrobial ocular infections of bacteria that might not be detected by conventional cultivation.

TI  == variability and interactions between endophytic bacteria and fungi isolated from  leaf tissues of citrus rootstocks.
AB  == fungi and bacteria were isolated from surface disinfected leaf tissues of several citrus rootstocks. the principal bacterial species isolated were alcaligenes sp., bacillus spp. (including b. cereus, b. lentus, b. megaterium, b. pumilus, and b.  subtilis), burkholderia cepacia, curtobacterium flaccumfaciens, enterobacter cloacae, methylobacterium extorquens, and pantoea agglomerans, with p. agglomerans and b. pumilus being the most frequently isolated species. the most abundant fungal species were colletotrichum gloeosporioides, guignardia citricarpa, and cladosporium sp. genetic variability between 36 endophytic bacterial isolates was analysed by the random amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) technique, which indicated that b. pumilus isolates were more diverse than p. agglomerans isolates, although genetic diversity was not related to the host plants. in vitro interaction studies between g. citricarpa isolates and the most  frequently isolated endophytic bacteria showed that metabolites secreted by g. citricarpa have an inhibitory growth effect on some bacillus species, and a stimulatory growth effect on p. agglomerans.

TI  == microbiological investigation on black crusts from open-air stone monuments of bologna (italy).
AB  == samples of black crusts taken from open-air stone monuments in bologna dating back to between the twelfth and the nineteenth century were considered. the microbiological test procedures isolated from a high number of chemoorganotrophic bacteria, each of the samples although it was expected to find chemo-lithotrophic (specially sulfur-oxidizing and nitrifying) bacteria on account of the great amounts of sulphur, carbon, nitrogen dioxides and ammonia in the air. sporogenous and asporogenous species were found among the isolated bacteria: the first were recognized as bacillus subtilis, bacillus brevis, bacillus licheniformis, bacillus mycoides and bacillus megaterium; the latter were corynebacterium glutamicum, actinomyces sp., alcaligenes denitrificans subsp. denitrificans, flavobacterium breve, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas stutzeri. these species were differently associated in the samples studied with a frequency of more than sixty-four per cent. this finding leads us  to believe that their presence in the black crusts is not occasional, but the result of an ecologically significant process of colonization. although behavioural tests (solubilization of calcium carbonate, of calcium sulphate and marble dust) did not reveal lithic activity among the bacteria studied, one can presume that their behaviour in nature - as a more or less complex microbial consortium - can be totally different and exert a decomposing action with regard  to several minerals, most of them acidify the media in which they develop.

AB  == application of a high-performance liquid chromatography-based muramic acid assay  with precolumn fluorescence derivatization to quantification of root-associated bacteria was studied both in pure cultures and in the rhizosphere of axenic festuca rubra seedlings. quantities of muramic acid from acid-hydrolyzed cells of frankia strains, streptomyces griseoviridis, enterobacter agglomerans, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas sp., and bacillus polymyxa were mostly proportional to the respective cell protein and carbon quantities, but in some strains, culture age and particularly sporulation affected these ratios considerably. the muramic  acid/cell protein ratio was generally 2 to 4 times higher in strains of the two actinomycete genera, frankia and streptomyces, than in the rest of the strains. quantification of frankia strains, s. griseoviridis, e. agglomerans, and pseudomonas sp. was also attempted from the rhizosphere of f. rubra seedlings which had been inoculated with pure cultured bacteria and incubated briefly. it was possible to quantify frankia cells by use of the muramic acid assay from both the root and the growth medium, whereas cells of the rest of the bacterial genera could only be detected in the medium. the detection limit for muramic acid was about 10 ng/ml hydrolysis volume, and from the festuca rhizosphere, 28 to 63% of  the muramic acid in the frankia inoculum was recovered.

TI  == cell density and non-equilibrium sorption effects on bacterial dispersal in groundwater microcosms.
AB  == the relative importance of dispersion, physical straining, non-equilibrium sorption, and cell density on the dispersal of bacteria was examined in saturated, flow-dynamic sand columns. the bacterial breakthrough as a result of different size distributions of sand particles was followed by measuring the effluent concentration of 3h-adenosine-labelled cells of a bacillus sp. and an enterobacter sp. strain suspended in groundwater. the breakthrough curves were compared with theoretical curves predicted from an advective-dispersioe equilibrium sorption model (ads), an ads model with a first order sink term for irreversible cell reactions, a two-site model (equilibrium and nonequilibrium sorption sites), and a filtration model. bacterial sand: water isotherms were linear in the experimental concentration range but had positive intercepts. the partition coefficients ranged from 15 to 0.4 for the bacillus sp., and 120 to 0.4 for a pseudomonas sp., and decreased with increasing particle size of the dominant fraction. in a kinetic study, the partition coefficient for the enterobacter sp. in the smaller particle sand was 63 after one hour, but had decreased to 9 after 19 hours. bacteria were detected in the effluent after one pore volume, which was earlier than predicted by the sand : water partition coefficients, and displayed an apparent nonequilibrium breakthrough. dispersion effects and physical straining appeared to be insignificant in the experiments, but tailing of the elution part of the curves indicated slow reversible sorption, and nonequilibrium sorption may have been the main determinant of dispersal retardation. the reversible non-equilibrium sorption invalidated some of the assumptions behind all models except, possibly, the two-site model. consequently, the models described the large particle sand data better where sorption was of less importance for the dispersal. the dispersal retardation was also affected by the bacterial cell density, both in the pore water and on the sand, suggesting that population characteristics may be an important factor for the bacterial distribution between the water and sand habitats. the retardation factor decreased from 13.7 to 7.8 when the cell density in the loading solution was increased from 3x 10(8) to 1.2 x 10(9) cells ml(-1). presaturation of the sand with bacteria had a similar effect.

TI  == visual identification of bacterially contaminated red cells.
AB  == there have been increasing numbers of reports of transfusion-acquired yersinia enterocolitica bacteremia (including several fatal cases). fifteen units of whole blood were inoculated with various concentrations of y. enterocolitica serotype 0:3 and processed into as-3 preserved red cells (rbcs). consistent growth of the  organism was found at inoculum concentrations greater than or equal to 10 colony-forming units per ml. in all 13 units of rbcs that supported the growth of y. enterocolitica, a darkening in color (due to hemolysis and a decrease in po2)  was observed in the bag. the attached sample segments, which were sealed from the main unit, remained sterile and did not darken. this color change was apparent in all the contaminated units by day 35, which was 1.5 to 2 weeks after the bacteria were first detected in cultures of the blood. hence, by comparison of the color of the segment tubing with that of the unit itself, units grossly contaminated with y. enterocolitica can be identified prior to transfusion. moreover, review of photographs on file at the centers for disease control revealed this dramatic  color change in 2 units of blood that caused transfusion-transmitted sepsis (enterobacter agglomerans and an unidentified gram-negative bacillus, not yersinia sp.), which demonstrated that the color change was not limited to y. enterocolitica. this method of visual identification of contaminated units of blood could decrease the incidence of posttransfusion bacterial sepsis.

TI  == bacterial interference with coliform colony sheen production on membrane filters.
AB  == the membrane filter (mf) method for detection and enumeration of coliform bacteria in drinking water requires that the coliforms both grow and produce a green metallic sheen when the filter is incubated on modified endo medium at 35 degrees c for 22 h. large numbers of noncoliform bacteria, which are enumerated by the standard plate count (spc) technique, can interfere with the detection of  coliforms on mf. this paper presents quantitative evidence from laboratory experiments on the interference of specific spc bacteria on coliform colony sheen production on mf. pseudomonas aeruginosa and aeromonas hydrophila caused significant reductions in escherichia coli sheen colony counts when present at 3,000 and 220 per filter, respectively. the flavobacterium sp. and bacillus sp. selected for this study from spc did not interfere with coliform colony sheen production. excessive crowding of e. coli and enterobacter cloacae colonies on mf also caused a reduction in the number of colonies that produced sheen. even when  there was no crowding (14 colonies per filter), only a fraction of the e. cloacae colonies produced sheen colonies on modified endo medium.

AB  == microorganisms able to form l-cysteine from dl-2-amino-delta2-thiazoline-4-carboxylic acid (dl-atc), a chemical intermediate  in the synthesis of dl-cysteine, were isolated from soil samples and classified as pseudomonas sp., pseudomonas cohaerens, p. desmolytica, and p. ovalis. thirteen l-cysteine-producing bacteria were also found in among 463 stock cultures representing 37 genera. these were achromobacter delmarvae. alcaligenes  denitrificans, bacillus brevis, brevibacterium flavum, enterobacter aerogenes, erwinia carotovora, escherichia coli, micrococcus sodonensis, myocoplana dimorpha, sarcina lutea, serratia marcescens, flavobacterium acidoficum, and pseudomonas ovalis. in the presence of intact cells of pseudomonas sp. aj 3854, 6.1 mg of l-cysteine and/or l-cystine per ml was produced from 10 mg of dl-atc-3h2o per ml in a molar yield of 100%. this finding suggests that racemization and asymmetric hydrolysis occurred simultaneously in this incubation mixture. after the complete oxidation of cysteine to cystine by aeration in the presence of ferrous ion, crystalline cystine was isolated; its configuration was  the l isomer based on data from x-ray diffraction, microbioassay, and optical rotation studies.

TI  == [behavior of some microorganisms cultivated in the presence of irradiated maize starch].
AB  == the bactericidal effect of water soluble radiolysis products of maize starch on escherichia coli cultures declines when the initial population grows. this toxicity varies with the culture environment and the bacterial species: bacillus  subtilis, lactobacillus plantarum, streptococcus faecalis, enterobacter sp. moreover, for the eucaryote cell saccharomyces cerevisiae, wild strain or muting  "small colonies", only the generating time is altered by the active parts of radiolysis products. the results are analysed with regard to the hypothesis that  the hydrogen peroxide is responsible for this toxicity.

TI  == a special report: four-year study of a boy with combined immune deficiency maintained in strict reverse isolation from birth.
AB  == a 4-year study of a boy with combined immune deficiency is presented, and the impact of this disease on various aspects of his growth and development is examined. there is no evidence of immune deficiency in either parent or in the genetic background on the maternal side. three children of a brother of the mother's father may have had immune deficiencies but two have grown to be teenagers with no problems. another died. at autopsy, however, lymph nodes appeared normal. the deceased older brother had severe combined immune deficiency (scid). the autopsy findings showed pneumocystis carinii pneumonia to be the direct cause of death and these findings contributed to the diagnosis of scid. after a successful germ-free birth, the male infant (dv) was placed in the isolator. laboratory tests were normal except that the x-rays showed no thymic shadow, his absolute lymphocyte count ranged from 399-440/mm and the lymphocytes  showed no proliferative response to phytohemagglutinin (pha). specific tests showed the antibody-producing immune system and the cell-mediated immune system to be severely defective. the patient's lymphocytes elicited positive responses by lymphocytes from father, mother, and sister. subsequent search in national and international tissue-typing laboratories has shown four hla matches but none has  been nonreactive in mixed lymphocyte culture (mlc). therefore, this patient has remained in isolation to the present; now he is 4 years old. approximately 35 species of microorganisms, mostly transient contaminants, have been isolated, taking into account that the same organism may have been identified under different names in different laboratories. those isolated frequently and in sufficiently high concentration to indicate colonization have been speciated as follows: anaerobes-propionibacterium acnes, lactobacillus catenaforme (disappeared spontaneously), bacteroides oralis ss. elongatus, clostridium (perenne, hastiforme, bifermentans), bacteroides clostridiiformis ss. clostridiiformis; aerobes-alcaligenes faecalis (eradicated by antibiotics), staphylococcus epidermidis, enterobacter agglomerans, microcossu sp. subgroup 1,  bacillus pulvifaciens (disappeared spontaneously); yeasts-candida (tropicalis, parapsilosis). seven are considered to be probable components of the current autoflora: p. acnes, c. bifermentans, b. clostridiiformis ss. clostridiiformis, s. epidermidis, micrococcus sp. subgroup 1, e. agglomerans, c. parapsilosis. no viruses or protozoa have been isolated. at age 3 years, the mean quantitation of  anaerobic cells was 7.9 x 10(7) viable cells/g feces; this falls short of the mean anaerobic load from normal children. the mean aerobic concentration was 1.2  x 10(8) viable cells/g feces, not unlike normal children. qualitatively his flora has abnormally few species and lacks those most common in normal subjects. this child has had no evidence of infection and has always been in excellent health even though some organisms which could be pathogenic under some circumstances have been isolated...

TI  == [kinetics of setting up of a human fecal flora in germ free mice and trial of decontamination of antibiotherapy (author's transl)].
AB  == we have tried in this study to reproduce in germfree mice a bacterial equilibrium observed previously in the gastrointestinal tract of child "l.n.", reared in a plastic isolator. eight bacterial strains were studied. seven had been fortuitously introduced: acinetobacter lwoffi ln1, staphylococcus epidermidis ln2, clostridium perfringens ln3, plectridium anatum ln4, streptococcus bovis ln5, enterobacter cloacae ln6, corynebacterium sp ln7. the eighth strain was purposely administered to the child in order to take advantage of an antagonism between this strain and spontaneously acquired flora. this strain is bacillus licheniformis fd1. the gnotoxenic mice proved to be a good experimental model because we found their bacterial equilibrium comparable to that observed in child l.n. in addition, we studied the decontamination procedures of the gastrointestinal tract of mice by observing both the antagonism of b. licheniformis with bacitracin, and the action of a suitable mixture of antibiotics. conditions for the realization of this decontamination are discussed in this study.

TI  == formation of methyl mercury by bacteria.
AB  == twenty-three hg2+-resistant cultures were isolated from sediment of the savannah  river in georgia; of these, 14 were gram-negative short rods belonging to the genera escherichia and enterobacter, six were gram-positive cocci (three staphylococcus sp. and three streptococcus sp.) and three were bacillus sp. all the escherichia, enterobacter, and the bacillus strain were more resistant to hg2+ than the strains of staphylococci and streptococci. adaptation using serial  dilutions and concentration gradient agar plate techniques showed that it was possible to select a hg2+-resistant strain from a parent culture identified as enterobacter aerogenes. this culture resisted 1,200 mug of hg2+ per ml of medium  and produced methyl mercury from hgcl2, but was unable to convert hg2+ to volatile elemental mercury (hg0). under constant aeration (i.e., submerged culture), slightly more methyl mercury was formed than in the absence of aeration. production of methyl mercury was cyclic in nature and slightly decreased if dl-homocysteine was present in media, but increased with methylcobalamine. it is concluded that the bacterial production of methyl mercury may be a means of resistance and detoxification against mercurials in which inorganic hg2+ is converted to organic form and secreted into the environment.

TI  == degradation of uric acid by certain aerobic bacteria.
AB  == we have isolated and identified nine cultures of aerobic bacteria capable of growing on an elective medium containing uric acid as the only source of carbon,  nitrogen, and energy. four of these cultures were identified as aerobacter aerogenes, two as klebsiella pneumoniae, and the remainder as serratia killiensis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and bacillus species. another culture identified as p. fluorescens required both glucose and uric acid for growth. when 23 laboratory stock cultures were inoculated into the uric acid medium, a. aerogenes, b. subtilis, mycobacterium phlei, p. aeruginosa, and s. marcescens were able to grow. these five cultures also grew when the uric acid was replaced  with adenine, guanine, hypoxanthine, xanthine, or allantoin, but growth was poor. in all of these media, including the uric acid medium, addition of glucose along  with the nitrogenous compounds yielded good growth. induction experiments demonstrated that the ability of a. aerogenes, k. pneumoniae, p. aeruginosa, p. fluorescens, s. kiliensis, s. marcescens, b. subtilis, and bacillus sp. to degrade uric acid is an induced property. of these organisms, only bacillus sp. accumulated a small amount of intracellular uric acid.

TI  == repression of staphylococcus aureus by food bacteria. ii. causes of inhibition.
AB  == two food bacteria, serratia marcescens and pseudomonas sp. cs-1, inhibited an enterotoxigenic strain of staphylococcus aureus, apparently by out-competing it for nutrients. five others, bacillus cereus, proteus vulgaris, escherichia coli h-52, aerobacter aerogenes, and achromobacter sp., inhibited by means of antibiotic substances which were seitz-filterable, dialyzable, and stable at 90 c for 10 min. inhibition was not caused by changes in ph, oxidation-reduction potential, or production of peroxide or fatty acids. the concentrated antibiotic  material from e. coli h-52 contained amino acids but not peptides and was especially effective against staphylococci and micrococci.
