TI  - Pyrosequencing analysis of microbial community and food-borne bacteria on restaurant cutting boards collected in Seri Kembangan, Malaysia, and their correlation with grades of food premises.
AB  - This study adopts the pyrosequencing technique to identify bacteria present on 26 kitchen cutting boards collected from different grades of food premises around Seri Kembangan, a city in Malaysia. Pyrosequencing generated 452,401 of total reads of OTUs with an average of 1.4x10(7) bacterial cells/cm(2). Proteobacteria, Firmicutes and Bacteroides were identified as the most abundant phyla in the samples. Taxonomic richness was generally high with >1000 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) observed across all samples. The highest appearance frequencies (100%) were OTUs closely related to Enterobacter sp., Enterobacter aerogenes, Pseudomonas sp. and Pseudomonas putida. Several OTUs were identified most closely related to known food-borne pathogens, including Bacillus cereus, Cronobacter sakazaki, Cronobacter turisensis, Escherichia coli, E. coli O157:H7, Hafnia alvei, Kurthia gibsonii, Salmonella bongori, Salmonella enterica, Salmonella paratyphi, Salmonella tyhpi, Salmonella typhimurium and Yersinia enterocolitica ranging from 0.005% to 0.68% relative abundance. The condition and grade of the food premises on a three point cleanliness scale did not correlate with the bacterial abundance and type. Regardless of the status and grades, all food premises have the same likelihood to introduce food-borne bacteria from cutting boards to their foods and must always prioritize the correct food handling procedure in order to avoid unwanted outbreak of food-borne illnesses.
TI  - CbrA is a flavin adenine dinucleotide protein that modifies the Escherichia coli  outer membrane and confers specific resistance to Colicin M.
AB  - Colicin M (Cma) is a protein toxin produced by Escherichia coli that kills sensitive E. coli cells by inhibiting murein biosynthesis in the periplasm. Recombinant plasmids carrying cbrA (formerly yidS) strongly increased resistance of cells to Cma, whereas deletion of cbrA increased Cma sensitivity. Transcription of cbrA is positively controlled by the two-component CreBC system. A DeltacreB mutant was highly Cma sensitive because little CbrA was synthesized. Treatment of CbrA-overproducing cells by osmotic shock failed to render cells Cma sensitive because the cells were resistant to osmotic shock. In a natural environment with a growth-limiting nutrient supply, cells producing CbrA defend themselves against colicin M synthesized by competing cells. Isolated CbrA is a protein with noncovalently bound flavin adenine dinucleotide. Sequence comparison and structure prediction assign the closest relative of CbrA with a known crystal structure as digeranylgeranyl-glycerophospholipid reductase of Thermoplasma acidophilum. CbrA is found in Escherichia coli, Citrobacter, and Salmonella bongori but not in other enterobacteria. The next homologs with the highest identity (over 50%) are found in the anaerobic Clostridium botulinum group 1 and a few other Firmicutes.
TI  - Salmonella bongori provides insights into the evolution of the Salmonellae.
AB  - The genus Salmonella contains two species, S. bongori and S. enterica. Compared to the well-studied S. enterica there is a marked lack of information regarding the genetic makeup and diversity of S. bongori. S. bongori has been found predominantly associated with cold-blooded animals, but it can infect humans. To define the phylogeny of this species, and compare it to S. enterica, we have sequenced 28 isolates representing most of the known diversity of S. bongori. This cross-species analysis allowed us to confidently differentiate ancestral functions from those acquired following speciation, which include both metabolic and virulence-associated capacities. We show that, although S. bongori inherited a basic set of Salmonella common virulence functions, it has subsequently elaborated on this in a different direction to S. enterica. It is an established feature of S. enterica evolution that the acquisition of the type III secretion systems (T3SS-1 and T3SS-2) has been followed by the sequential acquisition of genes encoding secreted targets, termed effectors proteins. We show that this is also true of S. bongori, which has acquired an array of novel effector proteins (sboA-L). All but two of these effectors have no significant S. enterica homologues and instead are highly similar to those found in enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC). Remarkably, SboH is found to be a chimeric effector protein, encoded by a fusion of the T3SS-1 effector gene sopA and a gene highly similar to the EPEC effector nleH from enteropathogenic E. coli. We demonstrate that representatives of these new effectors are translocated and that SboH, similarly to NleH, blocks intrinsic apoptotic pathways while being targeted to the mitochondria by the SopA part of the fusion. This work suggests that S. bongori has inherited the ancestral Salmonella virulence gene set, but has adapted by incorporating virulence determinants that resemble those employed by EPEC.
TI  - Evaluation of the taxonomic utility of six-enzyme pulsed-field gel electrophoresis in reconstructing Salmonella subspecies phylogeny.
AB  - Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) remains an important tool in the molecular epidemiological evaluation of strains emerging from disease outbreak clusters. Recent studies of Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Salmonella Enteritidis have noted marked improvements in the discriminatory power of PFGE when combining band profiles from up to six restriction enzyme datasets into a single concatenated analysis. This approach has provided more accurate assignments of genetic relationships among closely related strains and allowed effective phylogenetic inference of host and geographical reservoirs. Although this approach enhances epidemiological congruence among closely related strains, it remains unclear to what extent six-enzyme PFGE pattern similarity reiterates evolutionary relatedness among more distantly related Salmonella strains (i.e., serovar or subspecies levels). Here, taxonomic accuracy of six-enzyme PFGE is tested phylogenetically across two distinct Salmonella enterica populations-Salmonella reference collection B (SARB), representing the breadth of taxonomic diversity of S. enterica subspecies I only, and Salmonella reference collection C (SARC), comprising the seven disparate subspecies of S. enterica plus S. bongori. Cladistic analysis of SAR strains revealed substantial polyphyly between the two strain collections such that numerous SARB strains clustered more closely with diverged SARC subspecies rather than with other members of subspecies I. Also, in several cases, SARC sibling strains from the same subspecies were evolutionary obscured-broken into distant locales on the most parsimonious six-enzyme trees. Genetic diversity among SARB and SARC strains was comparable at 45% and 47%, respectively, while congruence testing revealed discordance among individual enzyme datasets. While six-enzyme PFGE is effective in ascertaining accurate genetic relationships for more closely related strains (e.g., strains within the same serovar), reconstitution of evolutionarily meaningful strain groupings may be elusive for Salmonella at the serovar level and above. Thus, caution is warranted when applying PFGE with a limited number of enzymes as the primary phylogenetic marker in these instances.
TI  - lac repressor is an antivirulence factor of Salmonella enterica: its role in the  evolution of virulence in Salmonella.
AB  - The genus Salmonella includes many pathogens of great medical and veterinary importance. Bacteria belonging to this genus are very closely related to those belonging to the genus Escherichia. lacZYA operon and lacI are present in Escherichia coli, but not in Salmonella enterica. It has been proposed that Salmonella has lost lacZYA operon and lacI during evolution. In this study, we have investigated the physiological and evolutionary significance of the absence of lacI in Salmonella enterica. Using murine model of typhoid fever, we show that the expression of LacI causes a remarkable reduction in the virulence of Salmonella enterica. LacI also suppresses the ability of Salmonella enterica to proliferate inside murine macrophages. Microarray analysis revealed that LacI interferes with the expression of virulence genes of Salmonella pathogenicity island 2. This effect was confirmed by RT-PCR and Western blot analysis. Interestingly, we found that SBG0326 of Salmonella bongori is homologous to lacI of Escherichia coli. Salmonella bongori is the only other species of the genus Salmonella and it lacks the virulence genes of Salmonella pathogenicity island 2. Overall, our results demonstrate that LacI is an antivirulence factor of Salmonella enterica and suggest that absence of lacI has facilitated the acquisition of virulence genes of Salmonella pathogenicity island 2 in Salmonella enterica making it a successful systemic pathogen.
TI  - ClyA cytolysin from Salmonella: distribution within the genus, regulation of expression by SlyA, and pore-forming characteristics.
AB  - Functional homologs of the Escherichia coli cytolysin A (clyA, hlyE, sheA) gene have recently been detected in Salmonella enterica serovars Typhi (S. Typhi) and Paratyphi A (S. Paratyphi A). In this study, analysis of a collection of Salmonella strains showed that all S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi A strains tested harbor an intact copy of the corresponding clyA variant, i.e. clyA(STy) and clyA(SPaA), respectively. On the other hand, clyA proved to be absent in the S. enterica serovar Paratyphi B and serovar Paratyphi C strains, in various non-typhoid S. enterica subsp. enterica serovars (Typhimurium, Enteritidis, Choleraesuis, Dublin, and Gallinarum), and in S. enterica subsp. arizonae and Salmonella bongori strains. When grown under normal laboratory conditions, the S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi A strains produced only basal amounts of ClyA protein and did not exhibit a clyA-dependent hemolytic phenotype. RT-PCR and immunoblot analyses as well as phenotypic data revealed, however, that the expression of clyA(STy) and clyA(SPaA) can be activated by the Salmonella transcription factor SlyA. In addition, osmotic protection assays and lipid bilayer experiments demonstrated that the hemolytic ClyA(STy) and ClyA(SPaA) proteins are effective pore-forming toxins which, similar to E. coli ClyA, generate large, stable, moderately cation-selective channels in target membranes. Taken together with our recent serological findings which have indicated that S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi A strains produce substantial amounts of ClyA during human infection, these data suggest that ClyA may play a role in S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi A pathogenesis.
TI  - Oral immunization with an rfaH mutant elicits protection against salmonellosis in mice.
AB  - Loss of the transcriptional antiterminator RfaH results in virulence attenuation  (>10(4)-fold increase in 50% lethal dose) of the archetypal Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium strain SL1344 by both orogastric and intraperitoneal routes of infection in BALB/c mice. Oral immunization with the mutant efficiently protects mice against a subsequent oral infection with the wild-type strain. Interestingly, in vitro immunoreactivity is not confined to strain SL1344; rather, it is directed also towards other serovars of S. enterica and even Salmonella bongori strains.
TI  - Functional transfer of Salmonella pathogenicity island 2 to Salmonella bongori and Escherichia coli.
AB  - The type III secretion system (T3SS) encoded by the Salmonella pathogenicity island 2 (SPI2) has a central role in systemic infections by Salmonella enterica and for the intracellular phenotype. Intracellular S. enterica uses the SPI2-encoded T3SS to translocate a set of effector proteins into the host cell, which modify host cell functions, enabling intracellular survival and replication of the bacteria. We sought to determine whether specific functions of the SPI2-encoded T3SS can be transferred to heterologous hosts Salmonella bongori and Escherichia coli Mutaflor, species that lack the SPI2 locus and loci encoding effector proteins. The SPI2 virulence locus was cloned and functionally expressed in S. bongori and E. coli. Here, we demonstrate that S. bongori harboring the SPI2 locus is capable of secretion of SPI2 substrate proteins under culture conditions, as well as of translocation of effector proteins under intracellular conditions. An SPI2-mediated cellular phenotype was induced by S. bongori harboring the SPI2 if the sifA locus was cotransferred. An interference with the host cell microtubule cytoskeleton, a novel SPI2-dependent phenotype, was observed in epithelial cells infected with S. bongori harboring SPI2 without additional effector genes. S. bongori harboring SPI2 showed increased intracellular persistence in a cell culture model, but SPI2 transfer was not sufficient to confer to S. bongori systemic pathogenicity in a murine model. Transfer of SPI2 to heterologous hosts offers a new tool for the study of SPI2 functions and the phenotypes of individual effectors.
TI  - The shdA gene is restricted to serotypes of Salmonella enterica subspecies I and  contributes to efficient and prolonged fecal shedding.
AB  - Little is known about factors which enable Salmonella serotypes to circulate within populations of livestock and domestic fowl. We have identified a DNA region which is present in Salmonella serotypes commonly isolated from livestock and domestic fowl (S. enterica subspecies I) but absent from reptile-associated Salmonella serotypes (S. bongori and S. enterica subspecies II to VII). This DNA region was cloned from Salmonella serotype Typhimurium and sequence analysis revealed the presence of a 6,105-bp open reading frame, designated shdA, whose product's deduced amino acid sequence displayed homology to that of AIDA-I from diarrheagenic Escherichia coli, MisL of serotype Typhimurium, and IcsA of Shigella flexneri. The shdA gene was located adjacent to xseA at 52 min, in a 30-kb DNA region which is not present in Escherichia coli K-12. A serotype Typhimurium shdA mutant was shed with the feces in reduced numbers and for a shorter period of time compared to its isogenic parent. A possible role for the shdA gene during the expansion in host range of S. enterica subspecies I to include warm-blooded vertebrates is discussed.
TI  - Distribution of intervening sequences in the genes for 23S rRNA and rRNA fragmentation among strains of the Salmonella reference collection B (SARB) and SARC sets.
AB  - Intervening sequences (IVSs) occur sporadically in several bacterial genera in the genes for 23S rRNA at relatively conserved locations. They are cleaved after transcription and lead to the presence of fragmented rRNA, which is incorporated into the ribosomes without religation but is nevertheless functional. The fragmentation of rRNA and the number of IVSs in all 72 strains of the Salmonella Reference Collection B set and 16 strains of the Salmonella Reference Collection C set, which have been established on the basis of multilocus enzyme electrophoresis (MLEE), were analyzed in the present study. Fragmentation of 23S rRNA was restricted to conserved cleavage sites located at bp 550 (helix 25) and bp 1170 (helix 45), locations where IVSs have been reported. Random cleavage at sites where IVSs could not be detected was not seen. Uncleaved IVSs were not detected in any case; thus, the IVSs invariably led to rRNA fragmentation, indicating a strong selection for maintenance of RNase III cleavage sites. The distribution of the number of IVSs carried by the different strains in the seven rrl genes is diverse, and the pattern of IVS possession could not be related to the MLEE pattern among the various Salmonella strains tested; this indicates that the IVSs are frequently exchanged between strains by lateral transfer. All eight subspecies of the genus Salmonella, including subspecies V represented by Salmonella bongori, have IVSs in both helix 25 and helix 45; this indicates that IVSs entered the genus after its divergence from Escherichia coli (more than 100 million years ago) but before separation of the genus Salmonella into many forms or that they were in the ancestor but have been lost from Escherichia.
TI  - Comparison of the Escherichia coli K-12 genome with sampled genomes of a Klebsiella pneumoniae and three salmonella enterica serovars, Typhimurium, Typhi and Paratyphi.
AB  - The Escherichia coli K-12 genome (ECO) was compared with the sampled genomes of the sibling species Salmonella enterica serovars Typhimurium, Typhi and Paratyphi A (collectively referred to as SAL) and the genome of the close outgroup Klebsiella pneumoniae (KPN). There are at least 160 locations where sequences of >400 bp are absent from ECO but present in the genomes of all three SAL and 394 locations where sequences are present in ECO but close homologs are absent in all SAL genomes. The 394 sequences in ECO that do not occur in SAL contain 1350 (30.6%) of the 4405 ECO genes. Of these, 1165 are missing from both SAL and KPN. Most of the 1165 genes are concentrated within 28 regions of 10-40 kb, which consist almost exclusively of such genes. Among these regions were six that included previously identified cryptic phage. A hypothetical ancestral state of genomic regions that differ between ECO and SAL can be inferred in some cases by reference to the genome structure in KPN and the more distant relative Yersinia pestis. However, many changes between ECO and SAL are concentrated in regions where all four genera have a different structure. The rate of gene insertion and deletion is sufficiently high in these regions that the ancestral state of the ECO/SAL lineage cannot be inferred from the present data. The sequencing of other closely related genomes, such as S.bongori or Citrobacter, may help in this regard.
TI  - Genomic subtraction identifies Salmonella typhimurium prophages, F-related plasmid sequences, and a novel fimbrial operon, stf, which are absent in Salmonella typhi.
AB  - Salmonella typhimurium causes systemic and fatal infection in inbred mice, while  the related serotype Salmonella typhi is avirulent for mammals other than humans. In order to identify genes from the virulent strain S. typhimurium ATCC 14028 that are absent in S. typhi Ty2, and therefore might be involved in S. typhimurium mouse virulence, a PCR-supported genomic subtractive hybridization procedure was employed. We have identified a novel putative fimbrial operon, stfACDEFG, located at centisome 5 of the S. typhimurium chromosome, which is absent in S. typhi, Salmonella arizonae, and Salmonella bongori but was detected in several other Salmonella serotypes. The fimbrial genes represent a genomic insertion in S. typhimurium compared to the respective region between fhuB and hemL in Escherichia coli K-12. In addition, the subtraction procedure yielded F plasmid-related sequences from the S. typhimurium virulence plasmid, a number of DNA fragments representing parts of lambdoid prophages and putative sugar transporters, and several fragments with unknown sequences. The majority of subtracted chromosomal sequences map to three distinct locations, around centisomes 5, 27, and 57.
TI  - Ferrioxamine-mediated Iron(III) utilization by Salmonella enterica.
AB  - Utilization of ferrioxamines as sole sources of iron distinguishes Salmonella enterica serotypes Typhimurium and Enteritidis from a number of related species, including Escherichia coli. Ferrioxamine supplements have therefore been used in preenrichment and selection media to increase the bacterial growth rate while selectivity is maintained. We characterized the determinants involved in utilization of ferrioxamines B, E, and G by S. enterica serotype Typhimurium by performing siderophore cross-feeding bioassays. Transport of all three ferric siderophores across the outer membrane was dependent on the FoxA receptor encoded by the Fur-repressible foxA gene. However, only the transport of ferrioxamine G was dependent on the energy-transducing protein TonB, since growth stimulation of a tonB strain by ferrioxamines B and E was observed, albeit at lower efficiencies than in the parental strain. Transport across the inner membrane was dependent on the periplasmic binding protein-dependent ABC transporter complex comprising FhuBCD, as has been reported for other hydroxamate siderophores of enteric bacteria. The distribution of the foxA gene in the genus Salmonella, as indicated by DNA hybridization studies and correlated with the ability to utilize ferrioxamine E, was restricted to subspecies I, II, and IIIb, and this gene was absent from subspecies IIIa, IV, VI, and VII (formerly subspecies IV) and Salmonella bongori (formerly subspecies V). S. enterica serotype Typhimurium mutants with either a transposon insertion or a defined nonpolar frameshift (+2) mutation in the foxA gene were not able to utilize any of the three ferrioxamines tested. A strain carrying the nonpolar foxA mutation exhibited a significantly reduced ability to colonize rabbit ileal loops compared to the foxA+ parent. In addition, a foxA mutant was markedly attenuated in mice inoculated by either the intragastric or intravenous route. Mice inoculated with the foxA mutant were protected against subsequent challenge by the foxA+ parent strain.
TI  - Analysis of the type 1 pilin gene cluster fim in Salmonella: its distinct evolutionary histories in the 5' and 3' regions.
AB  - The type 1 pilin encoded by fim is present in both Escherichia coli and Salmonella natural isolates, but several lines of evidence indicate that similarities at the fim locus may be an example of independent acquisition rather than common ancestry. For example, the fim gene cluster is found at different chromosomal locations and with distinct gene orders in these closely related species. In this work we examined the fim gene cluster of Salmonella, the genes of which show high nucleotide sequence divergence from their E. coli counterparts, as well as a different G+C content and codon usage. DNA hybridization analysis revealed that, among the salmonellae, the fim gene cluster is present in all isolates of S. enterica but is absent from S. bongori. Molecular phylogenetic analyses of the fimA and fimI genes yield an estimate of phylogeny that is in satisfactory congruence with housekeeping and other virulence genes examined in this species. In contrast, phylogenetic analyses of the fimZ, fimY, and fimW genes indicate that horizontal transfer of this region has occurred more than once. There is also size variation in the fimZ, fimY, and fimW intergenic regions in the 3' region, and these genes are absent in isolate S2983 of subspecies IIIa. Interestingly, the G+C contents of the fimZ, fimY, and fimW genes are less than 46%, which is considerably lower than those of the other six genes of the fim cluster. This study demonstrates that horizontal transmission of all or part of the same gene cluster can occur repeatedly, with the result that different regions of a single gene cluster may have different evolutionary histories.
TI  - Phylogenetic relationships of Salmonella based on rRNA sequences.
AB  - To establish the phylogenetic relationships between the subspecies of Salmonella  enterica (official name Salmonella choleraesuis), Salmonella bongori and related members of Enterobacteriaceae, sequence comparison of rRNA was performed by maximum-likelihood analysis. The two Salmonella species were separated by 16S rRNA analysis and found to be closely related to the Escherichia coli and Shigella complex by both 16S and 23S rRNA analyses. The diphasic serotypes S. enterica subspp. I and VI were separated from the monophasic serotypes subspp. IIIa and IV, including S. bongori, by 23S rRNA sequence comparison.
TI  - Phylogenetic relationships of Salmonella based on DNA sequence comparison of atpD encoding the beta subunit of ATP synthase.
AB  - DNA sequences covering 57% of atpD encoding the beta subunit of ATP synthase were determined for 16 strains of Salmonella enterica, two strains of S. bongori, and one strain each of Citrobacter freundii and Yersinia enterocolitica, and comparison was made with the published Escherichia coli and Enterobacter aerogenes sequences. The phylogenetic tree based on maximum-likelihood analysis showed separation of the subspecies of S. enterica except for two serotypes of subspecies II which were unsupported by a common node. The two serotypes of S. bongori were separated from S. enterica and related to the serotypes of subspecies II. A tight relationship was found between S. enterica subspecies IIIa consisting of monophasic serotypes and subspecies IIIb consisting of diphasic serotypes. This is in conflict with results obtained for most other housekeeping genes and the 23S rRNA gene separating mono- from diphasic subspecies.
TI  - IroN, a novel outer membrane siderophore receptor characteristic of Salmonella enterica.
AB  - Speciation in enterobacteria involved horizontal gene transfer. Therefore, analysis of genes acquired by horizontal transfer that are present in one species but not its close relatives is expected to give insights into how new bacterial species were formed. In this study we characterize iroN, a gene located downstream of the iroBC operon in the iroA locus of Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi. Like iroBC, the iroN gene is present in all phylogenetic lineages of S. enterica but is absent from closely related species such as Salmonella bongori or Escherichia coli. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of iroN with other proteins suggested that this gene encodes an outer membrane siderophore receptor protein. Mutational analysis in S. enterica and expression in E. coli identified a 78-kDa outer membrane protein as the iroN gene product. When introduced into an E. coli fepA cir fiu aroB mutant on a cosmid, iroN mediated utilization of structurally related catecholate siderophores, including N-(2,3-dihydroxybenzoyl)-L-serine, myxochelin A, benzaldehyde-2,3-dihydroxybenzhydrazone, 2-N,6-N-bis(2,3-dihydroxybenzoyl)-L-lysine, 2-N,6-N-bis(2,3-dihydroxybenzoyl)-L-lysine amide, and enterochelin. These results suggest that the iroA locus functions in iron acquisition in S. enterica.
TI  - Rapid detection of Salmonella enterica with primers specific for iroB.
AB  - The iroB gene of Salmonella enterica is absent from the chromosome of the related organism Escherichia coli. We determined the distribution of this gene among 150 bacterial isolates, representing 51 serotypes of different Salmonella species and subspecies and 8 other bacterial species which are frequent contaminants during routine enrichment procedures by Southern hybridization. An iroB-specific DNA probe detected homologous sequences in all strains of S. enterica, including serotypes of S. enterica subsp. enterica (I), salamae (II), diarizonae (IIIb), and houtenae (IV). No hybridization signal was obtained with strains of Salmonella bongori or other bacterial species. In contrast, hybridization with a DNA probe specific for purD, a purine biosynthesis gene, detected homologs in all bacterial species tested. Primers specific for iroB were used to amplify this gene from 197 bacterial isolates by PCR. The iroB gene could be PCR amplified from S. enterica subsp. enterica (I), salamae (II), diarizonae (IIIb), houtenae (IV), arizonae (IIIa), and indica (VI), but not from S. bongori or other bacterial species. Thus, PCR amplification of iroB can be used to distinguish between S. enterica and other bacterial species, including S. bongori. A combination of preenrichment in buffered peptone water supplemented with ferrioxamine E and amplification of iroB by magnetic immuno-PCR allowed detection of S. enterica in albumen within 24 h. In conclusion, PCR amplification of iroB is a new sensitive and selective method which has the potential to rapidly detect S. enterica serotypes.
TI  - Analysis of the boundaries of Salmonella pathogenicity island 2 and the corresponding chromosomal region of Escherichia coli K-12.
AB  - We recently identified a pathogenicity island (SPI2) located at 30.7 centisomes on the Salmonella typhimurium chromosome. SPI2 contains genes encoding a type III secretion system whose function is distinct from that of the type III secretion system encoded by a pathogenicity island (SPI1) at 63 centisomes which is involved in epithelial cell entry. An analysis of the boundaries of SPI2 and comparison with the corresponding region of the Escherichia coli chromosome revealed that SPI2 inserted adjacent to the tRNA(Val) gene. The E. coli chromosome contains 9 kb of DNA at the region corresponding to the SPI2 insertion point which appears to be absent in S. typhimurium. The distribution of SPI1 and SPI2 was examined in various Salmonella isolates. In contrast to type III secretion system genes of SPI1, those of SPI2 are not present in Salmonella bongori, which diverged at the first branch point in the Salmonella lineage. These and other data indicate that SPI2 was acquired by a Salmonella strain already harboring SPI1 by horizontal transfer from an unknown source.
