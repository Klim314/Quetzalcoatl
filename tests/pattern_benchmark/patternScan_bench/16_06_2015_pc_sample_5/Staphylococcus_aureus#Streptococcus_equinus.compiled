TI  - Antimicrobial Activity of Chemokine CXCL10 for Dermal and Oral Microorganisms.
AB  - CXCL10 (IP-10) is a small 10 kDa chemokine with antimicrobial activity. It is induced by IFN-gamma, chemoattracts mononuclear cells, and promotes adhesion of T cells. Recently, we detected CXCL10 on the surface of the skin and in the oral cavity. In the current study, we used broth microdilution and radial diffusion assays to show that CXCL10 inhibits the growth of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Corynebacterium jeikeium, Corynebacterium striatum, and Candida albicans HMV4C, but not Corynebacterium bovis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus sanguinis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Poryphromonas gingivalis, or C. albicans ATCC 64124. The reason for the selective antimicrobial activity is not yet known. However, antimicrobial activity of CXCL10 may be related to its composition and structure, as a cationic 98 amino acid residue molecule with 10 lysine residues, 7 arginine residues, a total net charge of +11, and a theoretical pI of 9.93. Modeling studies revealed that CXCL10 contains an alpha-helix at the N-terminal, three anti-parallel beta-strands in the middle, and an alpha-helix at the C-terminal. Thus, CXCL10, when produced on the surface of the skin or in the oral cavity, likely has antimicrobial activity and may enhance innate antimicrobial and cellular responses to the presence of select commensal or opportunistic microorganisms.
TI  - Failure of early diagnosis of infective endocarditis in Japan--a retrospective descriptive analysis.
AB  - Infective endocarditis (IE) is a severe disease with high morbidity and mortality, and these can be exacerbated by delay in diagnosis. We investigated IE diagnosis in Japan with the emphasis on the delay in diagnosis and its cause and implications. We conducted a retrospective study on 82 definite IE patients at Kobe University Hospital from April 1, 2008, through March 31, 2013. We reviewed charts of the patients for data such as causative pathogens, prescription of inappropriate antibiotic use prior to the diagnosis, existence of risk factors of IE, previous doctor's subspecialty, or duration until the diagnosis, with the primary outcome of 180-day mortality. We also qualitatively, as well as quantitatively, analyzed those cases with delay in diagnosis, and hypothesized its causes and implications. Eighty-two patients were reviewed for this analysis. The average age was 61 +/- 14.5-year-old. Fifty percent of patients had known underlying risk factors for IEs, such as prosthetic heart valve (10), valvular heart disease (21), congenital heart disease (3), or cardiomyopathy (2). The median days until the diagnosis was 14 days (range 2 days to 1 year). Sixty-five percent of patients received inappropriate antibiotic before the diagnosis (53). Forty percent of causative organisms were Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA 20, MRSA 13), 32% were viridans streptococci and Streptococcus bovis, 28% were others or unknown (CNS 5, Corynebacterium 3, Cardiobacterium 1, Candida 1). Subspecialties such as General Internal Medicine (15), and Orthopedics (13) were associated with delay in diagnosis. Ten patients (12%) died during follow up, and 8 of them had been received prior inappropriate antibiotics. Significant delay in the diagnosis of IE was observed in Japan. Inappropriate antibiotics were prescribed frequently and may be associated with poor prognosis. Further improvement for earlier diagnosis of IE is needed.
TI  - Reduction of teat skin mastitis pathogen loads: differences between strains, dips, and contact times.
AB  - The purpose of these experiments was to (1) assess differences in mastitis pathogen strain sensitivities to teat disinfectants (teat dips), and (2) determine the optimum time for premilking teat dips to remain in contact with teat skin to reduce pathogen loads on teat skin. Two experiments were conducted using the excised teat model. In experiment 1, the differences in mastitis pathogen strain sensitivities to 4 commercially available dips (dip A: 1% H2O2; dip B: 1% chlorine dioxide; dip C: 1% iodophor; and dip D: 0.5% iodophor) were evaluated. Four strains of 11 common mastitis pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Mycoplasma bovis, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus uberis, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus chromogenes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus hyicus, Staphylococcus xylosus, and Staphylococcus haemolyticus) were tested. In experiment 2, the percentage log reduction of mastitis pathogens (Escherichia coli, Streptococcus uberis, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Klebsiella species, Staphylococcus chromogenes, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Staphylococcus xylosus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis) on teat skin with 3 commercially available teat dips: dip A; dip D; and dip E: 0.25% iodophor, using dip contact times of 15, 30, and 45 s, was evaluated. Experiment 1 results indicated significant differences in strain sensitivities to dips within pathogen species: Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus chromogenes, and Streptococcus uberis. Species differences were also found where Mycoplasma bovis (97.9% log reduction) was the most sensitive to tested teat dips and Staphylococcus haemolyticus (71.4% log reduction) the most resistant. Experiment 2 results indicated that contact times of 30 and 45 s were equally effective in reducing recovered bacteria for dips D and E and were also significantly more effective than a 15-s contact time. No differences were seen in recovered bacteria between tested contact times after treatment with dip A. It can be concluded that different mastitis pathogen species and strains within species may possess different sensitivities to teat dips, which may have implications in selection of teat dips on dairies. Furthermore, a 30-s premilking dip contact time for iodophors and 15 s for H2O2 dips may be optimal in reducing pathogen load in the shortest amount of time. A reduction in premilking teat dip contact time may improve milking parlor efficiency.
TI  - [Recurrent meningitis due to anatomical defects: The bacteria indicates its origin].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Recurrent meningitis is a rare disease. Anatomical abnormalities and immunodeficiency states are predisposing factors. Four cases, in which immunodeficiency was excluded, are presented. The causal microorganism led to the detection of the anatomical defect responsible for the recurrences. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective review of 4 cases with clinical diagnosis of recurrent bacterial meningitis. RESULTS: Case 1: a thirty month-old boy with unilateral hearing loss, diagnosed with Mondini abnormality by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) after 2 episodes of Haemophilus influenzae meningitis. Surgical repair after third recurrence. Case 2: fourteen year-old girl diagnosed by MRI with cribriform plate defect after 3 episodes of meningitis due to Streptococcus pneumoniae. Ventriculoperitoneal shunt was placed. Case 3: girl with meningitis due to Staphylococcus aureus at 2 and 7 months. MRI shows occipital dermal sinus requiring excision. Complication with cerebellar abscesses because of a coexisting dermoid cyst. Case 4: child with meningitis due to Streptococcus bovis at 9 days and Enterococcus faecium, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli at 7 months, with positive cultures to Citrobacter freundii and E. faecium later on. Spinal MRI led to the diagnosis of Currarino syndrome with CSF fistula, which was surgically repaired. The 4 patients had undergone image studies reported as normal during the first episodes. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with recurrent meningitis the possibility of an anatomical defect should be considered. The isolated microorganism should help to locate it. It is essential to know the normal flora of the different anatomical sites. The definitive treatment is usually surgical.
TI  - Cloning, expression, and purification of a new antibacterial substance gene from  larvae of Musca domestica (Diptera: Muscidae).
AB  - Musca domestica L. (Diptera: Muscidae), the housefly, exhibits unique immune defenses and can produce antibacterial substances upon stimulation with bacteria. On the basis of the cDNA library constructed using the suppression subtractive hybridization method, a 1188-bp antibacterial substance gene, which we named AS566, was amplified by rapid amplification of cDNA ends from M. domestica larva stimulated with Salmonella pullorum (Enterobacteriaceae: Salmonella). In this study, the full-length AS566 gene was cloned and inserted into a His-tagged Escherichia coli (Enterobacteriaceae: Escherichia) prokaryotic expression system to enable production of the recombinant protein. The recombinant AS566 protein was purified in denatured form from inclusion bodies and renatured to obtain functionally active AS566 protein. The bacteriostatic activity of the recombinant purified AS566 protein was assessed using the Oxford plate assay system and the results indicated that AS566 had antibacterial activity against six bacteria, including an E. coli clinical isolate, S. pullorum, Streptococcus bovis (Streptococcaceae: Streptococcus), Streptococcus suis, and Staphylococcus aureus (Staphylococcaceae: Staphylococcus) in vitro. The antibacterial activity of AS566 toward Gram- bacteria was two times greater than that against Gram+ bacteria. The sequencing results and BLAST analysis showed that the antibacterial substance gene AS566 was not homologous to any other antibacterial substance genes in GenBank. The antibacterial mechanisms of the newly discovered AS566 protein warrant further study.
TI  - A Study on the Nature of Association between Demodex Mites and Bacteria Involved  in Skin and Meibomian Gland Lesions of Demodectic Mange in Cattle.
AB  - The nature of association between Demodex mites and bacteria involved in bovine demodectic mange lesions and the normal flora inhabiting the skin of noninfected animals was investigated. Demodex bovis and D. ghanensis mites were isolated from the infected purulent material extracted from skin and meibomian gland lesions, respectively. The mites could not be demonstrated in skin brushings or impression smears from the eyes of noninfected cattle. Pathogenic bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A)) and opportunistic organisms (Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Trueperella pyogenes) were isolated from skin lesions of demodectic mange, and Moraxella bovis and Staphylococcus aureus were isolated from meibomian gland lesions. Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A) were isolated from skin brushings from noninfected cattle. The nature of association between Demodex mites and bacteria in demodectic mange lesions is synergistic and of equal significance. Pathogenic and opportunistic bacteria facilitated the establishment of Demodex mites in the lesions produced and provided an excellent microclimate for the mites to propagate and reproduce, resulting in severe and progressive disease. The "high-turnover" granulomatous reaction which characterized the histopathological changes proved that Demodex mites and associated bacteria were persistent and immunogenic.
TI  - Effects of pathogen-specific clinical mastitis on probability of conception in Holstein dairy cows.
AB  - The objective of this study was to estimate the effects of pathogen-specific clinical mastitis (CM), occurring in different weekly intervals before or after artificial insemination (AI), on the probability of conception in Holstein cows. Clinical mastitis occurring in weekly intervals from 6 wk before until 6 wk after AI was modeled. The first 4 AI in a cow's lactation were included. The following categories of pathogens were studied: Streptococcus spp. (comprising Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus uberis, and other Streptococcus spp.); Staphylococcus aureus; coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS); Escherichia coli; Klebsiella spp.; cases with CM signs but no bacterial growth (above the level that can be detected from our microbiological procedures) observed in the culture sample and cases with contamination (>/= 3 pathogens in the sample); and other pathogens [including Citrobacter, yeasts, Trueperella pyogenes, gram-negative bacilli (i.e., gram-negative organisms other than E. coli, Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter, and Citrobacter), Corynebacterium bovis, Corynebacterium spp., Pasteurella, Enterococcus, Pseudomonas, Mycoplasma, Prototheca, and others]. Other factors included in the model were parity (1, 2, 3, 4 and higher), season of AI (winter, spring, summer, autumn), day in lactation of first AI, farm, and other non-CM diseases (retained placenta, metritis, ketosis, displaced abomasum). Data from 90,271 AI in 39,361 lactations in 20,328 cows collected from 2003/2004 to 2011 from 5 New York State dairy farms were analyzed in a generalized linear mixed model with a Poisson distribution. The largest reductions in probability of conception were associated with CM occurring in the week before AI or in the 2 wk following AI. Escherichia coli and Klebsiella spp. had the greatest adverse effects on probability of conception. The probability of conception for a cow with any combination of characteristics may be calculated based on the parameter estimates. These findings may be helpful to farmers in assessing reproduction in their dairy cows for more effective cow management.
TI  - Bovicin HC5 and nisin reduce Staphylococcus aureus adhesion to polystyrene and change the hydrophobicity profile and Gibbs free energy of adhesion.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus is an opportunistic pathogen often multidrug-resistant that not only causes a variety of human diseases, but also is able to survive on biotic and abiotic surfaces through biofilm communities. The best way to inhibit biofilm establishment is to prevent cell adhesion. In the present study, subinhibitory concentrations of the bacteriocins bovicin HC5 and nisin were tested for their capability to interfere with the adhesion of S. aureus to polystyrene. Subinhibitory dosages of the bacteriocins reduced cell adhesion and this occurred probably due to changes in the hydrophobicity of the bacterial cell and polystyrene surfaces. After treatment with bovicin HC5 and nisin, the surfaces became more hydrophilic and the free energy of adhesion (G(adhesion)) between bacteria and the polystyrene surface was unfavorable. The transcriptional level of selected genes was assessed by RT-qPCR approach, revealing that the bacteriocins affected the expression of some important biofilm associated genes (icaD, fnbA, and clfB) and rnaIII, which is involved in the quorum sensing mechanism. The conditioning of food-contact surfaces with bacteriocins can be an innovative and powerful strategy to prevent biofilms in the food industry. The results are relevant for food safety as they indicate that bovicin HC5 and nisin can inhibit bacterial adhesion and consequent biofilm establishment, since cell adhesion precedes biofilm formation.
TI  - Comparison of clinical features of left-sided infective endocarditis involving previously normal versus previously abnormal valves.
AB  - Native valve infective endocarditis (IE) in patients with normal valves has increased in the last decades. Whether patients with normal valves present a similar prognosis to those with pathologic valves is unresolved. Our aim is to describe epidemiologic and clinical differences between patients with left-sided IE and normal valves and those with native pathologic valves. We analyzed 945 consecutive episodes of IE, 435 of which involved left-sided nonprosthetic IE. They were classified into 2 groups: episodes in normal valves (normal group, n=173) and episodes in pathologic valves (abnormal group, n=262). Patients in the normal group were younger, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus bovis were more frequently isolated, and vegetations were more frequently found. Heart failure, septic shock, and the need for surgery or death were more common. Multivariate analysis identified the following as factors independently associated with normal valve IE: age<65 years, S bovis, S aureus, heart failure, and vegetation detection. Factors independently associated with in-hospital events included S aureus, periannular complications, heart failure, and septic shock development. In conclusion, compared with patients with abnormal valve IE, patients with IE on normal valves were younger, had a more virulent microbiological profile, developed heart failure and septic shock more frequently, needed more surgical procedures, and had worse prognosis.
TI  - Antimicrobial constituents and synergism effect of the essential oils from Cymbopogon citratus and Alpinia galanga.
AB  - From the fresh leaf sheathes of lemongrass (Cymbopogon citratus) and rhizomes of  galanga (Alpinia galanga) light yellow and colorless oils, respectively, were obtained by hydrodistillation and microwave assisted extraction (MAE) in yields of 0.24% and 0.03%, and 0.11% and trace (w/w), respectively. By GC/MS analysis, five major constituents were identified in lemongrass oil, E-citral, Z-citral, beta-myrcene, selina-6-en-4-ol, and cis-ocimene, and five in galanga oil, 1,8-cineole, phenol 4-(2-propenyl)-acetate, dl-limonene, alpha-pinene, and a-terpineol. Three major components of the combined lemongrass and galanga oils (ratio 7:3, 1:1, 3:7) were 1,8-cineole (46.3%, 31.5%, 19.3%), E-citral (12.8%, 22.7%, 32.8%) and Z-citral (8.5%, 15.2%, 21.6%). The MICs of lemongrass and galanga oils were: against Staphylococcus aureus 0.5% and 4%, v/v, against Pseudomonas aeruginosa 40% and >40%,v/v, against Streptococcus bovis 0.25% and 0.5%, v/v, and against Candida albicans 0.25% and 0.5%, v/v. Citral (from lemongrass oil) gave greater potentiation than 1,8-cineole (from galanga oil). The combination profiles of galanga oil with lemongrass oil (volume ratios 3:7, 1:1, and 7:3) were tested against the four pathogenic microorganisms. Synergistic activity was best noted for only one ratio (volume ratio 3:7) as the sigmafic< 1 against all tested microorganisms. The present investigation provides evidenc that the utilization of two essential oils in combination should be assessed for synergistic antimicrobial activity in order to reduce their minimum effective dose.
TI  - Trends in diagnosis and control of bovine mastitis: a review.
AB  - Mastitis (inflammation of mammary gland) is a most devastating disease condition  in terms of economic losses occurring throughout the world. The etiological agents may vary from place to place depending on climate; animal species and animal husbandry and include wide variety of gram positive and gram negative bacteria; and fungi. They may be either contagious viz. Staphylococcus aureus; Streptococcus agalactiae or environmental viz. S. dysgalactiae, S. uberis, Corynebacterium bovis and Coagulase negative Staphylococcus. Conventional diagnostic tests viz. California Mastitis Test (CMT); R-mastitest and Mast-O-test methods are applied under field conditions; whereas somatic cell count and Bulk Tank Somatic Cell Count (BTSCC) are useful for early mastitis detection and detection of sub clinical or chronic mastitis respectively. In vitro culture based diagnosis require further study as they can detect only viable cells. The advent of Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) technology along with its various versions like multiplex and real time PCR has improved the rapidity and sensitivity of diagnosis. Circulating micro RNA (miRNA) based diagnosis; immune assay and proteomics based detection along with biochips and biosensors prove to be asset to diagnosticians for advanced diagnosis of this economically important condition. Improvement of milking hygiene; implementation of post-milking teat disinfection; regular control of the milking equipments; implementation of milking order; Improvement of bedding material are the general measures to prevent new cases of mastitis. The use of antibiotics (intramammary infusions; bacteriocins) and herbs (Terminalia spp.) are important for prophylaxis and therapeutics. Vaccines viz. cell based; Recombinant (staphylococcal enterotoxin type C mutant) or chimeric (pauA); live (S. uberis 0140J stain based) and bacterial surface extract based; DNA-based and DNA-protein based have greatly aided in management of bovine mastitis. Quorum sensing and disease resistant breeding using novel biomarkers viz. toll like receptors (TLR) 2 and 4, interleukin (IL) 8; breast cancer type 1 susceptibility protein (BRCA1) and calcium channel voltage-dependent alpha 2/delta sub unit 1 (CACNA2D1) are also indispensable. This mini review gives an overview of all these different aspects that act as trend setters as far as the diagnosis and control of bovine mastitis is concerned to help the diagnosticians; epidemiologists and researchers not to remain ignorant about this grave condition.
TI  - Cost-effectiveness of diagnostic strategies using quantitative real-time PCR and  bacterial culture to identify contagious mastitis cases in large dairy herds.
AB  - Diagnostic strategies to detect contagious mastitis caused by Mycoplasma bovis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus agalactiae in dairy herds during an outbreak have been minimally studied with regard to cost and diagnostic sensitivity. The objective of this cross-sectional study was to compare the cost-effectiveness of diagnostic strategies for identification of infected cows in two California dairy herds during contagious mastitis outbreaks. M. bovis was investigated in a subset of a herd (n=1210 cows) with an estimated prevalence of 2.8% (95% CI=1.9, 3.7), whereas Staph. aureus and Strep. agalactiae were studied in a second herd (n=351 cows) with an estimated prevalence of 3.4% (95% CI=1.5, 5.3) and 16.8% (95% CI=12.9, 20.7), respectively. Diagnostic strategies involved a combination of testing stages that utilized bacterial culture, quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR), or both. Strategies were applied to individual or pooled samples of 5, 10, 50 or 100 samples. Culture was considered the gold standard for sensitivity estimation of each strategy. The reference strategy was the strategy with the lowest cost per culture-positive cow which for both M. bovis and Strep. agalactiae consisted of 2 stages, culture of samples in pools of 5 followed by culture of individual samples in positive pools with a sensitivity of 73.5% (95% CI: 55.6, 87.1) and 96.6% (95% CI: 27.7, 84.8), respectively. The reference strategy for Staph. aureus consisted of 3 stages, culture of individual samples in pools of 100 (stage 1), culture constituents of those positive from stage 1 in pools of 5 (stage 2), culture constituents of those positive from stage 2 individually (stage 3) which resulted in a sensitivity of 58.3% (95% CI: 88.3, 99.6). The most cost-effective alternative to the reference strategy was whole herd milk culture for all 3 pathogens. QPCR testing was a component of the second most cost-effective alternative for M. bovis and the third most cost-effective alternatives for the 3 pathogens. A stochastic model was used to assess the effect of prevalence or herd size on the cost-effectiveness of diagnostic strategies. In the current study, increasing the prevalence of mastitis did not alter the ranking of strategies by cost-effectiveness. However, larger herds could benefit from testing larger pools such as 50 or 100 samples to improve cost-effectiveness. Several diagnostic strategy options exist to identify contagious mastitis in herds, decisions should be based on cost and sensitivity of the strategies available.
TI  - Pathogen-specific effects on milk yield in repeated clinical mastitis episodes in Holstein dairy cows.
AB  - The objective of this study was to estimate the effects of clinical mastitis (CM) cases due to different pathogens on milk yield in Holstein cows. The first 3 CM cases in a cow's lactation were modeled. Eight categories of pathogens were included: Streptococcus spp.; Staphylococcus aureus; coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS); Escherichia coli; Klebsiella spp.; cases with CM signs but no bacterial growth (above the level detectable by our microbiological procedures) observed in the culture sample, and cases with contamination (>/= 3 pathogens in the sample); other pathogens that may be treated with antibiotics (included Citrobacter, Corynebacterium bovis, Enterobacter, Enterococcus, Pasteurella, Pseudomonas; "other treatable"); and other pathogens not successfully treated with antibiotics (Trueperella pyogenes, Mycoplasma, Prototheca, yeasts; "other not treatable"). Data from 38,276 lactations in cows from 5 New York State dairy herds, collected from 2003-2004 until 2011, were analyzed. Mixed models with an autoregressive correlation structure (to account for correlation among the repeated measures of milk yield within a lactation) were estimated. Primiparous (lactation 1) and multiparous (lactations 2 and 3) cows were analyzed separately, as the shapes of their lactation curves differed. Primiparas were followed for up to 48 wk of lactation and multiparas for up to 44 wk. Fixed effects included parity, calving season, week of lactation, CM (type, case number, and timing of CM in relation to milk production cycle), and other diseases (milk fever, retained placenta, metritis, ketosis, displaced abomasum). Herd was modeled as a random effect. Clinical mastitis was more common in multiparas than in primiparas. In primiparas, Streptococcus spp. occurred most frequently as the first case. In multiparas, E. coli was most common as the first case. In subsequent cases, CM cases with no specific growth or contamination were most common in both parity groups. The hazard of CM increased with case number. Mastitic cows were generally higher producers before the CM episode than their nonmastitic herdmates. Milk loss varied with pathogen and case number. In primiparas, the greatest losses were associated with E. coli and "other not treatable" organisms. In multiparas, the greatest losses were associated with Klebsiella spp. and "other not treatable" organisms. Milk loss was not associated with occurrence of CNS. The findings may help farmers to make optimal management decisions for their cows.
TI  - A new plant-derived antibacterial is an inhibitor of efflux pumps in Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - An in-depth evaluation was undertaken of a new antibacterial natural product (1)  recently isolated and characterised from the plant Hypericum olympicum L. cf. uniflorum. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined for a panel of bacteria, including: meticillin-resistant and -susceptible strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus; vancomycin-resistant and -susceptible Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium; penicillin-resistant and -susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae; group A streptococci (Streptococcus pyogenes); and Clostridium difficile. MICs were 2-8 mg/L for most staphylococci and all enterococci, but were >/=16 mg/L for S. haemolyticus and were >32 mg/L for all species in the presence of blood. Compound 1 was also tested against Gram-negative bacteria, including Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium but was inactive. The MIC for Mycobacterium bovis BCG was 60 mg/L, and compound 1 inhibited the ATP-dependent Mycobacterium tuberculosis MurE ligase [50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) = 75 muM]. In a radiometric accumulation assay with a strain of S. aureus overexpressing the NorA multidrug efflux pump, the presence of compound 1 increased accumulation of (14)C-enoxacin in a concentration-dependent manner, implying inhibition of efflux. Only moderate cytotoxicity was observed, with IC50 values of 12.5, 10.5 and 8.9 muM against human breast, lung and fibroblast cell lines, respectively, highlighting the potential value of this chemotype as a new antibacterial agent and efflux pump inhibitor.
TI  - Evaluation of the nanosphere verigene gram-positive blood culture assay with the  VersaTREK blood culture system and assessment of possible impact on selected patients.
AB  - The Verigene Gram-positive blood culture (BC-GP) assay (Nanosphere, Northbrook, IL) is a molecular method for the rapid identification of Gram-positive organisms and resistance markers directly from blood culture bottles. A total of 148 VersaTREK REDOX 1 40-ml aerobic bottles demonstrating Gram-positive bacteria were tested. Results were compared with those from conventional biochemical and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) identifications. We obtained isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (24), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) (14), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) (17), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus epidermidis (MSSE) (9), other coagulase-negative staphylococci (19), Streptococcus salivarius (5), Streptococcus parasanguinis (2), Streptococcus sanguinis (1), Streptococcus cristatus (1), the Streptococcus bovis group (5), Streptococcus agalactiae (9), the Streptococcus anginosus group (1), Streptococcus pneumoniae (6), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE FCM) (16), vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis (3), Aerococcus viridans (2), Bacillus (6), Corynebacterium (8), Lactobacillus (2), Micrococcus (2), Neisseria mucosa (1), Escherichia coli (3), Candida tropicalis (1), Propionibacterium (1), and Rothia (1). Overall agreement with the culture results was 95%. A total of 137 of 138 (99%) monomicrobial cultures were concordant. We tested 9 polymicrobial samples and found 33% agreement. A chart review of 31 patients with MRSA, MSSA, or VRE demonstrated that the Nanosphere BC-GP assay might have led to more appropriate antibiotic selection for these patients an average of 42 h earlier. Additionally, contact isolation could have been initiated an average of 37 h earlier for patients with MRSA or VRE. The BC-GP assay may have a positive impact on patient care, health care costs, and antibiotic stewardship.
TI  - Systemic prepartum treatment of end-term dairy heifers with penethamate hydriodide: effect on udder health, milk yield, and culling until 120 days in milk.
AB  - Prepartum intramammary treatment with antimicrobials of end-term dairy heifers has frequently been proposed as a practice to reduce the prevalence of intramammary infections (IMI) at calving. From a safety standpoint for both animal and administrator, systemic treatment is preferred. A clinical trial was conducted on heifers from 10 well-managed, commercial dairy farms with a low prevalence of heifer mastitis. The aim was to assess both the short- and long-term effects of a systemic prepartum therapy with penethamate hydriodide on udder health and milk production. Because it was hypothesized that some herds would benefit more from this treatment than others, specific herd-level information was collected before the start of the actual trial to screen for and explain potential herd-specific treatment effects. Further, the effect of treatment on antimicrobial susceptibility of staphylococcal isolates was monitored. End-term heifers were either treated systemically (over 3 consecutive days) 2 wk before expected calving date with penethamate hydriodide (n=76) or remained untreated (n=73). Systemic prepartum treatment of end-term heifers with penethamate hydriodide resulted in fewer IMI in early lactation. However, all 6 cases of clinical mastitis in early lactation occurred in the treatment group [Streptococcus uberis (n=1), Corynebacterium bovis (n=1), Staphylococcus aureus (n=1); 1 sample was contaminated; 2 samples remained culture negative]. No long-term treatment effects (from 4 to 120 d in milk) on milk production, udder health, or culling hazard during later lactation were detected, although treated heifers belonging to herds classified as having low-yielding heifers out-produced the control heifers. Moreover, penicillin susceptibility of staphylococci isolated from milk samples of treated or control heifers did not differ. Herds with a low prevalence of heifer mastitis are not likely to benefit from prepartum systemic antimicrobial treatment of the end-term heifers.
TI  - Rapid mastitis detection assay on porous nitrocellulose membrane slides.
AB  - We have developed a rapid mastitis detection test based on the immobilization of  tag-specific antibody molecules, the binding of double-tagged amplicons, and as a secondary signal a conjugate of black carbon nanoparticles having molecules of a fusion protein of neutrAvidin and alkaline phosphatase at their surface. The antibodies were inkjet printed onto three different nitrocellulose membrane slides, Unisart (Sartorius), FAST (GE Whatman), and Oncyte-Avid (Grace-Biolabs), and the final assay signals on these slides were compared. The blackness of the spots was determined by flatbed scanning and assessment of the pixel gray volume using TotalLab image analysis software. The black spots could be easily read by the naked eye. We successfully demonstrated the detection of specific amplicons from mastitis-causing pathogens in less than 3 h. Using a similar protocol, we also showed that it was possible to detect specific amplicons from four different mastitis-causing pathogens (six strains) on the same pad. The influence of two different printing buffers, phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) and carbonate buffer (pH 9.6), on the functionality of the primary antibodies was also compared.
TI  - Particularities in diagnosis and treatment for infectious endocarditis in children.
AB  - Infectious endocarditis (IE) represents a rare pathology in children, but with lethal potential. The goal of the therapy is fast and total eradication of the infection. AIMS: To study particularities in diagnosis and treatment for infectious endocarditis in children. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Children with infectious endocarditis hospitalized between January 2007 - February 2012 in the Cardiology Department of the ,,Sfanta Maria" Children Emergency Hospital of lasi have been included in the study. RESULTS: The patients are aged between 23 days and 16 years, the average age being 4 years old. At approximately 88% of the patients (14 cases), the endocardial damage appeared in the pre-existent valvular lesions, specially mitral and aortal. As associated congenital malformations, the patients prevailingly presented ventricular septal defect, mitral valve prolapse, arterial canal persistence, aortic stenosis, coarctation of the aorta. Blood cultures were collected and the most frequent identified etiological agents were: Staphylococcus coagulase-positive, Streptococcus mitis, Staphylococcus speciae coagulase-negative, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Streptococcus bovis, Escherichia coli, for which the antibiogram showed sensitivity for beta-lactam, cephalosporins, glycopeptides, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, rifampicin, quinolone, lincosamides, oxazolidinones, and thus specific treatment was set up according to the antibiogram. CONCLUSIONS: The infectious endocarditis is a serious disease that affects young age too, leading towards exitus in some cases. Diagnostic imaging and early blood cultures are of relevance in order to intervene promptly. The treatment must be targeted and applied as fast as possible.
TI  - Molecular characterization of alpha-amylase from Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus is one of the prominent Gram positive human pathogen secretes many surface and secretary proteins including various enzymes and pathogenic factors that favour the successful colonization and infection of host tissue. alpha-amylase is one of the enzymes secreted by S. aureus which catalyses the breakdown of complex sugars to monosaccharides, which are required for colonization and survival of this pathogen in any anatomical locales. In the present study we have cloned, sequenced, expressed and characterized alpha-amylase gene from S. aureus ATCC12600. The recombinant enzyme has a molecular weight of 58kDa and the kinetics showed Vmax 0.0208+/-0.033 (mg/ml)/mg/min and Km 10.633+/-0.737mg/ml. The multiple sequence analysis showed alpha- amylase of S. aureus exhibited large differences with Bacillus subtilis and Streptococcus bovis. As the crystal structure of S. aureus alpha- amylase was unavailable, we used homology modelling method to build the structure. The built structure was validated by Ramachandran plot which showed 90% of the residues in the allowed region while no residue was found in the disallowed region and the built structure was close to the crystal structure with Z-Score: -6.85. The structural superimposition studies with alpha- amylases of Bacillus subtilis and Streptococcus bovis showed distinct differences with RMSD values of 18.158Aand 7.091A respectively which correlated with enzyme kinetics, indicating alpha-amylase is different among these bacteria.
TI  - Effect on quarter milk somatic cell count and antimicrobial susceptibility of Staphylococcus rostri causing intramammary infection in dairy water buffaloes.
AB  - In many parts of the world, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) are the predominant cause of intramammary infections (IMI) in dairy cows and in water buffaloes, as well. A longitudinal field study was carried out on one well-managed dairy water buffalo herd to determine the prevalence and distribution of CNS and a recently described CNS-species, Staphylococcus rostri, in milk samples to explore its relevance for buffaloes' udder health throughout lactation, and to gain insight into the susceptibility of the latter species toward commonly used antimicrobials. Twice weekly quarter milk samples from a cohort of 11 lactating water buffaloes were collected over an 8-mo period. The CNS (n=109; 76.2% of all culture-positive samples) were the predominant pathogens causing IMI, followed by Corynebacterium bovis (n=11; 7.6%) and Streptococcus spp. (n=9; 6.2%) other than Stretococcus uberis (n=2; 1.4%). Thirty-seven hemolytic staphylococci suspected to be Staphylococcus aureus were further differentiated using transfer DNA-intergenic spacer-PCR and rpoB-gene sequencing because they were coagulase-negative. Thirty-three of those isolates were identified as Staph. rostri, whereas 2 others were identified as Staphylococcus epidermidis. None of the Staph. rostri isolates displayed resistance to the antimicrobial agents tested. Mean quarter milk somatic cell count (qSCC) of all samples collected throughout lactation was 20,970 cells/mL. The qSCC at sampling of quarters infected with Staph. rostri (34,466 cells/mL) and CNS other than Staph. rostri (34,813 cells/mL) were significantly higher than the qSCC of noninfected quarters (20,287 cells/mL), yet not significantly different from each other. These findings provide novel insight into the prevalence and distribution, antimicrobial susceptibility, and relevance of Staph. rostri compared with other CNS species causing IMI in water buffaloes. Further studies are needed to pinpoint the relevance, niches, and transmission routes of Staph. rostri, as well as other CNS in water buffaloes.
TI  - Milk haptoglobin, milk amyloid A, and N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase activity in bovines with naturally occurring clinical mastitis diagnosed with a quantitative PCR test.
AB  - The associations between quantitative bacteriological results from a real-time PCR test and concentrations of acute-phase proteins (APP) and N-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase (NAGase) activity in milk in naturally occurring clinical mastitis were investigated. Milk APP concentrations and NAGase activity in clinical mastitis caused by different udder pathogens were studied. The associations between the severity of the clinical signs and concentrations of APP and NAGase activity were estimated. Milk samples from 281 cases of clinical mastitis were collected from 3 Estonian dairy farms and analyzed by PCR to identify pathogens. Twenty-seven samples out of 281 (9.6%) were PCR negative. Milk samples containing 4 or more bacterial species (n=28) were considered possibly contaminated and excluded from all further analyses. In total, 443 bacterial identifications were made from the remaining 226 milk samples. A single bacterial species was detected in 68 samples (30.1%), 2 species were detected in 99 samples (43.8%), and 3 species were detected in 59 (26.1%) samples. To determine the inflammatory response in the udder, the concentrations of milk amyloid A (MAA) and haptoglobin (Hp) and NAGase activity in the milk were analyzed. A significant positive association was found between the severity of the clinical signs and inflammatory markers in the milk. Milk amyloid A and Hp concentrations and NAGase activity were significantly higher in samples with large quantities of bacterial DNA from Escherichia coli or Streptococcus dysgalactiae compared with milk samples not containing those species. Large quantities of bacterial DNA from Trueperella pyogenes or Streptococcus uberis in the milk were associated with elevated concentrations of Hp and high NAGase activity, but not with increased MAA concentrations. Milk samples containing Corynebacterium bovis and coagulase-negative staphylococci had significantly lower concentrations of MAA and Hp and lower NAGase activity compared with samples where these species were not detected. It can be concluded that concentrations of APP and NAGase activity in the milk were associated with the quantity of bacterial DNA in the milk samples.
TI  - Relationship between concentration of lingual antimicrobial peptide and somatic cell count in milk of dairy cows.
AB  - Lingual antimicrobial peptide (LAP) belongs to the beta-defensin family in cattle and is found in milk. LAP concentrations increase in milk from mastitic udders; however, the relationship between LAP concentrations and the somatic cell count (SCC) in milk remains to be elucidated in detail. Therefore, the present study was undertaken to investigate the relationship between LAP concentrations and the SCC in bovine milk to assess whether LAP may be used as an indicator of SCC. Milk was collected from 66 udders showing various SCCs. The SCC and LAP concentrations were measured in the milk. A significantly higher LAP concentration was observed in milk having 500-5000 x 10(3)cells/ml and >5000 x 10(3)cells/ml SCC groups than in lower SCC groups (<50 x 10(3)cells/ml and 50-500 x 10(3)cells/ml). A significantly positive correlation between LAP concentrations and SCCs in milk was observed (r=0.68). In milk samples with >26 nM of LAP, 92.0% of milk samples had high SCCs (>200 x 10(3)cells/ml). The concentration of LAP in milk infected with Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus bovis, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, and Escherichia coli was significantly higher than that in uninfected milk. These results suggest that the concentration of LAP can be a useful indicator of the SCC in dairy cows.
TI  - Mastitis diagnosis in dairy cows using PathoProof real-time polymerase chain reaction assay in comparison with conventional bacterial culture in a Northern German field study.
AB  - In the following field study, the commercial PathoProof Mastitis PCR Assay, a real-time PCR for identifying eleven mastitis pathogens and the staphylococcal beta-lactamase gene, was compared with conventional bacterial culture. For this purpose, 681 udder quarter samples from 173 clinically healthy cows with varying somatic cell count from four dairy herds in the region of Osnabruck, Lower Saxony, Germany, were collected between July 2010 and February 2011 and subjected to PCR and bacterial culture. The frequency of positive pathogen signals was markedly higher with PCR compared with culture (70.6% vs. 32.2%). This was accompanied by a substantial higher percentage of multiple pathogen identifications and a lower percentage of single identifications in the PCR compared with bacterial culture. Using bacterial culture as gold standard, moderate to high sensitivities (76.9-100%) and specificities (63.3-98.7%) were calculated for six out of seven pathogens with sufficient detection numbers. For Enterococcus spp, the sensitivity was only 9.1%. When the PCR results of pooled udder quarter samples of the 173 cows were compared with the single udder quarter samples, in 72% of the cases, major pathogen DNA was either not found in both types of samples, or in the case of a positive pool sample, the respective pathogens were found in at least one udder quarter sample. With both methods, the most frequently detected mastitis pathogens were coryneform bacteria (PCR: Corynebacterium bovis), coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) and Staphylococcus (S.) aureus, followed by Arcanobacterium pyogenes/Peptoniphilus indolicus with PCR, and then with both methods, Streptococcus uberis. The staphylococcal beta-lactamase gene was found in 27.7% of the S. aureus and in 37.0% of the CNS identifications.
TI  - Proteolytic activity by multiple bacterial species isolated from chronic venous leg ulcers degrades matrix substrates.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A major feature of chronic wounds is the loss of tissue, with the exposure of dermal components preventing primary closure and leading to bacterial colonization. Bacterial colonization has been proposed as one of the common underlying pathologies present in chronic wounds. The objective of this exploratory study was to identify bacteria cultured from chronic venous leg ulcers and test for proteolytic activity that degrades matrix substrates. METHOD: Bacteria were isolated, cultured, and identified from six subjects (average age = 62.8 years) over 2-10 months under an approved protocol using swabs and microbiological culture media. Proteolytic activity against (a) gelatin, (b) an elastin substrate, and (c) a serine/trypsin-sensitive substrate was determined using a colorimetric plate assay with an ELISA plate reader and zymography. RESULTS: We identified 13 bacteria that expressed proteolytic activity against one or more of the tested substrates. Of these, six were Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus agalactiae, Corynebacterium, and Streptococcus bovis) and seven were Gram-negative (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Bacteroides fragilis, and Serratia marcescens) organisms. Two of these, S. aureus and P. aeruginosa, are recognized wound pathogens. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple bacteria species isolated from colonized venous leg ulcers have the capacity to secrete proteases capable of degrading components of the extracellular matrix important for wound healing. Matrix degradation by bacteria may contribute to delays in tissue deposition and repair, suggesting that treatment of chronic wounds should include appropriate management of colonizing bacteria.
TI  - Lipopeptide biosurfactants from Paenibacillus polymyxa inhibit single and mixed species biofilms.
AB  - Although biofilms are recognised as important in microbial colonisation, solutions to their inhibition are predominantly based on planktonic assays. These solutions have limited efficacy against biofilms. Here, a series of biofilm-orientated tests were used to identify anti-biofilm compounds from marine micro-flora. This led to the isolation of a complex of anti-biofilm compounds from an extract of Paenibacillus polymyxa (PPE). A combination of rpHPLC and mass spectrometry identified the principle components of PPE as fusaricidin B (LI-FO4b) and polymyxin D1, with minor contributions from surfactins. This complex (PPE) reduced the biofilm biomass of Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus bovis. In contrast, ampicillin was only effective against S. aureus. PPE also inhibited a self-assembling marine biofilm (SAMB) in co-incubation assays by 99.3% +/- 1.9 and disrupted established SAMB by 72.4% +/- 4.4, while ampicillin showed no significant reduction. The effectiveness of this complex of lipopeptides against single and multispecies biofilms suggests a future role in biofilm prevention strategies.
TI  - Genetic and biochemical characterization of an acquired subgroup B3 metallo-beta-lactamase gene, blaAIM-1, and its unique genetic context in Pseudomonas aeruginosa from Australia.
AB  - Three clinical Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates (WCH2677, WCH2813, and WCH2837) isolated from the Women's and Children's Hospital, Adelaide, Australia, produced a metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL)-positive Etest result. All isolates were PCR negative for known MBL genes. A gene bank was created, and an MBL gene, designated bla(AIM-1), was cloned and fully characterized. The encoded enzyme, AIM-1, is a group B3 MBL that has the highest level of identity to THIN-B and L1. It is chromosomal and flanked by two copies (one intact and one truncated) of an ISCR element, ISCR15. Southern hybridization studies indicated the movement of both ISCR15 and bla(AIM-1) within the three different clinical isolates. AIM-1 hydrolyzes most beta-lactams, with the exception of aztreonam and, to a lesser extent, ceftazidime; however, it possesses significantly higher k(cat) values for cefepime and carbapenems than most other MBLs. AIM-1 was the first mobile group B3 enzyme detected and signals further problems for already beleaguered antimicrobial regimes to treat serious P. aeruginosa and other Gram-negative infections.
TI  - Examining the effect of intramammary infections with minor mastitis pathogens on  the acquisition of new intramammary infections with major mastitis pathogens--a systematic review and meta-analysis.
AB  - Major mastitis pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus uberis, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, and the coliforms are usually considered more virulent and damaging to the udder than minor mastitis pathogens such as Corynebacterium bovis and coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS). The current literature contains several studies detailing analyses with conflicting results as to whether intramammary infection (IMI) with the minor pathogens decreases, increases, or has no effect on the risk of a quarter acquiring a new intramammary infection (NIMI) with a major pathogen. To investigate the available scientific evidence regarding the effect of IMI with minor pathogens on the acquisition of NIMI with major pathogens, a systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted. The total extant English- and French-language literature in electronic databases was searched and all publications cited by relevant papers were investigated. Results from 68 studies were extracted from 38 relevant papers. Random-effects models were used to investigate the effects of CNS and C. bovis on acquisition of new IMI with any of the major pathogens, as well as individually for the minor pathogens and Staph. aureus. Significant heterogeneity among studies exists, some of which could be accounted for by using meta-regression. Overall, observational studies showed no effect, whereas challenge studies showed strong and significant protective effects, specifically when major pathogens were introduced into the mammary gland via methods bypassing the teat end. Underlying risk can account for several unmeasured factors, and studies with higher underlying risk found more protective effects of minor pathogens. Larger doses of challenge organisms reduced the protective effect of minor pathogens, and studies with more stringent diagnostic criteria for pathogen IMI identified less protection. Smaller studies (those utilizing fewer than 40 cows) also showed a greater protective effect than larger studies.
TI  - Investigating clustering in interval-censored udder quarter infection times in dairy cows using a gamma frailty model.
AB  - Udder infections in dairy cows are observed at udder quarter level. Therefore, the best strategy to study infection dynamics of particular bacteria causing mastitis is to follow up and model individual udder quarter infection times. Udder quarter infection times, however, are not independent as they are clustered within a cow and herds. Another challenge in modelling infection times is that the exact infection time is unknown; it is only known that the infection has taken place in the interval between the last negative and the first positive sample. We applied a technique based on the gamma frailty model which handles the clustering and interval censoring simultaneously. Parameter estimates can be obtained analytically and their variance is obtained by the inverse of the hessian matrix. The proposed technique was applied to udder quarter infection times for Corynebacterium bovis, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus uberis. Multiparous cows were more likely to get infected earlier in lactation with C. bovis or S. uberis than primiparous cows. The times to infection of all three bacteria were highly clustered at cow level and the results of a stratified model on a subset of herds suggested a high clustering on herd level for C. bovis and S. uberis.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of sphingoid bases and fatty acids against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - There is growing evidence that the role of lipids in innate immunity is more important than previously realized. How lipids interact with bacteria to achieve a level of protection, however, is still poorly understood. To begin to address the mechanisms of antibacterial activity, we determined MICs and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) of lipids common to the skin and oral cavity--the sphingoid bases D-sphingosine, phytosphingosine, and dihydrosphingosine and the fatty acids sapienic acid and lauric acid--against four Gram-negative bacteria and seven Gram-positive bacteria. Exact Kruskal-Wallis tests of these values showed differences among lipid treatments (P < 0.0001) for each bacterial species except Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. D-sphingosine (MBC range, 0.3 to 19.6 mug/ml), dihydrosphingosine (MBC range, 0.6 to 39.1 mug/ml), and phytosphingosine (MBC range, 3.3 to 62.5 mug/ml) were active against all bacteria except S. marcescens and P. aeruginosa (MBC > 500 mug/ml). Sapienic acid (MBC range, 31.3 to 375.0 mug/ml) was active against Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus mitis, and Fusobacterium nucleatum but not active against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, S. marcescens, P. aeruginosa, Corynebacterium bovis, Corynebacterium striatum, and Corynebacterium jeikeium (MBC > 500 mug/ml). Lauric acid (MBC range, 6.8 to 375.0 mug/ml) was active against all bacteria except E. coli, S. marcescens, and P. aeruginosa (MBC > 500 mug/ml). Complete killing was achieved as early as 0.5 h for some lipids but took as long as 24 h for others. Hence, sphingoid bases and fatty acids have different antibacterial activities and may have potential for prophylactic or therapeutic intervention in infection.
TI  - Survey of marbofloxacin susceptibility of bacteria isolated from cattle with respiratory disease and mastitis in Europe.
AB  - A monitoring programme conducted in Europe since 1994 to survey the marbofloxacin susceptibility of bacterial pathogens isolated from cattle has established the susceptibility of bacterial strains isolated before any antibiotic treatment from bovine mastitis and bovine respiratory disease (BRD) cases between 2002 and 2008. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined by a standardised microdilution technique. For respiratory pathogens, Pasteurella multocida and Mannheimia haemolytica isolates (751 and 514 strains, respectively) were highly susceptible to marbofloxacin (MIC</=0.03 microg/ml for 77.39 per cent of the strains) and only 1.75 per cent of M haemolytica strains were resistant (MIC>/=4 microg/ml). Histophilus somni isolates (73 strains) were highly susceptible to marbofloxacin (0.008 to 0.06 microg/ml). Mycoplasma bovis MIC (171 strains) ranged from 0.5 to 4 microg/ml. For mastitis pathogens, the majority of Escherichia coli isolates were highly susceptible to marbofloxacin (95.8 per cent of 617 strains). Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci (568 and 280 strains) had a homogenous population with MIC centred on 0.25 microg/ml. Streptococcus uberis and Streptococcus dysgalactiae (660 and 217 strains) were moderately susceptible with MIC centred on 1 microg/ml. Marbofloxacin MIC for these various pathogens appeared stable over the seven years of the monitoring programme and was similar to previously published MIC results.
TI  - Rapid identification of bovine mastitis pathogens by high-resolution melt analysis of 16S rDNA sequences.
AB  - Accurate identification of mastitis pathogens is often compromised when using conventional culture-based methods. Here, we report a novel, rapid assay tested for speciation of bacterial mastitis pathogens using high-resolution melt analysis (HRMA) of 16S rDNA sequences. Real-time PCR amplification of 16S rRNA gene fragment, spanning the variable region V5 and V6 was performed with a resulting amplicon of 290bp. First, a library was generated of melt curves of 9 common pathogens that are implicated in bovine mastitis. Six of the isolates, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus agalactiae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus uberis, Staphylococcus aureus and Mycoplasma bovis, were type strains while the other 3, Arcanobacterium pyogenes, Corynebacterium bovis and Streptococcus dysgalactiae, were bovine mastitis field isolates. Four of the type strains, E. coli, S. agalactiae, K. pneumoniae and S. aureus, were found to be of human origin, while the other 3 type strains were isolated from bovine infections. Secondly, the melt curves and corresponding amplicon sequences of A. pyogenes, E. coli, S. agalactiae, S. dysgalactiae, K. pneumoniae, S. uberis and S. aureus were compared with 10 bovine mastitis field isolates of each pathogen. Based on the distinct differences in melt curves and sequences between human and bovine isolates of E. coli and K. pneumoniae, it was deemed necessary to select a set of bovine strains for these pathogens to be used as reference strains in the HRMA. Next, the HRMA was validated by three interpreters analyzing the differential clustering pattern of melt curves of 60 bacterial cultures obtained from mastitis milk samples. The three test interpreters were blinded to the culture and sequencing results of the isolates. Overall accuracy of the validation assay was 95% as there was difficulty in identifying the streptococci due to heterogeneity observed in the PCR amplicons of S. uberis. The present study revealed that broad-range real-time PCR with HRMA can be used as a powerful, fast and low-cost tool for the differentiation of clinically important bacterial mastitis pathogens.
TI  - The effect of recurrent episodes of clinical mastitis caused by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and other organisms on mortality and culling in Holstein dairy cows.
AB  - The objective of this study was to estimate the effects of recurrent episodes of  different types of clinical mastitis (CM) caused by gram-positive (Streptococcus spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus spp.) and gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Citrobacter, Enterobacter, Pseudomonas) bacteria, and other organisms (Arcanobacterium pyogenes, Mycoplasma, Corynebacterium bovis, yeast, miscellaneous) on the probability of mortality and culling in Holstein dairy cows. Data from 30,233 lactations in cows of 7 dairy farms in New York State were analyzed. Cows were followed for the first 10 mo in lactation, or until death or culling occurred, or until the end of our study period. Generalized linear mixed models with a Poisson error distribution were used to study the effects of recurrent cases of the different types of CM and several other factors (herd, parity, month of lactation, current year and season, profitability, net replacement cost, other diseases) on cows' probability of death (model 1) or being culled (model 2). Primiparous and multiparous cows were modeled separately because they had different risks of mortality and culling and potentially different CM effects on mortality and culling. Approximately 30% of multiparous cows had at least one case of CM in lactation compared with 16.6% of primiparous cows. Multipara also had higher lactational incidence risks of second (10.7%) and third (4.4%) cases than primipara (3.7% and 1.1%, respectively). For primipara, CM increased the probability of death, with each successive case occurring in a month being increasingly lethal. In multipara, gram-negative CM increased the probability of death, especially when the gram-negative case was the first or second CM case in lactation. Primiparous cows with CM were more likely to be culled after CM than if they did not have CM, particularly after a second or third case. In multipara, any type of CM increased the probability of being culled. Gram-negative CM cases were associated with the numerically highest risk of culling.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of daptomycin tested against gram-positive strains collected in European hospitals: results from 7 years of resistance surveillance (2003-2009).
AB  - Daptomycin is a cyclic lipopeptide approved by the European medicines Agency (EMEA) for the treatment of complicated skin and soft tissue infections (cSSTI) and Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia and endocarditis. We evaluated the in vitro activity of daptomycin and comparators tested against clinical isolates from european hospitals over a 7-year period (2003-2009). A total of 36,769 consecutive isolates were collected in 34 medical centers located in 13 European countries, Turkey and Israel. the collection included S. aureus (18,352; 27.2% oxacillin-resistant [MRSA]); coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS; 6,874), Enterococcus spp. (7,241; 9.4% vancomycin-resistant), beta-hemolytic (3,009), viridans group streptococci (1,176), and Streptococcus bovis/gallolyticus (107). The organisms were isolated mainly from patients with bloodstream infection (56%) or cSSTI (23%). Daptomycin was very active against S. aureus and CoNS (MIC(50/90), 0.25/0.5 mg/l for both organisms), and its activity was not adversely influenced by oxacillin resistance. All Enterococcus faecalis strains were susceptible to daptomycin (MIC(50/90), 1/1 mg/l). Daptomycin (MIC(50/90), 2/2 mg/l; 100.0% susceptible) and linezolid (MIC(50/90), 1/2 mg/l; 99.7% susceptible) were the most active agents tested against vancomycin-resistant E. faecium. Vancomycin- resistant and -susceptible enterococcal strains were equally susceptible to daptomycin. Daptomycin was also active against beta-hemolytic streptococci (MIC(50/90), 0.06/0.25 mg/l; 100.0% susceptible), viridans group streptococci (MIC(50/90), 0.25/0.5 mg/l; 99.8% susceptible) and S. bovis (MIC(50/90), 0.06/0.12 mg/l; 100.0% susceptible).In summary, daptomycin was very potent against this large collection (36,769) of Gram-positive organisms isolated in european hospitals, and its activity remained stable across the 7-year period evaluated (2003-2009), using reference methods and interpretive criteria. Decreases in daptomycin potency were not observed since EMEA approval and widespread clinical use, and emerging resistance to other compounds did not adversely influence daptomycin activity against contemporary Gram-positive species.
TI  - Efficacy and safety of outpatient parenteral antibiotic therapy for infective endocarditis: a ten-year prospective study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The length of treatment of infective endocarditis (IE) with parenteral antibiotics varies from 2 to 6 weeks. Although several studies indicate that outpatient parenteral antibiotic treatment (OPAT) could be safe for uncomplicated viridans-group streptococci (VGS) IE, the experience in Spain is limited and data on other types of endocarditis and OPAT are scarce worldwide. METHODS: Prospective single center study of a cohort including all patients with IE admitted to the Hospital Clinic of Barcelona OPAT program from January 1997 to December 2006. RESULTS: During the study period, 392 consecutive episodes of IE in non-drug abusers were attended to. Of these, 73 episodes (42 native-valve, 23 prosthetic-valve, and 8 pacemaker-lead) were admitted to the OPAT program (19%). The percentage of inclusion was higher for viridans group streptococci (VGS) or Streptococcus bovis (S. bovis) IE (32% of all VGS or S. bovis IE episodes diagnosed vs. 14% of the remaining etiologies, P<.001). Twelve patients (16%) were readmitted due to complications, of which 3 died (4%). Glycopeptides use was the only predictor factor of hospital readmission (OR 4.5, 95% confidence interval 1.2; 16.8, P=.026). No differences in OPAT outcome were found between VGS plus S. bovis IE and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) plus coagulase-negative staphylococci IE. Patients spent a median of 17 day on OPAT (interquartile range 11-26.5), which enabled 1,466 days of hospital stay to be saved. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that OPAT for IE may be a safe and effective therapeutic approach in the treatment of selected patients with types of endocarditis other than uncomplicated VGS or S. bovis endocarditis, although patients taking glycopeptides need close clinical OPAT monitoring.
TI  - Diagnosis of intramammary infection in samples yielding negative results or minor pathogens in conventional bacterial culturing.
AB  - Up to half of quarter milk samples submitted for mastitis diagnosis are culture-negative results or lead to identification of coagulase-negative staphylococci or Corynebacterium bovis in conventional culturing, the so-called minor pathogens. The interpretation and usefulness of these results in terms of udder and animal health management is limited, even though the amount of resources spent is relatively high. This work aimed to test two methods of analysis of milk samples with the goal of increasing detection of intramammary pathogens. In the first study, 783 milk samples were processed in duplicate: before and after freezing at -20 degrees C for 24 h, using standard bacteriological techniques. There was a significant difference between the two methods with samples frozen for 24 h yielding significantly fewer Gram-positive catalase-positive cocci, Gram-negative bacilli, Gram-positive bacilli and significantly more samples leading to no growth, than samples before freezing. The number of samples yielding Gram-positive catalase-negative cocci was not significantly affected by freezing. In the second study, a real-time PCR-based test was performed on milk samples with an individual quarter somatic cell count above 500,000 cells/ml that were either negative (n=51 samples) or that led to the isolation of minor pathogens in culturing: Corynebacterium bovis (n=79 samples) or non-aureus staphylococci (NAS, n=32). A mastitis pathogen, beyond the result obtained with standard bacteriology, was detected on 47% of the no-growth samples, on 35% of the samples from which C. bovis had been isolated and on 25% of the samples from which NAS had been isolated. The most commonly detected major pathogen was Escherichia coli, followed by Streptococcus uberis, Arcanobacterium pyogenes/Peptoniphilus indolicus and Streptococcus dysgalactiae. These results suggest that simply freezing milk samples for 24 h does not increase the detection of intramammary bacteria in milk samples and therefore should not be recommended. However, use of the real-time PCR-based test may be useful in diagnosing intramammary infections when milk samples with high somatic cell counts are culture-negative or when culturing results in the detection of minor pathogens.
TI  - Bacterial meningitis in cirrhotic patients: case series and description of the prognostic role of acute renal failure.
AB  - AIM: To analyze the mortality risk factors in cirrhotic patients with bacterial meningitis (BM). BACKGROUND: Cirrhotic patients are susceptible to infections. Despite its high mortality rate, BM has not been extensively studied in this group of patients. STUDY: BM patients diagnosed with cirrhosis, between 1987 and 2008, were studied. BM was defined as the presence of signs or symptoms of meningitis and a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leukocyte count >100/mm3 or the presence of bacteria in CSF. RESULTS: We identified 4955 infections among 7591 cirrhotic patients; 12 (0.2%) had BM. The mean age at diagnosis was 60+/-16 years. Abnormal mental status (83%), fever (67%), and neck stiffness (67%) were the most frequent clinical presentations. The sensitivity of CSF culture was 75% (Streptococcus pneumoniae, 2; Staphylococcus aureus, 2; Listeria monocytogenes, 1; Group B Streptococcus, 1; Streptococcus agalactiae, 1; Streptococcus bovis, 1; and Escherichia coli, 1), and its correlation with blood culture was 78%. Five patients died. On admission, the serum creatinine level was 1.63+/-0.93 mg/dL. A serum creatinine level >/=1.3 mg/dL was associated with increased mortality (P=0.028). The model for end-stage liver disease score, gastrointestinal bleeding, bilirubin level >3.5 mg/dL, hepatic encephalopathy, diabetes mellitus, and results of cytology and biochemistry tests of CSF were not associated with mortality. CONCLUSIONS: BM in cirrhotic patients is associated with a high mortality rate. The clinical and microbiologic features of BM in cirrhotic patients differ from those in the general population. A serum creatinine level >/=1.3 mg/dL on admission is associated with a higher risk of mortality.
TI  - Age-dependent profile of left-sided infective endocarditis: a 3-center experience.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The influence of age on the main epidemiological, clinical, echocardiographic, microbiological, and prognostic features of patients with infective endocarditis remains unknown. We present the series with the largest numbers and range of ages of subjects to date that analyzes the influence of age on the main characteristics of patients with isolated left-sided infective endocarditis. Furthermore, this series is the first one in which patients have been distributed according to age quartile. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 600 episodes of left-sided endocarditis consecutively diagnosed in 3 tertiary centers were stratified into age-specific quartiles and 107 variables compared between the different groups. With increasing age, the percentage of women, previous heart disease, predisposing disease (diabetes mellitus and cancer), and infection by enterococci and Streptococcus bovis also increased. Valvular insufficiency and perforation and Staphylococcus aureus infection were more common in younger patients. The therapeutic approach differed depending on patient age because of the growing proportion of older patients who only received medical treatment. Clinical course and hospital prognosis were worse in the older patients because of increased surgical mortality among them. CONCLUSIONS: Increasing age is associated with less valvular impairment (insufficiency and perforation), a more favorable microbiological profile, and increased surgical mortality among adults with left-sided infective endocarditis.
TI  - Development of a loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay for the detection of Mycobacterium bovis.
AB  - Bovine tuberculosis caused by Mycobacterium bovis is an important zoonosis. In this study, a simple, rapid method for detecting this organism was developed based on loop-mediated isothermal amplification of the mpt83 gene. The technique will be of value in the clinical and field-based diagnosis of M. bovis and can differentiate it from other bacteria such as Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, beta-haemolytic streptococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. The limit of detection was 10 copies/muL and the results were corroborated by PCR. The method was highly specific and more sensitive than PCR.
TI  - Evidence-based semiquantitative methodology for prioritization of foodborne zoonoses.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To prioritize an extended list of food- and water-borne zoonoses to allow food safety authorities to focus on the most relevant hazards in the food chain. METHODS: An evidence-based semiquantitative methodology was developed. Scores were given by 35 scientific experts in the field of animal and public health, food, and clinical microbiology and epidemiology to 51 zoonotic agents according to five criteria related to public health (severity and occurrence in humans), animal health (severity of disease coupled with economic consequences and occurrence in animals), and food (occurrence in food). The scoring procedure was standardized and evidence-based as experts were provided, for each zoonotic agent, a same set of up-to-date help information data related to the five criteria. Independently, the relative importance of the five criteria was weighted by seven food chain risk managers. The zoonotic agents were ranked based on overall weighted scores and were grouped in four statistically different levels of importance. RESULTS: The following foodborne zoonotic pathogens were classified as "most important": Salmonella spp., Campylobacter spp., Listeria monocytogenes, and verocytotoxigenic Escherichia coli. A second group of "significant importance" included Toxoplasma gondii, the agent of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, Clostridium botulinum, Staphylococcus aureus, Cryptosporidium parvum, Mycobacterium bovis, Echinococcus granulosus, Streptococcus spp., Echinococcus multilocularis, Yersinia enterocolitica, Mycobacterium avium, Fasciola hepatica, Giardia intestinalis, and Rotavirus. CONCLUSIONS: This methodology allowed to rank 51 zoonotic agents with objectivity and taking account of a combined input from risk assessors and risk managers. APPLICATIONS: These results support food safety policy makers to establish the multiannual monitoring program of foodborne zoonoses. They also enable to identify knowledge gaps on specific zoonotic agents and to formulate key research questions. Principally, this method of prioritization is of general interest as it can be applied for any other ranking exercise and in any country.
TI  - [Novel clinical and epidemiologic trends in elderly infective endocarditis].
AB  - The age of peak incidence of infective endocarditis (IE) has shifted from 45 years in the 50's to 70 years at the present time. Elderly persons carry a five times higher risk of IE than the general adult population. Factors accounting for this phenomenon include increased use of invasive procedures and implanted medical devices as well as a higher prevalence of degenerative valve disease. In the elderly, IE onset may be insidious, often masked by one or more underlying conditions such as cancer, diabetes and chronic organ failure, hence the diagnosis may be delayed. The leading pathogen is Staphylococcus aureus, more frequently methicillin-resistant, although Streptococcus bovis and enterococci are gaining prevalence. Vascular phenomena and embolic events are less common in the elderly, probably due to a lessened acute phase response and a larger use of antiplatelet and anticoagulant drugs. Because of diminished renal clearance, antibiotics should be carefully titrated in aged IE patients. Cardiac surgery is performed less often in elderly IE due to poor preoperative conditions. Indeed, both these factors may account for the higher mortality rate, that is twice that of younger IE patients. Notwithstanding, age > or = 65 years has been found to be an independent predictor of mortality. Prophylactic measures residing mostly on the prevention of health-care associated acquisition need to be more widely implemented in this growing subgroup of IE patients.
TI  - Pathogen detection in milk samples by ligation detection reaction-mediated universal array method.
AB  - This paper describes a new DNA chip, based on the use of a ligation detection reaction coupled to a universal array, developed to detect and analyze, directly from milk samples, microbial pathogens known to cause bovine, ovine, and caprine mastitis or to be responsible for foodborne intoxication or infection, or both. Probes were designed for the identification of 15 different bacterial groups: Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, nonaureus staphylococci, Streptococcus bovis, Streptococcus equi, Streptococcus canis, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus parauberis, Streptococcus uberis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Mycoplasma spp., Salmonella spp., Bacillus spp., Campylobacter spp., and Escherichia coli and related species. These groups were identified based on the 16S rRNA gene. For microarray validation, 22 strains from the American Type Culture Collection or other culture collections and 50 milk samples were tested. The results demonstrated high specificity, with sensitivity as low as 6 fmol. Moreover, the ligation detection reaction-universal array assay allowed for the identification of Mycoplasma spp. in a few hours, avoiding the long incubation times of traditional microbiological identification methods. The universal array described here is a versatile tool able to identify milk pathogens efficiently and rapidly.
TI  - Real-time polymerase chain reaction-based identification of bacteria in milk samples from bovine clinical mastitis with no growth in conventional culturing.
AB  - In more than 30% of milk samples from clinical and subclinical bovine mastitis, bacteria fail to grow even after 48 h of conventional culture. The "no-growth" samples are problematic for mastitis laboratories, veterinarians, and dairy producers. This study provides the first investigation of the bacteriological etiology of such samples, using a real-time PCR-based commercial reagent kit. The assay targets the DNA of the 11 most common bacterial species or groups in mastitis and the staphylococcal blaZ gene (responsible for penicillin resistance) and can identify and quantify bacterial cells even if dead or growth-inhibited. A study was made of 79 mastitic milk samples with no-growth bacteria in conventional culture, originating from cows with clinical mastitis. Of the 79 samples, 34 (43%) were positive for 1 (32 samples) or 2 (2 samples) of the target bacteria. The positive findings included 11 Staphylococcus spp. (staphylococci other than Staphylococcus aureus), 10 Streptococcus uberis, 2 Streptococcus dysgalactiae, 6 Corynebacterium bovis, 3 Staph. aureus, 1 Escherichia coli, 1 Enterococcus, and 1 Arcanobacterium pyogenes. The positive samples contained as many as 10(3) to 10(7) bacterial genome copies per milliliter of milk. This study demonstrates that in nearly half of the clinical mastitis cases in which conventional culture failed to detect bacteria, mastitis pathogens were still present, often in substantial quantities. The clearly elevated N-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase activity values of the milk samples, together with clinical signs of the infected cows and quarters, confirmed the diagnosis of clinical mastitis and indicated that real-time, PCR-based bacterial findings are able to reveal bacteriological etiology. We conclude that all common mastitis bacteria can occur in large quantities in clinical mastitis samples that exhibit no growth in conventional culture, and that the real-time PCR assay is a useful tool for bacteriological diagnosis of such milk samples. Low bacterial concentration is commonly speculated to explain the no-growth milk samples. This hypothesis is not supported by the results of the current study.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of five herbal extracts against multi drug resistant (MDR) strains of bacteria and fungus of clinical origin.
AB  - Antimicrobial activities of the crude ethanolic extracts of five plants were screened against multidrug resistant (MDR) strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Candida albicans. ATCC strains of Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus bovis, Pseudimonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Candida albicans were also tested. The strains that showed resistance against the maximum number of antibiotics tested were selected for an antibacterial assay. The MDR strains were sensitive to the antimicrobial activity of Acacia nilotica, Syzygium aromaticum and Cinnamum zeylanicum, whereas they exhibited strong resistance to the extracts of Terminalia arjuna and Eucalyptus globulus. Community-acquired infections showed higher sensitivity than the nosocomial infections against these extracts. The most potent antimicrobial plant was A. nilotica (MIC range 9.75-313 microg/ml), whereas other crude plant extracts studied in this report were found to exhibit higher MIC values than A. nilotica against community acquired as well as nosocomial infection. This study concludes that A. nilotica, C. zeylanicum and S. aromaticum can be used against multidrug resistant microbes causing nosocomial and community acquired infections.
TI  - Current features of infective endocarditis in elderly patients: results of the International Collaboration on Endocarditis Prospective Cohort Study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Elderly patients are emerging as a population at high risk for infective endocarditis (IE). However, adequately sized prospective studies on the features of IE in elderly patients are lacking. METHODS: In this multinational, prospective, observational cohort study within the International Collaboration on Endocarditis, 2759 consecutive patients were enrolled from June 15, 2000, to December 1, 2005; 1056 patients with IE 65 years or older were compared with 1703 patients younger than 65 years. Risk factors, predisposing conditions, origin, clinical features, course, and outcome of IE were comprehensively analyzed. RESULTS: Elderly patients reported more frequently a hospitalization or an invasive procedure before IE onset. Diabetes mellitus and genitourinary and gastrointestinal cancer were the major predisposing conditions. Blood culture yield was higher among elderly patients with IE. The leading causative organism was Staphylococcus aureus, with a higher rate of methicillin resistance. Streptococcus bovis and enterococci were also significantly more prevalent. The clinical presentation of elderly patients with IE was remarkable for lower rates of embolism, immune-mediated phenomena, or septic complications. At both echocardiography and surgery, fewer vegetations and more abscesses were found, and the gain in the diagnostic yield of transesophageal echocardiography was significantly larger. Significantly fewer elderly patients underwent cardiac surgery (38.9% vs 53.5%; P < .001). Elderly patients with IE showed a higher rate of in-hospital death (24.9% vs 12.8%; P < .001), and age older than 65 years was an independent predictor of mortality. CONCLUSIONS: In this large prospective study, increasing age emerges as a major determinant of the clinical characteristics of IE. Lower rates of surgical treatment and high mortality are the most prominent features of elderly patients with IE. Efforts should be made to prevent health care-associated acquisition and improve outcomes in this major subgroup of patients with IE.
TI  - CNS mastitis: nothing to worry about?
AB  - In this paper, we analyzed a very large field data set on intramammary infections (IMI) and the associated somatic cell count (SCC) in dairy cows. The objective of the study was to analyze the impact of coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) IMI on cow SCC, both mean and variability, and on the potential of these infections to have a major impact on the bulk milk SCC (BMSCC). Data and milk samples for bacterial culture were collected by Quality Milk Production Services (QMPS) between 1992 and March of 2007. The QMPS program services dairy farms in New York State and other states in the Northeastern USA and operates in conjunction with Cornell University. Only records from cows where SCC and milk production data were available, and where only one organism was isolated from bacterial cultures of milk samples (or where culture was negative) were used for this analysis. A total of 352,614 records from 4200 whole herd mastitis screening sampling qualified for this study. Within herds an average of 15% (S.D. 12%) of cows sampled were infected with CNS, ranging between 0 and 100%. Average within herd prevalence of cows with a CNS IMI and an SCC over 200,000 cells/ml was 2% (S.D. 4%) with a minimum of 0% and a maximum of 50%. Results of linear mixed models showed three distinct populations of IMI statuses: negative cultures with the lowest SCC; CNS and Corynebacterium bovis with a moderate increase in SCC, and Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus spp. and Staphylococcus aureus showing an important increase in SCC. Surprisingly, milk production was slightly but significantly higher in CNS infected cows compared to culture-negative cows, whereas it was strongly reduced in cows with a major pathogen IMI. The percentage contribution of CNS infections to the BMSCC was 17.9% in herds with a BMSCC less than 200,000 cells/ml. This value decreased to 11.9 and 7.9% in herds with bulk milk SCC between 200,000 and 400,000 and over 400,000 cells/ml, respectively. We concluded that very few herds with milk quality problems would have an important increase in BMSCC that could be mostly attributed to CNS infections. On the other hand, in herds with low BMSCC, CNS infections may be an important contributor to the total number of somatic cells in the bulk milk.
TI  - Development of a novel biochip for rapid multiplex detection of seven mastitis-causing pathogens in bovine milk samples.
AB  - To efficiently prevent and treat bovine mastitis and minimize its effect on the dairy industry, a sensitive, rapid, and specific test is required for identifying the mastitis-causing pathogens. In this study, a biochip capable of detecting 7 common species of mastitis-causing pathogens, including Corynebacterium bovis, Mycoplasma bovis, Staphylococcus aureus, and the Streptococcus spp. S. agalactiae, S. bovis, S. dysgalactiae, and S. uberis, within 6 hr was developed. The technique is based on DNA amplification of genes specific to the target pathogens and consists of 4 basic steps: DNA extraction of bacteria, polymerase chain reaction, DNA hybridization, and colorimetric reaction. To examine the accuracy and specificity of this biochip, a preliminary test with 82 random quarter milk samples were analyzed and compared with results from conventional microbiological methods conducted simultaneously. Results from all but 1 sample analyzed by the biochip were in agreement with those analyzed by bacteriology. The biochip could be a feasible tool for rapidly diagnosing mastitis-causing pathogens in milk and providing information for a more effective treatment to cure mastitis.
TI  - Infective endocarditis associated with spondylodiscitis and frequent secondary epidural abscess.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although many patients with IE complain of joint, muscle, and back pain, infections at these sights are rare. Indeed, in patients with back pain and endocarditis, less than 4% actually demonstrate spondylodiscitis. CASE DESCRIPTION: We recently encountered 4 patients with this complication, one each caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus bovis, Streptococcus mitis, and Enterococcus faecalis, and wondered whether the nature of the infecting organism determined the development of spondylodiscitis and epidural abscess. In a literature review, 36 patients with endocarditis and spondylodiscitis were identified. Only 9 (25%) were caused by Streptococcus viridans and the remainder by staphylococci, enterococci, and other streptococci. Usually more than 50% of all cases of IE were caused by Streptococcus viridans, although more recent studies would indicate an incidence of about 40%. CONCLUSION: We conclude that spondylodiscitis with epidural abscess is more likely to occur in those patients with endocarditis who are infected by organisms with pyogenic potential.
TI  - Management of active infective endocarditis complicated by large vegetations.

TI  - Potential pathogens carried by Spanish ibex (Capra pyrenaica hispanica) in southern Spain.
AB  - The Spanish ibex (Capra pyrenaica hispanica) population of southern Spain was surveyed for potential pathogens associated with the conjunctiva, external ear canal, as well as reproductive and upper respiratory tracts. We sampled 321 ibex (131 adult males, 100 adult females, and 90 yearlings); these included 271 apparently healthy animals and 50 that were naturally infected with Sarcoptes scabiei. A total of 688 bacterial isolates were identified (377 gram-negatives, 225 gram-positives, and 86 Mycoplasma spp.); sex, age, location, infection with S. scabiei, and disposition of the animal (free-ranging versus captive) were evaluated as risk factors for infection. Infections with Mycoplasma agalactiae and Mycoplasma arginini were associated with age, having a higher frequency of isolation in young animals. With Escherichia coli, Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida biotype A, and Staphylococcus aureus, significantly higher isolation rates were associated with adults. The isolation frequency for E. coli was higher in females, whereas Moraxella bovis isolations were mostly associated with males. The presence of mange increased the risk of infection with both Streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus and M. haemolytica. The geographic origin of sampled animals was related to the isolation of Branhamella ovis, M. agalactiae, and all Pasteurella sp. Isolations of M. haemolytica, P. multocida biotype A, E. coli, and B. ovis were more prevalent in samples from free-ranging rather than captive animals. Of the gram-positive bacteria, S. aureus represented the predominant species isolated from nasal, vaginal, and ocular samples. Mycoplasma agalactiae and M. arginini were the predominant Mycoplasma spp., and both were associated most often with the external ear canal. The most frequently isolated gram-negative bacteria included E. coli, M. haemolytica, P. multocida biotype A, and B. ovis. Isolation rates of gram-negative species varied by source. In nasal samples, M. haemolytica and P. multocida biotype A were isolated most frequently, whereas in ocular and vaginal samples, B. ovis and E. coli, respectively, were most frequently isolated.
TI  - Prevalence of contagious mastitis pathogens in bulk tank milk in Prince Edward Island.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to 1) estimate the herd prevalence of contagious mastitis pathogens in bulk milk from Prince Edward Island (PEI) dairy farms, 2) determine the association between bulk milk culture results and mean bulk milk somatic cell count (BMSCC), and 3) investigate the agreement of repeated bulk milk cultures. Three consecutive bulk milk samples were obtained at weekly intervals from all 258 PEI dairy herds and were cultured using routine laboratory methods. Cumulative prevalence of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Mycoplasma spp. (M. bovis and M. alkalescens) was 74%, 1.6%, and 1.9%, respectively. Bulk milk somatic cell count of Staph. aureus-positive herds was higher than that of negative herds. Agreement for Staph. aureus isolation between 3 consecutive tests was moderate (kappa = 0.46). Mycoplasma bovis and M. alkalescens in bulk milk are being reported for the 1st time in PEI ever and in Canada since 1972.
TI  - Prevalence of mastitis pathogens and their resistance against antimicrobial agents in dairy cows in Brandenburg, Germany.
AB  - The primary objective of this study was to determine management practices concerning mastitis in Brandenburg, Germany, the prevalence of mastitis pathogens in dairy cows, and their resistance to selected antimicrobial agents. A further objective was to study the potential effect of parity and stage of lactation on the resistance of Staphylococcus aureus isolates against ampicillin. Milk samples for microbiological culture were collected from 4 groups of clinically healthy cows (first lactation, >1 lactation, >50 d in milk, and >250 d in milk; 8 cows/group) in 80 dairy herds. Resistance of gram-positive pathogens against 6 antimicrobial agents was tested using the broth microdilution method. Mastitis pathogens were isolated from 26.4% of the milk samples. Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS, 9.1% of quarters) and Corynebacterium bovis (7.3%) were the pathogens most frequently isolated. Among the major pathogens, Staph. aureus (5.7%) and Streptococcus uberis (1.0%) had the highest prevalence. Streptococcus agalactiae was isolated in samples from 29% of the herds. Although the prevalence of most pathogens was higher in older cows, the prevalence of CNS was higher in primiparous cows. Results of the mastitis control questionnaire showed that cows with clinical mastitis were transferred to a sick cow pen in 70% of the herds. Cephalosporins were the drug of first choice for treatment of clinical mastitis cases followed by fixed combinations of antimicrobial agents, beta-lactamase-resistant penicillins, and penicillin. Most farmers treated cows 3 to 4 times per case. Cloxacillin, alone or in combination, and penicillin were most often used for dry-cow therapy. Antimicrobial resistance of the pathogens was within the range of other reports. Resistance of Staph. aureus to ampicillin increased significantly during the first lactation. Further research is required to determine the factors that lead to the selection of Staph. aureus strains that are resistant to ampicillin during the first lactation.
TI  - Evolution of surveillance methods for detection of bacterial contamination of platelets in a university hospital, 1991 through 2004.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Platelet (PLT) bacterial contamination (PBC) is the most common transfusion-associated infection. It is important to understand the impact of interventions addressing this problem. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: PBC was studied by prospective (active) and transfusion-reaction triggered (passive) surveillance from July 1991 to December 2004. Active surveillance, utilized for 10 years, included bacterial culture of all or 4- and 5-day-old PLTs at issue and intermittent use of Gram stain, pH measurements, and early (24-hr) culture of single-donor plateletpheresis (SDP) units. RESULTS: Active surveillance detected 38 instances of PBC, 7 in SDP units (1:2213) and 31 in random-donor PLT units (1:2090 units, p = 0.89; or 1:418 pools of 5 units, p < 0.001). Contaminants were coagulase-negative staphylococci (CONS; n = 27), Staphylococcus aureus (4), Bacillus cereus (1), Serratia marcescens (2), streptococci (2 S. bovis, 1 S. uberis), and CONS with viridans group streptococcus (1). Only one instance of contamination, caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, was detected by passive surveillance, with fatal outcome. Colony counts of contaminants ranged from 0.5 x 10(2) to 4 x 10(11) colony-forming units per mL at time of issue. PBC was interdicted before transfusion in 6 cases through Gram stain screening. Transfusion reactions occurred in 13 of 32 recipients (41%), with 9 severe reactions (28%) and 3 deaths (9%). pH testing failed to detect 5 contaminated units and resulted in discard of nearly 2 percent of units, whereas culture of SDP units at 24 hours failed to identify a contaminated unit. CONCLUSION: Improved active surveillance methods for detecting PBC are needed to improve the safety of PLT transfusions.
TI  - Epidemiologic, clinical, and microbiologic profile of infective endocarditis in Argentina: a national survey. The Endocarditis Infecciosa en la Republica Argentina-2 (EIRA-2) Study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study aimed to determine the epidemiologic, clinical, microbiologic characteristics, and inhospital outcome of infective endocarditis (IE) in Argentina and compare the results with those of the 1992 IE national survey. METHODS: A prospective, multicenter study was conducted in 82 hospitals representing 16 of 24 provinces of Argentina. Patients with diagnosis of IE according to the Duke criteria were surveyed during an 18-month period. RESULTS: From 470 surveyed episodes of IE, 390 cases were classified as definite and 80 as possible IE. The mean age of the definite IE cases was 58.5 +/- 17.3 years; male sex, 70.0%; and male-female ratio, 2.3:1. Pathological evidence of IE was available in 26.2%. There was no previously known heart disease in 35.1%, and the proportion of prosthetic valve IE was 15.9%. Causative microorganisms were streptococci, 38.3% (Streptococcus viridans 27.0%, Streptococcus bovis 5.2%, others 6.1%); enterococci, 10.2%; staphylococci, 36.7% (Staphylococcus aureus 29.8%, coagulase-negative staphylococci 6.9%); HACEK group, 6.1%; fungal, 1.4%; and polymicrobial, 2.0%. Blood culture results were negative in 10.8%. Surgical treatment was performed in 26.2%, and the overall inhospital mortality was 24.6%. Patients from the 2002 survey were older (58.5 +/- 17.3 vs 51.3 +/- 18.7 years, P < .01) and more frequently had underlying heart disease (64.9% vs 55.0%, P < .01): degenerative valve disease (11.5% vs 4.8%, P < .01), congenital heart disease (9.5% vs 4.2%, P < .01), and prosthetic valve IE (15.9% vs 8.5%, P < .01). Conversely, the prevalence of rheumatic valve disease was significantly less than in the 1992 survey (5.4% vs 13.0%, P < .01). CONCLUSIONS: The EIRA-2 survey shows that the clinical profile of IE has changed in Argentina. Currently, patients with IE are older and have a higher frequency of underlying heart disease, degenerative valve disease, and prosthetic valve IE than previously. The incidence of staphylococcal IE has increased. Inhospital mortality remains high, suggesting that more aggressive measures are needed for the early identification, prevention, and treatment of IE.
TI  - Ability of the heparan sulfate proteoglycan syndecan-1 to participate in bacterial translocation across the intestinal epithelial barrier.
AB  - Although hundreds of microbial species reside in the human intestinal tract, comparatively few (e.g., Escherichia coli and other enterobacteria, Enterococcus faecalis, etc.) are typically associated with systemic infection in postsurgical, shock, and trauma patients. Syndecan-1 is the predominant cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan expressed on epithelia, and there is substantial evidence that heparan sulfate participates in interactions of a variety of frankly pathogenic microbes with mammalian cells. To investigate the role of syndecan-1 in interactions of enteric flora with intestinal epithelium, bacteria that might use the enterocyte as a portal of entry for systemic infection (including E. faecalis, E. coli, and other enterobacteria, and several species of staphylococci and streptococci) were studied for their abilities to interact with syndecan-1. Streptococcus bovis, S. agalactiae, S. pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, and S. epidermidis showed increased adherence to ARH-77 cells transfected to express syndecan-1. Heparin, a heparan sulfate analog, inhibited internalization of S. bovis, S. agalactiae, S. pyogenes, and S. aureus by HT-29 enterocytes (prominent syndecan-1 expression), but not Caco-2 enterocytes (relatively low syndecan-1 expression). Data from experiments with Chinese hamster ovary cells with altered glycosaminoglycan expression indicated that heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate (glycosaminoglycans on the syndecan-1 ectodomain) participated in bacterial interactions with mammalian cells. Thus, although E. faecalis, E. coli, and other gram-negative enterobacteria did not appear to interact with syndecan-1, this heparan sulfate proteoglycan may mediate enterocyte interactions with some staphylococci and streptococci that are known to cause systemic infections in specific populations of high-risk, immunosuppressed, postsurgical, and trauma patients.
TI  - [Study on treatment strategy for ventriculitis associated with ventriculoperitoneal shunt for hydrocephalus].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the treatment strategy for ventriculitis associated with ventriculo peritoneal shunt for hydrocephalus. METHODS: For all of the patients suspected to have cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) infections, the first step of treatment was removal of the "infected" shunts, then a ventricular drainage was placed in frontal horn of the ventricle, and at the same time CSF was obtained from the ventricle for bacterial culture and tests of bacterial sensitivities to antibiotics. After the shunt removal and before the result from bacterial cultures was obtained, 25-50 mg of vancomycin was administered intraventricularly daily. As soon as the result from bacterial cultures was obtained, antibiotics should be adjusted according to the sensitivity test result. By the time of the infections being controlled, appropriate treatments including reshunting would finally be given for hydrocephalus if necessary. RESULTS: Among 11 patients, 9 were infected with coagulase-negative Staphylococci or Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus, one of them with concomitant infection of aerobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacteriaceae aerogenesis, 1 patient with Streptococci, and another one with Mycobacterium stercoris bovis. The tests of drug sensitivity showed that cocci in infection of 9 patients were all sensitive to vancomycin, but only 1 of them sensitive to gentamycin. There were other sensitive antibiotics for streptococcus in 1 case and for bacillus in 2 patients. Practically vancomycin was effective for 8 of 11 patients, including one case of streptococcal infection. The duration for anti-infection treatment was in a range of 16-36 days. Finally, all of 11 patients survived from the shunt ventriculitis, and 9 of them had significant improvement in their neurological functions. CONCLUSION: (1)Intraventricular administration of proper antibiotics is a reliable and effective way to treat ventriculitis associated with ventriculoperitoneal shunts. (2)Vancomycin is the preferred antibiotic for ventriculitis, but other kind(s) of some antibiotics are necessary in a few patients in addition to or instead of vancomycin. (3)The effect of systemic use of antibiotics could not be defined in this series of patients, but this may be used as an adjunct in the practice. (4)There are many problems related to diagnosis and treatment of shunt ventriculitis that should be studied more extensively and deeply.
TI  - Risk of embolism and death in infective endocarditis: prognostic value of echocardiography: a prospective multicenter study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The incidence of embolic events (EE) and death is still high in patients with infective endocarditis (IE), and data about predictors of these 2 major complications are conflicting. Moreover, the exact role of echocardiography in risk stratification is not well defined. METHODS AND RESULTS: In a multicenter prospective European study, including 384 consecutive patients (aged 57+/-17 years) with definite IE according to Duke University criteria, we tested clinical, microbiological, and echocardiographic data as potential predictors of EE and 1-year mortality. Transesophageal echocardiography was performed in all patients. Embolism occurred before or after IE diagnosis (total-EE) in 131 patients (34.1%) and after initiation of antibiotic therapy (new-EE) in 28 patients (7.3%). Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus bovis were independently associated with total-EE, whereas vegetation length >10 mm and severe vegetation mobility were predictors of new-EE, even after adjustment for S aureus and S bovis. One-year mortality was 20.6%. In multivariable analysis, independently of the other predictors of death (age, female sex, creatinine serum >2 mg/L, moderate or severe congestive heart failure, and S aureus) and comorbidity, vegetation length >15 mm was a predictor of 1-year mortality (adjusted relative risk=1.8; 95% CI, 1.10 to 2.82; P=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: In IE, vegetation length is a strong predictor of new-EE and mortality. In combination with clinical and microbiological findings, echocardiography may identify high-risk patients who will need a more aggressive therapeutic strategy.
TI  - Binding of porcine ficolin-alpha to lipopolysaccharides from Gram-negative bacteria and lipoteichoic acids from Gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - Protein(s) reactive with N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc) was isolated from porcine nonimmune serum. The molecular weight of the purified protein was found to be mainly 40 kDa on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions. The N-terminal 10 amino acid sequence of the purified protein were found to be identical to that of porcine ficolin-alpha reported previously. In enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, the purified protein was found to react with lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from different Gram-negative bacteria such as Esherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Salmonella enteritidis, Salmonella abortus equi, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Shigella flexeneri, and Serratia marcescens and with lipoteichoic acid (LTA) from Gram-positive bacteria such as Streptococcus sanguis, Bacillus subtilis, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus. The purified protein also reacted with E. coli O26 isolated from food poisoning and bovine feces and heat-treated Gram-positive bacteria such as S. aureus, B. cereus, B. subtilis, Enterococcus faecium, and Corynebacterum bovis. On the other hand, porcine IgG isolated from nonimmune serum showed different reactivity with these LPS, LTA, and heat-treated bacterial cells. From the present findings, purified porcine serum protein reactive with GlcNAc is concluded to be ficolin-alpha playing an important role(s) in innate immunity against microbial infection with Gram-positive and -negative bacteria.
TI  - A comparative field trial of cephalonium and cloxacillin for dry cow therapy for  mastitis in Australian dairy cows.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate and compare the therapeutic efficacy of dry cow agents  containing either cephalonium or cloxacillin within Australian dairy herds. DESIGN: A treatment-control trial. METHODS: Milk from infected quarters of cows with high somatic cell counts in milk on eight Australian dairy farms was cultured to identify bacterial pathogens. Cows were randomly assigned to treatment groups and one group was treated with cephalonium at drying off and the other group was treated with cloxacillin at drying off. Milk samples from infected quarters were collected immediately after calving and were cultured for pathogens. The effect of treatment on bacteriological cure was examined and somatic cell counts from infected cows from the first two herd tests after calving were examined for a treatment effect. On four farms, milk samples were collected for culture from all cases of clinical mastitis identified within the first 7 days after calving. The effect of treatment upon incidence of clinical mastitis after calving was examined. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between treatments on quarter cure rates for new infections, for chronic infections and for infections with Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus uberis. Infected quarters treated with cephalonium had a significantly higher cure rate than quarters treated with cloxacillin when Corynebacterium bovis and Staphylococcus epidermids were included as pathogens combined (80.3% versus 70.7%). There was no significant difference between the treatments on somatic cell counts of infected cows at the first two herd tests after calving. There was no difference between treatments on the incidence of clinical mastitis in the first 7 days after calving.
TI  - [Bacterially conditioned thromboembolism in dairy cows--a retrospective study of  31 necropsy cases with special consideration of the causative complex].
AB  - A study of 340 necropsied dairy cattle from northern Bavaria resulted in 31 animals (9%) showing evidence of pyemic thromboembolism. The most frequent pathomorphologic lesions consisted in endocarditis valvularis thromboticans of the tricuspid and/or mitral valve (21), embolic pneumonia (26), nephritis (13) and renal infarction (12). The most common isolate found in bacteriologic culture was Arcanobacterium pyogenes in 26 of 31 cases, followed by Staphylococcus aureus (2), Mannheimia haemolytica (2) and Streptococcus bovis (1) in rare cases. In 27 of 31 cows a possible cause of pyemic thromboembolism was found; in 23 cases claw diseases and decubital ulcera were probably responsible.
TI  - The influence of endoscopic procedures upon the contamination of Helicobacter pylori cultures.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Among the various diagnostic methods for the detection of Helicobacter pylori infection, histological examination and microbiological processing of gastric biopsy samples are assumed to be the gold standard techniques. AIMS: Since H. pylori culture can be affected by the presence of non-H. pylori bacteria, we evaluated the efficacy of endoscope disinfection and the influence of endoscopic procedures on culture contamination. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The procedures used during the first two routine endoscopies were evaluated during 28 consecutive days. Endoscopy room, forceps and endoscopic channel were analyzed before and after the beginning of normal procedures. After disinfection, a biopsy simulation was performed to verify the gastric bacteria. RESULTS: Endoscope disinfection removed all organisms from forceps and endoscopic channel with 100% efficacy. The most frequent non-H. pylori bacteria detected were Streptococcus bovis, Enterobacter hormaechei, and Staphylococcus aureus. The sensibility of the H. pylori culture was affected by the presence of non-H. pylori bacteria. CONCLUSION: The risk of transmission of microorganisms was not detectable when sterilized biopsy forceps and stringent disinfection standards were employed. Whilst S. bovis and E. hormaechei may be common in gastric microbial flora, the presence of P. aeruginosa and S. aureus indicated that the manipulation of biopsies could be responsible for culture contamination with these bacteria.
TI  - Bovine mastitis in Finland 2001--prevalence, distribution of bacteria, and antimicrobial resistance.
AB  - A nationwide survey was conducted in Finland to estimate prevalence of bovine mastitis, distribution of mastitis pathogens, and in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility of different mastitis pathogens. In total, 12,661 quarter milk samples were collected from 3282 dairy cows at 216 farms. These were randomly selected from a database covering all Finnish dairy farms. Quarter milk samples collected by the dairy advisors were submitted for somatic cell counting, bacteriological examination, and testing for antimicrobial susceptibility. If the milk SCC of a cow or of a quarter exceeded 300,000/mL, the cow was defined as having mastitis. The results were compared with those of a previous survey done in 1995. The prevalence of mastitis continued to decrease from 38% in 1995 to 31% in 2001. Compared with the study from 1995, the number of quarters with bacterial growth in 2001 increased significantly from 21.0 to 33.5%. This mainly resulted from increased prevalence of Corynebacterium bovis. Coagulase-negative staphylococci remained the most common bacterial group, comprising almost one-half of the pathogens isolated, whereas the relative number of Staphylococcus aureus isolations decreased from the time of the previous study. According to in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility testing, the enterococci demonstrated the highest level of resistance. Compared with the other Nordic countries, penicillin resistance among the staphylococci was still at a relatively high level in Finland (52.1 and 32.0% for Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci, respectively). Streptococci isolated from mastitis were very susceptible to beta-lactam antibiotics, as also found in the previous survey in 1995.
TI  - Efficacy of extended ceftiofur intramammary therapy for treatment of subclinical  mastitis in lactating dairy cows.
AB  - Little research has focused on treatment of cows with subclinical mastitis during lactation. Ceftiofur is a new broad-spectrum, third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic for veterinary use that inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis by interfering with enzymes essential for peptidoglycan synthesis. Ceftiofur should be effective against a wide range of contagious and environmental mastitis pathogens. Objectives of the present study were to evaluate the efficacy of ceftiofur for treatment of subclinical mastitis in lactating dairy cows, and to determine if extended therapy regimens enhanced efficacy of ceftiofur. Holstein and Jersey dairy cows (n = 88) from 3 dairy research herds were used. Cows were enrolled in the study based on milk somatic cell counts >400,000/mL and isolation of the same mastitis pathogen in 2 samples obtained 1 wk apart. Cows with one or more intramammary infections (IMI) were blocked by parity and DIM and allocated randomly to 1 of 3 different ceftiofur treatment regimens: 2-d (n = 49 IMI), 5-d (n = 41 IMI), and 8-d (n = 38 IMI) treatment regimens. For all groups, 125 mg of ceftiofur hydrochloride was administered via intramammary infusion. Eighteen cows with 38 IMI were included as an untreated negative control group. A bacteriological cure was defined as a treated infected mammary quarter that was bacteriologically negative for the presence of previously identified bacteria at 14 and 28 d after the last treatment. Efficacy of ceftiofur therapy against all subclinical IMI was 38.8, 53.7, and 65.8% for the 2-, 5-, and 8-d ceftiofur treatment regimens, respectively. Four of 38 (10.5%) IMI in control cows were cured spontaneously without treatment. All 3 ceftiofur treatment regimens were significantly better than the negative control, and the 8-d extended ceftiofur treatment regimen treatment group was significantly better than the standard 2-d treatment group. Pathogen groups had significantly different cure rates from one another. The cure rate for the 8-d extended ceftiofur treatment regimen was 70% for Corynebacterium bovis, 86% for coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species, 36% for Staph. aureus, 80% for Streptococcus dysgalactiae ssp. dysgalactiae, and 67% for Strep. uberis.
TI  - Antimicrobial spectrum and activity of NVP PDF-713, a novel peptide deformylase inhibitor, tested against 1,837 recent Gram-positive clinical isolates.
AB  - Continued emergence of antimicrobial resistances among gram-positive pathogens requires further development of compounds with novel modes of action. The peptide deformylase inhibitor NVP PDF-713 was tested against 1,837 recent strains of Gram-positive organisms. All NVP PDF-713 MICs were at < or = 4microg/mL except for 6 enterococci (0.3% of strains overall). NVP PDF-713 MIC(90) results were: Staphylococcus aureus, beta-haemolytic and viridans group streptococci and Streptococcus bovis at 1 microg/ml; coagulase-negative staphylococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Listeria spp. at 2 microg/mL; and the enterococci at 4 microg/mL. NVP PDF-713 appears to be a promising new agent worthy of continued in vivo development.
TI  - Causative organisms of infective endocarditis according to host status.
AB  - A prospective study of infective endocarditis (IE) was conducted between 1994 and 2000 in Marseilles, France, and included 170 definite cases diagnosed with the use of modified Duke criteria. Classification of IE based on the aetiological agent was related to epidemiological characteristics, including age, gender and the nature of the injured valve. Enterococci and Streptococcus bovis were identified more frequently in older subjects (p 0.02), and S. bovis was also associated with mitral valve infection (p 0.03). Streptococcus spp. were found to be associated with native valves (p < 10(-3)), whereas coagulase-negative staphylococci and Coxiella burnetii were associated with intracardiac prosthetic material (p < 0.05). S. bovis and Staphylococcus aureus were the predominant species associated with presumably healthy valves (p < 0.05), whereas oral streptococci caused IE exclusively in patients with previous valve damage. The basic host status of IE patients has been linked to specific microorganisms, and this may be of value when empirical treatment is needed in patients who have received previous antibiotic therapy and whose blood cultures are negative.
TI  - Quarter milk somatic cell count in infected dairy cows: a meta-analysis.
AB  - The aim of this paper was to evaluate the effects associated with intramammary infection (IMI) by a bacterium or a group of bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus uberis, coliforms, Staphylococci other than S. aureus, and Corynebacterium bovis) on the somatic cell count (SCC) in quarter milk of dairy cows. Papers selected for analysis had to provide SCC values associated with the natural infection in quarters by different bacteria. Sampling for measurement of SCC and determination of the infection had to be done on the same day. Only papers published in English or in French after 1971 were considered. Twenty-one papers fulfilled the selection criteria. The animals sampled, the measurement techniques for SCC and the bacteriological identification, as well as the definition of the infection, all differed widely among the selected studies. The meta-analysis method was used to estimate both the mean SCC (arithmetic and geometric) value and the average increase on SCC of each type of infection. The geometric mean SCC in bacteriologically negative quarters was 68 000 c/mL. In case of IMI, the retained SCC was 357 000, 857 000, 547 000, 1 024 000, 1 151 000, 138 000 and 105 000 c/mL in quarters infected by Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus uberis, coliforms, staphylococci other than S. aureus and Corynebacterium bovis, respectively. The variation factors that could influence these SCC values and the bacteriological results are discussed.
TI  - Special issues in the management of infective endocarditis caused by gram-positive cocci.
AB  - Gram-positive cocci, mainly streptococci and staphylococci, continue to cause the majority of cases of infective endocarditis. Among the streptococci causing IE, the long-standing predominance of oral or viridans-group streptococci has progressively faded, while the number of cases caused by "enteric streptococci" (Streptococcus bovis and enterococci) has increased. While most oral streptococci and S. bovis strains remain fully sensitive to penicillin, nutritionally variant streptococci--now renamed Abiotrophia--and enterococci can exhibit resistance to penicillin and/or glycopeptides that makes endocarditis more difficult to treat. Among the staphylococci causing endocarditis, the increasing proportion of coagulase-negative and methicillin-resistant strains observed in recent years has changed the approach to choice of antibiotic therapy. The purpose of this paper is to focus on some new aspects of the management of antibiotic therapy of IE due to streptococci and staphylococci, including recent developments such as once-daily aminoglycoside administration in IE, outpatient antibiotic therapy, and the evaluation of new antibiotics.
TI  - Rapid immunohistochemical detection of Rhodococcus equi in impression smears from affected foals on postmortem examination.
AB  - The first objective of this study was to develop an immunohistochemical procedure for rapid detection of Rhodococcus equi in impression smears from affected organs of foals on postmortem examination. The second aim was to demonstrate whether R. equi can be detected in smears of tracheal exudates collected from the same foals using an immunohistochemical method. Impression smears and cryostat and paraffin-embedded sections were made from the lungs and mediastinal lymph nodes of three foals (A, B and C) that had died of respiratory disease caused by R. equi, and also from the caudal mesenteric lymph node of foal A. Impression smears were made from the tracheal exudates of all foals. An affinity purified rabbit IgG was used for the immunohistochemical demonstration of R. equi. This antibody reacted with serotype 1 of R. equi in Ouchterlony's immunodiffusion and in the passive haemagglutination test, but not with other serotypes or with Streptococcus equi ssp. equi or Staphylococcus aureus, and failed to give an immunohistochemical reaction with Mycobacterium bovis or M. paratuberculosis. The immunohistochemical method proved to be of identical sensitivity to bacterial culture; moreover, from the lungs and mediastinal lymph nodes of one foal, R. equi could only be detected by this method. R. equi was demonstrated in smears of the tracheal exudates of all three foals. The results of this study indicate that the immunohistochemical method may be used for the rapid detection of R. equi in impression smears from the affected organs, especially abscesses, obtained postmortem, and possibly as a tool for diagnosing R. equi pneumonia in live foals by examining smears of tracheal aspirates.
TI  - Molecular cloning and characterization of Mycobacterium bovis BCG pcp gene encoding pyrrolidone carboxyl peptidase.
AB  - The Mycobacterium bovis bacilli Calmette-Guerin (BCG) pcp gene that encodes the pyrrolidone carboxyl peptidase (Pcp) was cloned from a lambdagtll genomic library and sequenced. The nucleotide sequence contains a 669 bp open reading frame coding for a protein of 222 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 23,209 Da. The deduced amino acid sequence is highly homologous to the Pcps from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Bacillus subtilis, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus. A multiple sequence alignment revealed highly conserved domains. The BCG pcp gene was overexpressed in Escherichia coli. The Pcp was purified to homogeneity. The recombinant protein was further confirmed by an enzymatic assay.
TI  - Development of a Brucella suis specific hybridisation probe and PCR which distinguishes B. suis from Brucella abortus.
AB  - A genomic library was prepared from Brucella suis DNA (MboI digested) and cloned  into the BamHI site of pUC18. Colony hybridisation using a probe prepared from purified B. suis DNA labelled with alpha 32P was carried out to identify colonies of interest. About 20 colonies, which gave an intense signal upon hybridisation with whole B. suis genomic DNA as a probe, were selected. Because of the high degree of DNA homology between B. suis and Brucella abortus, a short probe was chosen as it would more likely give species specificity. Of seven fragments selected to probe whole B. suis, B. abortus, and Yersinia enterocolitica DNA, one was found to hybridise with B. suis only. The probe was sequenced in two directions and sense and anti sense primers of 25bp in length were chosen to yield a product of 421bp. After optimisation of the PCR, a product of 420bp was obtained with B. suis template DNA and two bands of 420 and 650bp were detected with B. abortus template DNA. This is the first reported PCR of the Brucella genome where a single pair of primers will discriminate between B. suis and B. abortus. No band was observed when the two primers were used to amplify E. coli, Y. enterocolitica, Enterobacter cloacae, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus uberis, Corynebacterium bovis, or Serratia marcescens template DNA.
TI  - Aggregation substance-mediated adherence of Enterococcus faecalis to immobilized  extracellular matrix proteins.
AB  - Aggregation substance (AS) of Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis), a sex pheromone plasmid encoded cell surface protein, mediates the formation of bacterial aggregates, thereby promoting plasmid transfer. The influence of pAD1-encoded AS, Asa1, on binding to immobilized extracellular matrix proteins was studied. The presence of AS increased enterococcal adherence to fibronectin more than eight-fold, to thrombospondin more than four-fold, to vitronectin more than three-fold, and to collagen type I more than two-fold (P<0.001). In contrast, binding to laminin and collagen type IV occurred independently of AS. Adherence of the constitutively AS expressing E. faecalis OG1X(pAM721) to immobilized fibronectin was found to be approximately five times higher than that of Staphylococcus aureus Cowan and approximately 30 times higher than that of Streptococcus bovis. Investigation of strains with various deletions within the structural gene of asa1 suggests that attachment to immobilized fibronectin is mainly mediated by amino acids within the variable region or by neighbouring residues. Thus, AS may promote adherence to injured epithelium and endothelium, where extracellular matrix proteins are exposed, thereby facilitating colonization and infection.
TI  - Infective endocarditis in patients receiving long-term hemodialysis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To ascertain the predominant characteristics of patients receiving long-term dialysis who develop infective endocarditis (IE). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed the records of all chronic hemodialysis patients who had IE at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minn, between 1983 and 1997. RESULTS: Twenty episodes of IE occurred in 17 patients. One patient had 3 episodes of IE, and 1 patient had 2 episodes of IE; each episode was caused by a different organism. The mean +/- SD age of our patients was 63 +/- 11 years; there were 13 males; 6 patients had diabetes mellitus; and the mean +/- SD duration of hemodialysis prior to IE was 24.2 +/- 20.5 months. This analysis included 10 episodes of IE (occurring in 9 patients) within the Mayo Clinic Dialysis System during which time 223,358 hemodialysis treatments were delivered, giving a rate of 10 IE episode per 223,336 hemodialysis treatments. Among all 20 IE episodes, there were 14 synthetic arteriovenous grafts, 4 permanent venous dialysis catheters, 2 temporary venous dialysis catheters, and 2 native arteriovenous fistulas (2 accesses in 2 patients), and access had been in place for a mean +/- SD of 15.9 +/- 18.6 months. The portal of infection was the hemodialysis access in 13 episodes of IE. The causative organisms for IE were Staphylococcus aureus in 8 cases, Enterococcus sp in 4 cases, viridans streptococcus in 3 cases, Staphylococcus epidermidis in 2 cases, and 1 case each of Streptococcus bovis, group G beta-hemolytic streptococcus, and Aspergillus sp. The mitral valve was involved in 9 cases, the aortic valve was involved in 5 cases, and the tricuspid and pulmonic valves were involved in 1 case each. Patient survival (after the first episode of IE) was 71% at 30 days; 53% at 60 days; and 35% at 1 year. Echocardiography was performed in 19 episodes of IE. The transthoracic echocardiogram was 62.5% sensitive and 40% specific for the presence of definite or probable vegetations. Univariate analysis for factors affecting 60-day survival show that presence of right-sided IE, vegetation size greater than 2.0 cm3, diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, and initial leukocyte count greater than 12.5 x 10(9)/L were poor prognostic factors. Aortic valve involvement carried a better prognosis. CONCLUSIONS: Infective endocarditis in hemodialysis patients is relatively infrequent but has a high mortality. Patients with synthetic intravascular dialysis angioaccess (synthetic grafts and venous catheters) are more likely to develop IE than patients with native arteriovenous fistulas. Transesophageal echocardiography is a preferred echocardiographic study for suspected cases of IE. Prolonged antibiotic therapy is needed for all patients, and close monitoring is needed for patients with right-sided IE, large vegetations, diabetes mellitus, and an elevated leukocyte count.
TI  - Udder health and risk factors for subclinical mastitis in organic dairy farms in  Switzerland.
AB  - 1+ were submitted for somatic cell counting (SCC), bacteriological examination and to test for antibiotic susceptibility. The SCC and germ-cell counts of monthly bulk-tank milk samples were available through Dairy Inspection and Advisory Services and milk production data of 567 herd-book cows were available from breeding associations. Possible individual and environmental predictors of subclinical mastitis were identified using logistic models adjusted for clustering of the data at herd and cow levels. Data were analyzed separately for cows from 7 to 100 and from 101 to 305 days post partum. Prevalences of subclinical mastitis at the quarter level were 21.2% for lactation period 7-100 days and 34.5% for 101-305 days post partum. The geometric mean SCC in bulk-tank milk samples was 85.6x10(3)cells/ml. Samples at 7-100 and 101-305 days post partum were positive for Staphylococcus aureus in 16.0 and 7.4%, for coagulase-negative Staphylococci in 51.5 and 50.6%, for Streptococcus agalactiae in 0.0 and 0.8%, for other Streptococci in 19.4 and 15.6%, for E. coli in 1.0 and 0.4%, and for Corynebacterium bovis in 25.7 and 45.1%, respectively. Risks of subclinical mastitis increased significantly with increasing days post partum and advancing age of cow. Cows that were sampled when staying in alpine dairies had considerably higher risks of subclinical mastitis than cows staying in home barns. Significantly lower risks of subclinical mastitis were observed in farms where CMT was performed regularly as a control measure. Bacteria in milk from cows with mastitis exhibited antibiotic resistance at a comparable frequency as found previously in conventional farms.
TI  - Infective endocarditis in a tertiary-care hospital in southern Israel.
AB  - During the years 1980-1994, 84 patients were treated in our institution due to suspected infective endocarditis (IE). Seventy-one of these episodes occurring in 71 patients, classified definite or possible according to the Duke criteria, were retrospectively analyzed in this study. There were 52 cases of native valve endocarditis, 7 cases of early prosthetic valve endocarditis, and 12 cases of late prosthetic valve endocarditis. The incidence of IE did not change significantly during the study period. The overall mortality rate was 15%. Only one case of drug addiction appeared in our series despite its growing frequency in Israel. Rheumatic heart disease remained the main underlying cardiac condition and Streptococcus viridans remained the most common pathogen. Streptococcus bovis was found to be a significant pathogen causing IE in our patient population, while Staphylococcus aureus appeared to be less frequent. The Duke criteria significantly classified a greater proportion of cases as definitive, as opposed to the von Reyn criteria. Fewer cases were rejected by the Duke criteria, especially culture-negative cases, and those without histopathological confirmation. Application of the Duke criteria permits a more consistent approach to the diagnosis of IE, even in a non-drug-addict patient population.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of moxifloxacin against Gram-positive clinical isolates.
AB  - The in vitro activity of moxifloxacin was compared with that of 15 antibacterial  agents against 513 Gram-positive microorganisms. The MIC(90) (mg/L) of moxifloxacin was 0.06 for quinolone-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, 0.12 for Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae; 0.25 for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus bovis, Streptococcus anginosus and Actinomyces pyogenes; 0.5 for Streptococcus sanguis and Listeria monocytogenes, 2 for Corynebacterium jekeium and Bifidobacterium bivius. Over 50% of Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, quinolone-resistant staphylococci, Nocardia steroides and Clostridium difficile were susceptible to 2 mg/L moxifloxacin. Moxifloxacin and trovafloxacin demonstrated comparably high activity towards Gram-positive cocci; moxifloxacin and clinafloxacin were most active against Gram-positive bacilli.
TI  - Lactoferrin concentration in milk of bovine clinical mastitis.
AB  - The lactoferrin (LF) concentration in the milk from dairy cows with clinical mastitis was determined to evaluate the relationship between the LF concentration (LFC) in milk and the non-specific defensive capability of the udder. The mean LFC in 368 milk samples from 319 cows with clinical mastitis was significantly higher (p < 0.01) than that of normal cows. The mean LFC in milk from quarters infected with Mycoplasma bovis or Staphylococcus aureus was significantly higher (p < 0.05) than that of quarters infected with coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS). In Escherichia coli mastitis, the level of LFC in milk from cows with peracute mastitis was significantly lower (p < 0.01) than that from cows with acute mastitis. In cases of mastitis due to E. coli, the mean LFC in milk from cows that needed more than 10 days to recover from the mastitis or were not cured was significantly lower (p < 0.05) than that for cows which took less than 10 days to be cured. The mean LFC in milk from cows with peracute E. coli mastitis was significantly lower (p < 0.05) than that for cows with mastitis associated with environmental streptococci or CNS, although these low LF levels were somewhat increased after 46 h from the occurrence of mastitis. These results suggest that the decreased levels of LF in peracute E. coli mastitis may be associated with the progress of inflammation in the early phase of mastitis.
TI  - Evaluation of a postmilking teat disinfectant containing a phenolic combination for the prevention of mastitis in lactating dairy cows.
AB  - A trial was conducted for 12 months in a herd of 120 Holstein cows in order to determine the efficacy of a teat disinfectant, which contained a phenolic combination, for the prevention of bovine intramammary infections during lactation. Postmilking teat disinfection was compared to a negative control using a split-udder experimental design. The percentage of quarters newly infected by mastitis pathogens was 45% lower in mammary glands with teats that had been dipped in the experimental teat disinfectant after milking than it was in undipped controls. New infections caused by Streptococcus uberis, Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species, and Corynebacterium bovis were significantly lower in mammary glands with teats that had been dipped in the experimental teat disinfectant than in undipped controls. No statistical differences in the incidence of clinical mastitis between treatment groups were observed. No irritation or chapping of teats dipped in the experimental teat disinfectant were observed. The results of this study suggest that the experimental teat disinfectant containing a phenolic combination is an effective postmilking teat disinfectant for use in the prevention of new intramammary infections by both contagious and environmental mastitis pathogens.
TI  - Meningitis caused by streptococci other than Streptococcus pneumoniae: a retrospective clinical study.
AB  - We reviewed the medical records of 26 patients (median age 62 years, range 5-76 years) admitted to our institution during 1978-98 with acute bacterial meningitis (ABM) caused by streptococci other than Streptococcus pneumoniae (comprising 1.9% of all patients with ABM). 19 cases were community-acquired and 7 were nosocomial. 73% had comorbid or predisposing conditions and 73% had an identifiable extracerebral focus; only in 2 patients no comorbid disease, primary focus or predisposing condition was present. Five patients had cerebral abscesses, and 5 had endocarditis. Beta-haemolytic streptococci were grown in 14 cases (serotype A: 4, B: 5, C: 1, G: 4) and were predominant among patients with endocarditis, whereas alpha- or non-haemolytic strains grew in 12 cases (S. mitis: 4, S. constellatus: 2, E. faecalis: 2, S. bovis: 1, unspecified: 3) and were predominant in patients with a brain abscess. Staphylococcus aureus grew together with a streptococcus in 2 cases. Blood culture was positive in 9 cases (35%). Neurologic complications occurred in 11 patients (42%) and extraneurologic complications in 18 patients (69%). Adverse outcomes occurred in 10 patients (38%), including 3 patients who died. Occurrence of seizures at any time of disease was significantly associated with an adverse outcome; no other clinical or paraclinical features appeared to affect outcome.
TI  - Spectrum and antimicrobial activity of alexomycin (PNU-82, 127), a peptide compound projected for use in animal health.
AB  - Alexomycin (PNU-82, 127) is a thiopeptide antimicrobial complex intended for veterinary practice that belongs to a series of cyclic peptides produced by Streptomyces arginensis. MICs against selected routine and fastidious clinical isolates of animal and human origin were determined by broth microdilution or agar dilution reference methods. Alexomycin was active against Gram-positive pathogens such as oxacillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci (260 strains; MIC90, 0.5 microgram/mL), as well as Enterococcus species (95 strains; MIC90, 0.25 to 0.5 microgram/mL), and generally inactive against Gram-negative aerobes. Alexomycin had more potent activity against Streptococcus bovis (MIC90, 0.12 microgram/mL), S. agalactiae (MIC90, 0.12 microgram/mL), Corynebacterium species (MIC90, 0.06-0.12 microgram/mL), and Listeria monocytogenes (MIC90, 0.5 microgram/mL). Alexomycin activity was limited against Bacillus species (MIC90, 1 microgram/mL), Neisseria meningiditis (MIC90, 2 micrograms/mL), Haemophilus influenzae (MIC90, 8 micrograms/mL), Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC90, 16 micrograms/mL), and Campylobacter jejuni (MIC90, 32 micrograms/mL). This thiopeptide complex was also found to be stable at low concentrations (0.015-32 micrograms/mL) in Mueller-Hinton broth for up to 24 h, possesses static antimicrobial activity and did not produce resistant mutants after multiple passages at subinhibitory drug concentrations. Alexomycin seems to have potential for use as a feed additive to increase feed efficiency and promote growth in poultry and swine as well as other applications against Gram-positive pathogens.
TI  - Correlation between quinolone susceptibility patterns and sequences in the A and  B subunits of DNA gyrase in mycobacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activities of seven quinolones and the sequences of the quinolone resistance-determining regions (QRDR) in the A and B subunits of DNA gyrase were determined for 14 mycobacterial species. On the basis of quinolone activity, quinolones were arranged from that with the greatest to that with the least activity as follows: sparfloxacin, levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, pefloxacin, flumequine, and nalidixic acid. Based on MICs, the species could be organized into three groups: resistant (Mycobacterium avium, M. intracellulare, M. marinum, M. chelonae, M. abscessus [ofloxacin MICs, >/=8 microg/ml]), moderately susceptible (M. tuberculosis, M. bovis BCG, M. kansasii, M. leprae, M. fortuitum third biovariant, M. smegmatis [ofloxacin MICs, 0.5 to 1 microg/ml]), and susceptible (M. fortuitum, M. peregrinum, M. aurum [ofloxacin MICs, </=0.25 microg/ml]). Peptide sequences of the QRDR of GyrB were identical in all the species, including the amino acids at the three positions known to be involved in acquired resistance to quinolone, i.e., 426 (Asp), 447 (Arg), and 464 (Asn) (numbering system used for Escherichia coli). The last two residues could be involved in the overall low level of susceptibility of mycobacteria to quinolones since they differ from those found in the very susceptible E. coli (Lys-447 and Ser-464) but are identical to those found in the less susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Peptide sequences of the QRDR of GyrA were identical in all the species, except for the amino acid at position 83, which was an alanine in the two less susceptible groups and a serine in the most susceptible one, as in E. coli, suggesting that this amino acid is involved in the observed differences of quinolone susceptibility within the Mycobacterium genus.
TI  - [Genotyping of isolates of bacteria and Candida].
AB  - Strain differentiation of Staphylococcus species, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Clostridium difficile, and Candida species was performed by restriction endonuclease analysis (REA) of genomic DNA with HinfI or HaeIII followed by conventional agarose gel electrophoresis. REA of 19 methicillin-resistant S. aureus isolates and 19 methicillin-susceptible S. aureus isolates revealed 8, and 14 patterns, respectively. Fifty-three isolates of S. epidermidis were divided into 39 groups on the basis of REA pattern. REA patterns obtained from different strains of the same species were more similar than those from different Staphylococcus species. A total of 67 patterns were noted among 215 S. pneumoniae isolates. There was some correlation between the REA patterns and serotypes. In addition, all 61 isolates showing the pattern 6 (serotype 19) were penicillin-resistant. Sixteen isolates of E. coli O157 and 18 isolates of E. coli O25 were analyzed by REA with HaeIII. Among 14 epidemiologically unrelated E. coli O157:H7 isolates, REA patterns were either identical or differed only by a few fragment bands. REA patterns of 7 isolates of heat stable enterotoxin producing E. coli O25 from an outbreak were identical. Eight distinct REA patterns were noted among 7 toxigenic C. difficile strains, and one to two strains were included in each group. Candida strains belonging to different six Candida species were analysed by REA. All C. albicans isolates (148 strains) showed one to four bright bands ranging from 4 to 8kb in size, and these strains were divided into 37 groups according to the REA patterns. Each Candida strain showed species-specific REA patterns. Twenty-one isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex were analyzed by PCR with primer complementary to the inverted repeat of IS6110(IS6110-PCR). The results of PCR of 19 M. tuberculosis isolates and 2 M. bovis BCG isolates revealed 15 patterns, and 1 pattern, respectively. Our results demonstrated that REA of genomic DNA with HinfI or HaeIII was a useful tool for strain differentiation. By comparing the species-specific REA patterns of reference strains, clinical isolates of Candida and Staphylococci could be identified to the species level if they could not be identified by routine biochemical methods. Because IS6110-PCR is simple and rapid to perform, it seems to be a good screening method to differentiate M. tuberculosis strains.
TI  - Clinical mastitis in dairy cattle in Ontario: frequency of occurrence and bacteriological isolates.
AB  - The objective of this study was to describe the frequency of occurrence of clinical mastitis in dairy herds in Ontario. The study group consisted of 65 dairy farms involved in a 2-year observational study, which included recording all clinical mastitis cases and milk sampling of quarters with clinical mastitis. Lactational incidence risks of 9.8% for abnormal milk only, 8.2% for abnormal milk with a hard or swollen udder, and 4.4% for abnormal milk plus systemic signs of illness related to mastitis were calculated for 2840 cows and heifers. Overall, 19.8% of cows experienced one or more cases of clinical mastitis during location. Teat injuries occurred in 2.1% of lactations. Standard bacteriology was performed on pretreatment milk samples from 834 cows with clinical mastitis. The bacteria isolated were Staphylococcus aureus (6.7%), Streptococcus agalactiae (0.7%), other Streptococcus spp. (14.1%), coliforms (17.2%), gram-positive bacilli (5.5%), Corynebacterium bovis (1.7%), and other Staphylococcus spp. (28.7%). There was no growth in 17.7% of samples, and 8.3% of samples were contaminated. Clinical mastitis is a common disease in dairy cows in Ontario; approximately 1 in 5 cow lactations have at lease one episode of clinical mastitis. There is, however, considerable variation in the incidence of clinical mastitis among farms. The majority of 1st cases of clinical mastitis occur early in lactation, and the risk of clinical mastitis increases with increasing parity. Environmental, contagious, and minor pathogens were all associated with cases of clinical mastitis.
TI  - Influence of parity and stage of lactation on the somatic cell count in bacteriologically negative dairy cows.
AB  - This study examines the influence of parity, stage of lactation, and single isolations (i.e., the isolation of a microorganism that could not be reisolated in the same quarter in the next sampling) of staphylococci other than Staphylococcus aureus (coagulase-negative staphylococci), Corynebacterium bovis, or esculin-positive cocci other than Streptococcus uberis (referred to as esculin-positive cocci throughout) on the monthly log(e)-transformed somatic cell count (SCC) for 180 first, second, and third parity cows that were observed over a whole lactation. Repeated measures ANOVA was used to analyze the data. No significant effect was found for the infection variable. However, the results indicated that even single isolations of coagulase-negative staphylocci, C. bovis, or esculin-positive cocci resulted in a numerical or statistically significant increase in SCC. Least squares mean SCC (log(e)-transformed) for bacterio-logically negative cows and cows with single isolations of coagulase-negative staphylococci, C. bovis, or esculin-positive cocci were 3.90, 3.97, 4.08, and 4.17, respectively. Significant effects of parity, stage of lactation, and the interaction of parity and stage of lactation could not be found when only bacteriologically negative cows were considered. Least squares mean SCC for first, second, and third parity cows were 3.80, 3.93, and 3.97, respectively. However, the effects of parity, stage of lactation, and the interaction of parity and stage of lactation were significant when all 180 cows were included. Therefore, these effects must be due to factors that were present in the infected groups.
TI  - Efficacy and safety of vancomycin constant-rate infusion in the treatment of chronic Gram-positive bone and joint infections.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of vancomycin constant-rate infusion over 24 h in the treatment of Gram-positive bone infections, METHODS: Vancomycin (40 mg/kg/day) was administered without a loading dose to 15 patients (12 male, three female) aged 23--90 years, weighing 46--85 kg, with postoperative chronic bone and joint infections. The 24-h dose was adjusted to maintain plasma levels between 25 and 35 mg/L. Mean duration of therapy was 6.2 months (4--8.5) via a portable infusion pump. Sites of infection included hip and femur (10), tibia (three), patella (one) and vertebrae (one). Sequestrectomy (two), removal of material (7/8 prosthetic hips, 1/5 metal implants) and debridement (two) were performed at the beginning of the treatment. Involved bacteria included Staphylococcus aureus (eight, six methicillin resistant), S. epidermidis (four methicillin-resistant), Enterococcus faecalis (one), Enterococcus avium (one) and Streptococcus bovis (one). RESULTS: MIC of vancomycin ranged from 1 to 4 mg/L. The mean vancomycin bone concentration when available was 67.7plus minus38.9 microg/L. Based on a mean post-treatment follow-up of 14plus minus4 months (6--20.6), cure was achieved in 10 patients (66.6%). Failures were related to the inability to remove the infected prosthesis (one) or implants (three) and to the persistence of a deep wound abcess (one). Adverse events included pruritus (four cases), tinnitus (two), mild transient elevation of creatinine level (three) and transient neutropenia (two). Vancomycin was maintained in all the patients. CONCLUSIONS: Prolonged treatment with vancomycin constant-rate infusion is effective and safe for treatment of Gram-positive chronic bone and joint infections, providing that complete surgical debridement and prosthetic material removal are performed.
TI  - Comparative in-vitro activities of quinupristin-dalfopristin against Gram-positive bloodstream isolates.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of quinupristin-dalfopristin was compared with those of vancomycin, teicoplanin, erythromycin, clarithromycin, rifampicin, imipenem, meropenem, ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against 414 bloodstream isolates of Gram-positive cocci. Quinupristin-dalfopristin inhibited strains of Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae at 0.12 mg/L, methicillin- and/or erythromycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis at 0.5 mg/L, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus bovis, Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus anginosus at 1 mg/L and Enterococcus faecalis at 8 mg/L.
TI  - Estimation of interdependence among quarters of the bovine udder with subclinical mastitis and implications for analysis.
AB  - Interdependency among udder quarters with subclinical mastitis was evaluated on 150 farms using a total of 35,828 udder quarters. The occurrence of high somatic cell count (SCC) (> 250,000 cells/ml) in 0, 3, and 4 quarters occurred at a higher rate than would be expected based on independence of the quarters. For all bacterial species, intramammary infection in 0, 2, 3, or 4 quarters of the same cow occurred at a higher rate than would be expected based on independence of the quarters. Intramammary infection and high SCC were found less often in front quarters than in rear quarters. High SCC and intramammary infection occurred more often in right front quarters than in left front quarters. High SCC in diagonal quarters occurred at a lower rate than expected. Corynebacterium bovis, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Staphylococcus aureus had the highest intraclass correlation within herd. Streptococcus uberis had a very low intraclass correlation within herd. The intraclass correlation within cow for the natural logarithm of SCC was 0.47. Corynebacterium bovis and Strep. agalactiae had the highest intraclass correlation within cow, and Streptococcus dysgalactiae had the lowest. Analytical methods were proposed to manage the problem of interdependence and its effect on the design or evaluation of field studies on subclinical mastitis.
TI  - Association between management practices, dairy herd characteristics, and somatic cell count of bulk tank milk.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether particular dairy management practices and herd characteristics were associated with somatic cell count (SCC) of bulk tank milk. DESIGN: Analysis of records. SAMPLE POPULATION: Milk samples collected from 59,435 cows housed in 843 dairy herds between March 1992 and June 1994. PROCEDURE: Results of bacterial culture of milk samples and data on farm housing, sanitation, milking system, and management were collected. Multiple regression analysis was used to determine sources of variation in bulk tank milk SCC among herds. RESULTS: Prevalence of Streptococcus agalactiae and Staphylococcus aureus mastitis was associated with bulk tank milk SCC. In herds free of S agalactiae mastitis, prevalence of S aureus and Corynebacterium bovis mastitis were important. For herds without S agalactiae mastitis, use of sawdust bedding was associated with a decrease in SCC and a dirty loose housing area was associated with an increase. Increased milk production, repeated mastitis control visits, and use of particular predip compounds were significantly associated with reduced SCC in all herds, regardless of whether any cows in the herd had S agalactiae mastitis. In herds with S agalactiae mastitis, use of iodine (certain concentrations), chlorhexidine, peroxide, or sodium chlorite-lactic acid as a predip was associated with a decrease in SCC. Only use of sodium chlorite-lactic acid predip was significantly associated with a decrease in SCC in herds without S agalactiae mastitis. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Important factors associated with bulk tank milk SCC were prevalence of S agalactiae and S aureus mastitis, careful application of particular predip compounds, avoiding a dirty loose housing area, and use of a service to regularly monitor prevalence of mastitis in the herd.
TI  - In-vitro activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin compared with other widely used antibiotics against strains isolated from patients with endocarditis.
AB  - The activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin was compared with that of other widely  used antibiotics against 355 strains isolated from patients with endocarditis. MICs were determined by a standard agar dilution method. Quinupristin/dalfopristin was inhibitory at 1 mg/L for all coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 36) and for the majority of Staphylococcus aureus strains (n = 87). The activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin against 186 viridans streptococci was somewhat dependent on the species, with MIC50s ranging from 0.5 to 2 mg/L, being least active against Streptococcus bovis and most active against Streptococcus gordonii and Streptococcus mitis. For the staphylococci, quinupristin/dalfopristin was as active against erythromycin-susceptible as erythromycin-resistant strains. Viridans streptococci showed a slight but significant correlation between sensitivity to erythromycin and quinupristin/dalfopristin. It is concluded that quinupristin/dalfopristin has the potential to treat serious infections such as endocarditis caused by Gram-positive cocci.
TI  - Effect of natural infection with minor pathogens on susceptibility to natural infection with major pathogens in the bovine mammary gland.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of natural udder infection with minor pathogens on subsequent natural infection with major pathogens. SAMPLE POPULATION: 7 dairy herds with low bulk milk somatic cell count. PROCEDURE: During a 20-month prospective study, milk samples were collected from diary cows at regular intervals and from quarters with clinical signs of mastitis. Incidence of intramammary infection was calculated in uninfected quarters and in quarters infected with minor pathogens. A within-cow, matched case-control analysis was used to evaluate the effect of minor pathogens on subsequent infection with major pathogens. RESULTS: Quarters infected with minor pathogens had higher somatic cell count than did uninfected quarters. In quarters infected with Corynebacterium bovis, the rate of infection with major pathogens was lower, whereas in quarters infected with coagulase-negative Micrococcaceae, the rate of infection with major pathogens was higher than that in uninfected quarters. From the within-cow comparison, it appeared that, in quarters infected with minor pathogens, infection with major pathogens was significantly lower than that in comparable control quarters not infected with minor pathogens. CONCLUSIONS: Minor pathogens have a protective effect against infection with major pathogens. The protective effect of C bovis against subsequent infection with major pathogens appears to be greater than the effect of coagulase-negative Micrococcaceae.
TI  - [Serologic study in patients with streptococcal infective endocarditis].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Infective endocarditis is a systemic disease in which there are a continuously antigenic stimulation of immunologic system. Streptococcus is still the most frequent cause of infective endocarditis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We investigated the presence of antibody (AB), total and IgM by indirect immune fluorescence technique, in four groups of population: streptococcal infective endocarditis (SIE), streptococcal bacteraemia (SB), Staphylococcus aureus endocarditis, and healthy people. Antigens used were: 1) their own strain isolated from the blood of patients with SIE and SB inverted question markhomologous AB inverted question mark, and; 2) seven species of Streptococcus: Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus bovis, Streptococcus sanguis I, Streptococcus sanguis II, nutritional dependent streptococci and Enterococcus faecalis (heterologous AB). RESULTS: Homologous antibodies: titers > or = 1/512 were found in all patients with SIE and only in 2 with SB (sensitivity 100% and specificity 93%). IgM titer (threshold 1/32) was positive only in patients with SIE (sensitivity 75,5% and specificity 100%). The fall of the AB titer was continuous and slow, despite the good clinical evolution of patients. (AB titers were > or = 1/512 and IgM > or = 1/64 in 30% of patients 1 year later). Heterologous AB: in spite of statistically significant difference found in SIE versus the other groups, sensitivity of this test (threshold 1/256) is low, confidence interval include expected random value (50%), specificity is 88%. CONCLUSIONS: The utility of homologous AB for diagnosing infective endocarditis is demonstrated. On the contrary for heterologous AB, antigenic common fractions must be found in the different species.
TI  - Purification and partial characterization of a novel antibacterial agent (Bac1829) Produced by Staphylococcus aureus KSI1829.
AB  - A novel antimicrobial agent from Staphylococcus aureus KSI1829, designated Bac1829, was purified by sequential steps of ammonium sulfate precipitation, Sephadex G-50 gel filtration chromatography, and hydrophobic interaction chromatography. Purified Bac1829 has a molecular mass of 6,418 +/- 2 Da. The peptide in heat stable, since full biological activity is retained after heating at 95 degrees C for 15 min, and it is destroyed by digestion with proteases. Amino acid sequence analysis revealed a high concentration of Ala and Gly residues, which respectively comprised 24 and 19% of the total amino acid content. Additionally, high levels of hydrophobic amino acids were present, accounting for the hydrophobic nature of Bac1829. Purified Bac1829 killed exponentially growing Corynebacterium renale in a dose-dependent manner by a bactericidal mode of action. A partial inhibitory spectrum analysis revealed that the following organisms were sensitive to the inhibitory activity of Bac1829: S. aureus RN4220, Streptococcus suis, Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis, C. renale, Corynebacterium diptheriae, Haemophilus parasuis, Bordetella pertussis, Bordetella bronchoseptica, Moraxella bovis, and Pasteurella multocida.
TI  - The prevalence of mastitis in primiparous heifers in eleven Waikato dairy herds.
AB  - The objective of the study was to determine the prevalence of mastitis among primiparous heifers at calving and at drying off in 11 Waikato dairy herds during the 1993-94 dairy production season. Duplicate quarter milk samples were collected aseptically from 458 heifers within 5 days after calving for bacteriological analysis. Mastitis was diagnosed in at least one quarter in 35.6% of these heifers. Coagulase-negative staphylococci were isolated from 21.8% of the heifers. The prevalence of coagulase-negative staphylococci varied between herds from 4.3% to 44.8%. Environmental streptococci caused mastitis in 12.2% of heifers, ranging from 5.6% to 24.1% between herds. Streptococcus uberus was the pathogen identified most frequently at calving and accounted for more than 90% of the streptococcal isolates. Staphylococcus aureus and coliforms were isolated from less than 1% of samples. Clinical mastitis was observed in 8.1% of heifers at calving; environmental streptococci were isolated from 67.6% of these clinical clinical cases. Only 2.8% of heifers developed clinical mastitis during lactation and environmental streptococci were isolated from 38.5% of these cases. The prevalence of mastitis among 428 of the heifers at drying off was 64.7%; a 1.8 fold increase during lactation. Corynebactetium bovis was isolated from 43% of heifers at drying off even though it was not isolated from any heifers at calving. During the season, the prevalence of Staphylococcus aureus mastitis increased to 2.8% while mastitis caused by environmental streptococci declined to 2.8%. The prevalence of environmental mastitis pathogens decreased during lactation while contagious pathogens increased in each of the 11 herds. Ineffective post-milking teat sanitation probably contributed to the increase in mastitis caused by contagious pathogens. Specific factors were not determined that affected the variation in prevalence between herds.
TI  - Polymerase chain reaction of bacterial genomes with single universal primer: application to distinguishing mycobacteria species.
AB  - The polymerase chain reaction with a single universal primer (UP-PCR) was applied to bacterial strains and mycobacteria isolates alongside conventional methods. A universal protocol of preparation of PCR samples from cultures representing Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycobacterium bovis, and several non-tuberculous mycobacteria was found to be reproducible and efficient with these organisms. The bands of UP-PCR products observed in an agarose gel after electrophoresis were species-specific and provided an efficient means of distinguishing bacterial species. The applicability of this approach to mycobacteria identification was assessed by comparing the DNA bands obtained for different strains. Three reference strains and 22 clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis and M. bovis produced very similar DNA banding patterns. They comprised a triplet of prominent and several minor fragments within the 200-500 base pair (bp) size range and were the easiest to interpret. The DNA profiles of unrelated mycobacteria clearly differed from each other when subjected to electrophoretic analysis and correlated well with results of culture method. The method provides a real promise of its application in clinical studies as a simple assay for distinguishing between tubercle bacilli.
TI  - Inducer expulsion and the occurrence of an HPr(Ser-P)-activated sugar-phosphate phosphatase in Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  - Inducer expulsion, a phenomenon in which rapidly metabolizable sugars cause cytoplasmic dephosphorylation and efflux of pre-accumulated sugar-phosphates (sugar-P), has been documented for Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus bovis, and Lactococcus lactis, but not for other Gram-positive bacteria. Using intact cells and membrane vesicles, we show that Enterococcus faecalis exhibits both inducer exclusion and inducer expulsion, and that the latter phenomenon is dependent on the metabolite-activated ATP-dependent HPr(Ser) kinase that phosphorylates Ser-46 in HPr of the phosphotransferase system. A small, heat-stable, membrane-associated, HPr(Ser-P)-activated sugar-P phosphatase (Pase II), previously identified only in Lc. lactis, is shown to be present in extracts of Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus pyogenes but not in those of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, or Bacillis subtilis, organisms that do not exhibit the inducer expulsion phenomenon. Further, Lactobacillus brevis, an organism that exhibits inducer expulsion by a different mechanism, also apparently lacks Pase II. The results reveal that Pase II is present in those organisms that exhibit the coupled sugar-P hydrolysis/expulsion mechanism but not those that lack this mechanism. They provide correlative evidence that Pase II initiates inducer expulsion in species of enterococci, streptococci and lactococci.
TI  - Effects of freezing on the viability of nine pathogens from quarters with subclinical mastitis.
AB  - Milk samples from 45 quarters containing mastitis pathogens were collected from lactating cows to determine the viability of those pathogens after freezing. An initial bacteria count was conducted, and samples were divided into 2-ml portions and frozen. Weekly bacteria counts were conducted for 6 wk. Viability after freezing was determined on five isolates of nine bacterial species: Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus hyicus, Staphylococcus chromogenes, Staphylococcus xylosus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus uberis, Corynebacterium bovis, and Escherichia coli. Bacteria counts were converted to logarithm base 10, and analysis of variance was conducted to determine alterations in viability over the 6-wk period. Freezing of quarter milk samples for 6 wk did not affect viability of any of these pathogens.
TI  - Field trial evaluation of two teat dips containing nisin or polyvinylpyrrolidone  iodophor designed for use before and after milking.
AB  - In a first trial involving six commercial dairy herds and 291 cows for a period of eight months, pre-milking udder sanitation by dipping teats in a 0.25% polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) iodophor product followed by wiping with paper towels was compared in each herd with traditional teat washing and wiping with individual udder cloths. The incidence of new intramammary infections by Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus uberis and Corynebacterium bovis were significantly (P < 0.05) reduced, respectively by 48%, 60% and 47%. There were no significant differences in the two groups of cows for other intramammary infections, total bacterial counts, clostridia spore counts, iodine residues in milk or teat condition scores. In a second trial involving nine commercial dairy herds and 367 cows for a period of seven months, a teat dip containing nisin used before and after milking was compared in each herd with a classical 0.5% iodophor product used in the same way. There was no significant difference in the incidence of new intramammary infections, in spite of a higher rate of new Staphylococcus aureus infections in the group of cows teat-dipped with the nisin product (P = 0.06). It was concluded that pre-dipping with teat dips specifically designed to be safely used before milking can be more efficient than traditional pre-milking udder preparation. These teat dips, when used before and after milking, seem to be as efficient as products which should normally be restricted to post-milking use.
TI  - Positive inotropic effect of Streptococcus faecalis in isolated cardiac muscle.
AB  - Infective endocarditis is caused by bacterial colonization of the endocardium. Because endocardium modulates mechanical performance of subjacent myocardium, we studied acute effects of bacteria on isolated cardiac muscle and on the functional role of the endocardium. Bacteria, grown in broth at 37 degrees C, were added at increasing concentrations (10(2) to 10(6) bacteria/ml) to cat papillary muscles in Krebs-Ringer solution (1.25 mM Ca2+, 35 degrees C). The endocardial surface was damaged by exposing muscles to a stream of dry air for 30 s. Streptococcus (Enterococcus) faecalis induced significant increases in total peak isometric twitch tension (TT) and maximal velocity of unloaded shortening (Vmax) and significant decreases in time to TT (TtTT) and time to half isometric twitch tension decline (RT 1/2), both before and after removal of endocardial endothelium. This response could also be elicited with bacterial filtrate, after boiling the filtrate or after extracting the polysaccharides from it with KIO4. Increasing Ca2+ concentrations progressively reduced the response to the filtrate. Propranolol slightly, although not significantly, diminished the effects on TT and Vmax while abolishing the effects on TtTT and on RT 1/2. By contrast, Streptococcus bovis and Staphylococcus aureus did not affect TT or Vmax but induced a slight but significant decrease in TtTT at the highest concentration of bacteria. Accordingly, the filtrate of Strep. faecalis induces a positive inotropic effect. The active component is neither a protein nor a polysaccharide, and its effect may be partly beta-adrenoceptor mediated. Strep. bovis and Staph. aureus have negligible acute effects on contractility.
TI  - Penetration of ceftriaxone into the intervertebral disc.
AB  - Concentrations of ceftriaxone in serum and intervertebral disc tissue were determined with high-pressure liquid chromatography in forty-five patients after a single intravenous loading dose of 1000 milligrams given at different intervals before an operation on the spine. The mean serum concentrations in this study corresponded well with reported values. The mean tissue concentrations were 5.6 micrograms per gram (95 per cent confidence interval, 3.6 to 6.8 micrograms per gram) one to less than two hours after administration of the antibiotic, 6.4 micrograms per gram (95 per cent confidence interval, 2.8 to 10.0 micrograms per gram) two to less than four hours, and 3.6 micrograms per gram (95 per cent confidence interval, 0.6 to 6.6 micrograms per gram) at fourteen to less than sixteen hours. These drug concentrations exceed the minimum inhibitory concentration that was effective against 90 per cent of the bacteria for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus; for Streptococcus pyogenes, agalactiae, viridans, pneumoniae, and bovis; and for community-acquired Enterobacteriaceae. The average serum-to-tissue ratio was 191:1 at less than one-half hour and 13:1 at less than one and a half hours. The lower values of the 95 per cent confidence intervals for the concentration of the antibiotic exceeded the minimum inhibitory concentrations in the disc tissue against most susceptible bacteria during the period between one and a half and four hours, but a larger bolus would be needed to maintain this level for a longer period (such as in a longer operation) and as prophylaxis against methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci.
TI  - Endocarditis with pericardial bioprostheses: clinico-pathologic characteristics,  immediate and long term prognosis.
AB  - Between 1977 and 1992, 30 consecutive episodes of infective endocarditis in 28 patients involving pericardial bioprostheses were diagnosed and treated in our hospital. Eleven (37%) were early pericardial valve endocarditis occurring in the first 60 days following valve surgery, and 19 (63%) were late endocarditis. In both the early and late groups, more aortic that mitral valves were affected (19/30). The most frequent pathogen in the early cases was staphylococcus, (S. epidermidis in five cases, S. aureus in one). The most frequent pathogen among late cases was streptococcus: (St. viridans in four, St. faecalis in two, St. bovis in one). In four cases (13%) no pathogen was isolated. Twelve patients received antibiotic treatment alone, six specific for the pathogen and other six only arbitrarily chosen regimen. All patients were cured in the former and all patients died in the latter group (four with negative blood cultures and two in whom identification of the pathogen was delayed-Proteus mirabillis in one case and Brucella mellitensis in the other). Valve replacement during the infective endocarditis episode was necessary in 18 cases, either because of failure of the antibiotic treatment or because of heart failure secondary to prosthetic malfunction. Peri-annular abscess was present in five cases. Surgical mortality was 22.2% (4/18). In all, 11 patients (39%) died during the active stage of infective endocarditis. The most frequent cause of death was heart failure (45.5%). All four patients with negative blood cultures died. The most advisable strategy for treating bacterial endocarditis of pericardial bioprostheses is a combination of antibiotic therapy and early surgery, especially in cases of staphylococcus endocarditis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [Bacterial endocarditis: current bacteriological data].
AB  - The bacteria causing infective endocarditis have not changed significantly despite the diversity of potential portals of entry. Streptococci (viridans) cause 35 to 45% of cases of endocarditis. Group D streptococci of gastrointestinal origin cause about 20% of cases of endocarditis: Streptococcus bovis is the most commonly isolated species followed by the enterococcus. The beta-haemolytic streptococci of Groups A, B, C and G are rarely isolated. Seventeen to thirty per cent of endocarditis is caused by staphylococci, above all Staphylococcus aureus. These infections are mainly observed in patients with prosthetic valves or intravenous catheters and in intravenous drug addicts. With respect to gram-negative bacilli, enterobacteria are rarely responsible for endocarditis and those of the HACEK group (Haemophilus, Actinobacillus, Cardiobacterium, etc.) were isolated in 3% of cases. Q fever and Chlamydia endocarditis are rare, as are fungal infections usually due to Candida. Endocarditis with negative blood cultures is still observed in about 10% of cases.
TI  - Contagious mastitis.
AB  - Contagious mastitis is defined. The major mastitis pathogens are Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, Corynebacterium bovis, Mycoplasma sp, and Streptococcus dysgalactiae. These pathogens are discussed relative to prevalence, virulence factors, pathology, and control. These control measures include milking time hygiene, segregation, culling, vaccination, and treatment.
TI  - Recurrent infective endocarditis.
AB  - Infective endocarditis is a serious disease associated with high mortality. Patients surviving recurrent bouts of infective endocarditis are reported infrequently. We report on a non-drug abuser patient who experienced seven episodes of infective endocarditis--the largest number reported to our knowledge in a single non-drug abuser patient.
TI  - The inhibition by ionophores in vitro of an Enterococcus-like pathogen of rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss.
AB  - Streptococcosis is a major disease of several fish species in Australia, Japan and South Africa. The minimum inhibitory concentration of some ionophores (lasalocid, monensin, narasin and salinomycin) was determined in vitro for an Enterococcus-like species pathogenic for rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) in Australia. Forty isolates of the fish pathogen were tested, together with control strains of Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212 and Streptococcus bovis ATCC 9809. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of erythromycin, the drug of choice for controlling streptococcosis, ranged between 0.1 and 0.8 microgram/ml whereas the MIC values for the ionophores ranged between 0.2 and 1.5 micrograms/ml. Of the ionophores tested, narasin was the most inhibitory (0.2-0.4 microgram/ml), while monensin was the least inhibitory (0.4-1.5 micrograms/ml). Salinomycin was marginally more inhibitory (0.4-0.8 microgram/ml) than lasalocid (0.8 microgram/ml).
TI  - The efficacy of teicoplanin in the treatment of endocarditis caused by gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - Twenty-six patients with endocarditis caused by Streptococcus viridans (n = 12),  Enterococcus faecalis (n = 5), Streptococcus bovis (n = 2), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 3) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 4) were treated with teicoplanin at a dose of 600 mg/day in patients with normal renal function (creatinine clearance 80-120 mL/min) and at a dose of 400 mg/day in patients with moderately impaired renal function (creatinine clearance < 75 mL/min). In nine patients valve replacements were performed. Twenty-one patients were cured by medical treatment with teicoplanin, five patients had a surgical intervention during treatment which was subsequently stopped. Overall, eighteen patients with native valve endocarditis were cured. Out of eight patients with prosthetic valve endocarditis six patients were cured. In one patient teicoplanin therapy was withdrawn because of clinical failure. One patient had a clinical relapse. All cultures taken from blood, endocardium and excised artificial valves were sterile after a minimum of seven days therapy. Side effects were seen in seven patients and included a moderate increase in liver enzymes and mild leucopenia. No renal toxicity was observed, trough serum levels of teicoplanin were not correlated with renal function, a slight accumulation of teicoplanin on day 28 being seen. Our study confirms that teicoplanin is effective as single agent therapy in the treatment of endocarditis due to Gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - The antimicrobial activity and beta-lactamase stability of cefpirome, a new fourth-generation cephalosporin in comparison with other agents.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of cefpirome was compared with amoxycillin/clavulanic  acid, ampicillin/sulbactam, cefuroxime, ceftazidime, gentamicin and amikacin against 743 non-duplicate clinical isolates. MIC50 and MIC90 showed that the antibiotic was active against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive organisms. Cefpirome was highly active against most of the Enterobacteriaceae, including indole-positive Proteus spp., Aeromonas spp. (MIC < or = 1 mg/L) and Salmonella spp. (MIC < or = 0.5 mg/L). Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Haemophilus influenzae (including beta-lactamase producers) were all susceptible, with MIC less than 0.5 and 0.25 mg/L respectively. Cefpirome was more active than cefuroxime and ceftazidime against Campylobacter spp. (MIC < or = 2 mg/L), but less active than ceftazidime against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Cefpirome was active against Streptococcus pneumoniae. Streptococcus bovis and coagulase-negative staphylococci (MIC < or = 0.5 mg/L) and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MIC < or = 2 mg/L). Methicillin-resistant S. aureus, Gram-positive and Gram-negative anaerobes were resistant to cefpirome. The stability of cefpirome to TEM-1, TEM-2, PSE-1, SHV-1 and the chromosomal-mediated P99 and K-1 beta-lactamases was comparable to ceftazidime.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of FK-037, a parenteral cephalosporin.
AB  - The in vitro activity of FK-037, 5-amino-2-[[(6R, 7R)-7-[[(Z)-2-(2-amino-4-thiazolyl)-2- methoxyimino) acetyl] amino]-2-carboxy-8-oxo-5-thia-1- azabicyclo[4.2.0]oct-2-en-3-yl]methyl]-1-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1H-pyrazoli um hydroxide, inner salt, sulfate (1:1), a new parenteral cephem, was compared with those of cefepime, ceftazidime, imipenem, and ciprofloxacin. FK-037 inhibited methicillin-susceptible staphylocci at < or = 4 micrograms/ml. Of 98 isolates of homogenous methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, 55 (56.1%) were inhibited by 8 micrograms of FK-037 per ml, compared to 3.1% for cefepime. Imipenem was the most active beta-lactam tested against staphylococci. The MIC of FK-037 for 90% of the strains tested (MIC90) was 0.06 micrograms/ml for hemolytic streptococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, viridans group streptococci, and Streptococcus bovis. The MIC90 for many of the members of the family Enterobacteriaceae was 1 microgram/ml, similar to that of cefepime and lower than those of ceftazidime and imipenem. The MIC90 for Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae was 8 micrograms/ml, similar to that for cefepime, but all isolates were inhibited by 2 micrograms of imipenem per ml. K. pneumoniae isolates with cefotaxime and ceftazidime MICs of > 32 micrograms/ml with Bush type 2b' beta-lactamases were inhibited by 4 micrograms of FK-037 per ml. E. cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, and S. aureus stably resistant to FK-037 could be selected by repeated transfer in the presence of FK-037. The FK-037 MIC90 for Pseudomonas aeruginosa was 4 microgram/ml, compared to 32 microgram/ml for cefepime and ceftazidime and 8 microgram/ml for imipenem. Xanthomonas maltophilia, Pseudomonas cepacia, Acinetobacter anitratus, and Bacteroides species were resistant to FK-037 (MIC, more than or equal 32 microgram/ml). MBCs were identical to or within twofold of the MICs except for a 32-fold greater MBC for P. aeruginosa. Inoculum size and acid environment did not lower the activity of FK-037. FK-037 was not appreciably hydrolyzed by Bush group 1, 2a, 2b, and 2e beta-lactamases but was hydrolyzed by 2b' and 2d enzymes at rates comparable to that of ceftazidime. Nonetheless, FK-037 inhibited bacteria possessing TEM-3, -5, and -7 and SHV -5 at less than or equal 8 microgram/ml. Overall, FK-037 has lower MICs against staphylococci and P. aeruginosa than the currently available iminomethoxy aminothiazolyl cephalosporins and has activity against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae comparable to that of cefepime.
TI  - Scleral flap necrosis and infectious endophthalmitis after cataract surgery with  a scleral tunnel incision.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Long scleral tunnel dissection techniques have been developed for cataract surgery incisions. These incisions reduce postoperative astigmatism and keratorefractive instability. If fashioned correctly, the internal lip of the incision produces a tight seal to the anterior chamber, permissible of sutureless surgery. The behavior of such a wound during intraocular infection is unknown. METHODS: The authors describe two elderly patients in whom postoperative bacterial endophthalmitis was accompanied by infectious scleritis, infectious sclerokeratitis or keratitis, and rapid scleral flap necrosis. One of the patients had a painless disease process. RESULTS: Intraocular isolates of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus equinus were recovered from the two patients, respectively. Management was complicated by loss of tectonic integrity that followed scleral flap necrosis, by impaired vitreoretinal visualization associated with rapidly progressive sclerokeratitis or keratitis, and by bacterial scleritis in the base of the scleral flap. No light perception was retained in either eye. CONCLUSION: Scleral tunnel incisions create a potential abscess cavity. Although a rare occurrence, postoperative endophthalmitis in such an eye may present major surgical and therapeutic problems intrinsic to the wound design.
TI  - Prevention of bovine mastitis by a premilking teat disinfectant containing chlorous acid and chlorine dioxide.
AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a premilking teat disinfectant for the prevention of mastitis in dairy cows under natural exposure conditions. Predipping was compared with a negative control using a split udder experimental design. All teats were dipped after milking with the same teat dip. Percentage of quarters newly infected by major mastitis pathogens was 34% lower in quarters with teats predipped and postdipped than in quarters with teats postdipped only. New IMI by Streptococcus uberis and Staphylococcus aureus were significantly lower in quarters with teats predipped and postdipped than in quarters with teats postdipped only. Differences in incidence of clinical mastitis between treatment groups approached significance. Predipping and postdipping were no more effective against Gram-negative bacteria, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species, and Corynebacterium bovis than postdipping only. No chapping or irritation of teats was observed, and no adverse effects were noted using the test product as a premilking and postmilking teat disinfectant. Results of this study suggest that predipping and then postdipping with the test product was a more effective procedure against major mastitis pathogens than postdipping only.
TI  - The efficacy and safety of piperacillin/tazobactam in the therapy of bacteraemia.
AB  - The efficacy of the combination of piperacillin plus tazobactam was studied in 142 patients who had a bacteriologically proven bacteraemia. Seventy-three patients were bacteriologically evaluable and, of these, 55 had a follow-up blood culture; there was no follow-up culture in the other 18 patients, so that any cure could only be presumptive. Of the 55 patients who were fully followed up, 32 received only piperacillin and tazobactam and 23 also received an aminoglycoside. Overall, there were 67 cures and six failures out of 73 evaluable cases (three Staphylococcus aureus, two Staphylococcus epidermidis and one Streptococcus bovis). There were 11 deaths, eight of which occurred in neutropenic patients. In no case was death drug related. Side-effects were mild; the commonest adverse events noted were mild elevations of liver enzymes. Piperacillin plus tazobactam appeared efficacious and safe in the therapy of bacteraemia.
TI  - [The effect of culture media on bacteriocin production in various strains of bacteria].
AB  - Some staphylococcus and enterococcus strains were used to investigate the effect  of culture medium on bacteriocin production. Staphylococcus cohnii SC7, Staphylococcus sp. ZTJ 151, S. saprophyticus SS 877, Enterococcus faecium EF1 and E. faecalis EFG2 were isolated from the rumen wall and contents of lambs, calves and fallow deer, Enterococcus gallinarum EG10 and E. avium EA12 were isolated from the caecum of Japanese quail. The tested bacteria belong to producers with a wide antimicrobial effectiveness spectrum, they have low to medium adherence and urease activity (Tab. III). These culture media were used to test the effect of culture medium on bacteriocin production: nutrient agar no. 2 and VL agar enriched with 2% of glucose and lactose (ZAG, ZAL, VLG, VLL), agar for isolation of faecal streptococci (SA) and the base for blood agar no. 4 and no. 2 (KA4, KA2). The strains Streptococcus bovis AO 24/85 and Staphylococcus aureus Oxford 209 P were used as indicator bacteria. Tables I and II show the results of these tests. The tested strains produced the widest inhibition zones (6 mm) with both indicators on SA medium, and this indicates massive bacteriocin production. On ZAG medium, the zones of enterococci with the AO 24/85 strain were larger size than those of staphylococci, but the zones were dim. All strains with the 209P indicator produced dim zones of the 2mm size. The larger inhibition zones (2-5mm) in comparison with staphylococci were observed in enterococci on the ZAL medium with the AO24/85 strain. The production of tested strains was balanced on VLG agar with respect to the use of both indicators.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [Infective endocarditis: analysis of 300 episodes].
AB  - PURPOSE: Study of clinical features and etiologic agents, treatment and mortality of patients with infective endocarditis (IE). PATIENTS AND METHODS: 300 episodes of IE occurring in 288 patients, ages ranged between 0.2 and 78 (mean 30.76) years; 185 (62%) episodes occurred in males. RESULTS: a) etiologic agents: viridans group streptococci in 93 (31%) episodes, enterococci en 21 (7%), group D-non enterococci in 19 (6%) (13 S. bovis), other streptococci in 14 (5%), Staphylococcus aureus in 59 (20%), Staphylococcus epidermidis in 14 (5%), gram-negative bacteria in 16 (5%), gram-positive bacteria other than streptococci and staphylococci and staphylococci in 8 (3%), fungi in 4 (1%). The etiologic agents were not identified in 52 (17%) episodes; b) underlying cardiac diseases: valvular heart disease in 119 (40%) episodes, congenital heart disease in 37 (12%), prosthetic heart valves in 69 (23%), other heart diseases in 6 (2%). There was no evidence of previous heart disease in 69 (23%); c) treatment: surgical treatment was undertaken in 102 (34%) episodes. The frequency of surgical treatment in relation to the etiologic agents ranged between 1% (non-group D streptococcus) and 62% (negative blood cultures). The frequency of operation in relation to underlying heart disease ranged between 17% (other heart diseases), 19% (congenital heart disease) and 54% (prosthetic heart valve); d) mortality: 78 (26%) patients died, 56 (28%) of the 198 submitted to medical treatment and 22 (21%) of the 102 submitted also to surgical treatment. The mortality in the different groups of etiologic agents ranged between 5% (non group D streptococcus) and 62% (gram-positive bacteria other than streptococci ans staphylococci); in relation to the underlying with other heart disease, 19% in valvular heart disease patients, 21% in patients with congenital heart disease, 23% in patients without known heart disease and 43% in patients with prosthetic heart valves. CONCLUSION: The mortality associated with IE remains still high in spite of modern treatment; the mortality is different in relation to the cardiac status before the IE.
TI  - Rheumatic manifestations of infective endocarditis.
AB  - Rheumatic manifestations are common and varied in infective endocarditis. We performed a retrospective case analysis on 87 patients with 93 episodes of infective endocarditis admitted to Flinders Medical Centre over an 11 year period (1980-1990). Disabling musculoskeletal symptoms and signs were documented in 22 (25%) of the patients. Thirteen patients developed severe or moderately severe low back pain during their illness, two with radiological evidence of a septic discitis or vertebral osteomyelitis. Two patients developed polyarthralgia/arthritis, four had septic arthritis (all with acute Staphylococcus aureus endocarditis), three developed severe loin pain, two acute gout, two had severe buttock pain and sacroiliac joint tenderness and two each developed disabling jaw/facial pain, neck/scapular pain and flank pain respectively. Five patients presented initially to the orthopaedic or rheumatological unit for management of their musculoskeletal symptoms. Four of seven patients with Streptococcus bovis endocarditis demonstrated prominent low back pain supporting a previously noted association between this organism and back symptoms. Furthermore, in one patient who had three separate episodes of endocarditis involving three different organisms, florid back symptoms were only seen in the infective episode involving Streptococcus bovis.
TI  - In-vitro activity of WIN 57273 compared to the activity of other fluoroquinolones and two beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  - WIN 57273, a new fluoroquinolone, was four to 128-fold more active than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin against Gram-positive bacteria. The MIC90 for Staphylococcus aureus was 0.015 mg/l and for S. epidermidis, 0.03 mg/l. All Lancefield group A, B, C, & G streptococci, Streptococcus bovis and S. pneumoniae were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.06 mg/l compared to 0.5 mg/l for tosufloxacin and 2 mg/l for ciprofloxacin. For anaerobic bacteria WIN 57273 had an MIC90 for bacteroides of 1 mg/l, and for Clostridium spp. 0.015.mg/l. WIN 57273 was less active than ciprofloxacin against Enterobacteriaceae, with an MIC90 of 1 mg/l, including aminoglycoside and cephalosporin-resistant isolates. The MIC90 of WIN 57273 for Pseudomonas aeruginosa was 2 mg/l, compared to 0.5 mg/l for ciprofloxacin. Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Legionella spp. were inhibited by 0.06 mg/l. WIN 57273 was more active against Gram-negative bacteria at acid pH, but activity was decreased by magnesium ions and an increase in inoculum. Resistant strains were selected after passage on antibiotic-containing agar.
TI  - [Detection of causative bacteria for bovine mastitis and their susceptibility to  beta-lactam antibacterial agents].
AB  - During the period from November 1988 to May 1989, causative bacteria in a total of 172 clinical mastitis cases observed in 66 farms in 5 districts with 6 areas in Japan were examined and frequencies of their occurrences were determined. Susceptibilities (in MICs) of the isolates to 6 beta-lactam antibacterial agents were also determined. As a result, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) was identified in 94 out of 172 cases (54.7%) and were the most prevalent. Corynebacterium spp., Gram-negative bacteria and Staphylococcus aureus were found in 52 (30.2%), 49 (28.5%) and 43 (25.0%) cases, respectively. Four species of Streptococcus family (S. agalactiae, S. dysgalactiae, S. uberis and S. bovis) were identified in a total of 58 cases (33.7%). Susceptibility testing of CNS to cefoperazone (CPZ), cefazolin (CEZ), benzylpenicillin (PCG), ampicillin (ABPC), methicillin (DMPPC) and cloxacillin (MCIPC) showed that all MIC80's (inhibiting bacterial growth of 80% of all isolates) were within a range from 0.10 to 3.13 micrograms/ml and that there was no marked differences in antibacterial effects among the antibiotics used. The highest antibacterial effect on S. aureus was exhibited by MCIPC, which inhibited the growth of all isolates at 0.39 microgram/ml. The MICs of DMPPC against all isolates of S. aureus were 3.13 micrograms/ml or less and no methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) was detected. There was no difference in antibacterial activities against Streptococcus family between penicillin antibiotics (DMPPC, MCIPC, ABPC and PCG) and cephem antibiotics (CPZ and CEZ), both of which showed excellent antibacterial activities. Cephem antibiotics exhibited higher activities against Gram-negative bacteria than penicillin antibiotics. Especially CPZ, the third generation cephem, showed excellent antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter spp., as well as against other Enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of the new oral cephalosporin Bay  v 3522.
AB  - The activity of the new oral cephalosporin Bay v 3522 was compared to that of six other beta-lactam agents. Bay v 3522 inhibited methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, compared to MICs of greater than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml for the other cephalosporins tested. It was more active against Streptococcus pyogenes (MIC less than or equal to 0.06 microgram/ml) than cefuroxime, cefixime, cephalexin and cefaclor. Groups B, C and G streptococci were inhibited at less than or equal to 0.12 microgram/ml, while the MI"90 for Streptococcus bovis and viridans streptococci was 0.5 and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. The MIC90 for enterococci and Listeria monocytogenes was 8 micrograms/ml. Clostridium perfringens was inhibited by 0.12 microgram/ml, but most Bacteroides spp. were resistant. The MIC90 for beta-lactamase positive Escherichia coli (producing primarily TEM-1) was greater than 64 micrograms/ml and for beta-lactamase negative strains 16 micrograms/ml. The MIC90 for high-level beta-lactamase producing Klebsiella pneumoniae was greater than 64 micrograms/ml versus 4 micrograms/ml for other isolates. The MIC90 for Moraxella catarrhalis was 2 micrograms/ml, for Haemophilus influenzae 1 micrograms/ml, and for Neisseria gonorrhoeae 4 micrograms/ml. Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were resistant. Bay v 3522 was destroyed by TEM-1, SHV-1, TEM-3 and P99 beta-lactamases.
TI  - Efficacy of chlorhexidine as a postmilking teat disinfectant for the prevention of bovine mastitis during lactation.
AB  - A natural exposure trial was conducted for 12 mo in a herd of 150 lactating Jersey cows to determine efficacy of a .35% chlorhexidine teat dip containing a glycerine emollient for the prevention of bovine intramammary infections. Right teats of cows were dipped in the experimental teat dip after milking machine removal and left teats were not dipped. The herd was free of Streptococcus agalactiae and had a low prevalence of Staphylococcus aureus. Most new major pathogen intramammary infections resulted from Streptococcus species, primarily Streptococcus uberis and Streptococcus dysgalactiae. New infections by Streptococcus species were significantly lower in teats dipped in chlorhexidine than in undipped teats. Overall efficacy of the chlorhexidine teat dip against major mastitis pathogens was 50%. The experimental teat dip also reduced coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species infections 49.0% and Corynebacterium bovis infections 65.2%. Overall efficacy against minor mastitis pathogens was 54.0%. No irritation or chapping of teats dipped in the experimental teat dip was observed.
TI  - [Community- and hospital-acquired bacteremia: a retrospective study in a regional hospital. III. Microbiological aspects].
AB  - A retrospective study was made of all blood cultures performed over a 40-month period at the Ivrea-Castellamonte Hospital (Turin, Italy). A total of 4386 vials from 619 patients were examined. There were 619 positive vials (14.1%) from 131 patients (21.2%) corresponding to 145 bacteremia episodes, including 129 monomicrobial (89%) and 16 polymicrobial (11%). Ten patients (1.6%) had more than one episode. There were 73 polluted vials (1.7%). A total of 165 microorganism were isolated: Gram-positive (52.7%) and Gram-negative (46%) bacteria, and mycetes (1.2%), anaerobic flora (9.7%). The predominant families were: Enterobacteriaceae (29.5%), Micrococcaceae (27.3%), Pseudomonadaceae (4.8%), Bacteroidaceae (4.8%) and Streptococcus "Genus" (18.8%). The species frequencies were: Escherichia coli (20%), Staphylococcus aureus (15.8%), Enterococcus (8.5%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (7.3%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4.8%), Proteus mirabilis (4.2%), Brucella spp. (2.4%), Bacteroides fragilis, Streptococcus bovis e Propionibacterium acnes (1.8%). These findings are compared with those published in the Italian and international literature. Stress is laid on periodical review of the isolations from samples of this kind as a useful aid towards the diagnosis and treatment of hospital infections, and in their monitoring and epidemiological evaluation.
TI  - [Milk chloride level as an indicator of bovine mastitis].
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine an influence of udder infection on milk chloride level and on milk productivity of cows of black and white race. Bacteriological analysis was performed by bacterial isolation from milk collected in sterile conditions from single lobes of mammary gland. The study was aimed to detect the following bacteria: Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus uberis, Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Actinomyces pyogenes, Enterobacteriaceae rods, Corynebacterium bovis, and Micrococcus sp. Milk chloride level was determined by burette method in 1250 milk samples collected from entire udder. Milk productivity was determined on the day of bacterial isolation. Statistical analysis of the results of the study on udder infection, milk chloride level, and milk productivity of mammary gland did reveal lack of a simple correlations between those parameters and in the indirect manner indicated an influence of inappropriate maintenance conditions of tested cows on the health condition of their udder. It seems possible that alkalosis and acidosis in cows, taken into consideration in discussion section, could constitute a factor influencing the frequency of mastitis incidence.
TI  - Properties of a phosphocarrier protein (HPr) extracted from intact cells of Streptococcus sanguis.
AB  - Cells of Streptococcus sanguis strain Challis were incubated with sodium lauroylsarcosinate to extract surface proteins. A polypeptide of apparent molecular mass 16 kDa comprising about 12% of the extract was purified using anion-exchange chromatography. The polypeptide was shown to be a phosphocarrier protein (HPr) that could also be found in the soluble (cytoplasmic) fraction from cells broken by homogenization with glass beads. In vivo labelling of S. sanguis cells with 32Pi showed that the polypeptide carried a heat- and acid-stable phosphorylation and that during sucrose starvation the HPr became dephosphorylated. Antiserum raised to the S. sanguis HPr reacted on Western blots with HPrs from all oral streptococci tested, together with strains of S. pyogenes and S. salivarius, but not with HPrs from S. faecalis or S. bovis, nor with proteins from Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Actinomyces viscosus and various lactobacilli. The S. sanguis HPr had a high content of alanine (17.2%) and was similar in overall amino acid composition to the HPrs from S. mutans an S. salivarius. The N-terminal residues (to 37) of the S. sanguis HPr showed strong sequence identity (82%) with the N-terminal sequence of S. faecalis HPr. It is suggested that HPr in S. sanguis is associated closely with the cytoplasmic membrane. Non-disruptive methods of removing cell-surface proteins from streptococci effect release of HPr and possibly other cytoplasmic components.
TI  - Nisin inhibits several gram-positive, mastitis-causing pathogens.
AB  - Organisms known to cause bovine mastitis, Enterococcus faecalis ssp. liquefaciens ATCC 27959, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29740, Streptococcus agalactiae ATCC 27956, Streptococcus equinus ATCC 27960, Streptococcus dysgalactiae ATCC 27957, Streptococcus uberis ATCC 27958, and the neotype Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 14990 were examined for their susceptibility to the small peptide antibiotic, nisin. Using a disc assay, minimum inhibitory concentrations of nisin ranged from 10 to 250 micrograms/ml among the strains. Examination of the antimicrobial effect of 50 micrograms/ml nisin in milk showed nisin inhibited all gram-positive pathogens tested.
TI  - Prevention of bovine mastitis by a postmilking teat disinfectant containing chlorous acid and chlorine dioxide in a soluble polymer gel.
AB  - A natural exposure study was conducted in a herd of 150 lactating dairy cows for  18 mo to determine the effectiveness of chlorous acid and chlorine dioxide in a soluble polymer gel as a postmilking teat disinfectant for the prevention of bovine mastitis. Right quarters of cows were dipped in the experimental teat dip after milking machine removal. Left quarters were not dipped and served as within-cow negative controls. The experimental teat dip reduced Staphylococcus aureus infections 67.4%, Streptococcus dysgalactiae infections 63.8%, and Streptococcus uberis infections 27.8%. Overall efficacy of the chlorous acid and chlorine dioxide teat dip against major mastitis pathogens was 52.2%. The experimental teat dip reduced Corynebacterium bovis infections and coagulase-negative staphylococcal infections also by 45.8 and 38.7%, respectively. Overall efficacy against minor mastitis pathogens was 43.4%. Under conditions of this trial, the experimental teat dip containing chlorous acid and chlorine dioxide was effective in preventing new intramammary infections against a variety of mastitis pathogens.
TI  - Intramammary infections and risk factors for clinical mastitis in herds with low  somatic cell counts in bulk milk.
AB  - Ten herds with low somatic cell counts in bulk milk had an incidence of clinical  mastitis of only 2.2 per 100 cows whereas 10 other herds with similarly low cell counts had an incidence of 53.6 per 100 cows. The major pathogens in the herds with a high incidence were Escherichia coli, Streptococcus uberis, Staphylococcus aureus and the coagulase-negative staphylococci. The percentage of uninfected quarters in the herds with a high incidence of clinical mastitis was 21.4 per cent compared with 12.2 per cent in the herds with a low incidence of clinical mastitis. The prevalence of coagulase-negative staphylococci, Corynebacterium bovis and Micrococcus species was higher in the herds with a low incidence of clinical mastitis. There was a significant linear relationship between the percentage of uninfected quarters and the incidence of clinical mastitis in the herds with a high incidence of clinical mastitis. In herds with a low incidence of clinical mastitis significantly less teat disinfection after milking was practised. The results suggest that infections with minor pathogens tend to protect cows against mastitis, and that teat disinfection after milking may increase the percentage of uninfected quarters and lead to an increased risk of clinical mastitis in herds with low somatic cell counts in bulk milk.
TI  - Evaluation of teicoplanin for treatment of endocarditis caused by gram-positive cocci in 20 patients.
AB  - Teicoplanin, a new glycopeptide antibiotic similar to vancomycin, was evaluated for the treatment of bacterial endocarditis in an open multicenter study from May 1985 to August 1987. A total of 20 patients with positive blood culture endocarditis received teicoplanin once daily as a mean intravenous injection of 7.3 mg/kg of body weight (range, 4.8 to 10.6 mg/kg); in 17 patients, teicoplanin was combined with another antibiotic, usually an aminoglycoside. The mean duration of therapy was 28 days (range, 7 to 66 days). The diagnosis of endocarditis was confirmed by echocardiography or anatomical findings in 15 patients and established on the basis of clinical manifestations plus positive blood cultures in 5 patients. The tricuspid valve was involved in 11 of the 20 patients. Isolates from blood were 12 Staphylococcus aureus, 1 Staphylococcus hominis, 1 Micrococcus sedentarius, 1 Enterococcus faecalis, 3 Streptococcus bovis, and 2 nongroupable Streptococcus sp. At the end of therapy, bacterial eradication was achieved in 17 of 20 patients (85%), and a favorable clinical outcome had occurred in 14 of 17 evaluable patients (82%). Of these 14 patients, one relapsed 4 months after the end of treatment. Thus, teicoplanin was effective in 13 of 17 patients (76%). Mean peak levels of teicoplanin in serum were lower, 23.1 +/- 2.9 micrograms/ml, in patients who failed than in those who were cured (45.8 +/- 8.4 micrograms/ml). Side effects occurred in 7 of 20 patients (35%), and required premature discontinuation of teicoplanin in 3 patients. These side effects were fever in three patients, rash in three patients, hearing loss in two patients, and increased serum transaminase levels in two patients. This study demonstrates the efficacy of teicoplanin in the treatment of endocarditis and the need for achieving peak levels in serum close to 40 micrograms/ml. Teicoplanin should now be further evaluated in endocarditis caused by gram-positive cocci means of controlled comparative study with standard therapy.
TI  - Frequency of isolation of environmental mastitis-causing pathogens and incidence  of new intramammary infection during the nonlactating period.
AB  - Quarter samples (n = 6,328) of mammary secretions were collected from 160 cows during physiologic transitions of the udder to determine the frequency of isolation of mastitis-causing pathogens and the incidence of new intramammary infections (IMI) during the nonlactating period. None of the cows in the herd was infected with Streptococcus agalactiae, and the prevalence of Staphylococcus aureus was low. Cows were not treated with antibiotics at cessation of milking. A threefold increase in the percentage of quarters infected with major mastitis-causing pathogens developed from late lactation to early involution. Coliforms and streptococci other than Str agalactiae accounted for 94% of major pathogen infections. The number of quarters infected with coagulase-negative staphylococci increased slightly from late lactation to early involution, whereas the number of quarters infected with Corynebacterium bovis decreased markedly. Major pathogens caused 101 of 153 IMI at parturition and greater than 90% were caused by streptococci and coliforms. At parturition, 51 of 52 minor pathogen IMI were caused by coagulase-negative staphylococci. During early lactation, there was a marked decrease in quarters infected with major pathogens; however, the number of quarters with major pathogen IMI during early lactation was 2.3 times higher than the number of quarters infected before cessation of milking. The number of quarters with minor pathogen IMI during early lactation was the same as at parturition, but a marked decrease in quarters infected with coagulase-negative staphylococci and a marked increase in C bovis IMI developed from parturition to early lactation.
TI  - In-vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of LY163892.
AB  - LY163892 is a new orally absorbed carbacephem. It inhibited Streptococcus pyogenes and Str. pneumoniae at less than or equal to 1 mg/l, but was less active against group B streptococci and groups C, F, G and bovis streptococci with MICs of 1 to 2 mg/l for most but as high as 8 mg/l for some isolates. MIC90 of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus was 8 mg/l, but greater than 128 mg/l for methicillin-resistant staphylococci. LY163892 had activity similar to cefaclor and cephalexin with MIC90 values of 16 mg/l for Escherichia coli, 8 mg/l for Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Yersinia enterocolitica, but was more active against Haemophilus influenzae, and Branhamella catarrhalis. It had no activity against Enterobacter, Providencia, Serratia, and Pseudomonas and Bacteroides spp. LY163892 was more rapidly lytic than cephalexin. It was hydrolyzed by a number of plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases. For TEM-1, the Km = 354.7 microM, Vmax = 2.5 microMoles/min/mg of protein, P99 Km = 24.3 microM, Vmax = 28.9 microM/min/micrograms of protein, Staph. aureus PC Km = 47.4 microM, Vmax = 2.7 microMoles/min/mg of protein. Overall it had beta-lactamase stability similar to cefaclor, less than cephalexin, and markedly less than cefuroxime.
TI  - Phagocytic and nitroblue tetrazolium reductive properties of bovine neutrophils for mammary pathogens.
AB  - A comparative evaluation of in vitro phagocytic and metabolic activities of freshly isolated bovine blood neutrophils from 26 cows was performed. Degrees of phagocytosis and nitroblue tetrazolium reduction by neutrophils were measured using zymosan, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Mycoplasma bovis, Salmonella sp., and Brucella abortus opsonized with fresh bovine serum. Percent phagocytosis and nitroblue tetrazolium reduction by the neutrophils were determined by microscopic evaluation of stained coverslip smears. Individual variation among cows was found in parameters measured, but age was not a contributing factor. Phagocytosis was high (73 to 81%) for E. coli, Salmonella sp., Strep. agalactiae, and zymosan; intermediate (64%) for Staph. aureus; and low (24 to 40%) for M. bovis and B. abortus. Nitroblue tetrazolium reduction was distinctly lower than zymosan (74%) for all microorganisms. Similar percentages (32 to 41%) of nitroblue tetrazolium reduction were observed for E. coli, Staph. aureus, Strep. agalactiae, and M. bovis; intermediate (28%) was obtained for Salmonella sp. and lowest (11%) for B. abortus.
TI  - Effect of naturally occurring intramammary infections by minor pathogens on new infections by major pathogens in cattle.
AB  - New mammary infections were recorded in 3 dairy herds during a lactation period by bacteriologic examination of milk samples at 3-week intervals. Influences of the infection status of quarters at the time of new infection and of microorganisms responsible for bacterial invasion were analyzed. The new infection rate in uninfected quarters was about 3 times the rate in quarters already harboring bacterial considered minor pathogens (coagulase-negative staphylococci and Corynebacterium bovis) or major pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus, streptococci). The frequency of new infections with major pathogens was almost halved by preexisting infections with minor pathogens (P = 0.05), mainly because of coagulase-negative staphylococci (P = 0.05) and, to a lesser extent, C bovis (P = 0.19). New infections by minor pathogens also were less frequent in quarters harboring a major pathogen (P less than 0.05), indicating that the competition or antagonism between mammary infections was a general phenomenon.
TI  - Effects of source and washing of erythrocytes on growth of bacterial pathogens from the bovine mammary gland.
AB  - Effects of source and washing of RBC on quantitative growth and hemolytic zone sizes of common bacterial pathogens of the bovine mammary gland were evaluated. Blood samples used to prepare the blood agar media were obtained from 10 adult dairy cows, 10 dairy calves, and 10 sheep. Hemolytic zone sizes produced by Staphylococcus aureus were significantly (P less than 0.01) larger on blood agar prepared with washed RBC than on blood agar prepared with nonwashed RBC, regardless of RBC source. With the exception of Corynebacterium bovis, growth of all bacteria was equivalent or significantly higher on medium prepared with washed RBC, compared with that on medium prepared with nonwashed RBC, regardless of RBC source. Significantly higher numbers of C bovis (P less than 0.01) and Streptococcus agalactiae (P less than 0.01) were isolated on medium prepared with washed cow RBC. Significantly higher numbers of Str uberis (P less than 0.01) and S aureus (P less than 0.05) were isolated on medium prepared with washed sheep RBC and washed calf RBC, respectively. Growth of Escherichia coli was not affected by the RBC source. Seemingly, RBC used in the preparation of medium should be washed. The source of RBC, as well as inter-animal variation, also should be considered in the quality control of medium.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of teicoplanin in an in-vitro two-compartment kinetic model.
AB  - The bactericidal activity of teicoplanin was studied in a model system in which antibiotic concentration is continuously varied. A two-compartment open model was used to reproduce, in vitro serum pharmacokinetics of teicoplanin in humans during 24 h after iv administration. Staphylococcal and streptococcal strains of various species were tested. Teicoplanin showed rapid killing of Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staph. hominis. All strains of Staph. epidermidis were rapidly killed in spite of the high MIC values (4-16 mg/l). The killing effect against Staph. haemolyticus was less rapid and marked than against Staph. epidermidis, with strain to strain variation. A 99.9% kill was achieved for most strains within 22 h, but with other isolates regrowth occurred which was due to the presence of highly resistant cells in the original population. Other staphylococci (Staph. aureus, Staph. saprophyticus) and Streptococcus pyogenes, Str. bovis and Str. salivarius were reduced by 99.9% within 22 h. Bactericidal activity against other streptococci (Str. mutans, Str. agalactiae, Str. faecalis, Str. faecium) was less marked; against Str. sanguis teicoplanin was bacteriostatic.
TI  - Growth responses of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae to Corynebacterium bovis metabolites.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae growth responses to metabolites of Corynebacterium bovis cultured in media containing polyoxyethylenesorbitan monolaurate, monooleate, or trioleate and milk were determined. Filter sterilized metabolites of 48-h C. bovis cultures in synthetic media were added to cultures of Staph. aureus and Strep. agalactiae. Staphylococcus aureus and Strep. agalactiae were inoculated into 12-h C. bovis milk cultures. Growth responses of Staph. aureus and Strep. agalactiae were not affected by C. bovis metabolites of synthetic media. Staphylococcus aureus growth was inhibited during logarithmic and stationary phases in milk containing mixed cultures of C. bovis compared with growth in pure Staph. aureus cultures. Streptococcus agalactiae growth curves were similar in pure and C. bovis mixed cultures. Fatty acid compositions were not different in sterile milk and milk containing bacterial cultures. Growth responses of Staph. aureus and Strep. agalactiae were not related to concentration of C. bovis metabolites or fatty acid content of media in which C. bovis were cultured.
TI  - Growth inhibition of mastitis pathogens by long-chain fatty acids.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus hyicus, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Corynebacterium bovis were tested for sensitivity to long-chain fatty acids predominant in teat canal keratin. Antibacterial activity of free fatty acids on each bacterial species was measured after 12 and 24 h in chemically defined media. Polyene C18:2 and C18:3 acids were bactericidal to each species at less than or equal to 10(5) ng/ml-1. The most bacteriostatic saturated fatty acids were C12 and C14. Streptococcus agalactiae growth was inhibited more by fatty acids after 24 h than after 12 h. No incubation time effect on growth responses of other species was determined. Polyoxyethylenesorbitan monooleate had a neutralizing effect on the bactericidal activity of polyene acids on C. bovis. Corynebacterium bovis were unable to grow in synthetic media containing individual free fatty acids as the sole source of preformed fatty acids. A relationship between bacterial species commonly isolated from bovine teat canals with resistance to fatty acids predominant in keratin was not evident.
TI  - In vitro activity of LY146032 (daptomycin) against selected aerobic bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activity of the new lipopeptide antibiotic LY146032 was generally four-fold greater (MIC 90 less than or equal to 0.5 microgram/ml) than that of vancomycin against methicillin-susceptible or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative species of Staphylococcus. Enterococci, Streptococcus bovis, group B and viridans streptococci, and Corynebacterium group J-K isolates were inhibited by less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml of LY146032, which represented activity equivalent to or greater than that of vancomycin. Unlike vancomycin, LY146032 was bactericidal for Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium and Listeria monocytogenes. Due to its bactericidal properties LY146032 appeared to represent an improvement over vancomycin and teicoplanin.
TI  - Secretion composition during bovine mammary involution and the relationship with  mastitis.
AB  - 1. Bacteriological analysis revealed that 30% of quarters contained coagulase-negative staphylococci, Staphylococcus aureus, Corynebacterium bovis, or streptococci. 2. As involution progressed, somatic cell counts, percent protein, pH, and concentrations of serum albumin, lactoferrin, and immunoglobulin G increased while percent fat, concentrations of citrate, and the citrate to lactoferrin molar ratio decreased. 3. Mammary secretion from infected quarters had significantly higher numbers of somatic cells, percent polymorphonuclear leukocytes, and pH, but lower percentage lymphocytes, fat, and lactoferrin concentrations compared to uninfected quarters. 4. Results suggest intramammary infection altered normal secretion composition during bovine involution and lactogenesis. 5. Lower levels of antibacterial components in bovine mammary secretion during the peripartum period may have reduced the natural defense potential of the gland.
TI  - Growth of gram-positive mastogenic bacteria in normal, simulated bulk tank, and mastitic milk held at simulated fluctuating temperatures of farm bulk tank.
AB  - Growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus bovis, and Streptococcus uberis was studied in normal milk, simulated bulk tank milk, and aseptic mastitic milk held at simulated fluctuating temperatures of farm bulk tank for 48 h. With the exception of S. bovis, growth rates of the other five bacteria were similar in both normal and simulated bulk tank milk. Mastitic milk inhibited growth of all bacteria studied. A 24-h adjustment period occurred before most of the bacteria started growing. The mastitis level in a dairy herd may be monitored by cultures of bulk tank milk samples and by calculations as discussed in this study.
TI  - Evaluation of .5% and 1% iodophor teat dips on commercial dairies.
AB  - Two postmilking teat dips containing .5 and 1% iodine were evaluated for approximately 8 mo under conditions of natural exposure to mastitis pathogens on four commercial dairy farms. In the two herds using .5% iodophor, incidence of intramammary infection with Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae was reduced 68.3 and 46.2%, respectively. When numbers of new infections with both pathogens were combined, efficacy for the .5% iodophor was 62.3%. In the two herds using 1% iodophor, incidence of intramammary infection with Staph. aureus and Strep. agalactiae was reduced 52.4 and 70.7%, respectively. When numbers of new infections with both pathogens were combined, efficacy for the 1% iodophor was 64.3%. Efficacy of teat dips was variable against coagulase-negative staphylococci and Corynebacterium bovis.
TI  - In vitro activity of flurithromycin, a novel macrolide antibiotic.
AB  - Flurithromycin is an (8,S)-8-fluoroerythromycin isolated from the fermentation broth of Streptomyces erythraeus ATCC 31772, a blocked mutant of a strain producer of erythromycin. Its in vitro antibacterial activity has been determined on recent clinical isolates of respiratory pathogens. The range of MIC for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus beta-haemolyticus group A is from 0.0015 to 0.006 microgram/ml, for Haemophilus influenzae from 0.012 to 0.4 microgram/ml, for Staphylococcus aureus from 0.1 to 3.1 micrograms/ml. Its action is bacteriostatic and increases at alkaline pH. Among anaerobes Clostridium perfringens, Bacteroides fragilis, other species of Bacteroides and Peptostreptococcus are particularly susceptible. Flurithromycin also showed some activity on Mycobacterium bovis, M. scrofulaceum and M. phley. The determination of killing curves indicated that in most cases a killing effect was obtained at 4 X MIC. A combination of flurithromycin with ampicillin or doxycycline sometimes was synergic, but more often additive and never antagonistic. The possible interference of flurithromycin on some parameters of the natural system of defense was determined. At concentrations equal to therapeutic levels in blood and tissues, flurithromycin did not influence chemotaxis, phagocytosis, metabolic activation and the killing activity of neutrophils.
TI  - Comparison of the effect of antibiotic dry cow teat canal and intramammary dry cow therapy of dairy cows on the prevalence of teat canal and intramammary infections at calving.
AB  - The specific therapy of bacterial colonization of the teat canals of dried-off dairy cows by means of small amounts (33 mg/0.25 ml and 14 mg/0.1 ml) of a procain benzyl penicillin-dihydrostreptomycin sulphate combination has been investigated. Of 36 teat canals treated with 0.25 ml antibiotic preparation each, 24 (66.6%) were infected at the beginning of the dry period, whereas at its termination only 7 (19.4%) showed bacteriologically positive swab cultures. By treating a further 43 quarters with 0.1 ml quantities of an antibiotic preparation each, the prevalence of infection dropped from 32.5% to 14%. Untreated controls (20 quarters) showed no significant change. Cultures of teat canal swabs were generally twice as sensitive for indicating the presence of bacteria compared to foremilk sample cultures. Staphylococcus aureus was the most commonly isolated organism, followed by Streptococcus agalactiae, Corynebacterium bovis and Staphylococcus epidermidis.
TI  - Clinical and echocardiographic observations in pulmonary valve endocarditis.
AB  - Clinical and echocardiographic data from 12 patients with pulmonary valve endocarditis are described. Seven patients had isolated pulmonary endocarditis and in 5 patients other valves were infected (aortic, tricuspid, mitral or all 3). Two patients were heroin addicts and 4 had underlying heart disease (congenital heart disease in 3 and aortic regurgitation in 1 patient). The organisms involved were alpha streptococci in 3 patients (all with underlying heart disease), Staphylococcus aureus in 4, Streptococcus D bovis in 1 patient and Candida guillermondii in 1. M-mode and 2-dimensional echocardiography was performed in 10 patients and revealed vegetations in 8. Pulsed Doppler echocardiography was performed in 6 patients and revealed pulmonary regurgitation in all 6. Seven patients had pulmonary emboli. Four patients underwent surgery. Four patients died, including 1 after cardiac surgery. Five patients, including the patient infected with Candida guillermondii, recovered with antibiotic treatment.
TI  - Effects of Corynebacterium bovis infection on susceptibility to major mastitis pathogens.
AB  - Experimental challenge procedures were used to study infectivity and virulence of Corynebacterium bovis. Challenge procedures using Staphylococcus aureus (Newbould 305) and Streptococcus agalactiae (McDonald 44) were used to study effects of Corynebacterium bovis infections on superinfection with major pathogens. Rate of infection under experimental challenge conditions was significantly greater with Corynebacterium bovis than previously observed for Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus agalactiae. Principal location of Corynebacterium bovis colonization appeared to the teat canal region, although the organism was isolated from 75% of the teat cisterns by puncture technique. Quarters with Corynebacterium bovis infections were more resistant to infection by Staphylococcus aureus than bacteriologically negative quarters. Quarters infected with Corynebacterium bacterium bovis were approximately 8.5-fold more susceptible to Streptococcus agalactiae infection than negative quarters. Somatic cell counts were doubled in negative quarters that developed Corynebacterium bovis infections; the geometric mean was 2.4 X 10(5).
TI  - Effect of automatic backflushing on number of new intramammary infections, bacteria on teatcup liners, and milk iodine.
AB  - Effect of an automatic iodine (15 ppm) backflushing system on incidence of new intramammary infections, teatcup liner bacterial populations, and milk iodine was tested in a herd free of Streptococcus agalactiae and with a low prevalence of Staphylococcus aureus. In an 11-mo trial, backflushing was applied to teatcups that milked the right half of the udder; the left half served as control. Clawpieces were divided into left and right halves with each having a milk outlet. Postmilking teat dipping was discontinued. All lactating cows in the University herd were used, averaging 154 with normal attrition and additions of new individuals as they calved. Backflushing reduced numbers of staphylococci recovered from liners by 98.5% and Gram-negative bacteria by 99.5% as compared with unflushed liners. Backflushing significantly reduced new infections caused by Corynebacterium bovis. However, there was no effect on incidence of new infections by staphylococci, streptococci, or coliforms. Iodine concentrations averaged 243 micrograms per liter in milk from control quarters and 486 micrograms from backflushed udder halves. Interior surface cracking was more severe in backflushed teatcup liners than in control liners. These results do not justify the use of backflushing in a herd with low prevalence of contagious pathogens.
TI  - Mode of action and in-vitro activity of vancomycin.
AB  - Vancomycin is a unique glycopeptide structurally unrelated to any currently available antibiotic. It also has a unique mode of action inhibiting the second stage of cell wall synthesis of susceptible bacteria. There is also evidence that vancomycin alters the permeability of the cell membrane and selectively inhibits ribonucleic acid synthesis. Induction of bacterial L-phase variants from susceptible organisms with vancomycin is extremely difficult, and such variants are unstable. Stable L-phase variants induced by other agents are susceptible to vancomycin. Vancomycin is active against a large number of species of Gram-positive bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant strains), Staph. epidermidis (including multiple-resistant strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (including multiple-resistant strains), Str. pyogenes, Str. agalactiae, Str. bovis, Str. mutans, viridans streptococci, enterococci, Clostridium species, diphtheroids, Listeria monocytogenes, Actinomyces species and Lactobacillus species. There has been no increase in resistance to vancomycin during the past three decades. Enhancement of antimicrobial activity has been demonstrated with the combination of vancomycin and an aminoglycoside against Staph. aureus, Str. bovis, enterococci and viridans streptococci. The combination of vancomycin and rifampicin are antagonistic to most strains of Staph. aureus, though indifference and occasionally synergism have been shown, but is synergistic against strains of Staph. epidermidis. It shows indifference against enterococci. Vancomycin and fusidic acid are indifferent against Staph. aureus.
TI  - The susceptibility of bovine udder quarters colonized with Corynebacterium bovis  to experimental infection with Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus agalactiae.
AB  - Twenty bovine udder quarters colonized with Corynebacterium bovis SR6 and 20 uncolonized quarters were challenged by inoculation of Staphylococcus aureus Newbould 305 (ATCC 29740) into the teat cistern. The percentage of infection in quarters colonized with C. bovis (50%) was significantly lower than that in controls (100%). By similar challenge no significant difference was observed between the percentage of infection with Streptococcus agalactiae ATCC 27956 in 33 quarters colonized with C. bovis (70%) compared to 33 controls (87.9%). A total of 37 quarters colonized with C. bovis and 37 control quarters were challenged with Staph. aureus Newbould 305 (ATCC 29740) and Maxi (ATCC 27543) and Strep. agalactiae (ATCC 27956) by exposure of the teat orifice. The percentage of teat ducts colonized with C. bovis which became infected with either pathogen was not different from that for controls.
TI  - Relationship between the level of N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAGase) in bovine milk and the presence of mastitis pathogens.
AB  - Changes in the level of the tissue damage marker enzyme, N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAGase) in quarter fore milks were found to be related to the presence and types of pathogenic bacteria present and to somatic cell counts (SCC). Minor pathogens (coagulase-negative staphylococci, Corynebacterium bovis) elicited a mild SCC increase (from a mean of 243 X 10(3)/ml in healthy quarters to 504 X 10(3)/ml in infected quarters) with marginal tissue damage (mean NAGase activity increased from 21 in healthy quarters to 28 in infected quarters). Major pathogens (i.e. Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Str. dysgalactiae and Str. uberis) caused more severe tissue damage (mean NAGase of 48) and SCC increases (mean, 2803 X 10(3)/ml). The NAGase test could also be used effectively on composite milk samples where regular monthly NAGase analysis was able to identify correctly 74% of animals having infected quarters. The possibility of combining SCC and NAGase data in order to give a more definite diagnosis of bovine mastitis is discussed.
TI  - Humoral reactions in human endocarditis due to Streptococcus bovis: evidence for  a common S bovis antigen.
AB  - Humoral reactions to native culture filtrates of Streptococcus bovis were studied in patients with endocarditis by means of two-dimensional crossed immunoelectrophoresis. Serum from patients with S bovis endocarditis produced eight different precipitin arcs. Lex antigen cross-reacted with sera from patients with viridans streptococcal endocarditis, and TA antigen cross-reacted with ribitol teichoic acid-positive sera from patients with Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia. One antigen, common (c), was immunoreactive with all 10 sera from S bovis-infected patients. Antibody to this antigen was not found in sera from 77 patients with gram-positive bacteremia or in 29 other control sera. Common (c) antigen was found in all strains of S bovis isolated from patients. Rabbits immunized with formalinized S bovis cells of human origin also produced antibody to common (c) antigen. Common (c) may be an important antigen of S bovis and may in fact define this organism serologically.
TI  - Germicidal teat dip in a herd with low prevalence of Streptococcus agalactiae and Staphylococcus aureus mastitis.
AB  - Effectiveness of an iodophor teat dip in reducing new intramammary infection and  clinical mastitis was tested in a herd free of Streptococcus agalactiae and with a low prevalence of Staphylococcus aureus infections. In this 6-mo study with an average of 152 lactating cows on trial on sampling dates, right rear and left front teats were dipped after each milking while right front and left rear teats were undipped controls. Teat dipping significantly reduced new infections by Staphylococcus aureus, streptococci (other than Streptococcus agalactiae), coagulase-negative staphylococci, and Corynebacterium bovis and reduced clinical cases caused by infections established during the trial. However, the dip did not reduce new infections or clinical mastitis caused by coliform bacteria. Therefore, use of a germicidal dip is recommended for herds with a low prevalence of Streptococcus agalactiae and Staphylococcus aureus, but the practice should not be expected to control coliform mastitis.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of norfloxacin against urinary tract pathogens.
AB  - The in vitro activity of norfloxacin (MK366) against 477 aerobic gram-negative and gram-positive clinical isolates was compared to that of nalidixic acid, nitrofurantoin, ampicillin, cephalexin, trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, and the combination trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Norfloxacin was more active than the other agents against all gram-negative organisms tested. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were less than or equal to 0.125-32 mg/l with 90% inhibited (MIC90) by 4 mg/l; MICs of the Enterobacteriaceae including Serratia marcescens were less than or equal to 0.125-8 mg/l with an MIC90 of less than or equal to 4 mg/l. There was also excellent activity against the gram-positive cocci including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus and the enterococci, with MICs less than or equal to 0.125-4 mg/l and an MIC90 less than or equal to 4 mg/l. Only 8 of 477 organisms were norfloxacin-resistant (MIC greater than or equal to 16 mg/l): 3 of 100 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 3 of 10 Pseudomonas maltophilia and 2 of 15 Streptococcus bovis strains. In contrast, 97% of the gram-positive cocci and 49% of the gram-negative bacilli were nalidixic acid-resistant (MIC greater than or equal to 32 mg/l). Norfloxacin shows excellent activity against a wide range of bacteria and merits further study as a urinary antibacterial agent.
TI  - Within herd comparison of teat dipping and dry cow therapy with only selective dry cow therapy in six herds.
AB  - A within herd comparison of teat dipping and dry cow therapy (full treatment) with only selective dry cow therapy (partial treatment) was carried out in six commercial dairy herds for a two year period. In four herds, the incidence of clinical mastitis was 2 to 12 per cent higher in the partial treatment group. In another herd, in which the pattern of clinical mastitis isolates was unusual in that minor pathogens were isolated from 30 per cent of mastitis cases, the incidence was 43 per cent higher in the partial treatment group. In the remaining herd the incidence was 10 percent higher in the full treatment group. Streptococcus uberis mastitis was more common in the partial treatment groups of five herds; coliform mastitis was more common in the full treatment groups of two herds and similar in both groups in the other herds. High rates of coliform mastitis were associated with poor herd environmental conditions but this was not true for Strep uberis mastitis. Rates of staphylococcus aureus and Strep dysgalactiae mastitis were low in all herds. The level of major pathogen infection in cows completing the trial in all herds increased in the partial treatment group from 5 per cent of quarters at the start to 12 per cent at the finish of the trial. In the full treatment group, however, there was only a small increase in this level. In contrast, levels of Corynebacterium bovis infection increased by 17 per cent in both treatment groups. Continued use of teat dipping and dry cow therapy was associated with a higher rate of coliform mastitis in two of the three herds where there were poor standards of hygiene and husbandry.
TI  - Laboratory diagnosis of bacteremia by headspace gas-liquid chromatography.
AB  - The growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. fecalis, S. sanguis, S. bovis, S. mitior, S. agalactiae, Escherichia coli, A-D group, Klebsiella aerogenes, K. oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens, Pasteurella multocida or Listeria monocytogenes in 83 blood cultures was detected in a 1.5-min analysis using head-space gas-liquid chromatography. Two hundred and twenty-four blood cultures in which there was no growth of micro-organisms were negative in the analysis. The analysis detected the growth of S. epidermidis in only 6 of 26 blood cultures and failed to detect the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans and species of Micrococcus, Corynebacterium or Bacillus in 18 blood cultures.
TI  - Cephapirin therapy in infective endocarditis.
AB  - Ten patients, eight of them heroin addicts, with infective endocarditis were treated with cephapirin. Causative organisms included Staphylococcus aureus in six patients and viridans streptococci, S bovis, and S pneumoniae in one patient each. In one of the patients with endocarditis, both S aureus and an organism of the beta-Streptococcus group were simultaneously isolated. All patients except two, both with monomicrobial S aureus endocarditis, were cured. All isolates were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms/ml of cephapirin. Peak serum bactericidal activity greater than or equal to 32 times the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the causative organism was achieved in all cases after giving 2 gm IV every four hours. After using large inoculums of staphylococci for in vitro tests, we found that twofold to eightfold increases in MIC occurred. Cephapirin was well tolerated intravenously and high levels in serum were achieved without toxicity or accumulation of the drug.
TI  - Detection and partial characterization of antibacterial factor(s) in alveolar lining material of rats.
AB  - Intracellular killing of Staphylococcus aureus by alveolar macrophages is known to be enhanced by exposure to alveolar lining material. Because this material may have a role in pulmonary host defenses, we have studied its effect on pneumococci and other nonstaphylococcal organisms. Alveolar lining material from rats caused rapid killing and lysis of pneumococci. The antipneumococcal activity was localized to the surfactant-containing fraction of the fluid and was not affected by trypsin. Phospholipid extracts of the surfactant fraction or purified lamellar bodies killed pneumococci. Lysis of pneumococci by the surfactant fraction appeared to be mediated by a detergent-like activation of pneumococcal autolysin, in that bacteriolysis was prevented by substitution of ethanolamine for choline in pneumococcal cell walls, and a pneumococcal transformant that lacked autolysin was not lysed. The surfactant fraction readily killed pneumococci containing ethanolamine or the autolysin-defective transformant, and studies with tritiated methyl-D-glucose loading and release showed that killing was associated with increased bacterial cell membrane permeability. Bactericidal activity (without lysis) was observed with several nonpneumococcal gram-positive bacteria, including Streptococcus viridans, unspeciated respiratory streptococci, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus bovis, and Bacillus species. Purified diacylphospholipids had no antibacterial activity, however, a lysophospholipid, palmitoyl lysophosphatidylcholine, had many properties resembling the surfactant-containing fraction of lavage, including autolysin-mediated pneumococcal lysis, altered cell membrane permeability, and antibacterial activity against several gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Dynamics of nonclinical bovine intramammary infections with major and minor pathogens.
AB  - Udder infections were recorded in 3 herds throughout a lactation period with bacteriologic examination being done at 3-week intervals. New infection rates and levels of infection at calving differed significantly (P less than 0.001) between herds, but persistence of infection did not. Of the 324 infections, 80.5% lasted up to drying off. Of quarters infected with major pathogens, 16.8% eliminated their infection (63% became reinfected); 20.8% of quarters infected with minor pathogens eliminated their infection (43% became reinfected). Significant differences in persistence of infections, quarter clearing rate (defined as the rate at which infected quarters become and remain noninfected) and ability to give way to and to take place of a preexistent infection, did not occur between Corynebacterium bovis and major pathogens. Though 66% of coagulase-negative staphylococci infections persisted up to drying off, they disappeared more frequently (P less than 0.01).
TI  - The antibacterial action of vancomycin.
AB  - Vancomycin inhibits the second stage of cell wall synthesis in susceptible bacteria. Furthermore, there is evidence that vancomycin also alters the permeability of the cell membrane and selectively inhibits ribonucleic acid synthesis. Stable L-phase variants are susceptible to vancomycin, but induction of bacterial L-phase variants with vancomycin is very difficult. Vancomycin is active against a large number of species of gram-positive cocci and bacilli, such as Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant strains), Staphylococcus epidermidis (including multiply resistant strains). Streptococcus pneumoniae (including multiply resistant strains), Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus bovis, viridans group Streptococcus, enterococcus, Clostridium species, diphtheroids, Listeria monocytogenes, Actinomyces species, and Lactobacillus species. Antimicrobial activity can be enhanced with the combination of vancomycin and an aminoglycoside against S. aureus, S. bovis, enterococcus, and viridans Streptococcus. The combination of vancomycin and rifampin also has enhanced activity against S. aureus.
TI  - Mannitol agar for microbiologic diagnosis of bovine mastitis.
AB  - A medium containing mannitol (mannitol agar) was developed and evaluated as a tool for the microbiologic diagnosis of bovine mastitis. Mannitol agar supported growth of all important bacterial mastitis pathogens (staphylococci, streptococci, coliforms, and pseudomonads) except Corynebacterium pyogenes. Color change around colonies in the agar permitted the differentiation of pathogenic from nonpathogenic staphylococci. Most Staphylococcus aureus strains and some Staphylococcus epidermidis strains produced yellow zones. These yellow zone-producing strains (mannitol fermenters) of staphylococci were obtained from quarters with significantly elevated (P less than 0.05) somatic cell counts (SCC) in the milk, as compared with uninfected quarters and, therefore, would be considered pathogens. Mannitol-negative strains of S epidermidis (those with red zones) were obtained from quarters with SCC similar to those of uninfected quarters. The streptococci could be divided into 2 groups on the basis of color change around the colonies: Streptococcus agalactiae, Str dysgalactiae, and group G streptococci produced red zones; Str uberis, Str bovis, and enterococci produced yellow zones. Pathogenic streptococci (Str agalactiae, Str dysgalactiae, Str uberis, and group G streptococci) were obtained from quarters with SCC significantly higher (P less than 0.01) than those of uninfected quarters. Streptococcus bovis and enterococci were obtained from quarters with SCC similar to those of uninfected quarters and were considered nonpathogenic. Pathogenic streptococci were found in much higher concentration than nonpathogenic streptococci and could be differentiated on that basis.
TI  - [Staphylococcus aureus infection in chickens in industrialized poultry units. 3.  Experimental infection of chickens and comparison of pathogenicity of Staphylococcus aureus of different origin].
AB  - Day-old chicks were subcutaneously infected with Staphylococcus aureus strains of site variety gallinae and crystalviolet Type A. The lysis patterns involved were with phages 84 as well as with phages 53, 77, and 84 of the international base scheme for human staphylococci. In fowl with synovitis and arthritis, osteomyelitis, dermatitis, and septicaemia, 52 of 57 tested strains (91.2 per cent) produced on the site of injection pathognomic oedematous-haemorrhagic and necrotising changes of the skin and hypodermis (haemorrhagic dermatitis) in a way which is characteristic also of natural diseases. However, no specific skin changes could be produced by subcutaneous infection of nine strains of site variety hominis or undefinable category with differentiated biochemical properties and lysis patterns. They had been isolated from cases of compound infection, salpingitis and wound infections as well as from one case of arthritis. Fifty-seven strains, obtained from mammals, were tested subcutaneously, on day-old chicks, among them 21 strains of site varieties of bovis, canis, ovis, and hominis. However, only four of those strains, isolated from miscarried pig foetuses and cattle with mastitis, caused, oedematisation and exudation (7.02 per cent), but no haemorrhagia and only minor lysis and necrosis of skin. The minimum dose required to induce haemolytic dermatitis was 11 x 10(3) pathogens, and the lowest lethal dose of six tested strains was between 11 x 10(5) and 26 x 10(7) pathogens. The lowest dose of mammalian strains with lethality to day-old chicks was [10 bis]10(4) times as high as the lowest dose of fowl strains. Subcutaneous infection of day-old chicks has worked well as a high-speed test by which to differentiate between fowl-pathogenic Staphylococcus aureus strains, on the one hand, and mammalian strains, on the other. The need for delimitation of such strains has been confirmed by the above experimental infections. Against the background of the above results, guidelines are proposed for the control of Staphylococcus aureus infection of fowl.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of LY 127935 (6059-S), seven cephalosporins, three  aminoglycosides, carbenicillin, and ticarcillin.
AB  - LY 127935 (6059-S), a new semi-synthetic beta-lactam antibiotic was tested simultaneously with 6 cephalosporins, 3 aminoglycosides, carbenicillin and ticarcillin against 398 clinical isolates of Gram-negative bacilli and Gram-positive cocci. Many of the organisms were selected for study because of known resistance to one or more of the clinically available antibiotics tested. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Serratia and Providencia were susceptible to LY 127935. Some resistant strains of Enterobacter, Proteus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter were also resistant to LY 127935, but many of the strains resistant to other antibiotics were susceptible to LY 127935. The activity of LY 127935 against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus viridans and Streptococcus bovis was similar to that of cephalexin and cephradine. LY 127935 was not active against methicillin-resistant S. aureus nor enterococcus.
TI  - Effect of serum on gram-positive cocci grown in the presence of penicillin.
AB  - Strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, Streptococcus bovis, and a strain of Streptococcus that produces filaments were grown on agar containing penicillin at concentrations of one-half to 1/10th the minimal inhibitory concentration. These penicillin-exposed organisms as well as untreated control organisms were incubated with human serum of plasma. Both serum and plasma produced a remarkable bactericidal effect on the filament-forming Streptococcus grown in the presence of penicillin, whereas the untreated control was only slightly affected. This response resembled that of gram-negative bacilli rather than that of gram-positive cocci. The growth of staphylococci exposed to penicillin was slightly inhibited in the presence of serum, whereas the growth of untreated staphylococci was stimulated. The streptococci, regardless of whether they were treated with penicillin or whether they were untreated, showed no change in growth pattern in the presence of serum.
TI  - Treatment of bacterial endocarditis with vancomycin.
AB  - Five patients with bacterial endocarditis who were allergic to penicillin were treated successfully with vancomycin. The causative microorganisms were Streptococcus bovis, S faecalis, S agalactiae, S intermedius, and Staphylococcus aureus. Except for the strain of S faecalis, vancomycin was bactericidal against these organisms at easily achievable serum concentrations. To insure a bactericidal serum titer of 1:8 or greater, streptomycin was added in the therapy of the case caused by S faecalis. There was no toxicity from vancomycin therapy in our patients except for mild phlebitis at the infusion site. Vancomycin appears to be an effective alternative to penicillin in individuals with endocarditis due to susceptible organisms. Vancomycin in combination with an aminoglycoside may be appropriate therapy for enterococcal endocarditis.
TI  - Bacteria induce lymphokine synthesis polyclonally in human B lymphocytes.
AB  - We have studied the ability of various bacteria to stimulate human lymphocytes to produce leukocyte migration inhibitory factor (LIF). Mononuclear cells from adult and cord blood as well as purified T and B lymphocytes were stimulated with killed bacteria. The culture supernatants were tested for the presence of LIF by the agarose migration method. All nine bacterial strains tested activated unseparated mononuclear cells and B lymphocytes but not T cells to produce LIF. LIF was also present in cord blood cell cultures suggesting that the stimulation of lymphocytes was polyclonal rather than antigenic. Therefore, we propose that one of the physiologic functions of B lymphocyte lymphokines might be to form part of the nonspecific defense mechanisms against microbial invasion.
TI  - Tetrahydrofolate-dependent biosynthesis of ribothymidine in transfer ribonucleic  acids of Gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - Trimethoprim, an inhibitor that prevents tetrahydrofolate-dependent transmethylation reactions inbacteria, was used in a comparative study to discriminate between two possible biosynthetic pathways, either the S-adenosylmethionine or the tetrahydrofolate-dependent formation of ribothymidine (rT) in transfer ribonucleic acids (tRNA's) of several strains of gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms. rT-deficient tRNA's accumulate in trimethoprim-treated gram-positive Streptococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Corynebacterium bovis, Arthrobacter albidus, and all examined Bacillaceae, except Bacillus stearothermophilus. The rT-deficient rT-deficient tRNA's accept the methyl moiety from S-adenosylmethionine in vitro, with extracts from Escherichia coli (wild type) as a source of methylating enzymes; 90% of the incorporated methyl groups are present in rT. Trimethoprim does not inhibit the biosynthesis of rT in tRNA of gram-negative Enterobacteriaceae, Rhizobium lupini, and Pseudomonadaceae, suggesting that the rT-specific tRNA methyltransferases of these gram-negative strains use S-adenosylmethionine as coenzyme.
TI  - Effects of subinhibitory concentrations of antibiotics on cross walls of cocci.
AB  - Cultures of Staphylococcus aureus, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Streptococcus bovis were incubated on membrane filters on agar containing antibiotics at one-third to one-fourth the minimal inhibitory concentration for the particular bacterial strain. S. aureus was grown in the presence of oxacillin, cephaloridine, or lincomycin. N. gonorrhoeae and S. bovis were grown in the presence of penicillin. The membranes were then incubated in drug-free agar, after which viability was determined and the cells were examined by electron microscopy. S. aureus exposed to oxacillin and cephaloridine grew into cells two to seven times larger than normal that contained thick multiple cross walls. S. aureus exposed to lincomycin grew into cells 1.5 to 2 times larger than normal, with multiple thick cross walls and periheral cell walls twice the normal thickness. N. gonorrhoeae cells exposed to penicillin were slightly larger than normal and had cross walls that were up to eight times thicker than normal. After transfer to drug-free agar, cells became smaller, and some normal organisms could be seen. S. bovis incubated in the presence of penicillin grew into filaments that contained no cross walls. Two hours after the return to drug-free agar, filaments with cross walls as well as normal cells were observed. Exposure to subinhibitory concentrations of penicillin did not affect the growth of the peripheral cell wall of S. aureus, N. gonorrhoeae, or S. bovis, but appeared to inhibit lysis of cross walls in S. aureus and N. gonorrhoeae and to inhibit the synthesis of cross walls in S. bovis; that is, the rates of peripheral and cross wall formation differed in their susceptibility to penicillin. These facts suggest that peripheral growth and cross wall formation in cocci are separable processes.
TI  - Arthritogenicity in rats of cell walls from several streptococci staphylococci and two other bacteria.
AB  - Bacterial cell walls from Str. bovis, Str. lactis, Str. mutans, Str. thermophilus, Str. salivarius, and Str. pyogenes were able to produce polyarthritis in rats but Str. faecalis cell walls were nonarthritogenic. S. aureus cell walls produced extremely severe disease. It was also shown that cell walls from S. epidermidis, B. megaterium, and M. lysodeikticus were nonarthritogenic. A close correlation was observed between development of arthritis and the delayed hypersensitivity to bacterial peptidoglycans but not with the PPD hypersensitivity. It was suggested that the adjuvanticity of bacterial cell walls is needed to induce the disease and that arthritogenicity requires a specific antigen in addition to the presence of an adjuvant-inducing agent.
TI  - Selective adhesion of microorganisms to the ductular epithelium of the bovine mammary gland.
AB  - Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Corynebacterium bovis were examined for their ability to adhere to the ductular epithelial cells of the bovine udder. S. agalactiae and S. aureus adhered readily and in large numbers, whereas the other organisms adhered poorly or not at all. The organisms showing the ability to adhere are those which frequently cause mastitis. These data suggest that selective adherence to the ductular epithelium may be the first stage in the pathogenesis of streptococcal and staphylococcal mastitis.
