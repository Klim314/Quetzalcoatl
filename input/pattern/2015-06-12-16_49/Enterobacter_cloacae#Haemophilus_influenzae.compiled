TI  - PCR detection and identification of bacterial contaminants in ocular samples from post-operative endophthalmitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial endophthalmitis is a sight-threatening complication of ocular surgery which requires urgent medical consideration including comprehensive diagnosis. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as a sensitive molecular method has been extensively used for detection of microbial species in clinical specimens. AIM: The aim of this study was to identify the causative organisms of endophthalmitis in our patient population using a procedure based on PCR. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Vitreous samples from 32 patients with post-operative endophthalmitis were collected. Total vitreous DNA was extracted and then assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Bacterial 16S rRNA gene was amplified from genomic DNA using PCR with a pair of HAD2 universal primers. Library of PCR products from 16S rRNA, cloned into the pTZ57R/T vector. The ligated products were then transformed into E. coli DH5alpha strain and grown in the LB-ampicillin/X-Gal/IPTG plate. RESULTS: From the total of 32 vitreous samples, 18 specimens were positive, illustrating the presence of bacterial infection (56.4 %). Twelve species including Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Bacillus subtilis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Staphylococcus aureus, Neisseria meningitides, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bacillus cereus were identified using BLAST for known 16S rRNA sequences. CONCLUSION: Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) accompanied with cloning and sequencing approved to be sensitive and specific. The rapid molecular technique was useful in detection of 12 major microbial species, in infectious endophthalmitis.
TI  - Discrepancy in MALDI-TOF MS identification of uncommon Gram-negative bacteria from lower respiratory secretions in patients with cystic fibrosis.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Early identification of microbial organisms from respiratory secretions of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) is important to guide therapeutic decisions. The objective was to compare the accuracy of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) relative to the conventional phenotypic method in identifying common bacterial isolates, including nonfermenting Gram-negative bacteria, in a cohort of patients with CF. METHODS: A total of 123 isolates from 50 patients with CF representing 14 bacterial species from respiratory specimens were identified using MALDI-TOF MS in parallel with conventional phenotypic methods. Discrepancies were confirmed by 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequencing in five Gram-negative isolates. RESULTS: The MALDI-TOF MS managed to identify 122/123 (99.2%) bacterial isolates to the genus level and 118/123 (95.9%) were identified to the species level. The MALDI-TOF MS results were 100% consistent to the species level with conventional phenotypic identification for isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Achromobacter xylosoxidans, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and other uncommon organisms such as Chryseobacterium gleum and Enterobacter cloacae. The 5/123 (4.6%) isolates misidentified were all Gram-negative bacteria. The isolation of E. cloacae and Haemophilus paraphrohaemolyticus may extend the potentially pathogenic list of organisms isolated from patients with CF. CONCLUSION: Although the technique provides an early identification and antimicrobial therapy approach in patients with CF, limitation in the diagnosis of uncommon Gram-negative bacteria may exist.
TI  - In vitro activity of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam alone and in combination with avibactam against European Gram-negative and Gram-positive clinical isolates.
AB  - Recent clinical isolates of key Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria were collected in 2012 from hospitalised patients in medical centres in four European countries (France, Germany, Italy and Spain) and were tested using standard broth microdilution methodology to assess the impact of 4mg/L avibactam on the in vitro activities of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam. Against Enterobacteriaceae, addition of avibactam significantly enhanced the level of activity of these antimicrobials. MIC90 values (minimum inhibitory concentration that inhibits 90% of the isolates) of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Citrobacter freundii and Morganella morganii were reduced up to 128-fold or greater when combined with avibactam. A two-fold reduction in the MIC90 of ceftazidime to 8mg/L was noted in Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates when combined with avibactam, whereas little effect of avibactam was noted on the MIC values of the test compounds when tested against Acinetobacter baumannii isolates. Avibactam had little effect on the excellent activity of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam against Haemophilus influenzae. It had no impact on the in vitro activity of ceftazidime and ceftaroline against staphylococci and streptococci. This study demonstrates that addition of avibactam enhances the activities of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam against Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa but not against A. baumannii.
TI  - In vitro activity of ceftaroline-avibactam against gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens isolated from patients in Canadian hospitals from 2010 to 2012: results from the CANWARD surveillance study.
AB  - The in vitro activities of ceftaroline-avibactam, ceftaroline, and comparative agents were determined for a collection of bacterial pathogens frequently isolated from patients seeking care at 15 Canadian hospitals from January 2010 to December 2012. In total, 9,758 isolates were tested by using the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) broth microdilution method (document M07-A9, 2012), with MICs interpreted by using CLSI breakpoints (document M100-S23, 2013). Ceftaroline-avibactam demonstrated potent activity (MIC90, </= 0.5 mug/ml) against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, Morganella morganii, Citrobacter freundii, and Haemophilus influenzae; >99% of isolates of E. coli, K. pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, C. freundii, and H. influenzae were susceptible to ceftaroline-avibactam according to CLSI MIC interpretative criteria for ceftaroline. Ceftaroline was less active than ceftaroline-avibactam against all species of Enterobacteriaceae tested, with rates of susceptibility ranging from 93.9% (P. mirabilis) to 54.0% (S. marcescens). All isolates of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MIC90, 0.25 mug/ml) and 99.6% of methicillin-resistant S. aureus isolates (MIC90, 1 mug/ml) were susceptible to ceftaroline; the addition of avibactam to ceftaroline did not alter its activity against staphylococci or streptococci. All isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC90, 0.03 mug/ml), Streptococcus pyogenes (MIC90, </= 0.03 mug/ml), and Streptococcus agalactiae (MIC90, 0.015 mug/ml) tested were susceptible to ceftaroline. We conclude that combining avibactam with ceftaroline expanded its spectrum of activity to include most isolates of Enterobacteriaceae resistant to third-generation cephalosporins, including extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)- and AmpC-producing E. coli and ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae, while maintaining potent activity against staphylococci and streptococci.
TI  - Microbiological diagnosis and antibiotic therapy in patients with community-acquired pneumonia and acute COPD exacerbation in daily clinical practice: comparison to current guidelines.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this secondary analysis was to evaluate current microbiological approaches, microbiology, and antibiotic therapy in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) in clinical practice and to compare them with current international guidelines. METHODS: A total of 362 patients with suspected CAP were enrolled in 14 European centers in a prospective multicenter study. RESULTS: A total of 279 inpatients (CAP, n = 222; AECOPD, n = 57) were evaluated. A total of 83 (37 %) CAP patients and 25 (44 %) AECOPD patients did not undergo any microbiological tests. In patients with CAP/AECOPD, blood culture was performed in 109 (49 %)/16 (28.1 %), urinary antigen tests for Legionella pneumophila in 67 (30 %)/9 (16 %), and sputum investigation in 55 (25 %)/17 (30 %), respectively. The most frequent pathogens in CAP were Streptococcus pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, L. pneumophila, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterobacter cloacae; in AECOPD they were Escherichia coli, Haemophilus haemolyticus, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. All CAP patients (mean = 11.1 days) and 35 (61.4 %) of AECOPD patients (mean = 8.9 days) received antibiotics. CAP patients were given mostly aminopenicillin with beta-lactamase inhibitors and AECOPD patients were given mostly cephalosporins. CONCLUSIONS: Pathogens isolated in CAP and AECOPD and the antibiotic therapy used are in good accordance with the guidelines. Blood culture, recommended for all CAP patients, was performed in only 50 % of the cases and antibiotic therapy lasted longer than the suggested 5-7 days. Therefore, international guidelines regarding performance of blood culture and duration of antibiotic therapy should be adopted more often. This duration was independent of the number of isolated pathogens and number of symptoms on admission. Therefore, the question arises as to whether microbiological data are necessary only for patients who are resistant to initial therapy.
TI  - The unique structure of Haemophilus influenzae protein E reveals multiple binding sites for host factors.
AB  - Haemophilus influenzae protein E (PE) is a multifunctional adhesin involved in direct interactions with lung epithelial cells and host proteins, including plasminogen and the extracellular matrix proteins vitronectin and laminin. We recently crystallized PE and successfully collected X-ray diffraction data at 1.8 A. Here, we solved the structure of a recombinant version of PE and analyzed different functional regions. It is a dimer in solution and in the asymmetric unit of the crystals. The dimer has a structure that resembles a flattened beta-barrel. It is, however, not a true beta-barrel, as there are differences in both the hydrogen-bonding pattern and the shape. Each monomer consisted of a 6-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet with a rigid alpha-helix at the C terminus tethered to the concave side of the sheet by a disulfide bridge. The laminin/plasminogen binding region (residues 41 to 68) is exposed, while the vitronectin binding region (residues 84 to 108) is partially accessible in the dimer. The dimerized PE explains the simultaneous interaction with laminin and vitronectin. In addition, we found this unique adhesin to be present in many bacterial genera of the family Pasteurellaceae and also orthologues in other, unrelated species (Enterobacter cloacae and Listeria monocytogenes). Peptides corresponding to the surface-exposed regions PE 24 to 37, PE 74 to 89, and PE 134 to 156 were immunogenic in the mouse. Importantly, these peptide-based antibodies also recognized PE at the bacterial surface. Taken together, our detailed structure of PE explains how this important virulence factor of H. influenzae simultaneously interacts with host vitronectin, laminin, or plasminogen, promoting bacterial pathogenesis.
TI  - Efficacy and safety of moxifloxacin for community-acquired bacterial pneumonia based on pharmacokinetic analysis.
AB  - Moxifloxacin is a respiratory quinolone that is expected to be useful for treating community-acquired bacterial pneumonia, but few clinical studies and not a detailed evaluation of its pharmacokinetics have been conducted in Japan in patients with pneumonia. We assessed the efficacy and safety of moxifloxacin in 18 patients with community-acquired bacterial pneumonia using pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic analysis. There was significant improvement in body temperature, white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, and chest X-ray score on day 3 of moxifloxacin treatment, which persisted until the completion of treatment (all p < 0.05). Nine strains, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Enterobacter cloacae, were isolated from sputum cultures of nine patients. The isolated strains were eradicated by moxifloxacin. The mean area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 hours [AUC(0-24 h) (AUC(0-24 h,ss))], maximum plasma concentration (C(max)), and trough plasma level (C(trough)) of moxifloxacin at steady state was 52.0 mug h/ml, 4.5, and 0.9 mug/ml, respectively. Mean AUC(0-24 h,ss)/mimimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), and C(max)/MIC ratios for patients in whom MICs of moxifloxacin were determined for pathogenic bacteria were 723 and 62, respectively. The median AUC(0-24 h,ss)/MIC and C(max)/MIC ratios (based on Monte Carlo simulation employing MICs for 257 strains of S. pneumoniae collected during a respiratory infection survey by the Japanese Society of Chemotherapy in 2007) were 209.56 and 17.88, respectively. Thus, when the target for the AUC/MIC ratio was set at >/=30 and that for the C(max)/MIC ratio at >/=5, the achievement rate for these two parameters was 97.36% and 96.71%, respectively. Two patients (11%) experienced three adverse effects [one nausea, another increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT)], but the events were not serious. Based on these results, moxifloxacin (400 mg once daily) was considered useful for treating community-acquired bacterial pneumonia and is expected to show excellent efficacy and safety as well as suppressing the emergence of resistance.
TI  - [Comparative studies on the composition and antibiotic-resistance of pathogenic bacteria between children with community-acquired and hospital-acquired pneumonia].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This research was to explore the difference between children with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) in the composition and antibiotic-resistance of pathogenic bacteria. METHODS: 241 CAP and 116 HAP with positive sputum culture who were hospitalized from January to December in 2008 in Children's Hospital Affiliated to Suzhou University were selected in this study. The bacteria were identified by traditionally manual method and antibiotic sensitivity tests were performed by K-B method. The chi-square or Fisher's exact test were used for statistical test. RESULTS: In 241 CAP, Streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenza accounted for (42.2%, 106/251) and (12.4%, 31/251) infection, respectively; however in 116 HAP, Enterobacteriaceae and Non-fermenters accounted for (88.2%, 127/144). In addition, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus weren't isolated, however, its detection rate was 66.7% in HAP. The drug resistance was 1.5 times higher in HAP than that in CAP for several types of antibiotics, such as ceftazidime (37.5% (6/16) vs 75.6% (31/41)), cefepime (37.5% (6/16) vs 78.0% (32/41)), aztreonam (50.0% (8/16) vs 90.2% (37/41)), cefoperazone/sulbactam (12.5% (2/16) vs 51.2% (21/41)) and piperacillin/tazobactam (12.5% (2/16) vs 56.0% (23/41)). Klebsiella pneumoniae isolated from HAP had higher drug resistance than that isolated from CAP against some antibiotics, for example, gentamicin (0 vs 63.6% (7/11)), SMZ + TMP (20.0% (1/5) vs 63.6% (7/11)) and cefoperazone/sulbactam (0 vs 54.5% (6/11)). We also found Enterobacter cloacae isolated from HAP showed high drug resistance than that isolated from CAP against imipenem (0 vs 46.7% (7/15)), aztreonam (9.1% (1/11) vs 60.0% (9/15)) and cefoperazone (18.2% (2/11) vs 80.0% (12/15)) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa from HAP had higher resistance than that from CAP against gentamicin (0 vs 50.0% (9/18)), amikacin (0 vs 38.9% (7/18)), ceftazidime (0 vs 55.6% (10/18)), cefepime (0 vs 50.0% (9/18)) and cefoperazone (33.3% (2/6) vs 94.4% (17/18)). The detection rates of ESBLs for Escherichia coli were 84.6% (11/13) and 93.3% (14/15) in CAP and HAP, respectively (chi(2) = 0.553, P > 0.05); while for Klebsiella pneumoniae, they were 81.3% (13/16) and 95.1% (39/41), respectively (chi(2) = 2.767, P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: CAP was mainly comprised of Streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenza; while HAP was mainly comprised of Enterobacteriaceae and Non-fermenters. The drug resistance of gram-negative bacilli was higher in HAP than that in CAP.
TI  - Comparative activity of tigecycline and tetracycline on Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria revealed by a multicentre study in four North European countries.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study involves a multicentre surveillance of tigecycline and tetracycline activity against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria from primary care centres (PCCs), general hospital wards (GHWs) and intensive care units (ICUs) in Denmark (n = 9), Finland (n = 10), Norway (n = 7) and Sweden (n = 19). METHODS: The hospitals were each asked to test 30 consecutive Gram-positive and 30 Gram-negative clinical isolates. Supportive information accompanying each isolate included the study centre, ward level (PCC, GHW, or ICU), patient identification and source of the isolate. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for tetracycline and tigecycline were determined with the Etest. RESULTS: The isolates collected comprised 1610 Gram-negative and 1767 Gram-positive clinical isolates. The study showed low rates of non-susceptibility (intermediate (I) and resistant (R)) to tigecycline: <1% in Escherichia coli, though other Enterobacteriaceae showed higher rates (Enterobacter cloacae (7%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (9%) and Serratia spp. (23%)). The overall non-susceptibility rate for tigecycline in Enterobacteriaceae with species-related breakpoints for tigecycline was 6% (4% excluding Serratia spp.). The activity of tigecycline against Haemophilus influenzae and Acinetobacter spp. was high with a MIC(50) of 0.25 mg/l and MIC(90) of 1 mg/l. The prevalence of non-susceptibility to tigecycline among Gram-positive bacteria was <1%. The corresponding figure for tetracycline was 14%. The activity of tigecycline against Streptococcus pneumoniae was high with MIC(50) and MIC(90) of 0.125 mg/l. CONCLUSION: Tigecycline showed good overall in vitro activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative isolates, including both tetracycline-susceptible and resistant isolates. Most non-susceptibility to tigecycline among Enterobacteriaceae other than E. coli was I (6%), rather than R (<1%). This indicates a problem setting interpretive species-related tigecycline breakpoints for Enterobacteriaceae other than E. coli.
TI  - Comparative ceftaroline activity tested against pathogens associated with community-acquired pneumonia: results from an international surveillance study.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To document the spectrum of activity of ceftaroline, the active form  of the prodrug, ceftaroline fosamil, a new cephalosporin with anti-methicillin-resistant staphylococcal activity, against a surveillance collection of clinical isolates obtained from the USA and Europe during 2008-09. METHODS: A selected group of species associated with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP; 6496 of 17 326 monitored strains) were tested for susceptibility in a central laboratory using CLSI broth microdilution methods. Organisms were sampled from 55 medical centres, 27 in the USA and 28 (12 countries) in Europe. Ceftaroline and comparator agents were tested and interpretations of MIC endpoints made by applying current CLSI (2010) and EUCAST (2010) breakpoint criteria. RESULTS: Against 1340 Streptococcus pneumoniae, ceftaroline inhibited all isolates at </=0.5 mg/L (MIC(50/90), </=0.008/0.12 mg/L) and was 8-fold more active than ceftriaxone (MIC(90), 1 mg/L; only 79.2% coverage at EUCAST breakpoint). Haemophilus influenzae (n = 584; MIC(50/90), </=0.008/0.015 mg/L), Moraxella catarrhalis (n = 377; MIC(50/90), 0.03-0.06/0.12 mg/L) and Staphylococcus aureus (n = 590; MIC(50/90), 0.5/1 mg/L) were very susceptible to ceftaroline, regardless of beta-lactamase production or multidrug resistance (MDR) patterns. The potency of ceftaroline against three species of Enterobacteriaceae (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae) was similar to that of ceftriaxone, ceftazidime and piperacillin/tazobactam. Only modest differences in rates of ceftaroline susceptibility (breakpoint </=2 mg/L) were noted with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-negative Enterobacteriaceae strains between the USA and Europe (97.9% versus 97.0% for E. coli). Ceftaroline, like ceftriaxone, was not active against ceftazidime-resistant E. coli (10.2%-26.2% susceptible at </=2 mg/L) or K. pneumoniae (5.3%-11.2%). CONCLUSIONS: The ceftaroline surveillance for 2008-09 (USA and Europe) documented low MIC(50/90) values for S. aureus isolates at 0.5/1 and 0.25/1 mg/L, respectively. More importantly, ceftaroline MIC(90) results for S. pneumoniae (0.12 mg/L), H. influenzae (0.015 mg/L) and M. catarrhalis (0.12 mg/L) were very low, all MICs being </=0.5 mg/L. Ceftaroline exhibited promising high potency and wide coverage against Gram-positive and -negative pathogens known to cause CAP, especially isolates of MDR pneumococci and methicillin-resistant S. aureus.
TI  - Prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant pathogens in Canadian hospitals: results of the Canadian Ward Surveillance Study (CANWARD 2008).
AB  - A total of 5,282 bacterial isolates obtained between 1 January and 31 December 31 2008, inclusive, from patients in 10 hospitals across Canada as part of the Canadian Ward Surveillance Study (CANWARD 2008) underwent susceptibility testing. The 10 most common organisms, representing 78.8% of all clinical specimens, were as follows: Escherichia coli (21.4%), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA; 13.9%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (10.3%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7.1%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (6.0%), coagulase-negative staphylococci/Staphylococcus epidermidis (5.4%), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA; 5.1%), Haemophilus influenzae (4.1%), Enterococcus spp. (3.3%), Enterobacter cloacae (2.2%). MRSA comprised 27.0% (272/1,007) of all S. aureus isolates (genotypically, 68.8% of MRSA were health care associated [HA-MRSA] and 27.6% were community associated [CA-MRSA]). Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing E. coli occurred in 4.9% of E. coli isolates. The CTX-M type was the predominant ESBL, with CTX-M-15 the most prevalent genotype. MRSA demonstrated no resistance to ceftobiprole, daptomycin, linezolid, telavancin, tigecycline, or vancomycin (0.4% intermediate intermediate resistance). E. coli demonstrated no resistance to ertapenem, meropenem, or tigecycline. Resistance rates with P. aeruginosa were as follows: colistin (polymyxin E), 0.8%; amikacin, 3.5%; cefepime, 7.2%; gentamicin, 12.3%; fluoroquinolones, 19.0 to 24.1%; meropenem, 5.6%; piperacillin-tazobactam, 8.0%. A multidrug-resistant (MDR) phenotype occurred frequently in P. aeruginosa (5.9%) but uncommonly in E. coli (1.2%) and K. pneumoniae (0.9%). In conclusion, E. coli, S. aureus (MSSA and MRSA), P. aeruginosa, S. pneumoniae, K. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and Enterococcus spp. are the most common isolates recovered from clinical specimens in Canadian hospitals. The prevalence of MRSA was 27.0% (of which genotypically 27.6% were CA-MRSA), while ESBL-producing E. coli occurred in 4.9% of isolates. An MDR phenotype was common in P. aeruginosa.
TI  - In vitro activity of tigecycline and comparator agents against a global collection of Gram-negative and Gram-positive organisms: tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial 2004 to 2007.
AB  - The Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial began in 2004 to monitor the in vitro activity of tigecycline and comparator agents against a global collection of Gram-negative and Gram-positive pathogens. Against Gram negatives (n = 63 699), tigecycline MIC(90)'s ranged from 0.25 to 2 mg/L for Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Serratia marcescens (but was > or =32 for Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Against Gram-positive organisms (n = 32 218), tigecycline MIC(90)'s were between 0.06 and 0.25 mg/L for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis. The in vitro activity of tigecycline was maintained against resistant phenotypes, including multidrug-resistant A. baumannii (9.2% of isolates), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing E. coli (7.0%) and K. pneumoniae (14.0%), beta-lactamase-producing H. influenzae (22.2%), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (44.5%), vancomycin-resistant E. faecium (45.9%) and E. faecalis (2.8%), and penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (13.8%). Tigecycline represents a welcome addition to the armamentarium against difficult to treat organisms.
TI  - [Bacterial etiology of pneumonia in hospitalized children: combined detection with culture and polymerase chain reaction].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Bacterial cultures from respiratory aspirate or sputum have been the conventional diagnostic method for pneumonia, but the results of culture was often affected by early extensive use of antibiotics, sample collection and delivery. The objective of this study was to explore application of the combined detection of culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay in hospitalized children with pneumonia. METHODS: Totally 187 hospitalized children with pneumonia were enrolled. The age of the patients ranged from 1 month to 10 years, 124 were male, 63 female; 175 of the patients received antibiotics treatment before admission. Deep respiratory aspirate sample from patients was cultured by Streptococcus pneumoniae selective plate, Hemophilus influenzae selective plate and conventional plate. The aspirate samples were also amplified for DNA of 14 bacteria with target enriched multiplex polymerase chain reaction (Tem-PCR) and detected with Luminex xMAP technology platform. RESULTS: The total positive rate by bacterial culture was 40.1% (75/187), of which 17.1% (24/187) were Hemophilus influenzae b, 8.6% (16/187) were Escherichia coli, 6.4% (12/187) were Klebsiella pneumoniae, 4.8% (9/187) were Staphylococcus aureus, 3.7% (7/187) were Streptococcus pneumoniae, 1.6% (3/187) were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 1.1% (2/187) were Acinetobacter baumannii, and 1.1% (2/187) were Enterobacter cloacae. The total positive rate by combined detection of culture and Tem-PCR assay were 78.6% (147/187), of which 28.9% (54/187) were Hemophilus influenzae b, 19.3% (36/187) were Streptococcus pneumoniae, 8.6% (16/187) were Escherichia coli, 6.4% (12/187) were Klebsiella pneumoniae, 5.9% (11/187) were Staphylococcus aureus, 5.9% (11/187) were Acinetobacter baumannii, 2.7% (5/187) were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 1.1% (2/187) were Enterobacter cloacae. CONCLUSION: The Tem-PCR assay may increase the detection rate of Hemophilus influenzae b, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. The Combined detection may increase the positive rate of bacterial pathogens in hospitalized children with pneumonia, and the results might reflect the real patterns of bacterial etiology. The Tem-PCR needs further improvement for diagnosis of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae.
TI  - Postantibiotic effect of tigecycline against 14 gram-positive organisms.
AB  - The in vitro postantibiotic effects (PAEs), postantibiotic sub-MIC effects (PA-SMEs), and sub-MIC effects of tigecycline were determined for 14 gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. The pneumococcal, staphylococcal, and enterococcal PAEs were 1.9 to 5.1, 2.9 to 5.7, and 3.9 to 6.1 h, respectively, and those for Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, and Acinetobacter baumannii were 1.1 to 5.0, 1.9 to 2.1, 1.7 to 1.8, 1.0 to 1.7, and 0.7 to 3 h, respectively. The PA-SMEs (four times the MIC) ranged from 6.7 to >11 h for gram-positive organisms and from 2.3 to >11.3 h for gram-negative organisms.
TI  - [Nationwide surveillance of parenteral antibiotics containing meropenem activities against clinically isolated strains in 2006].
AB  - The antibacterial activity of meropenem (MEPM) and other parenteral antibiotics against clinical isolates of 876 strains of Gram-positive bacteria, 1764 strains of Gram-negative bacteria, and 198 strains of anaerobic bacteria obtained from 30 medical institutions during 2006 was measured. The results were as follows; 1. MEPM was more active than the other carbapenem antibiotics tested against Gram-negative bacteria, especially against enterobacteriaceae and Haemophilus influenzae. MEPM was also active against most of the species tested in Gram-positive and anaerobic bacteria, except for multi-drug resistant strains including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. 2. As for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, all of the MEPM-resistant strains were resistant to imipenem (IPM). MEPM showed low cross-resistant rate both againt IPM-resistant P. aeruginosa (41.8%) and ciprofloxacin-resistant P. aeruginosa (33.3%). 3. The proportion of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) strains was 4.3% (6 strains) in Escherichia coli, 1.1% (1 strain) in Citrobacter freundii, 21.7% (5 strains) in Citrobacter koseri, 3.1% (4 strains) in Klebsiella pneumoniae, 3.3% (3 strains) in Enterobacter cloacae, 0.8% (1 strain) in Serratia marcescens, and 4.9% (2 strains) in Providencia spp. The proportion of metallo-beta-lactamase strains was 3.1% (10 strains) in P. aeruginosa. 4. Of all species tested, there were no species, which MIC90 of MEPM was more than 4-fold higher than those in our previous study. Therefore, there is almost no significant decrease in susceptibility of clinical isolates to meropenem. In conclusion, the results from this surveillance study suggest that MEPM retains its potent and broad antibacterial activity and therefore is a clinically useful carbapenem at present, 11 years after available for commercial use.
TI  - Antimicrobial-resistant pathogens in intensive care units in Canada: results of the Canadian National Intensive Care Unit (CAN-ICU) study, 2005-2006.
AB  - Between 1 September 2005 and 30 June 2006, 19 medical centers collected 4,180 isolates recovered from clinical specimens from patients in intensive care units (ICUs) in Canada. The 4,180 isolates were collected from 2,292 respiratory specimens (54.8%), 738 blood specimens (17.7%), 581 wound/tissue specimens (13.9%), and 569 urinary specimens (13.6%). The 10 most common organisms isolated from 79.5% of all clinical specimens were methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) (16.4%), Escherichia coli (12.8%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10.0%), Haemophilus influenzae (7.9%), coagulase-negative staphylococci/Staphylococcus epidermidis (6.5%), Enterococcus spp. (6.1%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (5.8%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (5.8%), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (4.7%), and Enterobacter cloacae (3.9%). MRSA made up 22.3% (197/884) of all S. aureus isolates (90.9% of MRSA were health care-associated MRSA, and 9.1% were community-associated MRSA), while vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) made up 6.7% (11/255) of all enterococcal isolates (88.2% of VRE had the vanA genotype). Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing E. coli and K. pneumoniae occurred in 3.5% (19/536) and 1.8% (4/224) of isolates, respectively. All 19 ESBL-producing E. coli isolates were PCR positive for CTX-M, with bla CTX-M-15 occurring in 74% (14/19) of isolates. For MRSA, no resistance against daptomycin, linezolid, tigecycline, and vancomycin was observed, while the resistance rates to other agents were as follows: clarithromycin, 89.9%; clindamycin, 76.1%; fluoroquinolones, 90.1 to 91.8%; and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, 11.7%. For E. coli, no resistance to amikacin, meropenem, and tigecycline was observed, while resistance rates to other agents were as follows: cefazolin, 20.1%; cefepime, 0.7%; ceftriaxone, 3.7%; gentamicin, 3.0%; fluoroquinolones, 21.1%; piperacillin-tazobactam, 1.9%; and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, 24.8%. Resistance rates for P. aeruginosa were as follows: amikacin, 2.6%; cefepime, 10.2%; gentamicin, 15.2%; fluoroquinolones, 23.8 to 25.5%; meropenem, 13.6%; and piperacillin-tazobactam, 9.3%. A multidrug-resistant (MDR) phenotype (resistance to three or more of the following drugs: cefepime, piperacillin-tazobactam, meropenem, amikacin or gentamicin, and ciprofloxacin) occurred frequently in P. aeruginosa (12.6%) but uncommonly in E. coli (0.2%), E. cloacae (0.6%), or K. pneumoniae (0%). In conclusion, S. aureus (MSSA and MRSA), E. coli, P. aeruginosa, H. influenzae, Enterococcus spp., S. pneumoniae, and K. pneumoniae are the most common isolates recovered from clinical specimens in Canadian ICUs. A MDR phenotype is common for P. aeruginosa isolates in Canadian ICUs.
TI  - Microbiological surveillance and parenteral antibiotic use in a critical care unit.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate parenteral antibiotic utilization and bacterial resistance patterns in a critical care unit (CrCU). DESIGN: Descriptive, prospective audit of infection site, culture and antimicrobial susceptibility test results, parenteral antibiotic usage and duration, total antibiotic acquisition costs, and length of stay. SETTING: A 17-bed medical-surgical CrCU in a tertiary care teaching hospital in Metropolitan Toronto. PATIENTS: Two hundred and fifty-eight patients admitted to the CrCU between May 1995 and April 1996 who received antimicrobial therapy. RESULTS: The most frequently prescribed antibiotics were cefazolin (47%, 1098 g), gentamicin (33%,141 g) and ceftriaxone (20%, 255 g). The most common indications for antimicrobial therapy included surgical prophylaxis (34%) and pneumonia (35%). The following organisms were isolated from patients treated with antibiotics: Staphylococcus aureus (26%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (13%), enterococci (12%), Haemophilus influenzae (11%), Escherichia coli (11%), Enterobacter cloacae (8%) and other Gram-negative bacilli (19%). Only 9% of Gram-negative bacilli were resistant to aminoglycosides, 3% were resistant to ciprofloxacin and no extended-spectrum beta-lactamases or imipenem-resistance were detected. No vancomycin-resistant enterococci and only two methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolates were identified. CONCLUSIONS: Antibiotic use during the audit appeared appropriate for the specific clinical indications. Low levels of bacterial resistance were detected during the audit.
TI  - Ceftobiprole medocaril (BAL5788) treatment of experimental Haemophilus influenzae, Enterobacter cloacae, and Klebsiella pneumoniae murine pneumonia.
AB  - Ceftobiprole (BAL9141) is an investigational cephalosporin active against methicillin- and vancomycin-resistant staphylococci administered as a water-soluble prodrug, ceftobiprole medocaril (BAL5788). Using an immunocompetent murine pneumonia model of Haemophilus influenzae, Enterobacter cloacae, or extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) nonproducing or producing Klebsiella pneumoniae pneumonia, we compared results of treatment with ceftobiprole medocaril (71 mg/kg, sc, qid), ceftriaxone (50 mg/kg, im, bid), or cefepime (50 mg/kg, ip, q.i.d.). Results were expressed as median and 25th to 75th percentile log10 colony forming units per gram of lung tissue. Ceftobiprole, ceftriaxone, and cefepime were each more active than was no treatment and were equally active for treatment of experimental H. influenzae, E. cloacae, or ESBL-nonproducing K. pneumoniae pneumonia. For ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae, no differences were detected between no treatment and treatment with ceftobiprole, ceftriaxone, or cefepime. Ceftobiprole is active against H. influenzae, E. cloacae, and ESBL-nonproducing K. pneumoniae in an immunocompetent experimental murine pneumonia model.
TI  - [Nationwide surveillance of parenteral antibiotics containing meropenem activities against clinically isolated strains in 2004].
AB  - The antibacterial activity of meropenem (MEPM) and other parenteral antibiotics against clinical isolates of 907 strains of Gram-positive bacteria, 1790 strains of Gram-negative bacteria, and 192 strains of anaerobic bacteria obtained from 30 medical institutions during 2004 was measured. The results were as follows; 1. MIC90 of MEPM for almost all of enterobacteriaceae and Haemophilus influenzae were 4-fold to 32-fold lower than those of other carbapenems. MEPM was more active than other carbapenem antibiotics against Gram-negative bacteria, especially against enterobacteriaceae and H. influenzae. MEPM were active against most of the species tested in Gram-positive and anaerobic bacteria, except for multi-drug resistant strains including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. 2. As for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, imipenem (IPM) showed high cross-resistant rate againt meropenem-resistant P. aeruginosa (87.9%). MEPM showed low cross-resistant rate both againt IPM-resistant P. aeruginosa (49.2%) and ciprofloxacin-resistant P. aeruginosa (38.0%). 3. The proportion of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) strains was 3.1% (4 strains) in Escherichia coli, 8.0% (2 strains) in Citrobacter koseri, 2.5% (3 strains) in Klebsiella pneumoniae, 2.5% (2 strains) in Enterobacter cloacae, 0.9% (1 strains) in Serratia marcescens, and 2.2% (2 strains) in Proteus mirabilis. The proportion of metallo-beta-lactamase strains was 1.6% (5 strains) in P. aeruginosa. 4. Of all species tested, Peptostreptococcus spp. was the only species, which MIC90 of MEPM was more than 4-fold higher than that in our previous study using clinical isolates during 2002 (0.25 microg/ml --> 1 microg/ml). Therefore, there is almost no siginificant decrease in susceptibility of clinical isolates to meropenem. In conclusion, the results from this surveillance study suggest that MEPM retains its potent and broad antibacterial activity and therefore is a clinically useful carbapenem at present, 9 years after available for commercial use.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of SM-216601, a new broad-spectrum  parenteral carbapenem.
AB  - SM-216601 is a novel parenteral 1beta-methylcarbapenem. In agar dilution susceptibility testing, the MIC of SM-216601 for 90% of the methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains tested (MIC(90)) was 2 microg/ml, which was comparable to those of vancomycin and linezolid. SM-216601 was also very potent against Enterococcus faecium, including vancomycin-resistant strains (MIC(90) = 8 microg/ml). SM-216601 exhibited potent activity against penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis, with MIC(90)s of less than 0.5 microg/ml, and intermediate activity against Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The therapeutic efficacy of SM-216601 against experimentally induced infections in mice caused by S. aureus, E. faecium, E. coli, and P. aeruginosa reflected its in vitro activity and plasma level. Thus, SM-216601 is a promising candidate for nosocomial bacterial infections caused by a wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including multiresistant pathogens.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of CS-023 (RO4908463), a novel parenteral carbapenem.
AB  - CS-023 (RO4908463, formerly R-115685) is a novel 1beta-methylcarbapenem with 5-substituted pyrrolidin-3-ylthio groups, including an amidine moiety at the C-2 position. Its antibacterial activity was tested against 1,214 clinical isolates of 32 species and was compared with those of imipenem, meropenem, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, ampicillin, amikacin, and levofloxacin. CS-023 exhibited a broad spectrum of activity against gram-positive and -negative aerobes and anaerobes, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis, penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP), beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. CS-023 showed the most potent activity among the compounds tested against P. aeruginosa and MRSA, with MICs at which 90% of isolates tested were inhibited of 4 microg/ml and 8 microg/ml, respectively. CS-023 was stable against hydrolysis by the beta-lactamases from Enterobacter cloacae and Proteus vulgaris. CS-023 also showed potent activity against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli. The in vivo efficacy of CS-023 was evaluated with a murine systemic infection model induced by 13 strains of gram-positive and -negative pathogens and a lung infection model induced by 2 strains of PRSP (serotypes 6 and 19). Against the systemic infections with PRSP, MRSA, and P. aeruginosa and the lung infections, the efficacy of CS-023 was comparable to those of imipenem/cilastatin and vancomycin (tested against lung infections only) and superior to those of meropenem, ceftriaxone, and ceftazidime (tested against P. aeruginosa infections only). These results suggest that CS-023 has potential for the treatment of nosocomial bacterial infections by gram-positive and -negative pathogens, including MRSA and P. aeruginosa.
TI  - The binding of MBL to common bacteria in infectious diseases of children.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To purify Mannan-binding lectin (MBL) from human serum and detect its  binding ability to several kinds of bacteria common in infectious diseases of children. METHODS: MBL was purified from human serum by affinity chromatography on mannan-Sepharose 4B column. Its binding ability to eight species, 97 strains of bacteria was detected by enzyme-linked lectin assay (ELLA). RESULTS: MBL has different binding ability to bacteria and shows strong binding ability to Klebsiella ornithinolytica and Escherichia coli, but shows relatively lower binding ability to Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Enterobacter cloacae and Staphylococcus epidermidis. To different isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Staphylococcus aureus, MBL shows quite different binding ability. CONCLUSIONS: MBL has different binding ability to different bacteria, and has relatively stronger binding ability to Gram-negative bacteria. Its binding ability to different isolates of certain kinds of bacteria is quite different.
TI  - [Rapid diagnosis of common pathogenic bacteria infection in newborn infants by 16SrDNA oligonucleotide array].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The rapid identification of pathogenic bacteria is important for earlier effective patient management and antimicrobial therapy, especially for the infant patient, whose immunological system is not fully developed. However conventional microbiogical techniques of bacterial identification, culture and isolation of pathogenic bacteria, identification by biochemistry and serological assay, are time-consuming and require intensive labor. On the basis of special gene sequence, PCR provides simple and rapid way to identify bacteria. But it is difficult to identify all of bacteria species which are suspicious of pathogenic agents. Oligonucleotide arrays provide a powerful tool for parallel detection of target genes. The objective of this study was to test a reverse oligonucleotide assay, which hybridize with the PCR product of 16SrDNA using a pair of universal primers, to rapidly identify common infant pathogenic bacteria. METHODS: By comparison and analysis of the 16SrDNA sequences of common pathogenic bacteria, a region, which has numerous sequence variations and flanked by highly conserved sequences, was found. A pair of universal primers was designed according to its flanking conservative sequence, and a set of probes specially targeting to eight species of infant pathogenic bacteria, including staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus faecalis, Hemophilus influenzae, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, and Acinetobacter baumannii,according to the variable sequences. The probes were fixed on the nylon membrane with positive electricity, and hybridized them with the products of PCR using the universal primers. RESULTS: The universal primers could amplify the target sequence from bacteria including the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria and Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae,beta-hemolytic streptococcus, Neisseria meningitides, Citrobacter freundii, Bacillus subtilis, and Salmonella infantis,but could not amplify rotavirus and human DNA as control. The results showed that the oligonucleotide array could specially hybridize with the eight bacteria to be examined and could not hybridize with other bacteria. The lowest concentration of DNA (product of PCR) for oligonucleotide array was about 25 ng/ml. The results proved that the probes are highly selective and the oligonucleotide arrays could parallelly detect the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria. The results suggested that the oligonucleotide array system was able to identify the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria from clinical specimens and the results were the same as identified by automated bacterial detection machine. From the further experiments, the oligonucleotide array system could directly diagnose the common infant pathogenic bacteria from the broths of samples culture. CONCLUSIONS: Despite limited number of identifiable bacteria and lack of information on antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria, the reverse oligonucleotide assay system, which contains amplification of the segment of 16rDNA from samples using the universal primers and parallel detection of PCR products using specific probes, is an effective method to rapidly identify the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria.
TI  - Prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in bacteria isolated from central nervous  system specimens as reported by U.S. hospital laboratories from 2000 to 2002.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial infections of the central nervous system, especially acute  infections such as bacterial meningitis require immediate, invariably empiric antibiotic therapy. The widespread emergence of resistance among bacterial species is a cause for concern. Current antibacterial susceptibility data among central nervous system (CNS) pathogens is important to define current prevalence of resistance. METHODS: Antimicrobial susceptibility of pathogens isolated from CNS specimens was analyzed using The Surveillance Database (TSN) USA Database which gathers routine antibiotic susceptibility data from >300 US hospital laboratories. A total of 6029 organisms derived from CNS specimen sources during 2000-2002, were isolated and susceptibility tested. RESULTS: Staphylococcus aureus (23.7%) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (11.0%) were the most common gram-positive pathogens. Gram-negative species comprised approximately 25% of isolates. The modal patient age was 1 or <1 year for most organisms. Prevalence of MRSA among S. aureus from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and brain abscesses were 29.9-32.9%. Penicillin resistance rates were 16.6% for S. pneumoniae, 5.3% for viridans group streptococci, and 0% for S. agalactiae. For CSF isolates, ceftriaxone resistance was S. pneumoniae (3.5%), E. coli (0.6%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (2.8%), Serratia marcescens (5.6%), Enterobacter cloacae (25.0%), Haemophilus influenzae (0%). Listeria monocytogenes and N. meningitidis are not routinely susceptibility tested. CONCLUSIONS: Resistance is commonly detected, albeit still at relatively low levels for key drugs classes such as third-generation cephalosporins. This data demonstrates the need to consider predominant resistance phenotypes when choosing empiric therapies to treat CNS infections.
TI  - Increasing prevalence of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, expanded-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae, and imipenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa in Korea: KONSAR study in 2001.
AB  - The 5th year KONSAR surveillance in 2001 was based on routine test data at 30 participating hospitals. It was of particular interest to find a trend in the resistances of enterococci to vancomycin, of Enterobacteriaceae to the 3rd generation cephalosporin and fluoroquinolone, and of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacters to carbapenem. Resistance rates of Gram-positive cocci were: 70% of Staphylococcus aureus to oxacillin; 88% and 16% of Enterococcus faecium to ampicillin and vancomycin, respectively. Seventy-two percent of pneumococci were nonsusceptible to penicillin. The resistance rates of Enterobacteriaceae were: Escherichia coli, 28% to fluoroquinolone; Klebsiella pneumoniae, 27% to ceftazidime, and 20% to cefoxitin; and Enterobacter cloacae, > or =40% to cefotaxime and ceftazidime. The resistance rates of P. aeruginosa were 21% to ceftazidime, 17% to imipenem, and those of the acinetobacters were > or =61% to ceftazidime, aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolone and cotrimoxazole. Thirty-five percent of non-typhoidal salmonellae were ampicillin resistant, and 66% of Haemophilus influenzae were beta-lactamase producers. Notable changes over the 1997-2001 period were: increases in vancomycin-resistant E. faecium, and amikacin- and fluoroquinolone-resistant acinetobacters. With the increasing prevalence of resistant bacteria, nationwide surveillance has become more important for optimal patient management, for the control of nosocomial infection, and for the conservation of the newer antimicrobial agents.
TI  - In vitro activity of BAL9141 against clinical isolates of gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - The minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration of BAL9141 against 150 clinical isolates of gram-negative bacteria were determined and compared to those of cefepime and ceftriaxone. BAL9141 exhibited comparable activity to cefepime and ceftriaxone against Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase nonproducing Enterobacter cloacae, and comparable activity to cefepime against Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - [Post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--II. Gram-negative bacteria].
AB  - As a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, monobactams, and penicillins. Changes in CZOP susceptibility among bacteria were also evaluated with the bacterial resistance ratio calculated from the breakpoint MIC. Twenty-five species (4,154 strains) of Gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2001, and consisted of Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, Serratia liquefaciens, Citrobacter freundii, Citrobacter koseri, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Pseudomonas putida, Acinetobacter baumannii, Acinetobacter Iwoffii, Burkholderia cepacia, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Bacteroides fragilis group, and Prevotella/Porphyromonas. CZOP preserved its antibacterial activity against M. (B.) catarrhalis (MIC90: 4 micrograms/mL) and showed comparable activity to carbapenems against H. influenzae (MIC90: 1 microgram/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. coli was preferable (MIC90: 0.125 microgram/mL) and comparable to those of cefpirome (CPR), cefepime (CFPM), and imipenem (IPM). The MIC90 of CZOP against K. pneumoniae and K. oxytoca was 1 and 0.25 microgram/mL, respectively. The MIC90 of CZOP against E. cloacae increased during 6 years (32 to 128 micrograms/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. aerogenes was preferable (MIC90: 1 microgram/mL). The antibacterial activities of CZOP against S. marcescens and S. liquefaciens were relatively potent (MIC90: 0.5 and 0.25 microgram/mL) and comparable to those of CPR, CFPM, and carumonam. CZOP preserved comparable antibacterial activity to CPR against C. freundii and C. koseri (MIC90: 8 and 0.125 micrograms/mL). The MIC90 of CZOP against P. mirabilis, P. vulgaris, and M. morganii was 0.25, 16, and 2 micrograms/mL, respectively. The antibacterial activity of CZOP against Providencia spp. was moderate (MIC90: 64 micrograms/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against P. aeruginosa was the most potent (MIC90: 16 micrograms/mL) among the test agents and comparable to those CFPM, IPM, and MEPM. CZOP had low activity against P. fluorescens and P. putida (MIC90: 128 micrograms/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against A. baumannii was comparable to those of ceftazidime (CAZ), CPR and CFPM (MIC90: 32 micrograms/mL) and against A. lwoffii was moderate (MIC90: 64 micrograms/mL). Most of the test agents including CZOP had low antibacterial activity against B. cepacia, S. maltophilia, and B. fragilis group. The MIC90 of CZOP against Prevotella/Porphyromonas was 64 micrograms/mL. Bacterial cross-resistance ratio between CZOP and other agents was low in most of the species, ranging from 0.0 to 15.1%. In non-glucose fermentative bacteria, however, the bacterial cross-resistance ratio between CZOP and CFPM, CAZ, CPR, or IPM was high, being 36.8%, 28.0%, 38.7%, or 31.1%, respectively. In conclusion, the 6-year duration study suggested that the antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. cloacae possible decreased, but against other Gram-negative bacteria was consistent with the study results obtained until the new drug application approval.
TI  - [Yearly changes in antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates between 1996 and 2001--II. Gram-negative bacteria].
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2001 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems and carbapenems. A total of 3,245 strains in 32 species of Gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from January to December, and consisted of Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, Citrobacter koseri, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabillis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia spp. (P. alcalifaciens, P. rettgeri, P. stuartii), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas putida, Burkholderia cepacia, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Haemophilus influenzae, Acinetobactor baumannii, Acinetobactor lwoffii, Bacteroides fragilis group (B. fragilis, B. vulgatus, B. distasonis, B. ovatus, B. thetaiotaomicron), and Prevotella spp. (P. melaninogenica, P. intermedia, P. bivia, P. oralis, P. denticola). CZOP possessed stable antibacterial activities against M. (B.) catarrhalis, E. coli, C. freundii, C. koseri, K. pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, E. aerogenes, E. cloacae, S. marcescens, P. mirabilis, P. vulgaris, M. morganii, Providencia spp., P. aeruginosa, and A. lwoffii throughout 6 years. The MIC90 of CZOP against those strains were consistent with those obtained from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. On the other hand, the MIC90 of CZOP against H. influenzae yearly obviously increased with approximately 64-time difference during the study period. The MIC90 of cefpirome, cefepime, and flomoxef against H. influenzae also yearly tended to rise. The present results demonstrated that CZOP had maintained the antibacterial activity against almost Gram-negative strains tested. However, the decrease in antibacterial activities of CZOP against B. cepacia, and H. influenzae was suggested.
TI  - Contemporary re-evaluation of the activity and spectrum of grepafloxacin tested against isolates in the United States.
AB  - Grepafloxacin potency and spectrum of activity were re-evaluated against contemporary pathogens collected from clinical infections in 2001-2002. A total of 995 isolates were tested for grepafloxacin by the reference agar dilution method and these results were compared to those of 25 other antimicrobial agents. Grepafloxacin activity remained comparable to that of ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and gatifloxacin against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae (MIC(90), 0.03-2 microg/ml; 0.0-7.7% resistance rates). For Pseudomonas aeruginosa, grepafloxacin was active against ciprofloxacin-susceptible (MIC(90), 2 microg/ml), but not against ciprofloxacin-resistant (MIC(90), >8 microg/ml) isolates. Against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, grepafloxacin susceptibility rate was 91.4%, equal to that of levofloxacin. None of the fluoroquinolones showed reasonable activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococci. Gatifloxacin and grepafloxacin had the same MIC(90) against beta-hemolytic streptococci (0.25 microg/ml) and penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae (0.25 microg/ml). Grepafloxacin and other fluoroquinolone activities were not influenced by penicillin resistance in S. pneumoniae. Grepafloxacin was very active against Haemophilus influenzae (MIC(90), 0.03 microg/ml), Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC(90), 0.03 microg/ml) and Legionella spp. (MIC(90), 0.5 microg/ml). These results on recently isolated organisms indicate that grepafloxacin has a sustained potency and spectrum against most clinically important and indicated pathogens.
TI  - Levofloxacin pharmacokinetics in ESRD and removal by the cellulose acetate high performance-210 hemodialyzer.
AB  - BACKGROUND: No published data are available describing the pharmacokinetics of intravenous levofloxacin in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Objectives of this study are to determine the pharmacokinetics and dialytic clearance of levofloxacin and develop dosing strategies in these patients. METHODS: Eight noninfected subjects receiving long-term thrice-weekly hemodialysis, with no measurable residual renal function, were administered intravenous levofloxacin, 250 mg, over 1 hour after a scheduled hemodialysis session. Blood samples were collected serially during the interdialytic period, during the next intradialytic period, and immediately after the next hemodialysis session. Serum concentrations of levofloxacin were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. Differential equations describing a 2-compartment open-infusion pharmacokinetic model were fit to each individual subject's serum concentration-time data by iterative nonlinear weighted least-squares regression analysis using Adapt II (Biomedical Simulations Resource, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA). Ratios of maximum serum concentration (C(max)) to minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) were calculated for common respiratory pathogens by using MIC for 90% of isolates (MIC90) data from published studies. RESULTS: All subjects completed the study, and no adverse events were reported. Median systemic clearance, volume of distribution at steady state, elimination half-life, and C(max) were 37.0 mL/min (range, 12.8 to 42.7 mL/min), 103.3 L (range, 39.8 to 139.3 L), 34.4 hours (range, 28.4 to 39.3 hours), and 5.2 microg/mL (range, 4.1 to 11.3 microg/mL), respectively. Median dialytic clearance and levofloxacin reduction ratios were 84.4 mL/min (range, 61.8 to 107.6 mL/min) and 0.244 (range, 0.181 to 0.412), respectively. Median C(max)-MIC90 ratios were 10 or greater for Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Enterobacter cloacae, and Klebsiella pneumoniae, approximately 5 for Streptococcus pneumoniae, and less than 1 for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. CONCLUSION: The administration of levofloxacin to patients with ESRD as 500 mg initially, followed by 250 mg every 48 hours, will provide adequate C(max)-MIC ratios after the first and subsequent doses for most patients with respiratory tract infections caused by organisms with levofloxacin MICs of 1 microg/mL or less.
TI  - [Surveillance on drug resistance of gram-negative bacilli isolated from hospital  acquired infections and community acquired infections (2000 - 2001)].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the resistance rates of gram-negative bacilli isolated from patients with hospital acquired infections (HAI) or community acquired infections (CAI) in the 34 study wards of 13 hospitals located at different areas in China. METHODS: 1596 strains of gram-negative bacilli from the 2401 pathogenic strains isolated from 13 hospitals 1 July 2000 to 30 June 2001 were collected for susceptibility test using international standard two-fold agar dilution method. According to the criteria of guidelines of NCCLS (2001), MIC(50) and MIC(90) were detected for antibacterial activity of antimicrobial agents and R%, I%, and S%, were calculated to show the resistant, intermediate and susceptible rates of bacteria to the compounds tested. RESULTS: 15 species of gram-negative pathogens were isolated and most of them could be isolated from both CAI and HAI patients. The resistance rates of isolates, especially Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia spp. and Acinetobacter spp. from HAI were higher than those of CAI. The carbopenems were the most active compounds tested against Enterobacteriaceae. Cefoperozone/sulbactam and cefprime demonstrated excellent activity against most of Gram-negative bacilli. Most of the Gram-negative bacilli were still rather susceptible to cefatazidime, a third generation cephalosporin, with a susceptibility rate of 70% to 100%. Fluoroquinolones showed strong and broad-spectrum activity against Gram-negative bacilli, but more than 50% of Escherichia coli strains were resistant to fluoroquinolones, and the susceptible rates to fluoroquinolones of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Haemophilus influenzae had decreased. CONCLUSION: (1) The results obtained in the two surveillance-years, 2000 - 2001 and 1998 - 1999, were similar in the bacterial resistance pattern and the trend of rising of resistant rates for some Gram-negative pathogens. (2) The resistance rates of isolates from HAI patients were higher than those of CAI.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of three fluoroquinolones against clinical isolates by E test.
AB  - The in vitro susceptibility of levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin against several gram-positive and gram-negative clinical isolates was tested by E test. We found that the MIC(50) and MIC(90) values against all members of the Enterobacteriaceae family except Serratia were <0.5 mg/l for ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin (MIC range 0.006-32 mg/l) based on the in vitro susceptibility data. The susceptibility rates for ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin were more than 85% for Escherichia coli, citrobacter, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes and Klebsiella pneumoniae, although Serratia and Acinetobacter exhibited more or less similar susceptibility rates (about 80%). Pseudomonas aeruginosa demonstrated significant resistance to fluoroquinolones (MIC(90) >32 mg/l) and decreased bactericidal rates (<65%) to levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. Respiratory pathogens such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae were highly susceptible (100%) to levofloxacin and moxifloxacin. The ineffectiveness of fluoroquinolones for treating coagulase-positive Staphylococcus aureus was demonstrated by poor in vitro susceptibility rates with levofloxacin (52%) and moxifloxacin (57%). Coagulase-negative staphylococci demonstrated significantly decreased bactericidal rates to levofloxacin (21%), while the in vitro susceptibility to moxifloxacin was higher (66%) than that to levofloxacin. We propose that the beneficial effect of inclusion of any of these three fluoroquinolones in treating Enterococcus infections is marginal, as demonstrated by significantly reduced susceptibility rates (<32%). These data demonstrate the utility of fluoroquinoles to treat several gram-negative bacterial infections (with the exception of Acinetobacter and P. aeruginosa), as well as S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae.
TI  - [Antimicrobial susceptibility and beta-lactamase productivity of recent clinical  isolates during the period between December 1999 and February 2000].
AB  - Antimicrobial susceptibility testings of 24 antimicrobial agents against 605 clinical strains belonging to 10 species were carried out according to the micro-broth dilution method of NCCLS M7-A4. The productivity of beta-lactamase was also determined against them isolated at 8 medical facilities in Nagano prefecture, Japan during the period between December 1999 and February 2000. When applied the nitrocefin method, beta-lactamase productivity was demonstrated to be positive for 89.2% of 74 S. aureus, 4.3% of 94 H. influenzae, and 100% of 69 M. (B.) catarrhalis isolates. On the other hand, when used the acidometry method, penicillinase/cephalosporinase were found to be positive for 21.2%/9.6% of 52 E. coli, 29.0%/3.2% of 31 K. pneumoniae, 53.2%/100% of 47 E. cloacae, 0%/11.1% of 99 S. marcescens, and 25.9%/55.6% of 54 P. aeruginosa isolates, respectively. Among the beta-lactamase-producers including P. aeruginosa isolates, only 2 E. coli isolates were found to be ESBL-producers. Besides, 9.6% (9/94) of H. influenzae isolates were proved to be BLNAR strains.
TI  - [Antimicrobial susceptibility and prevalence of beta-lactamase producing clinical isolates in southern Kyushu. The results of collaborative study from 1999 to 2000].
AB  - The positivity of beta-lactamase and antimicrobial susceptibility were determined in a total of 1,358 clinical isolates at 15 hospitals and clinics in four prefectures in southern Kyushu (Okinawa, Miyazaki, Kagoshima and Kumamoto) during the period from December 1999 to February 2000. The isolates collected comprised of 176 strains of S. aureus, 203 of H. influenzae, 102 of M. catarrhalis, 206 of E. coli, 153 of K. pneumoniae, 99 of E. cloacae, 95 of S. marcescens, 201 of P. aeruginosa, 79 of E. faecalis, and 44 of E. faecium. The frequency of CPDX resistance among E. coli in particular varied geographically, and was found to be higher in Kumamoto and Kagoshima. The strains of K. pneumoniae and E. cloacae resistant to common antimicrobial agents were particularly found in Kagoshima, and one strain of IPM-resistant E. cloacae was isolated in Miyazaki. Also, the geographical difference in the frequency of LVFX resistance among the isolates of E. cloacae was noted, the results indicating the higher prevalence in Okinawa and Kagoshima. Resistant isolates of P. aeruginosa were less common in Kagoshima, and four isolates of P. aeruginosa from Miyazaki were found to be resistant to CAZ and IPM. None of the isolates of S. aureus and Enterococcus spp. was resistant to VCM or TEIC at all. The isolates of E. faecalis resistant at high-level GM (500 micrograms/ml) and SM (1,000 micrograms/ml) were found in 27.8% and 22.8%, and those of E. faecium were 6.8% and 38.6%, respectively. Overall, the ratio of MRSA among S. aureus was 67.6%, and three isolates were resistant to ABK with no less than 8 micrograms/ml of MIC. The frequency of BLNAR (beta-lactamase-negative, ampicillin resistant) among H. influenzae isolated in Okinawa was markedly higher (isolation ratio, 37.9%) when compared with other prefectures, and the isolates of BLPACR (beta-lactamase-positive, AMPC/CVA resistant) were found only in Okinawa with a ratio of 41.6%. A total of 18 strains of ESBL defined by the NCCLS criteria (M100-S11) were isolated, eight strains of K. pneumoniae and 10 strains of E. coli. Of 18 isolates of ESBL, 13 were from Kagoshima and the remaining five were from Kumamoto.
TI  - [Drug sensitivity and beta-lactamase producibility of various types of bacteria clinically isolated during the period from December 1999 to February 2000].
AB  - beta-Lactamase activity and drug sensitivity were measured in 744 strains from 8  species of bacteria isolated at medical institutions in Chikugo District of Fukuoka Prefecture during the period from December 1999 to February 2000. Nitrocefin test revealed that beta-lactamase was positive in 48% of S. aureus, 7% of H. influenzae, and 92% of M. catarrhalis, and acidometry revealed that penicillinase/cephalosporinase were positive in 13%/14% of E. coli, 22%/8% of K. pneumoniae, 47%/97% of E. cloacae, 3%/65% of S. marcescens, and 10%/36% of P. aeruginosa. Based on the assessment of the MIC values of various types of antibacterial drugs for beta-lactamase-producing strains, there were 11 strains (1 strain of K. pneumonia, 6 strains of E. cloacae, and 4 strains of P. aeruginosa) of class-B beta-lactamase-producing bacteria out of a total of 496 strains of Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The results of PCR analysis suggested that 1 strain of K. pneumonia, 1 strain of E. cloacae, and 4 strains of P. aeruginosa produced metallo-beta-lactamase. There was no strain (E. coli and K. pneumoniae) of ESBL-producing bacteria. BLNAR strains, on the other hand, were found in 9% (9/100) of H. influenzae.
TI  - [Beta-lactamase activity and susceptibilities to antibiotics among some species of bacteria isolated from medical institution between December 1999 and February 2000].
AB  - We studied the beta-lactamase activity and susceptibilities to antibiotics in 604 strains among 10 species of bacteria isolated from 10 medical institutions in Tottori and Shimane Prefectures between December 1999 and February 2000. beta-Lactamase activity was measured by the nitrocefin test and penicillinase/cephalosporinase activities were measured by acidometry. beta-Lactamase activity was detected in 72.1% of S. aureus, 18.8% of H. influenzae, and 96.3% of M. catarrhalis. Penicillinase/cephalosporinase activities were detected in 17.8%/22.2% of E. coli, 9.7%/0.0% of K. pneumoniae, 18.6%/95.3% of E. cloacae, 12.7%/79.4% of S. marcescens, and 7.1%/31.8% of P. aeruginosa. Three of 72 strains (4.2%) of K. pneumoniae and 5 of 90 strains (5.6%) of E. coli were assessed as ESBL-producing bacteria using the NCCLS proposed screening method based on routine susceptibility testing results. BLNAR were detected in 13 of 69 strains (18.8%) of H. influenzae.
TI  - [Antimicrobial susceptibility and beta-lactamase types among clinical isolates during January and February 2000 in the Kinki area of Japan].
AB  - We studied antimicrobial susceptibility and beta-lactamase types among clinical isolates in the Kinki area of Japan. Eight hundreds isolates of eight organisms were collected by seven medical institutions during January and February 2000. The rates of beta-lactamase producing by using the chromogenic nitrocephin test were 68.0% against Staphylococcus aureus isolates, 6.0% against Haemophilus influenzae isolates, 98.0% against Moraxella catarrhalis isolates. The rate of beta-lactamase negative ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae was 4.0% (4 out of 100). The result of beta-lactamase producing by using the acid-metric method were as follows the penicillinase and cephalosporinase: 27.0% and 37.0% against Escherichia coli isolates, 37.0% and 1.0% against Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates, 21.8% and 100% against Enterobacter cloacae isolates, 24.2% and 96.0% against Serratia marcescens isolates, 7.0% and 22.0% against Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates. We identified beta-lactamase type of each isolate detected by polymerase chain reaction: SHV-derived extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBLs) (1 isolate of E. coli and 1 isolate of K. pneumoniae), CTX-M-1-derived ESBLs (1 isolate of K. pneumoniae, 1 of E. cloacae and 4 of S. marcescens), and IMP-1-derived metallo beta-lactamases (2 isolates of S. marcescens).
TI  - [Antimicrobial susceptibility and beta-lactamase producibility of bacteria clinically isolated during the period from December 1999 to February 2000].
AB  - Antimicrobial susceptibility and beta-lactamase producibility were tested in 848  clinical strains collected at 8 hospitals in Kanagawa prefecture during the period from December 1999 to February 2000. Positive rates of beta-lactamase used the nitrocefin method (Cefinase) were 21.9% of Staphylococcus aureus, 10.0% of Haemophilus influenzae, and 99.0% of Moraxella catarrhalis. Furthermore, on the acidometric method (P/Case test) penicillinase (PCase), cephalosporinase (CEPase), and both of PCase and CEPase were found to be positive in 19.0%, 16.0%, and 16.0% for Escherichia coli, 6.2/0/3.1% for Klebsiella pneumoniae, 0/66.3/26.5% for Enterobacter cloacae, 2.8/57.7/15.5% for Serratia marcescens, and 4.0/15.0/22.0% for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, respectively. Based on the assessment of minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of antibacterial agents among beta-lactamase producing strains, there were 5 strains (4 strains of K. pneumoniae and 1 strain of E. coli) that may be ESBLs producing bacteria out of a total of 466 strains of Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa. During this process, 1 strain of class-B beta-lactamase-producing E. cloacae was isolated. MRSA were found in 79.2% of S. aureus, and BLNAR were found in 8.9% of H. influenzae.
TI  - [beta-lactamase-producing activity and antimicrobial susceptibility of major pathogenic bacteria isolated from clinical samples. Japan beta-lactamase Research Group].
AB  - beta-Lactamase production and susceptibility to an assortment of antimicrobial agents were examined in 9,483 strains of organisms isolated from clinical materials obtained from inpatients and outpatients at 104 institutions throughout Japan from December 1999 to February 2000. The organisms were Staphylococcus aureus, 1,369 strains, including 847 methicillin-resistant (MRSA) strains; Enterococcus faecalis, 735 strains; Enterococcus faecium, 302 strains; Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, 730 strains; Haemophilus influenzae, 1,142 strains; Escherichia coli, 1,276 strains; Klebsiella pneumoniae, 1,058 strains; Enterobacter cloacae, 772 strains; Serratia marcescens, 847 strains; and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 1,252 strains. The 23 antimicrobial agents used were ampicillin, sulbactam/ampicillin, clavulanic acid/amoxicillin, oxacillin, piperacillin, cefazolin, cefotiam, cefmetazole, cefoperazone, sulbactam/cefoperazone, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, cefepime, cefpodoxime, imipenem, gentamicin, arbekacin, clarithromycin, minocycline, chloramphenicol, vancomycin, teicoplanin, and levofloxacin. Antimicrobial agents appropriate for each organism were used. Among S. aureus strains, 61.9% were MRSA, and 62.3% were positive for beta-lactamase. Among the MRSA strains, none was resistant to vancomycin or teicoplanin, and only 3% were resistant to arbekacin. There was no vancomycin resistance in the Enterococcus strains. Only 0.1% of E. faecalis strains were ampicillin-resistant. Among the M. catarrhalis strains, 97.5% produced beta-lactamase, while among the H. influenzae strains, 8.5% produced beta-lactamase and 14.5% were beta-lactamase-negative and ampicillin-resistant (BLNAR). Among the Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa strains, there were 20 (E. coli; 7/1,276, K. pneumoniae; 13/1,058) that produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs), and 11 that produced class B beta-lactamases. Multiple drug resistance was advanced in every species, and organisms resistant to 7 or more common antimicrobial agents were isolated. The best combination of antimicrobial agent and beta-lactamase inhibitor was sulbactam/cefoperazone. Sulbactam/cefoperazone, cefepime, and imipenem still have excellent antimicrobial activity. Rates of resistance to each antimicrobial agent differed more among institutions than among geographical regions.
TI  - Evaluation of a novel automated chemiluminescent assay system for antimicrobial susceptibility testing.
AB  - The newly developed Rapid Lumi Eiken/IS60 (RL/IS60) system automatically determines MICs by detecting chemiluminescence produced in the reaction of a chemiluminescent probe and oxygen metabolites from living microorganisms. The present study evaluated this system for accuracy in antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Chemiluminescence intensities after 4 h of cultivation of clinically important strains were plotted against various concentrations of antimicrobial agents, which resulted in curves reflecting the levels of susceptibility. Sixty-percent inhibitory concentrations based on the susceptibility curves agreed with MICs determined by the reference microdilution method. When the MICs of antimicrobial agents for four quality control (QC) strains (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) were determined by the RL/IS60 system, most (91.1%) of them were within the QC limits proposed by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards. The system was further assessed for a total of 162 clinical isolates, including E. coli, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, P. aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, S. aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Overall, there was 90.6% agreement between the RL/IS60 system and the reference microdilution method. Our results suggest that the RL/IS60 system provides rapid and reliable MICs of a variety of antimicrobial agents for clinical isolates as well as QC strains.
TI  - [Yearly changes in antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates between 1996 and 2000--II. Gram-negative bacteria].
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2000 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, and carbapenems. Thirty-two species 2,697 strains of Gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from January to December, and consisted of Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis (n = 125), Escherichia coli (n = 250), Citrobacter freundii (n = 153), Citrobacter koseri (n = 97), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 150), Klebsiella oxytoca (n = 100), Enterobacter aerogenes (n = 50), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 125), Serratia marcescens (n = 153), Proteus mirabillis (n = 103), Proteus vulgaris (n = 77), Morganella morganii (n = 141), Providencia spp. (P. alcalifaciens, P. rettgeri, P. stuartii; n = 154), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 211), Pseudomonas putida (n = 49), Burkholderia cepacia (n = 102), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 101), Haemophilus influenzae (n = 210), Acinetobactor baumannii (n = 63), Acinetobactor Iwoffii (n = 30), Bacteroides fragilis group (B. fragilis, B. vulgatus, B. distasonis, B. ovatus, B. thetaiotaomicron; n = 129), and Prevotella spp. (P. melaninogenica, P. intermedia, P. bivia, P. oralis, P. denticola; n = 124). CZOP possessed stable antibacterial activities against M. (B.) catarrhalis, E. coli, C. freundii, C. koseri, K. pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, E. aerogenes, E. cloacae, S. marcescens, P. mirabilis, P. vulgaris, M. morganii, Providencia spp., P. aeruginosa, and A. lowffii throughout 5 years. The MIC90 of CZOP against those strains were consistent with those obtained from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. On the other hand, the MIC90 of CZOP against H. influenzae yearly obviously increased with approximately 65-time difference during study period. The MIC90 of cefpirome, cefepime, and flomoxef against H. influenzae also yearly tended to rise. The present results demonstrated that CZOP had maintained the antibacterial activity against almost Gram-negative strains tested. However, the decrease in the antibacterial activity of CZOP against H. influenzae was suggested.
TI  - Ceftriaxone activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens isolated in US clinical microbiology laboratories from 1996 to 2000: results from The Surveillance Network (TSN) Database-USA.
AB  - Ceftriaxone was introduced into clinical practice in the USA in 1985 and was the  first extended-spectrum (third-generation) cephalosporin approved for once-daily treatment of patients with Gram-positive or Gram-negative infections. Review of ceftriaxone activity is important given its continued use since the mid-1980s and reports of emerging resistance among all antimicrobial agent classes. We reviewed the activity of ceftriaxone and relevant comparative agents against five Gram-positive and 11 Gram-negative species for a 5-year period, 1996-2000, using data from The Surveillance Network (TSN) Database-USA. All MIC results were interpreted using NCCLS breakpoint criteria. Ceftriaxone resistance among isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae (n=17219) remained essentially unchanged over the 5 years studied and in fact was lower from 1998 to 2000 (5.0-5.1%) than in 1996 (6.3%) and 1997 (6.6%). Ceftriaxone resistance (range, 5.1-6.9%) among viridans group streptococci (n=6621) varied by <2% from 1997 to 2000. Beta-lactam-resistant Streptococcus pyogenes (n=935) and group B beta-haemolytic streptococci (n=2267) were not identified in any year. Among methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (n=39 284) ceftriaxone resistance was 0.1-0.3% per year from 1996 to 2000. Ceftriaxone resistance among Escherichia coli (n=472407; range, 0.2-0.4%), Klebsiella oxytoca (n=16231; range, 3.5-4.8%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=117754; range, 1.9-2.6%), Proteus mirabilis (n=67692; range, 0.2-0.3%), Morganella morganii (n=11251; range, 0.3-2.1%) and Serratia marcescens (n=26519; range, 1.6-3.8%) was low and consistent from 1996 to 2000. Resistance to ceftriaxone among Enterobacter cloacae (n=48114; range, 21.7-23.9%) was relatively high, compared with other Enterobacteriaceae, but unchanged from 1996 to 2000. Rates of resistance to ceftriaxone among Acinetobacter spp. (n=20813) increased from 24.8% in 1996 to 45.1% in 2000. All Haemophilus influenzae (n=7911) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (n=218) were susceptible to ceftriaxone, as were 99.7% of Moraxella catarrhalis (n=312) tested in 1996 and 1997. In summary, ceftriaxone has retained its potent activity against the most commonly encountered Gram-positive and Gram-negative human pathogens despite widespread and ongoing clinical use for more than 15 years.
TI  - [Post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--II. Gram-negative bacteria].
AB  - As a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, monobactams, and carbapenems. Changes in CZOP susceptibility for the bacteria were also evaluated with the bacterial resistance ratio calculated with the breakpoint MIC. Twenty-five species (3,362 strains) of Gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2000, and consisted of Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis (n = 136), Haemophilus influenzae (n = 289), Escherichia coli (n = 276), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 192), Klebsiella oxytoca (n = 157), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 189), Enterobacter aerogenes (n = 93), Serratia marcescens (n = 172), Serratia liquefaciens (n = 24), Citrobacter freundii (n = 177), Citrobacter koseri (n = 70), Proteus mirabilis (n = 113), Proteus vulgaris (n = 89), Morganella morganii (n = 116), Providencia spp. (n = 41), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 290), Pseudomonas fluorescens (n = 56), Pseudomonas putida (n = 63), Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 146), Acinetobacter lwoffii (n = 34), Burkholderia cepacia (n = 101), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 169), Bacteroides fragilis group (n = 196), and Prevotella/Porphyromonas (n = 173). An antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. coli, K. pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, and S. marcescens was potent and consistent with or more preferable than the study results obtained until the new drug application approval. MIC90 of CZOP against M.(B.) catarrhalis, C. koseri, and P. aeruginosa was not considerably changed and consistent with the study results obtained until the new drug application approval. MIC90 of CZOP against E. cloacae, E. aerogenes, and P. mirabilis increased year by year. The increase in MIC90 of CZOP against E. aerogenes and P. mirabilis, however, was not considered to be an obvious decline in susceptibility. In contract, the susceptibility of E. cloacae to CZOP was suspected to be decreasing because this species showed 20.6% resistance to CZOP. MIC90 of CZOP against C. freundii was variably changed or not one-sidedly, but was higher than the values obtained until the new drug application approval. Additionally, MIC90 of CZOP against H. influenzae was stable during 5 years except being higher in 1999, and, as a whole, was a little higher than the values obtained until the new drug application approval. An antibacterial activity of CZOP against P. fluorescens, P. putida, B. cepacia, S. maltophilia, B. fragilis group, and Prevotella/Porphyromonas was weak like the other cephems. Changes in MIC90 of CZOP against the other bacteria were 2 tubes or more through 5-year study period, but did not tend towards a unilateral direction as meaning a decline in susceptibility.
TI  - NB2001, a novel antibacterial agent with broad-spectrum activity and enhanced potency against beta-lactamase-producing strains.
AB  - Enzyme-catalyzed therapeutic activation (ECTA) is a novel prodrug strategy to overcome drug resistance resulting from enzyme overexpression. beta-Lactamase overexpression is a common mechanism of bacterial resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics. We present here the results for one of the beta-lactamase ECTA compounds, NB2001, which consists of the antibacterial agent triclosan in a prodrug form with a cephalosporin scaffold. Unlike conventional beta-lactam antibiotics, where hydrolysis of the beta-lactam ring inactivates the antibiotic, hydrolysis of NB2001 by beta-lactamase releases triclosan. Evidence supporting the proposed mechanism is as follows. (i) NB2001 is a substrate for TEM-1 beta-lactamase, forming triclosan with a second-order rate constant (k(cat)/K(m)) of greater than 77,000 M-1 s-1. (ii) Triclosan is detected in NB2001-treated, beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli but not in E. coli that does not express beta-lactamase. (iii) NB2001 activity against beta-lactamase-producing E. coli is decreased in the presence of the beta-lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid. NB2001 was similar to or more potent than reference antibiotics against clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus (including MRSA), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, Moraxella catarrhalis and Haemophilus influenzae. NB2001 is also active against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Enterobacter cloacae. The results indicate that NB2001 is a potent, broad-spectrum antibacterial agent and demonstrate the potential of ECTA in overcoming beta-lactamase-mediated resistance.
TI  - In-vitro antibacterial activities of cefpiramide and other broad-spectrum antibiotics against 440 clinical isolates in China.
AB  - The in-vitro antibacterial activity of cefpiramide was compared with those of 15  other broad-spectrum cephalosporins. A total of 440 clinical strains of bacteria, including 9 bacterial species, were isolated from our hospital in 1998. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of cefpiramide and five other antibiotics were determined for each species, using the agar-dilution method. The MIC of cefpiramide for Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae was higher than those of three other third-generation cephalosporins, (ie, cefoperazone, ceftazidime, and ceftriaxone). Fifty-one percent (26/51) of Enterobacter cloacae isolates were resistant to cefpiramide. Cefoperazone/sulbactam and cefepime had greater activity against E. cloacae (resistance, 3.9% and 19.6%, respectively) than cefpiramide. Cefpiramide was more active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (resistance rates, 12%) than cefoperazone, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, aztreonam, and cefepime. Cefpiramide-resistant P. aeruginosa strains were resistant to ceftazidime, but 27% of ceftazidime-resistant strains were susceptible to cefpiramide; 15.3% of cefpiramide-resistant S. maltophilia strains were also susceptible to ceftazidime, but 50% of ceftazidime-resistant strains were still susceptible to cefpiramide. Cefoperazone/sulbactam was the most active agent against Acinetobacter baumannii, showing a resistance rate of 2%. Ampicillin/sulbactam, ceftazidime, and cefpiramide were the second most active agents, and about 50% of the tested strains were susceptible to these three antibiotics. Cefpiramide had an activity comparable to that of all tested beta-lactams against oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MIC90, 2 microg/ml). Against Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae, cefpiramide had good activity, with an MIC90 concentration at which 90% of the strain was inhibited of 1 microg/ml and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively. These results indicated that cefpiramide was more active against glucose non-fermenting bacteria than against Enterobacteriaceae, and was very active against oxacillin-susceptible Staphylo-coccus aureus, S. pneumoniae, and H. influenzae. Thus, cefpiramide may be a good choice of drug for the treatment of patients with infections with glucose non-fermenting bacteria and community acquired infections.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity and penetration rate into sputum of gatifloxacin, a novel 6-fluoro-8-methoxy quinolone, and its therapeutic efficacy in respiratory infections.
AB  - The in vitro antimicrobial activity of gatifloxacin against clinical isolates of  pathogenic bacteria was evaluated. Minimum inhibitory concentrations of gatifloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, and rifampicin against 20 strains each of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 18 strains of Enterobacter cloacae, 15 strains each of Streptococcus Pneumoniae and Moraxella catarrhalis, 12 strains of Haemophilus influenzae, 18 strains of Mycobacterium intracellulare, and 22 strains each of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium avium were determined. The minimum inhibitory concentrations90's of gatifloxacin against the above species were 0.12, 8, <==0.06, 0.5, 2, 2, <==0.06, 0.39, 0.05, 0.013, 2, 0.5, and 4 &mgr;g/ml, respectively. Gatifloxacin was four times as active as ofloxacin against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and as active as ofloxacin against Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Gatifloxacin was as active as tosufloxacin and sparfloxacin against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Haemophilus influenzae. The antimycobacterial activity of gatifloxacin was similar to that of sparfloxacin. Five patients with chronic respiratory infections and one patient with acute pneumonia received 100-400 mg/day of gatifloxacin orally for 5-12 days (mean, 8.17 days). The clinical effects were excellent in one patient and good in five. One strain of Haemophilus influenzae was eradicated and one strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa persisted after therapy. Adverse reactions were mild and improved after completion of therapy. In one patient with chronic bronchitis, the maximum sputum concentrations 2-4 h after oral administration of 150 mg of gatifloxacin on days 1 and 6 were 0.88 and 1.45 &mgr;g/ml, respectively, and in serum the values were 0.84 and 1.24 &mgr;g/ml, respectively. Thus it was found that gatifloxacin possesses potent activity against respiratory pathogens (including Mycobacteriaceae), and shows good penetration rate into sputum, and that it can be used as the drug of first choice in the treatment of respiratory tract infections.
TI  - Multi-resistance to antimicrobial agents for the ten most frequently isolated bacterial pathogens.
AB  - Cross-resistance and multi-resistance to selected antibiotics was determined for  Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis. Amikacin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae often showed cross-resistance to ss-lactam antibiotics. Only 1% of the Escherichia coli isolates showed resistance to more than four antibiotics from a set of seven. This rate was higher for other Enterobacteriaceae and there were high levels of cross-resistance for P. aeruginosa. The cross-resistance of oxacillin with other antibiotics is well known in staphylococci. Penicillin-resistant pneumococcal isolates were cross-resistant to macrolides. Cross-resistance was only a minor problem in H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis. Cross- and multi-resistance are important problems for Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria but not for fastidious bacteria with the exception of penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin in a North American surveillance study.
AB  - The in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, was compared to three marketed fluoroquinolones; ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin against over 4,000 recent clinical isolates covering 29 species isolated in the United States and Canada between 1997-1999. Based on MIC(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent fluoroquinolone tested against a majority of Gram-positive isolates: Streptococcus pneumoniae, penicillin resistant S. pneumoniae, macrolide resistant S. pneumoniae, ciprofloxacin non-susceptible (MIC > or = 4 microg/mL) S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, viridans streptococci, Enterococcus faecalis, methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. hemolyticus, and S. saprophyticus. Against Enterobacteriaceae and aerobic non-Enterobacteriaceae Gram-negatives, gemifloxacin was usually comparable to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and more potent than ofloxacin for the following species: Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, E. cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Morganella morganii, Proteus mirabilis, P. vulgaris, Providencia stuartii, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter lwoffii, A. baumannii, Burkholderia cepacia, Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Gemifloxacin was generally 16-64 fold more potent than the other fluoroquinolones tested against Gram-positive organisms and retains excellent activity comparable with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin against a majority of Gram-negative pathogens.
TI  - Use of PCR with universal primers and restriction endonuclease digestions for detection and identification of common bacterial pathogens in cerebrospinal fluid.
AB  - We have designed a universal PCR capable of amplifying a portion of the 16S rRNA  gene of eubacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Legionella pneumophila, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis. The sizes of the amplified products from various bacteria were the same (996 bp), but the restriction patterns of most PCR products generated by HaeIII digestion were different. PCR products from S. aureus and S. epidermidis could not be digested by HaeIII but yielded different patterns when they were digested with MnlI. PCR products from S. pneumoniae, E. faecium, and E. faecalis yielded the same HaeIII digestion pattern but could be differentiated by AluI digestion. PCR products from E. coli, K. pneumoniae, S. marcescens, and E. cloacae also had the same HaeIII digestion pattern but had different patterns when digested with DdeI or BstBI. This universal PCR could detect as few as 10 E. coli or 250 S. aureus organisms. Compared with culture, the sensitivity of this universal PCR for detection and identification of bacteria directly from 150 cerebrospinal fluids was 92.3%. These results suggest that this universal PCR coupled with restriction enzyme analysis can be used to detect and identify bacterial pathogens in clinical specimens.
TI  - In vitro activity of gemifloxacin against a broad range of recent clinical isolates from the USA.
AB  - The antibacterial potencies of gemifloxacin (SB-265805) and 13 comparator compounds were determined by broth microdilution against a panel of 645 Gram-positive and 995 Gram-negative organisms collected from various USA sites. Time-kill studies were performed and postantibiotic effect (PAE) was determined for several organisms using trovafloxacin and ciprofloxacin as comparator compounds. Based on MIC(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent compound tested against Gram-positive isolates: Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC(90) 0. 016 mg/L), Streptococcus agalactiae (0.03 mg/L), Streptococcus pyogenes (0.03 mg/L), viridans streptococci (0.12 mg/L), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (0.03 mg/L), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2 mg/L), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (0. 016 mg/L) and Enterococcus faecalis (2 mg/L). Against Gram-negative isolates, the potency of gemifloxacin was equal to that of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin and generally better than that of ofloxacin, grepafloxacin, trovafloxacin and nalidixic acid. MIC(90)s for gemifloxacin were: Haemophilus influenzae (</=0.008 mg/L), Moraxella catarrhalis (0.008 mg/L), Escherichia coli (0.016 mg/L), Klebsiella pneumoniae (0.25 mg/L), Klebsiella oxytoca (0.25 mg/L), Enterobacter cloacae (1 mg/L), Enterobacter aerogenes (0.25 mg/L), Proteus spp. (4 mg/L), Serratia spp. (1 mg/L), Citrobacter freundii (2 mg/L), Morganella morganii (0.12 mg/L), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8 mg/L), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4 mg/L) and Acinetobacter spp. (32 mg/L). Gemifloxacin was bactericidal for all organisms studied at 2 and 4 x MIC. The PAE for most strains was in the range 0.7-2.5 h at 2 and 4 x MIC, although longer PAEs were observed with H. influenzae, P. aeruginosa and Proteus vulgaris (>6 h at 4 x MIC) and shorter PAEs with E. faecalis (0.1-0.6 h) and K. pneumoniae (0.1-0.2 h). In conclusion, gemifloxacin is a novel quinolone with a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity. It has substantially improved potency against Gram-positive organisms, especially streptococci, for which gemifloxacin is generally at least eight- to 16-fold more potent than other quinolones tested. It retains the good Gram-negative activity seen with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and shows good bactericidal activity and prolonged PAEs.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of gatifloxacin against 873 clinical isolates from respiratory tract, urinary tract and surgical infections during 1997-1998 in Japan.
AB  - The in vitro activity of gatifloxacin was determined for 873 isolates from various infections during 1997-1998 in Japan. Gatifloxacin was active against streptococci, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, with MIC(90)s of </=0.39 mg/L. The activity was two- to 32-fold greater than that of ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin against Gram-positive bacteria, and comparable to that against Gram-negative bacteria. Gatifloxacin was more active than the other quinolones against quinolone-resistant staphylococci, Enterococcus faecalis, E. coli and Enterobacter cloacae. It also had good activity against penicillin- or macrolide-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae and ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae.
TI  - The nose as bacterial reservoir: important differences between the vestibule and  cavity.
AB  - The difference between the spectra of potential bacterial pathogens (PBPs) in the nasal vestibule and cavity has not been taken into account in clinical studies. PURPOSE: Since one can anticipate different flora in different kinds of mucosae, the authors compared bacterial species in the vestibule with those of the cavity. SUBJECTS AND METHOD: A total of 534 healthy male clerical workers in a downtown Lucerne office building were examined with fractionated swabs. RESULTS: PBPs, notably Staphylococcus aureus, were found in 412 subjects and surprisingly, differences in flora of the two sites were noted in 130 of them: PBPs were observed in the vestibule and not in the cavity in 85 of the subjects, and in 45 of them, the reverse was true. CONCLUSION: The practical implications of these findings are considerable regarding infection control in patients at increased infection risk.
TI  - [In vitro activity of biapenem (BIPM) against clinically isolated respiratory pathogens in 1996-1998].
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activity of biapenem (BIPM), a new carbapenem antibiotic, was compared with those of imipenem (IPM), panipenem (PAPM), meropenem (MEPM), ceftazidime (CAZ) and piperacillin (PIPC) against 280 isolates of 9 respiratory pathogens. The MIC90s of biapenem (BIPM) for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Haemophilus influenzae were 0.12, 32, 0.25, 0.06, 4 and 8 micrograms/ml, respectively. In comparison with other antibiotics, the activity of biapenem (BIPM) for P. aeruginosa was as potent as meropenem (MEPM), but for H. influenzae it was slightly less than those of other antibiotics, and for other respiratory pathogens it was as potent as those of other antibiotics. The MIC90s of biapenem (BIPM) for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae and Serratia marcescens were 0.06, 1, 1, 0.5 microgram/ml, respectively, and which were equal to or somewhat lower than those of other antibiotics. Biapenem (BIPM) showed strong activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens, especially P. aeruginosa in general. Based on these results, biapenem (BIPM) is seemed to be highly useful antibiotic for the treatment of respiratory infections with several organism.
TI  - Etiology of serious infections in young Gambian infants.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite improvements in infant mortality rates in many developing countries including The Gambia, neonatal mortality remains high and many neonatal deaths are caused by infection. The study described in this paper was conducted to determine the bacterial and viral etiology of serious infections in Gambian infants younger than 91 days old. METHODS: At a first level health facility 497 infants with symptoms that could indicate serious infection were enrolled, of whom 239 with 1 or more signs of serious infection and 55 with no signs were investigated, yielding 17 cases with positive bacterial cultures of blood and/or cerebrospinal fluid. At a nearby pediatric referral hospital 198 infants were seen and 182 were investigated, yielding 35 positive bacterial cultures. RESULTS: There were 15 culture positive cases of meningitis caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae (7), Streptococcus pyogenes (2), Enterobacter cloacae (2), Escherichia coli (1), Haemophilus influenzae type b (1), Streptococcus agalactiae (1) and Salmonella spp. (1). Six of these children died. Thirty-three infants without meningitis had positive blood cultures for Staphylococcus aureus (17), S. pneumoniae (3), Salmonella spp. (5), E. coli (3), other enterobacteria (4) and S. agalactiae (1), of whom 14 died. Nasopharyngeal aspirates from 438 children were investigated for common respiratory viruses. Respiratory syncytial virus was found in 51, influenza A in 46, influenza B in 22, parainfluenza in 26 and adenovirus in 16. Respiratory syncytial virus and influenza A isolates were found most frequently toward the end of the wet season. Nasopharyngeal carriage of S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae was studied in 320 infants recruited during the first year. Of these 184 (58%) were positive for S. pneumoniae and 141 (44%) were positive for H. influenzae, 18 of which were type b. Infants with a bacterial isolate from blood or cerebrospinal fluid were more likely than the rest to die, whereas those with a viral isolate were less likely to die. CONCLUSIONS: The most important causes of serious infections in young Gambian infants are Staphylococcus aureus, S. pneumoniae and Salmonella spp.
TI  - [A consideration on the results of nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibilities--gram-negative bacilli].
AB  - The results of the semi-annual nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibilities, conducted by the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare during the period of January 1993 to July 1995, were analyzed for typical Gram-negative bacilli in the purpose of provision of an index for antimicrobial selection. During these 3 years, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes and Proteus mirabilis showed slightly increasing tendency in susceptibility to fosfomycin (FOM) and Citrobacter freundii. Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter aerogenes showed slightly increasing tendency to minocycline (MINO). While Haemophilus influenzae and Haemophilus parainfluenzae showed slightly decreasing tendency to cefmetazole (CMZ). However, these annual changes were almost negligible. Generally, these microorganisms showed relatively good susceptibilities, every year, to the principal antimicrobial agents being approved for use against Gram-negative bacilli. However, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa showed tendencies of decreased susceptibility to some of the antimicrobial agents. On the other hand, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (ST), CMZ, latamoxef (LMOX), gentamicin (GM) and amikacin (AMK) showed good activities against some of the Gram-negative bacilli to which no indications are approved. In conclusion, bedside the identification of the causative microorganisms and the performance of antimicrobial susceptibility testing, such analyses (graphics of susceptibility tendency of clinical isolates to variety of antimicrobial agents) could be used as an index for selection of antimicrobial agents, when emergent and urgent selection of antimicrobial agents is necessary.
TI  - In vitro activity of meropenem against common pathogenic bacteria isolated in Taiwan.
AB  - The in vitro antimicrobial activity of meropenem, in comparison with nine other antimicrobial agents, against 12 different common pathogenic bacteria were evaluated to know the susceptibility of common bacteria to meropenem in Taiwan. Meropenem was active against most Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and anaerobic bacteria, including methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia cepacia, Acinetobacter baumannii, Haemophilus influenzae, and Bacteroides fragilis. For many of them, meropenem was the most active one in comparison with other broad-spectrum cephalosporins, aztreonam, imipenem, and ciprofloxacin. It is concluded that meropenem is a very active agent against most common pathogenic bacteria. It is uncommon for these common bacteria, except MRSA and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, to be resistant to meropenem in Taiwan, where a high prevalence of resistance to other antimicrobial agents was found in many of the common bacteria.
TI  - [A national multicenter study of the in-vitro activity of piperacillin-tazobactam. The Spanish Piperacillin-Tazobactam Group].
AB  - The action of piperacillin-tazobactam on 4,137 of the 4,364 strains collected in  a Spanish multicenter study involving 46 participating hospitals was studied. The samples were from the following: 41% urine, 18% exuded from wound abscesses, 13% respiratory, 9% blood, 3% peritoneal liquid, and the remainder from other various sources. The gram-negative bacteria included 2,778 strains from 13 genera: Escherichia (1,289), Pseudomonas (451), Proteus (230), Klebsiella (203), Haemophilus (172), Enterobacter (145), Acinetobacter (88), Salmonella (60), Bacteroides (57), Morganella (53), Serratia (46), Citrobacter (46), Stenotrophonomas (23) and Moraxella (21). The gram-positive bacteria were S. aureus (316), E. faecalis (239), S. epidermis (130), S. pneumoniae (115) and Clostridium spp. (12). The global susceptibility of the gram-negatives to piperacillin-tazobactam was 94%: E. coli 98%, P. aeruginosa 92%, and P. mirabilis, Morganella, K. pneumoniae, Serratia and Salmonella spp. all greater than 94%. The susceptibility of other bacteria was as follows: 91% Citrobacter, 77% E. cloacae, 42% A. baumannii, 61% S. maltophilia, 97% E. faecalis, 93% S. epidermidis, 100% M. catarrhalis, 99% H. influenzae and 100% anaerobic bacteria. The action on S. pneumoniae and S. aureus varied according to the susceptibility or lack there of to penicillin or methicillin. In comparison to other antibiotics (piperacillin, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, cefepime, imipenem and ciprofloxacin), piperacillin-tazobactam was far better than piperacillin alone and better or similar to the others.
TI  - Sparfloxacin vs ofloxacin in the treatment of acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis: a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, comparative study. Sparfloxacin Multicenter ABECB Study Group.
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: Comparison of efficacy and safety of sparfloxacin vs ofloxacin for treatment of acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (ABECB). DESIGN: Multicenter, double-blind, randomized study. SETTING: Sixty-eight private offices and outpatient clinics in the United States and Canada. PATIENTS: Seven hundred ninety-eight adults with ABECB, as confirmed by the acute onset of new (or worsened from the immediate premorbid state) cough and sputum production. INTERVENTIONS: Randomization 1:1 to sparfloxacin, 400 mg on day 1, then 200 mg once daily, or ofloxacin, 400 mg twice daily, with matching comparator placebos, given concurrently for 10 consecutive days. RESULTS: The primary efficacy parameter was overall response in the bacteriologically evaluable population. Overall success rates in this population were 85.3% and 89.3% for sparfloxacin and ofloxacin, respectively. The two-sided 95% confidence interval was -9.9, 1.9, indicating that sparfloxacin was statistically equivalent to ofloxacin. The all-treated population analysis was similar to that in the evaluable population. Bacterial eradication rates were similar in both treatment groups for Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, and Staphylococcus aureus. The frequency of adverse events overall was comparable in the two treatment groups. The sparfloxacin group had a lower frequency of digestive and nervous system adverse events, but a higher frequency of photosensitivity reactions than the ofloxacin group. CONCLUSIONS: Once-daily oral treatment with 200 mg sparfloxacin (after initial 400 mg dose) is as effective as twice-daily treatment with 400 mg ofloxacin in patients with ABECB.
TI  - Comparison of in vitro activity of trovafloxacin against gram-positive and gram-negative organisms with quinolones and beta-lactam antimicrobial agents.
AB  - The in vitro activity of trovafloxacin against 721 Gram-negative and 498 Gram-positive organisms was determined by the standard microdilution broth method using commercially prepared frozen microtiter plates. The activity of trovafloxacin was compared to ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, ampicillin/sulbactam (1:1), piperacillin/tazobactam, ceftriaxone, and imipenem. Trovafloxacin had equal or greater activity compared with the other agents tested against Citrobacter diversus, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Serratia marcescens, staphylococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus viridans, group G streptococci, Enterococcus faecalis, and E. faecium. The reliability of the commercially prepared plates for testing the in vitro activity of the quinolones was evaluated by comparing identical isolates also tested by broth microdilution using laboratory prepared plates. The commercially prepared plates generally correlated, within one- to twofold dilutions, with the laboratory prepared plates. There was, however, a large discrepancy obtained when testing Enterobacter agglomerans and E. cloacae, where the commercially prepared plates yielded a significantly higher MIC90 value.
TI  - [Survey of the sensitivities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents (annual report)].
AB  - Research groups were formed in 21 institutions nationwide to investigate carbapenem resistance. The activities of various antibacterial agents, principally carbapenems were tested against clinical isolates collected from these institutions. The broth microdilution method was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of 17 antibacterial agents for 1,282 strains of 11 bacterial species isolated at all institutions between October and December 1995. The results were as follows: 1. Carbapenems exhibited strong antibacterial activities against MSSA and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Their activities against Enterococcus faecalis were comparable to that of ABPC. Carbapenems showed low activities against MRSA. 2. OFLX exhibited the greatest antibacterial activity against Haemophilus influenzae, followed by MEPM. The antibacterial activities of the other carbapenems were comparable to those of FMOX and CTM. 3. The carbapenems showed high activities against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, and Bacteroides fragilis group. Their activities were greater than that exhibited by other beta-lactam antibacterial agents. The carbapenems also exhibited greater antibacterial activities against Serratia marcescens than the other beta-lactam antibacterial agents, but some resistant strains were detected. 4. The antibacterial activities of carbapenems against Pseudomonas aeruginosa were comparable to those of CAZ, AZT, AMK.
TI  - [In vitro antibacterial activities of cefteram and other beta-lactam agents against recent clinical isolates].
AB  - In vitro antibacterial activity of the third-generation oral cephem cefteram (CFTM)--ten years after its first use in the clinical setting--against recent clinical isolates was evaluated and compared with those of other oral cephems. A total of 851 clinical isolates belonging to 13 species used in this study were collected from five medical institutions across Japan during 1996. CFTM showed excellent antibacterial activity against methicillin-susceptible S. aureus and S. pyogenes, equivalent to those of other third-generation oral cephems, except cefixime. Of the S. pneumoniae strains, a high proportion, 34.1%, were penicillin-resistant strains (PRSP), with MIC values of 2.0 micrograms/ml or above, but the MIC50 of CFTM against PRSP was 1.0 microgram/ml. CFTM and the other third-generation oral cephems showed potent antibacterial activity against E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and P. mirabilis. A few strains of E. coli, however, were highly resistant to third-generation oral cephems; that might include extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing strains. MIC values against P. vulgaris varied significantly, depending on whether they were determined by the broth micro-dilution method or the agar dilution method; growth was observed at high concentrations in the broth micro-dilution method, in which the skip phenomenon was demonstrated, but not in the agar dilution method. The reason for this discrepancy is unknown. Most strains of S. marcescens, C. freundii, and E. cloacae demonstrated resistance to CFTM and the other third-generation oral cephems. CFTM and the other third-generation oral cephems showed excellent antibacterial activities against M. (B.) catarrhalis, N. gonorrhoeae, and H. influenzae, including ampicillin-resistant strains.
TI  - [Meropenem: microbiologic perspective].
AB  - Meropenem is a beta-lactamic carbapenem derived from thienamycin and is structurally characterized by the presence of a beta-methyl group in position C1 which confers stability to the molecule versus renal dehydropeptidase 1 (DHP-1), thereby making the coadministration of an enzyme inhibitor unnecessary. Its esterochemical configuration of the lateral chain in C2 (dimethyl carbomoilpyrrolidenethium) increases the activity versus gram negative bacteria (enterobacteria and pseudomonas) and moreover, may explain the reduction in the proconvulsive effect observed in imipenem/cilastatin. Meropenem has great bactericide power and has a very wide spectrum of activity depending on it low molecular weight and zwiterionic structure, stability versus almost all the clinically important beta-lactamases and high affinity for the PBPs. It covers gram positive aerobes (Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococci, streptococci including Streptococcus pneumoniae resistant to penicillin, Enterococcus faecalis, Rhodococcus equi, Listeria monocytogenes) and gram negative bacteria (enterobacteria, P. aeruginosa, Acinetobacter, Aeromonas, Plesiomonas, Vibrio, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria, Moraxella) and anaerobes (Bacteroides, Prevotella, Porphyromonas, Fusobacterium, Clostridium, Peptostreptococcus, and Propionibacterium acnes), being more active than imipenem versus gram negatives: P. aeruginosa (2-4-fold), enterobacteria (2-32-fold) and H. influenzae (4-8-fold) and less active versus the gram positives (enterococci, streptococci and staphylococci). Meropenem has no activity on Enterococcus faecium, S. aureus resistant to methycillin, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and other genera producers of chromosomic methalo-beta-lactamases (carbapenemases). Resistance may be due to impermeability given the loss of the OprD porin (OprD2 in enterobacteria and P. aeruginosa) loss of different membrane proteins (Proteus mirabilis, Proteus rettgeri, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes), modifications of the PBPs (gram positive) and the production of carbapenemases (chromosomic methalo-beta-lactamases).
TI  - In-vitro activities of ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, lomefloxacin, ofloxacin, pefloxacin, sparfloxacin and trovafloxacin against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens from respiratory tract infections.
AB  - Trovafloxacin, sparfloxacin, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin were equally active against Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Legionella pneumophila, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae and Serratia marcescens. Ciprofloxacin was the most active compound against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90 = 1 mg/L), followed by trovafloxacin (MIC90 = 4 mg/L). Trovafloxacin was twice as active as sparfloxacin against Streptococcus pyogenes (MIC90 = 0.12 mg/L), Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC90 = 0.12 mg/L) and Staphylococcus aureus (MIC90 = 0.06 mg/L) (except quinolone-resistant, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, for which the MIC90 was 8 mg/L). Trovafloxacin was the most active compound against Enterococcus faecalis: 80% of strains were susceptible to 0.25 mg/L. There was complete cross-resistance between all fluoroquinolones.
TI  - [Survey of sensitivities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents (annual report)].
AB  - Research groups were formed in 20 institutions nationwide to investigate carbapenem resistance of clinical isolates. Activities of various antibacterial agents, principally carbapenems, were tested against clinical isolates collected from these institutions. The broth microdilution method was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 17 antibacterial agents for 1,326 strains of 11 bacterial species isolated at the institutions between October and December 1994. The results are as follows: 1. Carbapenems exhibited strong antibacterial activities against MSSA and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Their activities against Enterococcus faecalis were comparable to that of ABPC. Carbapenems showed low activities against MRSA. 2. OFLX exhibited the greatest antibacterial activity against Haemophilus influenzae, followed by MEPM. Antibacterial activities of the other carbapenems were comparable to those of FMOX, CTM, and ABPC. 3. The carbapenems showed high activities against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, and Bacteroides fragilis group. Their activities were greater than those exhibited by other beta-lactam antibacterial agents. The carbapenems also exhibited stronger antibacterial activities against Serratia marcescens than the other beta-lactam antibacterial agents, but some resistant strains were detected. 4. The antibacterial activities of carbapenems against Pseudomonas aeruginosa were comparable to those of CAZ, AZT, AMK.

TI  - In vitro activity of cefpirome against microorganisms isolated in haematology, oncology and intensive care units in Switzerland.
AB  - The in vitro activity of cefpirome, a new parenteral fourth-generation cephalosporin, was investigated in the 5 university hospitals of Switzerland, and compared to 9 other antibiotics mainly used in hospitals, such as ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, piperacillin, imipenem, gentamicin, vancomycin, ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. A total number of 992 strains collected only from intensive care units and haematology-oncology units were tested by microdilution according to NCCLS. Cefpirome showed an excellent activity against all Enterobacteriaceae (MIC90 = 4 mg/l), methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (MIC90 = 1 mg/l), Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC90 = 0.25 mg/l) and Haemophilus influenzae (MIC90 = 0.12 mg/l) isolates. Its activity was superior to that of third-generation cephalosporins against cephalosporinase-depressed mutants of Enterobacter cloacae and Citrobacter freundii isolates (MIC90 > 32 mg/l for third-generation cephalosporins vs 4 mg/l for cefpirome). The MICs of cefpirome of 3 strains of Klebsiella spp. with an extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase were lower (MIC90 = 2 mg/l) than those of third-generation cephalosporins (MICs90 > 32 mg/l). Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa cefpirome was as active as ceftazidime. The activity of cefpirome was poor against methicillin-resistant staphylococci, enterococci and nosocomial Gram-negative bacteria such as Stenotrophomonas maltophilia.
TI  - Neonatal airway colonization with gram-negative bacilli: association with severity of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Airway colonization with Gram-negative bacilli (GNB) and Gram-positive cocci (GPC) is common in mechanically ventilated neonates. Whether GNB are related to nosocomial bloodstream infection (BSI) and/or to the severity of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is unknown. METHODS: We prospectively examine this relationship using a cohort design. Data from 260 < or = 1250-g birth weight inborn infants (1991 to 1995) intubated > or = 2 weeks included 917 serial tracheal cultures and 583 blood cultures. The severity of BPD was assessed by duration of mechanical ventilation, oxygen dependency at 36 weeks of postconceptional age and the use of home oxygen supplementation. RESULTS: After 2 weeks of ventilation, 80% of the infants were colonized with GPC (Staphylococus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus in 90% of the cases). Superimposed on 36% of these infants was GNB airway colonization with Klebsiella pneumoniae (25%), Enterobacter cloacae (25%), Escherichia coli (25%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10%), Serratia marcescen (10%), Acinetobacter baumannii and Haemophilus influenzae (5%). Comparison between 174 GPC- and 86 GNB-colonized infants showed that demographics, birth weight, gestational age, perinatal risk factors and mortality were similar. Fifteen percent of GNB-colonized infants developed BSI caused by GNB and 14% developed BSI caused by GPC. No significant temporal relationship between airway colonization and BSI was noted. GNB infants were ventilated longer and required oxygen at 36 weeks of postconceptional age and home oxygen supplementation twice as often as infants colonized only with GPC. GNB colonization was a predictor of severe BPD after controlling for ventilation. Ureaplasma colonization occurred in 28% of GNB-colonized and 33% of noncolonized infants and was not a predictor of BPD severity. CONCLUSION: GNB airway colonization creates a moderate risk for BSI. Antibiotic treatment does not regularly eradicate GNB. GNB airway colonization is associated with severe BPD, but further studies will be necessary before therapeutic efforts to eradicate GNB from the airways should be undertaken.
TI  - [In vitro antibacterial activity of a new parenteral penem, sulopenem].
AB  - Eighty percent minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC80) of sulopenem against clinically isolated 12 to 80 strains of each of different bacteria were as follows: methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA): 0.20 micrograms/ml, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA): 50 micrograms/ml, coagulase-negative staphylococci: 3.13 micrograms/ml, Streptococcus pyogenes: < or = 0.013 microgram/ml, Streptococcus pneumoniae: < or = 0.013 microgram/ml, beta-streptococci: 0.05 microgram/ml, Enterococcus faecalis: 12.5 micrograms/ml, Enterococcus faecium: > 100 micrograms/ml, Escherichia coli CS2(R+): 0.10 microgram/ml, Klebsiella pneumoniae: 0.05 microgram/ml, Proteus mirabilis: 0.10 microgram/ml, Proteus vulgaris: 0.20 microgram/ml, Morganella morganii: 0.39 micrograms/ml, Providencia rettgeri: 3.13 micrograms/ml, Citrobacter freundii: 0.20 microgram/ml, Enterobacter cloacae: 0.39 microgram/ml, Serratia marcescens: 1.56 micrograms/ml, Pseudomonas aeruginosa: 50 micrograms/ml, Pseudomonas cepacia: 3.13 micrograms/ml, Xanthomonas maltophilia: > 100 micrograms/ml, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus: 1.56 micrograms/ml, ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae: 0.39 microgram/ml and Bacteroides fragil is: 0.20 microgram/ml, respectively. Sulopenem possesses a stronger activity than flomoxef or cefuzonam against Gram-positive bacteria, the strongest activity among the antibiotics tested against Gram-negative bacteria except P. aeruginosa. Sulopenem has stronger affinities than imipenem to all fractions of PBPs of S. aureus, E. coli, P. vulgaris, S. marcescens, even of P. aeruginosa. Affinities of sulopenem to PBPs-1 and -3 of S. aureus, PBP-2 of E. coli were much stronger than those of imipenem (IPM). Sulopenem generally has small Ki values to all types of beta-lactamases and also has stronger permanent inactivation effect to Ia and IIb types of beta-lactamases than IPM. No synergistic bactericidal activity of sulopenem was apparent with serum complement. However, synergism of sulopenem with macrophages was prominent in bactericidal activity. The cells of E. coli were well phagocytosed and rapidly digested by cultured macrophages in the presence of a higher than 1/8 MIC of sulopenem. Moreover, sulopenem was more stable than imipenem against swine and human dehydropeptidase-Is. Sulopenem is one of the antibiotics that do not induce the appearance of subclones resistant to the drug.
TI  - Comparative evaluation of orally active antibiotics against community-acquired pathogens: results of eight European countries.
AB  - In this multicenter study conducted in eight European countries, 13,173 pathogens--all isolated from community-acquired infections in 1992 and 1993--were evaluated for their susceptibility to the following orally active antibiotics: penicillin G, ampicillin, amoxycillin plus clavulanic acid, cefaclor, cefuroxime, cefetamet, doxycycline and erythromycin. Ten centers in Italy, five in Germany, in the Netherlands and Switzerland, four in Greece and Spain, three in Hungary and one in Finland contributed to this study; ready-to-use standardized microtiter panels (Sceptor system, BBL, Heidelberg, Germany) were used throughout all assays. The most frequently encountered species were: Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and non-typhoid Salmonella spp., Enterobacter cloacae, Streptococcus agalactiae, Haemophilus influenzae, Citrobacter freundii, Staphylococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Moraxella catarrhalis and Shigella spp. The percentage of susceptible isolates was assessed for each of the above-mentioned countries and European-wide with all the data available. For many species, the percentage of resistant isolates did not differ markedly between the countries considered. However, one of the most striking exceptions was the high prevalence of high-level penicillin-G-resistant S. pneumoniae isolates in Hungary and Spain; some of the low-level penicillin-G-resistant strains remained susceptible to cefuroxime, whereas complete cross-resistance occurred for all other beta-lactams studied. The high frequency of ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae isolates in Spain deserves mentioning; this could be attributed mainly to the prevalence of a beta-lactamase, as the addition of clavulanic acid rendered these strains susceptible to ampicillin. The penicillin compounds exhibited the greatest activity against Gram-positive pathogens, whereas cefetamet was the most active agent against Gram-negative pathogens with a well-balanced spectrum of activity.
TI  - [Pathogenic bacteria isolated from the sputum of the patients with pulmonary emphysema].
AB  - Isolated pathogenic bacteria from sputum of the patients with pulmonary emphysema who were admitted in our hospital from 1984 to 1994 were examined to elucidate the relationship between isolated bacteria from sputum and pulmonary functions including vital capacity (VC), forced expiratory volume (FEV1.0), PaO2 and PaCO2. VC of the patients from whom MSSA (methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus) or Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis) were isolated was significantly lower than that of the patients from whom Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae), Branhamella catarrhalis (B. catarrhalis) or Haemophilus influenza (H. influenza) were isolated. FEV1.0 had a similar tendency as VC in terms of isolated organisms from the patients with emphysema. Similarly, PO2 of the patients from whom MSSA or E. cloacae were isolated was significantly lower than that of the patients from whom S. pneumoniae, B. catarrhalis or H. influenzae were isolated, and PCO2 of the patients from whom S. pneumoniae, B. catarrhalis or H. influenza were isolated. There was also impaired respiratory function in the patients from whom MSSA, Escherichia coli (E. coli), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa), Xanthomonas maltophilia (X. maltophilia) or Enterobacter cloacae (E. cloacae) were isolated, compared with those in the patients from whom S. pneumonia, B. catarrhalis or H. influenzae were isolated. These results suggest that isolated pathogenic bacteria are shifted from S. pneumoniae, B. catarrhalis or H. influenza to MSSA, E. coli, P. aeruginosa, X. maltophilia or E. cloacae in the course of impairment of respiratory function in pulmonary emphysema. The treatment and prophylaxis for acute exacerbation in pulmonary emphysema should be based on these results.
TI  - Bacterial pneumonia in recipients of bone marrow transplantation. A five-year prospective study.
AB  - Bacterial pneumonia as an important complication of bone marrow transplantation (BMT) has not been subjected to comprehensive analysis. Two hundred fifty-five consecutive allogeneic and autologous BMT recipients, ranging in age from 1 month to 53 years, were prospectively followed for 3 days to 3 years (median, 108 days) for development of bacterial pneumonia. Etiology, place acquired, chest radiography, and outcome were recorded and the association between bacterial pneumonia and demographic and clinical variables was analyzed. Thirty-seven (15%) patients experienced 52 episodes of bacterial pneumonia: onset of 13 episodes occurred within 30 days after transplantation, 10 episodes occurred on days +31 to +100, and 29 episodes occurred thereafter. Bacterial pneumonia was the terminal event or contributed to fatal outcome in 8 patients (22% of bacterial pneumonia cases, 3% total study population). Mortality due to hospital-acquired pneumonia (6/21) was significantly higher than (P = 0.03). Bacterial pathogens were identified in 27 (52%) episodes. During the first 100 days after BMT, hospital-acquired Gram-negative bacteria predominated, caused mainly by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter lwoffi, and Enterobacter cloacae. After day +100, community-acquired, Gram-positive bacteria predominated, particularly Streptococcus pneumoniae. Haemophilus influenzae occurred periodically. Considering all episodes, significant association was found between bacterial pneumonia and veno-occlusive disease (VOD) (P < 0.01) and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (P < 0.02). For culture-positive episodes, the association between bacterial pneumonia and VOD was significant (P < 0.001) and borderline for acute GVHD (P = 0.07). It is concluded that VOD and GVHD are positively associated with post-BMT bacterial pneumonia. Its incidence, etiology, risk factors, and outcome are important considerations in its prevention and treatment.
TI  - Activation of human endothelial cells by viable or heat-killed gram-negative bacteria requires soluble CD14.
AB  - In response to bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS; endotoxin), endothelial cells  are converted to an activation phenotype expressing both proinflammatory and procoagulant properties that include the induction of leukocyte adhesion molecules and tissue factor expression. LPS-induced endothelial cell activation requires a soluble form of the monocyte LPS receptor, sCD14. We evaluated the capacity of multiple strains of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria to induce endothelial E-selectin and tissue factor expression through sCD14-dependent pathways with cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVE). Both viable and heat-killed gram-negative bacteria (Bacteroides fragilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Klebsiella pneumoniae) but not viable or heat-killed gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae) induced prominent E-selectin surface expression detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Tissue factor activity on HUVE, indicated by factor X activation, was induced in response to gram-negative bacteria but not in response to gram-positive bacteria. Gram-negative bacteria induced transcriptional activation in HUVE, indicated by the appearance of E-selectin-specific mRNA and by the demonstration of activation of NF-kappa B, a trans-activating factor necessary for E-selectin and tissue factor gene transcription. In contrast, neither E-selectin mRNA nor activation of NF-kappa B was detected in HUVE treated with gram-positive bacteria. Endothelial cell activation by gram-negative bacteria in each of these assays was inhibited with a monoclonal antibody (60bd) against CD14. Furthermore, CHO-K1 cells, transfected with human recombinant CD14, responded to all strains of gram-negative bacteria (viable or heat killed), indicated by CHO-K1 NF-kappa B activation. We conclude that gram-negative bacteria induce endothelial cell activation through a common sCD14-dependent pathway.
TI  - Ceftibuten: a review of antimicrobial activity, spectrum and other microbiologic  features.
AB  - Ceftibuten is a new, orally administered cephalosporin with exceptional beta-lactamase stability and potency against commonly isolated Gram-negative pathogens. More than 90% of recent Enterobacteriaceae clinical isolates were inhibited by < or = 8 micrograms/ml of ceftibuten. In only five enteric species (Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Morganella morganii, Serratia marcescens) were more than 15% of strains resistant (minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC, with percent of strains inhibited in subscript numbers) > 16 micrograms/ml) to ceftibuten. Enteritis-producing bacteria such as Salmonella, Shigella, Escherichia coli and Yersinia were very ceftibuten-susceptible (MIC50 < or = 0.13 microgram/ml). Fastidious Gram-negative species causing respiratory tract or genital infections had very low ceftibuten MICs, including beta-lactamase-positive Haemophilus influenzae (MIC90 0.06 to 2 micrograms/ml), Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC90 0.25 to 4 micrograms/ml), and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (MIC90 0.015 to 0.5 microgram/ml). Beta-hemolytic streptococci and penicillin-susceptible pneumococci were also inhibited by ceftibuten. Staphylococci, enterococci, Pseudomonas species and Gram-negative anaerobic bacteria were generally resistant to ceftibuten. Ceftibuten has demonstrated bactericidal activity against susceptible pathogens, has high affinity for several lethal penicillin-binding proteins and possesses stability to common plasmid- or chromosomal-mediated beta-lactamases, including those enzymes that hydrolyze parenteral third generation cephalosporins. The microbiologic features for ceftibuten indicate its clinical potential as chemotherapy for community-acquired respiratory tract infections.
TI  - Comparative antimicrobial activities of the penem WY-49605 (SUN5555) against recent clinical isolates from five U.S. medical centers.
AB  - The in vitro activity of WY-49605 (SUN5555) (WY) was compared with those of cefaclor, cefixime, and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid against 2,958 consecutive clinical isolates from five medical centers and 402 respiratory pathogens from 18 other facilities. Most members of the family Enterobacteriaceae were inhibited by WY (MIC at which 50% of the isolates are inhibited [MIC50], < or = 2.0 micrograms/ml). MIC90s of > or = 8.0 micrograms/ml were observed for Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia spp., and Proteus mirabilis. WY was the most active drug against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MIC90, 0.12 microgram/ml) and other coagulase-negative staphylococci (MIC90, 4.0 micrograms/ml). The four drugs were not active against nonenteric gram-negative bacilli, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus haemolyticus. At 2.0 micrograms/ml, WY inhibited 82% of Enterococcus faecalis strains and was equal to or superior to the other drugs against streptococci, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis.
TI  - [Nationwide survey on susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents in 1991].
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical isolates to  different antibacterial agents at 123 hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1991. In this study, identifications and susceptibility testings were carried out at each hospital laboratory. The susceptibility testing were performed using the disk dilution method recommended by NCCLS. Staphylococcus aureus and CNS showed high or moderate resistance rates to methicillin (DMPPC). Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Proteus mirabilis were highly susceptible to many agents including beta-lactam antibiotics. Though Enterococcus faecalis was highly susceptible to ampicillin (ABPC), piperacillin (PIPC), imipenem (IPM), sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (ST) compounds, Enterococcus faecium was resistant to almost all antibacterial agents but to ST compounds. High susceptibility rates were observed for strains of Enterobacter cloacae to IPM, gentamicin (GM) and ofloxacin (OFLX) and for strains of Proteus vulgaris to latamoxef (LMOX), IPM, aztreonam (AZT), GM and OFLX. Serratia marcescens and Bacteroides fragilis group were highly susceptible only to IPM. Pseudomonas aeruginosa were sensitive to ceftazidime (CAZ), IPM, amikacin (AMK) and tobramycin (TOB). Pseudomonas cepacia was relatively susceptible only to CAZ. IPM showed strong antibacterial activity to many species except for S. aureus and CNS.
TI  - Comparative evaluation of orally active antibiotics against community-acquired pathogens: a multi-center study in five Mediterranean countries.
AB  - In 5 Mediterranean countries 7902 pathogens, all isolated in 1992 and 1993 from community-acquired infections, were studied for susceptibility to the following orally active antibiotics: penicillin G, ampicillin, ampicillin + sulbactam, amoxycillin + clavulanic acid (both 2:1 ratio), cefalexin, cefaclor, cefuroxime, cefetamet, doxycycline and erythromycin. Ten centers in Italy, 4 centers in Greece, 3 centers in Spain, and 1 center in Lebanon and Saudi Arabia contributed to this study; all centers used performed standardized microtiter panels (Sceptor, BBL, Heidelberg, FRG). The most frequently isolated pathogens were Escherichia coli (n = 1267), Proteus mirabilis (n = 843), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 771), enteric Salmonella spp. (n = 629), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 486), Citrobacter freundii (n = 383), Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 346), Haemophilus influenzae (n = 298), Streptococcus pyogenes (n = 294), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 246), Klebsiella oxytoca (n = 243), and Shigella spp. (n = 185). Statistical analysis was performed for each of the above countries and for all pooled data available. The penicillin antibiotics were the most active compounds against the gram-positive cocci, exceeding the MIC90 values 2- to 8-fold over all cephalosporins. Regarding the gram-negatives (above all Klebsiella spp.) cefetamet was by far the most active compound (MIC90 = 1 mg/l). Regarding the percentage of resistant isolates, there were no striking discrepancies between the centers and countries involved in this study. There was, however, complete cross-resistance in penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae isolates (MIC90 = 2 mg/l). By far the majority of the penicillin-resistant pneumococci showed additional resistance to doxycycline and erythromycin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Bacterial resistance to carbapenems.
AB  - The carbapenems have the broadest spectra of all beta-lactams but resistance still occurs, caused by target modification, impermeability or beta-lactamase production. Target modification or replacement is important in methicillin-resistant staphylococci, E. faecium and some pneumococci. These organisms present the greatest current threat to carbapenem efficacy. Impermeability to carbapenems arises in P. aeruginosa mutants, where it is contingent on loss of D2 outer membrane protein, a minor porin. This resistance functions only if the Pseudomonas retains its chromosomal group 1 beta-lactamase, and so reflects the interplay of impermeability and hydrolysis rather than impermeability alone; nevertheless porin loss is the critical change that engenders resistance. Resistance based on impermeability coupled to a group 1 beta-lactamase has also been described in E. cloacae, but demands loss of a major porin and is much rarer and less stable than in P. aeruginosa. Although group 1 beta-lactamases contribute to resistance in these organisms, they have only feeble carbapenemase activity. Chromosomal beta-lactamases with potent carbapenemase activity occur in most or all X. maltophilia, A. hydrophila and F. odoratum isolates. These enzymes, which cause carbapenem resistance when expressed copiously, are all zinc-dependent. Zinc carbapenemases also are a concern in B. fragilis, where they are encoded by the chromosomal DNA of c. 3% of isolates, though expressed by only 1%. Carbapenemases are extremely rare outside these species. Nevertheless, a plasmidic zinc carbapenemase was reported from one P. aeruginosa isolate and from several S. marcescens. Further carbapenemases, some not zinc-dependent, are known from a tiny numbers of Serratia, Enterobacter, and Acinetobacter isolates. Despite these various modes of resistance, carbapenems have retained their efficacy far better than have expanded-spectrum cephalosporins. Whether this advantage will be retained indefinitely is uncertain. If resistance does become more prevalent it may be possible to derivatize the carbapenems so as to extend their activity. There is already interest in the design of carbapenems that bind beta-lactam-resistant PBPs and, to an extent, in the development of carbapenemase inhibitors.
TI  - [Bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies of SY5555 dry syrup in the pediatric field].
AB  - Bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies on SY5555 dry syrup (powder which is dissolved before use), a new penem antibiotic for oral use, were performed. The following results were obtained. 1. Antibacterial activities. MICs of SY5555, clavulanic acid/amoxicillin (CVA/AMPC), cefotiam (CTM), cefpodoxime (CPDX), cefaclor (CCL) and cefdinir (CFDN) were determined against clinically isolated Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae at a dose of 10(6) CFU/ml. MICs of SY5555 against S. aureus, CNS, S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, E. coli and E. cloacae were 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, < or = 0.025, 0.78, 0.2, 0.78 and 3.13 micrograms/ml, respectively, showing excellent antibacterial effects on these pathogens. Although the effects of SY 5555 against H. influenzae and E. coli were slightly inferior to those of CPDX and CFDN, the drug showed the most excellent antibacterial effect on other strains as compared with the control drugs. 2. Absorption and excretion In this study, plasma concentrations and urinary recovery rates were examined after administration of SY5555 at doses of 5 and 10 mg/kg (potency) after meals. With both 5 and 10 mg/kg doses, peak plasma concentrations were reached 1 hour after administration, at 0.25-2.61 micrograms/ml (mean 1.47 micrograms/ml) and 1.08-2.17 micrograms/ml (mean 1.74 micrograms/ml), respectively. The plasma levels rapidly decreased to 0.06-0.19 micrograms/ml (0.12 micrograms/ml) and 0.0503-0.0637 micrograms/ml) after 6 hours. The half-lives 1.12 hours in the 5 mg/kg group and 1.0 hour in the 10 mg/kg group. The urinary recovery rates were determined in the first 8 hours after administration in the 5 mg/kg and 6 hours in the 10 mg/kg group, and the values were as low as 1.05-12.3% and 1.6-4.33%, respectively. 3. Clinical results The clinical responses were examined in a total of 73 cases including 4 acute pneumonia, 13 acute bronchitis, 11 tonsillitis, 3 pharyngitis, 12 scarlet fever, 2 pertussis, 6 urinary tract infection, 6 otitis media, 7 lymphadenitis, 2 staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome, 2 phlegmon, 4 impetigo and 1 purulent parotitis. The treatment was effective or better in 66 of 70 cases with an efficacy rate of 94.3% (3 undeterminable cases were excluded). Bacteriological effects were examined during the clinical course for detected or suspected pathogens found before administration of SY5555. The effects were determined in 50 cases including 7 cases of polymicrobacterial infections, 57 strains in total. Eight strains, however, persisted, hence the overall eradication rate was 86.0%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Synthesis and in vitro antibacterial activities of 3-thiazol-4-yl-1-carba-1-dethiacephalosporins.
AB  - The synthesis and microbiological evaluation of a new series of 3-thiazol-4-yl-carba-1-dethiacephalosporins is described. Structure activity relationship was achieved by changing substitution at the 2-position of the thiazole moiety. The result was a marked variance of microbiological activity in the C7 side-chain derivatives. ATMO derivatives possess potent activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. For example, MICs (microgram/ml) of LY215226 against representative organisms are as follows: S. aureus 0.25, S. pneumoniae 0.008, H. influenzae 0.008, E. coli 0.25, K. pneumoniae 0.008, E. cloacae 0.5, S. typhi 0.25, and M. morganii 0.25.
TI  - Cefquinome (HR 111V). In vitro evaluation of a broad-spectrum cephalosporin indicated for infections in animals.
AB  - Cefquinome (formerly HR 111V), an aminothiazolyl cephalosporin, was compared with cefepime, cefpirome, cefotaxime, and ceftazidime against 681 clinical cultures and a challenge set of bacteria with well-characterized resistance mechanisms. Cefquinome minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC90) for the enterobacteriaceae ranged from < or = 0.12-2 micrograms/ml with the highest MIC (4 micrograms/ml) obtained among Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, and Providencia stuartii strains. A total of 90% of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa were inhibited by cefquinome at < or = 8 micrograms/ml. Cefquinome activity of particular note for Gram-positive isolates included Corynebacterium jeikeium (MIC90, 8 micrograms/ml) and enterococci (MIC50, 4-8 micrograms/ml). Oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was 32-fold less susceptible (MIC90, 16 micrograms/ml) to cefquinome than oxacillin-susceptible (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) strains. Cefquinome was very potent against fastidious isolates such as Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC90, 0.25-2 micrograms/ml); Haemophilus influenzae (MIC90, 0.06-1 micrograms/ml), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (MIC90, 0.06-0.5 micrograms/ml), and Streptococcus species (MIC90, < or = 0.03-006 micrograms/ml). When tested against organisms possessing Bush group 2 enzymes (including extended spectrum beta-lactamases), cefquinome remained active (MIC, < or = 8 micrograms/ml) against the majority of strains. This compound should be very active against pathogens generally found in animal infections and possesses a potency and spectrum comparable to the "fourth-generation" cephalosporins (cefepime and cefpirome) being investigated for human infectious diseases.
TI  - In vitro activity of cefpodoxime in comparison with other oral beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  - The aim of our study was to re-evaluate the in vitro activity of cefpodoxime in comparison with other oral beta-lactam antibiotics against bacteria causing respiratory tract infections. The study drugs were cefpodoxime, cefaclor, cefixime, cefuroxime, cefetamet, cefprozil, and the combination of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid (= augmentin). In addition, cefotaxime as the standard agent of parenteral third generation cephalosporins was examined. The organisms tested were Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, streptococci of serogroups C and G, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae and Proteus mirabilis. Minimal inhibitory concentrations of the antimicrobials were determined with the agar dilution procedure. Cefpodoxime showed the broadest spectrum and generally also the highest activity of the oral beta-lactam antibiotics examined. The drug was equally active against the major groups of beta-lactamase negative and positive bacteria causing respiratory tract infections. Against penicillin-resistant pneumococci, all beta-lactam agents exhibited reduced activity comparable to the reduced activity of penicillin.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity and beta-lactamase stability of SY5555, a new oral penem antibiotic.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of SY5555, a new oral penem antibiotic, was compared with those of cefaclor, cefixime, and cefteram. SY5555 was more active than the comparison agents against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Morganella morganii, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Clostridium spp., and Bacteroides fragilis. Against Providencia spp., Proteus spp., and Haemophilus influenzae, SY5555 was less active than cefixime or cefteram. SY5555 was inactive against methicillin-resistant S. aureus. Enterococcus faecium, Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Xanthomonas maltophilia, as were the comparison agents. The bactericidal activities of SY5555, cefixime, and cefteram were at or slightly greater than the MICs for clinical isolates of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. SY5555 was not hydrolyzed by various types of beta-lactamases. However, SY5555 and the comparison agents were hydrolyzed by X. maltophilia (L-1) and P. aeruginosa/pMS354 beta-lactamases, two Bush group 3 beta-lactamases, SY5555 showed a high affinity, as did cefixime and cefteram, for cephalosporinases from C. freundii GN7391 and E. cloacae GN7471 strains. These results suggest that SY5555 may be more specific than existing beta-lactam antibiotics.
TI  - The pattern of respiratory infection in patients with lung cancer.
AB  - We examined retrospectively the pattern of respiratory infection in 579 patients  with lung cancer admitted to Nagasaki University Hospital during the past 15 years. A total of 139 patients (24.0%) developed respiratory infection. The rates of pulmonary infection associated with large (36.2%) and small cell carcinomas (33.6%) were significantly higher than those with squamous cell carcinoma (26.0%) and adenocarcinoma (17.3%). Advanced stages of lung cancer were associated with higher complication rates (stage I: 6.3%, stage II: 15.9%, stage III: 27.9%, and stage IV: 33.8%). Deceased patients showed a significantly higher rate of pulmonary infection than alive patients during the period of investigation. Isolated organisms in excess of 10(7) cfu/ml in sputum or 10(4) cfu/ml in bronchial aspirate were mainly gram-negative bacteria (68.8%), such as Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Acinetobacter sp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The number of patients infected with gram-positive bacteria increased markedly after 1982. Our results suggest that a successful control of pulmonary infection associated with lung cancer is important in improving the prognosis of lung malignancy.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of FK037, a new parenteral cephalosporin.
AB  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of FK037, a new parenteral cephalosporin, were compared with those of cefpirome, ceftazidime and flomoxef. The advantages of in vitro activity of FK037 were as follows: (1) a broad-spectrum antibacterial activity, (2) the most potent activity (MIC90: 25 micrograms/ml) of the cephalosporins tested against highly methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (H-MRSA), (3) a strong activity against Enterobacter spp. and Citrobacter freundii resistant to the third-generation cephalosporins tested. The MICs of FK037 for 90% of the clinical isolates tested (MIC90s) were 0.012 microgram/ml for Streptococcus pyogenes, 0.05 microgram/ml for Escherichia coli, 0.1 microgram/ml for Streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.2 microgram/ml for Haemophilus influenzae and Proteus mirabilis, 0.39 microgram/ml for Klebsiella pneumoniae, 1.56 micrograms/ml for methicillin-sensitive S. aureus, Proteus vulgaris and Enterobacter aerogenes, 3.13 micrograms/ml for Staphylococcus epidermidis and Moraxella catarrhalis, 6.25 micrograms/ml for C. freundii, 12.5 micrograms/ml for low-level methicillin-resistant S. aureus (L-MRSA), Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 25 micrograms/ml for H-MRSA and Serratia marcescens. FK037 was similar in potency to cefpirome against strains except MRSA, and was superior to ceftazidime and flomoxef against strains except P. vulgaris and/or M. catarrhalis. The increase in MICs of FK037 against 2 L-MRSA strains (2- or 4-fold) was smaller than that of cefpirome and flomoxef (16- to 64-fold) after the third serial culture in the presence of each drug. FK037 was highly bactericidal against S. aureus, E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa at the MIC or higher. FK037 had a potent protective activity against murine experimental systemic infections due to a wide variety of bacteria. Its protective activity was the strongest among the cephalosporins tested against H-MRSA and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. Against the other strains, FK037 was as effective as cefpirome and similar or superior to flomoxef and ceftazidime though it was inferior to ceftazidime against P. aeruginosa. Transmission electron microscopic studies revealed that FK037 inhibited septum formation and induced thick cross walls and bacteriolysis at the division sites in MRSA after 4 h incubation.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of aztreonam against clinical isolates].
AB  - To evaluate the antibacterial activity of a monobactam antibiotic, aztreonam (AZT), MICs of AZT and other antibiotics against clinical isolates collected at 36 participating institutions after January 1992 were determined using the agar plate dilution method (size of inoculum, 10(6) cfu/ml) according to the Japan Society of Chemotherapy standard. The antibiotics that were tested along with AZT included piperacillin (PIPC), cefoperazone (CPZ), and amikacin (AMK). AZT was found to be more active against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, and Providencia rettgeri than CPZ, PIPC, and AMK. AZT was also more active against Serratia marcescens than the other antibiotics, but about 6% of the strains tested were resistant to AZT with MIC of 12.5 micrograms/ml. Against Enterobacter cloacae and Citrobacter freundii, however, was more active AMK than AZT. AZT showed a normal activity distribution with a single peak at the MIC of 3.13-6.25 micrograms/ml against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 35% of inoculum was resistant with high MIC values (MIC > or = 25 micrograms/ml). Activities of AZT against Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae were comparable to those of CPZ.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of bacterial isolates in south Sweden including a 13-year follow-up study of some respiratory tract pathogens.
AB  - The antibiotic susceptibility of consecutive isolates of the upper respiratory tract pathogens Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis, and Staphylococcus aureus, (100 strains of each species collected each year during March through April 1985, 1988 and 1992) to penicillin V, amoxycillin, cefaclor, cefuroxime, doxycycline, erythromycin, and cotrimoxazole was investigated by MIC determination on PDM and PDM II agar. The MICs of the upper respiratory isolates from 1992 supplemented with 100 isolates each of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis and Staphylococcus saprophyticus collected during 1992 were determined against the above antibiotics plus cefadroxil, cefpodoxime, roxithromycin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and BAY Y 3118. Beta-lactamase production was found in 10% of H. influenzae and 80-90% of S. aureus and B. catarrhalis in 1992. Among H. influenzae isolates, non-beta-lactamase-induced resistance to all beta-lactam antibiotics was first detected in 1988 and amounted to 3% of isolates in 1992. Decreased susceptibility of S. preumoniae to penicillin (> or = 0.12 mg/l), co-trimoxazole > or = 32 mg/l, doxycycline (> or = 2 ml/l) and erythromycin (> or = 1 mg/l) was detected in 11%, 7%, and 8%, respectively, in 1992, which is significantly higher than in previous years at the same laboratory. Decreased susceptibility of S. pyogenes to doxycycline and erythromycin was detected in 11% and 9% in 1992. The two most recently developed antibiotics, cefpodoxime and BAY Y 3118, showed high antibacterial activity. The study emphasizes the need to screen for resistance mechanisms such as beta-lactamase production and lowered penicillin affinity.
TI  - Low-dosage cefepime as treatment for serious bacterial infections.
AB  - Since infection develops in significant numbers of hospitalized patients, the problem of resistance to third-generation cephalosporins is of increasing concern. We evaluated the efficacy of cefepime 1 g bd as treatment for acute, moderately severe bacterial infection in 239 hospitalized patients (mean age 60 years). Of these patients, 204 were evaluated clinically for urinary tract infection (UTI) (n = 90), lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) (n = 70), skin and soft tissue infection (S/STI) (n = 12) and bacteraemia which was associated with either UTI or LRTI (n = 32) but not included in the previously mentioned UTI and LRTI groups. Amongst the pathogens isolated (36 Gram-positive, 150 Gram-negative), the most predominant species were Escherichia coli in UTI and bacteraemia (n = 81), Streptococcus pneumoniae in LRTI and bacteraemia (n = 23), Haemophilus influenzae in LRTI (n = 16), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 4) and Enterobacter cloacae (n = 2) in S/STI. The mean duration of treatment was 8.5 days and was the same for the 204 clinically evaluable patients. Overall, the clinical cure rate for cefepime was 94% (191/204). Pathogen eradication was achieved in 93% (185/199) of infections. Of the patients with associated bacteraemia, the clinical cure rate was 97% (31/32) and 94% (16/17) of the pathogens were eradicated. Cefepime therapy was well-tolerated. Treatment was discontinued in eight patients (3%) because of local intolerance and in five patients (2%) because of drug-related adverse events (rash, headache and pruritus). Cefepime 1 g bd is as safe and effective as other parenteral cephalosporins for the treatment of acute bacterial UTI, LRTI and S/STI, including those cases with associated bacteraemia. The bd dosing schedule and reported lack of cross-resistance with other cephalosporins against some species of aerobic Gram-negative bacilli make cefepime an attractive treatment option in hospitalized patients.
TI  - The North American component (the United States and Canada) of an International Comparative MIC trial monitoring ofloxacin resistance.
AB  - Common lots of reference MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration) method reagents were used to monitor ofloxacin, a newer fluoroquinolone, and 13 other drugs against 3200 recent clinical isolates in February-April 1992. Five medical centers in the United States and Canada contributed 640 strains per facility as follows: Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Klebsiella spp., and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (100 strains each); Streptococcus pneumoniae (40 strains); and Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Salmonella spp., Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis (20 strains each). Quality-control strains were processed concurrently, MICs recorded, and data processed at a common location. Selected ofloxacin-resistant isolates were retested at a reference laboratory to confirm resistances and determine cross-resistant patterns. Results indicate the following (a) fluoroquinolones were superior in usable spectrum of activity to other orally administered drugs (for example, cefaclor, cefixime, ampicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, minocycline, oxacillin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole); (b) ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin were generally equal to gentamicin and cefotaxime against commonly isolated Gram-negative pathogens; (c) fluoroquinolone resistance was rare among enteric bacilli, pneumococci (ciprofloxacin > ofloxacin), H. influenzae, and M. catarrhalis, but more common among oxacillin-resistant staphylococci and P. aeruginosa; (d) cross resistance was generally observed between ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin but was species or genus dependent; and (e) a new fluoroquinolone, levofloxacin, demonstrated promising activity against contemporary pathogens.
TI  - AmpG, a signal transducer in chromosomal beta-lactamase induction.
AB  - The chromosomal ampC beta-lactamase in Citrobacter freundii and Enterobacter cloacae is inducible by beta-lactam antibiotics. When an inducible ampC gene is introduced on a plasmid into Escherichia coli together with its transcriptional regulator ampR, the plasmid-borne beta-lactamase is still inducible. We have isolated mutants, containing alterations in a novel E. coli gene, ampG, in which a cloned C. freundii ampC gene is unable to respond to beta-lactam inducers. The ampG gene was cloned, sequenced and mapped to minute 9.6 on the E. coli chromosome. The deduced amino acid sequence predicted AmpG to be a 53 kDa, transmembrane protein, which we propose acts as a signal transducer or permease in the beta-lactamase induction system. Immediately upstream of ampG there is another 579-base-pair-long open reading frame (ORF) encoding a putative lipoprotein shown to be non-essential for beta-lactamase induction. We have found that ampG and this ORF form an operon, whose promoter is located in front of the ORF. Located closely upstream of the putative promoter is the morphogene bolA, which is transcribed in the opposite orientation. However, using transcription fusions, we have found that the ampG transcription is not regulated by bolA. In addition, we show that transcription is probably not regulated by either the starvation specific sigma factor RpoS, which controls bolA, or by AmpD the negative regulator for ampC transcription.
TI  - Single-dose pharmacokinetics and safety of HA-1A, a human IgM anti-lipid-A monoclonal antibody, in pediatric patients with sepsis syndrome.
AB  - The pharmacokinetics and safety of HA-1A (Nebacumab), a human IgM monoclonal antibody with specificity for the lipid A region of endotoxin, were evaluated in a multicenter trial of pediatric patients with sepsis syndrome or septic shock. Forty-two patients received a total of 44 infusions of drug, at a dose of 3 mg/kg (maximum 100 mg). The mean age was 7 years 10 months (range, 11 months to 16 years 7 months). The pharmacokinetic behavior of HA-1A during 36 hours was best described by a one-compartment open model. Clearance (6.1 +/- 2.0 ml/kg per hour) and apparent volume of distribution at steady state (0.11 +/- 0.03 L/kg) were larger than values reported previously in adults with sepsis syndrome. Elimination half-life (14.5 +/- 6.8 hours) and plasma concentration after infusion (30.7 +/- 14.5 mg/L) were similar to adults' values. In an additional three patients studied for 72 hours after administration, a biexponential function (i.e., two-compartment open model) best described the pharmacokinetic behavior of HA-1A: clearance (1.5 +/- 1.4 ml/hr per kilogram) and apparent volume of distribution at steady state (0.2 +/- 0.02 L/kg) were different (p < 0.002) from values observed in children's blood samples during 36 hours. Within the pediatric population, no age-related differences in pharmacokinetics could be detected. Drug disposition was unaffected by renal or hepatic dysfunction. Decreased blood pressure was the most frequently reported adverse event; 4 (9%) episodes in 44 infusions were considered possibly related to the study drug. Gram-negative bacteremia was documented in 23 (55%) of 42 patients. The overall mortality rate was 31%. Enterobacter cloacae was the most common pathogen isolated. Haemophilus influenzae type b was isolated from one child with sepsis syndrome. We conclude that infusion of HA-1A in children is associated with a low incidence of side effects. The pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic behavior of HA-1A in children requires further study to determine whether developmental differences exist and how these differences might affect drug administration. Efficacy remains to be studied.
TI  - [A nationwide survey of antimicrobial susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibiotics in Japan (1988-1990)].
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical isolates to  antibacterial agents at 149 hospitals throughout Japan from September to December in both 1989 and 1990. In this study, identifications and susceptibility testings were carried out at each hospital laboratory. The susceptibility testings were performed according to the disk diffusion method recommended by NCCLS. Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci showed high or moderate resistance rates to beta-lactam antibiotics, but Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae were highly susceptible to them. Enterococcus faecalis was susceptible to imipenem (IPM) and piperacillin but resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics and aminoglycosides. Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis were susceptible to beta-lactam drugs and aminoglycosides. Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa had a good susceptibility to IPM and aminoglycosides. Bacteroides fragilis was highly susceptible to IPM. IPM had strong antibacterial activity to many species of clinical isolates, including strains which were resistant to commonly used antibiotics.
TI  - Decimal assay for additivity of drugs permits delineation of synergy and antagonism.
AB  - Although there are many in vitro tests for drug interactions, few possess a linear, predictable dose-dependent end point or have a precise definition for additivity. Therefore, a new test with both of these features, the decimal assay for additivity, was developed. This test is based on a disk diffusion assay and the strict linear relationship between drug mass and size of the inhibition zone. When the decimal assay for additivity was applied to combinations known on a mechanistic basis to be additive, synergistic, or antagonistic, results of the new test always reflected the expected drug interaction. For example, synergy between trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole was detected in tests with Escherichia coli and Haemophilus influenzae, as was antagonism between cefoxitin and cefotaxime in tests with Enterobacter cloacae. Quinolones plus chloramphenicol appeared to be antagonistic. In addition to correctly identifying the drug interaction, the decimal assay for additivity identified the drug ratio producing the maximal drug interaction. These results suggest that the decimal assay for additivity should prove very useful in future studies of drug interactions.
TI  - Determinants of the activity of beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations.
AB  - Inhibitor combinations provide one strategy to overcome beta-lactamase-mediated resistance. Their success depends, obviously, on the inhibitor being able to bind and inactivate the beta-lactamase molecules. Clavulanate, sulbactam and tazobactam are irreversible inactivators of many beta-lactamases, forming covalent complexes which resist hydrolysis. 'Suicide' kinetics are seen with some, but not all, enzymes. All three compounds inactivate staphylococcal penicillinase, the chromosomal beta-lactamases of Proteus vulgaris and Bacteroides spp., and the Class IV beta-lactamases present in some klebsiellae. Tazobactam, but not the other compounds, has moderate activity against some Class I (AmpC) chromosomal beta-lactamases, notably that of Morganella morganii, but not that of Enterobacter cloacae. Both clavulanate and tazobactam are strong inhibitors of the widely distributed TEM and SHV plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases; sulbactam is a weaker inhibitor. Other factors, aside from the affinity of the inhibitor for the enzyme, co-determine the success or failure of inhibition. Potentiation is most readily achieved if little enzyme is produced, and if the organism is very permeable to the inhibitor. Thus, resistance to inhibitor combinations is rare in strains of Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae that produce TEM-beta-lactamase, but is commoner in enterobacteria that produce this enzyme, since these are less permeable and sometimes manufacture very large amounts of enzyme. The partner beta-lactam agent is also important. Irrespective of the inhibitor used, piperacillin is easier to protect against TEM beta-lactamases and the M. morganii Class I enzyme than are ampicillin, amoxycillin or ticarcillin. This may relate to the lower affinity of piperacillin for these enzymes, or to its greater affinity for the bacterial penicillin-binding proteins. Finally, pH can affect the degree of inhibition achieved with sulphones for some beta-lactamases, notably TEM-1.
TI  - Comparative antimicrobial activity of lomefloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and enoxacin against > 500 bacterial isolates.
AB  - An agar dilution technique was used to compare the antimicrobial activities of lomefloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and enoxacin against 544 strains of bacterial isolates. Among the five quinolone agents tested, ciprofloxacin was the most active. Enoxacin was the most active after ciprofloxacin against Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Shigella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, and Haemophilus influenzae with an MIC90 of < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml. Ofloxacin was the most active agent after ciprofloxacin against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter diversus, and Legionella pneumophila with an MIC of < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml. Ciprofloxacin inhibited Staphylococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp., at < or = 0.5 micrograms/ml and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. Norfloxacin and enoxacin had the same antimicrobial activity (MIC90) against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae and some other Gram-positive species, but these activities were weak when compared with ciprofloxacin. The results of this in vitro study show that ciprofloxacin is very active against Gram-negative and Gram-positive species.
TI  - [Basic and clinical study of meropenem in pediatric field].
AB  - Meropenem (MEPM), a novel parenteral carbapenem antibiotic, was examined in a cooperative study involving 12 pediatric and 1 neonatologic facilities. The results are summarized as follows. 1. Antibacterial activity Antibacterial activity of MEPM against stock organisms including 31 strains of Streptococcus agalactiae, 14 of Listeria monocytogenes, 4 of Bordetella pertussis and 3 of Neisseria meningitidis ranged from 0.025 to 0.10 micrograms/ml in MIC90's, which were equal or lower than those of control drugs such as imipenem cefazolin, cefotiam, cefotaxime, ceftazidime and latamoxef. MICs against clinical isolates were as follows: In Gram-positive bacteria, MICs were 0.20 micrograms/ml to 6.25 micrograms/ml against 3 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, and 0.025 micrograms/ml or less against 4 of Streptococcus pneumoniae. In Gram-negative bacilli, MICs were 0.10 micrograms/ml to 0.20 micrograms/ml against 3 strains of Haemophilus influenzae and 0.78, 0.10 and 0.78 micrograms/ml, respectively, against one strain each of Enterobacter cloacae, Morganella morganii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. MIC against 1 strain of Peptococcus saccharolyticus was < or = 0.025 micrograms/ml. 2. Pharmacokinetics Maximum plasma concentrations after intravenous infusion of MEPM over 30 minutes at doses of 10, 20 and 40 mg/kg, respectively, to 3 different groups of 3 children (total 9 cases) were observed at the completion of the treatment. Mean maximum concentrations in the 3 groups were 36.3, 69.5 and 129.8 micrograms/ml, respectively, exhibiting clear dose response. Mean plasma half lives in beta phase were 0.94, 0.86 and 0.94 hours, respectively, exhibiting no difference by doses, and this trend was observed also by HPLC. Urinary excretion rates in the first 6 hours after dose in the 10, 20 and 40 mg/kg groups were 67.3, 65.6 and 68.4%, respectively. Concentrations of MEPM in cerebrospinal fluid were determined in 2 cases of pyogenic meningitis. In 1 case, 500 mg (5.9 mg/kg) of MEPM was infused intravenously over 30 minutes and concentrations on Days 6, 8 and 15 observed at 190, 60 and 100 minutes after respective doses were 0.13, 0.10 micrograms/ml and less than the detection limit. Cerebrospinal fluid-plasma concentration ratio was determinable only on Day 8 and was 2.8%. In another case to which 250 mg (38.5 mg/kg) of MEPM was infused intravenously over 30 minutes, the concentration at Days 6, 7 and 10, 1 hour after the dose were less than the detection limit on day 6, and 2.04 and 2.62 micrograms/ml, respectively on days 7 and 10. 3. Clinical efficacy Clinical efficacies were evaluated in 49 cases and the efficacy rate was 93.9%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activities of ticarcillin alone and ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid against beta-lactamase producing and non-producing microorganisms.
AB  - A total of 818 clinical bacterial isolates were tested for the production of beta-lactamase by rapid chromogenic cephalosporin method and for the susceptibility to ticarcillin alone and in combination with clavulanic acid (2 micrograms/mL) by agar dilution method. These included 83 strains of methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), 31 of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), 49 of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, 58 of Haemophilus influenzae, 112 of Escherichia coli, 118 of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 58 of Proteus mirabilis, 30 of Proteus vulgaris, 60 of Serratia marcescens, 113 of Enterobacter cloacae, 60 of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 46 of Bacteroides fragilis. The results revealed that 46.6% of P. mirabilis, 53.4% of H. influenzae, 57.1% of N. gonorrhoeae, 80% of P. vulgaris, 83.9% of MRSA, 85.6% of MSSA, 87.5% of E. coli, 91.7% of S. marcescens, 95.7% of B. fragilis, 98.2% of E. cloacae, and 100% of K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa strains produced beta-lactamase. In general, beta-lactamase nonproducers were more susceptible to ticarcillin than beta-lactamase producers. The ranges of minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of ticarcillin for beta-lactamase nonproducers of MSSA, MRSA, H. influenzae, E. coli, P. vulgaris, S. marcescens, E. cloacae, B. fragilis and beta-lactamase producers of MSSA, H. influenzae strains were all within the in vitro susceptible range. The presence of clavulanic acid resulted in a significant enhancement of the antibacterial activity of ticarcillin against beta-lactamase producers of MRSA, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis, P. vulgaris and B. fragilis strains. Clavulanic acid had no synergistic activity for ticarcillin against S. marcescens, P. aeruginosa and E. cloacae.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of LJC 10,627.
AB  - The in vitro activity of LJC 10,627, a new carbapenem, was compared with those of imipenem, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and gentamicin. LJC 10,627 inhibited 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter agglomerans, Enterobacter cloacae, Hafnia alvei, Citrobacter freundii, Citrobacter diversus, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Proteus rettgeri, Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas cepacia, salmonellae, shigellae, aeromonas, and yersiniae at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml. Haemophilus influenzae was inhibited by 0.5 microgram/ml, and moraxellae were inhibited by 0.12 microgram/ml. LJC 10,627 was twofold more active than imipenem against aerobic gram-negative organisms and inhibited ceftazidime-, cefotaxime-, and gentamicin-resistant members of the genera Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Citrobacter, and Serratia at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml. Xanthomonas maltophilia strains were resistant to the drug. Imipenem was two- to fourfold more active than LJC 10,627 against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. LJC 10,627 did not inhibit most methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis strains. LJC 10,627 inhibited Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae at 0.06 and 0.12 microgram/ml, respectively. Bacteroides fragilis and other Bacteroides spp. were inhibited by 0.5 microgram of LJC 10,627 per ml. Serum (50%) did not affect the MICs. LJC 10,627 was not hydrolyzed by plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases of Bush types 2b, 2b', TEM-1, TEM-2, TEM-3, TEM-5, TEM-7, TEM-9, and SHV-1; the chromosomal beta-lactamases of Bush type 1; P-99; a Morganella enzyme; or a Citrobacter freundii enzyme. The Bush type 2c and 2d enzymes OXA-1, OXA-2, PSE-1, PSE-2, and PSE-4 did not hydrolyze LJC 10,627, nor did the beta-lactamases of Staphylococcus aureus, Moraxella spp., Bacteroides fragilis, and Proteus vulgaris. The beta-lactamase of Xanthomonas hydrolyzed LJC 10,627, albeit at approximately one-third the rate that imipenem was hydrolyzed.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo activities of SCE-2787, a new parenteral cephalosporin with  a broad antibacterial spectrum.
AB  - SCE-2787, a new cephalosporin having a condensed azolium moiety in the 3 position and an aminothiadiazolyl group in the 7 beta side chain, was evaluated for its in vitro and in vivo activities in comparison with those of ceftazidime, flomoxef, cefpirome, and E1040. Against methicillin-susceptible strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, SCE-2787 was more active than ceftazidime and E1040 and was as active as flomoxef and cefpirome, with MICs for 90% of strains tested (MIC90s) being 1.56 micrograms/ml or less. SCE-2787 was also active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, for which the MIC90 was 6.25 micrograms/ml, which was lower than that of cefpirome and comparable to that of ceftazidime. SCE-2787 was marginally active against methicillin-resistant strains of staphylococci and Enterococcus faecalis, although its MIC90s were the lowest among those of the antibiotics tested. The activities of SCE-2787 against Streptococcus species, most members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, and Haemophilus influenzae exceeded those of ceftazidime and flomoxef and were comparable to those of cefpirome. Furthermore, MIC90s of SCE-2787 were significantly lower than those of ceftazidime for ceftazidime-resistant isolates of Citrobacter freundii and Enterobacter cloacae. SCE-2787 was resistant to hydrolysis by various types of beta-lactamases, including the Bush group 1 beta-lactamases, and had low affinities for these enzymes, with Km or Ki values of greater than 100 microM. The in vitro activity of SCE-2787 was reflected in its efficacy in mouse protection tests. Thus, SCE-2787 appears to be a promising cephalosporin that should be further evaluated in clinical trials.
TI  - In vitro activity of cefquinome, a new cephalosporin, compared with other cephalosporin antibiotics.
AB  - The in vitro activity of cefquinome, a new aminothiazolyl cephalosporin with a C-3 bicyclic pyridinium group, was compared with ceftazidime, cefpirome, and cefepime. Cefquinome inhibited members of the Enterobacteriaceae at less than or equal to 0.5 microgram/ml for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Citrobacter diversus, Salmonella Shigella, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella, and Providencia. Although most Citrobacter freundii and Enterobacter cloacae were inhibited by less than 2 micrograms/ml, some strains resistant to ceftazidime were resistant, [minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) greater than 16 micrograms/ml]. Serratia marcescens were inhibited by less than 1 microgram/ml and Pseudomonas aeruginosa by 8 micrograms/ml similar to the activity of cefepime. The majority of Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae were inhibited by less than 0.25 microgram/ml. Most enterococci had cefquinome MICs of 4-8 micrograms/ml. Cefquinome was extremely active against group-A streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae with MICs less than 0.12 microgram/ml. 90% of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus 90% were inhibited by 2 micrograms/ml. Overall, the in vitro activity of cefquinome was comparable with aminothiazolyl cephalosporins. It inhibited some Enterobacter and Citrobacter freundii resistant to ceftazidime as did cefpirome and cefepime. Cefquinome was not destroyed by the common plasmid beta-lactamases TEM-1, TEM-2, SHV-1, or by the chromosomal beta-lactamases of Klebsiella, Branhamella, and Pseudomonas, but it was hydrolyzed by TEM-3, TEM-5, and TEM-9. Its activity was not adversely decreased in different medium or protein, and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) for most species except for Enterobacter were within a dilution of MICs.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological, and clinical studies on panipenem/betamipron in children].
AB  - Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies were performed on panipenem/betamipron (PAPM/BP) in children. The results are summarized as follow: 1. Twelve patients with various bacterial infectious diseases were treated with PAPM/BP. Each dose was 20 mg/20 mg/kg, administered 3 times daily, in 30-minute intravenous drip infusion. Treatments were continued for 5-22 days. Clinical efficacies of PAPM/BP in 12 patients with bacterial infections (1 with suspected sepsis, 5 with pneumonia, 1 with acute maxillary sinusitis, 2 with acute otitis media, 1 with cervical abscess and 2 with urinary tract infection complexed type) were evaluated as excellent in 7, good in 4 and fair in 1, with an efficacy rate of 91.7%. Seventeen causative organisms found in 10 patients (Haemophilus influenzae in 4, Branhamella catarrhalis in 3, Streptococcus pneumoniae in 2, Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 2, Staphylococcus aureus in 1, alpha-Streptococcus in 1, Corynebacterium sp. in 1, Peptostreptococcus micros in 1 and Klebsiella pneumoniae in 2) were eradicated except 2 strains (S. aureus and P. aeruginosa) from 1 patient (patient No. 2). No adverse reactions were observed in any of the 12 patients. 2. MICs of PAPM were examined against 22 clinical isolates (H. influenzae 5, B. catarrhalis 3, alpha-Streptococcus 3, S. pneumoniae 2, Corynebacterium sp. 2, S. aureus 1, P. aeruginosa 1, P. micros 1, Enterobacter cloacae 1, Escherichia coli 1, Group D Streptococcus 1 and Staphylococcus epidermidis 1) from children with bacterial infections. PAPM showed a good antibacterial activity comparable to the activity of cefoperazone (CPZ) against S. pneumoniae strains relatively tolerant to penicillins. However, the activity of PAPM against H. influenzae was somewhat weaker than that of CPZ. 3. Pharmacokinetic studies.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [A clinical study on panipenem/betamipron in chronic respiratory tract infections].
AB  - Panipenem/betamipron (CS-976, PAPM/BP), a new carbapenem antibiotic, was administered a single dose of 500 mg or 750 mg via intravenous drip infusion twice a day for treatment of chronic respiratory infection to study its clinical efficacy, bacteriological efficacy and safety. Twenty nine cases were studied for the efficacy evaluation. Only the safety evaluation was made in 6 cases which were judged to be unsuitable, because in some of them pneumonia and other diseases were not specified as the subject diseases, of serious illness in some the conditions were too serious, and in the other cases the duration of administration was insufficient since administration had to be discontinued due to side-effects. The duration of administration was 6 to 18 days with 1 g divided into 2 doses daily or 4 to 15 days with 1.5 g in 2 divided doses daily. When clinical efficacies were classified according to different diseases, this preparation was effective in 11 cases and slightly effective in 1 case of 12 cases of chronic bronchitis with an efficacy rate of 91.7%. It was effective in 10 cases, slightly effective in 1 case and ineffective in 1 case of 12 cases of bronchiectasis with an efficacy rate of 83.3%. It was slightly effective in 2 and ineffective in 1 out of 3 cases of diffuse panbronchiolitis, and was effective in 2 cases of pulmonary emphysema with infections. PAPM/BP was given at a dose level of 1 g in 2 divided doses daily to 17 cases and that of 1.5 g in 2 divided doses daily to 10 cases. For the remaining 2 cases, changes in the dose level were made in middle course of treatment. The efficacy rate in the 1 g regimen was 76.5% and that with the 1.5 g regimen was 90%. The overall results in the 29 cases included 23 effective, 4 slightly effective and 2 ineffective cases, thus the overall efficacy rate was 79.3%. As pathogens, 11 species including 24 strains were isolated and identified from 19 cases. They were Gram-positive cocci including 2 strains each of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae, 1 strain each of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus sanguis, and Streptococcus viridans and a strain of Streptococcus spp., and Gram-negative rods including 9 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4 strains of Haemophilus influenzae and 1 strain each of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas spp.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Comparative activity of meropenem (SM-7338) against major respiratory pathogens and amikacin-resistant nosocomial isolates.
AB  - Meropenem, a new broad-spectrum carbapenem antibiotic, demonstrated excellent in  vitro activity against major respiratory pathogens including Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Minimal inhibitory concentrations of meropenem for Moraxella catarrhalis and Haemophilus influenzae isolates were frequently less than those of imipenem. For nosocomial amikacin-resistant gram-negative bacilli, meropenem had eightfold lower MIC90 values compared to imipenem against strains of Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae and Escherichia coli; it was 32-fold more active than imipenem against Proteus mirabilis isolates. Activity was similar to that of imipenem against Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates. Overall, meropenem showed excellent activity against common community-acquired pathogens as well as amikacin-resistant nosocomial pathogens.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents, 1989. A study mainly focused on imipenem. The Research Group for Testing Imipenem Susceptibilities of Clinical Isolates].
AB  - We investigated susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (IPM) and other antimicrobial agents at hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1989. The susceptibility testing was carried out according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc technique in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: (+++), (++), (+) and (-). IPM showed markedly high in vitro activities against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Bacteroides fragilis and had rather strong activities against Enterococcus faecalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Achromobacter xylosoxidans, but was less active to Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci and Xanthomonas maltophilia. IPM has been found to have activities superior to those of other antibiotics tested against E. faecalis, E. cloacae, C. freundii, S. marcescens, P. aeruginosa and B. fragilis. No antibiotics tested showed good activities against MRSA except minocycline.
TI  - Cefpodoxime: comparative antibacterial activity, influence of growth conditions,  and bactericidal activity.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of cefpodoxime, the active metabolite of the new cephalosporin ester cefpodoxime proxetil, in comparison to cefixime, cefotiam, cefuroxime, and cefotaxime was determined against a broad spectrum of freshly isolated gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains. Cefpodoxime was demonstrated to be inhibitory at concentrations of less than or equal to 1 mg/l against 90% of strains of Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli (beta-lactamase- negative strains), Klebsiella spp., Serratia spp., Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Providencia spp., and Salmonella spp. This antimicrobial activity of cefpodoxime was generally superior to that of cefuroxime and similar to that of cefixime. Cefpodoxime was active at less than or equal to 1 mg/l against 50% of the members of beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Citrobacter spp., and Morganella morganii. Cefpodoxime proved to be highly inhibitory against group A, B, and G streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC90 less than 0.015 mg/l). The MICs of cefpodoxime and those of the other cephalosporins were less than 2 mg/l for greater than or equal to 90% of the strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, with the exception of cefixime which had no activity with MICs below 8 mg/l against these bacteria. Pseudomonas spp., Acinetobacter spp., and Enterococcus spp. were resistant to cefpodoxime. The antibacterial activity of cefpodoxime was only to a minor degree influenced by different growth conditions with the exception of high inoculum sizes against some beta-lactamase producing strains of gram-negative bacilli.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - In vitro activity of a new cephalosporin ME-1206 compared with other agents.
AB  - The in vitro activity of ME-1206, a new aminothiazolyl cephalosporin that can be  orally absorbed when converted to an ester, was compared with that of other beta-lactams. ME-1206 inhibited 50% of the Enterobacteriaceae at 2 micrograms/ml, similar to cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and cefixime. It did not inhibit, MIC greater than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml, Enterobacter species or Citrobacter freundii resistant to cefotaxime and ceftazidime, and it was less active than cefotaxime and ceftazidime against Serratia marcescens. Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Moraxella catarrhalis were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.25 micrograms/ml of ME-1206 inhibited hemolytic streptococci groups A, B, C, and G, MIC90 0.06 micrograms/ml, but it did not inhibit enterococci. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other pseudomonads were resistant to ME-1206. MICs and MBCs of ME-1206 for susceptible species were within a dilution. ME-1206 was not hydrolyzed by TEM-1 or TEM-2, but was hydrolyzed by TEM-3 and TEM-5. ME-1206 was hydrolyzed by beta-lactamases of Morganella, Proteus vulgaris, and K1 of Klebsiella oxytoca, but minimally by the P99 beta-lactamase of Enterobacter cloacae. ME-1206 is comparable in in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability to many of the current cephalosporins.
TI  - Antibacterial activities of amoxicillin alone and in combination with clavulanic  acid correlated with beta-lactamase production.
AB  - Amoxicillin, a beta-lactam antibiotic, was tested for its effect in combination with clavulanic acid, a beta-lactamase inhibitor, against 9 species of bacteria isolated from clinical specimens. A total of 698 strains of bacteria were tested for beta-lactamase production by the rapid chromogenic cephalosporin method. Their susceptibilities to amoxicillin alone and in combination with clavulanic acid were tested by the agar dilution method. The percentage of beta-lactamase producing strains ranged from 46.6% in Proteus mirabilis to 100% in Klebsiella pneumoniac. In general, beta-lactamase nonproducers were more susceptible to amoxicillin than beta-lactamase producers. For beta-lactamase producers, clavulanic acid decreased the MICs of amoxicillin prominently in strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, K. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis, Enterobacter cloacae and Bacteroides fragilis, when combining clavulanic acid with amoxicillin in the ratio of 1:2. Their MIC50s, MIC90s and geometric means of MICs all decreased 4 folds or greater. For beta-lactamase non-producing strains, the MICs did not show significant differences by adding clavulanic acid in most species we tested, including methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, N. gonorrhoeae, H. influenzae, Proteus vulgaris and E. cloacae.
TI  - In vitro activity of cefcanel versus other oral cephalosporins.
AB  - Cefcanel is a new orally absorbed cephalosporin. Its activity was compared with that of cefuroxime, cefaclor, cephalexin, and cefixime against gram-positive and negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Cefcanel had excellent activity against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, MIC90 1 micrograms/ml, superior to the other oral cephalosporins. However, methicillin-resistant staphylococci were resistant, MIC greater than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml. Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by 0.015-1 micrograms/ml, concentrations comparable to other cephalosporins. Clostridium spp. were inhibited by 0.25 micrograms/ml, 8- to 128-fold lower concentrations than were found for other agents, but the MICs were greater than 64 micrograms/ml for Bacteroides spp. The MIC90 for Moraxella catarrhalis was 1 micrograms/ml, similar to cefuroxime but 16-fold greater than the MICs of cefixime. Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumonia which were high beta-lactamase producers were resistant, MICs greater than 64 micrograms/ml, and 50% of Enterobacter cloacae and Citrobacter freundii were resistant. Cefcanel was hydrolyzed by TEM-1, TEM-3 and Moraxella Bro-1 beta-lactamases. Escherichia coli containing TEM-1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and 9 had cefcanel MICs of greater than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml. Although cefcanel inhibited gram-positive species as well as or at lower concentrations than other cephalosporins, it lacked activity against gram-negative species that produced common plasmid beta-lactamase although it inhibited Haemophilus influenzae carrying TEM-1.
TI  - [Combined antibacterial activity of aztreonam and clindamycin against clinically  isolated strains].
AB  - It has been reported in some studies that the combination of aztreonam (AZT) and  clindamycin (CLDM) have high clinical effectiveness in the treatment of intractable infections. We, therefore, studied combined in vitro antibacterial activity of these 2 compounds using many freshly isolated strains. 1. AZT and CLDM in combination had synergistic effects on Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Haemophilus influenzae, which are sensitive or quasi-sensitive to CLDM, in the presence of CLDM at MIC or sub-MIC. 2. For Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which are not sensitive to CLDM, the 2 drugs in combination showed synergistic effects on some species and additive or slightly additive effects on most species in the presence of CLDM at those concentrations which are usually maintained in blood. 3. The 2 drugs showed no antagonism.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic and clinical studies on cefpirome in pediatrics].
AB  - Cefpirome (CPR, HR 810), a new parenteral cephalosporin antibiotic, was studied for its pharmacokinetics, bacteriological and clinical effects in the field of pediatrics. 1. CPR was very active against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Coagulase-negative staphylococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae among Gram-positive cocci. Antibacterial activities of CPR were also strong against Branhamella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Salmonella sp., Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa among Gram-negative rods. 2. The plasma concentration 15 minutes after a bolus intravenous injection of 20 mg/kg was 80.4 micrograms/ml, and the T 1/2 (beta) was 1.03 hours. Plasma concentrations after intravenous drip infusion over 30 minutes of 20 mg/kg and 25 mg/kg were 48.3 and 117 micrograms/ml at the end of infusion, and T 1/2 (beta) for these dosage were 1.14 and 1.45 hours. 3. The urinary recovery rates over 6 hours after administration were 45.2-63.9% for CPR. 4. Clinical efficacies of CPR were excellent in 31 patients and good in 30 patients with an efficacy rate of 98.4%. In bacteriological examinations, causative organisms were eradicated with an eradication rate of 95.7%. 5. As side effects, diarrhea was observed in 5 patients and loose stool in 1 patient with an incidence of 8.2%. Abnormal values were found in some patients in clinical laboratory tests for eosinophilia, thrombocytosis and an elevation of GOT, GPT and triglyceride. These findings indicate that CPR will be useful against bacterial infections in pediatrics.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of GR69153, a new long-acting cephalosporin.
AB  - GR69153, a new parenteral cephalosporin, inhibited 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter diversus, shigellae, and salmonellae at less than 0.25 micrograms/ml (MIC90). It had activity comparable to those of ceftazidime, cefpirome, cefepime, and E-1040. Against cephalosporinase-producing Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, and Serratia marcescens, MICs ranged from 0.12 to greater than 32 micrograms/ml, and cefpirome and cefepime were the most active agents against these species. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was highly susceptible to GR69153, and for this organism the MIC90 was less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, which was similar to the E-1040 MIC90, but most Pseudomonas cepacia and Xanthomonas maltophilia isolates were resistant. GR69153 inhibited Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella branhamella at less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms/ml. For Staphylococcus aureus GR69153 MICs were similar to those of ceftazidime and E-1040. Enterococci and listeriae were resistant to GR69153, but Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by 0.5 micrograms/ml. The activity of GR69153 was not affected by serum. GR69153 was not inactivated by the beta-lactamases of Staphylococcus aureus, TEM-1, TEM-2, SHV-1, and BRO-1, but it was hydrolyzed by TEM-3, TEM-9, and morganellae. GR69153 had overall activity comparable to those of commercially available parenteral cephalosporins or those found in clinical investigations. It is more active against bacteroides than most available aminothiazolyl parenteral cephalosporins are. GR69153 is hydrolyzed by the new plasmid beta-lactamases, and thus, its primary value may be related to its pharmacological properties.
TI  - Intravenous ciprofloxacin versus ceftazidime for treatment of nosocomial pneumonia and urinary tract infection.
AB  - Intravenous ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime were compared for efficacy in the treatment of nosocomial pneumonia and urinary tract infection (UTI). Patients with nosocomial pneumonia were randomized to receive ciprofloxacin (as the lactate salt) 300 mg i.v. every 12 hours or ceftazidime (with sodium carbonate) 2 g i.v. every eight hours. Patients with UTI were randomized to receive ciprofloxacin 200 mg i.v. every 12 hours or ceftazidime 1 g i.v. every eight hours. Sputum and urine specimens were collected before, during, and after therapy. For patients with pneumonia, the organisms most frequently isolated before treatment began were Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis. Of the 17 pneumonia patients who completed ciprofloxacin treatment, 15 (88%) had resolution of signs and symptoms or improvement. Of the 15 ceftazidime-treated pneumonia patients, 13 (87%) had resolution or improvement. Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus species, Acinetobacter species, and K. pneumoniae infections persisted for the ciprofloxacin treatment failures. Infections by Enterobacter cloacae and Acinetobacter species persisted for the ceftazidime treatment failures. For UTI patients, E. coli was the organism most frequently isolated before treatment. All 14 UTI patients who completed treatment showed resolution or improvement. In the ciprofloxacin group two patients were superinfected by Enterococcus species, and in the ceftazidime group there were two superinfections by Enterococcus species and one by Enterobacter cloacae. Intravenous ciprofloxacin was as effective as ceftazidime in the treatment of nosocomial pneumonia and urinary tract infection. Caution should be exercised when treating serious infections by streptococci or staphylococci.
TI  - Fleroxacin combined with rifampin.
AB  - We determined the effect of the combination of rifampin and fleroxacin against Enterobacteriaceae and streptococcal species. None of the 65 isolates tested by checkerboard assay demonstrated synergy, 12% of isolates showed an additive effect; 86.7% were indifferent, and only 1 isolate showed antagonism. The mean FIC was 1.2. When using 2 and 8 micrograms/ml of rifampin, fleroxacin MICs of 285 isolates of Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, staphylococci, streptococci, Bacteroides, and Clostridium were not increased, but synergy was not demonstrated. Time-kill studies against Escherichia coli, P. aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis failed to show increased killing when the two agents were present at one-half the MBC. The fleroxacin-rifampin interaction is one of indifference but provides coverage for species not adequately inhibited by fleroxacin.
TI  - Long term sequelae of childhood acute bacterial meningitis in a developing country. A study from the Sudan.
AB  - 35 survivors of acute bacterial meningitis (ABM) from a group of 44 Sudanese children--seen during 18 months (April 1985-November 1986)--were prospectively followed to ascertain the long-term sequelae of the disease. 30 (17 with Haemophilus influenzae, 8 Neisseria meningitidis, 4 Streptococcus pneumoniae and one child with Enterobacter cloacae meningitis) could be followed during the surveillance period (3-4 years). Three (10%), including 2 with hemiplegia, died after 11-12 months. The association between motor deficit on discharge from hospital and subsequent death was significant (p = 0.04). Of the remaining 27, neuropsychologic sequelae were recorded in 9 (33%). Sensorineural hearing loss was observed in 6 (22%) patients and improved in one during surveillance. Motor deficits were found to improve with time but were replaced by the development of epilepsy about 3 years later in 11% of the survivors. The mean IQ (+/- SD) score for a subgroup of 19 post-meningitic children (92.3 +/- 13.9) was found to be significantly lower than in their nearest-age sibling controls (100.7 +/- 10.2; p = less than 0.01). Younger age at admission and longer duration of ABM symptoms before treatment were significantly associated with poorer outcome (respectively, r = 0.63, p = less than 0.01, r = 0.67, p = less than 0.01). The potential impact of vaccination against the commonest organisms causing ABM in developing countries is discussed.
TI  - [Survey on clinical isolates from 13 hospitals in Akita Prefecture--changes in frequency and susceptibility of isolates by scale of hospital. Survey Group for Clinical Isolates, Chemotherapy Research Committee of Akita Prefecture].
AB  - Isolates from various clinical materials in 13 hospitals in Akita prefecture and  their drug susceptibility were investigated by the Chemotherapy Research Committee of Akita Prefecture during the period from Dec., 1987 to Feb., 1988. The results were as follows: 1. The total number of isolates was 8,387, including Staphylococcus aureus (18.9%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10.9%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (7.3%) and Enterococcus faecalis (6.6%). S, aureus and P. aeruginosa were detected more frequently in the larger hospitals. 2. The detection frequency of S. aureus from the sputum, throat swab and pus exudate was also very high. There was a diversity in isolates from the urine and the frequency of Escherichia coli was low. More than half of the isolates from the blood were S. epidermidis and S. aureus. Many kinds of bacteria were detected from pleural fluid and ascites, but the isolate showed no particular tendency. 3. The susceptibility of S. aureus to oxacillin were variable in hospitals, and the susceptibility to cefazolin were even lower. Low susceptibility were also seen with norfloxacin. S. aureus showed the highest susceptibility to minocycline. The susceptibility was lower for inpatients than for outpatients. P. aeruginosa showed low susceptibility to cefsulodin. The number of ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae isolates tended to decrease. Enterobacter cloacae showed a low susceptibility for cephems. Serratia marcescens showed low susceptibility to many drugs. Based on the above results, we concluded that attention should be paid to S. aureus, P. aeruginosa and Enterobacter in clinical practice.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents. A study mainly focused on imipenem. Reported by the Research Group for Testing Imipenem Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (IPM) and other antibacterial agents at 64 hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1988. In this study, identification and susceptibility testing were carried out at each laboratory and the tests were performed according to the disk dilution method recommended by NCCLS in which susceptibilities are classified into "S", "MS", "I" and "R". IPM showed markedly high in vitro activities against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Salmonella spp., Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia rettgeri, Providencia stuartii, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, Alcaligenes spp., Peptococcus spp./Peptostreptococcus spp., Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides spp. IPM also had strong activities against Achromobacter xylosoxidans and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but less active against Flavobacterium spp., E. faecium, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas cepacia. In a study in which activities of IPM against bacteria isolated from different clinical sources were compared, differences in susceptibilities were observed among S. aureus, CNS, A. calcoaceticus and P. aeruginosa, but such differences were not apparent among S. pneumoniae, E. faecalis, H. influenzae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, C. freundii, S. marcescens or P. mirabilis.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents. A study mainly focused on imipenem. Research Group for Testing Imipenem Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - We investigated susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (IPM) and other antimicrobial agents at 459 hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1988. In this study, identification and susceptibility testing were performed at each hospital laboratory and the tests were carried out according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc technique in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, + and -. IPM had significantly high activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Salmonella spp., Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia rettgeri, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Moraxella catarrhalis, Alcaligenes spp., Peptococcus spp./Peptostreptococcus spp., Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides spp. and should slightly lower activities on coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), Enterococcus faecalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus vulgaris, Providencia stuartii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa than on the above mentioned bacteria. In a comparative study on activities of IPM against bacteria from different clinical sources, no remarkable differences were found due to different sources among S. pneumoniae, E. faecalis, H. influenzae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, C. freundii, P. mirabilis or A. calcoaceticus, whereas slight differences were found among Staphylococcus aureus, CNS, S. marcescens and P. aeruginosa.
TI  - [Studies on respiratory infections in primary care clinic (IV). Antibiotic sensitivity of bacteria isolated from patients with respiratory infections visiting 21 private clinics in the Tohoku District of Japan].
AB  - We determined the MICs of ampicillin, methicillin, cefaclor, cefixime, cefteram,  ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin against a total of 1,448 strains from 11 species: 464 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 306 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 114 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, 37 strains of Branhamella catarrhalis, 329 strains of Haemophilus influenzae, 32 strains of Escherichia coli, 66 strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 26 strains of Enterobacter cloacae, 20 strains of Serratia marcescens, 12 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 42 strains of Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, isolated from the throat swab and the sputum of 2,539 patients with respiratory infections who visited 21 private clinics in Tohoku district of Japan during the period from January to April in 1989. Ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin were more active against S. aureus, B. catarrhalis, P. aeruginosa and A. calcoaceticus than other antibiotics. Ampicillin and cefteram were more active against S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes than other antibiotics. New-quinolones and cephems of new-generation were active against H. influenzae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae and S. marcescens. Of 30 strains of S. aureus which were resistant (MIC greater than or equal to 12.5 micrograms/ml) to ampicillin, only one strain was resistant (MIC greater than or equal to 12.5 micrograms/ml) to methicillin. Twenty strains (6.5%) of S. pneumoniae and 49 strains (14.9%) of H. influenzae were resistant (MIC greater than or equal to 1.56 micrograms/ml) to ampicillin. Of 101 strains of H. influenzae of which their beta-lactamase activity was determined by Nitrocephin-method, 27 (26.7%) were beta-lactamase-positive strains. The above results indicated that MRSA is only rarely found in primary care clinics but the incidence of ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae in primary care clinics is almost the same as that of the intensive care clinic, i.e. medical school-affiliated hospitals. Therefore caution should be exercised as regards antibiotic resistance of the causative organism even in primary care clinics.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of the new oral cephalosporin Bay  v 3522.
AB  - The activity of the new oral cephalosporin Bay v 3522 was compared to that of six other beta-lactam agents. Bay v 3522 inhibited methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, compared to MICs of greater than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml for the other cephalosporins tested. It was more active against Streptococcus pyogenes (MIC less than or equal to 0.06 microgram/ml) than cefuroxime, cefixime, cephalexin and cefaclor. Groups B, C and G streptococci were inhibited at less than or equal to 0.12 microgram/ml, while the MI"90 for Streptococcus bovis and viridans streptococci was 0.5 and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. The MIC90 for enterococci and Listeria monocytogenes was 8 micrograms/ml. Clostridium perfringens was inhibited by 0.12 microgram/ml, but most Bacteroides spp. were resistant. The MIC90 for beta-lactamase positive Escherichia coli (producing primarily TEM-1) was greater than 64 micrograms/ml and for beta-lactamase negative strains 16 micrograms/ml. The MIC90 for high-level beta-lactamase producing Klebsiella pneumoniae was greater than 64 micrograms/ml versus 4 micrograms/ml for other isolates. The MIC90 for Moraxella catarrhalis was 2 micrograms/ml, for Haemophilus influenzae 1 micrograms/ml, and for Neisseria gonorrhoeae 4 micrograms/ml. Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were resistant. Bay v 3522 was destroyed by TEM-1, SHV-1, TEM-3 and P99 beta-lactamases.
TI  - Antimicrobial activities of six new oral cephem antibiotics.
AB  - Six newly developed oral cephem antibiotics, which included 5 with an aminothiazolyl side chain, viz., cefixime, cefotiam hexetil, cefpodoxime proxetil, cefteram pivoxil, ceftibuten, and one with a conventional side chain design, BMY 28100, were tested for their antimicrobial activities. Three traditional oral beta-lactam antibiotics, ampicillin, cephalexin, and cefaclor, were used as reference antibiotics. The 5 aminothiazolyl cephems were more active than the reference drugs against clinical isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. All 6 new drugs showed poor activity against clinical isolates of Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterococci. They were better than cephalexin and cefaclor, but slightly poorer than or the same as ampicillin in activities against Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Cefotiam hexetil, BMY 28100, and cefpodoxime proxetil were also more active than cephalexin against Staphylococcus aureus. Although the 6 tested new oral cephems demonstrated little difference in their activities against different bacteria, they all showed greater antimicrobial activity than the traditional oral antibiotics now in clinical use.
TI  - [Clinical and pharmacokinetic studies on aztreonam in neonates].
AB  - Clinical and pharmacokinetic studies on aztreonam (AZT) were performed in neonates. The results are summarized as follows: A total of 6 cases consisting of 5 mature and 1 low-birth-weight infants was clinically evaluated. AZT 20 mg/kg was administered 2-3 times daily, via 1 hour intravenous drip infusion for 6-21 days. Concomitantly, vancomycin (VCM) 15 mg/kg was administered to 1 case 3 times daily, via 1 hour intravenous drip infusion for 3 days and ampicillin (ABPC) 20-50 mg/kg to 3 cases 3 time daily via 30 minutes intravenous drip infusion for 2-6 days. Of the 6 bacterial infection cases (1 with sepsis and purulent meningitis, 2 with sepsis, 2 with urinary tract infection and 1 with perirectal abscess), clinical effects of AZT were evaluated in 4 cases (2 each with sepsis and urinary tract infection) as "excellent" in all the cases. All of the causative organisms (Escherichia coli in 3 and Enterobacter cloacae in 1) were eradicated by the treatment with AZT. Neither clinical side effect nor abnormal laboratory test value caused by AZT was observed. MICs of AZT against 10 clinical isolates (Staphylococcus aureus 1, E. coli 4, Klebsiella pneumoniae 1, E. cloacae 1, Haemophilus influenzae 1 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa 2) from neonatal patients with bacterial infections were examined. As results, AZT showed very good antibacterial activity comparable or even superior to cefoperazone, cefotaxime, latamoxef; however, the activity against P. aeruginosa was inferior to imipenem.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Multicenter in vitro comparison of piperacillin and nine other antibacterials against 1,629 clinical isolates.
AB  - The antibacterial spectrum of activity of piperacillin was compared with that of  other antibiotics against isolates of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas cepacia, Pseudomonas maltophilia, Serratia marcescens, Enterococcus sp, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides bivius, and Clostridium difficile obtained from laboratories at hospitals in St. Louis, in Memphis, and in Newark, New Jersey. Of the 1,629 isolates tested, 91% were susceptible to piperacillin, 90% to mezlocillin, 87% to ticarcillin/clavulanate and imipenem, 83% to ceftazidime, 81% to cefoperazone, 80% to ciprofloxacin, 77% to ceftriaxone, 71% to aztreonam, and 51% to cefoxitin.
TI  - 3-Sulfonyl-1-carba-1-dethiacephems.
AB  - The stability of the 1-carba-1-dethiacephalosporin framework has allowed the synthesis of a range of 3-sulfonyl-1-carba-1-dethiacephems unavailable for a variety of reasons in the cephem arena. The known p-nitrobenzyl 7 beta-(phenoxyacetamido)-3-[[(trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl]oxy]-1-carba -1- dethia-3-cephem-4-carboxylate served as a precursor to this series of compounds. Displacement of the enol triflate with various sulfinates in acetonitrile or DMF and deprotection of the intermediates led to 7 beta-[(2-amino-4-thiazolyl)(methoxyimino)acetyl]amino]- 3-[alkyl(aryl)sulfonyl]-1-carba-1-dethia-3-cephem-4-carboxyl ic acids. The 3-sulfonyl-1-carba-1-dethiacephems display potent activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The following MIC's (microgram/mL) for the 3-cyclopropyl sulfone are representative: Staphylococcus aureus = 4, Streptococcus pyogenes = 1, Haemophilus influenzae = 0.25, Escherichia coli = 0.03, Enterobacter cloacae = 0.25, Proteus rettgeri = 0.25. The excellent in vitro antibacterial activity of this series indicates the potential of the carbacephalosporin framework for exploring substituents which are unknown or which produce unstable cephems.
TI  - Plasma tumor necrosis factor levels in patients with presumed sepsis. Results in  those treated with antilipid A antibody vs placebo.
AB  - Using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, we measured plasma levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) in 38 patients who were treated with either antilipid A antibody or a placebo for presumed gram-negative bacteremia. Sixteen of the 38 patients had positive blood cultures: 14 with gram-negative rods and 2 with Streptococcus pneumoniae. Initial serum samples for TNF determinations were obtained within 2 to 72 hours (mean, 18.8 hours) after the onset of clinical signs of sepsis. Six (16%) of 38 patients had detectable TNF levels: 4 of 14 with positive blood cultures for gram-negative rods but only 2 of 22 with negative blood cultures (odds ratio, 4; 95% confidence limits, 0.5 and 24.3). Of the 6 patients, 4 had received the placebo and 2 had received the antibody. Tumor necrosis factor levels did not predict adult respiratory distress syndrome, shock, disseminated intravascular coagulation, renal failure, or mortality. The highest TNF levels (500 and 250 pg/mL) were observed in 2 patients with Enterobacter cloacae bacteremia who had received the placebo and antilipid A antibody, respectively. The other 2 patients with bacteremia and detectable TNF levels had positive blood cultures for Haemophilus influenzae (50 pg/mL) and Bacteroides fragilis (120 pg/mL), respectively. Despite negative blood cultures, the remaining 2 patients repeatedly had detectable TNF levels and a clinical picture consistent with gram-negative sepsis.
TI  - Intravenous sulbactam/ampicillin in the treatment of pediatric infections.
AB  - A total of 82 patients involving 83 episodes of proven or presumed bacterial infection were treated with sulbactam/ampicillin. These included 36 cases of soft tissue infection or abscess, four cases of joint or bone infection, 20 cases of respiratory tract infection (17 cases of pneumonia, two of otitis media, and one of tonsillitis), 15 urinary tract infections, three cases of enterocolitis, one case of infective endocarditis, two cases of septicemia, and two of peritonitis. The causative pathogen was isolated in 48 cases (49 infections). These pathogens included Staphylococcus aureus 13 cases, Staphylococcus epidermidis one, Streptococcus pyogenes two, Streptococcus pneumoniae two, Viridans group streptococcus two, peptostreptococcus one, Haemophilus influenzae one, Escherichia coli 12, Enterobacter cloacae three, Proteus mirabilis one, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus one, Salmonella spp. two, Shigella sonnei one, Bacteroides fragilis one, and polymicrobial infections of various combinations in five cases. No bacterial pathogens were isolated in 34 infections, 14 cases of pneumonia and 15 soft tissue infections. Sulbactam/ampicillin was given by intravenous bolus in a dosage range of 75-450 mg/kg/day in four divided doses for variable periods of time depending on the type and severity of the infection. Of a total of 83 episodes of infections, 80 (96.4%) cases were either cured or improved. Bacteriologic eradication also occurred in 46 (93.9%) of 49 infections. Side effects were diarrhea in two patients, acute hemolytic anemia in one patient, and transient elevations in SGOT and leukopenia in one patient. Side effects disappeared upon completion of treatment. Sulbactam/ampicillin is a safe and effective antibiotic for the treatment of common pediatric infections.
TI  - In vitro activity of sulbactam in combination with various beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  - Forty-three strains (beta-lactamase positive and negative) from the species of Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, Acinetobacter baumanii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were studied for synergy between sulbactam and several beta-lactam antibiotics. Using a checkerboard method, synergy was observed with 10 to 55% of the beta-lactamase negative strains. Synergy was more frequent with the strains producing beta-lactamase. Using the killing curve method, synergy was also observed between sulbactam and beta-lactam antibiotics against some beta-lactamase negative strains. In addition, the regrowth of a resistant subpopulation was prevented by sulbactam.
TI  - [Clinical experience with cefodizime in bacterial infection of children].
AB  - Clinical studies were performed on cefodizime (THR-221, CDZM), a new cephem antibiotic as described below. CDZM was administered to 13 patients in dose levels ranging from 55 to 96 mg/kg/day t.i.d. for 3-7 days (5.5 days on average). These patients included 8 with pneumonia, 2 with tonsillitis, 1 each with bronchitis, phlegmon and urinary tract infection. The overall efficacy rate was 92.3%, i.e., efficacy was excellent in 8, good in 4 and poor in 1. Bacteriological efficacy was 83.3%, i.e., 5 strains of bacteria (Streptococcus pneumoniae 1, Haemophilus influenzae 3, Haemophilus parainfluenzae 1) were eradicated and 1 was unchanged (Enterobacter cloacae, MIC greater than 100 micrograms/ml). Clinical side effect was not observed during the treatment. Laboratory abnormalities were observed in 2 cases, i.e., a slight elevation of GPT and a mild eosinophilia. The above results suggest that CDZM is a useful antibiotic for treating pediatric bacterial infections.
TI  - [Susceptibility of clinical isolates to aztreonam].
AB  - In vitro antibacterial activities of 9 antibiotics including aztreonam (AZT) against clinically isolated Gram-negative bacteria were determined using MIC-2000 plus system. Bacteria were isolated from clinical materials in Saga Medical School during a period from May 1987 to March 1988. Summarized results were as follows: 1. AZT showed excellent antibacterial activities against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus sp. and Haemophilus influenzae, and MIC80 values of AZT against these organisms were lower than 0.20 microgram/ml. 2. Antibacterial activities of AZT were superior to cephem antibiotics compared against Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii and Serratia marcescens. 3. The MIC50 and MIC80 of AZT against Pseudomonas aeruginosa were 12.5 micrograms/ml and 25 micrograms/ml, respectively. 4. AZT did not show any antibacterial activity against Acinetobacter sp. and Xanthomonas maltophilia.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial properties of cefetamet and in vivo activity of its orally absorbable ester derivative, cefetamet pivoxil.
AB  - The in vitro activity of cefetamet, the microbiologically active metabolite of the orally administered prodrug cefetamet pivoxil, was compared with that of cephalexin, cefaclor, cefuroxime and amoxicillin. Cefetamet was highly active against Enterobacteriaceae, Neisseria spp., Vibrio spp., Haemophilus influenzae and streptococci other than enterococci. Cefetamet inhibited cefaclor-resistant species such as Proteus vulgaris, Providencia stuartii, Providencia rettgeri and Serratia marcescens. Staphylococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and cephalosporinase-overproducing strains of Enterobacter cloacae were resistant to cefetamet. The superior activity of cefetamet compared with older oral beta-lactam antibiotics against a large number of gram-negative pathogens correlated with enhanced stability towards beta-lactamases. In accordance with the in vitro findings, cefetamet pivoxil showed good activity in experimental infections in the mouse and rat, suggesting satisfactory bioavailability in these animals after oral administration.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. A study mainly focused on ofloxacin (the second report). Reported by the Research Group for Testing ofloxacin Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - Susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (OFLX) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures throughout Japan between April, 1986 and March, 1987. The results were totalized with an emphasis mainly on OFLX and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. In this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. Similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to OFLX included Staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), Entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), Escherichia coli (4,097 strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), Enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), Enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), Citrobacter freundii (406 strains), Proteus mirabilis (613 strains), Morganella morganii (320 strains), Serratia marcescens (869 strains), Haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), Acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and Campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). Neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to OFLX was investigated with this species. As results, OFLX showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, E. aerogenes, C. freundii, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, H. influenzae, A. calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp., and C. jejuni. However, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. The following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: Streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), Streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), Enterococcus faecium (146 strains), Branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), Citrobacter diversus (128 strains), Klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), Proteus vulgaris (438 strains), Serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), Pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), Pseudomonas putida (154 strains), Xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), Vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), Bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),
TI  - In-vitro activity of FCE 22101 against respiratory tract pathogens with reference to production of beta-lactamases.
AB  - FCE 22101 is a new penem with broad antibacterial spectrum, excluding the pseudomonads, and has stability to many beta-lactamases. FCE 22101 and imipenem were very potent against the bacteria studied, including beta-lactamase producing strains, which can be isolated from patients with respiratory tract infections (MIC less than or equal to 8 mg/l). No strains were found to be resistant to FCE 22101. FCE 22101 was rapidly bactericidal and more stable to inactivation by beta-lactamases from Branhamella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Enterobacter cloacae and Klebsiella pneumoniae than imipenem and ceftibuten. The other antibiotics tested varied in their activities against the respiratory tract pathogens.
TI  - A clinical evaluation of sulbactam/ampicillin in the treatment of pediatric infections.
AB  - We have treated 42 episodes of pediatric infections with sulbactam/ampicillin since 1987. Included were 9 cellulitis, 9 urinary tract infections, 5 cervical lymphadenitis, 4 meningitis, 2 thoracic empyema, 2 osteomyelitis, 2 sepsis, 1 furuncle, 1 perianal abscess, 1 dental abscess, 1 peritonsillitis, 1 salmonellosis, 1 shigellosis, 1 peritonitis, 1 suppurative thyroiditis, 1 infective endocarditis. Responsible pathogens were Escherichia coli in 8, Staphylococcus aureus in 6, Hemophilus influenzae in 2, Streptococcus pneumoniae in 3, Streptococcus viridans in 2, Staphylococcus epidermidis in 1, Bacteroides fragilis in 1, Salmonella D1 in 1, Shigella sonnei in 1, Klebsiella pneumoniae in 1, Enterobacter agglomerans in 1, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus in 1, Enterobacter cloacae in 1, group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus in 1, and polymicrobial infection in 4 cases. Thirty-nine out of 41 (95%) clinically evaluable patients cured and all (34/34) bacteriologically evaluable patients eradicated their pathogens after treatment with sulbactam/ampicillin. Side reactions were seen in five patients; one maculopapular skin rash, one hemolytic anemia, two diarrhea, and one liver function impairment plus leukopenia. All these reactions were transient and did not require interruption of therapy. These results indicate that sulbactam/ampicillin is safe and effective in the treatment of common pediatric infections beyond the neonatal period.
TI  - [The ratios and kinds of clinical bacteria isolated in Taiwan's large-size hospitals].
AB  - The prevalence of clinical bacteria, as isolated from Linko Chang-Gung Memorial Hospital (2,300 beds) in the period January 1985 to December 1986 and from Taipei Veterans General Hospital (2,300 beds) during the period January 1986 to December 1986, was analyzed with the following findings: (i) The isolation ratio of anaerobic and aerobic or facultative bactria during the period of investigation were 7.8% (5,513/70,799) and 92.2% (65,286/70,799), respectively. (ii) Of the total aerobic or facultative isolates from the two hospitals, 32.9% (21,510/65,286) were Gram positive cocci and bacilli, 67.1% (43,776/65,286) were Gram negative cocci and bacilli. (iii) Of these Gram-negative bacilli, 65.2% (28,490/43,675) were Enterobacteriaceae were Enterobacteriaceae and glucose fermentative Gram negative bacilli, 32.0% (13,984/43,675) were glucose nonfermentative Gram negative bacilli, and 2.7% (1,200/43,675) were fastidious Gram negative bacilli. (iv) The more common species among the members of Enterobacteriaceae were Escherichia coli 35.7% (10,163/28,490), and Klebsiella pneumoniae 18.2% (5,186/28,490). The other common species included Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens, Morganella morganii, Citrobacter freundii and Proteus vulgaris. The frequencies of Salmonella species and Shigella species in these two large hospitals were up to 1.6% (456/28,490) and 0.5% (149/28,490), respectively. The most common isolate among other glucose fermentative Gram negative bacilli was Aeromonas hydrophila 3.0% (843/28,490). The finding of 0.1% (11/28,490) Vibrio alginolyticus was considered as clinically significant in Taiwan. (v) Of these glucose nonfermentative Gram negative bacilli, 69.4% (9,704/13,984) were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 18.9% (2,637/13,984) Acinetobacter species, 10.8% (1,516/13,984) Pseudomonas species. (vi) The most common bacteria among fastidious Gram negative bacilli was Haemophilus influenzae, 96.2% (1,154/1,200). (vii) Of these Gram negative cocci, 59.4% (60/101) was Neisseria gonorrhoeae and 6.9% (7/101) N. meningitidis. (viii) The more common isolates of Gram positive bacilli included Bacillus species and Corynebacterium species (diphtheroids). (ix) Of these Gram positive cocci, the isolation rates of Staphylococcus species and Streptococcus species were 54.6% (10,838/19,827) and 45.4% (9,002/19,847), respectively. The most common isolate among Gram positive cocci was Staphylococcus aureus, 30.2% (5,994/19,847); the next, enterococcus, 24.9% (4,936/19,847); then S. epidermidis, 22.2% (4,390/19,847). The less common isolates were Streptococcus pyogenes 1.1% (212/19,847) and S. pneumoniae, 1.7% (329/19,847).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of dactimicin in vitro compared with that of dibekacin, netilmicin, sisomicin and micronomicin.
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of dactimicin, a pseudo-disaccharide aminoglycoside antibiotic, was compared with those of dibekacin, netilmicin, sisomicin and micronomicin using clinical isolates of four Gram-positive and sixteen Gram-negative bacteria. Dactimicin was more active than the reference amino-glycosides against Serratia marcescens, especially gentamicin-resistant Serratia sp., Proteus vulgaris, P. rettgeri and Klebsiella oxytoca, but less active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and P. mirabilis. Dactimicin was equally active as the references excepting netilmicin against Gram-positive bacteria and some Gram-negative bacteria including Escherichia coli, K. pneumoniae, Morganella morganii, Haemophilus influenzae, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogens, E. cloacae, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and Campylobacter jejunii. Dactimicin was active against resistant strains possessing various aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes including AAC(3)-1, by which dactimicin was acetylated.
TI  - Antibacterial activities of cefpodoxime, cefixime, and ceftriaxone.
AB  - Cefpodoxime, cefixime, and ceftriaxone inhibited Branhamella catarrhalis at less  than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, beta-hemolytic streptococci at less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml, Neisseria meningitidis at less than or equal to 0.06 microgram/ml, and Haemophilus influenzae (other than beta-lactamase-negative, ampicillin-resistant isolates) at less than or equal to 0.12 microgram/ml. The MICs for 50% of isolates of the family Enterobacteriaceae other than Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Enterobacter cloacae were less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml for all three cephalosporins. The MICs of each cephalosporin for 90% of staphylococci, enterococci, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were greater than 16 micrograms/ml. Inoculum effects were noted with cefpodoxime and cefixime with beta-lactamase-positive H. influenzae.
TI  - [Antibacterial activities of monobactams against fresh clinical isolates].
AB  - Antibacterial activities of monobactam antibiotics (carumonam (CRMN) and aztreonam (AZT] against Gram-negative bacilli isolated from inpatients in the latter half of 1987 were investigated using penicillin (PC: piperacillin (PIPC], cephems (CEPs: ceftazidime (CAZ), cefotaxime (CTX), latamoxef (LMOX), cefsulodin (CFS], carbapenem (imipenem (IPM] and pyridonecarboxylic acids (norfloxacin (NFLX) and ofloxacin (OFLX] as reference antibiotics. A total of 400 strains of 13 species, i.e. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia rettgeri, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Haemophilus influenzae, were used as test strains. 1. CRMN and AZT, both monobactam antibiotics, were roughly comparable in their activities and no resistant strain to these antibiotics were found among isolates of E. coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus spp., M. morganii, P. rettgeri or H. influenzae and few resistant strains were observed among isolates of S. marcescens. On the other hand, isolates of C. freundii, Enterobacter spp. and P. aeruginosa included rather numerous strains resistant to the monobactam antibiotics. Among these cases, whereas R strains, i.e. resistant strains showing MICs greater than or equal to 50 micrograms/ml, accounted for a large proportion of strains resistant to PC and CEPs, I strains, i.e. intermediately resistant strains showing MICs between 12.5 and 25 micrograms/ml, accounted for a large proportion of strains resistant to the monobactam antibiotics. 2. Strains resistant to PIPC, a PC, were detected with high and more or less uniform frequencies over the entire spectrum of the isolates examined. 3. Antibacterial activities of CEPs varied against different bacterial species. While strains resistant to CTX, CAZ and LMOX were commonly detected with high frequencies among isolates of C. freundii, Enterobacter spp. and S. marcescens, large percentages of LMOX-resistant strains of C. freundii and Enterobacter spp. were of the I type. CTX-resistant strains were also found among isolates of P. vulgaris and M. morganii. Proportions of CEP-resistant strains of P. aeruginosa were 28% for CFS and 12% for CAZ. 4. No or few strains among the isolates of 13 species investigated were resistant to IPM, a carbapenem antibiotic, which showed the most stable antibacterial activity, but it was less active than monobactam antibiotics and CEPs against Klebsiella spp., P. mirabilis and H. influenzae.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - In vitro activity of an oral iminomethoxy aminothiazolyl cephalosporin, R-3746.
AB  - The in vitro activity of R-3746, an iminomethoxy aminothiazolyl cephalosporin with a CH2OCH3 moiety at position 3, was compared with those of other antibiotics. R-3746 inhibited the majority of hemolytic streptococci (groups A, B, C, F, and G) and Streptococcus pneumoniae at less than 0.06 micrograms/ml, which was comparable to the activity of amoxicillin, 2- to 8-fold more active than cefixime, and 16- to 64-fold more active than cefaclor and cephalexin. Ninety percent of beta-lactamase-producing Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae were inhibited at a concentration 0.25 micrograms/ml, but it was less active against Branhamella spp. It did not inhibit (MIC, greater than 16 micrograms/ml) enterococci, viridans group streptococci, or methicillin-resistant staphylococci. The MICs of R-3746 for 90% of strains tested for Escherichia coli; Klebsiella pneumoniae; Citrobacter diversus; Proteus mirabilis; and Salmonella, Shigella, and Yersinia spp. were less than or equal to 1 micrograms/ml. It was two- to eightfold less active than cefixime but was markedly superior to cefaclor, cephalexin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, and trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole. R-3746 inhibited 50% of Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Citrobacter freundii, Morganella spp., Providencia spp., Proteus vulgaris, and Serratia marcescens at less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml. Pseudomonas spp. were resistant. Fifty percent of Clostridium spp. were inhibited by 0.5 micrograms/ml, but MICs for Bacteroides spp. were greater than 128 micrograms/ml. R-3746 was not appreciably hydrolyzed by most chromosomal and plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases.
TI  - Enoxacin: in-vitro and animal evaluation as a parenteral and oral agent against hospital bacterial isolates.
AB  - Enoxacin was evaluated in in-vitro tests and in studies of effectiveness and blood concentrations in the mouse. Enoxacin was active against both susceptible and multiresistant hospital isolates of Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae and staphylococci. Less susceptible were streptococci and anaerobes. Of nine quinolones tested, only norfloxacin was equivalent in vitro. The MBCs of enoxacin were one- to twofold greater than the MICs, and enoxacin was rapidly bactericidal. No single-step resistant mutants could be detected at 10 mg/l against large inocula and six to 11 steps were required for selection of resistant clones. In systemic mouse infections, enoxacin was effective in a single oral or subcutaneous dose against one strain each of Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Providencia rettgeri and Ps. aeruginosa, and two Staphylococcus aureus strains. Single oral and subcutaneous enoxacin doses (50 mg/kg) gave peak mouse blood levels of 4.9 and 9.5 mg/l and an elimination half-life of 1.8 h.
TI  - Comparable evaluation of orally active beta-lactam compounds in ampicillin-resistant gram-positive and gram-negative rods: role of beta-lactamases on resistance.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of the recently developed cephems cefixime and cefetamet-pivoxyl was evaluated in 408 gram-positive and gram-negative rods, all isolated recently from clinical specimens, and compared to that of other orally active agents such as ampicillin, amoxycillin + clavulanic acid, cefaclor, cefuroxime-axetil and to ceftriaxone. With regard to ampicillin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae ceftriaxone proved to be the most active agent, followed by cefixime and cefetamet, whereas cefuroxime was less active. Cefaclor and amoxycillin + claculanic acid were active against ampicillin-resistant Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus ssp. isolates. All beta-lactam compounds exhibited poor activity against Acinetobacter anitratus isolates, but were highly active against Haemophilus influenzae with the exception of cefaclor. Both cefixime and cefetamet were poorly active against Staphylococcus aureus, but highly active against beta-hemolytic streptococci. Moreover, both compounds remained unaffected by the production of plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases such as the TEM or OXA enzymes. Resistance to both agents was observed in Enterobacteriaceae that produced large amounts of chromosomally mediated enzymes; their affinity to the class I enzyme from Enterobacter cloacae was somewhat lower than that of other third-generation cephalosporins. However, in contrast with these agents breakdown of cefixime and cefetamet by a class IIIa enzyme form Proteus vulgaris was marginal. In methicillin-resistant S. aureus isolates there was a complete cross-resistance between all beta-lactam compounds included in this study.
TI  - Clinical efficacy of carumonam.
AB  - Carumonam is a new N-sulfo-beta-lactam antibiotic active against aerobic Gram-negative bacteria. An open study was carried out to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerance of carumonam with either 1 g t.i.d. (group A) or 2 g t.i.d. (group B) in bacterial septicaemia or severe sepsis. A total of 24 patients (14 men and 10 women) were included in the study, their ages ranged from 48-87 years (mean age 59). Eighteen patients were treated for bacteraemia, three for bronchopneumonia, two for urinary tract infection and one for a subphrenic abscess; seven were in group A and fourteen in group B; three were treated with a variable regimen. The pathogens isolated included E. coli [10], Klebsiella aerogenes [9], Enterobacter cloacae [3], Citrobacter freundii [2], Pseudomonas spp. [4], Providence stuartii [2], Serratia marcescens [1] and Haemophilus influenzae [1]. Clinical improvement occurred in all patients in both groups. One patient in group A and four patients in group B required further antibiotic therapy. The overall clinical cure rate was 84% and the bacteriological cure rate was 72%. Supra-infection occurred in three patients and adverse reactions attributable to carumonam were seen in two patients: diarrhoea (in one), and aggravation of renal failure in the other. Carumonam is well tolerated at both the dosage regimens; it is effective in the treatment of aerobic Gram-negative sepsis.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. Focusing mainly on ofloxacin (first report). Reported by the Research Group for Testing Ofloxacin Susceptibility of Clinical Isolates].
AB  - Susceptibility tests were carried out on a variety of clinically isolated pathogens using the susceptibility disc method at 197 hospitals in Japan between May, 1985 through March, 1986. These tests were organized by the Research Group for Testing Ofloxacin Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates, and the results were statistically analyzed. This paper describes a comparison of susceptibilities of clinical isolates including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Serratia marcescens, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp. and Campylobacter jejuni to ofloxacin (OFLX) and conventional antibacterial drugs. The results obtained were summarized as follows. 1. OFLX showed strong antibacterial activity against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, E. aerogenes, E. cloacae, C. freundii, K. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, H. influenzae, A. calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp. and C. jejuni and only a few strains were resistant to OFLX. Moreover, OFLX has superior antibacterial activity against many species compared not only to norfloxacin but also to most of the conventional antibacterial drugs. 2. When studied by sampled materials such as sputum, urine, abscesses and otorrhea, OFLX occasionally showed different actions against the same species from different sources. Almost species from the urinary isolates were less sensitive than those from the sputum.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of CGP 31608, a new penem antibiotic.
AB  - The in vitro activity of a new penem antimicrobial agent, CGP 31608, was compared with those of imipenem, SCH 34343, and several other antimicrobial agents against approximately 600 bacterial isolates. CGP 31608 was active against gram-positive organisms, including methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MIC for 90% of the isolates [MIC90], 0.25 microgram/ml) and penicillin-susceptible streptococci (MIC90s, less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml). Penicillin-resistant streptococci (including enterococci) and methicillin-resistant S. aureus were more resistant to the penem. Activities of CGP 31608 against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae were remarkably uniform, with MIC90s of 8 to 16 micrograms/ml. CGP 31608 was at least as active as imipenem and ceftazidime and more active than piperacillin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Drug activity was not influenced by the presence of any of 10 plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases. Against strains of Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, and P. aeruginosa with derepressible chromosomally mediated beta-lactamases, the presence of cefoxitin did not induce increased resistance to CGP 31608. The new drug was also active against anaerobes (MIC90s, 0.25 to 8 micrograms/ml), Haemophilus influenzae (MIC90s, 0.5 to 1.0 micrograms/ml), and Legionella spp. (MIC90, 2 micrograms/ml). CGP 31608 showed an antibacterial spectrum similar to those of imipenem and SCH 34343 (except that the latter is not active against P. aeruginosa) but was generally less potent than these drugs. However, CGP 31608 demonstrated more activity (MIC90) than imipenem against P. aeruginosa, Pseudomonas cepacia, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis and S. aureus.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of a new monobactam, B0-1165.
AB  - B0-1165 is a 1-carboxy-1-cyclopropoxyamino,4-fluoromethyl monobactam. It inhibited the majority of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Citrobacter diversus, Aeromonas hydrophila, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Providencia rettgeri, Providencia stuartii, Yersinia enterocolitica, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Salmonella and Shigella species at less than or equal to 0.125 microgram/ml. Overall, its in vitro activity was similar to that of aztreonam, cefotaxime, and ceftazidime, with minor differences in the MICs for individual isolates. Enterobacter species and Citrobacter freundii which were derepressed for beta-lactamase production and had higher MICs of aztreonam and ceftazidime had MICs that ranged from 4 to 32 micrograms/ml. B0-1165 had activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa similar to that of aztreonam but lower than that of ceftazidime and carumonam. Pseudomonas maltophilia and other Pseudomonas species were resistant or had MICs of 32 micrograms/ml, as did Acinetobacter species. B0-1165 did not inhibit streptococcal, staphylococcal, or anaerobic species, such as Clostridium and Bacteroides species. B0-1165 was not hydrolyzed to any appreciable extent by common plasmid- and chromosomally Richmond-Sykes type 1a-, 1c-, and 1d-mediated beta-lactamases. It inhibited the Enterobacter cloacae P99 and inducible Pseudomonas aeruginosa beta-lactamases. B0-1165 was a poor inducer of beta-lactamase, but exposing E. cloacae and C. freundii to B0-1165 selected for resistant isolates. Overall, B0-1165 had in vitro properties similar to those of other monobactams currently available or under investigation.
TI  - In vitro activity of RO 15-8074 and RO 19-5247.
AB  - The in vitro activity of RO 15-8074 (cefetamet) and RO 19-5247, new oral cephalosporins, was compared with that of amoxicillin, cephalexin, cefaclor, cefuroxime and erythromycin against 292 clinical isolates using the agar dilution method. Both RO 15-8074 and RO 19-5247 were very active against Proteus mirabilis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pyogenes, but less active against Staphylococcus saprophyticus and Enterobacter cloacae. RO 19-5247 was more active than RO 15-8074 against Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus viridans.
TI  - In vitro activity of Ro 15-8074 and Ro 19-5247 in comparison to cefaclor and cefalexin.
AB  - 805 clinical isolates were investigated for their in vitro sensitivity against Ro 15-8074 and Ro 19-5247 in comparison to cefaclor and cefalexin in a serial dilution test on solid medium. Ro 19-5247 had the strongest activity of all drugs tested against streptococci (except Streptococcus faecalis) and was as active as cefaclor and cefalexin against most strains of Staphylococcus aureus. Ro 19-5247 was the only oral cephalosporin active against Bordetella pertussis. It was on average 160 times more active than cefaclor against Haemophilus influenzae. In its activity against enterobacteria Ro 19-5247 was always superior to cefaclor and cefalexin. Only a few strains of Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris and Serratia marcescens were resistant to Ro 19-5247 as were all strains of Enterobacter agglomerans and Klebsiella ozaenae. Ro 15-8074 was inactive against staphylococci but ten times more active than cefaclor and cefalexin against Streptococcus pyogenes. There was no difference in the activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus agalactiae. Against Haemophilus influenzae Ro 15-8074 acted 12 times stronger than cefaclor and 100 times stronger than cefalexin. The activity against enterobacteria corresponded to that of Ro 19-5247. Ro 15-8074 was also active against most strains of Enterobacter cloacae and Proteus vulgaris which were resistant to cefaclor and cefalexin.
TI  - In vitro activity of two new aryl-fluoroquinolone antimicrobial agents, difloxacin (A-56619) and A-56620 compared to that of other antimicrobial agents.
AB  - The in vitro activity of difloxacin (A-56619) and A-56620, two new aryl-difluoroquinolones, was compared to that of other new quinolones and several parenteral and oral antimicrobial agents. A-56620 inhibited 90% of Enterobacteriaceae at less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, Staphylococcus aureus 0.25 micrograms/ml, hemolytic streptococci 2 micrograms/ml, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 2 micrograms/ml, Bacteroides sp. and Clostridium at 8 micrograms/ml. A-56620 was equal or 2-fold more active than norfloxacin and ofloxacin, and 2-8-fold less active than ciprofloxacin. Difloxacin had similar in vitro activity with many isolates but usually was 2-8-fold less active than A-56620. Both agents inhibited beta-lactamase positive Haemophilus influenzae (MIC 0.015 micrograms/ml) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (MK less than or equal to 0.008 micrograms/ml). Both agents were more active against streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae than norfloxacin, ofloxacin and enoxacin, but not more active than ciprofloxacin. They inhibited Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii and Serratia marcescens resistant to cephalosporins and methicillin-resistant S. aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Spontaneously resistant mutants were seen with Enterobacteriaceae, P. aeruginosa and S. aureus at a frequency similar to that found for other new quinolones. These agents show overall in vitro activity comparable to other quinolones in clinical trial or recently approved for clinical use.
TI  - Efficacy and tolerance of oral ofloxacin in treating various infections.
AB  - 66 patients were given daily doses of ofloxacin between 400 and 800 mg for 10 days to 6 months. They were suffering from exacerbation of chronic bronchitis (15), soft tissue phlegmon (11), complicated urinary tract infections (7), bronchopneumonia (7), chronic osteomyelitis in exacerbation (8), chronic prostatitis in exacerbation (5), lower urinary tract infections (3), chronic otitis media (3), acute otitis (3), acute bronchitis (1), lung abscess (2) or liver abscess (1). Pathogens included Pseudomonas aeruginosa (24), Haemophilus influenzae (16), Proteus mirabilis (6), Escherichia coli (6), Enterobacter cloacae (6), Providencia stuartii (2), Serratia marcescens (2), Citrobacter diversus (1), Salmonella enteritidis (1), Acinetobacter anitratus (1), Staphylococcus aureus (1) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (1). In 35 patients (53%), several aggravating factors coexisted. MICs of ofloxacin ranged from less than or equal to 0.06 to 2 mg/L. Clinically, 65% of the patients were considered as cured, 17% improved and 18% failed to respond. Bacteriologically, pathogens were eradicated in 62%, persisted in 16% and relapsed in 22%. Adverse reactions included gastrointestinal disturbances (4), rash plus facial oedema (1), abnormal liver function (2) and leucopenia (1).
TI  - Evaluation of imipenem/cilastatin against nosocomial infections and multiresistant pathogens.
AB  - Thirty-five patients suffering from soft tissue infections (12), upper UTIs (6),  bronchopneumonia (6), septicaemia (2), chronic osteomyelitis (2), intra-abdominal abscess (2), liver abscess (1), lung abscess (1), acute cholangitis (1), thoracic empyema (1) and chronic prostatitis (1) were given imipenem/cilastatin for 6-21 days. In 22 patients several aggravating factors coexisted, while infection in 16 patients was polymicrobial. The following pathogens were implicated: Pseudomonas aeruginosa (21), Escherichia coli (15), Enterobacter cloacae (6), Proteus spp. (3), Klebsiella pneumoniae(3), Citrobacter freundii (1), Salmonella enteritidis (1), Acinetobacter spp. (4), Haemophilus influenzae (2), Bacteroides fragilis (1) and Peptococcus saccharolyticus (1) with MICs to imipenem ranging between 0.5 and 8 mg/l. A successful clinical response was observed in 91.4% of the patients, while pathogens were eradicated in 75.9%, persisted in 24.2% and recurred, in 9.1% of patients, with development of resistance to imipenem in two Ps. aeruginosa strains. Against 150 multiresistant strains of Ps. aeruginosa, 40% of which were resistant to amikacin, 86.4% and 88.9% were found sensitive to ceftazidime and imipenem respectively. It is concluded that imipenem provides the possibility of treating successfully multiresistant and polymicrobial infections with a single antimicrobial.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of two oral cephalosporins, ceftetrame (Ro 19-5247) and cefetamet (Ro 15-8074).
AB  - Ceftetrame (Ro 19-5247) and cefetamet (Ro 15-8074), two new orally administered aminothiazolyl imimomethoxy cephalosporins, inhibited hemolytic streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae at less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms/ml but were less active against staphylococci than were cephalexin and cefaclor. They did not inhibit S. faecalis, S. faecium, Listeria monocytogenes, Corynebacterium JK species, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, including ampicillin-resistant isolates, were inhibited at less than 0.25 micrograms/ml. Both agents inhibited Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella species, Shigella species, Citrobacter diversus, and Aeromonas hydrophila resistant to ampicillin, cephalexin, and cefaclor at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, although many isolates of Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, and Serratia marcescens resistant to cefotaxime were not inhibited by these agents. A marked inoculum effect was noted for Enterobacteriaceae carrying the Richmond-Sykes type 1A chromosomally mediated beta-lactamases, but plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases did not hydrolyze the compounds. Both drugs inhibited the chromosomally mediated beta-lactamase of E. cloacae, P99.
TI  - In-vitro activity of ticarcillin with and without clavulanic acid against clinical isolates of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of ticarcillin with and without clavulanic acid was investigated against 285 freshly isolated clinical strains of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria by the agar-dilution technique on Mueller-Hinton-agar. Clavulanic acid had an excellent or moderate potentiating effect on the in-vitro activity of ticarcillin against staphylococci, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter spp., Acinetobacter, Haemophilus influenzae and Bacteroides spp. No effect was seen against enterococci, indole-positive Proteus spp., Ent. cloacae, Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The effect of clavulanic acid was dose- and inoculum-dependent.
TI  - The activity of BMY 28142 a new broad spectrum beta-lactamase stable cephalosporin.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of BMY 28142, an iminomethoxy, aminothiazolyl cephalosporin containing a methyl pyrrolidinio C-3 was compared with that of cefotaxime, ceftazidime, aztreonam, imipenem and tobramycin against various bacteria. BMY 28142 was the most active agent tested against the Enterobacteriaceae inhibiting 90% at less than or equal to 1 mg/l. The in-vitro activity of BMY 28142 was equal to or superior to cefotaxime against the highly susceptible members of the Enterobacteriaceae and several-fold superior to ceftazidime and aztreonam. BMY 28142 inhibited many Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii and Serratia marcescens resistant to cefotaxime, ceftazidime and aztreonam. BMY 28142 was more active than imipenem against Proteus, Providencia and Morganella species. Ceftazidime and imipenem were more active than BMY 28142 against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but it inhibited piperacillin and tobramycin-resistant isolates. BMY 28142 inhibited beta-lactamase producing Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. BMY 28142 was more active than ceftazidime against streptococcal and staphylococcal species, but it did not inhibit or kill most methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. BMY 28142 did not inhibit most Bacteroides species. BMY 28142 was not hydrolyzed by common plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases, but it bound poorly to Enterobacter beta-lactamase, was a poor inhibitor of the TEM plasmid beta-lactamase and was a poor inducer of beta-lactamases.
TI  - In-vitro activity of newer quinolones against aerobic bacteria.
AB  - Nalidixic and five newer 4-quinolones, ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin and pefloxacin were tested against 576 recent clinical aerobic bacterial isolates. The 4-quinolones were regularly active (MIC90 less than 4 mg/l) against the following bacteria: Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, S. saprophyticus, different Enterobacteriaceae, Haemophilus influenzae, Campylobacter jejuni, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Agrobacter spp., Aeromonas spp., Plesiomonas spp., Neisseria meningitidis. Other bacteria were usually intermediately susceptible or resistant: different streptococci, Listeria monocytogenes, Nocardia asteroides, P. maltophilia, Achromobacter xylosoxydans and Alcaligenes denitrificans. Ciprofloxacin was the most potent compound, followed by ofloxacin and pefloxacin, norfloxacin and enoxacin being less active. All the 4-quinolones were much more active than nalidixic acid. The MBC/MIC ratios of the 4-quinolones were between 1 and 2 with a majority of strains, and between 2 and 3 with Streptococcus agalactiae, Str. faecalis and L. monocytogenes. A two- to eight-fold increase of MIC was observed by increasing the inoculum 10,000-fold with most of the strains tested. Susceptible bacterial population of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens and P. aeruginosa contained more clones resistant to nalidixic acid (10(4) to 10(8) at four times the MIC) than to 4-quinolones (10(5) to 10(9) at four times the MIC). Supplementing the media with MgSO4 produced smaller inhibition zone diameters with a disc diffusion method than those obtained with non-supplemented agar, with all quinolone or strains. Less regular effect, or no effect was obtained after supplementation with ZnSO4 or Ca(NO3)2.
TI  - Susceptibility of gram-negative bacteria to the synergistic bactericidal action of serum and polymyxin B nonapeptide.
AB  - Polymyxin B nonapeptide was able to sensitize Escherichia coli strains and strains of Salmonella typhimurium, Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Haemophilus influenzae to the bactericidal action of fresh normal human serum. The degree of sensitization varied significantly within the strains. Strains of Proteus mirabilis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and N. meningitidis remained resistant.
TI  - Lower respiratory tract infection.
AB  - The most important lower respiratory infection is pneumonia, the fourth leading cause of death. Most cases of bronchitis are of viral etiology and are not major problems. Empyema can present an important problem in management. Although the diagnosis of pneumonia is usually relatively straightforward, the specific etiologic diagnosis remains a major problem. Availability of empyema fluid or a positive blood culture result can be helpful in making the etiologic diagnosis, but these are unavailable in most patients. Screening of sputum Gram stains under 100 X magnification is very important; there should be fewer than 10 squamous epithelial cells, more than 25 polymorphonuclear leukocytes, or both per field of this size. The major causes of pneumonia are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, anaerobic bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus, various gram-negative aerobic or facultative bacilli and Legionella. However, many other organisms are capable of causing pneumonia, even in the immunocompetent host. Further adding to the problem is the fact that a number of different organisms are manifesting increasing resistance to antimicrobial agents. Our study with ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid included seven patients with pneumonia, one with empyema, and one with purulent tracheobronchitis. Organisms recovered from pleural fluid, transtracheal aspiration and sputum or tracheostomy aspirate included multiple anaerobes, pneumococci, S. aureus, Hemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. ozaenae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, beta-hemolytic streptococci, Neisseria meningitidis and Branhamella catarrhalis. Several of the organisms were ticarcillin resistant. Eight of the patients had cures and the other patient showed improvement. Only minor side-effects were encountered--Coombs' positivity (without hemolysis), eosinophilia, drug fever and one case of questionable neutropenia.
TI  - The pharmacokinetic and bactericidal characteristics of oral cefixime.
AB  - The pharmacokinetics of cefixime (FK 027), a broad-spectrum cephalosporin, were assessed in 12 normal subjects after single oral doses of 50, 100, 200, and 400 mg. Mean peak serum concentrations were 1.02, 1.46, 2.63, and 3.85 micrograms/ml after the four respective doses. Respective mean serum levels at 12 hours were 0.16, 0.33, 0.72, and 1.13 micrograms/ml. Volumes of distribution averaged 0.1 L/kg body weight, and the elimination t1/2 was 3 hours for all doses. The AUC was 7.01, 11.4, 22.5, and 36.4 micrograms X hr/ml for the four doses, respectively. Serum clearance averaged 0.4 mg/min/kg and mean 24-hour urinary recovery was 21%, 19%, 20%, and 16% for the four respective doses. Serum bactericidal titers at 4 hours exceeded 1:16 for Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, Hemophilus influenzae, and Branhamella catarrhalis. Urine bactericidal titers exceeded 1:8 for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterobacter cloacae resistant to the available oral cephalosporins.
TI  - The activity and beta-lactamase stability of cefotetan compared to other beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  - The in vitro activity of cefotetan was assessed against beta-lactamase producing  clinical isolates. The majority of Enterobacteriaceae were inhibited by less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml with 50% of isolates inhibited by less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml. Cefotetan inhibited organisms resistant to cefazolin, cefonicid and cefoperazone, but not isolates of Enterobacter, Citrobacter or Serratia resistant to ceftizoxime. Cefotetan inhibited beta-lactamase producing Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae at less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, but it did not inhibit Acinetobacter or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Cefotetan was as active as cefoxitin against anaerobic species such as Bacteroides fragilis and Clostridium. Cefotetan was not hydrolyzed by Richmond-Sykes plasmid beta-lactamases of type III such as TEM and SHV, nor by the OXA or PSE beta-lactamases. It also was not hydrolyzed by cephalosporinases of Richmond-Sykes type Ia or Id. Cefotetan inhibited beta-lactamases of the type Ia and Id, but it also induced these beta-lactamases in P. aeruginosa, E. cloacae and C. freundii.
TI  - Sch 34343: in-vitro antibacterial activity and susceptibility to beta-lactamases.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of the penem Sch 34343 was assessed in comparison with third-generation cephalosporins, aztreonam and imipenem. Sch 34343 was active, with MICs generally 2 mg/1 or less, against a broad spectrum of organisms amongst which were staphylococci (including methicillin-resistant strains), streptococci (though enterococci were less susceptible with Sch 34343 MICs mostly 4-8 mg/1), anaerobes (including the Bacteroides fragilis group), Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. It was also active against the Enterobacteriaceae though Enterobacter cloacae and Serratia spp. were somewhat less susceptible than other members of this group. Sch 34343 lacked useful activity against most species of Pseudomonas (including Ps. aeruginosa) but was active against Ps. acidovorans and some isolates of Ps. cepacia. Sch 34343 showed a high degree of resistance to plasmid-determined and most chromosomally-determined beta-lactamases; however, it was hydrolysed rapidly by enzymes from some isolates of Aeromonas hydrophila and more slowly by enzymes from Ps. maltophilia and Bact. melaninogenicus subspecies intermedius. We did not observe any reduction in sensitivity to Sch 34343 for most beta-lactamase-producing organisms, including strains of Enterobacter spp. and Citrobacter freundii that were resistant to most other beta-lactams.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of carumonam (AMA-1080), a new N-sulfonated monocyclic beta-lactam antibiotic.
AB  - The in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of carumonam (AMA-1080), a synthetic sulfazecin derivative, were compared with those of aztreonam, cefoperazone, ceftazidime, and cefsulodin. Carumonam was highly active in vitro against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Haemophilus influenzae and weakly active against Streptococcus pneumoniae, but it was not active against Staphylococcus aureus. The MICs of carumonam for 90% of 1,156 clinical Enterobacteriaceae isolates were between 0.013 and 25 micrograms/ml, which were the lowest MICs of the antibiotics tested. The MIC of carumonam for 90% of Klebsiella oxytoca was 0.2 micrograms/ml, whereas that of aztreonam was 50 micrograms/ml. The superiority of carumonam to aztreonam and the reference cephalosporins was also demonstrated by their activities against Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae. The MIC of carumonam for 90% of P. aeruginosa was 12.5 micrograms/ml, which was comparable to the MICs of aztreonam and ceftazidime. Carumonam showed a high affinity for the penicillin-binding protein 3 of gram-negative bacteria, but not for the penicillin-binding proteins of S. aureus and Bacteroides fragilis. Carumonam was resistant to hydrolysis by 12 plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases and 7 chromosomal beta-lactamases. It was more stable than aztreonam to hydrolysis by the beta-lactamase of K. oxytoca; this stability is related to the superiority of the in vitro and in vivo activities of carumonam to those of aztreonam against this species. In general, the protective activities (50% effective dose) of carumonam and reference antibiotics in mice with experimental intraperitoneal infections correlated with the in vitro activities (MIC); carumonam showed excellent protective activity against most aerobic gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - In vitro studies on the antibacterial activities of YM-13115, a new broad-spectrum cephalosporin.
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activities of YM-13115, a new parenteral cephalosporin, were compared with those of ceftazidime, cefoperazone, and cefsulodin. The compound was highly active against the common members of the Enterobacteriaceae and 2 to 256 times more active than cefoperazone. YM-13115 was as active as ceftazidime against Citrobacter freundii, Proteus vulgaris, and Morganella morganii and two to four times more active than ceftazidime against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia rettgeri, and Providencia stuartii. The activity of YM-13115 against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (with MICs of 0.78 and 3.13 micrograms/ml for 50 and 90% of the isolates, respectively) was ca. 2 times that of ceftazidime, 4 times that of cefsulodin, and 16 times that of cefoperazone. Against Haemophilus influenzae YM-13115 was more active than ceftazidime. YM-13115 was less active than ceftazidime, cefoperazone, and cefsulodin against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. The concentrations of YM-13115 required to inhibit the growth of 90% of the isolates of Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae were 0.78 and 1.56 microgram/ml, respectively, but concentrations above 100 micrograms/ml were required to inhibit Streptococcus faecalis. YM-13115 was not hydrolyzed by the common plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases. YM-13115 is extremely active against P. aeruginosa and members of the Enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo activities of DN-9550, a new broad-spectrum cephalosporin.
AB  - DN-9550 [(6R, 7R)-7-[(Z)-2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-2-(1H-imidazol-4-yl) methoxyiminoacetamido]-3-[(1-pyridinio)methyl]-8-oxo-5-thia -1-azabicyclo methyl]-8-oxo-5-thia-1-azabicyclo[4.2.0]oct-2-ene-2-carboxylate hydrochloride] is a new semisynthetic cephalosporin with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. The activity of DN-9550 against most species of the family Enterobacteriaceae was roughly comparable to that of ceftazidime, slightly lower than that of cefotaxime, and far exceeded that of cefoperazone. Against Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, and Serratia marcescens, DN-9550 was more active than ceftazidime and cefotaxime. DN-9550 and ceftazidime were significantly more active than cefotaxime against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but DN-9550 and cefotaxime were clearly more active than ceftazidime against staphylococci and streptococci. Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae were also highly susceptible to DN-9550, but Bacteroides fragilis was generally not susceptible to the compound. DN-9550 was stable to various types of beta-lactamases and had high affinities for penicillin-binding protein 3 of both Escherichia coli and P. aeruginosa. When DN-9550 was administered subcutaneously to mice experimentally infected with Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa, its efficacy well reflected its in vitro potency.
TI  - Assessment of head-space gas-liquid chromatography for the rapid detection of growth in blood cultures.
AB  - Blood for transfusion was inoculated with between 10(0) and 10(2) colony-forming  units (CFU) per ml of each of 59 microbial isolates and added to cooked meat broth. At intervals up to 72 h incubation, the cultures were examined by conventional visual inspection and automated head-space gas-liquid chromatography (HS-GLC). Forty-six isolates including all those examined of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, S. faecalis, S. milleri, S. mitior, S. mitis, S. salivarius, S. sanguis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Serratia sp., Enterobacter cloacae, Bacterioides fragilis, Clostridium perfringens, Candida albicans, C. krusei and Torulopsis glabrata, and three isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis, were detected by HS-GLC. HS-GLC failed to detect the growth of eleven isolates including all those of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. Haemophilus influenzae, Corynebacterium sp. and two isolates of S. epidermidis. The growth of all 59 isolates were detected by visual inspection. No significant difference was found between HS-GLC analysis and visual inspection in the speed of detection of bacterial isolates. All the yeast isolates were detected by HS-GLC after 24 h incubation, indicating that it may be possible to detect fungemias earlier by HS-GLC analysis than by other methods.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of FR 17027, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  - FR 17027, a new orally absorbed cephalosporin ester, inhibited group A and B streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae at less than or equal to 0.1 micrograms/ml, which is similar to the inhibition concentration of amoxicillin and cefaclor, and was more active than cephalexin. It was less active (MIC, 25 micrograms/ml) against staphylococci than was cephalexin, and it did not inhibit Streptococcus faecalis or Listeria monocytogenes. FR 17027 inhibited beta-lactamase-producing isolates of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Branhamella catarrhalis at less than 0.1 micrograms/ml and was more active than cefaclor or cephalexin against these bacteria. FR 17027 inhibited Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella oxytoca, Providencia stuartii, Providencia rettgeri, and Citrobacter diversus at less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, including isolated resistant to amoxicillin, cephalexin, and cefaclor, but it was less active than ceftizoxime. Some strains of Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter agglomerans, Citrobacter freundii, and Enterobacter aerogenes were resistant (MIC, greater than 25 micrograms/ml). FR 17027 did not inhibit Pseudomonas aeruginosa, other Pseudomonas species, Acinetobacter species, or Bacteroides species. Activity was minimally affected by growth conditions. FR 17027 was not hydrolyzed by the common beta-lactamases present in many of the pathogens causing respiratory and urinary tract infections in outpatients.
TI  - Temocillin: in vitro activity against 734 selected clinical isolates, including beta-lactamase-producing strains.
AB  - The in vitro activity of temocillin against 734 clinical isolates was tested by broth microdilution. Good activity was demonstrated against Enterobacteriaceae and both beta-lactamase-positive and -negative strains of Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. There was little to no activity against gram-positive cocci and nonfermenting gram-negative bacilli. Bactericidal activity and effect of inoculum size on temocillin activity were comparable to that of ticarcillin. Temocillin was stable to commonly encountered beta-lactamases and significantly inhibited Richmond-Sykes type 1 enzymes of Enterobacter cloacae.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of the BACTEC resin-containing blood culture bottle.
AB  - The BACTEC resin-containing blood culture bottle (16B; Johnston Laboratories) was designed to bind antibiotics and to support bacterial growth. However, only modest increases in the recovery rates of pathogens have been found in clinical studies. This in vitro study evaluated the ability of the 16B to recover organisms from human serum containing clinically achievable concentrations of antibiotics. Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, and a viridans streptococcus were added to serum containing antibiotic(s), and at various time intervals of antibiotic exposure, portions were removed and inoculated into both the 16B and the 6B (conventional aerobic) bottles. The studies of the kinetics of killing of the bacterial strains by the various antibiotics showed a good correlation between those combinations of bacteria-antibiotic(s) which produced slow killing and the combinations of bacteria-antibiotic(s) which were recovered preferentially in the 16B bottles. Low recovery rates were noted when the antibiotics killed the organisms rapidly. The indications for use of the resin-containing blood culture bottle should be limited to those situations in which the patient is receiving antibiotics and the bacteremia is suspected to involve a pathogen which is killed slowly by the administered drug(s) or when the bacteremia is continuous. The failure of the BACTEC 16B blood culture bottle to recover organisms may in part reflect the bactericidal activity of the antibiotics administered.
TI  - Hydrogen peroxide-mediated antagonism against serratia marcescens by Streptococcus mitis.
AB  - The alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus mitis strain no. 17-1, isolated from the oral cavity of an healthy female adult, antagonized the growth of all 24 test strains of Serratia marcescens examined; furthermore, this strain inhibited the growth of various strains of Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, S. agalactiae, S. pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Listeria monocytogenes, and Corynebacterium diphtheriae. However, strans of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa proved refractory. The mechanism of microbial antagonism was due to production and release of hydrogen peroxide under aerobic atmospheric conditions, which was neutralized through incorporation of bovine liver catalase into the solid assay medium.
TI  - [The antibacterial activity of new cephem antibiotics against clinical isolates.  A comparison of the antibacterial activity of cefotaxime with 6 other antibiotics].
AB  - During the period from May through July 1981, a comparative study was carried out on the antibacterial activities of cefotaxime (CTX) and ceftizoxime (CZX), cefoperazone (CPZ), latamoxef (LMOX), cefotiam (CTM), cefmetazole (CMZ) and cefazolin (CEZ). CTX and these other cephem antibiotics were tested against fresh clinical isolates which had been obtained from clinical materials by the laboratories of 14 participating medical institutions. 1. The clinical isolates were obtained from various clinical materials in the following decreasing order: urine, sputum and pus/discharge; 85.7% of the isolates came from these materials. 2. Concerning the sources of each species of clinical isolates, it was found that P. aeruginosa was isolated from the greatest number -9- of different clinical materials. This was followed by E. coli and E. cloacae, each isolated from 8 different clinical materials, and C. freundii and E. aerogenes, each found in 7 different clinical materials. 3. In relation to S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae and S. pneumoniae, CTX showed the best antibacterial activity; the second most potent antibiotic was CZX. CMZ and LMOX were found to show relatively high MIC values for those species. Against S. aureus, CEZ showed the best antibacterial activity, but 3 resistant strains had MICs of greater than 100 micrograms/ml. 4. With regard to Gram-negative bacteria, CTX and CZX showed the best antibacterial activities for all of the species, except for P. aeruginosa. These were followed, in order, by LMOX and CPZ. Compared with these 4 antibiotics, CTM, CMZ and CEZ were found to have inferior antibacterial activities against these bacteria. In relation to P. aeruginosa, the peak of the MIC distribution for CPZ was 6.25 micrograms/ml, and this was the best antibacterial activity detected with the various antibiotics tested. This was followed by CTX (25 micrograms/ml) LMOX (25 micrograms/ml) and CZX (50 micrograms/ml). CTM had an MIC of 100 micrograms/ml for 1 strain, and MICs of greater than 100 micrograms/ml for all of the other strains of P. aeruginosa, indicating them to be resistant to this antibiotic. All of the strains were resistant to CMZ and CEZ, showing MICs of greater than 100 micrograms/ml. 5. For each of the tested antibiotics, no correlation was found between the MIC and the serogroup for either P. aeruginosa or S. marcescens.
TI  - Comparative activity of cefotaxime and selected beta-lactam antibiotics against Haemophilus influenzae and aerobic gram-negative bacilli.
AB  - The activity of cefotaxime was compared with that of ampicillin, moxalactam, and  cefoperozone against 50 isolates of Haemophilus influenzae and with that of ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalothin, cefoxitin, cefamandole, cefazolin, and several other established and investigational beta-lactam antibiotics against several hundred isolates of gram-negative aerobic enteric bacilli. Minimal inhibitory concentrations of the drugs were determined by the agar plate dilution technique for H. influenzae and by the microtiter broth dilution technique for the other pathogens. Cefotaxime was the most active agent against H. influenzae; it was 20 times more active than ampicillin. It was also the most active agent against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, nontyphoid Salmonella species, and Yersinia enterocolitica. Cefotaxime was among the most active agents against Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter species, Shigella species, Proteus mirabilis, and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. None of the new cephalosporins or penicillin inhibited greater than 90% of the isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa at concentrations of less than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml; these drugs were, however, more active than carbenicillin.
TI  - [Haemophilus parainfluenza infection followed by Enterobacter cloacae infection in a newborn].
AB  
TI  - Rapid differentiation of bacterial meningitides by direct gas-liquid chromatography.
AB  - Rapid identification of Haemophilus influenzae and other bacillary meningitides was attempted by gas-liquid chromatography (GLC) of the metabolic by-products in broth cultures and in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples obtained from experimental meningitis produced in New Zealand White male rabbits. These results were correlated with the GLC of CSF of meningitis patients. A major peak with retention time of succinic acid was found in the broth cultures of all bacilli tested including H. influenzae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter freundii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Listeria monocytogenes. Succinic acid was also found in the CSF of experimental meningitis and in the CSF of all patients with H. influenzae and Esch. coli meningitis. This peak was not detected in the blood samples of experimental animals. It was also absent in the broth cultures of all of the gram-positive and gram-negative cocci tested, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and Neisseria meningitidis. Succinic acid, which appears to be a by product of fermentation, persisted as a clear cut marker in H. influenzae meningitis for at least 3 d after the initiation of treatment. In one patient, the succinic acid peak disappeared during treatment and reappeared with a clinical relapse. Clearly, the presence of succinic acid that can be rapidly detected by GLC in the CSF excludes pneumococcal or meningococcal meningitis and strongly suggests H. influenzae or other bacillary meningitides.
TI  - Efficacy of ceftriaxone in serious bacterial infections.
AB  - Ceftriaxone is a new semisynthetic cephalosporin with broad-spectrum in vitro activity and an unusually long serum half-life. The clinical efficacy of ceftriaxone was evaluated in 35 infections in 34 patients; 12 of these patients had skin and soft tissue infections, 10 had infections of the urinary tract, 8 had pneumonia, 2 had biliary tract infections, 1 had sinusitis, 1 had diverticulitis, and 1 had a retroperitoneal abscess. Of the 35 infections, 9 were bacteremic. The bacteria isolated included Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus faecalis, other streptococcal species, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacteroides fragilis, other Bacteroides species, and anaerobic cocci. Improvement or cure occurred in 32 episodes, for a response rate of 91%. There were three treatment failures in patients with soft tissue infections. No serious drug toxicities were observed. At a dosage regimen of 1 g every 12 h the peak and trough serum antibiotic concentrations were well above the minimal inhibitory concentrations of most pathogens. Our findings suggest that ceftriaxone is a safe and effective antibiotic for therapy of serious bacterial infections.
TI  - Clinical efficacy of cefotaxime in serious infections.
AB  - Thirty-five patients underwent 38 treatment courses with cefotaxime. Documented infections included 11 bacteremias, 7 cases of nosocomial pneumonia, 6 surgical wound infections, 3 bone infections, 1 biliary infection, and 1 urinary tract infection. Granulocytopenic patients with fever received 15 courses of empiric cefotaxime therapy alone; in 8 courses, no definite site of infection or pathogen was isolated. Broad-spectrum antibiotics had been administered to 23 patients before cefotaxime. Thirty-seven bacterial pathogens were isolated from 25 patients. Three such pathogens were resistant to cefotaxime and required alternative therapies. Pathogenic isolates included 13 Serratia marcescens, 12 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4 Escherichia coli, 2 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 2 Providencia stuartii, 1 Enterobacter cloacae, 1 Haemophilus influenzae, 1 Enterococcus, and 1 Staphylococcus aureus. Of the treatment courses, 25 of 38 resulted in a favorable response to cefotaxime, including 9 of 15 in granulocytopenic patients. Superinfection was seen in one patient. The emergence of resistance was documented in another patient. Of 15 patients with multiply resistant pathogens, 12 improved with cefotaxime. Of 12 patients with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 6 favorably responded. Possible complications of cefotaxime were observed in 14 of 42 treatment courses. Cefotaxime is most useful in treatment of infections due to multiply resistant, gram-negative pathogens other than Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - Ceftazidime, a pseudomonas-active cephalosporin: in-vitro antimicrobial activity  evaluation including recommendations for disc diffusion susceptibility tests.
AB  - The in-vitro qualities of ceftazidime, as compared to other beta-lactams and three other antimicrobials (amikacin, gentamicin and chloramphenicol), were evaluated in a multilaboratory, multiphasic study in the United States. A total of 12,986 recent clinical isolates were tested by reference dilution methods in six medical centres over 45-60 days. Ceftazidime was superior to the comparison cephalosporin (cefamandole) and comparable in spectrum and activity to gentamicin against Enterobacteriaceae. Of 8038 enteric bacilli tested, over 98% had CTAZ MICs < or = 8 mg/l with a mode of < or = 0.12 mg/l. Only Citrobacter freundii and Enterobacter aerogenes had ceftazidime MIC(90S) in the resistant range ( > or =32 mg/l). Staphylococcus aureus strains were less susceptible to ceftazidime (mode MIC 8 mg/l) compared to cefamandole or gentamicin. Ceftazidime was more effective than cefamandole or gentamicin against the beta-haemolytic streptococci and the pneumococcus. More than 90% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, most other Pseudomonas spp. and Acinetobacter spp. were inhibited by ceftazidime at concentrations of 8 mg/l. In other comparative studies ceftazidime was found remarkably similar in spectrum to cefotaxime, cefoperazone and moxalactam against the Enterobacteriaceae, staphylococci and Streptococcus spp. Enterobacter cloacae was the only enteric species having ceftazidime MIC90 >8 mg/l. Only cefsulodin (mode MIC 2 mg/l) and cefoperazone (mode MIC 4 mg/l) shared the ceftazidime activity against Ps. aeruginosa. Ceftazidime MIC(50S) for Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Haemophilus influenzae (including beta-lactamase producers) were 0.03-0.06 and 0.015 mg/l, respectively. Ceftazidime was found to be bactericidal against most strains at or one doubling dilution above the MIC, and was relatively unaffected by increasing inoculum concentration (some strain variations). It perfused readily into bacterial cells and was effective against the majority of strains resistant to currently available cephalosporins and aminoglycosides. beta-lactamases of Types I-V and Bacillus cereus failed to significantly hydrolyse ceftazidime. Ceftazidime inhibited only Type I Ent. cloacae beta-lactamase hydrolysis. Disc diffusion tests favour the use of a 30 microg ceftazidime disc for the methods described by the National Committee Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS). Quality control data are presented. Tentative 30 microg disc interpretive criteria, based on susceptible MICs of < or =8 mg/l(> 17 mm) and resistant > or =32 mg/l ( < or =13 mm), resulted in < 1% (false resistance or false susceptible) interpretive error rates. Staph. aureus was the species most commonly found to have strains with indeterminate ceftazidime zones or MICs. We found ceftazidime to possess one of the widest clinically usable antimicrobial spectrum by in-vitro testing of any beta-lactam tested and to be most comparable to broad-spectrum aminoglycosides such as amikacin, gentamicin and tobramycin.
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of 6059-S therapy in children (author's transl)].
AB  - A new semisynthetic 1-oxa-beta-lactam derivative, 6059-S, was evaluated for its safety and efficacy in children. Twenty-five patients were treated with 10 to 274 mg/kg per day of 6059-S by intravenous administrations. The diagnosis of the patients were acute pharyngitis (2), acute bronchitis (2), pneumonia (4), pertussis (4), acute enterocolitis (2), recurrent urinary tract infection (2), suspected septicemia (3), and acute purulent meningitis (1); and the remaining 5 patients were considered to have nonbacterial infections. The pathogens recovered were Streptococcus pneumoniae (1), Haemophilus influenzae (4), Haemophilus parainfluenzae (1), Enterobacter cloacae (1), Enterobacter aerogenes (1), Proteus morganii (1), Psuedomonas aeruginosa (2) and Salmonella typhimurium (1). All the patients of bacterial infections were cured after the 6059-S therapy. However, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella typhimurium were not eradicated after the 6059-S therapy, and the rate of bacterial disappearance was 75%. Diarrhea (3), precordial pain (2, only in cases with high-dose therapy), transient elevation of GOT and GPT (2), and transient eosinophilia (2) were found to be associated with the 6059-S therapy. However, no severe adverse reactions were encountered. Half life of the serum 6059-S level was 1.34 +/- 0.16 hours. CSF concentrations in a case with Haemophilus influenzae meningitis ranged 4.0 to 9.7 mcg/ml after an intravenous injection of 34.3 to 75 mg/kg of 6059-S. From the present study, 6059-S appears to be a safe and effective antibiotic when used in children with susceptible bacterial infections. It remains to be further determined whether 6059-S is superior to ABPC in the treatment of Haemophilus influenzae meningitis.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of cefmenoxime (SCE-1365).
AB  - The in vitro activity of cefmenoxime (SCE-1365 or A-50912), a new semisynthetic cephalosporin antibiotic, was compared with those of cefazolin, cefoxitin, and cefamandole against a broad spectrum of 486 organisms and with that of cefotaxime against 114 organisms. Cefmenoxime and cefotaxime exhibited nearly equivalent activities against those organisms tested and were the most active of these cephalosporins against all aerobic and facultative organisms except Staphylococcus aureus. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of cefmenoxime required to inhibit at least 90% of strains tested (MIC(90)) ranged from 0.06 to 8 mug/ml for the Enterobacteriaceae. The MIC(90)s for gram-positive cocci were 0.015 and </=0.008 mug/ml for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes, respectively, and 2 mug/ml for S. aureus. Group D streptococci were less susceptible. Cefmenoxime was very active against Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Neisseria meningitidis with MIC(90)s ranging from </=0.008 to 0.25 mug/ml. Cefmenoxime, at a concentration of 16 mug/ml, inhibited 78% and 73% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp., respectively. MICs for anaerobes ranged from 0.5 to >128 mug/ml with good activity against the gram-positive organisms. In addition, cefmenoxime activity was bactericidal and only slightly affected by differences in inoculum size. The combination of cefmenoxime and gentamicin was synergistic against 80% of the Enterobacteriaceae and 100% of P. aeruginosa strains tested. Development of resistance to cefmenoxime was slow or absent for organisms with low initial MICs but more rapid for those with higher initial MICs. Cefmenoxime exhibited good protective activity in mice infected with Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, or S. aureus but was less effective against P. aeruginosa.
TI  - [Cefotaxime CSF levels in children with purulent meningitis (author's transl)].
AB  - Cefotaxime concentrations obtained in the C.S.F. of twelve children suffering from bacterial meningitis and undergoing monotherapy with this antibiotic are reported. Among these 12 patients, 4 infants (aged 3 to 28 days) had neonatal meningitis (due to Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli); one infant (2 months old) had meningitis due to Salmonella panama; 5 children (aged 5 to 11 months) had meningitis due to Haemophilus; and 2 children had belated superinfection caused by a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt due to Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Cefotaxime concentration reached a high level as early as one hour after the injection (3 to 19 mcg/ml), remained at this level until the fifth hour (1,8 to 14,3 mcg/ml) and decreased without significant proportionality with the disappearance of the inflammatory symptoms. Compared to the M.I.C. of the bacteria which caused the twelve cases of meningitis, these results show that the concentrations in the C.S.F. are much higher than the M.I.C.'s. These results are comparable to those of previous studies. Cefotaxime diffuses in the C.S.F. and gives concentrations which ensures an antibacterial activity that ampicillin could not reach: in particular against Haemophilus influenzae and enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - [Cefotaxime, syn isomer of a new methoxyimino cephalosporin with unusual activity (author's transl)].
AB  - Cefotaxime, the - syn - derivative of 7 - [(2-(2-amino-4-4-thiazolyl)-2-methoxyimino) acetamido] cephalosporanic acid, is a new semisynthetic cephalosporin. In in vitro studies, it was 80 times more active than the - anti - derivative against beta-lactamase-producing strains of Gram-negative bacteria. The range of inhibitory concentrations of cefotaxime against Gram-negative bacteria, including Haemophilus influenzae, susceptible or resistant to penicillins and cephalosporins was from 0.01 to 0.1 micrograms/ml. This activity was consistently higher than that observed with cephalothin, cephaloridine, cephalexin, and cefazolin. Nevertheless, some strains of Enterobacter cloacae were resistant. Cefotaxime showed very similar activity to that of ampicillin against group A streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of fluorinated analogs of chloramphenicol and thiamphenicol.
AB  - We evaluated the in vitro antimicrobial activity of Sch 24893, Sch 25298, and Sch 25393, three novel analogs of chloramphenicol and thiamphenicol. All of the analogs had minimal inhibitory concentrations of less than or equal to 10 micrograms/ml for 18 chloramphenicol-thiamphenicol-resistant strains of Shigella dysenteriae and 21 strains of resistant Salmonella typhi. The analogs were also more active than were chloramphenicol and thiamphenicol against chloramphenicol-resistant enteric bacteria, including six strains of Escherichia coli, seven strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae, and two strains of Enterobacter cloacae. Fifty-three strains of ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae were uniformly susceptible to chloramphenicol, thiamphenicol, and the three analogs. Sch 25298 was the most active compound tested (minimal inhibitory concentration, 0.5 microgram/ml for all strains). Four of seven chloramphenicol-thiamphenicol-resistant Haemophilus strains were susceptible to the fluorinated analogs. Of the three Haemophilus strains which were resistant to chloramphenicol, thiamphenicol, and the analogs, two contained less than 10% of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity of the strains which were resistant to only chloramphenicol and thiamphenicol. We conclude that fluorinated analogs of chloramphenicol and thiamphenicol have considerable in vitro activity against a broad spectrum of chloramphenicol-thiamphenicol-resistant, gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - A comparison of cefamandole, cefoxitin, cefuroxime, cefotaxime and cefoperazone:  an in vitro test on a number of beta-lactamase producing strains of 9 species and 1 genus of bacteria.
AB  - The sensitivity of a number of beta-lactamase producing strains of Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter species, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia marcescens to cefamandole, cefoxitin, cefuroxime, cefotaxime and cefoperazone was determined in vitro. All bacterial cultures were examined for beta-lactamase production using the chromogenic cephalosporin compound 87/312. All strains were typed by means of antibiotic and chemotherapeutic sensitivities. Only non-identical strains were used. A tray method was used to determine the quantity of antimicrobial product necessary for a complete growth inhibition at various culture dilutions. The results showed that all strains of H. influenzae, especially in the dilution 2.10(6), were sensitive to the five cephalosporins. The other species and genus of bacteria had a varying sensitivity to the five cephalosporins. Cefoperazone had potent activity against Ps. aeruginosa. Differences between the five cephalosporins with regard to the effect of culture dilution were only small.
TI  - Cefmenoxime (SCE-1365), a novel broad-spectrum cephalosporin: in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities.
AB  - The activity of cefmenoxime (SCE-1365), 7 beta-[2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-(Z)-2-methoxyiminoacetamido]-3-[(1-methyl-1H-tetraz ol-5-yl)thiomethyl]ceph-3-em-4-carboxylic acid, was compared with that of other cephalosporins. Cefmenoxime exhibited high activity against a wide variety of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. The in vitro activity of cefmenoxime against Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, and Enterobacteriaceae, including indole-positive Proteus, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, and Citrobacter freundii, was 10 to 1,000 times greater than that of several other cephalosporins. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, cefmenoxime showed activity two to four times that of sulbenicillin and carbenicillin but less than that of cefsulodin. Variation in pH, addition of horse serum, and type of growth medium had definite effects on the activity of cefmenoxime, and the inoculum size affected the activity against bacterial species. In Escherichia coli cefmenoxime showed marked affinity for penicillin-binding protein 3 (PBP-3), followed by PBP-1 (1A and 1B). This affinity profile was well correlated with its filamentous cell-forming activity under extremely low drug concentrations and with its bactericidal activity against microorganisms. The high in vitro activity of cefmenoxime was reflected in the degree of protection observed in mice infected intraperitoneally with a wide variety of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Furthermore, cefmenoxime showed good therapeutic activity against infection models in mice such as respiratory tract infection caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae and urinary tract infection caused by Proteus mirabilis.
TI  - Evaluation of the four-hour Micro-ID technique for direct identification of oxidase-negative, Gram-negative rods from blood cultures.
AB  - A 4-h Micro-ID technique for direct identification of oxidase-negative gram-negative rods from positive blood cultures was compared to subculture and species identification of single colonies by API 20E and Micro-ID, using standardized inocula. A total of 127 patients (220 positive cultures) were studied. Isolates included 96 Escherichia coli, 46 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 7 Klebsiella oxytoca, 8 Enterobacter aerogenes, 17 Enterobacter cloacae, 19 Serratia marcescens, 2 Serratia liquefaciens, 8 Proteus mirabilis, 1 Salmonella species, 1 Morganella morganii, 6 Haemophilus influenzae, 2 Haemophilus parainfluenzae, 3 Bacteroides fragilis, 3 Acinetobacter calcoaceticus biotype anitratus, and 1 Pseudomonas maltophilia. In 90% of the cultures, identification by Micro-ID was identical to that obtained after subculture; if the 15 non-enterobacterial isolates were excluded, the corresponding figure was 96.6%. Enterobacteria identified incorrectly by direct Micro-ID were three S. marcescens (two identified as S. liquefaciens, one as Hafnia alvei), two S. liquefaciens (both identified as E. cloacae), and two K. pneumoniae (one identified as Klebsiella ozaenae, the other as Serratia rubidaea). None of the 15 non-enterobacterial cultures were correctly identified by Micro-ID (non-identifiable, or classified as Providencia/Yersinia/Klebsiella species). Although biochemical discrepancies between direct and final Micro-ID tests occurred in 41% of the enterobacterial cultures, this did not seriously interfere with identification. Direct species identification of Enterobacteriaceae from blood cultures by direct Micro-ID is accurate and easily performed and identified organisms within 4 h compared to at least 24 h by most other methods; the direct Micro-ID technique would be rendered even more valuable by the additional capability of identifying non-enterobacterial gram-negative isolates.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity and susceptibility of the cephalosporin Ro 13-9904 to beta-lactamases.
AB  - The in vitro activity of Ro 13-9904 was assessed against clinical isolated of common bacteria. Its activity against most enterobacteria was similar to that of cefotaxime and moxalactam, but it was even more active than these compounds against all Proteus species. It was also highly active against Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, including beta-lactamase producers. Like cefotaxime and moxalactam, Or 13-9904 was approximately eightfold more active than carbenicillin against most isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and also active against highly carbenicillin-resistant isolates, but it was relatively inactive against moderately carbenicillin-resistant isolates. Ro 13-9904 also resembled cefotaxime and moxalactam in that it was active, though less so than cephaloridine, against staphylococci and streptococci, except for methicillin-resistant staphylococci and Streptococcus faecalis, which were resistant to it. It was less active than cefoxitin but slightly more active than ampicillin against both Bacteroides fragilis and other Bacteroides spp. Ro 13-9904 was resistant to most beta-lactamases but was attacked by enzymes from B. fragilis, isolates of indole-positive Proteus species, and also by a cefoxitin-hydrolyzing enzyme from an isolate of Enterobacter cloacae.
TI  - HR 756, the syn isomer of a new methoxyimino cephalosporin with unusual antibacterial activity.
AB  - HR 756, the syn derivative of 7-[(2-(2-amino-4-thiazolyl)-2-methoxyimino)acetamido]cephalosporanic acid, is a new semisynthetic cephalosporin. It was 80 times more active than the anti derivative against beta-lactamase-producing strains of gram-negative bacteria. The range of inhibitory concentrations of HR 756 against gram-negative bacteria, including Haemophilus influenzae, susceptible or resistant to penicillins and cephalosporins was from 0.01 to 0.1 mug/ml. This activity was consistently higher than those observed with cephalothin, cephaloridine, cephalexin, and cefazolin. Nevertheless, some strains of Enterobacter cloacae were resistant. HR 756 showed very similar activity to that of ampicillin against group A streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae.
TI  - Amikacin in the treatment of gram-negative bronchopulmonary infections.
AB  - Six patients with acute gram-negative bronchopulmonary infection were treated with amikacin (15 mg/kg per day) administered intramuscularly in two equal doses at 12-hr intervals for 10-13 days. Two patients had underlying nonspecific pulmonary disease, two had advanced bronchocarcinoma, and two had extensive bronchiectasis (due to chronic aspergillosis in one patient). The pathogens were Pseudomonas aeruginosa in three patients, and Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella ozaenae, and Enterobacter cloacae each in one patient. Five patients recovered completely, with resolution of fever and other acute symptoms and elimination of the causative organism from sputum cultures. A moribund patient with advanced metastatic bronchocarcinoma died two days after the treatment with amikacin had been completed; the last specimen of sputum was still positive for P. aeruginosa. Tests of liver and renal function and blood counts revealed no abnormaltities. Complete audiometric survey showed no hearing loss. Nystagmography revealed reversible, lessened caloric response in some patients. Amikacin was well absorbed from the site of intramuscular injection. Levels of amikacin in serum varied among the subjects and, in some cases, for individual patients on different days.
TI  - Laboratory studies with cefatrizine (SK + F 60771), a new broad-spectrum orally-active cephalosporin.
AB  - Cefatrizine (SK&F 60771), a new orally-active semisynthetic cephalosporin antibiotic with broad-spectrum antibacterial activity, was compared with cephalexin and cefazolin for in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activity and pharmacokinetic behavior in laboratory animals. The average MIC values obtained with cefatrizine against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria were superior to those obtained with cephalexin and somewhat poorer than those of cefazolin. In addition, a large percentage of the enterobacter and enterococcus isolates were found to be susceptible. Cefatrizine had a longer biological half-life and a higher peak serum level than either cefazolin or cephalexin when administered parenterally or orally to mice at 20 mg/kg. It had striking in vivo protective activity in mice infected with Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Hemophilus influenzae, Proteus morganii or Staphylococcus aureus reflecting its superior pharmacokinetic profile in this animal species. A variable pharmacokinetic response between animal species was observed when cefatrizine was administered either orally or parenterally to dogs, squirrel monkeys or rabbits.
