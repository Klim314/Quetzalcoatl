TI  == canine antimicrobial peptides are effective against resistant bacteria and yeasts.
AB  == background: antimicrobial peptides (amps) are small proteins present in most living species and they are involved in the defence against pathogenic organisms. beta-defensins and cathelicidin are the most frequently studied amps in both people and dogs. hypothesis/objectives: our objectives were to determine the minimal inhibitory concentration and minimal bactericidal concentration of two canine beta-defensins and a cathelicidin against antibiotic-sensitive and antibiotic-resistant bacteria and yeasts using a broth microdilution method. methods: the micro-organisms tested were atcc strains of meticillin-sensitive and meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mssa and mrsa, respectively), meticillin-sensitive staphylococcus pseudintermedius (mssp), escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans and malassezia pachydermatis. field strains of meticillin-resistant s, pseudintermedius (mrsp, n = 1) and mssp (n = 11) were also tested. mann-whitney u-test and friedman test were used for statistical analysis. results: the mssp and mrsp were more susceptible to canine  amps than mssa and mrsa. malassezia pachydermatis was more sensitive than c. albicans to canine amps. the beta-defensin cbd103 was most effective against staphylococci and p. aeruginosa, while the cathelicidin ccath was the most effective amp against e. coli. additionally, cbd103 was the most effective amp for both yeasts studied, with m. pachydermatis being more susceptible than c. albicans. all amps tested exhibited killing within 2 h of exposure. conclusions and clinical importance: we demonstrated that natural canine amps are effective against canine-specific pathogens, are equally effective against meticillin-resistant or -susceptible strains, and are more effective against m. pachydermatis than against c. albicans organisms.

TI  == antibiotic treatment of resistant infections in small animals.
AB  == there are few veterinary clinical studies to support a recommended use and dose for treating resistant bacterial infections in small animals. resistance against  many common antibiotics is possible and a susceptibility test is advised. infections caused by pseudomonas aeruginosa presents a special problem. staphylococcus isolated from small animals is most likely to be staphylococcus pseudintermedius. the most important resistance mechanism for staphylococcus is methicillin resistance. the only antimicrobials to which some gram-negative bacilli are sensitive may be extended-spectrum cephalosporins, carbapenems (penems), selected penicillin derivatives, amikacin, or tobramycin. a susceptibility test is needed to identify the appropriate drug for these infections.

TI  == in vitro comparison of the effectiveness of polihexanide and chlorhexidine against canine isolates of staphylococcus pseudintermedius, pseudomonas aeruginosa and malassezia pachydermatis.
AB  == background: polihexanide (polyhexamethylene biguanide) is an antiseptic substance that plays a prominent role in the treatment of critically colonized or infected  acute and chronic wounds in humans. hypothesis/objectives: the aim of this study  was to assess the in vitro antimicrobial efficacy of polihexanide against canine  isolates of staphylococcus pseudintermedius, pseudomonas aeruginosa and malassezia pachydermatis and compare it with 4.5% chlorhexidine digluconate for two different contact times. methods: ten isolates of each organism were incubated at 37 degrees c for 3 and 5 min, respectively, with each antiseptic diluted 1:2 to 1:4096 in phosphate-buffered saline. results: both products showed excellent antimicrobial activity against all isolates tested. no significant differences in antimicrobial efficacy between antiseptics for all isolates were found. with the exception of one isolate of m. pachydermatis at 3 min exposure time, all isolates were completely killed by a dilution of 1:32 of polihexanide as well as chlorhexidine at both exposure times. although the mean values of break-point concentrations for both antiseptics increased with the longer exposure time of 5 min, there were no significant differences between the two exposure times. the p. aeruginosa isolates were more susceptible than s. pseudintermedius for both antiseptics, and break-point dilutions were significantly higher compared with break-point dilutions obtained by all other treatments. conclusions and clinical importance: the results indicate that polihexanide has comparable in vitro antimicrobial efficacy to chlorhexidine and  presents a potential alternative agent for skin and wound antisepsis in veterinary medicine.

TI  == the joint in vitro action of polymyxin b and miconazole against pathogens associated with canine otitis externa from three european countries.
AB  == background: canine otitis externa, an inflammation of the external ear canal, can be maintained and worsened by bacterial or fungal infections. for topical treatment, combinations of anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial ingredients are mainly used. hypothesis/objectives: this study was conducted to elucidate the in  vitro activity of polymyxin b and miconazole against clinical bacterial isolates  from three european countries, to investigate possible differences in sensitivity and to assess drug interactions. animals: seventeen strains of escherichia coli,  24 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa, 24 strains of proteus mirabilis and 25 strains of staphylococcus pseudintermedius from dogs with diagnosed otitis externa had been isolated in germany, france and italy. methods: drug activities  were evaluated by minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimal bactericidal concentration. the potentiation of polymyxin b plus miconazole was calculated using the fractional inhibitory concentration index (fici). an fici </=0.5 defined synergy. furthermore, geographical variations in the fici and mic were assessed by statistical analysis. results: bacterial susceptibilities were comparable in different european countries, because there were no significant mic and fici variations (p > 0.05). as a single agent, polymyxin b had bactericidal activity against most e. coli and p. aeruginosa strains and, in higher concentrations, against s. pseudintermedius strains. miconazole was bactericidal  against all staphylococcus strains. synergy was demonstrated against strains of e. coli and p. aeruginosa (fici = 0.25 and 0.50, respectively), whereas overall there was no interaction against s. pseudintermedius strains (fici = 1.25). proteus mirabilis strains were not inhibited by each of the drugs individually or by their combination. conclusions and clinical importance: in vitro synergy of polymyxin b and miconazole against e. coli and p. aeruginosa isolates indicates a rationale for applying both agents in combination to treat otitis externa when infected with these types of bacteria.

TI  == mutant prevention concentration of orbifloxacin: comparison between escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and staphylococcus pseudintermedius of canine origin.
AB  == background: the mutant prevention concentration (mpc) is an important parameter to evaluate the likelihood of growth of fluoroquinolone-resistant mutants for antimicrobial-pathogen combinations. the mpcs of fluoroquinolones for different canine pathogens have not been compared. in this study, we compared for the first time orbifloxacin mpcs between susceptible strains of escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and staphylococcus pseudintermedius of canine origin. methods: more than 1010 cfu/ml of 10 strains of each bacterial species were inoculated onto muller-hinton agar supplemented with different concentrations of  orbifloxacin from 1x to 64x minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and the mpcs were recorded. mics of original strains and of mutants arising after exposure to  sub-mpc concentrations (one per original strain) were determined in the presence  or absence of efflux pump inhibitors (epis). the effects of quinolone resistance-determining region (qrdr) mutations were also examined. results: mpcs  were significantly higher for p. aeruginosa (16-128 mug/ml) than for e. coli (0.5-32 mug/ml). mpcs for s. pseudintermedius varied between the low-susceptible  (16-128 mug/ml) and the high-susceptible strains (4-16 mug/ml) and were the most  broadly distributed among the three species. regarding resistance mechanisms, only one qrdr mutation in gyra was found in all of the 10 mutants of e. coli and  in 4 of the 10 mutants of p. aeruginosa, whereas mutations in both grla and gyra  were found in 3 mutants and one mutation in grla was found in 2 mutants among the 10 mutants of s. pseudintermedius. in the presence of an epi, the mics of p. aeruginosa mutants decreased markedly, those of e. coli mutants decreased moderately, and those of s. pseudintermedius mutants were unaffected. conclusions: mpcs of orbifloxacin vary between bacterial species of canine pathogens, possibly due to the diversity of the main fluoroquinolone resistance mechanism among these species. therefore, the type of bacterial species should be taken into consideration when using fluoroquinolone drugs such as orbifloxacin in canines.

TI  == susceptibility of canine and feline bacterial pathogens to pradofloxacin and comparison with other fluoroquinolones approved for companion animals.
AB  == in this study, 908 bacterial pathogens from defined infections of dogs and cats were tested for their susceptibility to the novel fluoroquinolone pradofloxacin,  which was approved in 2011 for use in cats and dogs. most of the bacteria tested  (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus pseudintermedius, escherichia coli, beta-haemolytic streptococci, pasteurella multocida and bordetella bronchiseptica) exhibited low pradofloxacin mic(90) values of </= 0.25 mug/ml. solely proteus spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa had higher mic(90) values of >/= 4 mug/ml. only six (3.4%) of 177 s. pseudintermedius and 12 (5.3%) of 227 e. coli isolates showed pradofloxacin mics of >/= 2 mug/ml. analysis of the quinolone resistance determining regions of the target genes identified double mutations in gyra that resulted in amino acid exchanges s83l+d87n or s83l+d87y and single or double mutations in parc that resulted in amino acid exchanges s80i or s80i+e84g  in all 12 e. coli isolates. the six s. pseudintermedius isolates exhibited amino  acid exchanges s84l or e88k in gyra and s80i in grla. comparative analysis of the mics of pradofloxacin and the mics determined for enrofloxacin and its main metabolite ciprofloxacin, but also marbofloxacin, orbifloxacin, difloxacin and ibafloxacin was conducted for the target pathogens s. pseudintermedius, e. coli and p. multocida. this comparison confirmed that pradofloxacin mics were significantly lower than those of the other tested fluoroquinolones.

TI  == in vitro killing of escherichia coli, staphylococcus pseudintermedius and pseudomonas aeruginosa by enrofloxacin in combination with its active metabolite  ciprofloxacin using clinically relevant drug concentrations in the dog and cat.
AB  == enrofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibacterial agent used to treat infections in companion animals. enrofloxacin's antimicrobial spectrum includes gram positive and gram-negative bacteria and demonstrates concentration-dependent bacteriocidal activity. in dogs and cats, enrofloxacin is partially metabolized to ciprofloxacin and both active agents circulate simultaneously in treated animals  at ratios of approximately 60-70% enrofloxacin to 30-40% ciprofloxacin. we were interested in determining the killing of companion animal isolates of escherichia coli, staphylococcus pseudintermedius and pseudomonas aeruginosa by enrofloxacin  and ciprofloxacin combined using clinically relevant drug concentrations and ratios. for e. coli isolates exposed to 2.1 and 4.1mug/ml of enrofloxacin/ciprofloxacin at 50:50, 60:40 and 70:30 ratios, a 1.7-2.5log(10) reduction (94-99% kill) was seen following 20min of drug exposure; 0.89-1.7log(10) (92-99% kill) of s. pseudintermedius following 180min of drug exposure; 0.85-3.4log(10) (98-99% kill) of p. aeruginosa following 15min of drug  exposure. killing of s. pseudintermedius was enhanced in the presence of enrofloxacin whereas killing of p. aeruginosa was enhanced in the presence of ciprofloxacin. antagonism was not seen when enrofloxacin and ciprofloxacin were used in kill assays. the unique feature of partial metabolism of enrofloxacin to  ciprofloxacin expands the spectrum of enhanced killing of common companion animal pathogens.

TI  == determination of enrofloxacin stability and in vitro efficacy against staphylococcus pseudintermedius and pseudomonas aeruginosa in four ear cleaner solutions over a 28 day period.
AB  == chemical stability and in vitro bactericidal efficacy of 0.9% enrofloxacin-compounded solutions were evaluated following storage at room temperature for 28 days. chemical stability of enrofloxacin was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc) in five compounded solutions, including sterile water. bactericidal efficacy was determined by spiral plating serial 10-fold dilutions of bacteria and solutions followed by colony counts. tris-edta [trizedta((r)) (te)], tris-edta and 0.15% chlorhexidine [trizchlor((r)) (tc)], 2.5% lactic acid, 0.1% salicylic acid and 0.1% parachlorometaxylenol [epi-otic (eo)], and 0.1% free salicylic acid, 0.1% parachlorometaxylenol and 0.5% edta [epi-otic advanced (ea)] were used. high-performance liquid chromatography was carried out with one-step liquid/liquid extraction to detect and quantify enrofloxacin stability. mean recoveries for compounded samples run in triplicate at 28 days were 97.7% (te), 99.9% (tc), 98.1% (eo) and 97.8% (ea).  kruskal-wallis analysis showed no significant difference in the percentage recovery (h=0.0539, df=3, p=0.9967). american type culture collection strains of  staphylococcus pseudintermedius and pseudomonas aeruginosa were used to evaluate  in vitro efficacy following 30 min incubation on days 0, 14 and 28. consistent in vitro bactericidal efficacy of all compounded solutions, indicated by killing >2.3x10(7) colony-forming units/ml, was seen; however, bactericidal efficacy decreased for compounded tc on day 14. pseudomonas aeruginosa was more sensitive  to the ear cleaners and enrofloxacin than s. pseudintermedius. the hplc and in vitro data suggest that 0.9% enrofloxacin compounded with sterile water, te, eo and ea maintains chemical stability and bactericidal efficacy for 28 days.

TI  == comparative in vitro efficacy of antimicrobial shampoos: a pilot study.
AB  == this study compared the antimicrobial efficacy of shampoos against meticillin-sensitive staphylococcus pseudintermedius (mssp), meticillin-resistant s. pseudintermedius (mrsp), antibiotic-sensitive pseudomonas aeruginosa (pa), multidrug-resistant p. aeruginosa (mdr-pa) and malassezia pachydermatis. three isolates were incubated for 10, 30 and 60 min with each shampoo diluted in phosphate-buffered saline. aliquots were then incubated for 16-18 h on sheep blood agar (bacteria) or for 3 days on sabouraud's dextrose agar (malassezia). the minimal bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) for chlorhexidine products (malaseb((r)), pyoderm((r))/microbex((r)) and hibiscrub((r))) were 1:1,024-1:2,048 for mssp and mrsp, 1:512-1:1,024 for pa and mdr-pa, and 1:2,048-1:5,096 for malassezia at all time points. the mbcs for benzoyl peroxide  (paxcutol((r))) for mssp and mrsp were 1:2-1:8 at 10 min, and 1:256 after 30 and  60 min. a 1:2 dilution was effective against pseudomonas, and 1:512-1:1,024 dilutions were effective against malassezia at all time points. the mbcs for ethyl lactate (etiderm((r))) for mssp and mrsp were 1:2 at 10 min, and 1:2-1:16 after 30 and 60 min. a 1:2 dilution was effective against pseudomonas, and a 1:512 dilution was effective against malassezia at all time points. chloroxylenol (coatex((r))) and acetic acid-boric acid (malacetic((r))) were not effective against mssp, mrsp or pseudomonas. both were effective against malassezia at 1:8-1:16 dilution at 10 min, and at 1:8-1:32 dilution after 30 and 60 min. in conclusion, chlorhexidine appeared to be the most effective topical biocide, and  mrsp and mdr-pa were no less susceptible than antibiotic-sensitive organisms. these results should, however, be confirmed with larger numbers of isolates.

TI  == recognising and controlling risk factors for antimicrobial resistance.
AB  == antimicrobial resistance amongst organisms such as escherichia coli, pseudomonas  aeruginosa, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and s. pseudintermedius has become a serious threat to veterinary small animal practice. there is an urgent need to adopt measures which will control and reduce this problem. risk factors for infection by resistant organisms in small animals are now becoming recognised and appear to mirror those in human medicine. they include contact with carriers or infected animals, hospital admission, invasive procedures and antimicrobial therapy. key recommendations which enable such risk  factors to be avoided are: development of protocols which ensure that antimicrobials are used only when necessary, selection of appropriate antimicrobials and compliance with correct dosage and administration, limitation  of prophylactic and perioperative use, and recording of treatment outcomes so that therapeutic regimens can be evaluated and modified if necessary. in addition, there is a need for rigorous hygiene protocols to prevent survival and  transfer of resistant bacteria in clinics and hospitals.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity of a commercial ear antiseptic containing chlorhexidine and tris-edta.
AB  == minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) of a commercial ear antiseptic containing chlorhexidine 0.15% and tris-edta (otodine) were determined by broth microdilution for 150 isolates representing the most common pathogens associated  with canine otitis. the microorganisms were classified into three groups according to their levels of susceptibility. the most susceptible group included  staphylococcus pseudintermedius, malassezia pachydermatis, streptococcus canis and corynebacterium auriscanis, which were generally killed by 1 : 64 dilution of the antiseptic product (mbc = 23/0.8 microg/ml of chlorhexidine/tris-edta). the most resistant organism was proteus mirabilis, which survived up to 1 : 8 dilution of the product (mbc = 375/12 microg/ml). escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus displayed intermediate mbcs ranging between  188/6 and 47/1.5 microg/ml. interestingly, s. pseudintermedius was more susceptible than s. aureus, and no significant difference was observed between meticillin-resistant and meticillin-susceptible isolates within each species, indicating that antiseptic use is unlikely to co-select for meticillin resistance. although the concentrations required for killing (mbcs) varied considerably with microorganism type, the combination of chlorhexidine 0.15% and  tris-edta was active against all the pathogens most commonly involved in canine otitis.

TI  == quorum sensing in veterinary pathogens: mechanisms, clinical importance and future perspectives.
AB  == under certain circumstances the individuals of a bacterial population may find advantages in acting together and making "collective decisions". this phenomenon  is better known as quorum sensing. when the concentration of signal molecules produced by the surrounding bacteria exceeds a certain threshold, the bacterial population acts as a single organism, collectively expressing virulence genes, biofilm forming genes, etc. several mechanisms of quorum sensing are discussed, each with its distinct signal molecules and respective receptors. some of these mechanisms are restricted to sensing intraspecies signalling, but interspecies and even interkingdom signalling have also been described. several veterinary pathogens such as staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus pseudintermedius, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella typhimurium use quorum sensing as a means to optimize virulence gene expression and host colonization. therefore, targeting of the qs mechanisms may provide a novel strategy for combating bacterial infections, also in veterinary medicine.
