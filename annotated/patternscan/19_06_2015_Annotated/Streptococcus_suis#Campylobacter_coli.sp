TI  == impact of antibiotic use in the swine industry.
AB  == antibiotic resistance in bacteria associated with pigs not only affects pig production but also has an impact on human health through the transfer of resistant organisms and associated genes via the food chain. this can compromise  treatment of human infections. in the past most attention was paid to glycopeptide and streptogramin resistance in enterococci, fluoroquinolone resistance in campylobacter and multi-drug resistance in escherichia coli and salmonella. while these are still important the focus has shifted to esbl producing organisms selected by the use of ceftiofur and cefquinome in pigs. in addition livestock-associated methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa)  suddenly emerged in 2007. we also need to consider multi-resistant strains of streptococcus suis. environmental contamination arising from piggery wastewater and spreading of manure slurry on pastures is also a growing problem.

TI  == [new insight into bacterial zoonotic pathogens posing health hazards to humans].
AB  == this article presents the problem of evolutionary changes of zoonotic pathogens responsible for human diseases. everyone is exposed to the risk of zoonotic infection, particularly employees having direct contact with animals, i.e. veterinarians, breeders, butchers and workers of animal products' processing industry. the article focuses on pathogens monitored by the european centre for disease prevention and control (ecdc), which has been collecting statistical data on zoonoses from all european union countries for 19 years and publishing collected data in annual epidemiological reports. currently, the most important 11 pathogens responsible for causing human zoonotic diseases are being monitored, of which seven are bacteria: salmonella spp., campylobacter spp., listeria monocytogenes, mycobacterium bovis, brucella spp., coxiella burnetti and verotoxin-producing e. coli (vtec)/shiga-like toxin producing e. coli (stec). as  particularly important are considered foodborne pathogens. the article also includes new emerging zoonotic bacteria, which are not currently monitored by ecdc but might pose a serious epidemiological problem in a foreseeable future: streptococcus iniae, s. suis, s. dysgalactiae and staphylococci: staphylococcus intermedius, s. pseudintermedius. those species have just crossed the animal-human interspecies barrier. the exact mechanism of this phenomenon remains unknown, it is connected, however, with genetic variability, capability to survive in changing environment. these abilities derive from dna rearrangement and horizontal gene transfer between bacterial cells. substantial increase in the number of scientific publications on this subject, observed over the last few years, illustrates the importance of the problem.

TI  == prevalence and diversity of arcobacter spp. isolated from the internal organs of  spontaneous porcine abortions in denmark.
AB  == a study was conducted to determine the prevalence and possible significance of campylobacteria in pig abortions in denmark. surface-cauterised liver and kidney  samples from 55 aborted pig fetuses submitted to the danish veterinary laboratory were taken and a sensitive isolation procedure used to examine pooled tissue samples for campylobacter, arcobacter and helicobacter spp. routine microbiological, immunological, and histopathological examinations were also performed to identify concurrent infections or histopathological changes. the abortions tested negative for established abortifacient pathogens (brucella, leptospira, ppv, prrsv), but arcobacter spp. were recovered from 23/55 abortions. co-infections with streptococcus suis, escherichia coli, and haemolytic streptococci were observed in 7/23 arcobacter-positive fetuses, and in 4/32 arcobacter-negative fetuses. histopathological analyses identified placentitis, pneumonia, hepatitis and encephalitis among the study group. however, no obvious  pathologic features were solely associated with arcobacter-positive cases, nor were arcobacter-like bacteria observed in tissue samples. protein profile analyses of the 27 arcobacter isolates identified 11 as a. cryaerophilus and 10 as a. skirrowii. six strains could not be classified into any existing species and were phenotypically distinct, thus, potentially representing at least one new species. the identification results showed that multiple taxa could be found in a single fetus, and in distinct aborted fetuses from a single sow. the high prevalence of arcobacters in danish pig abortions may account for at least some of the >90% of cases in which no established abortifacient agent is detected, but further studies are needed to define the role of each species, especially where co-infections with other bacteria are present.

TI  == cloning of the o-acetylserine lyase gene from the ruminal bacterium selenomonas ruminantium hd4.
AB  == the gene coding for o-acetylserine lyase (oasl) was cloned from a selenomonas ruminantium hd4 lambda zap ii genomic library by degenerative probe hybridization and complementation. sequence analysis revealed a 933 bp orf with a g + c content of 53%. the orf had significant homology with enzymes involved in cysteine biosynthesis. a curablastn homology search showed that the orf shared 59% nucleotide identity with the cysk of bacillus subtilis. the deduced amino acid sequence exhibited high (>70%) similarity with the cysk of b. subtilis and other  cysteine synthesis proteins from mycobacterium tuberculosis, mycobacterium leprae, and spinacia oleracea. further analysis predicted that the gene product was a member of the pyridoxal phosphate enzyme family and of cytoplasmic origin.  phylogenetic analysis clustered the s. ruminantium gene product with the oasla isoform of b. subtilis and the oaslb isoforms of streptococcus suis, escherichia  coli, and campylobacter jejuni. the oasl of s. ruminantium hd4 was also able to complement the cysm cysk double mutations in escherichia coli nk3 and allow for growth on minimal media that contained either sulfate or thiosulfate as the sole  source of sulfur. these results suggest that the gene functions as a cysm in s. ruminantium hd4. in conclusion, this research describes the cloning and expression of an o-acetylserine lyase gene from the predominant ruminal anaerobe  s. ruminantium hd4. to our knowledge, this is the first report characterizing genes involved in sulfur metabolism from the genus selenomonas.
