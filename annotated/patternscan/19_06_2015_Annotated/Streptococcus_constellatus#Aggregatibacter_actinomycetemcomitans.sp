TI  == antibiotic resistance in human chronic periodontitis microbiota.
AB  == background: patients with chronic periodontitis (cp) may yield multiple species of putative periodontal bacterial pathogens that vary in their antibiotic drug susceptibility. this study determines the occurrence of in vitro antibiotic resistance among selected subgingival periodontal pathogens in patients with cp.  methods: subgingival biofilm specimens from inflamed deep periodontal pockets were removed before treatment from 400 adults with cp in the united states. the samples were cultured, and selected periodontal pathogens were tested in vitro for susceptibility to amoxicillin at 8 mg/l, clindamycin at 4 mg/l, doxycycline at 4 mg/l, and metronidazole at 16 mg/l, with a post hoc combination of data for  amoxicillin and metronidazole. gram-negative enteric rods/pseudomonads were subjected to ciprofloxacin disk-diffusion testing. results: overall, 74.2% of the patients with cp revealed subgingival periodontal pathogens resistant to at least one of the test antibiotics. one or more test species, most often prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, streptococcus constellatus, or aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, were resistant in vitro to doxycycline, amoxicillin, metronidazole, or clindamycin, in 55%, 43.3%, 30.3%, and 26.5% of the patients with cp, respectively. fifteen percent of patients harbored subgingival periodontal pathogens resistant to both amoxicillin and metronidazole, which were mostly either s. constellatus (45 individuals) or ciprofloxacin-susceptible strains of gram-negative enteric rods/pseudomonads (nine individuals). conclusions: patients with cp in the united states frequently yielded subgingival periodontal pathogens resistant in vitro to therapeutic concentrations of antibiotics commonly used in clinical periodontal practice. the wide variability  found in periodontal pathogen antibiotic-resistance patterns should concern clinicians empirically selecting antibiotic treatment regimens for patients with  cp.

TI  == spiramycin resistance in human periodontitis microbiota.
AB  == purpose: the occurrence of in vitro resistance to therapeutic concentrations of spiramycin, amoxicillin, and metronidazole was determined for putative periodontal pathogens isolated in the united states. materials and methods: subgingival plaque specimens from 37 consecutive adults with untreated severe periodontitis were anaerobically cultured, and isolated putative periodontal pathogens were identified to a species level. in vitro resistance to spiramycin at 4 mug/ml, amoxicillin at 8 mug/ml, and/or metronidazole at 16 mug/ml was noted when putative periodontal pathogen growth was noted on the respective antibiotic-supplemented primary culture plates. results: a total of 18 (48.7%) subjects yielded antibiotic-resistant putative periodontal pathogens with spiramycin at 4 mug/ml in drug-supplemented primary isolation plates, as compared to 23 (62.2%) subjects with amoxicillin at 8 mug/ml, and 10 (27.0%) subjects with metronidazole at 16 mug/ml. spiramycin in vitro resistance occurred among species of fusobacterium nucleatum (44.4% of organism-positive subjects), prevotella intermedia/nigrescens (11.1%), parvimonas micra (10.8%), streptococcus constellatus (10%), streptococcus intermedius (10%), porphyromonas gingivalis (6.7%), and tannerella forsythia (5.3%). amoxicillin in vitro resistance was found in p. intermedia/nigrescens (55.5%), t. forsythia (15.8%), s. constellatus  (10%), f. nucleatum (5.6%), and p. micra (2.7%). only s. constellatus (70%) and s. intermedius (40%) exhibited in vitro resistance to metronidazole. when subject-based resistance data for spiramycin and metronidazole were jointly considered, all isolated putative periodontal pathogens were inhibited in vitro by one or the other of the antibiotic concentrations, except for one strain each  of s. constellatus and s. intermedius from one study subject. similarly, either amoxicillin or metronidazole at the drug concentrations tested inhibited in vitro all recovered putative periodontal pathogens, except s. constellatus in one subject. conclusions: in vitro spiramycin resistance among putative periodontal pathogens of united states origin occurred in approximately one-half of severe periodontitis patients evaluated, particularly among subgingival f. nucleatum species. in vitro resistance patterns also suggest that therapeutic concentrations of spiramycin plus metronidazole may have potential antimicrobial  efficacy in non-aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans-associated periodontitis similar to amoxicillin plus metronidazole, which may be beneficial, where spiramycin is clinically available, for patients hypersensitive to amoxicillin or other beta-lactam antibiotics.

TI  == efficacy of antibiotics against periodontopathogenic bacteria within epithelial cells: an in vitro study.
AB  == background: periodontopathogenic bacteria can invade and survive within epithelial cells, but susceptibility of intracellular infection to antibiotics used in periodontitis treatment has not been studied to date. methods: kb cells were infected by actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, strain nctc 9710; porphyromonas gingivalis, strains atcc 33277 and jh16-1; or streptococcus constellatus, strain j012b. after 2, 4, and 12 hours the bactericidal effect of antibiotics (clindamycin, doxycycline, metronidazole, and moxifloxacin) on intracellular microorganisms was tested at a concentration up to the 100-fold minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) determined separately on planktonic bacteria. results: the p. gingivalis strains differed in their invasiveness and atcc 33277 was 100-fold more invasive than jh16-1. doxycycline and clindamycin at a concentration 10-fold mic had no effect, but p. gingivalis intercellular infection was significantly reduced by metronidazole at 10-fold mic after 2 and 4 hours. moxifloxacin was effective, but a 100-fold mic concentration was necessary to reduce p. gingivalis strains intracellular growth to 7% of the control. other  bacterial species grown inside the kb cells were more susceptible to antibiotics. clindamycin at 10-fold mic reduced the number of intracellular s. constellatus after 4 and 12 hours. this bacterium was eliminated by moxifloxacin at 50-fold mic. intracellular a. actinomycetemcomitans was killed by 10-fold mic of doxycycline and moxifloxacin after 4 hours incubation. conclusions: moxifloxacin  was the most efficient antibiotic to treat intracellular infection. however, taking into account the mic values and the levels of antibiotics in gingival fluid, elimination of intracellular bacteria by antibiotics alone seems to be questionable.

TI  == efficacy of antibiotics to strains of periodontopathogenic bacteria within a single species biofilm - an in vitro study.
AB  == objectives: this study examined differences in the efficacy of antibiotics against a single strain of three periodontal pathogens grown in an artificial biofilm. methods: single species biofilms were established with artificial saliva and one of the following bacterial strains: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans  y4, streptococcus constellatus 384b (a clinical isolate) and porphyromonas gingivalis atcc 33277. the efficacy of the antibiotics clindamycin, doxycycline,  metronidazole, and moxifloxacin to these bacteria was determined using concentrations up to 100-fold minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) to planctonic bacteria over 48 h. results: the ability of the bacteria to form a biofilm varied. the biofilms of s. constellatus 384b and a. actinomycetemcomitans y4 contained more viable bacteria and showed a larger thickness in sem photographs than those of p. gingivalis atcc 33277. the antibiotics tested showed different efficacy for the different strains. moxifloxacin was the most efficient antibiotic: onefold mic was sufficient to eliminate a. actinomycetemcomitans y4 and p. gingivalis atcc 33277 after 48 h. however, only the 50-fold mic completely eradicated s. constellatus 384b. sem photographs underlined the damaging effect of moxifloxacin on the biofilm structure. conclusion: the complete removal of bacteria by the use of antibiotics alone seems to be impossible when taking into  account mic values and the level of antibiotics in gingival fluid.

TI  == efficacy of manual and powered toothbrushes (ii). effect on microbiological parameters.
AB  == background/aim: the purpose of the present investigation was to determine the effect of self-performed supragingival plaque removal using either manual (crest  complete) or power (braun 3d plaque remover) toothbrushing on supra and subgingival plaque composition. methods: 47 periodontal maintenance subjects completed this single-blind 6 month longitudinal study. at baseline, samples of supra and separately subgingival plaque were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in each subject using sterile curettes and individually analyzed for their  content of 18 bacterial taxa using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. after random assignment to groups receiving either a manual (n=25) or power toothbrush  (n=22), subjects received instruction in oral hygiene and used their assigned toothbrush 2x daily for 6 months. clinical monitoring and microbiological sampling were repeated at 3 and 6 months. significant differences in microbiological measures over time were sought using the quade test and between brushing groups at each time point using the mann-whitney test. results: mean total counts were significantly reduced for supra- and subgingival plaque samples in the manual group and subgingival samples in the powered brushing group. actinomyces naeslundii and actinomyces israelii/gerencseriae were the most numerous organisms detected at baseline and showed the greatest reductions in counts in both brushing groups. streptococcus constellatus/intermedius was significantly reduced in both groups, while streptococcus mitis/oralis/sanguis was significantly reduced in the manual toothbrushing group. mean counts of species were more markedly altered in subgingival plaque. major reductions occurred in both groups for a. naeslundii, a. israelii/gerencseriae, peptostreptococcus micros, veillonella parvula, prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, s. mitis/oralis/sanguis and s. constellatus/intermedius. all taxa examined were reduced in prevalence (% of sites colonized) in the subgingival plaque samples for both brushing groups. the reductions in prevalence were greater for a. naeslundii, s. constellatus/intermedius, v. parvula, a. israelii/gerencseriae, s. mitis/oralis/sanguis, p. micros, streptococcus mutans and p. intermedia/nigrescens. mean prevalence was decreased more for porphyromonas gingivalis, campylobacter rectus/showae, treponema denticola and bacteroides forsythus in supragingival plaque than subgingival plaque. conclusions: the major finding was the effect of supragingival plaque removal on the composition of the  subgingival microbiota. counts and prevalence of most taxa examined were markedly decreased in both toothbrushing groups. this reduction should translate to a decreased risk of periodontal disease initiation or recurrence. further, the decreased prevalence of periodontal pathogens in supragingival plaque lowers potential reservoirs of these species.

TI  == a microbiological study of papillon-lefevre syndrome in two patients.
AB  == aim: to analyse the microflora of subgingival plaque from patients with papillon-lefevre syndrome (pls), which is a very rare disease characterised by palmar-plantar hyperkeratosis with precocious periodontal destruction. methods: bacterial isolates were identified using a combination of commercial identification kits, traditional laboratory tests, and gas liquid chromatography. some isolates were also subjected to partial 16s rdna sequencing. plaque samples  were also assayed for the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans in a quantitative enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) using monoclonal antibodies. results: the culture results showed that most isolates were capnophilic and facultatively anaerobic species-mainly capnocytophaga spp and streptococcus spp. the latter included s. constellatus, s. oralis, and s. sanguis. other facultative bacteria belonged to the genera gemella, kingella, leuconostoc, and stomatococcus. the aerobic bacteria isolated were species of neisseria and bacillus. anaerobic species included prevotella intermedia, p. melaninogenica, and p. nigrescens, as  well as peptostreptococcus spp. elisa detected p gingivalis in one patient in all sites sampled, whereas a. actinomycetemcomitans was detected in only one site from the other patient. prevotella intermedia was present in low numbers. conclusions: patients with pls have a very complex subgingival flora including recognised periodontal pathogens. however, no particular periodontopathogen is invariably associated with pls.

TI  == assessment of periradicular microbiota by dna-dna hybridization.
AB  == in the present study the "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridization technique was used  to identify bacteria in periapical endodontic lesions of asymptomatic teeth. thirty-four patients with root-filled teeth and apical periodontitis were divided into two groups, each containing 17 patients. in group 1, a marginal incision was performed during surgery to expose the lesion, and in group 2, a submarginal incision was applied. the gingiva and mucosa were swabbed with an 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate solution prior to surgery. bacterial dna was identified in all samples from the two groups using 40 different whole genomic probes. the mean number (+/- sd) of species detected was 33.7 +/- 3.3 in group 1 and 21.3 +/- 6.3 in group 2 (p < 0.001). the majority of the probe-detected bacteria were present in more lesions from group 1 than from group 2. the differences were most notable for campylobacter gracilis, porphyromonas endodontalis, propionibacterium acnes, capnocytophaga gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. nucleatum, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. polymorphum, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola, streptococcus constellatus and actinomyces naeslundii i. bacterial species such as actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and bacteroides forsythus were detected in more than 60% of the lesions from both groups. also, p. endodontalis was abundant in periapical tissue. the data supported the idea that  following a marginal incision, bacteria from the periodontal pocket might reach the underlying tissues by surgeon-released bacteremia. the study provided solid evidence that bacteria invade the periapical tissue of asymptomatic teeth with apical periodontitis. the detection of much more bacteria with the "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridization method than has previously been recovered by anaerobic culture indicated that the endodontic (and periodontal) microfloras should be redefined using molecular methods.

TI  == serum antibodies reacting with subgingival species in refractory periodontitis subjects.
AB  == the purpose of this investigation was to compare the levels of serum igg antibody to 85 subgingival species in 32 refractory periodontitis, 56 successfully treated, and 33 periodontally healthy subjects. refractory subjects showed mean full mouth attachment loss and/or >3 sites showing attachment loss >2.5 mm within 1 year after 2 treatment modalities, scaling and root planing and surgery plus systemically administered tetracycline. successfully-treated subjects showed mean attachment level gain and no sites with attachment loss >2.5 mm, 1 year post-therapy. periodontally healthy subjects exhibited no pocket or attachment level >3 mm, and no evidence of progressing attachment loss during 1 year of monitoring. baseline serum was obtained from each subject and tested against 85 subgingival species, including reference strains and strains isolated from refractory subjects, using checkerboard immunoblotting. significance of differences in levels of serum antibody among groups were sought using the kruskal-wallis test. refractory subjects constituted a heterogeneous group based  on their serum antibody response to subgingival species. some individuals had antibody reactions to many subgingival species, while other subjects showed fewer or low numbers of responses. on average, refractory subjects exhibited higher numbers and levels of serum antibody reactions to a wide range of subgingival species than successfully treated or periodontally healthy subjects. differences  in serum antibody among clinical groups were more striking at higher threshold levels of antibody (>50 microg/ml and > 100 microg/ml). the data showed that a subject was 10.1 x more likely to be refractory if the subject exhibited antibody reactions with >9 subgingival species at >50 microg/ml (p<0.001, after adjusting  for multiple comparisons). serum antibody to a subset of the test species differed among the clinical groups. porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroidesforsythus, and some strains isolated from refractory subjects (a novel neisseria sp., enterococcus faecalis, prevotella loescheii and prevotella oulora) elicited high serum antibody in the successfully treated and refractory subjects. high levels of serum antibody to a microbacterium lacticum-like organism, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus constellatus, actinobacillus actinonmycetemcomitans serotype c and haemophilus aphrophilus significantly increased the likelihood of a subject being refractory to conventional periodontal therapy.

TI  == characterization of hemolytic bacteria in subgingival plaque.
AB  == three-quarters of the patients with periodontal diseases surveyed in this study had one or more distinct types of hemolytic bacteria in their subgingival plaque. twelve different species of bacteria were identified, belonging to five genera (actinomyces, streptococcus, staphylococcus, prevotella, and actinobacillus). nine hemolytic isolates, consisting of four prevotella denticola strains, two actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2 strains, and one each of p. melaninogenica,  streptococcus constellatus, and a. naeslundii genospecies 1 strains were characterized. incorporation of pronase into blood agar medium inhibited hemolysis by all of the isolates, suggesting a proteinaceous component for each of their hemolysins. with one exception, hemolysin production appeared to be regulated by the concentration of environmental iron: exogenous hemin was found to inhibit hemolysin production, and the iron scavenging compound, 2,2'- dipyridyl, was found to promote hemolysin production by all of the strains except for the s. constellatus isolate. genomic libraries of each of the hemolytic plaque isolates were prepared in escherichia coli using pbr322. hemolytic clones  were isolated on blood agar medium containing ampicillin at frequencies ranging from 1-6.7 x 10(-4). extensive restriction mapping revealed regions of homology in the case of clones derived from three p. denticola strains isolated from the same subjects. two of the p. denticola-derived clones were virtually identical throughout the entrety of their > 5 kb inserts. the clone derived from the third  strain showed good homology to the other two within a 1.3 kb region, but the flanking dna showed no homology even though all three p. denticola isolates were  shown to be clonally related by ribotyping.(abstract truncated at 250 words)
