TI  == etiology of acute childhood diarrhoea in calcutta.
AB  == of the 152 cases of acute diarrhoea, 124 (81.5%) revealed potential pathogens. altogether 27 (21.2%) out of 127 strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter, proteus and acinetobacter produced enterotoxin. single  pathogenic bacteria (40 cases 26.3%), parasite (6; 6%), rota virus (6; 6%), toxigenic bacteria (19; 12.5%) and mixed agents (37; 24.24.3%) were recorded in 108 cases (71.0%). another 14 (9.2%) cases exclusively revealed moderate to heavy growth of suspected enteric pathogens like k. pneumoniae, proteus, enterobacter,  pseudomonas aeruginosa, anaerogenic e. coli and citrobacter and 2 (1.3%) had high counts of t'. hominis. of the known pathogens, the preponderance of a. hydrophila (24.4%), rota virus (15.7%) and aeromonas hydrophila (14.0%) in 1-4 y, vibrio cholerae (45.6%) and trichuris trichiura (13.0%) in 4-14 y age group is highlighted. other pathogenic bacteria were non-01 v. cholerae (3.2%), v. parahaemolyticus (2.6%), v. fluvialis (0.6), plesiomonas shigelloides (3.9%), salmonella (2.6%), shigella (1.9%), epec (1.9%), eec (5.2%) and campylobacter jejuni (3.9%) and the parasites were entamoeba histolytica (2.6%) and giardia intestinalis (2.6). comparative study of age matched controls with those of diarrhoea suggested the pathogenic role of e. histolytica and t. hominis.
