TI  - Evaluation of a new oral health scale of infectious potential based on the salivary microbiota.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study is to analyse the correlation of our own  design of oral health scale (grades 0 and 1-better oral health vs. grades 2 and 3-poorer oral health) with the salivary microbiota. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The oral health scale we elaborated was evaluated in 100 adults (25 patients from each global oral health grade). Saliva samples collected from these patients were analysed using microbiological culture techniques, determining the presence/absence and the concentrations of some odontopathogens and periodontopathogens. RESULTS: In comparison with the global oral health grades 0-1, the grades 2-3 presented significantly higher values for the presence of odontopathogens (78 vs. 38 %; Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus spp. and Actinomyces spp.) and periodontopathogens (100 vs. 90 %; Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Campylobacter spp., Fusobacterium spp. and Prevotella gingivalis). In comparison with the grades 0-1, the grades 2-3 presented significantly higher values for the concentrations (CFU/mL log10) of facultative anaerobes, strict anaerobes, odontopathogens (S. mutans, Lactobacillus spp. and Actinomyces spp.) and periodontopathogens (A. actinomycetemcomitans, Capnocytophaga spp., Campylobacter spp. and Fusobacterium spp.). CONCLUSION: Our new global oral health scale shows a positive correlation with the detection and quantification of certain odontopathogens and periodontopathogens present in the saliva, confirming their possible infectious potential. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Our own design of oral health scale could be particularly useful for the epidemiological study of different populations, the evaluation of the influence of oral health on the development of certain systemic diseases as well as the analysis of inter- and intra-individual variability of the oral microbiota in relation to the different grades of the oral health scale.
TI  - Oral microbiota in Swiss adolescents.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the study was to determine the prevalence of different oral microbes in gingival plaque samples and in samples from the dorsum of the tongue in a Swiss adolescent population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ninety-nine adolescents between 15 and 18 years were enrolled. Plaque index, bleeding on probing (BOP), the periodontal screening index, and decayed missed filled tooth (DMFT) index were recorded. Samples from subgingival plaque and swabs from the tongue were analyzed by the Checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization method. Additionally, counts of Streptococus mutans and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia, and Treponema denticola were determined by real-time PCR. RESULTS: Periodontitis was not diagnosed in any of the subjects but all of them presented signs of gingival inflammation displaying a mean BOP of 28%. Ten (10.1%) subjects were tested positive for P. gingivalis, each 22 (22.2%) for A. actinomycetemcomitans and T. forsythia, (47.5%) for T. denticola. T. denticola and S. mutans showed a high affinity to the gingival plaque, whereas T. forsythia was often detected from the dorsum of the tongue. DMFT was associated with S. mutans counts, and BOP correlated with counts of P. gingivalis and T. denticola. CONCLUSIONS: The present data indicate that: (a) gingivitis but not periodontitis is a common finding among Swiss adolescents, and (b) bacteria associated with periodontitis were frequently detected in the subgingival dental plaque and on the dorsum of the tongue in Swiss adolescents with gingivitis. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Although gingivitis was a frequent finding in Swiss adolescents, periodontitis was not detected in this population. The dorsum of the tongue appears to represent an important reservoir for periodontopathic bacteria.
TI  - Bacterial leakage along the implant-abutment interface: culture and DNA Checkerboard hybridization analyses.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Bacterial species have been found harboring the internal surface of dental implants as consequence of their failed connections. The aim of the present study was to compare the detection frequency of bacterial leakage from human saliva through the implant-abutment interface, under non-loading conditions, using either DNA Checkerboard or culture method. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty dental implants with hexagonal platforms were connected to pre-machined abutments according to the manufacturers' specifications. The assemblies were individually incubated in human saliva under anaerobic conditions for 7 days at 37 degrees C. Afterward, contents from the inner parts of the implants were collected and evaluated with either DNA Checkerboard (s = 15) or culture (n = 15). Subsequently, identification and quantitation of bacterial species from saliva and implants were carried out for the group evaluated with the DNA Checkerboard method. RESULTS: Both DNA Checkerboard and culture showed positive signals of bacterial leakage in 6 of the 15 evaluated samples. Capnocytophaga gingivalis and Streptococcus mutans were the most frequently detected species harboring the internal surface of the implants followed by Veillonella parvula. CONCLUSION: Occurrence of bacterial leakage along the implant-abutment interface is comparably detected with both DNA Checkerboard hybridization and conventional culture methods.
TI  - Clustering of subgingival microbial species in adolescents with periodontitis.
AB  - It has become increasingly recognized that groups of microorganisms interact within the subgingival plaque of adult subjects with periodontitis. It is much less clear, however, whether the consortia of microorganisms associated with periodontitis are different in early and more advanced cases of periodontitis. To investigate this point further, subgingival plaque was collected from six sites in 87 adolescents with periodontitis and 73 controls and the samples were analyzed for the detection of 18 microbial species using the DNA-DNA hybridization technique. Actinomyces oris accounted for the highest proportion of the flora and was more predominant among controls. Prevotella nigrescens, Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Tannerella forsythia were present at higher levels among the subjects with periodontitis. Factor analyses identified one factor characterized by highly positive loadings for T. forsythia, Campylobacter rectus, P. gingivalis, P. intermedia, P. nigrescens, Parvimonas micra, and Treponema denticola, and another factor characterized by highly positive loadings of A. oris, Capnocytophaga ochracea, Eikenella corrodens, Streptococcus intermedius, Selenomonas noxia, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus sanguinis, and Veillonella parvula. Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and Streptococcus mutans did not load on any of the two factors, while Fusobacterium nucleatum loaded on both. These findings confirm the occurrence of clustering of subgingival bacteria according to case status also among young individuals.
TI  - Clonal analysis of the microbiota of severe early childhood caries.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Severe early childhood caries is a microbial infection that severely compromises the dentition of young children. The aim of this study was to characterize the microbiota of severe early childhood caries. METHODS: Dental plaque samples from 2- to 6-year-old children were analyzed using 16S rRNA gene cloning and sequencing, and by specific PCR amplification for Streptococcus mutans and Bifidobacteriaceae species. RESULTS: Children with severe caries (n = 39) had more dental plaque and gingival inflammation than caries-free children (n = 41). Analysis of phylotypes from operational taxonomic unit analysis of 16S rRNA clonal metalibraries from severe caries and caries-free children indicated that while libraries differed significantly (p < 0.0001), there was increased diversity than detected in this clonal analysis. Using the Human Oral Microbiome Database, 139 different taxa were identified. Within the limits of this study, caries-associated taxa included Granulicatella elegans (p < 0.01) and Veillonella sp. HOT-780 (p < 0.01). The species associated with caries-free children included Capnocytophaga gingivalis (p < 0.01), Abiotrophia defectiva (p < 0.01), Lachnospiraceae sp. HOT-100 (p < 0.05), Streptococcus sanguinis (p < 0.05) and Streptococcus cristatus (p < 0.05). By specific PCR, S. mutans (p < 0.005) and Bifidobacteriaceae spp. (p < 0.0001) were significantly associated with severe caries. CONCLUSION: Clonal analysis of 80 children identified a diverse microbiota that differed between severe caries and caries-free children, but the association of S. mutans with caries was from specific PCR analysis, not from clonal analysis, of samples.
TI  - Bacterial 16S sequence analysis of severe caries in young permanent teeth.
AB  - Previous studies have confirmed the association of the acid producers Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus spp. with childhood caries, but they also suggested these microorganisms are not sufficient to explain all cases of caries. In addition, health-associated bacterial community profiles are not well understood, including the importance of base production and acid catabolism in pH homeostasis. The bacterial community composition in health and in severe caries of the young permanent dentition was compared using Sanger sequencing of the ribosomal 16S rRNA genes. Lactobacillus species were dominant in severe caries, and levels rose significantly as caries progressed from initial to deep lesions. S. mutans was often observed at high levels in the early stages of caries but also in some healthy subjects and was not statistically significantly associated with caries progression in the overall model. Lactobacillus or S. mutans was found either at low levels or not present in several samples. Other potential acid producers observed at high levels in these subjects included strains of Selenomonas, Neisseria, and Streptococcus mitis. Propionibacterium FMA5 was significantly associated with caries progression but was not found at high levels. An overall loss of community diversity occurred as caries progressed, and species that significantly decreased included the Streptococcus mitis-S. pneumoniae-S. infantis group, Corynebacterium matruchotii, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus cristatus, Capnocytophaga gingivalis, Eubacterium IR009, Campylobacter rectus, and Lachnospiraceae sp. C1. The relationship of acid-base metabolism to 16S rRNA gene-based species assignments appears to be complex, and metagenomic approaches that would allow functional profiling of entire genomes will be helpful in elucidating the microbial pathogenesis of caries.
TI  - Does pregnancy have an impact on the subgingival microbiota?
AB  - BACKGROUND: We investigated clinical and subgingival microbiologic changes during pregnancy in 20 consecutive pregnant women > or =18 years not receiving dental care. METHODS: Bacterial samples from weeks 12, 28, and 36 of pregnancy and at 4 to 6 weeks postpartum were processed for 37 species by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Clinical periodontal data were collected at week 12 and at 4 to 6 weeks postpartum, and bleeding on probing (BOP) was recorded at sites sampled at the four time points. RESULTS: The mean BOP at week 12 and postpartum was 40.1% +/- 18.2% and 27.4% +/- 12.5%, respectively. The corresponding mean BOP at microbiologic test sites was 15% (week 12) and 21% (postpartum; not statistically significant). Total bacterial counts decreased between week 12 and postpartum (P <0.01). Increased bacterial counts over time were found for Neisseria mucosa (P <0.001). Lower counts (P <0.001) were found for Capnocytophaga ochracea, Capnocytophaga sputigena, Eubacterium saburreum, Fusobacterium nucleatum naviforme, Fusobacterium nucleatum polymorphum, Leptotrichia buccalis, Parvimonas micra (previously Peptostreptococcus micros or Micromonas micros), Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella melaninogenica, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus sanguinis, Selenomonas noxia, and Veillonella parvula. No changes occurred between weeks 12 and 28 of pregnancy. Counts of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia (previously T. forsythensis), and Treponema denticola did not change. Counts of P. gingivalis and T. forsythia at week 12 were associated with gingivitis (P <0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Subgingival levels of bacteria associated with periodontitis did not change. P. gingivalis and T. forsythia counts were associated with BOP at week 12. A decrease was found in 17 of 37 species from week 12 to postpartum. Only counts of N. mucosa increased.
TI  - Caries-related plaque microcosm biofilms developed in microplates.
AB  - In vivo dental plaque biofilms consist of complex communities of oral bacteria that are a challenge to replicate in vitro. The aim of this investigation was to establish human dental plaque microcosms in microplates to reflect conditions that are relevant to dental caries. Microcosm plaque biofilms were initiated from the saliva of two different donors, grown for up to 10 days in 24-welled microplates on Thermanox coverslips in various types of artificial saliva with and without sucrose, which were replaced daily. Microbiota composition of 40 species associated with oral health and dental caries was monitored in the plaques using Checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization analysis. pH was measured as an indicator of cariogenic potential. The composition of the saliva inocula was different, and yielded plaque microcosms with different composition and growth responses to sucrose. Artificial saliva type and presence of sucrose, and the resulting growth and pH conditions, modified the growth of individual species and hence the ecological profile of the microplate plaques during development. Complex population shifts were observed during development, and older plaques comprised predominantly facultative anaerobic species. Sucrose supplementation limited the decline of Streptococci over time but did not increase the abundance of mutans Streptococci. Sucrose at 0.15% increased levels of caries-associated species including Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Actinomyces gerensceriae; these were further increased with sucrose at 0.5%, in addition to Actinomyces israelii, Rothia dentocariosa and Capnocytophaga gingivalis. The microplate plaques demonstrated complex community dynamics that appeared to reflect the maturation of natural plaques, and sucrose induced a cariogenic plaque composition and pH.
TI  - Antimicrobial effect of acidified nitrate and nitrite on six common oral pathogens in vitro.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Salivary nitrate is positively correlated with plasma nitrate and its level is 9 times the plasma level after nitrate loading. Nitrate in saliva is known to be reduced to nitrite by oral bacteria. Nitrate and nitrite levels in saliva are 3 - 5 times those in serum in physiological conditions respectively in our previous study. The biological functions of high salivary nitrate and nitrite are still not well understood. The aim of this in vitro study was to investigate the antimicrobial effects of nitrate and nitrite on main oral pathogens under acidic conditions. METHODS: Six common oral pathogens including Streptococcus mutans NCTC 10449, Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4646, Porphyromonas gingivalis ATCC 33277, Capnocytophaga gingivalis ATCC 33624, Fusobacterium nucleatum ATCC 10953, and Candida albicans ATCC 10231 were cultured in liquid medium. Sodium nitrate or sodium nitrite was added to the medium to final concentrations of 0, 0.5, 1, 2, and 10 mmol/L. All of the microorganisms were incubated for 24 to 48 hours. The optical densities (OD) of cell suspensions were determined and the cultures were transferred to solid nutrient broth medium to observe the minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal/fungicidal concentration for the six tested pathogens. RESULTS: Nitrite at concentrations of 0.5 to 10 mmol/L had an inhibitory effect on all tested organisms at low pH values. The antimicrobial effect of nitrite increased with the acidity of the medium. Streptococcus mutans NCTC 10449 was highly sensitive to nitrite at low pH values. Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4646 and Candida albicans ATCC 10231 were relatively resistant to acidified nitrite. Nitrate at the given concentrations and under acidic conditions had no inhibitory effect on the growth of any of the tested pathogens. CONCLUSION: Nitrite, at a concentration equal to that in human saliva, is both cytocidal and cytostatic to six principal oral pathogens in vitro, whereas nitrate at a similar concentration has no antimicrobial effect on these organisms.
TI  - Effects of selected immunouppressive drugs on prostaglandin release, protein synthesis and cell proliferation in human gingival fibroblasts and on the growth of plaque bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Immunosuppressants play an essential role in transplantation therapy. In view of the side effects, e.g. gingival overgrowth, the present in vitro study was performed in order to investigate the effect of selected immunosuppressants on metabolic activities of gingival fibroblasts. Furthermore, the effect on the growth of six oral microorganisms was investigated. METHODS: Human gingival fibroblasts were incubated in the presence of azathioprine (Aza), cyclosporin A (CsA), tacrolimus (Tac) or mycophenolatmofetil (Myc). PGE subset 2 release was determined by means of a specific competitive enzyme immunoassay, using monoclonal antibodies specific for PGE subset 2 (clone E2R1). The protein content was measured spectrophotometrically. A redox indicator system was employed to assess the proliferation activity. In an additional trial the growth of six strains of oral bacteria (A. viscosus T14V, S. oralis H1, S. mutans 10449, C. gingivalis DR2001, A. actinomycetemcomitans Y4, and M. micros 33270) in the presence of the immunosuppressants was measured. RESULTS: In comparison with the controls, the PGE subset 2 release was increased by 39.3% following incubation with Aza, and by 77.0% with CsA. The protein concentrations (1 g immunosuppressant / ml medium) were reduced by 26.0% for Aza and 17.0% for Myc. Furthermore, a drug-dependent inhibition in the cell proliferation rate was noted after an incubation period of 6 hours (Aza 70.7%, CsA 78.2%, Myc 69.8%, Tac 64.0%). The most pronounced growth-inhibiting effects were observed for CsA at values ranging from 21.0% (S. mutans 10449) to 48.6% (A. viscosus T14V) growth inhibition. CONCLUSIONS: The present study with common immunsuppresants demonstrated both a medication- and dose-dependent alteration in the metabolic activity of gingival fibroblasts. Furthermore, growth-inhibitory effects on the selected bacterial strains could be observed.
TI  - Porphyromonas gingivalis outer membrane vesicles promote bacterial resistance to  chlorhexidine.
AB  - Porphyromonas gingivalis has been frequently associated with some types of periodontal diseases and possesses various mechanisms favoring the pathogenic process. It has been recently observed that vesicles elaborated by P. gingivalis are able to protect bacteria from the bactericidal activity of human serum. The aim of the present investigation was to evaluate the ability of vesicles from P. gingivalis in protecting oral bacteria against chlorhexidine. Data indicate that vesicles released by P. gingivalis may bind chlorhexidine, thus allowing protection for itself and for other oral bacterial species. It has also been demonstrated that lipopolysaccharides are the major component involved in the binding of chlorhexidine by vesicles. The mechanism of resistance reported in this study indicates that bacterial interactions in the oral cavity may influence the sensitivity of microbes.
TI  - An analysis of the subgingival microflora in randomly selected subjects.
AB  - The aim of this study was to describe the presence of some microbial species in the subgingival microflora of a randomly selected subject sample. A further objective was to analyze the association between some microbiological characteristics and the periodontal conditions of the subjects. A total of 171 individuals aged 30-65 years were included. A pooled subgingival plaque sample was obtained from the mesial aspect of the 6 Ramfjord teeth by the use of the paper-point method. The samples were processed and analyzed according to standardized procedures. The periodontal condition of the subjects was examined clinically and included assessment of plaque, gingivitis, probing pocket depth and probing attachment level. The results showed that 81% of the subjects were positive for Campylobacter rectus, 80% for Fusobacterium nucleatum, 77% for Streptococcus sanguis, 72% for Streptococcus mitis, 66% for Eikenella corrodens, 58% for Prevotella intermedia, 32% for Capnocytophaga, 27% for Selenomonas, 25% for Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, 14% for Porphyromonas gingivalis and 13% for Streptococcus mutans. Small differences in the periodontal conditions were observed between subjects harboring P. gingivalis, A. actinomytecomitans or > 5% P. intermedia and the rest of the sample. Similarly small differences in the clinical parameters were revealed when the subjects were grouped according to proportions of disease-associated and health-associated species in their subgingival samples.
TI  - Effects of anaerobiosis and aerobiosis on interactions of human polymorphonuclear leukocytes with the dental plaque bacteria Streptococcus mutans, Capnocytophaga ochracea, and Bacteroides gingivalis.
AB  - Human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) were able to generate and release superoxide anions upon stimulation of Streptococcus mutans, Bacteroides gingivalis, and Capnocytophaga ochracea when incubated aerobically but not when incubated anaerobically. Lysozyme release and phagocytosis by PMN were independent of oxygen, and no difference between PMN incubated aerobically or anaerobically was observed (PMN stimulated by B. gingivalis released 7.6% total lysozyme when aerobic and 6.9% when anaerobic). There were variations in lysozyme release and phagocytosis for the three organisms, particularly for phagocytosis. B. gingivalis and C. ochracea yielded lower phagocytosis values than those for S. mutans, e.g., at 1 h 67% of the initial inoculum of S. mutans was phagocytosed (versus only 40% for B. gingivalis). Transmission electron microscopy showed that both S. mutans and B. gingivalis were internalized into classical phagolysosomes. In contrast, C. ochracea showed two forms of internalization; C. ochracea either formed a classical phagolysosome or was tightly bound in the cytoplasm with no surrounding cell membrane. Intracellular killing of S. mutans and C. ochracea was unaffected by anaerobiosis, but killing of C. ochracea was much lower than that of S. mutans (1 x 10(7) to 2 x 10(7) bacteria killed compared with 5.1 x 10(7) bacteria killed at 6 h). In contrast, a greater number of B. gingivalis was killed in the presence of oxygen (5.3 x 10(7) bacteria were killed when aerobically incubated and 1.9 x 10(7) bacteria were killed when anaerobically incubated). These results suggest that the ability to survive anaerobically may enable some bacteria to evade PMN killing; however, abnormal phagocytosis may represent a more efficient way to evade both oxygen-dependent and -independent killing mechanisms, leading to enhanced virulence of the organism.
TI  - Effects of chlorhexidine on proteolytic and glycosidic enzyme activities of dental plaque bacteria.
AB  - Chlorhexidine was tested for its ability to inhibit a wide range of glycosidic and proteolytic enzyme activities produced by Treponema denticola, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Bacteroides intermedius, Actinobacillus actinomycemcomitans, Capnocytophaga sputigena, Capnocytophaga gingivalis, Capnocytophaga orchracea, Capnocytophaga sp., Actinomyces viscosus, Streptococcus mitior, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus oralis and Streptococcus sanguis. The enzymes produced by Capnocytophaga spp. were the most resistant to inhibition by chlorhexidine while the hydrolysis of proteolytic substrates by all the other species was markedly susceptible to inhibition with less than 0.125 mM chlorhexidine inhibiting enzyme activities by greater than or equal to 50%. Glycosidase activities, of all species, were generally more resistant to inhibition, especially neuraminidase activity. Chlorhexidine at less than 0.032 mM inhibited the degradation of bovine serum albumin by suspensions of dental plaque bacteria. These observations support an hypothesis that chlorhexidine exerts a bacteristatic effect in vivo, in part, by reducing the ability of dental plaque bacteria to degrade host-derived proteins and glycoproteins which normally provide essential nutrients for growth.
TI  - Inhibition of neutrophil chemotaxis by soluble bacterial products.
AB  - BACTERIAL-NEUTROPHIL INTERACTIONS may be critical determinants of virulence in periodontal diseases. This study was undertaken to examine the ability of major bacterial species from the human oral cavity to inhibit (1) peripheral blood neutrophil chemotaxis, (2) chemotactic formylmethionyl peptide binding, and (3) phagocytosis. Included were cultured supernatants and sonic extracts obtained from strains of Capnocytophaga, Bacteroides gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Bacteroides asaccharolyticus, Capnocytophaga species, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Neisseria, Actinomyces viscosus, Bacterionema matruchotii, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus mutans, and Streptococcus sanguis. Chemotaxis was measured using Boyden chambers; phagocytosis was determined using Staphylococcus aureus as the indicator organism and radioactive chemotactic peptide binding was assessed by a rapid filtration assay. None of the test organisms were cytotoxic to neutrophils or inhibited neutrophil phagocytosis. Capnocytophaga species., Bacteroides species., A. actinomycetemcomitans, and F. nucleatum produced factors which specifically inhibited neutrophil chemotaxis. Activity was lost after dialysis. Extracts of Bacteroides species, A. actinomycetemcomitans and F. nucleatum, which were not chemotactic by themselves, inhibited binding of chemotactic peptide suggesting that in vitro chemotaxis inhibition was mediated by nonchemotactic components that compete for the chemotactic factor receptor on the neutrophil. The exception was Capnocytophaga which appeared to inhibit chemotaxis by inhibition of a post-binding event. Such chemotactic inhibitors from periodontopathic organisms that inhibit neutrophil function may be important determinants of virulence.
TI  - Influence of sublethal antibiotic concentrations on bacterial adherence to saliva-treated hydroxyapatite.
AB  - The influence of growth in the presence of sublethal concentrations of nine antibiotics on the ability of certain potentially odontopathic bacteria to attach to saliva-treated hydroxyapatite surfaces which mimic teeth was studied. Cells of Actinomyces viscosus LY7 and S2, Bacteroides gingivalis 381, Capnocytophaga ochraceus 6, and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans N27 attached in lower numbers to saliva-treated hydroxyapatite when grown in the presence of 50% of the minimum inhibitory concentration of tetracycline. Electron microscopic observations of negatively stained preparations indicated that tetracycline-grown A. viscosus LY7 cells had fewer fimbriae than did untreated cells, which may account for the impaired ability of the treated cells to attach. However, cells of Actinomyces naeslundii L13 and S4 attached in higher numbers when grown in the presence of tetracycline, clindamycin, erythromycin, chloramphenicol, or neomycin. Streptococcus mutans strains H12 and JBP also exhibited increased adherence to saliva-treated hydroxyapatite when grown in the presence of 50 or 25% of the minimum inhibitory concentration of penicillin. Thus, growth in the presence of sublethal antibiotic concentrations could increase as well as decrease the adherence of bacteria to saliva-treated hydroxyapatite. Antibiotic-grown cells of the Actinomyces strains showed enhanced hemagglutination activity, but this did not correlate with their ability to attach to saliva-treated hydroxyapatite. Sublethal concentrations of antibiotics in the growth media also affected the coaggregation reactions of several organisms; the effects were specific for one member of the coaggregation pair.
