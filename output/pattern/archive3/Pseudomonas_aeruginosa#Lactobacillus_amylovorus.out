bacteria competing with the adhesion and biofilm formation by staphylococcus aureus.
the activity of antagonistic substances produced by pseudomonas aeruginosa and lactobacillus acidophilus against the planktonic and sessile populations of staphylococcus aureus strains was demonstrated. the strongest effects were caused by probiotic l. acidophilus strain - bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances (blis) positive. however, the s. aureus a3 growth, adhesion and biofilm formation was also limited by cell-free supernatant of l. acidophilus h-1 (blis negative). moreover, competitive direct interactions were observed between staphylococci and the above bacteria, which influenced the formation of dualspecies aggregates on the surface.
isolation and identification of antimicrobial compound from mentha longifolia l.  leaves grown wild in iraq.
background: mentha longifolia l. (lamiaceae) leaves have been traditionally implemented in the treatment of minor sore throat and minor mouth or throat irritation by the indigenous people of iraq, although the compounds responsible for the medicinal properties have not been identified. in the present study, an antimicrobial compound was isolated and characterized, and its biological activity was assessed. methods: the compound was isolated and characterized from the extracted essential oil using different spectral techniques: tlc, ftir spectra and hplc. antimicrobial activity of the compound was assessed using both disc diffusion and microdilution method in 96 multi-well microtiter plates. results: a known compound was isolated from the essential oil of the plant and was identified as (-) menthol. the isolated compound was investigated for its antimicrobial activity against seven selected pathogenic and non-pathogenic microorganisms: staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus faecalis, streptococcus pyogenis, lactobacillus acidophilus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and the yeast candida albicans. menthol at different concentrations (1:1, 1:5, 1:10, 1:20) was active against all tested bacteria except for p. aeruginosa, and the highest inhibitory effect was observed against s. mutans (zone of inhibition: 25.3 mm) using the disc diffusion method. minimal inhibitory concentration mic values ranged from 15.6-125.0 microg/ml, and the most promising results were observed against s. aureus and s. mutans (mic 15.6 microg/ml) while, s. faecalis, s. pyogenis and l. acidophilus ranked next (mic 31.2 microg/ml). furthermore, menthol achieved considerable antifungal activity against the yeast c. albicans (zone of inhibition range: 7.1-18.5 mm; mic: 125.0). conclusion: the isolation of an antimicrobial compound from m. longifolia leaves validates the use of this plant in the treatment of minor sore throat and minor mouth or throat irritation.
characterization of the amylovorin locus of lactobacillus amylovorus dce 471, producer of a bacteriocin active against pseudomonas aeruginosa, in combination with colistin and pyocins.
lactobacillus amylovorus dce 471 produces amylovorin l, a bacteriocin with an antibacterial activity against some strains of the lactobacillus lineage. based on the sequence of one active peptide, a gene encoding active amylovorin l was cloned and sequenced. genome walking allowed us to sequence a larger fragment of 7577 bp of genomic dna, with 12 predicted orfs. the previously characterized amylovorin l peptide-encoding gene is preceded by another gene encoding a small polypeptide with a typical bacteriocin-processing double-glycine site, suggesting that amylovorin l is a two-component class iib bacteriocin (amylovorin lalpha/beta). lalpha and lbeta show the highest similarity to gassericin t from lactobacillus gasseri sbt2055 and blpn from streptococcus pneumoniae r6, respectively, and to lafa and lafx, which form the lactacin f bacteriocin of lactobacillus johnsonii ncc 533. as for other lactic acid bacteria bacteriocins, amylovorin l showed no activity against the gram-negative opportunistic pathogen pseudomonas aeruginosa on its own, but showed synergistic inhibitory activity when used in combination with the peptide antibiotic colistin, and, remarkably, with the p. aeruginosa soluble bacteriocins, pyocins s1 and s2.
[the antagonistic activity of the eubiotic maxilin towards wound infection and its effect on the antibiotic resistance of microorganisms].
antagonistic activity of lactic acid bacteria of strain n 2585 of "maxilin" probiotic in respect to the strains s. aureus, p. aeruginosa, e. coli, candida albicans and their effect on the level of sustainability of the antibiotic resistant strains s. aureus, e. coli, p. aeruginosa, which are extracted from the patients with open fractures of the mandible under various course of wound process, have been studied. the studies showed that lactic acid bacteria have suppressed growth of strains candida most actively, followed by p. aeruginosa, s. aureus and e. coli. the use of "maxilin" probiotic allowed reducing the epidemiological significance of pathogenetic strains already in 3 to 4 days. the sensibility studies showed high activity of the lactic acid bacteria in reducing antibiotic resistance of the strains investigated. it was revealed that "maxilin" probiotic affects ps. aeruginosa effectively, somewhat less st. aureus and e. coli. the extracted strains demonstrated sensibility to all investigated antibiotics already in 3 to 4 days.
[the primary screening of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli strains to develop effective probiotic preparations based on them].
10 bifidobacterium strains and 10 lactobacillus strains were studied for their antagonistic activity with respect to escherichia coli, klebsiella ozaenae, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and for their sensitivity to antibiotics, widely used in clinical practice. l. acidophilus strain 5/4, l. acidophilus strain 18/4, b. adolescentis strain ux, b. longum strain 44 exhibited the highest antagonistic activity and the highest degree of antibiotic resistance. the restriction analysis of the chromosomal dna of these strains was then made and their plasmid content was studied, making it possible to recognize these strains in future in the course of in vivo experiments.
the human lactobacillus acidophilus strain la1 secretes a nonbacteriocin antibacterial substance(s) active in vitro and in vivo.
the adhering human lactobacillus acidophilus strain la1 inhibits the cell association and cell invasion of enteropathogens in cultured human intestinal caco-2 cells (m. f. bernet, d. brassard, j. r. neeser, and a. l. servin, gut 35:483-489, 1994). here, we demonstrate that strain la1 developed its antibacterial activity in conventional or germ-free mouse models orally infected by salmonella typhimurium. we present evidence that the spent culture supernatant of strain la1 (la1-scs) contained antibacterial components active against s. typhimurium infecting the cultured human intestinal caco-2 cells. the la1-scs antibacterial activity was observed in vitro against a wide range of gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens, such as staphylococcus aureus, listeria monocytogenes, s. typhimurium, shigella flexneri, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacter cloacae. by contrast, no activity was observed against species of the normal gut flora, such as lactobacilli and bifidobacteria. the la1-scs antibacterial activity was insensitive to proteases and independent of lactic acid production.
antibacterial effect of the adhering human lactobacillus acidophilus strain lb.
the spent culture supernatant of the human lactobacillus acidophilus strain lb produces an antibacterial activity against a wide range of gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens. it decreased the in vitro viability of staphylococcus aureus, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella typhimurium, shigella flexneri, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, bacillus cereus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacter spp. in contrast, it did not inhibit lactobacilli and bifidobacteria. the activity was heat stable and relatively sensitive to enzymatic treatments and developed under acidic conditions. the antimicrobial activity was independent of lactic acid production. activity against s. typhimurium sl1344 infecting human cultured intestinal caco-2 cells was observed as it was in the conventional c3h/he/oujco mouse model with s. typhimurium c5 infection and oral treatment with the lb spent culture supernatant.
antimicrobial activity of neutralized extracellular culture filtrates of lactic acid bacteria isolated from a cultured indian milk product ('dahi').
neutralized extracellular culture filtrate obtained from isolates of lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus delbruecki ssp. bulgaricus, lactobacillus salivarius and lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis from 'dahi' showed weak to moderate inhibition of staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, escherichia coli, bacillus brevis, bacillus circulans, bacillus coagulans, bacillus laterosporus, bacillus subtilis and pseudomonas aeruginosa when tested by the diffusion agar well assay method. the effective minimum quantity of lactic culture filtrates required to obtain complete inhibition of an inoculum of 10(3) cfu/ml of the bacteria tested was between 20 and 26% (vol/vol), as determined by the agar incorporation method. neutralized extracellular culture filtrate of these lactic cultures added at a level of 10% in sterile, 10% reconstituted non-fat dry milk was able to either suppress or retard growth of selected bacterial cultures when incubated at 37 degrees c for 24 h. this study indicated the antimicrobial activity of dahi and the potential of using neutralized extracellular culture filtrate of lactic acid bacteria in the biopreservation of foods.
