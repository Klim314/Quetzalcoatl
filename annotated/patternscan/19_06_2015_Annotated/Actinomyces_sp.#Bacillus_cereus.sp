TI  == [the effectiveness of glass bead sterilizer in the dental practice].
AB  == objectives: although it is not fda-approved as inter-patients sterilization measure, in israel, glass bead sterilizer is still a common method for chair-side sterilization of small dental hand instruments, especially endodontic files. studies from the 1950-1970s achieved sterilization by the bead sterilizer within  few seconds. nevertheless, there are no current evidence-based instructions for using this sterilizer. the study was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of this method in sterilization of endodontic files, according to current microbiologic knowledge. methods: standard endodontic k-files (#15, 50, 80) were  sterilized in a steam autoclave and then soaked in actinomyces israelii, eikenella corrodens or bacillus cereus [0.5 macfarland] media for 10 sec. after drying, the files were placed in 225 degrees c or 250 degrees c-heated glass bead sterilizers for 0, 15, 30 or 60 sec. after appropriate incubation for 10 d, morphologic and biochemical examinations were performed to reveal bacterial growth. results: files that have been contaminated with a. israelii were sterilized within 30 sec, whereas b. cereus and e. corrodens-contaminated files needed 60 sec for sterilization. conclusions: the use in bead sterilizer has to be limited only for sterilization of intra-appointment purpose. however, it seems that the common method of using bead sterilizer for sterilization time of few seconds is not effective. in order to eliminate spore-forming bacteria, like b. cereus, by bead sterilizer, the sterilization time has to be at least 60 sec. more research is needed, however, for establishing the effectiveness of the bead  sterilizer for viral infection control and for other dental instruments.

TI  == systemic dexamethasone and its effect on normal aerobic bacterial flora of cow.
AB  == this study was carried out on 17 holestein, heifers, aged between 1 to 2 years for determining the normal aerobic bacterial flora and their changes after dexamethasone injection. swab samples were taken from eye, ear, pharynx and vagina before and 5 days after twice dexamethasone treatment. results indicated that bacillus cereus and corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis had higher frequency  of isolations than the other bacterial flora in eye, ear and pharynx. actinomyces pyogenes was isolated with considerable frequency from vagina. klebsiella pneumoniae was also isolated from pharynx and its frequency was increased significantly after dexamethasone injection (p < 0.05).

TI  == diversity of biosurfactant producing microorganisms isolated from soils contaminated with diesel oil.
AB  == biosurfactant production is a desirable property of hydrocarbon-degrading microorganisms (hdm). we characterized biosurfactant producing microbial populations from a long beach soil, california (usa) and a hong kong soil (china), contaminated with diesel oil. a total of 33 hydrocarbon-utilizing microorganisms were isolated from the soils. twelve isolates and three defined consortia were tested for biosurfactant production and emulsification activity. the highest reduction of surface tension was achieved with a consortium of l1, l2 and l3 isolates from a long beach soil (41.4mn m(-1)). isolate l1 (acinetobacter  junii) displayed the highest reduction of surface tension (46.5 mn m(-1)). the emulsifying capacity evaluated by the e24 emulsification index was highest in the culture of isolate l5 (74%). no substantial emulsification was achieved with the  cell-free extracts, indicating that the emulsifying activity was not extracellular. based on surface tension and the e24 index results, isolates f1, f2, f3, f4, l1, l2, l3 and l4 were identified by 16s rrna gene sequencing as bacillus cereus, bacillus sphaericus, b. fusiformis, acinetobacter junii, a non-cultured bacterium, pseudomonas sp. and b. pumilus, respectively. cluster analyses of 16s rrna gene sequences of the bacterial isolates revealed 70% similarity amongst hydrocarbon-degrading bacterial community present in both soils. five isolates (isolates f1, f2, f3, f4 and l4) belong to the firmicutes order, two isolates (l1 and l3) belong to the proteobacteria order and one isolate (l2) is an actinomyces sp. simpson's index (1 - d) and the shannon-weaver index (h) revealed more diversity of hdm in the hong kong soil, while evenness (e) and the equitability (j) data indicated that there was not a dominant population. bacterial isolates displaying substantial potential for production of biosurfactants can be applied in the bioremediation of soils contaminated with petroleum hydrocarbons.

TI  == further observations on enhancement of the infectivity of fusobacterium necrophorum by other bacteria.
AB  == it had already been shown with a single virulent strain (a42) of fusobacterium necrophorum that suspension of the fusobacteria in sub-lethal doses of broth cultures of other bacteria reduced the minimum infective dose (greater than 10(6) organisms) for mice by subcutaneous inoculation, sometimes to less than 10 organisms. the present study extended the known range of bacteria with strong infectivity-enhancing properties to include bacillus cereus, klebsiella oxytoca and staphylococcus aureus; and those with weaker effect to include bacillus subtilis, 'bacteroides melaninogenicus', clostridium sporogenes, pasteurella haemolytica, and proteus mirabilis. the study also showed that five further virulent strains of f. necrophorum closely resembled a42 in respect of striking susceptibility to infectivity enhancement by escherichia coli. actinomyces (corynebacterium) pyogenes and s. aureus. one further strain (a6) of f. necrophorum resembled a42 in respect of strong infectivity enhancement by a. pyogenes, s. aureus, b. cereus and k. oxytoca but differed from it and the other  five strains in being only slightly affected by e. coli. this work was a necessary prelude to the development of a method, based on infectivity enhancement, for the detection and isolation of f. necrophorum present in small numbers in heavily contaminated material such as faeces.

TI  == bactericidal action of carbon dioxide laser radiation in experimental dental root canals.
AB  == the ability of a carbon dioxide laser to sterilize the root canal of human teeth  has been investigated. three oral bacteria, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus  mutans, and actinomyces viscosus, and three other bacteria, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were used as experimental organisms. exposure of cells on glass slides to laser radiation showed there was  little difference in the exposure required to kill these six organisms. complete  recovery of bacteria from the root canal was initially a problem and was only achieved when bacterial manipulations and removal were carried out in rapid succession, within 5 min of inoculation. however, the geometry of the instrumented canal and the laser alignment were major factors in achieving consistent cell death of oral bacteria in the root canals. using sets of 10 teeth, four repeated exposures of 10 w for 1 s was found to sterilize 4 or more of the teeth.

TI  == [effect of solid substrates of microbial colony development].
AB  == bacteria have been found to grow differently at contact sites to both organic and anorganic solids as on pure agar media. of 16 ad hoc selected bacterial strains,  the following species (arranged in decreasing order) responded with stronger colony formation: bacillus subtilis, b. cereus, streptococcus sanguis, s. saprophyticus, s. faecalis, escherichia coli, micrococcus flavus, actinomyces viscosus, veillonella sp., enterobacter liquefaciens, yersinia enterocolitica. lactobacillus casei behaved neutral. proteus vulgaris, y. enterocolitica and chromobacterium violaceum grow on certain media only in the presence of solid particles. the yeasts endomyces lactis, saccharomyces cerevisiae, rhodotorula mucilaginosa and cryptococcus nigricans did not respond to solid particles during colony formation. the kind of protein-animal (meat) or vegetable (soy beans)-did  not influence the behaviour of the microorganisms in these experiments.

TI  == effects of cadmium on the growth and uptake of cadmium by microorganisms.
AB  == six species of microorganisms, escherichia coli, bacillus cereus, lactobacillus acidophilus, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus faecalis and actinomyces niger, were grown under suitable conditions in appropriate media. cadmium chloride was added to provide 0, 5, 10, 20, 40, and 80 mug of cd per ml. at 40 and 80 mug of cd per ml, e. coli and b. cereus grew well and the other species were repressed.  cd uptake patterns differed significantly among the species tested. the significance of these data with respect to cd in food chains is discussed.
